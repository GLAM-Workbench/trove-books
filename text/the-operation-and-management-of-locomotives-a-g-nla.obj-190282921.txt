A DESCRIPTION OF LOCOMOTIVE PARTS.


1 -1 Introduction.
The operations of the railway service depends to a large extent
upon the capacity of a locomotive driver to maintain the correct
running schedule for the type of train which is being worked over the
various sections in the railway system. This is governed in the main by
the ability of the locomotive to haul the train to time when working
fast and exacting services over the various gradients. To do this, the
locomotive must be in good mechanical condition; properly serviced and
maintained, and any defects that develop in the component parts must be
readily located and rectified by the mechanical staff.
To assist the mechanical staff in the servicing of locomotives,
it is the drivers duty to bring under notice any defects that may
prevent the locomotive from performing efficiently and it is therefore
essential that a driver be familiar with the various component parts,
so that a correct entry may be made in the locomotive repair book.
The stabling driver can assist the mechanical staff to a large
degree, by bringing under notice, defects that develop while the
locomotive is in service. A large number of these defects, can only
be located, when the locomotive is being worked on heavy gradients at
its maximum capacity. Then the driver, who has a knowledge of the
various parts, can readily locate the defect and make a correct entry
in the locomotive repair book so that appropriate action can be taken
by the mechanical staff,
Failure on the part of the driver to make a correct entry in the
locomotive repair book, through insufficient knowledge in the naming of
the various locomotive parts, often results in confusion as to which
part requires attention and can lead to the eventual failure of the
locomotive in service, thus causing disorganisation to the train ser-
vices and loss of engine power while the locomotive is out of service.
This section has been designed to standardise the names of the
various component parts of the steam locomotive; thus avoiding the
possibilityof confusion between the mechanical and running staff in
the interpretation of repairs booked to' locomotives.
The various locomotives are illustrated with a list of the
component parts and are to be studied in conjunction with those
already given in Part 1, Section 2 of this edition.

11-1 The Alfloc Automatic Blow-Down Unit.
The boilers of 36, 38, 59 and. 60 class locomotives are fitted with
an automatic blow-down assembly which, operated by steam chest pressure,
will blow down a small quantity of concentrated boiler water, whenever
the regulator is more than one-third open.
The quantity of water passing the automatic valve and escaping
to the track has been carefully adjusted by a choke, so that no
operating difficulty will occur.
The operation is controlled by two wheel valves, one on the
automatic unit where it is connected to the boiler, the other adjacent
to the right hand steam pipe above the footplate. Both valves should
be open for normal operation, and it will be the duty of the Preparing
Driver, or Hostler, also the Driver taking the engine into service,
to see that both valves are open before an engine departs from the
running shed.
The engine crew should note the operation of the automatic blow-
down valve whilst steaming on rising gradients by observing the escape
of water from the discharge pipe which is located at the fireman's step.
Should this fail to occur with both wheel valves in the open position,
the defect should be booked for attention.
It must be clearly understood that, in addition to the operation
of the automatic blow-down valve in steaming, the boiler must be given
the regular blowing down by both engine crews and shed staff, from the
ordinary blow-down valves, on arrival at, and before departure from,
locomotive depots, and at the specified points en route, in accordance
with standing instructions.
12-1 Power Reversing G-ears.
The power assisted reversing gear has been designed to provide
a means by which the valves of the larger classes of locomotives can
be reversed or "notched up" easily and quickly. The Hadfield steam
operated reversing gear is fitted to the AD6O class and the Franklin
air operated gear is fitted to the C3B class locomotive.
Both mechanisms employ a reversing’screw and wheel, of much smaller
dimensions than that used with manually operated gears, these provide
a convenient method of controlling the movement of the operating valves
of the power equipment. Although the Driver is required to turn the
screw in the usual way, the work performed by this screw is practically
negligible, the actual work involved in moving the valves and valve
gear being carried out by either steam or air pressure.
The Hadfield Steam Operated Reversing G-ear.
A sectional view of the Steam Operated Power Reversing Gear as
applied to the AD6O class locomotives is shown in Figure 5 Item 24.


It will be seen that it consists essentially of a steam cylinder and
an oil or cataract cylinder which is arranged in tandem fashion, each
having its own piston, which is fitted on a common piston rod, having
a combined oil reservoir and spring loaded pump.
The steam cylinder is equipped with a steam chest and slide valve
and by moving the valve in either direction, steam is admitted to
one side of the piston causing it to move in the desired direction.
The movement of the piston is transmitted from the crosshead through
the reversing lever, and a system of connecting links, to the quadrant
blocks of each engine.
The oil or "cataract" cylinder and piston serve as a locking device
for locating or retaining the piston rod and reversing lever in any
desired position. The cylinder (on both sides of the piston) and
3-H its ports are filled with oil, and is provided with a "cataract"
by means of which the oil can be passed from one side of the piston
to the other as desired. When the valve is closed, owing to the in-
compressibility of the oil, no movement of the pistons is possible.
By means of suitably arranged levers the cataract valve works in con-
junction with the steam slide valve thereby permitting the movement
of the piston rod when ever the steam slide valve is opened, and also
locking the piston rod in whatever position it may be when the slide
valve is closed.
The combination oil reservoir and spring loaded pump mounted on
the left of the Drivers seat, is connected to each end of the cataract
cylinder by a branch pipe, to provide a means by which any slight
leakage of oil from the cataract cylinder, which would allow the valve
gear to slip when the locomotive is working, can be automatically
replaced. It is therefore essential that the pump be kept in the
backward or "primed" position whenever the locomotive is in service.
When the reversing gear is placed in "centre" position, as shown
by the indicator on the reversing screw in the cab, the various levers
of the reversing engine should be as follows
The control lever, centre roller mounted pivot, should be in the
centre of the slot in the supporting bracket, both the control lever
and reversing lever should be in the vertical position, and the four
quadrant blocks should be in the centre of their respective expansion
links.
The operation of the lever mechanism of the reversing engine is
such that when the reversing screw is moved from centre position, to
say, the full forward gear position the reach rod will move the control
lever about the pin connecting the lever to the crosshead link. This
movement will cause the centre roller mounted pivot to move forward
along the slot in the supporting bracket, at the same time the valve
connecting links, which are also attached to centre roller mounted
pivot, open both the cataract valve and steam slide valve, allowing
steam to enter the forward end of the steam cylinder causing the piston


arid crosshead to move in the backward direction. The movement of the
crosshead and crosshead link then pivots the control lever about the
reach rod pivot pin, causing the roller mounted centre pivot to move
back along the slot in the supporting bracket, until it returns to the
centre of the slot, at which time the valve connecting links will have
closed the cataract and steam valves, the valve gear then being locked
in the full forward position,
13-1 "Melesco" Multiple Regulator Valve,
The Multiple Regulator Valve is fitted to 36, 38* 59 and 60 class
locomotivesj it is housed in the saturated position of the superheater
header.
As the name implies, the regulator consists of a pilot valve and
a series of main valves which are operated in stages by a cam shaft,
the end of which projects through a gland on the left-hand side of the
smokebox.
The valve on the extreme right is the pilot drifting valve and that
on the extreme left is the balancing valve, both valves open simultan-
eously as the driver operates the regulator handle in the qab. The
remaining valves open in the following sequence from left to right.
Regulator valve 1, 3> 2 and 4.
The operating mechanism is on the left-hand side of the boiler,
consisting of levers and rods housed in the hand railing to the lever
in the cab.
All connection or pivot joints are greased lubricated and attended
to on washout days by Shed Staff,
A steam dryer is attached to the internal steam pipe in the dome
of the boiler to minimise the admission of wet steam to the superheater,
14.1 Superheater Booster.
Engine 3616 has been fitted with a modified smoke-box known as the
Giesel Oblong Ejecter, This equipment consists of an oblong blast pipe
and chimmey and a superheater booster.
The superheater booster is simply a damper plate, fitted across
the small flue tubes in the smoke-box and is used to force the hot gases
through the large superheater tubes, thereby raising the temperature
of the superheated steam.
Engine 3&41 is fitted with the superheater booster only.
The superheater booster is fitted with a handle which is located on
the right hand side of ""the smoke-box, behind the right steam pipe.


In service, this handle must be in the vertical position and locked
with the pawl provided, so that the damper will remain closed,
For tube cleaning and boiler washing out, the damper should be
opened, by placing the handle in the horizontal position, facing the cab,
and secured by means of the chain provided.
The superheater booster will increase the temperature of the super-
heated steam by approximately 80 degrees fahrenheit, this will increase
the expansive properties of the steam correspondingly, thus giving a
higher mean effective pressure in the steam cylinders, throughout the
length of the piston stroke.
This will enable the driver to work these engines further back in
the gear, than other engines of this type, thereby obtaining a considerable
saving in the amount of coal and water used,
15-1 Steam Heating Equipment on Locomotives.
A number of locomotives and trains have been fitted with heating
equipment in order to maintain a comfortable temperature in passenger
compartments during the winter months.
Such trains and vehicles are easily recognised by the steam heating
hose couplings which are applied on the opposite side of the drawgear to
that which the air brake hosepipes are fitted.
Heating is accomplished by the provision of a low pressure steam
supply from the locomotive, piped throughout the train with lagged piping
amd branch pipes supplying steam to radiators or heaters in passenger
compartments. The heaters are fitted with controls operated by passengers
to provide the required amount of heat.
Locomotive Equipment.
The steam heating equipment provided onttie locomotive consists of:—
(1) A steam pressure reducing valve located in the cab which is
connected to the steam turret on the boiler and controlled by a
suitable steam stop valve,
(2) A safety valve, outside the cab, connected to the low pressure
side of the reducing valve,
(3) A steam pressure gauge in the cab on the Fireman's side, showing
the pressure on the low pressure side of the reducing valve.


(4) Suitable lagged steam pipe from the reducing valve to the rear
of the tender,
(5) Steam heating hose pipes between the engine and tender and on
the rear of the tender.
(6) A steam trap and separation, situated at the lowest point on
the tender steam pipe, to drain off condensed water.
(7) An end valve, at rear of tender, to permit steam to be cut
off at this point when coupling to, and uncoupling from train.
(8) A dummy coupling to which the steam hose on rear of tender is
to be coupled when not in use.
The steam reducing valve is adjustable by means of an external hand
wheel, and is to be set when connected to a train to a pressure of 45 lb
per square inch.
The safety valve is to be set to blow off at 30 lb. per square inch
to protect the low pressure steam line from fluctuation or incorrect
operation of the reducing valve.

1- Introduction,
For a driver to be successful in train working and for him to be
able to maintain a running schedule, it is essential that his locomotive
be properly prepared for the journey.
The examination of the locomotive must be systematic and thorough
so that loose or defective parts may be detected and any mechanical
attention that is required can be given before the locomotive goes into
service.
Any failure to give adequate attention to lubrication details
within the initial preparation period and at wayside re-servicing
points will materially contribute to over-heating of the bearings, ex-
cessive wear, and even breakage to vital locomotive parts,
AT 1 equipment fitted to the locomotive must be tested} this is
of the utmost importance and the driver should pay particular attention
to this important detail and see that all equipment is operating sat-
isfactorily before taking the locomotive into service,
2- Signing on.
Rosters are placed at depots for the information of enginemen,
showing the time of duty, number of engine and train or trains they are
required to run and particulars of other duties required to be performed.
After signing on duty and obtaining the driver’s daily report
sheet, the driver will peruse the roster for any alterations and examine
the "engine repair book" for any booking regarding mechanical attention
required to his engine and whether such have been attended to. Also sign
general orders, obtain weekly speed notice and other special train
advices.
If enginemen are not booked for any particular duty on the ros-
ter, they must report to the Chargeman after signing on duty for their
assignment,
3- Engineman*s Daily Report Sheet.
Enginemen* s attention is drawn to the instructions for the com-
pilation of Daily Report Sheets in the General Appendix, Part 1,
Drivers’ Daily Report Sheets serve two very important purposes.
Firstly, as a time record which is the basis for payment of enginemen’s
wages and expenses, and secondly, as the basis from which many
SECTION 2.
EXAMINATION, PREPARATION AND STABLING OF LOCOMOTIVES.


important statistics of Railway operations are compiled.
Baoh employee who handles the sheets is responsible for seeing
that all particulars have been entered and correctly shown.
When drivers take an engine out which they have worked on a
previous trip and the engine has been worked on a shift during the
interval, enginemen should havo their sheet endorsed by the Booker-on
or Officer-in-Charge, "Fresh engine". This will be an indication to the
timekeeper that the enginemen are entitled to the full preparation
allowance.
Time running to station or yard and testing brakes, which is to
be shown in section 4, covers the whole time occupied in running from
the Loco Points to the Local Starting Station, Any time occupied in
•hunting or standing between the arrival of the engine at the Station
or Traffic Yard and the time the engine is attached to its train, also
any time occupied after brakes have been tested and before the depart-
ure of the train, is to be entered in section 10 at the back of the
sheet.
Particulars of cause of any delays en-route should be shown in
the "Remarks" column.
Where the starting point of the train is not at a local station
or Traffic Yard, particulars of light running must be shown in sect-
ion 10 in column "Running of Train or Light Engines" in the same manner
as particulars of train running are shown.
Standing Time After Being Released. The certification on the back of
the sheet by the Traffic Officer of the time the engine is released,
represents the time the engine is not further required for Traffic
purposes; but it sometimes happens that engines are not permitted to
leave traffic until a later time due to the road not being clear, etc.
Such standing time is shown by the Driver in the column provided in
Section 4*
Cause of late whistling out, etc,, must be shown in the "Remarks"
column; also any other information which is deemed necessary and for
which columns have not otherwise been provided.
Under no circumstances must any alterations be made in the
entries made by Shunters or other Traffic Officers. If any entry is
disputed a remark to that effect must be made in the "Remarks" column.
Drivers must exercise reasonable care in handling sheets so that
entries can be distinguished. The sheets are to be folded so that the
backs of the sheets giving the Statement of Running, Shunting and Stand-
ing etc,, will be on the inside and protected.
Footnotes (Front of Sheet), Special attention must be given to the foot-
notes at the bottom of the sheet. Failure to show particulars as required
by these notes, causes many avoidable delays before the sheets can be


completed by the office staff. Drivers must make every effort to supply
the information required.
The late rendition of Drivers* Sheets is often responsible for
short payments, also prevents a proper and regular equalisation of
enginemen's time and delays the completion of statistics at the Statistical
Bureau,
As the time for making out their Daily Report Sheet is included
in the allowance for putting their engine away or, is allowed after relief,
Drivers must complete their sheet before handing it in to be signed off.
The officer who signs the men off duty at their home depot shall retain
the sheet.
At small depots where no Officer-in-Charge in stationed and in
cases where enginemen are away from their home depots for several days.
Drivers must forward their sheets each day, or as the train service permit
and must not wait until the end of the week or their return to the home
depot.
(A) Preliminary Examination and Preparation.
4- Setting the Engine for Examination and Oiling.
The best position to set a two cylinder engine for examination and
oiling is with both cranks down (i.e., the right crank on the bottom back
angle and the left crank on the bottom front angle) and the reversing gear
in centre except Walschaert's valve gear ( 1 36 *, *3B', *39* and *6o* classes)
in which the reversing gear is placed forward to enable the quadrant blocks
to be lubricated. The cylinder cocks will be open and the hand-brakes
applied. In this position the balance weights of the coupled wheels are
all above the centre of the axle leaving the boxes readily accessible for
oiling, whilst at the same time the springs and spring-pins, etc., can be
seen during the engine examination.
5- Examination of Engine and Tender.
The examination of the engine and tender must be made prior to
oiling; in the event of any mechanical attention being required, this can
be given and thus avoid the engine being late out from the loco depot.
The examination must be systematic and thorough.
1. First examine the smokebox, see that the apron plate, spark arrestors
and deflector plates are in position and secured by their respective
cotters, the arrestors and smokebox are free from ashes and other front
end details are in order. While at footplate level, examine the
compressor, see that the glands are tight, valve box covers secure and
that there are no loose nuts or bolts.


2* Next, commence at the leading end, on the left side and examine
every detail on that side of the engine and tender, paying particul-
ar attention to all moving parts, see that the gudgeon pin and big end
bolts are tight and safety cotters are in position; wedge blocks
are tight and secure; springs, spring-pins, spring-pin cotters are
in position and the latter properly opened so that they cannot fall
out; collar pins, collar studs and collar bolts tight; slide-bars
and bolts intact; brake blocks and hangers in good order; allowing
nothing to escape your notice. See that the intermediate wedge be-
tween the engine and tender is tight and properly pinned*
3* Returning from the rear, underneath the locomotive, examine all
pull rods and fulcrum bars of the brake gear on the engine and
tender; equalisers, links and compensators of the spring gear; ex-
amine the grease indicators on the axle boxes for thickness of
grease-blocks on *ss'» f s9* and *36* classes; on engines fitted with
the Allen or Stephenson valve gear, note that the lock-nuts are
tight on the eccentric strap bolts and there is just sufficient foom
behind the lock-nut to place the split pin without clearance* (Any
defect in this direction must be booked for mechanical attention)*
See that all tapered pins in the valve gear are tight and open-
ed at the tall end to prevent working out en-route, examine the
ashpan, firegrate and rocking bar equipment from beneath, also see
that the ashpan is free from ashes, that the ashpan cages are in
good order and in position to prevent the escape of ash or live fire
from the ashpan* finally, drain the main reservoir where this item
is underslung*
4* Having completed the examination underneath the engine, next ex-
amine the right side as previously mentioned and drain the main re-
servoirs, which are located outside of the locomotive frame*
6-2 Spare &auge Glasses.
All locomotives have now been fitted with a container suitably
located in the cab to carry spare gauge glasses and suitable packing
washers. The container on all classes of locomotives carries two (2)
spare gauge glasses of the correct length, together with four (4)
spare conical rubber washers with brass washers fitted*
The lid of the galvanised-iron box is to be secured in the closed
position by wire and lead seal which may be easily broken, when nec-
essary, to gain access to the spare glasses or washers*
Immediately after testing the water gauge columns to determine the
boiler water level, it will be the duty of the employee who is pre-
paring the engine to examine the wire and lead seal on the galvanised-
iron box to ensure that the latter is properly secured, as such a
condition will indicate that the contents are in order and complete*


Should it be found that the box is not correctly secured and
sealed, the matter is to be reported to the Officer-in-Charge, who will
arrange for the contents to be inspected, any deficiency made good and the
box resealed.
In each instance where it becomes necessary for the seal to be
broken, it will be the duty of the Driver on completion of the trip, or the
Shed Staff immediately after the occurrence, to report the circumstances to
the Supervising Officer for the prompt replacement of any missing items.
Where the engine is relayed, or enginemen are relieved en-route, the
relieving enginemen are to be informed of the occurrence and requested to
report such at the termination of the trip.
It is imperative that all concerned pay particular attention to
the aforementioned procedure as it is of the utmost importance that the
prescribed gauge glasses and washers be supplied and maintained.
7~2 Water Gauge - Glass Protectors.
If, when taking charge of an engine in the Locomotive Yard, a
Driver finds that the water gauge glass protectors are missing, or defective
he must at once report the matter to the Officer-in-Charge of the Shed. In
the absence of such report prior to the engine being taken out, the Driver
must accept personal responsibility for any accident that may result.
If protectors are not available an entiy is to be made in the
repair book by the Driver to that effect. Any Engineman discovered
removing the protectors, except when necessary for cleaning or to renew
gauge glasses, will render himself liable to disciplinary action.
Enginemen will be held responsible for the stabling of their
engines with the protectors in position, or booking them for attention when
such is necessary.
8-2 Inspection of Boilers Tubes and Spark Arrestors.
Bfefore leaving the Locomotive Yard, Drivers must, as far as
practicable, inspect boiler tubes from both smokebox and firebox ends,
making sure that they are clear and that no incrustation is forming on the
firebox tube plate; also that no leaks exist.
Brick arches should be examined, where possible, also spark
arrestors, to see that they are in perfect condition and free from ashes
or cinders.
Any defects detected in these items must be brought under the
notice of the Officer—in—Charge of the depot.

9-2, Booking Repairs,
Any defect which may be found during the examination of the
Locomotive must be promptly reported to the Mechanical Staff and an entry
made in the repair book provided, in the prescribed manner for the depot
at which the examination is being mads, so that the maximum time possible
before the schedule departure time of the locomotive will be available to
carry out the repairs required.
At each depot an inwards and outwards repair book is kept, in
which the stabling and preparing Drivers are required to enter, in indel-
able pencil or ink, a report on any defect that they may detect in the
component parts of the locomotive under their charge, which they consider
likely to effect the performance or safety of the locomotive.
When making a report in either book , the Driver, must enter in
the respective column, the date and time the booking is made, engine number
and his own signature. In the repair column the entries should be made one
to a line and numbered from the top as shown in the example below.
Drivers should always remember that the compiling of the
repair books is most necessary for the efficient functioning of a loco-
motive depot, as the controlling officers are provided with a means from
which they can determine the mechanical condition of any locomotive in
their district.
The Driver should also keep in mind that, although the mechanical
staff may consider that a particular fault which the driver has booked
does not warrant immediate attention, it is in the Drivers own interest
that he books any defect which he considers requires attention, as he will


then be covered in the event of the particular part failing during the time
he is in charge of the Locomotive,
Booking Axle Boxes. In order that there may be uniformity of identificat-
ion of engine and tender axle-boxes the following is laid down:-
Engine Boxes, Shall be known as No, 1,2, 3» 4, and so on, as the case
may be, on the left hand side, and similar numbers on the right-hand side,
counting No, 1 from the front of the engine. The numbers to be prefixed
with the letter "E" to indicate engine boxes, "R" or "L" to represent the
side of the locomotive (right or left side respectively).
Tender Boxes. Shall be known as No, 1,2, 3,4, on the left and right-
hand side, counting No,l from nearest the engine. The numbers to be pre-
fixed with the letter T* Indicating tender-boxes. "R" or "L" to represent
side of tender.
Example. The E.R, 3 would represent the third engine box from the front
on the right side. T.L, 3 would represent the third tender box from the
engine on the left side.
With regard to tank engines the axle-boxes would all be referred
to as engine-boxes. When reporting on tender-boxes etc,, it must be
distinctly stated whether the tender is of the bogie or 6 wheel type.
10-2, Oiling the Locomotive,
1. When commencing to oil a locomotive, the driver should first place a
small amount of oil in the top slide bar oil well, by so doing, he
ensures that the oil is clean and not contaminated with water or
other foreign matter,
2. In order to ensure that all engine axle boxes are properly lubricated,
the Driver must personally oil all axle box bearings on the locomotive,
3. Before placing oil in the oil cups and oil wells it should be noted
that the trimmings, or pin feed oilers, are in proper order. The oil
is to be distributed according to the mileage that the engine is
required to run. In no case should oil be above the level of the
syphon pipe, the cork should be inserted securely and care taken to
prevent it fouling up the syphon pipe. The axle-box lid lifter should
be used when oiling to avoid carrying dirt into the bearings, also to
avoid damage to feeder spouts. When oiling boxes it is essential to
see that the trimmings are properly inserted in the syphon pipe. The
first drop of oil is to be placed in the syphon pipe, over the trim-
ming to set the capillary attraction of the wool in motion and make
the trimmings syphon. It is necessary to be systematic during oiling,
as with examination of engines, to avoid missing essential parts.


if. Locomotives of the '36', ’ss' and. 's9* classes have coupled wheel
axle-boxes, grease lubricated. These axle-boxes are provided with
indicators to show the thickness of the grease block and when the
indicator is less than g in, from the journal, the Driver must book
the grease block for attention. *3s* class engines have this class
of lubrication on leaders and trailers only,
11- Tender Axle-Boxes.
Tender Axle-Boxes to be Oiled by Enginemen.
During preparation it is the Driver's duty to oil all tender
axle-boxes with top feeds. These boxes are on tenders attached to engines
of the following classesj-
'l9' Class and a number of 's3* and 'ss* class, with 4#ooo-gallon tenders.
Engines with tender axle-boxes oiled by the mechanical staff will
be allowed 5 lb. loco, oil less than scale allowances.
Tender Axle-Boxes to be Oiled by the Mechanical Staff, All tender axle-
boxes without top feeds are oiled by the mechanical staff as directed in
Chief Mechanical Engineer's Circular No. 10034 or 21.9.43# which includes
the foilowings-
A.R.A. type axle-boxes on tenders of *36* and a number of 's3'
and *ss* class; converted axle-boxes on tenders of 'l2', 'l3' and '3o'
class; all C. and W, type axle-boxes on tenders,
Enginemen are responsible for the examination of the quantity of
oil in these boxes and book them for oiling when such is required. The
maximum oil level to be carried in these boxes is \ inch below the set-
screw gauge provided in the filling hole.
12- '36'. '3s* and 's9* Class Bogie Axle-Boxes.
The '36', '3s* and 's9' class engines are fitted with
boxes which are lubricated by the underfeed system. These axle-boxes are
oiled by the mechanical staff at each depot where the engines are stabled.
Oil is supplied through a filling pipe in the keep to within g inch of the
top.
Enginemen are not required to oil these boxes in the course of
preparation, but they are expected to augment the supply when necessary
at stations where time is allowed for locomotive purposes. An oilway,
covered by a suitable lid, is provided for this purpose on top of the
axle-box, and extends into the oil keep.


13- Oiling the Little Ends.
When oiling little ends, the plug trimming must be withdrawn and
a small amount of oil allowed to enter the syphon pipe and the trimming is
then used to pump the lubrication through. Generally speaking, there are
more bookings to little ends than any other individual bearing on a loco-
motive, due to lack of this attention. The gudgeon-pin is the smallest
bearing on a locomotive and with the 'so', 's3' and 'ss* classes, the
thrust on this pin as the pistons pass dead centre, with the engine deep in
gear on a grade, is 27 tons at full boiler pressure.
Grease Lubricated Little Ends. *3B’ class locomotives have little ends of
the spherical design consisting of a steel ball or sphere, mounted on a
gudgeon-pin, and a split bush to suit, pressed onto the connecting rod.
Close observance should be made to determine that bushes are tight in
connecting rods. Loose bushes are not permitted to continue in service.
Little ends are lubricated by means of a pressure grease gun and at each
stabling it is the duty of mechanics to re-grease little ends.
The little ends on the ’6o' class locomotive are fitted with a
bronze bush which is grease lubricated by the mechanical staff.
14- Oiling of Quadrant Blocks.
The Driver shall pay special attention to the lubrication of
quadrant blocks of engines fitted with Walschaert’s valve gear, as the
natural slip in the link creates friction at high speed.
!5~2 Pin Oilers in Big end and Coupling Rod Oil Cups.
The big end and coupling rod oil cups of '3o', 's2', 'ss', 's6'
•38', 'so', '55' t 'ss* and *39 1 class engines are fitted with pin oilers *
instead of worsted plug trimmings. The pins function with a vertical
movement, due to the rotation of the parts, and pump the oil through the
oilways to the bearings. It is essential that the oil cup is not filled
beyond the top of the oilway as overfilling restricts the functioning of
the pin.
In the event of the Driver, during the preparation of the engine,
finding that the pin has not functioned properly, either causing insuffi-
cient or excessive use of oil, he must book it for attention. When a
mechanic is available, the Driver must not remove the oil cup cover for the
purpose of examination, but when no mechanic is available he may do so.

class. See
Note A and B,
Should it be found that the pin oiler is not functioning or a bearing
has overheated en-route due to lack of oil, the bearing should be pumped in
the following manner
Remove the oil cup by means of the screw wrench, remove the pin, then
fill the oil cup over the oilway, replace the cover with the cork securely
inserted and screw down quickly, the air thus locked in the oil cup will
compress and force the oil through the oilway to the bearing, this operation
is to be repeated if necessary. The pin is then to be replaced and the oil
cup should not be filled beyond the top of the oilway. Replace the cover
securely.
The big end of the connecting rod and the driving coupling rod on a
'6o* class locomotive are fitted with S.K.F. self-aligning Roller Bearings.
?ixed lead bronze bushes are fitted to the remaining coupling rod bearings.
All coupling rod and big end bearings are grease lubricated,
16-2 Oil Allowances for Locomotives.


NOTE.
(A) * so's3* and 'ss' classes will be allowed l£ lb. of
cylinder oil working from Harden to Ooulbum, and Dubbo
to Orange via Molong.
(B) 'so', *s3' and *ss* classes working coal trains in the
Newcastle District will be allowed £ lb. Loco, oil per
100 miles less than scale allowance,
(C) f 36' Class working Through Services, Orange-Sydney or
Sydney-Orange, will be allowed lb, of cylinder oil for
the working in each direction, *36* class working
Through Services between Dubbo-Sydney or Sydney-Dubbo
will be allowed 3jt It, of cylinder oil for working
in each direction,
(D) Allowances for Short Trips - The allowance for 50 miles
and under is only to apply where a locomotive is to run
one short trip but where a 50-mile trip is to be worked
and the locomotive will be in service for more than five
hours the 70 miles allowance is to apply,
(E) Allowances for Excess of 100 Miles - When a locomotive
runs over 100 miles, the allowance will be the 100 miles
allowance plus a fractional quantity for the miles in
excess of 100, For example, when a locomotive which
is allowed 4 lb. per 100 miles runs 106 miles, lb,
is the allowance for the trip,
(?) Allowances for Loeomotives Working Pick-up Trains -
Locomotives working Pick-up trains will be allowed
the 100 miles allowance for 10 hours working, and
where the journey time exceeds that period, a further
fractional allowance will be made hourly on that
basis. For instance, a »53' class working a Pick-up
train for 10 hours would be allowed lb. Loco, and
lb» cylinder oil. If 12 hours are occupied on the
journey the allowance would be lb. Loco, and l£ lb,
cylinder oil.
Engine prepared by Shed Staff.
When a locomotive is prepared for a driver by another driver
or shed staff the full allowance of loco, bearing oil for the trip is not
to be supplied to the locomotive during the preparation, but i lb, of the
100 miles allowance is to be left for the use of the driver who works the
locomotive.


The amount of loco, bearing oil to be used during preparation of
locomotives engaged on through running, will be in accordance with the
instructions obtaining within various districts.
The lubricator is to be charged with the allowance of cylinder
oil for the through journey.
17- , Pilot Locomotives.
After locomotives have been prepared to stand pilot and addition-
al £ lb, of loco, oil for eaoh four (4) hours the Locomotive is standing
may be allowed, this is for wastage at the axle-boxes where such have been
oiled.
18- Oiling of Regular Shunting Engines.
Regular shunting engines which are not required to run distances
of over 20 miles on the main line are to have the bearings lubricated with
carriage and wagon axle oil,
19- , Starting the Hydrostatio Lubricator.
The fireman will fill and turn on the steam supply to the
lubricator as explained in Part 1, Section 1-3, Page 13 of this book. The
driver is responsible for seeing that the lubricator is filled and
working correctly before departing from the locomotive depot, also the
rate of feed from the feed nozzles must be checked regularly en route
to ensure that it does not vary when steaming heavy or when drifting;
this condition oan be brought about by a choke valve being badly worn
destroying the balance of pressure on the lubricator. The rate of
feed for the various classes of locomotives is given under locomotive
engine driving. Section 3 of this book.
The lubricator should always be started at least fifteen minutes
before leaving the depot, and should not be shut off until the engine is
on the examination pit at the termination of the day's run,
20- Gleaning out the Hydrostatic Lubricator.
When a lubricator has exhausted the oil supply, it is in a
ideal condition not only to give the oil reservoir but all passages a
thorough cleaning out with the hot water it contains.


First. Leave the lubricator set just as it is at the moment the oil
ceases to flow and open all the drain valves below the glasses.
This will very much lessen the pressure within the sight-feed
chamber and at the same time allow the hot water to flow from
the feed nozzle tips to the atmosphere. When the water ceases
to flow from the feed nozzles, close the regulating valves, as
this indicates that the water in the condenser is exhausted.
Second, Blow out the oil reservoir through the drain valve, after which
all valves are to be closed, and the lubricator can then be filled
and again put into operation.
21- The Error of Mixing Oils.
The practice of mixing cylinder oil with engine or other oil is
absolutely wrong. Only the correct grade of cylinder oil has the requisite
lubrication qualities and must be used in the hydrostatic lubricator.
NOTE: Injury has occurred to enginemen owing to an explosion occurring
while the lubricator was being filled. It was obvious that
kerosene was mixed with the cylinder oil. This practice, being
dangerous, is prohibited,
22- The Nathan Mechanical Lubricator.
*36*, '3B*, 's9* and '6o' class locomotives are now fitted with
Nathan Mechanical Lubricators which deliver oil to the cylinders, steam
chests, compressor, axle-box hub faces and slide bars, and on * 3B * and ’6o*
class engines they also provide lubrication to the axle-box horn check
plates.
The lubricator is actuated from a crank arm attached to the
quadrant link trunnion on *36’, *3B' and '6o* class engines. On *s9* class
locomotives this crank arm is attached to the combination lever.
Inside the oil reservoir there is a number of pump units, one to
each feed outlet, which is connected by piping to its respective delivery
point,
The oil delivery pipes from the lubricator are connected to
terminal check valves which are set to operate at a pressure considerably
higher than boiler pressure.
Steam nozzles with l/l6" diameter choke are located in the check
valve outlets (except to compressor) and steam issuing therefrom, mingles
with and atomises the oil forcing it through the check valves and delivering
it to the respective points to be lubricated. The steam is supplied by a
branch pipe from the steam pipe leading to the compressor on all classes of


locomotives except the f 6o' class, where it is taken off the main steam
pipes to the steam chests.
The lubricator is filled and adjusted by the mechanical staff,
but during the preparation and stabling of the engine, the Driver must
examine tne driving mechanism to ensure it being in order, examine the
oil level, which should not be less than 8 pints, also examine the oil
pipes for leakage and see the lubricator heating system is functioning.
The compressor steam valve must be fully opened before leaving
the depot and remain open whilst the engine is in service.
The Fireman shall rotate the ratchet handle on the lubricator
at least 12 turns to ensure the oil pipes being full and ready for
delivery immediately the engine is moved.
23-2 Damage to Locomotive Parts.
Notwithstanding instructions issued to the staff regarding the
inexcusable damage to lubricator filling plugs, side-rod oil cup covers
and other locomotive details by reason of employees using unsuitable tools
for their removal, numerous cases of serious damage occasioned by use of
chisels in removing lubricator filling plugs, bushes, side-rod oil cup
covers and other parts of locomotives occur.
There is no justification for the damage mentioned herein, as
enginemen, mechanics and Shed Staff are supplied with suitable spanners
and wrenches, which are best suited for the removal of the parts under
review,
Enginemen on taking charge of locomotives will be held responsible
for bringing under notice all cases of damage to any of the abovementioned
details.
To prevent damage to the coupling heads, engine hosepipes, when
not in use, must be attached to the dummy couplers.
When it becomes necessary for any reason to disconnect the
intermediate air hose between an engine and tender, the end of the air hose
must be securely fastened clear of the ground.
Tank Lids of Engine Tenders and Bunker Type to be Properly Closed.
The attention of enginemen is specially drawn to the necessity
for immediately and properly replacing the lids provided for the filling
holes of the tenders after they have been removed for any purpose.


This will prevent grit or other foreign matter getting into the tanka
and obviate the riak of injury which the abßence of the tank lida ia
likely to oocaaion to an employee, whoae duty may at any time require
him to proceed to the back of the engine tender.
Thla inatruotion will not apply when taking water in the
electrified area, where it ia neceaaary for employeea to take every
precaution to guard againat contact with overhead electric wlrea.
In caaea where the engine ia required to take water in
the electrified area, the tender tank lid may be left in the open
poaltien.
Enginemen working Bunker Engines muat see that the tank
lida are securely screwed down each time a supply of water haa been
taken and also exercise every care when stopping the train at stations
to prevent water splashing from the engine tank to the platform, this
will prevent inconvenience to the travelling public, Enginemen muat
also see that the leather washer under the tank lid la maintained in
good order.
25- , Strainers not to be removed from Pilling Holes of Tanka or
Injeotors Feed Pipes.
These strainers (which are fitted to Bunker type engines,)
are for the purpose of preventing coal and other foreign matter entering
the tanks when water is being taken and must be retained in proper
position when the tank is being filled.
The screens or strainers must not be removed from the
injector feed pipes or strum boxes where provided, except for cleaning
purposes, after which they must be replaced, A number of failures
have occurred through strainers being removed, allowing foreign matter
to enter the injeotors and prevent them from working properly,
26- Ash-pan Flushers.
The 36, 38 and 60 class engines are fitted with a special
type of ash-pan flusher; the pipe leading to the ash-pan being
connected to the delivery pipe of the injector.
To operate. The injector to the boiler is to be started in the usual
way., and the handle, which is housed in the cab footboard under the
Driver, or fireman, lifted on to the rack; this opens a valve on the
branch pipe to the ash-pan flusher and diverts the water from the
injector delivery pipe to the ash-pan.


the ash-pan flusher valve is closed the handle lies in its housing
in the oah footboard. The Driver is required to inspect the operating
handle and see that it is down and that water is not flowing into the
Ash-pan when the injector is operating,
27-2, Fractured cylinder Covers and Cross Heads Damaged.
Recurring cases of fractured cylinder covers, loose pistons
and crossheads on superheated locomotives, definitely traceable to
heavy pounding thrusts, caused by water being trapped in the cylinder
ends, call for sustained effort by all concerned in order to entirely
avoid such damage.
Investigations and pressure records taken, clearly show
that the damage occurs when locomotives leave the shed en route to the
station, or when leaving the station attached to a train at the
commencement of the journey, or having stood at a station for some
considerable time, or after having drifted down a long grade and the
superheater elements and cylinders have cooled down. This may also
be caused to some extent when moving locomotives about the depots
low in stoam, or with the boiler high in water and the cylinder drain
valves closed.
The indications are that water has accumulated in the
superheater elements and it is only when the regulator is well open
to apply the necessaxy power to lift the train, or when steaming
heavily, that the vclume and pressure of steam displaces the water
from the elements. This particularly applies to locomotives with
super-imposed steam chests which permit of this water being emptied
into the cylinder ends.
It will, therefore, be necessary for 1 concerned to
exercise every precaution possible to prevent future damage in the
direction indicated, and for the instructions outlined hereinafter
to be strictly observed by all concerned.
Instructions to Shed Staff.
V 3 j Tne shunting of 36, 38, 59 and 60 olass locomotives about the
depots low in steam pressure should be avoided as far as
practicable. In addition, these locomotives must not be
allowed to remain on the ashpits any longer than is necessary
to effectively deal with them, but must be stabled in the
shed as speedily as possible, after the pit work has been
completed. This particularly applies to Eveleigh Depot,
where, when the circumstances permit, the incoming enginemen
must take the locomotive from the ashpit and stable it in
the shed.


(ii) High rater level In locomotive boilers is detrimental to
economical working and to the welfare of locomotives. This
is responsible for reduced superheater temperature,
defective lubrication and extravagance in coal consumption.
There is no necessity for water to be carried higher than
half a glass, when locomotives are stabled in a depot, or
when leaving a depot preparatory to working a train, it is
only on the steeper grades that high levels are justified
in accordance with the instructions Issued,
The practice of the Staff in the Running Shed to overfill
the boilers of locomotives stabled therein preparatory to
working trains and also for englnemen to operate the loco-
motives on the road with unnecessary high water levels in
the boilers must be avoided.
Boilers that have been overfilled contrary to the instructions
herein must have the water levels reduced before leaving
the shed,
(Exception,- Where locomotives are stabled at out-depots
with no one in charge, the boilers are to be filled to
three parts of a glass of water,)
(iii) In those cases where locomotives have been washed out,
or the boilers emptied for repairs, etc,, the boilers
must not be filled in excess of half a glass of water,
(iv) Every opportunity must be taken by the Shed Staff to
displace water from the elements of locomotives that
have been held up under repairs, or that have been washed
out. This is to be done when a good pressure of steam has
been raised in the boiler by blowing out the superheater
elements and cylinders,
28-2, Prevention of water hammer in the cylinders.
1. Before leaving locomotive depots action must be taken, when
a good pressure of steam has been raised in the boiler, to
displace water from the elements and cylinders by observing
the instructions outlined hereinafter:—
(a) Make sure that the cylinder cooks are open,
(b) Properly secure the locomotive by the application of
the air and hand brakes and place the engine in centre gear.


(o) Open the regulator fully for approximately five (5)
seconds and then close it for five (5) seconds,
repeat this operation three times,
(d) Then close the regulator and move the reversing gear
into full forward and full backward positions so
that all water may drain away from the cylinder and
steam chest cooks.
Any desired movement of the locomotive afterwards must be
carried out very slowly, so as to allow sufficient time for all the
water to be discharged through tl yo cylinder cocks,
2, The cylinder cooks must be fully opened when moving the loco-
motive from the shed, and kept open, except where safety
precautions necessitate them being closed for a limited period,
until the locomotive arrives on, and is attached to the train,
3, After the locomotive has been coupled to the train and with the
boiler at full pressure, the procedure outlined in (l) hereof
is to be repeated.
4, The cylinder cooks are to be left open after the train has started
and are to be kept open until the locomotive has travelled at
least a trains length from the platform consistent with safety,
5, Close attention must be given to the standing instructions
regarding water levels which direct that not more than half a
glass of water is to be carried in boilers when locomotives
are stabled in steam, or when leaving depots preparatory to
working trains, this applies to all loocmotlves (except those
stabled at out-depots where no employee is in charge, in
which case the boiler is to be filled to three parts of a
glass of water). High water levels carried in locomotive boilers,
particularly superheated locomotives when on the read, are
detrimental to efficient lubrication, economical coal consumption,
and cause considerable expenditure in maintenance through the
water being carried over into the steam pipe, thence to the
elements, and then deposited in volume In the cylinders, causing
severe pressure shook on the piston heads. Any boilers that
have been overfilled contrary to the instructions herein, must
have the water levels reduced before leaving the depot.


6, Enginemen must exercise special care to avoid the operation of
locomotives on the road with unnecessary high water levels in boilers,
especially when coasting down falling grades and running into stations
and so prevent any possibility of water getting into the superheater
elements, when the brakes are applied with the pilot valve in the open
position.
7* Every opportunity must be taken when locomotives are standing at
stations, to open the cylinder cocks in order that water, which may
have accumulated in the cylinders, can be discharged.
District Locomotive Engineers and Running Inspectors must
see that enginemen and others carry out these instructions in their
entirety,
29-2 Automatic Water Release Valves Fitted to Cylinders.
These valves are suitably located and are connected by pipes
to the bottom of the cylinder covers at each end of the cylinder.
In all cases there is an emergency shut-off valve fitted
where each pipe connects to the cylinder cover, this to be used in the
event of a release valve or pipe joint becoming defective. The shut-off
valve is operated by a screwed spindle with a squared end and when fully
opened, this spindle is screwed out to its fullest extent. In addition, a
small hole is drilled through the screwed spindle with a seal arranged so
that it must be broken if the shut-off valve has been closed, this must be
checked by the driver during preparation.
The shut-off valve must not be interfered with, but must be
left open, unless a defect in the system requires that it shall be closed
in order that the steam may be shut off from the pipe and release valve.
When this is necessary, the screwed spindle must be screwed in by means of
the squared end as far as it will go. In cases where the emergency shut-
off valve has been closed. Drivers must book same, giving the reasons,
after stabling the engine.
The release valves are provided to clear the water from the
cylinders when the regulator has been opened to move the engine and the
latter is cold. When water and steam are discharged on the footplate from
these valves, as may happen when starting, it indicates that water is
collecting in the cylinders, and although the valves will eject the water.
Drivers should, under the circumstances, as an additional precaution, again
open the cylinder cocks if they have prematurely closed them.


If release valves open when water Is not present, as, for
instance, when it is known that there can be no water because the
engine is thoroughly hot and no water is being carried over from the
boiler, this indicates that the valve is probably defective. If
such a defect exists, it is likely to show up when the engine is on a
long and heavy continuous pull. If a valve opens frequently under
these conditions, the emergency shut-off valve should be closed to
isolate it, but otherwise, it can be takoi that the opening of the
release valves is due to water in the cylinder and in such oases it
should, under no circumstances, be put out of action,
30-2, Cylinder and Steam Chest Drain Valves,
The cylinder and steam chest drain valves of a locomotive
are of the simple mushroom type and are fitted to the lowest part of
the cylinders to allow the water formed by condensed steam to drain
out of the cylinders. All locomotive cylinders, are fitted with two
such valves, one at each end of the cylinder and in addition locomotives
equipped with piston valves have an additional one connected to the
steam chest,
(a) Manually Operated Cylinder Drain Valves,
On locomotives fitted with manually operated drain valve,
the push rod is operated by a handle in the cab, through a set of
levers and coupling rods, in order that the valves will function
correctly it is essential that the rigging has a minimum of lost motion.
Drivers should pay particular attention to this feature,
during their examination of the locomotive, as, locomotives fitted with
manually operated cylinder and steam chest drain valves, are not fitted
with any other protective devices such as Automatic Water Release
Valves to clear the water from the cylinders.
(b) Air Operated Cylinder Drain Valves.
The cylinder drain valves of 36, 38 and 60 class engines
are operated by compressed air from the main reservoir through a Drivers
control valve, from where an air pipe is connected to a small air
cylinder at the rear of each set of cylinder drain cooks, as shown
in the Illustration,
The control valve has two positions, viz
1, With the handle in the forward position air is admitted from the
main reservoir to the air cylinders B, thus closing the drain valves.
2, When the handle is in backward position the air from the main
reservoir is shut off and air pressure in the cylinder B, released
to the atmosphere through a release port in the control cook. The
drain valves are then in the open position.


The normal position of the drain valves is "open", being
held in that position by spiral spring C. To close the drain valves,
air pressure is admitted at A, to cylinder B, forcing the air piston
through its stroke and compressing spring 0, to which is attached
crosshead D and valve rods F, allowing the drain valves to seat.
AIR OPERATED CYLINDER DRAIN VALVES.
Should the air pipe between the main reservoir and control
cook break, it ia necessary to blank the connection on the main reservoir
and remove connection pin E, and cook rods F.
In the event of the air pipe breaking between the control
valve and air cylinder B, place the control cook handle in the backward
position and remove connecting pin E and cock rods P as in the previous
instance,
(°) Steam Operated "Okadee" Cylinder Drain Valves.
The "Okadee" steam operated cylinder and steam chest drain
y ves, fitted to "D 59" and some "036" class locomotives, are designed
to serve both as drain valves and water release valves.
The drain valves are closed by admitting boiler steam
pressure to a steam piston and are opened by spring pressure in the
following manner:-


Closed Position.
To close the drain valve the control valve must befUlly
opened, so that the top seat of the control valve will close the exhaust
port in the body of the valve. Boiler steam is then permitted to pass
to each drain valve, where it exerts constant boiler pressure on the
back face of the piston. The force exerted then causes the piston to
move to the left and closes the outlet port from the cylinders and at
the same time compressing the return spring,
Failure to fully open the control valve will result in a
strong blow of steam at the outlet of the exhaust port pipe.
Open Position.
To open the drain valves the control valve has to be closed
firmly, so that the steam supply from the boiler to the drain valves will
be stopped, at the same time the exhaust port in the body of the control
valve will be opened to allow the remaining steam in the connecting
pipes and drain valves to escape to the atmosphere, the compressed
return spring then exerts a pressure on the piston causing it to move
to the right and open the outlet port to the cylinders and steam chest.
Failure to firmly close the control valve may result in a
sufficient volume of steam leaking past the control valve seat to cause
the pistons to close the outlet port from the cylinders and if the main
regulator is leaking the locomotive may move.
Should an excessive blow of steam be observed at the end
of the exhaust port pipe, with the control valve in either the open
or closed position the respective valve seat should be booked for
attention.
An emergency shut off valve is provided on each drain valve
and in the event of a drain valve failing to close in service the piston
may be secured in the closed position by screwing in the emergency set
screw in the back of the valve casting,
31-2 Reversing Screw Brackets Damaged,
Special care must be exercised by Drivers to avoid damage
to the cast-iron bracket which carries the reversing screw,- The damage
which occurs is due to faulty manipulation on the part of enginemen,
either by carelessly jamming the reversing screw nut hard up against the
end of the bracket when reversing, or allowing the nut to run free and
so come into violent contact with it.


32-2 Drivers Tool Boxes, oil cans, etc., not to be carried on the
Footplate,
Drivers tool boxes, oil cans, etc., must not be carried on
the outside footplates, but should be accommodated inside the cab. The
sundry boxes must be carried in such a position as will preclude the
possibility of water gaining access thereto and causing damage to the
equipment,
33~2 Turbo-generators for Electric Lights.
Starting.
Before starting the turbo-generator, care should be exercised
to open the steam valve slightly for a few seconds, to warm the turbine
and clear out any water that may have accumulated. The turbine should
then start easily providing the steam pressure is satisfactory.
Short Circuit,
Should a short circuit, which is indicated by the braking
effect on the turbine, develop in traffic. Drivers should disconnect
the flexible conduit drops to the various cab units. Should the fault
be in one of these units, the turbine will immediately run at the usual
speed and the balance of the lighting will become normal. The defective
unit must not be reconnected until after overhaul.
Unnecessary Use of Turbine.
Having regard to the waste of coal and avoidable wear and
tear on the electric lighting apparatus, enginemen and other staff
concerned must avoid, as far as practicable, the running of the turbine
during daylight.
Spare Lamp globe.
Engines fitted with electric lights working on unfenced
lines and other branch lines specified, will be supplied with a spare
head lamp globe which must be carried in the back of head lamp case.
The spare globe must be 3eft in the carton in which it is supplied to
protect it from damage. Should it be found necessary to utilise the
spare globe, the Driver concerned must report the occurrence and submit
the defective globe to the Officer-in-Charge of the depot to which he is
attached.
A spare globe will not be provided on engines equipped with
two headlamps.


Damage to Connections, etc.
In order to avoid damage to the plugs of the connections
between engine and tender, due to the plugs becoming withdrawn from
the sockets and dragging on the track, care should be exercised to see
that the securing rings on the connections are screwed on tightly,
Electric Marker Lights,
In addition to the large electric light headlamp a number
of engines are fitted with electric marker light lamps to the engine and
tender for the purpose of providing white or read head and tail marker
lights, as required, in connection with train signalling; removable or
reversible red shades being part of the marker lamp equipment.
When the train signalling regulations require a white
marker light under the engine flannel the dim light is to be exhibited in
the large electric headlamp for that purpose.
When the turbo-generator is started the wiring to the
marker light lamps is energised, the lights are then controlled by a
switch fitted to each lamp, Enginemen must assure themselves that the
switches and red shades are in the correct position to provide the
proper train signals as required.
When the lamp case doors of marker lights are opened for
any purpose, care must be exercised to avoid damage to the hinges of the
doors.
Attention to Defective Electric Headlight Equipment on
Engines within the Electrified Area.
1, The Staff is hereby directed that in the event of the electric
headlight equipment on any engine becoming defective no attempt
must be made under any circumstances to examine or repair the
equipment, other than such parts that are installed wholly within
the engine cab, whilst the engine concerned is working or
standing on any line or aiding, wired or unwired, within the area
bounded by Gosford on the North, Bowenfels on the West, Liverpool
on the South, Sutherland, The National Park and Cronulla on the
South Coast, also Bankstown and East Hills Lines,
2, The undermentioned places only are exempted from the provisions of
clause 1, viz:-
Eveleigh and Chullora Locomotive Workshops and all Steam
Running Sheds - Inside Loco, points.


3. When, in accordance with the provisions of clause 1, defective
parts of an engine electric headlight equipment cannot be examined
and repaired, the engine concerned shall continue to work without
such parts in use, and the Driver in charge shall report the
defect to the Chargeman immediately upon arrival at the shed where
his shift terminates.
34-2. Testing of Safety Valves.
, . When the Fireman has raised a full head of steam the Driver
should note that the pressure at which the safety valves lift is in
accordance with the scale set out on page 30/1-2 of Part 1,
Should it be found that a safety valve is lifting at 3 lb,
or more below the registered pressure, for the locomotive boiler concerned,
the valve must be booked for attention and if it is found, that it is
no possible to correct the settings before departure time, arrangements
should be made with the Chargeman to have the load of the train to be
hauled, reduced by 4 per cent, for every 5 lb. loss of boiler pressure
in accordance with Regulation No, 6, Page 12 of the Engine Loads General
Instructions Book,
, A note should also be made of the px-essure at which the
PoP valves reseat, as this feature ifallowed to exceed 5 lb, per sq
f -^ nCe + u S lik ! ly t 0 oause in negotiating ruling grades,
through either the waste of coal and water, or loss of boiler pressure,
should the safety valve lift at a critical part of the journey and refuse
to reseat until the boiler pressure is substantially reduced.
35-2, Testing of Westinghouse Air Brake Equipment.
Lubricating the compressor.
Release 10 drops of oil quickly from the Sight Peed
Lubricator prior to starting the Compressor, then adjust the feed to one
W drop per minute, with all types of Simple Compressors.
With compound Compressors the rate of feed is two (2) droos
of oil per minute to each cylinder.
When standing in sidings for crossing or other purpose,
see that the Control Valve of the Sight Feed Lubricator is kept in the
correct position for the lubrication of the Compressor during such time.


Air End.
The air end is lubricated by an Automatic Lubricator attached
thereto, this ensures a constant supply of oil whenever the compressor is
working. Should enginemen or others find that the lubricator is not
using oil, the attention of the Mechanical Staff should be immediately
directed to same, as the small holes and passages in the lubricator or
nipple in the air cylinder may be blocked.
With simple Compressors the automatic lubricator is filled by
the Fireman during engine preparation; a special oil being supplied for
this purpose.
The automatic lubricator on Compound Compressors is filled
with special oil and thisduty is performed by the Mechanical Staff, but
should Drivers find that the supply is depleted when on the road, then
Super. Cylinder Oil may be used to replenish the supply and the matter
booked for attention on’stabling the locomotive at the depot.
Normally the Automatic Lubricator will lubricate a Compressor
for from eight hours to ten hours without further attention,
36- , Starting the Compressor.
When starting a Compressor from cold,and the Main Reservoir
empty, the joint of the Steam Supply Valve must only be partly opened, to
ensure the Compressor works very slowly until the Main Reservoir
pressure is not less than 40 lbs. (This is to prevent pounding and
consequent damage, owing to condensation in the steam cylinder and lack
of compression in the air cylinder, to cushion the pistons at the
termination of the piston stroke.) When 40 lb. Main reservoir pressure
has been attained, open the steam valve fully and leave in this position
until the termination of trip. See that all joints are tight and valve
box covers secure also that the compressor works normally before leaving
the Shed,
37- . Testing the Governor.
Observe that the Compressor stops when the Red Hand of the
Duplex Gauge registers 100 lb,, whilst the Governor has the steam supply
shut off to the Compressor, the Driver should place his hand over the
Vent Port Nipple of the Governor to ensure that there is a free flow of
air escaping therefrom, otherwise the Compressor will not readily start
when the Main Reservoir Pressure falls. The outting-ln point of the
Governor when the Compressor re-starts should not be more than two and a
half (2-g-) lb, below the governor setting.


38- Testing the Duplex Air Gauge.
Brake Valve Handle - Full Release Position. With the Brake Valve handle
in full release position, when the compressor is started, both hands of
the Duplex Grange must rise together and the two hands must agree within
2-f lb. This ensures that the gauge is in good order, isolating cocks
open and all passages clear,
39- Testing the Drivers No. 4 Brake Valve.
1, Lap position. Start the compressor with the brake valve handle in
the full release position; when the pressure attains 40 lbs, in
the Main Reservoir, place the Brake Valve Handle in the Lap Position
and fully open the Steam Valve of Compressor. In this position the
Black Hand of the Gauge should remain stationary, whilst the Red
Hand continues to rise to 100 lb. Main Reservoir pressure. This
ensures that the Rotary Valve is not leaking, should the Black Hand
(brake pipe) continue to rise, the Rotary Valve is leaking through
and requires attention,
2. Running Position. Move the handle of the Brake Valve to the release
position for one (l) second and then to the running position.
Observe the Duplex pressure gauge and provided that the Main
Reservoir is fully charged., the brake pipe pressure should rise
and remain stationary at the set pressure of the slide valve feed
valve, which should be ?0 lbs. p.s.i. This indicates that the
ports and passages are clear through the slide valve feed valve and
equalising port is clear. Care must be taken to ensure that the
slide valve feed valve is set in accordance with the regulations,
which is 70 lbs p,s*i, inside loco points at all times,
5. Service Application Position. Place the index finger of the right
hand over the brake pipe exhaust port, then note, the pressure on
the Black Hand of the Gauge and make not more than a 5 lb, reduction
with the brake valve in the service application position, returning
the handle to lap. Note that the preliminary blow takes place at
the back of the Brake Valve indicating that the preliminary port and
connecting groove are clear.
If the finger is blown off the brake pipe exhaust port, the Equalising
Piston is in good order, if the fingsr is not moved by the air
pressure from the exhaust port, the Equalising Piston is blowing
through.


4» Emergency Position. Place the brake valve handle in the emergency
position and note that there is a free flow of air from the
emergency passage at the back of the brake valve and also that the
Black Hand (brake pipe) of the gauge falls slowly to zero. This
indicates that the large cavity is making direct passage.
On engines fitted with a non-automatic brake on the engine and
tender, the opportunity may be taken during this test of noting
whether, with the non-automatic brake valve in "Pull Release' 1
position, there is any blow of air at the non-automatic brake valve
exhaust, (if there is, it denotes leakage of either the engine or
tender double check valve.)
Whilst the brake valve handle is in this position, examine the
engine and tender brakes, to see that the triples are correctly
functioning, this is indicated by both brakes being applied and
also shows that the branch pipe isolating cocks are fully open.
Also check onr-
(1) The brake piston travel to see that it is not excessive
(2) The thickness of the brake blocks
5. Full Release Position. The black hand should rise quickly to the
same pressure as that registering on the red hand of the gauge.
This will indicate that the equalising ports and passages are clear,
NOTE: A variation of lbs. between the red and black hands of the
gauge is allowed.
40-2 Testing for Leakage.
place the drivers brake valve handle in the full release
position, then with the main reservoir and brake pipe fully charged to
100 lbs. p.s.i. pressure, close the drivers brake valve isolating cock
and shut off the compressor. Should the red hand fall, there is a leak
between the Discharge Valve of the compressor and the relative connections
leading to the isolating cock, through the main reservoir. If the black
hand falls it indicates leakage on the brake valve, equalising reservoir
or brake pipe connections. Should the black hand fall when making the
above test, the brake valve handle should then be placed in lap and if the
leakage is in the equalising reservoir or its connections, this is
immediately indicated by the lifting of the equalising piston.


41- Testing the Slide Valve Feed Valve.
1, After testing the rotary valve to ensure that it is tight, the
setting or cutting-out pressure of the slide valve feed valve
should be determined by placing the brake valve handle in the
running position and noting the pressure to which the brake pipe
hand of the duplex gauge rises,
2, The brake valve handle should then be placed in full release
position to charge the brake pipe to maximum pressure, which should
be the same as that indicated by the main reservoir hand of the
gauge,
3, The cutting in pressure of the slide valve feed valve is now checked
by placing the brake valve handle in the running position and
having the fireman make a brake pipe leak by slightly opening
the brake pipe cook on the back of the tender. At the same time
the Driver should note the movement of the brake pipe hand of
the gauge, which should fall to the same pressure as that noted
in (l) and then remain steady, indicating that the slide valve
feed valve has cut-in and is feeding air into the brake pipe,
A permissable variation of 2lb. between the cutting-in and
cutting-out pressures on the gauge is allowed.
Note. The slide valve feed valve should be set at sq; ins. Inside
Loco, points,
42- Testing the Non-Automatlo Brake.
On locomotives fitted with a Non-Autcmatic brake for the
operation of the engine and tender brakes only, the following tests of
the equipment should be made,
1, Make sure that the tender isolating cock on the non-automatic
air line is open,and the automatic brake valve handle in either
the "Running" or "Full Release" position,
2, Now test the pressure reducing valve setting by placing the
non-automatlo brake handle in the "Pull Application" position*
The hand of the brake cylinder gauge should then rise and show
a pressure of 45 p#s,i. If a different pressure is shown the
pressure reducing valve is not set correctly,
3, At the same time a check should be made that there is no blow
from the brake cylinder safety valve, which should be set at
50 p.s.i.


4. Notice should also he taken that there is no blow from either the
engine or tender triple valve exhausts, as this is a sign that the
double check valve attached to the triple valve is blowing through.
5. A check of the brake cylinder safety valve setting should now be made
by making a full service application of the automatic brake, which
should cause the safety valve to lift, and that it blows the pressure
back to 50 p.s.i,, at which pressure it should reseat,
6. Finally a leakage test should be made by first releasing both brakes
and then re-applying the non-automatic brake fully after which the
handle must be placed in the lap or holding position and a note made
of any movement of the brake cylinder air gauge. If the hand drops
rapidly there is a leakage, either at the engine or tender brake
cylinder leathers or in the air pipe connections between the brake
valve and the brake cylinders, or in the double check valves as
mentioned in (4),
NOTE; Should it be found that the safety valve is set heavy it is
essential that it be set correctly before the locomotive is taken
out of the depot as failure to do so, will invariably result in
skidded wheels on the locomotive,
45-2 Testing the A— 6.E.T, Brake Equipment.
Testing the A-6.E.T. Brake Valves.
Before starting the compressor, place the automatic brake
valve handle in the lap position and independent brake valve in running
position. Start the compressor working slowly until a pressure of
40 p.s.i, is raised in the main reservoir, this will prevent damage to the
compressor through water hammer, then turn the compressor starting valve
on fully.
As the pressure in the main reservoir increases the black
hand of both duplex gauges should remain at zero, whilst the automatic
brake valve handle is in the lap position, indicating the rotary valve is
tight and is not blowing through,
44-2 Equalising Reservoir Control Valve Test.
When the main reservoir pressure reached 90 p.s.i., place the
automatic brake valve handle in the running position and note that the
black hand of both gauges rises to the setting (cutting out pressure) of
the slide valve feed valve. Also note that the black hand of the equalising
reservoir rises at the rate of 1 lb. per second, which is the rate at which
the equalising reservoir control valve should feed. This indicates that the
slide valve feed valve passages are clear and equalising reservoir control
valve is operating satisfactorily.


45- . Low Pressure Governor Head.
When the pressure in the main reservoir builds up to 100 lbs.
p,s,i, the compressor should be stopped by the low pressure governor
head.
46- , Minimum Reduction Test.
Test the minimum reduction feature by placing the automatic
brake valve in Lap, and note that a 7 p.a,i. reduction of pressure takes
place on the equalising reservoir pressure gauge and the hand of the
brake cylinder gauge rises to approximately 10 p.s.i, This indicates
that the minimum reduction reservoir and piping is in good order.
47- . Equalising Piston Test.
To test the equalising piston, make a 10 lb, service
application, note that the preliminary blow takes place at the back of the
brake valve and that the equalising piston lifts causing a blow from the
brake pipe exhaust. The hand of the brake cylinder pressure gauge should
increase at a retarded rate as the valve of the equalising piston comes
to rest on its seat,
48- Safety Valve and High Pressure Governor Head.
Place the handle of the brake valve in the emergency position,
and note that a free flow of air occurs at the back of the brake valve
indicating that the large cavity is clear, also observe that the pressure
in the brake cylinder increases at a rapid rate and that the safety valve
lifts and reseats at a pressure of 55 p.s.i. Also note that the main
reservoir pressure increases to 120 p.s.i. indicating that the high
pressure head of the governor is functioning correctly,
49- Checking Warning and Retarded Release Features.
Place the automatic brake valve handle in the full release
position and note that an audible blow of air takes place at the warning
port, also observe that the hand of the brake cylinder pressure gauge
falls at a retarded rate, which will indicate that the escape of air from
the engine and tender brake cylinders is being restricted by the small
port in the rotary valve.


Before all the pressure is exhausted from the brake cylinders,
the brake valve handle should be returned to the running position and a
note made that the hand of the brake cylinder pressure gauge falls through
the remaining pressure range at a much quicker rate than when the handle
was in the full release position. The black hands on the gauges will rise
again to the setting of the slide valve feed valve*
50- Testing the Slide Valve Feed Valve (M. 5» type)
First place the automatic brake valve handle in the running
position and check the setting of the slide valve feed valve, which should
be 70 lbs. p.s.i., place the brake valve handle in the full release
position until the main reservoir and brake pipe are charged to at least
110 p.s.i. Then return the brake valve handle to the running position and
have the fireman make a brake pipe leak. Note that the low pressure head
of the governor again permits the compressor to commence working when the
main reservoir pressure is reduced to below a 100 p.s.i. and that the
black hands of the gauges fall back to the setting of the slide valve feed
valve and remain at that figure indicating that the slide valve feed valve
has cut in, A permissible variation between the outting-in and cutting-out
pressure on the gauge is 2-g- p.s.i.
51- Testing the Independent Brake.
(i) First test the slow application feature of the independent brake
valve by placing the brake valve handle in the slow application
position and noting that the hand of the brake cylinder pressure
gauge rises slowly.
(ii) When the brake cylinder pressure has reached approximately 30 p.s.i,
check the quick application feature by holding the independent
brake valve handle in the quick application position and note that
the hand of the brake cylinder gauge now rises quickly to
45 lbs. p.s.i,
(iii) Check that the pressure reducing valve is set to 45 p.s.i. by keep-
ing the handle of the independent rake valve in the quick applica-
tion position and note that the brake cylinder hand remains steady
at this figure,
(iv) Finally check that the independent release feature is working
satisfactorily, by applying and lapping the automatic brake, then
placing the independent brake valve in the release position and
noting that the brakes release freely and then return both brake
valve handles to the running position.


52-2, Testing the glow Meter Valve,
During the preparation of the engine, it is the drivers duty
to test the flow-meter and see that it is functioning correctly.
To do thisj
1, Place the automatic brake valve handle in running position, charging
brake pipe pressure to the setting of slide-valve feed-valve,
2, Make a service application with the automatic brake, reducing the
brake-pipe pressure to 50 lb,
3, After allowing time for the pressure to equalise, place the brake-
valve handle in running position,
4, An audible blow should be given from the warning port and one black
hand on the gauge should fall towards zero and then rise and
co-inclde with the other hand, and the warning blow should cease.
Should it be found during preparation that the flow-meter is
defective, the driver must enter same in the repair book and the
defective flow-meter changed by the mechanical staff,
Note, On the '4o' Class Diesel Electric Locomotives in New South Wales
a brake pipe indicator, giving an audible indication only, was
originally fitted and will not at present be replaced by the
later development known as Flowmeter Valve,
55-2, Testing of Sands.
The testing of the sanding equipment should include an
inspection of the sand pipes to see that they are properly set to the
rails. The fireman should then be instructed to operate the control
valve for a few seconds only, after which the quantity of sand on the
rail at each sand pipe should be inspected to see that each pipe is
delivering an adequate supply. After testing, any deposits of sand which
may have built up to the sand pipe should be cleared away to prevent
the possibility of any water, which may be present on the rail, from
being soaked up into the sand pipe,
54-2, Testing of Locomotive Staff Exchanger,
The driver is to assure himself that the fireman has oiled
and tested the staff exchanger in accordance with the instructions set
out in item 24/1-2 of Part 1 of this book and visually check that the
spring clips and ram's horn are serviceable.

57-2, The Blowing Down of Locomotive Boilers,
Why Boilers are Blown Down.
The regular and systematic blowing down of locomotive
boilers is essential to prevent foaming and priming, which are undoubtedly
two of the most detrimental features associated with locomotive operation,
in that they increase coal consumption and impair the condition of the
boiler and the valves and pistons, etc.


Foaming and Priming occur when:
(a) The boiler water is carried too high in the gauge glass, or;
(b) Soluble salts and sludge in the boiler water are allowed to increase
beyond low limits.
Whilst enginemen, generally, are aware of the importance of always
maintaining correct boiler water levels, particularly when running over
varying gradients, the reasons why soluble salts and sludge are so det-
rimental and how they can be disposed of by regular blowing down may not
be so fully understood and on this basis the following remarks on the
subject are detailed for the information and observance of all employees
concerned.
In the first place, feed water in any tender tank usually contains
in solution from three (3) to twelve (12) grains of salt per gallon.
Sludge is also present in varying quantities, depending mainly upon the
source from which the water is drawn. The salt and sludge remain in the
boiler after the water has been converted into steam, and gradually in-
crease in proportion to the quantity of water evaporated.
If the quantity of this salt be permitted to reach 180 grains per
gallon of water in the boiler, foaming or priming is likely. They are
inevitable when the salt increases to 200 grains per gallon.
In addition, concentrated salt solutions will cause boiler tubes
crown stay and wall stay leakage to develop, as well as manifest them-
selves in the form of a white deposit around the threads of washout
plugs, gauge column joints, etc.
The only means by which the concentration of salt in boiler water
can be effectively reduced, other than by washing out, is by blowing
down the boiler at depots and when standing over de-ashing pits on the
road, in accordance with long standing instructions and when performing
this operation it is essential to reduce the level of the water in the
boiler to one quarter glass. At the beginning of the operation the
boiler should contain not less than one half glass.
There is no doubt, that if blowing down be carried out consistently
in accordance with the foregoing, foaming will not occur, and lubrication
of the valves and pistons will be efficient and durable, whilst the in-
ternal surfaces of the boiler will be maintained in a condition which
will conduce to free steaming, with consequent reduction in coal con-
sumption and manual effort on the part of the fireman.
The assistance of enginemen in the endeavour that is being made to
achieve those objectives is hereby enjoined, and such co-operation will
be appreciated and prove beneficial.

Method and Time Allowances for the Blowing Down of Boilers.
(a) Method of Blowing Down.
All locomotive boilers are fitted with blow-down cocks, situated
either on the foundation ring, bottom of firebox, or at some other
suitable location. Boilers of all locomotives must be blown down through
the blow-down cooks, in order to reduce the silt deposits and salt con-
centrations, before commencing and immediately after finishing each trip,
and whenever warranted by conditions of operations, excepting where
instructions to the contrary exist to meet local conditions.
It is to be understood that feed water should not be injected into
a boiler just prior to being blown down, unless the water level showing
in the water gauge is below half-glass level. The injectors are not to
be operated during the blowing down process.
With the water at not less than half-glass level, open the blow-down
cock until the water level is reduced to one-quarter glass. When more
than one blow-down cock is fitted, each cock shall be operated in turn
for approximately equal periods.
After the boiler has been blown down to the level stated, it shall
be filled to approximately three-quarter glass level.
(b) Time Allowance for Blowing Down of Boilers.
In reviewing the time allowance for enginemen to attend to the
blowing-down of locomotive boilers, it has been agreed that in such
cases where the blowing down of the boiler is performed by the incoming
enginemen, who are also required to attend to the fire and ashpan before
the engine proceeds to the shed or other suitable point for stabling
purposes, the prescribed allowance for the blowing-down operations is
to be made to both the Driver and Fireman.
Alternatively, should the engine be stabled at the point where the
boiler is blown down, the allowance for this work is to be made to the
Fireman only.
In accordance with existing approval, the blowing down of boilers
on "56" "38" and "60" class locomotives is to be assigned to the incoming


and outgoing Driver and Fireman, both of whom are to be given the pre-
scribed allowance and Dally Report Sheet endorsed accordingly.
59-2 Automatic Blow Down Valve.
The boilers of '36', '3B', 's9' and '6o' class locomotives, are
fitted with an automatic blow down assembly which, is operated by steam
chest pressure, and will blow down a small quantity of concentrated
boiler water when ever the regulator is more than one-third open*
The quantity of water passing the automatic valve and escaping to
the track has been carefully adjusted by a choke, so that no operating
difficulty will occur.
The discharge is controlled by two wheel valves, one on the auto-
matic unit where connected to the boiler, the other adjacent to the right
hand steam pipe above the footplate. Both valves should be open for
normal operation, and it will be the duty of the Preparing Driver, or
Hostler, also the Driver taking the engine into service, to see that both
valves are open before an engine departs from the engine shed for traffic.
The engine crew should note the operation of the automatic valve
whilst steaming on rising grades when escape of water from the discharge
pipe should be in evidence. Should this not occur with both controlling
wheel valves open, the defect shall be entered in the repair book for
attention.
It must be clearly understood that, in addition to the operation
of this automatic blow—down valve, the boilers of these engines must be
blown down from the ordinary blow—down valves in the normal way on ar-
rival at and departure from depots, also at specified points en route
in accordance with the standing instructions,
60- Testing Automatic Blow Down Valve.
In the course of preparation the Automatic Blow Down Valve assembly
should be tested by first noting that both the stop valves on the steam
pipe and automatic equipment are in the open position, then with the
reversing gear in centre position and the locomotive secured, the
regulator should be opened half way and a note made that a free flow of
water occurs at the discharge pipe, located on the right hand side of
the locomotive. The regulator should then be placed in the closed
position and the flow from the discharge pipe should cease,
61— Testing Steam Heating Equipment.
During the winter months, when working passenger trains equipped
with steam heating, the Driver must during his preparation of the loco-
motive, examine the steam supply equipment, in the following manner, to
ensure that it la working satisfactorily.


(a) Check that the steam hoses between the engine and tender are coupled
together, and that the clips on coupling faces are secure,
(b) At the rear of the tender the steam heating hose should be attached
to the dummy coupling and the steam heating pipe stop valve closed.
(0) In the cab the steam pipe stop valve should be closed and the
pressure regulating screw checked to see that only a very light spring
tension is being applied to the regulating valve, after which ths nigger-
head valve should be opened fully,
(d) With a boiler pressure of not less than 100 p,s,i, a test of the
steam heating safety valve setting should be made by slowly opening the
steam pipe atop valve. When the pressure in the steam heating pipe has
built up to 50 p.s.i. the safety valve should lift, after which the
steam pipe stop valve should be closed and the pressure at which the
safety valve reseats noted; at the same time check that the low pressure
steam gauge is working satisfaotorily.
Should it be found that the safety valve setting is out by more
than 5 p.s.i, or that it is blowing back badly the safety valve should
be booked for attention.
Whilst pressure is present in the steam line all joints and hose
connections should be examined for leaks.
(3) After making the test, the niggerhead and steam pipe stop valves
should be closed and the tender stop valve opened, so that there will
be no steam in the pipe line and the hoses will be cool enough for the
fireman to handle when coupling the locomotive to the train,
(1) Stabling.
62-2 Stabling Duties by Enginemen and Shed Staff.
When terminating a day's run, the lubricator should be kept working
till the engine is placed on the pit, in order to ensure the valves and
pistons being efficiently lubricated. Any bearings that have shown a
tendency to heating should be specially examined to see that they are
taking sufficient oil, and booked accordingly. Special examination of
all working parts should be made to ensure that bolts, nuts, split-
pins, etc,, are intact, and springs and spring gear* must also receive
close attention. The smoke-box, steam pipes, spark arrester, etc,
should also be checked. Any lost motion, or unusual knocks must be
definitely located, Ashpan cages and hopper doors should be close fit-
ting.
Where axle-boxes are grease lubricated, the position of the in-
dicator should be noted, and if the top of the indicator is less than
s in* from the bottom of the axle, the grease block should be booked
for renewal.


When examining boxes for heating at the termination of a run, it
is irregular to just feel the centre of the wheel on the outside. The
correct procedure, when in the examination pit, is to place the hand
on the axle-box to determine the heating.
On arrival at locomotive depots, the tender tank shall be filled
to capacity, unless otherwise directed.
The coal supply shall be replenished to meet the subsequent working
in accordance with the established arrangements at individual depots.
All coal placed on the tender shall be broken by fuelmen to a uniform
firing size.
The fire shall be displaced by operating the rocker grates and
the loose ashes remaining at the sides, also on the centre bearer bar
of the firebox, shall be placed on the grates by means of the pricker
and then deposited into the ashpan. Each section of the grate shall
then be locked in the normal position.
After the fire has been drawn or banked, the ashpan dampers if
fitted, firehole door and blower valve shall be closed.
The sand boxes shall be filled to capacity at the termination of
each trip and care shall be exercised to ensure that no sand is spilled
around the filling hole as such neglect will seriously affect vital
working parts of the engine.
When casing plate doors over the sand boxes or any other casing
doors are opened, they shall be securely closed and fastened on com-
pletion of the operation.
When moving the engine in depot yards, it is essential that the
cylinder and steam chest drain valves be maintained in the open position,
63-2 Detection of Piston Head and Cross Head Knocks.
Cases have occurred of cylinder ends being knocked out, caused
by piston rods slackening in crossheads and cotters shearing off, or
by piston nuts slackening and being sheared off. The knocking of these
parts, which is a different knock to that of loose big ends or coupling
rods, should be detected by drivers, who, as a general rule, book the
big end or little end knocking badly. Drivers when experiencing bad
or irregular knocks on their engines are required to test the side
which is knocking when stabling and book the true cause of the trouble.
Knocks in the piston head or crosshead can be determined by placing the
engine on the top or bottom quarter, on the side which is knocking, and
reversing it under steam with the brakes hard on. Should a driver be
unable to determine the origin of a knock he should make an appropriate
booking in the repair book.
Neglect to make the proper booking will be specially investigated
and suitable action taken with those responsible*


64- Sight-Feed Lubricator - Valves to be Closed.
Before leaving engines fitted with sight-feed lubricators. Drivers
must see that all valves are properly closed to prevent waste of oil.
The main steam supply valve from the boiler should be closed last.
65- Withdrawal of Accessible Trimmings.
To prevent unnecessary waste of oil, each driver or other employee
who stables an engine, must withdraw all accessible trimmings, and place
them in the oil wells.
66- Booking Defects when Stabling.
When stabling the locomotive it will be the duty of the incoming
driver or shed staff to book any part of the locomotive equipment or its
component parts which require mechanical attention. Particular attention
should be given to defects that cannot be readily located by mechanical
staff, by incoming drivers, thus preventing serious delays to trains by
such defects as engines steaming dull, rough riding, over heated bearings
etc. The Westinghouse Air Brake equipment should also be given close
attention by the driver; when so doing any defect in equipment on the
engine which has come to his notice on the journey must be entered in
the repair book and it will also be necessary for him to inspect the
whole equipment when stabling the engine to detect any air leaks, broken
or loose parts, or other defects which may exist, but which may not have
been noticed when running.
If, during the journey, it is noticed that either the compressor
has to work fast, or has any difficulty in maintaining a sufficient air
supply, and there are no excessive leaks on the engine, tender or train
to account for this, the Driver must, without fail, book the compressor
for test.
Where defects develop en route on a locomotive, the Driver must
wire ahead to the Depot to which he is working, giving particulars and
the nature of the defect,
Note. When a driver is relieved en route, all defects that have been
noted by him during the journey should be listed and handed to the
relieved driver, so that these items can be given mechanical attention
when the engine is stabled.
67- Reporting a Train Delay.
When a delay occurs in working a train, the Driver must fill in
one of the Xl3B casualty forms, using ink or indelible pencil and deliver
it to the shed office before signing off duty. Form X 1527 is to be used
for any further correspondence which may be necessary. The employee to
whom it is addressed may retain the portion above the perforated line,
on which the questions to be answered are written and then furnish a
reply on other portion.


Where two engines are attached to a train, both running the same
distance and some incident (not an engine fault) which occurs on the
journey renders a casualty report necessary, such report must be sub-
mitted by the Driver of the leading engine only.
If, however, the incident was brought about by some mishap or
defect on one of the engines, it will be the duty of the Driver of that
engine only to submit the casualty report.
Where engines are employed to assist trains, either in the front
or rear, over short sections and a delay due to Loco, causes occurs,
the Driver of the assistant engine must also, unless otherwise directed,
submit a casualty report on return to his home depot.
Where two engines are working a train, but one fails and is
detached before reaching the termination of the journey, both drivers
must report.
6 8- Delays caused by Hot Boxes or Bearings.
All oases of delay caused by hot boxes or other bearings must be
reported on form X 1683 on completion of the trip, A separate form is
required for each engine that runs hot. Unless other irregularities
have occurred on the trip a casualty form, Xl3B', need not be filled in.
Drivers are to complete all details as prescribed on the form,
69- Final Stabling of the Locomotive.
In addition to the instruction contained under this heading -in
Section 1-5 page 6 Part 1 of this book, the driver after bringing the
engine to a stand at the stabling point will close the regulator handle
and where a locking pin is provided for securing the regulator handle in
the closed position, he will place the pin in the hole provided, thus
ensuring that the regulator handle is looked in the closed position
while the locomotive is standing.
The engine shall then be placed in centre gear with the cylinder
drain valves open, air brake and tender hand brake applied and the
latter secured by the pawl and ratchet, the engine hand brake also to be
applied where fitted. The air compressor steam valve, and the turbo
generator steam valve, shall then be closed.
When the stabling duties are completed, the boiler water shall not
be less than half-glass level and steam pressure not below 120 lbs, p.s.i.
When *3B’ and *s9* class locomotives are being stabled in the shed,
the engine shall be correctly positioned to meet the requirements of the
Mechanical and Shed staff, after which four (4) wooden wedges, 1,e,,
"chocks”, shall be located on the rails, two (2) on each side of the
main driving wheels. These wedges shall be tapped firmly in position.


“SAVE
COAL”
The maintenance of correct
boiler water levels is inseparable
from good firing practice. The
injector can, and should be,
adjusted to supply the minimum
quantity of water required to
maintain correct boiler water
levels.
Essential features in the eco-
nomical burning of coal are ;
(a) High fire-box temperature,
and
(b) Regularity in supply of boiler
feed water.
> THE «
70- Prevention of Cold Air entering Hot Fireboxes,
In order to prevent, as far as is practicable, cold air being
drawn into hot fireboxes of locomotives and thereby causing the boiler
tubes to leak,the following precautions must be taken by Drivers, Firemen
and other employees authorised to move locomotives in steam or whose
duty it is to deal with fires or rake out ashpans.
(a) Precautions shall be taken to avoid the admission of cold air to
hot fireboxes and any other action which would be likely to chill the
plates or tubes.
(b) The least possible use shall be made of the blower during the time
the fire is being dealt with,
(o) Immediately the fire is drawn or banked in any locomotive firebox
and before the locomotive is moved from the ashpit, the blower shall be
shut off and the flrehole door and damper doors shall be closed and
remain closed during any movement of the locomotive until it is stabled,
71- Time allowance for Lighting Up and Preparing at Out - Depots.
For the purpose of applying the time allowances, which are to be
computed from the time the fireman signs on duty to the time the loco-
motive is due to whistle out of Loco, a boiler is to be regarded as hot
up to sixteen (1 6) hours after the fire has been drawn. Any locomotive
which has been standing over sixteen hours with the fire drawn is to be
regarded as having a cold boiler.

It is, of course, only in exceptional circumstanced that the al-
lowances provided for a period of six (6) hours would apply, taking into
consideration that it is permissible to bank fires up to a period of six
(6) hours as provided for hereinafter.
Where additional coal has to be placed on the tender, additional
time based on coaling at the rate of two (2) tons per hour, is to be
allowed for that quantity of coal handled over and above the amount of
coal represented by the margin of time in excess of preparation and
lighting up allowances as shown in columns (l) and (2).
The lighting up allowance is to be regarded as 15 minutes.
Light type engine. - If previously stabled by the same Driver,
and where fire has been drawn say 8 hours, additional time to be allowed
at the rate of 2 tons per hour if the amount of coal required exceeds
13 cwt,, or in the case of fresh engine additional time to be allowed


for ooal required in azoess of 10 cwt, - being the respective quantities
of ooal for periods of 20 and 15 minutes in excess of the preparation
and lighting up allowance, at the rate of two (2) ton per hour.
In applying the allowances for small and large type locomotives
with cold boilers, 1.e,, 2% hours and 3 hours respectively, the fol-
lowing instructions are to be observeds-
(i) Where the allowance of 2* hours for lighting up and preparing
applies, and the fireman is an acting driver, he should - providing
that the conditions outlined in (ii) do not operate - in addition to
performing his own preparation and lighting up, carry out the preparation
duties for the Driver, The latter will, in these circumstances, sign
on duty "engine prepared".
Additional time for shovelling forward, at the rate of 3 tons per
hour, is not to be allowed unless it is definitely established by a
punning Inspector of the Division, that the circumstances merit the
granting of an allowance.
(ii) Provided, that in those cases where the allowance of 2* hours
applies, and it is absolutely necessary for the Fireman (Acting Driver)
to place additional coal on the locomotive or perform any other special
duties, thereby resulting in insufficient time at his disposal within
which to perform the Driver*s work, he shall not be called on to perform
the preparation duties for the Driver in addition to lighting up.
Fireman*s preparation, coaling, and other special duties,
(ill) Where the allowance of three (3) hours applies and the Fireman
(Acting Driver) is required to place additional coal on the tender,
the time taken for coaling duty should be based on two (2) tons per
hour, and which - in the majority of oases - should result in sufficient
time at the disposal of the Acting Driver to perform both preparation
duties.
Of course, where the time occupied in coaling or other special
duties is of such a duration as to preclude the Acting Driver perfor-
ming the Drivers* preparation duties, the former shall not be called on
to carry out the preparation work of the Driver,
It should be specially noted that no additional time is to be
allowed for shovelling forward where the allowance of three (3) hours
applies, as the allowance is considered to be sufficient to cover any
shovelling forward necessary,
(iv) Where the allowance of 2* hours and 3 hours applies and
the Fireman is not an Acting Driver, and no additional ooal has to be
placed on the tender, the lighting up and preparation duties for both
Driver and Fireman will be carried out by the Driver, thus permitting
of the Fireman signing on "engine prepared".


(v) Where the allowances set out in the proceeding clause apply, and
the Fireman is not an Acting Driver and additional coal is absolutely
necessary, the Driver shall not be called upon to perform the Fireman's
work, therefore, in such oases the Driver shall sign on duty in suf-
ficient time to perform his own preparation.
The advantages to be derived by rostering Firemen who are
qualified as Acting Drivers, on services terminating at points where it
is necessary for the enginemen to perform their own preparation and
lighting up, are apparent.
Although provision is made in the foregoing instructions for
exceptions and additional allowances to be made in those cases where it
is necessary to place additional coal on tenders, the necessity for this
will, in the majority of cases, be obviated by the observance of the ins-
tructions issued with respect to the coaling of tenders to maximum
capacity at the main depots.
District Locomotive Engineers must, therefore, see that the
tenders are coaled to maximum capacity at main depots, s'o eliminating
the necessity for coaling at out-stations and preventing unnecessary
haulage of coal.
When a locomotive is required to stable at an out-station or
depot, proper arrangements must be made by the Officer-in-Charge at the
depot from which the locomotive is despatched, to ensure a supply of dry
firewood being made available for lighting up purposes and so avoid the
submission of claims for time occupied in obtaining or chopping wood
preparatory to lighting up.
Before leaving duty, the Fireman must place the wood in the fire-
box after the fire has been knocked out, or on top of the boiler in the
cab. This will avoid the difficulties associated with the raising of
steam when using wet firewood,
72-2 Banking of Fires at out Depots ,
Banking of fires at out-stations or depots where no Loco, employee
is on duty and time allowances in connection therewith. Where the train
arrangements are of such a nature as to call for a locomotive being out
of service for a period not in excess of six hours and in specified cases
eight hours and there is no Loco, Staff on duty to supervise the boiler
during the time the enginemen are required to book off, it will be per-
missible, by an observance of the instructions appended hereunder, for
the fire to be banked and locomotive left unattended but not beyond the
period prescribed herein -
Incoming Enginemen will, in addition to performing the duties
usually associated with the stabling of locomotives -


(1) Fill the boiler to not more nor leas than three (3) parts of a
glass of water.
(2) Remove all fire from the front end of the fire-box and clean the
ash-pan, dampen sufficient slack coal and bank the fire at the rear
end of the fire-box, leaving sufficient fire in the fire-box to fully
cover the grate when the fire is to be spread,
(3) The steam pressure is to be not less than 120 lb, p.s.i,
(4) In all cases of locomotives not filled with "Rosebud" grates,
dampers where provided, must be closed,
(5) The gauge glass cocks to be closed,
(6) The locomotive is to be secured by the application of engine and/or
tender hand brakes.
(7) The reversing gear to be placed in centre and the cylinder cocks
opened,
(8) The regulator handle to be secured in closed position by the stop
pin provided in the sector.
In consideration of the foregoing duties, the Driver and fireman
will each be allowed ten (iO) minutes additional to the time associated
with the ordinary stabling duties, as provided in the Enginemen*s
Award, or the allowance provided on broken shift working.
Outgoing Enginemen. To be allowed -in addition to the usual allowances
- the time indicated hereinafter, within which to replenish lubrication
where necessary, attend to trimmings, spread and form the fire:
(1) Enginemen taking charge of an engine for the second portion of a
broken shift, (5) minutes.
(2) Enginemen signing on duty "engine prepared" and not associated
with broken shift working, ten (10) minutes.
This instruction and time allowances enumerated in the foregoing
provide for a minimum period for the lighting up of locomotives at out-
depots and the attention of all concerned is directed to that portion
wherein provisions are made for an allowance of two (2) hours for certain
locomotives where fire has been drawn for six (6) to ten (10) and ten
(10) to sixteen (16) hours.
It will be found, in certain instances, that by a small extension
of time to meet award allowances for preparation purposes and fifteen
(ls)minutes lighting up allowance, the services of a Fireman (Acting
Driver) may be utilised to perform both Driver's and fireman’s prep-
aration work, together with the lighting up of the locomotive, in
accordance with similar provisions outlined herein.

(A) WHISTLIN& OUT TO WORK A TRAIN.
1- . Introduction.
Tha following matter which has teen prepared for the
guidance of locomotive enginemen, has its basis in methodical practice.
The items are laid out in the sequence, which is commonly associated
with the order of events. The locomotive should whistle out of the
loco, depot and run to the train with the cylinder cooks open, after
attaching to the train, the process of blowing out the superheater
elements and cylinders should be repeated and the cylinders and steam
chests should then be warmed in accordance with the standing instructions.
The cylinder cocks should not be closed until the train has been drawn
about a train length, consistent with safety. The fire should be in good
order, the boiler moderately full of water, all bearings oiled, and the
lubricator working. When proceeding through the traffic yard, the driver
and fireman sire required to keep a sharp lookout at all times and obeying
any hand signals given by the traffic employee in charge of the shunting
movement, thus preventing collisions, derailments, and hazards, which are
prominent within marshalling yards. On engines fitted with A.6.E.T. or
A.7.E.L. brake valves the driver is required to use the independent brake
valve for all light engine movements because of the retarded action of
the automatic brake valve in the service position; when brake valves of
the No. 4 standard type are fitted, the automatic brake valve is used for
controlling light engine movements.
2- Coupling to the Train.
The driver will bring the locomotive to a stand a short
distance from the leading vehicle of the train; where it is the duty of
the fireman to eouple the locomotive to a train, he should assure himself
that when a vehicle is fitted with vestibules or diaphragm buffer plates,
the operation will not be performed unless the buffers are in contact and
the vehicles and engine are stationary. The fireman must not stand in the
fourfoot (as is the usual practice when coupling vehicles fitted with
ordinary buffers); but must wait until the engine has been brought to a
stand with the buffers closely compressed before attempting to couple
the vehicles. Special attention is also drawn to Section Page 22,
Part 1 of this Book. Before coupling, the driver will have the main
reservoir fully charged, the engine is to be attached to the leading
vehicle by the coupling provided and where screw couplings are in use,
the coupling should be screwed up sufficiently to take up the slack between
the buffers.
SECTION 3.
APPROVED LOCOMOTIVE DBIYINS PRACTICE.


After coupling up to the train, the driver will lap the brake valve handle
until the air hoses have been coupled and brake pipe cocks opened and will
then place the brake valve handle in the full release position to charge
the brake pipe. The brake valve handle should be returned to the running
position in sufficient time to prevent an overcharge of the brake pipe.
The driver is responsible for ensuring that the engine is correctly
coupled up to the train and that the brake pipe cooks are in the open
position between the engine and the leading vehicle on the train,
(B) COUPLING- OF LOCOMOTIVES TO PASSENGER TRAINS.
Special attention is directed to the Regulations concerning the
precautions to be taken by a driver when attaching a locomotive to a
passenger train, wherein provision is made thatj-
It will be the duty of the driver when bringing
a locomotive on to a passenger train, to exercise
every care and have the locomotive under such
control as will enable it to be brought to a stand
by means of the hand-brake.
It is essential that this Regulation is strictly adhered to
and thereby obviate the risk of injury to or complaints from passengers,
also damage to rolling stock due to violent contact between the locomotive
and train.
3-3 Testing the Brakes.
At the commencement of a journey it is the duty of a fully
qualified examiner to examine the brakes on the train. In the absence
of an examiner this is the driver's duty. When any train is required to
descend a 1/40 grade or steeper at any time, the brakes must be tested by
a fully qualified examiner.
The main reservoir should be fully charged and when the brake
pipe cocks have been opened, the brake valve handle is placed in the full
release position for the rapid changing of the brake pipe} at the same
time the driver must be on the alert to prevent an overcharge by bringing
the brake valve handle back to running position before the pressure exceeds
the slide valve feed valve setting.
When Applying the Brakes,
(1) Ensure that the brake pipe is fully charged to the
correct brake pipe pressure for the type of train
that is being worked,
(2) Closely check the brake pipe leakage for the first
minute after making the application.


With the No, 4 brake valve this may be achieved by closing the
brake valve isolating cock, returning the driver'a brake valve handle
to No, 1 "Pull Release" position and then observing the black hand on
the duplex gauge.
With A.6.E.T. and similar brake equipment, place the brake valve
handle on "lap" and observe the brake pipe pointer.
When the brakes are released,
(1) Do not attempt to satisfy the flow indicator by
holding the brake valve handle in "Pull Release"
position too long, always release the brakes in
the manner as prescribed herein,
(2) When train examination is complete, insist that
the train examiner orally informs the driver of
any defects noted during the examination, parti-
cularly in reference to triple valves cut out and/
or grade control valve equipment defects, including
the number not operating.
Examining the brakes on a train.
When the auxiliary reservoirs are charged to the regulation
pressure, the driver is to fully apply the brakes by three service
reductions, making a total application of from 20 to 25 lb p.s.i.
It is then the duty of the examiner (or driver when no examiner is
available) to proceed along the train and see that all brakes are applied,
all hose pipes properly coupled, brake pipe cocks fully open, (except at
the extremities), that the brake piston travel is within the prescribed
limits, grade control valve handles are properly positioned and load
compensating equipment handles correctly located, and that no major
defects are in evidence on the vehicles. When transition coupler chains
are in use, the jaw of the automatic coupler is to be in the open position
and if necessary, correctly covered. On arrival at the last vehicle, the
signal to release the brakes is to be given. The examiner (or driver)
will then return on the opposite side of the train and see that all brakes
are fully released, hand brakes off, that no sprags are located in the
wheels, and that all air brake equipment is in good order,
NOTE; When the brake examination is carried out by the driver, the
fireman is to be instructed in the correct method of release,
before the driver commences the brake examination.

WORKING OVER HEAVY GRADES.
When operating on heavy grades always test the train for
leakage prior to descending the grade; this is done by closing the
drivers brake-valve isolating cook, with the handle in full release
position and observe the black hand of the duplex gauge, with A.6.E.T.
and similar brake equipment, the fall of the brake pipe with the brake
valve handle in the lap position indicates the amount of brake pipe
leakage. If the hand falls greater than 3 lbs. per minute this is
excessive and should be rectified prior to the descent.

EXAMINATION OF TRAINS. TIME ALLOWED.
The time allowed for examination of trains and testing of
Westlnghouse air brake on trains will be as follows:-
4-3 • Warming of Cylinder and Valves.
After having blown out the superheated elements in
accordance with the standing instructions the driver should warm the
cylinders and valve chambers by opening the regulator sufficiently
to allow a small amount of steam to escape from the cylinder cocks.
The position of the reversing screw should be altered occasionally;
this will prevent condensation in the cylinders and valve chambers,
thus preventing the lubrication being washed off the cylinder and
valve faces and lifting of the automatic water release valves when
the driver lifts the load.
Effects of failure to discharge all condensate via the cylinder cocks.
Due to an ordinary characteristic of the steam locomotive,
there is a tendency that some boiler water will become entrained
with the steam drawn off at the throttle valve. Additionally the
path of steam from the boiler to the atmosphere progressively reduces
the temperature to a point where same is again converted to water,
Suoh tendency is greatest between the points of the loco depot and
the first half mile of any train journey.


Unless all such condensate is discharged through the cylinder
cocks, it must be ejected through the funnel and in that process carbon
from the smokebox is carried off with damaging effects to property and the
Commissioner’s business generally, additionally and because water may not
be compressed, such accumulation within the locomotive cylinders, trapped
before the advancing piston causes a shock blow to both the piston and its
connections and also the cylinder cover,
5- Checking the Train details with the G-uard.
Each guard and driver, before starting on his journey, must
satisfy himself that his watch is correct with the clock at the station,
(Rule 44 (e). Page 16, Rule Book.) The guard on arriving at the loco-
motive will confer with the driver in regards to the length, total tonnage
of the train, the general marshalling and type of vehicles being conveyed,
dangerous consignments, special stops at intermediate stations, attaching
or detaching vehicles en-route, position of water trucks or "out—of" trucks
on the train and any assistance that may be required from the fireman with
this latter type of truck.
Working under grade control valve conditions, the guard will
also discuss with the driver, the tonnage being conveyed with grade control
valves inoperative and the number of vehicles with brakes not working.
Shunting - Intermediate Sidings.
On fast stock and pick up trains that are required to shunt at
intermediate sidings to pick up vehicles, the guard will, after the train
is complete, signal the driver to apply and release the brakes in
accordance with the regulations. The guard having observed the application
and release of the brakes will inform the driver of the number of vehicles
with brakes inoperative or any major defects that may exist on the vehicles
picked up.
6- Checking Hydrostatic and Mechanical Lubricators.
SETTING HYDROSTATIC LUBRICATORS.
Following on from the fireman's duties, as listed in item
18/1-3, of Part 1, in regard to the filling of the hydrostatic lubricator,
the driver should now proceed to adjust the rate of oil feed for the
class of locomotive concerned in the following manner
(a) Move the oil control valve to the all open position.
(b) Adjust the feed valve, for the steam end of the air compressor, to feed
10 drops of oil quickly and then regulate the feed to 1 drop per
minute constantly.


(o) Next regulate the feed valves to the cylinders and valves of the
locomotive to deliver the following quantities of olls-
"32" and "35" Classes -
To each cylinder 4 drops per minute.
To each valve 2 drops per minute.
"30" Class -
To each cylinder 2 drops per minute.
To each valve 2 drops per minute.
"30T", "50", "53" and "55" Classes -
To each cylinder 3 drops per minute.
To each valve 2 drops per minute,
NOTE.
On locomotives fitted with lubricators having only one feed
for both cylinders, and one feed for both valves the rate of feed
through each feed valve must be doubled to meet the requirements of
both cylinders and valves.
(d) Should any oil feed fail to function, it should be blown out by
opening the drain stem below the glass for a few seconds, after
which if the feed still fails to function it should be booked
for attention by the mechanical staff.
(e) Should an oil feed valve fall in service, the driver may lubricate
the working part by increasing the rate of feed through the
unaffected nozsie on that aide of the locomotive, i.e., the feed
valve to the left cylinder fails, double the rate of feed through
the left valve,
A properly balanced lubricator feeds a regular number of
drops of oil per minute regardless of the speed of the locomotive. If
the lubricator is sot at a rate which will give the number of drops
required per mile for the hardest service on level track, heavy duty
on grades is automatically oared for by the natural decrease in speed
which increases the number of drops per mile. For example: If for
the hardest level track duty proper lubrication requires the lubricator
to be set at ten drops per minute at 50 miles per hour, which is


equivalent to 12 drops per mile, then on a grade, if the speed is
reduced to 30 miles without changing the rate of feed, the amount of
oil delivered to the valves has increased from 12 to 20 drops per
mile. After feeds have been set for the hardest service the regulating
valves need not be changed during the run, the feed being decreased for
lighter service by throttling the Oil Control Valve.
OPERATING THE OIL CONTROL VALVE.
This valve is a plug cock in the oil passage between the
reservoir and feed regulating valves. It has three positions as
indicated upon the dial.
All open - The passage from the reservoir to all feeds is
open, and the oil will feed at the rate to which the regulating valves
have been set. By moving the handle from the All open position towards
the Pump position, the feeds to the cylinders can be throttled. As
the valve is purposely made to fit tightly, it may be necessary to
tap or jar the valve handle lightly to secure exactly the right adjust-
ment.
If the valve turns hard, pull and turn at the same time.
If oil continues to feed with the lever handle on the Closed or Pump
positions, push in and turn at the same time.
Pump - In this position the feed to the air pump is the only
one open. (Note;- The Modified type: have a separate feed for the
pump.)
Closed - TNhen the handle is moved to the closed position all
feeds are out off.
To Shut Down the Lubricator. - For short stops close the
oil control valve only.
For terminal stops close the oil control valve then the
water valve and lastly the steam valve,
(B) CHECKING THE RATE OF FEED.
The rate of feed from the lubricator should be checked
regularly by the driver during train working to ensure that the lubrica-
tor is working satisfactorily, otherwise damage could occur to the
locomotive through insufficient lubrication going to the working parts.


(C) CHOKE VALVES BADLY WORN OR BLOCKED.
If a choke valve which is located on the oil delivery pipe
is badly worn, the balance of pressure, which is essential to the
efficient working of the lubricator, is lost.
A badly worn choke valve is indicated by the lubricator
working slowly when the regulator is open and the oil feed accelerating
when the regulator is closed, a booking to this effect should be made
in the repair book when stabling the engine,
A blocked choke-valve is indicated by the feed gradually be coming
Blower and eventually stopping, each time, after the feed chamber is
blown out, and if the oil delivery pipe is felt, it will be found to
be quite oold.
To remove this obstruction first turn off lubricator then
uncouple the pipe at the choke-box near the cylinder or valve chamber
as the case might be, take out the choke-valve, then turn on lubricator
and blow pipe through from that end, next open the regulator and blow
through from front end. Shut lubricator off replace choke-valve and
reoouple pipe.
When choke valves are new the hole through the valve is l/l6tti
inch and when they are worn to 3/32nds. they should be renewed. These
valves are examined at each valve and piston examination. It is
essential that choke-valves found to be defective during a trip, be
booked for attention by the stabling driver,
(D) ATTENTION TO COMPRESSORS WHEN STANDING-.
When standing in Sidings or Crossing Loops, or during other
lengthy standing periods, englnemen must see that the control valve of
the sight feed lubricator is in the correct position for the lubrication
of the compressor during such times. Also, when compressors are used
by the Shed Staff during shunting, and for supplying air when the engines
are stationary, they must see that they are properly lubricated. Cross
compound compressors on 38 class locomotives are fitted with a ball type
lubricator which is attached to the reversing valve chamber cap above
the compressor. This lubricator is filled and adjusted to feed at a
given rate by the mechanical staff.
NATHAN MECHANICAL LUBRICATOR.
With the Nathan mechanical steam chest and cylinder lubricator
oil ia pumped from the oil reservoir into the delivery pipe and after


passing through oheok valves, it comes into contact with small steam
jets which atomises the oil and cariy it to the points of delivery.
Where a second lubricator is provided for lubricating axle box cheeks
and slide bars the oil is delivered by pressure from the lubricator
without the assistance of steam.
The Nathan meohailoal lubricator permits accurate adjustment
of the oil discharge. The oil feed starts when the engine starts and
stops when the engine stops, the correct rate of feed being maintained
relative to the engine speed.
During the journey the driver is required to check that
the heating coll is operating satisfactorily; the driving mechanism
is in, good order and the oil supply does not become depleted. Should
the oil level be found low in the sight glass, the lubricator may be
replenished with cylinder oil
7-3, Continuity Test.
A continuity test of the air brake must be made by the
guard before the commencement of a Journey, at places where a locomotive
is changed, or at any Intermediate point where the flexible air hoses
have been uncoupled, that is, whenever the continuity of the air has
been interfered with.
On passenger trains the continuity test is made from the
last vehicle by the guard opening the brake pipe cock for a period
of not less than 10 seconds.
On goods trains the continuity test is carried out by the
guard opening the control cock in the brake van for a period of 15
seconds.
This test is to be carried out 3 minutes before the
departure of a passenger train and 5 minutes before the departure of
a goods train.
When such test is initiated by the guard, the driver will
lap the brake valve handle and carefully oheok that the black hand of
the duplex gauge falls appropriately and remains fallen. This action
will ensure that not more than one brake valve isolating cook is open.
The driver will acknowledge the guard's continuity test by sounding
one short blast of the engine whistle, restore the brake pipe pressure,
then fully apply and release the brakes.
NOTE:- Should it be necessary for an examiner to work on a train
at any wayside station, the driver must be so informed by
the examiner, and a fully continuity test must be carried
out by the guard and driver before the train departs.


(b) HAULING- THE TRAIN.
8- Starting the Train,
After the superheater elements have been blown out in accordance
with standing instructions* the cylinders and valve chambers warmed,
the cylinder cocks are to remain in the open position until the engine
has traversed a distance of about an average train length, consistent
with safety.
The engine should always be started in full gear, according to
the direction of travel, and kept there for the first few turns of the
driving wheels before notching up.
After ensuring that all brakes are released, open the regulator
sufficiently to lift the train; care should be exercised to prevent
slipping, do not open the regulator too wide before the engine has
gathered speed. Severe slipping causes excessive wear and tear to
the engine, disturbance of the firebed and blanketing of the spark
arrestor . If slipping does occur, the regulator should be eased
and if necessary, sand applied,
9- Expansive properties of Steam.
The cylinder walls of a locomotive, when steaming, are always
at a lower temperature than that of the incoming steam. This is due to
the fact that, before incoming steam enters, they have been in con-
tact with exhaust steam which has a relatively low temperature. As a
result, the incoming steam always gives up a part of its heat in the
re-heating of the walls. With saturated steam, this loss of heat
causes some of the steam to condense into water, but while this water
still contains heat, the fact remains that water cannot be used to
drive the locomotive*
Superheated Steam.
Superheated steam, whilst experiencing the same cooling effect,
has a temperature higher than that which would correspond with its
pressure if saturated and consequently can afford to lose a considerable
amount of heat before it drops to a temperature at which condensation
takes place. It, therefore, does not suffer as much from condensation
losses. Also, because of the greater heat contained, a given weight
of superheated steam, can do more work than a similar weight of
saturated steam, whilst, because it is more fluid and less sluggish
in flow, it will enter and leave the cylinders more freely.
The temperature of superheated steam on our locomotives varies
with different engine classes and according to the methods of firing
and the firebox temperatures which are produced. In general, when
the engine is engaged in pulling on a long and continuous bank it will


be between 64D and 740*degrees Fahrenheit,
10- Economical Use of Steam,
The use of an early cut-off is necessary to effect economy in
steam consumption. By this means, steam, after its admission to the
cylinder is out off by the valve, expands and does work, whereas, if
boiler steam were admitted throughout the stroke, this work, which can
be obtained by expansion of the steam would be lost. For example, if
superheated steam at 160 lb. per square inch pressure is admitted to the
cylinder and cut-off by the valve gear at half strokes, the work it will
perform is approximately equal to that which would be done if the steam
were throttled down to 129 lb. per square inch and admitted for three-
quarters of the stroke. Under these condMons, half a cylinder of steam
at 160 lb, per square inch pressure does the same work as three-quarters of
a cylinder at 129 lb. per square inch pressure. It will be found that
three-quarters of a cylinder of steam at 129 lb, per square inch weighs ap-
proximately 26 per cent, more than half a cylinder at 160 lb. per square
inch; resulting in a loss of about 26 per cent, in working the engine
at three-quarters of the stroke as compared with cutting off at a half
stroke. As a general statement this is true, although at earlier cut-
offs, the difference is leas, and in some engines there is some doubt as
to whether other factors do not cause a loss by cutting off earlier than
one-third of the stroke, but, up to this latter point, expansive working
is undoubtedly economical*
In adjusting the reversing screw on locomotives, it should be
kept in mind that some engines have a single thread screw and others a
double thread and this results in a variation in the number of turns in
the reversing screw on engines of the same class,
11- Lifting the Train on Heavy Grades,
In order to ensure successful lifting of trains on steep grades
when worked by superheated engines, it is essential that the fire be so
regulated as to obtain the maximum firebox temperature with resultant
high degree of superheat and requisite boiler pressure.
All steam should be released from the cylinders by opening the
cylinder drain cocks. The cylinder cocks should then be closed, all
brakes released, and the train allowed to ease back slightly so that the
maximum power will be obtained from both cylinders by means of full steam
port opening to each cylinder; to achieve this the right crank should be
slightly in advance of the top centre.
Engines should always be started in full gear, according to the
desired direction of travel, and kept there for the first few turns of
the driving wheels before notching up. It may be necessary due to an
adverse wet condition to sand the rail lightly to prevent slipping.


12- Light Steaming.
Working Positions of Regulator and Reversing Screw.
The correct adjustment of regulator and reversing screw varies
according to speed, load, and gradient traversed, and is mainly a matter
of experience with the class of engine being handled,
Theoritioally, in running, the regulator should always be fully
opened and the speed of the engine controlled, as desired, by the rever-
sing gear. In practice, this is not always possible, due to limitations
imposed by the valve gear, which, with short cut-offs at high speeds,
causes knocking and vibration of the connecting rods and big ends. This
is due to excessive back pressure on the pistons, arising from the earlier
point of compression and restriction in port openings, brought about by
too early a cut-off combined with the high speed.
It is a good working rule, therefore, when running at high speed,
to bring the gear back sufficient to prevent knocking, and then place the
regulator in a position which will maintain the desired running speeds.
Common practice is to bring the gear back one-third of the screw travel
and regulate the throttle accordingly. On heavy grades it will always
be found that a full regulator can be used, and the gear adjusted to
maintain speed and this working practice should always be adopted. On
moderate grades an intermediate course may, or may not, be necessary ac-
cording to load and speed conditions.
The use of as early a cut-off as possible is necessary to effect
economy in steam consumption. By this means, steam, after its admission
to the cylinder is cut off by the valve, expands and does work, whereas,
if boiler steam were admitted throughout the stroke, this work, which can
be obtained by expansion of the steam, would be wasted,
13- Heavy Steaming.
The most severe conditions imposed upon a locomotive are those
encountered when steaming up moderate grades, at fairly high speeds with
heavy loads. Under these conditions, a locomotive is required to deliver
its maximum horse-power.
Working on heavy grades it will certainly give its maximum
pulling power at the draw-bar, but, speed being low, the horse-power is not
so great.
For example, a C *36* class engine negotiating a 1 in 60 grade
with a load of 288 tons will give approximately 1,700 horse-power in the
cylinders at a speed of 37 miles per hour. Although the boiler would
not maintain 37 miles per hour with 288 tons on a 1 in 60 grade indefin-
itely, the boiler can maintain this speed on a 1 in 60 grade with a load
of 180 tons and give approximately 1,400 horse-power continuously.


On a 1 in 40 grade, hauling a load of 288 tons at a speed of
12 miles per hour approximately 950 horse-power will be developed. It
is the maximum horse-power output, rather than the maximum draw-bar pull,
which places the heaviest strain on the resources of the boiler for
supplying steam to the cylinders, although, admittedly, a few pounds less
boiler pressure may suffice to maintain running time with the engine
working on a more moderate grade, whereas a full boiler pressure is
necessary to maintain this effort and keep the train moving up a heavy
grade,
It is when working at its maximum horse-power output with heavy
draft and fairly high speeds, that fires are likely to drag from under
the fire door. Under these conditions, especially, as well as at other
times, enginemen should carefully watch the effect on the fire while the
engine is being worked in this manner,
14- Handling Poor Steaming Engines,
When an engine is steaming badly on a bank, better steaming will
often be obtained hy using a late cut-off and half a regulator opening,
or less. By this means, the steam, used less expansively, escapes from
the cylinders at a higher pressure, thus causing a more severe action on
the fire. Provided the boiler will stand the extra demand for water,
brought about by such uneconomical working, this method may be adopted,
but only as an expedient to run the train to time and judgment must be
used. An engine which has to be driven in this manner should be booked
as steaming poorly,
15- Coasting.
When coasting, engines must be placed in full, forward or back-
ward gear, according to the direction of running. The reversing wheel
should be wound out carefully to the end of its travel so as to avoid
jamming the nut against the end of the reversing bracket and when it comes
up against the end, it should be brought back one or two notches so as to
leave a little clearance.
Superheated engines are provided with pilot drifting valves,
with a drifting gauge mounted in the cab. To prevent the formation of a
vacuum in the cylinders, drivers must keep the 'drifting gauge hand pointing
to zero, adjusting the regulator pilot valve as the speed varies. In the
case of failure, or suspected inaccuracy of the drifting gauge, drivers
may judge the necessary pilot opening by adjusting it so as to produce
smooth running of the engine and just sufficient draught in the firebox
to draw the flame away from the ring ofthe firehole door without the aid
of the blower.
Operating the Pilot Valve when Drifting.
When drifting on falling grades, also prior to stopping at
stations or signals, the pilot valve should be open sufficiently to permit


the requisite volume of steam being admitted to the cylinders, thereby
eliminating vacuum and the admission of oxygen* Likewise, the induction
of dust and ashes into the blast pipe is prevented and assists the
efficient lubrication and smooth running of the locomotive.
Drifting gauges are provided in the engine cab to indicate steam
pressure or vacuum in the steam chests and in the circumstances outlined
above, steam should be applied sufficiently for the pointer to register
"0" on the gauge*
When engines are being brought to rest, the pilot valve should
be so operated as to avoid any building up of pressure in the cylinders
and must be eased off as required and closed as the engine is being brought
to a stand.
Care must be exercised to first close the main throttle valve
before opening the pilot valve. It is not correct to ease the regulator
from the steaming to the pilot valve position, as it will result in the
main valve coming to rest a short distance from its seat, Uake sure that
the main valve is properly closed before opening the pilot valve.
The correct operation of the pilot valve will prevent carbon
deposits in the blast pipe, minimise back pressure, improve steaming
efficiency and reduce coal consumption. It ensures a freer running engine
when coasting,
16-3 "Picking Up” a Train at Speed.
It is important to consider that after coasting on any train
the application of power is a matter of careful consideration. At all
times such action takes the alack out of drawgear and incorrect re-
application of power will always cause drawgear shock and possible failure
as well as a strong tendency to disturb the fire bed and the smokebox
content, this may result in the blanketing of the spark arrestors,
(a) Passenger Trains,
(i) Open the regulator sufficiently for the pointer of the pilot
drifting gauge to register approximately 5 p.s. i.
(ii) Bring the reversing screw back approximately one-third the
number of total turns in the screw.
(iii) Adjust the regulator opening to run at the desired speed and
when the locomotive settles down adjust the regulator and
reversing screw to meet the requirements of the locomotive,
(b) goods Trains.
Open the regulator until the pointer of the pilot drifting gauge
registers approximately 15 lb. p.s.i, and then proceed as above.


“SAVE
T
H
E
COAL
Smoke abatement and firing practice
are closely related, the former being
dependent upon an adherence to correct
firing principles.
Black smoke indicates wastage of fuel
and results from: —
(1) Unnecessarily heavy fuel
charges.
(2) Inadequate admission of air.
(3) Reduced fire-box temperature.
Keep in mind that the fire that pro-
duces the maximum steam pressure burns
relatively the minimum quantity of fuel.
DAMAGE TO TBAIN DRAW GEAR DETAILS AND CONSIGNMENTS. AND PARTICULARLY
INJURIES TO LIVE STOCK. ASSOCIATED WITH DRAW GEAR SLACK.
Within every goods or live stock train composition, even where
equipped wholly with automatic couplers, there is necessarily a variable
and sometimes considerable amount of slack, which provides gaps between
the adjoining buffers.
Where train compositions include the employment of the alliance
automatic coupler transition chain to an adjacent draw hook type vehicle,
as is not uncommon in four-wheeled live stock services, locomotive
(jplygps are to specially consider this important matter, particularly
where such loads are hauled by diesel electric or electric type
locomotives, either in single unit or multiple unit operation.
In many cases the starting effort of notch one, or further
notching, if not carefully controlled, will cause severe draw gear
shock throughout certain train compositions in the first two engine
lengths of travel. To assist in the desired graduated take off, the
Westinghouse independent air brake may sometimes be used to advantage
by applying about 5 p.s.i. and holding such until the train slack has
been taken care of.
In the matter of approaching stopping sites, particularly with
electric locomotives, which have a potential for very high speeds
on goods services, the driver should fully consider this factor, and
appropriately before hand progressively reduce train haulage speed
to the stopping site by backward transitions from parallel to series
pai-all si and from series parallel to series and by further rationing
of the current in the series combination by moving the throttle back
towards notch one.
Finally, in order to keep the train stretched at the stopping
site for a smooth take off, a 7 p.s.i, application should be initiated
before closing the throttle.


17- Blanketing of Spark Arresters,
The blanketing of spark arresters presents serious adverse
effects in locomotive operation and when it occurs, can be promptly
determined by the rapid reduction in steam pressure, in addition to
the blower being rendered useless.
When confronted with such conditions, it is important that the
engine be Immediately brought to rest in order that the spark arrester
may be properly cleaned after due precautions have been taken by opening
the smokebox door gradually and thereby avoid the explosion that may be
occasioned by the sudden admission of oxygen to the smoke box gasses,
A flare lamp must not be used when opening the smoke box door due to the
abovementloned risk.
When a spark arrester has been blanketted and subsequently cleaned
down, it is essential that all ashes be removed from the floor of the
smoke box, to prevent a re-occurence of this nature.
Providing the aforementioned features are given close attention
enginemen will be relieved of the anxiety that is created by the
blanketing of spark arresters and at the same time, will effect economy
in coal consumption in conjunction with the free steaming of the locomotive.
This blanketing is caused byj
1, Excessive use of fire irons or rocking grates
whilst engine is pulling heavily,
2, Boiler priming,
3, Working engine too deep in gear at high speed,
4, Closing the firehold door too tightly,
5, Firing excess quantity of small coal on an
already heavy fire,
18- Use of Exhaust Steam Pressure gauges.
Exhaust steam gauges are attached to the end of the valve
chamber on certain classes of engines and record the back pressure in
the blast-pipe, thus enabling the driver to alter the position of the
gear to reduce the action on the fire which is caused by the high velocity
of steam escaping at the funnel, by this means reducing the possibility
of blanketing the spark arresters and also overcome other difficulties
at present experienced in train running.
The instructions on the face of the gauge in bold letters are
explicit and direct the drlver f s action. There are two very prominent
lines on the gauge face one "Black" which registers 2-j lb, back pressure]


this is the desirable position of the gauge pointer, whilst the engine
is at works the next prominent line is "red" and records 7 lb. back
pressure | this position which la most undesirable is brought about by
the engine being worked too deep in the gear with a wide regulator
opening, or, the engine is beglning to pick up the water from the boiler.
It is necessary to reduce this high back pressure in the blast pipe by
altering the gear position or reducing the regulator opening, otherwise
the severe action on the fire will cause coal particles to be carried
through the tubes blocking up the spark arrester mesh as well as
disturbing the fire bed. The reversing screw and regulator opening are
to be adjusted so that the gauge pointer is kept as near as possible to
the heavy black line on the gauge faoe. Since this important device
can only be tested in train working, it is vital that all stabling
drivers book any defects,
19- Sanding.
Wherever sand is used, no more than is actually necessary to stop
slipping should be employed, as sand causes extra resistance to pulling
the train.
Continuous sanding should be avoided if possible as it means
excessive consumption and also uses air from the main reservoir which
in extreme oases can cause brakes to creep on. In order to avoid
interference with track circuits at interlockings, including Sydney Yard
and Automatic Signalling Areas, enginemen must use sand only when
absolutely necessary. When it has been found necessary to use sand,
in these areas, the driver must take prompt action to bring the matter
under the notice of a responsible officer so that suitable action can
be taken to promptly clean the rails and prevent interference with the
track circuits, Every care must be taken to prevent, as far as
possible, fouling of switches by ashes or sand,
20- Speed Boards.
Speed boards (see diagram) displaying numerals are erected on
the left-hand side of the line on certain sections, as seen by the
driver of an approaching train, and indicate the maximum speed at which
trains may be run between that board and the next one in advance.
When the numerals provide for a reduction in speed, the driver
must so regulate the running of his train that the engine will not pass
the board at a speed higher than shown by the numerals on the board.
When the numerals indicate an increased speed, the driver must
not accelerate his train until the engine has reached to board which
provides for the higher-rate of speed.


NOTKj These speed boards do not authorise engines or trains
to be run at a speed greater than that prescribed in
working timetables for such engine or train,
(C) BRAKING- OP TRAINS.
21- Introduction,
The proper control of the power and means of braking with the
Westinghouse Automatic air brake Is a matter of skill and judgement
acquired by experience, but this may be improved if applied in the light
of soma knowledge af the characteristics of the mechanical equipment
and of the behaviour of the air as it traverses the system to operate
and to build up pressure in the various parts.
An appreciation of the effect of speed and of the forces
Involved in stopping a train, is also desirable. Some understanding
«f how these factors operate in conjunction with different grads
conditions and types of trains and the arrangement of vehicles in them,
should be of assistance to drivers, albeit the practical application of
the principles must be learned in actual train handling,
22- Availability of Brake Power,
The matter of first importance is that drivers should maintain
available for their use at all times the maximum brake power which the
regulation pressure and the proper use of it can afford them, Bor
f.h-i a reason they must guard against waste of brake power which, especially
on long heavy descending grades, can be brought about by incorrect methods
and lack of judgement. Drivers must, therefore -
(l) Avoid making brake application by means of numerous light


reductions, which may be insufficient to cause the triple
valves to move to the application position at the rear of
a long train, but which may allow their auxiliary reservoirs
to be lowered in pressure by feeding back into the brake
pipe. The small amount of air passing from the auxiliary
reservoir to the brake cylinder very slowly would blow
through the leakage grooves past the pistons and to the
atmosphere.
(2) Avoid waste of air by means of over-reductions which will
make unnecessary demands on the capacity of the compressor.
When pressures throughout the brake pipe and auxiliary
reservoirs are in a state of equalisation, a reduction of
25 lb. is ample to apply the brakes with full force, even
with long piston travels. Any further reduction will
only waste air from the brake pipe and this will have to be
made good upon release. Should, however, the brake pipe
pressure be higher than the pressure in the auxiliary
reservoirs (due to insufficient time following the release
to feed through the triple valve feed grooves, or other
causes) and an application has to be made under these con-
ditions, it may then require an over-reduction to attain
the full braking force. Under such circumstances if it be
not possible to wait for pressure stabilisation before
applying, the over-reduction can be regarded as justifiable,
(3) Be careful not to release the brakes before speed has been
reduced to such a low rate as conditions of the grade and
train required, to allow of there being sufficient time to
obtain a full re-charge of the auxiliary reservoirs throughout;
before the next brake application becomes necessary; be careful
to leave the brake valve handle in the "Pull Release" position
long enough to obtain this re-charge,
(4) Do not neglect to take advantage of the characteristics of
the road which may assist braking; that is (unless it be
unnecessary, or else some reasons render it undesirable
to do so),
A driver should make a sufficient reduction in the brake pipe
pressure to have the train under control approaching a curve
or an easier part of the grade, so that the speed may be such
as will permit of a release being made thereon, and so utilise
the extra retarding effect provided by these road conditions.
This keeps the speed from increasing so rapidly as it would if
release were made elsewhere, thereby giving the maximum time
for the re-charge period. Attention to this point is very
desirable in the handling of Goods trains.


(5) Be sure to maintain sufficient steam pressure to keep the
compressor working at its maximum capacity.
(6) On long steep falling grades if it is necessary to have extra
air pressure, when the brakes are released, keep the brake valve
handle in the full release position long enough to re-charge
the auxiliaries.
(7) When making any stop, but especially one on a grade. Judge
the speed and the brake force so that it is not necessary to make
more than two (2) applications and so avoid depleting the
pressure of the auxiliary reservoirs by a number of applications
and releases. It should always be remembered that low auxiliary
reservoir pressure results in low brake cylinder pressure and
reduced brake power.
(8) If, for any reason, after a brake application, it is not
possible to obtain a full re-charge within a reasonable period,
or at any time when the brakes are off, the brake pipe cannot
be maintained at regulation pressure, the driver should endeavour
to obtain the maximum pressure possible and then make a full
brake application to stop the train. The regulation pressure
laid down shall be 60 lbs, per square inch on the level and on
light grades and 85 lbs. per square inch on heavy falling grades;
the driver must not allow the train to restart until this
pressure has been obtained.
23-3 Factors Affecting Control of the Train,
It is also desirable that drivers should be aware of some of the
factors which affect the degree of control which can be exercised.
They should know that -
(1) It requires a very much greater force to stop a train from a
high speed than from a low one. For instance, the brakes
have to do approximately four (4) times as much work in stopping
a train from 40 miles per hour as they would from 20 miles
per hour and nine times (9) as much in stopping from 60 miles
per hour as they would from 20 miles per hour. Also, the
brakes do not grip the revolving wheels so well at high speeds
as at low, although they may be pressed Just as hard against
them by the air pressure, this is due to the reduction of
frictlenal properties at higher speeds,
(2) On a Down grade the brakes, besides overcoming the momentum of
the train, also have to destroy the accelerating force due to
the grade, thus necessitating a longer distance, or a heavier
brake application, to make the stop.
(5) There is a great loss of braking power should any of the wheels


start to skid on the rail.
There is a much greater frictional grip of the wheels on the rails
so long as they are rolling on the rail surface. When skidding
commences there is then more than sufficient grip between the brake
blocks and the wheels, because friction is great when there is no
movement of surfaces past one another, but very much less friction
exists between the wheels and the rail when the former are sliding
than when they are rolling on the latter, because these surfaces
are then moving past one another. When the brakes are applied so
hard that their action is just short of sufficient to produce
skidding between wheel and rail, the maximum braking power is being
exerted,
(4) Care should be exercised to ensure that when a service application
of the brakes is made, the driver's brake valve handle is placed
in the "lap" position, and not inadvertently moved to the running
position,
24-5 Smooth Operating of Passenger Trains.
The next matter of importance is to obtain smooth running and stop-
ping of trains under the influence of the brake. This is necessary for
the comfort of passengers, to avoid damage to travelling stock, to the
loading on goods trains and to prevent breakage of drawgear, etc. For
this purpose the following matters should be kept in mind, and the moat
careful handling should be practised under all circumstances.
(1) At low speeds, avoid making a heavy application, or, if a heavy
application has been made at high speed, avoid keeping it applied
when the speed has been reduced to a low rate. As already explained
the brakes are much more severe in their action at low speeds than
at high ones, resulting in sudden jarring stops if they are applied
and kept on with full force, either with a service or emergency
application, when travelling slowly. Although a satisfactory
stop may, perhaps, be made with a single brake application from a
moderate speed, if it is desired to make a quick but smooth stop
from a high speed, the best results under such circumstances can
usually be obtained with the two-application method, if properly
carried out. By this method, when initiating a stop a fairly heavy
service brake application is made, preferably by one reduction, and
it is held until the speed is reduced to a rate of 15 to 20 miles
per hour (or less speed if requiring to stop exactly, as at a water
column) some little distance short of the stopping point. Then a
quick release is made and the brake valve handle returned to "lap"
position (being careful to recharge the brake pipe only sufficient
to reverse the triple valves) then re-applying with a moderate
service application to stop at the desired point,
(2) The attention of enginemen is particularly directed to the necessity


for every care being exercised to avoid complaints from the
travelling public in respect to the rough handling of passenger
trains when starting or stopping at stations, water columns,
signals or crossing loops and which is brought about by the
incorrect operation of the Westinghouse Air Brake.
(3) All concerned are informed of the necessity for the speed of
trains to be so regulated when approaching station platforms
and water columns as will of the brake being released
before the train is finally brought to rest - the failure to
observe this necessary precaution being responsible for trains
being brought to a stand with the brakes applied, with resul-
tant rough stoppage and discomfort to passengers.
(4) It is also necessary that similar attention be given by
enginemen to the correct handling of stock trains to avoid
injury to the animals and loss to the owners with resultant
serious complaints. This is of particular importance when stock
are being conveyed by mixed trains which are part automatic
coupled and part screw coupled, necessitating every care being
exercised in the correct operation of the air brake to avoid
undue roughness in starting or stopping,
(5) With the same objective in view and for several good reasons
some air should be maintained in the locomotive brake cylinders
when stopping, so that when the train comas to rest the
locomotive will not recoil on to the train; thereby avoiding
the buffeting action which does occur when engine brake
cylinders are depleted of air when coming to a stand.
To take oare of certain operating conditions, in exception to
the foregoing practice, wherein the locomotive is coupled to
the first vehicle of a passenger train with the transition
chain of an automatic coupler, the train. Including the loco-
motive is to be brought to a stand with the brakes partially
applied and remain applied during the time it is standing at
a platform. This procedure ensures that a loose motion is
not set up between the engine and the train while passengers
are leaving or joining the train. The best method of employing
this practice 1s to affect a partial release on the last few
revolutions of the wheel and then reset the brakes with a
moderate application of the automatic brake after the train has
been brought to a stand,
25-3 Smooth Operating of Goods Train.
The same principles for smooth braking hold as with Passenger
trains, except that the brakes should not be released just before coming
to a stop. Nor, Indeed, should they be at any time when the speed is
less than, say, 5 miles per hour. When travelling so slowly with the
brakes hard on, it is best to allow the train to stop and release when
standing. The reason for not releasing at such speeds is that the


brake blocks grip the wheels very powerfully and by placing the brake
valve handle in "Pull Release" position causes the brake to release on
the front vehicles of a long train first, and, as a result, the slack
between these vehicles is snatched out by the backward drag due to the
rear still slowing down (even with automatic couplers there is an
appreciable slack action between vehicles) and the front portion is
consequently stopped with an abrupt jerk against the rear of the train
and breakage of drawgear or other damage may result.
Additional matters requiring attention for smooth operation in
Goods train braking are;-
(1) To allow sufficient time for stabilisation of pressures and
adjustment of slack action throughout the train, before either
releasing the brakes following an application, or applying the
brakes following a release*
(2) If it is possible to do so, avoid releasing the brakes when the
train is passing over a change in grade. The braking should be
so arranged as to permit the release being made when the whole
of the train is on a uniform grade.
(3) When about to apply power after a stop or after a reduction in
speed by a brake application, allow sufficient time for the
brakes to release fully on the last vehicle before doing so, thus
permitting any consequent effect on the slack action between
vehicles to adjust itself and also to avoid drag against any
vehicle that may still be braking. Do not apply the brakes too
soon after shutting off power but allow the consequent movement
throughout the train to die down before doing so, always shut off
power, early enough to allow of this being done.
(4) On trains comprised of some loaded and some empty vehicles, avoid
reducing speed suddenly by means of unnecessarily severe service
applications with one heavy reduction, but rather make two (2)
or more moderate reductions at intervals, if necessary, to secure
the desired braking force. If a heavy brake application is made
with trains of the type mentioned, the empty vehicles, because
they have the same brake force applied to them but are lighter,
will reduce speed more rapidly than the loaded ones, and con-
sequently the latter will run into, or away from, the empty ones.
In this respect it should be borne in mind that the effect will
not be so pronounced at high speeds as at low speeds because when
travelling slowly the brakes are moire effective and will con-
sequently produce greater speed changes between differently braked
vehicles. At low speeds, therefore, it is more especially
desirable to make, or to hold, only moderate reductions (but with
a maximum of 10 lb.), whereas more latitude in this respect is
permissible at higher speeds.


It will, of coarse, be understood that the foregoing rules are
not to be regarded as necessarily influencing a driver’s actions when
it is required that an emergency stop should be made. Under such cir-
cumstances, the brake valve handle should be placed in the "Emergency"
position, and left there until the train comes to a stand. As to
whether an emergency stop will be the best means of preserving a
m«.rimm degree of safety must be judged according to the circumstances
of the moment. There are situations, sometimes associated with de-
railments and other occurrences, in which a sudden stop might introduce
elements more dangerous than those which it is intended to avoid, and
the action appropriate to the conditions must, therefore, be dictated
by the necessities of the occasion,
26-3 Manipulation of the Air Brake during Train Working,
On locomotives fitted with a flow meter which intermittently
blows and recovers, particular notice should be made of the slide valve
feed valve activity.
This condition is usually associated with a slide valve feed
valve which is not sufficiently sensitive and is thus allowing brake
pipe leakages to occur without immediate replacement of brake pipe air.
This occurrence may cause triple valve to reverse and apply brakes.
If the flow meter behaves in this manner, DO NOT move the brake
valve handle to "full release" position as this action will cause ovei>-
charging of the brake pipe.
Light applications should be avoided if possible, when working
a train. Should a train be brought to a stand with a light application,
the brake pipe pressure should be blown down by at least 15 lbs, before
effecting the release to ensure the desired triple valve actions and
reactions.
Intelligently use the independent release features of A 6 and
similar brake valves to ensure that appropriate brake cylinder pressures
are retained in the locomotive brake cylinders. This is necessary on
both goods and passenger trains in order to ensure smooth stopping
routines, care of drawgear shook and, particularly of passenger trains,
the tendency of the engine to recoil on to the train at the moment of
stopping.
Method of Releasing Brakes.
A uniform method of effecting a brake release and brake pipe
recharge after braking routines is to be adopted, particularly in
respect to correct recharging of the brake pipe, so as to avoid over-
charging and failure to reverse triple valves on the train.
With No. 4 brake valve. As an approximate guide for drivers,
when working long trains under average conditions on light grades, the
rule is given that, in effecting a release, they should keep the brake


valve handle in "full release" position for a period of one (l) second
for every five (5) vehicles on the train before bringing it back to the
"running" position. This rule is subject to variation as circumstances
may demand and according to the dictates of judgment to avoid either
undercharging or overcharging the auxiliary reservoirs. Immediately
following this first release period, the handle should, two or three
seconds later, be again placed in "full release" for approximately
one (1) second, and then brought to, and kept in, the "running" position
until another application is desired. This last movement is advisable
in order to counteract the effects of a possible slight overcharge of
the brake pipe which, when the rate of feed to the latter is reduced
by assuming the "running position, it may equalise by a flow of air to
the rear auxiliary reservoirs and so reverse some of the triple valves
at the front of the train*
With A 6 and similar brake valves on passenger trains and other
trains not exceeding the length of a passenger train, manipulate the
driver 1 s brake valve handle to momentarily touch "full release" and
immediately return to "running" position.
On trains of greater than normal passenger train length, place
the driver*s brake valve handle in "full release" for a period of time
not exceeding one (l) second for every ten (10) four-wheeled vehicles
on the train and then return handle to "running" position. Finally,
while the flow meter is blowing, place the handle momentarily in
"full release" and return it immediately to "running" position.
Whenever the brake valve handle is moved from "running" position
in service braking routines, the operator’s hand should be retained on
the handle until it is finally returned to the normal "running" position*
This will obviate the possibility of the driver inadvertently leaving
the brake valve handle in "Full Release" with resultant overcharge of
the brake pipe,
27-3 Brakes creeping on when Running.
It is to the interest of all concerned to avoid damage to railway
equipment and delays arising from the brakes either creeping on without
an application being made, or failing to come off after a release.
Apart from defects in the brake equipment, the brakes creeping
on may be due, amongst other causes, to any of the following;—
(1) Failure to maintain a proper constant main reservoir pressure
during the time the brakes are off, as may occur if the steam
pressure is dropped very low, or if the steam valve to the com-
pressor should, become partially closed, during a trip,
(2) By lowering the slide valve feed valve setting by adjusting it
when on a train, without subsequently taking the necessary pre-
caution of applying and releasing the brakes several times, soasto


bring the pressure in the auxiliary reservoirs down to the altered
brake pipe pressure, Adjustments to the slide valve feed valve
setting should be made when the train is stationary and not when
running,
(3) Omitting to apply and release the brakes from the leading engine
with an adequate reduction when an assistant engine is attached
to a tpain, in order to adjust any difference in brake pipe
pressure due to a possible disparity in the slide valve feed
valve setting of the two locomotives. To ensure corrective action
in this direction on the part of the driver of the leading engine,
the driver of the train engine should, after he has closed the
isolating cook and before the assistant engine is attached, make
a full "service" application of the brakes and then place the
brake valve handle in "Pull Release" position with the standard
brake valve and running position with the A.6.E.T, or similar
brake equipment, the brakes, of course, remaining applied despite
this latter action.
It should be remembered, when it is necessary to reduce air
pressure throughout the train to bring this within limits of the
setting of the slide valve feed valve on the engine, that not
only must the brake pipe pressure be reduced but also the auxiliary
reservoir pressure on each vehicle comprising the train.
If a reduction of 25 lb, per square inch or over is made in
the brake pipe pressure, it does not necessarily follow that all
auxiliary reservoirs will be reduced by this amount. The maximum
drop in auxiliary reservoir pressure on each vehicle is dependent
upon the brake cylinder piston travel and it is often necessary
to make two or more reductions and releases to bring this pressure
to the limits required. Care should be taken to ensure that;-
(a) All triple valves are moved to the "release" position,
at the same time charging the auxiliary reservoirs to
a minimum,
(b) That sufficient time (approximately 10 seconds) is
allowed between applications to ensure that brake
cylinder pressure on each vehicle is reduced to zero
before the next reduction is commenced,
(4) Changing from carrying the brake valve handle in the "Pull
Release" position for the whole of each recharging period to the
"running" position at the foot of a steep grade, without first
applying and releasing the brakes with a sufficient reduction
to reduce the pressure in the auxiliary reservoirs to the pressure
to which the brake pipe will fall when the "running" position is
assumed.


(5) Carelessness in allowing the brake valve handle to move towards
the "lap" position, when it should be in the "running" position.
28-3 Brakes Falling to Release.
Failure of the brakes to release after an application can often
be traced to incorrect operating practices, or the omission of certain
precautionary measures, the driver must take the necessary steps to
prevent such occurrences. The following are some of the more common
mistakes in brake operating methods which can cause failure to accomplish
a proper releases-
(l) The making of light reductions. In order to ensure complete and
prompt release of the brakes, any application of less than 7 lh.
should be avoided on Passenger trains, whilst, on long Goods
trains, anything leas than 15 18. should be regarded as in-
sufficient ,
The equivalent to a light reduction is the placing of the
brake valve handle in the "full release" position before the
brake application has had time to take full effect on the triple
valves at the rear of the train. If these valves have been brought
to application position, but have not had time to let any quantity
of air flow to the brake cylinders there being a minimum reduction
of pressure in the auxiliary reservoirs and consequently,
reliance for reversing the triple valves must be placed mainly
on the excess pressure carried, as is the case in all light
reductions, and this is undesirable,
(2) Attempting to effect a release in "running" position through the
slide valve feed valve and not employing "full release" position.
This practice is incorrect, as the only pressure differential
then available to reverse the triple valves is the amount of the
reduction itself, the excess pressure, which is carried for the
purpose of assisting in this, not being availed of*
(3) Neglect on the part of a driver to make the prescribed full brake
application from the engine, followed by a release, after it has
been observed that the guard has conducted the continuity test
from the rear of the train* The observance of this practice on
the part of the driver is of considerable importance*
(4) Palling to apply and release the brakes from the engine after
attaching vehicles to a train. Those vehicles may have air in
their brake equipment at a different pressure from that of the
brake system on the train, thus causing the brakes to apply on
the vehicles with the higher pressure and remain so unless
corrective action is taken,
(5) In the case of engines fitted with the non-automatic brake.


additional to the automatic, for engine and tender, there ie aleo
the likelihood of air pressure building up on the non-automatio
air side of the double oheok valve on the tender, if the isolat-
ing oock on the non—automatic air line from the engine to the
tender be closed. The result is that air in the brake cylinder
following an automatic application, does not escape properly upon
release.
It is, therefore, very necessary for all concerned to specially
ensure that the isolating cocks in question are open, except when
engine and tender are parted for any reason, or the non-automatic
air pipe between engine and tender is ruptured, or disconnected
and open to atmosphere.
As a concluding note on the matter of avoiding failure of brakes
to release, it is desired to emphasise that, whenever a brake application
is made, either for a brake test when standing, or for stopping or reduc-
ing the speed of a train, if it be desired to be certain of the subsequent
release of every brake, it is always advisable to carry out the release
Of the brakes in the regulation manner as previously explained. This
will not apply to heavy down grades on which control of the train is of
first importance and failure of some brakes to release may be of less
account, but it will apply at the end of such descent when lighter grades
are encountered. It may be added that, as most flat wheels are due to
starting with the brake still applied on the wheels concerned, it is of
special importance to ensure, under all circumstances, that, after a stop,
the release of the air brake has been effective. For this purpose,
following a lengthy stop an application and release should be made Just
prior to re-starting, in accordance with the foregoing method, as a
precaution.
On engines fitted with the non-automatic air brake additional to
the automatic, it is well to bear in mind that, should the non—automatic
air brake valve be in the "lap" position (even if the brakes be off) when
an automatic brake application is made, the release of the latter may not
release the engine brake properly if there has been a slight leak through
the double check valves,
29-3 Adjusting Slide Valve Feed Valve.
Snginemen are permitted, when necessary, to adjust the setting
of the slide valve feed valve within the limits of the regulation brake
pipe pressure laid down, but unless such adjustment is essential, they
must not make a practice of so doing. To make any desired adjustment
in brake pipe pressure the cover nut over the regulating plug must be
removed, and the latter screwed in should an increase in pressure be
required, or out if it is desired to lower the pressure. In 1 oases,
when the desired setting has been attained, the cover nut must be replaced
and screwed on tightly.
Apart from the foregoing adjustment, enginemen must not, under


any circumstances, interfere with the slide valve feed valve but if it
be defective, book it or bring it under the notice of the Mechanical
Staff for attention.. Should, however, the defect in the slide valve
feed valve supplying the brake pipe render it Impossible to handle the
train properly on a journey, and the engine concerned is fitted with a
non-automatic air brake system or an A,6*E.T. or similar brake equip-
ment which has a slide valve feed valve acting as a pressure reducing
valve, this latter may be substituted for the defective valve supply-
ing the brake pipe and re-adjusted as necessary.
In all such oases, however, the matter must be reported when
stabling the locomotive*
30- Brake Pipe Pressures,
Air pressure to be maintained in the brake pipe as under:
Passenger trains: 70 to 75 lbs, per square inch.
Goods trains: 60 to 70 lbs, per square inch,
(1) Empty vehicles and full length loads working over light grades,
when a minimum of 60 lbs, per square inch, brake pipe pressure
is to be maintained,
(2) Bogie goods vehicles when tabled to operate at speeds of 45 miles
per hour or over, 70 lbs, per square inch, to be maintained in
the brake pipe,
31- Dragging Brakes and Skidded Wheels,
Several oauses contribute to these occurrences and to ensure that
no contribution is made by locomotive drivers, it is desired that the
following uniform practices be adopted:
During preparation of locomotives, completely test the driver*s
brake valve. Including the slide valve feed valve, flow meter and flow
indicators for efficient operation. Initially set the slide valve feed
valve to 70 lbs, per square inch.
When attached to the train, make precise adjustments to the slide
valve feed valve to meet the authorised brake pipe pressure for the type
of train to be worked.


DEAL INS WITH STICKIN6 BRAKES ON VEHICLES.
To release a sticking triple valve on a vehicle while running,
do not move the brake valve handle from "running" to "full release" but
try boosting - the brake pipe pressure by means of the feed valve. If
this is successful, carry on to the next point where the brake pipe
pressure may be again safely reduced to normal. If unsuccessful, stop
and appropriately instruct the fireman in the triple out out procedures,
32-3 Cutting Out the Air Brake when it is Defective,
(A) Before despatching the fireman back to correct such a condition,
it is necessary to ensure that the fireman understands that brake drag
may arise from several causes, namely:
(1) Hand brake application.
(2) Wrongly adjusted brake rigging,
(3) Unreliable triple valve,
(4) Unreliable grade control valve or handle not set squarely
in desired position,
(5) Pinal instruction - if the grade control valve at the "EX"
position will not cause a release, out the triple out and
take the number of the vehicle for the driver's labelling
attention,
(B) TO CUT THE TRIFLE VALVE OUT.
(1) Close triple valve isolating cock and also water service
isolating cook if the latter is fitted to the vehicle,
(2) Release all pressure from the auxiliary reservoir by means
of the hand release valve, and secure the release valve in
the open position,
(3) Attach an "Air Defect" card to the release valve wire,
giving reasons for cutting out the brake, together with
name and depot of Driver,
(4) Notify Train Examining Staff at first available opportunity
and the latter shall make arrangements to have expeditious
attention given to the defect, either at the station where
it is reported or elsewhere,
(5) If relieved by another driver at any point, advise the latter
of the occurrence and of the action which has been taken.


■“SAVE
THE
COAL”
Economy in coal consumption can be achieved by
supplying to the fire-box the requisite volume of air
to produce efficient combustion.
South Coast coals contain a relatively high per-
centage of fixed carbon and low volatile hydro car-
bons, and are comparatively slow burning. The most
efficient results are obtained from them when a fire
of moderate depth is prepared and maintained by
light and frequent charges of coal.
The air required should be admitted chiefly
through the fire grate.
Correct firing reduces manual effort and the
quantity of coal consumed.

33-3 Number of Vehicles That Can Be Conveyed With Westinghouse Air
Brake Inoperative,
(A) Express, Mail and Passenger Trains;- The maximum number of
vehicles with air brake inoperative (the through air connect-
ion not being interfered with) that can be hauled to termin-
ation of journey on Express, Mail and Passenger trains is two
(2), provided these vehicles are marshalled ahead of a bogie
brake-van, in which there is a guard or brakesman to operate
the hand brake as required.
Should the air brake be out out on a bogie brake-van which is
the last vehicle on the train, and in which a guard or brakes-
man is travelling, there will be no necessity to re-marshall
this vehicle,
(B) G-oods and mixed trains;- The maximum number of vehicles that
can be conveyed with air brake inoperative is six (6) and not
more than two (2) marshalled together. Vehicles fitted with
disc wheels having a defective brake, are not to be attached
to a train except on the authority of the Chief Traffic Man-
ager. Bogie vehicles are to be counted as equal to two four
wheeled vehicles.
On the following sections bogie vehicles, U, B, CU, RU, K or
KH trucks are to count as equal to two.

34-3 Plow-Meter Valve.
Owing to the high feed capacity of the M 3 type slide valve feed
valve, Flowmeter valves and Indicator Gauges are fitted to assist drivers
by giving s-
(i) A visual, and audible signal to the driver, when the guard
makes the continuity test of the air brake pipe.
(ii) Any excessive leakage from the brake pipe or its auxiliaries
on the train.
(iii) 4. ready indication of a break-away or ruptured brake pipe.
The Operation of the Plow-Meter Valve.
The operation of the Flowmeter Valve is based on the principle
that whenever brake pipe pressure is being depleted with the brake valve
handle in "running" position the slide valve feed valve will tend
maintain the brake pipe pressure. However, should a heavy flow of air
take place through the feed valve this causes an appreciable drop in
pressure which is utilised to operate the Flowmeter Valve and thus provide
both an audible signal and the visual signal as shown on the Flow Indicator
Gauge, The Flowmeter Valve is connected one side to main reservoir
pressure direct; this connection also being made to one hand of the Plow
indicator Gauge. The other side of the Flowmeter Valve is connected to
the main reservoir port which supplies air to the slide valve feed valve,
A signal is given by the Flowmeter Valve on each release of the
brake, but normal conditions will be restored immediately the brake pipe
has been recharged to within approximately 5 lbs. sq. in. of the slide
valve feed valve setting. When the brake valve handle is returned to
"running" position after the release of the brake, a reduction in pressure
will be indicated on one hand of the Plow Indicator Gauge, but this hand
will slowly return to equalise with the second hand of the Plow Indicator
Gauge in each case, indicating that the brake pips is intact. If, however,
the signal is maintained continuously after the release of the brakes and
the hands of the Flow Indicator Gauge fail to equalise, a check should be
made of the condition of the brake pipe by placing the brake valve handle
in the "lap" position, or closing the brake valve isolating cock, in order
to determine whether the brake pipe is ruptured.
Should a signal be obtained in running, the brake pipe should
immediately be checked in a similar manner.


When charging an empty train the brake valve la to be maintained
in the "running" position, a signal will be given continuously until
such time as the brake pipe has been charged to approximately the feed
valve setting. When the train has been completely charged the two (2)
hands of the Flow Indicator Gauge should coincide and the audible blow
should cease. Indicating that the train Is ready for an examiner's brake
test. No attempt should be made to carry out this test until the signal
has ceased and the hands of the gauge equalise.
The state of charge of the auxiliary reservoirs on the train is
also indicated by the relative position of the two hands of the Flow
Indicator G-auge. The amount of recharge following each application can
be estimated by the position of the hands of the gauge and this condition
offers a useful indication to the driver when traversing long falling
grades.
NOTE: On the "AjO" class Diesel Electric Locomotives brake pipe
indicator, giving an audible indication only, was originally fitted and
will not at present be replaced by the later device known as the Flow-
meter Valve.
35-3 Testing the Flow-meter Valve.
During the preparation of the engine, it is the driver's duty to
test the flow-meter and see that it is functioning correctly.
To do this:-
1, Place the automatic brake valve handle in "running" position,
charging brake pipe to the setting of the slide valve feed
valve. Check that both hands on the flow-meter gauge agree
and there is no blow from the warning port.
2. Hake a service application with the automatic brake, reducing
brake—pipe pressure to 50 lb. and then lap the brake valve
handle.
3* After allowing time for pressure to equalise, place the brake
valve handle in "running" position,
if. An audible blow should be given from the warning port and one
black hand on the gauge should fall towards zero and then rise
and coincide with the other hand and the warning blow should
cease.
Should it be found during preparation that the flow-meter is
defective, the driver must enter same in the repair book and the defective
flow-meter changed by the mechanical staff*
When the locomotive with the defective flow-meter is the only one
available to work the train and a spare flow-meter is not available at
the depot concerned; the following instructions will apply:-


Should a double-ended locomotive be involved with a faulty flow-
meter at one end, the unit shall be turned if necessary and depart from
a depot so that the end with the effective flow-meter shall be marshalled
leading on the train
When a locomotive without an operative flow-meter is used to haul
a train, preference shall be given to it being rostered on short trains
where possible, and enginemen should exercise special care in handling
the train so as to ensure against drawgear breakage. After arrival at
a depot where spare flow-meters are available, the locomotive shall not
be used for train working again until the faulty item is replaced with
one which functions correctly,
36-3 G-rade Control Valve Operation.
When a train is proceeding down a heavy grade, and a brake ap-
plication is made, it is necessary to release the brakes in order to
obtain a recharge of the auxiliary reservoirs. When this release is
made the train immediately accelerates and a limited time only is avail-
able for recharging before a brake application is again required. For
this reason it is necessary to stop the train and apply hand brakes before
commencing the descent. The application of the hand brakes reduces the
rate of acceleration of the train during the period the air brake is
released thus allows a greater time for recharging the auxiliary reser-
voirs. This method of operation has certain disadvantages due to wear
of brake blocks, etc., and the same effect can be brought about more
satisfactorily by maintaining a minimum pressure in the brake cylinders.
This is accomplished by means of the G-rade Control Valve which is set
to its operating position prior to descent of the grade.
The grade control valve provides greater control over goods trains
on heavy falling grades and enables increased loads to be taken without
the use of hand brakes.
This valve is located on the underframe of goods vehicles with the
exception of brake vans, is connected by a pipe to the triple valve ex-
haust passage; the exhaust nipple of the triple valve is removed and
fitted to the grade control valve and all air exhausting to the atmos-
phere from the brake cylinder is controlled in accordance with the
setting of this valve. It is operated manually from either side of the
vehicle and has three handle positions which are distinctly marked in
the following manner;-
(i) E.X. indicating Normal Exhaust position,
(ii) I.P. indicating Intermediate position.
(iii) H.P, indicating High Pressure position.
(i) E.X, Normal Exhaust position. This is the normal position
when not in use, the handle is pointing vertically downward,
the brake cylinder pressure is exhausted from 50 lbs. to
10 lbs, square inch in 6 seconds, which is governed by the


size of the triple valve exhaust nipple, with AJ, triple valves
it is somewhat slower,
(ii) I.P, Intermediate Pressure position. This is for light grades and
for empty or lightly loaded vehicles on heavy grades and allows
the whole of the air in the brake cylinder to exhaust slowly to
atmosphere. With the valve set in this position the handle is
pointing either to the right or left in a horizontal direction;
after a full application, the time for the reduction of brake
cylinder pressure is increased from 6 seconds to 55 seconds.
(iii) H.P, High Pressure position. This is for heavy falling grades and
the handle is pointed in a vertically upward direction and the time
for the reduction of brake cylinder pressure will be increased from
6 to 105 seconds and 7 lb, square inch of air pressure will be
retained in the brake cylinder.
NOTE: When vehicles fitted with load-compensating equipment are marshalled
on trains working under grade control valve operation, such
vehicles shall have the grade control valve handles placed in the
intermediate position at the location specified for the setting
of the grade control valves.
37-3 Load Compensating Air Brake Equipment.
With convential application of air brake equipment to freight
vehicles it is necessary to limit the braking percentage of the vehicle
to such a degree as will prevent it being over-braked when empty, the
braking percentage being defined as the total load on the brake shoes with
50 lbs. per square inch in the brake cylinder, expressed as a percentage
ratio of the tare weight of the vehicle.
Where vehicles have a high gross load to tare ratio this braking
percentage is considerably reduced, and in consequence the braking of a
train of loaded vehicles presents more difficulties than is the case with
empty vehicles. For example, assuming a vehicle has a tare weight of 20
tons and is braked at 755, the total load on the brake shoes would be 15
tons. If the vehicle is now loaded with an additional 40 tons making a
gross load of 60 tons, the braking percentage is reduced to 15/60 x
ICO/1 = 25$ as compared with 75$ for the empty vehicle.
The purpose of this equipment is to use normal braking forces when
the vehicle is empty, but to provide additional braking force when the
vehicle is loaded, thus compensating to a large extent for the reduction
in braking efficiency, due to the load, which occurs in vehicles not so
equipped.
This is accomplished by the provision of a larger brake cylinder
than is normally used, to which is connected, through an isolating cock,
an additional volume reservoir. This isolating cock is opened or closed
by a change over mechanism, which may be operated from each side of the
vehicle, and allows the volume reservoir mentioned to be connected to, or


isolated from, the brake cylinder,
(B) OPERATING INSTRUCTION.
(A) When vehicles fitted with load-compensating equipment are empty
or the gross load as indicated by the truck label, is lass than
one and a half times the tare weight of the vehicle, the operating
handle shall be placed in the "empty" or "E" (lower) position and
maintained in that position at all times the vehicle is in motion
under such load conditions,
(B) When vehicles fitted with load-compensating equipment are loaded
to the extent that the gross load, as indicated by the truck
label, is one and a half times the tare weight of the vehicle or
more, the operating handle shall be placed in the "loaded" of "L"
(upper) position and maintained in that position while the vehicle
is in motion.
(C) At terminals, or other location where the vehicles are unloaded,
when the load is reduced to the point where the gross load is one
and a half times the tare weight of the vehicle or less, the
operating handle shall be changed to the "empty" or "E" position
before the vehicle is again moved,
(D) It shall be the responsibility of the employee controlling the
movements of the vehicle concerned to ensure that the operating
handle of the load-compensating equipment is in the correct
position for the load conditions at all times,
(E) When vehicles fitted with load-compensating equipment are marshalled
on trains and a brake test is carried out in accordance with the
regulations, it shall be the responsibility of the employee carrying
out such brake test to ensure that the operating handle of the
load-compensating equipment is in its correct position for the load
conditions of the vehicle,
(P) Should it be noted by the staff at anytime that the operating
handle is in the incorrect position for the load conditions, the
handle shall be immediately placed in its correct position,
(&) Care shall be taken by the staff to see that these instructions are
carried out in their entirety to avoid damage to the wheels of the
vehicle concerned, and delays to trains.
(H) Should any defect be noted in the operation of the load-compensating
equipment it shall be repaired by the employee competent to do so.
If, however, when marshalled on a train and time does not permit
of such repair being carried out, an Air Brake Defect Card, showing
the nature of the defect, shall be affixed to the vehicle.
(l) Every effort shall be made to avoid cutting out the brakes on
vehicles fitted with load-compensating equipment and where possible,
defects shl be rectified before such vehicles are marshalled on
trains.


38-3 Vehiclea Provided with Air Pressure Water Service.
The following instructions are to be observed in connection with
the filling of water tanks on vehicles which are provided with air-
pressure water service 1
pnarTTOW OF WATER TAKES ON VEHICLES:
The water tanks are fixed under the body of the vehicle. Certain
special oars are equipped with additional water tanks fixed inside the
body of the vehicle,
inPTHnn O? VTLLIN& THE WATER TANKS:
(1) Turn the three-way combination cock, which is situated near the
water tank, so that the "saw-out" is in the horizontal (filling)
position. See Diagram "A" hereafter,
(2) Insert the hose in one of the brass filling caps (two of which are
provided, one on either side of the vehicle),
(3) Turn on the water and continue the filling until water is discharged
from the overflow pipe, then remove the hosepipe from the filxer.
To avoid water getting into the air operating valves, the overflow
from the pipe at the bottom of the three-way cook must in all
cases be allowed to stop before the operating handle is placed in
the service position,
(4) Turn the three-way combination cock until the "saw-cut" is in the
vertical (or service) position. See Diagram "B" hereafter. It
is specially Important that this latter be done after each filling
or otherwise the water will not be connected to the service mains
under pressure.
When the tanka have been filled, operate the flushing valve in the
W,C. compartment until water is obtained, thereby releasing the air in
the water pipes.
Special vehicles, such as dining and other cars, fitted with inside
tanks, are, in the first instance, to be filled in the same manner as
described in (l), (2), (3) and (4), then after the lower tanks are full,
the inside tanks should be filled by opening the cock attached thereto.




When the latter tanks are full, the cock should be returned to its normal
position and the operation of filling the lower tanks repeated until they
are again full,
PUMP FOR EMERGENCY USE.
A hand-pump is provided in some vehicles for emergency use when
air is not available in the train.
To operate the pump, open the cock provided, and pump in the usual
manner until the gauge registers at least 4 lb., then close the cock,
VEHICLES FITTED WITH TWO (2) AIR BRAKE CYLINDERS.
Should it be necessary, from any cause, to cut out one of the
brake cylinders on vehicles equipped with air-pressure water service
and two air brake cylinders are provided in addition to closing the
triple valve isolating cock, the isolating cock must also be closed on
the pipe connecting the auxiliary air reservoir to the water service,
so as to prevent the air passing from one auxiliary air reservoir to
the other. This is necessary to enable the brakes to be released.
Complete details of the air pressure water service as fitted to
coaching stock are shown on diagram herein, and a full description on
operation is given under Item 46-3 on page 51.
39-3 Automatic Slack Adjuster,
The automatic slack adjuster is an apparatus attached to the back
of the brake cylinder on certain vehicles for maintaining a regular
brake piston travel.
In the event of the brakes automatically taking up too tightly,
it will be necessary to take action as follows:
First see that the air is released from the brake cylinder, then
attach a spanner to the adjusting nut, which is about 12 inches long,
and shown on the diagram herein as "A" "ratchet nut", give it one-half
clockwise to release the internal pawl, and then two turns anti-clockwise
to release the brake.
Automatic Slack Adjuster.


40-3 The Dead Engine Device.
The dead engine device is for the purpose of allowing the main
reservoir of a dead engine, or an engine on which the compressor has
failed, to he charged with air from the brake pipe of an assisting engine.
If it were not for this device the brakes on the dead engine would be
inoperative.
On attaching the assistant engine to the dead engine (the one on
which the compressor is inoperative, but on which the main reservoir
and its connections are capable of holding pressure) the driver's brake
valve isolating cock on the latter engine shall be closed, both brake
valve handles placed in "running" position and the "dead engine" device
brought into operation.
This device is attached to the distributing valve and the cook
should be opened by placing the handle to point towards the distributing
valve safety valve,
NOTEj All other times this cook should be closed, i,e., with the
cook handle pointing towards the brake pipe connection in the distributing
valve.
Under these conditions of operation there will be insufficient
pressure in the main reservoir of the "dead engine" for the efficient
operation of all the air operated devices.
It should be noted, that, in the design of the "dead engine"
device, a choke is fitted to restrict the flow of air and the check valve
is loaded with a spring to give 15 lb. differential pressure in a similar
manner to the original excess pressure valve, i,e,, with a brakepipe
pressure of 75 lb, the main reservoir pressure is limited to 60 lb, which
is suitable for bpaking purposes and is designedly restricted to this
figure. Should the check valve become defective from any cause and the
brakepipe pressure be reduced to 60 lb, by a brake application, any higher
(main) reservoir pressure would leak into the brakepipe and possibly
release the brakes on the train hence the necessity for restricting
the pressure in the main reservoir and the fitting of the choke.
In addition to the air brake system on the engine and tender the
undermentioned devices on 38 class locomotives are operated by air from
the main reservoirs-
Whistle valve.
Cylinder cocks.
Sand gear.
Plrehole door.
Precision reversing gear.


The air operated sand gear and cylinder cocks on 60 class
locomotives are fitted with isolating cocks.
There are no isolating cocks fitted between the main reservoir, and
the cylinder cocks, the whistle valve in the cab, and the high pressure
head of the compressor governor on a 38 class locomotive.
Isolating cocks are provided on the 38 class, for the firehole door,
sanding valves, and precision reversing gear respectively and they are loca-
ted adjacent to the main reservoir.
Before departing, both drivers must satisfy themselves that the
regulation brake pipe pressure is registered on the air gauge of each
engine and that there is not less than 50 lb. pressure in the main reser-
voir of the locomotive on which the "dead engine" device is in operation.
In addition, prior to departure, a test shall be carried out to
determine that a brake application from the leading engine is effective
on the "dead engine" and its tender. The following precautions must also
be observed. The driver of the "dead engine" must secure the cylinder
cocks in the closed position by removing the cock rods and placing the
operating handle in the backward position to isolate the main reservoir air
supply.
The firehole door and precision reversing gear shall be isolated
at the main reservoir and manually operated,
NOTE; Before the cylinder cock rods are removed, care must be taken to see
that all water is drained from the cylinders and steam chests.
The whistle valve which cannot be isolated, is only to be used in
case of an emergency. Similarly, the sand gear isolating cock shall be
retained in the "open" position, so that the sands can be operated in the
event of an emergency,
41-3 Servicing of Through Passenger Locomotives.
Per the information of all concerned, the following is the recog-
nised procedure to be applied where locomotives working through passenger
services are required to be reconditioned at inteirnediate points where
enginemen are changed.
In all such cases, the incoming driver is required to attend to
the oiling and examining of the left-hand side of the engine, whilst the
outgoing driver performs this work on the right-hand side. Any attention
required underneath the engine is to be performed by the outgoing driver,
who will also satisfy himself that the tender tank has been replenished.
Where water is taken, it is the duty of the incoming Fireman to
attend to the filling of the tender tank whilst the outgoing Fireman
attends to the fire. In addition, the requisite staff is to be made
available, where necessary, to attend to the shovelling forward of coal


and de-ashing.
Where time permits, both the incoming and outgoing enginemen are
to be allowed ten (10) minutes within which to perform their respective
duties. In other instances, where the schedule provides for less than
ten (10) minutes at intermediate points where enginemen are changed, and
they are required to attend to the reconditioning of engines working
through passenger trains, both the incoming and the outgoing enginemen
are to be allowed the available time, i.e., where eight (8) minutes
standing time is provided per timetable, this will represent the allowance
to enginemen,
42-3 Attaching or Detaching Pilot Engines.
At locations where locomotives are relayed and/or where pilot
engines are attached, the brake pipe should be blown down to an equalised
application before the train engine or pilot engine is detached, and
continuity regulations must be fully observed in the attachment of train
engines and/or pilot engines before departure. Brake drag on vehicles of
a train immediately after attaching or detaching engines will point very
strongly towards the driver's responsibility and indicates failure to have
earned out the correct routine as detailed.
4-3-3 Inspection of Train Enroute.
Both driver and fireman must methodically and periodically inspect
the train every 10 miles for symptoms of sticking triple valves and/or
hot axle bearings and take prompt action when such defects become apparent.
Co-operation of enginemen in adhering to the foregoing instructions
in conjunction with the Westinghouse air brake regulations, should reduce
the large number of brakes sticking and skidded wheel cases and also
assist in the early detection of hot axle bearings.
44-~3 Steam Heating Equipment on Locomotives and Carriages.
The following instructions are for the guidance of locomotive
When re( l uired to operate steam heating equipment during winter
Coupling of the Locomotive to the Train.
When coupling to the train the steam heating hoses should be
coupied to the train prior to the air brake hosepipes. Care should be
en to see that both end stop valves on the tender and train are in the
closed position before the steam heating hosepipes are removed from their
c ° u P lin gs and connected. When the hoses have been coupled the clips
provi ed on each coupling head must be secured in position. When the
coupling operation has been carried out and the coupling clips properly
secured, both end stop valves should be opened and Le driver aSd that
coupling has been completed. naT:


On receiving this advice, and NOT BEFORE, the driver should open
the steam supply valve in the cab allowing steam to flow into the train*
After waiting a period of time to allow the train to be completely
charged with steam the reducing valve of the steam heating equipment should,
if necessary, be then adjusted so that 45 lb. per square inch pressure
is maintained on the steam heating pressure gauge, and this adjustment
should be checked periodically during the journey. The adjustment of
the reducing valve is carried out by altering the spring tension, by
means of the hand wheel provided on the upper portion of the reducing
valve.
Train Parting or Breaking Away.
In the event of the train parting, the driver should at once close
the steam heating stop valve in the cab to prevent waste of steam, and the
possibility of injuring, by scalding, to any employee engaged in re-couplxng
the train. It is probable, that in the event of such a breakaway, one
or both hoses at the point of parting will be damaged, and these should
be removed and replaced with the spare hosepipes.
Visibility at Platforms (Effect of Exhaust Steam)
Should visibility be affected at platforms due to excessive exhaust
of steam from the carriage heaters, the steam supply valve in the engine
cab should be temporarily closed. In a steam heated train of average
length the exhausts will cease in about 45 seconds from the time when this
valve is shut. Care should be taken to ensure this valve is re-opened after
starting.
If visibility is badly affected, this is generally an indication
that heater controls require adjusting, and the matter should be reported
to the officer-in-charge at the stabling depot, who will then arrange to
forward immediate advice to the Westinghouse Brake Engineer, Chief
Mechanical Engineer's Office, Redfem,
Defects Developing Enroute.
Should any defect develop in running, such as bad leakage in the
steam train pipe, burst or damaged steam hose coupling, etc., the steam
supply valve should be closed, and the defect remedied at the first avail-
able stopping place. Branch pipes to heaters are of copper and should brea-
kage occur during the journey the copper pipe should be flattened, thus
isolating the heater involved. If the defect cannot be remedied, the end
valve immediately in front of the defective carriage should be closed, and
steam supplied to this point.
Spare Hosepipes for Steam Heating.
Two (2) spare hoses are provided in the back box of the engines
equipped for steam heating; the terminal hose on the last vehicle on
trains fitted with steam heating can also be used should the need arise.


Uncoupling of the Locomotives from the Train.
-- When the engine at the termination of journey first shut
ff steam in cab to reducing valve; then ensure that the end stop valves
on rear of tender and front of train are closed. Uncouple steam heating
hosepipes, and couple to their respective dummy couplings.
The engine should be stabled with the steam stop valve in the
cab closed.
Carriage Steam Heating Equipment.
Steam heating equipment on carriages consist ofj-
t S i nCh 3team train pipe suitabl y lagged and with a continuous
all from each end of the car towards the centre,
(2) A steam trap and_ separator provided at the central (lowest) point
of the steam train pipe to eliminate condensed water,
(3) End stop valve at each end of the car to enable the isolation of
each car in the event of failure of a steam train pipe.
NOIEj On close-coupled car sets the end stop valves on intermediate
cars are dispensed with, and are provided on the terminal ends of
the car set only.
(4) Steam hose couplings between each car on the opposite side of the
drawgear from the air brake hose pipe,
(5) Lagged branch pipes from the main steam train pipe to heaters in
each compartment,
(6) Radiators or heaters under each seat in the corridor carriages, and
radiating pipes in the saloon compartments,
(7) Mechanically operated heat controls in each compartment in corridor
carriages to be manually operated by passengers. Radiators and
radiating pipe in saloon compartments controlled by a key or a hand
wheel on the end of the controlling heater,
(8) Suitable baffles around heaters to assist in the correct heat
distribution.
(9) Dummy couplings, to which the steam heating hose pipes are to be
coupled when not in use.


45-3 Steam Heating of Trains.
Description of Operation.
Steam from the locomotive at 45 lb. per square inch pressure enters
the train by hosepipes on the leading end, and traverses the entire length
of the steam heated portion of the train to the rear end stop valve, which
should be in the closed position.
Until pipes are heated there is a quantity of water condensed in
the pipes, which is eliminated by means of the steam traps provided at
the lowest points of the train pipe system. These steam traps operate
by means of a semi-circular shaped expansion tube which controls ther-
mostatically the opening or closing of a valve to the atmosphere. When
water is present the tube contracts and opens a drain valve permitting the
water to flow to the atmosphere. When the water is eliminated and steam
commences to flow, the tube expands and closes the drain valve until
further water has accumulated.
Steam is fed via the branch pipes to individual heaters, which form
radiators in each compartment. These heaters take the form of a steel
tube of 5 inch diameter, generally 5 feet, 9 inches long, with suitable
end brackets, A brass tube is mounted inside each heater and is fixed
at one end. The other end is provided with a valve head, an adjustable
valve seat being also provided in the end bracket at this point.
When steam is first admitted to the heater, the latter is cold and
the valve, therefore, is off its seat, admitting steam via a inch choke.
The end bracket opposite that of steam admission is connected
directly to the atmosphere through a suitable drain pipe} as the heater
warms- up it expands, but due to the greater expansion of the central brass
tube the valve mounted on the latter closes off the admission of steam,
the temperature at which this occurs being affected by the relative
location of the valve and valve seat. The position of the valve seat is
determined by the rotation of the control lever on the heater end bracket,
this being operated by the sliding control rod provided in each compartment
The temperature at which the heater is maintained is, therefore,
controlled by the location of the steam valve seat, which in turn is
controlled by the operating rod and handle in each compartment.
In saloon compartments where a steam radiating pipe is used in con-
junction with a suitable heater, the control is affected by a key or by a
hand wheel provided on the end bracket of the heater.
As heaters are connected to the atmosphere via the drain pipes
steam is at atmospheric pressure with a maximum temperature of 212 degrees
fahrenheit.


Preparation and Examination of Trains for Steam Heating.
Prior to the locomotive being coupled to the train, it shall be the
responsibility of the Traffic staff to ensure thatj-
(l) All carriage windows and doors are closed, including compartment
doors.
(2) All heater controls are placed in the full "ON" position.
It shall be the responsibility of the Train Examiners to see thatj-
(a) All steam heating hose couplings between carriages are properly
coupled and coupling clips secured.
(b) All steam end stop valves throughout the train are in the open
position, except that on the leading end of the carriage, which will
be coupled to the locomotive, and that on the rear of the last
carriage fitted with steam heating, both of which should be in the
closed position.
(c) The last steam heating hose coupling on the train is properly fitted
to its dummy coupling.
After the engine has been coupled to the train, and steam supplied,
it should be noted that there is no excessive steam leakage on the steam
line or branch pipes, and that the steam traps on each carriage are dis-
charging water correctly. This should be observed when the brake test
is being carried out.
Should any defect be detected during this examination which cannot
be remedied in the time available, a repair card should be placed on the
vehicle clearly setting out the nature of the defect, and a wire despatched
to the next suitable examining station.
Should it be necessary for any reason to uncouple a steam heating
hosepipe when the engine is attached to the train, care must be taken to
ensure that the end stop valves adjacent to the hosepipes concerned are
closed,
General,
Trains equipped for steam heating are required to be run as block
sets, and should it be necessaiy to attach additional carriages, these must
in all cases be attached in the rear of the last vehicle fitted for steam
heating. No vehicle shall be interposed between the locomotive and the
tram unless such vehicle is also equipped for steam heating.
When uncoupling vehicles from steam heated trains, it should be
ensured that the steam heating and air brake hosepipes, are properly un-
coupled, and in the case of steam heating hosepipes, they are to be secured
to their dummy couplings, before any attempt is made to separate the cars.


Damage to end stop valves and steam heating hoses will occur if this
is not carried out.
On certain trains it may he necessary for the locomotive to be
attached in advance of its usual time, for the purpose of pre-heating
the carriages, and at locations approaching the termination of the journey
the steam supply from the locomotives will be shut off in order to lower
compartment temperatures prior to arrival.
4 6-3 AIR PRESSURE WATER SERVICE UNITS AS FITTED TO MAIN LIKE PASSENGER
ROLLING STOCK AND DIESEL TRAINS.
General Description.
The air pressure water service fitted to main line rolling stock
and Diesel Trailer cars is operated by the action of low pressure com-
pressed air on the surface of water in a suitable container, forcing the
water to the desired points in the carriage. The air is taken off the
pipe connection between the triple valve and auxiliary reservoir in the
case of main line rolling stock and from the main reservoir in the case
of Diesel Trailer cars. From the points mentioned, the air required for
water service purposes is allowed to feed through the water service isolat-
ing cock and dust collector to the water service control unit in which is
incorporated a governor valve, reducing valve, check and relief valves.
Governor Valve.
Compressed air feeding to the water service control unit as descri-
bed passes through the governor valve. This valve has two functions:
first, it is fitted with a diaphragm valve which opens only when the
auxiliary reservoir or main reservoir (Diesel) has been fed with air to a
pressure satisfactory for brake application purposes. The second function
of the governor valve is to prevent the air feeding back from the water
service into the brake system. This is accomplished by means of a check
valve with 'Waboo' seating, situated in the upper part of the governor
valve body.
It will be noted from the foregoing that the governor valve is inten-
ded to protect the braking system from being detrimentally influenced from
the water service system.
Reducing Valve.
From the governor valve the air is fed into a high pressure air res-
ervoir which acts as an air storage volume for the periods when the brake
pipe or main reservoir air pressure is not available. On some Diesel
Trailer cars, however, no high pressure reservoir is employed. The air
next passes to the reducing valve, this valve reduces the air pressure by
means of a spring loaded diaphragm valve.
Check and Relief Valves.
The air is now fed from the reducing valve, through the check valve


to be finally stoned with, the water in the low pressure service reservoir.
The check valve is a non-return valve which prevents scale or water return-
ing to the control unit from the low pressure air reservoir. The relief
valve allows pressure in excess of that applying in the low pressure
reservoir to escape to the atmosphere in the case of a failure of the
reducing valve.
Three Way Cock.
A three way cock is placed adjacent to the low pressure service
reservoir* This cock is provided to facilitate the filling of the low
pressure reservoir with water.
With the handle in the vertical position, i.e., for operating the
service, compressed air has access from the control unit to the top of
water stored in the reservoir and the water has access to delivery pipes
throughout the vehicle.
The handle, when placed in the horizontal position, shuts off the
entry of air pressure to the top of the water and allows the air pressure
in the reservoir to escape to the atmosphere. At the same time, the
filling pipes are connected to the reservoir through the passage in the
three way cock, and through this passage the water supply passes when re-
plenished from the filling points.
G-eneral.
Two air gauges are mounted on the side of the underframe marked H*P.
and L.P. showing the pressure in the high pressure (air) and low pressure
(service) reservoirs respectively.
Various isolating cocks are provided throughout the system to facili-
tate the isolation of portions of the equipment for adjustment in workshops
without considerable loss of air.
Defects in Water Service.
There are three (3) defects which are perhaps likely to develop in
the water service system. These are outlined and explained hereunder:-
Nc water in system.
To test for this, open any tap or flushing cock and note whether air
only passes out of the tap. If this is so, it is an indication that the
water requires replenishing in the low pressure (service) reservoir.
The emptying of the system may be due to a water tap or flushing cock
in a compartment or lavatory being stuck open allowing all the water to flow
out of low pressure (service) reservoir. The defective tap or cock must
then be located and remedied or isolated.


If no water or air is obtained through the tap and the low press-
ure gauge shows correct pressure, this indicates a pipe blockage which
may be at the water strainer in the low pressure (service) reservoir.
To remedy, clean the strainer by removing the plug provided.
Air pressure too low.
If a satisfactory flow of water is not obtained, this may be due
to the air pressure in the low pressure (service) reservoir being below
the required pressure of 15 lb, per sq. in. This fact will be indicated
by the low pressure gauge (marked L.P. on car) and may be caused by the
reducing valve being incorrectly adjusted, defective or excessive air
leakage in the piping or three way cock, or insufficient pressure in the
high pressure reservoir.
In the event of no leakage existing and the high pressure gauge
showing a higher pressure than 15 lb. per sq, in. this indicates that
reducing valve is defective and the unit should be changed.
If the air pressure in the high pressure reservoir as indicated
on the gauge is less than 15 lb. per sq, in, this indicates that the
governor valve is defective, horsehair strainer is blocked, water ser-
vice isolating cock is closed or, for some other reason, air is not
being fed from the auziliary or main reservoir. It may also indicate
a bad leak in the high pressure air piping or reservoir.
It should be remembered that the governor valve will not open
unless over 60 lb, per sq. in 7 pressure exists in the auxiliary or main
reservoir, and it is necessary to ensure that there is a higher pressure
than this before testing. This pressure can be ascertained on the gauge
fitted to the guard*s control cocks, provided the triple valve is in the
"Release" position at the time.
To test the governor ensure that the brake pipe pressure is over
60 lb, per sq. in, open the release valve on the auxiliary reservoir to
ensure that the triple valve is feeding air and close the isolating cock
on the high pressure air reservoir. If the high pressure gauge shows
a quick feed up of pressure, this indicates that the governor valve is
acting correctly. If no feed up of pressure, this shows a defective
governor valve or blocked air strainer. If the air strainer is clear,
which can be checked by removing the bottom cap, the governor valve is
defective, and the control unit should be changed.
The high pressure reservoir isolating cock must always be left
open except when testing for a defective governor.
Air pressure too high,
A pressure above the requirements of 151 b. per sq, in, in the low
pressure (service) reservoir could indicate a defective reducing valve
or low pressure gauge. In the case of cars fitted with an internal
water measuring device such equipment should be isolated before testing.


service unit. If the reducing valve is found to be defective, the complete
control unit should be changed,
general.
In general, no pressure in the high pressure reservoir shows a defect-
ive governor and no pressure in the low pressure (service reservoir shows a
defective reducing valve.
Should the water service be inoperative due to the air brake on the
vehicle having been cut out, the following procedure shall be adopted by
the employee examining the vehicle whilst attached to a train.
Open the triple valve isolating cock and recharge the auxiliary reser-
voir, Open the water service isolating cock (adjacent to the unit) and
replenish the air supply in the high pressure reservoir until at least 60 lb,
per sq. in, is showing on the H.P. gauge. Close both isolating cocks,
(i.e. to triple valve and water service) drain the auxiliary reservoir by
means of the release valve. The release valve should be secured in the open
position in order that the auxiliary reservoir cannot again be recharged.
In such cases it shall be the duty of the employee by whom the air
brake is cut out to wire ahead to each examining station concerned that
action must be taken to replenish the air supply in the water service system
of the vehicle concerned in accordance with the foregoing.
Whenever any defect in the water service unit becomes apparent, the
whole unit must be changed at the first available opportunity. No adjust-
ments are to be made by the running staff as it is essential that these
units be dealt with by workshop staff only. In cases where a change of
water service unit is necessary, the depot concerned must forward the defect-
ive unit to the Carriage Works Store, Eveleigb and advise Room 20 Redfern
when it has been so despatched.
Only under conditions of absolute emergency must the seals be broken
and adjustments attempted by examining or running staff and, if such case
should arise, a full report must be made by the employee concerned and for-
warded to the Westinghouse Brake Engineer, The Outdoor Rolling Stock Super-
intendent, Sydney Yard, must be advised by wire at once and that Officer
will arrange for the unit to be changed on arrival at Sydney,
All water service control units are interchangeable and may be removed
by disconnecting the pipe unions at the governor valve, the tee piece to the
high pressure reservoir, the check valve and by removing the four bolts hold-
ing the wooden base plate to the bracket. All air pipe connections after
the horsehair strainer are of copper pipe and brass compression fittings.
Allotment of Spare Water Service Control Units.
It has been decided that spare water service control units must be
held at the following depots in order that any irregularity experienced
under running conditions may be overcome by a change of control unit in

1- Introduction
This section deals with the rules and regulations that are most
essential for enginemen to be familiar with, for the successful working
of trains ‘under the exacting conditions that are required in modern
locomotive practice*
Successful train operation is governed by quite a number of factors,
but the safe running and efficient working of the train depends almost
entirely on the driver and the extent of his knowledge on safe working
and engine management*
A careful study of the regulations contained herein should place the
driver in a position where he can quickly deal with any difficulty that
may arise and enable him to use the best methods possible to overcome
delays in train working.
Train Working Instructions.
2- Punctual working of trains*
Drivers must assist to forward the Traffic by smart handling of their
engines and ready response to signals.
Eveiy endeavour should be made to regain lost time, but engines
should not be worked unduly heavy to do so. Where the load is below the
capacity of the engine, the train should be accelerated on rising gradients
and practically level portions of the road without exceeding such speed
limits as apply to the class of engine, vehicles of the train, or permanent
way.
3- Delays to Goods and Passenger trains enroute.
Instances have come under notice where serious delays to G-oods and
Passenger trains have taken place consequent upon defects developing on
engines enroute, definite particulars not having been furnished concerning
the nature of the defect and the approximate time that will elapse before
the locomotive can be moved.
The Telephone Train Control System is in operation over a considerable
portion of the lines and the Control Officers determine what train move-
ments are to be made when such irregularities occur, with trains running
out of course.
Traffic Officers at stations have been largely relied upon to afford
information to the Control Officer when a breakdown or other irregularity
occurs. It is felt, however, that the driver and fireman in the case of a
locomotive that has become wholly or partially disabled could, in most
cases, afford definite information to Station Officers respecting the
probable delay, so that the necessary action could be taken to expedite
SECTION 4*
INSTBUCTIONS APPLICABLE TO TRAIN VORKIN&.


the traffic.
Where it can be readily done without incurring additional delay,
drivers should get in touch with the Locomotive Superintendent, (Running),
or the District Locomotive Engineer in country areas, as the case may be,
acquaint these Officers with the position and obtain any necessary
directions for dealing with disabled engines.
Engine crews are to promptly co-operate with the Traffic Officer
in order that the best possible arrangements may be made to reduce delays
to a minimum and facilitate the restoration of normal services,
4- Trains failing to stop as tabled.
Serious complaints emanate from and inconvenience is occasioned to,
the travelling public by drivers failing to stop trains at stations in
accordance with the working timetable.
Drivers are directed to pay special attention to this phase of
train working by careful reference to timetables and by conferring with
the Guard.
5- Bank Engine Working.
Drivers of bank engines must exercise special care in handling
their engines in order to avoid damage to buffers and risk of derailment.
The engine should be taken on to the train carefully and when running over
easy portions of the road where little or no assistance is required, the
bank engine should be kept against the buffers of the brake van and on no
account allowed to fall away from the train.
When assisting on steep grades, the work of the two engines should
be as evenly divided as possible,
6- Operating Automatic Staff Exchangers.
The automatic staff exchanger is in use on Up and Down Express
trains between Junee and Albury, and on specified trains between West
Maitland and Glen-app. When preparing to exchange, care must be taken
to ensure that the sling is properly inserted in the receptacle on the
engine exchanger with the ring standing vertical and square with the side
of the engine. Exchanging may be carried out at speeds up to the maximum
laid down for the section of the line, but drivers are informed that the
exchanger does not work to the best advantage at low speeds, so that, when
possible, speeds of 20 miles per hour or less should be avoided when
exchanging.
When lowering the apparatus on the engine into position for
exchanging, care must be exercised to ensure that it is correctly placed,
but violent contact with the stop block must be avoided.


7- Boiler Priming.
Boiler priming is one of the most objectionable features in
locomotive working and results in extensive damage by fracturing
cylinder covers and loosening piston heads, also washing the lub-
rication from the valve chambers and cylinder walls, causing additional
coal consumption and inefficiency of the engine with consequent train
delays •
Priming is sometimes due to englnemen carrying excessive water
in the boiler.
When heavy trains are being worked over ascending grades priming
can be considerably minimised if the boiler pressure is kept below
the blowing off point and the engine worked with a longer valve travel
and partial opening of the throttle valve.
In addition to the regular practice of washing out boilers, the
proper use of the blow-down valve, in accordance with the standing
instructions, will minimise priming due to feed water conditions.
8- Renewal of G-auge Glasses.
In the event of a gauge glass breaking, it is necessary to cone
to a stand and replace the broken gauge glass to ensure the safety
of the boiler.
When two water gauge columns are fitted, if one glass should
break, proceed until a suitable opportunity offers to replace same,
being careful to frequently test the remaining glass to ensure that
the correct water level is showing.
However, if both glasses should fall, stop and renew one glass
before proceeding.
When renewing a gauge glass packed with conical washers, care
must be taken to see that the cone is entered into the packing recess,
with the flat flanged end outwards. A brass washer is placed between
the rubber washer and gland nut.
It may not be necessary to change the rubber washers when re-
newing gauge glass en route or away from the Depot, The existing
washers, which are loose in the packing recess, should come away readily
with the ends of the broken glass, from which they may be easily
removed, and quite freely placed in position on the new glass, provided
they are in good condition.
9- staff to be carried in Receptacle Provided.
In order to avoid damage and to safeguard the staff whilst in
the possession cf englnemen, it must be carried in the receptacle
provided in the engine cab.


10- Hand Signal lamp to be alight,
When working through tunnels, or during darkness, exiginemen
should have their hand signal lamp alight and ready for Immediate use,
particularly when working on double lines.
11- Unauthorised persons not permitted on Locomotives.
Drivers and firemen must not allow any unauthorised person to
ride on a locomotive.
Drivers must not permit unauthorised persons to take charge of
the locomotive and It should be specially noted that Running Inspectors
who are empowered to take charge of locomotives for the purpose of
demonstrating or imparting Instruction to enginemen, or for any other
special purpose, have the requisite authority in the form of an endorse-
ment on their book passes as foIIows-
"AUTHORISED TO TAKE CHARGE OP ENGINE"
Before a Driver permits the officers indicated to take charge
of his locomotive for the purposes enumerated, he must satisfy himself
that they have the necessary authority.
Disregard of these instructions will be very seriously viewed,
12- Hot Boxes on Locomotives and Vehicles.
The back box of each tender is equipped with a tin containing
oil-soaked wool to be used for the purpose of packing axle-boxes which
have become overheated on engines, tenders, carriages or wagons as
required,
When placing the wool in an axle-box it must be packed as
tightly as possible, being pressed in with a convenient tool, such as
a hammer handle or the end of a spanner.
The wool does not contain any free oil and it will therefore
be necessary to apply additional oil when the box has been packed.
Care must be taken to ensure that the Journal is sufficiently cool
before the wool is packed in the box, so that there will be no pos-
sibility of it catching on fire.
In the event of a hot box occurring on a vehicle attached to
a train, the box is to be packed with the oil-soaked wool provided,
then re—oiled in order to obviate serious damage to the journal. The
vehicle should be worked into a depot station for further attention.
Should the box continue to heat unduly, the vehicle is to be detached
at the nearest convenient point.


A tool is provided in the hack box for removing the lubricator
caps; also for withdrawal of the defective lubricator.
1 3- Defects in Roller-bearing Axle-boxes fitted to Rolling Stock.
Should any defect to the roller bearings fitted to rolling
stock cars develop in service, such will be indicated by severe
rumbling noises and rough riding characteristics. In the event of
a defect to a roller bearing developing, the vehicle should be detached
from the train at the nearest siding or depot, the speed of the train
being reduced until arrival at such point, Should the wheels of the
vehicle concerned become locked and skid as a consequence of a bearing
defect, special care should be taken to pass over points and crossings
at a very' low speed.
After detaching a vehicle for such bearing defects. Drivers
must despatch a telegram to the nearest Locomotive Depot Officer,
intimating what has been done,
14- Roller—bearing axle boxes fitted to Locomotives.
Roller—bearing axle boxes are fitted to the more modern types
of locomotives, these are attended to by the mechanical staff.
However, it is necessary that enginemen observe any local draining
of water adjacent to the axle boxes and book for attention any ir-
regularity in the fixing of drain pipes or any condition which will
allow water to run over the axleboxes particularly of the engine bogie
and coupled wheels.
Should any defect develop in service, it will be indicated by
a rumbling or grinding sound in the axle box, any indication of this
kind should be treated with caution, the speed of the train must not
exceed 15 m.p.h, and the engine stowed in the nearest siding. Failure
to do so, can result in the wheels becoming locked as a consequence
of the bearing defect, resulting in serious damage to the locomotive.
When a locomotive is detached due to a bearing defect, the driver must
despatch a telegram to the nearest locomotive depot, intimating what
has been done and obtain a relief engine to work the train,
15- flxami nation of Locomotives after Derailments.
After the derailment of any locomotive, a careful examination
must be made of all wheels, springs, and other parts to make sure that
no damage has occurred and that no defects exist which are likely to
cause a further derailment, also that all packing from the top or
bottom of axle-boxes has been removed.
Locomotives fitted with roller-bearing axle-boxes, after be-
coming derailed, should have the wheels and axle-boxes checked by a
Mechanical Staff Officer to ensure that no damage has occurred to the
roller bearing.


1 6-4 Re—ratlins ramps to be carried In brake—vans.
Alexander re-railing ramps are carried in the brake-vans of
branch line mixed trains. The method of attaching to the rail for
service is as follows;-
To attach the ramp to the rail, the clip supplied with the ramp
is passed under the foot of the rail and through the hole in the back
of the ramp. The cotter must then be driven through the slot in the
clip until the ramp is forced hard against the web of the rail.
Washers are supplied to ensure that this is done*
Care must be taken to see that the ramp is resting on sleepers
and that the larger ramp is placed outside the four foot, so that the
wheel flange is lifted above rail level when re-railing.
Prevention of back drafts in locomotive cabs.
In all oases when steam is shut off and an engine is about to
run into a tunnel or beneath an overhead bridge, the blower valve must
be opened in order to prevent the possibility of the flame from the
firebox flooding the cab, due to the draft being temporarily retarded.
The same precaution is necessary when running bunker or tender
first with the steam shut off,
18- Locomotive firebox not to be used as an Incinerator,
Rng-lTinman must not permit any person to use the firebox as an
incinerator, as this may create a fire hazard and also result in the
possible blanketting of the spark arrester.
19- Use of Engine Whistles.
Drivers must sound the engine whistle, when entering tunnels
or approaching obscure parts of the road, in order to give warning
to Permanent Way or other employees who may be working on the line
or using tricycles.
On approaching level crossings, it is essential that englnemen
sound one long blast of the whistle.
At the expiration of time allowed at stations for locomotive
purposes, or in the event of time-table allowances being exceeded.
Drivers must sound the engine whistle to indicate to the Station
Officers that they are ready to depart,
20- Unnecessary Whistling: Safety Valves lifting and smoke nuisance.
In order to avoid annoyance to and complaints from the travelling
public and residents in the vicinity of the lines. Drivers must avoid


using the engine whistle unnecessarily and must exercise care, to
prevent unnecessary noises; also the emission of smoke in proximity
of platforms or public roads.
Effective use of the blower, in conjunction with the requisite
admission of air at the firehole door, should be made when passing or
standing at stations, in order to eliminate the smoke nuisance.
When approaching a tunnel the fires of locomotives should be
so arranged to prevent, as far as practicable, the emission of smoke
whilst the train is passing through the tunnel.
In many instances engines are allowed to blow off steam at the
safety-valves, when there is no necessity for such wastefulness. This
is particularly noticeable at terminal stations where engines have to
stand for some time, and also with engines hauling light trains running
over easy grades, resulting in waste of fuel and water. This practice
is objectionable, apart from the waste of fuel and water involved.
The priming of boilers, or emission of hot water from the chimney, when
opening the blower, or starting the air compressor, should be avoided,
and this can easily be done if Drivers and Firemen exercise a little
forethought and judgment,
21- Chime Whistle Emergency Stop Valve.
The attention of enginemen is directed to the presence of an
emergency stop valve at the base of the whistle column on "36" and
"38" class engines.
In the event of enginemen being unable to close the whistle
valve by the ordinary method, the emergency stop valve is to be closed.
22- Inspection and Numbering of Safety Valves,
The Safety-valve Inspector is authorised to make an examination
of the safety-valves of any engine while in traffic, if in his opinion
it is advisable to do so.
Confusion has existed in the past when reporting or referring
to the position of Pop Safety Valves on locomotives fitted with three
(3) such valves, in that they have been described as No, 1,2 or 3 from
either the cab or smokebox end of the locomotive.
To place this matter on a definite basis, it has been decided
to number the valves in their consecutive order, commencing from the
front of the locomotive and working back towards the cab. Locomotives
fitted with three (3) Pop Safety Valves, the No, 1 Valve will be the
Dome Valve, the No, 2 Valve the Middle Valve and No, 3 the last Valve
adjacent to the cab spectacle plate.


23- Screw Wrenches to be carried in a suitable place.
Cases have come under notice of enginemen carrying the screw
wrench attached to the boiler water gauge column cooks. This practice
is undesirable and prevents the cooks being properly operated. The
screw wrench must be carried in some other suitable position in the
cab.
24- Care of Tool Equipment.
The cost of making tools and other small items of locomotive
equipment to replace lost and damaged articles is a constant and
heavy expense to the Mechanical Branch, This is a matter in which
Drivers and Firemen can do much to assist the Department to reduce this
heavy cost and their special attention must be given to this matter .
In oases of rough usage of tool equipment so as to cause damage
to screw wrenches, spanners or other tools* which cannot be satisfactorily
explained by the enginemen concerned, the matter must be reported to
the Chief Mechanical Engineer.
Driver's tool boxes, oil cans, etc., must not be carried on the
outside footplates, but should be accommodated inside the cab. The
sundry boxes must be carried in such position as will preclude the
possibility of water gaining access thereto and causing damage to the
equipment,
25- Fire-irons not to be thrown off locomotives.
Fire-irons must not be thrown off engines, as this practice has
been responsible for injury to persons, damage to cast-iron gratings
and breakage of the fire-irons,
26- Injuries sustained by enginemen by incorrect handling of Fire-irons
The attention of enginemen is directed to the potential source
of injury to their hands consequent upon the incorrect handling of the
fire pricker or dart, particularly when these are being withdrawn from
the firebox after attention to the fire.
For the purpose of obtaining complete control of these appliances
when forming or reconditioning the fire, it is necessary that the pricker
or dart be gripped on the outside of the terminal ring but, when with-
drawing the pricker from the firebox, it is important that this grip
be released and the hand placed on the shaft of the fire—iron below the
terminal ring in order to avoid likely injury by the hand coming into
contact with the front of the tender or other fixtures,
27- Screw-jacks not to be carried on foot-plates.
Screw-Jacks must not be carried on the footplates of locomotives
except in the case of "60" "30T" and Bunker type engines; on other


classes of engines, they must be carried on the back of the tender,
28- Cylinder drain valves broken off.
Two suitable steel plugs are provided in the back box for use
in plugging up the holes of broken cylinder drain valves in the event
of them bding broken off in service.
Plugs must not be driven so far into the cylinder as to foul the
piston head, otherwise serious damage to the piston and rod will result.
29- Damage to automatic couplers fitted to vehicles.
Several cases of damage have occurred to automatic transition
chains, due to the couplings having been thrown over to prevent the
automatic knuckles closing; also the knuckles of automatic coupled
vehicles are being kept in the closed position when vehicles are being
propelled.
An examination of a number of transition chains disclosed that
they were considerably distorted and damaged as a result of the ir-
regular working and the attention of the Staff is drawn to the Regulation
in regard to this matter.
Serious notice will be taken of any infringement of the instructions
in future,
30- Coupling of locomotives to passenger trains.
Special attention is directed to the Regulations concerning the
precautions to be taken by Drivers when attaching a locomotive to a
passenger train, and wherein provision is made that:-
It will bo the duty of the Driver, when bringing a
locomotive on to a passenger train, to exercise every
care and have the locomotive under such control as will
enable it to be brought to a stand by means of the hand-
brakes.
It is essential that this Regulation be strictly adhered to and
thereby obviate the risk of injury to or complaints from passengers,
also damage to rolling stock due to violent contact between the locomotive
and train.
31 Locomotive screw couplings.
Drivers will be held responsible for the screw couplings attached
to their engines being properly oiled and in good working order; also
for their engines being properly coupled to trains.


Locomotives when coupled to coaching vehicles by means of the
vehicle screw coupling should have the coupling screwed up sufficiently
to take up the slack between the drawhooks (only), otherwise difficulty
and consequent delay may be experienced when uncoupling. Also, the ends
of the screw are likely to foul the drawhooks, and this contributes to
displacement or breakage.
In addition, the over tightening of the coupling is likely to
induce rough riding of the leading vehicle.
Firemen and others when uncoupling an engine from its train at
terminal station must first close the air tap both on the engine and the
leading end of the train, the air tap on the leading vehicle must then be
opened to reduce the brake pipe pressure sufficiently to apply the train
air brake, so that the engine may be eased up without moving the train.
When the engine screw coupling is not required for use it must be
carried on the leading drawhook with both shackles over the hook. It must
not be carried on the lamp bracket.
Where the screw coupling is a fixture to the tender drawbar the lower
shackle must be secured on the hook provided in the appropriate position
for the purpose.
The screw coupling of unit drawgear when not in use should have the
lower shackle turned up and the ball spindle threaded through it to
guard against the shackle unscrewing and falling adrift.
Vehicle screw couplings must be removed from engines before leaving
the Traffic Yard*
Reporting defective brake equipment on a vehicle.
Should any defect which may interfere with the proper working of the
brake equipment on a vehicle come to the notice of a driver, it will be
his duty to advise the Train Kvam-i n-i ng Staff at the first opportunity and
to attach an "Air Defect" card to the release wire of the triple valve,
stating the nature of the mechanical defect.
It will be the duty of the Train Examining Staff, when they become
acquainted with the matter, to take appropriate action, when and where
necessary.
35-4 Enginemen to Inspect Air Taps after Taking Water.
Enginemen and others engaged taking water will, after having taken
water at any watering station, be held responsible for seeing that the
air tap at the back of the tender is in the open position before the
departure of the train from that station.


34- Spanner for the Removal of air hoses.
A special design of spanner is provided in the back-box tool
equipment on all classes of locomotives for removing the Westinghouse
Brake air hoses when required,
Enginemen working in the electrified area are reminded to exercise
care when obtaining equipment from engine back-boxes to avoid coming
in contact with any part of the overhead wiring,
35- Tricycles Damaged.
In almost every case of tricycles being run into, it is found
that the accident has occurred through the Regulations not being observed.
Enginemen must exercise every care in observing the Regulations,
so as to avoid such accidents.
The attention of enginemen is particularly directed to the necessity
for keeping a sharp look-out for tricycles and lorries on the lines
and they must sound the engine whistle freely when entering cuttings,
or at other points where a clear view of the line ahead cannot be ob-
tained, especially when a train is running earlier than tabled, behind
schedule, or as a Special, during the hours employees are ordinarily
employed along the line,
When enginemen have been issued with a "Warning to Driver"
T. 6301 form, it is their responsibility to ensure that every precaution
is taken for the safe running of the train as outlined above, A
reduction in the speed of the train is to be made, if the driver con-
siders that this is necessary due to lack of visibility of the line
ahead, or from any other cause that may endanger the safety of any
employees working on or in the vicinity of the running lines.
Special forms are provided at Locomotive Depots for reporting
oases of tricycles struck and these must be filled in when reporting
any such occurrence.
36- Stock killed or injured on running lines.
In order to prevent, as far as possible, stock being killed or
injured on unfenoed lines, enginemen must exercise extreme vigilance,
particularly when approaching stock stops or boundary pits (where
stock usually collect). In addition they should not overlook the
possibility of stock doubling back across the line after having been
disturbed. The train should be kept under control in such circumstances
until they are satisfied that the danger of over-running the animals
has passed. When such accidents occur the train must be brought to
a stand, the line cleared and an examination made to ascertain that
the train is in order. At the termination of the trip both the Driver
and Fireman must submit full particulars of the occurrence on the form
provided for the purpose.


37- Weighing of Traffic on Track Weighbridges.
When it is necessary to weigh vehicles in motion they must be
drawn over the truck weighbridge at a uniform speed not exceeding
2 miles per hour. All jerking, and stopping, unless in obedience to
signals, must be avoided.
Enginemen must pay particular attention to this matter as on
the correct weighing of traffic depends the weight to be charged for
transit of goods; inattention to these instructions may result in
loss to the Department,
38- Prevention of Bush Fires.
Enginemen are required to exercise every care, and prevent, as
far as possible, the escape of sparks from their engines, so as to
avoid damage to property along the line through fire.
Drivers, firemen, trainee enginemen and others are directed to
particularly observe the condition of spark arresters, ashpans and
ashpan cages, also the doors of hopper ashpans of all engines that
they are preparing for the road and are to bring under the notice of
the Chargeman or other superior officer any defect that exists with
any detail of spark arresters, ashpans, ashpan cages and hopper ashpan
doors. If, despite such precautions, the emission of sparks from
either the chimney or ashpan of his engine is observed by a driver during
a journey, he must specially book the defect for attention when stabling
the engine, or, if he is relieved enroute, arrange for the relief driver
to do so, Enginemen must ensure that the spark arresters are not damaged
in any way and that the wire meshing is not distorted as to permit of
large sparks passing through it. Particular care must also be given to
the security of the ashpan cages by the clips provided for the purpose.
In all cases these ashpan cages must be placed in the "closed" position
before the engine leaves the depot. Any case of enginemen found with
ashpan cages, or ashpan hopper doors in the "open" position in traffic,
will be very seriously regarded,
Enginemen are enjoined to refrain from raking out ashpans at
places other than where ashpits are provided. Where it becomes necessary
to rake out an ashpan in the four-foot, the enginemen will be responsible
for thoroughly extinguishing hot ashes deposited on the track.
In the case of fire occurring on the line, or in the vicinity
of bridges, or wherever it is seen that losses may occur or property
endangered, drivers must take such immediate action as the circumstances
of the case warrant,
39- Fires on Railway Property.
In cases where enginemen or guards observe bridges, buildings,
grass, sleepers, etc., in the vicinity of the lines to be on fire,


they must stop their trains and where practicable extinguish the
outbreak. In the event of the fire being so extensive as to preclude
it being extinguished by them, the facts must be reported promptly
by the most expeditious means to the nearest Permanent Way, Traffic,
or other employee, and the latter will be responsible for taking such
action as the circumstances may require, either by calling a fire
brigade or obtaining other assistance to quell the outbreak.
The attention of enginemen, Gangers and Pettlers is also
directed to Rule 294, and the instructions in Regulation 56 on Pages
71 and 72 of the General Appendix, Part Ij all concerned must adopt
every means of extinguishing fires on both rail and adjacent properties.
Any lack of observance of proper precautions will be seriously viewed,
40- Prevention of Fire on Vehicles of their coverings.
Should it be necessary for enginemen, or other employees, to
use a light whilst examining trains or testing the Westinghouse brake
equipment thereonj coupling, uncoupling or renewing a Westinghouse
brake air hosej or otherwise giving attention to a vehicle; a flare
lamp or other naked light must not be used, but a hand signal lamp or
examiner 1 s hand lamp is to be utilised, to avoid danger of fire,
41- Authorised Use of Goggles by Enginemen.
Locomotive Drivers, Firemen, and Rail Motor Drivers may use
goggles in the performance of their duties.
The goggles shall be of standard type approved by the Chief
Medical Officer; they will be of plain glass, i.e., untinted and
without lenses of distortion, and will be sold by the Department at the
lowest possible cost.
Application for the purchase of goggles must be made to the
District Locomotive Engineer of the depot to which the applicant is
attached.
42- Portable Seats Projecting out from the Cab,
These seats must not be attached to the outside of the cab
stanchion as enginemen seated in such a position expose themselves to
the danger of being struck by a passing train or any structure which is
close to the clearance gauge.
43- Use of Respirators. Hoods and Gauntlets by Enginemen.
In order to minimise the adverse affects of heat when working
through certain tunnels, enginemen will be issued with respirators,
hoods and gauntlets, picked up at a suitable location before the tunnel.


The operation of a respirator is as followsi-
Eaoh respirator is fitted with a flexible tube. The nut at
the end of this tube is to be connected to the air valve on the pipe
line on the front of the boiler and the respirator placed over the
mouth and nose, Enginemen can insert a wet sponge cloth over the air
inlet in the bottom of each respirator. An additional cloth will be
specially issued to each man at his home depot, and must be retained
by him for this purpose alone.
The air supply for the respirators is controlled by the driver
and fireman respectively, by opening the air valves to suit their own
requirements,
44- Travelling Water Tanks.
In districts where it is the practice to attach travelling water
tanks to locomotives, it is the driver's duty to see that the water
pipes and hose of the tender and travelling water tank are free from
any obstruction and that the hose connections and other details are
in proper order prior to connecting the water hose between the tender
and travelling tank. It is also essential to see that the service
cock on the trailing end of the travelling tank is securely closed,
DEFECTS ON THE LOCOMOTIVE.
45- Failure in the Steam Chest and Cylinders.
Should the exhaust steam sounds, generally referred to as the
beats of the engine, become irregular, or a constant or intermittent
blow up the chimney occur, or there is any indication that something is
wrong with the admission or exhaust of steam to or from the cylinder,
the valves and pistons should be tested in order, if possible, to locate
the defect. Although defects may occur that would be almost impossible
to definitely locate without making an internal examination of the parts
(which an engine man is not in a position to do), it is important that
when an engine fails on the road, the driver should be able to ascertain
which side of the engine is defective and having done so to be able to
take such action as will enable the engine to be worked to a depot.
If the engine can be moved under its own power, steam it slowly
for a short distance with the brake on, and note the position of the
cranks when each exhaust occurs. The exhaust should take place as each
crank is passing over the dead centre.
There is a difference between the sound of valve and piston
blows with which experienced men are familiar; but it may happen that both
the valve and piston blow at the same time. This will complicate the
matter of locating the trouble accurately. If it is an intermittent or
a recurring blow, with a rumbling sound, it is almost sure to be caused
by a piston blowing through and the aide in which the defect exists may
be located by watching the crank pins when pulling slowly, as the blow


will be most noticeable when the piston is in the centre of the cylinder,
A continuous sharp, shrill sound, is usually associated with the steam
chest.
When a continuous blow occurs and the engine has balanced side ■
valves, it is possible that one of the balance strips or the balance
ring is away from the turtle plate owing to a broken valve spring or
ring, which will cause the steam to blow through the relief ports in the
back of the valve the whole time the regulator is open. The sound
of this blow resembles that of the blower and if the valve is not
perfectly lubricated it will cause a severe knock in the reversing gear.
Testing the Valve Balance.
The method of testing for defective ring or strip balance on
engines fitted with slide valves is as follows!
Place the crank on either quarter (top or bottom) on the slide
to be tested, place the engine in full forward gear, open the cylinder
cocks, apply steam, and if the engine can be reversed to full back
gear by applying one hand to the reversing wheel, there is nothing
wrong with the valve balance, but on the other hand, if it takes two
hands and is difficult to reverse, the balance rings or strips require
attention,
(When the engine is standing with the crank on either quarter for
testing, it is only that valve which moves, the valve on the opposite
side remains stationary, as that piston and crank are on dead centre.)
After testing one side, repeat the operation by placing the
crank on either quarter on the opposite side.
Locating defects in the Valve Gear.
Knocks in the reversing gear may also be caused by lost motion
anywhere between the eccentric and the valve, such as worn eccentrics,
lost motion in the reversing shaft, or (with slide valve engines) the
valve loose in the buckle. If the link hangers are not the correct
length or the reach rod requires adjusting, when the engine is in full
gear the link block may be right in the extreme end of the link slot;
this will not allow the block to slip in the link as it should do when
the engine is running, and will cause a severe knock in the gear, which
will disappear if the gear is notched up.
The most common cause of knocking in the gear is lack of
lubrication.


Connecting Rod and Side Rod Defects»
(a) Connecting Rods.
It is moat important that enginemen should pay particular attention
to the efficient lubrication of the little and big ends, of the con-
necting rod, both during the preparation of the engine and throughout
the journey. When the engine is steaming heavily there is an enormous
amount of friction between the big-end brasses and the crank pins,
which is liable to cause overheating if the lubrication is imperfect.
During the journey the Driver should frequently examine the big
and little ends, if the temperature is above normal, assure himself
that the bearing is receiving a liberal supply of oil or grease, as
the case may be. If the temperature continues to increase with an
oil lubricated journal, cylinder oil should be used.
The driver should obtain a fresh engine as soon as possible,
and on no account should he run the engine until the crank pin is
so hot that it 1s liable to bend, for not only will this result in
the engine being laid up for some considerable time, but there is also
a great risk of damage to the cylinder end with a resulting delay to
traffic due to the section being blocked.
Locating defects in big and little ends.
Owing to the friction on the big and little end pins, the brasses
must be frequently remetalled. When the metal commences to wear,
knocks develop, which should be booked by the driver for attention.
If the driver has any doubt as to the particular bearing which is at
fault, there are several ways by which he may detect it. If he walks
alongside the engine for a few yards while the engine is being steamed
he will have little difficulty in locating the knocks, or he can test
it while the engine is stationary by placing the crank on the top
quarter, putting the brake hard on and opening the regulator a little*
and then instructing the fireman to move the reversing gear backward
and forward while he examines the different parts. When the steam
is reversed from one side of the piston to the other, the faulty
bearing will be at once apparent.
The knocks can sometimes be reduced by tightening the wedge-
blocks or cotters, but care should be taken after tightening that
the rod can be moved sideways on the pin by hand. If this cannot be
done, the brasses are too tight, and should be let out a little,
otherwise heating will result.
Disconnecting a big or little end.
If it should be found necessary to disconnect the big or little
end while the engine is under steam, great care should be taken that
there is no steam in the cylinder when disconnecting, otherwise the
cylinder end may be knocked out, with a serious risk of injury to any


person in the vicinity. Before disconnecting the regular handle should
be removed) or secured in the closed position, the gear placed in such
a position that the valve will be closed, the cylinder cocks opened,
the lubrication steam valve closed and hardwood packing placed between
the crosshead and the cylinder,
(b) Side Rods.
Should it be found necessary to remove a side rod from an
engine, the corresponding rod on the opposite side must also be removed,
otherwise there is a serious risk of it being bent or broken,
47-4 Defects in the Spring G-ear.
The whole weight of a locomotive is transmitted to the journals
of the various axles through springs of either the laminated or spiral
type. These springs perform the very important duty of absorbing the
shock occasioned every time the wheel passes over a bad rail joint or
a high or low spot in the track. By "giving" somewhat, the springs
transform what otherwise would be a sudden blow into a gradually increas-
ing pressure that is not nearly so destructive to either the track or
the locomotive.
When a locomotive spring breaks, the frame falls on to the top
of the axle box and the weight of the engine is carried direct by that
box. Road shocks are, therefore, transmitted direct to the frame, and
derailment is likely to follow. If a spring, spring link, buckle, or
compensating beam breaks when an engine is in traffic, the framing must
be raised to its original position by having suitable packing placed
between the top of the affected axle boxes and the framing. If only
one or two leaves of a spring break it may be secured by the special
clip provided for the purpose; in such a case packing would be un-
necessary.
When an engine is compensated a broken spring not only affects
that particular wheel, but every wheel with which it is compensated and
each of these must be packed also. There is, however, one exception
to this rule; 32 class engines have the leading and driving springs
compensated, and in the event of breakage, the driving box only must
be packed, otherwise the packing is liable to work out when the engine
is in motion, and become caught either in the wheel spokes or the
eccentrics. In most cases the engine can be lifted, for the purpose
of packing the boxes, by running the unaffected wheels up on to suitable
packing, such as wedges, fishplates, or large spanners.
Before running a wheel on to packing it is advisable to note
if there is any space between the top of that box and the frame and
also between the top of the box and the frame at the other end of the
engine. If any space exists it should be filled with iron packing before
running the wheel up, so as to provide a solid base for lifting and to
avoid having to run the wheels up too high. The affected boxes should


be packed as nearly as possible to the same height as the corresponding
boxes on the opposite side. The packing may be placed either above or
below the axle box lid; but if it is to be placed above the lid, the
axle box should be well oiled before the packing is placed in position.
Broken Springs on 38 and 60 Class Locomotives.
Owing to the fact that the axle boxes of these engines have roller
bearings, packing must not be placed between the engine frame and the
top of the axle boxes.
In the event of a spring or spring gear failure in the section,
the train must be run at a speed not exceeding 15 miles per hour to the
nearest station, where it can be detached and a relief engine obtained
to work the train. Particulars of the defect must be wired to the nearest
depot in order that arrangements can be made for prompt examination and
attention before the engine is worked forward. In the case of a 60 class
locomotive, after the train is stowed, the engine may run light to the
nearest depot at a speed not exceeding 30 m.p.h,
lhen an engine, other than a "38" or "60" class, has to be run with
broken springs, no definite speed restriction can be laid down; but it
should be run cautiously, especially around the curves and over crossings,
and the Driver must use his own discretion as to the speed to be maintained.
48- TYRES. Broken or badly cracked.
Should a tyre be found to be badly cracked or broken in the section,
ensure that the train is properly protected and wire for Mechanical Staff
Assistance, giving full particulars. If the tyre is found to be loose
or only slightly cracked, remove the brake blocks from the affected wheel,
49- Defects on the Nathan Mechanical Lubricator.
The only defects likely to occur in service are broken oil pipes,
or the lubricator becoming disconnected from the driving arm on the
expansion link.
In the event of a broken pipe, it must not be blanked or closed
with a hammer, as the oil pumps are very positive and damage may result
from such procedure. Should a pipe break the oil must be allowed to run
to waste until the engine is stabled, when the fault can be rectified by
mechanics.
It is, of course, recognised that the connection on the steam
chest, or cylinder would be blanked to prevent the escape of steam.
If the lubricator becomes disconnected from the driving crank arm
en route, the engine should be brought to a stand at intervals of about
15 miles, and the ratchet handle rotated fifty times by the fireman,
during which time the engine should be moved slowly a few turns of the
wheel to ensure oil being deposited over all surfaces in cylinders, etc.
When making such stops, care should be exercised to select favourable


locations for starting trains in order to minimise loss of time.
50- Feed Nozzles becoming obstructed on Hydrostatic Lubricators.
Should a feed nozzle become obstructed so that the oil will not
feed through it, it can usually be cleared with little difficulty,
First - Tap lightly under the feed valve with a spanner} the Jarring
may move the obstruction. If this fails try the followingj-
Seoond - Open and close quickly the drain valve below the glass. If the
oil does not flow, open the vent wide, so that all the water will be blown
out; the escaping steam lessens the steam pressure within this one
sight-feed chamber, which is equivalent to adding additional force to the
pressure below the nozzle and is usually sufficient to force out the ob-
struction, Should both of the above methods fail, then the following
will positively remove the cause of trouble.
Third - Place the oil control valve in the "Closed" position; the other
feed valves need not be disturbed, neither is it necessary to close the
water valve or the steam valve. Screw out the whole of the feed valve,
leaving a large opening in bottom of the lubricator; then insert a wire
in the feed nozzle to raise the small ball check valve, which will allow
steam pressure to force the obstruction downward and outside to the at-
mosphere, Replace the feed valve, turn the oil control valve to "All
Open", and reset the affected feed.
Should a feed nozzle become obstructed and cannot be made workable
by the usual method, without causing a delay to the train, it will be
found that by feeding the oil at a higher rate, through the Immediate
adjacent feed to that side of the engine, that temporary relief will be
effected, until the matter can be remedied, (US.) If the left valve
feed nozzle is blocked, increase the feed 10C% to the left cylinder, and
work the engine with a reduced regulator and longer cut-off, the oil will
be carried in to the valve chamber with the exhaust steam. If the left
cylinder feed is blocked, increase the feed to the left valve,
51- Sand (rear Failures.
Wat sand is probably the most common cause of failures to the
sand equipment of locomotives and is usually brought about by the care-
lessness of Shed Staff and Enginemen in omitting to see that the sand box
lids are correctly fitted at all times.
Another cause by which locomotive sand often becomes wet, is
brought about by operating the sand equipment while the locomotive is
standing over a wet location. Should the sand equipment be operated for
any length of time, in such a situation, so that the sand is allowed to
heap up around the sand pipe outlet and back up into the sand pipe Itself,
there is a distinct possibility that the water laying around the track
will be soaked by the sand within the pipe and thereby cause a blockage
to occur.


In the case of air operated sand equipment, failures have occurred
through the air being too moist with the result that a quantity of wet
sand becomes lodged in the sand trap. To overcome this defect whendt
occurs on the main line, drivers are permitted to remove the inspection
plug and remove the wet sand by probing with a piece of wire or the axle
bcx lid lifter. As this moisture defect originates from water in the
main reservoirs, it is of the utmost importance that drivers fully drain
all water from the main reservoirs during preparation.
52- Failure of Air Compressors,
Under no circumstances shall a locomotive of the 36» 38, 59 or
60 class type be permitted to work a train or run light engine over any
section of line, nor shall a locomotive of this type be allowed to depart
from a locomotive depot, with the air compressor in a defective condition.
In the event of the air compressor failing whilst the locomotive
is in service, thereby necessitating the provision of an assistant engine,
the latter must at all times be marshalled in the lead for the purpose
of assisting and controlling the train enroute to the nearest depot
where the defective engine is to be replaced. With A.6..E.T, brake equip-
ment, on attaching the assistant engine to the "dead engine", (the one on
which the compressor is inoperative but on which the main reservoir and
its connections are capable of holding pressure), the driver's brake
valve isolating cock on the "dead engine" shall be closed, both brake
valve handles placed in "running*position and the "dead engine" device
brought into operation.
On 36 and 38 class locomotives the steam supply to the lubricating
system for valves and pistons is controlled by the compressor steam
valve, this steam valve must be maintained in the open position, even
though the compressor has failed, to ensure efficient lubrication. The
compressor steam pipe is to be disconnected at the brass union where
the steam pipe attaches to the compressor, insert suitable blank packing,
recouple the steam union and turn on the steam valve to the compressor.
Should the compressor steam pipe fail, necessitating the closing
of the steam valve, the engine may be operated without steam to the
manifold and oil atomisers for a short distance only. Non-atomised oil
will then be fed to the cylinders and steam chests and be partly atomised
by contacting live steam in the cylinders and steam chests,
53- Defects in the A.6.E.T. Brake Equipment,
Stiff Rotary Valve.
Should the rotary valve of either brake valve become stiff, this
may be remedied as follows
fa) Close the automatic brake valve isolating cock,
(b; Place the brake valve handle in "emergency" position, draining the
brake pipe and equalising reservoir pressure to zero.


(o) In the case of the independent portion, in addition to (a) and (b)
the main reservoir cut out cock (located on the main reservoir pipe to
the pedestal brake valves, adjacent to the main reservoir) must be
closed and the main reservoir pressure (as shown on duplex gauge) reduced
to zero.
The oil plug in the valve body should then be removed and the oil
hole filled with locomotive bearing oil. The handle should be moved a
number of times between "release" and "emergency" positions to work the
oil between the rotary valve and its seat. After this operation again
fill the oil hole and replace the oil plug.
Next remove the cap nut from the rotary valve handle, fill the oil
hole, push down the stem and refill the oil hole. Replace the cap nut.
The above applies to both the automatic portion and the
independent portion,
NOTE: It is most important that the spout of the oil feeder be perfectly
clean when oiling the brake valves as above.
Defects in the Distributing Valve,
If defects are located in this valve it should be isolated by
closing the isolating cock on the main reservoir pipe leading to the
distributing valvej also close the isolating cocks to the engine and
tender brake cylinders and leave them in the closed position. It will
be necessary to separate the intermediate brake cylinder pipe air hoses,
between the engine and tender, to release the air from the tender brake
cylinders.
Slide Valve Feed Valve Defective.
If the slide valve feed valve becomes defective, this may be
changed over with M,3 reducing valve and the latter adjusted accordingly.
The independent brake valve handle should not be used and should be left
in "running" position.
Independent brake valve inoperative. Engine, tender and train
brakes working,
54-4 Pipe Breakages on the A.6.E.T. Brake Equipment.
In the event of a pipe becoming defective in service, the isolat-
ing cock, if provided, is to be closed to isolate the defective pipe*
When no isolating cock is provided, provision has been made in the
Spare and Emergency Equipment provided on the engine for pipe breakages
to be dealt with by insertion of blank fittings, wherever possible.


In an emergency. If blank fittings are not available, copper pipes
may bo isolated by flattening,
GAUGES.
All pipes to gauges may be blanked off at compression fittings
with special blank fittings mentioned above,
GOVERNOR PIPES.
These may be blanked in a similar manner to gauge pipes. In the
case of the pipe to the Low Pressure Governor Head, this may be isolated
by o'o«-tng the £ inch Isolating Cock situated behind the brake pedestal
cover.
The pipe to High Pressure Governor Head may be blanked if
necessary at an intermediate Joint, When this head is blanked off, the
compressor must be controlled by compressor steam valve in cab,
BRAKE PIPS AND MAIN RESERVOIR PIPE.
If unable to repair, treat as an engine failure,

An Electric Train or parcel van is capable of giving assistance
to a disabled train as fellows:—
When a locomotive hauled train or light engine requires to he
assisted in the rear, the employee who arranges for assistance must
advise whether the last vehicle on the train, or the tender of the light
engine, is fitted with an ordinary draw hook or an automatic coupler,
also the total tonnage of the train and the tonnage for which assistance
is required.
In the case of a disabled Electric Train he must state the number
of motors which are inoperative.
When assistance is being given by an Electric train, it must be
coupled to the disabled train, and the Westinghouse Air Brake operative
throughout the combined trains and worked from the front end, whenever
practicable.
If the combined train falls to move after power has been applied
for 20 to 30 seconds, the power must be shut off and not re-applied
until after a lapse of two minutes to allow the resistances to cool.


This procedure must be limited to four attempts and If unsuccessful,
alternative arrangements made to clear the section.
When assistance is being given by a Steam train or engine to an
Electric train the brakes must be operated as prescribed in Regulation
No* 70. - Working of Electric Trains.
Electric inter-urban trains may be used to assist locomotive hauled
trains provided the rear vehicle of the assisted train is fitted with
an automatic coupler and the load conforms to this regulation.
Should the rear vehicle of the assisted train be fitted with buffers,
the diaphragm plate of the Inter-urban train is to be removed.
When assistance is no longer required the train must be stopped,
specially, if necessary, at the first convenient station to detach the
assisting train or locomotive.
The emergency coupler must be returned to the station from which
it was obtained.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE GUIDANCE OP BNCINEMEN


1- Introduction.
The education of enginemen in all phases of safeworking, Westinghouse
Air Brake and Locomotive Management is of special importance in modern
locomotive operation.
The instructions contained in this section are for the guidance of
Locomotive Drivers, Firemen and Trainee Enginemen, and cover the facilities
that are available to enable enginemen to qualify for higher grades,
together with the regulations governing the promotion and transfer of
enginemen, the knowledge required by enginemen of the various roads,
material allowances and other items it is considered they should be well
acquainted with.
Training of Enginemen.
2- Firemen and Trainee Enginemen to qualify for higher grades.
It is desired that Firemen and Trainee Enginemen in their own
interests, as well as that of the Department, qualify for the position
of Driver and Fireman respectively.
Drivers, Firemen and Trainee Enginemen throughout the service have
an opportunity afforded them of special tuition, which it is expected
they will avail themselves of to be proficient enginemen.
5-5 Education facilities available to enginemen.
Catechisms and Instruction books of practical questions and answers
have been compiled on the various types of locomotives, Westinghouse Air
Brake and Safeworking for the information of the running staff. These
are issued by the Mechanical Branch to Drivers, Firemen and Trainee
Enginemen as they progress in the service.
Railways Institute Classes:
Classes of instruction for Enginemen are regularly held at the
Railways Institute, Sydney, and at the larger depots. Instruction is
free to all Institute Members. At depots where oral classes are not
conducted, employees may obtain instructions per medium of the correspon-
dence courses conducted from the Institute headquarters.
Locomotive and Safe Working Instruction Cars;
A number of cars have been specially equipped with numerous loco-
motive components for instructional purposes} these being used for the
SECTION 5.
INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE GUIDANCE OF EN&INEMEN.


purpose of instructing the running staff in locomotive operation,
Westinghouse Air Brake and Safeworking, by an Instructor who is in at-
tendance in each car. The cars visit all Depots periodically and pract-
ical tuition is thereby brought within reach of all employees on the
locomotive running staff,
V-5 Instruction and Examination of Trainee Enginemen and Firemen for
higher grades.
In order to prescribe a more practical system of training and
examinations in each of the aforementioned classifications, the following
instructions will apply.
Trainee Enginemen for Acting Firing Duties.
Trainee Enginemen, 17-1/2 years or over, will be required to undergo
instruction and examination for the position of acting fireman, as soon
as possible after employment or on attaining the required age.
(1) Schools (not exceeding twelve trainee enginemen) will be held at
selected depots in each division as required, under the tuition of
a Locomotive Running Inspector, or an officer accompanying the
locomotive instruction oar. The course will be for a continuous
period of ten working days, to a prepared syllabus covering the in-
duction course instruction, rules, regulations, safe working
principles, and practical instruction on stationary locomotives.
(2) On completion of the instruction school, trainee enginemen will be
submitted to an oral examination on the aforementioned subjects.
Candidates who fail to qualify, will be allowed one month in which
to prepare, by private study, for the second and final examination
in subjects in which they previously failed, Slhould they again fail
to qualify they are to be recorded as not possessing the aptitude
for footplate training and will be transferred to other positions,
(3) Successful candidates in groups of four will be given two days depot
instruction, in the servicing and reconditioning of locomotives, thens-
(4) Three days practical instruction, including instructional trips, to
determine their qualifications for fireman/observer duties on loco-
motive working, on other than express passenger and express goods
services. When the trainee enginaman is passed by the accompanying
Running Inspector as competent to the necessary standard, the Running
Inspector is to issue an 'A' certificate, which shall indicate the
services for which the trainee is eligible and on which he is to be
employed for 80 hours as soon as practicable, irrespective of his
seniority,
(5) When the trainee completes 80 hours on fireman's duties the Running
Inspector will again examine the trainee to determine whether he is


competent for employment on services other than express passenger
and express goods, and will issue a *B' certificate if he is con-
sidered suitable. Any cases where candidates fail to qualify after
this period are to be referred to the Chief Mechanical Engineer for
determination.
(6) After a trainee has oonqpleted 1,000 hrs. actual firing duty, the
Senior Punning Inspector and District Locomotive Engineer of the
depot concerned, will review and determine the ability of the trainee
to carry out the duties of an Acting Fireman. If the trainee
engineman'a service as a fireman has been satisfactory he is to be
recommended for the issue of a fireman's competency certificate
without a further trial trip. If there is a record of unsatisfactory
service within the 1,000 hours, a trial trip is to be arranged before
a recommendation is made for issue of a fireman's competency
certificate,
(?) Progressive training will be given on larger classes of steam loco-
motives, passenger services and conversion instruction on non-steam
locomotives, to meet the requirements of the particular depot,
5- Training at Non-steam locomotive depots.
In addition to the aforementioned procedure the following instruc-
tions will also applys-
(l) At depots where a relatively small amount of firing duties is per-
formed on steam locomotives, trainee enginemen will be given in-
struction to the standard required on steam locomotives for shunting
and other subsidiary services and the certificate will be endorsed
accordingly.
(2) After performing 1,000 hours actual fireman/observer's duties the
ability and performance of duties as acting fireman/observer are
to be reviewed by the Senior Bunning Inspector for the depot in
company with the District Locomotive Engineer, If the trainee
engineman's service as a fireman/observer has been satisfactory he
is to be recommended for issue of fireman/observer's competency
certificate (endorsed "non-steam practice"),
6- Firemen for Acting Driving Duties,
A classified fireman will be required after completion of 2-1/2
years service to qualify for the position of Acting Driver or after having
completed 2 years service, in their respective classifications, a clas-
sified fireman or Acting Fireman may qualify on a voluntary basis for
the position of Acting Driver, provided they have attained the age of
21 years.
(l) Firemen will be subjected to an oral examination on safeworking
regulations, (locomotive driving standard, 795) based on private


study. Should a candidate fail to qualify he will be submitted
to a second and final examination at the expiration of one month;
should he again fail he will be removed from the running staff,
(2) The successful candidates after having worked over the roads for
the prescribed number of trips, will be subjected, as soon as
practicable to an oral examination for road knowledge on sections
over which they will be required to work as an Acting Driver,
Firemen who fail to qualify by this examination for road knowledge
will be re-examined after one month, during which period they will
be rostered for firing duties to the maximum practicable extent,
but not less than the prescribed number of trips for the roads with
which they are not conversant. Should they again fail to qualify
they will be removed from the running staff,
(3) Successful candidates will be given ten days in an instruction
school on locomotive management, Westinghouse brake and train working
instructions, at the completion of which school they will be sub-
jected to an oral examination in these subjects.
Firemen who fail to qualify at this examination will be required
to prepare themselves, by private study, for a second and final
examination after one month. Candidates who fail to qualify at the
second attempt will be removed from the running staff,
(4) Successful candidates will be given two days depot duties and traffic
yard practices, including driver's train examination responsibilities,
after which they will be given three days practical instruction and
trial trips on appropriate services during which time the trainee
will be examined for the issue of a driver's competency certificate.
Should he fail to qualify after this period his case will be
referred to the Chief Mechanical Engineer for determination.
Progressive training will be given on various classes of locomo-
tives and services according to the requirements of the particular
depot,
NOTE: At depots where shunting and other subsidiary services are worked
by steam locomotives. Acting Drivers will be given instruction and
examination to the standard required, and the certificate will be
endorsed accordingly.
The schools of instruction, previously mentioned will be arranged
at suitable locations within each division; when schools are arranged
away from their home stations enginemen attending will be paid
expenses in accordance with the Enginemen's Award.


7- Staff Examinations on a voluntary basis.
Firemen who submit to examination on a voluntary basis will be
examined in safe working, (locomotive driving standard, 75£&), locomotive
management, Westinghouse air brake and train working regulations to the
same standards as required of firemen who pass through the training
schools. If successful they will be examined on road knowledge for the
districts in which they work and subject to satisfactory knowledge of
these roads they will then be given trial trips as acting driver in the
company of a Running Inspector. If they meet the requirements of the
latter they will be issued with certificates of competency as locomotive
driver and listed for employment as acting driver in their seniority
order.
Those firemen who volunteer for examination for acting driver will
be allowed one examination only on the voluntary basis. If unsuccessful
they will be required to attend the training schools at the conclusion
of 2-l/2 years service from the dates their seniority as firemen are
calculated.
8- Staff Examinations for promotion.
(A) Examinations for promotion.
Trainee enginemen and firemen, before being permanently promoted
to fireman and driver respectively, shall be required to be qualified
by the Staff Examiner for such promotion. Should a trainee engineman
or fireman have qualified voluntary and two years or more have since
elapsed, before he is due for promotion, he will be required to again
qualify by re-examination by the Staff Examiner for subsequent promotion
The main features of the examination for Drivers, Firemen and
Trainee Enginemen will be:- Safe Working, Westinghouse Air Brake, and
Elaine Management.
At least four weeks notice will be given to the enginemen of the
date they will be required for examination by the Staff Examiner for
promotion to fireman. Acting Driver or Driver as the case may be.
(B) Examinations for non-steam working.
When it is necessary for a fireman, acting driver, who is only
qualified for steam working to be trained for non-steam working he will
be given five days training on locomotive management in a ground school
followed by an oral examination on the subject matter. If his knowledge
is satisfactory he will then be given appropriate road training.
Should it be necessary for a fireman, acting driver, with no steam
qualifications to be trained for steam working, his case is to be repre-
sented to the Chief Mechanical Engineer, Staff Section, for direction as
to the procedure which will be adopted.

9- Re-examination of Mechanical Branch Employees.
A Mechanical Branch employee, who is engaged in train working
duties and is subject to a staff examination for promotion, shall be
re-examined at any time should doubt arise as to his qualifications.
This examination will be conducted by the Staff Examiner to determine
if the employee has sufficient knowledge to carry out his duties ef-
ficiently in regards to train working.
Re-examination of employees who temporarily relinquish firing duties.
Firemen or Acting Firemen who resign from the service and are
subsequently re-employed or who are required from various causes to
temporarily relinquish firing duties and have been dissociated from
firing duties for a period of time in excess of nine months, will be
required to undergo an examination by the Staff Examiner before again
being permitted to take up firing duties.
After having been qualified by the Staff Examiner, the fireman
or acting fireman concerned is to be submitted to the customary trial
trips by a running Inspector before being certified for the various
classes of working.

11~5 Drivers. Firemen and Trainee Enginemen for Transfer.
An employee promoted at his home Depot, or who has been transferred
from one place to another for promotion or who has been transferred to
meet his own request, will not be considered for a further transfer in
the same grade at his own request (except for health reasons certified
as necessitating medical specialists' treatment, or to suit departmental
convenience) until a period of two years has elapsed.
12-5 Employees selected for promotion or Transfer,
Subsequent to a fireman or trainee engineman qualifying as an
acting driver or acting fireman respectively, an X 1512 form will be
forwarded to him to indicate the depots at which he is prepared to accept
promotion. The information contained in this form will be utilised in
the selection of staff for promotion to driver or fireman.
Should an employee desire to amend the X 1512 form completed by
him, another form will be forwarded on his making application through
his superior officer.
An employee desirous of transfer from one location to another should
address his application to the Chief Mechanical Engineer and forward it
through his controlling officers - when he will be noted in seniority
order. J
If an employee has submitted an application for transfer to another
depot in his own grade, and subsequently finds such transfer would not
be acceptable, he should ask for his application to be cancelled before
any arrangement is made for such transfer.
13-5 Drivers transferred to the salaried staff.
The names of Special Class Drivers who desire to be considered
for transfer from one depot to another in that class, will be noted in
seniority order upon receipt of written application.
_ Vacancies for Special Class Drivers will be filled by the transfer
ot drivers in that grade, or by promotion of suitable drivers.
. Promotions to Special Class Driver will be made on a state wide
seniority basis in the same way as promotions are made from firemen to
drivers. X1512A forms are supplied to each driver to indicate the depot
at which he is prepared to accept promotion as special class driver, and
the information contained on this form will be utilised in making selec-
tions for promotion.
Should a driver desire to amend the X1512A form completed by him
Sfice? form Will b 6 for Warded 0n makin « application to his superior


When necessary to reduce the number of special class drivers at
a depot, the junior special class driver at the depot will have the op-
portunity of displacing the junior special class driver in the state,
or of regressing to driver at his home depot. Upon regressing, he would
displace the driver with the shortest service on relief work, and be
regarded as the senior driver for the relief of special class drivers,
and will be first on turn for restoration to that grade.
14- Seniority of Shunting Firemen.
Shunting Firemen will not be required to pass the Staff Examiner
for the position of Acting Driver, but they will be required to submit
themselves for examinations as to their competency as firemen, and if
passed as eligible, the seniority of any shunting fireman who wishes to
take up main line work will be considered on its merits,
15- Knowledge of the Road.
Should a Driver find that he is booked to run a train over a line
with which he is not thoroughly acquainted, he must at once report the
fact to the Officer-in-charge, of the depot so that alternative arrange-
ments may be made.
16- Pilot Drivers.
With reference to Rule 1 63 of the Book of Rules and Regulations
which reads:
"If a driver is not acquainted with any portion of the
line over which he has to non, he must obtain the services
of a pilot driver."
It is to be understood that this Rule applies to all train drivers.
In respect to the pilot driver, he shall, unless at the time
it be quite impossible to secure the services of one, be a driver quali-
fied and competent, to take full charge of the engine, electric or
diesel train, or rail motor, as the case may be. He will be responsible
for the safe running of the train and where qualified and competent to
do so, will actually drive the engine, electric or diesel, train or rail
motor concerned.
When, it is not possible to secure the services of a driver who
is qualified to drive the engine, electric or diesel train, or rail motor
concerned another driver may be employed as the pilot driver, provided
he has had the requisite knowledge of the road and signals, but, in such
cases, he shall not actually drive the engine, electric or diesel, train
or rail motor that is to be piloted.
The pilot Driver must come to a clear understanding with the
actual driver before starting, as to how the actual driver will operate
under the pilot driver's instructions, and shall during the journey convey


to the actual driver a timely warning regarding the position of sharp
curves and/or heavy grades to be negotiated and their braking require-
ments. There should also be similarly conveyed to the actual driver,
by the pilot driver, information regarding any junctions, turnouts,
catch points, or other special permanent way or signalling features,
that will be encountered, and the locations of stations, or places,
where stops have to be made.
Time allowances to enginemen learning roads and payment of time
involved.
(A) Advising of Enginemen to learn roads and submission of Drivers*
• Daily Report Sheets.
When it is necessary for an engineman to learn roads, the District
Locomotive Engineer shall inform him in writings-
(a) The roads he is required to learn.
NOTE - These should not include roads over which he will not
be required to work.
(b) The trains by which he will be required to travel to learn
such roads. This is to be arranged so that not more than one
driver is rostered to travel on a locomotive for the purpose of
learning the road.
” These should not include fast exacting services.
(o) The allowances, in days or trips, as the case may be.
(d) The conditions which operate in the event of his failure to
sign for the roads after having had the prescribed number of days
or trips.
Drivers learning roads travelling on locomotives must sign on
at the commencement and off at the termination of their shifts and
submit a Driver's Daily Report sheet for each shift. They must present
their Daily Report Sheets for attestation at the Locomotive Depots where
they sign on and off, or to the Station Master if at a place where no
Locomotive Officer is on duty and record there attendances, in the Daily-
Attendance Book. ■ua-i-Ky
... Pul ?- Particulars must be entered by them on their Report sheets
of the numbers of the trains by which they travel and the sections they
travel over. The signature of the Driver of each train on which they
travel must be obtained on tbe report sbeet,
Enginemen learning the road acting as Firemen will have their
time recorded on the Daily Report sheets of the Drivers with whom they
work. *

(B) Periods which should elapse before enginemen become entitled to
re-learn roads.
Enginemen, having signed for a knowledge of a road, will be ex-
pected to be sufficiently well acquainted with that road and sidings to
work trains over same without the assistance of a Pilotman, provided
that no extensive alterations have been made in the road since the last
trip, for the following periods:-
In order that Drivers will keep in touch with the roads they have
signed for, arrangements must be made for them to work over those roads
within the periods shown above.
NOTE - Providing no extensive alterations have been made in the road
since the last trip performed, enginemen requiring to re-learn roads
necessary in the working to and from various collieries will be required
to do so as a Driver accompanied by a Fireman (Acting Driver) who has
a knowledge of the roads concerned.
(C) Payment of enginemen who refuse to work over roads.
Enginemen, who refuse to work over roads on which they have worked
trains within the periods mentioned in (fi), are to be allowed to re-learn
the roads in the capacity of Firemen and be paid at their classified
rate of pay, the number of days or trips to be in accordance with the


prescribed schedule as shown in clause (J). In the event of enginemen
not being prepared to work trains over the section or sections after
again learning the road or roads for the prescribed number of days or
trips, they will be required to continue learning the roads as Firemen,
but they will only be paid at Firemen's rate until they sign for the
roads.
(d) Drivers transferred to positions in the same grade for Departmental
reasons, or on promotion to Driver. Special Class.
Enginemen transferred to positions in the same grade for Depart-
mental reasons - other than mentioned in clause (E) - are to learn the
roads in their new district travelling on locomotives and to be paid at
their classified rate. If, after having received the prescribed number
of days or trips, they are not sufficiently acquainted with the roads
to sign for them, a similar number of days or trips must be arranged,
but for this second term they will be required to learn the roads as
Firemen at their classified rate. If, after this further term they dis-
claim a knowledge of the road they will be required to act as a Fireman
at Fireman's rate of pay until they ultimately signify they are acquainted
with the road or roads.
To minimise the period that Drivers transferred for promotion to
Driver, Special Class, will be occupied in learning roads travelling on
locomotives or firing at Drivers or Firemens rate of pay, it should be
arranged for them to learn only those roads over which they will be re-
quired to work. Should they subsequently be required to learn other
roads, the instructions regarding the number of days or trips travelling
on locomotives or firing at their classified or at Firemans rate of pay
are to be again applied while they are learning the additional roads.

to which they are promoted, subject to their qualifying, when required,
foh all other classes of locomotive and train working they are required
to perform, and that in the event of their failure to do so within the
time normally required, the question of their transfer to some other
location or the cancellation of their promotion will be considered.
An exception may be made in the case of a fireman promoted at
his home depot, when the promotion will not be deferred if it is a case
of the employee not being conversant with one particular section over

It is unnecessary for a Driver who, immediately prior to his
transfer, has had experience of any of the sections enumerated, to
be travelled with over such sections by the Running Inspector of the
Division to which he is transferred.
For example, it would not be necessary for a Goulburn Driver
who was, immediately prior to transferring to Enfield, working over
the Goulburn - Sydney, or G-oulburn - Enfield Section, to be travelled
with thereover by the Metropolitan Inspector preparatory to being
rostered to work services as a Driver between these points.
In all other cases of transfers to, or promotion within districts,
other than those embracing the roads indicated above, the Running
Inspector will arrange at the earliest date to travel with the Drivers
concerned in order that it may be definitely established whether they
possess the requisite qualifications for the various classes of work
they will be required to perform, and also in regard to their knowledge
of the working over sections between various watering stations.
To enable enginemen to improve their knowledge of the roads over
which they are required to work, curve and gradient diagrams are
exhibited at all principal depots. A study of these diagrams will be
of assistance to enginemen in the correct handling of their trains when
working over grades,

18-5 Procedure to be adopted for learning roads.
(A) Fireman due for promotion to acting driver,
A fireman due for promotion to the position of Acting Driver, or a
fireman (acting driver) transferring from one district to another, will be
required to learn the roads over which he is required to run during the
normal course of his firing duties, i.e, during such times that he is
actually engaged in normal firing duties over the road. This will also
apply to a fireman being promoted to the position of Driver in the District
in which he has been engaged as a fireman.
(B) Firemen due for promotion to Driver at other than his own depot.
A fireman due for promotion to Driver, at a depot where he has not
been engaged as a firemen, will be required to learn the roads in the
district where he is to be promoted as followss-
(1) The roads that are not specified under the heading of Item 17 (l),
(Sections over which trial trips are to be made) are to be learnt whilst
carrying out normal firing duties in the district concerned.
(2) When required to learn roads that are specified under Item 17 (l),
(Sections over which trial trips are to be made, the procedure
enumerated below under Item (c) will be carried out.
(C) Firemen due for promotion to Driver. Drivers promoted to Special
Class or Drivers transferred for any reason.
When a fireman is due for promotion to Driver, or a driver is being
promoted to Special class, or a driver is transferred for any reason, he
will be required to gain the necessary knowledge of the roads listed under
Item 17 (l), (Sections over which trial trips are to be made), by the
following methods-
(l) The District Locomotive Engineer of the depot concerned will be re-
quired to convey to the Running Inspector of the district the requisite
information in regard to the names and classifications of enginemen and
the roads that they are required to learn in the district.
(2) The Running Inspector will then arrange to have a departmental curve
and gradient diagram book and a list of road knowledge questions issued
to each driver who is required to learn the respective roads, these,
together with the current working timetables applicable to the District
concerned, are to be closely studied by the driver, A driver will find
that by a careful study of the curve and gradient book, he will gain
considerable knowledge of the roads over which he is required to work
and it will also help him to become familiar with the general geography
of the roads, whilst he is learning same.


(3) The Driver will then be accompanied by the Running Inspector on a
suitable locomotive working a train over the respective roads. The
Running Inspector may perform the driving duties on the locomotive
and using the curve and gradient book as a basis of instruction will
point out all the salient features of the road to the Driver, If the
Driver so desires, he may mark out any important features that he may
require for future reference, but these markings must only be made
with a lead pencil, on the curve and gradient diagrams, so that, they
may be erased without defacing the book.
NOTE - To permit of the trainee driver having full concentration on
the road, while travelling on the locomotive, he must not be used for
driving duties,
(4) After having been given suitable instruction by "the Running Inspector
over the roads laid down, the driver will then continue to learn the
roads in the normal manner, i.e., either travelling on a locomotive or
engaged in actual firing duties over the road as specified in the
regulations under Item 17-5.
(5) When the Driver considers he has gained sufficient knowledge of the
roads in the district and is ready to perform a trial trip, he will
inform the District Locomotive Engineer at the depot concerned.
The Running Inspector on being informed accordingly, will arrange to
accompany the Driver on a suitable type of locomotive working over the
roads applicable to the district concerned and enumerated under Item
17 (1).
The Driver, will arrange to have the curve and gradient book returned
to the Running Inspector of the depot concerned, at the expiry of one
month, from the date of issue.
Miscellaneous Instructions.
19- Signing of Attendance Books.
Attendance books must be signed in ink at all places unless special
authority is given to sign in indelible pencil.

which is continuing the journey,
23- Allotment of Watches.
Departmental watches are allotted to each district, and will be
supplied to Drivers, also to Acting Drivers where the circumstances
warrant.

one district to another, he must hand his watch to the District Locomotive
Engineer at the depot from which he is being transferred, and on re-
suming duty, apply to the Officer-in-Charge of the depot to which he
is transferred for another watch. When men are only temporarily loaned
to another district, they may take with them the watch allotted to them
at their home depot.

part of their duty.
29- Issuing and Receiving Trainee Enginemens Kits.
Unless otherwise directed the following system must be observed
in connection with the issue and receipt of Trainee Enginemens kits:—


(1) A kit board to be provided with numbers and pegs, which is to be
kept in the store.
(2) All kits are to be numbered to correspond with the numbers shown
on the kit board.
(3) Each Trainee Engineman on presenting himself for duty, either at
the beginning of a shift, after meals, or other times, must ob-
tain from the Booker-On or Foremans Clerk his metal token bearing
his allotted number. He must present the token to the Storeman
when applying for his kit. The Storeman will place the token on
the corresponding kit number peg on the board and issue to the
Trainee Engineman his kit,
(4) When the Trainee Engineman leaves work for meals or other purpose,
or at the termination of his shift, he must return his kit to the
store with the unused stores and dirty waste or cloths and obtain
his metal token in exchange for his kit, and deposit the token
with the Booker On or Foremans Clerk,
During the hours the store is closed Trainee Enginemen will obtain
and deposit their kits in lockers provided, the keys of which must be
obtained from and returned to the Booker On or Officer-in-Charge.
Trainee Enginemen’s kits must not be left lying about the shed
or yard,
30-5 Use of Steam and Water Spray for cleaning engines.
The use of the steam spray and hot water cleaner when operated
in the shed in the night time is conducive to considerable inconvenience
and danger to the staff in carrying out their duties.
It is to be used only where it can cause no inconvenience and be
in no way detrimental to the safety of the employees in the shed.
If there is a convenient road in the shed on which to place an
engine where the apparatus can be used efficiently without any cause
for complaint, it should be done. During foggy mornings, engines should
not be cleaned on running roads or near where other men are working
inside the sheds. Every advantage, however, must be taken to make the
most efficient use of it outside the shed on each occasion.
Care must be taken by employees engaged in steam spraying loco-
motives to ensure that steam and water from the spray do not gain access
to the axleboxes and oil wells.
Special precautions to prevent the entry of water to the axleboxes
of "38" and "60" class locomotives is essential, and the use of the
spray in the vicinity of the engine axleboxes is prohibited.

31- Cleaning of Tender Tanks.
Before entering a tender tank, all concerned must see that the hosebagf
leading from the tender to the injector are disconnected, and the tank
valves fully open for the admission of air to the tank. If it be
necessary to dry the tender tank, this must be done with bagging or
by other means. On no account must a fire be taken into the tender
tanks for the purpose of drying or heating the tanks.
32- Sponge Cloth allowance to Enginemen.
The allowance of sponge cloths to enginemen at all depots will
be in accordance with the following schedule:-
Firemen acting continuously as Drivers, will whilst so engaged,
be entitled to the allowance applicable to Drivers,

33- Periodical renewal of Trimmings.
Axlebox trimmings are to be renewed every month, but other trim-
mings can be extended to three (3) months. In removing the trimmings
from axleboxes during the process of re-trimming, it will be found
that quite a number of the trimmings taken from the axleboxes can be
utilised in less important bearings, and the staff responsible for the
trimming of the locomotives should be so informed,

“SAVE
COAL”
The maintenance of correct
boiler water levels is inseparable
from good firing practice. The
injector can, and should be,
adjusted to supply the minimum
quantity of water required to
maintain correct boiler water
levels.
Essential features in the eco-
nomical burning of coal are:—-
(a) High fire-box temperature,
and
(b) Regularity in supply of boiler
feed water.

In order to assist an engineman to acquire a knowledge of how to
calculate speeds, the following formula is used:-
First note the number of seconds it takes to complete a quarter mile
section, then divide the time taken in seconds into 900, this then gives
the speed of the train in M.P.H.
Example, A train takes two minutes to run a quarter of a mile. At what
speed is it travelling:
2 minutes = 120 seconds
Speed = 292
120
= 7? M.P.H.
43“5 Intermediate Draw Gear,
Several types of intermediate drawgear are in use and may be
classified as follows:-
(1) Adjustable Intermediate Drawgear,
This type is fitted to the majority of smaller type tender locomotives
and consists of a single drawbar with two smaller safety links. The radial
rubbing blocks being kept up tight by an adjustable wedge, provided for this
purpose.
(2) Radial Intermediate Drawgear,
This type is identified by two large drawbars with a floating block
between the radial rubbing blocks. Adjustment is also provided by an
adjustable wedge,
(3) Spring Loaded Drawgear,
This type is fitted to 35 class locomotives, a heavy spring being
provided to eliminate play between the rubbing blocks. No adjustment being
provided.


INSTRUCTION AND EXAMINATION OF TRAINEE ENGINEMEN FOR POSITION OF ACTING-
FIREMAN.
In order to prescribe for the progressive training and the
listing of trainee enginemen at the locomotive depots where the absence
of steam locomotives prevents basic training being undertaken on steam
traction, the following procedure is to be applied :
(1) On completion of the currently approved school of instruction for
trainee enginemen the successful candidates are to undergo two (2)
days’ oral and practical instruction in groups of four (4) within
the depot, embracing diesel electric locomotive equipment, jumper
and jumper headstock, preparation, amalgamation, division, stabling
and fireman/observer's duties. On completion thereof the
candidates are to be submitted to oral examination,
(2) The successful candidates are to be accompanied by a travelling
officer for two (2) separate trips on four-wheel goods services
hauled by diesel electric locomotives, for the purpose of
practical instruction in the duties specified in the operating
manual.
In districts where express bogie freight trains predominate and/or
the mechanical staff exchanger is employed the second trip is to
be undertaken on these services.
Having demonstrated their efficiency the trainee enginemen will
be issued by the travelling officer with an observer's competency
certificate, as applicable to shunting duties and four-wheel
type goods services worked by diesel electric locomotives,
(3) On the completion of 80 hours on the aforementioned services the
trainee enginemen are to be again accompanied by a travelling
officer preparatory to being certified and listed for observer's
duties on four-wheel goods trains or, where necessary, on
express bogie freight services and the operation of the mechanical
staff exchanger where applicable,
(4) On completion of a period of six months or 1,000 hours as
fireman/observer, trainee enginemen are to be again accompanied
by travelling officer preparatory to being certified and listed
for observer's duties on goods, mixed and passenger services
(excluding daylight express and interstate passenger trains)
hauled by diesel electric locomotives.
The selection of firemen/observers for express services is to be
arranged in accordance with the approved list, preferably acting
drivers.


(5) Due to the exacting nature of train working on the Illawarra
mountain between Unanderra and Robertson and Blue Mountains
bank between Lighgow and Penrith, it is preferable that acting
drivers or appointed firemen be considered primarily for
fireman/observer's duties on these sections. In order to provide
flexibility it is permissible for the services of acting firemen,
who are listed in accordance with paragraph (4), to be used
when necessary.
(6) Candidates who fail to qualify at any stage are to be treated as
unsuitable for footplate duties, in accordance with the provisions
outlined in Circular N 0 ,30/61,

1- Introduction,
The instructions contained in this section have been compiled for the
guidance of locomotive enginemen in the operation of diesel electric,
diesel hydraulic and electric locomotives, multiple unit diesel and
electric trains.
The requirements of modem railway operation have resulted in the
introduction of the latest types of motive power, resulting in heavier
loads and a higher average speed of trains throughout the railway system.
For a locomotive driver to be successful in the operation of these new
types of traction, it is of the utmost importance, that he be fully
acquainted with the instructions contained herein and since inevitably
further special instructions will be forthcoming from time to time, this
publication should be kept up to date by posting any such instructions
herein} in the space specially provided,
2- Instructions for Coupling of Non-Steam Type Locomotives and Self-
Propelled Trains to Non-Steam And Steam Locomotives in Normal
Working and in Case of Emergency.

NOTEj These instructions will only apply in a locomotive depot, with the
exception of item (b) Brisbane Limited Express working, and does
not apply at wayside or intermediate stations, where a second
locomotive is attached for any reason.


5-6 Haulage of Dead Diesel Electric and Electric Locomotives.
(1) Should a Diesel Electric or Electric Locomotive fail and be left at
a station the qualified driver prior to leaving the unit must secure
the locomotive by means of the hand brake and carry out the normal
stabling duties on the locomotive*
(2) In addition to securing the hand brake on Diesel Electric Locomotives,
the wooden chocks provided on the unit, are to be placed each side of
the N 0,2 wheel on the left hand side of the locomotive, No.l end.
(3) Maintenance Staff is to be contacted and informed of the circumstances

(9) Where locomotives equipped for multiple unit operation are required
to haul a "dead" locomotive of the same type or one which can be
satisfactorily coupled for multiple unit operation, this shall be
carried out in accordance with the instructions laid down for normal
multiple unit working.
In the event of a 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 43 or 49 class engine
failing necessitating its haulage to a depot station the driver in
charge of the train or the engine by which the .disabled unit is to
be hauled, will be responsible for the necessary attention to the
Westinghouse brake requirements prior to the unit being hauled
providing he is qualified to operate such unit. If this driver is
not qualified to operate the unit to he hauled it will be necessary
for a qualified driver or other qualified employee of the Mechanical
Branch to be despatched to the point of failure to perform the
necessary duties.


(10) A Diesel Electric or Electric Locomotive when required to be hauled
dead must not be attached to a train unless a qualified employee is
present and certifies to its fitness to travel.
(11) When a Diesel Electric or Electric Locomotive is being hauled dead
it will not be necessary for it to be accompanied by an employee.
6—6 Haulage of Dead Diesel Hydraulic Locomotives.
Should a Diesel Hydraulic Locomotive fail in service, the following
procedure is to be carried out:—
(1) When working in multiple with a7O class locomotive providing the
reverse indicator shows green when operated for the direction of
travel, the shut-down locomotive may be either leading or trailing
and taken forward under the normal working of the locomotives*
(2) When it is necessary to haul a dead unit with another class of
locomotive, the dead 70 class may be hauled up to a distance of
two miles at a speed not exceeding 10 m.p.h., providing the reverse
indicator shows green, when operated for the direction of travel.
(3) Should it be necessary to haul the dead unit over a distance
exceeding two miles and up to twenty five miles, the transmission
and final drive are to be isolated and the speed is not to exceed
25 m.p.h.
(4) When it is necessary to haul the dead unit over a distance exceeding
twenty five miles, the transmission and final drive are to be
isolated and the coupling rods removed, except when the engine can
run at idle speed, when it is not necessary to remove the coupling
rods.
(5) When the dead unit is hauled by another 70 class locomotive, or by
another class fitted with A.7.E.L. brake equipment, all air hoses
are to be coupled, brake valve isolating cocks closed and brake
valve handles removed on the dead unit.
(6) Should the dead unit be hauled by a steam locomotive, or by another
class not fitted with A.7.E.L. brake equipment, the brake pipe air
hoses are to be coupled also the main reservoir air hoses if
provided, the brake valve isolating cocks closed and brake valve
handles placed in the running position on the dead unit.
NOTE: With steam locomotives it will be necessary to cut in the dead engine
device on the dead unit to provide a main reservoir air supply,
(7) The Maintenance Staff is to be contacted and informed of the
c ircum s tanc e s.


(8) An entry is to be placed in the log book as to the cause of the
failure and any directions that may have been given by the Mainten-
ance Staff,
(9) A Diesel Hydraulic locomotive when required to be hauled dead must
not be attached to a train unless a qualified employee is present
and certifies to its fitness to travel.
(10) When a Diesel Hydraulic is being hauled dead it will not be
necessary for it to be accompanied by an employee.

i+D class Diesel Electric Locomotive 123 tons
41 class Diesel Electric Locomotive 94 tons
42 class Diesel Electric Locomotive 135 tons
43 class Diesel Electric Locomotive 120 tons
44 class Diesel Electric Locomotive 121 tons
45 class Diesel Electric Locomotive 125 tons
48 class Diesel Electric Locomotive SO tons
49 class Diesel Electric Locomotive 91 tons
i+6 class Electric Locomotive 120 tons
70 class Diesel Hydraulic Locomotive 48 tons
8- Disabled Trains Requiring Assistance in the Section.
Trains Hauled by Diesel Electric or Electric Locomotives.
In the case of an emergency, a disabled train may be assisted in the
rear by one 40, 48 or 49 class unit or in the case of these units being
operated in multiple, assistance may be given in the rear, by placing the
engine control switch on the trailing unit to the "idle" position, thus
using the power of the leading unit only. The assisting of trains in the
rear with units other than the 40, 48 or 49 class type is prohibited,
except when specially authorised for bank engine working.
Diesel Electric or Electric Locomotives working as single or double
units may be utilised to haul a disabled train out of the section. Should
it be necessary to utilise a 42 or 43 class unit with N 0,2 end leading to
haul a disabled train out of the section, the locomotive is to be driven
from the No.l end and run at a maximum speed of 15 m.p.h.
During this working, every care must be taken by enginemen to avoid
injury, when looking out of the cab windows to observe the road.


Inter-urban Trains. Procedure to be adopted in dealing with disabled inter-
urban trains is described fully in Regulation 70 on Page 51 of Working of
Electric Trains Book.
NOTE: In the event of amalgamation due to failure, jumpers must not be
inserted between inter-urban trains and electric trains of earlier
types, (S type excepted).
Clause & of regulation 70 regarding assistance to disabled inter-
urban trains by i+£ class locomotives may now be extended to the
Cowan - Gosford - Cowan section in addition to the Penrith - Lithgow -
Penrith section.
Budd Car Trains. In the event of failure, Budd cars may be hauled by any
locomotive equipped with automatic couplings. These cars are provided with
standard automatic coupler and Westinghouse air brake system which enables
them to form or to be marshalled into a normal train and hauled by a
locomotive, provided the car transmissions are isolated.
600. 620 and 900 Class Diesel Trains. In the event of failure, 600, 620 and
900 class diesel trains may be hauled by any type of locomotive, attached by
means of the special emergency couplings carried in the equipment box of
these units.
9-6 Attaching of Diesel Electric and Electric Locomotives to vehicles or
Locomotives fitted with an ordinary drawhook.
(1) A short transition coupling is fitted to the automatic coupler on
locomotives of the 40, 44-, 45 and class type. This coupling is
painted white and is to be used to couple the locomotive to a
passenger or goods vehicle fitted with an ordinary drawhook,
(2) The two links of the standard transition coupling are to be carried
on the locomotive, when not in use,
(3) The two links of the standard transition coupling are to be used to
replace the white links, when it is required to couple to another
looomotive fitted with a drawhook,
(4) On 42, and 43 class locomotives, a standard transition coupling is
fitted to the automatic coupler of the locomotive and is to be used
to couple the locomotive to a passenger of goods vehicle or another
locomotive fitted with a drawhook,
(5) The 42 and 43 class locomotives are fitted with Sharon side operated
automatic coupling and are fitted with standard length transition
links.
When 42 and 43 class locomotives are coupled to a train by means of
the automatic coupling, the transition links should be located on the
opposite side of the automatic coupling operating lever.


The same procedure must be carried out when 42 and 43 class
locomotives are coupled for multiple unit operation,
10- Emergency Working, to Provide Assistance for Victorian Railways
Locomotives on the Standard gauge System. South of Albury.
(1) When assistance is required due to a Victorian Railways Locomotive
failing on the standard gauge system. South of Albury, approval is
hereby given for a New South Wales Railway's Diesel Electric
Locomotive to be employed, where a Victorian &overnment Railway's
locomotive is not available, for the clearing of the section between
Albury and Wodonga with New South Wales Railway's enginemen that are
qualified in Road knowledge over this section,
(2) When it is necessary for the New South Wales Railway's locomotive
and enginemen to proceed beyond Wodonga on the standard gauge system,
the locomotive must be accompanied by a fully qualified Victorian
G-ovemment Railways driver and the movement should be further
supervised within that zone by the depot foreman at Wodonga
Locomotive Depot,
(3) When coupling the locomotives the following procedure is to be
adopted;-
Due to a smaller coupling head on the No, 3 control pipe of the
Victorian Locomotive, this hose cannot be coupled to the No, 3 pipe of
the New South Wales locomotives.
Therefore, when coupling these locomotives, the brake pipe air hose
only is to be coupled between the units, the driver's brake valve
isolating cock or cooks are to be closed and the brake valve handles
placed in the running position on the Victorian Locomotive,
11- Instructions governing the working of Inter-capital express passenger
services.
The following instructions must be observed when working Inter-capital
express passenger services between Sydney and Melbourne and are to be
fully applied by all concerned.
Speed of approach to Central Station Terminal Platforms, 1, 2 and 3:
The speed of entry of Up inter-capital trains to Nos, 1, 2 and 3
platforms is not to exceed 10 miles per hour and at a point midway in
the platform the speed is to be further reduced appropriately to meet
the regulation cautious approach towards the buffer stops. Yellow
paint marks have been located on each of these platforms endorsed with
the word 'CAB', This mark is to be approached with great care in
order that a precision stop will be made with the operating cab window
at the yellow sign 'CAB*, Such a location provides a gap of approx-
imately 18-feet between the locomotive buffers and the platform buffer
stops.


Due to the altered length of the inter-capital trains, the train
examiners employed in wayside inspection, will necessarily be located
appropriately further back from the existing sites and train speed is
to be regulated accordingly.
Locations for stopping Inter-capital trains at Goulburn. Junee and
Albury platforms in each direction; Nos. 1 and 2 inter-capital
expresses will have intermediate stops restricted to Goulburn and
Albury in each direction. At G-oulburn, in each direction, the train
is to be stopped with the leading car at the departure end of the
platform, thus providing for Traffic Branch needs, also access to the
locomotive at ground level for wayside inspection purposes.
In regard to the intermediate traffic requirements for Nos. 3 and 4
'Spirit of Progress* expresses; No. 3 will stop at Moss Vale,
Goulburn, Yass Junction, Harden, Cootamundra, Junee, Wagga Wagga,
The Rock, Culcairn and Albury. On No. 3 departing Sydney on Sundays,
Tuesdays and Thursdays the brakevan will be marshalled trailing from
Sydney and requires to be stopped at the arrival end of the above-
mentioned platforms. Departing Sydney on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays
and Saturdays, the brakevan of No. 3 will be marshalled leading from
Sydney and requires to be stopped at the departure end of the platform
concerned.
In the case of No. 4. the train brakevan will be marshalled leading
ex Melbourne, departing that point on Sundays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and
Fridays and will need to stop at the departure end of platforms at
Culcairn, The Rock, Wagga Wagga, Junee, Cootamundra, Harden, Yass
Junction, Goulburn, Moss Vale and Strathfield,
On departure from Melbourne on Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays, the
power van (PHN) will convey intermediate parcel traffic and the guard
of the train will travel therein. This van will be marshalled trailing
from Melbourne and will need to be stopped at the arrival end of the
platforms mentioned on these days.
To provide for these conditions, at all stations where the trains are
to be drawn beyond the departure end of the platform (where brakevan is
marshalled on rear end of train) white marker pegs 3*6" high are
installed and the locomotive is to be brought to a stand with the
driver's cab window opposite these pegs.
Indications between locomotive crew and guard - hand signals by day and
by night: Electric hand signal lamps will be supplied to each
locomotive working these services and the lamps are to be used by night
by the fireman to acknowledge the first and second right-away signals
from the guard, or with the conductor repeating the guard's signal and
the hand is to be used by day, for similar purposes, to eliminate all
unnecessary whistling. The hand signals from the guard or conductor to
the driver, must be the regulation green light or green flag.


On Nos* 1 and 2 expresses, a conductor suitably equipped and
located in car DAM 5» will be responsible for relaying the guard’s
right-away signal*
With regards to Nos* 3 and. 4 expresses, the conductor in car 19 will
be required to act similarly*
Westinghouse air brake equipment on inter-capital trains: These
trains are equipped with non-metallic brake blocks, the
characteristics of which are different from the cast-iron brake
blocks and this item is to be fully considered by the locomotive
driver* The brake pipe pressure is to be set to precisely 70 p,s»i.
The braking force at high speed is much more pronounced than with
the cast-iron blocks, but in the speed range from i+O miles per hour
down to ’stop’, the brake force does not increase as with the cast-
iron blocks and very careful approaches should therefore be made to
platform and signal locations, until at least drivers are fully
acquainted with these characteristics*
Operating procedure to ensure that triple valve reactions are
correctly achieved: Due to brake pipe volume the initial and
automatic minimum reduction of 7 p*s,i, takes longer than with a
conventional train and where a speed adjustment of a minor nature is
to be made, care must be taken not to interfere with or reduce the
approved 7 lb. minimum application. Such interferences will not only
tend to prevent sufficient differential of brake pipe and auxiliary
reservoir pressures, but further, on the release and due to the
recharge rate, would quite probably cause an overcharge in portion
of the brake pipe at least.
Continuity tests; Such tests at the requisite sites are initiated
by the guard not less than five (5) minutes before the scheduled
departure time and the Chief Traffic Manager has been requested to
notify his guards accordingly* Again, due to the brake pipe volume,
it will be appreciated that if such tests are initiated with less than
the five (5) minute margin before train departure time, then a late
start will be incurred,
12-6 Emergency procedure where one locomotive fails en-route on Inter-
capital express passenger services.
No, 1 and 2 Melbourne Limited Express and Nos* 3 and 4 Spirit of
Progress services.
The following procedure may be adopted when the aforementioned
services are worked by two diesel electric locomotives in multiple
unit working and one locomotive fails en-route:-


(i) When one locomotive fails and the assistance by any class of
locomotive is not readily available, the complete train may be hauled
by the remaining lodomotive to the next siding in advance, where the
defective locomotive is to be stowed. The train may then be worked
forward by the single locomotive until assistance is provided. Where
the nature of the defect does not prevent the haulage of the ’dead*
locomotive in the composition of the train, it will be permissible to
haul the complete train forward by the single locomotive to the point
where a relief locomotive is available or to its destination,
(ii) However, between Goulbum and Harefield (Down direction) and
Harefield and Junee (Up direction) where grades of 1 in 40 are to be
negotiated, and assistance is not available to work the train forward,
this working is not to be adopted. In such cases the locomotives may
be detached from the train and the defective locomotive taken forward
and stowed in the next siding, the locomotive in working order is then
to return to the train and work train forward until assistance is
provided,
(iii) It is permissible for a third locomotive of the diesel electric
or electric class to be attached in the lead for the purpose of
conveying the train to the next siding in advance where the defective
locomotive is to be stowed. During such movement the speed of the
train may conform to existing speed board permissions.
No. 1 and 2 Brisbane Limited Express services.
The following procedure may be adopted when Brisbane Limited Express
services are worked by two diesel electric locomotives and one
locomotive failed en route
(1) When the load consists of 543 tons and one locomotive fails and
assistance by any class of locomotive is not readily available, the
complete train may be hauled by the remaining locomotive to the next
siding in advance, where the defective locomotive is to be stowed.
The train may then be worked forward by the single locomotive until
assistance is provided by an electric, diesel electric or steam
locomotive.
(2) However, where grades of lin 40 are to be negotiated, and assistance
is not available to work the train forward, this working is not to be
adopted.
In such cases the locomotives may be detached from the train and the
defective locomotive taken forward and stowed in the next siding, the
locomotive in working order is then to return to the train and work the
train forward until assistance is provided,
(3) When the load of these express services is in excess of 543 tons, but
does not exceed 630 tons and grades of 1 in 50 or steeper are to be
negotiated, the provisions in clause (2) are to apply.


(4) On the section Hawkesbury River - Cowan (Up direction), the trailing
load for a single 44 class diesel electric locomotive must not
exceed 600 tons.
13- Diesel Electric Locomotives arriving at Sydney Terminal Platforms,
When trains worked by Diesel Electric Locomotives arrive at Sydney
Terminal platforms on the Up journey, the Diesel Electric Locomotive
after being uncoupled from the train is to be shut down, unless
otherwise directed.
This does not apply to No, 2 Melbourne Limited Express or No, 4
Spirit of Progress, when on arrival at Sydney Terminal Platforms,
the diesel engine is to be left running until the train has been set
back and the locomotives uncoupled from the train,
14- general instructions for the use of dynamic and regenerative braking
on diesel electric and electric locomotives,
(1) The first part of this instruction gives limits to the amount of
braking which can be applied to different types of trains. The
second part of the instruction gives special instructions applying to
three particular cases of operating on special grades between North
Strathfield and G-osford and between Lithgow and Emu Plains and
between Moss Vale and Unanderra,
Limits of Regenerative and Dynamic Braking,
(2) Passenger trains fitted with automatic couplers and automatically
coupled bogie express, goods and livestock trains.
Maximum regenerative or dynamic
Class of locomotive: braking allowed.
One , 46* class Series or series parallel regenerative
brake up to a maximum armature current
of 700 amps.
Two *46* class Series or series parallel regenerative
brake up to a maximum armature current
of 350 amps.
One *4s' class Dynamic brake up to 650 amps.
One , 42* class Dynamic brake up to 700 amps.
Two ’42' or *4s* class Dynamic brake up to 500 amps,
(One *43* or *44' class Dynamic brake up to 450 amps,
or two *43* or *44'
class)


(3) Passenger Trains fitted with Drawhooks and Buffers;
Class of locomotive; Maximum regenerative or dynamic braking
allowed.
One '46' class Regenerative braking in series parallel to
a maximum of 350 amps, or in series to a
maximum of 700 amps, and notch 5«
One '42’ or ’4s* class Dynamic brake up to 500 amps.
One *43' *44* class Dynamic brake up to 450 amps.
Where two locomotives are employed in multiple unit, their braking
effort as indicated on the ammeter or load meter should not exceed
half the figure prescribed for one locomotive,
(4) Goods of livestock trains marshalled with not less than 250 tons of
automatic coupled vehicles, each with a gross load of not less than
20 tons, immediately behind the locomotive.
The limits are the same as those prescribed in clause (2) for
automatically coupled passenger trains and bogie express, goods and
livestock trains.
(5) G-oods or livestock trains with a vehicle having a gross load less
than 20 tons in the 250 tons adjacent to the locomotive.
The limits are the same as those prescribed in clause (3) for passenger
trains fitted with drawhooks and buffers.
Special instructions to be applied to the Section described below:
(6) Use of regenerative brake between North Strathfield and Gosford;
On this section of line the Substations are equipped with resistances
for absorbing power put back into the overhead wire. Uses of the
regenerative brake is permitted wherein the train composition, is such,
that all automatic coupled vehicles are marshalled leading and that no
wagon within the first third of the total train tonnage is of less gross
weight than 20 tons.
The amount of current regenerated should be reduced if the line voltage
exceeds 1900 volts.
Goods trains hauled by '46* class locomotives on the falling grades
between Hornsby and Eyde and between Cowan and Hawkesbury River, should
be operated in series regeneration up to notch 5 at between 20 and 25
miles per hour. Where such regenerated current as shown on the armature
ammeter reaches 700 amps and is rising, the automatic air brake should
be used to supplement the regenerative brake as found necessary.


(7) Up Livestock Trains between Lithgow and Enfield - Maximum load
tens:
Provided that the composition of these trains dees not include a
total load of stock wagons in excess of 500 tons, and that the goods
composition, marshalled in front of the livestock wagons, does not
include any wagon with a gross load of less than 20 tons, the
regenerative brake may be used on the *46' class locomotives, hauling
such load compositions, between Wentworth Falls and Emu Plains,
strictly in accordance with the following procedure
(a) The goods portion of these livestock trains must be certified
for H, P, grade control working by the Train Examiner at
Lithgow, who will fix all such grade control valves in the I.P.
position at Coal Stage and these are to be retained in this
position through the run to Plemington.
(b) The train is to be controlled by Westinghouse automatic brake
force between Katoomba and Wentworth Palls.
If, in this process, the driver finds that the Westinghouse air brake
is not satisfactorily controlling the train with grade control valves
in the I.P. position, the train is to be brought to a stand and the
handles of grade control valves to be placed in Holding position and
the train worked to times of ordinary stock working.
(c) If the Westinghouse air brake force is found satisfactory at
Wentworth Palls, the regenerative brake should be set up in
series parallel combination at a train speed of about 25 miles
per hour.
The regenerative brake lever should be notched out to notch 15,
to provide the maximum regenerative force, as required. However,
the regenerated current must never be allowed to exceed 700 amps,
on the armature ammeter.
To limit this current to 700 amps, it may be necessary to
supplement the forces controlling the train, with light to
moderate automatic brake applications on the l/33 gradients.
(d) When a fixed signal is seen to be in the •caution' position, or
where any hand or detonator signal requires a train speed
reduction, the automatic air brake is to be immediately applied
with the desired force and, when the reducing train speed causes
the traction motor armature ammeter to indicate zero, the
throttle is to be closed (to prevent motoring) and the automatic
air brake is to then be used solely to comply with signal
conditions encountered,
(e) With normal line voltages, the employment of series parallel
combination for regenerative braking at maximum excitation of
the motor fields, a speed of about 24-25 miles per hour will be
indicated as zero balance on the armature ammeter.


A speed of approx. 28 m.p.h. will be indicated at 530 amps, on the
armature ammeter.
A speed of 30 m.p,h, will be indicated by 700 amps, on the armature
ammeter.
The maximum permissible speed between Wentworth Palls and Valley
Heights is 30 m.p,h.
The maximum permissible speed between Valley Heights and Emu Plains
is 35 m,p»h. (this speed will produce 700 amps, on the armature
ammeter with the regeneration lever on notch 11).
The maximum permissible speed between Emu Plains and Parramatta is
40 m.p*h.
These trains will be routed through Katoomba non-stop at a reduced
speed of 5 m.p,h. between the Up Second Home and Up Starting signals
to permit of axlebox inspection by the train examiner, and through
Valley Heights at normal train speeds,
(8) Up Poods Trains between Katoomba and Emu Plains, maximum load 1100
tons:
(a) Existing grade control regulations remain in force, except that
there must be 500 tons of automatic coupler vehicles all
marshalled together next to the engine. The guard must certify
to this, also that there is no vehicle of less than 20 tons
gross weight included in the front half of the tonnage making up
the train.
(b) Westinghouse air brake is to be used to control the train
between Katoomba and Wentworth Palls, this is for the purpose
of determining the control of the train available by this means
should the regenerative brake fail or not be used. If, on this
section, the driver is not satisfied that he can control the
train satisfactorily by this means only, then existing
instructions regarding the operation of the train by
Westinghouse air brake under these conditions shall be put into
effect, and sufficient hand brakes shall be applied to allow the
train to be safely controlled.
(c) If, with the above conditions being such as to permit
regenerative braking to be used, and Wentworth Palls Up Home
signal shews ’clear* speed also having been reduced to 20 m.pji,
for the purpose, the regenerative brake is then to be set up in
'series combination* and the regeneration lever adjusted to
notch 5.
(d) When train speed causes the regenerated current, as shown on the
traction motor ammeter, to approach 700 amps, (the corresponding
speed will be about 22 m.p,h.) the regeneration handle should be
moved to notch 4.


When the traction motor ammeter current again approaches 700 amps
(corresponding speed being 24 m.p.h,) the automatic brake is to be
applied with such force as to prevent any further speed rise and, as
well, gradually to reduce the train speed. This is usually achieved
by a service application (varying with train composition) between
7 p.s.i. and 15 p.s.i.
When train speed drops the traction motor ammeter reading will also
drop, and at approximately 350 amps, which usually indicates a train
speed of 19 m.p.h., the automatic brake should be released.
In cycle, this method of controlling the train speed is to be applied,
by use of the regenerative brake on the locomotive and the Westinghouse
air brake on the train from Wentworth Palls to Valley Heights.
(e) The maximum permissible speed is 'series regeneration* between
Katoomba and Valley Heights is 25 m.p.h. and the running allowance
of 63 minutes is quite equitable. (NOTE: 25 m.p.h. is indicated on
the traction motor ammeter as 700 amps, with notch 4 of the regeneration
lever employed.)
(f) After departure from Valley Heights, and at a speed of 25 m.p.h.
the regenerative brake should again be set up in the series parallel
combination. Adjustments to the regeneration handle to notch 9 or 10
will provide sufficient brake force to control train speed at about
33 m.p.h. with approximately 700 amps, reading on the traction motor
ammeter. The maximum speed in series parallel regeneration between
Valley Heights and Emu Plains is 35 m.p.h,
(g) Where speed is to be considerably reduced, or a stop made, the
automatic air brake is to be applied for the purpose and the driver
must be on the alert to close the throttle (acclerating handle) precisely
when the traction motor ammeter shows zero, otherwise powerful motoring
of the locomotive will commence. In any emergency stop however, it is
best to close the throttle as soon as the automatic air brake application
for such stop has been made, so as to ensure the quickest stop possible
and to avoid any risk of overlooking the need for this action later.
(9) Dynamic Braking of Up G-oods Trains between Moss Vale and Unanderra.
The dynamic brake may be used on '44' and. '4s* class locomotives for
the control of Up goods trains between Moss Vale and Unanderra subject
to the following conditions;-
The air brake should be relied upon to control the train wholly between
Robertson and Mt, Murray, in order to permit of accurate assessment of
such force before the heavy descent after Summit Tank,


Between Mt* Murray and the bottom of the 1/60 gradient, the dynamic
brake force should be similarly tested*
Where two '44* or '4s' class locomotives are employed in controlling
and Up goods load, similar procedure is to be adopted between
Robertson and Summit Tank.
Between Summit Tank and Unanderra with one '44* or one '4s* class
locomotive controlling the train, the dynamic brake should be
availed of at full force. Similarly, when two *44‘ class locomotives
are used for controlling the train, full dynamic brake force may be
availed of at full force, but in the case of two »45» class loco-
motives, this is to be limited to 450 amps, on each locomotive,
making a combined dynamic braking force of 900 amps when operating
with two locomotives.
The Westinghouse air brake should be employed to suppliment the
dynamic braking force, to control the train in the correct speed
range.
15- Propelling of Diesel Electric and Electric Locomotives.
Diesel Electric Locomotives that can be driven from either end,
Electric Locomotives, or Diesel Electric and Electric Locomotives
operating in multiple, must not be propelled when working under the
guidance of fixed signals, in such cases the locomotive is to be
operated from the cab in the direction of travel.
The propelling of these units in traffic is only permitted when such
movement is under the guidance of a competent traffic employee
exhibiting the necessary hand signals.
The propelling of Diesel Electric and Electric Locomotives of this
type in locomotive depots is not permitted, unless a defect on the
unit renders it impossible to operate from the correct cab, under
these conditions a competent employee must pilot the locomotive.
The shunting of locomotives must at all times be. carried out in such
a manner that they may be stopped promptly, so as to avoid
collisions and derailments, also when units are being shunted for any
reason, the air brake must be available and operative at nll times*
16- Diesel Electric Locomotives: Collisions and Derailments.
In the event of a diesel electric locomotive being involved in a
collision or derailment, the unit (or units) involved must be shut
down and not restarted until authorised by maintenance staff, due
to the possibility of damage to the crank shaft and electrical
equipment,


17- Recording of Fuel Remaining on Diesel Electric Locomotives.
"... Enginemen are directed that when changing over on diesel
electric locomotives, the driver is to check the quantity of fuel oil
remaining in the tank and the out going driver is to record same in the
log book. There must be no failure to carry out this instruction,
FUELLING OF DIESEL ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES.
18- Margins of Fuel at Turn-Round Points,
All diesel electric locomotives departing from Delec, Wollongong,
Newcastle and Yeerongpilly are to be fuelled to capacity, irrespective
of the working to be performed.
At all other depots, units are to be fuelled in accordance with
the minimum requirements for the service rostered.
If the destination of a unit is altered, or, if the locomotive
is transferred to another service, or altered and placed on a full
goods load after being rostered to work an express goods or express
passenger train, the Control Officer making the adjustment will at
once notify the Mechanical Branch and at the same time, confer and
arrange, if necessary, for any additional fuel to be supplied.
In addition to the existing requirements of locomotive enginemen
checking and recording the fuel residue when taking charge of engines
at various points, it is essential that supervising officers should
ensure that the minimum quantities of fuel has been provided to each
locomotive prior to departing from the depot.
It should also be noted that provision has been made at the
bottom of each engine log sheet for the amount of fuel added at inter-
mediate stations to be recorded. In the past, fuel has been added to
locomotives and the entry has not been made in the space provided.
In order to facilitate the maintenance of satisfactory records
appertaining to fuel consumption, it is imperative that supervising
officers instruct the staff under their control in the correct method
of recording issues of fuel to locomotives.
All figures quoted in the following information will be for main
line diesel electric locomotives, unless otherwise stated, and the
quantities shown will be the minimum required.

The driver is to direct the fireman to take the readings enumerated
under items 4, 5 and. 6 after the locomotive has been fully loaded for
not less than ten minutes and to make an appropriate entry on the Log
Sheet.
NOTE: Items 4, 5 and 6 do not apply when working 42 and 49 class
locomotives,
21-6 Persons authorised to travel on locomotives.
(1) Rule 21 provides that (in addition to the driver and fireman)
station-masters, inspectors, guards, shunters and other employees may
ride on an engine when directed to do so in the execution of their
duties. In such cases, written or printed authority is not required,
(2) When guards or enginemen, after signing on duty, are required to
proceed from the sign-on point to another point for the purpose of
working a train, effecting relief, or to return to their home depot,
or another station, depot or relief point, or to a station where
resting accommodation is provided after completing duty or for any
other purpose they are to travel by train, other means of conveyance
or by any light engine as directed by the station-master or other
controlling officer.
The total number of employees travelling on any single light engine
in such circumstances is not to exceed 5, including the driver and
fireman in charge of the light engine. In all such cases it will be
the responsibility of* the Traffic and Mechanical officers controlling
the guards and/or enginemen to confer regarding the number of men
required to travel by any light engine, and employees so travelling
are to be directed to the point at which they will join the light
engine,
(3) Guards and enginemen travelling passenger on electric, diesel electric
or diesel hydraulic light engines may travel in the driver's operating
compartment or alternatively in the rear driving compartment of a
single unit or the unoccupied driving compartment of the trailing
locomotive when they are coupled together and working in multiple.
In all cases the employees travelling passenger must confer with the
driver regarding the position in which they are to travel.
Except in special circumstances, guards should only be rostered to
travel passenger on steam locomotives or on engines on which seating
accommodation is not available for distances not exceeding 15 miles.


(4) Equipment examiners when proceeding to the scene of a disabled
electric train may be permitted to ride on any light engine. On
receipt of information that such an employee desires to so travel,
the traffic staff concerned must make the necessary arrangements for
the stoppage of the engine to enable the equipment examiner to join
it; and the driver must again stop the engine at the required point
to enable the equipment examiner to alight,
(5) Drivers and firemen must not allow any person other than those shown
herein to ride on an engine or tender without written or printed
authority.
Exceptions.
(a) Enginemen, up to four in number, are permitted to travel
passenger by single unit diesel electric or diesel hydraulic
locomotive between South Brisbane and Yeerongpilly in either
direction, when a suitable suburban service is not available.
(b) Doctors Travelling by Light Engines—ln very serious cases of
illness or accident, where the prompt attention of a medical
man might save life, and a light engine is running in the
direction required, a Doctor may be allowed to travel by it but
only by the permission of the station-master or other
controlling officer. This authority must not be exercised
except in extreme cases, and particulars of each instance are to
be reported to the Chief Traffic Manager, through the District
Traffic Superintendent,
(c) One employee of the Banana Growers Federation in possession of an
authority to travel on an engine shall be permitted, when
accompanied by a Traffic Branch employee who must also be in
possession of the requisite authority, to ride in the. driving
compartment of a diesel electric or diesel hydraulic locomotive
working a goods train between Landrigans and Coff's Harbour as
required, to facilitate loading of consignments of bananas at the
various banana loading platforms.
Unauthorised Persons are not permitted to take charge of locomotives.
Drivers must not permit unauthorised persons to take charge of
locomotives and it should be specially noted that those Running
Inspectors who are empowered to take charge of engines for the purpose
of demonstrating or imparting instructions to enginemen, or for any
other special purpose, have the requisite authority in the form of a
rubber stamped endorsement on their book passes as follows
"Authorised to take charge of engine".
Before the driver permits the officers indicated to take charge of his
engine for the purposes enumerated, he must satisfy himself that they
have the necessary authority.


22- Maximum Speeds for Diesel Electri*. Diesel Hydraulic and Electric
Locomotives.
The following are the maximum speeds laid down for the various
classes of locomotives and must not be exceededs-
-40 class Diesel Electric Locomotives 70 m.p.h*
41 class Diesel Electric Locomotives 35 m.p.h,
42 class Diesel Electric Locomotives 70 m.p.h,
43 class Diesel Electric Locomotives 70 m.p.h,
44 class (Modified gearing) 70 m.p.h.
44 class (tearing not Modified) 63 m.p.h.
45 class Diesel Electric Locomotives 70 m.p.h.
48 class Diesel Electric Locomotives 65 m,p,h,
49 class Diesel Electric Locomotives 65 m.p.h,
46 class Electric Locomotive 65 m.p.h,
70 class Diesel Hydraulic (Low ratio) 22*5 m.p,h,
70 class Diesel Hydraulic (High ratio) 45 m.p.h,
23- Drivers to be Qualified when operating Multiple Unit Diesel Electric
Locomotives.
When a driver is required to operate Diesel Electric Locomotives in
multiple unit working and such units are of a mixed type, the driver
must be qualified for each type of unit that is being worked,
24- Part Preparation of Diesel Electric Locomotives.
The preparation of Diesel Electric Locomotives is under normal
circumstances to be carried out by the outgoing enginemen. When
conditions do not permit of this being carried out, the locomotive is
to be fully prepared for the outgoing enginemen, who will then sign
on "engine prepared".
Part preparation of Diesel Electric Locomotives is not permitted,
under any circumstances. Drivers signing on "engine prepared" must
at the first available opportunity, check that the unit is operating
efficiently and that the ground relay knife switch is closed and
sealed*


25-6 Fire Fighting Equipment on Diesel Electric, Diesel Hydraulic and
Electric Locomotives.
The following locomotives are equipped with cylindrical type foam and
C0 2 gas (Carbon Dioxide) fire extinguishers.
Diesel Electric Locomotives: Two foam and one COg gas.
Diesel Hydraulic Locomotives: One foam and one gas.
'46' Class Electric Locomotives: Three C0 2 gas.
The foam extinguishers are painted blue* and are for the purpose of
controlling oil fires, which may originate in the engine room. The
fire is quelled by a smothering action, induced by a large quantity
of foam from the extinguisher.
The CO gas extinguisher, which is painted red, is for the purpose of
controlling fires originating in the electric circuits of the
locomotive. The fire is quelled by the production of a heavy gas
which has a smothering effect on the fire to extinguish it. This
extinguisher may also be used on other types of fires.
The use of the foam extinguisher on electrical fires is not desirable,
unless a. COp gas extinguisher is not available, as considerable
.inning of electrical equipment, is necessary, after its use, and at
the same time there is an element of risk from electrical shock when
using foam extinguishers on electrical fires.
The operation of both types of extinguishers is as follows:-
Foam Extinguisher for Oil Fires;
1, Detach the blue extinguisher from its stand and carry to a point
adjacent to the fire,
2. Open the wheel valve at the top of the extinguisher (anti-clockwise)
and place the thumb on the hose nozzle to build up the pressure
within the extinguisher.
Invert the extinguisher and direct the nozzle at the This type
of extinguisher is not controllable and will empty itself in
approximately one (l) minute of it being inverted,
COp (CARBON DIOXIDE) Extinguisher - for all types of fires;
1, Detach the red extinguisher from its stand and carry to a point
adjacent to the fire,
2, Remove the safety pin from the control valve and squeeze the grip.


3» Direct the hose nozzle at the fire, be careful to keep your fingers
on the wooden hand grip.
Then by squeezing the control valve grip, allow the contents of the
extinguisher to be sprayed quickly backwards and forwards across the
fire. The contents of the extinguisher can be controlled by the
operation of the control valve at the top of the extinguisher. Its
contents will be exhausted after approximately one (l) minute of
operation.
When fire breaks out, when practicable, isolate the locomotive or
vehicle to prevent the fire from spreading and in the case of an
out-break of fire on a Diesel Electric, Diesel Hydraulic or Electric
Locomotive, shut the engine down and pull the battery switch.
NOTE: It is the responsibility of enginemen to examine the seals on
CO 2 in preparation and at change-over points
enroute to ensure that the seal has not been broken. If the
seal has been broken, same must be recorded in the log book
and at a depot where spare extinguishers are stocked, a
replacement must be obtained,
26- Diesel Electric or Electric Locomotives not to stand over de-ashing
pits. ~ ■“
Due to fire hazard and the damage that could result to traction
motors and their cables, diesel electric or electric locomotives must
not be allowed to stand on ash pits when it is known that these pits
contain hot ashes.
27- 6 Diesel Electric Locomotives; Unauthorised Interference with governors.
Governors on Diesel Electric Locomotives have allegedly been
interfered with and it has been brought under notice that enginemen
have used "car oil" (from the square can carried for emergency use
for hot boxes on vehicles), in electric hydraulic governors of diesel
electric units, when the oil supply in same has become low. This oil
is unsuitable for this purpose and enginemen are directed that no oil
whatever is to be added to electro hydraulic governors on diesel
electric locomotives on the main line by enginemen except and where,
to meet the condition of a shut down, the enginemen personally contact
the depot authority for special permission to do so, and this action
must be entered in the log book,
28 “ 8 Diesel Electric Locomotives; Passage over Points and Crossovers.
Due to the number of flashovers that have occurred on traction motors
it is brought to the notice of drivers of diesel electric locomotives*
that during the passage over points and crossing, there is
considerable impact on the traction motors, which are mounted on the
axles, and this is liable to cause brush bounce thereby resulting in
a flashover on the traction motors.


To overcome this the brush pressure has been increased as much as
possible, however to assist in the prevention of flashovers drivers
should coast over points and crossings wherever this is practicable
and especially when running at high speed,
29- Diesel Theatric Locomotives: Wheel Slip Relays not to be operated
manually,
Diesel electric locomotives have been extensively damaged due,
apparently, to the fact that the wheel slip relay had been manually
operated by being held open after wheel slip indications had been
registered. This allowed the motor with a loose pinion to speed up
and burst,
Enginemen are directed that under no circumstances are wheel slip
relays to be operated manually. Notices to this effect are displayed
near the wheel slip relays on some locomotives and the remainder are
now being so fitted,
30- Damage to Traction Motors due to Incorrect Practices,
To prevent damage to traction motors due to the incorrect operation of
the reverser handle, the attention of enginemen is directed to the
need for the strict regard to the standing instructions in regard to
ensuring that the locomotive is absolutely stationary before the
reverser is thrown and further that current is never applied whilst a
train is making any movement contrary to the reverser positioning.
31- Diesel Electric and Electric Locomotives: Inspection of Engine Rooms.
Locomotives of the 40, 41, 45, 48 and 49 classes are of the road
switcher type and are equipped with access doors to the engine and
generator compartments from the open side foot plate walkways.
On these types, enginemen must not leave the operating cab to inspect
or adjust engine compartment details, except that the locomotive is
first brought to a stand.
Similarly when these types are employed in multiple unit working,
drivers and firemen must not attempt to join the cab of the trailing
unit from their operating station in the front unit for any purpose
unless the locomotives have first been brought to a stand.
Diesel electric and electric locomotives of the 42, 45, 44 and 46 class
type have stream—lined bodies and provide for internal access to
engine room details.
Where a fault develops with this locomotive type, single unit or
multiple unit working, the driver must not leave his operating station
to investigate such before first bringing the locomotive to a stand.
On these stream-lined types, a fireman may, on the specific direction
of the driver, leave his operating station for the purpose of
investigating, and/or, correcting faults in the engine rooms of either


the first locomotive, or the second locomotive in multiple unit
working*
This does not apply to I+6 class units operating in multiple, when the
locomotives must be brought to a stand before attempting to join the
trailing unit,
32-6 Diesel Electric and Electric Locomotives; Defective Speedometers.
When speedometers become faulty or inaccurate they cannot always be
immediately replaced or rectified, which can cause serious anomalies
in train working.
To overcome this defect, wherever possible, arrangements are to be made,
at least in the case of fast express multiple unit working, to have
the speed recorder in good order in the leading locomotive, either by
re-marshalling the locomotives or by interchanging the defective
speedometer. When operating fast express trains with single units,
the defective speedometer is to be interchanged wherever possible, to
have a speed recorder in good order in the leading cab of the
locomotive.
In cases of speedometer being interchanged, a log book entry should be
made for Delec Records,
Due to different wheel diameters on locomotives a variation between the
reading on speedometers of up to three miles per hour at a speed of
sixty m,p,h. is permitted,
33~6 Drivers failing to send advice on locomotive defects.
When locomotive trouble develops during train working, the driver,
should he require the services of a fitter or an electrician, is to
send advice to the depot in advance and in so doing it is always
helpful if the driver concerned, in sending his message ahead,
includes the probable cause in either its mechanical or electrical
origin or the indications being given by the defect.
34-6 The placing of Jumper Couplings on Locomotives after Multiple Unit
Operation.
To ensure that each locomotive is provided with a jumper coupling,
which may be wholly availed of when required for multiple unit
operation, it is required that when locomotives are to be coupled for
multiple unit operation, the jumper coupling to be employed must
invariably be drawn from the locomotive with the lowest number and
returned to such locomotive after use.


35- *4o* class Diesel Electric Locomotives running short of sand.
Due to the prolonged traffic availability of *40 1 class diesel
electric locomotives after departure from Delec depot and their
characteristics towards slipping when working heavy goods trains, a
number of casualties have been caused by the depletion of the sand
boxes on these locomotives.
The sand boxes of '4o* class locomotives are so constructed that
after a short period of running it is not possible for enginemen to
obtain a visual guide as to the sand residue still remaining in the
boxes when preparing and stabling these units, with the result that
at depots where staff is not available for re-sanding, the sand boxes
are often depleted during the running of trains.
To reduce the number of casualties resulting from depleted sand boxes
on '4o’ class locomotives, arrangements are to be made that on every
occasion these locomotives are turned into locomotive depots for any
purpose, the sand boxes are to be filled to capacity,
36- Kits on Diesel Electric Locomotives; Attention en route.
It has been brought under notice that diesel electric locomotive kits
are not being maintained in a clean condition. Observers are to
ensure that the kit is kept clean en route, and that at the
termination of trip all loose items of kit equipment are placed in
kit bucket in a clean condition,
37- Diesel Electric, Diesel Hydraulic and Electric Locomotives: Air
Hoses to be secured when not in use.
Enginemen are instructed that air hoses fitted to diesel electric
locomotives, diesel hydraulic, and electric locomotives MUST be
secured to the dummy couplings when not in use; cases are repeatedly
coming under notice where this is not done. Resulting from this
neglect, irregularities have occurred due to brake pipe cocks being
struck and closed by a swinging hose, Enginemen are again directed
that air hoses must be secured to the dummy couplings, without fail,
when not in use.
Cases coming under notice of failure to carry out this instruction
will be seriously viewed and will result in disciplinary action being
taken with employees responsible,
38- Supply of Spare Air HoseS on Diesel Electric, Diesel Hydraulic and
Electric Locomotives,
The following spare air hoses are to be carried on the various classes
of locomotives and must be secured by use of the suitable brackets
provided for this purpose.


Diesel Electric Locomotives: 1 brake pipe air hose
‘46‘ Class Electric Locomotives: 1 brake pipe air hose
1 main reservoir air hose
1 brake cylinder air hose
1 sanding air hose
Diesel Hydraulic Locomotives: 1 brake pipe air hose
39-6 Method of securing Diesel Electric and Electric Locomotives.
When diesel electric or diesel hydraulic locomotives are stabled at
Locomotive depots or at out-stations, they are to be secured by the
proper application of the hand brake and in addition, the two wooden
chocks provided, are to be placed on the rails, each side of the
No, 2 wheel on the left hand side of locomotive, i,e. No, 1 end
leading,
NOTE: An excessive number of chocks are being issued for use on
these locomotives, involving considerable expense, due to the
failure of employees to remove the chocks from the rail before moving
the locomotive. Employees are therefore instructed, that before
moving a locomotive, the wooden chocks are to be removed from the rail
and placed on the locomotive, with the other items of the kit,
4-0-6 Stabling of Locomotives at Out-Stations,
Where diesel electric, diesel hydraulic or electric locomotives are
required to be stabled at Traffic Branch locations, these stabling
sites must not include marshalling yards, or running roads, but such
locomotives are to be stabled in dead end sidings or docks, preferably
protected by catch points and on levels.
The locomotive must be shut down and secured in the regulation
manner,
4-1-6 Diesel Electric, Diesel Hydraulic and Electric Locomotives, not to be
stabled near Locomotives in Steam.
Due to the danger of fire or other damage that may be caused to
Diesel Electric, Diesel Hydraulic and Electric Locomotives, they must
not be stabled on a road near or adjacent to a live steam locomotive
at any depot,


42- *46* class Locomotives: Use of Cab Heaters and good Varmera.
There has been a number of failures of the supply motor generator
sets on *46* class locomotives due to a deterioration in the
commutator condition, this being brought about by overloading of the
generator, due to enginemen having the cab heaters and food warmers
switched on at both ends of the locomotive.
To overcome this failure, enginemen are instructed, that under no
circumstances must the cab heaters and food warmers be left switched
on in the rear cabin of these locomotives, thus avoiding failures
which result in inconvenience to themselves,
43- *46' class Locomotives; Irregular use of Pantographs and Jumper
Couplings,
There has been some neglect by enginemen employed on bank engine
working to remove and store jumper couplings after each use and
further, the failure to fully observe the correct operation of
pantographs in light engine running,
Enginemen are instructed that after each use, jumper couplings are to
be removed and stored in the place provided on the locomotive and that
correct pantograph operation is to be observed at all times,
44- *46* class Locomotives} Hosing of Drivers* Cabs.
It has come under notice that enginemen and other employees are
cleaning the Driver's cab of '46' class electric locomotives by
hosing with water. This practice is extremely dangerous and must
cease at once*
It is pointed out that directly beneath the driver's and observer's
seats both No* 1 and 2 ends, under the floor, there are 1200 amps in
the motor lead boxes and should water penetrate these lead boxes, an
electric explosion could result with subsequent serious damage to the
locomotive and injury to the employee using the hose.
45- '46' class Locomotives; Sanding Facilities in Sydney Yard.
The stabling of '46' class locomotives in Sydney Yard prior to the
next Down run, requires that the sand boxes on these locomotives be
filled to capacity at the previous starting point.
To assist in this matter and reduce emergency sanding to a minimum,
all employees concerned are directed to ensure that locomotives
departing from Lithgow, Valley Heights or G-osford in the Up direction
have all sand boxes filled to capacity without exception.
An emergency sanding bin is provided in Sydney Yard and is located
between No* 4 and 5 platform at the Redfem end. Whilst these
facilities may be availed of for the sanding of *46' class locomotives
it is not at all times possible to position the locomotive, and
furthermore, the time factor does not always permit.


46- '46* class Locomotives; Sealing of Tool Equipment Boxes.
It has been brought under notice that it is the practice of some
drivers to break the seal to check the contents of the tool box on
*46* class locomotives.
This is not in accordance with the requirements of preparation laid
down which states:- "Check that the seal is on the spare equipment
box." It is the responsibility of the fitter on inspection to check
the tools and seal the tool locker.
Drivers are not permitted to break the seal fitted to the tool box,
except in the case of an emergency to obtain tool equipment. When
this action is taken an appropriate entry is to be made in the log
book,
47- Diesel Electric, Diesel Hydraulic and Electric Locomotives:
Adjustment of Hand Brakes when working light over heavy gradients.
Where it is necessary for Diesel Electric, Diesel Hydraulic or
Electric Locomotives to work light over heavy gradients of 1 in 40 or
steeper, the hand brake should be so adjusted as to require a minimum
period of time to effect its application in case of emergency.
To permit of this being carried out prior to negotiating such
gradients, the following procedure should be adopted,
1, The locomotive is to be stopped on the commencement of the heavy
grade by using the air brake,
2, The hand brake is to be applied firmly while the locomotive is
stationary.
3, Release the air brake and ensure that the hand brake holds the
locomotive stationary without excessive force being applied,
4, Release the hand brake 'to a point where the engine moves freely under
the effect of the gradient concerned and with the hand brake equipment
set under these conditions, use the air, dynamic or regenerative brake
to traverse the grade concerned.
Should it be found that the hand brake will not hold the locomotive,
when stationary, the locomotive must not traverse the grade in
question as a light engine but can do so attached to a train.
Immediate attention is to be given to the hand brake equipment on
arrival at the first depot,
48-6 Diesel Electric, Diesel Hydraulic and Electric Locomotives,
Failure of Westinghouse Air Brake Equipment.
(A) Compressor Failures.
When a compressor fails on a Diesel Electric, Diesel Hydraulic or
Electric Locomotive, the following procedure is to be adopted.


Diesel Electric and Diesel Hydraulic Locomotives; Single Unit
Operation,
(1) Should a compressor fail during train working or when a loco-
motive is running light, the train and/or locomotive is to be
immediately brought to a stand and secured in accordance with the
regulations,
(2) A relief engine must be obtained to work the train or to assist
the locomotive.
(3) The relief engine is to be attached to the train or locomotive
and the Westinghouse air brake hoses coupled, the brakes are to be
operative throughout the train and/or on the locomotive, before the
train or locomotive is moved.

compressor fail, providing regulation main reservoir air pressure can
be maintained, the train or locomotive can be worked under normal
conditions,
(2) Should both compressors fail, the train or locomotive is to be
immediately brought to a stand and secured in accordance with the
regulations; items 2 and 3 as outlined above must then be complied
with.
NOTEj When a steam locomotive is used to render assistance, the
dead engine device is to be placed in the open position on the Diesel
Electric, Diesel Hydraulic or Electric Locomotive.
(B) Distributing Valve Failures or Locomotive Brakes Inoperative.
When a distributing valve fails on a locomotive, or the locomotive
brakes become inoperative through any cause, the following
instructions are to apply
Single Unit Operation.
(1) When a distributing valve fails or the locomotive brakes become
inoperative on a Diesel Electric, Diesel Hydraulic or Electric
Locomotive, either when hauling a train or running light, the train
or locomotive is to be immediately brought to a stand and secured in
accordance with the regulations,
(2) A relief engine must be obtained to work the train or to assist
the locomotive,
(3) The relief engine is to be attached to the train or locomotive,
and the Westinghouse air brake hoses are to be coupled. Also when
hauling a train the brakes must be operative throughout the train.


(4) When the defective locomotive is attached to a train, the
relief engine is to work the train forward under normal operating
conditions, and the defective locomotive detached at the first depot,
where repairs can be effected.
(5) When this defect occurs on a light engine, the defective
locomotive is only to be hauled clear of the section, where it is to
be detached.
Multiple Unit Operation.
When a distributing valve fails or the locomotive brakes become in-
operative in multiple unit working, the following conditions will
apply
(1) When a failure takes place on the leading unit, items 1,2, 3,
and 5, as given for single unit operation will apply, (i.e., no
effective brakes in front of the disabled unit.)
(2) The defective unit is to be detached at the first available
point, after the section is cleared.
(3) When a failure takes place on the trailing unit, attached to a
train, the defective locomotive is to be taken forward under normal
train working, and detached at the first available depot where a
relief engine is available to replace it. (i.e., brakes are effective
on the engine in front and on the vehicles at the rear of the disabled
unit,)
(4) When running light and a failure takes place on the trailing unit
the defective locomotive is to be detached at the first available
point, after the section is cleared.
(C) Train Brakes Inoperative.
When any defect develops on a locomotive, either in single or
multiple working, that effects the through continuity of the air, and
renders the train brakes inoperative, the following procedure is to
apply:-
(1) When the defect occurs in single unit operation or on the
leading unit when working in multiple, resulting in the failure of
the brakes on the locomotive and train, the through air continuity
being interfered with, the train must be immediately brought to a
stand and secured in accordance with the regulation,

(4) The leading unit is then to he used to clear the section and
work the train forward, providing the load permits, until a relief
engine can be obtained,
49-6 Electric Heating on Carriages by High Tension Current supplied from
Diesel Electric Locomotives.
(A) Description of the Electrical Heating System,
A limited number of carriages are now equipped for the application cf
electric heating by means of high tension current supplied from diesel
electric locomotives.
This current is produced at the traction generator and is fed via
train lines, including jumper couplers, to electric heating elements
located in all passenger compartments.
Thermostatic control is provided in order to automatically regulate
compartment temperatures and a by-pass switch is incorporated.
Part of the current produced by the traction generator is routed via
a special overload relay and high tension contactors, the special
overload relay protects the high tension heating circuit throughout
the train.
Train line branch feeds to each car have separate high tension fuse
protection and these are located appropriately in a sealed box below
the car body* If any of these fuses blow in service, they are not to
be renewed or interfered with by the running staff.
A control circuit is fed off battery supply from the locomotive
through a heating circuit breaker (magnetic type) located on the
control panel. This control current is routed via a reset switch
and the operating coils of the high tension contactors, train line
wires and jumper couplers.
The indicating (red) lamp is also included in the control circuit and
located appropriately on the control panel of the locomotive. This
lamp is in parallel with the control current which passes through the
operating coils of the high tension contactors and, therefore, while
the lamp shines there is the indication that the control circuit is
complete and that the high tension current may be feeding through the
heater circuit. Such high tension current will only be fed when the
diesel engine throttle is between notches Nos. 1 to 8.
If a fault develops in the high tension heating circuit, the
overload relay will intervene automatically and open the circuit. In
order to restore the high tension circuit, the resetting switch must
be operated. It is possible that where a fault does develop in the
high tension circuit, the ground relay device may operate before the
overload relay.


LOCOMOTIVE
TRAIN HEATING CIRCUIT.


Jumper Coupler and Connectionsi
Jumper couplers encase five (5) train line wires* The three (3)
uppermost and heavier type pins are directly associated with the
high tension circuit; the two (2) lower pins refer to the control
circuit«
The jumper coupler head is of the conventional type with a peg at
the bottom which must enter the appropriate guide in the jumper
receptacle and the jumper receptacle door has a spur which must
latch the recess on the upper side of the jumper coupler head.
There is built in at the base of the jumper receptacle, a latch,
the action of which is to restrict the withdrawal to two (2)
movements; the first movement being completed by the disengagement
of the control circuit jumper pins.
The jumper coupler head and receptacle are so designed that in
withdrawing the jumper head from the receptacle, the two (2) lower
control circuit pins disengage the control circuit before the high
tension pins are disengaged* This action automatically de-energises
the operating coils of the high tension contactors and opens the high
tension circuit. In further progression cf withdrawal, the high
tension pins are then disengaged.
Connecting or Disconnecting High Tension Jumper Couplers when
Coupling or uncoupling Locomotives or Train Composition;
The fireman/observer, in the case of locomotive connections, and
specially authorised Traffic Branch employees, in the matter of
carriage connections, must act only in positive pre-arrangement with
the locomotive driver, and the driver, before giving permission to
proceed with the handling of jumper coupling equipment, must first
switch ’off* the heater circuit breaker and place the locomotive
reverser handle in the ’off* position and remove same.
When jumper coupler adjustments have been completed, the employee so
detailed will directly inform the driver accordingly who may then
proceed to put the switch ’up’ on the heater circuit breaker on the
control panel and position the locomotive reverser as required.
(B) Pre-Heating the Carriages on the Train.
When the locomotive is coupled to the train prior to the commencement
of a journey, the carriages are to be pre-heated, for passenger
comfort, in the following manner:-
(1) When the driver is informed that the jumper coupling is
properly inserted and the train is ready for heating, turn on the
heater circuit breaker and observe that the red light is on.
(2) Place the reverser handle in the centre position and remove it,
the generator field circuit breaker must be switched on and the


throttle handle advanced to the fourth throttle notch. This will
provide for sufficient out—put from the traction generator to
operate the heating elements,
(3) It is possible that after a sufficient period of time has
elapsed, the red light will go out, indicating that the compartment
temperatures have risen to a predetermined point and the thermostat
has operated, opening the circuit.
(4) When the train is ready to depart, move the throttle handle to
the idle position, insert the reverser handle and position it for the
direction of travel,
(C) Defects in the Electric Heating System,
When the heater circuit breaker is turned on, the Mgh tension
contactors will close, providing the control circuit and high
tension circuit is complete throughout the train and that all
thermostats for the electrical heating elements are closed. This
being indicated by the presence of the red light.
Should the Red Light fail to come on. it indicates the presence of
one or more of the following
(1) The heater circuit breaker is not turned on or is tripped,
(2) All jumper couplings are not correctly inserted and secured or
all jumper receptacle lids not in use are not secured down
correctly, preventing the completion of the control circuit.
(3) The overload relay protecting the high tension circuit has
tripped,
(4) A temperature control thermostat is open on the train.
(5) The red light is defective.
A Remedy may be effected as followsl-
- the red light fails to ,shine, when first coupled to the train:
(1) Check that the heater circuit breaker is turned on,
(2) Reset the overload relay by operating the button provided.
(3) Should this fail, open the heater circuit breaker, centre the
reverser handle and remove it, take out the jumper coupling at
the rear of the locomotive, secure the jumper receptacle lid
down tight, turn on the heater circuit breaker and if the red
light comes on, the defect is on the train and not on the
' locomotive.


(4) Should the defect be on the train, arrangements are to be made to
obtain the services of a Train Equipment Officer to remedy the
defect.
During Train Working, should the red light go outi
(1) Check that the heater circuit breaker is not tripped.
(2) Reset the overload relay. If the red light re-appears it
indicates that the overload relay had been tripped* However,
if the light does not come on it may be due to a thermostat
being open and the light may re-appear after a period of
approximately twenty minutes.
(3) Should the overload trip repeatedly, it is only to be reset
twice, after the third overload, the heater circuit breaker is
to be turned off,
(4) It is possible that when a fault does develop in the high
tension circuit, the ground relay will operate. Should this
occur, reset the ground relay in the normal manner but should
another ground relay occur immediately after resetting, the
heating circuit breaker is to be turned off as the ground relays
may be due to a fault on the high tension circuit.
50-6 Vigilance Control Equipment.
The purpose of vigilance control equipment is to enable the crew of a
locomotive, when running light or attached to a train, to prove their
vigilance by means of a physical action, referred to as an acknowledg-
ment, at short time intervals.
An audible warning is given when the time interval has elapsed,
signalling that an acknowledgment is required. Should an acknowledg-
ment not be received after a further short interval of time, a brake
application at or below the service rate is initiated. To ensure that
the locomotive or train is brought under full control, the brake
application, thus commenced, cannot be released until the brake pipe
pressure has been reduced to a very low value, thus necessitating an
actual brake valve manipulation before a release can be made.
The different types of Vigilance Control Equipment fitted to Diesel
Electric and Electric Locomotives are
1, The R.B. system which is air operated and acknowledgment is
obtained by means of a foot switch,
2, The A.A, type which is also air operated and acknowledgment is
obtained by means of a hand push button,
3, The E.B. type on which acknowledgment is also obtained by means
of a hand push button.


The 8.8. and A.A. type of equipment requires that certain upper and
lower limits of pressure be maintained in a timing reservoir and
beyond which an audible warning is followed by a penalty brake
application.
The E.B. type of equipment is electrically operated to a time limit
and beyond which a warning signal is given followed by a penalty
brake application.
Operation of the R.B. and A.A. Equipment,
Charging the System.
1, Before starting the compressor, the independent brake valve at
the operating end is to be placed in the application position and
the Drivers' brake valve isolating cock opened (all other Drivers'
brake valve isolating cocks to be closed),
2. The main reservoir emergency application valve and brake
cylinder isolating cocks, (where provided), are to be open and
sealed and the vigilance control switches are to be turned on.
3* With the A.A. system the magnet valve should be energised by
depressing and releasing one of the acknowledgment buttons, it
will remain energised by the operation of the stick-in relay.
With no air pressure in the equipment, the cut-off valves and
pneumatic control switch will be in the open position. After
the compressor is started air will flow via the cut-off valves
to the audible warning whistle, causing this to operate and with
ke A.A, system, the magnet valve being energised, the timing
reservoir will also be charged,
5. When the brake cylinder pressure rises to 25 p.s.i., the cut-off
mves will close, thus preventing any further flow of air from
the main reservoir to the audible warning whistle and timing
reservoir,
6. The brake cylinder pressure will charge the timing reservoir to
the setting of the pressure reducing valve on the independent
.5* T Ve p#s*i*) and will remain at this pressure while
the independent brake is applied.
7 * JJnder these conditions the suppression valve is closed cutting
off the audible warning and penalty brake application valves from
e main reservoir air supply, and the locomotive air system will
be charged in the usual manner, allowing the pneumatic control
switch to close to complete its portion of the traction circuit.


Operation in running R.B. system.
1, When it is desired to move the locomotive upon releasing the
brakes, depress the acknowledgment button, the cut-off valves
being open, the timing reservoir will be charged, as indicated
on the gauge provided.
2, When the pressure has increased to 70 p.s.i* the supply valve
will open admitting air from the main reservoir to the audible
warning device. On receipt of this signal, the operator should
release the acknowledgment button, this action de-energises the
magnet valve, cutting off the air supply to the timing reservoir
and connecting it to an exhaust choke through the magnet valve.
3* When the timing reservoir pressure has reduced to 25 p.s.i.,
this occurring in the time interval established by the choke,
the cut-off valve opens and allows air from the main reservoir
to flow again to the audible warning device. The acknowledgment
button is then depressed re-energising the magnet valve and
commencing the charging cycle.
Failure to acknowledge R.B. system.
Should for any reason the operator fail to acknowledge the warning
signal and the magnet valve is energised, pressure in the timing
reservoir will continue to rise until it reaches 75-80 p.s,i.
The time interval at li.hich this occurs after the audible warning has
been received is determined by the pressure increment rate, which is
controlled by chokes. At 75 _ 80 p.s.i. the snap action penalty valve
opens allowing air from the upper portion of emergency application
valve to exhaust to the atmosphere, the brake pipe pressure lifts the
piston valve, opening an exhaust port, allowing brake pipe pressure
to escape to the atmosphere at a rate controlled by an exhaust choke.
At the same time the pneumatic control switch causes the traction
circuit to be interrupted thus, unloading the traction motors, and/or
returning the engine to idle speed depending on the class of locomotive
involved. With the automatic brake valve in the running position,
brake pipe pressure must be reduced against the slide valve feed
valve air supply and a considerable exhaust of air is required to
reduce the brake pipe pressure at an equivalent rate to a service
reduction, the time involved varying with the length of train.
As the brake cylinder pressure rises to 25 p.s.i, the cut-off valve
closes preventing ary further air supply to the timing reservoir and
audible warning. Pressure, however, is retained in the locking
volume by a check valve and the penalty valve remains open maintaining
the brake application.
Should the magnet valve be de-energised and the audible warning is
not acknowledged, timing reservoir pressure continues to fall until
the cut-off valve opens at 17 p.s»i., the attainment of this pressure
being under the control of an exhaust choke which determines the time
interval from the audible warning.


Mr from the main reservoir is now supplied via a check valve to the
snap action penalty valve which opens and produces a brake application
as outlined above. Brake cylinder pressure also charges the timing
volume reservoir via a check valve.
Operation in running A.A. system.
1, When it is desired to move the locomotive, the brake cylinder
pressure is exhausted causing the cut-off valve to open allowing
main reservoir air to flow to the timing reservoir via the
magnet valve and check valve, thus charging the timing reservoir.
As the timing reservoir pressure reaches the pressure switch
setting, its contacts will open and break the stick-in relay
circuit. This circuit allows the timing reservoir pressure to
flow to the atmosphere via a choke and magnet valve,
2, The continued exhaust of timing reservoir air will reduce the
pressure to 25 p.a.i, at which time the cut-off valve will open
and supply main reservoir air to the audible warning. The
acknowledgment button should again be depressed causing the
stick-in circuit to be re-made and the timing reservoir
pressure to again be increased to the pressure switch setting.
Attempted permanent depression of the acknowledgment button.
Should an operator attempt to defeat the operation of the equipment
by permanently depressing an acknowledgemnt switch, the timing
reservoir will rapidly charge to the setting of the pressure switch
as previously explained. However, the magnet valve will remain
energised causing the timing reservoir pressure to continue to
increase. As the pressure reaches 70 p.s.i, approximately, the
supply valve will open causing main reservoir air to flow to the
audible warning.
If the operator fails to remove the permanent supression at this
stage, the timing reservoir pressure will continue to increase until
the snap action penalty valve pilots a penalty brake application.
Failure to acknowledge (timing reservoir pressure dropping).
Should the operator fail to acknowledge the warning signal, the
timing reservoir pressure will continue to fall until the cut-off
valve opens at 17 p,s,i, the time interval from the occurrence of
the audible warning to the attainment of this pressure being
determined by an exhaust choke. Air at main reservoir pressure
is now supplied via a check valve to the snap action penalty valve,
which will open, allowing air from the upper portion of emergency
application valve to exhaust to the atmosphere, causing the piston
valve to open and exhaust the brake pipe pressure to the atmosphere
at a rate controlled by an exhaust choke. At the same time the
pneumatic control switch causes the traction circuit to be interrupted
thus, unloading the traction motors and/or returning engine to idle
speed depending on the class of locomotive involved.


With the automatic brake valve in the 'Running' position, the brake
pipe pressure must be reduced against the slide valve feed valve
supply and a considerable exhaust of air is required to reduce this
pressure at a rate equivalent to a service reduction, the time
involved varying with the length of the train .
As brake cylinder pressure rises to 25 p.s.i. the cut-off valve
closes preventing any further supply of air to the timing reservoir
and audible warning. Pressure, however, is retained in the locking
volume by check valves and the penalty valve remains open maintaining
the brake application.
Releasing a penalty brake application.
Due to the action of the slide valve feed valve in supplying the
brake pipe against the exhaust of the emergency application valve,
the brake pipe pressure will stabilise at a figure determined by a
choke below the noimal brake pipe pressure during a penalty
application. This reduction is usually about 15 p.s.i.
In order to release the penalty application, air pressure from the
locking volume and penalty valve must be exhausted to the
atmosphere and this is effected at the cut-off valve after the brake
pipe pressure has been reduced below 25 p.s.i. In order to effect
this reduction, the automatic brake valve must be moved to 'lap'
position, thus cutting off the feed valve air supply to the brake
pipe. This, however, should not be carried out until the brake pipe
pressure has stabilised. When the brake pipe pressure falls to
25 p.s.i, the locking volume pressure exhausts via a cut-off valve
allowing the penalty valve and therefore emergency application valve
to close.
The automatic brake valve should be maintained in 'lap' for a few
seconds to allow brake pipe pressure to equalise throughout the
train and the application then released in the ordinary manner.
Prior to effecting the release, however, it should be ensured, by
making an acknowledgment where necessary, that the pressure in the
timing reservoir is within the 'warning to warning' (green) range
and not in the penalty (red) range on the gauges as a re-application
of the brakes will occur if this is not the case.
Time Intervals.
R.B. system.
Audible warning to audible warning 25 - 70 p,s,i, and from 70 - 25 psi
approximately 1 minute 40 seconds.
Audible warning to penalty application approximately 30 seconds.


A.A. system.
Audible warning to audible warning, 25 - 62 p.s.i, and back to
25 p.3,i, approximately 1 minute 30 seconds.
Low pressure audible warning to penalty application 25 - 17 p.s.i,
approximately 30 seconds.
High pressure audible warning to penalty application 70-80 p.s.i,
approximately 5 seconds,
E.B. system.
Operation of warning light approximately 70 seconds.
Warning light to audible warning approximately 20 seconds.
Audible warning to penalty application approximately 20 seconds.
Multiple Unit operation.
When operating in multiple, the vigilance control equipment is
isolated on the trailing unit, when the drivers brake valve
isolating cock or cocks are closed or in the trail position on a
40 class locomotive,
NOTE;
The vigilance control equipment is also rendered inoperative when
standing, providing the brake cylinder pressure exceeds 25 Ibs.psi.
Loss of brake pipe pressure.
1. If it is suspected that brake pipe pressure is being lost or the
train is taking excessive time to charge, place the automatic
brake valve handle in 'lap* watching the brake pipe gauge and
note if the pressure falls to zero,
2. Should the pressure fall to zero, return the brake valve handle
to 'running* position and note if the brake pipe pressure is
restored, if not, determine the location of the leak, examining
the locomotive before proceeding along the train,
3. With a trailing locomotive, if the loss of air is located at
the vigilance control emergency application valve, the equipment
should be completely isolated by closing the vigilance control
main reservoir and brake cylinder isolating cocks and in
addition the isolating cock located at the emergency application
valve exhaust.


4# In the case of a leading locomotive close the isolating cock on the
exhaust side of the emergency application valve and check as to
whether the brake pipe pressure is restored and if the control
governor has closed by attempting to apply power. If power is avail-
able the vigilance control should be operated in the normal way. If
power cannot be obtained, completely isolate the vigilance control
equipment.
5, The train should then be charged in the normal manner and the reason
for cutting out the equipment noted in the ’Log Book’.
Location of Emergency Application Valves,
Engine Class Location
40 Below the floor under the fireman's seat.
44 In the nose compartment at floor level, to left
of and beside the door,
45 Beside the toilet,
46 Near the passageway in the machine compartment
with the vigilance control equipment
48 4801 - 4820 just inside and to the right of the
door to the nose compartment in the old staff
exchanger box, 4821 - 4845 in the nose compartment
on the side of the battery box,
49 Under the floor in the centre of the cab.
Location of Vigilance Control Switches.
The vigilance control switches are located on the various classes of
locomotives in the following places
44 class locomotives On the control stand.
45 class locomotives On the control stand and control panel.
46 class locomotives On the fireman's side of the desk.
48 class locomotives On the control stand.
49 class locomotives A knife switch in the electrical cabinet
(except 4907, 4908)
In addition to the vigilance control switch, all control circuit breakers
must be closed to complete the circuit to the magnet valve.


Operation of the E.B, Type Equipment.
The E.B. type of vigilance control equipment consists of a series
of normally open switch contacts which are closed at appropriate times
by an electro-hydraulic timing mechanism.
Hand operated acknowledgment buttons are conveniently located
near the drivers and fireman’s station and when operated, causes the
electro hydraulic mechanism to commence its operating cycle After a
txme period of 70 seconds, a pair of contacts come together! this
allows a warning light to flash and it will continue to flash until
one of the acknowledgment buttons is operated.
Failure to acknowledge this signal within a period of twenty
seconds will result in another pair of contacts closing causing a
b ® l L ° commence ringing, this warning will also continue for a period
ox 2U seconds unless an acknowledgment is made.
In the absence of an acknowledgment, after a further period of
approximately 20 seconds, a third pair of contacts will close, causing
a penalty brake application to occur. When this takes place the bell
is silenced and at the same time the acknowledgment buttons are rendered
inoperative for one minute.
The penalty brake application can be released after the one minute
time interval by depressing the acknowledgment button and operating the
brake valve in the normal manner.
Charging the Air System.
1. Before starting the compressor, the independent brake valve at
the operating end is to be placed in the application position and the
driver s brake valve isolating cock opened (lead position on a ’4o'
class locomotive). All other drivers brake valve isolating cocks to be
closed*
2, Check that the main circuit breaker is "ON" and sealed, the vigilance
control box is closed and sealed, also the emergency application valve
isolating cock is in the open position and sealed.
3* the Air Compressor has been started depress and release one
of the acknowledgment buttons to start the equipment on its operating
cyci© *
4. When the brake cylinder pressure rises to 30 p.s.i., a cut-off
valve will operate to break the electrical circuit, thus isolating
the vigilance control equipment.
5. Under these conditions the locomotive air system will be charged
in the normal manner allowing the pneumatic control switch to close
to complete its portion of the traction circuit.


Operation in Runnings
1, When it is desired to move the locomotive, upon releasing
brakes, it is necessary to depress the acknowledgment button within
a period of approximately seventy seconds,
2, An appropriate warning light is located and will shine at
approximately seventy second time intervals, followed by the
introduction of an audible warning after a further period of twenty
seconds, thus attracting the operator's attention to the necessity
for an acknowledgment,
3, The acknowledgment button should again be pressed within a
period of ninety seconds, to recommence a further cycle of the
equipment, failing this, a penalty brake application will take
place, this being governed by a twenty second time factor,
4, Should the operator attempt to defeat the operation of the
equipment by permanently depressing the acknowledgment button
circuit will be automatically broken by the engaging of an electrical
relay, and the brakes will be applied after a time cycle of one
hundred and ten seconds.
Failure to Acknowledge.
Should the operator fail to acknowledge the audible warning, within
a period of twenty seconds a penalty brake application will occur.
Due to the action of the slide valve feed valve in supplying the
brake pipe against the exhaust of the emergency application valve,
the brake pipe pressure will stabilise at a figure below the normal
brake pipe pressure, before the train comes to a stand.
After allowing the train to come to a stand and the pressure to
stabilise, place the automatic brake valve handle in the lap position
and wait for one minute, the brakes can then be released by pressing
the acknowledgment button and manipulating the brake valve handle in
the usual manner,
NOTE: Due to the operation of an electrical relay, it is necessary
to wait for one minute, before the acknowledgment becomes
operative after a penalty brake application.
Loss of Brake Pipe Pressure,
1, If it is suspected that brake pipe pressure is being lost or the
train is taking excessive time to charge, place the automatic brake
valve in the lap position. Watch the brake pipe gauge and note if
the pressure falls.
2, Should the pressure fall, return the brake valve handle
to the Running position and note if the brake pipe pressure is
restored, if not, determine the location of the leak, examxning the
locomotive before proceeding along the train.


3. With a leading or trailing locomotive, if the loss of air is
located at the vigilance control emergency application valve, the
emergency isolating cock, which is located on the bottom left hand
comer of the vigilance control unit, is to be closed. This will
stop the exhaust of air but will not prevent the operation of the
warning light and bell.
Tiie train should then be charged in the normal manner and the
reason 1 or closing the emergency isolating cock entered in the log-book,
4. If the defect is such that the audible warning acts abnormal
the mam circuit breaker located in the electrical cabinet should
be unsealed and switched off. The reason being noted in the log-book.
Multiple Unit Operation.
When operating in Multiple, the vigilance control equipment is
isolated on the trailing unit providing the driver brake valve
isolating cock or cocks are in the closed position or in the trail
position on a '4o' class loco-motive,
NOTE; The equipment is rendered inoperative during standing periods
providing the brake cylinder pressure exceeds 30 p.s.i.
'4o* Class Locomotives.
Operating positions of three position isolating cock in regards to
vigilance control equipment.
The *4o' class locomotive is fitted with a three position isolating cock
which allows for the vigilance control equipment to be operative whenever
the isolating cock is in either the lead or dead position. The equipment

Multiple Unit Operation.
When operating with another '4o' class unit, the three position isolating
cock being in the trail position on the rear ’unit, the vigilance control
equipment is isolated on this unit. Should it be necessary to operate
a 40 class locomotive coupled to another type and the 40 class is the
railing unit, the three position isolating cock being located in the
Dead position, the vigilance control equipment being operative must be
acknowledged in the normal manner*
A 40 class unit being hauled Dead also has the three position isolating
cock in the Dead position, allowing main reservoir air to be supplied
to this equipment and if this is not isolated it can cause a penalty
brake application to occur.

1- Introduction.
The following instructions are for the guidance of running shed
employees. Listed under the various headings are the duties that em-
ployees will he called upon to perform in and around a locomotive depot.
These instructions are included in this book, so that. Drivers, Firemen
and Trainee Enginemen can make themselves thoroughly conversant with
the rules applicable to the duties that they will be required to perform,
on any particular class of work, in the operation of a locomotive depot.
2- Instructions for the guidance of shed staff.
Section 1 - SHED STAFF.
Accident Cranes.
1 , The employee in charge of Accident Crane, Breakdown Van or Mobile
1-3 responsible for the condition of the complete equipment,
to meet emergencies that arise. Before an accident crane is
given transit, the employee in charge of it must see that the
jib is properly lowered to clear the load gauge, that the crane
is properly secured to the under carriage to prevent any pivot
movement, and that axleboxes are adequately oiled. Cranes eq-
uipped with an adjustable counter balance box, shall have this
weight moved in to its limit and secured, when cranes are in
transit. Cranes which form part of a train, when practicable
shall have the jib trailing towards the rear of the train. The
maximum speed for accident cranes is laid down in the General
Appendix, Part 1, and in the working timetable . Accident cranes
when in transit must be accompanied by a qualified accident
crane driver. Before commencing and during lifting operations,
the Officer-in-Charge must take every precaution to prevent tha
crane from capsizing by fastening clips to rails, chocking wheels,
firmly placing outriggers and observing instructions in regard
to jib radius in accordance with the load diagram. He must
satisfy himself that the movements of the jib will not contact
overhead wires or structures, and that the operations are protected
in accordance with the Buies and Regulations for the safe working
of the lines. Crane Drivers are responsible for keeping the crane
clean and maintaining steam pressure on the boiler for the work
When in transit, coal must not be carried on the crane
platform. Before leaving duty, the Crane Driver must fill the
boiler to the top of the water gauge glass and shall arrange for
the ashpan to be cleaned of ashes, the coal bunker replenished
and the tanks filled with water, ready for any emergency.

Except where instructions are issued to the contrary to meet
Seal conditions, boilers shall be bio™ down ‘ h ™ugh the
blow-down cocks before commencing, and immediately after
finishing each trip, or whenever warranted by conditions of
in order to reduce the silt and salt concentrations.
Boilers of engines that are due for washing out shall not
be blown down imediately before or after washout attention.
Peed water should not be injected into a boiler just prior
to blowing down, unless the water showing in the water gauge
Is belOT^alf-gias s level. With the water at not less than
glass, open the blc-dom cock until the water level 1.

The duty of blowing down boilers shall be carried out by
the engine crew or shed staff, as prescribed by arrange-
ments, and an entry to that effect made in the shed book.
i The blowing down of boilers in Running Sheds is only permitted
4 * in excoptional cases, where circumstances prevent the engines
from being dealt with outside the Shed.
CLEANING-
-5 Head Cleaners or Chargemen will be held responsible for keeping
% engines properly cleaned, and must examine each engine after
bee/cleLed, to see that the employee so engaged do


their work properly They must keep a record of all engines cleaned
showing the names of the employees engaged and the time worked on
each. When engines are being cleaned with a steam spray, care must
be taken to prevent water entering axle-boxes. On completion of
s earn spray cleaning, tops of axle-boxes must be examined and water
therein removed with a syringe. Ml cases of neglect to do the
allotted work in a proper manner must be reported to the Officer-
in-Charge who will bring the matter under the notice of the District
Locomotive Engineer.
ENGINE TURNERS.
6. Engine Turners are responsible for moving engines in the Locomotive
iard, and for placing them in proper order in the shed, and to
carry out other specified shed duties as directed by their Super-
vising of ficer. This work must conform with the instructions under
heading of Sundry Duties as contained in these instructions.
ENGINE TRTMMBBR
7. Engine Trimmers will be responsible for maintaining worsted trim-
mings in siphon pipes, and axle-boxes, etc. in good order by ex-
amination, renewal or reconditioning of same at the prescribed
periods or as directed by their Supervising Officer. They must
h a m^ UP ? ° f the various of trimmings on hand ready for
thll U3ad mU3t be the correct tyP e and size to ensure
that sufficient oil will siphon. Plug trimmings must be placed in
the siphon with the worsted at least 1/V below the top of the siphon

ascertain from the Shed Chargeman the numbers of the engines re-
quiring to be lighted up during the time they are on duty. They
must examine the engines that are in steam to note the condition
or nJr+h a f d . I test the holler water levels, to ascertain whether
hi b ° i:L ® rs contain sufficient water, which amount should

boiler water levels should be tested in the following manner, i.e
open the drain cock below the gauge glass for a fewleconds, then
a ? d , not ® thab bhe water returas quickly in the glass to its

the gauge column, this must be held down, prior to and during the
Ixlit T dra±n ° OCk 13 ° pen * observe whether
exist in the firebox or boiler and if anything be found amiss they
must immediately report the matter to the Officer-in-Charge,


Before placing a fire in a locomotive firebox. Fire Lighters must
ascertain by test that there is a sufficient quantity of water in
the boiler, which should be registered at not more than 1/2 gauge
glass and not less than 2 inches in the gauge glass and above the
bottom packing nut of the gauge column. The test should be made
by opening the drain cock below the gauge glass and allowing the
water to discharge. The cock should then be closed and the water
should return to the original level. Observe that no leaks exist
in fusible plugs and tubes in the firebox and that the tube plate
is not barnacled, that the fire grates are in proper order and pos-
ition, also that the blowdown cocks, washout plugs and mud-hole
doors are not leaking. The ash pan must be free from ashes and the
damper opened. The smoke box must be examined for leaks and the
spark arrestor free from blockage. The regulator and all steam
valves must be closed, the cylinder cocks open, the reversing gear
in centre and the hand-brakes applied. They must attend to the
fires lighted from time to time, when the water level in the gauge
glasses must be tested; until the duty is handed over to another
responsible person.
Where practicable, fires must be lit in sufficient time to have
60 lb, steam pressure in boilers one hour previous to the time the
engine is required for traffic. In cases where fires are banked,
care must be exercised to ensure that only sufficient coal is added
to provide for enough fire to cover the grate up to the time that
the engine is required to be prepared. Banking of fires is to be
carried out as far as practicable with engines which are required
to be in steam within 12 hours.
Lighting up and care of oil-fired boilers must be in accordance
with Departmental instructions. Oil-burning fires must not be left
unattended for longer than 15 minutes.
9. To guard against the possibility of placing a fire into an engine
that has no water in the boiler, red boards with the words "?oiler
Empty" on one side and "Boiler Under Repairs" on the other are to
be placed in front of the firehole door of empty boilers and of
boilers that have been stopped for repairs. These boards are to be
placed in the position indicated immediately a commencement is made
to empty the boiler or it is stopped for repairs, and it must not
be again removed until the boiler is re-filled with water and repairs
effected.
10. Employees must avoid disfigurement of the boiler mountings, &c,,
also of the interior of cabs through the emission of flame and smoke
from the firehole door of engines newly lighted up. Fire Lighters
and others must manipulate the dampers, where so fitted, and firehole
doors to avoid both being open at once; they must also see that the
smokebox door is properly closed after the boiler is warmed up
sufficiently to avoid sweating.


PUELMN.
11, Employees are responsible for the proper coaling of engines, that
the coal placed on the tenders is of good quality and properly
broken up, and that a record of the quantity and class of coal
supplied to each engine is kept. Coal placed on tenders must be
properly trimmed to prevent it falling off in transit. On mechani-
cally fired engines fuelmen must ensure that before coaling the
tender, the conveyor trough slides are in the closed position.
Fuelmen knocking down fires, etc., must see that the engine fire
bars or fire grates are replaced in proper position and if the fire
bars or fire grates be burnt or damaged, they must immediately report
the matter to the Chargeman. When engaged in raking out engine
ash-pans, they must wet the ashes before drawing, to prevent the
dust that would arise from raking the dry ashes, getting on the
working parts of the engine. When using the ash pit hose for this
purpose extreme care is to be exercised in order to avoid water
coming in contact with the fire bars or fire grates. They must
thoroughly remove all ashes from the ash-pan, also clear ashes from
the smokebox door joint, and so enable the door to make a proper
joint against the front when closed. They must also close hopper
doors and replace ash-pan cages in their normal running position,
and adhere to the instructions shown under the heading of sundry
duties.
L 2. Special care must be exercised by employees when closing smokebox
doors to see that ashes are not lodged in the ring groove, thereby
preventing the door making a proper joint, the result of which is
that ashes in the smokebox ignite and cause damage to the doors and
smokeboxes,
MECHANICS.
13, The Sub-Foreman or Leading Fitter and Boilermaker will be held
responsible for having all necessary running repairs that are booked
by Drivers, and Examining Mechanics, promptly and properly executed.
They will consult the Repair Book frequently and ascertain from the
Officer-in-Charge the time engines are required to leave the depot,
and immediately the repairs have been effected the Officer-in-Charge
must be informed. In cases where repairs cannot be completed in
time for the engine to depart as rostered, sufficient notice must
be given to the Officer-in-Charge to enable him to provide another
engine in time to prevent delays. The above instruction also applies
to Fitters and Boilermakers who may be on duty at other than regular
working hours.
Repairs booked, but which cannot then be carried out, must have
an entry made opposite them to that effect in the Repair Book, and
subsequently dealt with by the such entry to be
signed by the Mechanic-in-Charge, countersigned by the Officer-in-
Charge of the shed, and arrangements made to have the repairs
effected as soon as practicable.


Maintenance repairs carried out on locomotives in running sheds
must be effected in accordance with authorised drawings, circular
instructions and the directions contained in the Locomotive
Maintenance Instruction Book, -
Llf, When engines are separated from their tenders and standing in the
shed for the purpose of effecting repairs, the engine and tender
must be placed not less than TEN FEET APART, and in addition to
the hand brakes being screwed hard on, at least four wheels of the
engine and four wheels of the tender must be chocked with suitable
wedge blocks, to prevent the engine and tender moving towards each
other in the event of any unexpected hit up. They must also be
protected by two red flags, one on each side, projecting so that
they can be seen by enginemen moving engines. Same applies to all
engines that Mechanics are working on, red lights being used at
night. The employee completing the work will be responsible for
removal of the flags or lights.
With the exception of ’3B', ’s9* and ‘6o’ class engines. Fitters
working on big and little ends of connecting rod, or any part of
motion of an engine under steam must remove the regulator handle
and keep it under observation, so as to ensure engine is not moved.
Under no circumstances when assembling connecting rods, must the
regulator or reversing gear be used to assist to couple up.
Should difficulties be met due to leakage from the regulator,
the pressure in the boiler must be reduced. When it is necessary
to use a bar against pressure, the operator should always stand on
the side from which pressure is being exerted.
NOTE; In the case of '3B* *, ’s9’ and *6o' class engines, the
regulator handle shall be secured by the pin provided, and a NOT
TO BE MOVED" board suspended therefrom.
The Mechanic who is immediately in charge of repairs in such
cases shall be responsible for seeing that these precautions against
accidents are taken.
15. Leading Boilermakers must examine the brick arch, ash-pan cages,
spark arrestor, firebox, water spaces, &c,, of boilers, when engines
are in the Shed on washout days and when stopped for mechanical
repairs. The Repair Book must be frequently consulted to ascertain
if any brick arches or smokebox doors have been booked for attention
or foundation of smokebox for cementing; these must be attended
to promptly.


TUBE CLEANERS AND GLAND PACKERS.
16. Where Tube Cleaners are employed their hours of duty will be
regulated by Roster, Immediately they sign on duty, they must
report to the Supervising Officer, who will allot each man his
work.
17. Employees who are delegated to pack glands, when working under-
neath an engine, must exercise care to protect the engine with Red
flags. Glands must be screwed up square after they have been
packed, gland nuts securely locked and split pins replaced in the
studs. They are responsible for replacing gauge glasses and washers
in the containers on engines and sealing the boxes.
18. Tube Cleaners and other shed hands who deal with fire boxes when
engines are out of steam, must see that the tube plate and tubes
are thoroughly cleaned to prevent barnacling. Tubes should be
cleaned with the tube rod, or by compressed air, and at periods
in accordance with local directions. A record must be made in the
book for the purpose, showing the date and by whom, tubes and tube
plate of each engine were cleaned. On each washout day, or when
boilers are out of steam, the cinders are to be removed from the
top of the brick arch and combustion chamber,
TOOL COLLECTORS
19. Tool Collectors are responsible for the proper equipment of tools
in accordance with the prescribed tool list, being on each engine!
and for the sealing of the tool box with the depot seal. Spanners
in the tool box must be tested for fit of the nuts they are required
to move. Cylinder plugs must be of the correct size for the engine.
The tools, tool boxes and tool store must be kept in a clean and
tidy condition. Each engine is to be equipped with the correct fire
irons and screw couplings in good condition.
WASHOUTMEN.
20. Where Washoutmen are employed, their hours of duty will be regulated
by roster and they will carry out their duties under the control
of the Chargemen or Officer-in-Charge.
Immediately Washoutmen sign on duty, they must report to the
Officer-in-Charge, and will be responsible for the proper washing
out of boilers, and the work incidental thereto as prescribed in
the Rules Covering Washing Out of Locomotive Boilers and Examination
of Water Gauge Columns.
An entry must be made in a book provided for the purpose, im-
mediately each boiler is completed, showing the name of the man
concerned and particulars of the washing out.
In addition to washing out boilers, Washoutmen are required to
grease blow-down cocks of the plug type and water gauge cocks secured


by nut and washer.
Water gauge cocks of the asbestos fibre packed type will be dealt
with by the Mechanical Staff.
21. Employees who attend to the engines by way of packing, tube cleaning,
lighting-up, sanding, washing-out, and otherwise equipping them for
the road, must ascertain the time the engines are due to leave the
Shed, and if unable to complete the allotted work in the time avail-
able, they must notify their immediate superior to that effect.
22. Enginemen, Engine Turners, Crane Drivers, and others, when stabling
an engine or crane, must before leaving see that sufficient water
is in the boiler, that the water tank is full, and tender loaded
with coal unless otherwise directed, the reversing gear placed in
midgear, the throttle valve properly closed, cylinder cocks open,
and the engine and tender hand brakes, where provided, are screwed
hard on. Where hand brakes are not provided, engines are to be
secured by the use of wooden wedges which are to be placed on the
rail and under the wheel. Each man will be responsible for seeing
any leaks that may be in the fire-box or boiler, while the engine
is in his charge, and for immediately reporting any such defects to
the Chargeman.
Every precaution shall be exercised against the admission of
cold air to hot fire-boxes of locomotives when fires are drawn or
banked.
Employees authorised to move engines in steam and those whose
duty it is to deal with fires or rake out ash-pans, shall observe
the following:-
(a) Precautions shall be taken to avoid the admission of cold air
to hot fire-boxes and any other action which would be likely
to chill the plates or tubes.
(b) The least possible use shall be made of the blower during the
time the fire is being dealt with.
(c) Immediately the fire is drawn or banked in any locomotive
fire-box, and before the locomotive is moved from the ashpit,
the blower shall be shut off and the fire-hole door and damper
doors shall be closed and remain closed during any movement
of the locomotive until it is stabled. Damper fire-hole and
fire-box doors shall be kept closed on all occasions after the
fire has been dealt with or when standing in the Depot.
23. Employees authorised to move engines must make themselves acquainted
with the instructions governing each Depot that they work to and
from, they must exercise great care and see that the points are in
proper position, and assure themselves that no other engine is fouling
the road or approaching, and must at all times have the engines under


such control as to stop short of any obstruction. They must
exercise special care to avoid accidents to employees who may be
working under engines, or on them. Before moving an engine in the
Locomotive Yards and Sheds they must assure themselves by personally
looking and calling out that no one is underneath or in any position
where he is liable to be injured by the movement of such engine.
The whistle must also be sounded loudly before starting. If it is
intended to place an engine in contact with, or very close to
another engine, the men employed on the other engine must be in-
formed as to what is to be done, and must see that the brakes are
hard on to prevent its movement. If it is intended to move the
other engines also, the men working -on it must be specially informed,
and whoever is in charge of the movements of the engines must
satisfy himself that all employees are clear of both engines.
Locomotives must not be left on roads which are likely to be
used by other engines in Locomotive Yards after dark without red
lights being placed on them for their protection.
24* Enginemen, Engine Turners, and others, authorised to move engines
must exercise caution when proceeding on to the turntable, and
must assure themselves that the turntable is properly set, and
pawls in place. The engine is to be stopped before going on to
the turntable, and the Fireman must precede and balance the table
down to the rail, and thereby prevent damage when the engine is
coming on to it. Where cams are provided the operating lever or
screw must be placed at the full extent of its travel in order to
maintain the proper rail level, and avoid heavy contact of the engine
wheels on the turntable. The movement from the turntable must be
piloted by the fireman to ensure correct alignment and clearance on
converging roads,
Enginemen must not allow unauthorised persons to assist them in
turning their engines.
Where turntable attendants are provided, those employees are
responsible for the correct setting of the turntable and they will
set the cabin end where the engine will move on to the turntable,
and, where practicable, off the turntable. Engines must be moved
on and off the turntable only when signalled to do so by the turn-
table attendant who must use a green flag by day and a green light
by night for this purpose.
Turntables throughout the lines have been placed in three groups
"A", "B", and "C" as indicated in Regulation 26, page 55 and 54,
of the General Appendix, Part 1,, and to provide the necessary
safeguard against accident through their misuse by unauthorised
persons the following instructions must be strictly enforced:-


GROUP "A” - Locomotive depots where constant supervision is
provided and view of the turntable is not obstructed -
Turntable need not be locked*
GROUP "B" - Stations and Locomotive Depots where constant
supervision is provided, but turntable is not in regular
use and view of same is obstructed - Turntable must be
locked during the time an Officer is not on duty, also at
week-ends (Sundays),
GROUP "C" - Stations where turntables are placed in a position
which precludes observation or constant supervision and are
not in regular use - Turntable must be locked.
Officers controlling turntables which are required to be looked
must satisfy themselves that the turntables have been fitted with
suitable locking device to enable them to be secured by padlock.
The Mechanical Officer in charge must place the keys in a suitable
and safe position for use when required. At stations where there
is not a Mechanical Officer, the Station Master will have charge
of the turntable keys, and arrange for their safe custody and for
them to be available when necessary,
25. Only Drivers, Firemen, and Trainee Enginemen passed as Firemen,
Engine Turners, and others who may be specially authorised by the
Chief Mechanical Engineer, shall move engines, and then only when
it is their duty to do so.
With certain exceptions, as authorised and prescribed by local
General Order, the movement of engines and vehicles over points,
cross-overs and converging roads in Loco, Yards is to be piloted
by a competent employee preceding the engine on the Driver’s side,
and hand-signalling for the movement of the engine or vehicle
during daytime, and by a light at night.
Where Shed Firemen and/or Shed Chargemen are not on duty
continuously the movement of engines by Acting Firemen must be
restricted to other than "36", "38","59" and "60" class engines
and Diesels and then only to those operations which cannot con-
veniently be deferred pending the availability of the Shed Fireman
or Shed Chargeman, In all such cases, the Acting Fireman so
employed must have had previous firing experience on the road and
been certified by a travelling officer as competent to move engines
in Loco, Yards,
The foregoing is not to be interpreted, as prohibiting Acting
Firemen, or other employees authorised by the Chief Mechanical
Engineer, from moving engines in the process of de—ashing, coaling
or other Depot operations, when the movements are unopposed and of
a minor nature.


Any breach of these instructions will be seriously regarded, and
the person at fault may be held liable for any damage or injury that
may result,
26. Sand Attendants must see that the sand is properly screened before
being put into the sand boxes to guard against foreign substances
being introduced that can affect the mechanism of the valves and
blockage of the sand pipes. They must also avoid spillage of sand
on working parts of engines, and clear residue sand from around the
filling hole, before the engine is moved.
Employees filling sand boxes with a bucket must use one fitted
with a screen to avoid the entiy into sand boxes of foreign matter
with would prevent the valves operating or block the outlet.
Before sand boxes are filled, the sand in the boxes must be examined
to ensure that it is dry,
27. Staff employed in depots where therd is overhead wiring for electric
traction, must make themselves familiar with and comply with the
instructions issued at such depots in regard to work on the roofs
of locomotives or vehicles or within four feet of the overhead
wiring, and of the operation of isolating switches for the overhead
wiring,
28. Special instructions are issued covering the manner in which main-
tenance of electric trains, electric locomotives, and diesel electric
locomotives is to be carried out.
The Officers in charge of this work are responsible for seeing
that the maintenance is carried out in accordance with the schedule,
and that all booked repairs are carried out.
The Officer in charge of the depot is responsible for seeing that
all locomotives, leaving the depot for traffic, are in good working
order,
3-7 Instructions for the guidance of Enginemen.
Section 2 - EN&INEMEN.
1. Drivers and Firemen shall attend for duty at the times and places
directed by roster or as otherwise advised by a responsible officer.
When finishing the duty assigned to them they must consult the
roster where such is posted or ascertain from the Roster Clerk or
Chargeman when and where they are required to next report for duty,
2. A roster will be posted at the depot for the information of Drivers
and Firemen showing the number of the engine and the train or trains
they are required to run and any other duty they are required to
perform.
3. Drivers and Firemen when commencing duty shall peruse the running
roster and note any information thereon for their guidance, also


peruse and sign General Orders and obtain Weekly, Speed and Special
Train Notices.
Drivers and Firemen directed to attend for duty but are not booked
for any particular train, must, on reporting for duty ascertain from
the Chargeman the work they are required to perform.
5. Drivers and Hostlers will be held responsible for the engines they
prepare being fully equipped for the prescribed journey and to
carefully examine them during the preparation, also when stabling
after the completion of the journey as well as on the road where
time and opportunities permit,
5, Drivers are responsible for the clean and tidy condition of engine
footplates, which must be kept free from coal.
7. Drivers and other employees authorised to move engines are responsible
for displacing water from the elements and cylinders of superheated
engines immediately prior to any shed movement, before engines leave
the depot, and whilst standing on trains before departure.
The procedure is in accordance with standing instructions which
provide for the engine to be secured with brakes, cylinder cocks
open, and reversing gear in centre position. The regulator is then
to be fully opened for five seconds, then closed for a similar period,
which operation is to be repeated three times. The reversing gear
is then to be moved to forward and back gears to allow the accumulated
water to escape through the drain valves. When proceeding to the
train departure point and when starting away, the cylinder cocks
are to remain open (except where necessary precautions warrant other-
wise) in order to eject condensate from the cylinders.
When the locomotive is standing in a round house, the turntable
is to be set for the road that the locomotive is standing on, before
the water is displaced from the elements and cylinders.
8. Drivers shall have their allotted engines ready to leave the shed
and whistle out of Loco, at such times prior to the starting time
of trains as may be laid down or directed. Heavy fires must not be
made up before engines leave the shed.

to sign on duty between the hours of 12 midnight and 6 a.m, inclusive.
This applies to those men who reside within 2 mile radius of the
Running Shed only; excepting at those places where a special radius
has been fixed. The Officer-in-Charge will make such arrangements


as will ensure the men being called at the proper time,
11. When Drivers or Firemen are required for duty for which they have
not been rostered, or have not had an opportunity of seeing the
roster, and have not been otherwise notified, the information will
be sent of form X9OB, in duplicate, by Call Boy, one copy being
retained by the man notified, and the other being signed by him or
the responsible person deputed by him, and returned to the Shed
Chargeman by the Call Boy.
Drivers and Firemen who have not been rostered and are waiting
advice and are temporarily absent from their homes, must arrange
for some person at their place of residence to accept and sign for
the form X9OB.
Employees resting in Barracks must enter on the Blackboard
provided, their name and number of the room occupied by them. When
temporarily absent from the barracks for any purpose they must in-
dicate on the board their whereabouts, so that the necessary call
notices advising them of any alteration in their work may be delivered
to them without delay.

to any memoranda or requests which may be sent them for fuller
reports. Attention is drawn to the instructions on the back of
casualty form Xl3B,
13. Enginemen should also examine smoke-boxes to see that ashes have
been removed from around steampipes and from back of blast pipe.
Smoke-box doors should be made as tight as possible, and enginemen
when preparing engines for the road should wipe around the ring
of the door with a piece of greasy waste to ensure a good joint.
After tightening, the door should be tested with a flare lamp, and
any bad fitting doors brought under notice in the usual manner.
14. Drivers or Hostlers when preparing engines must bring under notice
of the Chargeman any inattention or neglect on the part of the shed
staff, so that that Officer may see the grounds on which the complaint
is made, and where necessary, make suitable arrangements to have
corrective action taken.
15. A competent.firemen or other authorised person acting under the
direction of the Chargeman or Officer-in-Charge of the Depot will
be held responsible for safeguarding the boilers of engines standing

5-7 Washing out of Locomotive boilers and Examination of Water Cange
Columns.
1 , 0-eneral Conditions.
Immediately after completion of the work at the ashpit (drawing
the fire and removing the ashes, etc.) the firehole door and damper
doors, if fitted, shall be closed.
After the engine is stabled in the shed, see that there is at
least v>nlf a glass of water in the boiler, then blow the steam pressure
to zero through the injector steam valves.
It is the Chargeman's responsibility to see that these conditions
are carried out.
The washing out equipment consists of the usual 1-jr inch hose, to-
gether with nine (9) nozzles or pipe connections, all of them specially
designed for a given purpose.


These are shown in Figure 1, and each is clearly branded with a
distinguishing number, Washout men must become familiar with these
items, and understand the purpose of each one.
Washing out is done with either hot or cold waterj either method
requires elementary precautions to be taken, which will be explained
later, but the following is the recognised procedure for the actual
operations, and must be strictly followed.
2. Procedure.
Wash crown sheet first, using Nozzle No, 1 commencing at front top
plug hole on the side of the firebox, and work back, directing the stream
of water towards the backplate and using the plug holes in their res-
pective order to the back end, so that no scale or mud will be washed
on to the back end of the flues or tubes. After washing both sides,
wash through the holes on the back plates to thoroughly clean the crown
sheet.
In the case of boilers fitted with arch tubes, these tubes shall
be cleaned by means of the arch tube cleaner, after which they are to
be washed through with water, using Nozzle No. 1.
The importance of removing all scale deposits from the inside surface
of arch tubes cannot be too strongly emphasised. The adherence of scale
or mud deposits will cause the tube to become overheated, bulge and
warp. This in turn creates a dangerous condition in which the tube is
liable to pull* out, fracture or burst.
Every care shall be taken to see that they are thoroughly cleaned,
and a locomotive shall not be allowed into service with dirty arch tubes.
, im P°rtance is the correct washing out of syphons fitted
co the D6O class engine,.
w n .hs te l th VT n has been washed ’ the s yp hon shall be thoroughly
washed out and cleaned, using Nozzle No. 4 through the outsideLown
it at’time/r 31116 far , down as into the syphon and lifting
xt at times to move the nozzle past the syphon stays.
No 2 S to S^ d +h lS ° be n mad ® ° f the lon S PiP® connection No. 8 and Nozzle
No. 2 to pass the nozzle through the backplate and into the syphon to
assist in removing the deposits from the plates. The of
SSaaarJ! iUustrated “ 2 and expUina tha^parations
No Was l! . Space between backplate and firebox, using Nozzle
t h ; o Lh h ° leS in thS back P late > and side sheet spaces
ough side holes opposite crown plate, and holes in casing plate mid-
way e ween foundation bar and crown sheet. Be sure all mud Ld scale”
e removed from above and below firehole, and from water spaces between


firebox and side casing plates.
Next wash tubes and flues from holes in boiler shell, near f i reb °*
tubeplate, and through holes near top of barrel at the front end. The
jet of water should be sprayed over the tubes and flues to remove all
deposits between them.
WASHING OUT Of SYPHONS
Next wash the barrel, commencing at holes in front tube plate,
using Nozzle No. 3. A No. 7 pipe connection coupled to this nozzle
should be used to pass under the table plate of self-cleaning type
smokeboxes. When working in this position on D6O class engines, which
have a longer smokebox, the pipe connection No. 9 should be used in
lieu of No, 7.
Next wash up through the mud door opening on the bottom of the barrel.
Long pipe connection No. 8 and elbow No. 5 combined with Nozzle No. 1
should be used for all classes and a stream of water directed up through
the tubes to break up any make-up amongst the tubes adjacent to the
tubeplate. The Nozzle No. 2 should then replace No. 1 and the bent
nozzle used to wash the deposits out on the bottom of the barrel.
Thoroughly clean the back end of the barrel and water spaces in the
throat plate, also make sure all deposits are removed from arch tubes
and syphon necks.


Next wash water spaces all around through side and corner holes
at the foundation bar, making sure all mud and scale are dislodged.
The pipe connection No, 7 may be used for most classes, but a short
connection, No. 6 is needed for the back bottom corner holes which
are behind the steps.
In boilers fitted with combustion chambers, particular attention
should be given to the combustion chamber plates and stays, to
remove any accumulation of mud and scale.
Make careful inspection of all spaces with rod and light to make
sure there is no mud or scale deposits amongst the stays, the
boiler is clean. When inspection reveals the plates are clean and
nothing is lodged amongst the stays, the mud collector and mudhole
doors (if fitted) and plugs can be replaced. The condition of all
threads in boiler openings is to be carefully examined. If any hole
has not a full depth thread, it is to be booked for tapping out so
that a full thread is obtained. Care should be taken to see that the
Plugs ere not cross threaded, and threads of plugs, studs and joint
faces of belly plate doors or hand holes are greased with graphite
boiler plug lubricant, and properly tightened.
When replacing mud hole doors, a new lead seal shall be fitted,
the door located and tightened, then the nut should be slackened and
the lead seal inspected to see it is flattening evenly all around,
and not unduly thin or broken.
It is to be clearly understood that washout plugs, arch tube
plugs, or nuts of the mud collector must not be tightened when the
boiler has generated steam pressure.
All of these details shall be given a final tightening when the
boiler is warm, but before any pressure is raised. Washout nozzles
must be maintained in good condition at the couplings and the nozzle
tip is to be round and smooth so as not to damage the threads of the
plug holes.
Washout hoses and all couplings are to be maintained free from
leaks. Great care shall be taken in the handling of hoses and
nozzles under high water pressure; the water should be turned off
for the fitting of the various nozzles, etc. The hoses are liable to
kick when the pressure is applied, and if the jet of water is not
carefully controlled, the force is sufficient to cut out a man*s eye
or do other serious damage.
When heavy rains occur in districts causing turbid conditions of
the water, it will be necessary for District Locomotive Engineers or
other controlling, officers to pay particular attention to washing out
of boilers to ensure the removal of all silt.


3. Cold Water Washing Out,
(a) Boilers required for service under 24 hours or boilers to be
repaired, necessitating early attention, shall be cooled down prior to
cold water washing out.
Five hours after steam is out, for C3s> C 36, C3B, D 59 and D6O
class engines, and four hours after steam is out for all other classes
of engines, the boiler shall be cooled down in the following way:-
Remove the top filling plug in the front end of the boiler barrel
and insert the cold water hose and run in cold water until the boiler
shows a full glass of water, then open the blow down cock, so that the
level of the water in the boiler will be maintained at a height of not
less than half-glass. Allow the water to circulate through the boiler
until the temperature of the water at the blow down cock is 110°F.
The following times for different class of engines will serve as
a guide
D6O - Circulate cold water for 2 hours 0 minutes.
D 59 - Circulate cold water for 1 hour 40 minutes.
C3B - Circulate cold water for 2 hours 5 minutes.
C 36 - Circulate cold water for 1 hour 40 minutes.
C 35 - Circulate cold water for 1 hour 25 minutes.
D5O - Circulate cold water for 1 hour 10 minutes.
D 53-55 - Circulate cold water for 1 hour 10 minutes.
C 32 - Circulate cold water for 1 hour 0 minutes,
C3O - Circulate cold water for 0 hours 45 minutes
Zl9 and similar classes: Circulate cold water for 0 hour 35 minutes.
When the temperature of the water has fallen to 110°F., at the
blow down cock, the circulating water shall be shut off, and the boiler
allowed to empty. While the boiler is being emptied, all plugs and doors
shall be loosened. Washing out the boiler shall be started immediately
in accordance with the prescribed procedure described in Washout Rule 2.
(b) Boilers standing out of service for periods exceeding 24 hours,
or boilers booked for repairs not required to be emptied under this
period of time, shall be dealt with as follows.
After the engine is stabled in the shed, the steam shall be blown
down to zero through the injector steam valves, leaving approximately
half a glass of water in the boiler. The boiler shall then be allowed
to cool down gradually until required for washing out.


In no case shall the boiler be emptied until the temperature of
the water has fallen to 110 F. and the boiler shall be washed out im-
mediately it has been emptied.
4. Hot Water Washing Out.
The temperature of the water for hot washing out shall not be less
than 150 P.
Three hours after steam has been blown down, the boiler shall be
emptied through the blow down cock and, while the boiler is being emptied
all plugs and doors shall be loosened.
Immediately after boiler is empty, remove all remaining plugs and
doors and start washing.
At the commencement of hot water washing, the hose pipe must be
drained of any cold water that may be standing in the mains. Cold water
entering a hot boiler will cause damage to the plates.
It will be the Chargeman's responsibility to see that the correct
time has elapsed before the washing out is commenced.
In no case is a boiler to be emptied and left standing before being
washed out. As soon as the boiler is emptied the washing out must be
taken in hand at once and complete this is necessary to prevent the
silt hardening in the water spaces and on the sheets.
In depots equipped with hot water washing out systems, boilers that
are to be repaired must be cooled down first as per Rule 3 (a) and then
washed out with cold water. Boilers to be repaired must not be washed
out with hot water and then left standing, as this will cause contraction
to the stays and tubes and riveted seams, etc.
All washout plugs and mud doors must be removed for the washing
out of a boiler.
Boilers that are to be repaired, not necessitating early attention,
must be allowed to cool down before being emptied as per Rule 3 (b) and
then washed out with cold water to remove the mud deposits.
After a boiler has been thoroughly washed out with hot water, it
shall be examined immediately afterwards and then filled with warm water
to prevent chilling.
5. Boilers Fitted with Arch Tubes.
The following instructions are to be carried out where engines are
fitted with this type of boiler;-


Washout men shall carry out the operation of arch tube cleaning.
To ensure the proper cleaning of tubes, the cleaners shall be slowly
worked backwards and forwards until all scale has been removed from
the tubes.
On each occasion a boiler is washed out, the plug in the arch tubes
shall be removed and the pneumatic tube cleaner inserted from each end
and passed through the tubes to ensure the removal of any scale that
may be lodged in the bends of the tubes.
A light gauge metal sleeve shall be used to protect the thread in
the plug holes from wear by the cleaner hoses.
In the case of the arch tubes in the 038 class fireboxes, however,
these can only be cleaned by inserting the cleaner from the cab end and
passing it down the full length of the tubes.
Should there be any obstruction, bulging or fractures in the tube,
or fractures in the plates, the engine must be stopped for an examination
by a Boiler Inspector.
The Sub-Foreman or Leading Boilermaker, when on duty, shall, on
all occasions, examine the arch tubes after they have been cleaned out,
and before the plugs are re-inserted.
When no boilermaker is on duty, the Chargeman or Officer-in-Charge,
day or night, shall be responsible for seeing that the arch tubes are
properly cleaned.
At depots where there is no Chargeman or Boilermaker on duty, at
night time, the Officer-in-Charge of the Depot shall be responsible for
the arch tube plugs being removed and the tubes cleaned.
After the tubes have been cleaned by the pneumatic cleaner, they
shall be examined internally for signs of laminations, cracks, blisters
or other defects.
Under no circumstances shall the flared ends of arch tubes be
permitted to remain in a boiler if the projection of the tube into the
water space is less than § of an inch.
Arch tube cleaners are driven by compressed air, and at Depots not
equipped with a compressed air service, the tube cleaner can be driven
from the air supply of a locomotive.
Arch tube cleaners, when not in use, shall be kept submerged in
a bath of kerosene oil.
Each time before using the cleaner, the kerosene oil must be blown
out, after which the cleaner should be thoroughly lubricated with a
good grade of light machine oil, and this lubrication should be applied
before each cleaning operation.


Before using the cleaner a careful examination should be made of
the cutters and other parts to see that they are in good working order.
Care must be taken to see that the cutters do not go past the end
of tube in the water space, which, if allowed, will break the cutters.
Whenever arch tube plugs are removed, either at the boiler washout
period or any other time, special care must be exercised to ensure that
they have been correctly replaced and screwed up tightly. To prevent
the possibility of plugs loosening due to the effect of heat or other
causes, the employee responsible for replacing these plugs shall give
them a final tightening after the fire has been lit, and before any
steam pressure has been raised. This will enable any slight slackness
that may have developed while the boiler is wanning to be taken up.
Employees are warned not to attempt to screw up plugs while the
boiler is under steam.
If leakage occurs at plugs, the steam pressure shall be reduced
immediately to zero before any attempt to remedy the defect is made.
6, Boilers Fitted with Syphons.
Thermic syphons shall be examined both externally and internally
after all washouts and also at the monthly examination for the detection
of cracks, broken stays, mud-burns, mud or scale deposits, or other
defects. If any such defects are detected, steps are to be taken "to
remedy the position immediately.
The District Locomotive Engineer shall be held responsible for the
cleanliness and safety of Thermic syphons in boilers on the class of
locomotive allotted to his depot.
The Sub-Foreman, Leading Boilermaker or his deputy when on duty,
shall on all occasions examine the syphons after they have been washed
out. If no boilermaker is on duty, the Officer-in-Charge or the Chargeman,
day or night, shall be held responsible for seeing that the syphons are
properly cleaned after washout.
At depots where there is no Chargeman or Boilermaker on duty at
night time, the Officer-jn-Charge of the Depot shall be held responsible
for seeing that the syphons are properly cleaned out after washout before
the locomotive is allowed into service.
The rules laid down for arch tube plugs are to be applied to the
plugs opposite the syphons; under no circumstances are they to be
tightened while any steam pressure is in the boiler.
7. Cleaning Steam and Water Way Passages of Water G-auge Columns.
At each boiler washout the gunmetal plugs opposite to the ends of


steam and water passages in the water gauge mountings shall be removed
by the Washout man, and a ■§ inch diameter brass rod passed through each
passage to remove any obstruction, scale or sediment which may be dep-
osited therein, and cause a false water level. All passages shall be
kept clean and free, and the gauge cocks tested for satisfactory
operating condition.
At each monthly examination of gauge glass columns, the fitter
deputed to carry out this work shall, in addition to continuing to remove
the two face plugs for the purpose of testing the water ways leading
to the boiler, remove the plug immediately above the top of the gauge
glass.
A wooden dowel stick % inch in diameter and from 16 inches to 18
inches in length, shall then be passed right through the gauge glass
until it comes to rest in the bottom chamber from which the tray and
the ball shall have previously been removed, and it must be seen in this
position by the fitter before he is satisfied that the vertical passage
ways are unobstructed.
8. Filling Cold Boilers at Depots equipped with Hot Water Washout
Plants,
The practice of filling a boiler with hot water at a temperature
of approximately 150 F., after it has been washed out with cold water
is definitely prohibited. Where it is necessary to have a locomotive
with a cold boiler under steam early, the following course can be adopted
(a) First, run into the boiler sufficient cold water to fill it
up to the level of the intermediate plug holes in the firebox
side plates.
(b) Cut off the cold water and run in hot water until the correct
water level shows in the gauge glass.
This action will give a resulting water temperature in the boiler
of approximately 100°F., and will allow steam to be raised much sooner
than with cold water. It will also prevent undue expansion stresses
during the heating period.
Under no circumstances shall a cold boiler be forced to raise steam
under a period of two hours.
In all other cases where a boiler has been washed out with cold
water and is not required early, it shall be filled with cold water and
the usual period allowed for the lighting of the fire before the steam
is required.


g_7 Rules to be observed by Staff occupying Departmental Barracks.
(1) Rest Houses are provided for the accommodation of Running Staff
when booked off to rest at stations other than their home stations.
The term "Running Staff" embraces Drivers, Firemen, Guards, and
in some cases. Assistant Guards or Baggage Porters, Sleeping Car
Conductors, and Locomotive Trainee Englnemen when they travel out
and return with a train crew. Except in special cases, for which
authority must be first obtained. Rest Houses are not to be used
by other staff.
Employees who are booked off at stations other than their home
stations for an interval of not less than 4 hours in a broken
shift (as distinct from being booked off "to rest" after completing
a shift) may be permitted, when the greater part of the interval
is between 8,00 p.m. and 6.00 a.m., to occupy beds in Rest Houses
when beds are available and not required by other employees who
have been or may be booked off "to rest". Employees using beds
in such circumstances must not lie On the beds without undressing.
(2) The bed linen, blankets and other equipment are the property of
the Commissioners, and must not be removed from the Rest Houses.
(3) Any deficiency or damage to furniture or other equipment of the
Rest House should be pointed out by the occupant on taking possession,
so that he may not be held responsible for such deficiency or
damage.
(4) The cooking utensils must on no account be removed from the kitchen.
Employees using same are responsible for seeing that they are
properly cleaned before being put away, in readiness for later use
by others. Care should be taken to prevent grease being spilled
over floors or furniture, A receptacle is provided for scraps,
food refuse, etc,, and should be availed of as necessary to prevent
nuisance and annoyance to others.
(5) Baths and basins must be cleaned and emptied by those using them,
and care taken to prevent waste of water.
(6) SMOKING IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED IN THE BEDROOMS. Any breach of this
rule will be suitable followed up.
(7) Occupants must not sit or lie on the beds with their clothes or
boots on,
(8) Flare-lamps must not be used in the Rest Houses, and the lights
provided must be properly and economically used. During daylight,
or when the occupant is about to leave the premises, the gas or
other lights must be extinguished.


(g) In cases where there are more men requiring beds than can be ac-
commodated at the one time, those who have occupied a room for nine
hours or more will be expected to vacate it in order that others
may use it.
(10) The rooms set apart for men of certain districts or sections, must
be used by the men belonging to those districts or sections. If
at any time this rule cannot be adhered to, the attendant or local
officer is to be referred to, who will, if possible, make other
arrangement s.
(11) When not in use, bedrooms must be kept locked to prevent interference
or use by unauthorised persons. The keys will be held by the at-
tendant or other appointed officer, and anyone obtaining a key will
be held responsible for its return and, pending its return, will
also be held responsible for the room and its equipment.
(12) Employees resting in barracks must enter on the blackboard provided
their name and the number of the room occupied by them. When
temporarily absent from the barracks for any purpose, they must
indicate on the board their whereabouts, so that the necessary call
notices advising them of any alteration in their work may be delivered
to them without delay.
(13) Employees are requested to remember that they can add greatly to
their own and each other's comfort by observing orderliness and
cleanliness when occupying Rest Houses. The rooms are intended
to provide for the comfort of the staff entitled to use them, and
conduct detrimental to the general interest will not be tolerated.
7-7 Safety First Instructions.
Notice to Staff.

ployees for the express purpose of securing their safety from injury
while in the performance of their work, and any employees brought under
notice for disregard of any of these rules will be suitable dealt with.
Any employee who sustains injury at work, no matter how trivial,
whether it necessitates his relinquishing duty or not, must at once report
the occurrence to his immediate superior officer before going for treat-
ment, provided that the nature of the injury does not render him physically
incapable of doing so. Even if ambulance attendance is not considered
necessary, the injury must be so reported.

so authorised must inform the Crane Driver, if on duty, of the work
to be performed before ascending and on leaving the runway. Any
work which requires to be done on or from overhead crane runways
shall, in the ordinary course, be - carried out before or after working
hours*. In any emergency such work may be done during working hours
in either case before work is commenced the current to the main

to see that the cab roof does not come into contact with any o s rue i

Enginemen must use water to damp the coal on engine tenders prior
to engines leaving Locomotive Depots, under no c ircumstances
is the hose provided for this purpose to be used in the electritied
areas owing to the risk of injury to the employee using the hose
£ the even! of the water ejected therefrom coming into contact with the
overhead wires.
Enginemen are specially warned great car. is when
taking water or when handling the fire-irons to and from the tender,
and m far as practicable, they must avoid standing on the tende .
When the engine is in motion, enginemen are cautioned against
climMne S the back of the tender, either to obtain access to the
tool box or for other purposes, as this practice is dangerous and
might lead to their meeting with an accident by coming in contact
with an overhead structure or the electric wires.
A slight electric current exists occasionally between certain
water colJLm jibs in the electrified area and the water tank fill g
holes on engine tenders. These are rail or negative currents only,
and whiT e an employee using the water column may feel a slight shock.
Sis is' quite harmless and there is no reason to fear any dangerous
shock.
It must be distinctly understood, however, that this does n °J*
apply to the overheated electric wiring and fittings connected
throughout the electrified area.
The whole of these wires and fittings are at a normal potential
of 1,500 volts above rail or earth potential, and contact with them
will’almost certainly prove fatal.
When revolving a non-power operated turntable which is not fitted
with extension levers, an employee shall stand in
well and exercise pressure on the trailing side mere extensio
levers are fitted, then pressure may be exercised on such levers.


8 “7 Accident Prevention and safety promotion.
. . year a considerable number of employees sustain painful
injuries incurred in locomotive depots and it is necessary to stress the
following items associated with the calling of Enginemen.
Footwear; Suitable footwear should be worn at all times. Oil and grease
accumulating on concrete floors provide conditions conducive
to injury,
.goggles and Sieves: These are provided for various duties and should
be obtained prior to commencing such duties.
Enginemen's Goggles: These are available at a low cost to Drivers,
Firemen and Acting Firemen and their use is rec-
ommended and approved by the Chief Medical Officer.
Good eyesight is essential for all associated with*
train running and the protection of eyes from in-
juries by cinders etc., can be assisted by the use
of goggles.
Protective Clothing: This should be worn to minimise the risk of burns
and scalds to exposed portions, such as arms, coming
in contact with hot metal in cabs of locomotives
and on the other parts of locomotives.
Instructions for the guidance of Running Shed Employees and Safety First
regulations should be studied and in addition the following list of the
more common factors involving injuries should be carefully^emorised:-
(1) Clouds of steam from cylinder cocks of locomotives frequently appear
“: + Ot T de r tS r d When th6ir vision is ohacured, employees
cleared t d “ d W&lk Until SUch time as the steam has
(2) Mien two locomotives or vehicles are standing close together and
it is necessary to pass through, this must be done by stooping and
passing carefully under the buffers and not walking between tLm

due to neglect in this regard. xesuiiea

(between the rails) also make sure to walk in the directiSTaf
movement Frequently experienced railwaymen such as Fettlers Drivers
ad‘S: ” haVe been injUred due th » ir to cheese thH ’


(4) When necessary to assist a shed fireman by holding points, part-
icular care should be taken to hold the lever securely with both
hands. It is incorrect to sit on the levers of ball points.
Injuries have resulted and derailments occasioned due to inex-
perienced employees being jolted from the lever of ball points when
the locomotives pass over them.
(5) When mounting the steps to reach the cab of a locomotive, the correct
method is to face the locomotive and climb the steps. Many painful
accidents have been sustained due to hasty scrambling up and down
steps without a proper hand hold. Some locomotive steps tend to
become smooth and accentuate the risk of slipping. Care should
also be taken to avoid mounting locomotives whilst they are in motion.
When climbing down from locomotive cabs, always do so backwards,
facing the steps, as numerous accidents have been caused by climbing
down with back to steps, due to heels slipping off the steps.
(6) Steam locomotives are equipped with hot water service hoses. The
number of burns and scalds sustained by Enginemen handling these
hoses have been numerous and this, in many cases, can be attributed
to gross carelessness.
The hoses can be used when the injector is operating and care
is to be taken to see that the steam valve for the hose is firmly
turned off before the injector is shut off. The habit of shutting
off the injector without closing the hot water service hose has been
a major cause of injury as when the injector is applied again a jet
of hot water causes the hose to writhe out of control. The use
of the hot water service hose inside Loco, points is forbidden and
care should always be taken in its operation to avoid injury to
others.
The hot water hose control valve should always be checked before
turning on an injector, particularly when first taking charge of
a locomotive.
When using the hot water service hose, always arrange to stand
alongside the driver thus placing him behind the jet of water.
Any defects in the hose or connection should be brought under
notice.
(7) When locomotives are to be moved, care must be taken to warn employees
who may be working in, around or underneath and the long standing
regulations are quoted;-
"Ascertain by observation that no person is working on, under or
about the engine and that no parts are disconnected or red flags
or red lights are exhibited thereon, indicating that the engine is
not to be moved. Call out the number of the engine to be moved
and sound the engine whistle."


(8) When working in, around or underneath a locomotive an employee
should take steps to protect himself against movements. During
the hours of darkness a flare lamp should be carried.
(9) When crossing ash pits or inspection pits, use only the boards
provided for this purpose, or cross at the ends of the pit. On
no account should Enginemen step across the pit as this can cause
(10) a fall, resulting in serious injury,
(10) During darkness, bring under notice any difficulty experienced,
due to insufficient lighting or defective globes, particularly in
the vicinity of ash pits.
(11) When operating rocker bars on steam type locomotives, an Engine-
man should exercise care that his body is correctly positioned as
serious injury could be sustained by neglect in this regard.
(12) The mounting of tenders under electric wires is to be avoided.
Should it be necessary to dp so, this must be carried out by
authority of the driver and under his supervision. A number of
serious accidents have resulted due to lack of care in this regard.
(13) Extreme care should be exercised when opening firehole doors and
smokebox doors. When opening a firehole door the blower should
be opened slightly to avoid a back draught. To open a smokebox
door, stand well to the side to release the catch. Avoid close
contact with flare lamps as naked flames coming in contact with
gases forming in smokebcxes can result in an explosion. This is
particularly to be avoided when examining smokeboxes for suspected
blocked spark arrestors.
(14) Extreme care is to be exercised when applying the injector on a
locomotive in depots or yards to see that employees are not in the
immediate vicinity of the cab where the water from the injector
could cause burns or scalds. Avoid closing the water range before
the steam valve has been closed.
(15) When walking in locomotive yards or shunting yards for the purpose
of piloting a movement or other reasons, care must be taken to
avoid other locomotive movements. During the hours of darkness
a lamp should be carried in the hand.
When coupling or uncoupling, the coupling itself should be held
in a manner to ensure that the hands or fingers are not injured.
At all times allow the buffers to be moved together before
getting in between them to perform coupling or uncoupling duties.
(16) It is essential that the cab floors be kept clear of coal to
avoid the risk of injury brought about employees treading on coal
and being thrown off balance. The habit of tidiness should be
acquired and insisted upon by all enginemen.


(17) Oil cans and feeders should be properly located in the position
provided. Oil spilt fr<3m feeders and left on footplates creates
hazards to all concerned,
(18) When alighting from locomotives at water columns on double lines,
care should be taken to alight on the side which will afford a
view of approaching trains and opposing movements.
(19) Examination of locomotives should be undertaken as far as practic-
able with cylinder cocks closed to avoid the risk of visibility
being restricted by escaping steam from these cocks.
(20) At de—ashing pits care should be taken to avoid placing the hands
in vicinity of rails or working parts of locomotives. Injuries
have been sustained due to locomotive being moved during de—ashing
operations.
(21) When operating on non-steam type locomotives, all employees con-
cerned should ascertain the location of high tension equipment and
avoid any contact with it .
In addition the following hazards should be considered so far as
these non-steam type locomotives are concerned.
(a) Speed of approaching trains and locomotives performing
shunting duties tends to be faster.
(b) When adjacent to an electric or diesel electric locomotive
always remember that the noise of the 'prime mover 1 and/or
auxiliary motors prevents you from hearing the approach of
trains or vehicles.
(c) Before you dismount from a locomotive, first look carefully
in each direction and rely on your vision rather thsCn your
hearing to protect yourself from the hazards of approaching
trains or shunting movements. During the hours of darkness in
these circumstances, always carry a lamp, this helps enginemen
on the other locomotives to locate you,
(d) When working 46 class electric locomotives, watch your knuckles
when operating hand brakes.
(e) When walking through machinery compartments of a locomotive
in motion, walk with your feet wide apart and use every hand
grip available.
(f) On diesel electric locomotives, be careful of oil deposits
which would cause your feet to slip. When grasping hand grips,
ensure that these are not heated.
(g) In locomotive cabs, always lean inwards away from windows and
openings when passing other trains.

(h) When coupling or uncoupling locomotives, work on the Driver’s
side where he can see you and when using automatic coupling

then locate in position the necessary air hoses and adjust the
auto coupler jaw and chain. This being necessary, because of
