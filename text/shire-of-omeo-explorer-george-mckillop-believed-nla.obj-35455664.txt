"Since I wrote the foregoing account of Van Dieman's Land, I have
seen a considerable portion of the southern provinces of New South Wales
having travelled from Sydney nearly to Wes tempo rt, passing through the
Gow Pastures, Goulburn and Limestone Plains, Monera Downs, and from
thence by the south of the Australian Alps or Snowy Mountains to the
westward, through a country never before visited by any European ...

Comments on above report by Ghas* Daley, Esq*, Hon* Secretary of the
Historical Society of Victoria;-
,f I am inclined to believe that George McKillop crossed the Deddick
Creek and then the Snowy River twice, the last crossing being about in
a line with the present village of Benombra* He seems to have reached
the south of Lake Omeo, which he called Strathdownie* He came from the
Monaro district., and entered Victoria round the easterly slope of the
ranges* I think it would be correct to say that George McKillop crossed
the Snowy River in the vicinity of the present McKillop Bridge, in 1835,
and discovered the Omeo District The province was not named
Gippsland until 1840. McKillop f s journey preceded that of McMillan*
McMillan entered Gippsland over the Snowy River in 1839, penetrating
a ° f&** os Buchan (Ht* Haystack) 5 then in 1840—41? he again came,
ultimately reaching Port Albert* Strezlecki, coming over the Mitta
Mitta River to Omeo, followecL'his route to the Macalister River, then
made his way to Western Port;"
