The Chairman said, before the Secretary read the papers he had an
important communication to make, which had been entrusted to him by the
President of the Society, whose absence that evening he regretted. It had
reference to the search which it is proposed to institute for further traces of
that gallant and distinguished explorer, Dr. Leichhardt, or for remains of his
expedition. The first journey of this great traveller, for which he received the
Gold Medal of the Society, was undertaken from the then nascent colony of
Moreton Bay, now called Queensland, towards Port Essington. Subsequently,
in 1848, he undertook the colossal geographical exploit of traversing the whole
of the Australian continent from east to west ?from Queensland to Swan Eiver.
From his very first start on that expedition down to a very recent time, no
trace whatever has been found of him. The present project of search had
originated in consequence of certain discoveries which had been made by
Mr. Mclntyre, who, in traversing the continent in search of pastoral lands
from south to north, had lighted upon two marked trees on the banks of the
Flinders River, which had given rise to the idea that the search for Leichhardt
would not be a hopeless undertaking. The proposal has been taken up by
three of the Australian colonies in a national sense, and each colony has sub-
scribed in the most munificent manner towards the expedition. The project of
search has been received in a similar way, nationally, to that with which we took
up the search for Sir John Franklin. By an unanimous resolution the Council
of the Royal Geographical Society have subscribed 200 Z. out of its funds in
order to assist. This expedition has already started from Melbourne, under
the leadership of Mr. Mclntyre, who, from his previous experience in Australia
and his general ability, if any man in the world can do it, seems to be the man
who would lead it to a successful termination. The President, Sir Roderick
Murchison, is most warmly interested in the matter, and had desired him to
announce that a public subscription would shortly be opened at the Society?s
rooms, and also at Messrs. Coutts, and Messrs. Cocks and Biddulph, bankers.
Tiro following papers were read; ?
1. Description of the District of Cape York, Australia. By John
Jardine, Esq., Police Magistrate, Somerset, Cape York.
This paper was a detailed description of tbo neighbourhood of
Somerset, the new settlement at Cape York, built on the shores
of the channel which separates York Peninsula from Albany Island
in Torres? Straits. The peninsula proper is a tract of land about
15 miles in length, separated from the rest of the mainland by Ken-
nedy River, which stretches nearly across the neck of land between
Newcastle Bay and the western coast. The land is hilly, and in
the valleys the soil is a reddish loam, more or less sandy; but on
the ridges luxuriant vegetation and beautiful flowers cover the
large blocks of ferruginous sandstone. Very little of the land is
suitable for agriculture; the grass is long and coarse; horses and
cattle keep their condition fairly, but the country is quite unsuited
to sheep; goats may be kept with advantage, and pigs find an


abundant supply of food in tho scrubs and swamps. The climate is
dry for eight months of the year ; the rainy season lasts' from
December to March inclusive, and this is the hot season, the
thermometer reaching sometimes 98� in tho shade. But, during
the dry season, a fresh bracing breeze from tho south-west blows
almost continually, and the thermometer averages during the day
from 80� to 85�. The climate is perfectly healthy; there is no local
malady, even in the wot season, and tho author considers that tho
new settlement will hereafter become a sanatorium for invalids from
India and China. Tho author gave also a most interesting descrip-
tion of the aborigines, of which four distinct tribes inhabit the
district.
The paper will be printed entire in vol. xxxvi. of the * Journal.?
2. Explorations in North-Western Australia. By James Martin,
Esq., m.b.
The chief geographical interest of this paper referred to tho dis-
covery and exploration of the mouth of the Glenelg Eiver, by the
party of which Mr. Martin was a member. The Eiver Glenelg was
discovered so long ago as 1838, by Captain (now Sir George) Grey
and Lieutenant Lushington, and an attractive account of the region
was given in tho ? Journals of Discovery in North-West Australia,?
afterwards published by Captain Grey. But neither of these ex-
plorers w T as able to reach the mouth of the river, nor had it been
detected by our naval surveyors. The expedition to which Mr.
Martin belonged was organised in 1863, by a committee of settlers
in Western Australia, for the discovery of new pastoral lands in the
tropical portion of the colony; and tho party, consisting of four
explorers, set sail in the schooner Flying Foam. It was not until
many vain attempts and much delay, that the schooner succeeded
in finding the mouth of the Glenelg, in the place where it was
supposed to lie ?namely, in Doubtful Bay. The difficult entrance
from the sea led into a large expanse of waters (called ? George ?),
all the channels out of which, landward, seemed to end in a passage
choked up with mangroves. Land parties could, however, descry
from tho top of a neighbouring hill the river flowing towards tho
place, and the true mouth was, after six days? search, found in the
north-eastern end of the George Water. The river for the first few
miles flows through a rugged hilly country, and has many rocky
islands in its channel. Its shores afterwards become flatter, but
the navigation was difficult, owing to the great fall of the tide?
-28 feet ?leaving tho schooner aground always at low water. After


connecting their explorations with those of Grey and Lushington,
the party examined the tract of country between the Glenelg and
Camden Harbour, and reported favourably on its suitableness for
settlement.
This communication will be printed in extenso in the ? Journal,?
vol. xxxv.
At the conclusion of the papers, the Chairman read the following extract
from a letter of Admiral Stokes, who expressed his regret at being unable to
attend the meeting :
? I consider Mr. Martin?s discovery of great importance, as it gives water*-
carriage to the good land that Sir George Grey (the discoverer of the Glenelg)
speaks of having found on its banks. Such a mode of transit in so rugged a
country must indeed be considered a great acquisition. Delighted as I always
am, at seeing enterprising colonists taking up positions on the northern and
western shores of Australia, I fear that success will not attend settlers on the
north-west coast in the neighbourhood of Camden Bay; for, bountiful as Nature
has there been in the way of harbours and in giving a great rise and fall of
tide, numerous islets and outlying reefs give the coast a forbidding approach,
added to which are the frequent calms which prevail. Nowhere does salubrity
depend more on a certain fresh breeze than in intertropical settlements. I
consider that the very rugged nature of the country, with its ovenlike valleys
in the neighbourhood of Camden Bay, holds out but poor prospects for the pro-
prietor of cattle and sheep.?
Mr, Ckawfubd was of opinion that the tropical part of Australia, which
constitutes about one-third of the whole continent, is not at all likely to be a fit
place for the rearing and pasturing of sheep, or for European colonization.
With respect to the temperate portion of Australia, although possessing a
most salubrious climate, it is deficient in ? those grand features of physical
geography which make a country fertile and capable of sustaining a great
population. For instance, there are no great rivers in this vast region : there
is no valley of the Mississippi; none comparable to that of the Ohio, the
Danube, or the Ganges.
Sir Charles Nicholson here remarked that there were the valleys of the
Murrumbidgee and the Darling, much larger than any of those which Mr.
Crawfurd mentioned, except the Mississippi.
Mr. Crawfurd, in continuation, said that the South Australians had
planted a settlement at Adam?s Bay, in lat. 12�, and never was failure more
complete. The country in that part of Australia was totally unfit either
for sheep or for Europeans. It was from that spot that a party of the
settlers made the extraordinary boat-voyage of IGOO miles (of which we heard
an account on a previous evening) in order to escape from it. Another attempt
had been in lat. 15�, at Camden Harbour, the neighbourhood of which Mr,
Martin said was favourable for depasturing sheep. Admiral Stokes, on the
contrary, said it never will be fit for the depasturing of sheep. The summer-
heat is from 98� to 120�, and is that a place for sheep whose fleece is required
only for warmth ? He had seen an account in a Dutch newspaper of a visit to
the settlement paid by the English vessel Jenny Orwell, in the spring of 1865.
The account stated that there were 100 persons there, and that the chief
purpose of the experiment was the depasturing of sheep, of which about 5000
were taken to the place. The colonists were in a very desponding condition:
a great many of the sheep had died from the effects of heat and want of food ;
and out of the 5000 a few hundred only remained, after seven months? resi-
dence. That report seemed to condemn Camden Harbour most completely.
VOL. x. II


Sir Charles Nicholson said, on one or two points lie was happy to agree
with Mr, Crawfurd. He thought, for instance, that the settlement at Camden
Harbour was a most absurd enterprise. The first statement in the report ol
the survey of that district ?namely, that there was only a million of acres
of land?was at once decisive against the establishment of a colony there,
when there are hundreds of millions of acres of land unappropriated in
various other parts of the Australian continent. Besides, the very character
of the grass, G feet high, was to any one accustomed to the rearing of slice])
a sufficient proof that such a country is utterly unfit for the depasturing ol
sheep. This was the first occasion upon which he had really acquired a
clear conception that a colony had been formed in that particular locality.
With regard to Adam?s Bay, no doubt there has been a great deal of wrangling
and squabbling among the persons entrusted with the founding of that colony ;
but it remained to be proved that that country is not capable of profitable
occupation in some way or other. That North Australia should be placed under
the jurisdiction of South Australia is an absurdity for which the Colonial Office
is responsible. That sheep will thrive within the limits of the tropics is
a matter placed utterly beyond doubt. It is notorious that, at the present
moment, there are within the region of the tropics not less than four or five
millions of sheep depasturing, and thriving as well as in any part of the
Australian continent. He quite admitted that further north the climate would
be found incompatible with the healthy growth of sheep ; but in those regions
at the head of the Gulf of Carpentaria there is most luxuriant pasture suitable
for cattle. With regard to the alleged want of fertile valleys, like those of
the Mississippi and the Ohio, it is a fact that there are some of the largest rivers
in the world in the south-eastern part of Australia, which, in the case of the
Murrumbidgee and the Murray, are made available by steamers for a distance
of 1200 miles. There is no doubt that these valleys will ultimately become the
seat of a vast population. Again, on the east coast, the Fitzroy River drains
an area of country as large as the whole of England. There are portions of
Australia destitute of water, and 'not suitable for settlement; but there is the
whole of the eastern and south-eastern portions, with capabilities equal to those
of any portion of the globe.
Mr. Crawfurd said he was aware of the existence of the Murrumbidgee
and the Murray, but they have no outlet, and are, therefore, inferior to the
great rivers in other parts of the world. No doubt, parts of the continent are
fertile ; but the fact that the Australians arc fed by corn brought from California
and Chili show's that the general fertility of the country is inferior. He had
said that with respect to sheep there is no part of the world comparable to
temperate Australia. The amount of wool imported, into this country alone,
from Australia last year was 99,000,000 lbs., of the estimated value of
8,800,000k He had also said that, within certain limits of the tropics up to,
perhaps, about latitude 21�, sheep might thrive. But he maintained that the
fleece deteriorated considerably in quality and quantity; already the fleece of
Queensland is inferior to the fleece of Sydney.
The Chairman, in conclusion, said what we wanted in discussions of this
kind was as little as possible of inferential argument and as much as possible of
direct *testimony. On the one hand we have the fact that a settlement has
been formed in tropical North-Western Australia, the sheep being transported
with the settlers by a long sea-voyage from Swan River, and we know that
those sheep have entirely failed. On the other hand, we have direct testimony
that sheep from Queensland and the temperate regions of Australia have been
gradually transported by land into the sub-tropical and tropical portions of
the continent, passing quietly and gradually through a grass country favourable
to the pasturing of sheep, and these sheep have suffered no material deteriora-
tion and have most distinctly thriven. It is not in the competence of any man


at present to be able to draw a line, and say that at the tropic of Cancer, or at
a line north of it, the pasturing of sbeep stops and ceases to be profitable. The
most that can be said is this?he was citing the opinion of Mr. Brodrib, quoted
by Sir Roderick Murchison in his Annual Address?that sheep do most dis-
tinctly thrive which go northwards from Queensland to the tropics: not in the
equatorial tropics, but in the less typically tropical regions on the north side of
the tropic of Cancer. But the weight of the fleece does undergo diminution,
and it has been found necessary to import fresh rams every two years from the
temperate regions of Australia, in order to perpetuate the breed and enable it
to produce wool at anything like a satisfactory profit. Still, if that can be
done, it is so far an argument in favour of this gradual and tentative extension
of sheep-breeding from Queensland northward. He wanted to point out the
difference between that and the sheep which are transported,per saltum, by a long
sea-voyage from south to north; and that, in this way, it is perfectly possible to
reconcile the conflicting statements they had heard. He wished, finally, to
explain that the new establishment at Cape York is neither an agricultural
nor a pastoral settlement, but is founded by the Government of Queensland, in
conjunction with the Home Government, chiefly as a harbour of refuge in
connection with the navigation of Torres Straits.
