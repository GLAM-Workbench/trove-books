“A DOZEN FACTS WORTH REMEMBERING *
(1) Tattorftall's (Hobart) are Ihe only genuine successful promoters of Monster Consultations in Australasia,
conducted under Licence from the Tasmanian Government and DRAWN UNDER SPECIAL SUPERVISION OF A
REPRESENTATIVE Of government, and in the presence of Public and Members of the Press, also the Police.
(2) Payments for Cash Prizes and Scratched Horses (Non-Starters) in all our consultations are available 24 hours after publication
of result slips.
(3) Tickets are issued subject to "TattersallV right to conduct the Consultation upon some other race or upon some event or
chance or in any form of Lottery should circumstances in “TattersallV* opinion render it necessary to do so. Prizes will be
distributed as near as possible in the proportion as per our synopsis.
(4) Our distribution of prize money is more liberal than that of any other lottery or art union in Australia or elsewhere.
(5) By our system of drawing, one ticket can draw one each of the cash prizes, besides a horse.
(6) All drawers of Unclaimed Prizes are duly notified by Registered Letter—Commonwealth - o'f Australia and New Zealand—two
months after date of race, and elsewhere four months after- The money is available at any time, providing that the claim
can be fully established.
(7) A printed list of every drawing as Issued to the Public is duly obtained by the Tasmanian Government Audit Department, and-
**TTie>^l\ecl^acl^urm 1 Representative takes away
*
(6) We never divulge the names and addresses of the drawers of horses before the race.
(9) We will not on any account undertake Laying Off or Hedging as between Drawer and Horse Owner, or any other person what-
soever, nor will we at any time or in any way recognise such transactions.
(10) Members of the public can always see over our premises, and have the system by which we conduct our business thoroughly
explained to them.
(It) Should a race be cancelled or postponed indefinitely or for a long period after a sweep on such race has been drawn, the
holders of tickets which have drawn horses not scratched up to the date originally set down for running the said race will
participate in a Supplementary drawing as a Cash Prize Lottery, to decide first, second, and third prize winners. All drawers
of horses other than the holders of the first, Second, and third prizes will share equally in the distribution of amounts allotted
amongst the drawers of starters and non-starters,
(12) The Tasmanian Government has authorised the Trustees of the late Geo. Adams’ Estate to carry on the Licence and conduct
the Sweep Business, without any intermission, under the same management as during the past many years.
