HISTORY OF NEW SOUTH WALES.
The Administration of Governor Bourke.
The successor to Governor Darling was Major-Gen. Sir Richard Bourke, K.C.8.,
who arrived in the colony on the 2nd December, 1831. An interregnum of
six weeks had elapsed since the departure of his predecessor, during which
short interval the duties of Acting Governor were discharged by Colonel
(after Sir) Patrick Lindsay, of Her Majesty’s 9th Regiment. Sir Richard Bourke
was born in 1778, and was educated at Westminster, and at Christ Church,
Oxford. He was originally educated for the legal profession, but having a
predeliction for the military service, he embraced the profession of arms.
During the Dutch campaign in 1799’ h e followed the Duke of York and was
severely wounded on the battle field. In South America, in 1806, he was
Quarter-Master General, and took part in the siege of Monte Video, and in
the expedition to capture Buenos Ayres. From 1809 to 1814, he served in the
Peninsula war, and in 1825 was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of the eastern
district of the Cape of Good Hope. In 1831 he was appointed Governor-in-
Chief of this colony, and during his six years term of office he proved himself
a most able and popular ruler. Indeed for very many years after his departure
from the colony he was affectionately termed, “Good old Governor Bourke:’"
he displayed the talent and energy, as well as the vigour and firmness of
Macquarie, combined with a frank and hearty manner and a disposition to be
strictly just and humane.
He commenced his Government under the happiest auspices. The
restriction of the liberty of the Press by Darling and his subsequent hard
treatment of certain members of the community, materially affected the interests
cf the colony, which was only then slowly recovering from a drought of
unexampled severity aggravated moreover by a general depreciation of
pioperty of every description. He had been described as a man of superior
intellectual attainments, endowed with high moral sense and enlightened and
humane views, and the colonists naturally enough hailed his administration as
the dawn of a happier era. Indeed, his high reputation, contrasted with the
unpopularity of his predecessor, predisposed all classes of the community to
entertain the most favorable opinions in his favor. It is not surprising then
that his reception was a most enthusiastic one, and celebrated with great
pomp and show, the rejoicings lasting several days, Sydney and the country
honoring the event with a general illumination. This installation as Governor


presented a remarkable contrast to that of Darling’s, and seemed to indicate
the foreshadowing of better times. He was welcomed by an address from the
citizens moved by Mr, Francis Stephen (Sir Alfred Stephen’s brother), which
set forth that they “ indulged a well founded hope that with the termination of
unfavorable seasons the reign of discord and terror had also passed away ;
and that with the return of plenty, a wise and fostering government might
restore concord and fellowship, and reproduce in the colony that fellowship
which had been so long and so wantonly suppressed.” In this address they
told his Excellency and through him the Imperial Government that there did
not exist a more loyal, peaceable and obedient people than the colonists of
New South Wales, and all they required from the mother country were those
institutions which were their birthright as Englishmen. The most singular
part of this address, which was full of dictation and compliment, was an
attack upon the late Hon. Alexander Macleay, then Colonial Secretary,
charging him with being “ the abettor of measures which called down upon
their author the general disapprobation of the community ” and “ an officer
who during six years had been unable to command any portion of the public
confidence.” The Governor’s reply to this memorial (which oddly enough
addressed the representative of the Sovereign as “ Sir ” instead of “ His
Excellency ”) was admirable, for it silently passed over the gratuitous recom-
mendations which formed the greater part of the memorial and administered
a mild rebuke for the intemperate allusions to the executive officer by remark-
ing that u Internal union, one of the first of national blessings, it should be their
care to promote by the total oblivion of past dissensions, and by the sacrifice
of resentments, public and private, upon the altar of their adopted country.”
Governor Bourke was not long in office before he showed that the
predictions as to his special ability to govern the colony with wise and vigorous
measures were not misplaced. His great talents and unequalled industry
helped him to infuse life and vigor into commercial concerns, and to elevate
the physical as well as the moral condition of the people.
On his assuming office Bourke found that much discontent existed in
reference to the land question. Regulations for the disposal of land were left
entirely in the hands of the governors from 1788 to 1824, and grants were
bestowed by the Home Government upon persons who were willing to proceed
to the colony and settle there. The M'Arthurs, the Macleays, the Suttors, the
Australian Agricultural Society, and a host of others, were among the favoured
colonists who amassed large estates, and as pioneers proved that Australia, for
the raising of stock and the production of fine wool, is essentially the squatting
region of the world. In those primitive days stock was kept on Crown grants,
but its rapid increase called for fresh pastures, and the stockowner ran his


stock on untenanted wastes. This utilisation of waste territory added to the
national resources, and was not objected to by the Government; but an evil
grew up by persons who did not own any land buying stock and depasturing
it on the waste lands, and by others obtaining stock by robbing the flocks and
herds of the principal colonists, altering the brands, and forming small stations
in the far interior. The appellation of “ squatter” was then applied to those
wandering shepherds, who carried on a predatory warfare against the flocks and
herds of their neighbours, but since 1842 that term has been applied to pastoral
tenants who rent the Crown lands from the Government for grazing purposes.
However, “ the squatting abuses,” continued until 1826, when a stringent
regulation which gave no security of tenure whatever, and exacted payment of
one pound for each hundred acres so occupied was adopted, and constituted
the first system of leasing the Crown lands. An entirely new system was
eventually introduced in 1831 by Bourke, under orders from the Home
Government. Except for churches, schools, glebes or other public purposes,
the Governor was no longer authorised to grant Crown lands to any person
whomsoever. Crown lands were to be disposed of by auction only at a minimum
price of ss. per acre, and a deposit of 10 per cent, and the balance in one
month were to be the conditions observed by the purchaser. The colony was
divided into counties and parishes, and the lands were put up in lots of one
square mile. Definite regulations for pastoral, or what is called squatting
pursuits, were also promulgated. These unsold lands were opened to be
leased in lots of one mile square each, at 20s. per lot per annum. The leases
in all instances extending over one year only. As a considerable amount of
arrears were due by the purchasers of Crown lands —one of Bourke’s earliest
popular measures was to allow the creditors to pay their debts by three annual
instalments, security being given by mortgage —the result of the new regulations
was the opening of the interior to pastoralists, and the rapid increase of
speculators forced up prices of colonial stock to an unheard of extent. Dreams
of wealth disturbed the placid minds of the colonists, and rash speculations
in stock and station property followed the news of the high price which colonial
wool realised in the English market. Ultimately Bourke found it difficult to
prevent the lawless occupation of Crown lands even within the limited areas.
It was useless for the Earl of Camden, then Secretary of State for the Colonies,
to write to him in 1834, “ urging that it was not desirable to allow the popula-
tion to become more scattered than it then was.” The Governor regretted the
enforcement of the law, and from the enormous development of pastoral
pursuits acknowledged the necessity of expansion. In his reply, which showed
exceptional merit, he admitted that a certain degree of concentration was
necessary for the advancement of wealth and civilisation, but he conld not avoid


seeing the peculiarities which rendered it impolitic and impossible to restraint
dispersion within limits that would be expedient elsewhere.” Wool was then
the colony’s chief wealth, and flockowners must send their large flocks beyond
the boundaries of location to preserve them in health. He urged that “the
colonists must otherwise restrain the increase or endeavour to raise sufficient
food for their stock.” He added, “whilst nature presents all round an unlimited
supply of the most wholesome nutriment, either course would seem a perverse-
rejection of the bounty of Providence,’ and in conclusion he asks “ how may
this Government turn to the best advantage a state of things it cannot wholly'
interdict ?”
Despite all regulations the unauthorised squatter most unblushingly
evaded the law, and growing bolder continued to spread in all directions, like
the Arabs of the desert. However, Governor Bourke systematised and
simplified measures for obtaining either absolute possession of Crown Land im
fee simple or its use for pastoral purposes. In theory emigrants and others
before his rule had been entitled to obtain what they required, but in practice
they could not obtain a grant except by influence or the bribery of
subordinates. The favoured few culled the choicest parts of the colony, but
Governor Bourke introduced a new arrangement by the abolition of free grants,
and dividing the “ wild lands ” beyond the boundaries of settled localities into
squatting districts. He levied on squatters an annual license fee, and a poll-
tax on their stock, conceding by custom the advantages of pre-emption to
discoverers of new pastures. He made the acquisition of land easy to those
who were disposed to buy, occupy, or cultivate it. He saw through the selfish-
ness of monopolists, who as great flock-owners used to adopt a system of
“eating out” the smaller capitalists by sending vast flocks of sheep to devour
the pasture around the poor settler’s homesteads. Like Macquarie he
encouraged a small class of yeomanry, and was the first to legalise pastoral
occupation, which has since been a source of incalculable wealth to the colony.
Successive enactments led to more liberal treatment of flockmasters and
the consequent increase of the flocks and herds of the colony. Two important
measures were passed in August, 1834, one empowering Commissioners to
hear and determine claims to grants of land promised by previous governors,
and the other an Act to protect Crown Lands from encroachment, intrusion,,
and trespass. At this time the prosperity of the colony was unprecedented,,
whilst the arrival of free immigrants from Great Britain in great numbers
strongly indicated the rising importance of the colony. This large accession
of immigrants was due to the Governor’s numerous despatches on the subject
of relieving the distress prevailing among the agricultural laborers of the
South of England. One of his Council’s earliest acts was the voting of


(which was increased by £ 7,000 from the British treasury) for immi-
gration purposes. Eventually the surplus of the land revenue and of the other
casual revenues of the Crown were appropriated for the assistance of immigrants.
With the inroad of immigrants and general advance of things, pastoralists who
had been petted by the State saw with dismay the progress of agricultural
settlement upon their demesnes. They sought pastures new, and spread
beyond prescribed limits, and by their rush to the waste lands of the c010ny,,.,
and notably to the pastures of Port Phillip, they brought the question of
lawless occupation of Crown lands to a crisis. Lord Derby, in December, 183 d,
and Lord Glenelg, in July, 1835, wrote elaborate despatches —one against the
occupation of Twofold Bay, as recommended by Governor Bourke, and the
other against the occupation of Port Phillip, as recommended by Colonel
Arthur, Leiutenant-Governor of Tasmania. Each of the Secretaries of State
objected to the measures, intimating the “ consequence of which would be tO’
spread over a still further extent of country a population which it was the
object of the land regulations to concentrate.” They declined sanctioning
the projects on the ground of expense to the mother country and danger to
the natives and settlers. Governor Bourke, acting according to law, issued a
proclamation forbidding the trespass and warning the settlers from off the
fertile lands around Port Phillip. He sent his emissary, Mr. Stewart, J.P., to
disperse the intruders, but that gentleman found the work of colonisation had
been deeply-rooted, for there were in the district 35,000 sheep, with a number
of horses and cattle, under the charge of upwards of 200 stockmen, who had
crossed from Tasmania. The warning of the Imperial Government was as
futile as their warning in 1852, against the tearing up of Crown lands in search
of gold. The Gordian Knot was at last cut by Lord Glenelg expressing his
general concurrence with the views of the Governor that in consideration of
the capital expended in the Port Phillip district an early occupation of that
territory should be made. Accordingly, His Excellency visited the district in
March, 1837, and founded the City of Melbourne.
The knowledge of Australian geography was greatly extended during
Governor Bourke's administration by the efforts of Major (afterwards Sir)
Thomas Mitchell. This distinguished explorer was born in Stirlingshire in
1792, and joined the British army in 1808 in Portugal. In 1811 he served in
the Peninsular War, and was specially engaged surveying the battle-fields.
In 1827 he surveyed Eastern Australia; and in 1831, under the auspices of
Acting-Governor Colonel Lindsay, he fitted up an expedition to the northward,
to ascertain whether there was an outlet for the waters of the north-western
interior. An escaped prisoner named Clarke, who had resided with some
native tribes at Liverpool Plains, had brought to Sydnev some information he


had received from the natives of the existence of an extensive river called
Kunder (Gwydir) by the blacks; and on November 24, 1831, Major Mitchell,
with a party of fifteen men and two volunteers, Messrs. White and Finch, with
seventeen horses, carts, and canvas boats, left Sydney, to test the truth of the
blacks’ story. On November 19th they reached the Peel, then the limit of
exploration in that direction, ond on December 22 nd they discovered the
river Namoi. At this point the canvas boat was launched, and a man sent
back with the news, but he was never heard of again. They next discovered
the Gwydir (so named by Mr. Richard Cunningham), on January 9th, 1832,
and Cunningham followed it for twelve days, until he reached a place called
Kavuala by the natives, but now known as the Maclntyre. On reaching the
head waters of the Darling, Mitchell waited for supplies from a permanent
depot established on the Namoi, but his assistant, Mr. Finch, only returned
with a sad tale to the effect that the camp had been surprised by 100 natives,
who had murdered the two men in charge and had carried off the stores. On
July nth, when 100 miles from the junction of the Murray and the Darling,
they started on their return journey, and reached Sydney in safety. Major
Mitchell in .this tour ascertained that the Darling was the receptacle for the
various rivers rising on the western declivity of the Dividing Range.
In May, 1833, the Imperial Government announced to Governor Bourke
a desire that an expedition should be taken to explore the course of the
Darling. As a preliminary step Mr, Dixon, in October, 1833, was despatched,
.and he traced the ranges between the Lachlan and the Macquarie by
proceeding westward from Wellington Valley. Fie followed the Bogan for 67
miles, and returned without attaining the chief object in view. The main
expedition started in March, 1835, to trace the Darling from the point where
Sturt had left it to solve the problem whether the outlet of a river discovered
.by Sturt when sading down the Murray was really that of the Darling. The
• expedition comprised Major Mitchell and a strong party of twenty-one men,
with eight vehicles, pack-horses, and exploring appurtenances. They took a
westerly course from Boree, near Bathurst, and proceeded along the Bogan
River, for New Year s Creek, as Sturt named it. Here Mr. Cunningham lost
himself in the bush. It may be incidentally stated that Mr. Cunningham was
.an eminent naturalist, and historians have confused his name with that of Allan
Cunningham, the eminent explorer, who died in Sydney in 1839, anc l who was
buried in the Devonshire-street Cemetery. Mr. Cunningham, after losing
himself, wandered about for five days, until he fell in with some natives, who
.treated him kindly for some time, but becoming delirious from sunstroke or
some other malady, the blacks murdered him. His remains were never
.recovered, and probably, like those of many Australian explorers, lie


mouldering in the bush. On the 25th May Major Mitchell's party saw the
Darling, which they traced for 300 miles to the southward, leaving only 130
miles of its course unexplored. Unfortunate encounters with the Blacks
induced the party to return to Sydney, where they exhibited thirty-two new
varieties of grass discovered in their travels. On the 15th of March, 1836,
Major Mitchell, with a party of twenty-seven men, set out on another expedi-
tion, designed to complete the survey of the Darling, and on his return to
explore the Murray. After exploring down the Lachlan they struck across for
the Darling, reaching the Murrumbidgee, the Murray Scrubs, and the Darling
Junction. In June they explored the Murray, and traced the Loddon for
three days. They next explored that splendid tract of country called
“Australia Felix” by the Major, but now known as the colony of Victoria.
From the summit of Mount Macedon the Major saw Port Phillip and the tents
of Batman and Fawkner, near the present site of Melbourne. On reaching
Portland Bay he saw Mr. Edward Henty, who formed the first permanent
settlement in the Port Phillip District. This highly successful expedition
placed Major Mitchell’s name foremost in the ranks of Australian land
explorers, and gained for him the honour of knighthood.
First in importance among the legislative changes effected by Governor
Bourke’s government must be ranked the “ Bourke Church and School Act,”
which removed some of the most galling disabilities of religion. In 183-5 a
Church and School Corporation Act was passed to provide clergy and teachers
throughout the colony. In addition to monetary aid from the government the
corporate body had the control for church and school purposes of not less
than one-seventh of the settled public lands. Here was a bequest which if
wisely utilized would have exceeded in munificence anything known in history..
But the whole of these magnificent areas were held in trust for the Church) of
England only, and the other Churches were debarred the enjoyment of the
fund. So great was the outcry at this supposed act of favouritism that in 1833
the statute was dissolved by an order of the King in Council. Governor
Bourke then, in a despatch dated 30th September, 1833, propounded principles
of religious equality which displayed wisdom far in advance of previous
traditions of colonial government. He pointed out that the annual charge for
the Church of England was for the Church of Scotland, ;
and for the Roman Catholic Church, while Protestant dissenters-of
other denominations received no support from the government beyond small
blocks of ground as sites for chapels. He urged that in a new country to
which persons of all religious persuasions are invited to resort, it would be
impolitic to establish a dominant and endowed church without much hostility.
If, on the contrary, support were given as required to the three divisions-of


Christianity and the management of their churches left to themselves, the Public
Treasury might in time be relieved of a considerable charge. However, in
1836 the Council passed an act under which whenever 00 had been raised
\by private subscription towards building a church the Governor might issue
from the Treasury any sum not exceeding A minister with 100 adult
.attendance was entitled to per annum ; if 200 adults, per annum;
and if 500 adults, £2OO per annum. Under this Act per annum was
doled out to the three leading denominations. The authorities were allowed to
quietly resume the acres now worth millions of money, while the clergy
grasped at the moderate sums of money instead, and the official gifts to
schools were rather arbitrarily bestowed.
In proportion as the colony emerged from tutelage and became entrusted
with progressive powers of self-government, so did the official authorities
extend its pecuniary aid to education. Governor Bourke was one of the first
governors who strove to improve the system of education. He made an
attempt to introduce the Irish National School system, but was defeated by
religious jealousies. His opinion was “ that schools on the Irish system, in
which Christians of all creeds are received, where approved extracts of
scripture are read, but no religious instruction is given by the master or
mistress, such being imparted one day in the week by ministers of different
religions attending at the schools to instruct their respective flocks, would be
most suitable to the condition of the colony. It would be necessary that the
Government took the lead in their institution, erecting school-houses, appointing
well-qualified teachers, at liberal salaries.” In order to strengthen the general
complaint respecting the disproportionate assistance for education, he urged—
“ I may, without fear of contradiction, assert that in no part of the world is the
general education of the people a more sacred or necessary duty of the
Government than in New South Wales.” Of late years the local Government
have taken pains to fulfil that duty ; and reading Governor Bourke’s charter of
religious freedom, and liberal basis of public instruction, in the light of current
events, one can only pronounce them as lasting monuments of his liberality
and statesmanship.
Prior to Governor Bourke’s rule the Press was under the surveillance of
the strictest kind, but with the expansion of affairs a gradual improvement
appeared. One of Governor Bourke’s first reformations w 7 as to break off the
Government patronage to the Sydney Gazette , thus leaving all official measures
to speak for themselves. So long as the official organ gave utterance to
adulatory sentiments on Government measures the Opposition papers found
something to cavil at. These official utterances of the Gazette were sore
bones of contention, and if Governor Darling had exercised the same wisdom


as his successor he never would have distinguished his administration as “ an
era of libels.’' On the 7th of March, 1832, Governor Bourke instituted The
New South Wales Governme?it Gazette for the mere promulgation of all
public service announcements.
Under Governor Bourke’s sway the discussions of the Legislative Council
assumed an improved character and prepared the way for representative insti-
tutions. His predecessor had illegally and systematically exercised authority
without reference to his Councillors in the distribution of revenue. Governor
Bourke, on the contrary, did his best to give the Council the tone and
functions of a representative assembly. He caused the first Appropriation
Bill to be passed on the 21st of March, 1832, and one of the items therein
appropriated to bring out to the colony female farm servants from the
agricultural counties of England, at the rate of of
the Commissioners of Emigration in England. Unlike any of his predecessors be
was frank and generous to the non-official members of the Council, and he
earnestly co-operated with all of them in raising the character ot the Council.
In effecting reforms in the administration of justice, Governor Bourke
played an important part. He established Circuit Courts. The prison disci-
pline adopted by Governor Bourke was highly creditable to his enlightened
mind and sense of justice. During his six years’government 15,000 immigrants
arrived, and the proportion of the sexes was about 30 women to every 100 men.
While Governor Bourke was taking steps towards the introduction of
representative institutions, and to establish municipal institutions, active strife
pervaded the internal affairs of the colony. He had incurred the antagonism
of the magisterial class by striking the name of Major Mudie off the com-
mission of the peace. Just about this time a pamphlet, bearing the signature
of “ Humanitas,” which spoke in scathing terms of a section of the colonists
and colonial magistracy, was circulated in England and the colony. The
authorship of this pamphlet was accredited to Mr. (afterwards Sir) Roger
Therry, a favourite of the Governor's immediate supporters; and when that
gentleman was nominated by the Government party to the vacant office of
Chairman of Quarter Sessions, the Governor’s opponents induced Mr. C. D.
Riddell to allow himself to be nominated in opposition. The contested
•election resulted in favour of Mr. Riddell by a large number of magisterial
votes. Mr. Riddell’s election was gazetted, but Governor Bourke “resented
the departure from official propriety ” which Mr. Riddell, as Colonial
Treasurer, had shown, by permitting himself to be the tool of a hostile faction,
and removed his name from the membership of the Legislative or Executive
Council. Mr. Riddell appealed to the Secretary of State, and Governor
Bourke intimated to the Home Government his desire of retiring, unless his


act was confirmed. In January, 1837, a despatch arrived in the colony from
Lord Glenelg reinstating Mr. Riddell in the Executive Council, as he con-
sidered a year’s suspension quite sufficient punishment for the error committed
by Mr. Riddell. A separate despatch to the Governor urged Bourke not to
resign, but the Governor was determined not to sit with Mr. Riddell in the-
Council, and he sent home his resignation. In September the announcement
that his resignation was accepted reached the colony, and on the sth December,
1837, Governor Bourke left the colony for England, by the ship Samuel Winter,
having administered the affairs of the colony just seven years. Previous to his
departure a valedictory address was presented to him by a public meeting, in
which reference was made to the many useful reforms effected during his rule.
Other addresses were presented to him by the Council and religious bodies. A
statue was erected by private subscription in the Domain. Westmacott was the
sculptor. The inscription records his services for the people thus:—
“ This statue of Lieutenant-General Sir Richard Bourke, K.C.8., is erected
by the people of New South Wales to record his able, honest and benevolent
administration from 1831 to 1837. Selected by the government at a period of
singular difficulty, his judgment, urbanity and firmness justified the choice.
Comprehending at once the vast resources peculiar to this colony, he applied
them for the first time systematically to its benefit. He voluntarily divested him-
self of the prodigious influence arising from the assignment of penal labor, and
enacted just and salutary laws for the amelioration of penal discipline. He
was the first Governor who published satisfactory accounts of the public
receipts and expenditure. Without oppression or detriment to any interest,
he raised the revenue to a vast amount, and from its surplus realized extensive
plans of immigration. He established religious equality on a just and firm
basis, and sought to provide for all, without-distinction of sect, a sound and
adequate system of national education. He constructed various public works
of permanent utility. He founded the flourishing settlement of Port Philip,
and threw open the wilds of Australia to pastoral enterprise. He established
Savings Banks, and was the patron of the first Mechanics’ Inititute. He
created an equitable tribunal for determining upon claims to grants of lands.
He was a warm friend of the liberty of the Press. He extended trial by jury
after its almost total suspension for many years. By these and numerous
other measures for the moral, religious and general improvement of all classes,
he raised the colony to unexampled prosperity, and retired amid the reverent
and affectionate regret of the people, having won their confidence by his
integrity, their gratitude by his services, their admiration by his public talents,
and their esteem by his private worth.”
Sir Richard Bourke died in 1855 at his seat in Limerick.
