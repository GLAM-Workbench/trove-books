OF THE
NORTHERN TERRITORY TIMES.
I
: y,.




The Northern Territory in 1898 and the
Prospect for 1899.
The progress which has been made in the settlement during the year 1898
may, on the whole, be regarded as encouragingly satisfactory. The statistics
which are already in hand convey the comforting assurance that our industrial
pursuits have maintained a healthy tone throughout the year.
-W nins-
Operations in gold mining, which really comprehend the bulk of our
business, have resulted in an increased yield of gold, and this is all the more
congratulatory when we take into account the partial slump at Wandi, and the
fact that several of our erstwhile gold-producing claims were only worked in
an exploratory sense. The total value of gold exported during 1898 amounts
to £84,467, which is an improvement of £3443 on the export for the previous
year. We have every reason to anticipate an even better record for the
current year. The Driffield and Woolngie country promises to open up rich;
the Eureka Gold Mines, Ltd., whose new mills are now at work, are expected
to become regular gold producers ; increased machinery and the employment
of a cyanide plant at the Brock’s Goldfields mine, should largely increase that
Co.’s gold returns ; and there is promise of improved developments in other
quarters. Estimating the actual mining population at 3000 (which is probably
excessive) the average of gold produced amounts to slightly over £2B per head
Comparative returns will be found in tabulated form on another page, as well
as the Chief Warden’s Report for 1897—the latest official report at our
command.
Apart from gold production there has been little or no mining activity
shown. One hundred tons of copper and 45 tons of tin ore represent the whole
of our dealings in the baser metals for the year. This, however, is no criterion
of the value or extent of our mineral lodes, but rather indicates a disinclination
to touch anything at the present time excepting gold That tin, copper and
silver are to be found in many parts of the Territory, has been proved beyond
doubt, and when the conditions under which these minerals may be worked are
sufficiently liberal to attract investors with the necessary capital, it is possible
that profitable results will follow. At the Macdonnell Ranges, in the extreme
north of the Territory, gold is being obtained in fairly satisfactory quantities,
but the mica deposits, which were worked to some extent in previous years,
are for the time being in idleness.
A new goldfield is being opened up west of Tennant’s Creek, in hitherto
unexplored country, and the prospects so far are very encouraging.
A party is at present prospecting at the Victoria River for coal. Accord-
ing to geological report, the indications are all in favor of coal being found in
this region.


ifaAtoral.
If the export of cattle is any indication of healthy business amongst the
squatters, the year’s operations proclaim a decided revival. The abandonment
of the Eastern cattle trade has confined the export to crossings over th«
border, and in this way some 13,067 head were disposed of, the Customs valu-
ation of which is declared at £42,551. This is a very liberal increase on the
trade for 1897. Steps are being taken to test the market at the Philippines,
and if the demand is such as to ensure profitable dealings we may witness a
resumption of the over sea export. A great deal depends upon the enterprise
of the pastoralists themselves. The tick scare, added to border restrictions,
caused much irritation amongst cattle dealers, and it is to tie sincerely hoped
that before this year is out these disabilities will be removed.
The wholesale slaughter of buffalo in the Adelaide River and Alligator
Rivers districts has been pursued with increased vigour—so much so that unless
the Government take steps to protect them from the rifles of the hide hunters,
the buffalo will undergo total annihilation in another season or two. It is
estimated that quite 40,000 head have been shot since the hunters first made
war on them.
Our trade in sheep and wool is as yet in its infancy, butrit is encouraging to
know it is increasing. The product of wool for 1898 is recorded as 517,460
lbs, of an estimated value of £14,275, whilst the number of sheep exported
was 5659 head, valued at £2304. It should be stated that this enterprise is
practically in the hands of one or two station holders, though it is probable
tfiat before long other lessees, particularly those to the eastward, will temper
their allegiance to cattle production by stocking their holdings with sheep.
The breeding of horses has undergone no radical change for better or
worse. Yet the Territory is in parts admirably adapted for the raising of all
classes of horses, and it also possesses facilities which cannot be claimed by any
other part of Australia for the breeding and export of horses suitable for India
and the East generally. Encouragement in the shape of special leases has been
offered by the Government with the view of securing the Indian trade ultima-
tely, but we cannot hear of any noteworthy response to the invitation.
Agriculture.
This industry is practically a dead letter, except for small areas that are
cultivated for vegetables. i
general.
Pearlshelling returns show a large increase on the business of the previous
year; population has increased at a fair rate; and generally speaking the
records are flattering rather than otherwise. The grand totals contained in
Customs Returns give a very fair estimate of what the Territory’s business
may develop into when its resources become better known to the outside world.

H|he following is the Chief Warden’s Report for 1897,' re-printed
from the Government Resident’s Report on Territory matters for the
same period :
Warden’s Office, Burrundie,
February 7th, 1898.
Sir,—
I have the honor respectfully to sub-
mit my annual report on the progress of gold
mining in district A, Northern Territory,
for the year ended December 51st, 1897.
The gold returns for the year is 18 8670z5, !
made up as follows :—Battery, 14,8550z5. ;
cyanide works, 2,0120zs ; alluvial and
dollied, approximately, 2,0000z5. You will
observe that there is a decrease of (j,1960zs *
in the battery returns for tlie year, the !
gold won from that source for the year 189 > |
being 21,0510zs ; for 1895, 28,9590zs ; and
for 1894, .‘>o,77lozs. No stone from deep
levels was crushed last year, and, with the
exception of a few hundred tons, all stone
crushed was obtained by the usual Chinese
system of mining.
The treatment of battery tailings by
cyanide at Eureka and Pine Creek is satis-
factory, though operations were much inter
ferred with by rain. No return was
obtained for the few hundred tons of tailings
put through cyanide vats at Fountain Head ;
but operations there were discontinued, and
the owner, Mr. N. F. C. Parry, informed me
that he intends shifting that plant to his
Mount Ringwood battery. These cyanide
operations will augment the yield of gold
considerably next year.
A small amount of alluvial, or rather sur-
face, gold continues to be obtained, giving
employment during the rainy season to
about 400 Chineseand twenty-six Europeans.
The Northern Territories Goldfields of
Australia Company has, during the year,
made good and substantial progress in de-
veloping some of their mines, particulars of
which are given in the detailed account.
Mr. Win. de Muller, the general manager,
has kindly forwarded to this office complete
returns of last year’s operations, and in
doing so bitterly complains of the bad roads
between the mines and the railway stations,
causing delay and incurring great expens e
in the carting of machinery and stores to
the mines. This company has already
expended judiciously a very large sum of
money in machinery and development,
besides erecting between their properties
about fifty miles of telephone lines ; and I
trust that by the end of this year the results
obtained will be commensurate with their
large expenditure.
No new discovery of any importance has
taken place during the year, there being
only a few Europeans out prospecting.
One serious mining accident occurred, and
resulted in the death of a European engineer
at Pine Creek.
During the year twenty gold mining
leases, comprising 271 acres, \. ere granted ;


eight leases (granted in 1806), comprising
ninety-six acres, were forfeited on applica-
tion ; and two leases declared void. The
minimum number of able and competent
men to be employed on the land now leased
is 854, but on a large number of gold mining
leases no attempt appears to have been made
to comply with the labor conditions, the
ground being taken up presumably for
speculative purposes, as the area held is out
of all proportion to the capital of the lessees.
Only thirty-six quart/, claims were registered
in this office, the majority of which were
abandoned a few weeks after registration.
With a few exceptions the Chinese tribute
system of mining is continued throughout
the district; it suits the European and
Chinese leaseholders and their mortgagees
to continue same, as they receive dividends
and interest without spending a penny in
machinery and development.
As coming and going constantly took place
during the year, it is impossible to give an
estimate of the number of persons that
engaged in mining at the different centres
but 164 Europeans, and 1,600 Chinese
worked at reefing and cradling ; of that
number quite 400 Chinese are physically
unfit to do a day’s work, and are, from a
sanitary point of view, a source of danger,
for they herd together in old delapidated
filthy thatch humpies, oiten with pigs, dogs*
and fowls.
The Chinese at Pine Creek are making
every effort to mine on the newly pro-
claimed goldfields, quite thirty were work-
ing alluvial at Woolngie for about ten weeks,
and carted five tons of stone from there to
the Chinese Pine Creek battery befor e the
police or this office heard of their illegal
actions. The Chinese smile at being fined
by a warden, but they object to being re-
moved from a new goldfield by the police.
The goldfields revenue for the year is
£6lO 11s 3d, an increase of £7O 14s 3d. I
would respectfully submit that through a
warden not having the power to deal sum-
marily with offenders quite £7OO a year is
lost to the revenue, for the cumbersome pro-
cedure now to be followed to punish persons
that offend against the Cold Mining Acts
and Regulations is unworkable when applied
to Chinese offenders in this gold mining
district.
I herewith beg to enclose battery returns
for the year, and give detailed accounts of
the different mining localities.
Pine Creek.—The yield of gold from this
district shows a large decrease. The two
batteries crushed '1,085 tons of stone lor
2,5300zs of gold ; the returns for 1896 being
4,065 tons for 6,2300z5. As about 1200/s of
the yield of gold was obtained from Wandie
stone and 40ozs from Woolngie the gold won
from the Pine Creek lines of reefs is only
2,3700z5.
This large decrease in tire yield would not
be so serious if, as in some of the other
mining centres, the unworkmanlike surface
mining by Chinese was discontinued to
allow of systematic development ; but this
is not the case, for the last six months of
the year not a pump was working on the
whole lines of reefs, and during last
December applications were lodged in this
office for exemption from work for nearly
every lease in that locality on tire grounds
of being unable to cope with surface water.
The slight effort made by the Cosmopoli-
tan Company to deepen the Dashwood shaft
and open up levels ended in nothing, the
new Knowles patent vertical pump is left
at the bottom of the shaft, the wire-rope
having broken when it was being lowered.
On the Rashi-Razouk lease the lessee did a
little good mining during the dry season,


but the appliances he had to cope with the
water were totally inadequate, and the reef
worked was poor. With this solitary in-
stance there is no development worth
noticing. With one or two exceptions all
the leases at Pine Creek are held by
Europeans.
Union- —As seen by returns 8,159 tons
were treated by the four Union mills for
2,4800/.s of gold. The stone crushed by the
Man Yet Company was obtained principally
from old workings, to the depth of 150 ft. on
their leases Nos. 4s to 7s. The best crush-
ings put through were 48 tons for 1360z5,
and 15 tons for 52ozs, obtained from leaders
on leases Nos. 6s and ss.
The Byart roller mill, working three
months, treated stone obtained at a shallow
depth from leases No 1 u to4u. During last
October a Sin. 4ozs leader was found on
lease No So, which tributes are still working.
Only surface mullock obtained from the old
Union P.C. lease was put through the old
fifteen-head battery.
The Northern Territories Goldfields of
Australia Company let their Alice Hills
leases and battery on tribute to the Chinese,
and of the stone crushed by that battery
814 tons, yielding 2650z5, were from Man
Fong Low’s leases No. 2n to 4n', including a
crushing of 80 tons for 109ozs. A few tons
of stone were put through for local European
leaseholders, and the remaining mullock and
a little ore from the company’s leases. In
mining no progress has been made on the
Union lines of reef for the year.
Extended Union,—The battery was
Avashed dowm by the McKinley Creek flood-
waters early in January, and re-erected
near the end of the year. Only a few
Chinese were engaged in surface prospecting
on the leases.
Flora Belle —Of the stone crushed by
this battery only 12 tons were obtained
from the Elizabeth Lease, and 40 tons from
a Chinese quartz claim ; the rest (1125 tons)
was carted from the Spring Hill leases.
Spring Hill.—The Chinese No. 2 Howley
battery has been shifted to, and erected at,
the Rosalie battery site, about two miles
from the Spring Hill leases. All the; e
leases are worked by Chinese tributors, and
from A. E. .lolly’s leases they raised 1,012
p»ns of stone, which was crushed at the
Flora Belle battery, and yielded 1,4010zs of
gold ; and from the Kook Hing Company’s
leases 408 tons, crushed at the Rosalie and
Flora Belle batteries for 4970z5. The atone
was obtained from the main reef and some
parallel leaders to a depth of 60ft.
Eureka.—the Northern Territories Gold-
fields Company let their mill and leases on
tribute to Chinese for four months, who
treated 580 tons of surface ore and mullock
from the Maybell and Eureka leases for
1940zs of gold. Mr. D. D. Rose w a me, the
assistant manager, then took charge, and at
200 ft north of old underlay main shaft
erected machinery to work a 9in pump, and
sunk a main shaft 114 ft to cut the main lode
at 250 ft. At the 66ft level drove a crosscut
south into the main lode, which is there
stoped to 80ft (water level). A winze was
then sunk 10ft in the main lode in solid
pyrites. At 66ft another level was driven
140 ft west to cut another reef at intersection.
The old north drive from underlay shaft
cleaned out and re-timbered 246 ft, and con-
tinued to 446 ft from underlay shaft. A
cyanide plant erected to treat 1000 tons of
tailings a month, and a telephone line erec-
ted between the company’s Union and
Eureka properties.
Yam Creek.—The Northern Territories
Goldfields of Australia Company for the
first six months of the year did a lot of pro-


specting, principally oh leases No 558 and
White’s Hill ; but work had to-be discon-
tinued for a time, as it will require power-
ful pumping machinery to cope with the
water met with. On lease No 216 they
continued the main shaft —14ft Gin x sft—
to the depth of 50ft. An old tunnel on
lease No 275 was continued a considerable
distance ; two shafts, each sunk 50ft, and
from them drives in all directions ; drove
an adir in White’s Hill 300 ft, cut the main
20ft lode, and drove along its course for 50ft.
but found it to be barren. On lease No 316
Old Newman’s tunnel was continued, and a
winze sunk 40ft in a shoot of good ore.
The latter part of the year the leases and
battery were let on tribute to Chinese, who
on lease No 338 raised (and crushed) 802
tons, which they obtained from mullocky
lodes and leaders to the depth of 50ft (water
level).
Brock's Creek, John Bull Line. —This is
now a busy centre, for, with its own
it is the head quarters of the Northern Ter-
ritoiies Goldfields of Australia Company,
and the depot for the mines on the Howley
line of reef. , During the year the progress
of mining on this line of reef has been satis-
factory. On the Faded Lily pumping and
winding machinery has been erected, and a
Dm pump lowered in the 14ft Gin x sft shaft*
which has been deepeued-to 160 ft and steel
lined to 150 ft. At that depth a chamber
has been cut, and drives put in short dis_
tauces. At 70ft in main shaft driven 00ft
and cut in main lode, which is Bft thick but
poor; the main lode was then driven on
south, and a shaft sunk for ventilation.
Minewoiks for exploration purposes weie
carried on in old shafts and workings on
north end of Faded Lily Lease.
On the Alligator Lease an adit of 112 ft
driven, cutting the main lode, which was
found there to be barren. A shaft sunk 30ft
on Crocodile Lease, and a drive west from
bottom with good prospects. In the old
main shaft Britannia Lease, at water level,
a drive of 100 ft to other old workings for
ventilation. On the Alligator, Crocodile,
and Britannia Leases powerful pumps will
be required for further work. This com-
pany’s Brock’s Creek battery treated 1260
tons of surface for 2950zs from Ah Cow
quartz claim ; 105 tons of stone for 6oz from
Mount Tymn Leases, and 100 tons of surface
from Faded Lily Lease for 4ozs of gold.
The prospects of the Brock’s Goldfields,
late Zapopan Company, are good, for the
new manager with the old Gin lift deepened
the main shaft (which is sunk in a low lying
flat) to 180 ft, and at the 150 ft level drove
20ft, cutting the reef sought, which now
averages 2ft Gin wide. This reef has been
worked to the 90ft level, but is now first
met with in mother-country, and though
more refractory is far richer in gold. -V
drive has been put in 160 ft following the
lode, and 300 tons of ore from drive stacked
at battery. A ‘ Knowles ’ 9in pump was
lately lowered in the main shaft to cope
with the water that is expected to be very
heavy when another lode is driven in from
the 150 ft level. This Company, on lease
No 329. sunk a shaft 118 ft, and at 100 ft
level drove north 115 ft into broken country,
on lease No 331 sunk a shaft 100 ft and drove
151 ft north, and on lease No 139 sank a
shaft 59ft (water level). The stone crushed
by the battery was all from upper levels.
Of the stone crushed by the John Bull
battery 100 tons was surface stone, which
averaged 4dwts to the ton, the rest from
main reef. The lessee, Mr. Isaac Daniels,
has sunk two main shafts 4oft and 100 ft
deep, and cleaned out and partly timbered
the old main shaft to the 125 ft level ; also
cleaned out the old drive to 200 ft, where
the reef is 2ft wide, and a four-ton crushing


gave Bozs of gold. On the western portion
of this lease (the John Bull) the lessee has
Sunk three shallow shafts on the main reef.
On the Bergan United Lease and leases
IS os 578 and GGI a little surface prospecting
and trenching has been done by Chinese for
the lessees.
Howley Line of only good
mining on this line of reef during the year
was by the Northern Territories Goldfields
of Australia, who, on lease No. 374, erected
pumping and hauling machinery and
lowered a 9in pump, and continued their
main (13ft Gin x sft) shaft to the depth of
130 ft with steel lining. At the 110 ft level
cut a large chamber, and drove a tunnel
437 ft north to an old shaft (deepened 42ft;
for ventilation and drainage. From the
same level a crosscut driven west 115 ft. At
112 ft in the old Chinese workings a large
amount of exploration work has been done,
and considerably over 1000 tons of quartz
broken out for trial crushings. A mill site
has been prepared to the east of the main
shaft, necessitating the shifting of 2000 cub.
yds. of ground, and a complete ten head
stamp Californian mill is in course of erec-
tion, and being connected with the main
shaft by of tramway.
This company worked their old mill on
lease No. 421 for a few months, the stone
crushed obtained from their lease No. 374.
At the bottom of the old Chinese pump
shaft at this mill they drove 115 ft east to
crosscut a body of ore that the Chinese had
extensively worked on the surface ; but as
this shaft partially caved in during the
heavy wet, the drive was stopped until next
dry season.
The No. 2 Howley battery was shifted to
near Spring Hill, and the leases on the
north-western end of the reef have a deserted
appearance.
The two Cosmopolitan (Howley) batteries
crushed 4486 tons for 30680zs of gold. Ihe
stuff put through was obtained and treated
very cheaply, and ought to pay well three
small shafts have been sunk to the depth of
100 ft. 130 ft, and 140 ft on lease No 372, in a
4ft quartz lode, averaging lOdwts of gold to
the ton : hut the bulk of the stuff crushed
was obtained from leases Nos 447, 448, and
450, where large mullocky lodes and forma-
tions are being rooted out by Chinese. 1 his
is the worst mining centre, from a warden s
point of view, in the mining district, as it is
essentially Chinese. The two battery own-
ers and storekeepers are the ‘ mandarins of
the 180 Chinese at the Cosmopolitan How-
ley, consequently, after visiting the dis-
trict with and without the police, serving
notices, threatening, etc., I managed to ob-
tain during the year from these Chinese the
sum of £5 11s for the goldfields revenue,
made up as follows —£4 for two six months
business licenses, 30s for three miners
rights, and Is for renewal of a quartz claim
held by the said three rights.
Woohvonga.—During the year the North-
ern Territories Goldfields of Australia
Company completed the erection of pump-
ing and hauling machinery, lowered a 9in
pump, deepened their main 14ft Gin x sft
shaft to 100 ft, and steel liimd it. At the
70ft level put a crosscut into the lode and
followed it both ways 100 ft ; besides a 110 ft
level along a leader beyond main leader be-
yond main lode and end of said leviM, con-
nected with the surface by an air shaft. On
lease No 48G, at the bottom of a 70ft shaft,
drove a level 180 ft, and carried in some
other works of an explorative nature.
The company let the battery and leases
on tribute to Chinese last April, and they
crushed 405 tons of stone from various leases.
Only a little surface fossicking was done on
the Chinese Woohvonga leases during the


Fountain Head.—This field is nearly
deserted, only a few Chinese fossickers eke
out a living, cradling the old alluvial work-
ings. A cyanide plant is erected here, but
the owner only put through a few hundred
tons, as the returns were poor.
Mount Ringw’ood. —The battery returns
ft'om this field is given as 783 tons for 6980 z
of gold. lam rather doubtful of this re-
turn, given me by the late Chinese manager.
As the Chinese workings of the saddle reef
on lease No 584 fell in early in the year, the
bulk of the crushings was surface ore and
mullock obtained from the different leases,
though some good stone was obtained from
a rich shoot of ore on lease No. 585. Last
October the Chinese holders sold the battery
and leases to Mr. N. F. Clinton Parry, an
experienced miner and prospector, who
crushed for the Chinese tributors 38 tons of
ore stacked at battery, which yielded 73ozs
of gold. The new owner has started two
good main shafts on lease No 585, and
stopped all tributes on his leases. Mr-
stockings, who is now in charge of the mine,
informs me that he can only get a few of
the 40 Mount Ringwood Chinese miners to
work at the wage of 5s per day of eight
hours, and he is trying to get Br ock’s Creek
storekeepers to send him men.
Mount Tymn.—These leases are held by a
local syndicate, who employed a few Chinese
to prospect and continue the tunnel in the
hill to 145 ft. A contract was let to Chinese
who quarried out about 200 tons of stone ;
but it was very poor, for 105 tons crushed
at Brock’s Creek only yielded 6ozs of gold.
Stapleton.—The leases have been lying
idle most of the year, as only since last Sep-
tember about 20 Chinese have been working
there on tribute for the new lessee, though
a prospector (Mr. Parry) engaged a Euro-
pean and some Chinese to assist him to
prospect the line of reef early in the year.
Great Northern.—Seven gold mining
leases are now taken up in this locality,
principally by local European miners, seven
of whom worked about seven months on the
reefs, and employed the same number of
Chinese miners for four months to assist
them. A few shallow shafts have been
sunk to the depth of 26ft; 18 tons of ore
raised was crushed at the Woolwonga bat-
tery, and yielded 47ozs of gold.
Sandy Creek, Bridge Creek, and Mar-
garet.—About 100 Chinese worked for allu-
vial in these three localities during the year
but the returns only averaged about 18d a
day per man. On leases Nos s<o and 571,
Margaret, some Chinese were prospecting
for reefs, and sunk some shallow shafts.
Wandie—The returns from this locality
are disappointing, a number of leases and
claims granted in 1896 being abandoned,
and if it were not for some new shows the
battery would have been hung up the
greater portion of the year. The population
of this field is now-forty, and a dozen of
these cradle the surface during the wet.
The best crushings were from the Wandie
Belle Lease, 30 tons of which were carted
to a Pine Creek battery. Numerous small
shafts have been sunk to the depth of 70ft
on the different holdings, and drives in and
along the different reefs and leaders.
Though rich leaders are met with, the main
lines of reefs are poor near the surface, and
will not support the present population,
capital and more good miners being required
to develop the reefs at a distance.
Driffield.—About a dozen Europeans were
working during the wet season near the old
Chinese alluvial find, cradling the surface
and dollying small leaders; some Chinese
also attempted to work the alluvial.
Woolngie. —A few European prospectors
worked on this field during two montns of
the year, and one prospector all the year.
Quite 30 Pine Creek Chinese miners worked
illegally there for about ten weeks, and are
reported to have obtained 200ozs of alluvial
gold. When properly worked this will be a
rich field.

Vessels bound to Port Darwin from
the Eastward by way of Dundas
Straits, after rounding Cape Don,
which lies in hit. 11° 17' S., long. 131°
49' E., a course should be steered so as
to pass to the North-Westward of
Cape Hotham, due care to be taken to
guard against the flood tide, which
enters the Straits from the N.E., and
after passing Cape Don, runs with
great force to the South-Eastward to
Greenhill Island, and then trends to
the Eastward, where the flood tide
running into the Gulf through the
Vernon Island joins it, and will, if not
guarded against, set a vessel consider-
ably to the Eastward of her course.
During the S.E. monsoons the smoke
from the bush tires, combined with the
haze which invariably hangs over the
low land, renders it very difficult to
distinguish the land during the night.
It is, therefore, far preferable for a
steamship to run her distance at full
speed . and anchor until daylight.
After sighting Cape Hotham a course
should be shaped for the Vernon
Islands, Howard’s Passage, which lies
between the S.W. Vernon and the
East and North-West Islands, is the
best. A distance of three and a-half
(3-i) miles should be kept from the
East end of the East Vernon, in order
to clear a shoal lately discovered by
H.M.S. Flying Fish, upon which there
is only 13ft of water at low water
spring tide. A course can tlum be
steered through the passage. When
abreast of the S.E. end of the East
Island, a red buoy with perch will be
seen. This is moored off the S.W.
end off the West spit of East Island.
Notice to Mariners.
(Directions for geesels entering Sort Darwin.
From this buoy, which should be left
on the starboard hand, another buoy,
with perch, painted black will be seen.
This buoy is moored off the N.W. end
of Henry Ellis Reef, and should be
left on the port hand. When abreast
of this buoy, another buoy with perch,
painted black, will be seen to the
westward ; it is moored to the N.W.
of a patch marked on the chart of
having three (3) fathoms on it, but ii*
some parts only two have been found.
This should also be left on the port
hand. After passing this buoy, a
course should be shaped so as to pass
to the westward of the bank extending
from Lee Point to the North of East
until Point Emery, a bluff white did
bears S. by E. half E. A course can
then be shaped for the entrance of the
harbour.
Coming from the Westward, in the
N.W. monsoons, vessels should make
Cape Fourcroy, the S.W. Cape of
Bathurst Island. A course can then
be shaped for Port Darwin, proper
allowance being made for the tides,
which run very strong during the
springs ; flood to the eastward, ebb to
the westward, to the southward of
Bathurst and Melville Islands. In
standing across from Cape Fourcroy,
Charles Point, on which stands a
white painted beacon, will be sighted.
Should the beacon be down, Charles
Point will be known by its being the
highest land on that part of the coast ;
it is composed of bright red ironstone.
It, should not be approached nearer
than three (3) miles, which distance
should be kept from the shore until
King’s Table, a remarkable] flat-topped


hill at the head of the harbor, opens
out well clear of Talc Head, which
makes like a round-topped island. A
course may then be steered so as to
pass Point Emery about half a mile
distant, when Fort Hill and the vessels
in the harbour will be seen. The
Boarding Station is now fixed—Point
Emery bearing north 17* west, and
Talc Head west 9° south.
In the S.E. monsoon, sailing vessels
beating along from Point Charles
should not stand inside the line of

show how well this valuable product will thrive here under suitable conditions
of soil and climate. Rubber, hemp, and a variety of other tinre plants, arrow-
root, spices of many kinds, cotton, Kola, oil-producing plants, and tropical

Rivers of the Northern Territory.
The principal coastal rivers of the Northern Territory, beginning on the
eastward, are the Robinson, Macarthur, Roper, Liverpool, King, Alligators,
Adelaide, Blackmore, Daly, Fitzmaurice, and Victoria.
The longest of these is the Victoria, which runs 160 miles inland, and is
navigable for small craft for about 100 miles. H.M.S. Beagle, drawing 13ft,
went up the river 45 miles.
The Roper River is a fine stream, navigable by fair sized ships for 90 to
100 miles from the mouth. A bar occurs at the entrance which has to be
treated with caution by vessels of deep draught.
The M'Arthur River is navigable for some distance for craft drawing six
or seven feel. The ss Palraei drawing lift, steamed up 12 miles. The
township of Borroloola is locat d about 49 miles up the river.
The Daly River, which is really an extension of the Katherine River, is
navigable for 70 to 80 miles for vessels drawing 6ft. It is very dangerous to
navigation in the wet season owing to the tremendous bodies of water that
flow into it from tributary streams inland.
The Adelaide River is navigable for short vessels of 200 or 300 tons for
50 miles up. Surveying ves.sel Beatrice, drawing 12ft, ascended 53 miles, (he
river there being 60 yds. wide. After the Narrow's, at the entrance, are
passed, navigation is safe and easy.
The East Alligator River is about four miles wide at the entrance. The
depths vary from 1-| fathoms at entrance to half a fathom at eight miles within,
whence it increases to three and four fathoms for six of seven miles farther
up. .
The South Alligator has a clear approach in nine to six fathoms. The en-
trance is four miles wide, and the river is navigable for fairly deep draught
vessels for some distance. At 17 miles from the entrance Capt. King found
six fathoms of water, and he explored the river for 36 miles, where it was 150
yards wide, carring 2\ fathoms.
