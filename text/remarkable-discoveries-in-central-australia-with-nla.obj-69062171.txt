REMARKABLE DISCOVERIES
CENTRAL AUSTRALIA,
[Read before the Royal Dahlia Society, Monday, March 18, 1861, and reprinted from the
Society?s Journal.]
A letter to otir secretary, Dr. Steele, from the Hon. John T. Bagot, Crown
Lands? Commissioner at Adelaide, and a corresponding member of this
Society, intimating the success of an expedition into the interior of Aus-
tralia, was received early in February; and the next Australian mail
brought the journal and map of route of the adventurous traveller, Mr.
JolmM'Douall Stuart, a native of Ulster?one of that self-denying and
philanthropic band, which enrols the names of Bruce, Cooke, Leichhardt,
Livingstone, and many others, who have conferred upon the British
Empire, and upon mankind through its instrumentality, benefits infi-
nitely more valuable than the triumphs of war; and the fruits of whose
labours generations to come are destined to reap, while the world lasts,
in the reproductive appropriation of regions, practically boundless in
extent, and exhaustless in resources. The superficial area of Australia
is scarcely one-fifth less than Europe; and of this two million square
miles, or nearly two-thirds of the whole, remained intact and unknown,
until Mr. Stuart planted the British flag in the centre of the continent.
The arrival of his journal, published, with an admirably written prefa-
tory article, in the ?South Australian Advertiser,? enables me to gratify
Mr. Bagot?s desire, in laying before the Society a brief sketch of the re-
sults of the expedition, with such reflections as have occurred to my mind,
while tracing the annals of previous discovery in those far-withdrawn and
hitherto unknown regions. My information is unavoidably incomplete; but
before our session of this year closes, an opportunity may happily occur
for laying before you more full and particular statements; for tidings
arrived this very day from Adelaide, that Stuart had started again on


New Year?s Day, with the determination to accomplish the transit to
the Gulf of Carpentaria during the Australian summer months; so that
we may fairly expect information of his success before the end of May.
He was furnished with twelve men, forty horses, and ample supplies,
by the Colonial Government. The expedition, which forms the subject
for consideration this evening, comprised only two men and thirteen
horses, and was fitted out at the cost of Messrs. James Chambers and
William Finite, wealthy Adelaide merchants, who, we trust, may live
to witness the legitimate results of their munificence and sagacity, in
the rapidly progressive prosperity of a colony, that boasts such public-
spirited citizens.
The longest and most remarkable exploratory journeys, previous to
Stuart?s, were those of Eyre, Leichhardt, Gregory, and Sturt. Eyre, in
1836-7, traversed the southern coast country from Port Lincoln to
King George?s Sound, and thence to Perth, on the Swan Elver, an in-
terval of more than twenty degrees of longitude; and along his whole
course did not cross the catchment basin of any considerable stream flow-
ing seaward. In 1844-5, the intrepid and enterprising Leichhardt
(whose fate is still a mystery, having never returned from a subsequent
expedition), penetrated in a N. W. direction from Moreton Bay to Port
Essington, a distance of some 1800 miles,?? a large proportion of which,
especially in the districts E. and S. E. of the Carpentarian Gulf, lay
through fertile, pastoral, and well-watered uplands. However, though
his track must have crossed almost within sight of Stuart?s furthest
north, the interval remained unexplored, and thus was left unsolved
the problem, that would have completed the supplement of the trans-
continental route.
Gregory?s exploring party, in 1856, travelled south, starting from
the vicinity of the Eiver Victoria in North Australia, until they attained
latitude 18� 31', longitude 130� 49', on the border of a sandy desert ex-
tending beyond the range of vision. They then turned westward, still
keeping this desert in view for 300 miles, until a series of depressions,
the saline beds of dried-up lakes, in latitude 20� 16', longitude 127� 35',
barred all further progress; and Gregory retraced his steps despondingly,
under the impression, that vast barren tracts in the interior formed an
impassable barrier between the northern coast and the great settle-
ments of Southern and Eastern Australia. However be it borne in
mind, that Gregory, in proceeding westward, turned his back on Stuart?s
subsequent route through a diversified but practicable country; while,
on the other hand, Stuart?s furthest north overlapped the southern limit
of the other by some score miles.
But a still more important expedition, in relation to our present sub-
ject, is that of Sturt in 1844-5, who started from the banks of the Dar-
ling, about five degrees to the eastward of Stuart?s starting point, with
the intention of reaching the Gulf of Carpentaria by a north-westerly
route; but having attained latitude 24� 30', longitude 138�, fear of the
approaching droughts, and the weakness of his party, compelled him to
return. We are accustomed to look for examples of valour to the battle-


field?of fortitude, to the unshaken resolve of the patriot; and find a
difficulty in realizing to imagination the courage, determination, aye
and philanthropic feelings too, that inspire the ardent votary of disco-
very in his perilous journeys by land or sea. Sturt thus describes,
with a noble and touching pathos, the disappointment of his just ambi-
tion:?? A veil hung over Central Australia, that could neither be
pierced nor raised. Men of undoubted energy and perseverance had
tried, in vain, to work their way to that shrouded spot?girt round
about by deserts, it almost appeared as if Nature had intentionally closed
it upon civilized man, that there might be at least one domain on the
Earth?s wide field, over which the savage might roam in freedom.
And to him, who had well nigh reached the topmost step of
the ladder, whose hand had all but grasped the pinnacle, how great
must be the necessity, how severe the struggle of feeling, that forces
him to bear back and abandon his task. a ? Again, how sincerely can
we sympathise with the mingled aspirations and regret of the lonely
sojourner, as prophetic anticipations of the success of some happier ex-
plorer cheer the weariness of hope deferred throughout the long un-
varied lapse of sunlight hours, or while the watches of the night pass
silently over his heavy eyelids in the wilderness. Such were, doubtless,
Sturt?s reflections, when he says? There may yet be that in the womb
of time which shall repay me for all I suffered in the performance of this
dreary task ?when I shall have it in my power to say, that I so far led
the way across the continent, as to make the remainder of comparatively
easy attainment; and, under the guidance and blessing of Providence,
have been mainly instrumental in establishing a line of communication
between its northern and southern coasts. I see no reason to despair
that such may one day be the case. b ?
Truly, the noble example of such a leader could not be fruitless; and
it may be that these very words furnished incentive to the subsequent
expedition; for one of the companions of Sturt in travel, his tried and
trusty friend in many a weary hour, was John M?Douall Stuart.
On the 2nd of March, 1860, Mr. Stuart started from Chambers?
Creek, situated on the outskirts of the settled districts, about 500 miles
N. W. from Adelaide, latitude 29� 30', longitude 137�. His journal is
brief, and barren in scientific details, or romantic incidents of flood and
field, the smallness of the party rendering it impossible to collect accu-
rate scientific information, or bring away many specimens of the natural
history of the districts through which he passed ; however, the geogra-
phical features of his route were carefully observed, and have been
delineated on charts; and the practicability of colonising the central
and intervening districts appears to be satisfactorily demonstrated by
the fact, that during the entire transit across eleven degrees of latitude
there was danger only on a single occasion from want ot water, and that
during one short interval of sixty miles.

the hill ranges, which seldom exceeded 1000 feet in elevation, usually
consisted of granite, gneiss, hematite, and quartz. Yolcanoes there were
none, though traces of ancient igneous action were not unfrequent; and
in one locality only, latitude 22� 33', longitude 133�, did he discover
any indication of a valuable mineral deposit?copper ores, superficially
shown, and in considerable quantity.
Many new plants and birds were observed, and several curious va-
rieties of the gum-tree, in all their evergreen, or rather never-green
luxuriance; for the Australian Flora in but few instances displays the
verdurous tints of our ever-green foliage?the leaf colour of the �biqui-
tous gum-tree especially exhibiting what one might call a dundukuddy-
mud-colour green. Mr. Stuart notes among the grasses a species, which
he designates -wild oats, four feet in height, and others bearing a marked
similitude to wheat and rye. It would be strange, indeed, if the mys-
tery of the origin of the cereals was destined to be solved in this region
of so many anomalies, both in its flora and fauna. A singular and beau-
tiful tree, conjectured by Mr. Bagot to be the Baobab, is, I rather think,
that species of Capparis, described and figured by Grey in his tour
through N. W. Australia*. The Baobab (or rather Bahobab, Adansonia
digitate), is only met with in a limited district in Western Africa.
The hill ranges, mounts, creeks, and springs, Mr. Stuart has named
after distinguished travellers, colonial statesmen, and eminent merchants
of Adelaide, thus discreetly exercising (I venture to affirm) the privilege
of discovery, in preferring to immortalise his friends and Australian No-
tabilities, than in retaining native designations for sake of euphony (as
some have deprecatingly urged), where not a trace of derivative or tra-
ditionary interest attaches. And, truly, the euphony is very problema-
tical. There is no accounting for tastes; but Higgledy-piggledy, to my
ear, sounds just as musical as Munducki, or Hullabaloo as Burraburra.
On the 22nd of April Mr. Stuart camped in the centre of Australia,
and built a cone of stones upon the summit of a hill in the immediate
vicinity, which he named Central Mount Stuart. On the top of the
cone he placed a small bottle, with a slip of paper therein, noting names
and date, and planted the British ensign in the centre. Then, having
given three hearty cheers for
? The flag that braved a thousand years
The battle and the breeze,?
our travellers resumed their route, still keeping a N. W. direction, until
on 26th June they reached latitude 18� 57", longitude 134�; when,
while Stuart was examining the country from the summit of a hill, in
expectation of discovering some clue to a watershed towards the Gulf
of Carpentaria, he was attacked by a large party of natives with great
fury and determination. These were fired upon, and completely routed;
but Stuart deemed it imprudent to attempt a further advance in the face
of such fearful odds, and retraced his steps to Chambers? Creek, which
he reached in safety on the 3rd of September, after an absence of ex-

actly six months on his perilous enterprise,?having travelled, allowing
for circuitous direction and the various angular detours from the main
track, little short of 2000 miles, or about eleven miles per day.
The incident of the attack I give in his own words: ?
? Tuesday, June 26.?Large gum creek, with sheets of water. I
have resolved to follow this creek down to-day, and if water continues,
to follow it out; so started on a course 77�, and at six miles crossed the
creek, it running a little more to the north; long sheets of water all the
way down to the hanks; at some places are steep. The lower part
formed concrete; the upper part is sandy soil, which gives me a bad
opinion of it for water if the concrete ceases. Here we saw some blacks;
they would not come near us, hut walked off as fast as they could.
From the top of the rise we saw where they camped, which was on the
banks of large sheets of water; we passed them without taking any no-
tice, and at nine miles, not seeing any appearance of the creek, changed
my course to 25�. At three-quarters of a mile cut it again, hut with no
water in it; it is much narrower and deeper, having sandy banks and
sandy bed, with gum-trees growing in the bottom. Changed again to
77�, frequently crossing the course, and at fifteen miles saw there was
no hope of obtaining water. The country is becoming more sandy, with
spinifex and thick scrub, down to the banks of the creek. I must keep
close to the hills, and as the day has been very hot, I shall return and
camp at nine miles from our last camp, if there is water; if there is not,
I shall have to camp a short way above where we saw the natives this
morning. Ido not wish to get too near them, nor amongst them in any
way. We could find no water below where they were camped; I there-
fore pushed on to get above them before dark. At about 1 o?clock,
thirty miles from the creek, we saw where they had been examining our
tracks; and as we approached the creek their tracks became more nu-
merous on ours. When we arrived on the top of the rise, from where
we had previously seen their fires, we now saw neither smoke, fires, nor
anything else, it being nearly dark. I concluded they had left in conse-
quence of having seen us pass in the morning. I was moving on to the
place where we crossed the creek in the morning, and had just entered
some scrub, when suddenly up started three tall, powerful men, fully
armed, having a number of boomerangs, waddies, and spears; their dis-
tance from us being about 200 yards; it being also near dark, and the
scrub we were then in being very disadvantageous for us, I wished to pass
them without taking any notice of them; but such was not their in-
tention, as they continued to approach us, calling out, and making all
sorts of gestures, apparently of defiance. I then faced them, making
all sorts of signs of friendship I could think of. They seemed to be in
a great fury, moving their boomerangs about their heads, and howling
to the top of their voices, also performing some sort of dance. They
were now joined by a number more, which in a few minutes increased
to upwards of thirty?every bush seemed to produce a man. Putting
the horses on towards the creek, and placing ourselves between them
and the natives, I told the men to get their guns ready, for I could sec


they were determined upon mischief. They paid no regard to all the
signs of friendship I kept constantly making, but were still gradually
approaching nearer. I felt very unwilling to fire upon them, and con-
tinued making signs of peace and friendship, but all to no purpose.
An old man (the leader), who was in advance, made signs with his
boomerang for us to be off, which proved to be one of defiance ; for I
had no sooner turned my horse?s head to see if that was what they wished,
than we received a shower of boomerangs, accompanied by a fearfull yell;
they then commenced jumping, dancing, yelling, and showing their
arms in all sorts of postures, like so many fiends, and setting fire to the
grass. I could now see many others getting up from behind the bushes.
Still I felt unwilling to fire upon them, and tried to make them under-
stand that we wished to do them no harm; they now came within forty
yards of us, and again made a charge, throwing their boomerangs, which
came whistling and whizzing past our ears. One spear struck my horse.
I then gave orders to fire, which stayed their mad career for a little.
Our pack-horses, which were before us, took fright when they heard the
firing and fearful yelling, and made off for the creek. Seeing the blacks
running from bush to bush, with the intention of cutting us off from
them, while those in front were still yelling, throwing their boomerangs,
and coming nearer to us, gave them another reception, and sent Ben
after the horses, to drive them to a more favourable place, while Keck-
wick and I remained to cover our rear. We soon got in advance of our
enemies, but they still kept following, beyond the reach of our guns;
the fearful yelling continuing, and fires springing in every direction;
and it being now quite dark, with the country scrubby and our enemies
numerous, bold, and daring, we could easily be surrounded and destroyed
by such determined fellows as they have shown themselves to be. See-
ing there was no chance with such fearful odds against us (ten to one),
and knowing the disadvantages under which we laboured, I very unwil-
lingly made up my mind to push on to last night?s camp, which we did.
I have considered the matter over, and I do not think it prudent to re-
main here to-night; I shall therefore continue my journey until reach-
ing the open grassy plain on Gum Creek. They still keep following us.
I only wish I had four other men; my party being so small, we can only
fall back, and act on the defensive. If I were to stand, and fight them,
our horses must remain unprotected, and we, in all probability, cut off
from them, which they seem to be aiming at, and prevent our advance
up the creek; by this time they must know that we do not care for
them. Arrived at Hayward?s Creek at 11 o?clock.
?Wednesday, June 27.?Hayward?s Creek. Last night it was my
intention to have gone this morning to Keckwick?s Ponds to water the
horses, given them this day to rest, and to have proceeded the next day
back to the large creek, and go on to the distant hills that I was steer-
ing for on the 25th instant; but after considering the matter over, I have
most reluctantly come to the determination of abandoning the attempt
to make the Gulf of Carpentaria, as being most imprudent, situated as
I am, and my party being too small to cope with such wily, determined


natives as those we have just encountered. Their arrangements and
manner of attack were as well conducted and planned as Europeans
could do it. They observed us passing in the morning, and examined
our traces to see which way we had gone; knew we could get no water
down the creek, and must return to get it, so thus must have planned
their attack. Their charge was in double column, open order, and we
had to take steady aim to make an impression. 'With such as these for
enemies, it would he destruction to all my party for me to attempt to
go on, and all the information of the interior that I have already ob-
tained would be lost, having only half rations for six months (four of
which are already gone), and my men complaining of weakness from
short rations, and unable to perform what they ought to do, and my
health being so bad that I am scarcely able to sit in the saddle the
whole day. After considering all these obstacles, I think it would be
madness and folly to attempt and risk more. If my own life would be
the only sacrifice, I would willingly give it to accomplish the end I aimed
at, but it seems lam not to attain it. Man proposes, but God disposes;
and His will must bo obeyed.?
The difficulties of travel in the interior may be enumerated under
four heads?drought; opposition of the Blacks; impracticable nature of
scrub; and want of vegetable food. The two last mentioned can scarcely
be deemed serious obstacles to a well-organised expedition, with time
and plentiful resources at disposal. A sufficiency of preserved vegeta-
bles and fresh meats, preventive of scurvy, may be easily supplied; and
a more careful examination, and discriminative appropriation of na-
tive vegetable productions would doubtless be found of service. The
memong, or native parsnip, also a kind of cucumber, and sundry other
plants, some entirely new, are enumerated as agreeable and nutritious;
and a plant of the Arum family, found at Neale?s Creek in great quan-
tities, is described as a most grateful remedy. The Eucalyptus dumosus,
or wild tea-tree, might perhaps be added to the list; and the fruit,
seeds, and inspissated sap of several trees, especially of the gouty-stem
tree, a species of capparis, which is almost as useful to the Australian
natives as the palm to the South Sea Islander.
The scrub, consisting principally of mulga, acacias, spinifex, and the
haka, or saltbush, was found very troublesome to the travellers, tearing
their clothes, provision bags, leather trunks, and cattle harness, and
impeding their horses, who with difficulty were often forced to face it.
The Australian scrub, however, presents no impediment at all compar-
able to the density and thorny armour of the Indian jungles; and, as
the soil always becomes firmer, and grass springs up wherever the scrub
is observed to be withering and disappearing, Nature herself by this
ameliorative process suggests the easiest mode of overcoming the ob-
stacle, and at the same time reclaiming the soil; i, e. by burning the scrub.
The systematic introduction also of the camel, as the carrier through
these tangled wastes, would obviate many difficulties?the endurance
of drought, broad-cushioned feet upon the incoherent sands, and lofty
stature, sustaining its burden above the dwarfed foliage, would render


the employment of that animal an invaluable aid to Australian explora-
tion.
Scarcity of water has hitherto proved the chief hindrance to attain-
ing a knowledge of the interior, the peculiar physical features in refe-
rence to this subject being the general absence of true fluvial waters,
or rivers disemboguing into the sea; the impermanency of surface water
after the rains; infrequent appearance of wells or springs ; and the oc-
currence of creeks (occasionally saline), as the disappearing streams of
the interior are oddly designated by the colonists. Captain Sturt was
of opinion, that the elevated ranges of Australia constituted the island
summits of a vast archipelago in some previous geological era, and the
gradual elevation of the entire area, and subsequent evaporation of the
sea-water left behind in what had been bays and channels, formed those
saline depressions and absorbent sands that swallow up the creek
water, and in some parts bar all ingress into the interior.
It is of the utmost importance to ascertain how far this obstacle?
the scarcity of potable water ?is capable of being diminished or over-
come. Mitchell, a most intelligent traveller, says of the Bogan in Hew
South Wales (a deep, wide, and rapid river in the rainy season, dwindled
to a series of shallow pools, far apart in the droughts) that a single
dam of simple and economical construction would retain the water for
several miles. How, here is one obvious remedy, applicable to many of
the creeks as well as rivers; and it may be that the floods could thus be
economically stored in the unsightly summer bed of the Torrens itself,
with divers and considerable beneficial results to the inhabitants of
Adelaide and its suburban districts ; and by such a construction also, as
would effectually obviate the dangers of occasional heavy and sudden
rain-falls. The settlers in the trans-Alpine pastoral tracts of Hew South
Wales have of late years been making clumsy attempts to arrest the
rain supplies by reservoirs of various descriptions, for preservation of
their cattle in occasional droughts. But these ought to assume the mag-
nitude of public engineering works, as we hope soon to witness more
extensively in the great peninsula of India, where even the restoration
of the tanks constructed by races far inferior to us in civilization, and
which have lain in ruins for several centuries, would restore its pristine
fertility to many an impoverished district, and tend to secure on a sound
basis both Indian revenue and Imperial ascendancy?for the yoke of a
master, who expends income in employing reproductive labour at fairly
remunerative wages, is always light a .
a Irrigation?not only by immense works of canalization, such as Alexander the Great
beheld with wonder in Babylonia, or as we now witness in China, but also by storing the
seasonal rains, and turning to economic account the continuous small contributions of
rivulets, fountains, and springs?was remarkably exemplified in the primitive civiliza-
tion of both hemispheres; but, under the exterminating influences of conquest and
national decay, the lesson fell gradually into disuse and oblivion ; and the once fertile
champaigns of Mesopotamia, Peru, and many other climes of East and West, are now
arid and treeless deserts. ?See Porter?s ? Five Years in Damascus and Bowen?s ? Peru?
in ? Vacation Tourists,? 1860.


In some districts the quantity of rain-fall nearly equals the tropical
monsoons. Strzelecki observed on one occasion at Sydney, and that
not specially remarkable, a fall of 25 inches in the twenty-four hours.
In the tracts traversed by Stuart, however, no portion of the rain is
carried seaward, ?all the water being gathered in isolated basins, or
within the catchment of creeks, or percolating through the sandy soil into
the natural reservoirs of the substrata. How, may not these buried
stores be made in many instances easily and cheaply available, by
means of careful observation, aided by a little applied knowledge of
practical geology ? Stuart?s journal ot April 22nd, when he stood a
triumphant discoverer in the centre of the continent, states, that being
in want of water, he procured it ?by scratching in the sand;? and in
most cases the wells or rather natural springs resorted to by the natives,
indicated plentiful supply at greater depths. Ido not mean to recom-
mend the expensive process of boring Artesian wells, as practised by the
French in Algerian deserts; but a comparatively shallow screen of arid
surface is frequently found to preserve, as well as to conceal, an inex-
haustible reservoir of supply; and such disclosure too might be made
a more potent means of conciliating the jealous aboriginal tribes, than any
other expedient whatsoever. I may here introduce, in illustration, an
example, far distant indeed in time, but not far-fetched in appropriate-
ness. The desert tracts, east of Zaelc, in Syria, constituted in the era
of the earlier Roman Emperors the principal granary for growth of
corn, for consumption not only of their own then abundant population,
but also of the teeming millions in the kingdoms or pro-consulates of
Judea and Western Syria; but the chief source of this extraordinary pro-
ductiveness was the substratal water drawn from wells; and, though
now the district is a barren wilderness, yet the very same source of fer-
tility is there, inviting the investment of industry. Water is every-
where found, at a depth varying from five to twelve feet. Rurckhardt
and other later travellers attest this fact; and the late James Silk Buck-
ingham assured me of the same, not only in this district, but in other
Oriental deserts. The impermanency therefore of surface water only
implies, that it will be found beneath, sometimes with little labour, and
often in unexpected quantity.
Again, the occurrence of occasional waterless wastes does not neces-
sitate the total abandonment of colonizing schemes. Sturt, Leich-
hardt, and Stuart, all traversed many districts of great extent and
fertility, abounding in springs and streams; and such, even though
separated by intervening desert spaces, might form a chain of oases
from Adelaide to the Carpentarian Gull?certainly a novel, but by no
means an improbable condition of colonization*.
Two incidental proofs, curiously confirmatory of the existence of
habitable central regions, may be here mentioned. Ist. The migration
? Had Stuart?s Expedition included a dozen families, with their domiciliary stuff and
cattle and sufficient grain to overlap a second harvest, the immediate initiation of a
prosperous colony, in many of the interior districts tiaversed, might ha\e been accom-
plished without difficulty.


of birds in countless numbers to the N.AV. from the country north of
Lake Torrens. 2nd. That the tribes at opposite points of the coast bear
closer resemblance to each other in physical characteristics and customs,
than to those tribes separated from them by wide intervals of shoreward
deserts; plainly intimating the fact of frequented lines of communica-
tion through the central country. It is suggestive also of the same fact,
with what rapidity any scrap of news?a wreck, or a traveller?s visit ?
is conveyed to opposite points of the coast, from tribe to tribe of the
scattered nomadic population.
But in this, as in other analogous instances of exploratory enter-
prises, hostility of the natives will probably be found the most embar-
rassing obstacle to forming the nucleus of any settlement. The Abori-
gines are a branch of the Papuans, or Oriental Negroes, and the most
degraded of that savage race. The partial civilization held by their
progenitors, and from which these untaught children of the wilderness
gradually lapsed, must have been very remote; for they have no idea of
a Supreme Being; no memorials, nor rude sculptures; no tradition, nor
traditionary rites; with perhaps one exception, the practice of circumci-
sion by a few of the tribes, and with them indeed a very curious, though
u nmeanmg custom j for no significance is ascribed to it, and it is per-
formed with such injudicious severity, as to impair, and sometimes
altogether destroy the generative vigour?. Naked and houseless, their
existence is a perpetual struggle with the powers of unsubjected nature;
the use of fire seems almost the only indication of intelligence with the
most degraded, though a few of the tribes exhibit a somewhat superior
physical and mental development. Stuart relates, with comic serious-
ness, one amusing instance of supposed native intelligence ?
? Saturday, June 23.?Keckwick?s Ponds. Besting horses. About
10 o?clock were visited by two natives, who presented us with four
opossums and a number of small parrots. They were much frightened
at first, but after a short time became very bold, and wished to steal
everything they could lay their fingers on. I caught one concealing the
rasp used in shoeing horses under the netting he had round his waist,
and was obliged to take it from him by force. The canteens they seemed
determined to have, and it was with trouble we could keep them away.
They wanted to pry into everything, and it was with difficulty we could
keep them off. In about half an hour two other young men approached
the camp. Thinking they might be in want of water, and afraid
to come to it on account of the horses, I sent Ben with a tin-dishful,
which they drank. They were very young men, and much frightened,
and would not come near. About an hour before sundown the first that
came returned, bringing with them three others. Two were powerful,
tall, good-looking young men, and as fine ones as I have yet seen.
They had a hat or helmet on their heads, which looked very neat?fitted
close to the brow, rising straight up to a rounded peak, three or four
inches above the head, and gradually narrower towards the back part.
The outside is net-work; the inside is composed of feathers, very tightly

bound with cord until it is as hard as a piece of wood. It may be used
as a protection against the sun, or armour for the battle-field. One of
them had a great many scars upon him, and seemed to be a leading man.
Two only had helmets on; the others had pieces of netting bound round
their foreheads. One was an old man, and seemed to be the father of
the two young men. He was very talkative, but I could make nothing
of him. I endeavoured to obtain from him where the next water is by
signs, and so on. After talking some time, and he talking to his sons, he
turned round and astonished me by giving me a masonic sign. I looked
at him steadily. He repeated it, as did also his two sons. I returned
it, which seemed to please them much. The old man then patted me on
the shoulder, stroked my head, and all took their departure, making
friendly signs, till out of sight.?
How I should guess, that some runaway convict, or profane wag of
a sailor (and profane he assuredly was, to disclose the secret symbol)
had taught this mimetic savage the signs of masonic recognition. There
is no doubt indeed, that throughout the Oriental world there exist frag-
mentary indications of a mystic science of immemorial antiquity, more or
less cognate to what we designate Freemasonry; but the mysticism of the
Buddhist, or Parsec, would be utterly incommunicable to the understand-
ing of a Papuan. At all events, in this instance the ostentation of the
fraternal sign proved to be, as sometimes found among civilised Masons,
a delusion and a snare; for only two days after the occurrence Stuart was
attacked by a party, evidently well acquainted with his movements and
resources, and forced to return without accomplishing his object of reach-
ing the Gulf of Carpentaria.
Besides the higher regard of Christian obligation, the Aborigines
must be viewed in the conventional aspect of British subjects,
and as such entitled to protection; and I believe the Colonial Go-
vernment and Police to be sincere in their desire to protect them.
The Colonial blue-books attest but few instances of their cruel treat-
ment, and these principally among the outlying settlers, the noma-
dic pioneers of colonization; who urge, in extenuation, series upon
series of vexatious injuries, aggravated only by patient forbearance, and
issuing at length in the wild justice of revengeful retaliation against the
black fellows. The physical advantages of civilization, evidenced by
the increasing comforts of the settlers, sometimes attract the adult
savage to resign his roving habits, wear clothing, .labour for hire, and
dwell in a permanent habitation; but any extensive results in the change
of moral character can only be expected from education of the young,
in which lies the special mission of the Missionary and Evangelist. The
gradual extinction of barbarous races dwelling in the proximity of civi-
lization, like the process of eremacausis in the chemistry of nature?
a wasting away without perceptible contact with any destroying
agent?is a subject of sad but unavailing reflection 11 ; for surely it is
a New Zealand presents one of the very few instances of a savage population not only
surviving, but being reclaimed and improved by, the contact of the white man. But

only an irrational and sickly sentimentalism, that would plead for the
arrest of colonization, in order that the savage should roam in freedom
unrestrained over the wide uncultured savanna, or through the tangled
mazes of primeval forests, feeding, like the omnivorous Australian, upon
the flesh of kangaroos and wombats?when these fail, upon roots,
grabs, and reptiles; and at last, in failure of these, or of water, pe-
rishing from sheer inanition, with a productive soil beneath his feet,
and a salubrious heaven above. Now they alone can be said truly to
possess the earth, who subdue it, pouring freely forth, as blood, the
sweat of toil in the conflict: and thus applied labour in these neglected
and unappropriated regions is providentially constituted the especial
condition of ownership. That condition, once exhibited in its industrial
realization for an example to barbarous tribes, establishes their respon-
sibility ; and if they despise the tenure of industry, and refuse to fall
into the ranks of progress, they perish under the reflex action (so to
speak) of the Divine injunction impressed upon the physical destiny of the
human race (Genesis i. 28).
The lesson to be gleaned from Stuart?s narrative, for instruction of
future explorers in communication with the natives, is plain and im-
portant, in order to insure the success of discovery, and avoid the sacri-
fice of life. Fear alone is potent to overawe the suspicions and impulsive
nature of those who cannot even comprehend, much less appreciate
moral motives. They should be treated with justice, but with caution
and reserve, never permitted to enter the camp; and any act of violence
should receive summary and severe punishment.
It is a disheartening circumstance, that colonization has hitherto so
disastrously failed in Northern Australia; yet it is hard to believe that
Port Essington would have proved, under enlightened sanitary manage-
ment, a less endurable climate than our settlements in ?Western Africa,
or even than the city of palaces on the Ganges; but a northern settle-
ment cannot be deemed a hopeless speculation, while the border lands
of the Carpentarian Gulf remain in great part unexplored. Its geogra-
phical position, stretching far and wide into the continent, suggests the
probability of its affording the chief outlet for drainage of the interior;
and Leichhardt?s journals, as before stated, attest the occurrence of ex-
tensive and well-watered pastoral uplands E. and S.E, of the gulf, with
indications of a seaward water-shed. The vast arms of this gulf seem to
invite to their embrace the commerce of Asia and the Oriental Archipe-
lagos. The Dutch, Malayan, and Chinese traders regularly visit its
shores for tortoise-shell, trepang, nacre, and other littoral products; and
if once a safe portage and desirable site for a colony were fixed on, the
elements of an extensive traffic would soon be developed; and the jealous
exclusiveness of the Batavian Government, as well as the barbarous pre-
judices of the numerous insular populations between Australia and Sin-
gapore, would yield by degrees to the pressure of mutual wants and
advantages.
velopment to the Papuans of Australia. The contrast is more distinctly seen in contem-
plation of the fact, that the Tasmanian Papuans have totally disappeared, notwithstanding
the diligent care to preserve the remnant of that miserable race.


Part of Northern and the whole of North-Eastern Australia, besides
affording cattle pasturages and cereal lands of vast extent in the upland
districts, possess also in the champaign-coast territory a soil and climate
peculiarly suitable for the production of cotton and sugar, comprehend-
ing an area at least thrice the extent of the seceding section of the great
American Republic. It would be incompatible with the scope of this
short paper to enter upon the consideration of comparative statistics; but
whoever will take the trouble of tracing the rapid progress to prosperity
of the Australian wool market will not be disinclined to admit the likeli-
hood of successful cotton speculations in the new colony of Queensland 0 ,
as soon as an adequate importation of free labour warrants investment
of capital; while, on the other hand, the colony of South Australia is
more suitable for the culture of cereals and the vine.
Among the more immediate beneficial results of a habitable interior,
would be the facility afforded for transit of horses, and other live stock,
from the southern coasts to the Gulf of Carpentaria, for exportation to
India, thus avoiding the dangerous, circuitous, and expensive sea pas-
sage. And there appears even now no obstacle of any importance to
the erection of a telegraph from Adelaide to the Gulf, in order to faci-
litate communication with the parent country, and give renewed impetus
to the prosperous progress of Victoria and South Australia?the most
distant, yet not the least flourishing settlements of England?s outer
Empire. Certainly the obstacles, whether in respect to time, expense,
or danger, are small in comparison with those experienced by our
fellow-countryman, Sir William O?Shaughnessy, in connecting by the
electric wire all the great capitals of India.
A few words in conclusion will not be inappropriate, as respects the
general subject of colonization. This distributive agency, which appears
to be the special mission of England, is now the most active power and pe-
culiar characteristic of the world?s progress, and constitutes the material
basis of that moral strength, potent and instant in every region of the ha-
bitable sphere, to overawe tyranny, protect the weak, cherish the first
awakening of popular freedom, and disseminate just principles of reli-
gious truth and public equity. In whatever corner of the globe the
emigrant plants the standard of fatherland, England is in due process
of time reproduced, by the impress of identity in intellectual and social
character and municipal institutions; and this remark is more distinc-
tively applicable to the Australian colonies, in consequence of their more
unmixed British population.
In the last paper which I had the honour to read before this
Society, commenting on the barren results of Polar research, I ob-
served that ? there are many extensive fertile regions in habitable
climes as yet unexplored, save in isolated spots upon their boundaries,
and that these presented the legitimate domain of discovery.? Now, I
a The reader will find in Lang?s ? Queensland? (Stanford, London, 1861), a fund of
varied and most valuable information respecting this new colony.
The great interspace, bounded by the proposed western limit of Queensland, and by the
interior boundary of Western Australia, I have ventured to designate Carpentaria, as a
suggested new colony, having its capital on some one of the rivers on the western arm of
the gulf, in a more central position than Port Essington.?See Map.


can happily substantiate the statement, by adducing the instance of this
vast region, comprising so large a portion of the globe, Australia, the
scantiest of all lands in natural productions suitable to the wants and
habits of civilized man, is notwithstanding the most manageable, the most
prolific?in a word, the most utilitarian in its adaptability for introduced
products. The domesticated animals, the food plants, the textile and dye
plants, fruits, grasses, tea, tobacco, the sugar-cane, the mulberry, and the
vine?the productions of all climates flourish in Australia; and there
also is the supplement of a complete prosperity, in the three remaining
requisites, of unlimited space, general salubrity, and exclusive owner-
ship, in a continent removed by the breadth of a hemisphere from the
conflicts and perils of all the other nations of the earth. No hostile ship
has ever entered the roadstead of Port Philip. There are no heights of
Abraham frowning above the broad thoroughfares of Sydney, a district
covered with houses, where within the memory of living men was seen
only the perishable hut of the wandering savage. What shall be the
future of Australia, at this rate of progress, is rather the province of an
ardent imagination to picture, than of statistical science to calculate.
Sure am I, that were the united empire of the British Islands destined
to be blotted from the map of Europe by the ruthless arm of conquest,
or the more gradual sap of national decay, Australia would arise, an
antipodal England, to transmit, entire and untarnished, her religion and
institutions?the same banner of liberty would be unfurled beneath the
Southern Cross as now beneath the Polar Star; and the inscript on that
banner might well be, in memory of ancestorial glory, that motto, which
the Royal Dublin Society has so long worn, and so justly earned?
