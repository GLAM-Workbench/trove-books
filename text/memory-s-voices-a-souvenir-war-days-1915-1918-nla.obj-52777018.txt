May Kidson’s “Memory’s Voices.”
RAY KIDSON’S, war poems, which have just been pub-
lished by Messrs. Gordon and Gotch in booklet form,
at the modest price of a shilling each, are penetrated
with the tin me of patriotism, and are dedicated to the
memory of her youngest Anzac son, Platoon-Sergeant
Edric Doyle Kidson, of the 12th Battalion of the
immortal 3rd Brigade, who fell at the head of his men,
in a post of danger and honour, leading a screening
party, by order of the late Captain Lalor, on the heights at noon, after
the famous landing at dawn on Anzac Day; that marvellous pitiless dyy,
truly described by the late General Sjr Stanley Maude (the conqueror of
Bagdad), as the “most stupendous teat in history.”
It is given to poets to scale the heights and sound the opposing
depths! Mrs. Kidson’s poems are an epitome of Australian dare-devil
bravery and have been no small incitement in West Australia to recruiting,
5,000 copies of her Anzac leaflets having been distributed by the Re-
cruiting Committee.
But her poems are mainly addressed to the women of Australia, who
have given up their dearest, and, like Roman matrons of, old, sent them
forth to the fray, to fight for the freedom of the world. To those wives
and mothers whose lot is perhaps the hardest of all to bear, in that they
are doomed to the torment of inaction, to grit their tqeth and sit and
wait in silent endurance, for the sunny-eyed lads, who, may never return
to the longing arms of wife, or the mother who bore them. May Kidson
does not reveal much of the dreadful side of war. She does not. with
the morbidity of the ultra realist, revel and gloat on its horrors, but
from the depths of her own loss and pain, she sounds a message of faith
and comfort for yearning hearts. She bids the bereaved look forward to
that assuaging monient of meeting Hereafter, when Time is not and there
shall be no more tears.
Shelley tells ns, poets learn in suffering what they, teach in song;
as I have said elsewhere of May Kidson, with brave brown eyes, whose
fires no tears can quench, and the idealism of the poet’s vision,
looks forth into the world for other mothers to comfort, and has drawn
on those splendid reserves one glimpses under her cheery exterior, and
gone on with her appointed task in this work-a-day world. Who was
it said, “Let who will write the history of a nation, if I may write its
songs!”
For the expression of his garnered human emotions, the soldier pre-
fers the simple voice of nature, the flutings of the woodland songster,
to all the brilliant orchestration of epic symphonies. The songs which
inspire him to deathless deeds of heroism, turn on simple themes; they
are full of tender loving thoughts of home and mother, sweetheart, wife
and child. Often he disguises his feelings, wrought to the highest pitch
endurable, under a strain of flippant ironic realism.
On these strings May Kidson plays, and she can, moreover, strike
the chord of dramatic realism, as in her poem on the famous charge of
our 10th Light Horse at Gallipoli, August 29th, 1915, addressed to her
older son, Troop-Sergeant Noel Doyle Kidson, a .participator. Note the
breathless hurrying beat of its descriptive metre: —
Heard ye of the Light Horsemen Silently, with bated breath,
Winuin’ glory once again Each man steeled to light till death,
By Aegean waters? Any danger scornin’.
On the 29th’s dim dawn — Bay’nets, bombs, and sandbags too,
August ’twas that breakin’ morn Helter, skelter, peltin’ thro’ ,
Of red fields of slaughter. Ere sun topped the moruin ’.
Then a trench was held and lost,
Countless men had paid the cost,
Many had to rue it—
Now the darin’ Light Horsemen
Had to take it back again—
Bet yer life we HO it!
and in “Wimmin,” the story of the deeds of an Anzac boy, nursed back
to love and life, by his devoted army nurse, and afterwards sweetheart:
For wimiu be the wonder of creation,
They draws yer as the sea the tricklin’ stream,
They gives yer jest the nightmare and the doldrums,
Or soothes the like the sweetness of a dream.
But hero I’m a stoppin’, ruminatin’,
When all the best to be is yet to come;
As ’ow the devilish Germans' sprang the wartrap
And any man a.man must fight for ’omc. *
So see me now in khaki with me stripes too;
They passed mo out on the eddicationtest;
But I won ’em in the scrimmage o’ the fightin’,
When I see’d red and luck it done the rest.
An Appreciation
By Eva Bright
In the “Empire’s Appeal” (the last man may count) we can plainly
hear the tramp, tramp of marching feet:
Hearts responsive, loyal leal, Well you call your land—the free
Hoar an Empire s grand appeal! Use your right of Liberty
Let recruiting numbers mount! So that swelling numbers mount'
Prove free manhood still shall give— Give your heart and give vour hand
Show it has a right to live To your Country—Motherland—
When “the LAST MAN now may When “the LAST MAN now may
Count. Count. ’ ’
Give! Give! lest the”foe shall say,
Australia shirks her greatest day
'* And no swelling numbers mount —
Are you friend? or are you foe?
* Free to stay and loath to go,
When “the LAST MAN now mav
Count.”
In the author’s “Spirit Children” we have the expression of the mag-
netism and splendour of a mother’s love, chastened and etherealised by
suffering:—
0 God! to think that no child of thine Seeing thy sunny love for all*
Shall ever nestle on my knee— How children clustered for thv kiss
No living memory of thee Sweet there I glimpsed a'tender bliss’.
About my yearning heart entwine. Not recking how the shadows fall.
God! God, to think in vision fair O God! the carnage of the hour—
I’ve seen the sturdy, splendid brood, The souls unborn deprived of days—
In blue-eyed, gold-locked babyhood— And then iny heart went out in praise
Ive seen their unborn faces there. That mine was once that human flower.
When twUight dusks the land and sea, And ne’er I think of thee as gone
Or hye coals glow in wintry eve, /\But only just passed on before,
Closely those spirit-children. by that open door,
Lu\e legacies bequeathed to me. Love eternal still livgs on.
In My Hero, we feel the poignant pain of loss mingled with .a
Spartan pride, which lifts the poem into the. region of drama, and it
appeals to me personally as the writer’s finest poem. I quote the two last
verses; —
< “How oft wo planned our laughing days together
In our own breezy Swan in the sailing weather
(We little recked our sailing days were past)
But, dear, my Ship of Life is steered by thee,
1 feel thy tender eyes are watching lII*.
I’m proud we nailed our colours to the mast.
1 do not know, my* Hero, how you died,
They tell me ’twas beside tbc daisies pied
And that red poppies kissed your brow
(Ah! God, 1 envy them that last caress—
Oh! that my hands you loved had soothed to bless)
Hying alone —my Hero—thou!
In strength and power the “Mother’s Flower” approaches “My Hero
m pathos, though it is pitched in a lower key.' I cull the (to me) most
effective verse, with its vivid subconscious nature-touches, descriptive of
flowers and colour; —
Aglow the blazing poppy <«swp of red
Would pillow painlessly his sunny head,
. And the moon daisy, strong and white and pure,
And a llow’r blooming an immortal blue
That seemed to hold the peace of Heaven’s hue
lor his own crossing to that other shore—
The red, the white, the blue his oriflamme,
In our heart's battlefield the flower of his name,
May Kidson’s effectiveness lies largely in her absolute sincerity, her
tesli, unsullied spontaneity, which greet one everywhere as in “The
Mother s Battalion, which rings with a clarion note. And in the “After-
word” we seem to hear the solemn the “Last Post” as it circled
through the Cathedral on Anzac Day, its call to sublime joy and resigna-
tion, through the surge of sighs breaking from aching hearts.
AFTERWORD.
And then, mayhap, or now, past time or space,
to hearts athirst, a soul on higher service shall
vj eii whisper tender healing, and across
The Wireless of Thought that girdles all—
That thro’ the awful surge of yearning days
God s ways are well—and homing love shall bridge
Hie Silences—and Life and Heath are—One
. . And anguished hearts when Peace-bells joy again
And syrens shrill their long exultant blast,
And longing memory cries and will be heard,
I l .™ “ ear hls voice and by that Font of Tears
With brave proud smile stand-at salute, and let
Hie halo of his love shine thro ’ —until
Another dawn shall break aii shadows flee.

WISTISH WOMII.


In a supplement to this second edition Mrs. Kidson, in lighter vein,
gives us a" gorgeous pageant of flowers, fancifully ranked as an army
in “When Flowers Called. 1 ’ It is an enchanting mosaic of fairy blossom,
steeped in the vibrant, pulsating sunshine of the bush, shedding a bene-
diction of its aromatic ambrosial scents upon us, it is a “tour de force”
indeed, crystal clear in meaning, perfect in its rythm and the haunting lilt
of its double rhymes. A very competent critic has termed this poem
“An Australian classic for all time.” Truly it carries a message from the
bush to our brave Australian boys in the trenches. It is difficult to
choose gmid such a bouquet of beauties, but I will quote the first four
verses as indicating the characteristic scheme of the poem:—
WHEN FLOWERS' CALLED.
Hark! the hours call September! and
whisper low ‘ ‘Remember
The pageant of the. flowers draweth
near! ’ ’
Secrets whisper of the birth of those
children of the earth
That every list’ning mortal too may
hear.
Where floyer-loves were lilting and
flower-rivals tilting
A mighty weir through throes bore
living streams.
Once a hushed and drowsing rill in the
cradle of a hill —
(So love and pain awake a soul from'
dreams).
When shadows chill were falling,
mother we heard thee calling
(Boronia’s bells achime were answer-
ing thee),
And ever Australia’s name is laurelled
with thy fame
(Her wattle breathed—and she
pledged loyalty).
The master-weaver at his loom wove
his mystic wefts of bloom
(The dews were fairy-sponsors at
each birth),
At the roll-call of the flowers these
were given by the hours,
A secret service-cypher for'the earth.
Space fails me to say more aboutthese charming lyrics. The little
booklet in its dainty purple and gold carries messages to -wives and mo-
thers, lassies and soldier lads.

ENVOI.
First Anzacs on the Quest, we hail you—Hail!
To those who living hear the shield of Fame —
To those Beyond—on Higher Service hent —..
Our salutations on this Anzac Day,
Where Love and Pride as angels stem the Font
Of Tears
—And so one April dawn on blue
Aegean, woven of souls of fighting men,
And in baptismal flame, the grand, new name
Of Anzac, Lo! was bom; a mystic cypher,
A secret code to indicate a race
Dauntless to dare and do, achieve, or die.
AN.Z.A.C. —a mystic cypher for the years
To shrine, in lettering of blood and fire—
A key that opened wide Australia’s Gate
Of Fame


The following poems are written by
a mother of Anzacs, and express the
stirring qualities of Australian women
who have been ready and willing to
send their sons forth to fight for the
freedom of the world'and to protect all
that we know and hold dear in Aus-
tralia. Mrs. Kidson’s poems truly ex-
press the sentiment of a womanly
woman of Australia:- —

* A most singular coincidence is attached
to the poem, ‘ ‘ The Mothers ’ Battalion, ’ ’ by
May Kidson. It originally appeared in the
Perth ‘ ‘ Sunday Times ’ ’ on June 30, 1915, sub-
sequently appearing in the ‘ ‘ Sydney Mail, ’ ’
and widely reprinted East. Lance-Corporal Sid.
Johnstone (son of a late Surveyor-General in
the West), of the gallant 10th Light Horse,
tells this curious tale of coincidence, showing
in war days fact may be stranger than fiction.
He and Troop-Sergeant Noel Doyle Kidson (the
elder son of the writer), of the same regiment,
were wounded and at Malta at the same time.
On returning to the firing line together they
occupied, the first day, a small dug-out, and the
writer noticed a familiar scrap of the ‘ ‘ Sunday
Times.” evidently a bit torn off, floating round
and blown into the dug-out by a high-explosive
shell. He picked it up, and saw there a copy
of Mrs. Kidson’s verses, “The Mothers’ Batta-
lion.” written by the mother of his pal, to whom
he handed it. While Sergeant Kidson was
reading his mother’s verses for the first time,
a high-explosive shell went off quite near
them. The coincidence is strange, inasmuch as
the Sergeant never received by the ordinary
channels one copy of the ‘ ‘ Sunday Times ’ ’ or
“Sydney Mail,” or other papers containing it
that were posted to him, —(Exchange.)


THE LANDING.
(Lest Ye Forget.)
ANZAC DAY.
1915.
“The most stupendous feat in his-
tory.”—General Sir Stanley Maude,
K.O.M.G. (late hero of Bagdad).
Dedication.
To my younger son, and other
mothers’ sons, who paid the supreme
price there.
(Published by State Eecruiting Com-
mittee, 1918.)
FOREWORD.
The flag waves o’er land and sea! '
Britain’s flag—flag of the free—
Britain’s valour kept it there—
Fight for freedom—ANZACS DO
For the flag—for women too —
Fight as men who serve and dare.
See a new Australia scrolled!
See the victor-flags unrolled!
From Aegean’s sounding shore
Strikes the echo of a word,
That a listening world has heard,
A.N.Z.A.C. dauntless Army Corps.
As ’twere veterans, battle-tried,
Did “The Impossible”—or died.
First Anzacs of Anzac days!
Makers of the glorious name,
Pass the gate of Memory’s fame,
Where the world has sung your
praise.
Well you know the 3rd Brigade,
Who one splendid dawn had made
Young Australia’s deathless fame,
Ere the sun had flashed his light,
As the moon bade her “Good-night,”
Made the living Anzac name.
With the eyes of Memory
See!—afar—GALLlPOLl!
Through the silent hush of dawn,
See!—those boats that swiftly glide
Bearing stalwarts o’er the tide,
Ere the pennons of the morn.
See! impregnable that height,
Beetling crests that hove in sight—
Iron-armed that strapping crowd—
God! —hear now a shrapnel’s roar
As they leap upon the shore,
And the hounds of hell bark loud.


Up those hideous steeps they scale,
As the bullets rain red hail —•
Naval men in watching said —
‘ ‘ Each man of that 3rd Brigade
(First Anzacs that dawn had made)
Won the Cross, alive or dead.”
Back with dripping bayonet blade —
Spite the belching cannonade —
Back they beat the staggering foe.
Maddened tumult in the air,
Thund’rous guns and spitting flare,
Higher—higher—upward go!
Ere a forenoon’s splendour lay
On that first grand Anzac Day.
Seel some heroes of that climb
On the heights AND DIGGING IN!!
Scroll those glories that have been
On the rolls of deathless time.
Heavy tho’ the price they paid,
Dubbed the “Golden 3rd Brigade”
By Sir lan Hamilton.
After high noon, fighting men,
Kindred Anzacs landed then;
In the trail they followed on.
And those frowning heights they scale,
Joining those who blazed the trail;
Played the game, and played it well;
Palestine and Flanders, too.
Shrine the name that first shone thro ’
A young dawn of brimming hell,
When the wintry snow-gusts rage,
When the sun’s bright blossoms blaze
High upon Gallipoli—
Crowned by snow or crowned by flowers
Thro’ the speeding of the hours —
OUR FIRST GATE OF MEMORY.
AFTERWORD.
And a fresh unwritten scroll,
Shall show how each splendid soul
Leaves no fighting to a friend—
When a peace shall come your way,
fenow you hastened that great day—
Join the colours—see the end!
Tyrants of the airs and seas,
Fling unholy memories—
Darkest deeds beyond our ken!
Babes and Women—Nurses even.
Murdered souls that cry to Heaven,
Call “Join, join our Anzac men.’’
Will you waken—wake! and see
A new Gate of Memory,
And join, join the Anzacs then —
Anzacs of Aegean’s dawn,
Anzacs of this Anzac morn,
Prove they are Australia’s Men.


Hear the pealing bells of prayer,
Praying for your service where
Poes a foulest treachery hurled —
As an Anzac Hay acclaims,
Pill it with new Anzac names—
Keep your country’s flag unfurled.
The flag waves o ’er laud and sea,
Britain’s flag —flag of the free —
Britain’s valour kept it there —
Fight for freedom—ANZACS DO
For the flag—for Women, too—
Fight as men who serve and dare.
And a fresh unwritten scroll,
Shall show how each splendid soul
Leaves no fighting to a friend—
When a peace shall come your way,
Know you hastened that great day—
Join the colours —see the end!

THE EMPIRE’S APPEAL.
“The last man may count.” —Britain’s
Prime Minister.
April 3rd, 1918.
(Published by State Recruiting Com-
mittee, 1918.)
Hearts responsive, loyal, leal,
Hear an Empire’s grand appeal!
Let recruiting numbers mount!
Prove free manhood still shall give—
Show it has a right to live
Where “the LAST MAN now may)
Count.”
Well you call your land—the free
Use your right of Liberty,
So that swelling numbers mount!
Give your heart and give your hand
To your Country—Motherland—
When “the LAST MAN now may
Count. ’ ’
Give! Give! lest the "foe shall say,
Australia shirks her greatest day
And no swelling numbers mount—
Are you friend? or are you foe?
Free to stay and loath to go,
Now, when “the LAST MAN may
Count. ’ ’
The fierce conflict of a world
Sees the Anzac flag unfurled! —
Let the swelling numbers mount!
In proud sorrow shall our land
Watch the dwindling of that band,
When “the LAST MAN now may
Count. ’ ’


The Empire calls for every soil,
Ere the righteous cause be won—
Let the swelling numbers mount!—
You have now the right of choice,
Give! with no uncertain voice,
Yes, “when the LAST MAN shall
Count. ’ ’
Help the dawn of Freedom’s day,
Let no sceptred tyrant sway—
Though his hordes of numbers mount
From a fearsome nearing doom,
Heed that Clarion Call of “Come’’
Where “the LAST MAN now may
Count. ’ ’
Every urging tongue or pen
Rings that clarion note for men,
So that swelling numbers mount—
You’d not have it to your shame,
That you shared not Anzac fame,
When “the LAST MAN now may
Count. ’ ’
Go! fresh souls to carry on—
Hear a Country’s great “Well done!’’
As the swelling numbers mount—
Trust best instincts of your heart,'
Freely go and do your part,
Where “the LAST MAN now may
Count. ’ ’
Do your nature, then, no wrong
On the roll where you belong,
See the swelling numbers mount—
Peoples must be saved and freed,
Loud the Call and great the need,
Where “the LAST MAN now may
Count. ’ ’
Do not let the grand name die,
Add your own and so thereby
Shall the swelling numbers mount—
By the font of blood and tears
Through the welter of the years,
“Go!’’—“where the LAST MAN
may Count.’’
In that glorious battle-line,
Play the game, and play it fine—
And a swelling number mounts
As each man his soul shall voice
“Freely now I make my choice,
I’m the LAST MAN now that
Counts. ’ ’
April!—month of Anzac birth—
When the name first circled earth—
Let the swelling numbers mount.
Through the throes of battle-years,
From the harvesting of tears,
Now —“the LAST—LAST MAN may
Count. ’ ’
Work complete Anzacs begun;
Show the souls of men are one.
See a gathering number mounts!
Link hands now—our hearts applaud'
FREEDOM—asking no reward—
“ Gives “the LAST—LAST MAN
that Counts.”


SPIRIT CHILDREN.
WAR DAYS.
1918.
A Tribute.
I know I journey not alone,
As living images of thee
Are Honour, Faith, and Chivalry,
Thine own immortal children grown.
(Thou wert so young to live —so nobly
young to die.)
I.
O God! to think no child of thine
Shall ever nestle on my knee—
So living memory of thee
About my yearning heart entwine.
God! God, to think in vision fair
I ’ve seen thy sturdy, splendid brood,
In blue-eyed, gold-locked babyhood—
I’ve seen their unborn faces there.
Seeing thy sunny love for all;
How children clustered for thy kiss,
Sweet there I glimpsed a tender bliss,
Not recking how the shadows fall.
0 God! the carnage of the hour—
The souls unborn deprived of days —
And then my heart went out in praise
That mine was once that human flower.
11.
And with the lights and shadows blent,
Upon the golden hills of thought,
I see thy brave deeds bravely wrought,
And learn my lesson of content.
Though thou hast found the larger goal,
I stretch out eager hands to thee,
Filled with the flowers of Memory,
Grown in the garden of a soul.
Though thou hast sought the silent shore.
Across the hush of muted chords,
Louder than beat of measured words,
Love cries: I only love the more.
1 know I journey not alone,
As living images of thee
Are Honour, Faith, and Chivalry,
Thine own immortal children grown.
When twilight dusks the laud and sea,
Or live coals glow in wintry eve,
Closely those spirit-children cleave —
Love-legacies bequeathed to me.
And ne’er I think of thee as gone,
But only just passed on before,
And waiting by that open door,
Where Love eternal still lives on.
March 4, 1918.


WAR THOUGHTS.
(1915-18.)
WHEN “THE KIT" COMES HOME
ALONE.
Dedication.
TO THOSE WHO KNOW.
The stifled heartbreak in a. broken cry —
The broken chord of sound too deep for
tears—
Hearing methinks the angels e’en would weep
Did they not know the meaning of the years.
Remember, then, the voice that carried love —
The laughing eyes that sent their love to you—
Whatever was—is your’s—e’en here or there—
As Mem’ry’s sun of steadfast love shines
thro ’.
Remember, then, his was the soldier-heart —
Perchance he said “You’re great—l’m proud
of you”—
Then let that tender triumph note still ring,
Though you shall see him not, your thoughts
beat thro
You see his glasses dimmed for desert wear
When he wrote of ‘ ‘ The ribbon of the Nile ’ ’ —
And now undimmed to-day his eyes look thro’
The desert wastes of our own Little While.
His work is there —note books —in his own hand,
The pencilled words alive —for Memory!
A watch —mayhap a scarf —something he wore.
O God! dear God! why, why, should such
things be?
A housewife, needles, thread, that once he used,
The threads of Life have drawn them to your
hand—
His hands were there, and now invisible
They point the way —and —so —you under-
stand.
And as your voice shall trail across the space
’Midst silences the secret voice rives thro ’ —
And lo! the tortured heart is comforted
Believing knows —that he is hearing you.
Dost think a soul so grand could flicker out
When God made it of his own living flame?
Open your heart in pride and confidence,
And bum the glowing cresset of his name.
Dost think a love that loved you more than all—
The little tender thoughts along the road,
Decay? Nay—nay—they only stronger live
And circle you—they draw their strength from
God.


Give of your best —and unafraid, along
That Sundown Eoad where sinks the west’ring
sun,
See there his star above the dead joy glows,
Hear in your heart the whisper low, “Well
done. ”
Give of your best, even with head held high.
Make good! win out, steer by that beacon ray!
Your tears would wound him on his higher
work —
So smiling win his smile upon your way.
Remembering the voice that carried love,
The laughing eyes that sent their love to
you —
Whatever was—is your’s—e’en here or there—
As Mem’ry’s sun of steadfast love shines
thro ’.
THE FAMOUS CHARGE OF OUR
10th LIGHT HORSE AT
GALLIPOLI.
August 29th, 1915.
‘ ‘ One of the most thrilling stories of
the war. ’ ’ —‘ ‘ British-Australasian. ’ ’
Dedication:
To my elder son and other mothers’ sons
in it.
Heard ye of the Light Horsemen
Winniu’ glory once again
By Aegean waters?
On the 29th’s dim dawn —
August ’twas that breakin’ morn
Of red fields of slaughter.
Silently, with bated breath,
Each man steeled to fight till death,
Any danger scornin’.
Bay ’nets, bombs, and sandbags too,
lleiter, skelter, peltin’ thro’,
Ere sun topped the moruin’.
Then a trench was held and lost,
Countless men had paid the cost,
Many had to rue it—
Now the darin’ Light Horsemen
Had to take it back again—
Bet yer life we’ DO it!
Kidd —was there —ne’er funked a job,
Major Kidd —I bet a bob
You couldn’t beat him fightiu’!
Well, that day he played that game,
Added to the Light Horse fame.
(lie’s not one for skitin’!)
Ruunin ’ thro ’ the darkness there,
Fierce as dingoes in their lair.
Gee! the trench we copped it,
Gave the Turks one in the eye;
As the coots let out a cry,
Sure, our bombs had stopped it.


First line racin’ hell for leather,
Coo-ed, yellin’ every fellah —
Bombs were goin ’, rifles crackin ’ —
“First line over!” —hear the shoutin’!
And I bet we did some routin’
As the-2nd Line come trackin’!
S’truth, I know that I saw red
As me pal Mcßean fell dead —
Leavin’ me a mourner.
Sent me bullet whizzin’ fast,
And that Turk’s shot was his last
Cornin’ round the corner.
Our First Line of B. and A.
Phil Fry led that rippin’ day,
Led us on to meet it —
God!—he fell—no more he said —
Death!—amidst our glorious dead —
Game he went to greet it.
Throssell won the Cross his way
When we kept the Turks at bay,
Phil Fry won it dyin’;
And the boys in Phil’s first line '
Played the game, and done it fine,
Kept the bombs a flyin’.
Kipling says the N.C.O.
Can’t be beat where ’er they go,
Knowin ’ no disaster.
Henderson (D.C.M., too)
Showed that metal ringin’ true —
And the bombs fell faster.
Picked ’em up and back again,
Ere they spilt their crimson rain—
What a game of throwin’!
Eight score men had started out,
Just three score had lived it out—
That will give the showin’!
Turks had hundreds at their heel,
But our men were fit as steel,
Couldn’t beat ’em laffin’.
Jokes and squibs went flittin’ round,
Where the hot hail hit the ground,
Nigh the usual chaffin’!
How that hot hail* sputtered quick,
As we played a lively trick—
Thick as peas were comin ’.
Turks to hunt us out again—
Then we stood — each man — showed
plain—
Sent our bullets homin’.
Well! they thought—WE’D hundreds
then
(Our remains—that three score ten),
And we sent ’em flyin’!
God! I’ll hear the din we made,
As the sun beat thro’ the shade,
Till me last day dyin ’.


Took the trench and cleared the way
Straight along to Suvla Bay;
And they tell me rilin’!
Palestine will take the bun! —
But that’s NOT so easy done,
And I tell ’em smilin’!
Hill Sixty on Shank’s Mare,
Made a thrillin’ story, where
WE’D no horses bloomin.
You’re just carryin’ on the tale
As you blaze the grand new trail —
Keep the old name boomin’!
When a Peace lights up her flame,
Girolin ’ round the Anzacs ’ name,
Those that did their fightin’,
As the kiddies shall ask bold,
‘ ‘ Daddy, we want war tales told ’ ’ —
Up to us some skitin’.
Speakin’ now of Peace hereafter,
Of the eheerin ’ and the laughter, '
Drink a loyal toastin ’., then —
Comrades! on the road to glory!
Comrades! who have left the story
Of our old 10th Light Horsemen!
(Taught as a recitation at Perth Tech-
nical School.)
ONE HOUR.
One Perfect Hour shall live thro’
wastes of years
Like dew-sweet flowers e’en fresher for
the tears—
We cannot stand apart unknown —un-
blest —
When life has found one perfect Hour
the best.
WHEN LOVE IS LOVE.
Not in the rapture of bursting sheaf,
Not in the ripeness of summer leaf —
Not in the flame of Autumn’s dream,
But in biting frost shall its radiance
gleam.


Supplement - 1st Edition.
WHEN FLOWERS CALLED.
A WEST AUSTRALIAN SPRING
PAGEANT, 1914.
Foreword.
Hark! the hours call September! and
whisper low ‘ ‘ Eemember
The pageant of the flowers draweth
near! ”
Secrets whisper of the birth of those
children of the earth
That every list’ning mortal too may
hear.
Where flower-loves were lilting and
flower-rivals tilting
A mighty weir through throes bore
living streams.
Once a hushed and drowsing rill in the
cradle of a hill—
(So love and pain awake a soul from
dreams).
When shadows chill were falling,
mother we heard thee calling
(Boronia’s bells achime were answer-
ing thee),
And ever Australia’s name is laurelled
with thy fame
(Her wattle breathed —and she
pledged loyalty).
The master-weaver at his loom wove
his mystic wefts of bloom
(The dews were fairy-sponsors at
each birth),
At the roll-call of the flowers these
were given by the hours,
A secret service-cypher for the earth.
The pollen loves had mated as love’s
decree dictated,
And each had found its own love-
child the best;
And the jocund, lightsome earth is
exulting in new birth
For time is waking flower-babes from
rest.
Methought I heard a weeping that set
my pulses leaping—
’Twas but the sighing music of the
grass;
Just a tiny music-beat to dull the pat-
tering feet
Lest we should hear the flower-
fairies pass.


And a magpie’s fluting sweet all the
rose-flushed dawnings greet,
Anon discordant notes come thrilling
too;
But all the jar and wrangle is just a
love-tuned jangle,
And time shall count the hidden
heart-beats true.
Come! surely winter's running, and
spring’s first-born is sunning,
Come! Come and hear Boronia’s
brown bell chime;
Come! see her brown wings open, they
hide a secret token (1).
Where memory’s scented breath is
marking time.
Look! golden lamps are swinging—a
country incense bringing—
(lt is the lamp of loyalty aglow);
For an emblem’s holy shrine is the
wattle-gold ashine (2),
As love it breathes through every
wind ablow.
At the roll call of the flowers and by
order of the hours,
King Carnival had summoned rank
and file.
The Leschenaultia peeping awake from
placid sleeping,
Sees all her lovely blue-eyed dar-
lings smile.
On Nature’s broad breast lying, she
whispers e ’en in dyin ’
They still shall keep their starry
radiance bright; (3)
A wondrous blue appealing through
darkened hours stealing
As friendship’s glow thro ’ space
shall star a night.
See! everlastings growing (an amber,
coral, showing),
Conventional and cold they cluster
low, (4)
For they have no spirit—breath-un-
emotional as death —
They answer not as wooing zephyrs
blow.
The Pixies when fun pokin ’ had made
a flower, jokin’,
The kangaroo’s own paw in spring-
tide fair; (5)
But the Pixies broke their loom when
they made that flower-bloom,
And raised a ghostly hand to beckon
there.


And their weft was red and green and
all hairy thro ’ its sheen.
No silken gloss was selling when it
grew;
A long, lean arm in daring shows a
perfect flower flaring,
But ’tis a paw! —that clasps the
scented dew.
Now all the world is stirring, see
gauzy wings are whirring,
That dare caress a flower-maiden’s
hair (6)
So small, so white, so holy, her lidded
eyes close slowly,
She swoons at love-thrills in the
wooing air.
The scarlet runner’s splendour is shout-
ing “No surrender,”
Trekking a blood-red trail upon the
way; (7)
It will not hide a bower this obdurate
young flower,
But hides the earth so debonair and
gay.
The humming bee is kissing—he’s not
the one for missing,
The honeyed nectar in a flower-
mart ;
Her petals pearl-pale flying he’s in a
tangle lying, (8)
Close to the clinging spider-orchid’s
heart.
The crimson bottle brushes are sweep-
ing cobweb-clutches.
The spangled threads that tangle in
a maze; (9)
Their emerald spears are shielding—a
subtle fragrance yielding,
When all the mortal people come to
gaze.
See! soft gowns of satin shimmer and
fretted edges glimmer,
It is the lilac faintness of the land;
(10)
The satin flovyer’s wonder shall tempt
a lover’s plunder,
To crush her sweetness in a ruthless
hand.
In a bath of twinkling dew flower-
babes caught cold —’tis true,
And fairy doctors ordered blankets
fast;
And the homely flannel flower remem-
bering that hour, (11)
Still kept her goods at hand as sea-
sons past.


And the Ladye Iris mine with her
heart of gold ashine,
A simple wildflower ripe on Nature’s
way;
Love as purest gold she knows; —faith
as purple petal glows,
My Ladye Iris mine my heart you
sway.
Big hanksia’s knightly glory doth hold
a gallant story,
His silver lances poised he stood at
ease; (13)
When the wintry gales sung low and
he did his sentrygo,
Spring kissed hig blushing face midst
whisp’ring trees.
Comet watch the redgum blazing when
all the world is lazing,
Unfurled his flags defy the beating-
breeze;
Soldier-chieftain of the flowers for by
order of the hours,
Babes are born with fighting helmets
on his trees. (14)
And Ariels ride on zephyr wings—
elves have spun their cobweb
swings,
(Sylphs try to be as solemn as a
book);
Impish sprites strong nectar quaff—
Pixies steal it with a laugh,
Their blinds are down, and mortals
may not look.
When shadows chill were falling.
Mother we heard thee calling,
(Boronia’s bells achime were answer-
ing thee);
And ever Australia’s name is laurelled
with thy fame,
(Her wattle-breathed—and she-pledged
loyalty).
Key to the Secret Service Cypher.—
(1) Memory, (2) love in loyalty, (3)
friendship, (4) stoical endurance, (5)
fun in fancy, (6) sensitiveness, (7), ad-
venture, (8) passion in service, (9)
everyday endeavour, (10) frailty, (11)
utility, (12) love in faith, (13) strength
on guard, (14) born fighters.

ANZAC DAY, 1915.
To Anzac Women, by One of Them.
1918.
Australia’s Mecca day of pride and tears —
’Tis but an Anzac tribute this her day—
A.N.Z.A.G.S., who made that name one April
dawn,
Girdling their Country’s name round listening
worlds.
(“We are proud of our deeds, but the most
glorious is the epic of Gallipoli.”)
PEACE.
(Shall Peace perform Her Ministry until Her
Destiny shall he assured?)
Shall Angel Peace drooping with folded wing
Arise above the mountainous wild wastes
Of blood-red seas and human wreckage cast ?
Shall the locked music of a warring world
Break into woven sounds of melody? '
Lifted the bursting burthen of souls that strive
If the strong beat of her encircling wings
Stir the white majesty of dawn to fly
Her roseate pennons on a rising day.
Tumultuous waves chant loud their ruthlessness,
But thro’ the thund’ring tumult see afloat
The Shallop of a people’s heart, secure,
Till tranquil Waters haven peacefully.
The night weaves ebon tresses in tangled
gloom—
The spangled heavens wide fling their starry
trail —
The evolution of the soul thro ’ stress,
The revolution of a world thro’ pain—
And thro ’ the warp and woof of blood and tears
Hang rainbow hues of equity; and Peace
Shall spread her hov ’ring wings when hideous
wrongs
Find right, and a justice shall re-create.
Shall Peace perform her ministry until
Her destiny shall be assured? Nay—nay—
• Beat back the wanton serpent to his lair
And draw the fangs that spat their venom
where
Serene a world had smiled; and choked the curse
Blighting all vernal blooms ere Censers swing
In gardens of Delight.
The murdered souls
Of Innocents cry out against the Herod
Of the airs and seas; or, fain wmuld I glimpse
The silver vision when, thro ’ secret night
Sorrow alone shall quicken to new birth.
When pale despair shall rip the sweetness from
The day, I seem to hear the beat of wings
Invisible that overhang. Meseems
A stream of rippling wind shall bear them on
The tide of sound until the snowy breasts,
Wide eyes ’that vision all, and hold the best,
Of Angel Peace shall give the slaughtered earth
Tranquility.


And wondrous Alchemy!
To drain the chalice of abiding Peace
’Midst the burnt cinders of War’s crucible. —
And on one perfect Dawn a clinging Hope
With laurelled Faith entwined proudly shall
deck
The Brow of Peace, as ’neath the poise of wings
She lays in tenderness ineffable
Her hand upon the knees of circumstance.
O! wings invisible that overhang
Methinks the stream of rippling wind must bear
Them on the tide of sound ere many moons
Eecurrent hang a sickle’s gold over
A waiting world’s long harvesting of tears.
Meseems I hear the chant behind the veil
Of sense: “Thrice blessed the heroic dead
Who gave, and blest the living, who loving,
bled
To give.’’
From the red fields of slaughter shall
Some seed of good supreme burst binding bonds
And canopy a waking world; and ’tis
Through pang of travail that a soul sees light.
AFTERWORD.
And then, maphap, or now, past time or space,
To hearts athirst, a soul on higher service shall
E’en whisper tender healing and across
The Wireless of Thought that girdles all—
That thro’ the awful surge of yearning days
God’s ways are well—and homing love shall
bridge
The Silences —and Life and Death are —One.
. .And anguished hearts when Peace-bells joy
again
And syrens shrill their long exultant blast.
And longing memory cries and will be heard,
Then hear his voice and by that Font of Tears
With brave proud smile stand at salute, and let
The halo of his love shine thro ’ —until
Another dawn shall break and shadows flee.
—ln Memoriam, Anzac Day, 1915.
THE AWAKENING.
(An Impromptu.)
Life’s music muted —still—
0! God, can such things be,
That blood of babes and women call
In soundless Memory!
Life’s music muted—still—-
Ah! can we stand and wait,
When murderers fouled the innocent
And souls were desolate?
Life’s music muted —still —
When fury rips the air,
Dare we dream on the drowsing days
With voices calling there?


MY HERO.
1 do not know, my hero, how you died,
They tell me ’twas beside the daisies pied,
And that red poppies kissed your brow
(Ah! God, I envy them that last caress—
Oh! that my hands you loved had soothed to
bless)
Dying alone —my Hero —thou!
I seem to hear the snarling guns’ harsh roar,
But vision only thee on that far shore;
My eyes all misted ever now
Thy gay eyes see, thy strong face know my
man—
Why in this barter in life’s caravan,
Ah! why shouldst thou be chosen —thou?
Thy comrades loved thee well, my hero there
E ’er kind of word, they said, ‘ ‘ the deil to dare. ’
Thy voice it echoes to me now,
Vibrant and cheeringly e’er leading on
Till at the chief’s command that trench was won
And Thou gav’st all, my Hero —thou!
My heart’s deep love, you loved, thrills in its
pride,
That you for women, children, strove and died.
I promise to be worthy thee,
That day you left you called me “great,” my
smile
You said would last beyond life’s “little while,”
Thy tender smile I see —to me.
“How oft we planned our laughing days
together
In our own breezy Swan in the sailing weather
(We little recked our sailing days were past),
But, dear, my Ship of Life is steered by thee,
I feel thy tender eyes are watching me.
I’m proud we nailed our colours to the mast.
I do not know, my Hero, how you died,
They tell me ’twas beside the daisies pied
And that red poppies kissed your brow
(Ah! God, I envy them that last caress —
Oh! that my hands you loved had soothed to
bless)
Dying alone —my Hero —thou!

“KEEP ON KNITTING, GIRLS.
A Plea from the Trenches.
(Reprinted from the “West Austra-
lian,” “Daily News,” and “Kal-
goorlie Sun,” 1915.)
O, keep on knitting, girls, now,
For every skein’s just gold;
When you’re in the sunshine, girls,
We’re sore and numb with cold.
So keep on knitting, girls, now,
A weekly sock for a man;
We’re doing all our little bit
And you’ll help us all you can.
And keep on knitting, girls, now,
Each week a glove for a hand;
For we ’re out in the biting cold,
And you ’re in our summer land..
P’raps you will think it’s hot, too,
And 'fingers go clammy and wet;
But you’ve got water handy, girls,
And chilblains are worse than sweat.
t
A warm neck wrap is fine, too,
They say it’s easy knit;
There’s not the turning of the heel,
That makes it hard to lit.
And knit us a cap, too, girls,
When our lips are out and blue;
(But our ears don’t get the frost bite)
We’ll think a cheer for you.
The shrapnel’s too loud to hear it,
But we’ll think it all the same;
So knit some thoughts for the lads,
girls,
To warm us like a flame.
Girls, you’ve been good and rippin’,
And we think a lot of you;
As you help us in the deadly cold,
Girls of our skies of blue.
For there’s no land like Australia,
And no girls in the world
Can beat ’em in the woman’s fight,
As we keep the flag unfurled.
As we keep the flag unfurled.


THE MOTHERS’ BATTALION.
(Reprinted from “Sunday Times,”
“Sydney Mail,” etc., 1915.)
To manhood’s days I brought them,
And then they heard the Call!
To manhood’s ways I brought them,
And then I gave my all.
No laughing voices jesting,
No sweetness of caress;
No eyes’ gay, tender message,
I gave my all —no less.
Ah! Mothers in the shadows;
Ah! mothers in your fears,
The sacrifice’s greatness
Must quench the burning tears.
Remember, we are women,
With heroes for our men;
Ah! Mothers in the shadows,
We’ll be heroic then!
A Mothers’ brave Battalion
All in one firing line,
But thro’ the cloud-smoke seething
The star of Faith shall shine.
We heard the Gall of Duty,
Like them we fought and won;
And in our hearts ’ own battlefield
Shall hear their grand “Well done!”
“MARAH.”
A life is born through suffering,
A soul is born through pain—
In Marah’s bitter waters
Shall anguish cleanse again.
SOMETIME—SOMEWHERE.
A screen of clouding scud had foamed
To fetter all the blue—
(Like walls of space in parting ways
Between my heart and you)
But Faith still sees sometime —some-
where —
Love’s waking dream come true.


ANZAC DAY.
AND WHAT IT MEANS.
To Sister-women on the Road of Sacrifice and to
My Younger Son behind the Veil.
(Published by the Recruiting Committee,
Auzac Day, 1917.)
First Anzacs in the Quest, we hail you—Hail!
To those who living hear the shield of Fame—
To those Beyond on Higher Service bent—
Our Salutations on this Anzac Day,
Where Love and Pride as angels stem the Font
Of Tears.
One April dawn on blue Aegean
Strong heartbeats surged in shudd’ring silences
Before that scented dawn was bathed in fire;
And dun smoke smearing blurred her loveliness—
Long silences all split and spilled in thud
Of screaming gun that beat the sweetness from
The golden mom, and heaped the flower-filled
. heights—
“lmpregnable”—with splendid slain. ' Anzacs!
Of whom ’twas said “The most stupendous feat
In history theirs”—by naval experts e’en.
“Each man in that immortal Landing won
The Cross” —And so one April dawn on blue
Aegean, woven of souls of fighting men,
And in baptismal flame, the grand, new name
Of Anzac, lo! was bom; a mystic cypher,
A secret code to Indicate a race
Dauntless to dare and do, achieve, or die.
A.N.Z.A.C. A mystic cypher for the years
To shrine, in lettering of blood and fire—
A key that opened wide Australia’s Gate
Of Fame.
The Anniversary Morn!—Anzacs
We lay our laurelled wreath of love and pride,
Upon the shrine where memory guards the
flame;
Where even bleeding hearts shall staunch their
wounds,
Knowing the Way of Sacrifice is blest
Beyond all seeing. Only behind the veil
Of sense that shrouds our sightless eyes, the com
Unripe, the full-eared sheaves, forgather now
In other fields where higher service called
Beyond the needs and wastes that irk and chain.
Our little lives —our Country’s life, shall be
The purer, larger, for the travail of
These splendid souls—Australia, a Nation bom!
And hark! the pulsing life of forbears thrilled
And swept Westralia to the highest crests of
Giving (and when a larger gift had urged)
To fling her aid across the spaces where
Her Anzacs called—Across wide seas that since
Their being ne’er had borne, till now, upon
A heaving breast the tiny bones of babes,
And tender Mother hands—murdered and done —
By brutal Huns’ relentless savagery.
(And but for Britain’s might that fate were
ours.)


. . . This Anzac Day a clarion note shall
sound
For souls to swell the Anzacs’ 8011, leading
To Victory—to keep the name bom of
Our blood and tears untarnished till they fly
Their banner, battle-stained, when Peace shall
call —
A People’s laurelled wreath crowning our Day
Of Sacrifice, when love and pride as angels
Guard the font of tears —as we—stand At
Salute!
Perth, Anzac Day, 1917.
“THE MOTHER’S FLOWER.”
Gallipoli’s Resting Place.
Our Hero slept amongst caressing
flowers
In the hushed moment of life’s
crowded hours
(The red, the white, and the royal
blue),
His coronal a regal one,
Wreaths woven for his martyrdom'—
The resting-place in a life’s adieu.
But love the luminant of his great
soul
Methinks must flaming live beyond
Death’s goal
(Ah! just the waiting on another path),
And e’en his eyes’ own tenderness
of smile
Shall live with us beyond life’s little
while
Until the joy of other aftermath.
Aglow the blazing poppy cup of red
Would pillow painlessly his sunny
head,
And the moon daisy, strong and white
and pure,
And a flow’r blooming an immortal
blue
That seemed to hold the peace of
Heaven’s hue
Dor his own crossing to that other
shore —
The red, the white, the blue his ori-
flamme,
In our heart’s battlefield the flower
of his name.
And women, mothers in the sacrifice,
Shall we not even proudly pay the
price'—
Would we not have our men where
honour lies?
Rejoice, they are not shirkers on the
road
In shallow jest while others bear
their load —
For women, children, country, a Hero
dies!


The greatest gift on earth to give,
he gives,
And in Australia’s history memory
lives,
Whilst in our soldier hearts lives too
his flower
Of duty, shrined, to sweeten sorrow’s
hour.
“Sunday Times,” 1915.
A BUSH MESSAGE.
As a tree is scarred by fire,
A life may be seared by pain,
But over the gaunt tree's grimness
Creep brave young leaves again
And cover the scars with a garment,
And cling to the saddened ghosts,
E ’en make a tree-top bower
Where the song-birds nest in hosts.
So when life is scarred by fire,
And a heart is seared by pain,
Shall Memory’s hand of healing
Lend it new life again I
And with the leaves of kindness —
Tender thought-nests by the score—■
The marred life holds new beauty
And it blossoms as of yore,
For under the tree’s scorched grimness,
And under the heart’s fierce pain,
There runs a living spirit,
A touch may revive again.

“WIMIN.”
(Inspired by an Anzac boy.)
I’ll tell you fair and honest ’ow it
’appened,
There’s nothin ’ in it of a bloomin ’
joke;
It’s only that the donah I was eourtin ’,
Weill left me for another bally bloke.
t
Only’s a big word as I reckon,
In balmy sort o’ blank me spirits
sunk;
And life didn’t seem the worth the
livin ’,
And sooner I’d ’ave quit it—done a
bunk.
I ain’t complainin ’ —she’d ’er reasons
’andy—
I ’adu’t any fine dibs, any dough;
The little that I ’ad was allers dribblin ’
In treatins and the blessed picture
show.
One day she up and gives me such a
back- ’and,
‘Loping with a wheezy city coot,
A feller with no backbone in ’is makins,
I’d an itehin’ jest to scrape ’im with
me boot.


Fairish ’oof ’is old Jew dad ’ad left
’im,
I couldn’t tell yer ’ow it was bloom-
in’ got,
And that same cow’s own way o ’
spendin ’
I’ll not soil yer ’earin’ with the rot.
The two was spliced, and I left on me
lonesome,
And jest a toss if I went up or down;
The thought that ’e was mud, why that
jest saved me
From wallowin’ like any boozy
clown.
O, wimin’s jest the boshter stars o ’
’eaven,
To guide yer with the shinin ’ of
ther ’ light;
Or bli’me they shows yer ’ell’s perdi-
tion,
And all yer bloomin ’ corn ’as got
the blight.
I* or wimin be the wonder of creation,
They draws yer as the sea the trick-
lin’ stream,
They gives yer jest the nightmare and
the doldrums,
Or soothes the like the sweetness of
a dream.
But here I’m a stoppin’, ruminatin’,
When all the best to be is yet to
come;
As ’ow the devilish Germans sprang
the wartrap
And any man a man must fight for
’ome.
So see me now in khaki with me
stripes too;
They passed me out on the eddica-
tion test;
But I won ’em in the scrimmage o’
the flghtin’,
When I see’d red and luck it done
the rest.
Now, I guess I want a spell o’ restin’,
Sort o ’ tired o ’ spinnin ’ o ’ this
yarn;
I’ve done me little bit like any Anzac,
In ’ospital I’d say a blanky ‘ ‘ darn. ’ ’
But there’s jest a darlin’ little nurse-
lin’
(Bonzer —’er that ’ails from W.A.);
What’s darnin’ and a patehin’ up me
shot ’oles,
And she’d ’ave the ’ump if even
“darn” I say.
‘ ‘ Only ’ ’ —yes, it ’ olds a lot o ’ meanin ’,
Only—jest that little tart and me —
Only —a star o’ comfort in me ’eavens,
A shinin’ through the rumbles o’
life’s sea.


I’ve got the D.C.M., they tell me
smilin ’,
But love o’ ’er for me is dearer far;
She says she’ll cure me tricks o’
speakin ’,
And ever be me faithful guidin ’
star.
And jest this mornin ’ when the
dawnin’,
Was a kindlin’ ’er ’ot fire for the
day;
S ’truth-like a searchlight I was seein ’,
Gawd markin’ all me sign posts on
the way.

THE MOTHER’S GUIDING STAR.
He is alive, our darling, in “Christ’s
Mansions, ’ ’
He who filled our life with every
grace;
He is alive in all the sunlit spaces—
Tho’ I may not see the glory of his
face.
He is alive, our darling, in ‘ ‘ Christ’s
Mansions,”
Achieving still tho’ on some other
sphere —
Alive the splendid forces of his man-
hood,
And his circling spirit shall be near.
He is alive, our darling, in ‘ ‘ Christ’s
Mansions, ’ ’
With a tender watching from afar.
His love alive, his tender thoughts
caressing,
His soul alive! the mother’s guiding
star.

THE WAR-CLOUD.
I do not know —I cannot tell—
What Life may hold in store;
I only know that Faith shall wait
The opening of the Door.
I do not know —I cannot tell—
The shoals in storming sea;
I only know Faith’s chart is mine
Through dangers circling me.
I do not know —I cannot tell —
Why all this life’s unrest;
I only hear Faith’s whisper low,
And know what is—is best.

LYRICS OF LOVE AND MEMORY.
YOU AND I.
The trill of the bird to his mate,
The kiss of the sea on the sand;
Just you and I in the silence,
Just you and I in the laud.
The bee in the heart of the flow'er,
The sun’s caress of the sky;
Just you and I in the silence,
And old Time whirling by.
The moon on the breast of the Heavens,
The stars the eyes of the night;
Just you and I in the silence,
With Memory’s lamp alight.
THE PROMISE.
Heart —dear heart —wilt whisper low?
Say—say—if you e ’er regret
That we once met on Life’s Cross-
ways,
And you said you’d ne’er forget?
You’d ne’er forget.
You’d ne’er forget.
Heart —dear heart —was joy worth the
pain
Of the anguished bitter woe,
When the soul called out to Heaven —
Tell me, dear heart, do you know?
I’ll ne’er forget.
I ’ll ne’er forget.
And the slumbering spirit wakened,
And gave us its ray, dear heart,
To keep e ’er alight the signpost
On the Crossways where we part.
We’ll ne’er forget.
We’ll ne’er forget.
THE CALL.
Over the walls of Time and space
I hear your spirit call;
Listening I catch the message sent,
Know Love still all in all.
Where two souls met as one, deal
heart,
Finding the other’s mate,
E'en Time’s own scythe can never mow
Those blossoms sown by Fate.
So I can face the long years, dear,
And what life yet shall see,
Knowing full well that thought-waves
meet
Ever for you and me.


SONG OF LOVE.
And love is a purling stream,
Making merry the way,
Wakening heart of the flower
By the joy of its lay.
And Love is the cool glad shade,
Under the noontide heat,
Where the tired heart may rest,
And kindred souls may meet.
And Love is the afterglow,
After life’s clouds and mists,
When bright as the rose of dawn
Softly the earth is kissed.
And Love is a torrent’s swirl,
Scattering afar wild leaves —
Memory garners tenderly,
Binding them into sheaves.
THE GATE OF MEMORIES.
I dreamt you kissed me, darling,'
And Life’s gate opened wide;
Just you and I in the garden,
Just you and I inside.
You sowed the love-seed, darling,
You threw them far and wide—■
The glowing green crept thro ’ the
earth,
Just you and I inside.
I woke! The gate was clanging!
Oh! Love, you were outside;
But bright grow Memory’s flowers,
The dear old gate they hide.
MEMORY MINE.
In the shadows of the twilight,
With the sunglow dim and low,
O'er the vanished fields of distance
Shall my winged memory go.
Memory mine.
See the flowers there still growing,
See the purple and the gold;
All their perfumed message wafting,
As it was in days of old.
Memory mine.
In the shadows’ lurking darkness,
See the light in tender eyes,
Hear the silence, words unspoken,
Tell a love that never dies.
Memory mine.
In the silence of the gloaming,
Feel a tender presence steal;
Memory’s circling wings uplifting,
Shall my weary spirit heal.
Memory mine.
Memory mine.
