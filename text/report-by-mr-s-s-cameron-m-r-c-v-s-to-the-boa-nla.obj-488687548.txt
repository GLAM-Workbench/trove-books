REPORT BY MR. S. S. CAMERON, M.R.C.V.S., TO THE BOARD
OF PUBLIC HEALTH, ON THE RESULTS OF HIS USE OF
TUBERCULIN IN CATTLE IN VICTORIA.
The investigation, the results of which are given in the subjoined report, was
directed by the Board for the purpose of inducing stock-owners and dairymen to
exterminate tuberculosis from their herds, and also of elucidating the question as to
the measures to he taken in Victoria in connexion with cattle for the reduction of
tuberculosis in man.
It had been shown, first in one and then in another part of the world, that
tuberculosis was extensively prevalent among cattle. The transmissibility of the
disease to man had been accepted by the highest authorities iu those states where
the matter had been investigated. And for the eradication of the bovine affection a
reliable test, which was the first desideratum, had been found in tuberculin, a
re-agent which, in competent hands, had proved to be, for practical purposes, all that
was wanted. No sooner had these positions been established, than the duty was
recognised by the Governments of most civilized countries of affording to stock-
owners and dairy-farmers every possible aid in the extermination of tuberculosis,
State moneys in large amount being voted for this special purpose not so much for
the protection of the pocket of the owners of cattle as for the protection of man
against infection from cattle.
It was for this and other purposes that Mr. Cameron was appointed, on the
urgent representations of the Board, as Veterinary Inspector on their staff; and at
once the Board gave it out that Mr. Cameron’s services would be available to those
who would consent to have any animal that, in the opinion of Mr. Cameron, ic-acted
to the tuberculin test in a manner indicative of tuberculosis, immediately slaughteied
and examined after death. Mr. Cameron’s report shows the nature and extent of the
work done by him in this direction. Phe result goes far towards demonstrating the
same important truths as regards bovine tuberculosis in this country as had been
found by other observers elsewhere; and it may well serve as a source of encourage-
ment for pressing forward the work that has thus been commenced, though some
change be made in the conditions under which State aid shall in future be provided
for the elimination of the bovine disease.
It must be added that the lectures and demonstrations given by Mr. Cameron
on the living animal and at the post-mortem in the different localities where the
investigations have been undertaken have proved of the greatest importance and value,
as shown by the numerous reports given thereon in the press, and by the fact that
numerous owners of cattle have been induced thereby to have the test applied by
competent persons to their own stock.

REPORT TO THE BOARD OF PUBLIC HEALTH, VICTORIA, BY MR. S. S. CAMERON,
M.R.C.V.S., VETERINARY INSPECTOR TO THE BOARD, ON TUBERCULIN AS AN
AID IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF BOVINE TUBERCULOSIS.
During the eighteen months prior to September, 1898, on directions from the Board, I subjected a
number of dairy cattle, constituting the whole of the milking cows in nine herds in widely-separated paits of
the colony, to the tuberculin test, the objects having been to demonstrate the value of (he test ns an aid in the
diagnosis of tuberculosis, and to obtain some information as to the extent of the disease in the dairy cattle
of the colony. I hough the number of herds—9—and the number of cattle—267—forming those herds
are not so numerous as to furnish a sufficient basis for estimating the extent of the disease in
the colony, it maybe remarked that the herds were, as already stated, in widely-separated parts of the
co ony, that the animals comprising those herds were mostly young cows or cows in their prime and above
the average ot dairy cattle in breeding in condition and milking qualities, and that the owners volun-
tan y submitted them to the test on the Understanding that all those that might re-act would be destroyed,
so that there is likelihood that the proportion of tuberculous animals found in the nine choice herds tested,
viz., 9 per cent., is not in excess of that for dairy cows in the colony at large.
1 shall give fiist the particulars concerning each herd, and then some of the lessons to be derived
from the results of the investigation.

Herd “ II.," Kyneton.—This herd consisted of twenty milking cows, mainly Shorthorn, Ayrshire,
and Jersey crosses. Most of the animals were in their milking prime and in good condition. The herd
had been gradually got together during the preceding eighteen mouths with the view of supplying milk for
a retail distribution. It was well managed in every respect, hand-feeding and housing at night in a well-
ventilated sanitary byre being practised in the winter.
Test applied, 26th and 27th January, 1897 —Koch’s tuberculin ; doses 0 4 c.c. to 0-5 c.c. One cow
re-acted definitely, giving a maximum rise of temperature of s’o° F., aud a mean rise during 34 hours
of 3-1° F.
Particulars concerning this cow are given in Table “ C.”

Herd “HI.” Carlsruho. —The herd consisted of eight milking cows, all pure-bred pedigreed Jerseys,
in good milking condition, and well cared for.
Test applied, 27th and 28th January, 1897—Koch’s tuberculin ; dose, o'3 c c. to 0-5 c.c.
None of the animals re-acted.
Herd “IV.” Sale, East Gippsland.—This herd consisted of 46 cows in good milking condition ;
ordinary dairy cows, with strains of Shorthorn, Jersey, Ayrshire, and Hereford. The herd was well
managed and cared for, ensilage and other artificial foods being used regularly during the summer and
winter months.
Test applied, 22nd aud 23rd March, 1897—Kochs tuberculin ; dose, 0-3 c.c. to O'o c.c.
None of the animals gave a definite re-action. In two, however, the temperature rose sharply at
the end of twelve hours to 104-6° F. and 104-1° F. respectively, the rise being 3 0 and 2*2 respectively,
but this rise was not maintained for more than an hour, the temperature in both cows being again normal
at the end of fourteen hours. These two cows were re-tested a fortnight later, with the result that neither
of them re-acted, the only alteration of temperature being a rise of 0-7° F. in one case, and 0 2 F. in the
other, ten hours after injection.
Herd “ V.” Tatnra, Goulburn Valley.— This herd consisted of 25 ordinary dairy cows in fair
milking condition, well managed and cared lor.
Test applied, sth and 6th April, 1897-Koch’s tuberculin ; dose 0 4 c.c. to 0-o c.c
Five of the 25 cows gave re-actions, * the mean rise in temperature varying from 3-8 F. to 2T F.

lI.—SOME OF THE LESSONS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE PARTICULARS SET OUT ABOVE.
Firstly , as to the distribution of the disease in the animal. On analyzing the tubercular lesions
present in the 23 cows slaughtered, it will be found that fourteen of the 23 were affected with “ generalized
tuberculosis,” that is to say., that the disease existed in two or more organs or groups of organs, remote
from one another and unconnected with each other except by the bloodstream. The fourteen were—

had not spread beyond the organs or groups of organs affected aud their special lymphatic glands These
nine were Nos. 1,3, and 5, Herd “ 1.,” Table “ B ” ; Nos. 2 and 3, Herd “ VI.” Table “E ” • and No* 7
6,7, and 8, Herd “ VII.” Table “ F.” ’ ’
Secondly , as to the probable method of infection. If the anatomical situation and pathological
and condition of the various lesions be analyzed, an approximate idea of the method of infection^n about
half the cases may be obtained. For instance, in the case of six of the cows (viz., Nos. 1 and 3 Herd
“1.,” Table “ B.” ; No. 3, Herd “ VI.” Table “ E ” ; and Nos. 5,6, and 7, Herd “ VII.” Table “ F ”) it
may be assumed that the primary infection was by ingestion. In the case of five others (viz
No. 5, Herd Table “B”; No. 1, Herd “//.,” Table “C ” ; No. 2, Herd “ V 1.,” Table “ E
and Nos. 3 and 8, Herd “ VII.” Table “F ”) it may be assumed that the primary infection'
was by inhalation, while in the case of the remaining twelve (Nos, 2 and 4, Herd “ I ” Table “B”-
No. 1,2, 3, and 5, Herd “ V.” Table “D ” ; No. 1, Herd “ VI.” Table “E ” ; Nos. 1,2, 4 and 9
Herd “ F/A, lable “I ” ; and No. 1, Herd “ IX.” Table “G ”) the method of infection is doubtful on
account of the diversity of organs or distinct groups of organs invaded, and also the want of differentiation
in age appearances between the lesions in the various parts affected.
rr Thirdly, serving to show which organs are most likely to be attacked, reference may be made to
lable H, which gives the frequency with which the several organs were found affected with tubercle.

Giving the Temperatures before and after Injection of two non-reacting Animals.
It will be seen from this table that no indication of tuberculosis could be drawn from the temperatures,
and there was no other sign of a re-action. Particulars concerning the life history and post-mortem
examination of these animals are as follow :
No. 1 Cow. —A six-year-old half-bred Shorthorn cow, recently calved, in low condition, but an
excellent milker. Two years previously she had had an attack of acute pleurisy, but recovered after
fourteen days’ veterinary treatment. On being slaughtered, the respiratory, digestive, circulatory, urinary,
and generative organs were carefully examined and minutely dissected, as also were the various groups of
lymphatic glands, the supra-renal capsules, and the brain and spinal cord; and with the exception of a fibrous
pleuritic adhesion about 3 inches in diameter, evidently the remains of the acute pleurisy, no lesion, tubercular
or other, was found.
No. 2 Cow. —An aged Shorthorn cow, in full milk and good condition. No previous history of
serious illness, but selected by (he manager as the most likely of the others to be diseased on account of
occasional capriciousness of appetite and attacks of foetid diarrhoea and indigestion. A similarly complete
and careful post-mortem examination of this cow was made, with the result that no tubercular lesion was
found. The liver was, however, somewhat extensively diseased, being affected with both fluke (disfomum
hepaticum) and parasitic cysts. A number of the ducts of the liver had undergone calcareous degeneration,
and contained the calcified debris of flukes, but no living fluke was found. In the substance of the liver
were many parasitic cysts, the contents of not a few of which had undergone degeneration, the wall or
capsule of each cyst being, however, well defined and shrivelled, and without sign of coalescence.
[Another case,| which affords evidence that when tuberculin gives a negative result tuberculosis
is not present, has recently been investigated. In the course of the post-mortem examination of calves
used for the cultivation of calf vaccine lymph I found a twelve-weeks-old calf badly affected with tuber-
culosis, the parts most diseased being the lymphatic glands (especially the mammary or udder,
inguinal or groin, bronchial and sternal groups), the lungs, pleura, and liver. There was also a largo
broken-down tubercular abscess at the umbilicus (navel). Although the fact that the disease was
generalized in so young a calf might have led to the supposition that it had been contracted from the

milk was concerned, was thus confirmed by independent bacteriological examination.]
To resume it is to be observed that id the course of the somewhat limited mqmry, the results of
which are riven above, every animal that reacted was proved to be tuberculous ; and that, positively m
the cases of two non-d-acting cows, and presumably in the case of the remaining 241 non-re-acting cows,
no tuberculosis existed* When tuberculin indicated that tuberculosis was present, tubercular lesions
were found ; and when tuberculin indicated that tuberculosis was not present, tuberculosis was not found
This result s lit accordance with a vast amount of experience obtained m other countries; and .may with
confidence be said that there is substantial ground for the formulation of the axiom Tubeteuhn cannot
