The Melancholy Loss of the
AMPHITRITE.
Bound from Woolwich to Botany Bay, with 108 Female Convicts and 12
children, together with the Crew 16, being 136; of which 133
Perished in the dreadful gale of Saturday the 31st of
August, 1833, of BOULOGNE.
GIVE ear you feeling Christians,
That dwell upon the shore,
A tale so sad and yet so true,
You seldom heard before;
The Amphitrite, a Convict Ship,
From Woolwich sailed away,
On the twenty-fifth of August,
She was bound for Botany Bay.
CHORUS
From Woolwich bound to Botany Bay,
The Amphitrite o'er sea,
And perished in the dreadful gale,
One hundred and thirty-three
The Convcits all were females,
One hundred and eight,
And crew sixteen in number,
, How dreadful to relate ;
With 12 sweet innocent babies,
From Woolwich sailed away,
One hundred and thirty-six,
Were bound for Botany Bay.
On the 30th day of August,
A dreadful storm did arise,
The roaring waves ran mountains high
Dark and dismal was the skies ;
To the Captain on their bended knees
They did for mercy crave,
But he unto those weeping souls,
Would no compassion have.
At 2 o'clock the thirty-first,
She run upon the sands,
Near unto the port Boulogne,
On the deck appeared all hands,
To the Captain they aloud did cry,
In anguish and distress,
Alas ! their tender infants,
They clasped unto their breast.
The wind did roar the seas did run,
The vessel split in two,
And floating on the watery main,
Were passengers and crew ;
The Captain, Surgeon, and his wife,
All perished in the sea,
Out of one hundred and thirty-six,
Were saved but only three.
Had the Captain yielded to their cries
Alas ! they might them save,
The women, children, and crew,
All from a watery grave ;
And numbers on the shore did weep,
And bitterly did mourn,
To see them on the briny waves,
Would pierce a heart of stone.
Friends, Parents, and Relations,
That day will long deplore,
That fatal night just sixty-six,
Were washed upon the shore;
It would cause the hardest heart to ache,
To see how they did weep,
But death was near & they were plung'd,
Into the briny deep.
So to conclude this mournful tale,
Those tidings for to hear,
It cannot fail from high and low,
To draw a silent tear;
This wreck will never be forgot,
This dreadful tale of woe,
We hope their souls in Heaven will rest,
While their bodies rot below.
