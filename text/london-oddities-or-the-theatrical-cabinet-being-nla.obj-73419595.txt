OBADIAH SNAGS;
Or, the Deserted Schoolmaster, as sung by Mr. Fitzwilliam,
Obadiah Snags, he was buried, and for why ?
It happen?d on the first of August,
He never would have suffer?d it, but that he chanc?d to die,
A week before the first of August.
I liv?d with him, as usher, when he taught school night
and day,
And when the pretty little boys their lessons cou?dn?t say,
This cruel hearted monster gave ?em leave to go and play,
All in the month of August.
Except a dozen duck-legg?d ladies, every body owns,
In May or June, July or August,
There never was a nicer girl than little Jenny Jones,
Bright and comely as the moon in August;
She kept Obadiah?s house, which I bought in days of bliss,
And thought I?d hire the maid, whom nobody thought
amiss;
Gave her wages, tea and sugar, vails, and now and then
but this
Was not upon the first of August.
They laid a little foundling in a great ?Squire?s bed,
This happen?d on the first of August,
Being pretty, it was very like both Jane and me, ?twas said,
All in the month of August;


And the dozen duck legg?d ladies, mighty glad to find a Haw,
Because poor Jenny disappear?d, they laid it down as law,
That she and I, no matter how, had made a fox?s paw,
All in the month of August.
The Squire would not listen to a word I had to say,
All in the month of August.
And neighbours came and took my little scholars all away.
This was in the month of August;
My wife had died, and each one cried, ?twas my fault,
great and small,
So I shut up my school, and much I grieve my sorrows to
recall.
Lost every boy I?d got through one I never had at all,
And so much for the first of August.
THE POOR SIMPLE CLOWN;
Or, the Countiy man's Touch at the Times, as Sung hy Mr,
Bryant,
Tune.?My Eye and Betty Martin.
I m just come from town, a poor simple clown,
Where I?ve seen all the sights that can be O ;
And 1 have got a sack?full of fashions to bring back,
For ev?ry thing I?ve seen has been the dandy O.
The great folks got such tricks, they never dine till six.
Then down goes the wine, rum and brandy O,
To be stylish too, outright, you must sup at twelve at night.
And to go to bed at daylight?s all the dandy O.
You must talk of plays and balls, and Catalani?s squalls,
With a voice as sweet as sugar candy O !
hree hundred pounds, by gum, for singing is her sum,
For at paying Jackey Bull's all the Dandy O.
Then the Ladies make such rackets, in their little Jockey
Jackets,
I he black, the brown, the fair, and the sandy O;
With their trinkets and their lockets, but the devil of any
pockets.
For a little bag to carry?s all the dandy O.


Then the Beaux strut and stare, with their high frizzled hair,
Some short, some tall, and some bandy O,
With a towel round the neck that at least would hold a peck,
And to nearly stop the whizzen?s all the dandy O.
Now the ladies never fear, when they go to take the air,
For at driving all the gentlemen are handy O,
My lord he mounts with whip ?lest my lady off should trip
And a coat with twenty capes is all the dandy O.
A Duel then to fight makes the gentleman outright,
For nothing more stylish there can be O,
When with an ounce of lead, you are shot thro? the head,
An Iron Coffin then is all the dandy O.
But now I?ve told you all Lunnun?s fashions great and small.
As they?re used by gents and ladies streight or handy O,
Only say that I am right, and ?twill give me much delight,
For when I please my friends I?m quite the dandy O.
OH LORD ! OH LORD!
WHERE?S MR. EPP?S,
' AND ALL HIS HAM AND BEEF?
Written by a Beefeater from Hampton , and Sung by
Mr. Stebb
I came to town the other day.
And stopp?d in every street,
And to each person I did say,
? I something want to eat.?
I look?d about from place to place.
As hungry as a Thief,
And cried ? Oh Lord, where?s Mr. Epps,
With all his Ham and Beef ??
A Man then told me seriously,
He?d tell me where he was,
But ?gad he made a fool of me,
And robb?d me, it is pos.


LONDON ODDITIES ; OR,
So I came back on eating plan.
Still railing at the Thief,
When folks cried ? Lord where?s Mr. Epps,
With all his Ham and Beef??
Still as I came to town to learn,
Says I, ?They shan?t me quiz,
?For Epps is gone?and I?ll discern,
? For certain where he is
When asking a fine Gentleman,
He cried to me with grief,
?Oh Mr. Epps ! oh Mr. Epps,
Where?s all his Ham and Beef??
Then I did meet an Irishman,
And ask?d if he could speak,
He said he?d gone to Ireland,
To feed the poor and weak.
Then off I went quite full of glee,
Which soon was turned to grief.
For thousands there were crying ? Epps,
Oh! where?s your Ham and Beef??
I soon found out his shops were shut,
Because he wanted Beef,
And folks said when they?d shut them up,
They shut him up himself.
But I am sorry for him still.
And since I must be brief,
r
Till he sets up?l?ll cry out ? Epps,
Oh where?s your Ham and Beef??
WHAT?S THE USE OF FRETTING?
Written and Sung by Mr, Alford.
Young Jenny was my heart?s delight,
She lov?d as fond as any O !
Her eyes were like the diamonds bright,
Her lips as sweet as honey O.
i *


In humble cot ray Jenny dwells.
Her friends are kind and setting 0,
To part from her is Sandy?s lot,
Yet what?s the use of fretting, O ?
?Twas o?er the hills she won my heart,
Her pipe she played so cheerly O !
But now from her I?m doom?d to part,
The lass I love so dearly O!
In highland plaid, wi? heart so sad
I kiss?d, shook hands?regretting O !
And bade adieu to fight the foe,
Y et what?s the use of fretting, O ?

OF HOOKEY WALKER,
As given by Mr, Wilkinson, at the English Opera House , and Sadler's
Wells.
My name?s Hookey Walker ?My own name?s Hookey, 1
added Walker, since I set up as a Pedestrian , and bless
you ! I never say a word when I?m walking for fear of my
wind. I?ll tell you how I came to set up in the Pedestrian
line?but to say the truth, I was upon my last legs afore I
corn'd to it?l fail?d in business, and if I hadn?t taken to
walking , I should have been obliged to have run away?lt
was then I first know?d Mr. Bailey?it commenced, in a
very friendly way ?he knock?d at my door one morning, and
when I opened it he show?d me a narrow slip of paper,
hitting me a slap on the shoulder ?? Hookey,? says he,
? you are my PrisonerSo he walked olf with my
Habeas Corpus?but it was a very good thing for me, it
quite altered my way of living; before that are happened,
I led as waned a life, and saw as much of the world as a
blind horse in a mill: but he kindly lock?d me up, gave me
up, gave me plenty o'wittles , and, what was better, nor all
that there , he kept my wife from coming 1o me?for bless you!
1 never enjoyed any thing; she was always giving herself

SONG.
Forty years back my body was born,
My head was bald, and ray figure forlorn,
With mouth all wide, legs bandy and thin,
For mother was squeamish at our lying in
But ( looking at himself ) ?It will do, it will do,
It will do, do,\clo.
I grew out of my rickets a nice little thing,
And lamed soon to talk corriwobble and sing,
A sixpenny song! ?bout a bag full of rye.
And twenty four black birds all baked in one pie.
It will do, &c.
So then that I shoud?nt be thought quite a fool.
For a month I was sent to a Rational school,
Lamed to write in the sand, to spell and all that,
A, B, AB, EB, 18, C-a-t~Cat.
It will do, &c.
When grown to a Man, being little was short,
So then I went courting a girl in our court.
Says she ? You?re so tiny, perhapsyou?ll grow bigger,
But I cannot resist such a neat little
It will do, &c.
I pledged her my trough, swore by the lord Harry,
That I meant, if she?d let me, to settle and marry ;
But when this was done, 1 found out, and was nettled,
That some folks get married, and afterwards settled.
It wont do,

THE THEATRICAL CABINET. 3
DESCRIPTION OF A WOMAN,
Written by G. Colman the younger , and Sung by Mr, Liston,
In describing a Woman each female expects,
1 hat some charm he?ll extract, from her downright defects,
In her squint, a soft languish can sure be discerned,
And her leg, though of wood, might be mighty well turned.
Should her visage exhibit too much of the rose,
Praise the bloom on her cheek, and stop short at her nose;
And if ladies have noses like aces of clubs,
Call them arch looking angels, but don?t talk of snubs.
Of a charmer, whose teeth absentees we may style,
Say how sweetly she purses her lips in a smile,
And, when her red locks, into ringlets she twirls.
Not a word of her carrots ?but cry up her curls.
In each book, let the virtuous fair of each nation.
Be printed with notes of deserved admiration.
While they whose faux pas furnish scandal with data,
Need only be mentioned among the Errata.
VALENTINE?S DAY; OR
THE BULLOCK?S HEART!
A Comic Recitation , as Recited by Mr, Bellamy.
?Twas on the morn of Valentine,
Between the hours of eight and nine,
A butchers boy from Leadenhall,
Drove home his cart, and sung withal,
? O Susan, Susan, ease my smart,
And give me back my bleeding heart!
Those ribbons I have bought are thine,
IP thou wilt be my Valentine.?
As thus he sung, like Cupid blind,
A bullock's heart roll?d out behind;
A baker?s dog, that track?d the cart,
Pleas?d with the morsel, snatch'd the heart;


While Simon sung, in plaintive strain,
? Dear Sue! restore my heart again!? -
At home arrived, he sung no more;
His master rav?d, and stamp?d., and swore;
He reach?d a horsewhip from the pin;
Red, black, and blue, was Simon?s skin;
And, whilst his shoulders long did smart,
He rued the day he lost his heart !
MY EYE AND BETTY MARTIN!
Written and Sung by Mr. Bryant.
Since I?m called upon to sing a song,
Ecod, I will not keep you long.
In case you think that I?m afraid of starting, O!
But if in this I fail,
You?ll cry ? Lord, What can he ail ??
And you?ll say its all my eye and Betty Mart in, O !
Now some folks they try their best,
When you put them to the test.
And they cry ?oh dear, my throat with cold is smarting,
But if you a chorus sing.
Why they?ll make the welkin ring.
Which proves it?s all my eye and Betty Martin, O !
Your married ladies too at times.
If ask?d to sing their little rhymes,
Will say a small duet they?ll take a part in, O !
When abroad they scarce can speak,
But at home?oh, how they squeak,
And that is all my eye and Betty Martin, O !
Your neat old maid of fifty-four,
{ : If ask?d why she?s ne?er wed before.
Will tell you that?s a thing she ne?er took part in, O !
But if she?s fairly task?d,
?Twill be proved she ne?er was ask?d,
Which proves its all my eye and Betty Martin, O!
Iff


They say our placemen of renown.
As well those in, as out of town,
With half their salaries will soon be parting, O !
They say its for the poor,
But of this I?m very sure,
That it?s nothing but my eye and Betty Martin, O !
Then since I thus have tried to do,
j 5.
The very best I can for you,
I hope you?ll think my little song diverting, O !
But should you all be vext,
You no more shall be perplext.
But you?ll own its all my eye and Betty Martin, O !
THE TIME OF DAY,
A new Sony as Sung by Mr. C. Taylor at Vauxhall, fyc.
I came up to town scarce six months ago.
An aukward country clown, but now, sir, quite a beau,
I did but walk about to hear what folks should say,
And, egad, I soon found out what was the time of day.
Too ral 100 ral 100, &c,
I found our black-leg dons with white trowsers hid their
trade,
So I some Wellingtons of father?s flour sacks made,
A pair of stays I chose, my fine shape to display.
With sham collar hid my nose, for that?s the time of day.
Too ral 100 ral 100, &c.
My cravats I wore black, so black I let them keep,
*Twas truly a good knack of making washing cheap;
My hat I cock?d awry, my brutus to display.
With quiz glass to my eye, for that?s the time of day.
Too ral 100 ral 100, &c.
Some fine long bills I run, by promising to pay,
And when they came to dun, why then I run away ;
The Bench was in my rout, there snug three months I lay.
When white wash?d clean, walk?d out, for that?s the time of
day.
Too ral 100 ral 100, &c.
* v�*


I into Bond-street stroll?d, and bow?d to the lord knows who,
Then in some fruit shop lol?d, as fashionables do,
I star?d at peers and clowns, and when they turn?d away,
Crvina: curse it, damn me, zounds, for that?s the time of day.
? * Too ral 100 ral 100, &c.
I met a pretty girl, says she, ? don?t follow me,?
Says ?I my love I shall,? ? I?ll slap your face,? says she.
1 trac?d her North and South, and while she rail?d away,
With kisses stop?d her mouth, for that?s the time of day.
Too ral 100 ral 100, Sec.
Thus having roam?d about, men?s follies to expose,
I very soon found out ?twas time the whole should close;
But now I must take flight, or you perhaps may say.
About this time of night, can?t tell the time of day.

VILLY YITE AND VIDO W YATTS;
OR, THE TRUE LOVER?S JOURNEY TO BOTTOMHOUSE BAY
Written by Mr. Bryant, Sung by Mr. Piercy Roberts.
Villy Yite loved Vidow Yats,
And she did live in Varick-lane
He carried beer, and she scour?d pots,
Vich gave this vorthy man great pain ;
So von day he did say, ? for vhy
Do you rub them until you cry ???
When she slapp?d his face, and said good bye,
You saucy Yilly Yite, O !
Villy Yite stood gazing there, -
Eor this did give poor Yil great pain,
So he pack?d up his trunk with care
And flew from Y arrick-lane.
But he, by some mistake, they say,
Did take a silver spoon avay ;
So he vas sent to Bottomhouse Bay,
Transported Yilly Yite, O !
Villy Yite vas there some time,
A culprit vith an iron chain;
But knowing how to sing and rhyme,


Ihis youth from Varwick-lane.
With arts, and tricks, and the like sich.
He did come back, and vas quite rich.
And married Vats down at Shoreditch ?
Oh ! happy Villy Vite, O !
So Villy Vite, and Vidow Vatts,
A s man and vife, they do remain ;
And children they do get by lots,
All down there in Chick-lane. *
And no one now poor Villy mocks,
For he?s as cunning as a fox ; *
And has full twelve pounds in the stocks
The vealthy Villy Vite, O ! ?

Mr. and Mrs. Pringle ; *

And declared, when he said it, he?d said it: ?

THE SHAVING SHOP,
As Sung by Mr. Sloman.
I?m a dapper little shaver,
Who in manner and behaviour,
Bear the bell from all the trade,
I?m descended from the razors,
Who, as most people say, sirs,
A fortune should have made ;
For be it known, my father
Such numbers used to lather,
And so briskly plied his trade,
And so briskly plied his trade,
That, by hair dressing and shaving,
Tho? his family was craving,
He a decent living made.
(Spoken.) Mr. Razor, says, my poor deceased mother?my duck,-says
mv father 5 vy lovy, I?ve been a thinking as how ve should send Tony to a
lamed seminary, for I likes latin.?A little laming is a dangerous thing
?drink deep, or a fig for laming, says my father, or if he larns anything,
let him lain to shave, and as to drinking deep, he?ll lain that from his
father. So instead of being a man of letters, I can barely tell them, I
am left with all my imperfections on my head, to shave, dress hair, comb
wigs and retail Day and Martin?s blacking, Russia oil, pomatum, and
powder, and instead of wearing a counsellor?s wig, to be constantly em-
ployed in keeping it in curl, while the only bar I ever pleaded at, is the
bar of old Score?em, though I generally contrive to pay my way ; I
wish every tradesman could put his hand to his heart, and say as much
we should then see fewer dividends of a shilling in the pound, and the
credit of old England keep up its ancient vigour.
So with scissars, comb, and lather,
I a sufficient harvest gather,
To keep open the barber?s shop,
The barber?s shop,
The barber?s shop,
To keep open the barber?s shop.


Should my customers e?er vapour,
I shew e?m an old paper,
"Which I beg e?m to peruse ;
Should they find out the cheat, sirs.
Their patience entreat, sirs,
Which they seldom or e?er refuse ;
For by this time I contrive.
My business quick to drive.
And be ready their beards to mow,
And be ready their beards to mow,
Of me your?re making fun.
Sir, I tell you I?ve just done;
Mr. Latherem, here, hollo !
(Spoken.) Mr. Feeble, shall I shave you ? your beard?s in a sad condi-
tion, like the times?-don?t talk to me of the times, for I?ve no time to
talk to you-?How?s Mrs. Feeble, sir ??mind your business, and don?t
pester me?if you move your head, I shall do your business?Mr. Led-
derum, dat blacking you sould me is turned brown, burn my caxon but
I?ve a great desire to give you for your blacking, a black eye ; divel de
drop of Day and Martin was dere, no, by de powers, it was all Betty
Martin?Sir, if you return it?tunder and turf, return it; how, you
shabroon, d?ye think I?m to do dat? didn?t I tell you, do I forgot to men-
tion it, dat I had used every sup of it?well, sir, I hope we shall make
matters up over a glass of Geneva?oh ! and is it dat you?re after ? oh !
musha my darling, you?re a nate little bottle seller, here?s to ould Ire-
land?here?s may animosity be washed away by the soap-suds of obli-
vion, may the voice of the people never be cut in two by the razor of
discord, and may the shop of justice never be shut when honesty knocks
at the door.
So with scissars, comb, and lather, &c.
DAY AND NIGHT SCENES;
OR, THE LARKS AND ROWS OF LIFE IN LONDON,
Written by Mr. Bryant, and Sung by Mr. Buller.
Tune.?� The Bold Dragoon."
Since Life in London?s all the go.
I?ll tell you, if I may,
My own few scenes of bliss and woe,
I?ve been in night and day,
B 2


From public-house to coffee-shop.,
To watch-house, free-and-easy;
At nothing now you?ll find me stop.
Since, if I can, I?ll please ye.
With my comic tale,
Mill and bail.
The Compter and Guildhall, sirs,
Since I have had some comic scenes.
Egad! I?ll sing them all, sirs.
With my bow, wow, what a row, fal, lal de riddy,
riddy, sparkey, larkey, funny, dunny, quizzy,
dizzy, O !
The other morn, I rose from bed,
And walk?d into the street.
When Natty Bill, with bushy head
So swellish, I did meet:
/ He cut along thro? Bishopsgate,
And no poor chap felt bolder ;
But, Lord ! his courage soon was cool?d.
For a bum split on his shoulder.
With bailiff?s tale,
Bill and bail,
Tapping, slapping call, sirs,
Since I have had, &c.
Another day, I had a coach.
To ride to the West End,
To have a game at billiards.
And dine with Dick, my friend ;
But having left the chink behind.
The coachman, rude and rough.
Just broke my nose, and then he said,
You find I?m up to snuff.
With his crack and smack.
My nose alack,
He broke, and my shirt did mawl, sirs.
Since I have had, &c.


Now free-and-easy being gay,
I went one night with glee ;
I drank, and all my cash did pay.
Then who so drunk as me ?
But I walk?d along so grand,
As shop-boy folks did book me ;
And the watchman must have thought the same,
For he to the Compter took me.
With his sword stick.
Cross as Nick,
The Compter beds are small, sirs.
Since I have had, &c.
W
Next morning I was sent away ;
But mark the climax now,
Some cruel things my wife did say,
And kick?d up such a row !'
She says I am a wicked man,
And loses all her charms,
So with her nails she claws my face,
Just to paint her coat of arms.
With her pouting lips,
Warm tear drips.
Kiss, then on necks fall, sirs,
Since I have had, &c.
MY WIFE,
SHE DIED THREE MONTHS AGO,
%
As Sung hy Mr.
My wife she died three months ago,
And left poor I to mourn,
My wife she died three months ago,
And now I sleep alone.
I?ll banish sorrow from my mind,
By wetting of my clay.
And should 1 meet a lass that?s kind,
I?ll have a wedding day.


LONDON ODDITIES ; OR,
SONG FOR AN ODD FELLOW,
DESCRIBING THE ODD METHOD OF MAKING.
Tuue ?Madam
Most noble, I?ll do my endeavour.
To give you a chaunt of my own;
But fear it will not be so clever
As many I?ve heard and have known ;
There?s an odd kind of circumstance in it,
As ever I seed in my days,.
And if you?ll attend, why. I?ll sing it
As well as in my power lays.
Rumti, &c.
One day (or one night, if you please,)
When I was a little like mellow,
I went to a neighbour?s for ease,
And he ax?d I to be an odd fellow;
But when they began their droll play.
Oh ! the rattling of chains seemed so rum,
I feign would be running away ;
But they shov?d me slap into the room.
Rumti, dec.
Then a fellow laid hold of me now,
And another says put down your hat;
Then they told me to make a low bow:
Gad, I wondered what next they?d be at;
Then a kind of a sort of an oath,
They made me repeat word for word,
And to break it, I?m sure I am loath.
For such a one I never heard.
Rumti, &c.
Then before me they draw?d up a curtain.
And there sat an old man a snoring,
I thought he had got a red shirt on,
But ?twas summut else hanging before him;


He told me I?d nothing to fear,
So then I began for to smile ;
They said they would cut off my ear.
And held up the?.r swords all the while.
Rumti, &c.
Thfcn the Noble Grand shew?d me the signs,
And he told me one thing and another,
I paid two and nine-pence for fines.
And then they all called me their brother ;
But before I had sat very long,
For fear I should be of no use,
They called upon I, for a song,
And X did?nt make any excuse.
(Spoken.) ?No, not I, ?I likes to behave pretty, so I opened
mouth, and began singing
Rumti, &c.
THE FOX, AND THE ASS,
As Sung by Mr. Fitzwilliam,
An ass found the skin of a lion,
Which he was determined to try on, ?
Then the beast all run frightened away;
When the donkey, to scare them the more,
Like a lion attempted to roar,
So set up a hideous bray.
When Reynard the fox passing by.
Did to his mock majesty cry,
? Your skin for a lion?s may pass.
But the character if you?d maintain.
More silent, you?d better remain.
For your tongue will proclaim you an ass.?
? MISERICORDE!?
OR, THE FRENCHMAN AND THE EXECUTIONER,
A Comic Tale,
As delivered by Mr. Fuller at various Concerts,
Since I am call?d upon to night,
Either to sing, or to recite;


I?ll just engage your kind attention,
To what I am about to mention :
A Frenchman once, at some assizes,
(T?was Nottingham the Muse surmises ?i
Fell justly by the course of law, ,}
A victim for un grand faux pas.
When he approached the fatal tree
( Une autre Place de Grave pour lui),
And when Jack Ketch prepar?d to tie
The noose that did exalt him high,
Instead of praying to the Lord, * *
Monsieur exclaim?d, ? /?
? Measure the cord r replied Jack Ketch ?
? ea� ure the cord yourself, you wretch.?
otill �< Misericorde /? was all his cry
Ah, Misericorde ! dat I should die;
Ah, Misericorde! good folks, good bye
Measure the cord, you smv?lin�r cur l??
Rejoin?d the executioner, ?
? * Tis long enough?l know ?twill do
To hang a score such rogues as you ;
And since you?ve been a thieving elf,
Measure the cord, I say, yourself.?
Then as he tied the dreadful noose,
The Frenchman he did much abuse,
M hen poor Monsieur in sin not hardened.
Was soon cut down,?and kindly pardoned.
PARODY,
ON WHISTLE AND I?LL COME TO THEE MY LAD.
Oh waible, and I?ll come to you my dear,
ti he V he wa , tch d �g s are still > and the moon?s shining clear;
1 hough guardian and governess all disapprove.
Oh warble, and I ? ll come to my love.
Chmb o?er the high wall when ye come to steal me,
And soon in the garden, Giovanni, I?ll be ?
Chmb o?er the high wall, and let nobody see ;
And come not as if you were coming to me.


THE IRISHAMAN, AND THE PRIEST,
A Comic Tale.
An Irishman, his name was Pat,
(When drunk no man was madder;)
One day from house top he fell flat,
From off* a Bricklayer?s ladder ;
And being hurt as people say.
To the hospital they did take him,
While his friends who thought he dead did lay
Demanded him, ?to wo,ke him.
But when they got him fairly out,
They stopped to take a noggin,
And whiskey pour?d up Paddy?s snout,
Before they thought of jogging.
Thus Pat revived from death so still,
And home was quickly carried,
When his wife found out poor pat was ill,
( For Pat, you must know, was married;)
Then father Paul to Paddy went,
Who sick in bed did lie,
This pious consolation gave,
That all men must die.
? Arrah ! cried Pat, that is the thing,
Which grieveth me full sore,
If I could die a dozen times,
My grief would then be o?er.?
THEY SAY THAT
LOVE ENSLAVES THE HEART,
?\ *
Written by Mr. W. Bellamy, Sung by Mr. Gibbon.
Air. ?Oh say not Woman?s heart is bought.
They say that love enslaves the heart,
Yet sure none would resist it.
*Tis true, it yields a balm, a smart,
?Tis woman can assist it;


For with her frowns the smart wo feel,
And feign from life would sever;
But in her smiles our fate we seal,
And live and love for ever.
Grant me but in lovers sphere to move,
That I may sip its pleasure,
Near from its balmy sweets to rove.
Its mandates I would treasure.
Far from that savage breast I?d fly,
Where love could enter never,
Dear woman?s smiles to gain I?d try,
And live and love for ever.
?WHO CADES ??
Sung by Mr. Slader.
i �bberI y l an dsmen, to gratitude strangers,
Still curse their unfortunate stars,
Why, what would they say did they try but the dangers
Encounter?d by true-hearted tars ?
If life s vessel they put ?fore the wind, or they tack her.
Or whether bound here or there,
Give ?em sea-room, good fellowship, grog, and tobacker,
Well then damme if Jack cares where.
riien your stupid old quidnuncs, to hear ?em all clatter.
The devil can?t tell you what for.
Though they don?t know a gun from a marline-spike, chatter
About and consarning of war !
While for king, wife, and friend, he?s through every thing
With duty still proud to comply,
So he gives but the foes of old England a drubbing
Why then?damme if Jack cares why. 8
And then, when good fortune has crown?d his endeavours,
?Awd he comes home with shiners galore j
what if so be he should lavish his favours
On ev?ry poor object 'long shore ?


Since money?s the needle that points to good nature.
Friend, enemy, false, or true,
So it goes to relieve a distress?d fellow-creature.
Well then?damme if Jack cares who.
Don?t you see how some different thing ev?ry one?s twigging.
To take the command of a rib ;
feome are all for the breast-work, and some for the rigging.
And some for the cut of her jib ;
Though poor, some will take her in tow to defend her,
And again, some are all for the rich;
As for I, so she?s young, her heart honest and tender.
Why then?damme if Jack cares which.
Why now, if they go for to talk about living,
My eyes, why a little will sarve ;
Let each a small part of his pittance be giving,
And who in this nation can starve ?
Content?s all the thing?rough or calm be the weather.
The wind on the beam or the bow,
So honestly he can splice both ends together,
Why then?damme if Jack cares how.
And then for a bring up, d?ye see, about dying,
On which such a racket they keep.
What argufies if in a church-yard you?re lying,
Or find out your grave in the deep ?
Of one thing we?re certain, whatever our calling,
Death will bring us all up ; and what then ?
So his conscience?s tackle will bear overhauling.
Why then?damme if Jack cares when.
LOVELY WOMAX.
Pour et Centre.
(original.)
What gives new beauty to the day ?
Strews roses in the throrny way ?
Makes even hoary winter gay ?
Yis lovely, ever lovely, woman!

So when this trembling heart of mine,
At life?s disasters would repine,
The calm subside as I recline
Upon thy bosom, lovely woman!
But rouse this lovely angel?s ire?
Oppose her will?thwart her desire?
Good Heavens ! what fury and what fire!
Proceed from thee, O lovely woman !
That heart-appalling word, ? Obey,?
Drives half thy loveliness away;
Turns thy warm heart as cold as clay,
n Within thy bosom, lovely woman!
Yet those who truly lovely are,
Midst smiles and frowns, through ease and care.
Are ever gentle, kind and fair;
Ihe same sweet, lovely, , woman !
These gods demons sent.
These to appease,? those to torment:
An angel and a termagant,
Both in the form of lovely woman!
