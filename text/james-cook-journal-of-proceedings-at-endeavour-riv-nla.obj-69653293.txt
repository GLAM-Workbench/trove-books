? Notwithstanding I had in the name of His
Majesty taken possession of several places upon this
coast, I now once more hoisted English Colours, and
in the name of His Majesty King George the Third
took possession of the whole Eastern Coast from the
above Latitude down to this place, by the name of
New South Wales, together with all the Bays, Harbours,
Rivers, and Islands situate upon the said coast; after
which we fired three volleys of small arms, which
were answered by the like number from the ship.
This done, we set out for the ship, but some time in
getting on board on account of a very rapid Ebb Tide.?

?We are to consider that we see this country in
the pure state of Nature; the Industry of Man has had
nothing to do with any part of it, and yet we find all
such things as nature hath bestowed upon it in a
flourishing state. In this Extensive Country it can
never be doubted but what most sorts of Grain,
Fruits, Roots, &c., of every kind would flourish here
were they once brought hither, planted and cultivated
by the hand of Industry; and here are Provender
for more cattle at all seasons of the year than ever
can be brought into this Country.?
Extract from Journal k e Pt hy Captain James Cook, during the voyage of H.M.S.
? Endeavour,? 1768-1771. This passage was written hy Cook m August,
1770, after he had completed the navigation of the entire east coast of Australia.
In March, 1923, the Commonwealth Government secured for the people of Australia the Journal kept by Captain James Cook during his famous
voyage of discovery in H.M.S. Endeavour; from which have been reprinted these passages, in the hope that there may be kindled, in the minds
of the children of Australia, an interest in that Great Navigator to whom we owe the possession of our Australian Continent.
Presented hy the Committee of the Commonwealth National Library.
