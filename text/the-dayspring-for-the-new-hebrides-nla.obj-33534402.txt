Dependent on the kind offices of other Missions for some
years, the Missionaries at length, so far back as 1855,
launched a modest proposal to build a schooner for the
work. She was named the John Knox, and cost the
slender sum of £320. Her voyages embraced only the five
Southern Islands; and, after several years of useful work,
the growing needs of the Mission found her too small.
At that time Dr. Paton was driven from Tanna. In
accordance with the urgent solicitation of his fellow Mis-
sionaries he undertook a tour in Australia, and succeeded
in raising the greater part of the £3,800 needed to defray
the cost of a new and larger vessel. Subsequently, by his
efforts mainly, the sum of £2,000 a year, required for her
support, was also guaranteed. The ship was built in Nova
Scotia, and named the Dayspring.
Cl]e “DaYsprtng/'
In his Autobiography Dr. Paton writes of his first
sight of the new ship in 1865, as follows ; “I went with
a kind of trembling joy to have my first look at the
Dayspring, like a sailor getting the first peep of the child
born to him while far away at sea. . . I found her to
be a beautiful two-masted brigantine—a thing of beauty,
a white-winged Angel set a-floating by the pennies of the
children to bear the Gospel to these sin-darkened, but sun-
lit, Southern Isles. To me she became a sort of living
thing, the impersonation of a living throbbing love in the
hearts of thousands of ‘ shareholders ’ ; and I said with a
deep indestructible faith, ‘ The Lord has provided, and the
Lord will provide. ’ ”
The vessel was of eminent service to the Mission. Her
work was to call at Stations, land the year’s stores and


mails for the Mission families, visit Native Teachers, and
make efforts for new openings by friendly calls at Heathen
islands. Besides these services, the visit of the ship gave
moral backing to the solitary Missionary among Heathen
savages. It did the same to the Native Teachers. It ex-
ercised a vigilance in the interests of Humanity over the
doings of all other vessels trading in the group,
and let white settlers know that philanthropy and
religion were observant of their dealings with the Natives.
The work of the vessel was confined solely to the Mission.
Any suggestions of commercial transactions or carriage of
freight were resented by the trading vessels as interfering
with their regular service. Competing firms were always
ready to mark any preference shown to one as against
another. Even a return for an obligation was liable to
be construed into an attempt to undersell the fair market
value of goods. Thus, at the outset, it was found neces-

this to have been the wisest and best course in the
interests of all concerned.
In 1873, during one of the most terrific hurricanes that
ever passed over the island, the good Dayspring, lying in
harbour at Aneityum, was driven upon the reefs and
became a total wreck.

traders, whose deeds had too often caused the white man
to be justly loathed and dreaded throughout the group.
Thus the Mission developed. Northward, on island after
island, little Mission Stations were built, and needed sup-
plies and visiting; until, in 1884, the second Dayftpring
had become too small for the increased and ever extending
work of the Mission, and a larger and faster ship was
imperatively needed.
Dr. Paton was again summoned from the field, and
“commissioned” to visit Britain to raise, if possible,
£6,000, to enable the Australian churches to build a Steam
Auxiliary Mission Ship for the requirements of the New
Hebrides. The last chapter of his “ Autobiography ”
tells the story of his labours and success. He returned
to Australia with the £6,000, and the money was handed
over to the Victorian Church.
But new difficulties arose. It was found, after calcula-
tion, that about £l,OOO more would be required per annum
to support the Steam Auxiliary, than had been needed for
the sailing ship. The old Dayspring cost about £2,000 per
annum. The New Steam Auxiliary would cost, for her
annual support, about £3,000. Again, not long thereafter,
a Avave of severe financial depression and loss swept over
Australia, necessitating a further postponement of the
new scheme. A crisis was reached, however, in 1889-90,
when the second Dayspring was cast upon a reef and so
badly damaged that the Marine Board condemned her as
unfit for sea.
Thereupon an Australian Company was subsidized to do
the work of the Mission, while carrying on its commercial
enterprise. The history of this temporary expedient may

be written in the words of the Lord Jesus, “No man can


serve two masters . . .he will hold to the one and
despise the other.” Henceforth, the provision of a
new Steam Auxiliary Mission Vessel became the burden
of Dr. Paton’s soul.
“ The Finger of God,” says Dr. Inglis, one of the fathers
of the New Hebrides Mission, “ has been conspicuous in
the history of this Mission from first to last. In the way
in which agencies have been brought together, there has
been so much of the doings of the Lord, and so little of
the doings of man, that I cannot but regard it as an
earnest of what the Lord intends to do for us and by us,
unless we become criminally slothful.”
Thus, on his last tour in Britain (1893-94), Dr. Paton
was bound to mention the difficulty of raising the extra
£I,OOO a year for the maintenance of the Steam Auxiliary
Vessel, in explaining to subscribers of former years, why
her building was delayed. His prayers had not ceased
during the time of silence, and now the Finger of God was
revealed afresh on behalf of the needed ship. In response
to the words of the Missionary voluntary contributions
flowed in. A scheme for raising help by the issue of
Threepenny Shares in the ship was organized. A testing
circular, signed by representative Christian friends, was
issued, to see what support from adults could be counted
upon ; and, in less than twelve months, so much interest
had been created, that the Missionary felt guided of the

service of the New Hebrides Mission.

The rooms are fitted up in a suitable manner for the
service of the Mission in tropical seas. The sleeping
accommodation, hall, and dining saloon being amidships
forward of the engines, the vibration is reduced to a
minimum, and liability to sea-sickness lessened. Forward
under the forecastle there is ample accommodation for
European and native crew, and for teachers. The vessel
has a clipper stem with figure head ; three masts and
square-rigged in the foremast, and with sufficient sail area
to sail under canvas, instead of steam, if so desired. The
engines are placed aft, and are to be fitted by Messrs. Hall,
Brown, Buttery & Co., Govan. They will be triple expan-
sion surface condensing, having cylinder 10 inches, 16
inches, and 26 inches by 21 inches stroke. Boiler, 10 feet
diameter by 9 feet long, 200 lbs. working pressure. Bevis’s
patent feathering propeller fitted.
“ The vessel has been designed on fine lines to give a good
speed, and also carry a large dead weight cargo. Fitted
with all the latest improvements for the quick loading and
discharging of cargo. She has large coal bunkers, to
enable her to steam long distances where there are no
coaling ports, and water ballast in the fore and aft peaks,
and midship tanks for running light. She presents a
graceful appearance in the water, and should prove a
valuable acquisition to the Mission in the New Hebrides.”

steam is employed in the Mission Vessel; but chiefly to
avoid danger and difficulties in going into or out of
harbour, and to keep her from drifting into peril when
caught in calms. While among the Islands she is continu-
ally either entering or leaving harbours, and steering
through narrow channels. She is often becalmed in cir-
cumstances where a few hours’ steaming would save a
day, or it might be a week’s detention, or where a current
might drift her into serious danger. Both the first and
the second John Williams were lost in calms—the first
at Danger Island, and the second at Savage Island.”
The coast is rugged and dangerous. Reefs, coral rocks,
and shallows abound. There are dreaded currents also
between many of the Islands.
This map, showing a few miles of the coast of Malekula,
will be helpful in leading to a clearer realisation of the
difficulties of the coast, and of the way that islets are
dotted along the shore.
The west coast of Malekula has no Mission Station at
present. A visit was made there about three years ago to
see what could be done. The population was found to be
considerable, and it is said that no less than fourteen
different dialects, so distinct as almost to be called lan-
guages, are spoken by the various coast tribes along the
west side of the Island !
The number of different languages and dialects spoken
on the whole group is estimated at the amazing number of
fifty-three! They may, however, it is thought, be reduced
to twenty-three or twenty-five for purposes of translation.
By persistent and patient labours, the Missionaries have
already translated and printed, in sixteen of these lan-
guages, either the whole or portions of the Bible.


Cl]e “ at IDork*
Of the need for the ship, the past history of the Mis-
sion is the best evidence; but a glance at the map of
the Islands (see page 8) should make that indisputably
clear to any unprejudiced mind. The Islands, large and
small, are fifty or more in number. The distance N.E.
from Sydney to Aneityum is 1,300 miles, and the group
extends from North to South, over 400 miles of ocean.
To give some idea of the voyages among the Islands,
which the vessel will have to accomplish, four times at
least in each year, the following particulars of distances
may be useful :
From Aneityum to Futuna is 50 miles.
From Futuna to Aniwa is 35 miles.
From Aniwa to Tanua (Port Resolution) is 18 miles.
From Tanna (Port Resolution) to Eromanga is 50
miles.
From Eromanga to Efate is 80 miles
From Efate to Nguna is 16 miles.
From there to Mataso is 12 miles, and to Makura is 9
miles.
While from Nguna to Santo (the most northerly Island)
is 150 miles ; many large Islands intervene between
Nguna and Santo (Malekula, Ambrym, &c.) at shorter
distances.
Santo Island measures 70 miles by 40 miles ; and
Malekula is about 40 miles long. Inland, most of the
Islands are covered with dense bush on high hills and
mountains, and the Heathen bush tribes are numerous
and fierce.
“ It is not (says Dr. Inglis) to secure speed when sailing
though that is a consideration on the open sea) that

different dialects, so distinct as almost to be called lan-
guages, are spoken by the various coast tribes along the
west side of the Island !
The number of different languages and dialects spoken
on the whole group is estimated at the amazing number of
fifty-three! They may, however, it is thought, be reduced
to twenty-three or twenty-five for purposes of translation.
By persistent and patient labours, the Missionaries have
already translated and printed, in sixteen of these lan-
guages, either the whole or portions of the Bible.


Cl?e Difficulties of ttye DTissioru
The isolation of the New Hebrides Islands, their rugged
coasts and treacherous currents, and the dense bush on
hill and mountain inland, render travelling into the
interior almost impossible, and along the coast always
tedious and dangerous. Being withal a region of active
volcanoes with many malarial districts, and a humid
tropical climate, the field is physically the most trying.
Add to these difficulties the diversity of tongues and the
division of the natives into tribes—fierce where still heathen,
loving war, worshipping revenge, naked and cannibal.
Still further add the troubles from without, by the infamous
trading in drink and firearms, the inhuman Kanaka traffic,
and the joint punitive Commission over this No-Man’s -
-Land by two Great Powers; and the New Hebrides Mission
may well claim to be the most difficult in the Pacific, if
not in the whole world.
But the vision in “ the Revelation of Jesus Christ” is a
sure prophecy of ultimate success. There must stand
around the Throne of the Triumphal Christ, as represent-
ing His Universal Conquest, representatives of every
kindred and nation and people and tongue. Thus, in His
Providence, God sent John Williams to the group to die
a Martyr’s death, —sealing these Islands by blood as fore-
ordained for salvation, and thrusting upon Britain her
share of responsibility to that end. Canada, also, by her
martyred Gordons, divides the honours and burdens of
the task of conquest ; and Australasia, faithful to her
trust in these Islands, as near her shores almost as New
Zealand, owns and realises and has faithfully discharged
so divine a responsibility.

Dr. Paton has left upon his
brother, the Rev. James Paton,
8.A., of St. Paul’s, Glasgow, the
editor of the famous Autobio-
graphy, and his fellow labourers
the Hon. Secs, of the John G.
Paton Mission Fund, the burden
of collecting the £l,OOO annually
(one-third of the total cost of
maintenance) needed from Britain
for the upkeep of the Ship.
In faith that this duty is of
God, and in reliance upon the
many kind promises of God’s
people, the responsibility has been accepted, and the
honorary helpers in Britain stand committed to the
charge.
They count on your sympathy in this voluntary task.
The New Hebrides is an Island Mission that should appeal
to an Island nation. Britain’s sons led the van, died,
suffered, and still hold forth the Banner of the Prince of
Peace amongst these Islands. Brothers have followed
where brothers fell, and sons where fathers agonised..
Youth and manhood, with true devotion, still bear lonely
exile. The spirit of the martyrs survives in the New
Hebrides.
Our ship is their dayspeing, bringing cheering beams
and hopes of a brighter day. Home and Fatherland are
all in this little ship. Children far away send their love
