Most people are aware that Mr. John Stuart Mill has
recently published a little book entitled ? The Subjec-
tion of Women,? in which he has effectively proved
this position?? that the principle which regulates the
existing social relations between the sexes ?the legal
subordination of the one sex to the other?is wrong
in itself, and now one of the chief hindrances to
human improvement; and that it ought to be replaced
by a principle of perfect equality, admitting no power
or privilege on the one side, nor disability on the
other.? Mr. Mill has restricted himself mainly to
showing most forcibly that the position ot abject
slavery in which women arc now held, is utterly un-
just, being based on the principle that might makes
right; and he argues strongly for the abolition of all
the legal disabilities of women.
Some might wish that he had extended his plan,
and entered upon the natural history of this subjec-
tion, and its causes ; as well as exhibited more fully
its pernicious result But he probably rightly thought
that his book would be much more widely read in its
present shape, and also that it would meet with les*
antagonism. Possibly for these reasons it is calculated
to do most good, and to influence the largest number
to a greater or less extent. But I imagine that the


members of this Association are so much more
advanced in liberal principles, that less reserve is
necessary in dealing with the general question here,
than Mr. Mill thought desirable towards the British
public; and I think I should have his support in
advocating in such a field as this, a much more radical
reform of the relation of the sexes.
But I prefer to base my objections to those relations,
upon the principle of utility , rather than that of justice;
and for the following reasons:?Justice appears to me
to be not only a wholly inadequate test of right and
wrong, but by being made to supersede and obscure
the true one, to become a mischievous delusion ; and
I undertake to show that those who nominally make
it the test of right and wrong, actually, though un-
consciously, make utility, real or imaginary, the crite-
rion of justice. The principle of utility is thus of
anterior and superior value. I must however explain
this. We hang a murderer. Why ? we cannot res-
tore the dead to life, as strict justice would require ;
and if some of the ancients sacrificed the murderer to
the manes of the deceased, ivc have long since quite
relinquished the notion that we can annul a crime by
imitating or repeating it. We recognise that the de-
ceased cannot be affected by our act, and we hang the
murderer solely for our own security; to deter in-
tending murderers from following the example set
them. By so doing, we recognise the principle of
utility ; and also, that men?s future acts will be affected
thereby ?that they are, in fact, produced by circum-
stances. Hence it follows that circumstances produced
the murderer?s act, which was the indirect or direct
result of his constitution, state of knowledge, and
collateral events combined ; severally constituting
causes culminating in the murder as their effect. This
is an important point, and in fact, the key to all


moral questions. We all, practically, admit that every
event is the necessary effect of its antecedents or causes.
For all knowledge is nothing but the apprehension
of various applications of the axiom, that under given
conditions, the same result must inevitably follow.
To suppose any fact to have occurred differently, in-
volves that its causes must have been different also?
their causes also again, and so on, throughout the
preceding eternity. Nothing, therefore, could have
happened, or can happen otherwise than as it did or
does. Either this is infallibly true, or else experience
can furnish no certainty or even a balance of proba-
bilities, as to the consequences of events, and know-
ledge is impossible and absurd. Every intelligent
act," however, is based upon invincible conviction of
the uniformity and inviolability of causation, and ex-
perience consistently justifies this confidence. This
being the case, however, to punish a murderer who is
but the tool of circumstances, would be distinctly
unjust , in the moral meaning of the word ; and the
murderer should go altogether free, if on the principle
of utility , wo were not to make a scarecrow of him, to
deter probable or possible future murderers from
murdering. Thus, whore the principle of justice Mis
us, we instinctively fall back upon that of utility,
which is also the real basis of justice, where that prin-
ciple serves our turn.
Now I grant that Mr. Mill has irrefragably proved
on the principle of justice, that our treatment of
women is cruelly unjust, but I think he has scarcely
given sufficient prominence to the pernicious conse-
quences which thence ensue to society generally, and
toman in particular. Condorcet, eighty years
ago, anticipated Mr. Mill?s views, and mine also, in a
noble passage of his Sketch of the Progress of the
Human Intellect. He considered that one of the most


essential requisites to human happiness and progress,?
was the destruction of those prejudices which establish
between the sexes an inequality of rights, which is
disastrous even to the one that it appears to favor.
He asserted that that inequality originates solely in
the abuse of force , which no sophistry can excuse. He
held that men would never be well educated till their
mothers were so also; that equality would abolish
many crimes caused by present relations of the sexes,
and would produce an improvement of manners?
impossible while the criteria wore false modesty and
religious terrorism. Now I think that this view of
the origin of the inequality, in the abuse of force, re-
quires a little revision. It seems to me that the word
abuse is applicable rather to the maintenance than to
the origin of the inequality. It would be more discrimi-
native and accurate to say, that ignorant man, emerging
from savagery, on first acquiring ideas of property, de-
sired to monopolise the services and the person of woman,
being naturally ignorant of one of the last and greatest
discoveries of modern civilisation ; namely, that the
state of equality, of absence of restriction, was best
for both, being favorable and necessary to the highest
state of activity of each. Being ignorant, and the
strongest, he naturally enslaved woman, and to the
same extent he demoralised himself as a necessary
consequence. To say he abused his force, implies that
he consciously oppressed poor woman, and profited by
doing so ; whereas the injury to her was as uninten-
tional as the equal if not greater injury to himself; ?
both were the inevitable results of ignorance. That
ignorance to a lamentable extent still exists, and Mr.
Mill and others arc laboring to expose and abolish it.
Mr. Mill remarks that the progress of civilisation
has brought about a very slow but constant ameliorar
fton of the condition of woman; not I think, from


any feeling in man of justice, but rather from an
unconscious instinctive selfishness, or more enlightened
self-interest; the only thing indeed in him, from which
she has anything to hope. To a savage, civilised or
uncivilised, she is a mere beast of burthen. It is
curious (and all the more so when we remember lhat
at the time to which I am about to allude, our ances-
tors were very far behind the Hindoos in civilisation),
to regard poor woman?s status according to the earliest
records that I have lately been able to find of the then
highest phases of refinement. In the ancient Brah-
minic laws these sentences occur among others even
more opprobrious, too much so to quote :?A man,
both day and night, must keep his wife so much in
subjection, that she by no means be mistress of her
own actions ; if the wife have her own free will, not-
withstanding she be sprung from a superior caste, she
will yet behave amiss.? Again?? Women have six
qualities; first, an inordinate desire for jewels and fine
furniture, handsome clothes, and nice victuals ; the
second, immoderate lust; the third, violent anger; the
fourth, deep resentment, (i.c., no person knows the sen-
timents concealed in their heart); the fifth, another
person?s good appears evil in their eyes ; the sixth,
they commit bad actions.? Yet?even in that condi-
tion of society, the law distinctly provided that a
woman should hold property in many ways in which
in England now, she cannot I Let us remark here that
these laws were those of a priesthood , a class which has
always refined and disguised tyranny, by availing
itself of the most powerful of all the engines of ter-
rorism?the imagination of the weak-minded, the one
to which unfortunately enslaved woman is naturally
most susceptible. Hear, to the same effect, a distin-
guisln d modern divine, who adopts Condoreet?s idea
of woman?s degradation being the result of an abuse


of force, and corroborates my own, that religion has
always been a principal means of effecting it. (Theo-
dore Parker?s ? Theism, Atheism, and the Popular
Theology,? p. 135). ?In all forms of religion that I
know, from the book of Moses to the book of Mormon,
from Confucius to Calvin, woman is degraded before
man; for in all forms of religion hitherto force has been
preferred above all things, and the great quality which
has been ascribed to God has been an omnipotence of
force. That is the thing which Christendom has wor-
shipped these many hundred years,?not love ; a
mighty head, a mighty arm, ?not a mighty heart.
As force is preferred before all things in God, so in
man ; hence in religion ; thence in all human affairs.
And as woman has less force than man, less force of
muscle, less force of mind, has more fineness
of body, superior fineness of intellect, has eminence
of conscience, eminence of affection, eminence of
the religious power, eminence of soul; as she is
inferior to man in his inferior elements, and
superior in his higher,?so she has been prostrated
before him. Her right of nature has been trodden
under foot by his might of nature. This degradation
of woman is obvious in ail forms of religion; it is
terribly apparent in the Christian church. The gospels
Paul and Peter, the book of Eevelation, have small
respect for woman, little regard for marriage. The
Bible makes woman the inferior of man, his instrument
of comfort, his medium of posterity; created as an
afterthought, for an ? help-meet' for man, because, l it
was not good for man ?to be alone' Marriage in the
New Testament is only for time ; in the kingdom of
heaven they neither marry nor are given in marriage
it is a low condition here ; celibacy is the better of the
two ; it is not good to marry; only?all men cannot
receive this saying. The Christ was represented as


born with no human father?his birth a slap at wed-
lock. The Christian church has long taught that
marriage is a little unholy ; and woman was bid to be
ashamed of that part of her nature which made her a
daughter first, and afterwards a wife and mother.
What do Jerome, Augustine, Aquinas, and the Popes
say of connubial love ? They have Paul as warrant
for their unnatural creed. All this depreciation of
woman comes from the idea of a god with whom might
is more than right; the idea of a god that is mighty
in his head, in his outstretched arm, but feeble in his
conscience, and feeble in his heart; a most unmotherly
god!??
Observe how Theodore Parker himself, with true
priestly cunning, flatters poor woman to the top of her
bent?but his own God was a male after all ! The
ancient Greeks made no such invidious distinction;
they deified their standards of excellence without re-
gard to sex.
But I wish to point out that our sexual customs
are not our own invention or selection ; they are no
achievement of modern knowledge or perfected civili-
zation, but are merely a legacy from local savagery;
the very strength of the deeply-rooted popular preju-
dices ou the subject is ample proof that we inherit them
from the most remote and uncouth barbarism through
countless prehistoric ages. Christianity attempted no
alteration, or at any rate effected no improvement in
the tyranny it found already firmly established. It has
certainly made woman more powerless and hopeless
than before, by riVetting the fetters of marriage upon
her for life, and depriving her of the small rights to
property yielded elsewhere; and the poor consolation
of a little extra flattery ?of merely verbal adulation?
I can only regard as the addition of insult to injury.
Monogamy we received from Paganism in frigid


Europe ; where it was adopted, sanctified, and called
its own by exploitcring Christianity, which exag-
gerated its principle of tyrannical monopoly to establish
and confirm the slavery in which it held both mind
and body. Polygamy is indigenous to warmer Asia,
and is just as much inculcated and utilised by priest-
craft for its own purposes. Evil as both are ?the one
being a concentrated, the other an extended tyranny ?
the principle of monopoly, the pernicious basis of both,
is older lhan cither, and will therefore be more difficult
to subvert. But subverted it must be, by civilisation,
reason, and time. Man will at last sec that to the
same extent that he enslaves or monopolises woman,
and restricts her freedom, he demoralises himself. The
principle laid down in Wilhelm von Humboldt?s
? Sphere and Duties of Government,? is becoming
daily more widely apprehended and popular:?that
the State should promote intellectual activity, and do
so solely by removing obstacles to activity. To restrict
one class to benefit another, must really be disastrous
to both. Buckle has expressed this in very strong
terms, and confirmed it powerfully by illustrations.
He says the only laws which ever did unmixed good,
are those which repealed others. Both authors concur
in recommending the abolition of everything like res-
triction upon free action, and in showing how enact-
ments of the kind inevitably defeat their own purposes.
Buckle, in particular, shows lucidly how the laws in
England respecting oaths are a source of national cor-
ruption, have diminished the value of human testimony,
and shaken the confidence which men naturally placa
in their fellow creatures; how legislators in every
attempt to uphold particular principles, have not only
failed, but have brought about results diametrically
opposite to those which they proposed. He shows
that their laws in favor of industry have injured in-


dustry; those in favor of religion have favored
hypocrisy, those to secure truth have encouraged per-
jury, and those enacted to prevent usury and keep
down the interest of money have invariably in-
creased usury and raised interest. And this is
true of, and applicable to, every department of
social regulation?of conventional custom as well as
of law. Thus ?by arrogating to himself a monopoly
of one or more women, and maintaining the idea that
infringement of it is a kind of sacrilege, man precludes
himself from remedying any matrimonial mistake he
may have made in his inexperienced, mistaught, and
precipitate youth. By making women slaves generally,
he has caused himself to inherit the degraded feelings
and aborted capacities of a slave. Mr. Mill has abun-
dantly shown the enormous evil results of constant
association with our slaves; and that association on
any oilier than equal terms must be injurious and fatal
to both, and most deteriorating to the superior. I shall
here, therefore, only strongly recommend his book to
careful attention. But by the factitious notions of
modesty which man has invented and encouraged to
enthrall the minds as well as the bodies of the other
sex, he has made himself, as well as them, the victims
of dreadful diseases from which few are exempt;
while by superadding exclusive permanent monogamy,
ho has succeeded in producing ?in Prostitution , a
mental and physical evil which exceeds everything
else in the appalling degradation in which both male
and female participators arc involved.
But what is mo'dcsty ? In any notion of modesty,
is not indecency an essential clement or part ? Is it
not altogether a mystic creation of a morbid imagina-
tion ? ? To him that csteemeth anything to be unclean,
to him (and to him only) it is unclean.? Thus
modesty suggests and creates its own opposite.


There is also another essentially vitiating constituent
of the idea of modesty, which I feel can never be
compensated by any or all of the advantages which
may be imagined to flow from it. The conception of
modesty involves that acts may be good and virtuous
if done in secret, that are dishonorable and vile, if
done in the light of day and before the world. This
is inseparable from the idea of modesty; and this alone
would make me suspect and contemn it as the very
antithesis and foe of all ingenuousness and truth, ?
even if I were wholly ignorant of the gigantic evils
which are its direct results. Morally,?by a morbid
fear of misplaced shame, which regards external repu-
tation instead of intrinsic worth, it saps truth and
honesty from the hearts of men and women, imposing
itself upon them by the hypocritical assumption of
sanctity and virtue. Physically,?it exposes both sexes
through the ignorance which it enforces, to life-des-
troying diseases, precluding their prevention as well as
their cure; and, worst of all, it imposes insuperable
barriers to the acquisition of the most important know-
ledge, by those most interested in obtaining it. This is
what stamps it as essentially evil in its nature; and what
compensation has it to offer, beyond a morbid gratifi-
cation in restricting by uncharitable criticism, the
natural actions of our neighbours, and imputing to
them the uncleanness which it has really produced in
our own ideas ? We not only approve, but we admire
and even envy , the innocent unconsciousness of any such
feeling as modesty in an infant or young child. Thus
is proved?not only that the feeling is not natural, or
more than a mere conventionalism, but that it comes
only with the loss of innocence, real or supposed; that,
in fact, there is no basis for it outside a morbid and
depraved imagination. The operation of modesty as a
pernicious embargo on knowledge, is obviously only


a relic of the esoteric principle upon which those who
of old held the monopoly of all knowledge, deemed it
best, if not necessary to govern the ignorant by means
of their ignorance, instead of dissipating it, and so
making government superfluous.
Modesty and chastity arc certainly not products of
modern civilisation, or even of Christianity ; but their
genesis and highest development are easily recognised
and traced in the same universal cradle of senseless
asceticism and visionary mysticism, from the sacred
books of which I have already quoted a disgusting
libel on female character. To quote the least offensive
precept of the kind in the same code ??A woman
must always veil her face whenever she laughs!?
How unspeakable should be our gratulation that this
law is inoperative here ! The absurd distinctions of
metaphorical cleanness and uncleanness have their
origin in the same nursery of superstition, but have
proved too puerile for more adult humanity. In fact,
M. Jacolliot has lately traced a surprising number of
our most uncouth and barbarous customs, laws, and
superstitions to the same source. The clumsy plagiar-
isms in the Jewish and Christian Scriptures, from the
ancient Hindoo books, he has identified with great
clearness and minuteness. Time and the diffusion of
knowledge are gradually dissipating the thraldom in
which these inherited superstitions have held the
human intellect for so many centuries, but much pro-
gress can never be made, until utility be recognised
as the sole valid criterion of good and evil. When
the vast mass of mankind was sunk in the grossest
ignorance, the demand for checks and restrictions upon
its rude inexperienced energy doubtless created the
supply. But the history of the world shows that a�
- knowledge increases, the doubtful necessity for restric-
tions upon activity disappears, and even proves all


abnormal restrictions upon activity to bo absolutely
pernicious. Public opinion and our more aesthetic
morality will inevitably have to undergo an eliminating
process similar to that to -which our religions or super-
stitions have been subjected. Mr. Mill?s proposals
amount to conferring upon woman, rights, as regards
property, fully equal to those of men ; and the reduc-
tion of all marriage to a legal partnership dissoluble
at will. .Recognition of the perfect individual right to
exercise natural personal functions without subjection
to impertinent obloquy, when the consequences are not
clearly injurious to society, must I think follow tho
knowledge of the fact that abstinence is as evil in its
consequences, and therefore as vicious, as excess.
Though I am more than sanguine of the best results
from such knowledge, and action based upon it, still in
the absence of experience, their strong probability is
all that can be contended for. But on the other hand an
opponent of my views is quite as incompetent for tho
same reason to assert them to be erroneous. Were I,
however, to argue upon the principle of justice, I should
point out that for society to prohibit any individual
from the moderate exercise of a natural function,
precautions being taken to guard against injury to
society, is merely to enforce a vicious tyrannical
monopoly; by which an unappropriated slave must
not dare to infringe upon the possible future mo-
nopoly of each possible proprietor,?no, not even to
save life or health, until some one of them shall please
to assume possession. Could anything be more
accurately the opposite of justice ?*
* In casting about, for an adequate illustration of the tyrannical monopoly
enforced by male society over an u mutinied woman the fable of the dog in
the manger natura'ly occurred to me. Though it fills immeasurably short of
the conditions of the case,.it appears though no* perfect, really not unapt. The
lover fairly represents the cow, and every other man, or society, the dog ; while
the person principally concerned, occupies no more important position than th*
?trawl I think this represents th c justice of the case with singular felicity.


*? I shall now only touch upon one point. Our know-
ledge in the past, though comparatively small,
sufficed to advance us in the path of progress to the
point we have attained. Can anyone who contem-
plates the geometrically increasing ratio of the ex-
Eansion of our knowledge, fear to place now in the
ands of individuals, power which was possessed by
our ignorant savage ancestors? or to remove restric-
tions upon individual activity imposed by comparative
ignorance ? Knowledge is spreading, and must spread;
and its rapid dissemination creates the demand for
power, the exercise of which, well or ill, produces the
most valuable knowledge. To those who fear that
this knowledge or power may possibly bo dan-
gerous, I would point out that knowledge and its
results comprise all the advantages which place
the civilised man above the savage or the child. I
certainly recognise a reason for insisting on the dis-
semination of political knowledge before conferring
political power. For his own experience may suffice
for an individual, but that of all civilisation is neces-
sary for a nation, and the ignorant are numerically
and physically the strongest in every known state.
But the young, particularly of the female sex, are
physically and numerically the weakest, and are at
even a greater disadvantage from the prohibition upon
the knowledge they most want. But it should not be
overlooked that it is less liberty or power, than know-
ledge simply, that I desire to confer; or, rather,
merely to remove the pernicious restrictions imposed
upon it. Knowledge *on the subject of sexual
relations is very different from political know-
ledge, in being all-important to every private
person. Individual liberty is also very different
from political liberty, 7as the happiness of the
individual only is involved in the former,?that


of society in the latter ; and so far as the happiness
of society is concerned, the more liberty the indivi-
dual has, the better; yes ?whether he exercise it to
his own best advantage or not. If he do, all are bene-
fitted; if he do not, society learns an invaluable
lesson at his expense. There appear to be no reasons
for apprehending evil?or any but the best results,
from the widest dissemination of the most complete
knowledge on sexual subjects among all classes, but
most especially among those by whom it is most re-
quired?the female sex. Innovations seldom occur
to the human imagination before changes are re-
quired ; and even if possibly premature, unlike that
worst of evils?stagnation, they necessarily tend to
correct their own defects. Activity alone seems to
be the one constant desirable condition, whether of
mind or of body,?of individual or of race. As I
once before took occasion to observe before this
Association, Activity is virtue, and reason is its
highest form.
