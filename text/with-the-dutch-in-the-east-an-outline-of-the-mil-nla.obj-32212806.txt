INTRODUCTION.
In various articles relating to matters connected with the Indian
army and to the Atcheen war, we have endeavoured to explain the
wants of the Indian array, to give an insight into the life of the Indian
soldier, to awaken sympathy for that army of which our own people
know too little' and which therefore often receives but scant recognition
and is with difficulty rendered efficient for its task.
With this question ever before us, was it possible for us to refuse
the flattering request of our former comrade, in collaboration with whom
we published ?A Beautiful page from Atcheen?s history,? once more to
join hands and undertake a similar task?
We labour under no delusions as to the difficulties attached to writing
about an expedition not yet belonging to the past.
Ought we then to have waited until the interest and sympathy for
our troops, now at its height, had gradually subsided? We have decided
otherwise and propose ?to strike while the iron is hot.!? Unfortunately
our doing so is subject to certain disadvantages, for in spite of every
effort to be accurate and correct, mistakes are bound to occur and for
these we beg the indulgence of our readers.
Under these circumstances it is but natural, that from the critic?s
Point of view, we shall only occupy a very modest place.
The Author.




PREFACE.
If the writer of this work has considered it necessary to claim the
indulgence of his readers, with all the greater reason must the translator
do so. There is a wide-spread, and, I must admit, a well-founded
prejudice against translations in general, and in this particular instance,
I cannot even put forward the plea, that the author?s name is a familiar
or household name in our midst.
The title of the book however will, I hope, ensure for it a friendly
reception; all things Eastern, appertain they to Eastern Europe, rEastern
Africa or Eastern Asia, appeal to the sympathy of the Weste n mind
und that is why I have ventured upon the translation of the present
volume.
Ny covers the political history of Lombock (one of the Sunda
Islands) from the year 1590 to the present time, but also deals with
the every day life of the Sassaks, an interesting people, about whom
little has been written in consequence of the stringent measures taken
by their rulers to keep the foreigner at a distance.
The book opens with a letter, written in 1891 by the Sassak chiefs
to the Netherlands Government, asking for protection against their
neighbours, the Balinese, who had acquired a preponderating influence
in the island. These poor natives enumerate their grievances and enlarge
upon them in a quiet, dignified manner and one cannot help pitying
the simple-minded men who write so touchingly about the sad fate
awaiting the wives and daughters of their fellow-countrymen when bereft
of their natural protectors and who not unfrequently in the life-time
of husbands and fathers are exposed to the insatiable lust of their
so-called masters.
Their religious observances, their funeral rites, their marriage cere-
monies, all point to an extreme degree of conservatism and in many of
their self-imposed laws we find not a trace of alteration since the time
of their institution, many hundred years ago; it is very certain that
numerous radical reforms are needed ere we can speak of the Sassaks
us even semi-civilized and there is no disguising the fact that, ?their
customs are barbarous and morals they have none.? Underlying all
their peculiarities and superstitions, there exists, however, an honest
desire for right, which is revealed in many of their long-standing
traditions; it is astonishing to see the sense of honour found amongst
the women, who submit to any humiliation rather than bring disgrace


upon their children by leaving their husbands? homes. Education too is
appreciated and fathers and mothers all teach then children how to
read and write; the islanders show a marked love of music and they
also seem to enjoy theatrical performances and watching the dancing
boys and girls. Unfortunately, the men are strongly addicted to opium-
smoking, but their love of gambling and their infatuation for cock-
fighting are justly looked upon as the prevailing vices in the island.
Cock-fighting, however, cannot be looked upon as a mere pastime ?it
is in reality encouraged by the princes as a means of levying taxes
upon their helpless subjects.
What cannot fail to arouse admiration and respect is the marvellous
spirit of co-operation which exists. This is especially noticeable in the
guilds established from the very earliest times for the protection of the
homesteads and the division and supply of water for irrigating the
rice-fields.
I have taken upon myself the responsibility of reducing an exceedingly
lengthy and verbose chapter on the Early Connections of the Dutch
with Bali and Lombock to a more readable quantity, retaining only
what was absolutely necessary to prove the right of the Netherlands to
intervene at the time her help was sought.
As mentioned in the title page, the work contains an account of
the native characteristics, habits, agricultural pursuits, architecture and
methods of irrigation; the folk-lore and religious customs, and the
History of the introduction of Islamism and Hinduism into the Island
of Lombock occupy a prominent place. The second half of the work
gives the full History of the military operations of the Dutch Indian
troops, who landed in Lombock in July 1894, and who, after a series
of brilliant victories, succeeded in taking the reigning Balinese Rajah
prisoner and restoring order to the island.
My best thanks are due to Captain Walter James of 5 Lexham
Gardens, who has aided in translating military terms, which are difficult
for the uninitiated to understand.

I.
THE IMMEDIATE CAUSE OF THE EXPEDITION.
This is from ns, poor and uneducated people, by name:
Mami Moestiadji, Raden Ratmawa, Mami Bangkol, Raden Wiranom,
Mami Noersasi, Raden Melajoe and Djero Ginawang, residing respec-
tively at and being chiefs of Kopang, Rarang, Praja, Pringabaja, Sakra,
Mas Bage and Batn Klian.
We are also writing it the name of the inhabitants of all the ?dessas?
and hamlets of this country and we wish to convey onr most respect-
ful greetings to the Resident in authority at Buleleng.
We hope yon received onr previous letter and we want to give yon
further details about the position of the Mohammedans and Balinese here.
First of all, we wish to acquaint yon with the fact that the king-
dom of Salaparang originally belonged to the Mohammedans; from
generation to generation onr ancestors have owned this land; it was
by force that the Balinese took }3ossession of the princely dignity and
jhaced the entire country under their own rule.
We have acknowledged their princely dignity and since we have
become their subjects, we have always carried out their commands,
yet we have always been cruelly treated and robbed.
At their bidding we have always paid the taxes on gardens and
? sawahs ? (nice plantations) and have brought in a sufficient supply
of rice, paddy and kepings (money).
We have never failed in this since they have become the masters
and we the subjects of this country.
When there has been question of building houses, or raising other
edifices, or laying out pleasure grounds, we have done the work punc-
tually. While thus employed we had to bring our own food, which
was very hard for those living at a distance.
In addition to having to work like this for the princes, we had to
do the same thing for the smaller Balinese chiefs, and still, notwithstand-
ing this, we have been shamefully treated.
People have been put to death without trial and have very frequently
been drowned in the sea. If the chiefs were annoyed with a man,
he would be found guilty of some crime and condemned, and we
dared not rebel. Often our property, such as ? sawahs, ?? gardens,
* Translation of a letter written by the chiefs of the East coast of Lomhock to the
Resident of Bali and Lomhock and produced by the Colonial Minister in the First Chamber,
7th and Bth July, 1894 at the interpellation of Heer Pijnacker Hordijk.


Buffalo-oxen and cows were taken fi'Oin us without any soit of com-
pensation, although as above stated, we were never remiss in paying
our taxes to the full.
Our sons were often made slaves and our daughters, especially if
girls of good birth, were taken away by force, some they took for
themselves, while the others were subjected to all sorts of outrages
and finally became courtesans. Sometimes grown up girls were taken?
at others it was little girls of about seven. It not un frequently
happened that the parents of these children went out of their minds
with grief, but what was to be done? nobody dared raise his voice.
Every year the taxes have been raised in a very unjust manner.
We had coffee plantations, but after the harvest the prince?s hirelings
came and seized it nearly all, so that we had not even enough for
our own use. If more than two or three ?katis? of coffee were
found in any one?s house, it was immediately seized and, in addition
to that, the owner was fined; the same thing took place with the
coffee we received from Buleleng or Sumbawa.
If the princes or notables wanted anything, either people or horses
or wearing apparel, they simply took them, without seeing the neces-
sity of giving any compensation.
By order of the Princes cock-fighting and dice-playing were con-
tinually kept up; those Avho owned any thing lost it, whilst others
were driven to theft; the princes encouraged this pastime because
fines were imposed on the players; as a result the small man became
poor and in those dessas, where the games did not take place regu-
larly, the chiefs were punished.
With regard to the inhabitants of the coast, the regulations were
of such a nature, that it became next to impossible to obtain a liveli-
hood; import and export duties were levied and even certain articles
which are not dutiable were nevertheless taxed.
The taxes and the above mentioned dues have been exorbitantly
increased and the princes have never troubled to look after the welfare
of the country or the interests of the poor islanders.
We have been informed recently that the princes at Ampenan con-
template putting a duty on ?kepings?; they claim 1 per cent on all
debts or interest of debts and the same amount on all goods, which
the people of the interior come and buy. The originator of this
scheme is a certain Entji Oemar, of whom you may have heard
already.
We have yielded to this last demand of the princes, but you your-
self will see the gross injustice of this last measure.
Further, we wish to inform you, that, when hostilities broke out
between Karangassim and Klongkong, we were ordered by the princes
to provide weapons and food. Some of the inhabitants of certain
districts were immediately summoned to take part in the war and
they did so.
Those who were possessed of means of subsistence provided for them-
selves at Karangassim, but those who were poor were very badly
cared for.
Finally those who could afford to return here did so, but many
were unable to come home and Ave are still left in ignorance as to


whether they are dead or alive. This is the way we have always
obeyed the princes.
Besides, we must tell you that when a Mohammedan dies here
without leaving male issue, all his female relations, as well as all
his real and personal estate are appropriated by the princes; as a
result of this the girls are mostly converted into prostitutes. If the
deceased leave brothers, they get nothing either, and later, when some
Balinese is banished here from Karangassim, the lands are given to
him, so that he may crush down the Sassak population to his heart?s content.
Probably you have heard what happened in the case of the Chinese
Bandar Ketjoe, who died at Ampenan; he only left a widow and one
brother?he had no sons ?well, we are treated in the same way.
Tracts of land which are suitable for ? sawahs ? or gardens, are
frequently not allowed to be cultivated by the poor man, but are
turned into zoological gardens (menageries) for the exclusive use of
the princes; and these tracts are often to be met with, and the princes
say, ?we must show no pity to the Mohammedans, for they may rise
up against us any day.?
From this you can judge how ill-used we are by our rulers. They
have also made it known that they had heard that some of the
Mohammedans of Tangkah were going to rebel against them and that
owing to the complications connected with the war in Bali, they were
unable to do anything, but that after the war all those who had wanted
to rebel, as well as all the notable Mohammedans, all the ?hadjis?
(pilgrims to Mecca) and the leaders of that faith should be put to death.
The Balinese ?Punggawa? Ida Bargus Gama Oka stated this fact
at the house of Hadji Abdurrahman at Ampenan in the presence of
several people, some of whom came from Buleleng.
Several young men, who had been employed in the palace, had
heard the same thing and told us about it. For this decision of the
prince there is absolutely no cause whatever, and we are continually
hearing that many Mohammedans are to be put to death, especially
at Praja. A young man, belonging to Praja, but in service at the
palace, had heard the same thing and told the inhabitants of his ?dessa?.
Not long afterwards a young Mohammedan was put to death by order
of the Balinese punggawa, under pretext of his having stolen ? padi ?,
of which offence he was not in reality guilty.
In consequence of this, Goeroe Bangkol went three times to see
the above named chief, but his complaint remained unheeded. Then
he returned to Praja, informed his fellow-citizens of what had occurred
and also of the intention of the rulers to put them to death.
The inhabitants of Praja immediately prepared to fight; this occur-
red on the 2nd of the month of Muharam (August).
When the rebellion broke out at Praja, the other Mohammedans
knew nothing about it and we obeyed the order to march against
that dessa. Praja was besieged and many of the hamlets belonging
to it were burned to the ground.
Persons belonging to the dessa, who surrendered as being unwilling
to take any share in the rising, were nevertheless put to death imme-
diately by command of the prince. Amongst these were numbers of
old men, women and children.


We executed the prince?s orders to fight against Praja and on our
side there were some few killed and wounded. No provision was
made for us, we had to find our own food, so that those who had
come from great distances suffered untold privations. Although we
so implicitly obeyed the princes, still they did not trust as, for, as
they expressed it, Praja was not being brought into speedy subjection,
owing to the fact that the Mohammedans were secretly in unison with
the rebels and did not throw themselves heart and soul into the fight.
Thereupon the chief of Batu Klian and all his children and follow-
ers, thirteen in number, were summoned from Pudjan to Sakra and
on their arrival were all put to death. The same fate befell Mami
Ardina of Praja. A son of the murdered chief of Batu Ivlian is one
of those, who has signed this letter with us. When these occurrences
took place the princes were at Pujong, in the neighbourhood of Praja,
and all the ?radens? and chiefs of the Sassaks dwelling in the
district of Timor djoering were present.
Mami Noersasi, chief of Sakra, was ordered to come to Mataram
with all his followers and bring a cannon with him, and whilst on
the road he learned that they were all to be taken prisoners?so the
chief fled back to his dessa. The same day 150 inhabitants of Sakra,
150 of Djero-Aru and 150 from other dessas, 450 in all, were taken
prisoners and put in chains. When the Mohammedans heard that all
these persons were to be put to death, they decided to rise in a body
against the rulers, for they now well knew what was in store foi them.
They were no longer going to submit to seeing their fellow countiy-
men killed off like chickens; and besides, the princes had expressed
their determination that all the ?hadjis? should be put to death, they
having incited the Sassaks to rebel. As a matter of fact the hadjis
did not incite us at all; we were influenced by no one, but decided
among ourselves no longer to yield obedience after the outrages above
mentioned. 4J
It is true we are only poor people, but how can that be helped.
TVe have endured all the things above set forth, and they are certainly
not a tenth part of what we have had to put up with.
We hope that you will arrange to meet us, then we can tell you
all about our miserable condition. We have not been able to do so
in this letter, as we are very plain and simple people, unacquainted
with the correct way of expressing ourselves. We hope that you will
give your attention to our communications and that you will act as
though the business, concerned yourself.
If any of our expressions are not quite right or if in any other
way, we have failed in respect, we hope that you will not be vexed
with us.
We beg to remind you that in our previous letter we asked you
about weapons, and we wish to say that we hope you will be kind
enough to reply to this letter.
All the Mohammedans of this country, even those of the dessas
not specified, have consented to have this letter written by me Djero
Mami Moestiadja and I have made them acquainted with its contents.
We offer you our most respectful greetings and hope to receive
an answer.

At first however the prayers of those ?poor simple people ?? were but
as cries from the wilderness.
Had not the endless difficulties of the Atcheen campaign shaken our
confidence in ourselves and in our strength both with the people and
with the Government?
Was it not imperative that the troops should have more time to rest
and recruit their strength? Was not the exchequer drained, was not a
deficit imminent? And?quite recently ?did not the unfortunate results
of the Elores expedition show the necessity of greater prudence?
Was not our policy inspired by a pusillanimous, yet easily-to-be-understood
dread of complications, combined with a desire to avoid all that might
lead to disturbances?
Anyhow no attention was paid to the violation of the treaty of 1848
by article 1 of which, the government of Lombock had acknowledged
our suzerainty! *
* This contract, produced by the Colonial Minister at the interpellation of Heer Pijnacker
Hordijk is as follows :
AGREEMENT drawn up between Heer Hendrik Jacob Huskers Koopman as com-
missioned plenipotentiary of the Dutch Indian Government and His Highness
Gustie Ngoerah Ketoet Karang Assam, prince of Mataram, now sole ruler of the
island of Salaparang (Lombock) and dependencies.
Art. I. I, Gustie Ngoerah Ketoet Karang Assam, prince of Mataram, at present sole ruler
of the island of Salaparang (Lombock) and dependencies, acting for myself as well as for
my successors, declare this island to belong to the .Dutch Indian Government.
Art. 11. Therefore I, promise that neither the above named island nor yet any part of the
same shall ever be ceded to any white nation of whatever name, nor shall I enter into alli-
ance with any such.
Art. 111. Every three years an embassy shall be sent to Batavia by me, prince of Sala-
parang and my successors to pay homage to His Excellency the Governor-General, as repre-
sentative of His Majesty the King.
With that object in view an embassv shall be sent for the first time in this current year
of 1843.
During their stay at Batavia the expenses of these embassies shall be defrayed by the
Government, whose special protection they shall enjoy.
Art. IY. If the Government should think fit, for any reason, to send from time to time,
an envoy to Salaparang, (Lombock) the said envoy shall enjoy the same privileges there as
those guaranteed in the foregoing article to the Salaparang envoy.
Art. Y. The commissioner and the above-named prince, judging it necessary that a stop
should be put to the barbarous practice on the island of Salaparang, known by" the name of
Tawang-Karang, (right of jetsom) by which the cargo of ships and steamers wrecked off the
coast of this island, ceases to belong to the passengers and crew ?who besides losing their


Every fresh insult, every new encroachment was blinked at with most
admirable patience!
Thus it was in June 1891 when the Government of Karangassim
went to war against the ?Dewa Agong of Klongkong and the Lombock
princes, without consulting the Governor-General conveyed troops and
war stores to Bali to assist Karangassim.
Thus it was in August 1891 ?when a rebellion broke out amongst
property, are exposed to most cruel ill-usage ?have both decided to lay down the following
regulations: . , ,
a . The Prince Gustie Kgoerah Ketoet Karang Assam declares that m compliance with tne
desire of the aforesaid Government he makes an irrevocable renunciation for all time of the
tax, known as Tawang Karang, as above described.
h. In consequence of this he, the prince, promises that in future, all ships and vessels,
which may be unfortunate enough to get wrecked off any part of the coast within his
dominions, together with all the passengers and crew, shall receive all possible help, such as
is given in all countries under the Dutch Indian Government.
c. Salvage monev for goods saved must be reckoned at 15 p. cent at the very loA\est and
50 p. cent at the very highest, on the value of the materials saved.
The minimum of 15 p. cent will only be accepted on things which have been saved with
very little trouble and without danger.
On the other hand 50 p. cent must be given, when for instance there is need for deep
diving, thus endangering life and incurring heavy expenditure.
Moreover the amount of the salvage money, shall always be fixed by an arbitration com-
mittee, but in all cases according to the scale before named and taking into consideration
the more or less danger to life and the more or less trouble and expense incurred in the
recovery of the goods.
The committee shall consist of:
one member representing the Dutch Indian Government;
one member representing the prince of Salaparang (Lombock) and
one member representing the wrecked vessel. # .
The member elected to represent the Dutch Indian Government is George Pocock King,
merchant, now residing at Ampenan. #
Art. YI. The prince further promises that the most active protection shall be attorded to
all trade in general. .
Art. YII. The Dutch Indian Government declares that as long as the princes of toalapa-
rang (Lombock) carry out faithfully the foregoing articles, no attempt shall be made by it
to establish itself in the island nor to interfere with the internal administration thereof, which
administration shall, on the contrary be left entirely, under the control of the princes ot the

the Sassalc population and the princes neglected to notify the Government
of the occurrence.
Thus it was in February 1892 ?when, in consequence of the rising,
the controller, J. H. Liefrinck, sought to obtain admission to the princes
at Mataram and was put off under various pretexts, while two letters
of the Resident?s received but unsatisfactory and evasive replies.
It was the same thing again when the princes imported weapons and
war materials without asking the consent * of the Government and even
went as far as chartering vessels, manned partly or entirely by Europeans,
for the transport by sea of their troops and war materials.
Although the controller Liefrinck repeatedly warned them that the
importation of arms into the Dutch Indies without leave was prohibited
by the Government, and, that under no circumstances, would it be
possible for the Dutch Indian Government to allow these steamers to
3e used for warlike purposes: still no notice was taken. The Lombock
princes went even so far as to forbid the captain of one of the char-
tered vessels to go on board of one of our men-of-war. When called
upon to present his ship?s papers, he refused to do so and at the same
time behaved in a most unbecoming manner to the Dutch Naval Authorities.
Finally, when in May 1892, the Resident of Bali and Lombock went
himself to Lombock to demand an explanation of these extraordinary
proceedings, he was not received; he was informed in haughty tones
that the Government of Lombock did not consider itself bound by the
dictates of our Government as regards the use of warships; and apologies
for the unseemly conduct towards our naval officers were refused.
In more recent despatches the princes denied the right of our Govern-
ment to apply to them the police regulations observed at sea and they
entered a protest against the embargo, which our Government had finally
considered it necessary to place on two Lombock vessels, lying at Surabaya.
They even went so far, these Lombock princes, as to try and sow
dissension between us and a foreign Government. First of all, they sent
one of their dependents to Singapore with the political treaty, in order
to obtain legal advice about it and, if possible, to seek the interven-
tion of the British Government against the Dutch Indian Government.
I, the undersigned, declare that I was present at the concluding of this treaty and respect-
fully accept the appointment to be a member of the arbitration committee.
GL P. King.
The present treaty is confirmed on this the 28th day of August 1843, but only on the
express condition, that the wording of article YI shall be understood to mean, that if any
Dutch subjects should wish to establish themselves in business on the island, the prince shall
allow them to do so, and that they shall he permitted ;to place themselves under the Dutch
flag in such a manner, as to feel that they are secure in their places of abode.
The Governor General of the Dutch Indies ,
P. Merkus.
In the historical survey of our former relations with Lombock, we shall again refer to this
treaty.
* In contradiction to the general decree of 30 Kov. 1876, regarding the import and export
as well as trade with the interior in fire-arms, gunpowder and other materials of war, other
than for the public benefit.


Finding themselves thwarted in this by the advice they received, they
sent an Austrian, residing at Ampenan, to Singapore with an announce-
ment, translated into English and intended for the Stiaits limes, t
the effect that the prince, as Rajah of Lombock, had nothing whatever
to do with the Dutch Government, and that he was perfectly independent
an d so forth. At the request, however, of our Consul-General the
notice was not inserted. ,
Surely this act might be looked upon as really the last straw.
And did the Government consequently feel that it was undignified to
be thus set at nought and decide at last upon taking summary measures: ....
No?it is not yet quite the ?last straw!?
First they would try and have recourse to ?amicable intervention.
The Governement decided therefore ?April 1893 ?to consult with
the Resident of Bali and Lombock, Heer Dannenbargh, as to whether
the Lombock Government would receive favorably a proposal from us, to .
try and bring about a compromise between the lawful authorities there
and the rebels ?
At the same time the Governor sent to the resident under date of
22 April, a letter addressed to the Lombock prince:
?This well-meant letter?such is the friendly beginning?dictated by
a clear conscience, is by the help of the Lord of all the worlds sent
with many greetings from us, Meester Cornelis Pijnacker Hoidijc \,
Governor-General of the Dutch Indies, Commander of the Order of
the Netherlands Lion, knight of the Order of the White Eagle of
Russia, authorized to govern all the Dutch Indies and seated on
the throne at Buitenzorg, to our friends Ratoe Agoeng Gde JNgoeiah
Karang Assim and Ratoe Agoeng K toet Karang Assam, u 10, y
virtue of the treaty concluded with the Dutch Indian Government, are
authorized to rule over the provinces of Salaparang and Karangassim
and who are enthroned in the palace of Mataram. ? May they and
those belonging to them have long life and prosperity.?
In spite of all the ?Well-meaning and kind wishes, it was just possible
that the remainder of the letter should prove less acceptable.
?Taking into consideration the fact that Lombock forms a part of the
dominions of the Dutch Indies and, that therefore, the inhabitants there
are entitled to our protection, when it is sought for on good grounds,
we think, now that the Sassak population has had recourse to tle
Dutch Indian Government for help and protection see beginning o
enclosed letter?that the time has arrived to draw the attention of our
friends to the fact that a great part of the island of Lombock has
been already for more than a year and a half in a state of insunec-
tion, causing a great amount of disorder in everyday life, which is
not only prejudicial to the people, but which has also been in no
small degree productive of troubles and complications to oui fi lends.
?If,? added the Governor-General, ?the Resident had any reason to fear
that the delivery of this letter might in any way lead to armed inter-
vention on our side, then it would be just as well to postpone the delivery.


We will only point out how very cautiously they went to work.
Although the Resident replied, that the offer of compromise would
probably be acknowledged by a polite, but evasive answer from the
princes, yet the Governor-General ?June 1898?decided to let matters
proceed so far as to prepare the Lombock rulers for eventually receiving
a letter from the Governor-General.... at least, if the controller, bearer
of the letter from the Governor, would be received in a satisfactory
manner. For if not, then the delivery of the document must be post-
poned or at least further instructions would have to be obtained from
Batavia.
Again, we must bear witness to the great prudence displayed.
And in order, above all things, to prevent complications, it was once
more earnestly impressed upon the Resident to avoid anything , which might
lead to an armed expedition against Lombock.
For instance, consideration was given to the danger to which the
controller might be exposed and to the eventuality of the Lombock
Government sending a reply of a threatening nature. The Resident was
most emphatically instructed to study the situation carefully and if in
his opinion any such danger teas to he anticipated, he teas to notify the
same to the Governor-General before sending the letter.
This again goes to prove with what extraordinary cautiousness and
circumspection the Governor-General acted in this matter.
The colonial report will supply us with further information concerning
the letter in question.
On the 22nd June a native interpreter was sent from Buleleng to
Lombock with a (not the) letter from the Resident to enquire when and
where, in view of the existing disturbances in the island, the princes
would receive the controller entrusted with the letter of the Governor.
The answer dated 4th July sounds somewhat droll!
If the controller were coming to bring the letter and to settle the
matters, which the princes had discussed in their letters of July 1892
these letters expressed a desire for the repeal of the police regulations,
directed against them in connection with the embargo laid on the two
famous Lombock steamers, etc. ?then they would receive him in the
usual way!
On the 17th July the Resident was authorized by telegram to allow
the controller to start for Lombock in order to hand over the letter,
and if necessary to hear any proposals the princes might make, without
however committing himself to accept them.
Surely this advice was superfluous!
On the 24th July, the controller having arrived in the harbour at
Ampenan, sent the interpreter ashore, and the latter not meeting any
of the Lombock ? pumbuckles ? there, went to Mataram, where the
Governor promised him that he would, without delay, acquaint both
the Princes, now at Kota Radja, of the controller?s arrival.
Although two ?pumbuckles? came on board next day and assured
the controller, he should have a speedy interview with the princes at

Mataram, still the meeting was constantly postponed for some reason
or another.
In our opinion the disturbances must by this time have spread as far
as the immediate neighbourhood of Bogor, the usual residence of the
Government officials, so that it would have been difficult to receive the
controller there. No heed was paid to the suggestion made by him,
that it would be sufficient if he were afforded an opportunity of
presenting the letter to the princes in one of their ?poeris? at Mataram
or Tjakra Nagara and that he could return on board until the reply
was ready and once more go on shore to receive it at one of the ? poeris.?
Instead of that, in the afternoon of 29th July, a ?pumbuckle? came
on board, as representative of the authorities to prevail upon the con-
troller to return to Buleleng for a time, as it would be impossible for
the princes to see him within the next few days; but that as soon as
it was convenient they would let the Resident know.
They had however on this very morning received in audience a
European lawyer, from Singapore, one who was evidently advising the
Lombock rulers.
After wasting six days in the harbour the controller was obliged to
return, without having accomplished anything.
And of course there was no question of an apology!
The promised notification as to when the Governor-General?s letter
could be received remained non-forthcoming.
Such then was the conduct of the Lombock rulers towards their Suzerain!
During the whole of this period warfare was being carried on in the
interior and the inhabitants were running imminent risk of utter annihilation!
Such was the state of affairs when the Governor-General Pijnacker
Hordijk gave up office.
Very shortly after his appointment, the new Governor-General,
Jhr. C. H. A. van der Wijck, redemanded the letter written by his
predecessor and which was still in the custody of the Resident and
regan seriously to consider what would be the best line of conduct to
pursue in connection with Lombock.
From various sources information was being brought in about
the insurrection.
Thus the commander of the warship stationed at Ampenan reported
that owing to the disorders having spread to the West coast of Lombock,
the rulers had been obliged to withdraw some of their troops from Central
Lombock in order to defend Mataram, Tjakra Nagara and Narmada,
and that the rebels seemed to be getting the upper hand.
Permission was refused to Gusti G?de Djilantik, prince of Karang-
assim, who was still fighting the Sassaks, to purchase a large number
of guns and a proportionate quantity of ammunition, ostensibly for
Karangassim, but in reality intended for the Lombock rulers, who


were making serious preparations to win back lost ground and to bring
once more into subjection the dessa of Sekarbela, which was suffering
from a rice famine. . , , , ,
At the beginning of January a trustworthy Bugis, who had been sent
by the Resident to the East coast to obtain information * was able
to report that there had been but little fighting in East Lombock during
the last few months and that by mutual consent it was decided to place
oosts of observation along the frontiers, but that although the rice
harvest could only take place in three months? time, in several districts
there was a scarcity of food, and many Sassaks had to be satisfied
with all sorts of makeshifts and that in the neighbourhood of Praja
and Sakra alone, over two hundred people had died of starvation. Ihc
chiefs of Sakra conveyed to this Bugis a letter?2o February?in which
they, in the name of all the Sassaks in authority, requested the inter-
vention of the Government, t
In order to procure further particulars as to the accuracy of these
statements regarding the existing famine and if to take
measures against it, the Governor-General sent Liefrinck to East Lom-
bock; he was at the same time to acquaint the princes with the reason
and the object of his mission (20 Feb).
On the 27th the controller left Buleleng and on the 3rd March
reached the East coast, which district he really found m the most
lamentable condition.
Let us see what he says about it: . .
?On the following morning,? he writes, ?I went to visit the fugi-
tives in the settlements of the neighbourhood of Sakra and was not
long in discovering that the reports which had reached Buleleng yeie
far�from exaggerated. In many cases the dwellings consist only of the
leaves of the cocoa-nut tree and there is no question of any suitable
sleeping accommodation, so that a good deal of sickness results.
? Walking through these temporary settlements, there is no need to
enquire whether hunger exists; the hollow cheeks, the emaciated bodies
tell their own tale too plainly.
?The poor little children are the most to be pitied; owing to the
misery and lack of food of these past few months, haidlv anything is
left of the poor little mites but skin and bone.
?In several places I saw the people preparing their meals, which con-
sisted mostly of a quantity of chopped papajastam, pisangstam and a
?few young leaves, and in very rare cases a handful of ?djagoeng
was added.
* He was to find out whether it was true or not that the aged prince was still alive
contradictory statements having been sent in. It is characteristic of the people, that this spy
was unable to obtain positive information on this point, regarding which uncertainty prevailed
until General Vetter had a personal interview with him.
f The translation of this letter is as follows: ?This letter is sent with the utmost humility
1) V us Raden G?de and Dj?ro G?de Mami Kertawang of Sakra to the Resident of Buleleng.
We hereby request your help in the difficult circumstances, in which we are placed and we
wish to inform you that all men in authority in this country are relying upon the assistance
you will give us. Written 20 February, 1894.

? After this look round, during which I visited about 200 of
these unfortunates, I saw that help was absolutely needed, and know-
ing, that in that case, it would be given, I decided to return on
board immediately and inform Your Excellency of the State of
affairs.?
After that the controller had an interview with the chiefs and what
he gathered from them he relates as follows:
? Referring in the course of conversation to what I had seen that
morning, it was
pointed out to
me that what 1
had been able
to discover in
such a short
survey, was but
trifling in com-
parison to the
misery in other
places, Praja for
instance.
?In order to
give me some
idea of the ex-
tent of the fam-
ine they men-
tioned the names
of 28 dessas
which are now
nearly quite de-
serted, amongst
which several,
such as Rarang
Soldiers? wives.
Kopang, Batu-Klian and Turadadi formerly contained three thousand
or more inhabitants, so that according even to their very moderate
estimate, the fugitives must amount to 50.000 persons.
?There is not a single dessa or hamlet where they are not to be
found; sometimes they are received in the dessas and establish them-
selves in the existing homesteads, where frequently the open spaces
under the rice barns, are fixed up so as to accommodate an entire
family; and sometimes they establish themselves in groups outside
the dessas.
?All the chiefs declared that they did all in their power to alleviate
the sufferings of these poor people, but that it was quite impossible
for them to supply food for all.
?In many instances they have given up all the available space in
their own homesteads; one of them assured me he had lodged as many
as seventy wanderers.


?In the course of the following days? continues the controller, I
visited the dessas of Mas Bagei, Dasan Lekong, Kali-Djaga and I nng-
gabaia, where, as well as in the outskirts, there were many fugitives,
who were just as badly off as at Sakra, and in Pnnggabaja things
seemed if possible, worse! .
?Praja, however, seems to be suffering from the greatest distiess o
all- I have been unable to go there, as it is a three days journey,
besides which, there is a rumour current that an invasion of the
Balinese may be expected any day. 1x . r .
?Prom what 1 have actually witnessed, I have no difficulty m believing
the report received at Buleleng that corpses had been seen on the
roadside near Praja; I have not seen any with my own eyes, nt
judging from the emaciated shrunken appearance of the greater number
of the fugitives, it is quite possible to imagine that some of these poor
wretches must succumb on their way from one dessa to auot lei.
? Everywhere I receive the same accounts of the famine an in ic
dessas I have more recently visited they seem to use the same sort of
substitutes for food. . . ~, ,
?In many cases parents have been known to sell their children to
obtain food for themselves; usually the price received is a ?njks-
dalder,? (4s. Bd.) but instances have occurred, where they have had to be
satisfied with 400 kepengs. (Is. 4d.) . ? , ,
?With the exception of the chief of Praja, I have met all the piesent
chiefs of the East coast. The most influential amongst _ them are ;
?Baden G?de Mamy Ketawang of Sakra, Baden G?de Melajoe Kesoema
and Baden Soehara of Mas Bagei, Baden Barang of Baiang, Mangel
Kanat of Batu-Klian and Baden G?de Wiranom of Prmggabaja.
?According to my instructions, I have abstained in all my interviews
with the chiefs from discussing their hostilities with the Balinese and
I have given them to understand from the outset that my mission
was undertaken solely to enquire into the state of the people m con-
nection with the terrible famine. ~
?This however did not prevent them on their part from repeatedly
referring to the disturbances which had been going on for some years
past and to the events which had driven them to rise against the
Balinese; the accounts of the treatment which they and their inferiors
have received coincide entirely with what we have already heard.
They wish it to be clearly understood that under no possible circum-
stances would they ever again submit to Balinese rule ; what they had
borne previous to the outbreak of the war would baffle all description
and if it were the intention of our Government to force them to it,
they would, every man of them,. prefer to be put to death at once.
?It is not astonishing that the chiefs should express themselves so
strongly for they are one and all acquainted with the plans made by
Anak� Agoeng Made for their extermination, after the rebellion has
been stamped out. At a large meeting at Mataram he announced,
that as soon as the country was once again under his rule, it was his


intention to put to death all the former chiefs, all the descendants of
good families and all the hadjis; and if there is any truth in the
following story, which is being widely spread all-along the East coast
of Lombock, then he really appears to be a likely sort of man to
satisfy his insane hatred by carrying out his terrible threat.
?Some little time ago two notables of Praja, having acceded to the
pressing request of Gusti G?de Djlantik, prince of Karangassim to place
themselves once more under his rule, were well received by him,
provided with all necessaries and lodged in the neighbourhood of Sekar
Bela. No sooner did Anak Agoeng Made hear this, than he sent for
them to go to Tjakra Nagara, and after detaining them there for one
day had them put to death, for no more ostensible reason than his
inveterate hatred of all the Sassak notables.?
The perusal of this report quite did away with all hesitation as far
as the Governor-General was concerned ?the time for intervention
had arrived.
?Under the circumstances,? writes the Colonial Minister to the
Governor-General on 28 May, and the manly tone does one good to
listen to, ?it appears to me that it is the duty of the Dutch Indian
Government, as Suzerain of Lombock, to give active assistance to her
subjects, who have repeatedly begged for protection and no further
time can be lost in passive observation of events, etc.?
In the early part of February the Resident of Bali and Lombock was
summoned to Batavia for a personal interview. This however was post-
poned until the latter part of March, so as to secure the presence of the
controller, after his recent inspection of the country.
It is more than probable that the Lombock Government was warned
of the impending conference, for with that cunning peculiar to their
race, the princes suddenly decided that something must be done.
Anyhow, just a few days before the departure of the Resident and
the controller, a letter dated 12 March was received by the former, who
had been waiting seven months for a reply to his request to be received
by them.
All sorts of pretexts were put forward for having been unable to
receive the letter of the previous Governor-General in July 1893, but no
apologies were offered; they intimated that as far as the war was concerned,
the}/ felt more and more reassured?in other words that there was no
occasion for our interference; ?that they would be pleased to learn in
writing, ?whether it was intended to carry out the plan of sending the
controller to Selaparang, so as to be able to meet him as mentioned
in their answer of 4 July 1898.?
Perhaps the reference to that letter was meant to be a piece of irony!
and, certainly, it was overstepping all limits, when two days later (14 March)
the Lombock government, in reply to a letter, containing an account of
the terrible misery prevailing and verified by investigations instituted
at the request of the Resident, expressed their displeasure, and said it
was no part of the Resident?s prerogative to meddle with the internal


condition of Selaparang; that none of his predecessors had ever done so
and that ft would Jt them better if the Resident would act as the
previous one had done. . ? ,
Such was the language of the vassal to his feuzeiani. .
Meanwhile the Resident had left for Batavia before receiving this leer.

asstances of the military authorities concerned, that there was nothing

the IB June, having failed in his mission.


Orders were given by the Governor-General for jm expedition! to start
from Surabaya on the 3rd July.
At the same time more stringent regulations were issued regarding
the import and export of war materials to Lombock.
Aotice of the new regulations was at once given to?the Naval author-
ities in Lombock waters and, in addition to guarding against the convey-
ance of auxiliary troops from Bali to Lombock, they were to prevent
the probable flight of Anak Agoeng Made from Lombock.
Controller Liefrinck was despatched to
the Bast coast of Lombock to superintend
the distribution of rice to the starving
population. He was further empowered to
tell the Sassaks of the decision taken by
the Indian Government to come to their
assistance and put an end to their grievances
and sufferings.
Besides this the Resident was instructed
to inform the princes of Bali and Lombock
of our decision; as a matter of precaution
a corps of observation was to be stationed at
Buleleng. It was to be composed of a
mixed company of infantry, a section of
mountain artillery, besides some engineers
and auxiliary troops, with an eye to con-
tingencies, which might possibly arise at
Bali itself.
And ?last but not least,? three ships

belonging to the auxiliary squadron: the ,? the ?Koningin
JEmna and the ?Tramp? were attached to the expedition, as well as two
belonging to the Indian military marine: the ? and the ?
The sword must now solve the problem!
The decision of the Governor-General has excited criticism here and there.
ihe question has been raised as to the alleged motives and the
expediency of sending out an expedition; fear is expressed that we are
not strong enough; that the unwholesome climate will decimate our men;
that a large enough number of troops could not be left behind for
possible emergencies; even our just ?right? has been denied.
Concerning the first comment, we think that the foregoing disclosures
are sufficient proofs of the urgency of the case and that if the Govern-
ment is to be reproached at all, it is with having been too cautious and
too dilatory, to the prejudice of our prestige and that of the suffering
population, whereas, the only persons, who have derived any distinct
advantage from this great caution, have been the Lombock princes, to
whom time has been afforded to equip themselves!
As to the other questions which were raised in our Senate on the
Sth June, it strikes us that fear occupies too prominent a place, and,
2


fear is a had counsellor. Where would be the strength and greatness
of our colonies, if in olde/h times our military authorities and our rulers
had allowed themselves to be guided by ?Fear??
As to the rest we think we cannot do better than repeat the answer
given bv the colonial Minister:
?Nobody can foresee the future, the result of
every expedition is uncertain. But what can be
done to ensure its success shall be done.
Considerable forces are available for the expedition
and a large reserve force is prepared for any possible
emergency. The health conditions of Lombock
leave nothing to be desired. No comparison is
admissible between this expedition and the one
sent to Atcheen; here we have only to deal with
a small island, the greater part of whose inhab-
itants are on our side and have besought our help.
Referring to our right to interfere, article
YII ?see above ?of the treaty of 1848, does not
prohibit all intervention, as the Minister?s prede-
cessor, Heer van Dedem, took care to inform the
previous governor. No one can surely wish to
allege that the misrule of the Sassaks, the original
inhabitants of Lombock, is only a matter for internal
Native trumpeter.
legislation. Our suzerainty over a native state brings with it a responsibility
of which we cannot divest ourselves. In British India too, it is an under-
stood thing, that where abuse and misrule are found to exist, the Suzerain
is bound to interfere, while the acknowledged position of the protected
princes is like that of the self-governing princes in our dominion*.?
This is certainly most jnst; for there can be no doubt that our
moral obligations towards the people of our Archipelago must rank
higher than the doubtful clause of a contract!
That obligation forbids our remaining passive spectators of the
misery and oppression of a starving people on an island in the midst
of our possessions!
The authority, which we are called upon to maintain there, cannot
permit our dignity to be insulted with impunity, our claims to be
ridiculed and our demands to be set at nought!
For our colonial existence depends upon the high standard we keep
up towards thirty million subjects!
Truly, then, no expedition of recent years has been more justifiable !
Now we will see how the expedition was composed and follow it on its way 1
* Here the minister appealed to the recently written work of William Lee-Warner entitled:
? The Protected Princes of India,? where in Chapter X a Obligations affecting internal legisla-
tion ? there appears: u The right of intervention is not confined to the case of open rebellion
or public disturbance. The subjects of the Native States are sometimes ready to endure
gross oppression without calling attention to the fact by recourse to such violent measures.
Where there is gross misrule, the right, or the duty, of interference arises, notwithstanding
any pledges of unconcern or c absolute rule ? which treaties may contain.?


11.
COMPOSITION AND DEPARTURE OF THE EXPEDITION.
A stirring and motley spectacle presents itself to the spectators gathered
round about the inner harbour of Tandjong Priok on the last day of
June 1894.
Projecting over the right hand side of the bridge are endless contin-
uous iron girders, looking like a long archway, one side of which is lost
to sight in the glistening waters of the harbour and hidden by the
massive frames of the great ocean steamers lying alongside the basalt
blocks of the quay.
Beneath this deep archway are dark shadows, driven there by the
blinding rays of the sun, beating against the iron walls of the wharves
and the basalt blocks covered with rails and pulleys.
In the sunlight is a whirlwind of colours ever changing and shifting-
as in a giant kaleidoscope.
Plere are groups of Europeans mostly dressed in white; there, natives
in light coloured jackets, yonder, Chinese in long white or blue tunics;
mixing amongst them, sailors in their undress uniforms, convicts in dark
blue, coolies whose half-naked bodies display various shades of brown;
further on a solitary yellow silk turban of some Musulman is distinguish-
able and rising high above the heads of a group of women, whose
dark faces are partially concealed by bright coloured handkerchiefs, and
in the distance the European ladies in their gay and fashionable gowns
are walking in front of the shops on the raised pavements.
To the left of the quay a long row of floating palaces, the glistening
portholes contrasting strongly with the dark colour of the hull and
higher up still masts and riggings, flags and pennants enveloped in a
flood of light. Beyond this majestic row of ships the Avaters of the spa-
cious harbours sparkle in the sun; a steamer from Europe is slowly
advancing to take her place alongside of the quay; a few white rowing
boats are gliding about, their oars playfully catching the sun?s rays or
dipping simultaneously into the water without an effort, without a sound.
On the opposite side white arches stretching across piles of black
diamonds are lost to sight amongst the nipa-palms which rise in pro-
fusion for miles along the coast of the far-reaching lagunes, in the midst

acquaintances. Both the national guard and the regimental bands had

ilayed in turns and when the hour for departure struck, all who had
been able to secure tickets went with the train to Tandjong Priok. As
soon as it stopped at Batavia a large concourse of people was already
waiting in the carriages which had to be hitched on to the departing train.


This dense crowd renders it somewhat difficult to get on board the
? Maetsuycker ? on which the two native companies of the 9th battalion
had embarked in the morning.
Finally they have succeeded and the whistle of the steamer gives the
signal for departure; there is barely time to shake hands for the last
time. . . . but the hawsers are unloosed and the steamer ?'glides away.
The band strikes up, a thundering hurrah ascends from the quay and
echoes and re-echoes from the iron archway to the departing ship.
Handkerchiefs and helmets and officers? and soldiers? caps are waving
away, fiery rays shoot forth from the big black eyes of the brave native
soldiers and here and there a stray tear is seen glistening in the eyes
of the officers, promising volumes for the future, and expressing more
earnestly than words, how deserving these gallant men are to be entrusted
with their country?s honour.
The hearty chorus of cheers is taken up by all the boats as the
steamer passes by and on the quay the broad stream of people keeps
up with the ship, advancing slowly at first and then walking more hur-
riedly as the ship moves more rapidly and then with hastening footsteps
to the point where the foundations of Tandjong Priok plunge into the
sea of Java; all are desirous of exchanging farewells as long as possible,
of watching that tiny speck growing less and less every minute and
bearing away such a precious cargo.
Once more the band plays the national Anthem and ere the last sounds
have died away the Maeisuycker is already out at sea on her way to
an unknown future. Alas! what disasters and sorrows were hidden in it!
Accompanied by the remainder of the infantry from Batavia and
Meester Cornells the two European companies of the 9th battalion had
left Weltevreden on the previous day?2B June?at 7.80 a.m. Various
officials, amongst them the commander of the army and General Vetter,
and the bands of the national guard and of the regiments, together with
a great mass of people had met them there also. Those about to leave
took their seats in the carriages waiting, while the 10th and 11th batta-
lions were posted outside the enclosure.
The train had steamed out of the station amidst loud cheering at
Ba.m. Before embarking the men were taken to a shed at Tandjong
Priok. There Colonel Kalff addressed them, pointing out to the soldiers
what was expected of them and telling them that all eyes were directed
upon them, not only here but even in their homes in Holland, whence
Her Majesty the Queen was watching them with intense interest and pride!
After once more toasting the officers and the Resident?s saying a few
words to the soldiers in the name of the citizens, who had shown their
sympathy by the distribution of various dainties, the embarkation began;
one division after another crossed the gangway of the Gouvernenr-Gene-
raals Jacob, the 3rd squadron of cavalry having gone on board at 6a.m.
Not less cheering had been the departure on that same morning of
the two native companies of the 9th battalion; what a splendid collection


of men it was! what large numbers of the non-commissioned officers
and soldiers were decorated with the medals for six or more years?

babyhood though in reality such horses never attain any great age.
Ihe most useful are now being shipped off to Lombock; with melan-
choly-looking eyes and lowered heads, they gaze around; frightened at
the bustle and confusion, they huddle close together like sheep. But no
sooner is the first of these little
animals expected to cross the
gangway, than signs of life are
evident and it begins to show
its spirit and strength of char-
acter by positively refusing to
put one leg before the other
in order to accompany the sol-
diers to the seat of war!
The poor little beast has
clambered over many a bam-
boo bridge in its endless jour-
neys across hill and dale in
the interior of Java; with great
cunning it had avoided any little
hidden hole and invariably
reached the other side safe
and sound, but to climb up
such a curious wooden thing ?
that is something novel and
nothing would induce him to
attempt it!
At last one of the sailors,
tired of the struggle and delay,
clasps his sinewy arms round
the body of the refractory
pikol and carries it bodily on
to the gangway, when all the
others follow without any
further trouble.
l l he next morning, Ist July,
the rest of the artillery leave
on the steamers Graaf van
BVjlandt and the Amboina at
9.80 ? o?clock, the Alexander
having started a few hours
earlier for Samarang.
The roadstead of Samarang.
It is Sunday morning early, very early in fact; the roadstead of
Samarang is enveloped in a mysterious calm; the sky is of a dark blue
tint and the stars are still visible in all their splendour. The Southern
Cross inclines to the West but has not yet quite disappeared, the sea
is of a dark lead colour, just brightened up at intervals by the glistening
animalcula clinging to the sides of the steamers.


The Both, the Bead, the Coen, the Japara, the Generaal Bel and the
Medan belonging to the Royal steam-packet company and chartered for
the transport of the troops are reposing quietly on the water like giant
monsters and many small native boats are also discernible.
The look-out ship fires off its morning salvo, which resounds far and
wide proclaiming the dawn of a new day. The morning mists slowly
vanish, the water grows lighter, the outline of Moeria, Japara?s great
volcano becomes more distinct; a silvery streak tints the horizon of the
North coast of Japara and to the South a pinky stream of light encircles
the lofty summit of Merbaboe, raising its densely covered brow high
above the surrounding hills; and beyond these the cone-shaped giants
of Central Java, the Soembing and the Sindoro. Suddenly golden arrows
shoot forth into the air from the East, the hitherto hidden mists appear
resplendent in gorgeous rays of purple; a soft morning breeze steals
over the waters and each little wavelet sends up a hymn of joy to the
opening day.
Man and beast alike awaken from their slumbers, the crew rise
slowly from their resting places on the slanting sheds which shelter the
cargo; in the distance you can hear the creaking and rattling of the
gear whilst the stores and provisions are being embarked for Lombock.
And, hark! what is the noise we hear? It is the well-known sounds
of the music of the sth battalion and the national guard, who with an
immense crowd together with the military and civil authorities, the
officers of the national guard and even many ladies are accompanying
at this early hour a section of the mountain artillery.
The troops are inspected by the local commander, lieutenant-colonel
Munniks de Jongh; the resident steps forward with the commander of
division, Colonel Segov, who speaks a few words of encouragement to
the men; the commander of the national Guard, Major van Oosterzee
of Atcheen fame, bids a hearty farewell in Malay to the native soldiers
and all take their places in the boats, which are to be towed to the
Generaal Bel.
Still greater was the excitement at the departure of the 6th battalion,
composed of two European and two Amboynese companies, arriving
from the garrison at Magelang. Europeans, Chinese, Javanese and
Klings came pouring in on foot, in carriages or by tram; at 10.80 the
train enters the station! the platform is crowded with the officers
stationed at Samarang. As the soldiers come out of the station they
fall into line and headed by the band of the national guard and fol-
lowed by the multitude they march to ?den Boom? where they form
into a square; the officials and the members of the civil commission
stand in the middle. Colonel Segov?s address, spoken first in Dutch,
then in Malay, is a powerful appeal to all the better feelings of the
men, urging them to do their duty faithfully and carry out minutely
every command, explaining to them that the success of the expedition
depends upon obedience to orders even in the smallest detail. ?You

have the honour and supremacy of Holland to uphold?, he said, ?and
the flag, which you carry with you to Lombock, as an emblem of a
soldier s integrity and fidelity, is yours,?to defend with your very last
breath! ?
Departure of the field-artillery.
Then the Resident spoke in the name of the civilians; ? all the
inhabitants of Samarang, yes of all our Indies follow you with interest
and confidence, assured as they have been recently by your Commander-
in-chief, that every man of you will do his duty! ?
.-Shortly after this they embark; as they leave the harbour the Com-


niander of the 6th battalion, Major van Bijlevelt, stands bare-headed
on the poop of the little boat, looking towards the shore at his friends
and acquaintances; the band strikes up the national anthem: ?Wien
Neerlandsch b[oed and the thousands of spectatois bare then heads.
Long after the cheers have died away and the sounds of music are
no longer audible, we can still see that brave officer standing on the
same spot, waving his cap as a last farewell!
Had he a presentiment of the disaster which was to overtake him?
The Resident, colonel Segov and the other officials who had escorted
the troops to the steamers ?Both? and ?Bedel? return without delay,
to be ready to receive the 10th company of field-artillery who were to
arrive by special train from Ambarawa at 2.15 p.m.
. When witnessing the embarkation of the artillery horses one was able
to mark the striking contrast between these fine animals and the Javanese
likol; they were undoubtedly small but they had no painfully prominent
bones or unkempt coats, being in good condition and well-groomed.
The eyes are not sad and hollow, they sparkle and gleam round
enquiringly; when they refuse to cross the gangway they do not stretch
out their legs like bars of iron, but prance and kick about. A little
oat on the neck, a kind word from the master soon pacifies the fiery
ittle animal and where his master walks first and encourages him to
follow, he does not hesitate long.
The embarkation of the 7th battalion, consisting of two European
and 2 Madurese companies, takes place the following morning 2
j u ly_ a t the same time and in the same order as that of the 6th.
Colonel Segov seized the opportunity to remind the soldiers of this
battalion of the famous victory won by the 7th 44 years ago against
the same enemy, the Balinese of Djagaraga and how their triumphant
colours had been decorated with the Military Order of William, faith-
ful to such a record he felt convinced that the 7th battalion would
ever remain conspicuous for their valour!
The harbour presented a gay and festive sight with all the steamers
filled with soldiers and flying the national tricolor, while all the other
vessels in addition to their own national flags had hoisted the signal;
?Hearty success, pleasant voyage!? There was but a slight ripple on
the smooth surface of the waters when all these mighty ocean steamers
were massed together: the ?Both? carrying the staff with two companies
of the 6th battalion; the Bead with the two remaining companies of
the same battalion; the Coen with the staff and two companies of the
7th battalion, the Japara with the other two companies; the Generaal
Pel with the mountain artillery, the horses and mules; the Alexander
with the pikols and some of the convicts, the remainder being divided
amongst the other ships.
The Medan steamed off early this morning with the field-artillery
and the horses; the Bead is just preparing to start; some of the other

boats are receiving the last visit of the officials and various officers and
ladies, amongst the latter the wife and daughter of Generaal van Ham.
Mejuffrouw van Ham has come provided with endless little ? button-
holes,? which she attaches to the coats of the officers.
By the time they put out to sea the short-lived coolness and the
lovely tints of the early morning have long since made way for intense
heat and the full glare of midday. The soft gray blue shy has grown

darkerthe silvery shimmer of the sea is transformed to sombre indigo;
the shadows have disappeared beneath the blinding sun, which shoots
forth from on high those fiery rays, which are multiplied tenfold by
reflection on the ships and on the water.
The hills of the interior have turned from deep dark blue to a
greeny gray and the outlines are no longer discernible; the clumps of
cocoa-nut trees along the coast are of darker shades, one might say
colourless; the surf has drawn a long white margin, where the waves
have dashed against the strand or spent their foam along the swampy shore.
The awnings have long since been spread on the quarter-decks of the

steamers and there is only a subdued light; now and then the bieeze
lifts one of the smaller awnings, admitting a blaze of light and the
officers congregated there feel as though suddenly a furnace door had
been opened. But to this they have long since grown accustomed and
are all chatting away cosily, the card-tables are brought forward and
the time is spent as pleasantly as possible and every soldier has received
his dram before proceeding to his midday meal. The men had also

Wherever the awnings have cast their shadows, groups of men have
thrown themselves down to rest, many wearing but little covering, except
the blue striped ?sarong? (cloth) loosely fastened around their loins; the
Europeans are gossiping with the sailors or talking over the bnsy
goings-on of the last few days; the natives settle themselves down on
little� mats to have a game at ?keplek?, (a favorite Chinese game at

cards) which is prohibited in the barracks excepting on Sundays and
holidays; others follow Nature?s lead and just keep quiet, waiting for the
sun to set and give them a little fresh air.
Although the rapid movement of the steamer produces a slight breeze,
still it continues to be stifling hot until the western horizon becomes
resplendent with golden rays and purple ripples flit along the water?s
surface. Above the South west coast of Java?behind the ?Doodkisten?
(coffins) ?this is the name of the Rembang promontory ?little groups of
dark clouds, formed by the heat absorbed from the earth during the
day, stand out against the radiant sky.
Along the coast of Java.
This glorious display of colours, admired by all on deck, is but of
short duration; before long the sun is obscured by a cloud; suddenly
the golden rays have disappeared; darkness has fallen o?er the scene.
This is the hour when the men sing songs walking up and down the
deck, where they can find room and when all enjoy the soft evening breeze.
Side by side they stand on the forecastle, gazing at the sea and
watching the swell of the waves.
The weird sound of the beating waves against the ports alternated
with the blowing of signals ; the buzz of hundreds of voices is mixed
with the flapping of the sails and awnings and the noise of the machinery.
The moon is not yet visible and total darkness envelops the ship; a


darkness, almost as complete as that, which surrounds the fate of those
brave men she carries!
The soldiers hunt around for a nook, where they can lay down their
mats and pillows and take rest beneath the black and white striped
quilts, which are to protect them against the chill night air. After all
are settled down for the night, not even the smallest space is visible
amongst the long rows of arms and legs and heads which are stretched
out on deck.
The lights have all been put out; only the glimmer of the pale
electric lamp is left and it throws an odd fantastic glare over this
strange multitude at rest!
?Since yesterday afternoon the steamer has
been lying in the harbour at Surabaya, having on board two European
companies of the 9th battalion of infantry and half the cavalry squadron
from Batavia.
? To-morrow the Graaf van Bijlandt and the Amboina are expected
direct from Batavia, as well as the seven other ships from Samarang.
?The whole fleet will leave simultaneously for Ampenan. The embark-
ation at Surabaya will take place at 11.45 a.m. The convicts will go
on board in pirogues, as soon as the Amboina and Bijlandt arrive in
port. The officers? horses will also be shipped immediately.
?The engineer troops arrive from Malang by the 10.12 a.m. train and
they start by the 10.45 a.m. train for the ?Oedjong.?
?The artillery and those belonging to the medical service at Surabaya
will be paraded near Modderlust at 11 o?clock.?
This announcement was to be read in the Surabaya newspapers of
the 2nd July.
Early in the morning of 3rd July ? 7a.m. ?the civil and military
authorities reached the ?Oedjong? to pay their respects to the Commander-
in-chief and his staff on board the ? MaetmijckerA
Meanwhile it was decided that the Maetsuijcher with the generals
would not come into the harbour, but steer straight for Ampenan in
order to deliver the ultimatum to the prince of Lombock; there only
remained to be added to it the time, which would be allowed for
finally accepting the conditions and this was to be filled in when they
reached the harbour at Ampenan.
To the four previous articles were added the following;
5� the abdication of the reigning prince in favour of the lawful heir
to the throne;
6� declaration of willingness to conclude a new political treaty in
accordance with the wishes of the governor-general;
7� payment of the expenses of the campaign;
and to article I�, which demanded an ?expression of regret,? it was
further added that this was to be expressed verbally to the governor-

general through an embassy composed according to the desire of the
commauder-in-chief of the expedition.
At the appointed hour the engineers arrived; they were met at the
station by the lieutenant-colonel, and inspector militairy commander and
the local adjutant and several officers of the national guard.
Ihey continued their journey to the Oedjong in the tram.
Ailived here at 11.15 a.m. they found the artillery with the hospital
staff ready waiting and surrounded by thousands and thousands of
Surabaya townsfolk.
The Maetsuycker (at night) carrying oyer the ultimatum.
The troops were drawn up and inspected in front of ?Modderlust.?
The commander of division wished them all a hearty farewell.
The bands of the 13th battalion, the. national guard and the ?barisan?
strike up. Major Rost van Tonningen, commander of the expeditionary
artillery, expresses his thanks for the great evidences of sympathy and
encouragement; they tarry one moment more to say good-bye the
trumpets give the signal for departure. The band of the 18th battalion
advances at the head of the troops to the point of embarkation; here
again the officers and soldiers receive proofs of the people?s goodwill
and kindly interest
The final signal is given the band of the 13th plays the national
anthem and once more the departing ones are greeted with enthusiastic

cheers, rising up from thousands of throats and repeated again and again.
By 12.15 all have started!
But in the harbour we witness another impressive ceremony. Amongst
the authorities who had escorted the departing troops, was a deputation
from the barisan, * come expressly from Bangkalan to do them honour.
The deputation consisted of the commander of the corps, lieutenant-
colonel Raden Majang Koro, the adjutant-lieutenant and the 4 captains,
accompanied by the band.
Pirogues along the quay at Soerabaya.
He was a splendid man, this Majang Koro, a living illustration ot
how even in a country, like Madura swarming with princes, a simple
citizen can make his mark. He had entered the Indian army as a com-
mon soldier, when scarcely sixteen years old and already the following
year in the campaign against Bali, he was rewarded with the bronze
medal for his courage and loyalty. He received the silver medal for
courage and zeal for his conduct during the hostilities in Palembang
and for his conduct during the war in the Western
division of Borneo in 1858 and 1854 he received an honorable mention.
In 1859 he left the army, having attained the rank of sergeant?but it
was only that he might place his services at the disposal of the barisan.

THE LOMBOGK EXPEDITION.


He soon rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel, and by royal decree of
6 Oct. 1874 he was created knight of the Military Order of William,
4th class, and by that of March 1877, (n�. 5) presented with a sword
of honour, bearing the inscription: ?Royal recognition of valour dis-
played ; ? it cannot therefore be said that it was as courtier in the
?dalems? of Madura that he had earned all these distinctions!
It is now about twenty years ago. In the spacious audience room
open on three sides, the sultan of Bangkalan takes his share in an
ever-to-be-remembered and touching ceremony. Within his ?Kraton,?
surrounded by its seven high walls, sits the deaf old prince on his
golden throne in the midst of his numerous courtiers.
His venerable head is hidden by a tightly drawn dark handkerchief;
the collar and the front of his long black coat are ornamented with
gold trimmings; his kris,* studded with large diamonds and precious
stones flashes from his girdle; a costly sarong covers his legs. In front
of him is the battalion of his barisan, 500 strong, and they are to
start under command of Major Majang Koro for Atcheen, where side
by side with the Indian army they will prove their loyalty to Holland
and to Holland?s king. Every one of those five hundred men stepped
forward in turn, first the officers, then the soldiers, and all crept on
their knees towards their sovereign, took his foot between their hands
and rubbed their heads against it. Then the old ruler laid his hand
on the head of each one of his children and spoke to each a word of
friendly advice and encouragement.
In this wise did those children of the soil, who had practised mus-
ketry and had been drilled into soldiers in their spare hours, receive the
paternal blessing of their sovereign!
Thus did the prince cheer the hearts of those who were leaving wife
and children, buffaloes and rice crops, to go far away over the sea to
fight for the glory of Holland!
And Majang Koro, their commander, proved himself on the battle-
field in the first Atcheen campaign, where he won all his well-earned
honours by his bravery and loyalty, and well-deserving trust now placed
in him by his sovereign and our Indian Government.
Even this is not a complete history of the long and distinguished
career of this most faithful servant of our Indian Government!
At Kamal, on the south west coast, opposite Surabaya, the proud
?Pangeran? Adi Negoro, veteran of the Bali war and of princely blood,
had joined the ?barisan? deputation.
The Coen and the Japara on which the Madurese soldiers of the
7th battalion had embarked were now visited by this deputation. In
words coming straight from his heart, the pangeran addresses his fellow-
countrymen, he exhorts them to remain true to the standard, which
had witnessed so many brilliant victories and never to sully the name
of Madurese! At the conclusion of his speech, the soldiers throw them-
selves at his feet in emotion and clasp his knees and kiss his foot!

Meanwhile Majang Ivoro has kept 111 the background and has not
spoken a word?but as soon as the men perceive the old, beloved chief
their enthusiasm knows no bound and all vie with one another in
showing marks of affection and respect.
The hour for departure has been fixed for 5.30 p.m.
At the appointed time the anchor is lifted: but it is just a little too
soon, for the ship sticks fast in the mud. lor tin lately, she was soon
released by the spring tide.
Having however got outside the harbour, the anchor is again dropped
and the ship does not actually start until the following morning at five
as it was considered wiser not to set out as darkness was falling.
Now is our opportunity, while all the troops are present, to see how
the expeditionary force is composed.

107 officers, 1320 European and 948 native soldiers, 386 horses, 37 mules,
216 servants, 64 ?mandoors? and 1718 convicts, besides the civil staff above
mentioned.
What cannot fail to strike one especially in the composition of this
expedition is the extraordinary care bestowed upon the transport and
supply branches.
The greater portion of our readers being no doubt unacquainted with
the various tasks performed by the convicts, will be somewhat astonished
at the large number included, but we will show how the Transport
corps is constituted; it will then be easier to understand the reason of
this inevitable accompaniment attached to every military undertaking in
our colonies.
? , i
As a preliminary, let us remark, that, strange though it be, there is
no regular Transport in the composition of the Indian army, so that
every time an expedition is planned, the Transport must be formed
anew, usually consisting of convicts, and in exceptional instances of free
coolies, pikol horses, carts or waggons.
That serious difficulties should ensue is but natural; it is only needful
to notice the considerable loss of time and energy which every expedi-
tion causes, not to mention the very palpable fact that all previous
experience and practices in other expeditions has been quite wasted.
For this expedition the Transport was divided into that which formed
integral part of the various arms, what may be called the Permanent
or Regimental Transport, and that which was not so attached, but was
temporarily affected to the use of bodies of troops, as occasion required
and thus supplemented the first-named, and may be called the Provisional
or.General Transport.
The supervision of the means of transport forming the Permanent
Transport Service was entrusted to the commanders of the troops, to
whom they were attached.
The rest were under the orders of the officer in command of the
General Transport, Captain Schmidhamer of the Infantry; and he took
his orders direct from the chief of the staff of the expedition.
Composition of the Permanent Transport :
Attached to the General Staff: 8 convicts for the transport of the office
equipment and to cut grass for the horses.
? to the 6th battalion of Infantry : 4 ?mandoors? and 108 convicts, viz.,
16 for each company to carry the ammunition, 8 to carry the
kitchen utensils and 3 to carry the pioneer equipenent.
~ to the 7th battalion of Infantry: 4 ?mandoors? and 108 convicts, like for 6th.
~ ~ ~ 9th ~ ~ 4 ~ ~ 108 ~ id.


For the Cavalry: 1 xnandoor and 24 convicts, viz.: 4 to carry kitchen utensils:
and 20 to cut the grass,
the Artillery: 2 mandoors and 44 convicts, viz.: 12 to carry kitchen
utensils and 32 to cut the grass,
the Engineers : 2 mandoors and 54 convicts, viz. : 6 to carry the boilers.
34 for the reserve equipment and 14 for the signal brigade.
~ Topographical staff: 4 convicts.
Military Administration: (ordonance) 4 convicts to carry office equipment.
. with the : 10 convicts, viz.: 2 for
55 99 55
each one of the archives of the different corps.
Medical staff: 1 Field hospital, 2 mandoors and 48 convicts.
(j Field ambulances, 18 mandoors and 456 convicts, viz. :
for each field ambulance (consisting of 1 medicine- and 1 bandage
chest, 15 tandoes and 2 improvised field-stretchers) 4 to carry the
medicine chest, 4 to carry the bandage chest, 4 for every tandoe
or improvised stretcher.
Composition of the Provisional Transport Corps ;
27 mandoors and 742 convicts to look after pikol horses and cart-horses,
for transport of victuals, to keep clean and clear away the ground,
to replace sick, wounded, etc.
Total : 64 mandoors, 1718 convicts.
To the Provisional Transport there further belonged 55 two-horsed
waggons, 120 draught-horses and 100 pack-horses.
We may look upon the addition of these horses and carts to the
expedition as a great advance in the right direction.
May it prove the first step in a resolution to have a properly organ-
ized transport service even in times of peace, for it is one of the primary
requirements in the oft recurring expeditions of our Indian army.
No less trouble was taken with the reinforcements than had been
shown in the composition of the expedition.
The European and Javanese troops were to be reinforced by the
18th battalion, stationed at Surabaya and the Madurese and Amboynese
were to be reinforced from Central Java. The 18th battalion was to be
maintained at its full strength from Batavia, while all those men who
were not fit for service or whose service was less than six months were
to be replaced by substitutes.
So that of the expeditionary battalions the 9th would be entirely
replenished from Surabaya, and the 6th and 7th in so far as the
European element was concerned.
On the sth July a couple of hundred soldiers arrived here from
Batavia on board the Carpentier.


Tlie 4th of July lias dawned, the anchor is weighed and away steams
the fleet, following the line of the coast of Madura for about eight
miles.
Madura is a peculiar country! Our thoughts are bent in a different
direction just now, so we must content ourselves with a cursory glance
as we pass by.
In many respects it reminds one of the Java of olden days, when
the high road from Daendels was the only means of communication,
and all the dessas and villages, not touching it, lay lost as it were in
the broad valleys between the volcanoes; when Bantam and Cheribon,
as Solo and Djocja now do, possessed their own princes, and the regents
of Bandong, Samarang, and Surabaya, not to mention others, lived in
princely splendour.
The wide post-road runs between Kama! on the south-west coast
through Bangkallan and Pemakassan to Soemenap, thus connecting the
three princely seats of the former Madurese rulers, now only regents.
In spite of the new form of government the simple inhabitants of the
bamboo cottages still look up with the greatest reverence to the descend-
ants of their former kings, and these latter, like their ancestors,
continue to be preceded on the high way by numerous attendants, richly
arrayed and carrying magnificent krisses and lances, and richly-inlaid
? sirih? and ? bcdak ? boxes.
When the panembahan goes to pay a visit to the Resident the people
place themselves, in two rows in front of the palace, to do homage
to the visitor.
The regent is preceded and followed by lancers on horseback; he
himself is seated in a gorgeous state carriage, drawn by six white horses
and the crowd bends low as he passes; the scarlet livery of the outrid-
ers forms a striking contrast to the green palm trees, and the tall white
pillars of the residence of the present representative of the Netherlands.
Now there arises a new island on the horizon! Bali!
What crowds of recollections it brings back; what famous names it
recalls to our memory; van der Wijck, de Brauw, Michiels, van Swieten!
What fierce struggles in three consecutive expeditions; what insuperable
obstacles were encountered in conquering that strong line of Djagaraga;
what a bloody drama was enacted there on that dark black night of
the 25th May, 1849, when our men were overwhelmed and the com-
mander-in-chief, Michiels, met his death!
And it is once again the same foe that we are to meet at Lombock
and this thought carries us back to the object of our voyage.
Come, let us together examine this land and its people and find out
what is known of them and what our former connections with them were!


111.
OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE COUNTRY AND ITS PEOPLE.
?The appearance of the island is striking; the entire surface is
covered with a rich fertile soil and an elaborate system of irrigation is
carried out from one end of the island to the other. The best cotton
of the whole Archipelago is grown in the valleys between the hills.
The road to Mataram lies between cultivated rice-fields, which extend
for miles in various directions. Bananas growing about a foot high
and lofty bamboos, together with the shady, elegant cocoa-tree flourish
profusely. The approaches to the capital are lined on each side with
tall waringin-trees, the luxuriant branches of which meet and intertwine,
presenting a majestic and impressive picture, such as one would hardly
expect to see in Lombock.
But the sight of such an enormous population along fields and roads,
which neither believes in God nor in any future world, is enough to
move a heart of stone.?
This is what we read amongst other things in a painstaking geographical
description in the ? Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch-Indie? of 1839. The
?striking? aspect of the island is in no way altered since then accord-
ing to more recent descriptions and many more hearts of stone would be
deeply touched could they but see the vastly increased numbers of unbelievers!
It was at the time that article was written barely a quarter of a
century since the great eruption, (5 ?17 April 1815) of the Tambora
in Sumbawa, by which 12.000 people were destroyed beneath the
burning ashes and according to the official statistics about 200.000
Sassaks must have died from starvation and exposure; the whole island
was laid waste, being covered with from one to two feet of lava and
for years no rice crops were raised. The inhabitants of Lombock never
refer to this catastrophe except with fear and trembling and in whispered
tones. The above-mentioned review gives the then number of inhabitants
as 8000 Balinese and 170.000 Sassaks ?and eight years later (1847)
the eminent Swiss naturalist, Zollinger, to whom we are indebted for
most of our information concerning Lombock, gives the following-
startling figures: 20.000 Balinese, 880.000 Sassaks, besides, 5000 Bugis.
But towards the middle of this century the increase of the popula-
tion was still assuming larger proportions! The traveller, J. P. Preyss,


y"" T swasf*' �pMp
ir ? ?? ?;?< ?'
who describes his travels in Mangarai and Lombock in 1856 makes the
following statement; 200.000 men, capable of carrying arms, that is
from 15 to 40 years of age; this number includes 30.000 Balinese,
20.000 Bugis and 150.000 Sassaks; from these figures it is computed
Sassak Kampong chief.
that the entire population amounts to one million souls! And that on
an area of 108 square geographical miles ?just about the size of North
Brabant!
It was all important, as we shall see, that the Rajah of Lombock


should be accurately acquainted with the number of his subjects ?and
Wallace in his interesting work, ?The Malay Archipelago,? narrates the
trick resorted to by the shrewd nance to obtain the desired infoimation.
Although the diplomacy resorted to on that occasion contains no practi-
cal teaching for present-day rulers, still the narrative gives an insight
into the habits and religion of the people;
?The Rajah of Lombock was a very wise man, and he showed his
wisdom greatly in the way he took the census. 1' or my readers must
known that the chief revenues of the Rajah
were derived from a head-tax of rice, a
small measure being paid annually by every
man, woman, and child in the island. There
was no doubt that every one paid this tax,
for it was a light one, and the land was
fertile and the people well off; but it had to
pass through many hands before it reached the
Government storehouses. When the harvest
was over the villagers brought their rice to the
Kapala Kampong or head of the village; and
no doubt he had sometimes compassion on
the poor or sick and passed over their short
measure, and sometimes was obliged to grant
a favour to those who had complaints against
him; and then he must keep up his own dignity
by having his granaries better tilled than his
neighbours so the rice he took to the
� waidono ? that was over his district was
generally a good deal less than it should have
been. And all the ?Waidonos? had of
course to take care of themselves, for they
were all in debt, and it was so easy to take
a little of the Government rice, and there
would still be plenty for the Rajah. And
the ?Gustis? (princes) who received the
rice from the Waidonos helped themselves

likewise, and so when the harvest was all over and the rice tribute was
brought in, the quantity was found to be less each year than the one
before. Sickness in one district, and fevers in another, and failure of
crops in a third, were of course alleged as the cause for this falling
off; but when the Rajah went to hunt at the foot of the great moun-
tain, or went to visit a Gusti on the other side of the island,
he always saw the villages full of people, all looking well-fed and
happy. And he noticed that the krisses of his chiefs and officers were
getting handsomer and handsomer; and the handles that were of yellow
wood were changed for ivory, and those of ivory were changed for
gold, and diamonds and emeralds sparkled on many of them; and he
knew very well which way the tribute-rice went. But as he could not


arove it, he kept silence, and resolved in his own heart some day to
have a census taken, so that he might know the number of his people
anc not be cheated out of more rice than was just and reasonable.
But the difficulty was how to get this census. He could not go
nmself into every village and every house, and count all the people;
and if he ordered it to be done by the regular officers they would
quickly understand what it was for, and the census would be" sure to
agiee exactly with the quantity of rice he got last year. It was evident
theiefore that to answer his purpose, no one must know that there was
any census taken at all.
??* was a J?7 hard problem; and the Rajah thought and thought,
a�, hard as a Malay Rajah can be expected to think, but could not
solve it; and so he was very unhappy, and did nothing but smoke and
chew betel with his favorite wife, and eat scarcely anything; and even
when he went to the cock-fight did not seem to care whether his best
birds won or lost, hor several days he remained in this sad state, and
all the court were afraid some evil eye had bewitched the Rajah; and
an unfortunate Irish captain who had come in for a cargo of rice and
who squinted dreadfully, was very nearly being krissed, but being first
bi ought to the royal presence was graciously ordered to go on board
and remain there while his ship stayed in the port
? one ?Of dng however, after about a week?s' continuance of this
unaccountable melancholy, a welcome change took place, for the Rajah
sent to call together all the chiefs and priests and princes who were
then m Mataram his capital city; and when they were all assembled
in anxious expectation, he thus addressed them;
??For many days my heart has been very sick and I knew not why
but now the trouble is cleared away, for I have had a dream. Last
night the spirit of the ?Gunong Agong?-the great fire mountain-
appealed to me and told me that I must go up to the top of the
mountain. All of you may come with me to near the top, but then
I must go up alone, and the great spirit will again appear to me and
will tell me what is of great importance to me and to you and to all
the people of the island. Now go all of you and make this known
nough the island, and let every village furnish men to make clear a
road for us to go through the forest and up the great mountain.
bo the news was spread over the whole island that the Rajah must
go to meet the great spirit on the top of the mountain; and every
vi age sent forth its men, and they cleared away the jungle and made
bridges over the mountain streams and smoothed the rough places for
the Rajah s passage. And when they came to the steep and craggy
rocks of the mountain, they sought out the best paths, sometimes along
the bed of a torrent, sometimes along narrow ledges of the black rocks
m one place cutting down a tall tree so as to bridge across a chasm!
in another constructing ladders to mount the smooth face of a precipice
Ihe chiefs who superintended the work fixed upon the length of each
days journey beforehand according to the nature of the road, and
4


chose pleasant places by the banks of clear streams and in the neigh-
bourhood of shady trees, where they built sheds and huts of bamboo
well thatched with the leaves of palm-trees, in which the Rajah and
his attendants might eat and sleep at the close of each day.
? And when all was ready, the princes and priests and chief men came
ao-ain to the Rajah, to tell him what had been done and to ask him
when he would go up the mountain. And he fixed a day, and ordered
every man of rank and authority to accompany him, to do honour to
the great spirit, who had bid him undertake the journey; and .to show
how willingly they obeyed his commands. And then there was much
preparation throughout the whole island. Ihe best cattle weie killed
and the meat salted and sun-dried; and abundance of red peppers and
sweet potatoes were gathered; and the tall pinang-trees were climbed
for the spicy betel nut, the sirih-leaf was tied up in bundles, and every
man filled his tobacco pouch and lime box to the brim, so that he
might not want any of the materials for chewing the refreshing betel
during the journey. And the stores of provisions were sent on a day
in advance. And on the day before that appointed for starting, all the
chiefs both great and small came to Mataram, the abode of the king,
with their horses and their servants, and the bearers of their sinh boxes
and their sleeping-mats and their provisions. And they encamped
under the tall waringin-trees that border all the roads about Mataram,
and with blazing fires frightened away the ghouls and evil spirits that
nightly haunt the gloomy avenues. _ .
?In the morning a great procession was formed to conduct the Rajah
to the mountain. And the royal princes and relations of the Rajah
mounted their black horses, whose tails swept the ground; they used no
saddle or stirrups; but sat upon a cloth of gay colours; the bits were
of silver and the bridles of many coloured cords. The less important
people were on small strong horses of various colours, well suited to a
mountain journey; and all (even the Rajah) were bare-legged to above
the knee, wearing only the gay coloured cotton waist-cloth, a silk 01
cotton jacket, and a large handkerchief tastefully folded round the head.
Every one was attended by one or two servants bearing his sirih or betel
boxes, who were also mounted on pomes; and great numbeis moie had
crone on in advance or waited to bring up the real. Ihe men in
authority were numbered by hundreds and their followers by thousands,
and all the island wondered what great thing would come of it.
?Eor the first two days they went along good roads and through
many villages which were swept clean, and had bright cloths hung out
at the windows; and all the people, when the Rajah came, squatted
down upon the ground in respect, and every man riding got off his
horse and squatted down also, and many joined the procession at every
village. At the place where they stopped for the night, the people had
placed stakes along each side of the roads in front of the houses.
These were split crosswise at the top, and in the cleft were fastened
little clay lamps, and between them were stuck the giccn lea\es of


palm-trees, which, dripping with the evening dew, gleamed prettily
with the many twinkling lights. And few went to sleep that night till
the morning hours, for every house held a knot of eager talkers, and
much betel-nut was consumed, and endless were the conjectures what
would come of it.
?On the second day they left the last village behind them and entered
the wild country that surrounds the great mountain, and rested in the
Sassaks in the kampong.
huts that had been prepared for them on the banks of a stream of cold
and sparkling water. And the Rajah?s hunters, armed with long and
heavy guns, went in search of deer and wdd bulls in the surrounding
woods, and brought home the meat of both in the early morning, and
sent it on in advance to prepare the midday meal. On the third day


they advanced as far as horses could go, and encamped at the foot of
high rocks, among which narrow paths only could be found to reach
the mountain-top. And on the fourth morning when the Rayah set out,
he was accompanied only by a small party of priests and princes with
their immediate attendants ; and they toiled wearily up the i ugged u ay,
and sometimes were carried by their servants, till they passed up above
the great trees, and then among the thorny bushes and above them
again on to the black and burnt rock of the highest part of the mountain.
� And when they were near the summit the Rajah ordered them all to
halt, while he alone went to meet the great spirit on the very peak of
the mountain. So he went on with two boys only who earned his
sirih and betel, and soon reached the top of the mountain among great
rocks on the edge of the great gulf whence issued forth continually smoke
and vapour. And the Rajah asked for sirih, and told the boys to sit down
under a rock and look down the mountain and not to move till he
returned to them. And as they were tired, and the sun was warm and
pleasant, and the rock sheltered them from the cold wind, the boys fell
asleep. And the Rajah went a little way on under another rock; and
he was tired, and the sun was warm and pleasant, and he too fell asleep.
?And those who were waiting for the Rajah, thought him a long-
time on the top of the mountain, and thought the great spirit must
have much to say, or might perhaps want to keep him on the mountain
always, or perhaps he had missed his way in coming down again. And
they were debating whether they should go and search for him, when
they saw him coming down with the two boys. And when he met them
he looked very grave and said nothing; and then all descended together,
and the procession returned as it had come; and the Rajah went to his
palace and the chief to their villages, and the people to their houses, to
tell their wives and children all that had happened, and to wonder yet
again what would come of it.
?And three days afterwards the Rajah summoned the priests and the
princes and the chief men of Mataram, to hear what the great spirit
uad told him on the top of the muontain. And when they were all
assembled, and the betel and sirih had been handed round, he told them
what had happened. On the top of the mountain he had fallen into a
trance, and the great spirit had appeared to him with a face like
burnished gold, and had said ?? 0 Rayah! much plague and sickness and
fevers are coming upon all the earth, upon men and upon horses and
upon cattle; but as you and your people have obeyed me and have
come up to my great mountain, I will teach you how you and all the
people of Lombock may escape this plague.?
?And all waited anxiously to hear how they were to be saved from
so fearful a calamity. And after a short silence the Rajah spoke again
and told them, ?that the great spirit had commanded that twelve sacred
krisses should be made, and that to make them every village and every
district must send a bundle of needles ?a needle for every head in the
village. And when any grievous disease appeared in any village, one of


the sacred krisses should be sent there; and if every house in that
village, had sent the right number of needles, the disease would imme-
diately cease, but if the number of needles sent had not been exact,
the kris would have no virtue.
?So the princes and chiefs sent to all their villages and communicated
the wonderful news; and all made haste to collect the needles with the
greatest accuracy, for they feared that if but one were wanting the
whole village would suffer. So one by one the head men of the villages
brought in their bundles of needles; those who were near Mataram
came in first, and those who were far off came last; and the Rajah
icceived them with his own hands, and put them away carefully in an
mnei chamber, in a camphor-wood chest whose hinges and clasps were
of sdvei; and on every bundle was marked the name of the village and
the district whence it came, so that it might be known that all had
heard and obeyed the commands of the great spirit.
?And when it was quite certain that every village had sent in its
bundle, the Rajah divided the needles into twelve equal parts, and
ordered the best steel-worker in Mataram to bring his forge and his
bellows and bis hammers to the palace, and to make twelve krisses
under the Rajah?s eye, and in the sight of all men who chose to see
it. And when they were finished, they were wrapped up in new silk
and put away carefully until they might be wanted.
?Now the journey to the mountain was in the time of the east wind
when no rain falls in Lombock. And soon after the krisses were made
it was the time of the rice harvest, and the chiefs of districts and of
villages brought in their tax to the Rajah according to the number of
heads in their villages. And to those that wanted but little of the full
amount, the Rajah said nothing; but when those came who brought
only half or a fourth part of what was strictly due, he said to them
mildly. ?The needles which you sent from your village were many
more than came from snch-a-one?s village, yet your tribute is less than
his; go back and see who it is that has not paid the tax.? And the
next year the produce of the tax increased greatly, for they feared that
the Rajah might justly kill those who a second time kept back the right
tribute. And so the Rajah became very rich, and increased the number
of his soldiers, and gave golden jewels to his wives, and bought fine
black horses from the white-skinned Hollanders, and made great feasts
when his children were born or were married; and none of the Rajahs
or Sultans among the Malays were so great or so powerful as the
Rajah of Lombock.
?And the twelve sacred krisses had great virtue. And when any
sickness appeared in a village one of them was sent for; and sometimes
the sickness went away, and the sacred kris was taken back again with
great honour, and the head men of the village came to tell the Rajah
of its miraculous power, and to thank him. And sometimes the sickness
would not go away; and then everybody was convinced that there had
been a mistake in the number of needles sent from that village, and


therefore the sacred kris had no effect, and had to he taken back agaii
by the head men with heavy hearts, but still with honour, for was not
the fault their own!? ....
Whether we look upon this narrative as fact or fiction, it is moie
than likely that the princes were pretty well acquainted with the number
of their subjects and at the time of Zollinger?s visit, it did not reach
500.000. Together with this and other facts and considering that the
population would not grow so rapidly in more recent times owing to
oppression, poverty and sickness, we look upon the reports of controller
Heijligers, who visited Lombockin 1884 and those of captain H. P. Willemstijn
in the ? Indian Military Review 1891 ? as being the more approximate
estimates. According to these accounts the inhabitants of Lombock
would amount to 650.000 souls, of whom 600.000 belong to the aboiig-
ines of Lombock, the Sassaks, and 50.000 to the ruling race, the
Hindu-Balinese and there might be an average of say 6000 persons
belonging respectively to the Malay, Arab or Chinese races.
Accepting these figures as correct, there would, according to .European
statistics, only be 120.000 men averaging from fifteen to forty yeais
of age.
The shorter duration of life amongst the natives and the recent great
privations endured by them would have a decidedly diminishing effect
upon the number of men capable of carrying arms and would probably
reduce it to 100.000, which is the figure given by Heijligers.
Accordingly, and in confirmation of the opinion expressed by Zollmgci,
there would only be one fifth of this number ?20.000 capable of acting
in the coolie or transport service in time of war.
From all accounts, it seems that the Sassaks were quite untrained in
the use of arms and in time of peace are not even provided with guns.
In time of war they are summoned and the greater part of them are
provided with spears and lances from the stores in hand at Tjakra
\ aga ra and the others are given flint and percussion muskets.
Owing to the continuous warfare against the Rajah, things have altered
somewhat latterly and different kinds of fire-arms have come into
their possession and they now have breach-loaders and repeaters. Still
their chief weapon is the ?kris?, which is borne by all natives. ?Klew-
angs? are not often seen, according to Zollinger.
Under the present circumstances we had not much resistance to fear
from these people; on the contrary we might anticipate their more oi
less powerful support.
As far as the Balinese are concerned, they are all compelled to
serve in time of war. According to the above made calculations they
would muster about 10.000 strong in the field; however from later
accounts, we hear that the princes only had 6000 men at their disposal,
2000 of whom were auxiliary troops from Karang Assim under their
own prince, the since so notorious Gusti Djilantik.
The Balinese soldiers do not constitute a standing army, but are
called out in time of war and receive their arms from Tjakra Nagara


like the Sassaks. One hundred and fifty soldiers are always under arms
and compose the prince?s body-guard. The uniform of this body-
guard consists, according to Zollinger and Dr. Jacobs, who visited Lom-
bock in 1882, of a white head covering and a jacket of red baize and
according to Dr. Jacobs they also wear a ?sarong? caught up between
the legs.
There is no question of drill or practise in times of peace. Heer
van Eck says that a merchant at Ampenan told him, however, that his
coolies were constantly being called away for four or five days at a
time to practise target shooting. On these occasions they were obliged
to provide themselves with food and lodgings, which caused much
privation and sickness amongst them and the drilling or
practising cannot really have been of any advantage to
them. Opposed to well drilled troops in the open field
the Balinese need not be considered as very serious
opponents, but their powers of resistance under cover,
behind walls and earthworks is remarkable and by no
means to be despised. We had an experience of this
in the earlier expeditions against their ancestors.
The Rajah cannot in any degree depend upon the
Bugis, whose recruits would probably only number
about 50 and whose chief, Pa Molda, alias Doci, has
always under some pretext or another managed to
secure their immunity from serving in the army. And
finally the prince did not venture to summon those
Sassaks, who were nominally faithful and bound to
him by ties of blood and who dwelt among the Bali-
nese, for fear they might eventually join the rebels.
Balinese man.
The number of firearms they are said to possess
differs considerably. Willemstijn reckons about 25.000, amongst which
a great number of breach-loaders. By this time however, many must
be in the hands of the rebels and many must be defective. Of course
we are ignorant as to the competence of their gunsmiths to repair them;
but our experiences at Atcheen would go to prove that we are justified
in thinking that their skill is somewhat exaggerated, especially regarding
modern firearms.
Less divergent and more reassuring are the opinions expressed regarding
their acquaintance with cannon. At most they have not more than 70
or 80 and these are of ancient construction and various calibres and
the greater number are unprovided with gun-carriages. At the begin-
ning of the uprising the greater part of them were conveyed to Praja by
the Sassaks but would have been more dangerous to themselves than
to the enemy!
No one knows how to charge them. Zollinger was informed that it
was intended to force the Bugis to use them in case of need. This
would not have been dangerous for us as we afterwards discovered.


A very large supply of gunpowder, almost enough for two years, is
stored at Tjakra and powder and shot are being continually imported
into Lombock. The significance of this is lessened however by the circum-
stance that, according to Zollinger, a great amount is consumed on the occasion
of various festivities.* If, to what we have already stated, we add that
there is never any question of horses during the war, then we shall
have completed what we have to say regarding the military system
at Lombock.
Zollinger says that the entire Balinese population resides at Mataram
and the outskirts, or at Ampenan, Karang-Assim (afterwards called
Tjakra Nagara), etc. This, he adds, is a wise measure, for if they were
too widely scattered over the country they would have far more difficulty
in defending themselves in case of attack. The opinion expressed by
Zollinger was correct ?but we must bear in mind that it was formulated
before the great rebellion of 1855, and although the outskirts have in
course of time extended considerably and the border line of Balinese
supremacy may now be said to reach from Sanah Tepong to the East
of Narmada to near Raja on the South-east, still it will be a matter
of surprise to many how such a comparatively small number of Hindu-
Balinese, inhabitants of the smaller part of the island, should have
attained authority over such a far greater number as the Mohammedan
copulation dispersed all over the island and not only obtained it, but
kept it.
Before proceeding to show how the Lombock rulers obtained such a
firm footing in the island, we shall endeavour to sketch the historical
and religious institutions of the rulers.
It was probably in the first centuries of the Christian era that the
Indians or Hindus, in the pursuit of their extensive trade with Southern
Asia and China, established themselves in Java, Sumatra and other islands
inhabited by the Malay race and planted colonies there.
With their Hindu religion these Indians also brought their knowledge
of agriculture (rice culture), cattle-breeding and to Java in particular
their architecture, in which island they laid the foundation of that high
civilization of which we still see the remains in such wonderful achieve-
ments as the master-piece of Buru-Budur. There they established
amongst many kingdoms the once so powerful and famous Madjapahit,
which reached the zenith of its glory towards the end of the 14th
century under Angka Widjaja and extended its influence far and wide
to other countries. Thus it came to pass that, even amongst the early.
* Heer King related to Zollinger amongst other things, that at the celebration of some
festivity ?the ?Karia Dewa Yagna? ?at which he was going to assist, the princes would
consume more than 80 pikols of powder for salutes during the procession (1 pikol is about
125 Amsterdam lbs.)


the original inhabitants of Bali they disseminated the seeds of their
morality, their religion and their civilization. *
All this was not accomplished without a struggle, although the yoke
of the indulgent and broad-minded Hindus was sure not to weigh too
heavily upon the people. One of the most serious attempts at rebellion
was during the latter part of the 15th century shortly before the fall of
Madjapahit.
The two chief generals of this kingdom were ordered to cross over to
Bali and subjugate the island by force of arms. Arja Damar and Patih
Gadja accordingly went with a considerable army; the former was
especially successful in a series of battles and Bali was soon compelled
to submit again to Hindu rule; the name of Arja Damar occupies a
foremost place in Javanese literature and in Balinese legends as the
hero of the day and many of their ? wajangs ? are made to represent
the feats performed by him.
This expedition was the last display of power of the once so mighty
kingdom of Madjapahit.
What then can have been the events that led up to the downfall of
this realm P
Probably at a much earlier period, but at all events certainly during
the reign of Angka Widjaja, Arabian missionaries had come over to Java
to propagate Islamism. Conspicuous amongst these was Baden Rahmat,
whose adherents became so numerous and whose influence was so wide-
spread, that he actually married one of the daughters of Angka Widjaja,
from whom he received leave to establish himself at Surabaya and
assume the title of Susuhunan, whilst his sons were raised to the posi-
tion of Adipati or stadholders.
So firm a footing had Islamism now gained in Java, that it spread
very rapidly and towards the middle of the 15th century half the island
may be said to have been peopled with followers of the crescent.
In proportion as the teaching of Mohammed was promulgated, so
was the power of Madjapahit weakened, internal divisions hastening the
disruption.
If hitherto Rahmat and his adherents had pursued peaceful methods
* Great diversity of opinion prevails regarding the origin of the Balinese and their conver-
sion to the Hindu religion: in view of a similarity in morals, van Eck thinks they originate
from Celebes ; Yan Hoevell alleges that the Hindus come direct from India as well as from
Java. In support of the idea that Hindus came direct to Bali from India, Friederich?of
whom later?speaks of many customs practised in Bali and unknown in Java such as the
burning of widows, the building of houses of brick, etc.
According to tradition, the first Hindus came to Bali from India, (see Jonkes u Yolkskunde
von Bali?). On their arrival, says the sage, they found two princes at Bali: not men, hut
demons. One of them had the head of a cockatoo! ?and this is a remarkable statement, for
Wallace says that this bird is not met with further Westwards than Lomhock, where the
Australian fauna commences, but oddly enough specimens are found at the present day on
the island of Aoesa or Penida, belonging to Bali.
This same tradition relates how several years later Ida Sapien Dalem Dewa Agong chose
different wives from different parts of the island. At Kalong-Kalong he bought a slave,
who bore him a son with woolly hair, but who could not be king on account of his mother
having been a slave.
Does this narrative point to relationship with an inferior race perhaps from Australia ?


in carrying out their purpose, it was not so with his successors; who
did not hesitate to place their swords in the scales.
Raden Patah, a Mohammedan fanatic, struck the final blow to the
tottering monarchy about 1478 of our era, which finally succumbed
after a good deal of hard fighting with varying success.
The last king, Bra Widjaja, after struggling in vain to withstand the
forces of the triumphant followers of the crescent, was compelled to seek
refuge in the island of Bali with a few of his faithful subjects; he
established himself at Gelgel, a dessa in Kalongkong, not far from the
present capital of the Dewa Agong. From here he ?the first Dewa
Agong?exercised his authority throughout the island, which he parti-
tioned into various divisions, where the chiefs of his army ?poenggawas ?
were sent as his vassals. By degrees these chiefs of districts made
themselves independent of their ruler and founded the small principalities
into which Bali is now divided. *
Ratzel has drawn particular attention in his ? Yolkerkiinde ? to the spread of Papuans over
the Indian Archipelago where they were transported as slaves by the sea-faring Malays ?
especially to the coast towns. But even further inland elements of the Papuan race are
discernible; and the Balinese were not a sea-faring people.
Tonkes deduces from these circumstances that, both at Bali and Lombock, we have to
deal with an ante-Papuan people, mixed up first with the Malay race and subsequently
with the Hindus and Hindu-Javanese.
To return for a moment to Balinese traditions ?it appears that the sons of Ida Sapien
Dalem were the direct ancestors of the present princes?of whom the Dewa Agong (viz. the
great dewa) of Kalongkong is the most important branch, he being descended from a union
contracted between Ida Sapien Dalem and his own sister, both being of equally high birth.
AYe shall have to refer again later on to this Dewa Agong of Kalongkong, who strangely
enough is still entitled by our Government as Susulmnan.
It is a well-known fact that in certain dessas of Bali, like Sembiran and Sangsit, there
still linger many traces of the ante-Balinese, (Bali-aga) who in their worship had preserved
the customs of the ancient Polynesian heathens ?for instance these people neither bury their
dead nor cremate them, but lay them in or under a tree ontside the dessa, as is still done at Kias.
* It may be interesting to hear more of the popular traditions regarding the origin of
the Hindus in Bali.
AYhat follows is taken from a manuscript of 1842 and is written by Heer van Rees to the
then Colonial Minister, I. C. Baud:
?The arrival of the Musulmans with their Koran at Java caused great displeasure to the
Brahmin gods who were reverenced there. Desirous of avoiding even the remotest contact
with any strange gods, they determined to leave Java; accordingly they departed and going
eastwards they reached Bali, where they decided to establish their earthly throne. Their
resolution was however met with opposition; Bali already possessed her own gods, wicked
beings, called Raksasas. They had the courage to defend themselves energetically against
the Brahmin deities, but they were finally defeated. However one of the Raksasas succeeded
in escaping from annihilation and continued to sojourn in the island and this was the Balinese
god, known as ?Mraya Dawana ?
Should we be justified in concluding that this deity is representative of the ante-Balinese,
whom one meets in certain portions of the island and to whom we have already referred?
According to the ?holy chronicle? from which this narrative is taken, the victorious
Brahmin gods now decided to build for themselves worthy earthly habitations. In those days
Bali was a very flat country and as it would be undignified to place themselves on the same
level as mere mortals, it was settled that they should transfer the four hills from the East
corner of Java to Bali.
The highest one was placed in the East, the place of honour and was given the name of
Gunong-Agong, which means highest or greatest mountain. Henceforward this was to
constitute as it were the Olympus of Bali; the other three were located in the AN est, Korth
and South and were assigned to the different gods according to their respective ranks.
By command of the gods two human beings were born from the fruit of the cocoa-palm
growing on the Grunong-Agong: one was a man and the other a woman; these were taught


Thus it came about that Hinduism found shelter on the very border
of its earlier domains; here have been preserved up to the present
day their sacred writings, their historical traditions, their religious insti-
tutions : these have left an indelible mark both for good and evil on
the aborigines, but in any case they have resulted in a higher civilization
and great developzent in agriculture!
How now did the Hindu-Balinese succeed in extending their rule to
Lombock ?
Very little or nothing is known of the early history of the Sassaks;
a decided uncertainty prevails regarding the period when they accepted
the doctrine of Islamism. It must presumably have been shortly after
the fall of the Hindu dynasty in Java, when the Arabian merchants
were no longer admitted to the island of Bali in pursuit of their busi-
ness and consequently turned to Lombock to sell their wares and at the
same time disseminate their religious views amongst the inhabitants.
The date of the conversion of the Sassaks to Islamism may roughly be
put down as being the latter part of the 18th and the earlier part of
the 16th centuries. This conversion differs from the conversion to Hin-
duism, both in Bali and Lombock, in so far as it only touched the
outer life and consisted chiefly in subscribing to the dogma: ?There is
no god but Allah and Mohammed is his prophet? and in the abstention
from pork and submission to circumcision. *
by the gods how to instruct the people in their religious worship. These two first teachers
received the name of Manko (head-priest) and they fthere are still female priests in Bali)
also taught the people who had by this time come from Java.
But what had occurred meanwhile in Java?
The numerous calamities and disasters which overtook the Hindus now assembled in East
Java, made them feel that they were entirely forsaken by the gods under whose protection
they were placed, but who had now left Java. The Ratung AYilla Tikta (prince), now occu-
pying the throne of Madjapahit, on being informed by the Brahmins that the temples were
empty and deserted, charged his general, Pateh Gfadjamada to seek out the new abode of
the absent gods. Escorted by a powerful following, the general landed at Bali, where he
was soon on the traces of the missing deities. As soon as these tidings reached the prince
he hastened to gather a large army and crossed over to Bali, which became the scene of
many bloody conflicts; the natives were led by the invincible Raksasa ?Mraya Dawana, their
own god, who had escaped the fury of the Hindu gods. Finally however A\ ilia Tikta (Bra
AYidgaja) conquered them and became master of the island ;he selected one of the hills in
the West, only half the height of the GKmong-Agong, as the seat of his G-overnment and he
built there the town of Kalonkong. The Brahmins established themselves on a projecting
angle of the highest hill between the gods and the princes?this again confirms the idea
that the priests constituted a higher caste ?and the heads of the army scattered themselves
in a southern or south-western direction, all receiving smaller or larger grants of territory
in proportion to the services rendered in subjugating the island.
* Regarding the introduction of Islamism in Java and Lombock, Aan Eck contributes in
the u Tijdschr. y. Ind. Taal- Land- en Yolkenkunde, 1875,? the following tradition, which is
generally accepted in Bali and which we subjoin as forming part of the people s creed there.
Those readers who may take exception at the narrative must bear in mind that similar
accounts are current concerning the origin of tribes in other islands of the Archipelago, in
Java for instance. One has only to remember the Kalangs in Central Java, regarding whose
origin Professor Yeth gives all the necessary details in his famous work.
u One day, a very long time ago, Batara Indra, the much-feared chief of the lower gods
or dewas in Bali was right up on top of the hill, assigned to him for his dwelling-place.
Suddenly, whilst surveying from these heights the nether world at his feet, he vas seized
with the violent need to relieve nature. Anxious, however, that none of the sacred water


We intend to discuss the political situation of Lombock presently, but
the first question that presents itself to ns is: whence did the name
derive its origin? Nothing much is known for certain; all that can be
learned is, that a fair sized place of that name is situated on a bay on
the east coast ?the bay also being called Lombock and according to
the declarations of the natives, one of the Sassak chiefs must have been
established there. Both Zollinger and Van Eck state that a place
similarly named is also found on the west coast. There is no difficulty
in surmising that the early East India navigators, who used this place
as a watering station, should have given the name to the whole island.
Anyhow we find the name of Lombock mentioned by our traders, as
we shall see later in our review of our early relations with that kingdom.
The natives still adhere to the old name of Salaparang, as we have
seen in the letter written by the Sassak chiefs.
The origin of Salaparang is likewise hidden in obscurity; Valentyn
speaks of an island called ? Salamparang ? subject to the Balinese, possibly
the old name of the island, but more probably of one of the independ-
ent little states into which it was divided before the arrival of the Balinese.
should he lost, he called upon the animals of the surrounding woods, promising that which-
soever of them would drink his urine should give birth to a human being and that the
offspring should he a girl. The first to respond to this appeal was a sow, who was rewarded
in a few weeks time by bringing into the world a lovely little girl, whom she brought up
in the woods with the greatest possible care.
u As the girl attained to womanhood the had all she ways and habits of a well brought
up Balinese woman and she was specially skilful in weaving sarongs. From early morning
to late in the evening she might be �een at her loom; one day while very busy at work,
she dropped her shuttle ?she picked it up hurriedly, but it fell again and this occurred again
and again; as often as the girl attempted to take the shuttle in her hand it slipped from her
and at last, losing patience, she exclaimed in despair: 1 Will no one pick up my shuttle for
me ? If a man answers my prayer I will be his wife, if a woman, she shall be a sister to me.?
u Her prayer reached the ear of Batara Indra, who taking pity upon his foster-daughter
sent one of his dogs (spirits) to her assistance. He acquitted himself of the task appointed
to him and to his great surprise, he became that very day the husband of this lovely maiden.
The fruit of this union was a fine boy; his parents called him Mantring Moder (perhaps a
corruption of Modar or Prince of death). They themselves could give no reason for thus
naming him and history does not enlighten us. All we have ascertained is, that as the boy
grew older, he caused his mother considerable annoyance by continually enquiring who his
father was. She was ashamed to tell him the truth until compelled by circumstances to do so.
u One morning Mantring Moder went as usual to hunt in the wood. His special purpose
on this day was to discover the whereabouts of a long and lanky dog, which was in the
habit of wandering round their dwelling at night time and disturbing their slumbers by his
hideous winnings; finally he espied his tormentor, who suspecting .no evil, was seated peace-
fully beneath a tree in friendly conversation with an old sow. Naturally Mantring Moder
was unaware that he saw before him his father and his grandmother, so he let fly at him ?
and a moment later the dog was a corpse.
u Having accomplished this heroic deed the young man returns home. Presently he tells
his mother about his day?s hunting and only then does he learn from the widow, of what
a terrible misdeed he has been guilty. He does not appear very repentant, and indeed what
troubles him most of all, is the thought that his father should have been a dog. After
meditating upon his wretched fate for a considerable length of time, he decides to try and
obtain an audience of Batara Indra. He meets with a kindly reception and does not hesitate
to state his request, that it may please Batara to grant him a bangsa (status) amongst men.
Indra listens to him patiently but asserts his inability to comply. I have only just ?so
spoke his Holiness ?instituted the tjatoer-djalma (caste divisions of which later) amongst my
Balinese children. I have divided them into four classes and more than that I cannot do.
You have come too late.
?After a little consideration however Batara added; You have come too late and I cannot


According to Zollinger the title of Rajah of Salaparang was taken by
the princes of the island to commemorate the conquest and destruction
of the capital of one of the Sassak states bearing that name and in
favour of this suggestion we have the fact that at the foot of the hill
of Rendjani, in the Sassak division, there still exists a village of that name.
Before the arrival of the Balinese the island was divided into various
more or less independent districts, which were ruled by chiefs under
the title of Datoeq or Raden. One common ruler was not acknowledged,
on the contrary there were continuous internecine struggles for authority
and supremacy.
So it came to pass, that during the middle of last century some serious
struggles were going on between the princes and one of these, the Rajah
of Praja, sent a message to Ratoe Gedeh Ngoerah of Karangassim in
Bali, to come and assist him to defeat the other native princes. The
Balinese prince was not slow to accept the invitation, seeing before him
the opportunity of establishing his own authority in Lombock. He agreed
to help the prince of Praja in recovering his independence, but on the

tribe for you. You shall be the head of the ?slams? (Islam, ?slam.) Here is a tiny phial,
take it with you to heathen Java and pour its contents into all the waters where the people
bathe. The result of this will he that all will he attacked by a deadly disease; when this
has come to pass, then present yourself to the public and proclaim loudly that you are
possessed of an infallible remedy against the fatal disorder. That remedy is c circumcision.?
u Yow go at once and I promise you that within a very short time you shall he at the
head of a race innumerable as the stars in heaven and that to perpetuate your memory they
shall he called: ?slams.?
Mantring Moder had no sooner received the phial from the hands of Batara than he
departed and without resting on the way, he sped to Java. Here he followed out minutely
the instructions received and everything occurred as had been foretold. All who bathed were
seized with sudden illness and as all stood in fear of death they readily submitted to cir-
cumcision; within a few months the whole of Java was converted to Islam.
Our hero instead of being satisfied at finding himself at the head of thousands and tens
of thousands of people, pined for further aggrandizement and desired to extend his fame
beyond the limits of Java.
In due time Mantring Moder remembers that Batara Indra had spoken to him of Sassaks ?
and he prepares to visit their island with some of his followers: they reach there safely and
establish themselves at Dangin Djoering. Yo one troubles about the stranger, who is appar-
ently peaceably inclined. Yery shortly after the Sassaks begin to find out their mistake.
An unknown disease, whose ravages the cleverest doctors cannot arrest, has been spread
amongst the inhabitants. It must he the stranger who is the cause thereof! The islanders
driven to the verge of despair assemble in front of Mantring Moder?s abode, and certain it
is that his life would have been worth short purchase, had he not possessed the knowledge
how to allay the strange malady. Without the slightest demur every man on the island was
circumcised and the disease disappeared from their midst as rapidly as it had come.
As a mark of gratitude all the admirers of the honoured stranger covered their head with
a piece of cloth (ikat kapala), intended to represent the skin of a dog and the handles of their
krisses were so re-chaped, as to remind each one of the circumcision.
This then, according to tradition, would explain the wearing of the head-cloth by the
Sassaks, whereas it is only worn in exceptional instances by the Hindu-Balinese.
Regarding the later fate of the propagator of Islamism, the legend says: u that, while his
success had been so boundless, there was one to whom it rather gave cause for anxiety and
that was no less a personage than Batara Indra, who began to tremble lest Mantring Moder
might take it into his head to cross over to Bali with his followers. And what to do to
prevent it ? The only thing was, to get rid of him and that is what Batara did. Mantring
Moder was once more preparing for fresh conquests, when he died quite suddenly and his
adherents laid him to rest at Dangin Djoering, where his remains are still said to he at the
present day.?


understanding that in return for his services he, the prince of Karang-
assim, should keep for himself all that he could take.
A numerous expedition crossed over from Bali to fight the enemies of
Praja. The petty princes of Lombock were totally unprepared to defend
themselves against such an array of force, and one by one they were
all defeated. ?When all had been vanquished, the Balinese turned against
Praja itself and this too fell into his power; and since that time the
Balinese rule has been established in Lombock.
This of course is the storv. But is it not doubtful whether a series
*/ m m
of events which occurred at short intervals have not all been rolled into
one by tradition?
Considering the close proximity of the islands it is more than probable
that communication and connection between Bali and Lombock existed
at a much earlier period and that the repeated marauding incursions of
the more powerful race of the Hindu-Balinese led up to the ultimate
extension of power. As a matter of fact, we find mentioned in Van Bek?s
writings, that the cause of the Rajah of Praja?s troubles with the other
'winces of Lombock, was his being on too friendly terms with the
foreigners ?the Balinese ?and even before that, the reigning princes of
the two islands had intercourse with one another. For instance the
prince GustiWayan Taga, who reigned over Lombock from 1741 to 1775
under the supreme authority of Bali, was on his father?s side a de-
scendent of the Sassaks, although his mother was of Balinese descent.
There remains no doubt about the fact that since the middle of last
century the Balinese have ruled Lombock and their influence has been
paramount.
This is an opportune moment to speak of the Hindu-Balinese institu-
tions and religion, for without a knowledge of these things it is impos-
sible to obtain an insight into the social conditions of Bali and Lombock.
The religion of the Balinese permeates their whole existence ?their gods
are present everywhere, they are all-powerful and exercise a direct
influence over every act of their lives.
?If a child smiles in its sleep it is a token that its guardian angel is
watching over it; abundant rains and plentiful crops are other proofs of
the goodness of the gods, who frequently place themselves in communi-
cation with men and advise them how to act in the interest of their
dessas or their families. It is thought that the deities when in a bad
temper or angered send all sorts of misfortunes, such as epidemics, or
bad harvests, etc. Their favours are gratefully acknowledged, but it is
their anger which most influences the people, who spare no efforts or
sacrifices to propitiate them and turn aside their resentment.?
Was not the death of the notable Balinese woman on the day planned
for the murderous attack on our troops looked upon as an ill-omen and
a warning from the gods to delay? .... How grateful we ought to be
to that warning!
If amongst many sects we often find traces of their earlier beliefs.

this is certainly a marked characteristic in the Hindu-Balinese religion,
which is largely interspersed with the tenets of the original creed of
the Malays.
The ancient Malay faith was a pure worship of nature, with the sun
as chief deity, while ranking next in order came those deceased persons,
who had been raised to the dignity of gods, and whose protection was
sought against the evil spirits who were wont to dwell in the houses,
woods, rivers, etc.
In some cases it was necessary to appease the spirits by blood-offer-
ings; and here and there human sacrifices have occurred.
Friederich asserts in his oft-mentioned ?Previous Report? that he
has been able to ascertain by means of indirect questioning that human
sacrifices have taken place in Bali.
? A former ruler of Karang Assim having been defeated in war, sought
to be restored to the favor of the gods by the sacrifice of a human
life. He took one of his slaves into a wood, killed him, clothed the
body and placed it amongst the other offerings. Whilst the pandita
(priest) was reciting the invocations from the Veda, * the wind got up
suddenly and raising the covering revealed the sight of a human form.
A curse overtook the foolhardy king, who was never restored to power.
?Another well-known instance is that of the prince who had also decided
to sacrifice a slave; in the dark of night he went in search of him, but
found his own son instead, who was roasted on a spear and sacrificed.
?It would be difficult to deny these two facts, for regarding the
former, I not only heard of it at Badong, but it was confirmed by Men-
goei who was a faithful friend and ally of Karang Assim; but of course
the people there refuse to acknowledge the truth of it.
The second one about the prince of Gianjar is spoken off openly.
Whether this ghastly custom still prevails in a densely populated country
where the common man is a slave ?}? and of no value, I dare not
undertake to state. In the ?Yerh. v. h. Bat. Genootsch. XII? we learn
that on the night of the 7th March 1875, the people were assembled
to offer sacrifices and amongst the remains of dogs, ducks, pigs and
other animals, besides the usual profusion of fruit and flowers, there
was also the dead body of a man, whose demise would, according to the
pemangkoe, avert the prevailing epidemic.
* The Yedas occupy the highest place both in the Balinese and in the Hindu literature.
They comprise all the prescribed formulas of prayer for the use of the priests, whether for
private or public functions, or on occasions of rejoicing or sacrifice. They remain a secret for
all, excepting the Brahmins, who are taught by the panditas. Friederich says they are all
written in pure Sanskrit; in his opinion it would he of the utmost importance to master the
contents of the Yedas, for this knowledge alone could render it possible to understand their
religion in its entirety; furthermore, we might deduce from such knowledge a standard
whereby to judge the state of Hinduism at the time it spread its influence over the Indian
Archipelago and also be enabled to learn more of the Polynesian civilization at that period.
f This is less correct. The common man belongs to the u Sudras.? He only becomes a
slave under certain circumstances, as in case of debt, or for having committed a crime, punish-
able by a fine, he is unable to pay. The wife and children of a criminal caught red-handed
and the wife and daughters of a ?Sudra,? dying without leaving sons or brothers, become the
property of the prince.


As a result of the fear inspired by our government, which naturally
prohibits human sacrifices, the custom has been discontinued in Bali,
)ut in Lombock, where our authority was much less felt, these occur-
rences must have been frequent.
Wallace tells us that during his visit to Labuan Trmg, on the S. W.
coast of Lombock, he one evening overheard his servant and a Malay
man whispering earnestly together outside his door and could distinguish
various allusions to ?krisses, throat-cutting, heads, etc., etc.? At length
his servant came in looking very serious and frightened and said in
English, ?Sir ?must take care; no safe here; ?want cut throat.? On
further enquiry it turned out that the Malay had arrived with the news
that the Rajah had just sent orders to the village, that he required a
certain number of ? reads? for an offering in the temples, to secure a
good crop of rice.
Two or three other Malays and Bugis confirmed the news and declared
that it was an annual custom and that it would be most inexpedient to
neglect the warning and go out alone, as every one had to be most
cautious and watchful. Wallace endeavoured to persuade them that it
was a mere tale and he himself continued his daily wanderings and
researches in the woods. Although no harm did overtake him, this is in
all probability due to his being a European; but if we take this narrative
in conjunction with the previous ones, I do not think that the statements
of the natives are to be dismissed so lightly.
Another curious surviving custom of the early Malay religion is the
high honour bestowed on the ? Raboet-Sedana (a doll made of coppers).
Once a year this image is carried out of the dessa temple on a golden
litter, and arrayed in gala clothes; it is carried to the edge of a
stream or to the sea shore in order to celebrate its birthday with the
sea-gods. On this or similar occasions the religious ceremonies con-
nected with the festivities, are presided over by the ?Pemangkoes?
(village-priests) and the Hindu priests keep in the background.
A few of the religious practices have still been retained, although
the Hindu conquerors have thrown the mantle of their official religion
over the shoulders of the ancient paganism of the Malays.
But even this religion of the conquerors was itself a medley of Budhism
and Sivaism.
The Budhists, so says de Hollander in his ? Handbook der Land- en
Volkenkunde van Ned. Oost-lndie, ? were certainly first on the scene
and came direct from India to Bali and although only met with in limited
numbers, one finds them in a few villages, like Boeleleng, Karangassim
and Gjangar. They all profess to belong to the highest class. In contra-
distinction to the Saivas, they eat beef and the flesh of horses and dogs.
There is an odd combination of ?Budhism and Sivaism in the fire
feasts? of the princes. On these occasions the sacred water of the
pandita of Siva is mingled with that of the pandita of Budha, as a
symbol that the followers of the former require the aid of the latter
and that Budhism is still a sub-division of the Balinese religion.

Thus the Kawi manuscripts are written partly by the Saivas and

Gate of the Poeri at Tjakra-Nagara.
The followers of the two religions are allowed to intermarry, in which
case the wife adopts her husband?s faith.


According to the panditas the connection between the two religions
is as that of an elder brother (Siva) to a younger (Budha). They live
at peace with each other.
In former times the Budhist influence was very strong and it is still
customary on great festivals for priests of both religions to officiate, but
the majority have accepted Brahminism and are worshippers of Siva,
who has supplanted all the other Gods and sects of Hinduism.
The key note of the Balinese belief is propitiation and reverence:
propitiation of the evil spirits and reverence for the birthplace of
the family ancestors and for the gods who govern the destinies of the
earth.
The predominant element in the religion of the Hindus in Lombock
and Bali is fear, accompanied by a natural and incessant desire to
appease the wrath of the evil spirits. These ?boetas?, as they are
called, fill the air, and not content with punishing men for crimes they
may have committed, they take the greatest delight in tormenting poor
mortals, simply as an enjoyable pastime!
It is especially towards evening that extra precautions are necessary,
that being the favorite hour for their wanderings, when they try to
force their way into peoples? dwellings. Under the circumstances the
only thing to be done is to try and pacify them; so it frequently
happens that the mother of a family will place food of various kinds
in front of her house and even a light to show the ?boeta? the way.
It is always considered a good omen if the spirits partake of the
nourishment provided for them ?in that case they proceed upon their
journey without attempting to enter the house.
The remains of the ?boetas? meal are much appreciated by the dogs
and pigs, the Balinese domestic animals.
Notwithstanding all the precautions that are taken the spirits do
sometimes succeed in penetrating into the houses and therefore special
offerings are made from time to time; this is usually done on the eve
of the Balinese New Year?s day, when a choice selection is placed in
the middle of the ?erf? (homestead).
But even this is insufficient; once a year every dessa must be exorcised
thoroughly and this ceremony has always to be carried out at the time
of a new moon. The first thing to be done is to define most accurately
the boundaries of every dessa; this being accomplished, the ceremony
of driving away the boetas begins ?this ceremony is called ?Menjepi?;
this is the only occasion on which the Balinese discard their krisses.
The following description is given by Van Eck in the ?Tijdsch. voor
Ned.-Indie,? 1879:
?When the ?kalas? and ?boetas? have enjoyed free scope for a
long time, the earth becomes ?panas,? (heated) then the ?padanda?
decrees that they must be driven away by force. In accordance with
this command the whole population of the village or surrounding district
assembles in front of the chief temple, where a large scaffold is erected


at the cross roads. The offerings (banten) are arranged round it in the
shape of a compass; this form is chosen, so as to prevent any of the
? dewas ? fancying that they have been forgotten and thus feeling
inclined to wreak their vengeance by depriving the ceremony of its
power. The necessary offerings for the wicked spirits are not forgotten.
Everything being ready the ?padanda? appears in magnificent robes
and ascends the scaffold, now dignified by the name of ? pampoespa-an ?,
and sprinkles the ?beten? with holy water and mumbles the prayers.
Beneath him are a male and a female priest who join in the invocations.
As soon as ?and it is now seven in the evening?the end of' the
prayer is notified, one of the bystanders blows the ? socngoe ? (a trumpet
made out of a shell) in order to summon the ?kalas? and the ?boetas?
to the repast. At the same time several of the men approach and
light their torches at the sacred lamp burning before the priest. As
soon as they have done this they disperse in all directions, followed by
the multitude, they rush through all the streets and lanes shouting:
?megedi,? ?megedi?! (go away, go away.) Wherever they pass, those
who have been compelled to stay at home, come rushing out of their
houses and try to assist in driving away the demons, by banging the
doors, beating the trees, etc., etc. The poor ?kalas?, unaccustomed
to all this noise, come forth from their hiding-places and hasten to
partake of the feast prepared for them, but then growing afraid of the
curse, so recently uttered against them, they all vanish into the air in
less than no time. One solitary one, who cannot resist the ?tjaroe?
(dainties) tarries in the neighbourhood, but he is so startled by the
sound of the big drum that he hastens to follow in the track of his
brothers. Finally the last of the evil spirits has departed and the
tremendous uproar and tumult is succeeded by a deathlike stillness,
which continues the whole of the next day. The ? kalas ? would
naturally ask for nothing better than to return once more - to their old
haunts, so in order to make them believe that the country they now
see is an uninhabited island and not Bali, everybody is obliged to
remain indoors for the next twenty-four hours. Everything is to be
at a standstill and all house-work, especially cooking, is to be scru-
pulously avoided. Only the ?sambangs? or watchmen are allowed to
appear in the streets. In order to warn strangers, all the entrances to
the exorcised village or district are decorated with wreaths of thorns
and leaves and whoever ventures to pass the barrier thus marked is
fined by the watchmen, even the prince himself not being exempt. The
roads are not open till the third day; even then, buying and selling
in the market is forbidden, as also working in the sawahs. The
natives never indulge in walking for their pleasure, so they content
themselves with filling up the remainder of the time with card- and
dice-playing.
Whilst an epidemic is raging, or under any other exceptional circum-
stances these exorcisms are not considered sufficient and other means
are resorted to to appease the ?boetas?, and then it is that these


sanguinary sacrifices are made and we are afraid that human victims
are then offered np. .
Dr. Jacobs relates various instances of the fear inspired by the
?boetas? and the consequent superstition of the Balinese:
?A woman, who is with child, is very apt during that time to look
upon most ordinary events as bad omens. In her imagination she sees
hundreds of ?kalas?, having designs against her life 01 that of her
child or wanting to take her period of pregnancy one of great anxiety.
The whining of a dog, the croaking of a bird, the action of a crater,
etc., all fill her with fear; her personal enemies, even the people
with whom she has been on friendly terms, try to bewitch her so as
to endanger her life or her child?s, and then in her despair she frequently
resorts to some known means and offers up her unborn child in order
to save her own life.
? Should a Balinese woman give birth to twins of different sexes?
curiously called ?kembar boentjing?, (?twin flowers? or ?twin brides?)
she is taken forthwith to the churchyard after her confinement and
the children are carried to her; here she must remain for three months
in a hastily built hut and her food is brought to her. Her house is
burned to the ground, thus forcing her husband and other members of
the family to seek a home elsewhere; the dessa in which the house
stands has to be cleansed; the temples of the dessa, excepting those
dedicated to the memory of the dead, remain closed for 60 days;
innumerable offerings are made and the dessa, as well as the mother
and children are sprinkled with holy water (toja tirta); and all this is
done in order to wipe out the incest committed in the mother s womb.
Only the wife of the prince or of a Brahmin is exempt. It is easy to
understand, says Dr. Jacobs, that this religious ceremony in many cases,
demands the sacrifice of a human life.
?Should a woman ?or yet a domestic animal ?give birth to
misformed offspring, this is looked upon as a warning that some
calamity is about to befall her dessa and the prince has at once to
be informed of the fact; he then commands a religious ceremony, called
?prajastiata,? to take place, in order to propitiate the gods.
?If a woman dies in state of pregnancy, her body is not allowed
either to be buried or to be burnt, but as a sign of the greatest con-
tempt, it is hurled down a precipice, or placed in an open grave or
hole two feet deep, this, according to Balinese notions, being the greatest
dishonour that can be shown to any one. No exceptions are made in
these cases, the same fate befalling princesses.?
In the same measure as the Balinese look upon it as a great favor
of the gods to have many children, especially sons, or to have the
children ?selat boenga?, (that is, alternate boy and girl) so do they
equally despise a woman who is childless. Naturally the fault lies with
her and her husband has therefore the right to leave her. Needless to
say that newly-married couples are most profuse in their offerings to
the patron god of hymen, Dewa Boetoehaja or Dewa Sanbangan!


The treatment of all illnesses is very simple; either the people use
some indigenous plant, directions for the inward and outward application
of which are contained in a recipe book called ?oesada?, or they offer
sacrifices to the gods and the ?baljan? (native doctor) mutters some
invocations from the ?mantras? (secret writings). Witchcraft??nglejak ?
is the chief source of all sickness. If it can be proved (!) that any one
has by means of sorcery brought illness or misfortune on another, that
person is banished from the kingdom; formerly the penalty of death was
inflicted. Sorcery is not foreign to the Hindu belief, and is probably
entirely of Hindu origin, thinks Dr. Jacobs.
If the ?baljan? is unsuccessful in his treatment, then it must be a
?kala? that is opposed to the recovery or has lodged himself inside
the patient. It not only happens that the ?boetas? look upon men as
their dwelling-places, but sometimes in obedience to the gods they
assume the shape of noxious animals like monkeys, tigers, etc., etc., and
in this guise they visit men.
Naturally the Balinese entertain a superstitious fear of these animals
and never slay them unnecessarily, yet they are not worshipped by
them as in India and Further-India. N either do they worship the ? boetas ?; ?
they fear them too much. Their images are only tolerated at the
entrance of the temples over which they watch, or if within the pre-
cincts, they are placed at a distance from the temples.
Just outside the temple gate is a stone alms-chest the ?tangoe? ?in
which offerings are placed from time to time for the ?boeta?, who is
appointed guardian of the temple. Besides that many private residences
are watched over by the ?boetas?, yet the Balinese never feel quite
sure about them, for if anything mysterious happens, the ?boetas? are
always blamed.... and their favor is again sought for by renewed
offerings.
Having done everything to keep the evil spirits at a distance, thought
is then given to the remaining duties, and foremost amongst these is
?worship of the place of one?s origin.? Many families have increased
so rapidly that it has become impossible to continue living together, or
some have left their homes to improve their positions, or out of fear
of punishment or from other causes and finally they have become heads
of families in other dessas.
As soon as they are able to do so, they build places of sacrifice in
the dessas where their forefathers lived, and at certain periods of the
year make pilgrimages thither, which are frequently attended by numerous
difficulties and dangers, especially where the distances are great.
Temples belonging to the members of one family, ? kaboejoetan ?, are
called ? poera-dadia ? and ?poera-iboe? and form the connecting link
between the different branches of the scattered stock. For the
benefit of their common interests they have instituted societies
? seka-dadia ?, and furthermore they select one from their midst to
guard the temple and make all the necessary preparations when the day
of sacrifice arrives.


It is impossible to say much harm of a people showing such a spirit
of sacrifice and faithful affection for family ties. We think that these
grown up children may be made tractable and in time good and faithful
subjects of the government, but on one condition only! We will refer
to it later and for the present we will try and add to our knowledge
of these poor people. 1
A slight acquaintance with their mode of worship cannot fail to be
interesting. Correctly speaking, that is to say according to the teachings
of the panditas, there exists, only one god, Siva, who is the equivalent
of Batara Suria or the sun god, that is, the soul of nature, ruling all
the forces of nature. He is the creator, the sustainer, the destroyer.
He is addressed by the names of all the Indian gods by the people,
who in their childlike ignorance labour under the delusion that there
are several different deities. Thus Maheswara, (the great god) the son
of Siva, is none other than. Siva himself and Iris wife Uma and his
children are simply attributes of his far-reaching supremacy, evidences
of his creative power. Likewise Kala, and his wife Durga, with all his
followers, ?boetas? or rakshas represent nothing more than the capac-
ities of the god to punish, to harm and to destroy.
The large image in the temple represents Siva as seated on a high
pedestal with his legs crossed, his arms and ankles profusely adorned
with bracelets and anklets; the imprint of the trident is on his forehead
and he wears a garland of human skulls round his neck. The symbol
of Siva is the Lingam, emblematic of creation, which follows destruction.
Bor fear of being too discursive, we will not go into many details,
but we will just remark that whereas in India ? Vishnu ? is looked
upon as ?the lord of the Earth?, in Bali he is considered more as
?god become man? and occupying a far inferior rank to Siva, and is
introduced as the hero in their epics simply to give additional lustre to
the teachings of Budha or Siva.
Neither is Brahma ever worshipped, excepting on the occasions of
general feasts when one altar is erected in honour of Brahma and
Vishnu who share one heaven; and this altar is never of stone and
always destroyed again after the solemnities.
According to the panditas Brahma and Vishnu and Siva are co-equal
and together constitute the trinity or ?Trimurti?.
Indra has a third eye like Siva; although one of the inferior gods,
he ranks with the Balinese after Siva. He is however looked upon as
a malignant deity, and consequently held in great awe; many sacrifices
are made to him and he has a temple specially dedicated to him.
?Besides the sun-god,? says Liefrinck, ?who sends plenteous rains to
refresh the earth and make the crops grow, or who at times destroys
the harvests, the Balinese have peopled nature with numberless other
divinities. These gods are supposed to roam about across seas and
lakes, resting either in the valleys or in the trees, or else in the houses


'
or the burial grounds. The habitations of the superior gods are sup-

posed to be in the mountains, in that chain of mountains which runs
through Bali from East to West, in particular the peak of Rindjani,


which rises above Lombock. The simple-minded native, who rarely
leaves his dessa and never the island looks up with reverence to these
colossal masses, connecting as it were heaven and earth, and always
half shrouded in mysterious clouds.
And on the topmost summit, his Olympus, sojourns the supreme god
of all the gods! .
We will now proceed to describe their mode of worship.
Although the ?Oesana Bali? speaks of six great temples in Bah,
dedicated to the worship of Siva?probably erected by the Hmdu-
Javanese at the time of their invasion?and though the princes and
notables still continue to make use of them for their sacrifices, these
are not the places of common worship. With the Balinese, religion
bears the distinct mark of individuality and each person prefers to
worship in his own way and at his own convenience and with his own
family: hence the prominent place assigned to the home-temple .
Each family dwells on its own ? pekarangan ?, (estate, seat) frequently
very extensive and always separated from the outei woild by a nail
high enough to prevent being overlooked.
As we shall often have to refer later on to these ?homesteads
enclosed by walls, it will be instructive to hear what Dr. Jacobs says
about them:
?Entrance to the enclosure is obtained through a narrow doorway
and it is built over with a number of small huts or sheds of wood or
clay, representing the respective homes of the various members of the
family or household. The space which is left vacant between the house
gets filled up with fruit parings and the excrements of both man and
beast, heaped-up leaves, etc., and the refuse which is despised as food
by the swarms of pigs and dogs and chickens that wandei about at
leisure, is left to accumulate until it grows to one vast manure heap.
The little sheds are small, damp and low; daylight is admitted through
the door, and the cracks in the walls and the roof serve as ventilators.
In the middle of the square or yard is a sort of ?pendopo? where
guests are received, but the ?bale mambeng?, which serves as their
sleeping apartment, contrasts favorably, both as regard cleanliness and
decorations, with all the rest. Though the ?bale mambeng? is con-
sidered more especially the guest room, still visitors are frequently
housed in other bales. With the exception of the ? Oemah-meten ?
(private abode), all the little huts are shared in common by the various
members of the family and their cattle and poultry, which are allowed
to come and go as they please?.
In every one of these homesteads a special portion is allotted to the
worship of the gods; this portion is Availed in and the gateway is
protected on each side by stone guardians placed at the entrance. The
* The description of this and other temples is mostly borrowed from Liefrinck.


enclosure shows more signs of care than the homestead itself and trees
and flowers are often planted there.
On one or more sides of the walls are rows of little wooden com-
partments or stone recesses, each one dedicated to some particular deity.
The gods are invoked here from time to time, hence the appellation of
? pasimpangan ?, which signifies a place where someone remains temporarily.
Naturally the god ? Gunong-Agong? has a ?pasimpangan? in every
temple, whilst at the same time about ten other gods dwell there too
and these may be designated as the special family gods, from whom
assistance and counsel is expected in times of difficulty.
On his wedding-day a man at once erects his own little altar ?his
? sanggah kemoelan ?, first hurriedly of leaves and branches, later on
of bamboo, and only when this falls to pieces through decay is he
allowed to replace it by a wooden one.
The women of the household take daily offerings of fruit and flowers
and on the birthdays of the gods or of any member of the family,
there are special ceremonies and large quantities of incense are consumed.
As regards the men, they are perhaps less assiduous in the fulfilment
of their religious duties, still they would never think of starting on a
journey without making an offering to the gods and in case of sickness
befalling their children they always make offerings to the deities to try
and turn aside their displeasure.
Does not this child-like trust and familiarity with the gods speak of
the innate goodness of these people?
Just as all matters immediately touching the family are prayed for
in these home temples, so all things concerning more general business
are prayed for in the ?dessa? temple, which is for the common use.
The greater part of these temples ?also called ? Prajangan' or ? poera ?
or ?poeri? * ?are composed of two or three different enclosures sur-
rounded by walls.
The exterior of these walls built of brick is decorated with carved
Hindu figures.
Admission to the first enclosure is obtained through a narrow door,
the ?tjandi bentar?. The most conspicuous object here is the waringin
tree, the sacred tree of the Hindus, but the space is not much utilized;
sometimes it contains a ?bale? or ?pendopo?, where discussions or
conferences are held.
A stone gateway, generally in pyramid shape and provided with a
small ornamental door, leads to the second enclosure, which in a half
and half sort of way is considered to be the temple. In this precinct
assemblies are held, preparatory arrangements for festivals and sacrifices
and sometimes even oaths are taken here.
Still, in cases of the three higher classes of Balinese?(about their
caste later on) ?this is only done at the cross-ways of a public road.
* ?Prajangan? is correctly speaking the general name for places where the gods are
worshipped in common. ?Poera? means the same thing, hut does not always refer to a
temple; wa know that the residences of the princes and notables are called ?Poeris?.


The swearing or taking of an oath with the Balinese, has a different
meaning to what we understand thereby, with them it means: ?the
denial of an accusation ?, An oath thus taken sets at naught the
verdict of any judge, even though one should be convinced that it is
a false oath. But the perjurer is severely punished and does not
escape from the anger of the gods.
The temple proper, separated from this second enclosure by a second
wall with stone gateway, is composed of endless small shrines for the
gods. The simplest are small wooden or stone recesses, placed on
pedestals of the same level. On a higher level, which is reached by
means of steps, are small compartments for the higher gods ?these
compartments are roofed with tiles and have miniature doorways leading
into them.
The highest kind of house for the gods is the ?meroe?; ?borrowed
from Hinduism?lt consists of a little wooden erection with from three
to eleven pyramidical raised roofs, placed one over the other and getting
smaller and smaller as they near the top.
The red brick walls decorated with carvings and adorned with figures
in bas relief representing characters in Hindu history; the doorways
adorned with flowers and foliage, all point to a strongly developed
artistic feeling in these people, the more so that the implements with
which all this arduous work has been accomplished were of the most
primitive kind.
The actual offerings are seldom made here ?at least less often than
in the home temples ?and as a rule it is only when there is a full
moon or a new moon or some special day which is considered as par-
ticularly marked out to obtain favors of the gods.
In every temple there are one or more images, not much bigger than
a doll you could carry in your hand, and they are made of ?kepengs?
(tiny copper coins). The belief is that the gods enter into these images
when they wish to leave the temples and be conveyed to the sea-shore
or the river.
The Balinese look upon their divinities as invisible beings, who have
fixed places of abode but are not bound to remain there. The other
wooden or stone images found in the temples do not represent the gods,
but as a rule personages from some of their legends and they serve as
watchers over the temple.
They enter into communication with their gods upon every important
circumstance of their lives; in prosperity and in adversity; at the
beginning of their agricultural labours, when building a new house, or
at the commencement of any undertaking the Balinese never fail to
consult the gods.
In the neighbourhood of all these temples there is generally a big
tree and failing that, a wooden or stone pillar, containing a small
recess; this is supposed to be the abode of the ?taksoe? or intermediary,
also an invisible being, not possessing divine power, but who transmits
the wishes of men to the deity.

? When the members of the dessa come to the temple to consult the
god, they place themselves on the ground close to where the ? taksoe ?
dwells. By previous offerings they have sought to make him favorably
inclined to their requests and now they implore of him to enter the
Gate before the great waringin tree at Ampenan.
body of one of those present in worship; meanwhile all are being
prepared to receive the spirit by the copious use of incense and by oft
repeated formulas of invocation.
At a given moment one of those present loses consciousness?there


is nothing new' under the sun-and begins making spasmodic move-
ments-; this betokens that the ? taksoe ? has entered his body
The first question put to the individual possessed, is, whether the god
they want to invoke is present in the temple and whether he is ready
to listen to them. ? +1
After some little lapse of time?the ? taksoe is delivering the mes-
sage to the deity and waiting for the reply-the answer is given by the
mouth of the privileged patient, and the ?taksoe having fulfilled is
earthly mission quits his temporary earthly dwelling and the dessa
man regains consciousness. . ,
The deity has declared his willingness to receive audiences; how are
the offerings made to him and how are the prayers of these poor
mortals conveyed to him? . ~ ....
It is natural that these should be fitting occasions for the requisition
of the priest?s services.* . . , , Q T u*.
What are they like, these Brahminical priests or padandas? in what
does their office consist? ? . , ~ ,
The principal distinguishing mark of a ?padanda is the tightly
drawn-back hair, tied up in a roll or coil, in which more often than
not are one or two lotus flowers ?the sacred flowers of the Hindu, the
symbol of the sun, who calls them to the water?s surface when he rises
and bids them disappear when he sets.
He wears his sarong falling to Ins feet, not drawn up like the othci
Balinese. He never walks in the street without his crook, which is a
little taller than he is himself. Whilst performing the sacred rites m
the temple he wears rich and costly robes. It would take too long o
describe these in detail,
. , . . . 1 1 * i*
Friederich as to how he acquits himself of his duties in the service of

?The ?padanda? is then clothed in white, the upper part of the
body is naked according to the Balinese-Indian custom. He sits facing
the East; on a wooden board in front of him are vases containing
water and some flowers, a few grains of rice, a chafing-dish and a
bell. Whilst mumbling some incomprehensible words or prayers from
the Veda, he dips the flowers into the water and then with the thumb
and forefinger of his right hand he waves towards the East, while he
stirs up the contents of the chafing-dish and mixes a few grams of
rice with the fire. Having continued in prayer for some time, and
* There are persons?a few, called ? permas ???who are preordained to serve as earthly
When therefore any one desires to take counsel with the gods, the ?perma is requested
to come to the temple. Sometimes he swoons even before leaving his house. In that case
he is carried to the temple with the utmost reverence, so that the god may enter into his
body at once. At other times it takes longer for them to become unconscious and
then great quantities of incense are used and the patient is surrounded by chanting
men and women anxious for him to fall into the desired state Finally the soul of
the ?perma? quits his body temporarily, to make room for the ? dewa , and any

making all sorts of gestures with his hands and twirling about some
rosary-beads, he finally appears to be possessed with the spirit of
divinity. Siva has as it were transferred himself into the padanda.
This is further proved by the convulsive movements of the body as he
becomes more and more agitated. Now that he is the earthly abode of
the god, he not only wafts the flowers towards the East, but also
towards his own person to show honour to the divinity who has
honoured him with his presence. The bells are not used for the every
day ceremonies, but only when there is a new or a full moon and w r hen
there are burnt offerings.
?The Padanda is thoroughly purified by these acts of devotion; all
his actions, even his partaking of earthly food, are considered sacred.
He only has one meal a day and nobody is present excepting his own
children, who wait upon him and this is always done in silence. The
leavings of his repast are like ? amreta ? (ambrosia) and are much in
demand by every one, even by the princes when they have a ? pandada ?
staying with them or are staying with him, and they eat the broken
bits. The water, which the pandada uses during the religious functions,
becomes sanctified by the reading of the invocations from the ?Veda?
and the people eagerly buy this ?toja tirta? to sprinkle their dead with
and to cook the offerings with?and the sale of it brings in a large
income to the priest.?
Another source of income is the fines imposed on men sentenced to
death; the padandas as members of the ?kerta? take a tenth part;
and generally speaking, when they are raised to the dignity of priest-
hood the prince either lends them or gives them out and out a slice of
?sawah? land.
Their spiritual influence is incalculable; no Balinese would ever
entertain the idea of consigning to the earth the mortal remains of any
relative without seeking the assistance of the padanda, the intermediary
between gods and men and his services are abundantly rewarded by the
bestowal of many material proofs of gratitude.
Cremation always takes place under his supervision.
Not a marriage, not a journey, not any work of importance, not even
a cock-fight comes off without his approval and blessing.
He is the man of learning, he studies the general and the sacred
Kawi literature; he instructs the youthful Brahmins in the knowledge
of the Vedas; he is also the astronomer and he it is who regulates
the Calendar.
Then he blesses all weapons; every weapon is brought to him first
by the manufacturer and then again by the purchaser; he says some
prayers over it and it is only then that the weapon becomes of any real
value and is strengthened to do its work ?in return for this service the
padanda is made the recipient of offerings, varying according to the
position and means of the donor.
Although the priests enjoy these and other advantages, still the office
is not much coveted, and few young Brahmins enter upon this state


before having had their share of this world?s pleasures. The privations
enioined upon them are not very many; true they may only have one
meal a day and are forbidden the use of beef, pork and chickens still
the prohibition to have more than four wives does not point to a very
austere mode of life! , . ?
To all outward appearances the padandas have not much influence in
worldly matters. This is naturally circumscribed in public, owing to the
distinctions of caste, but it is impossible to estimate in how far they
bring it to bear in private and there is no doubt, that even in state
affairs their influence may be said to be unlimited amongst a people
who look upon them as invested with supernatural powers and holding
in their hands the destiny of man.
As a rule the Hindu priest is good-natured and tolerant like the
doctrine he inculcates; he is the veriest stranger to ambition, for which
he usually lacks the energy. Is this perhaps a result of his early
student life and his late preferment?
Whatever view may be taken of the position, science owes a debt of
gratitude to these men; they it is who have made us acquainted with
the condition of the Javanese previous to the introduction of Moham-
medism; and they are even now the sole guardians of the ancient liteia-
ture; we must apply to them for information concerning the Kawi
language; and it is they who are still the interpreters of the ancient
Hindu laws and institutions, which they have faithfully transmitted from
generation to generation. .
Their influence over the people is undeniably great and it is a wise
policy always to bear this fact in mind!
In addition to the Brahminical priest, there is usually a ?pamang-
koe? attached to the temples. They are chosen from amongst the
people and we shall hear of them later on when describing the mode
of government existing in the dessas. Their position towards the gods
is a very humble one and in the dessa chronicles they aie simply
referred to as ? djoero sapoehs (sweeper) of Ida Batara.
Although their daily duties simply consist in sweeping out the temple
and keeping watch over the sacred buildings, still the people of the
dessa see in a man so intimately associated with sacred things a person
of undoubted importance and he is surrounded by a certain amount of
reverence even in his every day acts disconnected with his services in the
temple and he exercises considerable influence over the inhabitants of
his dessa. The pamangkoe shows the utmost indifference for all the
gods outside his own dessa, nor does he care for the manner of this
outside worship. .
As a proof of the strong bond between their religion and their daily
life, we will describe how they celebrate a great festival both in the
dessa temple and in the home temple.
It is the festival of ?Galoengan? or New Year, which recurs every
six months, each month consisting of five weeks, making in all about
210 days.

The Javanese and the Malays content themselves with paying visits to
their friends and acquaintances on this day, but not so the Balinese;
they are only too glad to seize the opportunity of celebrating the
opening of the New Year by seasonable festivities. As is customary
amongst Christians, so do the Balinese likewise try to arrange their
affairs so as to
spend the last few
days of the old year
in the circle of their
families?another
proof of their love
of home?and these
days are employed
in great prepara-
tions for the ap-
proaching festival.
Every day has its
fixed task: on one
day the fresh picked
fruits are put into

pared, on a third
the sweetmeats are

and lastly ?this

And the poor are
not forgotten either.
Various dessa so-
cieties send their
contributions and
the needy even
receive their share
of the fatted boar!
Hindoe sacrifice houses at Ampenan.
But New Year?s clay is before all tilings a religious festival and here
once more every effort is put forth to soothe ?the gods and the wicked
spirits?. According to the teaching of their priests the Balinese ought
always on New Year?s day to make a pilgrimage to the sacred mountain
of ?Gunong Agong?, in order to return thanks to the gods for the
benefits received during the course of the year. As however it would
irove a matter of very great difficulty in most cases, a way out of it
,ias been found. A tall bamboo cane, called ?pendjor? is stuck in the
ground in front of every homestead and on it is fastened a long piece
6


of white calico, cut in shape of a home temple; this flag, waving in
the air, is saluting the gods of Gunong Agong in the name of the
inhabitants and telling them, that although unable to bring their
offerings in person, they will not fail in their duties to the family
temple? and offerings in the shape of ?kepengs? are placed on the top
of the bamboo cane or ?pendjor?, as they call it.
?After all these preparations?, says van Bijck, ?Galoengan? has
dawned. ,
?At an early hour every one is up and doing. Towards 8 a.m. the
entire family, all dressed in their Sunday best, the girls decorated with
rings and flowers, the little boys with their father?s krisses, proceed to
the? home temple to place the prepared meats, with the fruit and
flowers on the altars. Then follows a sort of silent ceremony, though
not always peaceful and the moment is anxiously awaited when the gods
shall signify their acceptance of the offerings.
?Everything is then packed up again and carried home and further
preparations are made for the banquet. The busy housewife hastens
to collect the least ripe fruit, the most faded flowers, the least sought
after sweetmeats from the different dishes and platters and entrusts
these to her daughters to distribute amongst the various implements,
such as the ploughs, the looms, the rice block, etc., as offerings to the
evil spirits, so as to give them no cause for jealousy on this day of
?Galoengan?. To guard themselves from harm, all the members of the
household sprinkle themselves at intervals during the day with ?toja
tirta?, which they have bought from the padanda for a few pence.
?Meanwhile, no matter how enticing may be the ?tjeleng?, or how
appetizing the sweetmeats, the hour for the feast has not yet struck.
After the celebrations in the private temples, it is obligatory for every
one to go to the public temple as well.?
On the whole the ceremonial here is much the same as that in the
private temples; when it is over, the women, before proceeding to their
homes, visit the graves of their deceased relatives, where they place
cooked rice, flowers and fruit.
This visit leads us up to the subject of the second temple, which is
either in or close to every dessa next to the common burying-place, and
this temple is called ?poera dalem? or ?temple of death?. The arrange-
ments here are in most respects similar to those of the dessa-
temples; the chief divinity here is Durga, the wife of the evil Kala
and the head of the Boetas or Rakshas. She is the authoress of all
the ills that befall mankind, she rules over the dark powers and her
worship is one of mystery; those desirous of learning the art of sorcery
(nglejak) have recourse to her and in addition to their numerous
offerings they spend many nights in the temple of death.
She it is who receives the souls of the dead and delivers them over
to the judges appointed to decide whether their lives upon earth were
such as to entitle them to a place in heaven or whether they are to be
doomed to hell.

In cases of serious illness Durga is always invoked with great fervour.
?When the patient has arrived at such a stage ?says Liefrinck?that,
although life is not yet extinct, still he is unconscious of what is going
on around him, the people think that his soul has already left his body,
but is still on earth in the temple with Batari Durga. All hope is not
abandoned and the nearest relatives of the sick man go to the much-
feared goddess and try by various offerings and promises to obtain the
Dewa temple at Tjakranagara.
release of the soul. They remain in her temple indifferent to time,
until the divinity shall either intimate through the oracle what the
necessary means for recovery are, or until it becomes apparent that all
hope must be relinquished.
Besides the temples already named, there are others maintained by
the dessas and these are dedicated to the sea-god ?poera segara? or
to the god of the hills ?poera boekit?, and are situated either on the
sea shore or in the woods or on the top of a hill. These gods not
having any permanent abodes and only visiting these temples at intervals,
the periods of their visits are chosen for the faithful to make pilgrim-


ages there and they go in procession carrying all the other gods in
gorgeous array to do them honour.
The task of erecting these temples is oftentimes most arduous, but
neither the inhabitants of the hills, nor the inhabitants of the coast
allow any obstacles to stand in their way and the dwellers on the hill
have their temple on the coast, and those on the coast have one in the hills.
Finally there are certain special temples built by certain families,
which for some reason or another are interested in having one and they
form themselves into a ?society? or ?pamaksan?, so that their com-
bined efforts may secure the building of a ?poera pamaksam ?; and
these are often met with in the different dessas.
Thus the agricultural and soebak societies have temples of their own,
dedicated to certain gods, as we shall see.
In the sawahs one frequently comes across ?bedoegoels?, viz., small
temples dedicated to ? Uma ?, the wife of Siva, and goddess of fertility,
of the crops, of abundance, of happiness. Her attire is similar to that
of Siva. ... her attitude, that of a ?ronggeng? or dancing-girl, is less
modest; but according to Tonkes, viewed from the standpoint of Malay
morals, the religious feeling is supposed to express itself by the twisting
about of hands and arms.
True, ?to the pure-minded, all is pure?, yet one cannot fail to be
struck by the mixture of immorality and religion existing amongst the
Balinese. It is evident that the Hindus, when introducing their pure
teaching to the island, were obliged to take into consideration not only
the very low standard of morality, but the sensuality of the early religion.
One of the chiefs institutions of Hindu origin and one that is deeply
rooted in the entire race is the spirit of caste.
In principle the caste divisions are the same in Bali and Lombock as
in India. The ?Brahmins?, from amongst whom the priests are chosen,
occupy the highest rank; the second rank comprises the ?Kshatryas?,
formerly consisting only of warriors, from amongst whom the princes
were originally selected; the third division or ?Yaisyas? were originally
the class of merchants and husbandmen, who however rose so high in
Lombock and Bali that the rulers were taken from this class; whilst all
who belong to none of these classes, forming as it were the nobility,
are reckoned among the Sudras. *
As in India these castes are again subdivided; but the custom still
in force there, that the members of each caste only follow certain
avocations, is no longer extant in Bali and Lombock, where all, even
the priests, are more or less occupied in agricultural pursuits.
Was the original introduction of these caste divisions intended to
create an impassable barrier between the high rank of the priests and
nobles and the inferior rank of the masses?
* According to the u Oesana Bali ? the Brahmins proceed from the mouth, the Kshatryas
from the arm, the u Taisyas ? from the thigh, and the Sudras from the foot of Brahma.


It is more than probable; for there has never been any hesitation or
shrinking from anything likely to foster such results.
Mother Nature, however, did not draw such fine distinctions, for she
made all her children?Brahmins as well as Sudras ?on the same
pattern and in Bali even the clothes do not make the man.... nor
the woman!
The every-day clothing of the Balinese man is composed simply of a
piece of blue calico falling from the hips to the knees and kept up by
a waist-cloth ?saboek ?and this he changes every five or six months.
On solemn occasions he adds to this scanty attire a ?sarong? or
?sapoet?, coming from the breast to the knees. He always carries his
ever faithful ?kris? in his saboek.
The princes and nobles also go about with the upper part of the
body exposed; naturally in their case, the ?kamben? is of finer
material and is wound round the body oftener, the waistband is more
ornamental and is interspersed with gold and silver threads, the sarong
is very costly, and the handle of the kris is beautifully ornamented?
but then all these things do not go to form a different type of man.
The women?s dress is also very plain and the same for all; two
kambens, one over the other, a red one on top of the blue one,
reaching to about a few inches below the knee and held up at the
waist by the ?saboek?; the under one, the shorter of the two is never
changed, but worn until it drops to bits; the upper one, has a slit on
the left side; further a ?selendang? ?called here a ?tenkaloeng? ?is
worn across the shoulders and that is the entire costume. The sarongs
are drawn up to the arm-pit by the women in the palaces or by women
nursing their children. On feast-days the girls and newly-married
women wear silver and gold bands round their arms and legs and in
their hair they put variegated flowers in great profusion; but as a rule
very slight attention is paid to hair-dressing.
Children ?boys and girls alike ?run about naked until their seventh
or eighth year.
Although to all outward appearances there is so little distinction
between the castes, that, ?according to Dr. Jacobs ?on meeting a stranger
the first question put by a Balinese is invariably; ?Antoeh linggih?
what caste do you belong to ? ?still the Brahmins ?the law-makers, have
taken good care that for all practical purposes a solid line of demarca-
tion should exist.
Unions have been allowed between men of the upper classes and
women belonging to the Sudra caste, and their children have been raised
to the rank of the father; but should a woman of the higher castes
venture to love a man beneath her, she is sentenced to death at once.
A girl of the Brahmin caste who should so far forget herself is burnt
to death and her lover is sewn in a sack, weighted with stones and
thrown into the sea. In the districts of Boeleleng and Djembrana now
under our rule, the death sentence is commuted by the ?kerta? ?court
of justice?to life-long exile from the island of Bali.


A girl belonging to the 2nd or 3rd class in whom the offence is not
looked upon as so heinous is only ?krissed?!
That this barbarous practice is entirely in unison with the customs
and feelings of the majority of the upper classes is proved by the fact,
that the parents of a girl, who has thus disgraced her family, feel no
grief at seeing her put to death, although in other matters of morality
their ideas are rather far advanced, as we shall see later on.
The principle of ?the same rights for all? is unknown amongst the
different castes; for instance no Sudra would think of sitting on any-
thing raised above the ground if anyone of a higher caste were sitting
on a mat. There is no doubt that round this question of ?sitting
high or low?, revolves the important mystery of Balinese etiquette!
It is in the administration of the law that the distinction of caste is
most noticeable, for the penalty for crime is always fixed in exact
opposition to the rank of the delinquent; for the same crime a man of
low rank would receive heavy punishment, whereas a man of high rank
would receive a light one.
How does the administration of justice take place?
In so far as it is possible all disputes are settled by the adminis-
trators of the dessas or soebaks. Matters of serious import or cases
where an agreement has not been arrived at in the dessas, are sub-
mitted to the prince?s decision.
The verdict of the prince is as a rule the result of advice from the
tadandas. Three or more of these form the ?kerta? or tribunal. The
litigants are assisted by ?kantjas? or lawyers. Van Bloemen Waanders
relates anent the sittings of ?kertas?, how on the appointed day, both
parties appear before the tribunal accompanied by their lawyers. No
one speaks. At a signal given by one of the judges, the lawyer of the
plaintiff writes down his charge on a lontar-leaf and throws it across
to the defendant?s ?kantja?, who makes use of the same means to
convey his reply. This interchange of notes continues as long as any-
thing remains to be written on either side and when they have done,
the sheets (or rather leaves) are gathered up and placed before the
judges in the order they were written; a decision will be given after
their perusal and a few moments? deliberation.
How enviable is such a short road to justice! But the question
remains, ?is it justice??
Although in former times the decision lay with the judges, that
custom has fallen into disuse now, and it is the princes who give a
final decision.
The codes ?also written on lontar-leaves?according to which judgment
is given are the ?pas? wara g?de? (the actual code of Bali) and the
?agama,? or old Hindu law-books. The contents of these are not founded
upon the adats (customs) of the Balinese people, but on the contrary
are very much at variance with them.
The Balinese are particularly attached to their own local customs
and are very much averse to having recourse to this supreme court;?


the priests themselves only partly understand the laws as they are written
and which are more often than not in contradiction to one another; ?
so that it is a well-known fact that unless the passions are very much
roused or there is a determined desire to settle matters at any cost, the
people never appeal to the decision of the ?kerta?. It is after all
only a leap in the dark, for no one can say how the prince may be
influenced, and the penalties are unusually severe, especially for the
lower classes.
Adultery, incest, high treason are punished by immediate death, either
by the kris, or being bound hand and foot and thrown into the sea.
Zollinger relates, that the father of one of the Rajahs of Mataram
was forced to put his own wife to death, although nothing could be
proved against her, excepting that she had made a young man a present
of some sirih leaves; but there the sending of this present might be
construed as a declaration of love!
The law is especially inexorable in cases of incest, which crime is
very prevalent among the Balinese. Zollinger tells us that the last king
of Karangassim was compelled to order five of his own children to be
drowned, charges of guilt having been brought against them.
No matter what accusation be brought against a Brahmin, the death
penalty is never passed on him.
Murders and thefts committed during the night are liable to very
severe penalties, which are however frequently remitted on payment of
an exorbitant fine; in cases where the accused cannot pay, he is krissed.
If a Brahmin murders a Sudra, he is ordered to pay a small fine;
or should he insult a man of inferior rank, the same penalty is inflicted,
whereas under identical circumstances the Sudra would be heavily
mulcted. Inability to do so means being krissed ?or sometimes a
lighter punishment is substituted and the accused has his tongue
cut out!
We think that these few illustrations will sufficiently indicate the
spirit of the law in Bali; we refer those of our readers, who wish to
obtain further details, to the article of Heer van Bloemen Waanders.
Matters are sometimes more serious still, that is when the priests are
not consulted at all and the prince, without any kind of formality
whatever, imposes a punishment, which is generally speaking much more
severe than anything contained in the code.
The old Rajah of Lombock must have been most arbitrary and
certain forms of death, such as crucifixion and dismemberment still
occur there, though seldom heard of in Bali now.
Later on we shall have occasion to refer to the boundless cruelty of
Anak Agung Made.
The distinction of caste is strongly emphasised by the language itself;
to begin with, the mode of address varies: a man of the highest caste
is always spoken to as ?Ida,? one of the second as ?Dewa? and one
of the third as ?Gnsti;? in speaking to women of these three castes,
these appellations are followed by the additional word or syllable


?Ayoe?. In speaking of the Sndras, the little word ?hi? is prefixed
to men?s names and ?ni? to women?s. If there are several sons, the
titles of ?Ida?, ?Dewa? or ?Gusti? are followed by ?Poetoe? or
?G?de?, for the eldest son, ?Made? for the second, ?Njoman? for the
third and ?K?toet?, for the fourth ?so that two titles always precede
the actual family name. The eldest son of a Sudra is called ?Wajau?,
the second ?Nengah?, etc. It frequently occurs that at the birth of
the first child the parents add his name to theirs with the additional
word Pan (father) or Men (mother).
Por Europeans it is at times most difficult, almost impossible, to
know a man?s caste; on such occasions it is always safe to address the
person as ?djero.?
Any one belonging to a lower caste invariably speaks to a person of
higher caste in high Balinese; a person of a higher caste addresses one
of a lower class in low Balinese. Exception of course is made for the
winces and their families, who, as we have said before frequently
Delong to the third class?they are always spoken to in high Balinese.
Strangers or foreigners are considered on a level with the Sndras and
are always addressed in low Balinese. This is not very flattering,
considering the slight esteem in which the Sndras are held by the
higher classes, who look upon them as people of no position whatever
and speak of them as ?pengen? ?which means ?beasts of burden.?
And in reality that is just what they are! Prom their birth they
bear the stamp of servitude; it is they who are the ?pengajahs? ?the
vassals or bondsmen.
One year after marriage every young man becomes a ?pengajah?,
and retains the privilege (!) until he is old and worn out, or has become
the father of married sons, or is left a widower without sons, ... or
has offered his wives as slaves to the prince!
Until such periods be reached he has to keep the princely residence
in repair, as also the small temples and the roads and bridges, and
furthermore he has to attend to the cock-fights; he must be ever ready
to act as body-guard or coolie and to accompany the prince and the
poenggawas on their journeys and even to war, if called upon to
do so, etc.
Not even death, the leveller, can bridge the impassable gulf existing
between the castes. Most unfavorable conditions are imposed upon the
Sndras as regards the inheritance of both land and money; in the
burial places each caste has its own allotted space; while cremation is
being performed a special sort of bier serves to notify that it is only
the body of a Sudra that is being burned; true, his soul must be
liberated, but still it is not intended that it shall return to the earth
in some superior rank as do the souls of the higher castes.
It is noteworthy that in Bali, where our influence has somewhat
smoothed the sharp angles of caste distinctions and where the numbers
of the higher castes are insignificant as compared with the entire popu-
lation, instances are to be found where influential Sndras have attained


important positions and have been created poenggawas or heads of
districts. Doctor Jacobs says that these are very exceptional cases, the
jrinces being averse to encouraging this sort of promotion, as the three
uglier castes owe no obedience to these Sudra-poenggawas.
In the island of Lombock such appointments are unknown.
Here we see the comparatively small proportion of conquerors main-
taining with rigid severity their superiority in all their dealings with
the people. Liefrinck remarks that the notables are frequently to be
seen standing in front of their dwellings with a spear in their hands or
going to work in the sawahs with krisses in their belts, so as to be at
all times prepared to defend their rights, should any one think of
assailing them.
Cremation is another institution of Hindu origin.
What was taught concerning immortality centuries and centuries before
our era by the great and wise Yajnawalkya in the Brahmanas and
?Upanishads?
?As a piece of salt dissolves in water in such a manner as to make it
impossible to take it out again and as the water becomes thoroughly
permeated with the salt wherever you taste it, so is it with the
?Atman?, the great being, a mass of knowledge drawn from the crea-
tures of the earth, to whom he again imparts it. That great being,
endless, boundless, penetrates, permeates everything as does the salt the
water. As long as they remain united, they constitute one whole,
although the mind may be able to distinguish them. Thus it is with
the soul and the body. At his birth man is endowed with conscious-
ness ; at his death consciousness leaves him; but it cannot therefore be
said that it is lost to him.?
The idea of Resurrection or Transmigration of Souls not only formed
the basis of the forementioned writings, but it also served in the foun-
dations of later Budhism and other Indian worships. The Atman, of
himself pure and spotless as the light of the sun, becomes sullied by
union with matter ?the body. Just as towards twilight the clear white
tints of day are tinged with the lovely yet treacherous red of night,
so is the primeval purity of the soul overshadowed by the allurements
of the senses, which lead to the commission of acts contradictory to its
real nature. Atman is pursued and overtaken by the calamities insepar-
able from sin. To escape these he must return once again to a state
of original purity, he must learn to know himself, and by this means
only can he be freed from the painful bonds of matter ?the body.
The highest goal of man therefore, is to strive for deliverance; until
this be obtained he continues a prisoner in the bonds of matter, from
which death itself is powerless to release him. For even when the
union between Atman and the body is dissolved, man is not spotless
enough to resume his original state. After a period of more or less
duration he is again united to some substance or other, of lower or higher
degree according to the manner in which his previous life has been spent.


He, who was once a human being may be born again in a higher-
rank, or he may, in punishment for his evil deeds, be born amongst
the lower species.
The countless numbers of dogs that wander about the Balinese
kampongs are looked upon as beings come back to earth to serve their
term of punishment, and therefore no one would think of molesting them.
The good deeds, which are to be performed by man during his
lifetime, are clearly indicated in the Indian philosophical treatises, the
Upanishads, which inculcate a very high standard of morality ?but of
course our space does not admit of our enlarging upon the subject.
We will only mention that it is taught therein that, although society is
a true school where all these virtues can be practised, still it is too
filled with distractions to allow of quiet thought and contemplative
philosophy. Thus in this religion we find that monastic life for both
men and women is very largely developed; the climate and the few
wants of these people adding very materially to the numbers. Naturally
it would have been impossible for the majority to have embraced this
life; it was declared possible for the three highest castes to achieve the
highest goal in society by knowledge.
The Sudras, who were excluded from the study of the sacred books,
were therefore denied the right to strive after deliverance in this world.
To obtain this privilege it wasi ncumbent upon them to die and be
born again to a higher caste; the Brahmins on the other hand were
exempt from any purifying process; the spirit once freed stood in no
need of resurrection.
How then was this separation of the body and the soul accomplished?
By cremation. As long as this remained undone the spirit was unable
to enter its new organism or higher state. The moral duty of cremation
rested upon all believing Hindus, who more than any other people are
deeply imbued with a spirit of reverence for their dead, a reverence
bordering on worship!
There is much to admire in this conception! The precept was a
simple one and might have been carried out with simplicity.
All idea of simplicity has been abandoned; cremation is a very costly
ceremonial, involving extravagant offerings and feastings, and exorbitant
tributes to the padandas, sometimes amounting to hundreds of florins....
it is self-evident that the simple inhabitant of the dessa is unable to
meet the expenses that would be incurred by these rites. Therefore the
function is postponed.... in course of time some of them unite and
share the expenses of the ceremonial, which is performed to show
honour to all the deceased relatives, of those who are able to contribute
towards the outlay.
Let us see what is done with the body during the interim between
death and cremation. It is washed and then wrapped in a kain
(cloth) and placed on a bier amidst the wailings of the family, who
bring their offerings; for a time he will require nourishment, as he is
not yet cut off from all earthly ties. On the day fixed for the funeral


the body sheltered by a big ?pajong? (umbrella) is taken to the burial
ground?seraa?amidst the chanting of members ?all sorts of religious
bodies ?and is laid in a grave about two feet deep and then covered
with earth.
At the head of the grave they place a bamboo cane, supporting a
little niche for food which is brought from time to time during the
beginning of the delay, caused by the reason we have just mentioned.
When the time has come that the family itself or the united members
of the dessa can defray the expenses of cremation, then, if the place
can be found, the body or what remains of it, is dug up ?sometimes
they have to content themselves with a handful of soil. If they cannot
find the spot where the body has been buried, well, then they simply
carve a wooden image, upon which the rites of cremation are performed!
Princes and those belonging to the higher castes, with whom money
is plentiful, are not subjected to a preliminary burial and their souls
are allowed to quit their bodies within a reasonable time of their
demise. Immediately after death the body is washed and perfumed,
tightly incased in matting, and covered with white and coloured kains,
sometimes very costly ones, and then it is laid between bamboo laths
and placed in a bale bandoeng, generally within the enclosure of the
homestead itself, but always on an eminence; after that it is weighted
down with some very heavy object, so that the moisture caused by
dissolution may the more easily escape. This moisture from the corpse
is carefully kept in vases placed under the bale and is very highly
valued. A man is appointed to keep watch * over the dead body and his
duties are to besprinkle the remains with toja-tirta about every five days
and to take precautions that none of the moisture from the corpse is lost, j*
By degrees, says Dr. Jacobs, the body begins to be mummified by
the continuous nauseous stench and the heavy weights ....
Finally, sometimes after months of waiting, for the preparations for
the ceremony are lengthy, the body is transferred to the bade or wadah,
where cremation takes place.
Before describing how this rite is carried out, we must draw attention
to the fact that not all persons are allowed to be cremated; and fore-
most amongst these are those who have been condemned to death by
the law. May we not therefore justly conclude from this fact that the
infamous Gusti Made, natural son of the old Rajah of Lombock, was
krissed by order of the prince himself? Under no other circumstances
would he have permitted the remains to be thrown into the sea, thus
preventing all chance of Gusti Made ever going to heaven, which was
only attainable by cremation.
* Where slavery has not been abolished this task is performed hy a slave, who is after-
wards granted his freedom.
f This custom is not prevalent among the Hindu-Balinese only. Dr. Jacob tells us that
the early Balinese, ?who neither buried their dead nor cremated them, hut placed them
outside the dessa ?were in the habit of washing the corpse and that the water used for this
purpose was afterwards used in cooking a large quantity of rice, to eat which, all the
members of the family and their friends were invited.


People who die of small-pox are not cremated and the number of
these is very great both in Bali and Lombock; the disease is very
prevalent * in the islands and it is thought that the measure was
decided upon for sanitary reasons, although much benefit could not be
derived from the alternative custom of placing the body in an open
grave or throwing it down a precipice. In Boeleleng and Djembrana,
districts under our immediate administration, the bodies are taken out
of the open graves after a few days, and after being properly washed
are buried for good.
In cases of leprosy cremation may not take place immediately, but
the bodies are buried and remain in the earth for certain defined
periods, varying according to caste ?thus a Brahmin must wait ten years
and a Sudra twenty-five years before being permitted to undergo the
purifying process. And as we said before a woman, who dies in state
of pregnancy, is denied cremation.
Let us now see how this rite of cremation is performed.
?The Kotta, says Dr. Jacobs, was gaily adorned in holiday garb,
Drocessions were advancing in every direction, here and there were
desks adorned with gold and silver tinsel and bright flowers and all
day long there were gamboeh and wajang performances, where the
djogeds and legongs displayed their musical and dancing talents. All
this however, was not in honour of the prince?s guests, but to celebrate
a grand cremation festival, which was to take place in three or four
days? time, on which occasion one of the prince?s brothers, who had
been dead two months and one of his concubines (selir) who had been
dead seven months, were to be cremated, both bodies being still above
ground ....
?In front of the house where the remains were deposited and which
was easily recognizable by the two big Chinese lanterns hanging outside,
a continual series of dancing performances was being executed, in which
two of the king?s sons were taking part.... this part of the town
(Jabanan, capital of the little kingdom of same name) was almost
impassable ....
?One of the processions is about to pass. First of all came eight men
armed with muskets, which they kept incessantly loading and discharging;
they we re followed by thirty more carrying long bamboo canes, fastened
to which were branches of dry palm leaves; behind these came a
gamelan-tjoemangkirang, consisting of gongs and kromongs, which were
beaten without interruption; after this band walked twenty men, carrying-
on the top of long bamboo canes sundry pieces of wearing apparel,
copies in miniature of the clothes worn by the deceased; some men
were carrying old chairs or other articles of furniture, I saw one with a
toilet-glass; next came a padanda-istri (a female priest) with a sancti-
monious-looking pinched-up face and heading a long line of women
carrying the insignia of the late prince, such as decorated krisses, and

smaller and smaller, and each one represents a small temple. The
number of ?toempangs? varies according to the caste of the deceased;
thus the one erected for Tabanan consisted of seven ?toempangs,?
whilst that of the concubine only had five; the Dewa-agong of Kalong-
kong has a right to eleven. The poor ill-used Sudra is not permitted to
have a single one. In the very top compartment of all there is a bed
of repose on which the body of the defunct is laid.
In case of the Sudras the bed of repose is covered over, to prevent
the holy rays of the sun shining on the unholy body of a person of
low degree. The priests are however exempt from this last injury;

lous. All the tiny doors and pillars of the ?toempangs? and every small
space that is available are covered with gold tinsel; here and there are
added little bannerets of coloured silk and hundreds of little square
looking-glasses in gilt frames give a very effective finishing touch to
the whole arrangement.
The day previous to the final rite is devoted by the priests to the
?washing? of the corpse, which betokens, that when the deceased
returns to the earth under a new form, he will have lovely eyes, well-
made ears, etc., and these ablutions are followed by a sort of absolution,
the priest declaring the defunct now free from all sin.
Amidst extraordinary tumult and uproar the corpse is conveyed from
its temporary resting place to the ready prepared ?wadah.? As soon as


the body is laid on the bed of repose, all those who have helped to
carry it up descend, only one remaining in charge, holding in his hand
an open pasong (umbrella) to signify that only one ray of sun shall
penetrate to the ?bale-balejan,? (this is the name of the bed of repose).
Whilst he tries to settle himself as best he may in his elevated position,
from fifty to a hundred men raise the structure on to their shoulders
and proceed slowly to the square in front of the prince?s residence or
the dessa chief?s, and walk round it in procession, so that the deceased,
whose soul is still present, may have an opportunity of once more bid-
ding farewell to his friends. This formality concluded, the procession
proceeds to the Serna, (crematorium) and the body is carried down and
placed in a kind of chest, * where for the last time the priest sprinkles
it with ?toja-tirta.? We, Europeans, who were present at this ceremony
tried to keep at a safe distance, but evidently the ?holy? man is pos-
sessed of olfactory organs different to ours, for nothing daunted, he
stooped over the remains and read the prescribed formula over N.N.
From time to time an assistant handed him a vase containing the toja-
tirta; this vase may only be used once for this purpose, after which it
is flung on the ground and smashed to bits.
?Meanwhile two men are waiting to hear the padanda pronounce the
last words, and then they immediately kindle the wood under the trough
and under the wadah; in a few moments a loud crackling announces
that the flames are spreading; this sound is the signal for the afflicted
members of the family and their guests to take their departure with
the utmost possible speed. A couple of live hens are tied to the top
of the wadah; they are to assist the departing sold in his flight to
heaven and no doubt every one would gladly witness this ascension, but
they are all afraid of the evil spirits, who crowd around the Serna to
disturb the sacred rites if they can. Only a couple of men stay behind
in order to scrape together the ashes of the deceased and place them in
a little heap; properly speaking it is their duty to keep watch over them,
but they are just as frightened as everybody else and they are grateful
to the law, which allows them to substitute an image in their stead. When
the kalas come in search of their victim they find that he has flown to
higher regions and no living person is visible on whom to vent their wrath!
It is only on the following morning that the family returns to secure
the ashes and wrap them up carefully, then with the accompaniment of
music and song they carry them solemnly to the shore; here a final
religious ceremony is gone through, after which the remains are handed
over to a couple of men, who row out to the open sea, where the
ashes are consigned to the deep; this last act constitutes the final sever-
ance from this earth, but from this watery grave the soul may eventually
return with impunity.
But this return may not take place forthwith. Even after the final
function, (makirim) several other religious ceremonies in commem-

oration of the dead are performed, and before the conclusion of all
these, the departed sonl may not revisit the earth. It does sometimes
happen that the deceased member of some family grows impatient and
returns too soon; but then this is always followed by the death of the
infant into whose body such a soul shall have entered. The instances
in which a Balinese will point out to you a child bearing a striking
resemblance to some member of the family dead and cremated years and
years before are just as numerous as the instances where the death of a new-
born child is ascribed to the impatience of some dead relative to return.?
We have given this description at length, because it throws such a
strong light on the religious belief, so strangely mixed with superstition,
that one finds among these people.
But what about those women in the sedan-chairs? had they really
been burned alive?
?Well, no !? that at least was the reply of the Rajah Tabanan. Since
the Government have signified to the Balinese princes their disapproval
of this hideous practice, it has been discontinued, at least publicly.
But who can say what is done privately and in Lombock, where onr
authority was so slight?
In order to evade the letter of the law, Dr. Jacob tells us that in
Bali, they have succeeded in circumventing it by a practice which is
certainly quite as barbarous; when the hour of sacrifice arrives the
victims kriss themselves .... this is not prohibited by the law .... and
surely .... they are permitted to cremate dead bodies ? Zollinger was
once present at a kris-feast or festival.... we call it feast for want of
a better name, and this is really what it always is ... . at least for the
spectators. From his account we extract the following :
?A deceased Gusti at Ampenan had left three wives. One of them
being childless desired to offer up her life in proof of the love she had
borne her husband. (We must remember our previous remark, that the
wife was always blamed if there were no children of the marriage.) She
considered that by this sacrifice she would be privileged to accompany
him on his long journey and be his favorite in another world. After
the corpse of the Gusti had been treated as described in the foregoing
sketch, the widow was carried on the outstretched arms of her women-
friends to the place of execution.
?Her only garment was a piece of wdiite linen; her head was crowned
with lovely chrysanthemums; she w r as perfectly calm and collected and
displayed neither fear nor regret. She stood in front of her husband?s
body, raised her arms on high and prayed in silence. Women ap-
proached her and offered her little bunches of red and white flowers;
she took them one by one and placed them between the fingers of the
hand raised above her head ?as she did this the women took them
away from her hand and dried them. Every time the widow accepted
the flowers and returned them she made a slight movement to the right
so that by the time she had had the eighth bouquet, she had turned
round completely. She prayed once more in silence, then approached
the dead body, kissed the head, the breast, the abdomen, the knees and


the feet and then resumed her place. Her rings were taken off. She
crossed her arms across her chest. Two women supported her and then
her brother (an adopted one) placed himself opposite to her and asked
her in gentle tones if she were determined to die and when she nodded
her head affirmatively, he asked her forgiveness for being obliged to
kill her?suddenly he grasped his kris and stabbed her in the left side,
but not very deep, so she still remained standing; thereupon he flung
away his kris and took to flight. Then a man in authority took his own
kris and plunged it up to the hilt into the breast of the unfortunate
woman, who fell to the ground without a murmur.
?Some women placed her on a mat and tried to make the blood flow
as quickly as possible by rolling the body about and squeezing it, but
as the victim was not yet quite dead one more kris was thrust into the
body between the shoulders. After this she was placed on a resting-
olace near her husband and the ceremonial that had been performed
;:or him, was now performed for her. When all was over the two
corpses were anointed with resin and cosmetics and wrapped in fine
linen and then laid in the ?bale bandoeng,? where they were left until
the time appointed for the cremation.?
The cost of cremation being considerably greater than that of ?kris-
sing,? it is only the widows of very wealthy men who can indulge in
that luxury. The wives of the priests are spared the trouble of choosing,
as they are exempt from both.
Concerning cremation we quote from Friederich, who was present at
the cremation of three widows at Giangar:
?A very high scaffolding was erected. Once again the three widows
went through endless ceremonials. Then they climbed the scaffolding.
They looked at one another to see if they were all ready to die. It was
not a look of fear, but a look of impatience to hurl themselves into the
flames beneath them. When the planks, saturated with oil, on which
they stood were pushed over the fire they executed three ?sembahs? ?a
movement with the hands above the head ?and as the doves placed on
their heads ascended on high with their souls, they, without a murmur,
cast themselves headlong into the flames below.
?The air resounds with music, shouts of joy go forth from every
throat, even cannons are fired off. .. . ! ?
But not always does unconsciousness follow immediately, not always
does death put an instantaneous end to their tortures.
Then the most gruesome sights are witnessed. ?It must frequently
occur,? says Dr. Jacobs on the authority of Clavel in his ?History of
Religions? ~that the women, at the sight of the funeral pyre, try to
draw back from their terrible fate; the final struggle must be terrible
beyond words when they are accompanied by their children on this last
journey; their shrieks of anguish pierce high above the jubilant shouts
of the crowd; they implore of their executioners, the priests, who are
with them, to let them live for the sake of their children, whom they
press to their hearts again and again and who in this last agony have


become doubly precious to them; they try to escape, but their plans are
frustated by the priests and the fanaticism of the multitude. ...?
We learned from the letter of the Sassak chiefs that the princes
incited the people to all kinds of gambling, dice-playing and cock-fight-
ing, etc.; that the heads of districts, where these pursuits were not the
order of the day, were punished, because the taxes levied on these
sports were not productive enough; that, in a word, all sorts of miseries,
such as poverty and theft, were the results of such measures and a more
intimate knowledge of the Balinese goes to prove that there cannot be
much doubt as to the veracity of the complaint. Their whole life,
exclusive of their sacrifices and offerings, is composed of feasting, dice-
playing and cock-fighting. As we have already given some details of
their ceremonials, we will only' set forth the following. It appears
that the festivals in honour of the Balinese gods last not less than 49
days. An entirely new town is built for the occasion and is after-
wards demolished. The population throngs thither from all directions.
The Rajahs, the Idas, and the Gustis all have dwellings there. Images,
in which the gods are supposed to come and take up their temporary
abodes, are manufactured in all sizes both in card-board and in wood
and on the last day of the festivities they are all carried in solemn pro-
cession to the shore and amidst the saluting of guns and the firing of
cannons they are cast into the sea. During these days nothing is done
except eating and drinking and dancing and watching the wajangs (Zol-
linger 1847).
Music and dancing and theatrical performances are very common, the
Balinese, even more than the other native tribes, being passionately fond
of music and singing. Night after night the ?gamelang ? is played in
the dessas and here they almost surpass those of Java. You may feel
sure, says Dr. Jacobs, that hundreds and hundreds sit round the
performers for hours, doing nothing but listen to the sweet sounds that
the skilful players know so well how to draw forth from their instruments.
The Balinese ?gamelangs? are divided into different categories according
to the occasions on which they are used and are composed of various
instruments: thus at Java the well-known ?gamelang gambang? is used
at burials and cremations, and also for festivals in the temples; then
there is the ?gamelang tjoemankirang,? composed of drums and cymbals,
played whilst walking in processions to wedding-parties or on solemn
entries to a town; the ?gamelang gong,? consisting chiefly of loud and
heavy-sounding instruments, is played as an accompaniment to national
or war dances, and lastly the ?semara pagoelingan,? the most perfect
gamelang of all and which requires about 25 performers, is used mostly
to accompany the ?ronggengs? and ?gandroengs.?
The most celebrated of these ?ronggengs ?dancing-girls?are the rong-
geng-gegoedens ?; they only dance on very solemn occasions and feast-
days, and no men are then allowed to participate in the dance. It is
only when it is a question of earning money that the ? djoged-tongkohan ?

appears; when the dance is finished the dancing-boy retires amongst the
spectators and is followed by the ronggeng, who goes round to collect
money .... as is done in more civilized places in ? cafe-chantants ? and
music-halls. The ?caresses? to which the singing or dancing-girl has to
submit ?resistance is forbidden ?are carried even to greater lengths than
in the European establishments.
But the performance of the ?gandroengs? or dancing-boys, is very
much worse; they are dressed like the girls, in costly sarongs drawn up
to under the arms, a broad band round the lower part of the body,
round the hips a ?salendang;? they glide about gracefully to the sounds
of the music, gesticulating with their arms.... the spectators eagerly
?A Gamboeli performance.?
crowd around them and offer them kepengs .... These representations
bear undeniable testimony to the very low standard of Balinese morality,
especially among the higher castes, who in this particular, are far ahead
of the others.
Any one wishing for further information on these subjects can refer
to the writings of Dr. Jacob and Heer van Bloemen Waanders.
Besides the ?ronggengs? there are other dancing-girls, the ?legongs,?
girls of about ten, who are kept exclusively for the princes and live in
the poeris and only dance before the princes or their guests of high
degree. The dress is the same as that of the ?gandroengs.?
And further the princes own a special class of girls, forming a large
source of income, but of these later. . , .


As far as the theatrical or ?gamboeh? performances are concerned,
they generally represent some episode of the Hindu period or some battle
scene and are mostly given in the Kawi language; the Balinese do not
understand that tongue, but the mimicry is so cleverly done, that it
leaves no doubt as to its meaning. There is always a ?semar? (clown)
whose sallies and wit, bear favorable comparison with his European
colleagues. Women often act, but sometimes the female parts are taken
by boys. According to the late oriental scholar, Dr. Neubronner van
der Tuuk, the ?gamboeh? is of Lombock origin.
Never is a day allowed to pass without the Balinese paying a visit
and making and offering to the god of gambling, Dewa Mosel. The
most common game is dice-playing, and the number of pips decides the
game. Various games at cards are well-known, especially those played
with Chinese cards. Apparently one game played with Dutch cards is
not unknown to the natives, viz. vingt-et-un!
How much has been achieved in the Archipelago in the way of civilization M!
It is the ?tetadjen? ?cock-fight ?which holds the foremost place in
the estimation of the Balinese. They love it above all things and prob-
ably there are no people in the world who indulge more assiduously
in this pastime than they do.
In addition to the cock-fights held by private individuals in the
dessas in their spare time?and the Balinese have plenty ? Heer van
Bloemen Waanders gives us the following official report.
First of all there is the ? saboengan-rajah,? the cock-fights which are
held once a year in the poeri?these last for two months, and as we
have remarked before their year is considerably shorter than ours. The
taxes connected with this event and the fines levied on the dice-playing,
which necessarily results from it, are collected for the benefit of the
prince and besides this, he has the right to claim two game-cocks from
every ?pengajah? (vassal).
Of course this ?saboengan-rajah? is looked forward to eagerly by
the thousands of spectators who come from all parts, and even the
padandas are present; it is reckoned that on an average fifty cocks are
made to fight every day, and out of these, about one half are killed
out right.
The next in importance is the ?saboengan poengawa.? These do not
take place at regular intervals, but vary according to the gambling
propensities of the chiefs. The permission to hold the cock-fights has
to be obtained from the prince, but is never extended for more than a
month. The proceeds of the cock-fight dues are on these occasions for
the ?poenggawas,? while, as a matter of course pengajahs are called
upon to provide either one or two birds each, with the option of a fine.
Van Bloemen Waanders calculated that at Boeleleng about four of
these feasts take place yearly.
And as nothing is more gratifying to the heart of the Balinese
princes and nobles than justice towards their inferiors, they do not
grudge them their official cock-fights, in addition to other pleasures.


Thus every year after the rice harvest there is the ? saboengan soebak,?
that is the cock-fights which are celebrated in the various soebaks -or
polder districts, comprising the members whose lands are irrigated from
the same source; these are a form of thanksgiving for the crops. These
only last five days and the dues collected are for the benefit of the
society, the ?seka soebak? (these may be compared with our polder
administration).
Finally there is the ? saboengan-dessa,? in the neighbourhood of the
dessa temples and these continue for a week. Every farmer has to
wo vide a couple of cocks for every temple of his dessa. It might be
(roped that in this case at any rate the people themselves might derive
some little benefit from the fines, but alas! it is not so! This time it
is the temples who enjoy the advantage and once more the inhabitants
of the dessas are the losers.
Van Bloemen Waanders alleges that through these compulsory cock-
fights about one-tenth part of the male population are taken away from
their work; this is at least the case at Boeleleng and there is no
reason to believe that matters are worse here than elsewhere. The evil
is further intensified by the burden of taxation and the incidental
expenses attendant upon these performances, not to speak of the perni-
cious moral results, these celebrations placing as it were a premium on
idleness and disorder and bringing all the evil passions into play; it is
not infrequent that at these periods a man gambles away not only
all his property, but even his wife and children. The ?saboeng rajah?
which is of such long duration and provides such exciting sport is
especially productive of these sad results. This is a busy time for
the ? Ajoeroe-soerat? (prince?s secretary) if he tries to arrange satis-
factorily (!) all the deeds of transfer that are submitted to him during
these two fatal months!
Regarding the actual festivity itself, we will only say, that the
arena consists of a plot seven metres square, marked off by bamboo
canes ?around this enclosure is a second one about one metre wide.
Pretty bamboo cages ??Goeoengans? ?in each one of which is a cock,
are placed all round the course. At a given moment two of the cages
are carried into the arena and this is the signal for a general uproar
and the betting starts immediately. Meanwhile the birds are ? let out
of the cages and a tiny double-edged spur is fastened to the left claw
of each cock; the beginning and end of the combat is notified by the
?Kemong;? sometimes however the fighting proclivities of the assailants
are too strong and they start before the official notice is given.
We again refer our readers to Dr. Jacob for further particulars
about this custom, which is so prejudicial to the welfare of the people.
Naturally, in order to propitiate the gods, a religious tone is lent to
these performances; the arena is always in close proximity to the temple
to which a share of the profits are given, sacrifices are offered before
and after the performances, and as a final expiatory sacrifice two speckled
birds fight till one or other is killed.


The Balinese are not only confirmed gamblers, but inveterate slaves
to opium, in Bali there is not one exception amongst the 1 * men, but
amongst the women the vice is more confined to those of the higher
castes, the dancing-girls and the inmates of the harem.
By nature diligent and active, the Balinese men degenerate- into'
habits of idleness and indolence through the abuse of this noxious drug,
which not only impairs their intellect but so weakens their whole
system, that they are ever ready victims to any epidemic that may
break out in the island.
Amongst the higher classes especially, where the indulgence of opium
and women is the greatest, the once clear mind becomes gradually
dull and brutish and finally, the last ray of lucidity that is left is
concentrated on one goal, the search for new excitement and fresh
sensual delights, which for a time shall banish indolence and conjure
up a glorious heaven. This paradise is peopled with godlike ?Bayaderes, ,r
who execute voluptuous dances, with lovely women clothed in beautiful
transparent attire, and dazzling angels of both sexes, who offer to their
parched lips that drink of the gods, that heavenly nectar, for which
their souls thirst ?
At these times the Balinese are prepared for anything and will fight
with the courage of a lion, and even perish gladly in the hopes of
being admitted to that glorious paradise.
The greater bulk of the population are so much under the influence
of the padandas, that even without opuim, it is easy to work them up
to such a state of fanaticism that they would willingly sacrifice their
lives to reach the heaven we have depicted.
It is when they are wrought up to this state of frenzy that those
desperate struggles, known as ?poepotans? take place: the chiefs attired
in white, and having broken off part of their spears so as to handle
them more effectually, rush on to the enemy with furious onslaught,
after having frequently killed wife and children beforehand.
In these cases no quarter is given or asked.
And woe to the chief who should take to flight or surrender...! He
would be eternally dishonoured and his authority would be lost for ever.
And as long as the chiefs display courage, the lower caste will not
hesitate, but will stand and fall to the last man. Even the women are
ready to follow in the footsteps of their husbands and do not shrink
from seeking death in the last desperate struggle!
We shall have occasion to see this fanaticism put to the test in our
account of the tragic struggle which terminated in the fall of the
reigning dynasty at Lombock.
Meanwhile let us form no exaggerated opinion of the courage and
warlike qualities of the Balinese under normal conditions. In the same
proportion as their physical powers of resistance have been stunted, so
lave the mental powers of the notables been weakened by gambling,
unrestrained passions and opium. This is evidenced by their mode of


carrying on their internecine struggles, when instead of fighting in
straightforward gallant fashion, they have recourse to plunder, rapine,
murder and arson.
How then, under these circumstances, account for the resolute oppo-
sition encountered in our previous Balinese expeditions?...
This was caused chiefly by our own mistakes.
In 1846, after the capture of Boeleleng and the capital of Singa
Rajah, the princely residence, the Balinese were so terrified that they
showed themselves ready to accept peace at any cost. Then, instead of
following up our victory, we contented ourselves with the little we had
achieved; politics undid what had been gained by splendid fighting,
and time was given to the Balinese to recover from their fright and to
fortify themselves both morally and physically... so that when we were
compelled once more to take up arms against them two years later,
two expeditions barely sufficed to restore what politics had spoiled.
And even then the Balinese fought principally from behind the lines,
the fortifications and the walls;* their main strength lay in treachery.
And did they not resort to the same measures in Lombock?
But we must give this kingdom its due; by the decrees of the Rajah
the misuse of opium is much less frequent, although not altogether
stamped out.
In other matters too, the old Rajah appears to have been a real
censor, a regular guardian of morals. He was inexorable in cases of
adultery, intercourse between the castes and the ravishing of young
girls?these crimes were all punished by immediate death. Games of
chance were prohibited and the stakes at the cock-fights were not
allowed to exceed a certain figure. Pederasty, which was so common
in Bali, was severely forbidden, therefore the ?gandroengs? were not
allowed to perform in Lombock. The ?gegoedens? were allowed, but
were exclusively for the prince?s benefit and men were not permitted
to visit the bazaar (market-place) in the morning. The prince?s repug-
nance for obscene productions was so great, that many of the frescoes
representing scenes from Balinese life, which had been selected for the
adornment of his country seat at Gunong-Sari, were subjected to severe
censure and many of the more offensive ones were erased by his orders,
as witnessed by Dr. Jacob on the occasion when he visited the palace.
What a careful father to his subjects!, ... But wait....
That same ruler, who rejoiced in the possession of a hundred wives
and all things else his heart could desire and who kept such strict
supervision over the morality of others, that ruler took no measures to
put a stop to the shocking and brutal immorality of his higher subjects
towards the lower Sassak population; and he did not even refrain from
sending his ?panjoerans??public women?far and wide through the
land, carrying licentiousness in their train....
* It is an undisputed fact that during* this expedition the Balinese kidnapped the wives
and children of the Bugis living on the coast and carried them off to the hills, forcing the
male Bugis population to place themselves at the head of the troops in order to secure the
ransom of their families.


To form a correct idea of this state of things, it is necessaiy to
understand the true position of the woman in Bah. Accoiding to the
Brahminical teaching they ought to occupy a high place.
?Wherever the woman is held in reverence, the gods are satisfied,?
says the book ?Manava sastra (the law-book of Mann),? ?where she is
not respected the most pious actions will remain fruitless. No family
will exist long where the wife is unhappy, but where her days are spent
in gladness, the family will increase and prosper. The houses which
have been accursed by women, to whom just honour has not been
shown, shall disappear from the face of the earth, as if by magic
In every home where the husband delights in his wife and where the
wife delights in her husband, there shall happiness reign supreme. If
a wife be not elegantly or neatly dressed, she awakens no joy in her
husband?s heart, and if he feels no pleasure, then the marriage will
remain childless.?
And is it not natural that women should be held in high esteem by
Budhism, with its attractive and gentle teachings, even purer and simpler
than those of Brahminism?
That religion, which holds that selfishness must be suppressed and
that justice is the greatest virtue, attainable only by charity and good-
will ; which teaches that ? good people must love everybody because they are
like unto themselves,? that ?all that one desires for one?s self, one must
desire for one?s neighbour,? that ?the more highly a person is cultivated,
the more he will wish to alleviate suffering in others? .... surely that
religion with its sad theories of life, full of sorrow and pity, will teach
its followers to hold their women in honour.
It is therefore not surprising to find that amongst the laws regulating
the conduct of life, there should be one regarding the conduct between
man and wife. It is written: The husband must love his wife: 1� he
must treat her with respect; 2� he must be affectionate; 8� he must
be faithful to her; 4� he must oblige others to respect her; 5� he must
provide her with the necessary clothing and ornaments. The wife must
show her love for her husband: 1� by keeping his house in order;
2� by being hospitable to his relatives and friends; 8� by being chaste;
4� by being a careful housekeeper; 5� by performing all her duties
with skill and industry. In another part of Mann?s lawbook, we find
that man and wife are enjoined ?to be guilty of no transgression towards
each other as long as they live;? and the wives are spoken of as ?the
light of the homes, the goddesses of joy.?
This is their moral philosophy! But let us see what is the actual
position of the Balinese woman of to-day!
Heer van Bloemen Waanders says that the Balinese law only recog-
nizes as lawful one kind of marriage; the ?mepadik.?
The young man who has become enamoured of a girl asks his father?s
consent to marry her and if the father approves of his son?s choice, he
goes to the girl?s father and asks him if he is willing to give his
daughter in marrige to his son, If both fathers agree, then free inter-


course is allowed between the betrothed and the padanda appoints the
wedding-day, when all the relatives and friends assemble and spend the
day in eating and drinking and talking to the merry sounds of the
gamelang. In the evening the girl is carried in triumph in a sedan-
chair to the home of her prospective husband and he follows her on
horseback. Once the door of their allotted apartment is locked, the
marriage is considered as completed.
A few days later the newly-married pair carry a few offerings to the
padanda and beg of him to bestow the blessing of heaven upon their
marriage.
But however simple this sort of marriage may appear, it is often
found too tiresome and complicated for the impatient and passionate
Balinese. He has found a shorter and quicker way of possessing the
woman whom he may desire, with or without her consent or that of
her parents. This extraordinary mode of proceeding must have been
approved of by the lords of creation, for, from first being only a
custom it has by force of habit become law.
The two most common methods of marriage are the ?merangkat,?
in which the woman gives herself up to her lover with her own
consent, and the ? melegandang ? when she is seduced against her will.
The prince of Lombock has however put an end to this latter
practice, as we mentioned before.
In case of the former, the matter is arranged between the young
people themselves ; they make all the necessary plans and at a certain
date the young man elopes with the girl and takes her generally speaking
to the house of a friend, where she remains in hiding until the anger
of her relatives is appeased and after paying the fine of two ?Boengkoes?
(50 florins) ?which is the sum stipulated for this offence ?the marriage
is valid and the matter is at an end.
We must admit that it would be difficult to suggest a more simple
way of getting joined in wedlock.
The ?melegandang? is somewhat more complicated. The woman
might offer resistance, or she might possibly be already married to some
one else, or she might be betrothed, and some slight consideration is
due to this third party.
The lover settles the matter with a few intimates.... scoundrels.
They lie in ambush on the road where the woman passes to go to her
work, or to the river to bathe, or wherever it may be. The woman is
seized, her mouth is gagged and she is carried off to some house in
the dessa, where a safe asylum is given, even should the people of the
house be unacquainted with the parties concerned ?simply because it is
the custom of the country. Once inside the house the seducer is safe;
on payment of seven boengkoes (175 florins) he may even retain sole
possession of the woman; the only precaution that he has to take is,
to remain concealed until the fine is paid, otherwise the anger of the
husband or other relative might cost him his life.
If, after he has had the woman in his keeping for a few days, he


considers that the fine is too high or if he does not fancy hei any
more, he can, on payment of a smaller tax, send the poor creature back
to her husband or her family!
But this is not all!
- When it is question of a young girl, not yet marriageable, the fane
is fixed at 4 ?boengkoes;? (100 florins) the caste of the seducer is
always considered, and the higher the caste, the lowei the penalty!
It is easy to imagine that these practices must lead to endless
immorality; we will only relate one instance from the diary of Van
Bloemen Waanders, which will corroborate what we have already said
about the free intercourse allowed between the young people of opposite
sexes. The story refers to children, who had not yet attained their
maturity, and could not therefore be really properly married.
?Ida K?toet Anom told me to-day that his eldest son, Ida Bagoes
Mantra, a little fellow of about fourteen, had seduced his cousin
Ida Ajoe Poetoe, of about his own age and daughter of the padanda
Made Gunong and that he had eloped with her to Bandjar Djawa.
?When I remarked that I was rather astonished that a child like
Ida Bagoes Mantra had dared to do such a thing, he looked rather
ashamed and told me the truth about the matter.
?This is the gist of his story.
?Prom their very babyhood almost the children had shown signs of
mutual affection and it had therefore been decided by the parents that
they should be allowed to marry and as they dwelt within the same
homestead, familiar companionship was permitted and Ida Bagoes Mantra
had been enjoined to sleep at night in Ida Ajoe Poetoe s room, in order
to protect her in all emergencies.
?Things went on perfectly well for years and the children had lived
together in close though innocent intercourse ?for most strict orders
were given to the boy to treat his cousin honourably; six days ago the
boy?s mother was warned that a Brahmin of Bandjar intended kidnapping
the girl in order to marry her ?of course against her will.
?As a result of this information a family council was held and it was
decided that the young people should elope, secretly as it were, and
that by degrees the news should be made public and that in future Ida
Ajoe Poetoe would be protected from all assault. The children them-
selves were disinclined to play their parts in this comedy, but they
were forced to do so.
?A good friend at Bandjar Djawa was let into the secret and agreed
to give them shelter in his house for a few days.,
?All these preliminaries being settled, they went last night to Bandjar
Djawa, accompanied by the mother, sisters and others and the two
children were locked up together in a small room and the marriage
was accomplished.
?This morning Ida K?toet Anom went to see them.
?The boy wanted to return home at any price, as he was afraid that
his doves and other birds would be neglected and die of hunger in his


absence. His father told him to put all such nonsense out of his head,
that he was now a married man, but that in six or seven days when
the news had got well bruited abroad, he should return home with his
young wife.
?It is most lamentable?very justly remarks van Bloemen Waanders,
that parents should be compelled to resort to such measures to prevent
their plans being thwarted with impunity by a third party, for the
adat ?custom ?ordains that the young girl shall remain with her
seducer,? etc.
This then is the way in which women are protected by the laws of
their country!
The man who pays the purchase money, the fine, is her lawful owner;
he can do what he likes with her; he can raise a mortgage on her or
sell her; he can use her as a stake at the cock-fights or at a game of
chance, just as he would a cow or a pig. The woman is, with few
exceptions, therefore not an individual, but a thing, a means wherewith
to satisfy one?s wants.
Can the wife leave her husband in cases of too gross brutality P
Yes ?in certain cases the law permits it. But then, either she is placed
at the disposal of the prince and her second condition is worse than
her first ?or else she has to refund to her husband twice the price he
paid for her; in both cases the father is allowed by the law to keep
the children. What a heavy score there is to be settled by some one
for the framing of such laws!
It must not for a single moment be thought that the Balinese mother,
who loves her children very dearly ?whatever her faults may be, want
of love for her offspring cannot be laid at her door ?will resign herself
to leave them, even if she is able to pay the penalty prescribed, ?.No!
poor creatures, they prefer submitting in silence to any humiliation.
She even goes so far as to share her home with as many ?sisters? as
her husband shall choose to bring there; she works from morning to
night, so that when her husband has squandered all his money in
gambling and opium, she may have her little savings to give him, that
there may be peace and order in the house and that she and her
children may be spared disgrace.
This is the real every-day life of the Balinese wife!
What then is the cause of this stupendous difference between practice
and theory?
In a great measure it is owing undoubtedly to the unfortunate com-
bination of Hindu religion and Polynesian paganism.
But then again, the Hindu religion in itself is not free from blame.
With all its magnificent ideas, its teaching is too formal, too pedantic;
it is too pessimistic in its contempt for things transient, for all things
that exist and that it looks upon as purely imaginary; it is too philo-
sophical in its highest ?dreams,? called indifferentism, in its ulterior
goal: liberation of the soul from earthly regeneration. Sight was lost


of the real needs of men?s lives, which do not consist in meditations
and no account was taken of the actualities of life, which is a continuous
struggle from beginning to end. .
And in spite of all the tolerance and liberalism contained in the
teachings of Buddha, they are not free from partiality; and notwith-
standing all the laws about honouring women, there is a maliciousness
expressed towards them (between the lines), which throws a maivellous
light, so as Dr. Kern says, on what the earthly saints ?the padandas?
understood by ? love and good-will. And did the great founder of this
doctrine, Buclha the Sage, the Enlightened?the Budha of the legend,
be it understood ?did he always show love and respect to women?
It is true that he had some sad experiences with them, but it is no
small wonder that the Balinese should have overstepped the bounds,
when even among the early leaders there was such a wide discrepancy
between theory and practice.
Let us see how the law' further treats the women in Bali.
If a Sudra dies without a son or an adopted son old enough to
replace him in his vassal duties, then the brother enters into possession
of all he has left behind, including wife and children. In default of a
brother everything becomes the property of the prince. This course is
also pursued in cases of punishment for certain crimes; for instance if
a man is outlawed; and as the prince is frequently called upon to
deliver sentence, we may feel sure that he is not over-scrupulous about
passing a judgment from which he derives so much advantage. The
real estate is generally converted into hard cash, which finds its way to
the prince?s purse; the women of the household who are too old or too
young are sent to the poeris to do the various domestic duties, thus
working for the prince, whose property they have become; the good-
looking women are selected for the prince?s harem, whilst all the others,
oftentimes including young girls not yet arrived at the age of puberty,
are sent out as ? panjoerans ? to all quarters of the land and thus aid
to swell the prince?s revenue. These miserable creatures are compelled
to send a percentage of their earnings to the prince, commensurate
with their beauty and the density of the population whose territory
they infest.
Is it not clear why the old Rajah of Lombock, whilst forming pro-
hibitory laws which did not affect himself, upheld this most serious of
all immoral institutions?
But this is not yet all.
?Furthermore we wish to add that if a Mohammedan dies here
without male issue, the female relatives, as well as his real and personal
estates are taken by the princes. The girls never turn out well, they
all become prostitutes.? However scandalous this may appear, it was
?adat? as far as the Sudras were concerned; but:
?If the deceased leave brothers, they get nothing either, and later
on, when Balinese from Karangassim are banished here, they are given
the lands,? etc. (both quotations are from the letter at the beginning of


the book). Now that was not ?adat,? so that the lot of the Sassaks
was worse even than that of the Sudras.
Now that we have seen what is the position occupied by the Balinese
women, we can the more easily understand the meaning and the justice
of the further complaint of the Sassak chiefs, which are mentioned in
the same letter: that the Balinese chiefs take the girls away by force,
especially those of good families; some they keep for themselves, while
the others are cast adrift; they do not content themselves with full-grown
girls, but often insist upon taking tiny children only seven years old!
? Then it sometimes happened that the parents went out of their
minds, but what was to be done P ?
And did not the old Rajah himself set the example, when against the
will of the Raden of Kali Djaga, he took his daughter, Ma Radja,?we
shall have occasion to speak of this interesting woman later on ?and
had her poor resisting father put to death?
That then was the legal position of the Sassak people: absolute
uncertainty as to land and property, wife and children, entirely at the
mercy of the ruling race!
In no country in the world, not even in the country whence we
borrow the device: ?my house is my castle,? is the realization of the
idea contained therein, so strongly rooted as with ?the Balinese. Bor
him, his ?homestead,? enclosed within high walls, is really and truly his
castle, his world. His world, holding all that he stands in immediate
need of, be it temporal or spiritual; his world, in which he dwells with
his family and all the members of his family, where he is safe against
all intrusion.
The law however imposes upon him the duty of protecting his own
homestead and at the same time confers upon him the right to stab
without ceremony any nocturnal visitor, unable to give a speedy and
satisfactory account of himself. Jealous and passionate by nature he
does not allow his wife to speak to or receive any man during his
absence from the homestead. Should a strange man enter his sleeping
apartment uninvited he has a right to kill him. Outside the walls of
his home, most things leave him cold and indifferent. Surly and proud,
he seldom enters into conversation with his neighbour; as a rule, dis-
sension exists between the different inhabitants of the same dessa; and
nowhere does one come across the sociability and familiarity to be met
with in the Javanese kampongs.
Only when self-interest is at stake ?for in spite of their manifold
offerings to the deities, the Balinese, that is to say the men, are great
egotists?do they join dessa-unions and soebaks (polder-unions) for the
benefit of their material welfare and club together to erect the dessa-
ternples for their spiritual good.
The submissiveness of the Javanese is not one of their characteristics;
they are always ready to assert their rights if they fancy these have
been in any way violated. They are not the least bit quarrelsome;
indeed they recoil from abuse or insult, which is looked upon ?as so


serious an offence, that the law permits of its being wiped out by blood.
The Balinese man never forgets an injury. He is not inclined to theft,
as so many of our native tribes are. Is this the result of then bettei
nature, or as Dr. Jacob alleges, of the stringent laws against stealing?
It appears to us that a people innately proud is less likely to be
addicted to this vice; however we have already noticed that the use of
opium and gambling have had more or less demoralizing effects and in
Balinese Kampong facing the ? bazaar ? at Ampenan.
their train have followed poverty and misery, accompanied by theft and
highway robbery. One invaluable feature of the Balinese character is
their inherent capability for higher development and as we are called
upon to assume such great responsability towards millions of our native
subjects, we feel compelled to enlarge somewhat upon this point.
We have already alluded to their artistic genius in building the
temples. One of the finest specimens is certainly the temple of Kasim an
in Bali, a large quadrangle surrounded by high walls, richly sculptured,
entrance to which is obtained through a magnificent pyramid shaped


gate, guarded ou each side by two huge Raksasas. Within the square,
the transparent waters of a narrow little stream wind their way through
the picturesque banks, shaded on either side by magnificent Waringin-
trees and ornamented with handsome porcelain vases, holding lovely
water plants. The stream is crossed by little bridges, leading to an
open space, where numberless small temples ?the before mentioned
?meroes? ?immediately attract attention. In the stone walls of these little
buildings as well as in those encircling the enclosure are thousands of
variegated earthenware plates and saucers of all sizes, with the concave
side facing one.
Many Hindu images and handsome niches adorn the whole, which is
supposed to be a copy of the famous Hindu temple of Madjapahit.
Concerning the princely palaces, the poeris, they are very inferior to
the temples from an architectural point of view. Just as all the
Balinese homesteads are walled in, so are the princes? residences; the
walls of the poeris are generally embellished by carvings, representing
allegorical subjects from the Hindu religion.
As a rule, in front of most of the poeris
there is a large covered-in space where the
cockfights are held in rainy weather ?as it
would be impossible to forego this excitement
during any lengthy period. Within the walls,
there is a second space dedicated to the
same pastime, but this is not weatherproof.
On each side of the main entrance there
are large and small ?pendoppos,,? one or
more of which are used as receptacles for the
cages containing the game-cocks. Further
on, facing one, and on both sides are numbers
of high narrow double gates, leading up to
which arc a few stone steps. The side
doors give access to the private apartments
of the prince and his household. The centre
gates lead to a second large open space,
Guardian of the Temple.
containing more ?pendoppos,? serving as dining-rooms, sitting-rooms and
reception-rooms for visitors. Sundry small and large doors lead off from
tins floor to tlie kitchens, the stables and the dwellings of the panjoerans;
a general air of uncleanliness pervades the whole place.
The artistic taste of the Balinese has decidedly been shown to greater advan-
tage in the magnificent country seats of the Lombock princes?but of that later.
Their skill in reading and writing is another proof of the natural talent of
the Balinese. ?It is marvellous,? says Van Bloemen Waanders, ,?thatina
country where public schools are conspicuous by their absence and where
teachers and teaching are never heard of, the knowledge df reading and
writing should have attained such an extraordinary Development.?
And it is not only amongst the men that these accomplishments are
so wide-spread; the women, especially those of the higher classes, are

quite as proficient as their lords and masters. As boys and girls,
playing together, they teach one another the alphabet and the fathers,
but chiefly the mothers, give them further assistance and teach them
how to write ou the lontar leaves.
?How to write on lontar (palm) leaves?! it is a thing one has
frequently heard of and a good deal more will be heard of it, so it is
not inappropriate to say a few words on the subject.
The leaf comes from the lontar palm. After leaving it to soak
in water for about a fortnight, it is dried. The leaf is then folded
in two and is written upon on both sides by a sharp pointed knife, that
is to say the characters are scratched on to the leaf and in order to
make the writing more distinct, it is sprinkled over with the dust
obtained from the ?kemiri? fruit, which is burnt and reduced to powder.
Dr. Jacobs informs us that leaves thus treated are never eaten by
insects and will last hundreds of years. Trie derich maintains on the
other hand that Indian manuscripts can never be much more than one
hundred years old and that this fact is proved by the greater part of
the ancient literature of Java being lost.
In Bali therefore one cannot expect to find many very old manu-
scripts, but the priests there have learned how to copy them so accu-
rately, that their copies may be said to be quite as valuable as the originals.
The Balinese books consist of lontar leaves held together by a piece of
twine run through a hole in each leaf and then fastened to two little
pieces of wood on the outer sides to keep the whole firmly together.
But we were dealing with the capabilities of the Balinese for higher
development.
Most of the three higher castes, as well as the well-to-do Sudras, are
acquainted with the Kawi literature; the ? Wajang? performances have
not a little to do with this and at their social gatherings, there are
frequent readings and songs from the fascinating Kawi legends. Van
Bloemen Waanders even goes so far as to say, that it is his opinion
that the famous ?Thousand and One nights? had their source in Bali.
That they are not of Arabian origin, but a translation from an Indian
work, has been conclusively proved, by the researches made by Professor
A. W. von Schlegel; and the ?Tantri-Kamendaka?, which is written in
pure Kawi, teems with moral fables which remind* one at every turn
of the stories out of the ?Thousand and one nights?; and it is worth
* Here we also have the account of a prince Praboe Sri dara Patra, who at the height
of his power and surrounded by grandeur, still failed to find any gratification excepting in
women and every day he insisted upon having a fresh young and beautiful girl brought to
him. To save her father Patih Bande B?warya, who had incurred the prince?s anger by
being unable after some years to find him any fresh victims, Dijah Tantri, his lovely
daughter, offered to go and share the prince?s bed herself.
When he began to overwhelm her with caresses, she was clever enough to free herself
from his embraces and coaxed him into listening to a short tale. She succeeded in so
fascinating him that he could think of nothing else and at last he fell asleep out of sheer
weariness. Thus it was the next night, when the prince conceded to her the privilege to
continue her story, and so it was a third, and fourth, etc., till at last all her charming tales
(which are contained in the manuscript), her beauty and her cleverness made her so indis-
pensable to the prince that he was quite cured of any desire ever to see any one else.


noticing that just at that period numbers of Arabian missionaries were
making constant voyages to the Indian Archipelago. Whatever be the
truth, there is no doubt that the Balinese literature is richly provided
with works (principally written in Kawi) of great value on matters his-
torical, philosophical, judicial, religious, poetical and humorous; many
instances of this have been given us by Friederich and Van Bloemen
Waanders and it is more than probable that important specimens will
be found amongst the writings left by Dr. van der Tuuk. We do not
think that Lombock will be found much behind Bali in this respect.
The more we learn about these remarkable people, the more we are
inclined to regret with Van Bloemen Waander ?that a nation displaying
such natural aptitude for increased civilization and higher culture of
mind, should see itself condemned by mistaken political ideas and by
desperate attachment to ancient customs, to remain for ever stationary
at the point reached three or four centuries ago,? also that, ?the
desire for knowledge is too frequently kept in check by the ridiculous
notion or rather pretext of the padandas, that those not initiated into
mysteries of the priesthood, should not strive after too much erudition,
as it might cause confusion of mind and be productive of other evils.?
The Balinese have been hemmed in on the one side by maladminis-
tration and on the other by a narrow-minded religion, and for centuries
these combined forces have arrested all mental progress.
Can anything be altered in their religion?
Intolerance toward other people?s way of thinking?says Liefrinck?is
unknown amongst the Balinese, as they are usually much too engrossed
in their own business, to think much about other people?s. They seldom
try to make converts; for it is in keeping with their character to be
totally indifferent as to what gods their neighbours worship. However,
from political reasons, the rulers have left no stone unturned to induce
the Sassaks to embrace Hinduism.
The neophytes were granted all sorts of privileges: exemption from
vassalage and certain taxes and from having to serve as soldiers out of
their own country; they were thus placed on an equality with the
Balinese. If a Sassak woman married a Balinese, she was obliged to
follow her husband?s creed and their children were brought up as
Hindus. For a time, after the great rising of 1855, the Sassaks were
even forbidden to assemble for prayer in their temples.
With the exception of a short period of time?when the before-
mentioned Ma Radja, wife of the Rajah, exercised such a strong
influence over him ?everything was done to prevent pilgrimages to Mecca
and the number of hadjis and mosques became fewer and fewer, etc.
All attempts that have been made to convert the Balinese either to
Christianism and Islamism have been attended with very small results.
Certainly, there are here and there instances of conversious to Islamism,
but these are only few and far between. .
As regards conversion to Christianity, the unfortunate results of the
labours of the Protestant missionaries in Bali are well-known: and the


111^^
j I -V. l-� - .: ? - '? '?
unceasing efforts made by van der Jagt, van Eck, de Vroom and
Wiggelendam are undeniable.
Catholicism would naturally appeal more deeply to the Balinese, who
feel the want of outward ceremonial and symbols. But would a life
of continence, not to say of suffering and serving, after the ideal of the
great Master, suit the proud passionate Balinese? Would he willingly
surrender all the earthly joys, which his position as a member of the
?Various types of Sassaks.
higher caste entitle him to, or the number of women to whom he is
so passionately devoted, or his titles of Ida, Dewa, Gusti, of which
he is so tenacious?? Would he give up all these tangible possessions to
obtain a reward later in a heaven ?which to him, is so far distant?
Well, it is barely possible that amongst the Sudras, the very poor
ones for whom all these earthly advantages do not exist, a few might
embrace Catholicism.... perhaps.
But at all events the proud task of our government is to look after
the material and intellectual welfare of this strong and gifted people


.epui'-sc. ? > ''*??^ ?-' '"? j
and the first step to be taken is, to put an end to the tyrannical
government whose rule for centuries has been one of incessant oppression
and extortion. The only possible way of achieving this object is the
introduction of our direct control.
Before dilating at greater length upon the Balinese, we must dwell
for a little while upon the Sassaks. We cannot discuss their religious
and social institutions in the same manner as we did those of the
?House in a Sassak Kampong.?
Balinese; to do so would be to overstep the limits of our work. We
will only point out one or two peculiarities in which they differ from
the inhabitants of the neighbouring island.
The dress of the Sassak men is not unlike that of the Balinese ?they
generally wear a piece of white ?kain? (linen) on their heads and their
ears are not pierced. Their krisses are much longer and the hilts are
dissimilar, those of the Sassaks being made to remind the Avearer of the
circumcision, as the Balinese always contemptuously remark. The women
are more covered and Avear dark blue or black ?badjoes? fastening at

the neck, but without sleeves; true the material is rather transparent. ?
Some of their dessas are built after the Balinese, some after the- ?
Javanese fashion. The latter are built of bamboo on the ground and;
the former are built ou a sort of support or foundation of clay about
one metre high ? the walls are usually of clay and are two metres high;
the roof is always of paddy straw. The house generally consists of a
large inner room and an open terrace; alongside the house or close to :
it are separate buildings for the kitchens, rice stores, etc. If . the home-
stead is not enclosed by a wall, it is surrounded by pagars (palissading)
as in Java. Viewed from the sawahs, the kampongs present exactly the
? Sassak fishermen on the beach a Ampenan.?
same appearance as those of Java; for where they are surrounded by
walls, the dark clay is only visible at intervals through the dark green
foliage ?for the whole kampong is hidden behind masses of cocoa-nut
trees and bamboos, and penangs and pisangs, all in the full splendour
of their tropical perfection.
If anything, the Sassak is less licentious than the Balinese; the
religious aversion for all the Balinese domestic animals, dogs and pigs,
forms one source less of immorality.
As a rule the Sassak is long-suffering and docile and herein lies his
resemblance to the Javanese; as we have learnt by his history he has
endured all sorts of tortures, extortions and ill-usage before rebelling.
He is industrious and energetic when working for himself and this is

fully proved at harvest time, when thousands of pikols of rice are being
carried to the coast by daybreak. He is anything but quarrelsome by
nature and would ask for nothing better than to be allowed to cultivate
his land in peace. That, while serving under us in warfare, he displayed 1
less favorable characteristics, such as love of plunder and lack of zeal,
does not disprove the previous statement. Is it to be wondered at,
that, after so many years of oppression, he should end by giving himself
up to unbounded licentiousness ? The absolute unsafety of life and
property had deadened all his energy and strength and the hardships
and ravages of a pro-
tracted war were enough
in themselves to demor-
alize jhim entirely; but
with patience and tact
and a more beneficent
rule, he will undoubtedly
be once more converted
into a peace-loving and
industrious husbandman!
The Sassak, like the
Balinese, loves fishing,
whereto the waters of
Lombock afford him
ample opportunity. Like
the Javanese he uses
nets ?drag nets and
hoop nets ?seros and
fishing-rods; as he is
just as little of a hero
at sea as the Balinese,
he confines himself chiefly
to the coast.
Their industries are
very insignificant and are
limited to the weaving

articles of dress, plaiting palm-leaves and bamboo canes into baskets
and to the making of weapons. Gold- and silversmiths are much less
numerous than in Bali and the cause is not far to seek; and they are
much behind the Balinese in taste and in the art of decorating, for
in a country where poverty is the order of the day, articles of luxury
are not much in demand.
The language of the Sassaks is totally different from that spoken by
the Balinese; although the Sassaks have borrowed many words from
their neighbours, still they are unable to understand each other?s
language. Some few Sassaks, and nearly all the chiefs, understand
Balinese and speak it. Malay is spoken amongst strangers. The Sassaks

have many words used in Malay and Javanese; but on the whole, the
language is more like that spoken in Bima and Sumbawa. High and
low languages such as exist in Balinese are unknown; there are a few
expressions of respect and submission to be used by an inferior in
speaking to a superior.... and these must have been very largely used!
There are no distinctive characters for writing and the few chiefs
who have acquired this accomplishment make use of those employed by
the Balinese or Javanese. Sassak literature is singularly poor and there
are no original works at all; they have a few works written on lontar
leaves in the Bali-djawa-language, which are chiefly historical or romantic
and are translated from Malay or Arabic; the Ringanis are the best known.
Their system of administering justice is the same as in Bali, allowing
for the difference of religion and the social disparities ensuing there-
? Ploughing the Sawahs.?
from and stipulations for which have been made in the so-called ?pas?-
Avara Sassak.?
What cannot fail to awaken our greatest interest next to the peculiar
religion of the Balinese, is the highly developed system of their agri-
culture, which surpasses that of all our other islands in the archipelago.
?It was here?so says Wallace ?that I first obtained an adequate
idea of one of the most wonderful systems of cultivation in the world,
equalling all that is related of Chinese industry, and as far as I know
surpassing in the labour that has been bestowed upon it any tract of
equal extent in the most civilized countries of Europe. I rode through
this garden utterly amazed, and hardly able to realize the fact, that in
this remote and little known island, from which all Europeans except a
few traders at the port are jealously excluded, many hundreds of square

miles of irregularly inundated country have been so skilfully terraced
and levelled, and so permeated by artificial channels, that every portion
of it can be irrigated and dried at pleasure. According as the slope
of the ground is more or less rapid, each terraced plot consists in some
places of many acres, in others of a few square yards. We saw them
in every state of cultivation; some in stubble, some being ploughed, some
with rice-crops in various stages of growth. Here were luxuriant patches
of tobacco; there, cucumbers, sweet potatoes, yams, beans or Indian
corn varied the scene, etc.?
?Working the sawahs.?
It was very probably the Hindu colonists, who introduced the wet
rice culture here as well as in Java. But when? Some think it may
date back to a more remote period before our Christian era, when com-
mercial relations are said to have existed between the land of the
Ganges and Bali.
The Soebak (polder-districts)* statutes, by their very language, point to
very great antiquity and presumably their proficiency in agriculture dates
further back still. The necessary re-writing of the lontar-leaves ?about
every 50 or 100 years ?on which these regulations are found, makes it
impossible to specify the exact date, for the Balinese have been in the

bad habit of only writing down the year in which they were transcribed
and not the date of- the original manuscript. ' . .
The first reliable information regarding wet rice culture is received
from Cornelius Houtman, who touched the South coast of Bali in 1597
and who stated that the insufficiency of the supply in that island had
to be made up by Lombock.
Rice culture has always been of the greatest importance for Lombock,
where it is the staple article of commerce, the source of all wealth.
Not only does the island yield enormous quantities, but the quality of
the rice is far superior to that op Bali and can be kept for years and
years without spoiling, as was proved after the eruption of the Tambora,
when for seven years the soil was unable to produce fresh crops. Large
cargoes are exported to the neighbouring islands of the archipelago and
also to more distant ones, such as the islands of Mauritius and Bourbon;
some is even sent to Australia, Europe and China.
Men, and sometimes women, carry on an extensive trade in rice in
the interior; they go from kampong to kampong to buy and their stock
is carried on horse-back?carts are unknown in Lombock and Bali?to
the coast for sale.
The prince grants trading concessions. At the time of Zollinger?s visit,
he was entirelly in the hands of a merchant called ?King? and a Chinese.
The prince himself fixed the prices for buying and selling and he always
took half the profits of the year?s trade, which gave him a yearly income of
about 150.000 florins. Besides this tax and the import and export duties
and the presents given by the merchants to obtain the prince?s good
will, the prince derived still further advantages from this produce.
According to Zollinger there was a yearly tax, of 6 to 7 florins on
every tenah, * and this was paid to the Rajah of Lombock in gold, (not
in kind) to which the people gave the preference. This tax is not levied
in proportion to the number of inhabitants in every dessa, but according
to the number of tenahs in every dessa.
The inhabitants themselves make the computation amongst the owners
of the various lots of the sawahs.
In Lombock it is only the Sassaks who pay this tax, but let us see
what it amounts to according to a very moderate calculation. Admitting
that one-eighth part of the sawahs belong to the Balinese, that one-fifth
of those owned by Sassaks are exempt from taxation (during their term
of vassalage they pay no taxes), and that the total yield of the rice
culture amounts to 1.800.000 pikols (1 pikol = 621bs) yearly, this
would mean that 1.260.000 are produced from land which is taxable,
and allowing for further exemptions, let us put the figure at 1.000.000
pikols. Supposing the average crop of every tenah to be 20 pikols,
then it is clear that duty has to be paid on 50.000 tenahs, this tax
alone yielding from three to three and a half ?tons? of gold every
year (a ?ton? of gold is 100.000 florins).
* According to Liefrinck the term ?tenah? in Bali is meant to represent a stretch of
Sawah that in good years would yield 50 bundles of paddy of a certain size.

? Let us proceed to see how this rice culture, such a source of wealth
to prince and people, is regulated.
An inclined plain, the side of a hill for instance, is divided by banks
and trenches into horizontal strips of land, forming so many terraces;
the water used to flood these frequently comes down from the mountains
through deep ravines and has to be dammed up and subsequently carried
through open or covered aqueducts along] the line of cultivation. After
the land has been ploughed by East Indian buffalo-oxen, the rice is
sown in the trenches, which are left under water until the seed
? Eice harvest.?
germinates, when it is drawn off; later, they are again flooded, and
the alternate flooding and drawing-off is continued until the harvest time.
It is evident that for the laying out of these terraces much practice
.and knowledge are indispensable. The construction of the dams in the
rivers necessitates hard work and abundant material; and the planting
of the stakes to support the aqueducts, the preparing of all these
winding mounds the whole length of the different terraces, are also very
arduous labours; the apportioning of the water, which is very scarce, over
all the various fields, requires continual care and supervision to prevent
either accidental or intentional damage or the draining off of the water.
It is perfectly clear that it would be impossible for each single
individual to do all this for himself.

Thus it has come about that all those interested, whose fields are irrigated
by the same river or branch of a river, have made common cause and
formed societies, which are called soebak-unions or societies from the fact
that all the lands watered from the same source are called ? soebaks.?
The object of these institutions was to ensure to the small land-owner
proportionate advantages to those enjoyed by large proprietors, without
lowever in any way detracting from each man?s individual claim. In
addition to this material benefit, the social bond became strengthened
between dwellers in the same districts, which was in itself a good
thing, for as we have
already remarked,
the Balinese show a
decided disinclination
to cultivate friendly
intercourse with their
neighbours.
As these unions
increased in numbers,
they grew more and
more independent
and in virtue of their
own regulations, the
?kerta simasoebak,?
they assumed full
technical and admin-
istrative authority
in their own terri-
tories,

difference, that with us, it is a question of draining the water off the
land and with them it is a question of carrying it to the land.
The study of this remarkable institution and its rules, is most important,
but we should exceed the limit of our work if we were to do more
than just draw attention to one or two interesting facts; to be brief then;
When inhabitants of a dessa wish to establish a ?soebak? and have
informed themselves that there will be no obstacles placed in their way
by the officials in the dessa where the land is situated, then they make
an application to the ?Sedahan ?agong,? that is to the head of all tho
sawahs and through him the request is placed before the princes, te
whom all rivers and waste lands belong.
When it is clear that the new course would cause little or no damage


to those already existing, then permission is given and the society is at
once constituted.
The first thing they do is to choose a president,?the ? klian-soebak ?
of whom it is expected that he shall study the interests of the society
before all else.
As soon as the season is favorable, they begin work, the ? land is
cleared and parcelled out amongst the members. The klian keeps a
sort of register consisting of a collection of lontar-leaves, on each one
of which is inscribed the name of a share-holder, together with his
address and the area of land that has been allotted to him. The pre-
sident regulates the remaining business of the soebak mostly in con-
junction with the other members, as his position is rather that of a
senior member than that of a chief.
He opens the meetings and presides over them; he has to see to the
carrying out of all the decisions and rules, he fixes the fines and
penalties; besides this he is held responsible for the fair division of the
water and must take precautionary measures against damages of all kinds,
waterstealing, etc. There is no settled salary attached to the office of
president, but sometimes certain privileges are granted, such as a
double share of water. If the district is too extensive to be properly
superintended by one man, it is either subdivided or assistants are chosen
to help the ?klian? in his duties. All the members of the soebak are
bound to assist the klian in turn, and therefore a list of their names
is duly kept.
In cases of dispute arising which fail to be amicably settled by the
klian, appeal is made, to the ? sedahan temboekoe; ? this functionary is
superintendant-general of all the ?soebaks? in one same dessa. His
principal duty is to see that the taxes due to the prince on the sawahs
are paid punctually; he has nothing else whatever to do with agriculture,
beyond supervising the division of the water, where several ?soebaks?
are served from the same source.
If this official is unable to settle matters in dispute to the satisfaction
of those concerned, then they may refer to the fore-named ?sedahan-
agong,? who is the head of the sawah administration and is a person
of unlimited influence.
There are monthly gatherings of all the ? sedahans temboekoes ? under
the presidency of the ?sedahan agong.?
All agricultural questions are discussed, and all questions, that have
remained unsettled by the ?klians? or the ? sedahans temboekoes ? during
the course of the month, are now settled by the head ?sedahan.?
There is of course a final appeal to the prince if the matter be not
satisfactorily settled by the head ?sedahan?; in that case the oath is
administered either to the complainant or the defendant and this
generally takes place in the soebak-temple. These desperate measures are
always avoided as much as possible and the members of the soebak
generally try to arrange their business privately.
Once a month, or more frequently if the interests of the ?soebak?


should require it, the klian summons all the members to a; meeting,
which is generally held at some point from which a view of the entire
? soebak? can be obtained, thus facilitating a speedy anangement of all
matters under discussion. In the early days of the foundation of a
soebak, the gatherings take place in the open, under the shade of some
large tree. Later, � when things begin to prosper, they unite to build a
soebak-temple, so that the meetings may be pleasanter.
Some high spot is generally chosen and the temple is constructed
much on the same plan as those we have- already described. In the
enclosure ?which is not roofed ?there are besides the little gods house,
one or more bales, containing long benches for the members of the soebak.
' One of the rules to be observed at these meetings runs as follows:
? Every one who attends the meeting must be suitably attued, viz., he
must wear a ? sapoet? round the loins, but the upper part of the body
must be uncovered and may not be smeared with ?boreh. Any
infringement of this rule is punishable by a fine.
At the hour fixed for the meeting the klian produces his box of
plaited lontar-leaves, containing all the documents concerning the ?soebak?
and first and foremost is the list of members. Each name is read
aloud, and should a member not answer at once to the call, he is fined.
All absentees are fined, for attendance at these meetings is one of
the chief rules; unless some valid reason is given for omitting to be
present, a penalty is enforced.
? The klian then proceeds to communicate the orders regarding taxation
which he has received from the ?sedahan temboekoe? and to tell them
what repairs are to be carried out on the roads, which it is the duty
of the ?soebak? to keep in good order.
- After this, the affairs of the soebak itself are considered, the water
works, the expediency of renovations, improvements, etc. The klian lays
before the members the statement of the money received in fines and
entrance fees; the money spent in wages, materials, offerings is also
accounted for.
Woe to the klian who should venture to appropriate even one kepeng
of the society?s money. The wrath of the gods would overtake him! At
times there are considerable sums of money in hand and then the membeis
are allowed to borrow on payment of from 4 to 5 per cent a month.
Having fulfilled his duty and placed all matters clearly before the
members, he declares that the business part of the meeting is concluded
and the time for pleasure begins.
The ? sajahs ? or klian?s assistants, who prepared the place of reception
in the morning by sweeping, laying down mats, etc., now bring round
flowers, and offer the various ingredients for the ?boreh, (scented
ointment) with which to freshen up the body after the long sitting;
subsequently refreshments are partaken of, naturally the sirih (leaf of
the betel) occupies the first place, but often there is all kinds of pastry
or even a whole luncheon. In some rules the prescribed courses are
entered and even the quantity allowed for each person is regulated, and


so that there may be no mistake about the matter, a pair of scales fre-
quently occupies a prominent place in the assembly-room.
The chief obligation enjoined on all members of a ?soebak? is, that
one and all shall do a share of the work in the joint undertaking.
Here we see the fulfilment of the principle of general service; here
equality reigns supreme, and every man, be he Brahmin or Sudra, if
he becomes a member of a ?soebak,? is bound by the same rules.
Bach man?s work corresponds to the amount of water he uses, so that
all those who have the same quantity are obliged to perform the same
amount of work; the consumption of water is regulated by the ?klian?
by means of partitions called ?tamoekoes.?
Should any one either by purchase or inheritance become possessed
of more shares of the sawah, he is obliged to nominate a substitute to
look after these or else to pay a fine to the ?soebak.? Certain stipu-
lations are made to prevent one single person from owning too great a
portion of the land, as this would be detrimental to the community.
What are the obligations of a soebak?
These are divided into two classes: 1� those carried out exclusively
for the good of the soebak; 2� those performed for the prince or for
the benefit of agriculture in general.
To the former belong:
1� The keeping in repair of the dams and aqueducts and all things
connected with them, sluices, pipes, paddles, partitions, etc. As soon
as the sawahs no longer require flooding, the water-works are left to
their fate; heavy rains and landslips cause no end of destruction. A
few weeks before the irrigating season begins, the klian makes himself
acquainted with the condition of things and makes his report; he sum-
mons the members to set to work and carry out the needed repairs,
for which hands and time very frequently fail.
2� Supervision over the aqueducts and the water used for flooding.
Under penalty of a fine every member is compelled to make good
immediately any damage that may come under his notice, and should
he be unable to do so, he is bound to apprise the klian of the fact.
In soebaks where there is a scarcity of water, watchmen are placed at
different points to prevent the water being drained off by subterranean
pipes. These men, who are on duty night and day, are replaced every 24
hours; to ensure their guarding the whole length of the aqueduct, a certain
object is given to the men to deposit at the furthermost point of their
beat?this has to be brought back the following day by the next man on
duty; thus the members exercise a sort of control over one another.
8� The maintenance of increased police supervision to support the klian.
4� The keeping in repair of all the roads and pipes, on the prin-
ciple that all lines of communication laid down for the benefit of the
soebak should be kept up by them, even should the general public draw
advantage therefrom.
5� The building and keeping up of the places where the assemblies
are held, the rice barns and the agricultural temples.

Regarding the second class of obligation imposed upon the soebak
members, that is the maintenance of the princes poens, this is peifoimcd
by rendering gratuitous services and generally consists in carrying materials,
such as atap, bamboo, fire-wood, straw, etc. In the greater number of
soebaks these services can be dispensed with on payment of a fee;
exceptions are of course made in cases of illness, still this plea may not
be put forward more than three times a year and here again we see
the soebak members exercising control over one another. Should a man,
who has excused himself on the score of sickness, be seen working else-
where, or walking about with his kris, or wearing a flower behind his
ear or in his hair ?a sign that a Balinese is feeling unusually well and
happy ?it is the duty of whoever sees him, to report him to the klian
and a fine is imposed.
The amount of the fee to be paid for exemption from work for the
prince, is fixed according to the supply and demand and varies in different
soebaks from a half to three and a half rijks dollars (4/6). The request
must be made to the klian at the meeting which takes place when the rice
is being cut, for the great harvest or Oesaba ?festival takes place
shortly after that; and owing to the great importance of this festival
people make preparations for it and think about it a considerable length
of time beforehand. Still this great festival of all is not the first one
of a similar kind, though on a smaller scale, that has been celebrated
by the members of the soebak guild.
The first festivities are held as soon as the labours connected with
the dams are completed; the spot chosen for this celebration is the bank
of the river which supplies the irrigation water; a bamboo structure is
erected and on it are placed the offerings for the gods, which always
include a sucking-pig, a white hen and a white duck. When, says
Liefrinck, the gods have been allowed sufficient time to regale themselves
with the sight of these dainties and the pamangkoe has mumbled a few
invocations, then the whole construction, white duck, white hen, sucking-pig
and everything else are hurled into the river! but these good things must
not be wasted .... oh no ! this last act of sacrifice is the signal for a regular
scrimmage and all those who can, follow the hen and the duck and the
sucking-pig, each man trying to secure for himself the most he can !
At the time of the new moon a second festival is held, that is when
all the water-pipes have been cleared; and in this case the celebrations
and offerings are to obtain the favor of the gods against all bad and
secret influences detrimental to the fertility of the Sawahs.
At the time of the first full moon after the second festival a third is
held to beg of the gods to keep the crops free from disease and to
send them a plentiful harvest.
Twenty-five days before the harvest and for three consecutive days
there are further celebrations in the temple to offer up praise and
prayer to the deities, to obtain from them the favour that the still growing
crops may be full of sap and nourishment.
A couple of days before the harvest begins, a few of the finest ears


of rice are cut, one leaf being left on the stem: these are tied together
in a bunch called ?nini,? and are destined for Sri, the goddess of Fertility.
When the harvest is over and the rice has been gathered into the barns
by the women, this little ? nini ? is placed right on the very top of the
padi, in order to drawn down a blessing on it!
According to circumstances the Oesaba takes place either a few days
before or a few days after the harvest.
The day previous to the actual feast, all the members of the soebak
dressed in their best clothes, go to the shore carrying with them little
wooden caskets, supposed to contain the gods, and other properties
belonging to the temples, besides flowers and offerings. They spend some
little time near the water ?this is to propitiate the gods by taking them to
enjoy a refreshing morning bath?and then accompanied by the ?ga inching ?
they return home and deposit once more all the paraphernalia in the temple.
The next morning early every one goes to the temple, and instead of
their krisses, all the men carry ?goloks,? large knives in handsome
sheaths wherewith to cut up the meat for the sacrificial repast, prepa-
rations for which have been made by the women on the same lines as
those made for New Year?s day. In some localities they play the
? gamelang and dance in the temples; and not infrequently each division
of a sawah sends one young girl to represent it. Sometimes fifty or a
hundred of these girls, prettily dressed and adorned with flowers, per-
form picturesque dances and the jingling of their anklets intermingles
harmoniously with the music of the ?gamelangs.?
Towards the middle of the day every one goes home, but only to
return to the temple later on. This time it is to take the offerings,
which the women carry on wooden platters on their heads and the
whole family, husband, wife and children, go together to place these
before the goddess of agriculture inside the temple enclosure. The
pamangkoes, garbed in white, mutter a few prayers, after which the
offerings are said to be acceptable by the goddess.
From the temple they all proceed to the sawah, as there are further
solemnities to be performed here; at sunset there is a grand procession
to the river, accompanied by music and every pomp, so that by the
time the people reach their homes it is already dusk.
There is however not much interval for rest, for the real feast is
only about to begin, and this of course is in the temple. Here, says
Liefrinck, there are little girls, called ? sangiangs,? who execute a sort
of religious dance.
Numbers of people lie down and fall asleep from sheer fatigue and
are anxious to recuperate their strength for the coming night; mean-
while groups of women quite overcome by the burning incense and the
monotony of the chanting, have reached that stage of spiritual rapture,
which we have described in an earlier part of the work.
In the meantime, distinguishable above the singing is the sound of
the ?gamelang? playing a melody, which is only heard when the so-
called ?goerek? is about to take place :


?By degrees ?thus does Liefrinck describe the performance ?the people
become more and more excited; they unsheath their krisses or seize
hold of a spear and then begin those wild fantastic dances, which
continue all night long and winch take place in the enclosuie of the
temple, with no other light than that of the moon, the lays of which
cannot pierce those high surrounding walls and the dense mass of
shrubs and trees. If the participation in the revelry is large it is not
long before about a hundred of half-naked figures with loose-hanging hair
are n seen to be rushing about excitedly, pretending either to stab them-
selves or others. The dance is led by the klian and at intervals he is
surrounded by a crowd of these howling creatures; they kneel down
and he sprinkles their throats with toja-tirta or arrack, in order to give
them fresh strength and vigour.
?Little by little the women begin to join the dancing community;
even young girls, dressed in men?s clothes, wearing tight-fitting jackets
and carrying krisses in their belts, execute elegant dances. It is however
women of a certain age who appear to be most susceptible to this furious
religious intoxication; they too fly around with krisses and spears and their
behaviour towards the men present is certainly somewhat forward.
?This Saturnalia is kept up until the morning, but as dawn appears
the uproar subsides and the scene proves less attractive; it is impossible
for these ecstasies to continue in the face of day! ?
Let us at least hope so! But the Balinese is not a man to be easily
satisfied and the whole of the next day is devoted to dancing and
feasting and consuming the delicacies which had been prepared for the
g o( j s ?these only having abstracted the immaterial portion, ?while, last
but not least, there are the cock-fights which continue for several days
within the temple enclosure.
It is compulsory for every member of the soebak to take part in all
the dancing, feasting, etc., these rites are considered necessary to obtain
a good harvest! ....
Surely after having carried out punctiliously all the ordained formulas
and not having failed to utter certain ? mantras ? while planting the seed,
a plentiful crop may be expected. But supposing the desired results be
not obtained; well, then there is no doubt that one has been guilty of
some sort of negligence in the matter of sacrifices and there is no one
to blame but one?s self!
From the little we have said, it is clear that the significance of the
soebak regulations can be in no way underrated; it is most remarkable
to find such an institution amongst a native tribe. The rules of the
society are based on the principle of equality, only laying down laws
exclusively for the good of its members, at the same time allowing to
each member a large measure of autonomy, thus, says Liefrinck, verifying
the words of Montesquieu: ?that the produce of the earth is less
dependent on its own fertility, than on the freedom of its inhabitants!?
In view of the immense importance of the wet rice culture all other
agricultural pursuits have fallen into the background.


After the paddy has been gathered in, the sawahs are utilized for
various other more or less valuable crops. First of all there is maize
which is grown very extensively?not as a second crop ?but on certain
high-lying lands in the North of Lombock, called tegal-districts, where
it would be impossible to carry the water necessary for flooding a
sawah. Although enormous quantities are cultivated, it is all required
for home consumption.
This is not the case with the ?kadjang,? (Pandanus odoratissimus)
which is widely planted in the ?tegal? districts and which, though used
as a vegetable by the islanders themselves and as fodder for their
animals, is chiefly looked upon as an article of export. This is more
particularly the case with the ?kadjang idjo,? which is sent chiefly to
China where they distil a very excellent kind of arrack from it. The
demand must naturally be very large, when it is known to cost one
third less than rice in Lombock, whilst it produces one-third more
arrack.
Although cocoa-nut trees are very abundant in Lombock, still the oil
derived from them does not suffice for the inhabitants and large supplies
are obtained from Bali; the kampongs are all very plentifully provided
with all sorts of fruit-trees.
Cotton is grown very extensively, especially in the mountainous districts
on the N. E. coast. It is said to be of exceptional quality, even
superior to that of Macassar, which is noted all over the Archipelago.
There are also sugar and tobacco plantations, but only producing
enough for the island itself; the sugar cane is excellent.
?As I have never seen such fine sugar-canes as in Lombock, says
Zollinger, it is my opinion that this island is as well if not better
adapted for plantations than Java and large sugar factories might be
built on the island. I have heard it said that attempts to carry out
this plan have been suggested, but the Rajah is adverse to the idea and
refuses the necessary assistance. The princes even object to large coffee
plantations, assigning for their reason that they do not wish to attract
European attention to their island.?
That is why they have always strenuously opposed them and made
them almost prohibitory by heavy taxation:
?We also had coffee plantations ?say the Sassak chiefs in the letter
at the beginning of the book?but after the harvest the prince sent his
men to seize it, so that we had not even enough coffee for our own
use. Whenever even two or three katis (one kati = | lb.) were found
in any one?s house, it was immediately confiscated, in addition to which
the owner was fined, etc.?
Possibly the princes from their own point of view saw no particular
injustice in this conduct, but it is to be hoped that henceforward these
plantations as well as the rice culture will be encouraged and that in
the freedom of extension (they may develop as widely as possible, for
certainly there are few places where the combination of soil and climate
is so conducive to their growth. . '


What we have further to say regarding the administration of the
country is borrowed from Liefnnck s ? Contribution to the knowledge of
the Island of Bali: ?
The causes which actuated the organizing of ? soebak-guilds w ere
the same as those which led to the formation of ? dessas and dessa
guilds,? at a much earlier period, probably even before the Hindu
religion had supplanted the old one.
?Balinese desia at Ampenan.?
The increase of the population made it apparent that the near-lying
fields and farms were not numerous enough to supply the requirements
of the people; so the young men used to go to more distant ones,
leaving their homes early in the morning and returning late at night.
By degrees however the distances became greater and greater and
during the busy seasons it would have incurred too great a loss of time


to make the daily journey backwards and forwards, so that they built
themselves little temporary huts where they lived during a part of the
year. As time went on and more people went to the out-lying districts,
returning so seldom to the old home, their interest in the new dwelling
grew stronger and gradually they brought various members of their
family with them and finally the whole family settled itself in the new
district and this was the origin of the Balinese dessa. Endless dangers
surrounded these aboriginal settlers: malicious and evil spirits, noxious
animals, jealous neighbours, booty-seeking marauders; no wonder then
that they felt that their only safeguard against their common enemies
lay in a union of forces for mutual protection.
Thus it was that these ?dessa-guilds? were formed; and in spite of
the lapse of centuries, in spite of the introduction of wet rice culture
with its own particular societies, and in spite of all the changes wrought
by the Hindu-Javanese worship, these dessa-guilds have survived to the
present day, still obeying the same rules as when they were first founded.
The simple little houses of worship, properly-speaking the ? kemoelan
dessa? which were usually found beneath the shade of some rich forest
tree and where the people assembled to make their offerings every five
days, have long since made way for the present gorgeous dessa-temple,
which we have described.
Many new gods have been brought into their land; new priests have
taught new doctrines, still the greatest reverence is always shown to the
original deity who watched over the dessa and protected it in its infancy,
when surrounded by so many perils.
Just as the soebak meetings were held in the soebak temples, so were
the dessa meetings held in the dessa temples; for this purpose the?bale-
agong? was built ?(it is a long shed) and this by degrees became the
great centre of all social intercourse; it was here that they all partook
of the festive repast, which is so prominent a feature of those long
nocturnal ceremonies, to which we have referred while speaking of the
?soebaks,? and here it w r as too that new members were enrolled, generally
on the birthday of the patron god of the dessa.
The number of members was limited and since the foundation of the
guild there has been no variation in this rule. When a member dies
he is replaced by his eldest son and in default of sons by his next-of-
kin. The new-comers are not placed at once on an equality with the
older associates; they have to go through a term of probation first.
During the assemblies and on high feast-days they are not permitted to
sit oivthe ?bale-bale? in the bale-agong, but have to content themselves
with sitting on the floor and this rule is strictly adhered to, no matter
to what caste they belong or what position they hold outside. They
must begin by waiting on the older members, so that they may in time
become worthy members and be fitted to take their share in the
management of the dessa.
They all advance in turn until at last they get a place on the bench;
they go on advancing until finally they reach the top end, where are


the seats occupied by the real ruling powers, the council of the ancients
or the seniors?the ?ramadessa? (really meaning ?fathers? of the dessa).
All have to display the greatest possible care in taking their seats, not
to go one place too high, and especially never to be absent from a
meeting, nor to appear unsuitably attired and while belonging to the
serving brothers not to forget the flowers and mats for the bale-agong
and the sirih for the senior members; just as at the soebak meetings
there are very stringent rules, the ? Kerta sima dessa,? and the infringe-
ment of any of them is very severely punished.
In this wise the members of the dessa-guilds, who are the represent-
atives of entire families and who may be considered as the direct
descendants of the original founders, constitute the legal and executive
authority. They regulate all local matters concerning the dessas, they
maintain and expound the ?adat,? (law founded on ancient customs) and
all the other inhabitants of the dessas owe them obedience. The other
inhabitants of the dessas are the various members of each family, who
under certain circumstances are bound to second the head of the family,
and the ? sampingans,? that is, strangers who have migrated to the dessa
and settled there; they are freely admitted to the temple rites, but they
are too ignorant of the dessa traditions to be allowed a voice in the
assemblies.
In many dessas there is one person who occupies a still higher rank
than the ?fathers? and that is the ?pasek.? His sphere of activity is
chiefly of a religious nature and it is probable that in olden times he
was one of the followers of the ancient religion. The pasek is held in
high esteem by the people and his position corresponds to that of the
pamangkoe of a later period and of whom we shall have occasion to
speak, when referring to the modern dessas, at least those which date
their origin after the introduction of Hinduism.
Besides the ?pasek? there was another important person admitted to
the dessa-guilds and that was the ?penjarikan? or village-clerk.
As the dessa increased in size the revenues augmented and likewise
the expenditure and it became necessary to have an efficient man to
attend to the finances. Although ostensibly occupying a position infe-
rior to the ?pasek? and the ?fathers? he could not fail to have a far-
reaching influence, both as treasurer to the guild and as a man of
learning; he was chosen for his cleverness only and had not to go
through the tedious term of probation to attain his post.
Excepting the distinction in which they were held the members of
the dessa-guilds did not enjoy many material advantages. In the old
days when there was land to be distributed they were allotted a double
share but now they only receive a double share of the temple offerings
and are exempt from vassalage to the prince.
Regarding this vassalage or feudal system, be it said that it was
regulated according to the ownership of the land?as the dessa-guilds
obtained >possession of the sod, it became the duty of their members to
be at the disposal of the prince and the gods. In course of time the


possession of the land passed from the dessas to individuals and with
the land the duties attached to it.
Not to enlarge too much upon this topic, we will only say about these
dessa obligations, which were also binding on women and childern that:
When the boys have attained the age when they can be more advan-
tageously occupied than by looking after the buffalo-oxen, ?the age when
they are allowed to carry a kris in their belts?they are expected to
perform certain duties in the temple, such as playing the gamelang and
executing various dances. To the girls too, are allotted a few light
duties, which are increased after marriage.
Usually one year of exemption from service is allowed to a newly-
married couple, to give them time to settle their private affairs, but
after that period their names are inscribed on the register kept by the
? penjarikan ?? and they must hold themselves in readiness for all duties
required by prince, temple or dessa. It is perhaps needless to say that
the ?Kerta sima dessa? contains very definite clauses and no cases of
neglect, deception or transgression are allowed to go unnoticed and
unpunished.
On the other hand, account is taken of circumstances which might
arise in every household; and as we have said before the old men are
released from their term of service when their eldest sons replace them
or if through failing strength they should be unfitted for work.
As we said before, not all the dessas can boast of such an ancient
origin. In the formation of the later ones, where the privilege to con-
struct the bale-agong was not recognized, the inhabitants united, as it
simplified their duties both spiritual and temporal, while their individual
interests were better guarded. At this period the early dangers had
disappeared and that strong feeling for very close union no longer
existed; new-comers were more frequent and insisted upon the same
rights as those who had preceded them.
In these newer dessas, instead of the ?pasek,? there was the ?pamang-
koe? at the head of the temple-service and the executive authority was
vested in one man, the ? klian-desssa,? ?and in a more democratic
spirit,?every inhabitant of the dessa could claim membership of the
guild when he married.
The ? klian ? is elected from amongst the members, according as the
gods appoint. Very little benefit is attached to the post, which really
entails a good deal of trouble; as a rule a ?klian? who has proved
himself satisfactory is succeeded by his son. In case of a new choice
having to be made, it would be detrimental to the priest?s authority to
designate for the post an unsuitable person, the chances being that the
people would not accept him, for, however simple and believing the
dessa inhabitants may be they expect the gods to select an intelligent klian!
They are not so very stupid after all!
Sometimes there is a special ?penjarikan? as in the older dessas, but
as often as not this office is included in that of the klian.

Naturally, the dessa rules lay down very minutely what are the duties
of the klian towards the members of the guild.
Finally, sundry coercive measures may be resorted to in order to
enforce the rules laid down by the ?Krama dessa? or the ?klian?;
these vary from a small fine to the penalty of death. In the latter
case, it is compulsory at once to inform the deity in the temple and the
?Pumbuckle,? the prince?s representative.
Certain offences entail expulsion from the dessa-guild; in that case
un oath is taken never to cross the threshhold of the guilty man, not

?even in cases of sickness or death, nor to provide him with food or fire.
He is no longer admitted to the temple; no Balian-dessa (village-doctor)
may give him physical aid, and no ?pamangkoe? or ?pasek? may give
him spiritual comfort.
The ? kalas ? have full power over him, and if he or any member of his
household die, the village burying-ground is closed to them.
The body is left to its fate, no prayer is offered up, no offering is
made for the release of the 50u1....


This insight into the dessa administration shows us the power and
independance possessed by the guilds; it shows us that equality is one
of the primary conditions, therefore we can safely allege that they do
not owe their existence to the influence of Hinduism, with its narrow
laws of caste and its one-sided justice. The same reasons which preclude
our giving the exact date of the origin of the ?soebak-guild,? prevents
our giving that of the dessa-guilds; presumably they reach back to the
period when the Hindu-Javanese established themselves at Bali and the
dessa-guilds acknowledged them as arbitrators if they promised not to
interfere with the adat. The ancient customs and rules must have been
written down and submitted to the sanction of these arbitrators, who
became princes later on, and who no doubt introduced a few conditions
of their own or added a few formalities from the old Hindu laws ?this
would account for the discrepancies in the dessa manuscripts.
The natives, having an inborn veneration for all things old, attach
considerable importance to these manuscripts and the rules of the
guild,?which are written on from ten to twenty lontar leaves, held
together by a wooden cover, are kept wrapped up in cotton-wool inside
a handsome case in the temple, where they are entrusted to the care
of the pamangkoe. (As they were often stolen from the temple, says
Liefrinck, it w r as considered wiser to transfer them to the house of the
klian or the penjarikan, where they were accorded a place of honour.)
When the rules have to be consulted, it is necessary in the first
instance to obtain the consent of the gods. When this is granted costly
offerings are prepared, incense is burned and the rules are produced to
the sounds of the sacred gamelang and amidst a solemn gathering.
In consequence of these endless formalities, it is rare to meet any one
who is really acquainted with all the rules, which are sometimes not
read to the people for a generation.
From the little we have narrated regarding the dessa family-life, it
will, we hope, be sufficient to prove that just as Hinduism has only
touched the outer surface of their religion, it has failed to penetrate
into their social institutions, which like their gods originate from the
time when Polynesian heathendom was all-powerful.
How is it that all these different dessas, forming as it were so many
small republics, came under the sovereign rule of the Balinese princes?
It follows as a matter of course that disputes must have arisen from
time to time amongst these numerous dessas and that they became more
frequent as their territorial borders touched one another; these disputes
were not always amicably settled and the remembrance of these border
warfares has not yet died out amongst the inhabitants.
Eventually it became evident to all concerned that these continual
hostilities were to the advantage of neither litigant and so it was decided
to refer all matters of contention to arbitrators who were to pronounce
judgment on the question at issue. Where these arbitrators gave evidence
of tact and skill, their influence was bound to make itself felt and an


ever-increasing number of questions was submitted to their judgment,
thus it came to pass that groups of dessas, who, although having nothing
else in common, selected the same judge to settle their differences.
Once invested with a certain amount of power, these men sought
to extend it; this was the origin of the Balinese princes, who
owe their descent to the free choice of the people and not to any god-
like source.
Although many changes have occurred with the increasing power of
the princes, still the inhabitant of the dessa has the right to refuse
obedience to the prince by reason of the basis on which his authority
rests, viz., that he is entitled only to the voluntary respect and homage
of the people.?
How did the princes exercise their control over the dessas P
As the territories over wdiich they ruled grew vaster, it became neces-
sary to have the assistance of subordinates, both in order to keep better
informed of what was going on in the more distant districts and also
that these deputies or representatives might transact business of an
unimportant nature.
A representative ?a poenggawa ?chosen from amongst the prince?s
relatives or from amongst the most influential families of the neighbour-
hood was appointed to superintend a certain number of dessas, forming
a district. In some cases the ? poenggawa?s ? authority was not defined
by boundary limits; for instance if a ?poenggawa? were chosen from a
?Sudra? family, he only exercised power over the members of his own
caste, and all the other inhabitants within his district were only amenable
to the prince.
As it was impossible for these ? poenggawas ? to represent the prince
adequately in far-reaching districts they again appointed a ? Klian-
mantja?? for every dessa.
This personage is often brought into contact with the adminstration
of the dessa, by having to confer with the ?fathers of the dessa? or
with the ? Klian dessa.? He has however no share in the management
of the internal affairs of the dessa, and he is only consulted, as we
have seen, in cases of dispute, which the dessa-guilds are unable to
settle, and which are then placed before him or the higher placed
ooenggawa for arbitration. If the parties concerned are dissatisfied with
lis decision, they can bring the matter before the prince, who passes
judgment with or without consulting his Brahmin priests.
In virtue of the ?metilas? i.e. right to refuse obedience, the dessa
inhabitants could refuse to obey to a poenggawa who did not suit them
and could request the prince to substitute another in his place; so that
although it is evident that there were mediators between prince and
people, these formed no body intervening between the two, but acted
simply as representatives of both.
In return for the protection afforded them by the prince and in
gratitude for his acting as arbitrator, the people undertook certain obli-
gations towards him. They provided abundantly for all his needs; they


gave him the best their land produced, they made it their business to
build his poeris and maintain them in repair; they accompanied him on
his travels and helped him to carry on his wars. The prohibitory laws
of the dessa regulations were not applicable to him.
This then was the legal position of the Balinese princes and all these
prerogatives had been freely bestowed by the people.
Not content with these privileges, they have abused the power con-
ferred on them and have left no stone unturned to make it absolute
and to enrich themselves at the expense of their subjects.
In the centre of their domain they have built an extensive settlement,
a veritable fortress, a poeri, inhabited by people dependent solely upon
them and devoted exclusively to their service. As we have seen, they
raised taxes on the most important land products, first on the cultivation
of rice, on the running water, which was originally claimed by the dessas
and then they levied import and export duties.
They have claimed both the effects and real estate of all who die
without male issue and also the estate and effects of all who are con-
demned by the law to suffer the death penalty.
Cock-fights for their benefit are taking place nearly all the year round
and when all these taxes fail to satisfy their greed, then they let loose
their ?panjoerans? to prey upon the people.
The Balinese have submitted to this usurpation of power with Eastern
resignation and have made no complaint against all the oppression and
extortion. They patiently submit to see their princes leading lives of
pleasure, dividing their time between women, opium and cock-fights;
they are sometimes detained for days at the capital when they wish to
consult the prince on business connected with the dessas or kampongs,
for as often as not he is engaged watching the ?gamboehs?,* which
continue for days, and cannot be interrupted for business.!
?Such, says Liefrinck, is still at the present day the conditon of the
independent states, only it is too faintly drawn, for the private history
of every poeri cannot possibly be described in these pages; the cringing
servility with which every whim and desire of the prince is gratified,
joined to the knowledge that he has supreme power over life and death
is responsible for this shocking and scandalous condition of things!?
It sometimes happened at Bali, that when the conduct of the princes
grew beyond endurance, the people made use of their prerogative to
refuse them obedience and transferred their allegiance to some other
)ctty sovereign. As time went on however the fear of our intervention
had a salutary effect in checking too glaring abuses. At Lombock
where the various small Balinese states were all ruled from Mataram,
things were in a very bad way, for here the Rajah?s sway was unbounded
and there were no petty sovereigns, whose rivalry was to be feared and
there was no redress for his Balinese subjects. The Sassaks themselves
fared considerably worse though; they had no voice in the administration
and all the best and most remunerative posts were given to the Balinese.

It was only by compulsion that they obtained such inferior positions as
tax-collector or pumbuckle (village-chief). Some few still bear the title
of raden (title of nobility) as evidenced in the letter written by the
Sassak chiefs?Zollinger presumes them to be descendants of those chiefs
who formerly submitted to the Balinese without any opposition?but
beyond this imaginary independence and very few privileges, they are
not recognized as holding any official rank and they are never permitted
to take any share in the government.
The Balinese princes divided the Sassak territory into districts, which
in cases of dense population, were again divided into sub-districts,
generally corresponding to the old Sassak kingdoms, the capital of which

has always been Praja. The government of these districts was entrusted
to their chief Idas and Gustis, who were appointed ? poenggawas ?;
instead of giving ithem fixed salaries for their services, they received
extensive tracts of land, with the additional right to enrich themselves
as much as they could by every imaginable kind of extortion or in any
other illegal fashion they could devise.
It is needless to say that one means generally resorted to, was that
of appropriating for their own benefit a fair share of the prince?s tax?
and their attitude towards the Sassaks was worse than tyrannical:
?Besides working for the princes, we were compelled to work also
01 the suboidinate Balinese chiefs and yet, in spite of this we have


suffered harsh treatment. People are put to death without trial and for
very slight offences. If these chiefs were angry with any one, he
was accused of some crime or other and sentenced; we dared not
rebel. Frequently our property, such as ?sawahs?, gardens, buffalo-
oxen and cows were taken from us without any compensation
whatever....
?Every year the taxes have been most unjustly raised.
?If the princes or any of the notables wanted anything, either
people or horses or wearing apparel, they simply took them from us,
without seeing any need to give an indennity* ....
?Our sons were often made slaves and our girls . . . .?
We have heard all these complaints in the letter from the Sassak
chiefs and we think that we are enabled to form an opinion on the
manner in which the Sassak population was ruled.
So conscious were the poenggawas of their evil deeds and so much
afraid of the consequences, that they dared not establish themselves in
their respective districts, but resided at Mataram, the centre of Balinese
jower, or in the neighbourhood of this capital and from here they sent
forth their orders and their tax collectors and spies who were to keep
them informed of the frame of mind of the people and their plans and
they in turn imparted what they considered necessary to the prince.
This is the way in which the poenggawas ill-treated and oppressed
the people in the name of the Rajah; this is the way in which he
himself reigned as an autocratic despot, sucking out the very life?s blood
of his subjects and living in splendour and dissipation bought at the
cost of so much hardship and injustice.... and finally, under the
oernicious influence of Anak Agong Made, becoming more brutal and
barbarous day by day, and year by year!
It is time to return to the geographical description of the island.
From a military point of view, our attention is at once drawn to
Ampenam, the most important commercial town, not only on the West
coast, but of the whole island of Lombock.
As we have seen, it is from this port that the large cargoes of rice
are exported, and the imports landed here are chiefly tobacco, horses,
oxen, hides and kapas (movable decks for protection against the waves
made of light wood). Here too Lombock receives her supplies of salt,
arrack, linen and cocoa-nut oil; in case of blockade the island would
be deprived of these articles. On the strand is raised the flag-staff,
discernible at a great distance and so well-known to all our officials,
flying the Lombock colours: red, white, blue, white and red, with which
flag we had to content ourselves instead of our own Netherlands standard
in order to have our Suzerainty acknowledged by the treaty of 1848!
All there was to protect it, were a couple of old cannons, only fit for
firing salutes; there were no signs of anything else to guard it... .
* Controller Heijligers tells us that the princes did not consider it wise to allow the
Sassaks to own more land than would produce sufficient for their private needs; anything
over and above was taken from them. No more landed proprietors were permitted amougst
the Sassaks!


Behind the flag-staff, about 500 metres from the shore, stands a
magnificent and gigantic waringin tree, forming a prominent landmark
for our ships.' In former times the Netherlands Indian steamship
company had an agency here, but now it consists of a few stone
dwellings and store-houses belonging to the prince and to some mer-
chants settled there, besides which there were four kampongs inhabited
by Bngis, Malays, Balinese and Sassaks.
Many advantages are attached to this spot as a landing-place. To begin
with it offered at least during the East monsoon, a very safe place for
Waringin-tree in the marketplace at Ampenan.
vessels to ride at anchor. The water being very deep quite close to
shore, even very large ships can anchor within 700 metres of it; at a
distance of 800 metres from the flag-staff it is 17 metres deep; at 750
metres it is 20 metres; and at 1500 it is as much as 81 metres deep.
Besides there was no other point situated so close to Mataram and
Tjakara Nagara, the centres of Balinese power ; it was the most conve-
nient starting-point, leading along the best and shortest roads to the
places where the troops would be called upon to carry out their operations.


Still even during the East monsoon this landing-place had one insur-
mountable defect; avc will quote Wallace?s description:
? The bay or roadstead of Ampenam is extensive, and being at this
season sheltered from the prevalent south-easterly winds, was as smooth
as a lake. The beach of black volcanic sand is very steep, and there
is at all times a heavy surf upon it, which during spring-tides increases
to such an extent that it is impossible for boats to land, and many
serious accidents have occurred. Where we lay anchored, about a quarter
of a mile from the shore, not the slightest swell was perceptible, but
on approaching nearer undulations began, which rapidly increased so as
to form rollers which toppled over on to the beach at regular intervals
with a noise like thunder. Sometimes this surf increases suddenly during
perfect calms, to as great a force and fury as when a gale of wind is
Dlowing, beating to pieces all boats that may not have been hauled
sufficiently high upon the beach, and carrying away incautious natives.
This violent surf is probably in some way dependent on the swell of
the great southern ocean, and the violent currents that flow through
the straits of Lombock. These are so uncertain that vessels preparing
to anchor in the bay are sometimes suddenly swept away into the
straits, and are not able to get back again for a fortnight! What
seamen call the ?ripples? are also very violent in the straits, the sea
appearing to boil and foam and dance like the rapids below a cataract;
vessels are swept about helpless, and small ones are occasionally
swamped in the finest weather and under the brightest skies.
Zollinger also says that very little wind is necessary to produce such
a heavy surf that neither loading nor unloading a ship is possible.
The new moon and full moon tides are so high that all communi-
cation between Ampenam and the harbour is temporarily suspended?
the water rises more than 5 feet higher than under ordinary circum-
stances (8 to 10 feet); the waves beat Avith such extraordinary force
against the beach that the houses in the neighbourhood are shaken to
their very foundations.
? Whatever may be the cause of this sudden tempestuousness, it has to be
taken into serious consideration, when the harbour not only serves as a
landing-place, but as the basis of operation.
If the position leaves something to be desired during the East mon-
soon, during the West monsoon the roadstead is entirely at the mercy
of the Avinds and surf, so that even large ships are no longer safe and
have to keep outside the bay; and as long as the wind is high ther6
is no question of anchoring or landing.
These difficulties led to the attempt to build a jetty in times gone
by, says Zollinger; but the technical difficulties in the way were too
great then, though they have now been overcome and a pier is in course
of construction.
A particularly sheltered place, protected from all winds is Labuan
Tring, also on the West coast, but further South; it is hardly worth
mentioning Tandjong Karang and Padang Reak, for they present the


same obstacles as Ampenam, without the corresponding advantages.
Able seamanship is essential to reach this port on account of the
reef at the entrance of the bay, but once inside it ships are perfectly
safe, ?at least as regards dangers from the high seas, but other perils,
not to be treated with scorn, are apt to overtake the unwary!
Mr. King had a dock built here for the construction and repairing
of ships, the neighbouring forests supplying him with abundant material;
but he lost nearly all his men by sickness, so that this bay has a bad
reputation and ships never touch here unless driven by dire necessity.
This introduces the all-important question for an expedition: what are
the health conditions of the country?
At first sight, says Zollinger, one would feel inclined to declare the
island very healthy; the land is well cultivated and lies high, the water
is excellent; marshes in the proper sense of the word there are none ?
the long narrow tracts along the coast from Ampenam to Tandjong
Karang being more trenches than marshes?and both mountain winds
and sea-winds blow all day long and moderate the excessive heat.
(Zollinger gives the temperature from 69� to 91� Fahrenheit; Mr. King,
who resided so much longer at Lombock gives the extremes at 67� and
104� Fahrenheit) ?Still, writes Zollinger, my sad experience is that with
the exception of Pidjoe on the East coast, the climate of Lombock is
dangerous. Just as at Ampenam and Labuan Tring, severe fevers were
raging on the whole length of the North coast.? How account for this
extraordinary fact, in face of the apparently favorable hygienic situation?
Zollinger was unable to solve the problem; he tried to find an
explanation in the exhalations from the volcanic soil, which are much
to be feared during the season of the West monsoon. Without pronoun-
cing judgment, might we not suggest that not too much value must be
placed on this idea without a minute examination of the soil and may
we not surmise that the prince in his dealings with Zollinger somewhat
exaggerated the danger in order to discourage the presence of the hated
foreigner ?
Was not the health of the troops excellent during the first period of
the expedition ?
In no case would it be fair to ascribe to the climate of Lombock
all the sickness that overtook our men; the consequences of the war,
overstraining, fatigue, privations, insufficient protection from climatic
changes, all these are in -themselves quite enough to have a deteriorating
effect even on the most robust. Let us remember Badjo and Atcheen, etc.
We think that the fact that illness only appeared later on and by degrees,
is a plea in defence of the salubrity of Lombock under normal conditions.
To go back to our bays and harbours, we must not omit to mention
the bay of Padjoe, near the little town of that name; according to
Zollinger it is to the East coast what Ampenam and Labuan Tring are
to the West: that is to say, it combines safety and facility of access,
added to an exceptionally healthy climate.
It would be invaluable from a military point of view, were it not for

the long distance which separates it from Mataram 64 pals (1 pal =
1506.94 metres),* says Zollinger, or nearly the whole breadth of the
island; but as a port for the Sassaks themselves to import weapons or
other materials, it offers innumerable advantages.
The more northerly situated bays of Labuan Hadji and Lombock have
the same drawback?that of distance ?without offering the corre-
sponding advantages as Pidjoe; Labuan Hadji is dangerous even during
the East monsoon.
Telok Blongas on the South and Sogean on the North, both present
difficulties of distance and are really of minor importance.
Central Lombok is traversed by a' long valley running from East to
West of the whole island which is only broken by a small hill, the
Gunong Sesan, about 100 feet high and having a surface of 10 pals;
further it is bordered both on the North and the South by two wide

and almost inaccessible mountain chains which separate it from the coast
The Southern chain, starting from Lombock?s most South-Western point,
Tandjong Bangko-Bangko and continuing to Tandjong Ringit on the
S. East, is the less important?the summits not rising above 1000
feet?but owing to the impenetrable forest growth and the total lack
of roads or paths, it may be said to form an almost impassable barrier
for troops. The Northern chain is connected with it by the low-lying
range, the Gunong Sesang above mentioned; the latter chain however
forms a striking contrast to the Southern range; it is of volcanic origin
and forms a mountain mass of considerable height and breadth. From
the Gunong Wangsit near Tandjong Rombeh, about 10 pals north of
Ampenam, there is one unbroken chain to the G. Ponikan, after which
?accounts differ as to there being bridle paths suitable for troops ?
we have one formidable clump of mountains covering the entire surface

of N. East Lombock and only terminating at Tandjong Pandan-Pandan
on the East coast.
We think it almost superfluous to say that we are now at the toot
of the famous Gunong Rindjani or Peak of Lombock, whose 1200 feet
summit conceals the Dewa Agong of the Lombock Balinese, the deity
with whom the old Rajah had that remarkable interview related by Wallace.
Let us seek further acquaintance with this giant amongst our Indian
mountains from Zollinger, the only European, who has hitherto made
the ascent. A description of the difficulties encountered by one single
individual will serve to illustrate, although somewhat faintly, the herculean
task of moving an army through virgin mountain lands.
It was on the occasion of a second visit to the prince Bato Agong
Ketot Ngorah Karangassim and his brother Rato Agong Gedeh Ngorah
Karangassim that Zollinger requested leave to make the ascent, which
permission had even been refused to Mr. King.
The prince raised numberless objections ?one must remember the
superstitious fear of the Balinese for this mountain there w ere too
many perils and he would probably meet with an accident.
?I informed the prince, through Mr. King, says Zollinger, that I was
accustomed to climbing high mountains, that I feared no accidents and
that I did not intend to leave the island without visiting the Peak..
Mr. King further added on his own account; ?If you refuse this gentle-
man?s request, they will say at Batavia that you mistrusted him and that
would make a bad impression on the Dutch government with whom you
are on such friendly terms!?
?With whom you are on such friendly terms!? How times do
change! At that time however they were hoping to be raised from
out of their position as vassals; it was just about this time too July
or August 1846 ?that our first expedition against Bali had taken place,
which through its speedy and favorable issue (to us) had so deeply
impressed the Rajah of Lombock and his brother! They were always
wanting Mr. King to tell them about it and were never tired of listening
to his account of the battle of Boeleleng;
?They would not or could not believe that all w r as over 111 less than
three days and above all they could not believe that a Balinese rajah
had sought safety in flight, instead of remaining with his people in his
kraton and fighting to the death as demanded by the adat and the
honour of a Rajah!?
Strange freak of destiny!
That very same brother, whom Zollinger saw as ?a young man of 28
with certainly the most intelligent countenance that I have ever seen on
any man of the Malay race, with a good-natured smile, but a little
satirical,? that same brother after becoming the curse of his people by
his infamous savagery and oppression, ended half a century later by
surrendering himself to that government whom he had so long defied,
instead of ?remaining in his poeri with all his men and fighting to the
death, as demanded by the adats and the honour of a Rajah! ?


Zollinger succeeded in obtaining leave to ascend the Rindjani on the
strength of the motives that had been urged by Heer King, but not
before signing a paper to the effect that, should any mishap occur to
him, it would be entirely his own fault and no one else would be to blame.
With that suspicion, peculiar to the native, the Rajah fancied that
Zollinger had been sent to the island for the express purpose of getting
him into trouble, for he felt convinced in his own mind that an accident
was bound to happen during the ascent and then he expected the government
to take advantage of it and this would lead to complications.
Provided with the necessary letters of recommendation from the
Rajah s prime minister to the chiefs, who might be of service to him
on his journey, and a special one to the principal Raden, the Sassak
chief, who lived 18 pals from Mataram, the naturalist started on the
Bud of August with a few attendants, two interpreters and a number
of coolies.
? The first day we did not make much progress and spent the night
at Pringa Bata, where the rajah has a small hut, which serves as his
dwelling-place when hunting in the neighbourhood.
?As we were not expected at Pringa Bata, winch is but a very small
and poor kampong, we experienced some difficulty in procuring a little
rice, oil and a chicken. My letter from the gusti to the pumbuckle was
of little or no use, as the latter was unable to read. On leaving Pringa
Bata the land is less cultivated; there is a long forest to traverse which,
leads to a hilly district covered with alang-alang (imperata arundinacea).
?At Batu Klian, the place where the Raden of whom I have spoken
lived, I required a horse and a few men. Accordingly I went to his
house to present my letter, but found that he was absent from home,
stag-hunting. His brother was so disagreeable that I had to depart
without my request being complied with. The Raden at Batu Klian is
the most powerful and independent Sassak chief, which acounts for
his disregard of the Rajah?s orders being passed over with impunity.
(This was before the great rising in 1855, after which the Rajah?s
autority was enforced with far greater severity.) In the next kampong
to Batu Klian, I again presented my letter and here my requirements
were at once attended to.
?A few pals further the country is level again and the land is as
well cultivated as on the West side of the island.
?Towards 5 p. m. we reached Loijok, situated South of the Peak of
Lombock and only a short distance from the foot of the mountain;
lieie we spent the night, so as to have a good rest and also in order
to make the necessary preparations. The Raden received us courteously
and did his best to entertain us, a pity he was so very slow about
everything! He assured us that the ascent would occupy a fortnight
at least and regaled us with the most terrible stories connected with
such an enterprise, presumably in the hopes the narration of these
horrors would cause our courage to fail and lead to our giving up our


plans. It was my intention to start on the morning of the 6th, but
neither coolies, nor horses, nor provisions were ready at the appointed
time. The Raden told me that I should find the guides and some rice
at a kampong on my way; but I found neither. Then I sent word to
the Raden that I should not proceed without first having everything 1
wanted. The pumbuckle of the kampong who had not obeyed his orders
was arrested and sent to Mataram, where he was still in prison when I
returned there.
?The science of procrastination ? was therefore not unknown even
in Lombock!
?I was unable to continue my journey until the afternoon. Cultivated
land was soon left behind and I penetrated the forests, where I had
some difficulty in keeping to a path, which at times seemed to lose
itself. In the evening the guides declared they only knew the way as
far as the mountain, but with the paths in the mountain itself they
were totally unacquainted never having been there.
?I of course dismissed them immediately and sent a message to the
Raden saying he was to send me others without delay. My attendants
were continually wanting to halt, especially at certain points, where
burnt wood showed them that others had halted there before. I
threatened to continue the expedition by myself, not only without guides
but without coolies, and they could settle things with the Rajah from
whom they knew what they might expect if an accident of any kind
overtook me.
?This argument had the desired effect and we dragged on a little
further, until we reached a spring, where I decided to stay the night.
?The following day after climbing first one height and then another,
we finally arrived at the top, towards three o?clock in the afternoon
and then I discovered that this was not the real summit of the Peak
at all, but a much more southern point.
?Notwithstanding that this mountain top was enveloped by thick
clouds, the sight I beheld was of the most imposing nature. The crest
of the Peak is a vast lake, several pals long and wide; the different
mountain tops within sight rise perpendicularly to from 2000 to 4000 feet
above the ground which is covered by a small lake, lying about 2000 feet
beneath me. The East border of the lake is skirted by a level tract,
in the middle of which rises a cone-shaped carboniferous hill (rock)
about 500 feet high, pouring forth smoke from every crevice and the
ground is strewn with brimstone and other volcanic matter. The point
which I had climbed was not the Rindjani but the G. Sankarean.
?To proceed was out of the question; the descent from the point
was almost vertical and I was separated from the nearest of the neigh-
bouring summits by a ravine about 1500 ft. deep. A furious East wind
Avas chasing the clouds round the heights and creating such intense cold
that the coolies were quite speechless and many of them had fever.
They implored of me not to spend the night here and as I myself felt
but little inclination to unnecessarily prolong my stay in this inhospitable

legion, I decided to retrace my steps after taking an outline of the shape
of the mountain/'
At an altitude of 8000 feet we found a small ravine, where sheltered
florn the intense cold, we settled down for the night. What tormented
us most was a temble thirst, for the natives had told me we should
find watei in plenty and I had been imprudent enough not to carry
any with us, so that we could not even cooc our food. My thirst became
so intolerable that I spent the whole night drinking vinegar with smrar
which produced such severe inflammation in my throat that for days I
was unable to swallow anything at all.
?The River Djangkok.?
?On the Bth, before leaving the mountain, I climbed the nearest
height to the one I had already ascended. The descent was easily
accomplished and towards noon we had reached our first bivouac again;
needless to say that we all hurried to the spring and slaked our thirst
with a sense of appreciation such as is seldom felt. Soon after this we
met the fresh guides whom we no longer needed. At 5 p. m. we were
back at Loijok, to the great amazement of the inhabitants, who would
not believe that we had climbed the mountain in three days and after
this marvellous feat they looked upon me quite as a privileged being.?
The points which Zollinger was unable to ascend were the Gunong

OUB KNOWLEDGE OF THE COUNTRY AND ITS PEOPLE.


Bandeira, the G. Rindjani and the Waijan. In the middle of the group
there is a fifth cone, the G. Api, which is the actual crater from which
sulphurous fumes are always being emitted.
At the foot of the G. Wayan and the Sankarean is the lake of Danu
or Segara Anak which Zollinger had seen from the top and which is
said to contain hot water springs.
According to Van Eck it is from this lake that most of the rivers
take their source and flow in the direction of the great central valley,
thus irrigating the whole country.
Zollinger was more inclined to think that the rivers rise in the various
Southern slopes of Lombock?s great mountain chain. In any case all
travellers who have visited this region are agreed as to the abundance
of water, an abundance so rich, that with very few exceptions the rivers
are never dried up, not even during the East monsoon and in most
districts there is a sufficient supply of water to meet the requirements
of the wet rice culture.
There are a great many artificial wells, especially in the neighbourhood
of Mataram, where the drinking-water is excellent.
It is only possible for there to be a scarcity on the East coast near
Pidjoe; at least this is what we gather from Dr. van Hoevell?s trans-
lation of a book of travels written by an Englishman. There are no
rivers of importance on this coast. It is quite possible that this part
of the island is too far from the mountain range of North Lombock,
which attracts the vapours of the East monsoon which return to the
earth in the shape of rain.
It is only natural that the relatively small area of the island and the
distribution of the mountain land should not permit of any very large
or important rivers. Zollinger says that not one of the little Lombock
streams is navigable, even for small boats. Still the number makes up
for the size, at least on the West and North coasts.
In every direction these small shallow rivers come streaming down
from the hills and fertilize the valleys below. Mother Nature has wisely
laid their sources deep down in the mountain sides, but reluctantly
submitting to their yoke, they burst forth whenever an opportunity
offers and in their youthful exuberance, playful and frolicsome, they
rush downwards through a thousand winding paths, sometimes leaping
a hundred feet at a time, shooting forth with the suiftness of an arrow.
Youth is always in a hurry to reach its goal?but as years go by
bringing wisdom along with them, the waters begin to flow more steadily
and more measuredly until at last overtaken by inevitable fate they too
reach the end of their career.
Which are the most important of these small rivers here on the West
coast which take their source from the Gunong Sesan?
The most important from a military point of view is the Sungei
Djangkok, running North of Mataram to Ampenan, crossing the main
road between the two towns at about 600 metres from the before-
mentioned flagstaff and flowing into the sea a little further south. No


bridge spans the river where it crosses the road at which point it is
about 87 metres wide, for under ordinary circumstances this presents
no great difficulties and it is quite easy to ford it either on foot or on
horseback. When however the stream is swollen by heavy rains it
makes communication a more serious matter; this was experienced by
Heer van Rijckevorsel when he started from Ampenam to pay his
respects to the prince at Mataram:
?We started on horseback at 8 a. m. but we were soon convinced
that it would be utterly impossible to appear in the presence of the
prince, even in a fairly presentable manner. The river which we had
to ford was very much swollen and owing to the heavy rain it was
the 24th October, the beginning of the West monsoon ?the road, which
at other season is very good, was a perfect stream and we were
splashed up to our ears with mud! ?
Later we ourselves suffered from the bitter experience, that no com-
munication at all was possible at a certain period.
There is a second small river running through Mataram, which then
pursuing its course in a more southerly direction, flows into the sea
across the beach at Ampenan.
Further East between Tjakara Nagara and Kupang (the furthermost
point visited by Wallace) the high road is intersected by sundry small
rivers, such as the S. Banjak or Narmada, the S. Babak?which Zol-
linger speaks of as the largest on the West coast ?and the S. Bakong,
which all flow into the sea between Ampenam and Labuan Tring.
In a Northern direction from Ampenam is the S. Meninting, a little
river that was crossed by the naval lieutenant Bollaan, when paying a
visit to Gunong Sahari at his princely residence about 8-| pals from
Mataram, where it is wide but shallow. The other small rivers on the
North coast are too insignificant for separate mention; but excepting
during the East monsoon, there is plenty of water and the people are
healthy and the soil is fertile.
On the South coast, where the close proximity of the mountain range
to the sea does not permit of any fresh water streams, water is very
.scarce, barely supplying the daily needs of the sparse population inhab-
iting this inhospitable region?so that from a military point of view
it is useless to discuss it.
We may thus safely assume that, the great valley of Lombock includ-
ing the West coast which is the seat of eventual war operations, is
well provided with water; but on the other hand we must not make
too light of the serious difficulties bound to ensue during the West
monsoon when the rivers are swollen and nearly all means of commu-
nication cut off.
We must still say one word about the roads. Of course we cannot
mention them all, nor can we state with absolute accuracy the exact
direction of each one with the names of the places through which they
pass. We will content ourselves by speaking only of the condition of
the roads in general.


The high road which cuts straight across the island from Ampenam
on the West coast through Mataram, Tjakra Nagara, Narmada, Pringa
Rata and Batu Klian to Labuan Hadji and Pidjo on the East coast,
might be improved here and there, where it lies in Sassak territory.
The Englishman, of whom van Hoevell speaks and who visited Lom-
bock in June 1845 (East monsoon) says this road is very good and he
covered the entire distance in two days on horseback. Preyss on his
return from Sumbawa (1856) took three days.
Controller Heyligers also says the road is good, varying from 10 to
25 metres in breadth and admitting of carts traversing it; then there
are side-roads leading to the North-East through Kota-Radja to Lombock
and others running South-East through Kediri and Praja to the bay of
Pidjo and though these are less wide, still they are passable. It may
be wisest to accept what Zollinger says regarding these side roads lying
out of the master?s sight.
?The remainder of the roads can be used by people on horseback
although at times they are very bad, either on account of the rivers
or canals, the beds of which not infrequently serve as paths, or on
account of the steep gradients or the huge boulders which they are
too lazy to move away. During the bad weather these roads must be
atrocious and in certain parts absolutely impassable.?
We may accept it as a matter of course that no improvements can
have taken place lately during the agitation; it is one of the many
duties which will devolve upon our government and we may rest
assured that it will not be a thankless one. Referring to this subject
Zollinger wrote;
?There are undoubtedly very few countries which present such facili-
ties for intercourse, if the authorities would only make good roads and
keep them in repair. Especially the road, running from West to East
of the island and which is the main one, might at little cost of labour
and money be converted into an excellent highway, thus adding very
considerably to the prosperity of the country.
The roads in the Balinese portion of the island are mentioned very
favorably by all travellers. At the beginning of this chapter we intro-
duced a quotation from the ?Tijdschr, v. Ned. Indie 1889? in which
it was remarked that ?all the entrances to the capital were overhung
on either side by tall waringin-trees, which presented such a magnificent
sight, as would scarcely be expected in Lombock.?
? Never have I seen such lovely avenues with such fine wild fig-trees,?
says Zollinger, and elsewhere: ?the road (from Ampenam to Tjakra
Nagara) is good and would even be practicable for carriages, if there
were only a few bridges across the numerous canals which intersect it.?
Van Eck entirely concurs with this opinion and even gives the reason
why the roads are so superior here.
?The more numerous the petty states, the less attention is paid to
facilitating communication with the outer world. Were it otherwise
unwelcome neighbours might look upon it as an invitation to pay


unwished-for visits. The princes of Lombock have no neighbours?
excepting across the sea ?and therefore there are no untimely visits to
be dreaded, and this accounts for the facility of access from one neigh-
bourhood to another only either on foot or on horseback. The most
remarkable of all is the road from Ampenam to the capital Mataram:
it is about 8 pals long and from 50 to 60 feet wide and with its
double row of luxuriaut fig-trees may truthfully be called a ?thing of
beauty?! In the former town of Karang Assim (Tjakra Nagara) the
roads and streets left nothing to be desired.
I cannot ?says a visitor in 1858 ?think of any town in the Dutch
Indies which would bear a favorable comparison with Mataram and
Karang Assim, as regards the number or the width of the roads. The
Street at Mataram.
main road running from West to East through both towns is never
less than from 100 to 120 feet wide; parallel with it are two or three
narrower ones, whilst a goodly number of side roads cut across these
thoroughfares at right angles, thus dividing the town into so many
sections or blocks. It seems a pity that more care is not bestowed on
keeping them all in a better state of repair and that bridges are not
thrown across the innumerable little streams?.
This latter evil has been somewhat remedied of late.
?The roads?, says Dr. Jacob, writing many years later, ?that we
saw during our sojourn in the island were all excellent, they are all
very wide (from 20 to 25 metres) and they are planted with shady
trees. There are bridges across all the rivers and streams, which one
never sees in the independent Balinese states; for instance we passed a


very fine bridge near the prince?s poeri. All along the roads there are
pretty little fountains; if you want to refresh yourself or take a drink
you need only take out the plug and the water streams forth in a
thin jet.
?The roads are lighted by lanterns fastened to bamboo canes and
nlaced on either side at intervals of 20 metres. As the roads are very
ong and straight the effect is magnificent. A street illumination
at Lombock surpasses anything of the kind in our first class
Indian cities!?
For truth?s sake, let us mention the fact that an illumination on this
scale is only seen at certain periods, as on the occasions of religious
festivals.
Whatever may have been the occasions, one fact remains certain and
that is that interest will always centre round the now vanished city the
former residence of the Balinese rajahs, with all its memories of past
and recent grandeur! This is an opportune moment to describe what
was known of the place before the expedition. The houses are of clay;
the better ones arevbuilt in brick and thatched with paddy straw. The
homesteads are surrounded by walls from a quarter to half a metre
thick, and two metres high, if not more. Although these walls may
not be proof against field- and mountain-guns, still the great number of
them and the intricacy of houses and walls present very serious difficulties.
For as soon as you have made a breach in one wall, you find yourself
face to face with another. On the West and East side (presumably also
on the North and South) of the place which runs for 1600 metres
along the high road from Ampenam to Tjakra Nagara, the walls of
all the homesteads adjoin one another, conveying the inpression that
Mataram is entirely surrounded by a circular wall.
Where the wall fails or where it is not high enough, there is a
palissading of bamboo.
There are similar partitions placed right across the entrances to the
town, 200 metres West and 500 metres East of it. Here and there
the palissading and the town wall are provided with ?randjoes ? (cal-
trops) ; the palissading is doubly strong at the actual entrance and all
the spaces are filled in with thorn bushes; the entrances are shut off
by bamboo sliding doors.
About 400 metres from the West border of the town the high road
is traversed by a wall or partition running from North to South, viz.,
from Guning Sari to Pagasangan.
Immediately north of Mataram the S. Djankok crosses the road and
immediately South the S. Antjar. The ground here is � 10 metres
above the water level; the slopes leading to the rivers are very gradual
and are paved with flags.
South of the section traversed by the S. Antjar lies the Sassak dessa
Poenia.
On the northern side of the cross roads we have the residences of
the prince and his legitimate son; that of the prince lies East, that of

his son West. Both dwellings consisting of several separate buildings
are surrounded by walls, which skirt the edges of the cross-roads. The
chief buildings are of brick, the enclosure walls partly of stone and partly
of clay; these walls are about 4 metres high and 8 A of a metre thick.
At the S. W. corner of the prince?s palace and at the S. E. corner
of the crown prince?s, the walls stand back about 15 metres, thus
leaving open squares. These are divided from the road by stone pillars
and wooden palings. Entrance to the palaces is obtained through wooden
doorways in the stone gates. The prince?s palace has an additional gate
on the South side of the circular wall. North and East of the palace
are very extensive kampongs.
Facing the palace of the crown prince and on the South side of the
high road is the residence of the prince?s chief poenggawa, Gusti Njoman
Kaler; this is also surrounded by high walls, which stand back in one
corner, leaving a square like that on the opposite side of the road.
The house in the fourth corner is built on the same lines. West of
the poenggawa?s house and 800 metres south of it, is a house belonging
to the crown prince and standing also between high walls; it is called
?Bogor? and contains apartments for European envoys; an assembly
room and a couple of ponds are found in the grounds. ?
Dr. Jacobs who saw the prince?s palace in 1881 says that ?it is an
old, unsightly place?; at least judging from the outside. The Envoys
of the Hollando-Indian government were not invited to enter the palace.
This privilege had been granted a couple of years before to two private
individuals, Heer van Rijckevorsel and Heer van der Tunk; from these
gentlemen we have not received many particulars about the princely
abode. They were received in the front gallery, which like the apart-
ments for the Envoys at Bogor, was decorated with a few old paintings
and a large number of tiny looking-glasses; the prince, the crown prince
and the priest were seated on chairs, the royal suite sat on the floor
and an endless multitude of people occupied the fore-court. The prince
stammered and stuttered and appeared exceedingly drowsy ?the visits
of Europeans seem always to have this curious effect on the prince?
with nothing intelligent about him; the crown prince looked decidedly
stupid. Excepting of course the princes, the only remarkable thing
noticed by Heer van Rijckevorsel were the gorgeous dishes of embossed
silver and gold on which refreshments were offered.
The apartments at Bogor were evidently very much improved by the
time Dr. Jacobs saw them; at least he gives a more cheerful account
of them:
?Four small buildings, light and spacious, with a front gallery serving
as bedrooms and looking most inviting and clean! The front view
looked on to a large square with four big ponds supplied with running
water; the spaces between the ponds were nearly filled up with shady
raangis-trees, and there were a couple of huts where our luggage was
stored and our servants were lodged. The kitchens, which were beyond
this square, were in very good order. As soon as we had exchanged


our travelling-suits for more comfortable clothes, we, as guests of high
degree, betook ourselves to these attractive-looking ponds beneath the
wealth of foliage and seated ourselves on the edge, each with a fishing
rod, and with true Dutch patience we waited for a fish to bite.
Beautiful fresh water with nice fish in it right in front of one?s door
must ever prove an irresistible temptation for a Dutchman! ?
Although it might be very pleasant to linger a little longer in this-
charming El Dorado, we must go further in order to see the condition
of Mataram.
About 850 metres East of the cross-roads the road is crossed by the
S. Antjar; at this point the river is about 10 metres deep, but fordable-
during the East monsoon. True, there is a bridge over if, about
20 metres wide and supported by a stone pillar in the centre; but it
is in a rather delapidated condition.
The East frontier of Mataram is 900 metres further; here begins a
rice field 600 metres Jong, the field so famous later on, as forming the
place of bivouac for the 7th battalion.
Inside Mataram, 250 metres South of the high road and 40 from the
S. Antjar is a stone powder-magazine and a temple; and 400 metres
South of the prince?s palace there is a prison.
To sum up then, Mataram although not a really fortified town, was
possessed of very great means of defence. To our operations it was
no doubt a very favorable circumstance that the town could be reached
with the 17 c.m. shells fired from the ships lying in the bay of
Ampenam; to do this an accurate knowledge of the position was
indispensable. This was obtained when Dr. Jacob paid this visit to the
prince; at 9 p. m. lieutenant Marinkelle of the navy sent up some-
rockets at Bogor, and the officers who had remained on board the
steamer were able to gauge the position of the place. (The prince must
have understood the meaning of this performance and cannot have been
very edified!)
Although Mataram was the seat of government the prince preferred
living in one of his numerous country seats, and principally at Tjakra
Nagara, only separated from Mataram by the rice plantation we have
just spoken of.
Of ?the poeri that has only lately been built here?, we only hear
that it was very extensive and it took half an hour to walk round the
enclosure walls.
Dr. Jacobs could only see the exterior of the palace, and as dusk
had already set in, he could not form a very distinct opinion of it; he
says: ?it looks a magnificent building, with a very extensive square in
front of it? with which we became only too well acquainted later on?
?The palace and the roads were well lighted, which made a pleasant
impression and with a little bit of imagination one might almost have
fancied one?s self in a European city.?
Meanwhile although we knew that Tjakra was an important town and
that it was laid down on the same plan as Mataram and had a large


market for native produce, still, we are obliged to confess that we were
not so thoroughly acquainted with the extent and the paramount im-
portance of this more modern town, as we were with the condition of
other Lombock towns.
We will only say of the former Karang Assim, that in the war with
Mataram in 1888, it was like the latter, only on the West side, strength-
ened by a row of fortifications, but nothing is left of them now.
Concerning the other country seats, of Lingsar, the favorite abode
of the notorious Anak Agong Made, we know nothing; all we know of
Pringa Rata, where Zollinger spent the night when proceeding to make
the ascent of the Gunong Rindjani, is that it possessed a large deer park.
Narmada, the last palace in course of construction was visited by
Heyligers in 1884, at which period it was not completed; it was built
in shape of an amphitheatre, and there was a temple situated on the
highest of seven terraces, and various small pavilions at different heights
and several fish-ponds.
We have been made acquainted with ?Gunong Sari? ?the mountain
of flowers ?by the visit of Zollinger and later by that of Dr. Jacob.
?The road from Mataram?writes the latter ? was very varied, there
were small dessas and magnificent sawahs. Like all the other roads
through which we had travelled in Lombock this one was wide and
shady. One little bend in the road and we were at our destination.
Never shall I forget the impression that I experienced when this gorgeous
panorama unfolded itself to our view as if by magic; although it would
be beyond my powers to impart that impression to others by a mere
description, still I will try and depict what I saw. We found ourselves
facing a large square, having for background a w T ood lying on the
slope of a hill. On our left was a low hill covered with shrubs and
grass; on our right were numbers of small buildings standing on mounds
and built in Hindu style. In the middle of this open space which was
4000 metres square there were four small artificial lakes, also of a
quadrangular shape and at the four corners were large Hindu images
in good repair; each lake was furnished with water flowing from the
mouth of a monster crocodile. In the middle of these lakes, the largest
of which was 80 metres by 80 and all of which were in perfect order,
there was a beautiful Hindu temple, surrounded by Hindu figures and
fountains. There were similar little temples and kiosks on the tops or
on the slopes of the hills on our left.
?The wood which formed the background to this wonderful panorama,
was peopled by hundreds of deer, which were so tame and unsuspecting
of harm that they peered at us from amongst the trees; they were too
tame to be fired at so we decided to unload our guns and enjoy the
beauties of nature around us.
?After we had all somewhat recovered from our amazement, we went
to inspect the little buildings on our right; these were reached by
ascending from 20 to' 25 high stone steps, or rather these steps led to
an extensive platform on which these little buildings had been erected.


They were mostly kiosks with Hindu figures and fine carvings; in one
of them they brought us refreshments. There was one big building
which attracted my attention particularly, but it was locked, so I presume
it was the prince?s sleeping apartment. The entire frontage of this
kiosk was decorated with frescoes, allegorical pictures from Balinese life.?
We have mentioned in an earlier part of the work how the prince
had disapproved of some of them.
From the height on which we stood we commanded a superb view
of the whole domain; it was as if one had been suddenly transferred
to one of the scenes of the ? Thousand and one nights! ? The famous
?Little Trianon? of Madame de Maintenon may perhaps have boasted
more art and more comfort, but certainly it could not boast more
lovely nature! ?
This ?lovely nature? to which Dr. Jacob refers reminds us that we
have a little to say about the flora and fauna of Lombock; so we will
conclude with it.
Zollinger says that the flora does not differ much from that of Bali
and Java. It is the soil of the South with its steep hills, rocky coasts
and its ever varying formations, which offers the greatest diversity. In
the mountainons districts the flora is much less rich than at Java:
parasitic plants, orchids and ferns are much rarer and are not found
at all on the Rindjani summits. The same thing is noticeable as regards
other plants on corresponding heights. Thus Zollinger found only 20
varieties on the top of the Sangkarean, whereas on the crest of Salak
at Java he found at least 150. On the Ardjuno, 1000 feet higher than
the Sangkarea, he found 30 different kinds of plants. The forests are
also much denser at Java.
?The deeper one penetrates the mountain forests of Lombock?, says
Zollinger, ?the less serried are the trees and progress from one section
to another is not nearly so difficult as in the Javanese forests where the
underwood is so thick.
?The most characteristic feature of the Jungle in Lombock?says
Wallace ?was its thorniness. The shrubs were thorny; the creepers
were thorny; the bamboos even were thorny. Everything grew zig-zag
and jagged, and in an inextricable tangle, so that to get through the
bush Avith gun or net or even spectacles was generally not to be done,
and insect-catching in such localities was out of the question. It was
in such places that the Pittas often lurked, and when shot it became a
matter of some difficulty to secure the bird, and seldom, without a
heavy payment of pricks and scratches and torn clothes, could the prize
be won. The dry volcanic soil and arid climate seem favourable to
the production of such stunted and thorny vegetation, for the natives
assured me that this was nothing to the thorns and prickles of Sumbawa,
whose surface still bears the covering of volcanic ashes thrown out
forty years ago by the terrible eruption of Somboro. ?
?The great palm, called ?Gubbong? by the natives, a species of
Corypha, is the most striking feature of the plain, where it grows by
\\


thousands and appears in three different states: in leaf, in flower and
fruit, or dead. It has a lofty cylindrical stem about a hundred feet
high and two or three feet in diameter; the leaves are large and fan-
shaped, and fall off where the tree flowers, which it does only once in
its life in a huge terminal spike, on which are produced masses of a
smooth round fruit of a green colour and about an inch in diameter.
When these ripen and fall the tree dies, and remains standing a year
or two before it falls. ?
?Troops of monkeys (Macacus cynoraolgus) may often be seen occu-
pying a tree, showering down the fruit in great profusion, chattering
when disturbed, and making an enormous rustling as they scamper off
among the dead palm leaves; while the pigeons have a loud booming
voice more like the roar of a wild beast than the note of a bird. ?
This brings us to Lombock?s Fauna ?Regarding the Fauna ? says
Hollinger, ?it would be more important to mention those which are not
there than those which do inhabit the woods and the hills of the island.
If it is an acknowledged law in the division of plants that the smaller
the islands and the more distant from the mainland, the smaller also
is the number of indigenous plants, we may aptly apply the same law
to the division of the animal kingdom in the islands of the Indian
Archipelago. By reason of their facility of migration birds and fish
form an exception, but to a less great degree than might be expected.
?Sumatra possesses several species of monkeys, Java three, Bali two
and Lombock only one?the common grey monkey. Tigers, panthers,
wild cats and wild dogs are unknown and the rhinoceros and the
elephant are conspicuous by their absence.
?Ruminants are no less numerous than at Java. Stags are very
plentiful, as also kidangs, (roebuck) bantings (wild oxen) and buffaloes
which have become wild.
?Domestic animals abound in the island; tame cats are not very
common; dogs just as ugly and bad-tempered as at Bali; horses ? r
We must say something about the horses at Lombock; they constituted
one of the chief articles of commerce and are still the most irnportan
means of transport. Here, like at Bali, ??pedates? (carts) are unknown
and everything is carried on horseback which is not carried by the
people themselves. We have already heard from Zollinger what large
quantities of rice are carried daily to Ampenam packed up on the
horses backs and Wallace also mentions seeing ?a string of horses
bringing rice? to Ampenam.
To prevent the rice from getting wet when the horses ford the rivers,
it is packed on very high saddles. These pikol-horses laden with 8
pikols (1 pikol =125 lbs.) of rice sometimes cover as many as 20 pals
or more in one day, even on bad roads and across the hills.
These are excellent little animals for military transport 1 And they
are so plentiful too! Heyligers reckons there must be > about 600.000
of them?just as many as there are inhabitants in the island.
They are not beautiful to look at; they are half like the Balinese


horses and half like the Biraa horses; they stand less high but are
broader-chested than the former and their coats are short and smooth
instead of rough; poor things! they do not get much looked after and
they are left out in the meadows both day and night until wanted.
When they are required for riding purposes neither saddle nor reins
are used.
In Zollinger?s time a large trade w T as done in horses by French vessels
which carried them to the Mauritius and the Isle of Bourbon.
The cost price at Lombock varied from 20 frs. to 75 frs. and very
large profits must have been made, for no fewer than 80,000 of these
animals were exported annually. It is more than probable that this
wholesale fashion of selling would have finally exhausted ? the stock!
However, since Lombock?s rajah, who naturally wanted to derive as much
benefit as possible from these transactions, put a tax of 25 frs. on every
horse exported, the trade has been considerably reduced, for which we
are very grateful to his Ex-majesty!
The cattle of Lombock is of the same breed as that of Bali; the
bullocks are used in the plough, but are not quite so numerous as at
Bali, owing to the fact that beef is not eaten in the latter island, while
large quantities of it are consumed in Lombock by the Mohammedan
population. On the other hand, just for the opposite reason, buffaloes
are plentiful and are used principally for ploughing the wet sawahs. As
a matter of course there are not so many pigs at Lombock as at Bali;
goats are to be met with, and as in many other countries they are
generally owned by people less blessed with this world?s goods. But
to possess sheep is a mark of distinction and it is only the prince who
owns any; they are all of foreign origin, chiefly from Sydney.
As regards the feathered tribes, there are thousands of ducks, bred
chiefly on account of the eggs which are salted down; and the number
of these is exceeded by chickens, cocks and hens there are in plenty;
the former, more specially prized as being so much in demand for the
national sport! Besides these domestic birds there are many birds found
on this island which are quite absent from the islands westward and
belonging to the Australian varieties. Small white cockatoos are abun-
dant, and their loud screams, conspicuous white colour and pretty yellow
crests form a very important feature in the landscape; the Megapo-
didae, (or mound-makers) indigenous to Australia and the surrounding
islands are also found here, they are allied to the gallinaceous birds,
but differ from these and from all others in never sitting upon their
eggs, which they bury in sand, earth or rubbish and leave to be hatched
by the heat of the sun or by fermentation; then there are magnificent
kingfishers, beautiful ground thrushes, pretty grass green doves, little
crimson and black flower-peckers, large black cuckoos, metallic king-
crows, golden orioles, and the fine jungle-cocks, from which all our
domestic breeds of poultry originate who would not love to linger
with Wallace, who has given us such a fascinating description?
But it is beyond the scope of our work and we have already enlarged


more than was intended on matters geographical; the interest of the
subjects and the richness of material must serve as our excuse for
digression.
It seems positively incomprehensible that, when the question of the
Lombock Expediton was discussed in the Second Chamber on the 20th
and 21st November 1894, it should have been stated that our know-
ledge of the country aud its people was so limited, as to be deserving
of censure.
From what we have written, it is evident that we were thoroughly
acquainted with the power, the nature, the manners and customs, the
social and religious institutions, the strength, the weapons and the
resources, not only of the enemy we had to tight, but also of the
people we were going to have as allies. We were familiar with the
probable ground of operations, which comparatively speaking presented
no insuperable difficulties, rather the contrary. We knew what the
objects were against which our strength was to be directed, the position,
the construction, the condition, the size of Tjakra Nagara, now a place
of the past!
Would delay have furnished us with any more reliable information?
In former times it might have been feasible to have had our civil
representatives accompanied by staff-officers in civil dress when they
went to pay their visits to the prince, but latterly our relations with
the prince have been too strained and as we have noticed, our envoys
were no longer received at Lombock; and even had they been, what
o J �/
information could they obtain, escorted as they were from the moment
they put foot in Ampenam until they reached their apartments at Bogor
(Mataram) and strictly watched the whole time they were there?
In 1892 captain Granpre Moliere of the General Staff was sent to
Boleleng (Bali) in Lombock waters to try and obtain as much information
as he could, but he was not even allowed to go on shore?how then
was he to set about accomplishing his mission?
There were no Europeans in Lombock upon whom he could rely; the
few who were there had far too many interests in common with the
Rajah, for their information to be of any value. All that he could
learn was from our own officials at Bouleleng and from one or two
Chinese and Malay merchants established there and who came on board
the Java. Of course information received in this manner has to be
taken with reserve and it was far from satisfactory.
So our Colonial Minister was quite correct when he stated that ?we
know exactly as much of Lombock as we could manage to know!?
Can as much be said of some of our earlier expeditions?
It is not our place to reply to this question, so we let it pass
unanswered. We cannot however forbear adding that w r e shall always
consider ourselves fortunate, if in case of future campaigns we are as
well informed about the country and the people whom we have to fight.


IV.
OUR EARLY CONNECTIONS WITH BALI AND LOMBOCK.
Ihe 2nd April 1595 was the all important day when the first Nether-
lands fleet started from the Texel for the East Indies, where the
foundation was laid of that matchless kingdom, which is the most
precious gem in Netherlands, crown.
The origin of our power over Insulinda was very insignificant. Only
tin ee ships, the Mauritius,Hollandia and and a vacht, the
Duyfke, with 250 men in all, formed the first fleet.
Ao less remarkable than the insignificance of the fleet were the
elements which composed it: ?rough and disorderly young men, regular
ne er-do-w ells, as de Jong tells us, ?sons of respectable, rich parents,
wanting less in courage, boldness and strength of mind than in love of
discipline and duty, and whose absence from home was more desirable
than their presence there.?
After two years of hardship and adventure and having lost several of
then icspective crews they reached Bah, where they hoped to find water
and victuals. Here they made permanent friends and during the month
spent in the bay, paid several visits to the island. Aernout Bintgens
of the Hollandia has left an interesting account of his experiences; he
gives many details of the customs, government and produce of the
island, etc.
?On the 9th February 1597, I received orders to go ashore and
towards evening I landed with John the Portuguese (a slave they had
lought at Bantam); I met Manuel Boedenborrich with the Keyloer, who
asked why Pauweles van Caerden never visited the island now as he had
piomised to come again. I informed him that we had understood that
the king was anxious to see other men of our nation, which was the
reason of my visit; this explanation satisfied him.?
The acquaintance was made.... when our friend announced his wish
to have an audience of the king, he was immediately questioned as to
what presents he had brought for His Majesty. Pauweles van Caerden,
besides what he had already given, had promised the king some ?yellow
velvet ; this would account for the disappointment of the Keyloer,
when he saw an empty-handed stranger!


All difficulties were removed when van Caerden offered glass beads,
coral and coins for the king, who would surely be pleased to see
European money; and he promised to send the ?yellow velvet? next
day. The king was ?a short thick-set man, with 200 wives and looked
very simple and good-natured. He took great pleasure in coming on
the beach to see our ship and he liked to hear the guns fired off.? He
used to come in a sort of wooden vehicle, drawn by two white buffaloes;
he drove himself and always carried a long whip in his hand.?
Besides riding in this ?state-carriage,? the king had another fad; he
had collected about ?fifty dwarfs, who from their infancy had their
arms and legs bound fast and these deformities looked like figures on
the hilt of a poniard.? However the king was able
to concentrate his attention on less childish things and
displayed great interest in us Dutchmen and asked
many questions about our country. By the express
desire of H. M. we showed him a globe and a map
of the world, explaining to him the positions of different
countries; to impress the king with the size of our
country, we took the liberty af annexing ?Germany,
Austria, Norway and a slice of Muscovy,? which had
the desired effect of making him feel that his own
little island was not a very important possession.
After a further interchange of courtesies and
presents (amongst the latter, ?an ugly dwarf from the
dug of Bali for king Maurice of Nassau as a token
of friendship?) the ?Hollandia?s? crew took their
leave of this hospitable coast; two remained behind,
Emanuel Roodenburch and Jacob Claes van Delft.
The road to the East Indies was found, the barrier
was broken and competition was open to the entire nation !
We may perhaps condemn the manner in which our
forefathers planted our country?s colours in the East
Indies, but we are bound to admire the gigantic efforts
made in the short period of 17 years to equip 15 ships
and send out men to make treaties, to establish factories
and even attack the proud Spaniards and Portuguese
in their rightful possessions.
f*.-? In 1601 Prince Maurice despatched Heemskerck to Bali with a letter
and presents for the king, who was much flattered; not to be behind-
hand in compliments, H. M. also sends presents and a letter to the Prince.
There was a personal present for Heemskerck, consisting of a beautiful
?Balinese lady.? ?At a loss what to do with her ?not daring to refuse
the gift for fear of offending the king he suggested that she should
have her liberty; the lady herself refused to take advantage of this act
of generosity, so there was nothing to be done, but receive her graciously
and take her home.
The King?s letter to the prince, dated 7 July 1601, gives leave for


||||^
all Dutchmen to trade in Bali like the natives themselves and the King?s
great desire is ?to see Bali and Holland one!? �
Hon delightfully simple of that old Balinese King!
In gratitude, tire envoys said that they would call Bali ?Young
Holland?! J
Like many other things in this world this ?friendship? was not a
lasting one.
Our ancestors were not long in making acquaintance with the sister
island and the report runs:
Prince and Notables of Bali.
?Lombock is East of Bali and on the maps is called Little Java
there is an abundance of rice, which is very cheap; quantities of it are
sent to Bali, only a day?s distance; a good deal of cotton is grown on
the. island, which is ruled by the King of Bali.??This is the King?s
version of the case; as we shall see, others claimed possession of this
country. ??The Javanese do a large trade here in slaves, cotton, cloth
and rice and make large profits.?
For some unaccountable reason the relations between Holland and


Lombock were very unimportant; and matters with Bali were at a standstill.
Efforts were made by Governor-General Hendrik Brouwer in 1688 to
enter into closer connection with Bali. He wanted the king of Bali to
take part in hostilities against the Susuhunan of Mataram, who was
causing endless annoyance to the Bast India Company, notwithstanding
his having been defeated in his two attacks on Batavia.
On the 7th February 1688 the Governor-General wrote to the Directors
of the Gen. East India Company -.
?We have decided to send a special mission to the king of Bali who
is engaged in continual warfare with the Susuhunan of Mataram; it
would be to our advantage to keep the latter busy in his own country,
and with this object in view we propose sending assistance to the King
of Bali in his struggle against our mutual enemy.
?Amongst the many presents to H. M., are a fine Persian horse, some
red cloth, a vat of wine, a gilt chair, two gilt candelabras! A flattering
letter accompanied these gifts, which were gratefully accepted by the King!
Very precise instructions w T ere given to Oosterwijck and the other
envoys, regarding their attitude to the king; the rules of the East India
Company were once more thoroughly explained to them ?they contained
those principles, which insured the rapid progress of the Company and
have not yet lost their value, although the fact is frequently lost sight of.
The Governor-General for some reason best known to himself recalled
Oosterwijck, who was replaced by a military envoy, Jochem Roeloffsen
van Deutecom, who was given the title of ?Commander?:
Finally a third envoy was sent to the King of Bali, the well-known
missionary Justus Heurnius.
?The ?commander? was especially instructed to urge the king in a
friendly way to continue the war against Mataram; the advantages he
would secure in return for this act of friendliness to the Honourable
Company were very great. For one thing they mentioned ?that they
were distressed to hear that the King of Macassar had seized Bima,
belonging to Bali? and that they were ready to assist the King of Bali
against his new enemy.
They did not ask the king for any land for the good services they
rendered, but would be quite satisfied with some of the inhabitants of
the conquered territory,? (they wanted slaves from 15 to 25 years of
age) a yearly subsidy of rice and a few boats. . ...?
How discreet the Honorable Company was in its claims!
Unfortunately all this metaphorical bowing and scraping ended in
failure this time; none of the envoys were ever admitted to the king?s
presence. As a set-off against their generous offerings, the king sent
them: 8 sacks of rice, two oxen, two pigs, two suits of clothes and
3000 pitjis! (small coins).
They tried to discover what the king thought of the proposals
contained in the letter addressed to him ?but they could learn nothing
beyond the fact that he had understood the contents! With this crumb
of comfort they were obliged to go home.


In those days human nature was pretty much what it is now and no
end of abuse was heaped upon H. Brouwer; however in 1639 the king
of Bali applied to the Governor-General for help against the Susu-
hunam, who had invaded his territory. At this date we were trying to
negociate with Mataram, so the reply to the request was somewhat cool.
Matters not progressing as rapidly as we desired with Mataram, we
befriended Bali again; and so things went on. However in 1647 we
were on good terms with Mataram, for in that year, the Susuhunan
bought weapons at Batavia to fight the King of Bali.? Naturally enough
this transaction aroused the anger of the Balinese King, who was our
ally, and it is not surprising that our traders were treated less cordially
and that prices were raised.
? Lombock Notables?.
It is impossible to follow the Honorable Company in all their early
transactions with Bali; it is time to see how we first came into touch
with Lombock or Salamparang, as the island is more generally called.
During the first half of the seventeenth century the power and
brilliancy of Macassar was indisputable; when the Portuguese landed
there in 1512 the natives were very rough, but greatly attached to the
customs of their ancestors. The invaders introduced gunpowder and a
little civilization and after encountering a spirited resistance the followers
of the Great Prophet succeeding in establishing their religion there at


the beginning of the 17th century. Prom that time forth Macassar
spread her power and her religion over the neighbouring countries and
islands, also her industries, chief amongst which was the trade in nails.
Naturally, in addition to the - Portuguese, other commercial nations
were attracted and we see the Dutch, the English and the Danes suc-
cessively trying by fair means and foul to push their trade and make
themselves agreeable to the Court of Macassar, which was clever enough
to turn all these intrigues to its own advantage.
Figures in bamboo representing'deceased
members of a family.
Although reluctantly admitted
by the natives, the fact remains
that Lombock was included in the
possessions of Macassar. We find
in the diary of van Chijs, (Batavia
1640-1641) that on the 30th Oc-
tober, a young man had arrived
from Macassar with the news ?that
the king of that place had gone
with many ships to punish his
rebel subjects at Lombock? and
the news was again corroborated
two days later.
Lombock was not only a bone
of contention between Macassar
and Bali?but the country was in
a state of revolt against its own
ruler and was further exposed to
the piracy of the Sumbawis.
By the treaty of 12th June 1641
concluded between the Plague and
Portugal it was declared ?that
only the Netherlanders and no
Portuguese should frequent the
islands of Bali and Lombock.?
But ?Bima?? on the island of
Sumbawa and Timor were open
to both countries. In spite of
this treaty the ?Company? and
Portugal were doing each other
as much damage as they could and
we were brought into continual
conflict with Macassar; finally w r e were obliged to make peace with
Macassar in 1656, as we were very much harassed by a rising in the
Moluccas. This was the period of Macassar?s greatest glory, when it
actually concluded a treaty with Susuhunan of Mataram! And the
Company?s existence was threatened on all sides. Our forefathers knew
no fear or faltering and in the hour of danger they displayed remark-
able energy and daring.


In 1660 they took the bull by the horns and equipped a powerful
fleet of 33 sail, manned by 2800 stout seamen who were sent- to
Amboyna under pretext of driving the Portuguese away from Timor;
they soon changed their course and steered for Macassar, and in the
bay they found six richly-laden Portuguese vessels at anchor.
These were immediately attacked by the Dutch ships, ?just to give
these Portuguese who had always maligned us to the king of Macassar
as miserable cowards, a little taste of our courage!? Needless to say,
we had the best of it,- not content with beating our enemies at sea,
we succeeded in achieving a triumphant landing and did not lay down
our arms until the Sultan sued for peace.
He was beaten and humiliated but not vanquished! He was deter-
mined to be revenged and henceforward he spared no efforts in
preparing for the decisive fight for supremacy in the East.
It was then that Macassar equipped seven hundred vessels with a
force of 20.000 men and Crawford speaks of this fight as the fiercest
sea-fight of any period in the History of the Indian Archipelago.
Cornelis Speelman, in the employ of the E. S. Company was chosen
to lead our troops; he was a man of rare talent, unusual intelligence
and remarkable perspicacity, combining perseverance and strong will
with bravery and prudence. On the 24th Nov. 1666 he left Batavia
with 13 ships and 500 Dutch and 300 native soldiers and was in
Macassar waters on 19th December; he was supported by many of our
native allied princes, chief amongst whom was Rajah Palacca. Within
a year the citadel of Macassar was taken and re-named ?the fort of
Rotterdam?, and the very advantageous treaty of Bonay was concluded
on the 18th Nov. 1667.
The following year the king made one more attempt to throw off the
hated yoke, with the result that he was again defeated and more strin-
gent clauses were added to the treaty he had ignored.
As in course of our work we shall refer to the agreement concluded
between the king of Macassar and Heer Cornelis Speelman, (ex-governor
of the Coromandel Coast) we will briefly mention the articles it contained:
I. All arms and cannons possessed by the people of Macassar must
be surrendered;
11. all their fortresses must be dismantled;
111. all territory conquered by the East India Company and Allies
during the war, shall remain their property;
IV. all the expenses of the war, assessed at 250.000 rijksdollars (4/8)
must be refunded.
V. as a penalty for the recent breach of the treaty of Bonay a claim
is made for one thousand slaves, ?? young, healthy, and full-grown.
The downfall of the once powerful kingdom of Macassar would
necessarily affect the neighbouring islands, Lombock included. Sumbawa
had taken advantage of our troubles in Macassar to obtain influence
and authority there, but apparently we were on good terms with all
four kingdoms with which Sumbawa was divided; Sumbawa, Bima,


Tambora and Dompo. The friendship on their part was however
assumed and we soon heard that the king of Bima had given leave to our
old enemies the Portuguese to build ?a fine fortress,? which was a breach
of the contract of Bonay ?We had worse enemies to fear than these 1
The people of Macassar were any thing but satisfied with the subjection
of their ruler and they were the immediate cause of disturbances in
different islands. Thousands left their homes, gave themselves up to
piracy and robbery, carrying terror wherever they went, always instiga-
ting the natives to rise up against the hated foreigner.
In a report of 1673 we find that the Macassar pirates were driven
from Bima to Lombock?, but at Sumbawa ?the state?they succeeded
in inciting the Notables to rise against their
king, who at this time was also ruler of
Lombock. A force was sent to assist him
under Jan Branson Holsteijn but did not meet
with success. The Notables refused to listen
to any plan of conciliation; all were agreed
that the king had overstepped all limits and was
guilty of very heinous offences, which they
could not condone.
The Macassar pirates who had fled to Lom-
bock did not continue friends with the king's
rebellious subjects for long and wrote to Jan
Fransen Holsteijn for help to attack ?Salparang?
one of the most important towns of Lombock;
before this however Lombock had been forced
to accept the articles of a treaty with us!
-Peace was not of long duration; and Sin-
grawarangh, one of the chiefs, was the next
cause of anxiety; he informed the Company that
he had no intention of acknowledging the defeated
king as his sovereign and that he had no wish
to receive any of their representatives, or in any
way have any thing to do with them!
Our first expedition to Lombock cannot be
called successful and the prince whom we had
tried to protect was driven away by his rebellious
subjects within twelve months!
Balinese weapons.
11l the register of 1679 we hear for the first time of ?the Balinese
of Lombock?; freed from the oppression and fear of the domineering
Macassar kingdom, the Balinese seem to have taken advantage of the
disturbances in Sumbawa to spread their power over Lombock and later
on over Sumbawa itself. Their work of extension was bound to bring
them into conflict with the Macassar pirates and so they naturally
became our allies. The first serious struggle of the Balinese in Lom-
bock was in 1692.
At this period the four states of Sumbawa were all more or less at


war and the Governor-General considered it expedient to send an
envoy to try and settle matters. Furnished with detailed instructions
Sr. Joannes Junius was despatched to Bima, Dompo, Tambora and Sum-
bawa. Of the 18 questions in dispute amongst these kings, we will
mention one. The Rajah of Tambora complained that a large number
of his subjects were detained at Salaparang against their will; the
Rajah of Sumbawa declared himself to Junius irresponsible for what
occurred beyond the limits of his state.?
ihe other points at issue were all settled, information to this effect
being sent by the Rajah of Sumbawa to Fransen Holsteijn in a rather
amusing letter in which the native prince sends ?his greetings to the
ladies, and winds up laconically with the news that ?the Balinese have
destroyed the village of Salamparang in Lombock? but he does not
know anv details.
The Balinese further threatened to attack Sumbawa and even the
rajah of Boni; in consequence of this information Holsteijn considered
it advisable to hold a council with all the signatories of the treaty of
Bonay; but to take no positive decision before seeing His Highness Aroe
Palakka?rajah of Boni?who was absent at Tenette.?
Francois Holsteijn showed common sense in this; having placed him
on the throne of Boni and allowed his power to increase, it was only
right to watch over him. Besides which he was a very sagacious prince,
as we shall see. A special messenger was hurried after him to tell him
of his perilous situation, the rajah was busy fishing and simply replied
that he would return in a couple of days.?
The -President Holsteijn?went to meet the Prince and explained
more thoroughly the state of affairs, at the same time begging him to
express an opinion as to whether it was wise for ? Sabandar Junius to
remain in the district of Bima and Sumbawa in Macassar until the
threatened trouble was over.?
Ihe Bugis prince was better acquainted with the tactics of our native
allies than we were and remarked: ?the Sumbawis are a people upon
whom you cannot depend and it is their custom to fly to the hills if
they are even slightly defeated in the villages on the coast; the crew of the
?Macassar? would in case of danger have no place of refuge and I think
you had better advise Sabandar Junius to come here; let the Resident
of Bima make the necessary arrangements, but if it comes to a ?rush?
he can retreat to the hills with the Bimese and the Sumbawis.?
E\idently Aroe Palakka had no notion of the dignity of the Honorable
Company?s representative !
?And as regards the destruction of ?Salamparang? His Highness was
unaware that this place was included in the alliance!?
It certainly had been omitted to include Salamparang in the Bonay
treaty which embraced all the other small states that previously belonged
to Macassar.
?If the Balinese go to Lombock as they threaten to do it is the duty
of the allies to help her; but so far, there are only threats which may


not be put into execution and it would entail unnecessary expenditure
upon all to send troops just at present.?
That Rajah lived two centuries too soon! How he would have
delighted the statesmen of the Mother country of to-day!
He further suggested ?that the natives of Bima, Dompo and Tambora
were sufficiently numerous to withstand the attack of the Balinese and
that our Resident at Bima must urge them to assist Sumbawa; as those
poor people are never provided with ammunition, he would send them
some and also with our approval, he would send a representative of his
own to look after things and encourage the Sumbawis! ?
What a generous-minded prince!
We agreed to the proposals he made and Junius was recalled and
six cases of powder and shot were despatched to the Resident of Bima.
The Balinese postponed the execution of their threat until the internal
disturbances of Sumbawa were more general ?thus waiting six years to
carry out their plan. Piracy, disorder, jealousy, strife, all paved the
way for the Macassar refugee, ?Crain Pomelican,? who invaded Sum-
bawa with a band of Balinese followers. ? Crain Jerenika,? another of
Macassar?s deposed kings, had reached Bima and was devastating the
island from that side, in addition to which the whole of Sumbawa was
being dismantled by the banished Rajah of Tambora.
Things were going from bad to worse!
The Rajahs of Goa and Bonn were called upon to fulfil their part of
the compact and to see that their Macassar subjects took no share in
these expeditions.
?Crain Jerenika? paid no heed to the remonstrances and ?Crain
Pomelican ? is in correspondence with the Rajah of Goa, who keeps
him informed of all our plans.
The behaviour of the Rajah of Boni was becoming daily more arrogant.
At this juncture the two chiefs ?Crain Pomelican? and ?Crain Jerenika?
meet at Bima in order to concoct new embroilments for the Company.
Pomelican had reduced the king of Sumbawa to such extremities, that
in self-defence he threw .himself into the arms of Jerenika.
On the 7th August 1700 the king of Bima writes to Governor
General van Outhoorn; ?that Jerenika having been accorded an entry
into Sumbawa worthy of a king, subsequently put all the notables to
death and plundered their houses. He then proceeded to Bima, where
notwithstanding his friendly reception by the people, he destroyed the
village of Tangy by fire; the Bimese dared not oppose him, as the
country was small and the Company were far away. He then visited
Allas, where he joined forces with Pomelican and erected a fortress.
Accompanied by various princes and the king of Dompo he eventually
returned to Bima; they arrived on foot and were accorded a reception
by my people such as I have never witnessed.? During their stay here
they appropriated all the slaves of the princes and notables, they took
2000 horses and all the rice and paddy they could lay hands on and
the inhabitants are in such a state of distress that they have fled eastwards.


A small expedition was fitted out at Macassar and set sail for Bima;
me aim bile Pomelican had been driven from the island and died shortly
after from fever; Jerenica fell into a trap laid for him by the Balinese,,
vho invited him to attend a tournament during which he and several
of his followers were put to death and fortunately for the Honorable-
Company our ally Rajak Palacca who had been growing more and more
unmanageable died at this period. After the signal service rendered by
Bali our friendship became closer, for the time being!
hor the next few years the Honorable Company?s time is occupied in-
quelling disturbances at Boni and Goa and in warding off the attacks
of the Macassar pirates. This is the period of the Javanese wars,
happily terminated however with the favorable treaty concluded Nov. 11th
1748 with the Susuhunam, by which he conceded to us the land run-
ning from Cheribon on the N. East of Java to the strait of Bali.
In the interval the Balinese have made several attacks on Sumbawa
and Salamparang, meeting with more success on the latter island.
We find their rule permanently established in Salamparang about 1740
and the authority is vested in that remarkable man Gusti Wayan Taga,
connected by birth both to the royal dynasty of Bali and Lombock;
l)r. Byvanck gives a graphic description of this prince in the November
number of the ?Gids? 1894:
?Wayan Taga was the precursor of the prince, who after reigning
fifty years has become the enemy of the Netherlands government. He
is characterized by the same firmness and suppleness in his clever, cun-
ning, distrustful policy, taking advantage of and making the most of the
circumstances in which he is placed; he uses alike friend and foe, Hindu,
Mohammedan and Christian to maintain his independence. He had to
deal with Balinese and Sassak, with Dutch and English, exactly as the
king of Lombock of to-day; he manoeuvred amongst them all with so
much cleverness and insight that his name is famous. The prince of
the 18th century and the prince of to-day belong to the same category,
they interpret each other, or rather, without some knowledge of the
former, it would be well-nigh impossible to grasp the peculiarities of
the contemporary History of Lombock.?
As with the Rajah of to-day, our first contact with his ancestor was
friendly. The Hon ble Company had displayed formidable strength, when
their energetic admiral Smout had captured Goa from the usurper
Kraeng Bontolancas (1739) and the following year Wayang Taga humbly
applied to the Governor of Macassar for permission to trade with the
Company and expressed a wish to be one of their dependents.
His request cannot have been serious, for when Smout suggested that
the prince should send a suitable envoy with proper credentials, Gusti
Wayan Taga replied by asking for ?an extravagant amount of mer-
chandise, without offering anything in payment ?. Consequently negotiations-
were postponed and only resumed twenty years later.


During this interval a serious rival had appeared in our waters, and
the Rajah prophesied that we should be driven away but the presence
of the English only served as an impetus to our energy and our trade.
It was however fear of the English which once again brought us into
immediate contact with the Balinese; on the West we defeated the
Madurese and the Balinese then allies and we placed the island of
Madura under our own government; on the East we had to protect the
Sumbawese from renewed attacks of the Balinese and we had to keep
watch over the Sassaks, who already in those days were cruelly treated
by the Balinese.
The Rajah of Lombock was not altogether satisfied with our treat-
ment; he would gladly have availed himself of our services to make
himself independent of Bali, but he did not want only to change masters.
His conduct towards us at this period varies according to his fear or
meed of us in his far-reaching plans. He enters into friendly negocia-
tions with the English and has dealings with the Ceramese, whom the
Hon ble Company describe as ?arrant knaves, bunglers and the scum of
the earth! ?
The Governor of Macassar despatched cruisers to the Lombock waters,
with orders to arrest all persons unable to produce their passes; by
way of retaliating for what he considered an infringement of his rights
the Rajah had forts built at the entrance of all the Lombock harbours,
all the natives are summoned and armed with long spears they guard
the coast and the Company?s representations are not even allowed to
land. The Rajah refuses to hold any further communication with the
?Governor of Macassar and will only treat direct with Batavia.
Matters cannot possibly continue like this; they must either end in
war or in a renewed alliance.
It would have been a well-chosen (1770) time for an attack in force;
the severe rule of Gusti Way an Taga and the exorbitant taxes he was
enforcing were sources of widespread discontent amongst the native
inhabitants who were growing daily more impatient of the intolerable
yoke of the Balinese.
? When they were unable to pay the taxes their wives and children
were sent to Gusti Nurah, King of Bali or to some other place, such
as Bagang; or to a large mountain where people did nothing else all
day long but dig up gold, which was sent in enormous quantities from
Salamparang to Bali every year.
Their greatest grievance of all was: ?that if a Balinese fell in love
with the wife or daughter of a Sassak, he just planted his lance in
front of the house inhabited by the woman, whereupon the Sassak was
expected to go from home, while the Balinese took his pleasure undisturbed.?
Is not this exactly the same complaint we read of in the letter from
the Sassak chiefs in the beginning of this work? How many lamentations
have been heard since then, what sorrow has been endured, what gross
injustice has been done, how many generations have spent their lives in
miserv ?
t i


It was finally decided to send an embassy to Lombock, with consid-
erable presents for Gusti Wayan Saga to propitiate him.
That no very good results were anticipated from the expedition may
be gathered from ?the secret instructions for Alexander Lecerff?, dated
16 May 1771.
He was to offer an alliance of friendship to the Rajah, the chief object
of which was to exclude all other nationalities, especially the English,
from trading with the island. Lecerff must be prepared to meet with
a refusal, as the English had already offered their alliance and therefore
?he was to find out on what spot and at what time a landing could
be effected, and also how far the Company could depend upon assistance
from the discontented natives.?
Finally he was to report upon the produce of Salamparang, the advantages
and cost of an armed expedition, and if after driving away the English, it
would be worth while to attack Salamparang and establish strong posts there.
He was well received; as soon as he reached Tandjong Karang many
people came on board, amongst whom a Sassak chief, who became very
communicative after he had ?a glass of sopy?.
The people were of opinion that the Company were afraid of the
Balinese from whom they accepted presents, but the chief assured Lecerff
that all the inhabitants would stand by the Company if they came to
free them from the tyrant. The harbour was very safe and a good
landing-place should be prepared if they did not come before the end
of July, when the rice fields were dry and the roads would be better
for the artillery; there were kapas and rice enough for two countries
and plenty of sapan wood.
The prince himself was friendly but demurred somewhat when be
heard the conditions of peace and friendship prevented him from
alliances with other nations he could not consent to that part of
the agreement without consulting his feudal lord, the king of Bali! . . . .
It was to this effect that Gusti Wayan Saga expressed himself at a
large gathering of people and in the presence of the Balinese High
Dignitaries; but subsequently, accompanied by one single Sassak chief
he sought Lecerff prior to his departure and told him privately that
?he would much prefer being dependent upon the Company than on
Bali; the Balinese worked nothing but harm there. ?
Lecerff?s mission was not crowned with immediate success; but his
dignified attitude at the large assembly brought-its own reward. He
had boldly declared, ?that the Company would not permit any other
Europeans to trade at Lombock and that if the Sassaks assisted any
others, the Company would not only attack the foreigners but the
'Sassaks themselves as well. ?
For a time no foreign nations were allowed to land at Lombock.
Notwithstanding the high tone still assumed by the Rajah towards the
Governor of Macassar, the Governor General instructed the latter ?to
do all in his power to attach the Rajah of Lombock to us, to the
exclusion of all other European nations.?
12


At the end of 1772 Lecerff is sent on a second mission, provided
with two letters for the Rajah, the one containing compliments and
Greetings, the other containing proposals to the prince to sever himself
entirely from Bali and to ally himself with us.? The latter was only
to be delivered if it could be done without the knowledge of the
Balinese. ?
Lecerff was received with all due honours, but his mission was a
failure, for he was unable to see the Prince alone and hand him the letter.
Van der Yoort, Governor of Macassar now considered every chance of
an alliance at an end.
It is impossible to say what reason prompted the action of the Rajah,
who unexpectedly sent two letters to Lecerff in Sept. 1778, begging
him to ?come at once to Tandjong Karang.?
His reception both by father and son ?Gusti Made Karang Asem ?
was most cordial; they talked a great deal of an alliance between
Salamparang and the Hon ble Company.
?In that case we should feel quite safe. Who would be able to
beat our combined forces, we on land and the Company at sea?
What could be the meaning of Gusti Made?s invitation to Lecerff to
return the following year and accompany him to Karang Asem in Bali?
It seemed incomprehensible, as we wanted to get rid of the Balinese
and were secretly trying to drive them away from Lombock.
No small wonder to find that Van der Woort was angry with Lecerff?s
useless visit to the Rajah to whom he wrote a very clear and explicit
letter, asking for a definite reply and there was to be no more inde-
cision. He placed before him the rough draft of a treaty (9 May 1774)
whereby Salamparang and the Hon ble Company should enter into a
defensive and offensive alliance; Sumbawa should be comprised in the
league; all the Company?s ships should be admitted to the island of
Salamparang for trading purposes, but other nations, even the Ceramese
should be excluded; the people of Lombock were in return to enjoy
certain trading concessions.
Gusti Wayan Saga was far too astute to bind himself by any such
treaty and replied ?that he was not sole master of Salamparang and
could not conclude treaties unknown to the king of Bali ....!?
During all this time both the Rajah and his son keep continually
reminding Lecerff of his promise to go to Bali and conclude a lasting
contract with the king.
Another mission is prepared to go to Karang Assim provided with
the articles for a treaty and presents for the king.
Before however the embassy has time to start, news reaches Macassar
of the unexpected death of the king of Karang Assim followed shortly
after by that of Gusti Wayan Saga (May and July 1775) Gusti Made
Karang Assim succeeds his father on the throne and decides to let his
younger brother, Gusti Kattok govern part of Lombock and establishes
him at Pagasangan.
Gusti Made again begs of Lecerff to come over and accompany him


to Bali, to conclude a triple alliance between Salamparang, Bali and
the Company.
\\ hen after vaiious delays Lecerff does reach Lombock a new surprise
is in store for him; as is so frequently the case amongst the native
tubes, the younger brother, Gusti Kattok, with the assistance of his
uncle Gusti Djilantik, had deposed his elder brother and seized the
throne. It was rather startling to be informed by the new rajah ?that
as his father had followed his inclinations during his lifetime he now
intended to follow his!?
The days preceding the departure for Bali were very anxious ones
for the envoys and they dared not accept Djilanlik?s hospitality for fear
of meeting with the same fate as ?Crain Jerenika.?
ihe Balinese seemed broadly speaking ready to accept the terms of
the proposed treaty; that is to say they were willing to enter into
friendly alliance with the Company, to trade with them and assist them
m cases of shipwreck, but they refused to have a agreement;
the people of Salamparang and Karang Assim consider! a written
contract as null and worthless! ?
Although this mission was far from satisfactory, still it did a certain
amount of good. Had the shrewd, intelligent Gusti Made regained his
influence at Bali?
?My brother, he said to Lecerff when he was leaving?l have taken
much trouble for your sake to day. It is very easy to make a mistake,
but very difficult to remedy one. Rest assured all will come right. You
have obtained a few concessions to day and in time the Company shall
have all they ask. Does it never happen in Europe that immediate
consent is not always given when some one asks for a man?s daughter
in marriage? And even if consent is given the marriage does not
take place at once. Things require time and patience; listen therefore,
ray brother: in the month of February I shall send three ships to
Macassar ?
And sure enough the following year?2o June 1776 ? three vessels
came from the three princes of Salamparang and Karang Assim, bringing
with them a letter in which they stated, ? that they would never go back
from their word and they wished day and night that the lands of the
Honorable Company and theirs might be made one and all the people
happily placed under one rule.?
Besides this they accepted all the terms of the treaty, but
would induce the Balinese to agree to a contract. �
Governor Van der Woort received the embassy with suspicion owing
to the inexplicable attitude of Gusti Made and the Balinese claims on
Sumbawa and last but not least on account of the long list of goods
which the Balinese were desirous of buying in Macassar on credit.
However he sent presents and letters back to the princes, but for the
rest he referred them to the Governor-General; the embassy refused to
listen to this proposal, so that as far as we were concerned no further
steps were taken, although the Balinese considered the contract binding;


unfortunately it was more in word than in deed that they were the
Company?s allies in these difficult times.
Gusti Made?s behaviour continued more enigmatic then ever.
Lecerff about this period informed van der Yoort that Gusti Made
still intended to separate from the Balinese, but owing to his want of
confidence in his (Made?s) Malay secretary he could not enter into
details in a letter. He was anxious to enter into a separate alliance
with the Company on the same terms as the other princes of the Bon ay
treaty and was willing to grant them a slice of territory in Lombock.
On the 28th September 1778 Lecerff writes to Van der Yoort saying
that the island of Salamparang is divided into two factions: Gusti Made
at the head of the Sassaks, and Gusti Kattok at the head of the Bali-
nese. The Sassaks assert that they are treated worse than slaves and
that if only the Company would come to their rescue they are willing
to yield them half the island. Further that if the Company really in-
tended to help them, both Gusti Made and several Sassak chiefs had
said it would only be necessary for the Company to attack the Balinese at
sea and prevent reinforcements from landing, as there were one hundred
Sassaks to every Balinese on the island. Gusti Made begged of Lecerff
to come to Tello Dalem to discuss all the needful preparations verbally.
If only Van der Yoort had taken decisive measures this time.
In reply to this information he told Lecerff that he must find some
pretext for not going to Tello Damo. It was a matter of indifference
to the Company whether Salamparang were divided or not; for them to
reap any benefit from occupying a part of the island would entail
building a fort, for which they were not prepared.
These were dark times for the Company!
Their influence at Celebes was being undermined by all sorts of
intrigues. In the same year that the Balinese embassy had visited
Macassar, a sea-pirate named Sankilang personated the rajah who had
been exiled to Ceylon and placed himself at the head of a rebellion.
The vindictive grandmother of Aroe Palakka, whose great ambition was
to steep her hands once more in European blood, acknowledged the
adventurer as her grandson. His followers increased rapidly; the com-
pany's ports were destroyed; even Goa fell into his hands. .. . the
Netherlands flag flew nowhere but over the citadel of Macassar!
Van der Yoort succeeded however with the assistance of Madurese
auxiliaries in recapturing Goa and in driving Sankilang to the interior,
where he managed to defend himself for twelve years.
Scarcely had the atmosphere of Macassar grown a little less gloomy
before the long-threatened storm burst forth in another quarter. The war of
1781 ?1783 with England so disastrous in every way betrayed to the natives
princes the internal weakness of the once so mighty colonial kingdom.
In those days of trial Karangassim in Bali remained faithful to us
and the prince writes to C. Meurs, Lecerff?s successor: ?Had I wings,
I would fly to your help!? but he was engaged in warfare at home
with Dewa Mangis. He was also deeply offended with the Salamparang


princes, who had permitted English ships to approach their shores.
The behaviour of these princes was very trying: thus they wrote to
the Governor in 1784:
?If your Excellency wishes to end our friendship, we shall be sorry;
but there are other white nations in the world, who would be very
pleased to be our allies ?
Later on dr. C. Meurs asked Reyke, Van der Yoort?s successor:
?What is to be done with these capricious princes?? He had sent
them a letter from the Governor of Macassar, which they refused to
receive, as ?it did not come straight from the Governor.?
In October 1783 Siberg, Governor of East Java wrote to Reyke:
?What is the use of Bali and Salamparang to the Company? The
products of these islands are to be found also in other lands belonging
to the Company. The princes are not to be trusted; it is best to let
them fight out their differences amongst themselves. They will treat
the English as they have treated us and only remain true to the alli-
ance as long as there is any benefit to be derived from it.?
Reyke quite agreed with Siberg and they left the two islands to settle
their own affairs; they kept their eye on Karangassim and used threats
when matters appeared to be reaching a crisis but otherwise, they
only continued to negotiate.
On the 9th May 1188 we learn that the Balinese of Karangassim were
armed along the coast and would not allow the representatives of the
Company to go on shore.
Negotiations still continued and led, strange to say, to unexpected results.
Was it the prospect of the numerous advantages to be gained from
trading with the extensive possessions of the Company; was it the need
of support in their internal wars that prompted the princes of Salam-
parang and Karangassim to seek for a closer union with the company
and caused them to overlook all the previous obstacles. Or was it the
brilliant success which we had achieved at Bima in defeating a Bugis,
who had also impersonated the banished Rajah?
A few months after the subjection of the pseudo rajah of Goa, two
vessels were sent to Batavia with envoys from the princes; they were
the bearers of a friendly letter to the Governor General, who in return
sent many affectionate messages to the Balinese rulers.
Notwithstanding this renewal of friendship and the treaty, the time
was drawing near for the fulfilment of the Rajah of Lombock?s proph-
ecy, ?that we should soon be driven away!? The clouds were drawing
around us and the English attacked us not only here, but they even
bombarded Batavia, destroying Onrust and interrupting our communication
with the mother-country.
The last years of the century witnessed the decline of the East India
Company, the administration of which is taken over by the State to be
overthrown again six years later.
With the advance of time the Balinese princes, instead of displaying
any desire for union with the Company, grow utterly indifferent or


worse; they declared they had always known we were not permanently
established and that there was nothing to guarantee our not failing again.
H. A. van d. Broek, who was sent in 1817 to Bali to renew the
interrupted relations met with very scanty success; one state repeatedly
postponed the date for his reception; a second, having promised to sign
an agreement withheld consent at the last moment; a third stipulated
for a conditional contract to last ? only as long as we were masters of
Java?; ?this was a sufficient indication of the existing feeling ?arid the
state of Bouleleng, the most powerful of all, showed a decided disincli-
nation to have any dealings with us whatever. ?It appears to me,
writes v. d. Broek 5 January, 1818, that the prince of Bouleleng is
very friendly with the English, especially with Raffles ?
In spite of the various changes wrought during the last twenty years
our fear of the English was unallayed; but instead of paralysing our
efforts it urged us to surmount our natural indolence and to enter the
struggle manfully as we did in the previous century! Thus stimulated
by the presence of a powerful rival we adhered to our original plans of
friendly intercourse with the native princes which led to the famous
treaty of Huskus Koopman, so ably commented upon by Dr. Byvanck
in the April number of the Gids 1895.
The Lombock princes held exclusive authority in their own island and
thanks to their fidelity and friendship to our government they had
obtained possession of Karangassim. Feeling themselves firmly established,
no stone was left unturned to prevent the Netherlands government from
interfering in their affairs; circumstances favored them for many years,
as we were engaged in the Atchin war besides, the post at Buiten-
zorg was not occupied by a Merkus!
The Rajah, Ratoe Agong Ketoet Ngoerah Karang Asem, was now
able to devote his exclusive attention to the internal government of the
country, i. e., he was better able to tyrannize over the unfortunate Sassaks.
In 1855 three Hadjis were brutally put to death because, so it was
said, they had incited the people to rebel; and a rumour was current
that a similar fate awaited all the Mohammedan priests. At this an-
nouncement Praja and the other Sassak districts rose in a body, but
were wofully beaten by the more experienced and better disciplined
Balinese. Hundreds of Sassaks lost their lives; all were made to sur-
render their arms, even the chiefs: Balinese officials were appointed to
enforce the order, and the people were forbidden to visit the mosques,
etc. Justice compels us to add that this outburst of brutality was
succeeded by a period of comparative peace and more humane treatment
towards the Sassaks, who were once again permitted to share similar
privileges to the Hindus; the building of mosques was encouraged and
the pilgrims to Mecca were no longer molested; for the time being the
Rajah might be described as a model of toleration. The improvement
was due to the presence of Ma Radja at the palace who had obtained
such a beneficial influence over her husband; her assistant and chief
adviser was the Arab, Said Abdullah. At this time the Rajah was


staunchly supporting ? the Arabian merchants, not only owing to their
influence over his Mohammedan subjects, but because they were neces-
sary to him in his foreign trade.
The jealousy and hatred of the Balinese party, especially that of the
Doenggawas, increased in proportion as they said they were losing their
;:ormer hold over the Sassaks and they formed a conspiracy to put an
end to the new state of affairs. The heir-presumptive to the throne and
the notorious Anak Agong Made took the same view of the case and
as the latter s influence over the Rajah was gaining ground every day,
the period of humane administration drew to a close and was soon
succeeded by the most harsh, oppressive and barbarous measures.
At last in 1891 the independent states of Bali rose and Anak
Agong Made forced the Sassak auxiliaries to cross over to Karangassim
to help the king, then fighting against Mengwi.... This last act of
oppression having ultimately led to our intervention, we must review
the exact conditions existing in Bali.
We had scarcely taken any advantage of the articles laid down after
the first and third expeditions to Bali; we no longer insisted upon the
princes? taking an oath of allegiance to our Indian government; nor that
the choice of a successor should be subject to our approval; neither
were we to receive any war indemnity; and we had not even built
fortresses, as we were entitled to do We had contented ourselves
with having our souvereignty acknowledged,?(this was to keep the
English away) with the promise that the export and import slave trade
should be discontinued and the right of jetsom done away with. ?Jo
ensure a permanent state of affairs? we had thought it advisable to
strengthen the powers of our allies and with this object in view we had
conceded Karangassim to Lombock, while Boeleleng was handed over to
the prince of Bangli and Djembrana was restored to independence. The
results of our arrangements were far from satisfactory and to put an
end to the continual disorders we were forced to place both Djembrana
and Bouleleng under our immediate control, since which time they have
improved in every way, forming striking contrasts to all the other
independent state,
The colonial report gives a very correct account of the progress made
since then, which briefly put is as follows:
In those states under our direct rule slavery is abolished; small-pox
epidemics are less frequent; order and peace prevail; prosperity
increased in proportion as crime decreased; and there is a larger trade
done both in import and export articles.
In the independent states generally, the princes are unacquainted with
the art of governing and give themselves up unreservedly to women,
gambling and opium; the people suffer from poverty and slavery and
are harassed by sickness, intrigues, fighting, war and anarchy; when they
can, they seek refuge in our territories.
In 1885 Giangar united itself to Klonkong, but soon regretted the
?union; part of the state was then incorporated with Bangei, which arrange-


ment roused the jealousy of Karangassim and the Rajah of Lombock,
who desired a portion of the land.
In 1891 Menguri tried to possess himself by force of one portion of
Grangar and called Karangassim to his assistance in this attempt. Gusti
Gede Djilantik and Gusti Gede Poetoe were ready to comply with his
demand at once and ask for further auxiliary troops from Lombock,
whence 500 Sassaks were despatched without delay.
The Dewa of Klonkong refused them a passage through his territory
and they were heavily repulsed in their endeavours to force a way through;
in addition to severe losses in this first struggle the Sassaks were decimated
by lack of proper care and insufficient food.
New reinforcements were demanded from Lombock, but the people
were more than tired of Made?s oppressions and a spirit of rebellion was
rife amongst them; all knew what was in store for the Mohammedans
and Hadjis after the termination of the war in Bali and they accord-
ingly refused to obey the summons to fight their master?s battles, and
Praja gave the first signal for an armed insurrection.
It might have been possible to put down the rebellion at the outset,
but Made?s inhuman conduct caused it to spread from one end of the
island to the other. The Balinese element was again supreme in the
oalace of Mataram and Said Abdullah felt the ground sinking beneath
Ms feet; he entered into secret correspondence with the Sassaks urging
them to maintain their attitude ?but his letters were intercepted and both
he and his two sons were krissed !
The Sassaks succeeded in forcing their way as far as Kediri, where-
upon the Rajah summoned his vassals of Karangassim to his assistance.
Gusti Djilantik crossed over from Bali on Nov. 29th 1891 with an army
of 1500 men and was shortly afterwards followed by others. Made now
laid the whole country to waste with fire and sword; three hundred Sassaks
were transported to an uninhabited island ?Trawangang ?that they might
be starved to death.
Our government was left in the dark concerning this rebellion; but
two years later, after a good deal of hesitation the wretched Sassaks
were to be delivered from their oppressors; an end was to be put to
plunder and murder and to the reign of fierce Macassars, booty-seeking
Sumbawis and proud and cruel Balinese; the day was about to dawn
when this down-trodden people should enjoy their possessions in peace
and reap unmolested the harvest of their beautiful country!
All our efforts to restore peace in Bali were ineffectual; Gusti Gede
Poetoe, absolutely refused to surrender a portion of Giangar to Klonkong,
the people having of their own free will placed themselves under
Karangassim.
The important events about to take place in Lombock forced us to
leave Bali to her own devices for a time; but we hope the time is not
far distant when the much needed reforms will be carried out in the island!


y.
THE LANDING AND OTHER INCIDENTS AT LOMBOCK
UP TO 25th?26th AUGUST.
It is night! The restless Ocean waves beat against the shores of
Lombock as they have done for centuries past and will continue to do
for centuries to come; what tales do they not unfold to us and what
will they not repeat to those who follow us? Dark black shadows stretch
out in long lines above the silvery gray waters; and stars innumerable
adorn the giant masts with their gorgeous midnight rays.
As an eagle with outspread wings so have the Company?s ships come
from the West and swooped down upon Salamparang, the seat of proud
resistance, of cruel oppression, injustice and tyranny! A great andi
powerful fleet rides at anchor in the bay of Ampenam.
What reflections can this imposing sight have engendered in the soul
of that unworthy offspring of princes, that scourge of his country, Anak
Agong Made?
On that night of 5th ?6th July he must have known that the day of
reckoning was at hand and that his reign was about to close!
As dawn pierces through the shades of night, the threatening image
of the black ships vanishes as a shadow in the grey mist; high up ini
the heavens appears a rich red glow spreading itself little by little,,
while the waters reflect the lovely tints and the vessels are soon enveloped
in soft and delicate hues. Suddenly the sun rises above Lombock?s
mountains and the whole scene is lighted up with golden rays; the sea
is a field of silver glistening with golden streaks and wavelets of gold
dash against the shore.
What a buzz of voices and what unusual sounds mingle with the
monotonous roar of the surf! There is the rattle of the gear, the
whistle of the long-boats and the splashing of oars in the water ; and
then there are the jolly-boats closely packed with men all making for
the shore the Netherlands troops are landing at Ampenam!
Early in the morning of sth July the transport fleet entered the
roadstead of Ampenam (the Maetsuijclcer, G.?s Jacob,
Prim Alexander, Amboina, Both, Bead, Coen, Japara, Generaal Pell
and Medan).

Here it joined the naval force appointed for the campaign and
assembled here since 80th June under command of Captain Quispal
SK>f the Navy; it was composed of the frigates
Nederlanden? and ? Tramp?, the ironclad ? Hendrik der ?
all of the auxiliary squadron; the ?Sumatra'? and the ?Borneo? of the
Indian Military Marine and the two despatch boats, numbers 95 and
101, besides the opium cruisers ?Argus? and ? for courier
and escort service.
The ultimatum had been despatched to the Lombock princes; the
time for acceptance expiring at sunrise on the 6th.
Telegraphic messages from H. M. the Queen and IT. M. the Queen-
Regent were read aloud to the troops on board and were greeted with
? Landing at Ampenam?.
loud cheers, followed by gay music from the regimental bands; all were
eagerly looking forward to the morrow and were anxious to begin the
real life of soldiers in action.
Very early, at 4 a. m., next day an embassy from the princes, con-
sisting of three Balinese chiefs, came on board the ? Maetsuijker ?.
?The prescribed time of 24 hours for the acceptance of the ultimatum
was too short; in three days, time the prince would come to Mataram
to discuss with the Resident ?
Every thing was ready and an immediate landing was decided upon.
The men-of-w r ar were ranged in line about 400 metres from the shore
the heavy cannon were directed towards various points of the coast; the


quick-firing guns were prepared to overwhelm the enemy with projectiles
if occasion arose. About fifteen armed marine boats were in position
between the men-of-war and the shore to protect the disembarcation of
the troops. They showed a wide front; between every two sloops of the
marine there was one sloop belonging to the Steam Navigation Company,
each one of these having 4 boats of the transport fleet in tow. The
first contingent to land under General van Ham consists of the 9th
battalion, 2 companies of the 7th, two sections of mountain artillery, the
engineers and two ambulances.
The men fell in line on deck, the boats were lowered, and parties of
i to each f)oat, provided with arms and stores.
At 6,80 a. m. the signal ?forward? was given and they pushed forward
towards the shore. This of course was the most critical moment, the
men were closely crowded together in the boats and defenceless against
an enemy who might have sought to prevent their landing; but fortuna-
tely not a single shot was fired at them and twenty minutes after quitting
the men-of-war the infantry and the engineers landed.
The Lombock flag of which mention has been made, was still flying
defiantly; but without one moments hesitation General Van Ham hurried
in advance of his soldiers to the foot of the flag-staff and amidst a
deafening hurrah, the General?s aide-de-camp, captain Wiersma, lowers
the colours which are never to be hoisted again! The red, white and
blue flag of the Netherlands replaced them for ever.
Without encountering any difficulties the disembarcation was contin-
ued; assistance was even given in drawing the boats higher up on the
beach by the Sassaks, Bugis and Malays assembled there. By 7,80 a. m.
two other companies of the 7th and 6th battalions were landed, and the
disembarcation of the cavalry was commenced. By the afternoon all the
troops and coolies were on shore and steady progress was made in landing
supplies and war material. Position was immediately taken up on the
North, South and East of Ampenara and at about 3 p. m. scouting
parties were sent out in three different directions. One company
marched nearly as far as Rembega; a second followed the road from
Ampenam to Mataram, coming within 800 metres of it, whilst a third
covered about 1500 metres along the road to Tandjong Karang.
The reports of the roads and surrounding districts were good; the
enemy was invisible; the people in the kampongs seemed quiet enough
and there were no signs of anything unusual about the place; wherever
the troops showed themselves the natives squatted down on the ground
and the Chinese continued to walk about unconcerned beneath the shade
of their paper ?pajongs? (umbrellas).
Is it to this external attitude of peace and order that Ave are to
ascribe the choice of Ampenam as a bivouac? is this the reason why
no fortifications were built? does herein lie the cause for no clearings
being made where the view was obstructed or the line of fire
impeded ?
Surely, the situation cannot have altered so materially since the last


few hours, when uncertainty existed as to what difficulties might have
to be faced on landing, as to make it conceivable that no attack was
to be feared. The inhabitants of Ampenam and the surrounding kam-
pongs might possibly he well-disposed although we have many
instances in the history of Indian wars, where an apparently well-
intentioned people have been suddenly transformed into our bitterest
foe. Was it not possible that the cunning Balinese might permit us to
land unmolested and then attack us unexpectedly? Our
not yet conquered and it was natural to foresee that Anak Agong Made
would make some desperate attempt to escape the fate in store for him.
The Commander-in-chief proved that he was prepared for such like
emergencies by the precautions he took when he marched towards
Mataram on 11th July.
In our opinion it would have been wiser to have fortiful the strand
bivouac, to ensure perfect safety for the troops stationed there and to
form a secure basis for the advancing columns. Had this been done the
men would have enjoyed more undisturbed rest during the first few nights;
the subsequent panic would have been prevented; and there would have
been more available help at hand to relieve the attacked divisions.*
The number of vacant houses and homesteads at Ampenam provided
ample accomodation, and the men speedily set to work cleaning them
and preparing them; but nothing was done to clear away the high
walls, which made it so difficult to lead the troops and see any distance
ahead. Meanwhile a rumour was current that Anak Agong Made
intended to attack the bivouac during the night with 500 of his
adherents, as he preferred to die fighting rather than surrender.
Suddenly at three in the morning the ? alarm ? was sounded! Tire
had broken out in the Chinese camp and the bamboo houses crackled
as if hundreds of guns were being let off and the sky was ablaze with
the sparks. It is horrible to think what might have been the results
of this out-break amidst the densely packed crowd of men, horses,
ammunition and stores, with the enemy probably lurking in the distance,
to take advantage of the confusion to strike the first blow!
An hour of intense anxiety was spent in trying to extinguish the
flames and by day-break all was quiet again; two Balinese who .were
suspected of this act of treachery were arrested.
A Balinese embassy had spent the night in the bivouac, having
arrived during the afternoon with a message from the prince to the
commander-in-chief, informing him that the arrival of the troops on
shore was creating much consternation amongst the people and therefore
* To those who feel inclined to argue that it is easy to put forth these reasons after the
events have occurred or who may conclude that no one foresaw the danger at the time, we
wish to point ont that our contention is not that we should have acted more prudently if
similarly situated, hut that criticism of a mistake may prevent its recurrence in future;
regarding the second remark we know positively, that some of the officers were thoroughly
aware of the dangerous position of the bivouac before the attack took place, as they
mentioned the fact in their private correspondence, although of course unwilling to comment
upon it publicly.


" " ?^????????????,, ?? - ? ?? ?

he begged of them to return on board, where further negotiations could
be carried on.
The time for negotiating had elapsed and the envoys were forced to
depart on the morning of the 7th with the following reply:
?In future only the Prince himself would be received by the Com-
mander-in-chief, letters from him would have to be delivered to the
outposts; and in the evening or at night time not even the prince
himself would be allowed in the bivouac.?
The remainder of the day was occupied in landing the horses, artillery
ammunition and commissariat stores; it required almost superhuman
efforts to keep the heavily-laden boats steady and bring them safely to
the beach through the heavy surf and hundreds were kept busy in
conveying the chests and bales from the strand to the store-houses.
? Unloading supplies.?
In the uncertainty as to future emergencies the Commander-in-chief
decided not to advance without having a sufficient supply of stores at
Ampenam; they were to take with them provisions enough to last for
a few days consecutive operations and as this involved the coolies
following the columns, only a few could be left behind at Ampenam
and every thing must be done before they started. This was an
excellent arrangement and proves conclusively that the Commander-in-
chief was prepared for resistance.
In the course of the day information was brought in that Made was
planning an attack for that night, so at dusk all the troops were ordered


back into the bivouac.... was not this a mistake ? Had an attack
really occurred, a terrible catastrophe might have ensued.
At 6a.m. on the Bth July a large reconnoitring force set out under
Major van Bijlevelt, with controller Liefrinck, the 6th Battalion, the
cavalry and one section of mountain artillery and the ambulance; they
followed the route from Ampenam ?Tandjong Karang-Sekarbela ? to
Pasinggakan. At his own request General van Ham accompanied this
column.
This was the occasion on which the remarkable meeting took place
between Gusti Gede Hjilantik (prince of Karangassim in Bali) and the
Commander-in-chief and which decided the fate of the campaign; the
former declaring that it was accidental on his part. He informed
General Van Ham that he was on his way to apologize to the Resident
for the neglect of the government of Karangassim in not having
acknowledged our notification concerning the Expedition. We can hardly
credit the accuracy of the prince?s statement; it is more than probable
that he gauged the results of the expediton and he wanted to separate
himself from the Balinese party while there was yet time; he wanted
to enter into private arrangements for his own ultimate good!
And who can feel sure of the chances of war? In former years
Salamparang had been subject to the kings of Bali until the Company
had inverted the order of things and who could tell what the Company
might not do so again? The present occupier of the throne of Salam-
oarang was a worn out old man and his successor half an idiot ?or at-
east he made them out such! Would he not be a more suitable ruler,
himself? would he not be a safer guarantee for the maintenance of
order and discipline?
If he could only succeed in this well, ?then the Company were
welcome to Karangassim as a present; it was really a poor country, rich
only in stones ? (These are Hjilantik?s own words).
?He saw the time was not far distant when his country and the
other independent states in Bali, would be united under the Company,,
just as Boeleleng and Hjembrana, where so much progress had been made.?
We cannot fail to recognize in this sly and clever Balinese a true
descendant of Gusti Wayan Saga!
The meeting was most cordial, for we too appreciated the advantages
to be derived from a private interview and hoped through the inter-
vention of Hjilantik to achieve our object peaceably and to surmount the
opposition of the Salamparang princes. The Commander-in-chief?s charm
of manner and frankness quite captivated Gusti Dijlantik, who promised-
to come and pay him his respects very soon; true to his word the
prince arrived the following morning (9 July) at half past ten. He
assured the General of his fidelity to the Government and declared his
wish to separate himself from the Salamparang princes and to return
to his own country, unless the Commander-in-chief might wish to dispose
of him and his 1200 men. It w r as decided that he himself should stay,
but that a government steamer should convey his troops back to Bali;.


this latter part of the programme was however altered and it was settled
that the men should stay too until the island was definitely reduced
to order.
After his visit to the Commander-in-chief Gusti Djilantik went straight
to the old Rajah and to Made at Tjakra Nagara, relating all that had
passed and laying great stress on our power. ? Resistance is impossible
and you may as well comply at once with the demands set forth! ?
The following morning, 10th July, the General received a letter from
the old Rajah, in which he accepted all the terms of the ultimatum,
but raised obstacles regarding the surrender of Made, which would cause
all his followers to rise against him (the Rajah), and suggesting that
when quiet had been restored to the country enquiries should be made
into his conduct. The Commander-in-chief replied that if Made were
not surrendered the troops would advance the next day, ?if the Rajah
were really afraid of Made?s men, let him place himself under the pro-
tection of the Commander-in-chief who would defend him against them.
Early on the morning of the 11th July the whole army advanced,
while a naval brigade occupied Ampenan. Two battalions with eight
guns were in the first line, one battalion with the cavalry in reserve.
This curious disposition of the cavalry was made, owing to the road
and surrounding country being quite open and Mataram, the object of
the advance, being visible to the whole column; besides an attack in
the open field was not probable.
. Two 12 c. M. A. siege-guns also accompanied the column which
could come into action on the high road if occasion arose; the wide
easy road offered no difficulty for the heavy pieces drawn by 40 coolies.
The forward march had hardly begun when a letter was handed to
the Commander-in-chief stating that the princes accepted the final
proposal, but that they would themselves exile Made to Tjoelik or
Tjanjar in Bali, but that if he showed himself unwilling to go, the only
alternative would be ?to kris himself.? The bearers of the letter further
informed the Commander-in-chief in the name of the princes, that since
the letter had been written, Made had krissed himself and they implored
of him not to advance any further, but to despatch a commission to
identify the dead body. The order to ?halt? was immediately given,
and controller Lief rink, with two Bouleleng punggawas attached to our
cause and who had known Made personally, were sent forward to verify
this astounding statement. On their arrival at the poeri at Tjakra
Nagara, they were not admitted at once, but after a quarter of an hour
had elapsed Liefrinck sent for Djilantik with the request that the commission
might be admitted to identify the corpse. Djilantik vanished and
remained absent some little time and at last Liefrinck was obliged to
send another message saying they could wait no longer, but would
return and make their report to the Commander-in-chief. Djilantik
olaced his hand on his kris and begged of them to wait one moment
..onger
He left them again, but returned in a couple of minutes, in order to


accompany the commission to view the corpse.... and when they
entered they were still in time to see Made breathing his last gasp!...
V
High Eoad from Ampenan to Mataram on 11th July.
Shall we ever know the truth about this prince?s death? Had he taken
his own life? or had he been put do death by the prince?s orders to


expiate an offence lie had committed with his own sister?s daughter?
Strange that such a charge should be brought by him against this man
whom he was seeking to protect, yet we know it was a usual way of
getting rid of people. Nobody but Djilantik knows the real fact of the case.
When the controller returned to the column his report was.- ?when the
news of Made?s death was brought to us, it was not true, but it is true now! ?
All then changed as if by magic; the order to advance was no longer
a war cry and the troops marched forward in a friendly country. They
proceeded to Tjakra Nagara accompanied by gay music and there they
were welcomed by Gusti Djilantik; who can say what thoughts filled
his mind, as leaning heavily against a tree, he watched the troops
march past to the sounds of a full band? why did he inspect them
with such piercing eyes?
And did not the heart of many a thoughtful soldier beat faster as
he marched between those high walls? Did it not occur to each one
how great would have been the number of victims, had it not been for
this fortunate solution of the problem?
Just then a sort of big fair was being held at Mataram and was
visited by thousands of women; no one showed any signs of fear and
we are justified in assuming that at that time there certainly was no
thought of hostilities.
Halt was made at the cross roads in front of the poeri.,.. the corpse
of Made and that of one of his concubines were at that moment being
brought into the court yard of the poeri; later in the afternoon the former
was carried to Arapenarn by a few of his followers and cast into the sea.
Greater outrage could not have been committed on the body of a Bali-
nese, for this last indignity placed him on the level of a criminal and
robbed him of all chance of ever reaching heaven; yet it was perpe-
trated by the express command of the old Rajah, who informed the
Commander-in-chief that a man who had wrought so much harm to his
country was unworthy of honorable burial.
We look upon this prince as somewhat of a hypocrite?the atrocities
were committed with his knowledge and sanction and he himself was
responsible for all the calamities existing in the island, but now that he
saw his throne threatened by the Company?s soldiers, one of his first
acts was to disown his best beloved friend!
Sic transit gloria!
Standing in front of the poeri, the Commander-in-chief decided upon
the following disposition of the troops;
The 6th battalion with the ammunition train, the ambulance and the
two sections of mountain artillery were to remain at Tjakra Nagara; the
7th battalion with its ammunition train, the ambulance and the two
sections of field artillery to bivouac in the Sawah between Mataram and
Tjakra Nagara. The 9th battalion to return to Ampenam with the
cavalry; and the naval brigade to re-embark.

entrusted by General Vetter with the selection of a suitable spot for
the 6th battalion to bivouac and Lieutenant Lotting, adjutant to the
Commander-in-chief was to assist Major van Blommenstein in establishing
the sawah-bivouac for the 7th battalion.
The question arises why these duties were not performed by the
officers of the general staff to whose sphere they belonged?
Captain Wiersma followed the high road for about 1200 metres, to a
point where it takes a southerly bend for 200 metres, then continues
straight east ?this is the turning where afterwards van Lawick?s column
fell into an ambush. Unacquainted with the actual extent of Tjakra
Nagara, Captain Wiersma thought he would never reach the end of that

interminable road running between high walls, so he returned and made
his report to the Commander-in-chief, who thereupon selected for the
bivouac a piece of land lying back South of the poeri.
I his tract consisted?see sketch?of an open space lying mostly in
Westerly direction which was skirted by ground raised 1 metre higher
and which was surrounded by a wall breast-high; adjoining this were
two open spaces, the actual Dewa temple, encircled by very high
(4 metres) walls, but these spaces were not included in the bivouac;
all these open places were 40 metres square on an average. The Ist,
2nd and 4th Companies were lodged within the low walls; the others,
as also the horses and mules in the open space on the north. The
convicts, kitchens and other conveniences were on the opposite side in
sheds against the high wall of the poeri garden.
Although the commandant was not quite satisfied with the disposition
of the bivouac of the 7th battalion, there was no more suitable spot.
As is shown in the sketch it forms a triangle, one side is parallel
with the main road from Mataram to Tjakra Nagara, on the north side
is a sparsely planted cocoa-nut-tree plantation and the east side faces
a large stretch of rice fields.
The 9th battalion was stationed at the bivouac on the strand at Ampenarn.
Gusti Djilantik placed his own poeri at the disposal of the Commander-
in-chief and his staff; it was situated in the North West angle of the
cross roads at Tjakra Nagara and separated from the old Rajah?s by
the road to Lingsar, The residence consisted of four divisions, adjoining
one another and behind it was a large garden containing a pond.
Djilantik retired to a small house in the neighbourhood, ?that he might
be at hand if required;? he gave every assistance he could in preparing
the site for the bivouac and thanks to his intervention large supplies
of bamboo, padi, straw, etc., were brought in by the inhabitants who
only accepted very trifling payment.
This leads to the very important and intricate question of the choice
of these bivouacs, a choice which exercised such a fatal influence on
subsequent events and which has been so severely censured on the one
hand and so stoutly defended on the other.
In forming an opinion we must bear in mind that the acceptance of
the ultimatum, the death of Made and the occupation of Mataram and
Tjakra without a single blow led one to understand that the trouble
was over and circumstances had altered since the bivouac at Ampenarn
had been planned and there was now no anticipation of an assault. We
consider that the main object of the Commander-in-chief in locating his
troops in and near Tjakra Nagara instead of in safer quarters at
Ampenarn has been entirely overlooked; true, the distance from one
place to the other was not great, but it might not have proved so easy
to re-enter the gates a second time, as was found out by later experience
and not much time would be needed to place Tjakra in a thorough
state of defence had the Balinese been so minded at the time.


Not merely from a military but from a political point of view, it
was essential at this stage of affairs for the Commander-in-chief to
remain as near the centre of Lombock as possible until the actual
object of the expedition was achieved. Mataram and Tjakra Nagara were
the points where it was possible to keep in touch with prince and
people; these strongholds once in our power, it was clearly our duty
to occupy them. Unfortunately the disposition of the troops was
such, that they are completely at the mercy of the people they have
come to subjugate. ?A good tactical commanding site was lacking at
Mataram and at Tjakra Nagara;? while admitting that this statement
may be correct, we are at a loss to understand why at least ?a safe
site? was not selected, instead of one exposed to an attack from the
people on whom we were going to impose conditions.
A ?safe? position can generally be secured by encamping on the
border of a kampong which affords a good open space in front while
the troops are screened and the sides of the kampong can easily be
strengthened by earthworks, etc.
In this instance the bivouacs might have been established in some of
the homesteads surrounded by high walls and after a little clearance,
the site would have been safe from the enemy?s fire and attacks.
We entirely disagree with those who contend that this latter course
would have embittered the people against us and would consequently
have been opposed to the ? Instructions ? of the Commander-in-chief,
or that we had no ?right,? to follow such a line of action! What
about European methods in Europe? Did Germany hesitate to adopt
a similar course in France? No voice has ever been raised in opposition
to such tactics, without which occupation would be impossible. And
we do not think that such a proceeding would either have astonished
or embittered the natives who were accustomed to see the princes and
notables appropriate what they required; besides, with our superior
notions of justice, it would have been very simple to compensate the
people for turning them out of their houses, and many would have
been grateful to receive a few shining rijksdollars in exchange for their
little bamboo houses.
Still from a political standpoint the selection of a site on the borders
would have been less advantageous, though owing to the extent of
Tjakra there could be so little question of influence and contact that
the troops with the Commander-in-chief might just as well have remained
at Arapenam.
There was still one course left open: to take up a position inside the
poeri or in front of it. Some may think it would have been an unwise
choice in view of the labyrinth of dwellings, passages, walls, etc., which
would have rendered supervision of the men almost impossible ?to
this we reply that there were many open spaces and sites in the eastern
portion and an abundant supply of water.
This selection might have ? embittered the prince! ? Possibly. But
even such a contingency would not have weighed with the Commander-


in-chief, had he considered the locality suitable for his purpose. We
are convinced that such a proceeding at that time would have had no
baneful results whatever; the prince was far too much in awe of us
and only wanted to be left in peace; besides, had he not through
Djilantik placed all his palaces and their contents at our disposal, as well
as this eastern portion of the poeri.
We have however seen how the site of the bivouac was decided
upon; in the beginning the locality was unknown and later on it could
not well be changed. The Commander-in-chief chose the ground
of the poeii; the choice was commendable, had the protected portion
been utilized but instead of that, the most unsheltered part of the site
surrounded only by a low wall, was fixed upon for the bivouac. Senti-
mental considerations prevented the sites surrounded by the high walls
being tinned to account, as they had been the prince's places of prayer
and sacrifice. In any case all such feelings should have been laid aside
when information of the attack reached us.
finally the 7th battalion, which would have been better off in every
way by bivouacking in the poeri was placed in the sawah between
Ijakra and Mataiam, whereas, being intended to keep up communica-
tions between the strand bivouac and Tjakra, it would have been more
advantageously situated either to the East of Mataram or West of
Tjakia, instead of between these two points; this would have made all
the difference as to safety and very little as to distance. There were
too few troops considering the long line of communication and the pecu-
liar position of the points to be held. Had one or other of the places
whic i we suggest been selected and had the troops been amply provided
with ammunition, food and drinking water, which was wanting at Tjakra
they would have been protected from a sudden onslaught and would
have been enabled to await events; they could have held out until help
reached them or at least until they decided to force their way through
the enemy and they would not have been so hampered with such a
long train of wounded.
On the evening of the 11th July the two Generals and the Resident
paid the old prince a visit at his poeri at Tjakra; it was a mere for-
mality, as the Rajah appeared much too stupid and deaf to bear the
stiain of conversation. His deafness was real, but we are inclined to
think that the illness and stupidity were assumed; for at the meetings
convened during Lindgreen?s imprisonment he showed great intelligence,
as we shall see and at the time of his own incarceration he had quite
recovered his health and his mental faculties were in no way weakened.
Was Djilantik behind the scenes? As it was evident that the Rajah
Aias unfit to tiansact business, a messenger was sent the following day
12th July?to inform the successor to the throne, Anak Agong K?Toet,
residing at Kota-Radja, that we were in occupation at Tjakra Nagara
(This can haidly have been news!) and requested his presence as soon
as possible, in order to discuss future plans. Eour days later the crown


Drince arrived and accompanied by Djilantik he came at once to pay
iis respects to the Commander-in-chief.
To do honour to the crown prince the 4 companies were drawn up
?en haie?, and went through numerous manual exercises; Djilantik was
or pretended to be delighted with the performance and repeatedly
expressed admiration at the men?s skill. (Were they trying to hypnotize
KToet?!)
The same evening the officers of the 7th battalion were commanded
to accompany the Commander-in-chief to Mataram to return the prince?s
visit. ?An escort had been sent to Tjakra to accompany the Comman-
der-in-chief from headquarters to the prince?s palace and they started
in the following order. The procession w r as headed by a Balinese
notable with a couple of lancers, followed by the bodyguard walking
four abreast at a considerable distance apart from one another; these
all wore caps with silver bands and carried Winchester repeating rifles
over their shoulders, their legs were bare to above the knees and their
faces betrayed consciousness of their great dignity. This body of forty
men in green jackets was followed by fifty lancers in green jackets
marching in the same order and then came the prince?s gamelang; our
band close upon this one was delighting its hearers with the strains of
?Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ah.? Walking behind this gay music is a very stately
notable, carrying a magnificient costly kris, and immediately after him
are General Vetter and General van Ham, on the right the Resident,
on the left Gusti Djilantik. The officers bring up the rear and are
surrounded by crowds of Balinese and Sassaks.
On their arrival at the palace at Mataram Anak Agong k?Toet came
out to receive his guests; he took Generaal Vetter?s arm and led him
through the narrow little entrance door and then through a second one,
both so narrow that it was necessary to pass through in single file, the
passage was between high Avails and still in the open air, until at last
Ave reached a thatched shed and found a table and eight chairs. About
fifty different kinds of refreshments were handed round in richly em-
bossed gold and silver dishes, and this would really point to the con-
clusion that the crown prince was desirous of doing his best. .. .?
On the IBth July a council was held at headquarters, at which Gusti
Djilantik was present and from the colonial report on events in Lombock,
we find ?that the successor to the throne had been kept completely in
the dark by his brother Anak Agong Made, concerning current events
in the island; that the acceptance of the ultimatum by the old Rajah
Avas brought about by Gusti Djilantik, Avhile Anak Agong k?Toet was
absent at Kota Radja. It became therefore necessary to acquaint the
crown prince with the contents of the ultimatum, whereupon he solemnly
declared that he too accepted the articles contained in it and would
comply Avith our demands ?.. . . Anak Agong k?Toet impressed one as
having no distinctly developed individuality of his own.?
We have further evidence of this latter statement. Tor instance he
trembled with fear and nervousness, when, on leaving the headquarters


on the arm of the General, he discovered the infantry going through
their manual exercises on the high road and during the council big
drops of perspiration dropped from his forehead. And yet... . the
prince was certainly no coward, which he proved, when instead of taking
:iight like his relatives, he sought an honorable death from our bullets
? such as is required by the Adat and the honour of a Rajah! ?
It is impossible to follow the daily course of events; the troops are
able to rest during these days of political discussion, concerning the
best method of redressing grievances and introducing peace between
Sassak and Balinese.
A depot of provisions was established at Ampenam and a similar one
with a four days? food supply at Mataram, intended for the troops of
the 7th battalion stationed there and for the bivouac at Tjakra Nagara,
which sent out a foraging detachment daily. This was first done under
cover of an escort, but latterly the escort was abandoned and one non-
commissioned officer accompanied the carts. There seemed no further
cause for fear; the natives moved about amongst the soldiers as if
nothing were the matter; the markets were visited regularly and the
vendors even brought their wares inside the bivouac, as the soldiers
were not allowed to leave them. Both in their walks and in their
rides, which they pushed further day by day, the officers met with
universal courtesy; the Balinese women soon lost their shyness and at
night time the notorious panjoerans no longer hesitated to w r ander about
in the neighbourhood of the bivouacs.
Every day the Rajah sent presents of fruit, kwee-kwee (cakes) etc.,
to the Commander-in-chief.
The attitude of the inhabitants, from the highest to the lowest, denoted
a desire for peace and friendship and it is easy to understand that under
such gratifying circumstances no one should have harboured thoughts of
a rough and cruel termination to this happy state of affairs.
In fact the Government considered it safe to re-ship the heavy guns
to Surabaya and to re-call the observation-corps from Bouleleng to Java.
Having achieved such a brilliant success by the fear and dread of
our arms, if not by the use of them, let us return to our political
negociations. The Commander-in-chief was in a dilemma!
?If the policy of the Indian Government, ? says the Colonial Adviser,
to which we have so often referred, ?had from the beginning been
directed to keeping the treatment the Civil Government in its hands, it
must of necessity have depended on the result of the Expedition, what
course of conduct w r as to be pursued in regard to the regulation of
internal affairs towards the princely house of Bali. The unexpected and
immediate submission of the Government deprived them of any occasion
for departing from the policy determined on in dealing with that
Government. ?
There is no fault to find with this way of reasoning, but the question
as to whether it was sound policy or not still remains open.


Those who have followed us thus far, know:
How great the difference between the two races was in origin, dispo-
sition, nature, language, religion, morals, and customs;
How during the last half century the original inhabitants have been
trodden down by the Balinese; how repeatedly the Sassaks have attempted
unsuccessfully to thrown off the oppressor?s yoke;
How this oppression had of late years reached the climax by (we will
quote the exact words of the colonial report) ? the extortionate and
arbitrary taxation; the heavy feudal duties; the application of the so
called tjampoet and mandjing; (disposal of wife and daughters and
property of men dying without male issue), the enforced surrender to
the prince of all twin children of the same sex; the prohibition of
marriages between Sassak men and Balinese women, although the reverse
was allowed; the contributions for the numerous banquets the prince
was accustomed to give; the restriction on the chiefs not to leave their
districts under penally of death; the arbitrary power over life and death
in the absence of a verdict by the judges; the grinding taxes ?
How these miserable people rose once again, and, full of hatred
against the name of Balinese, swore never to submit any more to the
princely rule of Bali;
How they implored of us, both by letters and embassies, to go to
their assistance;
How we hesitated and delayed;
How in despair the Sassaks fought themselves free, in so far at least,
that no Balinese dared raise his voice in Sassak territory; and finally
how the Sassaks had in consequence been subject to no authority
whatever for two years.
The instructions of the Commander-in-chief were to bring together
these two opposing elements.
So much has been said and written regarding these instructions that
we give them here in full:
Art. I. The object of the Expedition is to force the Lombock Government
to comply with the demands made by the Netherlands Indian Government
through the Commander-in-chief. (Pages 24 and 43.)
Art. 11. After the arrival of the Expeditionary force in Lomlock waters,
the Commander-in-chief shall, before disembarking his troops, notify the
prince?s government in writing of the conditions contained in article I, and
at same time inform him, that, as the prince?s government has failed
to satisfy the demands put forth by the Resident of Bali and Lombock in
the name of H. E. the Gov.-Gen. of the Dutch Indies, His Excellency has
decided to put his threat into execution and to terminate by foi ce of arms the
deplorable condition of the country; that, before actually having recourse to
armed force, His Excellency desires to give the princes a last opportunity to
submit to the Government of their own free will, that if they choose to take
advantage of this opportunity, they must accede to the demands in full within
a very short space of time?to be defined by the Commander-in-chief;
that if at the expiration of the allotted time a satisfactory reply has not
been received, hostilities are to begin at once;


and lastly, if all the articles and conditions are agreed to, no hostilities
will take place, hut the troops will land and remain on shore until all claims
aie satisfied, or where this is impossible, until such guarantees shall be given
as will ensure their fulfilment. �
Ait. 11l- Every precaution must be taken while landing the troops and
during further operations that no damage be done to the harbour of Ampenam;
Art. IV. In case of Europeans being found at Ampenam, every effort must
be made to induce them to go on board our steamers before operations begin;*
Art. V. The object of the eventual operations is to seize Mataram and to
occupy both the town and neighbouring forts;
Art. AI. The Commander-in-chief must take the necessary measures to
protect that part of the population who are taking no share in the hostilities.
Moreover he must check all attempts at incendiarism and devastation.
Art. 111. It is left to the discretion of the Commander-in-chief to make*
use of the Sassak population where needful; but it is desirable that they
should not be called upon to do any actual fighting; this would give rise to
certain claims on the part of the Sassak chiefs and would cause additional
complications later on.
It aa ould be advisable to obtain the services of the Sassaks as carriers in
return for payment.
yni. As soon as the surrender is achieved, either bv acceptance of
the ultimatum or by force of arms, the prince must be notified that our
claims are to be satisfied at once. The object set forth in Art. I will not be
consideied as attained until all the demands are satisfied, or where this is not
feasible, until such guarantees are given as will completely insure their fulfilment.
The Commander-in-chief must not rest content with a promise of future
payment of the war expenses, if he has reason to believe that the princes
are in a position to defray them at once, either entirely or in part. Under
these circumstances the Commander-in-chief shall insist upon an immediate-
instalment being paid 5 and a further sum as soon as he shall have made the
estimate of the expenses.
Art. IX. Until the ob ject of the Expedition, in the sense of the foregoing article,
has been obtained the Expeditionary force is to occupy the island of Lombock!
Art. X. In all political matters the Commander-in-chief is to act after-
conferring with the Resident of Bali and Lombock attached, to his staff/
Art. XL The Commander-in-chief is not authorized to enact any new
regulations in the island, but after the actual campaign is to make suck
representations and suggestions to the Governor- General as may be called forth
by the situation.
Art. XII, The Commander-in-chief must acquaint the Second-in-command
with all his plans and intentions. (In the event of the latter?s having to
assume chief-command, he would have to carry out all the instructions
received by the Commander-in-chief.)
Art. XIII. The Governor-General is to be immediately informed of every
important occurrence connected with the Expedition.
* An Englishman, a Mr. Cropley and an Austrian residing at Ampenam refused to take
advantage of the invitation conveyed to them to take refuge on one of our steamers. It being
suspected that they were in league with the Balinese they were placed in confinement to
prevent their travelling to the interior. During the absence of the Commander-in-chief on the
East coast Cropley succeeded in obtaining leave from the second-in-command to go to the
interior temporarily to settle his business matters. After the attack they were immediately
taken on board the Prins Hendrik and kept prisoners, until they were taken to Surabaya
where they were released owing to insufficient evidence against them.


Let us give honour where honour is due and frankly acknowledge
that the so frequently made mistake of dividing the responsibility of
leading the expedition and the result thereof between the Commander-in-
chief and the highest civil authority was avoided. In article Xit is
most distinctely stated that the Commander-in-chief acts in political
matters after conferring with the Resident attached to him. This is
perfectly clear, the Commander-in-chief is the sole person responsible,
also in political matters; this is the correct course, where our wishes
have to be enforced by fighting.
The political view of the Government is as Ave have seen to assist
this ill-treated people, but at the same time (Art I and II) they pro-
pose to maintain in authority the prince, the oppressor of the people
Thus, in spite of the best of intentions, they really placed General
Tetter betAveen tAvo fires.
If the main object of the Expedition was reconciliation ?and this we
have proved to be out of the question ?then we should have kept to a
course of negociations and have sent presents as in olden days, instead
of sending soldiers and cannons.
?But (says the writer in ?Het Yaderland?, 15 November) if we pro-
posed to repress wrong doing and considered it our duty to put a stop
to all atrocities within our dominions of the East Indian Archipelago,
?emphasizing our determination by a military expedition, well and good!
Having regard to the existing conditions of Lombock General Vetter
should have been empowered to declare the reigning rajah dethroned
and to have made him a prisoner, exiled him and confiscated his prop-
erty; it would have been time to consider the future administration of
the island after every inhabitant of Lombock had submitted to the
Netherlands Government.?
This decision should have been clearly specified in Articles I
and 11.
The prince would of course have refused these terms and we should
have come to blows at once! Exactly; we should have begun hostilities
at once, or at least on the 11th July, and it is probable that our losses
might have exceeded those avc suffered Avhen the attack took place;
but onr position would have been clear from the outset and our men
would have fallen in honorable strife and no reproach would have
attached to our brave and honest soldiers.
The General might have refused to be the hearer of such a mandate;
but this Ave refuse to admit.
Had the Commander-in-chief been thoroughly familiar with the true
political situation, he would haA r e known that the object of the Expedi-
tion Avas not attained Avith the submission of the princes and that at
this point, the difficulties were only about to begin in earnest, and that
consequently positive safety was the first requisite.
We can blame no one for the present state of affairs, it is more the
fault of the age than of the individual; we have more than once ob-
served how prejudicial it is that polities should occupy no place in the


training of our officers for the Indian Army. What a different system
is followed in British India.
It is seriously hoped that past occurrences may induce our Govern-
ment to yield to the oft-repeated suggestion, that officers of the General
Staff should be attached to the Governors and Residents in our
?colonies.
The political mistake, committed by the desire of the Government to
maintain the reigning house of Lombock, led to the military mistake
of her highest military servant
In this instance we have a redeeming point, well worthy of notice in
sinking contiast to the general rule of history, where the consequences
of a political mistake are visited upon the military commander who has
conscientiously obeyed higher orders; we here see the Governor General
taking the entire blame upon himself and screening the Commander-in-
chief, whom he maintains in his post, thus affording him ample oppor-
tunity to letiieve Ins error and re-establish Ins fame for courage and
skill! p
In order to arrive at an understanding it was necessary to see the
Sassak chiefs and obtain their co-operation; accordingly controller Lief-
rinck and captain Willenstijn started on the 13th July for the East
coast of Lombock, where they arrived two days later. They had several
conferences with the principal chiefs, who though apparently willing to
follow the instructions of our government showed decided disinclination
to accompany Liefrinck to Tjakra Nagara to discuss matters with the
Commander-in-chief. They alleged various motives, some were afraid
of going by sea, others by land, etc.
Ihe Controller and the Captain were obliged to depart, taking with
them only three chiefs and not very influential ones either; all the
others had promised to meet at Praja, the border of their territories,
?on the 23rd and march through Balinese country together till they
reached the Residence of the Commander-in-chief.
An unexpected incident was brought to light during this trip.
A native adventurer, Daeng Ginoro, had appeared on the island and
had obtained a large following of Sassaks on the East coast and chiefly
at Sakra; he came to free them from the Balinese and being no friend
of ours, pointed out to the people that our presence in the island
merely meant a change of masters whilst he would give them freedom
His attitude towards our envoys at Sakra was most arrogant and
overbearing; it is probably only due to their calm behaviour and a
severe warning to the chief of Sakra that nothing serious occurred.
At the meeting between the Commander-in-chief and the three Sassak
chiefs, they were ordered to deliver up this adventurer living or dead
into our hands; while attempts were being made to seize Ginoro, he
was shot dead by our friend, Raden Ginawan, the chief of Batu Khan.
The head was severed from the body and sent to the Commander-in-chief!
Fortunately for us this crisis was promptly ended, and the orders


that had been given to van Lawick?s column to advance from Ampenam
to Batu Kliau and seize Ginora were superfluous.
After their return to Tjakra Nagara, Controller Liefrinck and Captain
Willemstijn went, as arranged, to Praja to meet all the chiefs who had
promised to assemble there on the 28rd.
On their arrival they only found two of the most influential chiefs
and these two happened to live there; they declared that none of the
others had dared leave their districts for fear of the Balinese taking
possession of their property, and notwithstanding the written assurances
of the Commander-in-chief that no harm should befall them, that they
should if desired have a military escort back to their dessas, nothing
would induce them to leave their homes; and even those two at Praja
absolutely refused to accompany the controller to Tjakra Nagara!
It seemed impossible to reason with these people.
When finally the controller removed one by one all the difficulties
and insisted upon their going to Tjakra with "him, they showed him a
letter written by Gusti Djilantik to one of the Sassak chiefs, and as
they had decided never to place themselves again under the Balinese
they could not possibly go and discuss matters with the Commander-
in-chief. In this letter Djilantik informed Mami Anon that it was
decided to raise Anak Agong k?Toet to the throne; the hated Made
being dead, they had nothing more to fear and there were no reasons
existing now to prevent the Sassaks submitting to the old order of things.
Besides if they persisted in their decision not to recognize Balinese rule,
the General and his soldiers would compel them to do so by force.
He advised them to come to Tjakra Nagara as soon as possible and
he promised them his protection.
Who can fathom the depth of Djilantik?s motives? Did he foresee
that an ultimate division of the land was inevitable, and was he seeking
to obtain influence over the Sassaks at this period, so as to facilitate
his being created their acknowledged head later on?
The Commander-in-chief showed his displeasure with Djilantik very
plainly: ?In future no steps were to be taken by him nor yet in his
name to urge the Sassaks to submission.? Djilantik took the reprimand
very much to heart and in private he told General van Ham that he
?would put up with any rebuff from him, that he might even beat him
or kick him if he liked, but he would never take such a scolding from
the Commander-in-chief again!?
The deputation to Praja had failed in its mission; and what was the
Commander-in-chief to do?
He could not compel the Sassaks to submit to the Rajah against their
will; he had come with the object of helping them out of their troubles;
besides who could foretell the consequences of such a proceeding!
There were two ways out of the difficulty; one was to proclaim the
Sassaks independent under their own chiefs and the other was to place
them under our own control. The former plan offered no advantage;
the various chiefs were all jealous of one another, and not one amongst


them possessed sufficient authority or knowledge to be placed over the
others; such a course would have paved the way for endless intrigues
like those we had had to settle at Bali and furthermore it would have
been opposed to our promises to the princes?and to the instructions
of the Commander-in-chief. The second alternative was not feasible under
the existing circumstances for the same reasons, that is to say because
it w as opposed to the instructions. It is an elementary principle of
statesmanship to hold the native princes and chiefs in honour, to support
their authority and not to extend our direct control at their expense.
In the abstract nothing can be simpler or more just than to govern the
people through their princes and where it has been practicable, so as
on the Bast coast of Sumatra, or Borneo or Celebes, we have adhered
to the principle with very satisfactory results.
Circumstances have forced us sometimes to introduce direct adminis-
tration, in cases where there are no chiefs of sufficient influence or men
whom we could rely upon and in every instance the inhabitants have
gained advantages never enjoyed under their own princes.
There are people who contend that this course entails too great a
strain upon our finances and upon our administrative forces; statistics
entirely disprove this statement.
lake Java; although there are fewer European officials employed
there, comparatively speaking, still the revenues are no larger in pro-
portion than those of the Government residencies.
Do we not reap more advantages from Palembang, under our direct
administration, than we do from the West coast and Borneo? and what
could be more satisfactory than the financial results of Boeleleng and
Djembrana ? *
The proportion of officials employed in Palembang is the same as on
the West coast of Borneo; in the former?exclusive of Djambi?we have
24 officials to a population of 588.000 souls and in the latter 16 officials
to 888.000 inhabitants. In the Residency on the East coast of Sumatra
with 280.000 inhabitants, or two-fifths of Palembang, there are 18 officials,
where as according to the proportion of the population 10 ought to
suffice.
W r e may conclude therefore by saying that had we not been bound
by our contract to the princes there was no valid reason why we should
have abstained from placing the Sassak territory under our direct
administration.
Those terrible occurrences of 25?26 August relieved us of this last
obligation and put an end to what would have proved an untenable
position in the long run.
Furnished with the authorization of the Governor General the Com-

mander-in-chief determined to meet the chiefs of the East coast in their
own territory, being fully persuaded that no definite settlement could
be arrived at without very tangible guarantees. On the 4th August the
Commander-in-chief, accompanied by the Resident, the chief of his
staff, controller Liefrinck and his aide-de-camp Lieutenant Kolting,
reached the seaboard town Labuan Hadji, where all the principal SassalC
chiefs had assembled. The same day a conference was begun, which
lasted for three days; on the one hand there was a detailed recapitu-
lation of all the grievances with which we are acquainted, on the other
the decisions of the Government were stated regarding the future admi-
nistration of Lombock.
The Commander-in-chief promised to propose to the Governor-General
that a European representative should be established at Mataram and
on the East coast of Lombock to check any usurpation of power on
the part of the Balinese princes. The Balinese and the Sassaks alike
were to remain under Balinese rule, which was to be administered by
their respective chiefs, who were to be approved of by the Government
and not to be dismissed at the will of the princes.
Einally all the mutual duties of prince and people were to be
minutely regulated, ?the mandjing and tjampoet?? were to be abolished
and provision should be made to insure respect for the religious laws
and institutions of the people. The chiefs were perfectly satisfied with
all the proposals, but objected, that they were bound by their oath
never to submit to Balinese rule; accordingly at the second meeting
one hadji and one panghoeloe were present, with the result that the
chiefs were released from their oaths, which were no longer binding
under the altered circumstances. At the last meeting this resolution
was ratified in a written document and three of the chiefs were
appointed to accompany the Commander-in-chief to Tjakra Nagara to
assist at the final councils.
He returned to Ampenam on the Bth August, having successfully
accomplished his mission. The Sassaks were quite satisfied with what
was to be the new order of things their days of oppression were
over and no Balinese would interfere with them in future. Events will
show whether the Balinese were equally satisfied, but meanwhile we
will return to our troops.
It is difficult to describe life in an Indian bivouac, where the mono-
tonous daily life is a repetition of the day before. The place of the
bivouac, which we have shown in the sketch, reminds one of an old-
fashioned town where all the principal buildings form the centre and
the least important houses and people are kept at a respectable distance.
Llere we have the square with the quarters of the Commander-in-chief,
as in the old town there was the market-place with its town-hall; then
there are the narrow passages and streets with the police patrols,
corresponding to the old night watchmen and at the entries and
exits there are the sentries on duty carefully scrutinizing all who
come and go.


But how vastly different is the life of the camp to that of the old
provincial town!
While the darkness of night still overspreads the camp dark black
figures move stealthily along between the sheds and wend their way
towards the kitchens: they are the convicts, whose duty it is to prepare
breakfast for the troops; at this point the comparison between camp
and town ceases, for nowhere have we seen it related that the burgo-
master provided meals for his fellow-citizens!
In the bivouac space is very limited; we see the officers of a company
lodged in small sheds, no larger than a horse-box, and literally sharing
Bivouac of the Field-Artillery.
bed and board; even the quarters of the Commander-in-chief are barely
the size of his bath-room in Batavia, and they are shared by his aide-
de-camp. J
Sometimes during the night there is a little extra room, when some
of the troops are sent off on unexpected marches, orders being kept
secret until the last moment; they dress in the dark, grope about for
their guns and are ready to start in half an hour?s time: they are ready
to go when and where they are told without any questions, prepared to
obey and to follow their leaders blindly and confidently even to death
As yet however, they are allowed to rest; when they do get up they


all go and bathe in the cool refreshing stream close by . . . if they are
so fortunately situated.
After the early swim all are ready for their breakfast of soup or rice;
the sun rises slowly and the scorching heat soon compels all who are
not on duty to retreat into the shadiest nook they can find and there
is little or no movement in the camp during the middle of the day.
Towards sunset the cool evening breeze restores life in the bivouac, the
soldiers sing merrily and the natives play sad melancholy music; the
twilight is full of mysteries, sounds of men and animals mingle with
the sweet fragrance of the trees and plants and the Europeans abandon
themselves to the enjoyment of the delicious tropical evening allowing
their thoughts to wander away from the scene, whilst the natives are
happy playing cards round a little oil-lamp!
Preparations are already being made for the morrow in some quarters;
the chief is making out his daily report and some are busy writing
home. Soon the ?last post? is sounded and all turn in to rest, excepting
those on whom the watch devolves.
In order to prevent the great evil of ?boredom? penetrating amongst
the troops not engaged in actual combat, also to add to our topographical
acquaintance with the country and to keep the soldiers well exercised,
marches were made daily along the numerous roads or to one of the
many country seats belonging to the prince?s family. We will follow
van Alting von Geusau on one or two of these excursions; in his diary
he describes the expedition to ?Narmada?, the palace which was not
?completed at the time of controller Heijliger?s visit in 1884:
?The natives are seated on either side of the road staring with all
their might and main at the wonderful appearance of properly drilled
troops, they are filled with awe at the sounds of the lusty Western
music, contrasting so strikingly with the apathy that breathes from their
island ?gamelangs? and there is no doubt but that we shall survive in
the imagination of these good people as titans and giants who came
with great fire-ships to punish Anak Agong Made for all his misdeeds.
One cannot help noticing that, though in the aggregate the Balinese
seem strangely afraid to fight us, taken singly they do not evince very
much fear of the soldiers, who have come to conquer! ?Yesterday a
man passed so close to me in the open road that he actually trod on
my foot; 1 did not hesitate to send him rolling with a kick, nevertheless
he had been guilty of an act of marked disrespect! ?
There is no doubt about it, at this stage of the business, the Balinese
had got over their first fears!
?Well then, it was settled that we were to start early yesterday
morning for ?Narmada?, the country residence of the old Rajah of
Lombock. The son of Agong k?Toet, recently recognized by the Com-
mander-in-chief as successor to the throne, was supposed to be residing
here, but he was absent.
?Outside Tjakra Nagara the scenery is very similar to most Indian
landscapes; sawahs, cocoa-nut-trees, bamboo plantations, small woods


just like at Java; the only noticeable difference is that the kampongs
are more extensive, small dessas are unknown and no one would venture
to establish himself beyond the kampong boundary line.
\-V e reached Narmada at 8.30 a.m. after a two and a half hour?s
march, and, as we remained there four hours, I had ample time to look
round the neighbourhood, beginning, naturally, with the palace. It is
situated on the South side of the road; as is customary, the entrance is
rough a very narrow doorway, only admitting of one person passing
at a time and leading to a large open square, dotted over with numerous
dirty little sheds or huts. On the right hand side of the square is a
pond plentifully supplied with ?goramek ? and ? bandeng?, some of which we
caught by means of hook and line and a couple of ?ketans? (little rice
sweetmeats). On the opposite side of the square, near the door we had
to go through, was a small house, where ten soldiers of the prince?s
ody-guard were stationed; their spears, the only weapons they then
had, were all placed neatly m a row on a rack. I was surprised to see
some cannons and some muskets bearing the same mark as their coins
(Alg. Oost-Ind. Comp.) and evidently made at Enkhuizen and I am at
ci loss to understand their presence there.
?To the left of the second square are a few sheds said to contain the
prince s kepengs and to the right is the harem. In addition to the
servant s quarters, standing out in squalid contrast, there were only three
buildings of any importance, two of which were provided with galleries
a couple of metres from the ground and profusely hung with European
and Chinese prints. The doors were all symetrically designed and
wonderfully carved besides being prettily decorated with variegated
flowers. The third building contained a couple of sleeping apartments
leading off from a large centre gallery, which is reached by ascending
about ten to twelve steps; the view obtainable from the gallery is such
as to make one marvel at the native architecture and industry and will
ever recur to my memory should I feel inclined to labour under the
delusion that the people possess no real energy or determination. The
attention is immediately arrested by a projecting right angle of seven
Imge terraces, on the highest of which stands a dewa-temple dedicated
o he Hindu gods; the terraces are used for the services and ceremonies
in honour of Madjapahit. Advantage has been taken of a spring close
by to lay out most magnificent waterworks, principally for baths thus
the prince s private bath is supplied by fifteen jets of overflowing crystal-
hke water and a lower terrace has a bath supplied by eight jets from
the same source. At the foot of the terraces is a pond 100 metres
long, but unlike the generality of them it is not square; where there
are no terraces grass mounds have been raised to the height of
JO metres, all having arbours on the tops; on the North was a fine
rockery and on the South a lovely richly-planted table-land.?
The sides of the pond are of stonework and the water runs into it
from two different points; there is a waterfall two metres high on the
East providing a perpetual supply of water so clear and transparent that
1 A


the little fish swimming about are easily discernible. After spending
some time in admiring this really fine pond, we proceeded in a southerly
direction and here Ave found subject for admiration, but this time it
was not man?s handiwork; it Avas a most fascinating little brook gliding
smoothly along amidst the high slopes Avith their luxurious plantations,
so graceful and pretty in its windings, that one could not fail being
struck at its loveliness; ivy trails along the waterside and magnificent
green ferns adorn the banks, whilst bamboos bend elegantly above the
ferns, ivy and water. The pond is pretty, but that little stream out-
strips it in its simple grandeur!
?.... Outside the Narmada kampong the road is very steep.... we
are told that this is the point where the last encounter took place
between the Sassaks and the Balinese, Avhen the fighting was of such a
desperate nature, that both sides were completely exhausted and forced
to retreat. Although it is months since the event took place, the
country bears witness to the struggle: everything looks sad and desolate,
the kampongs are deserted and burnt to the ground and all the trees
are cut doAvn! Sad picture of a battle-field in all its naked horrer!
?I should have enjoyed going with some of the artillery who went
on an expedition to Praja, the seat of the Sassak rebellion; it is situ-
ated in the centre of the Southern division of Salamparang. There is
a three hour?s ride through the most complete scene of desolation, a few
shrubs here and there and at intervals a skeleton.?
Lieutenant Alting von Geusau did not accompany the column sent
to Praja, but another, of which we shall hear presently. The next expe-
dition he made was to the recently built country-seat of Made; the
enormous difficulties attendant on laying the foundations for the deep
ponds constituted one of the immediate causes of the insurrection, as
thousands of the natives were forced to work without payment, such
work being looked upon as part of their duties as vassals.
?Lingsar? Avas the residence of the notorious Anak Agong Made; the
continual presence of the master?s eye was visible at first sight, for it
was in all respects kept up better than the other princely residences,
but there was something about the place which repelled me. The road
leading to it was inferior to the one running to Narmada, still there
Avere rows of cocoa-nut trees and sweet-smelling nangkas, but on the
Avhole I was disappointed. In spite of the superficial appearance of
care bestowed on the place, there were many weeds in the garden and
the banks of the pond were in disrepair; the pond is 800 metres long
by 50 metres wide and is ornamented Avith some very ugly statues, the
water is supplied by the Songei Antjar, which apparently rises at Lingsar.
?When leave Avas given the men of the battalion to bathe, it was a
curious sight to see a couple of hundred white and brown mortals jump
into the water and so thoroughly enjoy swimming about together.
?The only thing of real interest on this estate was the Budhist temple;
Made?s private apartments were closed, but according to hearsay they
are no better than common barns. We had some difficulty in persuading

the guardian to let us pass into the temple enclosure, but finally he
opened the gate and our sacrilegious feet trod upon the clay soil where
the temple stood.?
We will not describe the general disposition of the temple; they are
all more or less on the same plan.
? A great walled-in square with a magnificent blue dome.... the
shy. The first object to attract our notice was the source of the
Songei Antjar, held to be sacred and encircled by a thick wall; to visit
the source we had to creep through a narrow low doorway, constructed,
I should say, to teach the people how to bend. The water was of a
pronounced blue and here and there were kepengs on the ground, offerings
I suppose, from people who had come to derive benefit from the healing
properties of the source. On each side of this curious little well were
stone steps, at the top of which a door guarded by female Budhist
statues and leading to the actual places of sacrifice, of which there were
seven ....
?This is all I can say of the much-talked-of Lingsar! I have no
hesitation in stating that both Narmada and Gunong Sari surpass it in
every way.
?But what is the good of long marches and wading through about
twenty rivers, some knee-deep, to go and visit a place like that, when
within a quarter of an hour of our camp there is the fine residence of
Tjakra Nagara??
As we are acquainted with the plan of Tjakra Nagara we will only
quote the description of the lake.
?There is a magnificent lake on the right which I reckon to be
600 metres long and 200 wide; it is planted round with fine tall trees
and in the centre is an island about 20 metres long and 10 wide, access
to which is obtained by a bank of earth from the side and shut off
by a prettily carved wooden door. A small house with marble floors
is on the island; these were the first I have seen in all the princely
dwellings. It was very comfortably arranged, a nice open gallery and a
couple of bed-rooms. This appears to have been the favorite home of
the old Raj ah. In the neighbourhood was a Chinese carriage to be
drawn by men; it was the only thing of the kind that I have seen in
Lombock.?
To conclude, we will give a description of one more military march:
?It was South this time and then along the coast, but we paid no
heed to wet feet. Here we traversed entirely deserted kampongs, one
continuous scene of ruin and devastation, broken down walls and burnt
down houses. A native who attached himself to our column told us
that ten months previously Made had ordered the destruction of the
kampongs and all the women and children were murdered; he himself
had been wounded and his wife and five children killed.
What a miserable wretch that Made must have been!
At last we reached the sea; on the left, Southwards, the mountains
rise straight from the sea, forming a splendid back-ground for one of

our white government steamers; facing us was the immeasurable sea
and Bali was not within sight. The water was calm and here and there
a native was rowing his own peculiar little boat; to the North was a
projecting cape, against which the ships in the roadstead of Ampenam
showed up well. Besides the men of war there were only two steamers
belonging to the Steam Navigation Company and they all presented a
very interesting scene. In the far distance in a N. W. direction the
oeak of Bali pierces the clouds like a giant pyramid; and further still;
beyond Bali and East Java, I could distinguish the Sumbing, and
beneath it is Magalang and our little house. . . .?
Alas! this young officer never saw his home again.
The negociations with Anak Agong k?Toet, destined by the terms of
the ultimatum to be his father?s successor on the throne, were begun
immediately after the return of the Commander-in-chief from his trip
to the East coast. Conferences were held daily and the crown prince,
always accompanied by Djilantik, took but a silent part and wore the
aspect of a condemned man.
To all questions put to him he invariably replied ?patoet?, meaning
?very well? or ?what you say is right.? The business was proceeding
both rapidly and satisfactorily; k?Toet raised no objections to anything;
without a word of protest he agreed to the war indemnity ?Art. VII
of the ultimatum ?fixed at one million florins, which in accordance with
Articles VIII and IX in the instructions of the Commander-in-chief
was to be paid before the departure of the expeditionary force from
Lombock. He undertook, without comment, to contribute fls. 25.000
annually towards the expenses of our administration in Lombock. (In
compliance with the promise made to the Sassak chiefs, the Commander-
in-chief had suggested the advisabilty of Dutch inspectors at Mataram
and East Lombock to the Governor-General, who by the 16th August
had obtained telegraphic consent to the proposal from the home government).
Alatters are progressing so speedily that the departure of the troops
is within measurable distance; the Commander-in-chief decides that it
is time for the Karang Assim troops to return to their own shores;
hitherto they have been doing outpost duty, which is no longer needed;
the fortresses built by the Sassaks are to be dismantled; the high roads
which had been destroyed and rendered impassable at various points
were to be repaired and the inhabitants who had been driven or had
fled from their dessas were to return without fear and begin work
again, by cultivating the neglected sawahs.
Djilantik agreed to the plan that his troops should be conveyed to
Bali on board the ?Maetsuijcker ?, daily expected from Surabaya and
two columns were ordered to advance into the interior to give notice
of the new arrangements.
One column under lieutenant-colonel van Bijlevelt was to bivouac
either at Sukarara or Praja for a few days and started from Tjakra
Nagara at 7 a.m. on the 17th of August; it consisted of the Ist and


X*V? ? ' ?- *y ? ?*" X ? -* . > _ '"- ;-, .v
3rd companies of the 6th battalion stationed there, one section of
mountain artillery, one section of engineers, the necessary train, an
ambulance, a military surveyor and four cavalry soldiers. They readied
Sukarara at 3.80 p.rn. and took up their quarters in the bivouac
piepaied for them by the people, situated in an open sawah about
500 metres from the kampong.
In accoi dance with their instructions daily marches were made in
various directions to ensure the orders being carried out to dismantle
the foits, icpaii the roads and encourage the people to return to their
homes and resume their daily avocations.
?Yan La wick?s column marching to Batu Klian.?
The second column under lieutenant-colonel van Lawick van Pabst
was similarly composed and was ordered to 13atu Ivlian, its special
mission being to capture Daeng Ginoro; they set out on the morning
of the 17th August, two Companies of the ninth battalion (the 2nd
native and the 4th European) starting from Ampenam and spending
one day at Tjakara Nagara where the remainder of the column was
made up only leaving two companies of the 6th battalion at Tjakra
iNagaia. ihe next morning after tidings had been received of the
unexpected death of Daeng Ginoro the column set out accompanied by
the band of the 6th battalion to within a quarter of an hour of


Narmada which was reached about 9 a.m. At 10 a.ra. they crossed the
S. Babak, a river 40 metres wide and 1 metre deep, the bed of which
was composed of huge stones, rendering the passage exceedingly difficult
for the artillery and the train. Very shortly after leaving Narmada the
neglected condition of the road was striking, it soon lost itself in a
narrow footpath barely wide enough for two men to walk a-breast and
frequently requiring the services of the engineers to make it passable
for the artillery. Not a single dwelling was visible between the river
and Batu Klian, the whole country resembled a desert and all that
remained of Pringarata, a former shooting box of the prince, were a
few delapidated walls, showing traces of what once had been a kampong.
After a short halt here the troops continued their march through
further scenes of ruin and destruction now filling the places of scenery
once so much admired by travellers like Zollinger and Treyss but
converted into a vast wilderness by the cruel way in which Made
carried on war. At 2.80 p.ra. men and horses were able to refresh
themselves at a wayside spring and in a couple of hours resumed their
march until 7.80 p.m. when they bivouacked for the night at a distance
of hours march from Balu Klian; the following morning they started
early and reached this once so noted dessa at half past nine. Their
reception by the people was all that could be desired and provisions of
bamboo and other necessaries for erection of the sheds for the troops
were brought in profusion to the chosen spot, close to which was a
clear running stream, which had indeed proved one of the chief attrac-
tion of the bivouac.
On the 20th August the commandant of the column with a detachment
of 75 bayonets to each company and half a section of engineers pushed
on to Swangi, a couple of pals* (1 pal = 1506 metres) south of Sakra,
on the East coast, to hold a parley with the principal chiefs there; the
remainder of the troops were left to complete the establishment of the
bivouac. This column reached Swangi at 2.80 p.m.; all preparations in
the way of food had been extensively made, the natives having been
informed of their intending visit by an inhabitant of Koupang through
which kampong they had passed earlier. After the conference with the
chiefs, the return march was made the same day, but by a shorter
road; the troops arrived in camp at Batu Klian at 8 p.m. having done
32 miles that day .
The next few days were spent in visiting the different neighbourhoods
and the engineers superintended the repairing of the roads, where
possible. After the morning?s march the afternoon was frequently spent
in consulation with the chiefs who squatted round the major listening
to his orders and suggestions.
Instead of following the columns on their daily excursions we will
return to the main body and the chiefs events of the last days preced-
ing the attack. First however we will say a word or two about the
wisdom of despatching the columns into the interior, which action has

given rise to conflicting opinions. On the one hand it is alleged that
by sending them to such long distances the main body was consider-
ably weakened and that the forces were much too scattered, thus
as it were playing into the enemy?s hands; in objection to this
it is said that, each column being strong enough in itself to fulfil
its appointed task, there can be no question of scattering the forces,
that in former campaigns, the entire expedition was often no stronger
than one of these separate detachments, which were sufficiently formida-
ble to impress the native enemy. The expeditions to the interior of
Lombock partook more of the character of excursions and although
such small forces would never have undertaken similar marches in Bali,
Boni or Atcheen, they would certainly have made similar ones in the
Batak territory, in the thinly populated districts of Sumatra and in
Borneo. In forming an opinion on this question one must bear in mind
the strength and organization of the enemy to be dealt with and although
300 men may have been considered a sufficient force to reduce Lom-
bock to submission in the previous century, the case is materially
altered at the present day and not to our advantage.
We cannot c.eny that after the division of the forces, Ampenam and
Tjakra Nagara were left very weak, especially the latter and as soon as
the Commander-in-chief received information of the impending attack
his first act was to send reinforcements there.
The point to be decided before forming an opinion, is whether at
the time the columns were moving about, there was any thought of
hostilities or not; it appears to us that there can have been no fears
on that score: the Sassaks were perfectly satisfied and the Balinese
appeared to be.
We consider that the situation of the troops whilst marching was far
less dangerous than being all gathered together at Tjakra and Mataram,
when total annihilation from a treacherous enemy was far more likely
than when there was less concentration; besides there was not a single-
advantage to be gained by remaining in the insufficiently fortified
bivouacs, whereas the knowledge of the country obtained during the
marches proved very valuable. We think there is everything to be said
in defence of the course of the Commander-in-chief, who when he
decided upon it, was thoroughly convinced of the sincerity of the Balinese;
still we had laid down very stringent conditions, difficult of acceptance-
and sure to cause many heartburnings; these facts should have been
borne in mind and our attitude regulated accordingly.
i
The discussions concerning the treaty were at an end and nothing
was wanting but the final approval of the princes and notables. When
the negociations which had been carried on in Malay were over, the
Commander-in-chief said to Djilantik: ?Have they clearly grasped the
meaning of the conditions?? ?I have perfectly,? was the reply; ?That
is not what I mean; I wish to know whether K?Toet who has to carry
out the treaty, has understood????Not one single word!?


Controller Liefrinck was instructed to translate the treaty into Balinese;
as he handed them sheet by sheet, princes and poenggawas studied
each point carefully and minutely and they were not slow to discover
that this contract, securing autonomy for the Sassaks, by the presence
of our representatives, was the death blow to their power and influence
over these people whom hitherto they had trodden to the ground and
that henceforth there was an end to all the privileges and benefits which they
had so largely enjoyed either secretly or publicly, rightly or wrongly.
Combination was all they could oppose to this curtailment of their
privileges and circumstances favored them; during the last few years
the Lombock princes had purchased large supplies of the best and most
modern weapons and had accumulated an abundance of ammunition.. ..
certainly not from any special sense of friendship towards us.
lu view of our unexpected arrival ?we had so often threatened
before?and our incredible display of strength, they had carefully con-
cealed these treasures and adapted themselves to circumstances ?they
now considered the circumstances altered and they were still possessed
of their meams of attack or defence, as the case might be. By this
time their awe of our strength, our troops and the unknown had worn
off; they had grown accustomed to our presence, they knew our habits
and they had tried to watch our drill and more especially they had
made every endeavour to discover how we handled our guns.
Was it likely that their large numbers, provided with the necessary
means of warfare, should tamely submit to a comparatively small force ?
They thought not; the opportunity now offered by the Netherlands troops
being dispersed and having a broken line of communication was favor-
able to the scheme proposed by the poenggawas to the prince who
readilv fell in with it.
In fear and trembling he had acceded to all our demands on our
arrival; he saw however that no harm towards his person was imminent,
that the throne was secured to his dynasty, therefore he too began to
be less afraid.
We had however touched his weak spot in forcing him to part with
his money; he had spent his life in accumulating and hording it up
and now he saw his treasure diminish little by little; on the 20th Augustly
fls. 200,000, on the 22nd August by fls. 250,000 and there was more
to be paid still!
The temptation to resist our demands was too great both for the
prince and the notables.
Ought we not to have been informed of this new current of feeling
by our spies?
Had we not, from the time that Djilantik had thrown in his lot with
?ours, seen most things through his eyes? His officiousness and his
assistance, which had rendered him almost indispensable, were quite
?sincere as long as there was a reasonable prospect of his deriving some
advantage from our friendship, but when he found himself completely


ignoiecl in the new contract and was told unceremoniously that he and
his troops could go home, without any sort of acknowledgement of his
services, we think that a strong temptation to revenge himself must
have presented itself to him. He must have hesitated long before deciding,
foi he ically loved General van Ham and it pained him to think that he
too would have to be punished with the others; he struggled desperately
within himself during the days previous to the attack and endeavoured to
o itain foigetfulness by means of opium, which he consumed immoderatelv.
*7
y*� " : ' s fftst approaching when the expedition would have accom-
plished its mission; they are only waiting for the last instalment of the
war expenses and for the signatures to the treaty. A few of the troops
would stay on the island to ensure the carrying out of certain conditions
and improvements, but the main body would return to Java shortly
and were looking forward to a joyful ? meeting with friends after such
a magnificent success, attained without the loss of one drop of blood.
But coming events cast their shadows before, and in this instance
the shadows began to assume tangible proportions.
The women and children no longer visited the bazaars (markets) as
they had been accustomed to do; the chiefs were less submissive and
the order to bring 70 picols to Ampenam to transport supplies to the
column at Sukarara was neglected. A sort of passive opposition was
shown in not removing the Karangassim troops at once from their
outposts on the Sassak frontiers; and even when they finally assembled
at Ijakra INagara on the 23rd August fresh motives were put forward
to delay their embarcation for Bali.
On two occasions the indemnity money was overdue when brought
and on another delay was asked for on the plea that there was no
more money available; finally the day before the attack a small in-
stalment of fis. 25.000 was offered, but of course could not be
accepted.
Oddly enough too, when some few details had to be settled about the
taxes and the vassal duties, both Anak Agong k?Toet and Gusti Djilantik
were too ill to be present.
All that the doctor, sent by the Commander-in-chief to visit Djilantik,
could discover, was that he was in a state of stupor produced by
opium; the prescribed remedies were however not applied and next day
another medical man was deputed to enquire into the matter. His visit
was less successful, he waited for two hours but w r as refused admittance
to the patient?s room.
AAhat was the meaning of this sudden change in Gusti Djilantik? ?
Although the Commander-in-chief apprehended no serious trouble,
he thought it necessary to accquaint tre Governor-General with the
alteied attitude of poenggaw r as and people. On that same evening, the
24th August, General Vetter gave special injunctions to Captain Kamer-
man, the Commandant of the two companies (2nd comp. Amboynese
and 4th comp. Europeans) left in the bivouac to keep a good watch.


Fortunately the night passed by without disturbance; we say fortu-
nately, for the Balinese had certainly intended it to be otherwise.
Next day, the 25th, a further sum of fls. 250.000 was brought and
whilst 10 Amboynese soldiers, under supervision of Captain Manders
of the artillery, were counting the coins and testing them, a Balinese,
hidden behind a wall, threw a bottle at them; he was seized and carried
to Ampenarn in chains. The incident was ended but it was another
discordant note in the harmony that had been existing.
Between 5 and 6 p.m. Captain Schmidhamer came riding from
Ampenarn to ask for an interview with the Commander-in-chief; he was
the bearer of an ominous report, the truth of which he could not vouch
for, but he had been informed by the Klian, Amah Amat of Sukaradja,
a Sassak kampong in the vicinity of Ampenarn, that the Balinese
contemplated attacking the bivouack at Tjakra Nagara that night. The
assault had been planned for the night before, but deferred owing to
the wife of one of the chief leaders, having died, which was looked
upon as a bad omen.
For once we may feel grateful to Balinese superstition, which saved
us from worse calamities than even those we have had to deplore. 1
On receipt of this news the Commander-in-chief lost no time in
sending the Resident and General van Ham to Djilantik to ask point
blank what he knew of the plain Captain Kamerman received immediate
orders to prepare to leave Tjakra with his men and baggage and with-
draw to Mataram; the transport waggons were however with the
detached columns. The Resident and the General returned from their
visit to Djilantik, who had sworn he knew nothing of an attack and
that there was no plot against us; thereupon they were despatched to
the crown prince, with strict instructions not to allow themselves to be
put off with any plea of sickness, but they were doomed to disappoint-
ment, for his Highness was ill and remained ill and they were unable
to obtain an interview.
A conference was now held by the Commander-in-chief, the Second-
in-command and the Resident; the two latter discredited the rumour
and pointed out what a ridiculours figure we should cut in the eyes of
the Balinese if we were to take any retrograde step on the strength of
it. It was deemed advisable to Avait until the following day before
finally deciding upon an action savouring of retreat, ?instead of this,
the bivouac was strengthened by a company, the 3rd of the 7th battalion
and a section of the field-artillery, summoned from Mataram by the
Commander-in-chief. The two field pieces were so located in the pro-
jecting portion of the open space as to command the road both in an
Easterly and in a Westerly direction and were loaded with shrapnel;
the situation of the guns was early explained to the troops coming from
Mataram to prevent any danger to them in case of an ?alarm.?
For prudence ?sake the last portion of the war indemnity received
that morning was transferred to the bivouac at Mataram, while orders
were given for the headquarters to be henceforward in the bivouac with


the troops at Tjakra, which arrangement was opposed by general Van
Ham who retained implicit belief in Djilantik?s assurance of good faith.
The Commander-in-chief, taking a less optimistic view of the case,
agreed that if any thing happened to his soldiers, it was his duty to
be with them and not separated from them. The offices of the General
Staff and the field telegraph were vacated; the orderlies, clerks and
servants packed up their things ....
Written orders were despatched to the columns at Batu Klian and
Sukarara to return at once, taking additional precaution. Finally a
letter was written to Iv Toet, informing him of the current rumour and
requesting an explanation of it if true; but if unfounded he was
exhorted to use his authority to discover those who had circulated it
and punish them. It took a couple of hours to write this letter, the
original having to be translated first into Malay, then into Balinese; it
was 8.80 p.m. when it was handed to K?Toet?s son at the poeri.
At 8 p.m. the Commander-in-chief took supper with his staff in the
small poeii and about nine he strolled leisurely to Ins new quarters in
the bivouac; everything was quiet here and though stricter precautions
had been taken no serious danger was anticipated.
Hie officers walked up and down chatting, General Van Ham remark-
ing to captain Kamerman: ?You will see, nothing will happen!? later
they played cards, the second-in-command taking a hand. At 11 p.m.
Geneial Vetter retired to rest! Calm and repose are no doubt admirable
qualities, but we think that, in face of all the circumstances we have
detailed, especially the altered behaviour of Djilantik, a little more
activity would not have been out of place.
Was any real plan of defence prepared in case of an attack? could
it honestly and conscientiously be said: ?we have done our duty; we
are ready; let the enemy come if he dare!? We hardly think so, or
surely they would never have persisted in occupying such an unfavourable
position.
It was of course too late to have retreated to Mataram as first sug-
gested by General Vetter and General Van Ham was quite correct in
pointing out what a sorry figure we should cut by retreating if the
rumour proved unfounded. This argument ought not to have hindered
our taking up a more advantageous position at Tjakra; reasons of court-
esy should no longer have stood in the way of our occupying the two
squares of the Hewa temple; the troops coming from Mataram should
have brought further food supplies and drinking water should have been
provided; and finally we should have insisted upon our ally Gusti
Djilantik sharing our bivouac for reasons of his personal safety!
Had such a proposal been made to him, he would have been bound
to choose one way or other and a more correct conclusion might have
been drawn from his actions than from his utterances.
The question remains, did the Commander-in-chief believe in the
rumour or did he not ?
That he did not entirely cast it aside like General Van Ham is


apparent from the measures he took; consequently we are at a loss to
understand why he returned to the small poeri with his staff for supper
after dusk. By this time the Balinese must have noticed that we were
warned and might they under the circumstances not have struck the
first blow rather before the appointed time, to prevent our taking any
more precautions and thereby entirely frustrate their plans?
The return to the poeri proves great personal courage and coolness,
but the risk was too great and it is only owing to the most inexplicable
neglect on the part of the Balinese that a decisive blow was not struck.


VI.
THE ATTACK.
ihe stillness of the night was undisturbed; there was no warning note to
advise us of the black betrayal that was being planned and plotted behind
the Avails that encircled the bivouac; no kindly moon lighted up the fir-
mament; it uas one of those dark black nights peculiar to the tropics!
only here and there a solitary field lantern, throwing a faint glimmer in
the immediate neighbourhood.
Suddenly a shot was heard at a quarter past eleven coming from behind
the walls of the artillery stables; it was followed by others in quick suc-
cession proceeding from Westerly and South Westerly directions; these
first discharges were not without fatal result, for one of the subordinate
officers was mortally wounded.
Ihe officers were on their feet at once, the alarm signal given and
every man stood armed at his post; the East flank (of the projecting
division of the open bivouac) was occupied by the 4th company of Euro-
peans under captain Kamerman; the North West and South sides by
the 2th company Amboynese, captain Euhrhop of the 6th battalion and
the 3rd company Madurese, captain Matthes of the 7th battalion. Two
sections of the latter companies were held in reserve. *
We returned the enemy?s fire with all our might and main, but it
was growing rapidly more and more furious; in the midst of the tur-
moil sounds of martial music reached us from the kampong and the poeri;
the enemy beat their drums vigorously and the intervals were filled up-
up by the most hideous war cries; the noise drew nearer and
approached the bivouac from the West. The advancing natives were
greeted with a couple of vollies from the infantry and a discharge from
the guns nearest them; this unexpected reception called forth shrieks
and yells of disappointment and the enemy receded. An hour later
a new attempt was made to assault the bivouac on the East side, but
here too the welcome accorded them forced them to retire. This second
defeat caused the Balinese to alter their tactics, they no longer attacked
us in the open but continued their fire on our unprotected troops from
behind the walls, which alas! proved more effective; the number of
* Owing to the men being absent with the columns in the interior, the sections were only
about 30 men strong. The force at Tjakra consisted of about 400 men.


dead and wounded was rapidly increasing; after shooting down the
horses in their stables, they concentrated their attention on the men.
Single marksmen kept up an incessant fire from the west angle of
the large poeri and many of our artillery were hit, especially in the
legs; the Balinese were largely provided with repeaters, thus being
?enabled to fire several shots consecutively without loss of time.
The surgeon, Janssen, soon had his hands more than full.
We will quote an account of these events from an eye witness:
?I helped in so far as I could,? says Rogge, ?to dress and wash their
wounds with the little drinking water we had left. The large tent
where we had but recently dined was soon filled with wounded; unfor-
tunately our lanterns served as targets for the enemy?s bullets and more
?than one whizzed close to my head whilst I was reaching water out of
the pails. I looked into the dome pavilion at intervals, where I found
a few of the General Staff silently awaiting the course of events; unex-
pectedly a volley of shots was fired from a sentry-box situated exactly
?opposite to us and unfortunately they were aimed very straight, but
they were replied to by a volley from a section of soldiers stationed in
kneeling posture in front of the tent. The noise was deafening, it was
us if all the furies of hell had been let loose . . . .?
The Commander-in-chief began to feel alarm lest we should consume
too much ammunition and sent repeated messages by his aide-de-camp,
lieutenant Kotting and lieutenant de Greve enjoining us to be as sparing
as possible. The Balinese made several attempts to fire more into the
?centre of the bivouac, by placing high ladders against the inner walls
?of the poeri enclosure and shooting over them; our heavy guns proved
too much for them and no longer venturing to show their heads above
the walls, they fired at random and too quickly to work much damage,
?eventually ceasing altogether.
A new danger soon threatened us; we could hear distinct hammering
and knocking against the walls, the meaning of which was very appar-
ent ; the enemy was boring loop-holes through which to direct their
fire, they themselves being completely protected. In vain the artillery
tried to blow up the walls; they were too solid, besides the darkness
prevented the result from being visible. The only thing we could see
were sparks of fire flying here, there and everywhere; the roar of the
?guns was deafening and bullets were falling around us fast and quick;
to the right, to the left, in front, behind and everywhere, causing
many a poor fellow to stagger; added to all this was the ear-splitting
?sound of the tom-tom as an accompaniment to the hammering and
?boring of the walls.
The convicts whose quarters were located against the high poeri wall
were suddenly seized with a panic, and under the impression that the enemy
was pushing through the wall, they made a sudden rush for the opposite
side of the bivouac; the troops thinking it was the enemy opened fire
on them at once and many were seriously wounded. The situation was
going from bad to worse:


?Whilst I was discussing it with General van Ham-says Rogge?
a bullet killed a sergeant passing near us and a soldier who was
wounded in the chest handed me his gun, which I was bound to drop
as the barrel was so hot. No portion of the lower division of the
bivouac was safe and the position was growing quite untenable the
number of wounded being so great that all the huts were full- by this
time there were 12 killed and 87 wounded. We kept casting anxious
looks towards the sky and calculating how long it would be before the
moon rose and we should be able to verify the exact state of our
affairs; we hoped the Balinese would cease fighting soon, as General
van Ham, optimistic to the end, expected they would, or perhaps the
troops from Mataram would come to our assistance before long I was
wondering what had become of the three Sassak chiefs with their
followers and whether they had known of the intended attack but 1
never discovered what happened to them. 5 ? (They fled at the first
shot; Maim Moesti Hadji wandered about all night and finally joined
van Lawmks column; the other two returned to their villages.) ?Mean-
while the troops continued in excellent spirits ; I never heard a complaint
every man stuck to his post and did his duty. The claims upon Dr?
J anssen s hel P were incessant; he was indefatigable in his work never
sparing himself, but cheerfully assisting all who needed his services-
-1 was not the only person who watch ed him that night with admiration. ?
ic moon rose at half past two, but those who anticipated any
improvement from the fact were doomed to bitter disappointment; the
firing the shouts in the poeri, the beating of the drum, the hammering
everything went on as before and on our side more wounded were
carried in to the huts. At 4 a.m. Captain Tuhrhop was wounded and
had to be replaced at the most exposed point on the westerly flank by
Captain Kamerman; two sections had occupied this post but had dwindled
down to one and when the sun rose two hours later we discovered
that out or this remaining force eleven more were incapacitated.
About this time the efforts of the enemy had been crowned with
success, they had bored a hole through the wall and were able to fire
with comparative impunity, this triumph was a short lived one for a
shell from our artillery had filled the breach. ,
At last daylight appeared and who can describe the picture of human
misery and suffering within that limited space?
?It was heart-breaking,? says Rogge, ?to see the wounded men
ymg about on the field and I tried to speak words of comfort and
encouragement to them.
?No pen can write what I witnessed. There were men in the prime
o i e lying motionless, shot through the head, the breast, the arms or
the legs; others were struggling with death and praying God for deliver-
ance; some begged of us to say good-bye for them to their friends and
relations.
Whilst I was talking to one of the wounded, a soldier was struck
m the head by a bullet and fell dead at my feet.
15


?I and others were then cautioned not to remain exposed to the
murderous fire any longer; the General staff and many others had
withdrawn to the square within the high walls.
The enemy baffled at one point had bored several other loop-holes
and now in full daylight their aim would be more deadly; they were
firing from behind good cover straight into our exposed ranks and we
were powerless ; further resistance was out of the question.
The Commander-in-chief discussed with General van Ham the advisa-
bility of blowing up the poeri gate and then storming the poeri itself....
but nothing was known of the enemy?s strength within those Avails and
it AA'ould have been too bold a step to \ r enture upon Avith such a A r ery
limited force, some of whom would necessarily be left behind to guard
the wounded and the bivouac.
After further deliberation it was decided to transfer the entire
bivouac to the enclosure of the actual Dewa-temple and by 7 a.m.
this Avas accomplished. There was comparative safety between the
high walls as long as the assailants placed no high ladders against them
and fired into our midst; to forestall this some breaches were made
and Ave placed ladders on our side of the walls; the enemy made no
attempt to leave the position they occupied; only a couple of cham-
pions passed along the road executing a cat ive dance and AA r ere imme-
diately shot down by Kamerman?s company.
The hours went by drearily enough and there w r as a general sort of
respite, the men stood or lay speechless beside one another; tired and
exhausted many sought repose beneath the sheds; General van Ham
lay down on a heap of dry leaves to rest, alas, for the last time ! This
state of things could not be endured for long; there was nothing to
eat or drink and all attempts to dig a Avell in the temple had proved
abortive; there was only enough water, carried from the open bivouac,
to make tea for the men once. The ammunition of the combatants
Avas exhausted and the soldiers had used up a large supply of cartridges.
The Commanders now discussed the next move and whether they were
to decide upon waiting for the arrival of the columns from the interior
one of which was expected that afternoon, the other the following day.
This is what had been intended when they withdrew to the DeAva
inclosure, but they had hoped for assistance from Mataram, where they
had heard some firing in the early morning Avhich had since ceased.
All the messages sent to Mataram remained unanswered as the
chance of help from that quarter grerv fainter they began to realize
more vividly the terrible pass they vrere in, especially when they felt
their inability to help the detached columns as defenceless as themselves;
the Commander-in-chief resolved that if no help had reached them by
8 p.m. he would retreat to Mataram.
Efforts were now made to inform the columns of the departure from
Tjakra Nagara and to send instructions to van LaAvick to retreat to the
East coast and to van Bijlevelt to lead his men direct to Ampenan,
avoiding Tjakra and Mataram. Although remittance of their sentence


was promised to convicts who would carry the orders, not one was
found to undertake the task. At 1 p.m,- the Commander-in-chief sum-
moned the officers and told them of his decision to start for Mataram
at 3 p.m.
To avoid the main road whose walls were perforated with loop-holes,
they were to try and reach a street at the S.W. angle of their former
bivouac and running parallel with the high road.
In the interval a deep grave had been dug in the square of the Dewa
temple and 16 men were laid to rest; it was a touching ceremony to
see the dead bodies borne past one by one, each receiving a last
military salute from officers and men; when the last one was laid
beside his comrades, many approached the still open grave to bid
good-bye to the brave fellows they were leaving behind, little thinking-
how soon their own turn would come. Their troubles were only
beginning and the worst were yet before them.
The most seriously wounded?those who could not walk?about 40
in number, were placed in ?tandoes? (stretchers) made of quilts and
their rifles were fastened to the poles. The officers carried the rifles of
the dead men and the locks were taken off those they had to leave
behind; each one was entrusted with some of the money in the
military chest.
Ihe retreat was led by the 2nd lieutenant, Valkenburg, commanding
(the captain and the Ist lieutenant were wounded) the second com-
pany of the 6th battalion Amboynese and this advance column included
Wunnisk, carrying the colours, the Commander-in-chief, the Resident,
captain Mandeis and lieutenant Rotting and de Greve; then came the
two fieldpieces, drawn by a single team and followed by the third com-
pany of the 7th battalion Madurese with the stretchers, while captain
Kamerman with the 4th company of the 6th battalion Europeans covered
the retreat and General van Ham and the Chief of the Staff were with
this portion of the force.
They had hardly left the bivouac when the foremost division was
greeted with an almost overwhelming fire, which caused the Amboynese,
though firing, to advance at such a rapid pace that those in the rear
could not keep up with them. The Commander-in-chief despatched
captain Manders and lieutenant de Greve forward to give orders to
?halt,? the deafening sounds making it however impossible for the com-
mand to be heard. Just at the corner of the street they were brought
to a standstill and the remainder of the troops caught them up; it was
a fatal spot for many; bullets were being fired from loop-holes in every
direction. It was here that the Commander-in-chief lost his brave aide-
de-camp, lieutenant Rotting; after being shot in the leg he was placed
m a tandoe, but a second bullet in the head killed him and they were
obliged to leave his body behind.
finally the artillery came up and they could resume the advance; the
Commander-in-chief issued an order to burn the straw on the walls as
they marched past and thus drive away the foe fighting under their cover;

connection was again lost, the number of casualties was increasing, the
horses were driven frantic with the firing, the stretchers with the woun-
ded were out of sight and the rear guard was nowhere to be seen !
Once more the Commander-in-chief succeeded in staying the progress
of the advanced guard; a section of infantry was ordered to go back
and re-form the line of communication, but it was a fruitless attempt.
To tarry at this juncture was certain death; Jhr. Alting von Geusau,
in command of the Brd section of Madurese fell not very far from
where Kotting lay and lieutenant Boerma of the artillery was shot in the
leg and was placed in a stretcher, but the carriers were both fired at and he
himself had a narrow escape the second time; several other carriers were
killed and many soldiers wounded but the Commander-in-chief appeared
invulnerable. The situation was now clear to all: they were effectually cut
off from the rear, their only chance of salvation lay in front of them
and without waiting for the word of command they dashed forward for
dear life; the dead were left on the guns. They marched onward under
the unceasing fire of the enemy; here and there they succeeded in knocking
down pieces of wall and driving away those sheltered behind it; in
crossing a slokan (small river) they were nearly forced to leave the
cannons behind, the horses could not pull them along ; lieutenant de Greve
came to the rescue with a few of his men, and got them safely over.
Having surmounted this difficulty they were face to face with another:
beneath the annihilating fire of the Balinese they had to demolish an
earthwork thrown across their path to prevent their reaching the high
road from Tjakra Nagara to Mataram. Just on their arrival on the
main road, the troops were met with such heavy fire, that the horses
bolted straight for the old bivouac at Mataram, dragging with them gun
carriages and guns; the wounded were only saved by slipping off, for
within very few minutes the horses were in the enemy?s hands in the
sawah bivouac, which to our consternation we discovered to be no longer
occupied by our troops.
Meanwhile signals from the Dewa-temple advised us of the retreat
of the 7th Battalion; pursued by the enemy?s fire the Commander-in-
chief with his few followers found a refuge there at about 5 p.m.
What had happened in the interval to those cut off from the main
body ?
Hie task of Captain Kamerman commanding the rear guard was no
easy one; it was slow work carrying the wounded through the narrow
doorway separating the higher from the lower bivouac and the foe
concentrated their fire on this passage with fatal results to many, amongst
whom was General van Ham. The Chief of the Staff seeing the utter
impossibility of sending any more stretchers forward gave the order
to return within the temple precincts; but instructed Lieutenant Hardie
to go with his section and carry back to the temple the wounded who
were on the road. The first person he saw was lieutenant von Geusau
and proceeded to bind his artery; whilst thus occupied von Geusau
received another bullet in the breast and his sufferings were over.


In a quarter of an hour?s time Captain Kamerman renewed his attempt
to advance; such a heavy shower of fire was poured upon them, that in
spite of his desire to join the first division, Major Hamerster ordered
him once again to return.
It was clear they were cut off from the Commander-in-chief and they
now found themselves only three sections strong and 40 wounded, sur-
rounded by hundreds of enemies and with no provisions to speak of.
The 4th section under lieutenant Hardie had caught up with the
advance and with the wounded General van Ham had joined the Com-
mander-in-chief at the Mataram Dewa-temple. As the second in com-
mand was about to pass through the narrow doorway, he remarked;
?a few greetings are bound to be exchanged!? and five minutes later
he was fatally wounded in the chest and in the leg; the heavily built
man was laid in a stretcher and after enquiring where he was hurt he
never spoke again; two fusiliers with praiseworthy disregard for their
own safety succeeded in carrying him to the dewa-temple where he
expired shortly after his arrival, but sustained by the rites and last
sacraments of his Church, for the General was a Catholic. Thus fell a
brave soldier and a righteous man, whose mind was too noble to suspect
evil of his neighbour, even when that neighbour was a native. In him
we lost a courageous leader and a general genuinely beloved and
respected by his men and by all who came into contact with him.
Let us see what had occurred to cause the evacuation of the bivouac
in the rice field and the occupation of the Dewa-temple by the 7th battalion.
On the night of 25 ?26 August they at once turned out when they
heard the firing at Tjakra Nagara; the Ist company on the high road,
the 2nd on the East and the 4th on the West side. The night having-
passed by without further disturbance Major von Blommestein com-
mandant of the bivouac, ordered Captain Jonker with his company ?the
4th ?to make a reconnoisance in the direction of Tjakra at daybreak.
The company marched out of the bivouac and were about to form
into a square when they were unexpectedly fired upon from the Eastern
front of Mataram and in a minute?s time three men were killed and
four dangerously wounded; while replying to the enemy?s fire they
withdrew into the bivouac which now became the object of the assailants,
who a couple of hours later were supported by their forces firing from
the West front of Tjakra.
As will be remembered it was about this time that there was a lull
for the troops at Tjakra, so it is evident the Balinese were now directing
all their strength against the bivouac of the 7th battalion.
In a very short time there were 7 killed and 17 wounded and fears
were entertained lest the sheds roofed with bamboo and paddy straw
should soon be set on fire.
A council of war is held at 2.80 p.m. wherein it was decided to retreat
to the Dewa-temple, 600 metres South East of the present position and
the plan was carried out an hour later under cover of the 4th company
stationed South of the high road and of 20 volunteers, who, headed by


lieutenant Fransen of this company, effected a diversion. Through a breach
made in the walls of Mataram by the artillery this small force furiously
attacked the enemy, forced them to retreat to some distance and kept
their attention fully occupied until all the wounded had been transferred
to the temple but four of these brave soldiers paid for their courage
with their lives. All the provisions, material, and even the military chest
had been left behind in this precipitate retreat and only one of the
two fieldpieces was saved, and this had been accomplished by the gunners
themselves; the other, to which the horses were attached with difficulty,
was lost, the horses terrified by the firing, having bolted with it towards
Tjakra Nagara.
One of the last to reach the temple was the Reverend Father Vogel,
the Catholic priest, who under the heaviest fire had faithfully assisted
both dying and wounded, of whatever faith or country.
Once inside the Dewa-temple the first thing was to bore loop-holes
in the walls and prepare for defence as well as possible under the
?circumstances and it was at this juncture in their affairs that General
Vetter and his detachment found shelter there.
It is now time to see how the columns sent to the interior
fared during these hostilities. As was usual, van Bijlevelt had been
out on a day?s march from Sukarara and the evening (the2sth August
was a Saturday) was spent more cheerily than usual, an extra bottle
of wine and cards being thoroughly enjoyed, as all were looking for-
ward to their first day of rest on the Sunday. At half past eleven all
retired to their. simple couches of bamboo, covered with imitation
leather and a blanket. They were roused at 1.15 a.m. by the arrival
of the spy bringing the orders of the Commander-in-chief to retreat
at once to Mataram; these were the instructions sent on receiving in-
formation of the attack from captain Schmidhamer.
Further sleep was out of the questions and all were lost in conjec-
tures concerning the reasons for this order; at an early hour the bivouac
was broken up and an inventory taken of a six day?s food supply brought
in the previous day and now entrusted to the care of a Sassak chief?
Gura Bangkol ?for storage in his kampong at Praja, distant an hour
and a half.
The retreat started at 9a. m.; but it was 1 p. m. when Kediri was
reached; the men were tired out from the marches of the previous days
and advancing equipped for defence was a farther source of fatigue and
loss of time. On leaving the kampong sounds of tiring at Tjakra
were distinctly audible and in reply to our questions all sorts of con-
fused answers were given by the Sassaks on the road; we were in-
formed that fighting had been going on both at Mataram and Tjakra
Nagara since the previous night, that our side had sustained many losses
in killed and wounded but had occupied the poeri at >Tjakra, etc.
On hearing this the Commander of the column decided to make
straight for this point to relieve his comrades.


At 2 p.m. the column was within a couple of hundred metres of the
S.Babak (river) they were marching along a narrow kampong track, ?through
the dessa of Glogor ?hemmed in on the one side by an impenetrable
thickset hedge, on the other by a deep ravine; in front, on the left, stood
a ?missigit? (a mosque). Suddenly the enemy opened fire in the front,
in the rear, on either side of this serried mass of men and Major van
Bijlevelt, the commander, was the first to be wounded and the command
was taken over by Captain Creutz Lechleitner, who immediately ordered
the storming of the missigit whence the fire was the heaviest.
As soon as the wall dividing it from the road had been demolished
by the engineers, lieutenants van Kappen and Musquetier entered with the
Europeans and took up position with their revolvers under two windows
of the missigit; just as Musquetier was pursuing the enemy into closer
quarters he was suddenly killed by a bullet piercing his heart. Mean-
while the artillery had taken up their position and driven back the
enemy on the right of the kampong, so that after ten minutes the
advance resumed. It was a difficult matter to cross a river sixty metres
wide and every man up to his waist in water; the gun carriages were
dragged under the water and the guns placed on the mules? backs, but
immediately replaced on the carriages on the opposite bank. The enemy
still continued to take advantage of their protected positions to render
the retreat as difficult as possible; the march continued through narrow
roads bordered on either side by thickset hedges, behind which the clay
and stone houses served as so many points of attack; before entering
each kampong it was subjected to artillery-fire. The entire march was
made amid alternate offensive and defensive operations; sometimes the
houses and homesteads where the firing seemed most determined were
stormed and the enemy fell back, but no sooner, had the besieging
detachment joined the main division than the hostile attacks were
renewed. After crossing sundry other small rivers the kampong of Laboe
Api and with it the open rice plantations S. of Tjakra Nagara were
reached and here again the column was informed by Sassaks that our
troops occupied the poeri there. From this point to Tjakra proper
there was a cessation of the firing; only here and there a few Balinese
might be seen taking flight to their kampongs. At 5 p. m. they were
at the South entrance to Tjakra and entertained no doubts about finding the
remaining companies of the 6th batailion, but to make quite certain the
trumpeters signalled ?6th battalion.? There was no answer; everything
was still, still as death and no living being was visible; they caught
sight of a woman running aw T ay behind one of the first houses on the
left. On a table in the middle of the road were some cans of water
which no one touched for fear of poison.
In spite of this somewhat lugubrious reception they entered the town
triumphantly to the sound of drum and bugle; as soon as the whole
column had passed the gates the storm burst all round them; a double
row of loop-holes, some breast high, others at the height of the knee,
were made all along the walls and the bullets poured on to the men


from over the walls and through them, behind them, in front of them.
Orders were given to ?halt?, the guns were formed in battery against
the walls within a few steps of one another; the walls here were not
so substantial and easily gave way; the enemy was driven from wall to
wall and the v pieces were pushed forward and placed in new positions.
Slow but steady progress was made; the dead had to be left behind
but all the wounded were carried in tandoes and where these failed
were either supported along by the soldiers, or if necessary, carried on
their backs; the artillery fortunately sustained no losses here, though
the lion s share of the work devolved upon them and the Balinese
dnected their tire continuously on them when they realized they w r ere
doing them so much damage. After taking two hours to accomplish a
distance usually occupying from twelve to fifteen minutes, they arrived
within 400 metres South of the poeri and as it was evident there were
no troops here, they proceeded straight to Mataram.
In spite of the fast increasing darkness the Balinese kept us busy
implying to their attacks, but the troops marched in perfect order and
discipline, displaying magnificent training, both moral y and physically.
1 he infantry now had to continue the defence, it being too dark for
the artillery; at about 8 p.m. they arrived at the old saw 7 ah bivouac,
but instead of friends, they were once again met by foes. After a few 7
anxious moments they heard the signal of the 6th battalion coming from
the neighbouring Dewa-temple! Here they w 7 ere received with joy and
amazement at their plucky retreat; they had had 16 men killed, amongst
whom Musquetier whose body they had carried with them and there
were 85 wounded; they had also saved all their guns, weapons, ammu-
nition, etc. which w r as indeed a feat to be proud of, considering all
the obstacles met with from beginning to end.
TV e will now quote from Rogge for further information regarding
the troops assembled in the temple.
Now we found ourselves cooped up in the Dew 7 a-temple, surrounded
and threatened on all sides by bloodthirsty enemies. Our men had bored
holes in the outer walls, their guns w T ere placed in them ready to be
fired at the word of command.
?A sentinel w 7 as placed in a tall tree in the first enclosure and was
constantly replaced to ensure accurate and continuous knowledge of the
enemy's movements.
?The killed and wounded laid in the second enclosure, while
the General Staff and many officers, tired and exhausted, were standing
oi lying close together on the ground in the first. No wonder that
many felt disheartened at this depressing sight and no one expected to
leave this refuge alive.
It caused me no small astonishment to behold General Vetter
leclining in an easy chair in the first enclosure and settling himself
down for a nap after his cigar, which he had smoked as calmly and
dehbeiately as if he w r ere at home. The Resident w r as Ring on the


ground not far from him, with his head partially resting against my
legs and I myself was wedged in between two men, one of whom had
fallen fast asleep where he stood.
?We were all suffering agonies from thirst, the only water obtainable
in the temple being almost too muddy to drink, besides which it was
impossible to move through the closely packed troops.
?To remain in this situation could not be thought of; there was no
food at all and we were running short of ammunition, having left every
thing behind in our flight, as the 7th batt. had been compelled to do
when deserting the bivouac at Mataram, where even the last consign-
ment of the war indemnity, taken there for safety on the previous
night, fell into the enemy?s hands. Great praise is therefore due to
the officers of the 6th battalion who though in danger of their lives
divided the contents of the military chest, each one carrying in his
pockets all he could. The fieldpieces, with the exception of one, which
was however left behind next day, were in the hands of the enemy, as
well as the ammunition and all our property. My pocket handkerchief
was all I owned and still did good service in binding up the wounds
of one of the soldiers.
?A council was held at which it was decided to push across the
sawahs to Ampenan next morning, the retreat to be led by Major Rost
van Tonningen.
?A short interval of respite was given us and only a stray bullet was
fired from time to time.
?As it grew darker w r e could distinguish sounds of firing come from
Tjakra; at first they w T ere very faint, but as they came nearer and grew
louder we concluded that van Bijlevelt?s column was advancing towards
Mataram and we were right in our surmises, they joined us shortly after
lp.ni ? We have already described their march. ...
?It was a difficult task to find sheltered places for the newly-arrived
?tandoes? with the wounded, for no lights were allowed and as little
noise as possible. Had the Balinese attacked us from over the walls
on that dark night not one man could have escaped; we were saved
from this crushing disaster by their love of plunder and greed. It was
far more in keeping with their natural propensities to sack the bivouac
than to expose themselves to the perils of a night attack; they must
have been amply rewarded for their night?s work, becoming possessed
as they did of many valuable and curious objects.
?I was told later by an artillery man who had got into the deserted
bivouac by mistake and hidden himself beneath some straw, that he
heard the Balinese break open chests and carry off the contents.
?Preparations were made for an early retreat next morning, but
before starting there remained a sad and painful duty to be performed;
during the still of night a grave had been dug in the third enclosure
and there we buried the gallant general Van Ham, lieutenant Musquetier
and all those who had succumbed to their wounds after reaching the
temple.? ?Those brave men rest beneath the shadow of a giant waringin

spot. Close to the tree there now stands a memorial tablet and on its
surface are written words of hope and words which tell of wiped-out


shame, of fame and victory, and of a new era in the history of our
Indian army!
?The order was issued for a company of infantry to head the march,
followed by the stretchers with the wounded under military escort. The
entire train was to be covered by a second company of infantry.
The appearance of the first soldier leaving the temple was the signal
for a new attack, making it clear that an orderly retreat would be
impossible. Consequently the mountain artillery under lieutenant Becking
came into action against the Balinese and effectively silenced them for
some time and the column fell into line; they soon reached the open
sawahs and making a long round to avoid the walls of Mataram, went
by way of Pasingahan and Sekar Bela and the river Antjar to Ampenan.
The enemy continued to hamper the retreat by firing at us from
Mataram, Poenia and Pagasangan and now and again a halt was necessary
to repulse some who were bold enough to assail us in the open. The
country we had to traverse was far from being a well-kept even road;
here we were ankle-deep in mud, there we were up to our waists in
water; but in spite of all the difficulties our casualties during this six
hours? march only amounted to 20 killed and wounded and this excellent
result is in a great measure owing to the skilful leadership of Major
Rost van Tonningen. We were also much indebted to the services of
two Sassaks, whom we met and who guided us along the safest and
shortest route to Sekar Bela; undoubtedly these poor people have
deserved well of us; it was they who obstinately declined to negotiate
with the Balinese rajahs and bound themselves by oath never to submit
to their rule again. Prom their own past experiences they warned the
General-Staff not to put faith in the promises and finally they warned
us of the impending danger, thus saving the expeditionary land forces
from complete extinction.
?The condition of our wounded was most distressing, many having
to be carried on quilts fastened to bamboos or guns, the number of
tandoes proving insufficient; the discomfort of their cramped positions
was added to by the rays of a broiling hot sun and our convicts were
not always over gentle or careful in their movements, rendered especially
unsteady by the inequalities of the ground. A twenty minutes? halt
was thoroughly appreciated, every man sitting or lying in the most
comfortable position he could find, but we were all suffering from
intense thirst, which led many to drink the muddy sawah water, after-
wards productive of so many cases of colic. In spite of all the hard-
ships the soldiers kept in first-rate spirits and I cannot say too much in
praise of the excellent good fellowship displayed amongst them towards
one another and particularly towards the wounded; after I had sprained
my foot I leaned on one of the convicts, but no sooner was this noticed
than a couple of our sturdy fellows came forward to support me. I
never heard a single word of murmur or complaint and every order was
obeyed with the utmost precision and punctuality.
?Finally we heard voices from the front shouting; ?We are nearly


there! In the distance we see a white flag and our own beloved
tricolor! ? ?
?Never surely in all our lives had we looked upon our country?s flag
with such sincere feelings of affection and gratitude; it was flying gaily
from above the walls of Sekar Bela, promising us freedom and safety;
the Sassaks wished to convey to us that we should soon be treading on
friendly territory.
?We pushed forward with renewed vigor and hope though still pur-
sued by the enemy?s fire from Poenia and to our deep sorrow we
suffered losses to the last, amongst the victims being Lieutenant Ter
Bruggen Plugenholtz, shot in the leg.
?Once inside the kampong the order to ?rest? w'as given and most
gladly did every man seek repose and shelter beneath the shady trees,
where the Sassaks brought us rice and cocoa-nut milk; the refreshment
was sorely needed and certainly appreciated, this being one of those
occasions when ?hunger is the best sauce!?
?In a little while we resumed our march along a shady road leading
to the beach; here and there we caught sight of a Sassak man or
woman watching us with pity and curiosity and in an hour?s time we
reached Tandjong Karang.?
Here we must take leave of Rogge, who was conveyed with the Resident
by boat to Ampenan, thence with a number of wounded to Surabaya
on the Maetsuijcker.
The Commander-in-chief went in a man-of-war pinnace to H. M. St.
Emma , on which he proceeded to Ampenan. No sooner had the Com-
mander of the Naval forces seen the soldiers approaching the beach,
than he despatched medical assistance and the more seriously wounded
were placed on the boats and taken to the hospital or to the sick
transport ship.
The remainder of the column still had a tedious march before them
across the dry sand and the river Antjar before reaching the bivouac at
Ampenan. They were met by the column which had been in occupation
and who can doubt of the joyfulness of that meeting. After a march
of seven and a half hours they reached the bivouac without having
allowed a single one of their wounded to fall into the enemy?s hands.
We look upon this retreat as another of those wonderful events well
worth rescuing from oblivion!
It had been a period of extreme anxiety in the bivouac at Ampenan
when they were warned by the firing of 25th ?26th August that hostilities
had broken out in the interior. After the departure of the 2nd and
4th Companies under Van Lawick, all that remained in this open unfor-
tified bivouac excepting a detachment of cavalry, were the two companies
of the 9th battalion, but without a single piece of ordnance and of the
naval force, there were only the ?Koningin Emma ? and the ?Prim
Hendrik ?, for, in consequence of the succesful turn of affairs, the force
had been gradually dismissed. The , the , the

and the Borneo had all in turn left for Surabaya, the three last for
repairs and thither too had both despatch boats returned in the middle
of August, their services no longer being needed.
The night 25th?26th August had passed by uneventfully at Ampenan;
however, next morning the Commander of the Marine, captain EL Quispel
of the Navy, judging from the attack at Mataram and Tjakra Nagara
that Ampenan?s turn would come next, took upon himself to disembark
the parties from the Koningin Emma and the Brins Hendrik ; they com-
posed a force of 200 men and four guns and were placed under the
command of C. A. Dominicus, Naval Lieutenant of the Ist class, although
the commandant of the bivouac at Ampenan was his senior in the
service.

demanded it. The naval brigade was first stationed on the high road
to Mataram, but later on in the bastions of the new earthworks; the
cavalry were sent out to reconnoitre and soon fell in with the enemy
in occupation of the main road to Mataram; they withdrew as soon as
one of their horses was wounded. ... We refrain from remarks for the
moment.
In anticipation of an almost immediate attack, it was considered more
prudent to abstain from any attempt to open up communications with
Mataram; however nothing happened until the morning of the 27th
when they received information (brought by convicts) from the Com-
mander-in-chief of his retreat to the l)ewa temple and instructions to
set out provided with tandoes and ammunition to meet the retreating
column pushing forward to Ampenan; as we have seen the order was
executed and the troops met South of the river Djangkok.
There was very little rest in the bivouac on the night of 27th --28 th


August; after the suspense and horrors of the last two days it is not
to be wondered at if nerves were unstrung and a general feeling of
apprehension current among the troops; frequently they imagined the
enemy was rising up from out of the darkness and the sentries kept up
an almost incessant alarm. In the early hours of the night the approach
of the 9th battalion was signalled and a portion of van Lawick?s column
reached the bivouac with many wounded; a little later another portion
arrived, but many were still missing for several days
On the 26th August van Lawick?s column ignorant of the stirring
events at Tjakra, went on a long march; the Commandant went that
day with the 2nd company ?captain Lindgreen?s natives ?to Swangi not
far south of Sakra, to hold a final conference with all the chiefs of the
neighbouring kampongs. The following day ?Sunday ?was to be a day
of rest and the return to Ampenan was fixed for the Monday. The
chief of the staff of this column, Captain Willemstijn, and Lieutenant van
der Plank rode out in the morning to Praga to become better acquainted
with the line of communication to Batu Klian; the European company ?
the 4th, under Captain Christan ?had remained behind in the bivouac
with the surgeon dr. Ujlaki.
The doctor?s services were really not much in demand amongst the
troops during the time we were in Lombock, but he was kept extremely
busy by the inhabitants. His ambulance was daily besieged by Sassaks
coming to ask for remedies for all sorts of diseases, old ulcers on the
leg, running sores, neglected skin eruptions and every variety of ailment;
the demand for medicines and bandages soon exhausted the available
supply, which had to be replenished; the 4 nurses would have been
unable to get through their work, had they not been supplemented by
volunteers from amongst the ranks.
The presence of the troops had helped to alleviate the sufferings of
the Sassaks in other ways too, for, daily, hundreds of half starved natives,
who had not seen or tasted rice for months, came to the bivouac with
their emaciated and half-famished children, grateful had they only been
permitted to eat the crumbs that fell from the soldiers? table. The
Commander had rice cooked for them in large kettles and would have
had meat cooked also, but they preferred eating it raw, rather than
wait! (a fine cow could be bought here for a couple of sovereigns or
thereabouts).
The soldiers often shared their meals with these poor people and
supplied them with what clothes they could spare.
On his return from the march somewhat later than usual (3.80 p.m.),
van Lawick found the letter of instructions from the Commander-in-
chief; it had been given a conspicuous place by Captain Willemstijn,
who had received it from the Chief of Batu Klian, Raden Ginawan.
Finding he had a little time to spare after his ride to Praja, he
returned by way of Surabaya, where he paid a long promised visit to
the Chief, who, after a short conversation, handed it to the captain,


saying it had been delivered to him by a Sassak. He furthermore told
Willemstijn that war had broken out between the Balinese and the
company ?but this news the captain refused to believe and as soon as
he reached the bivouac he lay down to rest.
No sooner had Major van Lawick mastered the contents of the letter
than he roused Captain Willemstijn and after a short consultation it
was decided that the column must be in marching order for Ampenan
at 5 p. m.
The order was cheerfully received by the men who, notwithstanding
the day?s fatigue set to work to have everything ready at the appointed
hour. Meanwhile the commanding officer assembled his captains and
read them the Commander-in-chief?s letter; he sent a note to Lieutenant
Van der Zwaan of the topographical service, who was absent surveying
in the neighbourhood and not expected at Batu Klian until next day,
informing him of the altered circumstances, and instructing him to avoid
Tjakra but to make for the East coast, where a government steamer should
be sent to fetch him. This forethought on the part of the Chief saved
the life of this clever young officer and it was acts of this nature Avhicli
so endeared van Lawick to his men.
They left the bivouac at 5 p. m.; as there were only two invalids to
be carried in tandoes, they marched briskly and without interruptions until
dusk, when halt was made in the kampong of Surabaya. Before day-
break the Commander was warned of the arrival of Mami Moesti Hadji,
one of the three Sassak Chiefs whom he had left with the Commander-
in-chief; Mami narrated how he had fled at the first shot, but could not
explain the cause of the outburst, beyond the fact that there were many
bad people at Narmada who wanted to kill the company. The troops
were soon on their feet again and after a short breakfast of bread and
coffee they started and at 11 a. m. they reached the river Babak; hardly had
the first man got through the brush wood when the enemy opened
fire, besides which, preparatory to the arrival of the troops, they
had thrown up earthworks and put up a palisade of bamboo and
prickly shrubs at the landing place; however breastworks and palisade
soon gave way before a couple of salvos from the infantry and the
energy of the engineer, who soon cleared the passage, enabling the
entire column to land without loss; from this point onward their progress
was much slower, for both infantry and artillery had to drive away
the enemy whilst advancing and at Narmada the firing increased in
intensity and it was here that the column suffered their first loss, a native
artillery soldier and a mule being fatally wounded. The artillery brought
their battery into position on a height near the river and opened fire on Nar-
mada to cover the passage of the troops and in spite of all the enemy?s guns
they reached the high road to Tjakra at about 3 p. m.; the fire of the
Balinese diminished gradually and ceased entirely as they approached the
capital, so they had enjoyed comparative immunity for an hour or two;
they were at the entrance gates of the town at half past three, there
were no signs of disturbance, the enemy apparently was driven back.


The Commander of the column was so convinced that he was within
easy reach of headquarters that he discussed with Dr. Ujlaki, the
advisability of requesting the Commander-in-chief to allow the wounded
to proceed to Ampenan that evening, as they could be better cared for,
even should the remainder of the column be ordered to stay at Tjakra.
The wide gate (3,5 metres) had been narrowed by filling up the
opening with bamboo, but as this had been done partly when they had
passed through before not much was thought about it; the captain of
the Staff however drew the Commander?s attention to the fact that the
entrance had been further narrowed by newly added bamboo and was
now reduced to little over 1 metre; yet the entry was made in good
spirits, in the anticipation of soon meeting friends and comrades and
enjoying a well-deserved rest after the prolonged march. Not a single
Balinese was visible in the street but this was not considered as any
thing unusual at this hour of day; but it certainly was curious that all
the doors leading to the homesteads should be closed, they generally being
thrown wide open and no one was at the market, at other times so busy
The greater part of the column had advanced through the gates and
the foremost division had reached the bend in the road, when a shot
was fired which was the enemy?s signal for a general discharge from every
one of their pieces; here too they had loopholes all along the line and
through these and from over the walls and from the trees burst forth
the murderous fire!
? Forward! Forward! as quick as possible! ? ordered the Commander who
was at the head of the column, hoping to find a refuge for his men in
the old bivouac: he turned round to tell captain Willemstijn to transmit the
order and in another minute he lay mortally wounded and the Ist lieutenant
Van der Staay met the same fate not many yards off. Captain Willemstijn
carried the instructions to the Commander of the guard, but here in the
second bend of the road the firing was so severe on all sides that Captain
Christan stationed his men in a small deserted Dewa temple on the north
side of the road. While this small space afforded a temporary refuge
to the vanguard and the two mountain guns with Lieutenant Vis, Cap-
tains Willemstijn and Christan under cover of a section of infantry, pro-
ceeded to reconnoitre in the direction of the cross-roads at Tjakra, but
within 5 to 600 metres ?of this point they perceived that the bivouac of
the 6th battalion was deserted .... True, Kamerman?s company was still in
the temple and they had heard Van Lawick?s advancing column; later
on we shall see the reason of their silence.
What was originally the bivouac was now a mass of ruins strewn with
dead bodies and dead horses..., what a gruesome sight! what a crushing
disappointment! There was not much time for reflection, death was
threatening them too from every side; quickly they hastened back to
their men in the dewa temple, hoping to be able to restore communi-
cation with the main division and the rear-guard.
The horses and mules maddened with the roar of the guns were rush-
ing about wildly, dragging everything along with them in their frantic

efforts to get away from the fire; they got up, stumbled over dead
bodies, knocked down the soldiers and added to the universal distraction;
it is a terrible, a desperate fight for life! And, drowning the moans
and sighs of dying and wounded were heard the war cries of the Balinese,
their shouts of exultant joy and the rattling of the guns.
It was impossible to make way through such a scene, so they
waited, in hopes that the rear guard would soon join them and shortly a
section of infantry under lieutenant Brockman, despatched by Captain
Lindgreen, came up and informed them that van Lawick was dead.
The command now passed to Captain Christan; with the help of the
two pieces of mountain artillery they kept the enemy at bay for a
little but the Balinese succeeded in piercing walls that command those of
the Dewa temple and screened by these they fired straight into the midst
of the division; the ammunition was getting used up; many were wounded
and many were killed; the situation was fast growing unbearable and to
wait for Lindgreen and his men any longer would have meant certain
death to all assembled there.
Neither a forward nor a backward move was possible; so they decided
to move sidewards (to the North) and fight their way through the
enemy at the point of the bayonet if needs be and reach the open
sawali, where at least they would not have to fight an enemy protected
by walls.
The wounded, 28 in number, were carried to the northern exit, and
the open sawah was soon reached, notwithstanding the incessant fire; a
halt was made and the signal constantly repeated for the ? 2nd company
to assemble ? (Lindgreen?s), but it was in vain, they received no reply!
They daied not wait here any longer and even Lieutenant Broekman was
by this time convinced that he could not return to his column and must
throw in his lot with Captain Christan.
Ihe retreat now proceeded in good order in a northeast direction
across sawahs, ravines and kalis (small rivers); they had only a few
cartridges left, still the confidence of the men in their officers continued
unabated and where the latter lead the former unhesitatingly followed.
Finally they reached the road to Lingsar?and fell in with a crowd of Balinese,
who allowed them to proceed on their way unmolested and only one shot
was filed. How is this extraordinary behaviour to be accounted for? Were they
afraid to meet our troops in the open field ? The march was continued
Northwards across an extensive sawah and after careful reconnoitring
through a bomboo plantation and then again across another sawah;
presently considerable astonishment and anxiety are felt at the appear-
ance of several natives waving white flags the meaning of which one is
at a loss to understand. All doubts were soon dissipated on discovering
that they were held by some friendly Sassaks from a neighbouring kampong,
where they provided the men plentifully with water and cocoa nuts;
needless to say that this timely hospitality was vastly appreciated by
all and the refreshing water was particularly welcome to the poor
sufferers in the tandoes. Night had overtaken them and still there was


a long march before them and who could say to what further hostilities
they might not be exposed? They gladly accepted the offer of the hadji,
the chief of the kampong, to accompany them some little distance,
after which he appointed two Sassaks to serve as guides along the dark
unknown road. At Bp. m. they could distinguish the electric search light of
the opium cruiser lying in the roadstead of Ampenan; this sight filled
the men with fresh energy, although it was two hours longer before they
reached the strand, owing to the darkness and the inequalities of the
ground. Ignorant of the situation at Ampenan Captain Christan signals
?9th battalion, 4th company, the doctor,? hoping at the same time to
attract the notice of the steamers, in which he is successful, for shortly
afterwards a boat from the ? Koningin Emma ? nears the shores but
owing to the roar of the surf they cannot hear what the ofhcer shouts
to them. The signal of the 9th battalion was repeated on board the
steamers.... had the comrades of the 9th whom they had left at
Ampenan embarked ? They hardly knew what to expect; after the
horrors they had witnessed at Tjakra nothing seemed too bad to antici-
pate. But no! their signals were also answered from the bivouac, where
the exhausted column arrived at about 10 p. m,
Great were the rejoicings at the safe arrival of a portion of van
Lawick?s column, but a general gloom spread over the bivouac on
hearing of the death of the Chief of the column and of their youthful
and promising comrades Kalff and van der Staay and so many others.
The grief of all was intensified by the painful anxiety concerning the
fate of Lindgreen?s column .... Captain Christan volunteered to start
with fresh troops to relieve him, but the Commander-in-chief considered
it would be too reckless....
Let us see what happened to Lindgreen; the same obstacles which
prevented Captain Christan?s going back to the column prevented Lind-
green?s advancing; he waited where he was for a little, but the men
around him were rapidly being decimated and the ambulance was
crowded; doctor Ujlaki performed his duties unflinchingly amidst showers
of bullets and was ably assisted by nurse Loverinck; the little band
under Lieutenant de Graaf covering the ambulance was growing less and
less. It was evident that to linger here was certain death for all and
Lindgreen gave the order for all to retreat into a small dewa-temple,
the doors of which were open; quick as lightning the ambulance and
the native soldiers obeyed the order and once again a heathen
temple provided asylum to our troops! They were only just in time,
for by now the Balinese intoxicated with success were about to hurl
themselves bodily against this handful of men and very nearly managed
to push forward into the temple with the last of our soldiers. .. . their
reception was not of a nature to encourage the attempt! Thwarted in
this they tried to climb the walls but this too they had to give up, for
every man whose head appeared was instantly shot down. This temporary
security afforded time to review their position; inside the temple are

Lieutenant de Jong in the Sawah


five officers: the Commandant, Lieutenants de Graaf, de J ong en van
der Plank and the medical officer, Doctor Ujlaki; there are 80 soldiers
* il
in fighting condition, besides 40 wounded and about 10 convicts. They
set to work to put the temple in a state of defence, sentries were posted
and the wounded were cared for as well as possible without instruments
and bandages, all of which have been lost, while there was not a single
drop of water!
The misery of the patients, many of whom were delirious, baffles
description.
Unaware of the full extent of our disasters, this little band of men
continued to hope for relief and convinced that the Commander-in-
chief would send a company to their assistance if he kneAv their where-
abouts, Lindgreen decided to send a small detachment under Lieutenant
de Jong to Ampenan to inform him of their position.
Although wounded, de Jong started at daybreak with two non-
commissioned officers and twenty-two smart native soldiers. Silently
and crawling along they left the temple, but the enemy ever on
the look out greeted them in the usual fashion .... De Jong with
his small force, unhampered by baggage or Avounded boldly proceeded
at a swifter pace, only halting at intervals to direct a feAV bullets towards
the foe, keeping them more or less at bay until he reached the northern
frontier of Tjakra N agar a. Here they crossed the river which had given
Captain Christan?s column so much trouble, and advanced 400 metres
across the Sawah without having sustained any actual losses, but now
de Jong perceived that his men were thoroughly done up and not a feAV
were Avounded; rest was imperative, and he decided to halt behind some
ditches until dark. It was 5.80 p. m. and the men threw themselves on
the ground while their captain watched over them; leaning his elbows
on the ground, resting his head on his hands he glanced across the plain
in front of him, thinking the enemy Avould never dare attack him
across it, but nevertheless they did send projectiles towards him and
he himself received a bullet through his right arm. He did not on
this account relinquish his post, but let a couple of his men reply at
intervals, desisting as evening approached, it being essential to be sparing
of the ammunition. When it Avas quite dark he awakened the sleeping
men and they continued their march in the still of night.
They had not left their resting place long Avhcn they saAV a crowd of
Balinese approach it... . they Avere intensely disappointed to find no
plunder, nothing remained to show Avhere they had halted but a few
drops of blood.
Wil d shouts of rage and vexation filled the air and brandishing their
torches they started off in pursuit of the detachment, their flaming lights
serving as admirable targets for our soldiers. The Balinese soon discovered
they were getting the worst of it and returned dejectedly to Tjakra Nagara
fearing lest those in the temple, might likewise escape them!
De Jong knew there were still many dangers to be faced before
reaching Ampenan; fortunately however the inhabitants of the kampongs

were so occupied in their rejoicings over their recent victories that the
troops remained unnoticed; of course they avoided all the beaten tracks
which made their progress doubly slow and difficult.
Finally, when their courage was at its lowest ebb and fatigue and loss
of blood rendered it almost impossible to advance any further, they heard
the rolling of the sea; what glorious music! The shore was close now
and with one supreme effort they reached it... .
They can already distinguish the lights of Ampenan and the bivouac
is not far and presently ?it is 5 a. m.?they hear the well-known bugle call.
To make quite sure Lieutenant de Jong advanced with a young sergeant
and called to the sentry. . . . but whether he did not recognize him or
did not believe him?we must bear in mind the wrought up feelings
prevalent in the entire bivouac?he answered the call by firing and alas!
with fatal result, for the poor young sergeant fell lifeless into the arms
of his lieutenant at the very moment
when he had reached a place of safety!
what cruel irony of fate!
The Commander-in-chief received the
heroic little band with delight but a
disappointment awaited de Jong; General
Vetter refused to send troops into the
centre of the enemy?s country to rescue
the comrades left behind in the Dewa-
temple, it would have been too hazard-
ous an undertaking to diminish the
strength of the garrison at Ampenan
and the young lieutenant had to submit
to circumstances. His condition was
such as to necessitate his admission to
the field hospital and soon after he
was sent back to Surabaya to regain

his health. Appreciation and gratitude for his pluck were fully testified
to by the hearty handshakes of his comrades who saw him off; but
nothing touched him so much as the sincere demonstrations of affection
and gratitude of the men who had followed him, and looked upon him
as having saved their lives.
Before returning to Captain Lindgreen, we will go back to the troops
left in the old Dewa-temple, near the former bivouac at Tjakra. Captain
Kamerman was here with all his company excepting the section under
Hardie, who had followed General van Ham. In addition to the officers
of the company, there were the Chief of the Staff, Major Hamerster
and Dr. Janssen. There were 40 wounded, 11 dangerously, some
servants, a few soldiers? wives, a couple of Balinese belonging to the
Resident?s suite and 14 convicts. In crossing one of the squares to see
that his orders Avere executed Captain Kamerman was badly shot in the
thigh, but was able to resume command when bandaged. They waited
patiently a couple of hours and then heard the heavy fire approach the


bivouac and concluded it was Bijleveldt?s column; preparations were
hastily begun to effect a junction and they signalled to attract attention...
Did the advancing column not hear ? . . .
The sounds grew fainter and fainter. ... Alas! it was soon manifest
from the firing that the column was going westwards!
Their hopes were disappointed! The night was spent very miserably
and though there were no complaints, still the men were very depressed
and downcast; and no wonder, after the alarming events of the last
24 hours.
If they were protected from the enemy?s bullets, there was another
enemy that made itself felt in a most painful manner: thirst! True,
that in risking one?s life and going to a deserted kampong close by, a
little salt water and a few cocoa-nuts could be obtained, but this was
only a very temporary relief.
They still hoped for deliverance, either from Mataram, or from the
column retreating from Batu Klian.
Thus in anxious waiting did the morning and the afternoon of the
27th August go by.
In the afternoon they really heard heavy firing in an Easterly direction.
That must be Van La wick?s column. Joyful expectation filled the
hearts of all!
They could discern by the movements of the horses that misfortune
had overtaken the column; by signalling it would have been easy to
notify their presence in the Dewa temple for as we have seen Captains
Christan and Willemstijn were not far off ?but Major Hamerster
taking into consideration the fact that to reach him would have neces-
sitated the column?s passing the poeri and exposing itself to a murderous
fire, decided it was best to let the column continue in the direction
it was making for. Therefore once more the hopes of all were crushed.
It was now evident that no help was to be expected from Mataram
and the situation in the temple was hourly growing from bad to worse;
the thirst was unendurable and the air was filled with the stench of the
dead bodies in the old bivouac. Everything must be risked to escape
from this place of pestilence.
One of the Boelelengers belonging to the Resident?s suite was of
the opinion that with the exception of a few Balinese, who were left to
observe the troops, the greatert part of the enemy would probably
be busy fighting over the plunder of Van Lawick?s column, so that if
they tried to leave the temple at dusk?by the back entrance on the
S. E. side (see plan) ?there might be a chance of reaching the sawah
unnoticed.
This plan was considered and approved of. The wounded were re-
bandaged, the ammunition was evenly distributed, ?every available man
receiving from 60 to 70 cartridges ?and the troops were divided into
three divisions. Major Hamerster was with the first section; the main
body, one section strong, was commanded by Captain Kamerman and
this included also the servants, the women and the greater number of


the invalids, the remainder came with the last section under Ist Lieute-
nant Musch.
They made their exit through the specified door as noiselessly as pos-
sible; a Javanese servant, who was well acquainted with the roads of
Tjakra served as guide.
They arrived outside unobserved. The first section got through
the narrow dark path, which was so dangerous on account of many
holes in the ground and odd stumps of trees and reached a better
side road; but some of the tandoe carriers stumbled and this
caused much confusion amongst the main body, which owing to the
darkness, turned off into a different path, so that they lost touch of
each other; the hindermost section missed the main body and returned to
the temple.
After seeking in vain to effect a junction with the two remaining
sections, the front section continued the night march across Tjakra Nagara.
Many obstacles had been placed on the road by the Balinese, but these
were succesfully removed and in an hour?s time they found themselves
in the sawah to the South of Mataram.
After a short rest, they directed their course Southwards and on the
morning of the 28th were fortunate enough to reach the shore and make
their presence known to one of the vessels lying in the harbour at
Ampenan; boats were despatched to fetch them and all were conveyed to
the bivouac there.
The rear-guard arrived not long after ?about 7.80 a. m. ?; they had
returned to the temple and seeing that the Balinese were still unaware
of their movements, they made another exit and had managed to make
a somewhat similar march to that of the first section.
The most difficult task fell to the share of the main body with its
large following.
While there were only 27 able-bodied men, Captain Kamerman had to
take care of 7 severely wounded men, carried in tandoes, 11 slightly
wounded, who could walk with assistance, the women, the servants and
the convicts. As a result of that moment?s confusion, they had taken
a wrong path as w r e saw and now the officer in command became
aware, but too late, that the rear guard was not following him and that
he had no vanguard to protect' his troops.
It was hopeless to think of re-establishing communication and run
the risk of falling in with the enemy and there was no alternative but
to try and reach the sawah alone.
Following a southwesterly route and avoiding all Balinese kampongs
most studiously, Kamerman succeeded in reaching the beach the follow-
ing morning about half past eleven, bringing with him all those who
had been entrusted to his care. The wounded were carried in ship?s
boats to Ampenan; the others continued their march to Ampenan in
company with a detachment which had been sent to look out for them.
Needless to say that Kamerman and his men received a hearty wel-
come from the Commander-in-chief.


Now that he was safe, reaction set in; the tremendous exertions and
fatigues added to wounds which he had received, compelled Kamerman
to seek the shelter of the hospital, which however he was able to quit
very shortly.
The night spent by Lindgreen and his column was sad and full
of anxiety.
Hcfw endless seemed the long dark hours to the wounded, who were
almost dying of thirst and whose sufferings prevented their sleeping! *
How desperately slow the minutes crept by for those in health, wait-
ing for help and deliverance! And they too were suffering from hunger
and thirst.
Every moment made it surer and surer that they were left to their
own resources.
Lindgreen suggested that those who were able should make an
attempt to slip through the enemy and leave the wounded behind!
Ujlaki opposed the plan: if Lindgreen chose to go he could .... but
he, the doctor, would stay with his patients and to this Lindgreen objected.
Another supreme effort must be made to sustain life in the temple
as long as possible. On the highroad they had seen pack horses
lying dead ?these must be laden with provisions of rice and other food.
A few of the men steal out gently.... minutes seemed hours .... but
everything was quiet.
They came back; bringing with them two cases of hard biscuit
and a small case of cartridges.
They tried again.
This time they returned with some tins of minced meat and some tins
of butter .... but they also brought the startling news that Lieutenant-
colonel Van Lawick was lying dead on the road.
This made a deep impression! The fact in itself was grievous enough,
but it goes to prove that the confusion must have] been shocking,
otherwise the body of their beloved Commander would never have been
left behind.
A patrol was immediately despatched to bring the dead body into
the temple.
The attempt succeeded, although the enemy was aware of the daring
feat, as testified by the number of bullets fired at our men.
During the course of the night five or six trips were taken, and
water, not of the very best, yet drinkable, was found in one of the
houses, and some wounded men and a few dead bodies were brought in.
Towards morning three graves w r ere dug and the dead, eleven in
number, were laid to rest: in one was the Commander, in the second
the soldiers and in the third the convicts.
Differing in position, rank, civilization and race, but all fallen in
fulfilment of their duties and now covered with the same earth and
protected by the same temple, these brave men, had all lost their
fives in the service of the Hollando-Indian army.
* Dr. Uj laki says that three of the wounded died that night for want of water.


During the funeral ceremony the Balinese renewed their firing and
Lieutenant Van der Plank, who had been shot in the arm on the previous
day, was wounded in the shoulder.
After the solemnity, a distribution was made of the prize secured
the previous night,; a tin of minced meat was given out to every ten
men, (about two pounds) and also some biscuit and a little water,-
While they were all busy enjoying their simple meal, a convict
approached the temple with a white kerchief. Lindgreen allowed him
to climb over the wall. ?He came with a letter from the Crown Prince
to the Officer in command.? Nobody however could decipher what was
written on the ?lontar? leaves. Prom this convict, taken prisoner by
the Balinese, terrible accounts were received: our troops were entirely
annihilated; all the officers killed; the soldiers, who had escaped from
the slaughter, had all taken refuge on one of the warships and had
sailed for Java; the Crown Prince ?commanding the troops facing the
temple ?was wearing the uniform of the Commander-in-chief; other
Chiefs the uniforms belonging to the deceased officers, etc. He had
himself seen Van Lawick fall.
These tidings were confirmed by three 'other convicts, who had also
been taken prisoners. ?Soldiers had also been made prisoners; their
treatment was very good; the Crown Prince very much regretted the
occurrences which must have arisen through some misunderstanding; he
and the old Prince were friends of the Government; they could not
comprehend why the general had begun firing; had they not complied
with all our demands??
It was impossible that in their present situation all these things should
not have made a very strong impression; for had there still been Dutch
troops on the island surely they would have endeavoured ?to rescue
their comrades.
Had the convicts not told the truth concerning Van Lawick? So, by
degrees they began to believe the other facts reported by them.
Fortunately however the men in whose charge the troops were left
were no longer young and impressionable.
The convicts were sent back to the Crown Prince with the request
that the letter should be re-written in Malay language and in Dutch
?characters.
After a short delay another convict appeared with a note from the
Crown Prince written in lead pencil on a sheet of white paper. It was
in Malay and the characters were Dutch; it was signed by K?Tut. It
contained the offer to allow the officers, soldiers and wounded men to
retreat unmolested, if they would give up their arms. The proposal
was rejected unhesitatingly. They had enough supplies for a few days
more. And if the troops had not really left Lombock, help might come
any moment; they would hold out as long as they could.
No sooner had the convicts departed with the refusal, than the firing
began once more with redoubled energy and fury, besides big stones
were flung over the walls and many of the men were badly hurt.


Four clays, from 28th to 31st August, passed by in the midst of
these difficulties. The sufferings and hardships of the wounded were inten-
sified by the lack of surgical instruments and bandages and no water
could be spared from the very limited supply to wash out the old
bandages, so that old, dirty, blood-stained linen had to be used. No
small alarm was caused when it Avas discovered that in one instance
hospital gangrene had set in and there being no antiseptics, it Avas
feared that the disease would spread rapidly.
The doctor in hunting round for what he could find opened the door
of one of the little ?family-temples? and there saAv a Balinese corpse,
embalmed and decked out in gala clothes. According to custom, there
were also dishes of rice, pastry, etc. And fine linen covered the body....
and at the head was a piece of calico. There Avas no time for delibera-
tion; he possessed himself of all that could be used as bandages, but
in no way disturbed the corpse; he retired, locking the door behind him.
On the morning of the 29th hope revived. They heard the sound
of a big gun, judging from the report they knew it came from the
ships; at any rate, they had not yet left.
A few hours later, another shot and fresh hopes; but that was all.
Lindgreen made one more desperate attempt to open up communication
with Ampenan. In a short note he described the situation and sent
two convicts to carry it either to the bivouac at Ampenan or to the naval
commander in the roadstead; he also sent tAvo others to try and obtain
food, especially rice, which was sorely missed by the native soldiers.
Nothing Avas ever heard again of any of the four men.
There Avas only one more day?s provision, so some scheme of escape
must be planned. Lindgreen reverted to his previous idea of leaving the
wounded to take their chances and letting the others do their utmost
to reach the open sawah. Dr. Ujlaki obtained another 24 hours? grace
for his patients, for he said, that next day, 81 Aug. was the birthday,
of H. M. the Queen and if there were still troops or ships at Ampenan
they would hear guns salute,
Lindgreen having conceded this much, was hoAvever determined to
prepare for departure and therefore sent scouts to find out the best
and safest road to folloAV. The native sergeant Sadiman Avas the first
to go, but soon returned having accomplished nothing. ?He could not
see a hand before him in the dark; he Avould prefer going in the day-
time; in the middle of the day no Balinese were ever to be seen.?
So in the afternoon of the 81st Sadiman, attired in the native dress
entered the kampong. He stayed aAvay about an hour. ?He had been
unable to find any road leading to the sawah; he had seen tAvo Balinese
seated in a house that he had had to pass....? he fancied ?the sawah
could not be very far distant.?
In the evening the European sergeant Lith was sent on the same
errand, but with the same result.
Everything was prepared for departure, but only the Europeans were
informed of the project. ?I did not dare visit my sick,? writes Doctor

Lieutenant de Graaf and Sergeant Sadiman attacked by Balinese.


Ujlaki, ?in every eye I should have read reproach.? Yes, it was terrible,
to think that those poor men with whom one had gone through so much
and who were so full of trust, were to be left to their fate and
perhaps a terrible one! At 11.80 a. m. Lindgreen sallied forth himself
to look for a road. He stayed away a long while and they began to
feel seriously anxious about him. No one knew even in which direction
he had gone. Finally, as the hour fixed for the start was about to
strike he returned. But he too had failed in his attempt.
Still he was determined to leave Tjakra with all the able-bodied men.
They were divided into three divisions; the first, including Dr. Ujlaki,
was commanded by Lindgreen, the middle one by de Graaf, the last one
by a European sergeant major; all left the temple as silently as pos-
sible and without any noise proceeded for an hour along the road which Lind-
green had reconnoitred, and which ran through ditches and hedges over walls.
The road ended in a square space surrounded by walls and the troops
assembled here.
Hoping soon to find a road leading to the sawah, Lindgreen started
once more on a scouting expedition by himself.
He came back without having succeeded; de Graaf offered to go and
see what he could do, but Lindgreen insisted upon his taking two
soldiers with him, but de Graaf thought this quite unnecessary; how-
ever it was decided that the native sergeant Sadiman should accompany
him. Barely had they been gone ten minutes when the most awful
shrieks pierced the air, followed by a shot. Lindgreen rushed to see
what had occurred and met the sergeant, who told him they had been
attacked by 4 Balinese. Lindgreen goes to the spot where de Graaf
had fallen and found the body pierced with four spears and a revolver
shot in the forehead.
Hurriedly they carried back the body to the walled-in space. All further
idea of advancing was given up; as it was evident the Balinese were patrolling
all the roads, Lindgreen decided to remain here and as soon as feasible
to return for the wounded and transfer them to their new quarters.
In the dead of night, Lindgreen, the doctor, ten soldiers and the
convicts, went to their former place of refuge to fetch their comrades; it
was impossible to carry them all, so three were left behind, to be brought
next time. It was a difficult task to perform, not only on account of
the pitch darkness and the uneven roads, but because the enemy might
discover them.
They reached the little square just in time, for the Balinese now sur-
rounded the walls in hundreds, shouting and screaming. To risk fetching
the remaining three wounded could not be thought of and all were now
intent on putting this little square in a state of defence and find a safe
place for the wounded. When all the needful measures had been
taken, we had to think of burying young de Graaf.
It was a sad ceremony and men who had remained unmoved under
the enemy?s fire and who had suffered privation and hardships with cool-
ness and indifference, could not refrain from shedding a tear of pity and


sorrow when this brave soldier was consigned to the earth. He was
not only universally esteemed as a bold and courageous officer, but he
had endeared himself to the hearts of his men by the manner in which
he had shared their sufferings and had tried to comfort them in word
and deed. Each man felt that he had lost a friend. Not much
time was allowed for melancholy reflections, for the Balinese soon
started operations again; and it was only at daybreak that it became
apparent that the security here was not so great as it had been in the
temple; from many houses in the neighbourhood the Balinese were
able to fire straight into the square and also there was no protection
whatever against stone-throwing.
Only a few tins of biscuit remained and the water they had found
was putrid. And now the Balinese started hurling firebrands amongst
the men. All were by this time exhausted; it was hopeless to expect relief
and it was utterly impossible to fight a way through the enemy.
There was nothing to be done but surrender.
Lindgreen first took counsel with the officers, then with the European
non-commissioned officers, no one could suggest any other plan.
At 1 p.m. on the Ist September Lindgreen wrote a Malay note in
lead pencil to the Crown Prince, in which he declared himself ready to
capitulate and to lay down his arms, on condition that all?sound and
sick alike ?shall be granted a safe conduct to Ampenan.
Sergeant Sadiman, under cover of an improvised white flag, handed
the letter to one of the chiefs on the other side of the wall. The reply
came that the Crown Prince wished to treat personally with Lindgreen.
Lindgreen went out to the Balinese and after a short discussion with
one of the princes was assured that his conditions were accepted by
the Prince.
Meanwhile hundreds of Balinese had penetrated into the square
space and now the weapons had to be delivered up.
It was a hard moment for those who had carried them so honourably
and who owed their lives to them.
The wounded were carried by the soldiers and so they left their
last stronghold.
Numbers of Balinese assembled in the streets to watch the pro-
cession?they were all armed, yet all maintained a respectful attitude,
and not an offensive word was heard and not a threatening hand was raised.
On the road they saw many corpses of friends and comrades and
the mournful sight intensified their own misery.
In half an hour they reached the poeri, and here worse things were
presented to their view: the remains of the bivouac of the 6th Batallion.
All was in ruins, everything heaped up together, nothing but a mass of
devastation; dead bodies of men and horses, all serving as carrion for
the dogs which were wandering about amongst them ....
The bazaar itself was occupied by mounted Balinese and it was here that
the soldiers had to wait until the Prince could receive the prisoners.
Meanwhile refreshments were served to all: bigdjeroeks (half orange and

The attitude of the Balinese remained very respectful and they even
appeared sorry for the wounded ....

After the names and ranks had been written down, Lindgreen and
Dr. Ujlaki were summoned to appear before the prince in the poer.
The square into which they were shown was filled with armed, richly
dressed Balinese with red jackets, forming the prince?s body-guard, and


all were provided with entirely new Winchester repeating rifles. In
the middle of the square there were two marquees and the prisoners
were conducted into one of them; various chiefs and princes in yellow
silk jackets and with gold and ivory krisses in their belts kept coming-
in and going out. After waiting for a quarter of an hour, the prince
appeared, followed by a suite of courtiers; on the right and on the
left he was supported by chiefs; a woman with a fan preceded him;
and another with a cushion walked behind him. The procession
approached with great dignity and all present bowed deeply. There was
complete silence. With the assistance of two chiefs the prince seated
himself in the second marquee; behind him sat the woman with the
cushion, against which he leaned and all the chiefs or princes squatted
on the ground around him.
The council began.
Different chiefs came forward in turn, bowed low and in very loud
tones made their reports. The prince listened attentively.
Was this then the doting old man with whom it had been impossible
to enter into negociation? The prince who was at the head of this
gathering, was, it is true, fifty years older, but in other respects in no
way altered since Zollinger described him, with his intelligent, character-
istic and speaking features, the descendant of Gusti Wajan Taga.
Messengers were frequently sent by the prince to the prisoners, with
assurances that he was still a friend of the Government and that he
deeply regretted what had occurred; but that the troops had started
hostilities. He further begged of Lindgreen to inform the General at
Ampenan of this fact and to beg of him to leave the island.
So there still was a General at Ampenan. What a comforting piece
of news. Lindgreen promised to transmit the message. But would the
request to leave Lombock have much effect on the General ? He
himself only occupied a subordinate position, and even the General was
not a free agent.
Although correct, was this observation exactly needed at such a moment?
Did it not induce the prince, who saw the justness of it, to bring
further pressure to bear in support of his demand?
It now appeared that the prince only intended to allow the officers to
leave, in spite of the promises he had made; the soldiers would be
kept as prisoners until an answer should be received to the letter, which
the prince would give to the officers for the General. Lindgreen stoutly
refused to accede to this arrangement. All should go, or none. And
in this latter case, how could the government attach any weight to the
word of a prince, who had violated his promises to the prisoners.
Without making any progress whatever, the conference lasted from
2.30 p. m. until 6 p. m.; and the promising tone of the beginning had
conspicuously altered towards the end.
Lindgreen and Ujlaki were now conducted back to the other prisoners
outside the poeri and all were taken to a filthy dirty place, which had
probably served as a stable and all requests for food and drink remained
17


unheeded. Thus the night was spent out in the open air, without
covering' or protection of <niv kind and the sufferings of the wounded
under such trying circumstances were indescribable.
Towards daybreak of 2nd Sept. Lindgreen and Ujlaki were again
summoned to appear before the prince and this time they were conducted
to the inner dalem. As on the previous day there were a great number
of armed men and all the weapons bore traces of being in perfect order:
On this occasion the prince did not appear himself, but sent a repre-
sentative, who, judging from his attire, must have occupied a very
exalted position: he was clad entirely in yellow silk and carried a gold
kris resplendent with precious stones.
Lindgreen began reproaching him severely for the treatment they had
received:
?That was no way of treating the Idas of the Netherlands Govern-
ment, for that is who they were. Instead of giving them their freedom
in accordance with the prince?s promise, they had been locked up like
dogs with nothing to eat or drink!?
The chief departed. It was not the first time that the bold language
of a Dutch ?Ida? had been known to make an impression upon a prince
of Salamparang.
Shortly afterwards the chief returned with ample apologies for the
bad accommodation. The prince had had no other place at his immediate
disposal, but had given orders to prepare one of his residences for the
prisoners.
And once more the prince assured Lindgreen that he was a ?sobat
kras? (fast friend) of the Government and as soon as the letter was
ready they should be permitted to start for Ampenan.
Lindgreen and Ujlaki were now conducted by a guard of honour,
composed of several chiefs to the East quarter of the poeri, where the
pond is. The little house on its border was put in order and appointed
to be their dwelling; Lieutenant Van der Plank and the European
soldiers were allowed to share the house, but the native soldiers and
the convicts had to return to their former quarters.
Officers and soldiers were then given food; rice, native cakes,
porkpies, and shaddocks. What a welcome repast after so many
privations.
And no less enjoyable were the opportunities of refreshment and
bathing, such luxuries having been dispensed with so long.
Finally a Balinese notable, called Ida Made Sabali, was assigned to
do the honours; and his nephew ? Gusti Ngenga Hundu, a neighbour,
said he would be only too happy to render them any service in
his power.
Towards midday an emissary came from the Crown Prince to inform
Lindgreen that before leaving the prisoners were to go and see him
at Mataram.
In the hope that their hour of deliverance had struck, Lindgreen
assembled all his men; the wounded were placed in very primitive


tandoes and with Batoe Bagus (the emissary) and the officers leading
the way, the soldiers and the wounded with a large following of Balinese
in the rear, they started for Mataram.
Thus they marched through Tjakra Nagara?in very different guise
from what they could have imagined a couple of days before. The
roads leading out of the town were all strongly barricaded and guarded.
At the point where the bivouac had been situated on the main road
fiom Tjakia to Mataram it was absolutely impossible to proceed, as
the foulness of the air was suffocating.
hours march they reached the cross-road at Mataram.
ihe officers were received, not in the poen of the Crown Prince, but
in the former house of Gusti Njoman Kaler and the soldiers had to
wait in front of it.
The Crown Prince remained invisible, but his son came and had some
discussion with Ratu Bagus, whereupon the latter opened negociations
in the name of K Tut. Again the proposal was made that onlv the
officers should be released and the soldiers kept as hostages?but Lind-
green obstinately refused to listen to any such arrangement, saying, that:
?certainly no letter would ever be looked at at headquarters if all the
men did not go together to transmit it to the General.?
Just at the moment when Lindgreen?s reply appeared to be bearing
fruit, the Malay kampong chief of Ampenan, who pretended to be friends
with us, appeared on the scene and when he saw the drift of affairs,
he began by pointing out to Ratu Bagus, how great the advantages
were to be derived by keeping the soldiers prisoniers?this chief, as
we shall see later, was one of the most brutal specimens of his class
Whilst the parleying was in full swing a shell fired from the roadstead
fell on a dung heap, close to where the soldiers were seated but it did
not burst.
len minutes latei another shot Avas heard and all the Balinese present
seemed terrified to death; this time the shell fell into a ditch, near
AAdiich the wounded had been placed; the water splashed and that was
all. None of our men showed any signs of fear.
This coolness surpassed the comprehension of the Balinese.
?How is it that none of you are afraid?? asked Ratu Bagus, when
lie had collected himself. It was on this occasion that Lindgreen gave
that beautiful and simple reply, which is far more worthy of record
than many other imaginary sayings:
? The bullets of the Company can never hurt the Company?s children! ?
And not one of those Balinese doubted the truth of this assertion.
AVas Lindgreen s brave attitude about to bring its oavii reward. Of
course it is impossible to say what might have happened; but what did
happen was, that the old prince sent a messenger to say that the letter
for the General Avas not yet ready and the prisoners were to return to
Tjakra.
Once again to go over the same road; but how much harder Avas it
this time. Scorching sun rays were pouring down on that disappointed


little band of men and exhausted both mentally and physically they
found themselves back in the old quarters at Tjakra.
Every one was naturally feeling most depressed and out of sorts; on
the whole the treatment of the Balinese was very considerate. The
native soldiers were now permitted to share the accommodation in the
poeri. The prince even sent one of the chiefs towards the middle of
the day to inform the officers that presently some disturbance might be
expected in the street in front of the poeri, but that there was no
occasion for alarm. It was only a muster against the Sassaks who
were threatening Narmada. This notice was shortly followed by the
most astounding uproar. To the sound of war drums hundreds of
Balinese passed by the poeri; all were armed with spears and were
howling and shouting at the top of their voices.
Amidst all this performance the prisoners were in no way neglected,
but were provided with all necessaries. This then was the way in which
the Ist September went by.
The wounded were provided with fresh bandages, a present from the
prince. On the 3rd of Sept, permission was given to go to the Dewa
temple to fetch the three wounded whom they had been compelled to
leave behind. True they were only convicts, but the hardships that
had been undergone together in the same cause had brought all closer
to one another.
All sorts of suggestions were made by the Prince during this period;
one was that Lindgreen should write to the General ?in Malay, so that
it might be read beforehand ?informing him that he and his men
were prisoners, but well cared for by the prince. But Lindgreen
refused to fall in with the plan-, ?he would? only correspond with his
chief in Dutch.?
Then again it was proposed that the prince himself should write a
letter to have it taken by one of the officers, for the General had
given orders to shoot any Balinese who came within sight and the
Prince dared not expose his poenggawas.
Meanwhile the squadron had bombarded Matarani; the greater part
of the shells had burst and caused great damage to the houses as
Gusti Njengo candidly confessed. On the sth September a youthful
Pvatu coming from Mataram, told Lindgreen that his house had been
destroyed by a bomb-shell and he was going to beg of the prince to
release the prisoners, as that would certainly put an end to the war. The
prince was a good friend to the Government, etc .... the old, old story.
On the morning of the 6th September, an order came to the effect
that Lindgreen and his men were to prepare for their departure; the
prince had written a letter to the General and Lindgreen was to be
the bearer of it.
The Balinese provided our men with food and gave them bamboo to
make new stretchers with and at 2 p.m. all was ready for a start.
Suddenly a most appalling noise was heard in front of the poeri,
similar to that of a couple of days before.


Considerable anxiety was felt by all?so many disappointments naturally
caused distrust ?but this time all fears were unfounded. The clamour
was simply to summon together the men told off to act as escort to
Lindgreen.
The procession soon formed: first a couple of Chiefs?one carrying
the despatch?and the officers, then the soldiers, some carrying the
wounded and behind them armed Balinese.
A different route was followed to the one they had taken on their
previous march; the prince had instructed them to go southwards through
Passinggahan?was this so that our men should remain ignorant of the
measures of defence, which had been taken? Arrived at this kampong
the escort went into the poeri, where one of the sons of the prince
resided and our men stayed outside, but the people brought them
cocoa-nuts.
The march was continued in the same order as far as Sekar Bela
and here the escort took their leave, with instructions to follow the
road in a westerly direction. However instead of keeping to the route
taken by the Commander-in-chief at the time of his retreat on the
27th August they took a shorter one. A native, whom they met just
after leaving the Balinese, promised to guide them more quickly to
Kale, where the Netherlands troops were located.
On they went through narrow, solitary streets, over ditches and galan-
gans. Quite unexpectedly about 4 p. m. they saw the beloved tricolor
flying above Kale, where Colonel Scheuer was in command.
Lindgreen and his men were really and truly saved!
And great indeed was the delight of the troops at Kale at the sight
of the comrades, whom they had given up as lost. The reception
accorded them was more than cordial and naturally every effort was
made to relieve the wounded and the sick; after all had been thoroughly
attended to and refreshed, they were sent under a strong escort to
Ampenan, where once more they were the recipients of hearty congratu-
lations on the narrow escape they had had; of course some, who were
too ill, were left at Kale.
On his arrival at Ampenam Lindgreen handed over to the Commander-
in-chief the letter from the Rajah; in it he said that the attack of
25th?26th August had originated on our side and furthermore that he
released the prisoners purely as a sign of friendship and goodwill and
to show that he wished to put an end to hostilities.
Lindgreen was somewhat disappointed to find that the Commander-
in-chief did not think fit to send any acknowledgment of the prince?s letter.
Now that the fate of the different columns and divisions was actually
known, the extent of our calamities could be accurately estimated. The
casualties were as follow: 97 killed, among whom 9 officers, 50 European
and 38 Amboynese and native soldiers of inferior rank; 272 wounded,
of whom 17 officers, 108 European and 151 Amboynese and native
soldiers, 9 of whom have since died. Amongst the missing were 10


European and 16 Amboynese and natives, but these figures were reduced
later on to 5 and 9.
Hitherto we have followed the sequence of events as they occurred,
in order not to lose connection with them and now we will briefly
state our opinion concerning them.
As a preliminary we will make one or two remarks: Repeated refer-
ences have been made both in private and official documents ?and we
ourselves plead guilty to the same mistake ?to a treacherous attack, to
a base and shameful betrayal on the part of the Balinese, to an
onslaught against which no precautionary measures were taken. In
our opinion this statement is incorrect.
As an ally, our native subjects might prove treacherous ?but in this
instance there could be no question of betrayal, as far as the Balinese
were concerned.
Up to the 25th August they were the people against whom our
fighting powers were directed and whom we were busy trying to bring
into submission by force of arms. The Balinese were therefore our
enemies. As such they might resort to artifice and cunning?but under
the circumstances they could not betray us.
Forethought must be taken for similar acts of cunning on the part
of the opposing side. Difficulties may stand in the way; it may even
be impossible to take decisive measures, still this does not preclude the
need for straining every nerve to try and do so and to make every
practicable arrangement for safety.
Now, it cannot be denied, that we left these precautionary measures
incomplete, and that, by neglecting this duty, we facilitated the plans
of the enemy, although we did not actually invite him to take advantage
of his opportunity.
Another circumstance was responsible too for the extent of our
disasters, the peculiar situation, the enormous size and construction
of Tjakra.
Surely the danger proceeding from these facts was no secret. One
contingency, that no one unfortunately seems to have taken into account,
was the ease with which breaches could be made in the massive walls
and which would place our men entirely at the enemy?s mercy. An
enemy shooting from over the wall might be disposed of, but against
an enemy shooting from behind a wall, one was powerless.
?Yes, one ought to have known this, this ought not to have been
overlooked.?
Undoubtedly one ought to have known and an ideal Commander-in-
chief with an efficient staff would not have overlooked this eventuality,
but let who will, throw stones at General Yetter and his staff, ?we do
not wish to be of the number.
What has struck us most of all in reading the accounts of the war,
and what deserves most special notice is the marvellous discipline, the
fearless courage of the Indian army, not only amongst the officers but


amongst the soldiers; in face of the most intense distress, every man
did his duty, the faith and trust in the leaders remained unshaken.
From a military standpoint, this is looked upon as the bright side of
the surprise.
Never before were the virtues of the Indian army brought in such
happy prominence. But no matter how high sounding our praise may
be, we feel compelled to notice one defect. Truly, every light casts a
shadow.
With that tenacity of purpose, which our people displayed in their
continuous struggle with the elements and by means of which they
acquired greatness in their battle for liberty in the 16th and 17th cen-
turies, and which is still to day the principal characteristic of our
brothers on the far side of the river Yaal, with that tenacity, I say,
we maintained our hold in Lombock.
Side by side with that tenacity of purpose, is another, a negative
characteristic amongst our present day folks, a virtue which is com-
pressed within narrow limits and has no longer a voice in the heart
of European States. It is, a want of initiative, a shrinking from making
a bold attack, from taking the offensive, a want of that quality which
stamped our forefathers; which sent them in search for dangers and
enabled them to vanquish them.
This was our fault at Atchin, at Flores, and this again was our fault
here. The moment the enemy fired the first shot was the time to have
taken refuge within the protecting walls of the Dewa temple; instead
of so doing, preference was given to the open bivouac. But every shot
that hits, increases the difficulties of taking the offensive, every wounded
soldier is an encumbrance for the retreat.
Finally the number of dead and wounded was such as to force a com-
pulsory retreat into the temple and all idea of offensive action was laid
aside and a retreat was entered upon; we have seen how the marches
were hindered by the transport of the disabled.
Precisely the same thing was repeated in the sawah-bivouac of the 7th
Batt. During the whole night the sounds of rifle and cannon at Tjakra
were heard and surely the Commander might have known what fate would
be his, situated as he was in such an open, unprotected position. Even
had he not wished to take the offensive, the very least he could do
was to prepare for a strong defence; he might have taken up a position
on the borders of Mataram and Tjakra with his three companies and
conveyed thither victuals ammunition, etc.; instead of taking any such
step the Commander waited patiently until the next morning and main-
tained his dangerous position until forced to retreat on account of his
heavy losses.
Was the idea which the Commander-in-chief conceived at Tjakra of
attacking the enemy in the poeri itself a wrong one?
Of course we do not mean an attack against the Western portion inter-
sected by endless walls and passages, of the ins and outs of which all were
alike ignorant, but against the Eastern side, at Majura, near where the


pond was. ? The walls were too solid,??quite so, , but the gateways-
and doors were not!
The question remains whether our limited forces had any chance of
success against so many thousand foes?
Too much time was wasted until one quarter of our men were in-
capacitated and required the care and watchfulness of ever so many
others to guard them. If, instead of allowing matters to reach such a
climax, an immediate reply had been given to the first shot, when all
were in good condition, it is more than probable that our forces, 400
men strong and well organized, would have been able to give a good
account of themselves.
Besides we do not believe that there were thousands of enemies at
the outset, for it is incredible that preparations on such an extensive
scale could have remained unsuspected by us. We surmise that this
rising was very similar in its working to all others of a like nature:
the initial success achieved by an inconsiderable number of men
attracted to its ranks, not only all the hesitating ones, but those who
had been left in total ignorance of the movement.
Had the enemy?s forces been so large, and had the plan been so
generally known, there was no reason why a simultaneous attack on
the 7th Batt. should not have been attempted.
It is well known that it was only on the morning of the 26th August
that the Prince notified to the population of Mataram that they were
to take their part in the attack; and that, when the attack began against
Major van Blommestein, the firing slackened at Tjakra.
This does not point to such an overwhelming superiority. Unhesita-
tingly we admit that to have taken the initiative would have been a
risky, even a very risky, but by no means desperate, step; still it is
always more praiseworthy to take a risk than to allow one?s self to be
killed without defence.
?There are times!? says von Clausewitz ??when the greater risk is-
the greater prudence!?
What about the officer in command of the 7th Battalion, might he
not have gone to the assistance of the threatened at Tjakra? How
eagerly they looked for his arrival. He was only 20 minutes distant
from them. The whole night long he heard continuous firing; but only
at dawn did he send a company to reconnoitre.
How differently did the Germans act in the Pranco-German war.
(They marched towards the sound of the cannon on their own
account). It is no use retorting: ?they were in larger numbers,? or
?in that case the opposing army was not so overwhelming as here.?
It was not only the generals, who marched at the heads of their
divisions, but also captains with their companies and lieutenants with
their detachments who advanced against unknown and frequently
countless numbers.
Would it have been desirable that the Commander-in-chief, once
having reached the Dewa temple, should wait there for the columns


lie had sent to the interior? We have seen that such was General van
Vetter?s primary intention, but on reflecting that it would be impossible
to maintain the position long, now that no help was forthcoming from
Mataram and seeing that he was unable to send any assistance to the
columns, he gave up the idea.
We think that if the Commander-in-chief had succeeded?which he
tried in vain to do ?in warning the columns of his retreat and in ordering
them to take a different route and avoid Tjakra, this would undoubtedly
have been the best decision to have come to. But having failed in
this, the conclusion was the columns would certainly march straight
to Ijakra, to their Commander, in the hope of either supporting him
or receiving support from him, but at all events with the surety of
finding him there. ?
? Provisions were running short and there was scarcely any water to
drink.? This is certainly to be lamented; but there was no reason to
think that days would elapse before the arrival of the columns; van
Bijlevelt?s might arrive within a few hours and van Lawick?s within a day.
But what aid could the exhausted troops of Tjakra lend to the
columns. IVlatenal aid little perhaps; but, taken ail together, they formed
a foice by no means to be despised. It remains of course an open
question whether, now that the enemy had assembled, it would still
have been feasible to attack them on their own territory; or whether
our losses would not have even exceeded the actual total; but one
point, on which there can lie no doubt is that morally sneaking the
effect on the troops would have been beneficial. * P g
We have witnessed the shocking disappointment experienced by the
vanguard of Christan and Willemstyn when they discovered the bivouac
of the Commander-in-chief deserted.
Regarding the retreat of the various columns, we have already
expressed our admiration at van Bijleveldt?s (Creutz-Sechleitner) feat
and we have but one more remark to offer. ?Why did the column start
so comparatively late from the bivouac at Sukarara ? The order of the
Commander-in-chief reached there during the night at about half past
two and the troops did not march until 9 a.m. ?The victuals and
other things had to be conveyed to the kampong chief at Praja.? In
view of the instructions to return without delay, all things else fell
into insignificance.
In this respect we consider that van Lawick?s conduct was more
laudable. At half past three he returned to his bivouac after a long
fatiguing march still, at o p.m., an hour and a half later, his troops were
on the road again.
? We wish to refrain from comparisons between the action of the
two columns; their circumstances were too widely different to admit of
any- Ihe movements of van Lawick s column were sadly hampered by
the large following in its train and it is quite sure that this column
was received with a much heavier fire on its entry to Tjakra than
was the other.


Was it however essential that either column should have passed
through Tjakra? Might not this have been avoided?
Certainly van Lawick might have done so; he might have skirted it,
but, considering what he knew of the occurrences, to have done so would
have been an unpardonable mistake.
With what reproaches ?well-founded ones too ?would he not have
been assailed had he marched straight to Ampenan without heeding
his 'Commander-in-chief? For, unaware of all that had taken place, he
could have no possible cause for imagining that the General had moved
his quarters.
Was there then no loop-hole by which van Lawick could have
extricated himself from his dilemma? In our opinion there is an answer
to this, although we allow that it is neither decisive nor altogether
satisfactory:
That something extraordinary was going on at Tjakra was very soon
perceptible. The enemy was met and repulsed; this fact by itself was
not so strange after the receipt of the Commander-in-chief?s letter. But
that on the approach of the troops to Tjakra, none of the Commander-
in -chief?s men were visible, that assuredly was a noteworthy fact.
Then again there was the newly-made partition at the entrance and the
total absence of people at the bazaars ?to both of which the chief
of the Staff drew attention. Did not these incidents justify the
sending of a scouting party before entering Tjakra with the entire
column ?
?But the enemy would not have permitted these scouts to go their
way undisturbed or return.? Probably one out of the lot, even though
wounded, might have been able to make a report. In any case the
rest would then have been warned of the danger threatening Tjakra
and precautionary measures could have been taken. What measures?
Naturally, to help the others ?at least if the patrol had not succeeded
in reaching the deserted bivouac?but, without the train. That would
have had to stay behind. It would not have been possible to leave
many men behind either, without diminishing the force too much to be
of any tangible use.
Perhaps, very probably even, the train would have fallen into the
hands of the Balinese. Still, Van Lawick and his whole troop would
have fought their way through, as did Van Bijlevelt, and the vanguard
under Christan and Willemstijn, and Lindgreen and his men would have
been spared their captivity.
This brings us to a subject ?Lindgreen?s captivity which has raised
a good deal of discussion.
Having regard for all the circumstances which led up to the captivity
and which we have carefully detailed, surely no one can condemn him.
He did all that was possible to hold out as long as he could and to
save the lives of his men. Although at the beginning he might have
escaped, with the sacrifice of his wounded, later this became impossible.
Fortune, which favored Kamerman under similar circumstances, was


against Lindgreen?but that ought not to take away from his merits,
Most ungrudgingly do we bestow our admiration on both him and the
brave men who stood such severe tests; and a special word of praise
do we speak for the heroic conduct of the faithful Doctor Ujlaki, who
through all emergencies ever remained true to his duty and, foreigner
though he was, ?showed such love for the Indian army.
After paying our tribute of respect to Lindgreen and his column, it
is only common justice not to pass by unnoticed the behaviour of the
enemy the treatment of the prisoners at their hands is without parallel
in the history of Indian warfare.
The friendly attitude of the Prince is easily to be understood. On
discovering that the annihilation of our troops was not as complete as
he had anticipated or as had been represented to him, and finding that
the naval force was about to attack Mataram and that we not only
occupied Ampenan but were on the point of assuming the offensive,
he became alarmed and consequently regretted the results of his own
act; he was anxious for reconciliation as appears from his declarations
to Lindgreen and his letter to the Commander-in-chief and hoped that
his considerate treatment of the prisoners and their eventual release
would avail him in the attainment of this object.
The delicacy and discretion of the population, who displayed neither
enmity nor discourtesy to their erstwhile foe; the politeness and attentions
of the poenggawa?s, whose power and influence we had been endeavouring
to undermine?all these things excite our admiration and point to a
high civilization, proving that we did not over-rate it in the early part
of this work. ?
In judgment on the course of action taken by the Balinese in the
attack made on us, their behaviour to our prisoners will occupy an
important part on their credit side of history?s page. From a political
standpoint was the ?release? a judicious act of the Prince? or would
it not have been wiser on his part to have followed the advice given
him by the chief of the commander of the Malay kampong?
It appears to us that the prince,?fortunately,?did not realize the
amount of pressure he might bring to bear so long as he held Lind-
green in his power and further more that he had formed an exaggerated
idea as to what the results of the release of the prisoners might be.
Concerning our attitude towards the prince there is nothing to say at all.
The Commander-in-chief did not even answer the letter. We regret
this for Lindgreen?s sake. We think that, although we had a good
many scores to settle with the enemy, still it might have been permissible
to acquaint the Prince with the fact that Lindgreen had fulfilled the
trust placed in him.
Might not more help have been looked for from the troops that had
been left at Ampenan than the ineffectual attempt at scouting that had
been so speedily abandoned by the cavalry?
Perchance?and we are willing to admit the contingency ?it was
not possible for the cavalry to advance to their front. Did they


try to do so on the flanks? We are ignorant on this point, but we are
well aware that their movements must necessarily have remained limited
to the roads and we may assume that ?unsupported ?they would have
had sooner or later to retreat from before Mataram.
In the bivouac at Ampenan there remained 2 full companies, besides
a naval brigade of 200 men.
Leaving the latter behind to protect the bivouac, might not the two
companies with the newly disembarked guns have advanced as far as
Mataram, which lay within easy reach? Who can say what an effect
such an immediate additional force would have had upon the Balinese.
There need have been no fear of being isolated, for, animated by the
determination to act on the offensive such as fills our neighbours the
English, in their struggles against native races, a rapid march would
soon have enabled them to join Blommestein and through him to have
rendered timely aid to the Commander-in-chief.
Once again, instead of taking the initiative we see all attention
turned to preparations for defence and for safety.
Would not the naval brigade supported by the two men-of-war in
the harbour, have sufficed for this? If this be denied, it is all the more
certain that a mistake was made in establishing the bivouac in such
an unprotected spot, and leaving the base of operations unfortified, and
held by only 8 companies.
It seems to us that the most practical means of protecting the bivouac
would have been in assuming a strong attitude of offence and in shooting
down all that came in our way.
That this course would have been feasible was demonstrated a couple
of days later by Capt. Willemstijn.
Such tactics would have revived the spirits of our men and would
have inspired the enemy with wholesome fear!
In conclusion a word concerning the fact that a naval officer of
inferior rank the officer in command of the bivouac should have
purposely been placed at the head of the naval brigade.
?It would not have been expedient to have entrusted the direction
of the defence of Ampenan to a land officer of inferior rank to that
enjoyed by the naval officer.?
This was the opinion of the naval commander, an opinion which is
usually accepted in a general sense when it refers to the command of
combined operations of land and sea forces.
?It would never have done for the commandar of the naval force to
have placed over him an officer junior to himself,? was the answer
given by the minister of marine in reply to an interpellation on this
point made by Heer van Ylijmen in the second Chamber on the 17th
December 1894.
Are we to take this as the last word on the subject ?
Cases arise when the greater share of the warlike operations must
necessarily devolve upon the navy: in blockading, in naval demonstrations.


in bombarding towns lying near the coast, etc. The chief command
ought under such circumstances to be placed in the hands of a naval
officer, even should the men under him have land forces attached to
them to assist in effecting a landing or other similar contingencies.
Where on the other hand the main business is to be executed by
the army; where it is the duty of the army to march to the interior
to carry on the operations needful for the attainment of the object in
view, the officer appointed to command is naturally selected from the
army, although the navy may perform valuable services in assisting the
disembarking, in bombarding, etc.
In our opinion this is so logical that every novice in matters of war
must agree with us.
By adhering to this elementary principle all difficulties will be fore-
stalled and the public interests will be but served.
Matters of secondary importance have sometimes caused a deviation
from this rule, and the natural consequences have ensued therefrom.
The chief cause of this deviation is due to the fact that promotion
in the navy proceeds more rapidly than in the army. As the rank of
major is non-existent in the navy, it is of frequent occurrence, that a
comparatively young naval lieutenant of the first class (equivalent to
captain) on his promotion to lieutenant-commander (equivalent to lieu-
tenant-colonel) immediately becomes the senior of all the majors in the army.
On preferment to a higher rank still, that of naval captain (colonel)
and after holding that rank for several years, as is the general rule,
then at the time of a mixed expedition he is nearly always the senior
in u standing? to much older colonels in the army.
If we apply the above-mentioned principle of the minister of marine
then we come face to face with these difficulties: either in case of an
expedition there is a very limited choice of commanders only to be
increased by selecting less suitable men; or the command over army
and navy ought to be separated which is equally bad.
The history of our Indian wars furnishes us with examples as disas-
trous in the one case as in the other.
This is not the place to expatiate thereupon; but we will give one
illustration of each mode of proceeding.
At the time of the third Balinese expedition, the commander of the
expeditionary sea force, vice-admiral (lieutenant-general) Machielsen
occupied a higher rank than major-general Michiels the commander of
the expeditionary land force.
The Governor-general had purposely entrusted the command of the
navy to a young officer, with the idea of placing him under General
Michiels, who from the character of the expedition was appointed
commander of all the forces. Vice-admiral Machielsen objected to this
arrangement, desiring to command his own sea force. The command
was therefore divided between the two.
On the 81 March 1849 General Michiels requested the support of a
naval brigade of 250 sailors and marines to assist him in carrying out


certain operations Vice-admiral Machielsen though well able to comply
with the request, contented himself with supplying 80 men, much to the
disappointment of the General!
During the Atcheen expedition of 1873 in case of absence of the
Commander-in-chief, General Kohler, a suitable second in command was
appointed in the person of Colonel Egter van Wisserkerke.
The command of the sea forces was however entrusted to the naval
Captain (colonel) Koopman, his senior in standing. In case of accident
to the Commander-in-chief, the command would therefore have devolved upon
that naval captain. No, that would not do, so a hurried search was
made for a substitute! This was found at the last moment in an older
colonel of the land forces who had just arrived from Europe and was
entirely ignorant of the preparations for, and conditions of the campaign.
The disadvantages attendant upon this course are known only too well.
And what was done here at Lombock?
Originally Colonel Segov was appointed second in command.
The commander of the sea forces in Indian waters opposed the nomi-
nation on the ground that the above named colonel was not of the same
standing in his rank as the naval Captain Quispel, the appointed
commander of the sea forces.
The objection met with no resistance. The comparatively small
expeditionary corps of three battalions not only secured the honour of
having for Commander-in-chief the oldest Major-general of the army ?
but had in addition, as second in command a second Major-general, the
only one still available.
Such then are the anomalies resulting from a divergence from the
above mentioned principle, the only really just one.
Surely the interests of the country ought to weigh more heavily in
the scales than any private sentimentalities or susceptibilities.
It ought to be clearly understood that the person who is selected by
the government for the important post of Governor, commander of the
army or commander of an expedition, or as substitute for any of these,
is called upon to carry out these functions not in his capacity as general
or colonel or whatever else it may be, but even when dealing with officers
of higher rank, is and remains the commander of the army, the
commander of the expedition (or substitute of these) with all the
authority and responsibilities attached to the office.


VII.
REINFORCEMENT OF THE EXPEDITION.
It was terrible news that reached the Governor-General during those
last days of August.
First came the telegram from the commander of the fleet in Lombock
waters, sent off during the night of 26th ?27th August, saying that lie
presumed an attack had taken place the previous night on the head-
quarters at Tjakra Nagara and at Mataram, as sounds of musketry
and cannon proceeding from that direction had been heard all night;
that the cavalry at Ampenan had ineffectually attempted to open up
communication with Mataram; that towards evening some heavy firing
had been heard in the direction of Mataram, but that now?midnight ?
all was quiet; that finally 200 men of the naval brigade and 4 guns
had been disembarked to reinforce Ampenan.
And the following morning brought a more detailed telegram; this
time from the Commander-in-chief; it had been despatched the previous
day on board the Koningin Emma.
And in the Mother country, after the Nieuws van den Bag had
published the first notice of the attack on the morning of 27th August,
fresh items of bad news came pouring in daily. On the 28th the same
paper published a telegram from Batavia, wherein it was notified that
14 officers, General Van Ham and 150 soldiers had been killed. In the
afternoon of that day the N.Rotterdammer Courant announced that the
number of killed and missing amounted to 185, amongst whom 30 officers.
More alarming still were the telegrams in the Staatscourant of the
28th and 29th.
?General Vetter announces, so telegraphed the Governor General:
?Tjakra attacked on the night of 25th. Firing continued all day.
Losses in course of 26th are 14 killed and 85 wounded. No water,
foraging impossible, losses increasing; at 8 p. m. retreated to Mataram.
Baggage left behind so as to carry wounded in waggons. Fleavy losses
on the road. Situation Mataram worse. Camp deserted.?
?Eight in the evening Bijlevelt?s column from the interior arrived,
also heavy losses.?


?Provisions failed, could not reach bivouac, communication with
Ampenan interrupted, hemmed in between Tjakra and Mataram: impos-
sible to take offensive. Situation untenable on account of numbers
wounded, on morning 27th retreated Ampenan in Southerly direction,
losses there comparatively small. Killed; 4 officers. 63 soldiers;
wounded; 12 officers, 158 soldiers; missing 6 officers, 148 soldiers.
Four field guns left behind at Mataram.?
? Nothing known of Van Lawick?s column in the interior ....
?Meeting immediately of council of India with commanders of army
and navy to consult about my idea of sending forthwith battalion and
artillery; if necessary more available. Will telegraph you decision.? We
will not quote any more of those harrowing telegrams so pregnant with
disaster, creating such a heart-rending impression everywhere.
There was one man however who knew no fear and maintained a bold
front and that man was the Governor.
Immediately on receipt of General Vetter?s telegram, the Governor-
General summoned an ?extraordinary meeting? of the council of India.
Here there was no talk of recalling the expedition ?the disastrous conse-
quences of such a proceeding were shown to us in the first Atcheen
campaign?the losses suffered should without delay be made good, a
new battalion sent to the seat of war and if this were not sufficient
then the Commander of the Army guarantees that the Governor-General
may promise more if the Commander-in-Chief requires more.
This was the language of a man.
Here we listen once again to the language of our ancestors which
shall be written in letters of gold in the annals of our country.
That very day the Commander-in-chief is telegraphically informed that
at the latest within four days the 2nd battalion of infantry stationed at
Magelang shall sail for Lombock; that within the shortest possible space
of time a strong train of artillery shall follow, wuth all that is required
for repairing the losses sustained and reconstructing the field force.
Meanwhile M. Segov, promoted from Colonel to Major-General, is
instructed by telegram to take the place of General Van Ham as second
in command, and the experienced Chief of the General-Staff J. J. K.
de Moulin, promoted to a colonelcy, is appointed Chief of the Staff of
the expedition and goes to Lombock to replace Major Hamerster who
was then missing.
The observation corps which had previously gone to Bali, but had
been sent back to Java, was at once ordered to return to Boeleleng.
Assured of speedy reinforcements, the Commander-in-chief was in a
position to telegraph to the Governor-General two days later, 30th August,
the plans he proposed for the resumption of hostilities.
In order to restore the moral of the soldiers, as well as to warn
the enemy of what he might prepare for, it was considered wise to send
two companies under Captain Willemstijn, of the General Staff, on a march
in the direction of Mataram, on the 30th and 31st August. It was then
apparent that the enemy was busy fortifying the West front of that


place, that they were throwing up breastworks in the neighbourhood of
the temple on the East of the dessa Arung-Arung and that at various
points they were breaking up the road between Ampenan and
Mataram.
The Balinese who were employed in the construction of the breast-
works were driven away by a couple of salvos. On the 30th and on the
81st the artillery opened fire on Mataram with the two remaining moun-
tain guns and we have described the consternation it caused there.
Ihe same day, the Commander-in-chief read to the troops the telegram
of sympathy that had been sent by the Queen-Regent and afterwards
made known to them the order of the day as drafted by the Governor-
General:
Officers and soldiers!
?It is with the greatest grief that I have heard of the death and
wounding of so many brave men, fallen not in honorable warfare, but
as the victims of darkly-planned treachery. Reinforcements are on
the way for a new and effective advance, and I feel convinced that
the army, sustained by our gallant navy, will not only maintain its
high reputation but will increase it.
? The many, now mourning the loss of husband, son or brother will
find comfort in the victory you will win!
?Both your Queens and your country have their eye fixed on you,
and trust in you.
?I felt the need of saying this to you to-day, the birthday of your
Queen and I ask you to join with me in crying:
?Long live the Queen.?
The period of anxious waiting was now over. The air was cleared. With
energy and courage a fresh advance was to be made, to be prudently and
circumspectly carried on till the goal was attained; our disasters were to
be avenged, further laurels added to our country?s crown!
For the navy too a new epoch was ushered in. The coast w r ould
have to be guarded against the introduction of contraband of war and
against the crossing of Balinese troops. On the 29th August the ? Koningin
Emma ? steamed up to the Balinese kampong Tanah Erabat, to the
North of Ampenan and discharged about 50 shells from her 12 c.m.
breach-loading howitzers. Later on in the course of the day more bomb-
shells were fired on Mataram from the 17 c.m. guns.
The ? Erins Hendrik ? threw some shells with the 12 c.m. howitzers
in the direction of Mataram, with probably very little damage to the
place as it was out of range.
During the following days a few shells were fired on Mataram by the
17 c.m. guns of the ?Koningin Emma?.
Of course this bombarding could not be productive of anything much.
How different would have been the result, if immediately after the
48


surprise Mataram and Tjakra had received instantaneous retribution from
ships lying close by! ?They were only respectively 5500 and 6500 metres
from the coast line.
To determine whether, if this were impossible at the time, it came
within the range of possibility at a later date, we must take a survey
of our available maritime resources in India, while preparations were
put forward for the reconstruction of the expedition.
It is only fair to admit that what we have to say on this point is
not exactly of an encouraging nature.
At the present time our Indian military marine consists of one iron-
clad, one protected corvette, fourteen gunboats, three paddle steamers, one
surveying ship, one torpedo boat, two guard ships and three smaller
surveying craft.
Belonging to the Netherlands Marine there are in India one iron-clad,
one protected cruiser besides two frigates, together forming the auxiliary
squadron. ?
The iron-clad, belonging to the Indian military marine, the Koning
der Nederlanden, a ramturretship built in 1871 ?1874 dates from the
early days of iron-clads. Of very moderate speed, with a very weak
side armour, a ram of doubtful strength, with no deck armour, without
any torpedo apparatus, it is unfit to satisfy even the most modest
requirements of the present day; while the armament consisting of
4.12 c.m. B. L. howitzers ?a gun of limited range and still more limited
accuracy ?and the old 28 c.m. muzzle loading turret guns originally
fitted.
Improvements which were made in other ships of this date which were
equally defective were omitted in the case of this ship.
The Koning der Nederlanden was withdrawn from the naval force
(Ist April) in the Atcheen waters and even on the way to the wharf at
Surabaya, had to put into dock at Singapore for repairs to the steam-
boilers, and to be scraped, as no way could be got on her, owing to
the foulness of her bottom.
If the Indian military marine had hitherto not derived much benefit
from this costly present, things might have assumed a different aspect
with the iron-clad Sumatra, a modern vessel, the only ship of this
class, well-armed; 1 gun of 21 c.m., 1 of 15 c.m., 2 cannons of
12 c.m. (85 calibres in length), all of new patterns and which had
respectively ranges of 12.000, 10.000 and 9000 metres with very flat
trajectory.
As we saw, the Sumatra was originally attached to the expedition,
and would, at the time of the reconstruction have proved invaluable, as
Mataram and Tjakra were well within the range of her guns, had it
not been for the fact that on the 15th August she had been compelled
to go into dock at Surabaya to undergo some urgent repairs, which
according to the colonial report ought to have been executed by the
end of August of that year; but which had not been completed.
Regarding the fourteen gunboats they were launched in the following


order: one in 1873, one in 1874, one in 1876, one in 1877 two in
1878, one in 1879, one in 1880, one in 1885, two in 1887, two in
1891, one in 1892 and according to the Colonial Report of 1895 they
are classified thus: J
in very good state:
the Bali, Borneo, hornbook, Sumbawa;
in good state:
the Cercim, Flores, Madura, Pontianak, and Batavia -,
still available:
the Padang, Sambas and Benkoelen-,
under repair;
the Java (since 24 June 1893) and the Makassar (since 1 Sept. 1893).
The oldest gunboats, excepting the Pontianak (1873) which was
provided with a 16 c.m. breachloader all carried a heavy breach-
loader of 18 c.m. calibre. This was the case with the Sambas (1874)
Batavia (1876) and the Makassar (1877). In addition to this all are
equipped with two 12 c.m. breachloader howitzers, with which it is
possible to fire at a range of 3600 metres.
The Padang and the Bali (1878), as well as the Benkoelen (1879)
the Madura 1880 and the Java (1885) all mounted a 15 c.M. 32 gun
having a range of 5000 Metres and 3 small breachloaders of 12 c.m.
This appears to have been the most flourishing period; the following
ships have no heavy breechloaders, they are only fitted with three 12
c.m. 13. L. howitzers, and to this series belong the Flores, and the
Ceram, both built in 1887, the hornbook and the built in 1891.
Fortunately the Borneo, launched in 1892, was better armed, even
though somewhat heavily for this class of boat, having 6 B. L. guns
of 10.5 c.m. 12 calibres in length, which, with a range of 9000 Metres,
could have very easily bombarded Tjakra Nagara. Unfortunately this
ship the only one qualified for the purpose?could only dispose of a
very limited amount of ammunition, viz. 110 rounds to her guns.
The reserve ammunition was on the way from Holland, for
owing to the fact that similar guns were not in use either by the
and foices or sea forces in India, a supply could be obtained in no
speedier way.
Needless to say that the utmost moderation had to be exercised in
firing these six guns.
Regarding the remaining vessels of the Indian military marine, we
have but little to say from the standpoint of our work.
The three paddle steamers date from 1874, 1877 and 1878 They
bear witness chiefly to the fact that in India, ships as well as people
can with care, live to a good old age.
The Ist class paddle steamers Merapi, is even fit for service, at least
when not in dock, which happens every now and then, according to
the Colonial Report: ?This vessel was in dock at Singapore in March
and Apnl 1894 and again in November. Of the two other 2nd class
paddle steamers the Sindoro was disqualified for service in May last at


Surabaya, and the other the Soembing was withdrawn from Borneo
temporarily in November 1894. Fortunately however the repairs were
completed by December 1894. 1
Our surveying ship, the Banda (1872) was in the docks at Surabaya
from the middle of May for repairs.
Our only torpedo boat, the ?Cerberus? was for the greater part
of the time in the stocks at Surabaya; and finally concerning our guardships,
the Gedeh, the guardship at Tandjong Priok, was without steamboilers
and a prey to white ants (Colonial report 1895) and only the Bromo (1874)
at Surabaja was in a state of efficiency.
Excepting the torpedo boat and the surveying ship, which can only
carry small guns, all these vessels are provided with 12 c.m. howitzers
at the outside, but the Merapi carries also two breachloaders of 16 cm.
Respecting the auxiliary Squadron, the ramship Brins Hendrik
Nederlanden, built in 1865?1866, although of earlier date than the
Honing der Nederlanden w r as in no way inferior to the latter.
The frigates the KoninginEmma der Nederlanden and the Tromp were
unarmoured and unprotected Ist class screwsteamers of moderate speed
and lighting capacity. Both mounted, besides 12 c.m. B. L. howitzers
guns, six of 17 c.m., with which, as the range of these latters was
5000 metres, it would have been possible to bombard Mataram, but
not Tjakra.
These then were the ships at the disposal of the Indian Marine.
What then could be done on receipt of the request: ?Send ships
immediately to Lombock??
Atcheen still required the lion?s share. Thirteen men-of-war were
still stationed in the waters of North Sumatra: der Nederlanden,
the gunboats Pontianak, Sambas, Batavia, Padang, Beukoelen, Madura,
Mores, Ceram, Lombok, Sumbawa, as well as the paddle steamers Merapi
and Sindoro. One ship was still stationed in the Southern and Eastern
division of Borneo the paddle steamer
By comparing this statement with the foregoing one, it is clear that
the Bali was the only available ship at Surabaya, while, besides the
two withdrawn, the Java and Makassar, four ships were undergoing-
repairs, viz; the Sumatra, Borneo and Tromp, and the surveying ship
Banda.
So that although it was decided that the naval portion of the expedi-
tion was to be as speedily as possible placed on a similar footing to
what it was originally, there was a wide distance between the decision
and its execution.
True, the opium cruiser Cgcloop was once again placed at the
disposal of the naval commander on the 29th August, to do despatch-
boat duty along with the Argus but what about the rest ?
The working power was inadequate to undertake the necessary repairs
to all the ships simultaneously. So it was settled to get the Tromp
which required least repair, ready for service at once.
The idea of sending the Sumatra to Ampenan was entertained at


first, as this boat might have rendered excellent service in helping the
Borneo to bombard Tjakra. However it was not carried out and,
instead of the Sumatra , the Bali was added to the expeditionary sea
force and along with the Borneo was got ready as quickly as
possible.
Meanwhile the Tromp reappeared in the harbour at Ampenan on the
2nd September in exactly the same condition as when she was sent to
Surabaya.
The writer of the article: ? The fleet for Lombock ? in Het Vaderland
(16 January 1894) says:
? Although the Tromp had not the full use of her steam power, yet
it w r as an enormous gain to have another ship, provided with a fairly
numerous crew and a battery, of sufficient calibre to keep up the fire
on Mataram.
?The presence of two large ships in the proximity of the bivouac being
sufficient for the present, one of the other two vessels, the Emma, or
the Brins Hendrik might conveniently have been despatched to guard
the strait, especially the bay of Kombal to prevent Gusti G?de Djilantik
crossing over to Karang Asem in one of his own ships.
?What did happen in reality?
?After the frigate Tromp had joined the naval force at Ampenan on
2nd September, the then commander of the naval force and at the
same time commander of the frigate Emma, withdrew this latter tempo-
rarily from the naval forces, by setting sail the following morning for
Macassar in order to fetch a fresh supply of coal.
?Me consider that the daily supply of coal for whatever use ought
to have been furnished from the stock of the boats belonging to the
Steam Navigation Company which should have been contracted for at
Batavia; and that under the circumstances this vessel should have
remained in the near neighbourhood of the headquarters, just as the
Brins Hendrik would have been a more suitable vessel for cruising
purposes; the useless attempt of the Commander-in-chief to keep the
ship at Ampenan must be looked upon as a most unfortunate
incident.
.... It is then a fact, however incredible it may appear, that on the
afternoon of 3rd September the Emma was nearly out of sight of the
ships in the harbour at Ampenan, setting sail for Macassar.?
In further explanation of this strange proceeding we must state that
on the morning of the 3rd September a conference was held at which
were present the Commander-in-chief, the second in command, the chief
of the staff, the commander of the Brins Hendrik, the naval captain
Backer Overbeek and the director of Internal Affairs, Scherer; the
importance of Djilantik?s arrest was held to be vital ?immediately after
the first attack, he had with his followers, made for Kombal bay on the
West coast ?consequently instructions were sent to the commander of the
Emma, who was preparing for departure, to remain where he was and
the commander of the Brins Hendrik was ordered to start immediately


for Kombal and seize Djilantik if possible, but at any rate to prevent
his crossing over to Karang Asem.
The letter containing the instructions for the captain of the Emma
was sent from headquarters at half past nine in the morning and was
taken by an orderly, who handed the document to some one from the
squadron, whom he met accidentally on the shore; this man took the
letter carefully to transmit it to the right person; but in the midst
of his work all thoughts of the precious letter went out of his mind!
When he remembered it, it was taken on board at about half past
twelve and it was the commander of the Erins Hendrik who received
it. The Koningin Emma was by this time out of sight. It was
fated to be so; but why was it that the Koningin Emma was in such
a hurry to depart, just at the very moment when her presence was so
much needed at Ampenan and there was in reality no need for her to
go to Macassar for coal? There would not have been the slightest difficulty
or objection to her borrowing a supply from the Tromp, just arrived
from Surabaya; and why did she stay longer at Macassar than was
necessary for the accomplishment of this task?
At the same time the Koningin Emma was carrying 450.000 florins
to Macassar, part of the war indemnity which had been saved. But
was it imperative that this should be done at this important time, when
the bivouac was far from safe and might any day require the help of
the naval brigade? Would it not have been feasible for the
which was frequently going backwards and forwards to Surabaya, to have
conveyed this money?
No; none of these are strong enough reasons. Had the commander
perhaps some special cause for desiring to leave Ampenan at this time?
In that case, other arrangements might have been made and at least the
precious ship could have remained in the harbour.
Finally, why did not the Commander-in-chief recall the Emma by
telegram, which (via Boeleleng) would have reached Macassar as soon
as the ship itself? Had this order been sent the Emma would have been
back in time?a couple of days previous to Djilantik?s flight.
So it came to pass that only two vessels were in the harbour at
Ampenan, and the Tromp daily discharged about ten shots on Mataram.
As the presence of both ships was positively indispensable for the safety
of the bivouac, there could be no further question of patrolling the coast.
It was only on the return of the Koningin Emma from Macassar on
the 12th Sept, and of the Bali and Borneo on the following day that
the idea of cruising could be put into execution.
By this date the bird had flown! On the 7th September Gusti
Djilantik with his followers had crossed over to Karang Assim in fif-
teen praos.
It was all very fine to say afterwards, as did formerly Siberg, the
Governor of Java to Reijke, Governor of Macassar when they were
compelled to desist in their attempts against Bali and Salamparang,
that practically speaking there was not very much to be regretted; that


after all it was perhaps for the best that Djilantik and his men had
left Lombock, as all fear of encountering hostilities from him were now
at an end; we think that in this instance the proverb of the ?sour
grapes? is very applicable.
What would it have mattered if our already so numerous enemies
had been increased by a hundred or so Balinese, the greater part of
whom were only armed with kris and spear, in comparison to the great
advantages attainable by the capture of Djilantik? This feat would
have ensured the simplest and most desirable result regarding affairs in
Karang Asem! Whereas now, notwithstanding all the declarations of
innocenee and friendship on the part of Djilantik, we are as far off as
ever from any settlement.
For we cordially agree in our opinion of him with that expressed by
Siberg of this prince?s ancestors; ?that they only remain our allies, as
long as they have any benefit to derive from our friendship!? The
Prins Hendrik was now commissioned to cruise about in Komal bay
on the West coast, and the Bali was sent to guard the East and North
coast. The Koningin Emma stayed in the harbour of Ampenan to the
North and the Tramp was stationed at the South of the bivouac
Under the existing state of affairs a bombardment would prove far
more effectual and was planned for the 18th September.
From the statements we have made it is perfectly clear that owing
to the unfavorable conditions of our navy in Indian waters, added to a
combination of unfortunate circumstances, the share to be taken by the
navy in the resumption of operations was not as important as might
otherwise have been both possible and expedient.
The question then arises as to what should constitute the strength of
our navy in India? To discuss the subject in detail would lead us too
far astray from our main point, so we will content ourselves with one
or two condensed remarks. The duties of the auxiliary squadron are
multifarious, as we know from various authorities, the late minister
Jansen, the commission of 1889, etc., they include: the protection of
small men-of-war, mail and packet boats; the maintaining of communi-
cation with foreign possessions; the protection of coast towns from
unexpected attacks; the keeping at bay of a hostile fleet and attack-
ing them on an attempt to land.
Is it possible to accomplish all these things with the force we
have named?
The retired vice-admiral Jhr. J. A. Roell expressed a very different
opinion in his recent pamphlet: ?De Zeemacht in Oost-Tndie?: (The
Naval force in East India.) in which he required 6 warships, 2 cruisers,
2 despatch-boats, 5 large and 4 small torpedo boats.
Serious thought will have to be bestowed on our coast defences; at
the present moment the only available ship for that purpose is the
Cerberus of the Indian Military Marine!
And the Marine itself? The number of ships is ample; but the
same thing is far from true regarding their actual intrinsic value; we


have already noted the fact that many have reached a respectable age,
but owing to that very reason they are continually being laid by for
repairs and for all practical purposes they might as well not exist.
We admit that the same requirements need not be insisted upon for
this marine as for the auxiliary squadron; and the arming with guns
of the whole Indian military marine, so as to satisfy the exigencies of
the times, would be too costly.
The history of this campaign has certainly demonstrated the need for
at least strongly arming a great number of our ships.
To equip the new ships v/ith modern guns is quite reasonable
and judicious.
U #
Why then is it that having done away with the old 12 c.m. breach-
loader, (dating 1867) for the Borneo in 1892, this was supplied to
the Nias, seeing that there are already so many similar ones in the
Indian military marine?
Doubtless the saving of half a ton, (50.000 florins) which would have
been the additional cost of three 10.5 c.m. similar to those of the
Borneo, (as they still had the 12 c.m. B. L.) was the motive of this
decision; but is it not just possible that this may be called mistaken
economy ?
It is only by powerful armament that these costly modern ships are
rendered effective.
It is with intense satisfaction that we have learnt from the re-
cent colonial report that the gunboat to be constructed this year of
the same class as the Nias is to be furnished with three 10.5 c.m.
B. L. guns.
We only express the fervent wish, that in other respects too, a new
era is dawning for the Indian military marine.
After the news of the disaster which had befallen the troops at
Lombock reached Magelang on the morning of the 28th August, orders
were issued at 6 p.m. to the 2nd Battalion stationed there, to make
immediate preparations to start for the seat of war on the following
morning.
There was decidedly not much time to prepare in; but a few
weeks before the battalion had been declared a marching battalion and
ought consequently to have been ready for marching.
Quite correct, but to comply with this demand, it is necessary that
the depot battalions should be in a position to replace at once all
who are absent or unfit for active service; and this is not at all
times easily managed.
The officer in command of the 2nd Batt. was in the hospital, one
captain, several lieutenants and a considerable number of soldiers were
missing or unfit for active service. These deficiencies had to be supplied
in great haste and as far as the men were concerned, they consisted
chiefly of young soldiers of the 2nd depot battalion who were in garrison
at Magelang.


i i The officers therefore had their hands full and it was late at night
before they could turn their attention to their own affairs. The following
morning there were many matters to be looked after; slight repairs to
rifles, exchanges to be effected, the delivery of cases and clothes, etc.,
so that it was 1.30 p.m., the hottest hour of the day, before the march
to Willem I. could be begun.
The knapsacks and baggage were carried by coolies, hired by the
civil administration, still a quick advance was impossible, partly owing
to the intense heat and previous fatigue and partly in consequence of
the large following of coolies. No matter what the width of the road
these men will walk one behind the other, and all the idlers on the road
and the carts, etc., get mixed up amongst them, which causes them to
get cut off, whereby great loss of time is occasioned.
If the troops had proceeded along the railway track from Semarang-
Willem I to Magelang, (a distance of 36 k.m.) the advantage of which
from a military standpoint has already been referred to, they would
have been enabled to embark the same afternoon, instead of which they
did not take ship until two days later.
And yet of what incalculable value these two lost days might have been.
Night quarters were taken up at Medono, (15 k.m. from Magelang)
which was reached about 6.30 p. m. and the following day they arrived
at Willem I. at half past twelve and were conveyed by train, on
31st August, straight to Semarang, where the battalion was to embark.
They reached this port at 11 a.m. and after the usual presentations to
the commander and colonel, the embarkation of the troops took place
much in the same enthusiastic manner as before described in speaking
of the other troops. Five large ?praos? carried the troops and a small
steamer carried the officers to the Co and by a quarter past twelve all
were safe on board.
In addition to the Coen, the Carpentier was also lying in the harbour;
both had left Batavia on the 30th August, bringing troops to complete
the 13th Battalion at Surabaya, and also field and mountain artillery
for Lombock.
They continued the voyage, the Carpentier reaching Ampenan the same
night, and the Coen at 6.30 a.m. on the 2nd September. By half past
nine all the troops were on shore.
On the same day that the troops of Central Java embarked at Sema-
rang, the reinforcements from East Java embarked at Surabaya. Infantry
of the 13th Battalion, a section of siege artillery and a detachment of
engineers (from Malang) left in the morning at ten by the Maetsmicker
and the observation corps destined for Boeleleng and consisting of a
company of the Bth Battalion (from Ambarawa) left two hours later
on the Japara.
The distance being short, the Maetsuijcker and the Japara reached
the roadstead of Ampenan on Ist September, and there they landed
13 officers and 361 infantry soldiers, (155 European and 206 natives)
besides two 12 c.m. B. guns and two 20 c.m. Mortars.


On the 4th Sept, a section of mountain artillery left Surabaya on
the Medan , and on the 9th the Speelman brought over the 15th company
of artillery. We will now give in detail the whole additional force:
Headquarters : Major General Segov; the chief of the Staff, Colonel J. J.
K. de Moulin, to whom Captain K. van Erpecum was attached;
two clerks.
Infantry : As commanders of the 6th and 9th Battalions Lieutenant-Colonels
E. M. A. A. E. Frackers and A. H. W. Scheuer, 4 captains,
15 lieutenants, 200 European, 100 Amhoynese, 100 Madurese,
and 100 native soldiers, besides the necessary transport and
complete equipment.
Artillery : In command of the division of field and mountain artillery
Major G. Feuilletau de Bruyn, to whom Lieutenant E. van
Thiel was attached as aide-de-camp.
cl. Field-artillery : 1 captain, 3 lieutenants, 72 European and 29 native
soldiers, with necessary transport; 3 officers and 47 troop-
horses and 1 mule.
h. Mountain-artillery: 1 captain, 2 lieutenants, 35 European and 38
native soldiers, with necessary transport, besides 1 officer
and 13 troop-horses and 33 mules.
c. Garrison-artillery : One company composed of 1 captain, 2 lieutenants,
99 European and 32 native soldiers and necessary cadre.
d. Attached to the Coehorn-mortars : 2 Europeans, 2 mules and
4 draft horses.
Total of the artillery: 11 officers, 198 European and
99 native soldiers, 65 horses and 36 mules.
Cavalry: 6 cavalry (troopers) soldiers and 6 troop-horses.
Engtneers : A section of engineers, 1 lieutenant, 4 European and 26 natives
strong.
Military administration: 4 lieutenant quarter-masters.
Medical department : 2 surgeons belonging to the Ist class, and three
belonging to the 2nd class, 4 hospital attendants, 12 nurses
and 12 bearers.
General Transport : 13 European infantry non-commissioned officers.
The topographical service was furnished with entirely new measuring and
drawing instruments; the engineers received a completely
new pontoon train, in addition to a reserve supply and
implements; the administration was provided with various
necessaries to replace clothes and camping equipment; the
medical department received cases of medicine and bandages,
litters, field beds and 70 tandoes. The consignment of
artillery was of considerable importance.
The artillery park was as follows: six rifled steel 7 c.m. B. L. guns,
for the field artillery, with nearly sufficient material for
the 2nd, 3rd and 4th line.
four 6 cm. B. L. guns for the mountain artillery, with 48
portable munition chests, etc.
two Bronse 12 c.m B. L. guns for the garrison-artillery and
two smooth-bore bronze 20 cm. mortars, which were subse-
quently increased by four 12 cm. B. L. guns, four 12 cm.
howitzers and four 20 cm. mortars.

The additional ammunition, besides what the batteries and sections
carried themselves consisted of one reserve supply for the
battery and two for the sections, besides:
300 shells, 300 cartridges and 60 rounds of shrapnel to
every 12 cm. gun and every 12 cm. howitzer, and 100 shells,
100 cartridges, 50 carcasses and 50 light-balls to every
20 cm. mortar and lastly 576,760 rifle and 23616 revolver
cartridges.
The reinforcement of the expeditionary troops consisted in:
the 2nd battalion of Infantry, small staff, 2 European and
2 Amboynese companies, the total strength of which was
18 officers, 333 European and 256 native soldiers, besides
194 convicts.

were all losses most amply replaced, but the expedition itself had
Ampenan from the beach,

assumed such increased proportions as to fully justify the Indian admi-
nistration in being proud of the result.
Who can describe the activity that now reigned in that harbour so
quiet and peaceful a few days before! Stately ships arrived in quick
succession, pinnaces, boats, praos going backwards and forwards
from the ships to the shore and from the shore to the ships, disem-


barking the personnel, all the baggage, and conveying the wounded
and seriously ill on board the Maetsuijcker, carrying the victuals
from the Koningin Emma and the Erins "Hendrik to the land division,
who on the arrival of the reinforcement returned on board their respective
ships, to land once again during the operations against Arung-Arung on
the 6th, 7th and Bth September.
The disembarking continues uninterruptedly and the sailors rendered
invaluable assistance. The greatest difficulty was experienced with the heavy
artillery and its equipment, but fortunately the sea was calm. The 12 c.m.
A. and the 12 c.m. howitzers were slid down a couple of planks
made fast to a connecting beam on the raft below, at a distance of 1
to 1.5 metre from each other. The mortars were lowered in the
same way, only with the planks so laid that the trunnions rested on
them. On shore they were dragged in the same manner on beams
over planks and rollers to the place where they were mounted.
The wheels were taken off the gun-carriages; and they were also
slipped down from the vessels on beams and as soon as they reached the
shore the wheels were put on again.
Special care had to be bestowed on the ammunition; now-a-days it can
be placed on the lighters in the cases in which it is packed and the
cases afterwards carried ashore by two or four men; sometimes the
cases were let down from the ship?s side on rollers being held on each
side by gunners.
But it was not only in the harbour that unusual animation prevailed,
the bivouac too presented an extraordinary scene of restless activity in
these early days of September. No sooner had the fresh troops landed
than they were immediately set to work, first to improve the safety
of the bivouac, and secondly to prevent their having time on hand to
see much of their harassed comrades or to talk with them as such
conversation would be sure to have a very depressing influence on the
new-comers.
The high road to Mataram was barricaded with sand bags and tree
trunks, and behind them were two 7.5 c.m. guns belonging to the navy,
which commanded the entire road and also the Balinese kampong.
On the East side was raised a high stone wall and a parapet was built
on the North and South sides. Bastions were constructed on the North
East and on the South East salients and each was provided with a
7.5 c.m. gun.
The whole was enclosed by abattis and a wire fencing. The 9th and
2nd battalion were posted in bamboo huts to the south and the 6th and
7th to the north of the main road. The headquarters were in the old
place and the hospital was in a roomy stone building in a nice open
space, as is shown in the accompanying sketch.
The inclosure is somewhat limited for all the troops now collected
here; but as soon as movement begins there will be ample accommo-
dation for every one.
And now that the basis of operations was fully protected and a fine

force, provided with everything needful, was available, an advance presented
no obstacle.
To ensure success two or three more precautionary measures were taken.
First of all an appeal was made to the Sassaks for their co-operation.
Political reasons had stepped in to prevent this earlier, but now that
the Lombock government was our avowed enemy, there was every
reason why the Sassak population should share in our action against
our common enemy.
A number of trusted Sassak chiefs were furnished with guns and
ammunition from the magazine at Ampenan while the Resident went
to the East coast on the Bth Sept, on the in order to discuss
with the chiefs a plan of attack against the Balinese.
His reception here, as well as on the North coast where he proceeded
later, was very favorable and great numbers of men came up from
Praja and other Sassak districts. But although there was not actually
any cause for complaint in their conduct, it certainly is a fact that they
left us to do the most dangerous and disagreeable part of the work,
from which they were to derive so much benefit.
It they did not render much practical service in the way of fighting ?
they were so undisciplined that their own chiefs had but little influence
over them ?still they were useful in other ways, while the efforts of
the Balinese by money bribes and promises were ineffectual in inducing
them to desert us; their innate hatred for their former rulers was too
deep-rooted.
As a further attempt to bring about different views amongst the
Sassaks, we cannot help referring to the fact concerning the Moham-
medan son of Anak Agoeng K?Toet, called Datoe Pangeran, who in the
beginning of September took refuge with fifteen of his followers in the
arms of the well-known chief of Praja, Goeroe Bangkol, alleging as his
reason that he had fled from Balinese territory to be with his own
co-religionists.
All our endeavour to get possession of the prince?s son failed. Our
written instructions to send Datoe Pangeran to Ampenan under a strong
escort remained as unheeded by Goeroe Bangkol, as did our summons
to him to come himself. Controller Engelberg met with no farther
success when he was despatched to Praja; Goeroe Bangkol informed
him that he could not possibly leave Praja during the present state of
affairs and further more that Datoe Pangeran feared his life would be
in danger if he went; at last he said point-blank that he did not
intend to deliver up the prince nor did he mean to go to Ampenan
himself either.
The only result of Engelberg?s mission was that Mami Sapian, nephew
of Goeroe Bangkol, returned with him to Ampenan.
Later on we shall see the part played behind the scenes by our friend
Gusti Djilantik and how his influence was brought to bear on the Praja
chief. The second measure consisted in mobilising the Madurese corps
of Bangkallan. Out of this corps, composed of 4 companies, 18 officers


i so^*ers strong, three companies were formed; in addition to
14 othcers and 437 soldiers, the instructors, Captain Otken of the infantry
ami two sergeants, and also 3 lieutenants and 27 men belonging to the
in antry, besides the necessary staff of the medical service and
transport were attached to it. This corps set out for Lombock on the
lot September under Raden Majang Koro, whose acquaintance we
have already made.


YIL
OPERATIONS FOR THE SIEGE OF MATARAM.
The operations were now in full swing.
On the 4th September a scouting party went out in a N. E. direction,
and like those who went out on the 80th August, they were able to
see that the enemy was throwing-
up breastworks, beginning near the
dessa Aroeng-Aroeng in a Southerly
direction.
Before however attempting to
destroy these defences, it was
necessary for us to occupy the
Sassak kampong of Kaleh, on the
left bank of the river Ant jar, and
from there we could enfilade the
enemy?s line. *
This kampong was taken without
loss on the sth September. It
was found that the breastworks of
the Balinese had no rear-face.
There could be no question of
enfilading. Still it was perfectly
easy to do some sharp shooting
against the enemy?s line.
So this point was occupied by 2
infantry companies of the 9th
battalion (Major Scheuer) with a
section of field artillery.
That same day, two 12 c.m. B. L.
?Soldier of the Topographical department.?
guns escorted by a company of infantry were placed in battery against
the enemy?s position, in a small Dewa-temple, directly East of Capitan
and West of the road, since destroyed.
It was decided that the attack should take place on the morning of the
* The whole plan of attack during the further course of the struggle was settled beforehand
with maps. This great advantage was due to lieutenant van der Zwaan of the survey corps.


6th under the command of Colonel Swart with his battalion, the 2nd,
supported by the 7th (Major Van Blomraestein) and the two remaining
companies of the 9th, as also by the field artillery and the engineers.
The 6th battalion remained behind with the naval brigade to protect
the bivouac.
We will quote the orders that were issued to the 2nd battalion the
day before the attack; they will show what precautions were to be taken
in advancing:
?To-morrow morning at half past five the companies must be prepared
for action against Aroeng-Aroeng.
?The soldiers will wear their marching kit without knapsacks, but they
will carry their quilts and sling their great coats over their shoulders.?
? Dry provisions of food for one day shall be carried in the haversacks.?
?Coffee or tea in the field flasks.?
? Each company will take its own pioneer equipment, as well as reserve
ammunition cases, containing 400 cartridges; every man was carrying 60.?
?To each company are allotted 4 ?tandoes.??
?With the staff of the battalion will move 80 tandoes; and for each
company 8 cases of spare ammunition are available.
? Breakfast is to consist of half a loaf, butter and cheese (or mince or
sardines) and coffee, besides rice and smoked meat.
?A dram will be given to each man before starting.?
After a heavy preliminary discharge of the artillery?s guns, the regular
attack was opened at half past ten. The advance was made cautiously
and as much under cover as possible. Not a shot was fired by the enemy.
At the sound of the first shots they had lost heart, and retreated from
the position they had used such strenuous efforts to fortify, leaving behind
them a large supply of arms amongst which were several repeating guns.
The only sign of life that was given was the discharge of about four
cannon shots from the Western entrance to Mataram; and it is probable
that they used one of the field guns we had been obliged to leave
behind. The projectiles went however straight into the sea.
Thus it came about that we were enabled, without any loss, to occupy
the stronghold of our enemy. And now we were able to appreciate
how strong the position was. The road was cut between Ampenan
and Aroeng-Aroeng. Behind the chief line of defence, half way to
Aroeng-Aroeng, there was a second parapet about six feet high right
across the road. There were others in and around the kampong itself,
behind the strong Dewa-temple.
A great deal of pains and labour had been bestowed upon the main
position. This extended from the S. W. angle of Aroeng-Aroeng in a
Ane running from North to South, to nearly as far as the river Antjar.
It consisted of a clay parapet 2 metres high, one metre thick at the
top and 2 metres thick at the base and it was perforated with hundreds
of holes in which were placed hollow bamboo stems, through which to fire.
These loopholes were made in two rows, the upper one at the height
of a man?s chest and slanting downwards; the lower one at the height

were slanting to the right and to the left towards the centre.
Had the enemy counted on a repetition of the drama of Tjakra?
The Dewa-temple was occupied by two companies and one, section of
field artillery under the command of Colonel Swart.
In the interest of future action, the chief goal of which was of
course Mataram, the next few days were spent in constructing a fortified
post and in preparations for placing the battering-guns. ; The two 12
c.m. B. L. guns, which were no longer required at Kapitan were brought
over, and on the Bth September were brought two 20 c.m. mortars
and on the 12th two 12 c.m. guns. So that on that day there were in
position four 12 c.m. guns, two mortars and two field pieces; besides
the captain in command, there were two officers, five subordinate officers,
5 corporals and 80. soldiers of the garrrison artillery.

'I he breastwork of the S. W. line of fortification in which was the siege battery, was principally composed'
of klapper and pinang trunks laid flat. The Dewa-temple formed the line of defence to the N. E.
Before however attempting to attack Mataram in front, they followed
the same road as before in order to try and seize the important kam-
pongs on the south, viz., Pasinggahan and Pagasangan. If we obtained
possession of these points, then we should command all the roads on
the East side, to Mataram and Tjakra, and the south; and we should
obtain a fresh and excellent basis of operations against the chief object
of Balinese power.
But the capture of these extensive kampongs, 1500 metres long by
1000 metres broad and intersected by a multiplicity of complicated walls,
was not to be such an easy matter.

Was it not to be feared that the enemy would take advantage of our
action in the South East to make an attack against our bivouac in the
Noith East? On the 11th September a scouting party was sent out to
gather information on that head.
An advance was made in the direction of Rembega with six companies
and a section of mountain artillery; the Balinese had fled from all the
dessas and no hostilities were experienced; at the very first shot the
Sassaks, who had remained behind at Rembega, hoisted the white flao-.
Ampenan was reached without let or hindrance by Avay of Aroeng-Aroeno-.
On the following day a heavy artillery fire was opened against Pasin?-
gahan and Pagasangan from our positions at Kaleh and Aroeng-Aroeng.
At Kaleh the engineers threw a bridge across the river Antjar and
this post was the same day further fortified with two field guns
and firing was directed against Poenia, which is a Southern division
of Mataram.
Dining the night of 12th 18th September a few salvos were discharged
against Pagoetan, a Kam-
pong lying South East, to
prevent any help being
brought in from that di-
rection.
The ] Bth September is
the day fixed for the attack
against Pagasangan and
Pasinggahan.
The Koningin Emma,
as well as the Tromp and
the Borneo having come
into the harbour the pre-
vious day, received orders
from the Commander-in-
Scale 1:8000
chief to open fire on Mataram and its environs so as to prevent help
coming from the North. The two first named threw each 100 shells of
17 c.m. and the Borneo sixty 10.5 c.m. shells.
Ihe naval Brigade of the Koningin Emma and the 325 men
under command of Ist class Lieutenant Van Wessem were disembarked
in order to occupy the bivouac and from the following day they
constituted the permanent garrison of Ampenan. For still greater
security there were left three companies of the 6th Battalion and
the cavalry. The latter supported by a section of infantry made a
reconnoissance of the districts to N. E.
At six o?clock in the morning a column was ready to advance under
colonel Swart and it was composed of the 2nd and 9th infantry battalion,
one section of mountain artillery and one of field artillery, besides two
sections of engineers with the necessary Transport and ambulance. The
loute to be followed was across Kaleh to the sawah plain, lying to the
South East of the kampong.


A second column composed of two companies of the 7th battalion, a
section of mountain artillery and a detachment of engineers, under
Major van Blommestein was to protect the right wing of the attacking
column against being surrounded by the hostile forces. With this object
in view this column marched to the sawah, south of Batoe Ringgit and
then followed a more easterly line, until it took up its position opposite
the cemetery in the Western division of Pasinggahan.
Major Hamerster was appointed staff officer of the first column and
Lieutenant de Greve of the second. The chief of the staff remained with
the Commander-in-chief, who directed the whole movement.
During the advance march the guns at Aroeng-Aroeng and Kaleh
w T ere to be directed against the kampongs. When this became dan-
gerous for the advancing column, then South Mataram and Poenia were
to be brought under fire instead.

sangan as the troops advanced; these were replied to by a few vollies
and the column then took the kampong by storm.
The enemy was unprepared for attack in this quarter and retreated
eastwards. Only here and there a few Balinese armed with spears
remained behind in the houses, but they were soon driven away.
Leaving in the rear a reserve of two companies, the section of field
artillery and part of the train, the column advanced across the kampongs
in an Easterly direction. There was such a labyrinth of walls however,
that in order to avoid a repetition of Tjakra it was deemed advisable,
before advancing further, to make quite secure the positions already
taken and to shake by artillery fire the strong posts still held by
the enemy.
A favorable spot for a strong position was found in the Dewa-temple,
situated at the northern exit of Pagasangan, close to the more westerly
of the two roads which run from this dessa to Mataram. The temple


was put in a state of defence and occupied by three companies of the 9th
battalion and two mountain guns.
The remaining troops of the main column were posted outside the
ewa-temple fox the protection of the workers; the convicts attached
to the column were told off to clear the ground as much as possible.
The fortification?called Pagasangan-West- was victualled for two days
from Kaleh, while the troops returned to Ampenan at half past five in
the evening via Kaleh, excepting of course those in occupation, leaving
there two guns.
What had happened during this interval to Van Blommestein?s column?
While the section of mountain artillery kept up fire against the North
.side of lagoetan (S.E. of Pasinggahan) in order to prevent support
coming from the Balinese on that side, the column in order to maintain con-
nection with the first column, pushed through to Pasinggahan on the
west side and suddenly met with heavy opposition on the south of the
high load leading to Tjakra, through the kampong of Tandjong-
Karang. It was quite evident that the Dewa-temple at this point was
strongly fortified by the Balinese.
A remarkable thing occurred here; while that part of the kampong
situated on the south side of the road was powerfully held by the
Balinese, on the north side we met a host of the Sassak population
strengthened by a couple of thousand armed men from Praja, so that
these two opposing elements were really only separated from each other
by the road and the walls running alongside. These latter were however
maintaining an attitude of non-interference!
An unsuccesful effort was made by Scherer, the director of native admin-
istration to prevail upon these Sassaks to knock down the walls in the
icai and flank of the column as it advanced?which would have been
most advantageous.
Ihe Sassaks refused to accede to Ins demand so Jong as they had the
Balinese in the kampong fronting them?the Balinese being ever so much
better equipped for fighting, the decision of the Sassaks may perhaps
be excused.
Major Van Blommestein sent out a reconnoitring party under Lieute-
nant de Greve to discover how matters lay at the Dewa-temple; but
no result was obtained. True, they came within 75 metres of it? still
the maze of walls made anything like a satisfactory survey impossible.
Although our men were sent under cover of a couple of sections of
infantry, they were forced by the heavy firing from the temple to retreat
to the cemetery in the Western division of Pasinggahan.
All attempts to get the Dewa-temple under well-directed artillery fire failed.
Appieciating at once the importance of this point, the Commander-in-
chief sent a conipany of the 9th Battalion to the assistance of Major
van Blommestein, but still the temple remained impregnable.
In face of such stubborn resistance, the Commander-in-chief well
knowing, that to take the temple by mam force would entail serious
losses, decided upon a different course of action.


V
\ ground
; It was however too late to carry it out that day; so at five o?clock
the general order to march home was given.
The company of the 9th battalion, despatched to assist Major van
Blommestein, remained stationed at Kaleh.
Our losses on that day were 2 killed and 7 European wounded. The
14th September was chiefly spent in fortifying our situation at Paga-
sangan West and in clearing the ground, which was achieved with very
slight loss on our side, by about a hundred convicts and under cover
of two companies of the 6th and two of the 7th battalion under command
of Captain Christan.
Owing to the limited space the garrison was reduced to two com-
panies of the 9th battalion, and the two other companies of this bat-
talion relieved the garrison at Kaleh.
The Sassaks worked at a road from Kaleh to' Sekar Bela, constructed
a couple of bridges across the aqueducts and levelled the ground,
so as to facilitate the transport of the
heavy loads on the following day.
It having become apparent on the 13th
September that the difficulties in connec-
tion with taking the strong kampongs by
storm were too great, it was decided
further to shake the enemy by more
powerful artillery fire and in order to
accomplish this, it was necessary to find
a suitable place for the batteries at
Sekar Bela.
At six o?clock in the morning of the
15th September a column advanced under
command of Colonel Swart, to whom
Lieutenant de Greve was attached as staff-
officer and it was composed of the 2nd

battalion and one company of the 7th, one section of mountain artillery
and two sections of engineers, besides a few orderlies.
The column was to march to Sekar Bela through Kaleh, where one
company of infantry and a section of engineers were to be left. This
company had to transport a 20 cm. mortar (which was to be conveyed
by a second column to Kaleh) to the new post which was to be estab-
lished. The section of engineers were to assist the second column in
crossing over certain aqueducts (by means of a portable bridge now at
Kaleh) between Kapitan and Kaleh.
The column itself had to take with it for the new fortification a
12 c.m. howitzer, which had been transported to Kaleh the previ-
ous day.
Arriving at Sekar Bela at 8 a. m. Colonel Swart?s column took up its
position on the West front of Pasinggahan and a small cemetry on the
East of Batoe Ringit and South of the main road to Tandjong Karang,
was chosen for the position of the entrenched artillery. Very little

disturbance was experienced and after a few vollies the protecting troops
were left unmolested and the work continued without interruption and
when the company that had been left behind at Kaleh arrived with the
20 c.m. mortal at half past nine, firing was able to be begun an hour
later with the two guns in an Easterly direction.
The 2nd column, consisting of the 7th battalion and a section of
Cohorn-mortars under Major Van Blommestein had meanwhile started
Ampenan and gone through Kaleh to our fortified position in
West Pagasangan, and there he had found some sharp firing going on,
nor did the Balinese desist until they became aware of fire being opened
fiom the new post at Sekar Bela. Major Van Blommestein remained
that day at Pagasangan to help in strengthening the fortification of the
JJewa-temple.
In consequence of information that the Balinese were contemplating
an attack against our coast bivouac, one of the two companies of the
9th battalion at Kaleh was despatched to assist Ampenan, where besides
the naval division 200
men strong, there
were three other com-
panies.
Meanwhile the firing
from the new post
was kept up and the
section of mountain
artillery also took part
in it as soon as it
was perceived that a
large concourse of
Balinese had arrived
at Pagoetan.
Sekar Bela. Seale - ifisnnn
i ? .? r-u ? f p , The Commander-
in-chief with his Chief of the Staff had in the interval gone to Sekar
ea, 10m which place the enemy was being beaten backwards slowly
nt sine y though he still held out obstinately in the eastern division
amongst the complicated and intricate walls. The Sassaks, who
lac gained moie courage since the morning, made an unsuccessful
attempt to push through, but were driven back, with some loss in killed
and wounded.
As the artillery fire had not yet had the desired effect on the defenders
and as the day was rather advanced, the Commander-in-chief decided to
return to Ampenan, as fair progress had been made with the additional
reinforcements.
Here, as at Kaleh, one company and a half was left in occupation.
Leaving the two Cohorn-mortars at Pagasangan West, Major Van
Blommestein also returned to Ampenan.
Meanwhile a welcome reinforcement of 650 convicts had been brought
there on the ship Gouverneur-Generaal Jacob. �


And the next day witnessed the arrival of the Generaal Pel with
8 companies of Madurese under the command of their experienced old
commander, Raden Majang Koro.
On the 16th September a great deal of time was devoted to clearing
the ground round the scene of conflict. West Pagasangan and outskirts
being thickly wooded, this work was of great importance, for the trees
afforded cover to the enemy, who were thus able to afflict many losses
upon us.
A strong division of convicts was told off for this purpose, under
cover of a column 6 companies strong under Major van Blommestein
with Captain Willemstijn as chief of the staff?but twice during the day
the enemy?s fire so was severe, that the work had to be temporarily
suspended.
Victuals and ammunition were brought in and all the final prepara-
tions for the great attack of the morrow were completed.
Early next morning two columns advanced towards that part of the
kampongs still in possession of the Balinese.
The first was under command of Colonel Swart and had for starting-
point Sekar Bela from which place it marched in an Easterly direction
and the second was commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Scheuer, marching
in a Southerly direction from Pagasangan; the columns were to meet and
continue the onward march in an Easterly direction together. A reserve
of 200 convicts under captain Schmid ham er was ready at Sekar Bela to
clear the ground behind the troops, as soon as they had forced their
way through the kampongs.
The columns were supplied with an exceptional number of stretchers,
as severe resistance was anticipated.
Captain Creutz Lechleitner?s two companies for the present formed
a reserve to cover the right wing from an attack from Pagoetan.
The Commander-in-chief, with whom was the chief of the staff,
directed all the operations.
Since daybreak the fire of the artillery had been preparing the attack:
from Sekar Bela against the kampongs; from Arong-Arong against south
Mataram on the road from Tjakra to Pagasangan; from Kaleh against
Poenia, to prevent as far as possible, help being sent to the enemy
from those places.
At 8 a. m. the actual attack was begun. A furious beating of the
tom-tom summoned to battle every Balinese man capable of carrying
arms; and strong re-inforcements came hurrying in from Tjakra. Both
columns were soon engaged in a hot fusillade; the hostile projectiles fly
far away above their heads, ?it is fortunate that the Balinese were shooting
too high, ?the sharp hissing sounds of the bullets from their repeaters
being drowned by the fire of our skirmishers, the thunder of our volleys,
the roar of our big guns.
Gallantly and rapidly our lines advanced through hedges and shrubs,
over walls and thickets, through the gaps and breaches made by
our guns from Sekar Bela. Bit by bit, but always with the same elan.


the Balinese posts were taken one after another. Within an hour and a
half of the first charge being made, our troops became masters
of the two kampongs; the strong Dewa-temple, with walls so thick that
it cost the engineers many hours of labour to destroy them with
dynamite, was deserted by the enemy, who retreated carrying as many
of their dead and wounded as they could to Tjakra Nagara.
A great number of the killed had to be left behind in the
dessas; and many Balinese concealed themselves in the houses. Our
troops however did not trouble to hunt them out, everything was
given to the flames. Sheets of fire blazed forth from thousands
of dwellings, sheds and barns, destroying everything in their furious
course: household goods, domestic animals, bodies alike of dead and
living; and in the midst of these devouring flames, which scorch and
singe our troops, * appear from all sides crowds of hungry Sassaks,
who, quite in their element, dived about in and around the burning
embers to secure what booty they could.
Great and enthusiastic was the joy of our men at such a great success
with so few casualties, only four men were wounded; and proportionately
great was the distress of the Balinese at their defeat : they had had to
fly from one of their strongest posts and their losses in killed were
by no means trifling - from information brought in by spies the number
was 250 ?amongst whom Gusti Loeki, a son of the deceased Made,
Anak Agoeng G?de Poetoeh, besides 50 missing.
Confidence in our strength was restored, the belief of our allies in our
power was revived, and the hopes of the enemy received a severe
check. A great multitude of Balinese retreated to the North and sought
shelter in the mountains. As soon as the kampongs of Pagoetan and
Soekadana, S. East of Pasinggahan, were deserted by the enemy, the
Sassaks set fire to them.
Ought the Commander-in-chief to have taken advantage of the terror
we had inspired and pushed forward on Mataram at once?
The rules of tactics lay down the necessity of improving a
victory, and taking all the circumstances into consideration, it is not
improbable that our troops might have entered Mataram at the same
time as the retreating foe and have at once become master of this
important point.
The Commander-in-chief however preferred to be on the safe side; after
all that had already happened he was anxious to avoid even the chance
of defeat.
And his decision is quite comprehensible?many roads lead to Rome
and the Commander-in-chief is proved to have chosen wisely.
The first thing to be done was to make ourselves secure in our new
possessions and raise new entrenchments from which Mataram and Tjakra
Nagara can be cannonaded.
* The heat of the fire was at times so intense that Scheuer?s column was forced to take
a hy-path thus losing connection with Swart?s column. For that reason the Commander-in-
chief prohibited the place being set on fire on the occasion of the attack against Tjakra.


As soon as our men were masters of the East front of Pagasangan,
the Commander-in-chief ordered a new post to be constructed on the main
road to Mataram, on the North of the little ravine.
The second column was instructed to execute this plan and was covered
by the first, who were stationed in the South East of Pagasangan, to
prevent an assault from that side.
All the available convicts, as well as the Sassaks from Sekar Bela,
North-Pasinggahan and Praja were meanwhile employed in levelling the
ground and clearing away the debris. This was no small task with such
a labyrinth of walls and Controller Engelenberg had the greatest diffi-
culty in keeping the Sassaks to their work and even their chief, Mami
Sapian, seemed to have little or no authority over them.
As soon as the new fort was far enough advanced for occupation, the
Commander-in-chief returned to Ampenan, followed by Swart?s column.
Captain Scheuer was left at the new station with 2 companies of the 9th
battalion, with one section of field artillery and one section of mountain
artillery (both without
horses), the field artillery
from Kale besides one
section of engineers. Owing
to the dangerously advanced
situation and on account
of the still rather elemen-
tary arrangements Captain
Willemstijn stayed that
night with Major Scheuer.
At the Dewa-temple,
West-Pagasangan, under
Captain Christan, were the
two remaining companies
of the 9th Battalion with one
Pagasangan East. Scale : 1 to 8000.
(unhorsed) section of mountain artillery and one section of Cohorn-mortars,
(without mules). At Kaleh, under Major van Blommestein 2 companies of
the 7th battalion and one (unhorsed) section of field artillery; at Sekar
Bela Captain Tuinenberg with company of last named battalion. This
post could not be left before the clearance at Pasinggahan and Pagasangan
nad made more progress and until the new fort was quite ready. Finally
at Arong-Arong there was Major Trackers with 2 companies of the 6th
battalion and 1 (unhorsed) section of field guns.
In the next few days we shall not follow the movements of the
troops in consecutive order. We will only mention that under strong
cover the work of demolishing the kampongs was daily pursued by
hundreds of convicts, and also by Sassaks under Controller Engelenberg;
the transport of victuals, ammunition and- material to the various
stations was continued, and great assistance in this was received from the
naval Brigade and the Madurese troops and finally the fortified post at East
Pagasangan was completed. On the 19th September 150 convicts trans-


ported there three 12 c.m. howitzers; on the 21th one 20 c.m. mortar and
on the 25th one 12 c.M. B. L. gun was conveyed there, as well as an
artillery force of 2 officers, 8 sergeants, 6 corporals and 19 soldiers.
In order to prevent an approach to Pagasangan or Pasinggahan on
the South, Captain Willemstijn selected a point to the South of the
latter kampong where three small forts were constructed, each to be
occupied by a section of infantry. During the night of 19th?20th September
an attempt was made to regain possession of Pagoetan, this design was
however thwarted by the Sassaks, who next morning presented the
Commander-in-chief with the head ot the late chief of the village, Ida
Njoman Karang.
The wind was beginning to point to the approach of the west mon-
soon, so instructions were sent out to all the posts to take every
measure for improving the quarters for the troops and pay great
attention to the ammunition stores.
The condition of all the roads required attending to also and the
Sassaks were put to work to do all the necessary repairs.
On the 22nd September the small forts for the three sections of
infantry were ready for occupation.
At about half past four that morning soon after a round had been
fired from the 12 c.m. howitzer at East Pagasangan against Tjakra Nagara,
two enormous columns of fire lighted up the air, followed by such a
tremendous shock that it was felt at Ampenan.
A powder magazine near the poeri had been blown up, causing a
terrible conflagration at Tjakra, and of course our troops took advantage
of the terrible confusion to keep up incessant firing in the same direc-
tion, so as to prevent the enemy?s being able to extinguish the flames.
From information brought in by the spies the cannonading was
afterwards directed from Arong-Arong and Pagasangan East chiefly
against the East of Mataram and the N.W. of Tjakra, where the
?enemy had fled from the devouring flames.
The same day saw the completion of the work at Pagasangan and
Pasinggahan, which places were levelled to the ground and the small
forts were also ready to receive their respective sections from West
Pagasangan.
Amidst all the laborious toil of these last few days, the physical
condition of the men kept up marvellously; the sick list w r as as low as
four to five per cent of the men and the most general complaint
was dysentery.
At the time fixed for operations against Mataram, the distribution of
troops and guns outside Ampenan was as follows:
At East Pagasangan: 2 companies of infantry, 2 field guns with
their detachments, but without horses, one detachment of garrison-artillery
to serve three 12 c.m. howitzers, one 12 c.m. B. L. gun and one 20
?c.M. mortar; at West Pagasangan; one platoon of infantry with one
unhorsed mountain gun in each of the three blockhouses, one section of
infantry. '


At Kaleli: one company of infantry with 2 horsed field guns; at
Arong-Arong: 2 companies of infantry, 2 unhorsed field guns, one
detachment of fortress-artillery to serve four 12 c.ra. guns and two'
20 c.m. mortars. -
We must first see what was going on outside the actual area of the
battle field.
Besides sheer fighting the art of war resorts to other means of har-
assing the enemy and precipitating his defeat and amongst these is the
cutting off of his supplies, and preventing the importation of all contra-
band of war.
By decree of 13th September more stringent clauses were added to the
June proclamation regarding the imports to and exports from and con-
veyance through Lombock of such contraband. All import or export
trade was prohibited on the West and North coast from Labuan Thing
to Ayer Putih for all private individuals, excepting in special cases
where licenses were held by Sassaks or Macassars.
?Article I. All import and export to or from the North or West
coast of the island of Lombock is prohibited, excepting it be for the
requirements of the country or by special leave of the military or civil!
authority, who is invested with the fullest civil power in this island.
Article 11. Infraction of this law, embodied in Article I, will be-
punished with a fine of from one thousand to fifteen hundred guilders
(florins) and confiscation of the goods, with which it has been sought to
infringe the law.?
The vessels and material (the latter in so far as they are not of &
nature to be confiscated on other grounds), by means of which violation
or attempted violation of the law has been committed, may be seized
to pay the fine and to defray the expenses of the legal process.
Attempt to infringe the law carried with it the same penalty as
infringement itself; (art. Ill) in case of infringement the masters of the
ships, or in default of these, all the passengers and crew were held
guilty, etc., (art. IV).
On the sth October still further and more severe clauses were added,
it having become evident during the progress of operations that com-
munication between the Balinese kampongs on the A. W. coast with the
centres of Balinese power at Mataram and Tjakra (across the Punikan.
mountains), was very much easier than had been imagined.
While the squadron was cruising round the West and North coast,,
the Sassaks of Praja and Sekar Bela were appointed to block the road
South of Pasinggahan in the direction of Kediri, and the Sassaks on
the East coast were to prevent all transport of rice and contraband of
war in that district. In order to keep a close watch over these people
and to see what was going on amongst them, Controller Engelenberg
was sent to the East coast, where he established himself at Teros. On
the West coast the civil staff was increased and strengthened by a
European commissioner, having in view the same objects as Engelenberg.
Eurther, the Sassaks were incited to possess themselves of all the rice

tlic\ could lay hands on and carry it oft to their own kampongs, a
behest which it was unnecessary to repeat, they being only too willing
to fall in with the proposal, not only thereby to coerce the Balinese,
but as a preventive against the prolonged famine which w r as bound to
follow from the non-cultivation of the rice fields.
Iheie was only a very limited district on the East of Tjakra, towards
Lingsar, from which the Balinese were now able to receive supplies of
rice; unfortunately, for the present, our endeavours to induce the Sas-
saks of Batu Klian to assume the offensive remained wuthout effect.
Armed Ualinese.
But on the other hand they were active in the North and on the
14th September burned to the ground the princely palace of Gunung Sari.
The kampong of Tandjong, where the Balinese had accumulated large
quantities of rice, was bombarded on the 16th and 17th September and
on the second day the place was a prey to the flames; satisfied with
the result the ?Bali? ceased firing, after which the friendly part of the


Sassak population broke into the kampong and finished the work of
annihilation, after carrying off no end of arms, amongst which 6 native
cannon, with ammunition.
As we have already mentioned, the civil authorities were kept busy
with our allies and besides this there was another cause for continuous
supervision over the native element.
There is no doubt that an elaborate system of espionage was kept up
by the Balinese, which proves that the prince must have possessed a
well-filled treasury.
It required endless and incessant superintendence to keep watch over
the swarms of Arabs and Chinese who came loitering round the camps
with their wares for sale, and over those Sassaks, who had lived among
the Balinese, and who partly from fear and partly from love of gain or
from relationship, were in favor of the ruling race.
Several of these were arrested, but eventually released from lack of
evidence against them; one solitary one, against whom the proofs were
overwhelming, was hanged.
As it was essential that we should not be duped by these native
spies, and at the same time imperative that we should be informed by
them of the enemy?s plans, it was necessary that this special branch of
the service should be confided to some person eminently fitted for the
purpose and the recorder of Batavia, Heer Yalette was appointed to
the post.
We have already seen that precautions against the West; monsoon
were taken as regards the bivouacs and the inland lines of communi-
cation ; the insecurity of the harbour at Ampenan during that season
has already been referred to, so it was necessary to provide against
being cut off from communication with the warships and the Indian
government and the outside world generally. Of course a pier would
have been the simplest and best plan, but we have already seen that
insurmountable obstacles had prevented the construction of one, long
before our arrival.
Would it not have been feasible to open up communication between
Ampenan and the sheltered little bay of Labuan Tring, by means of a
Decauville train? j
Captain Willemstijn was commissioned to go and examine ?the bay;
he went on the steamship Cycloop and made a survey in a Northern
direction. He was accompanied, by the well-known kampong chief of
Ampenan ?whose treachery was still unknown at headquarters?and was
most assiduously assisted by him. Did he expect by this show of
friendship to turn aside all suspicions from himself? If so, he was
mightily mistaken, for shortly after Captain Willemstijn?s return, reports
were received at Ampenan from Lindgreen, proving beyond doubt the
chief?s guilt, and in consequence he was immediately arrested and con-
veyed to Surabaya.
The chart drawn by Lieutenant Van der Zwaan as a result of Captain
Willemstijn?s survey only went to demonstrate the impracticability of the


intended place. It was soon apparent that from one cause or another
the obstacles were insuperable.
bo there was no alternative left but to come back to the idea of construct-
ing a pier at Ampenan. An examination made by Major Marcella of the
engineers, who had come over purposely to study the question, showed
the feasibility of the plan, so it was now resolved to carry it out.
In anticipation of the interruption of communication between the
posts, certain to be caused by the West monsoon, an order was
given to lay down lines of Decauville railway between the various points.
We must not omit to mention the offers of support offered to us by
the Princes of South Celebes: the Princes of Goa, of Sidenreng, of
Wadjoe and the Princess of Tanette, who all volunteered to send us
auxiliary troops.
How were the Macassar princes concerned with Lombock? We have
seen that in Chapter IV, in reviewing our early relations with them.
Tradition?that powerful factor amongst the natives?according to the
treaty of Ponay 1667, had decreed how they were to act in cases when
we were threatened by any of those petty states, which might be included
in this Bonay alliance.
Ihe princes assembled their troops and led them to Macassar, the
capital. Here were mustered 2000 Goa and 8000 Bugis soldiers, dressed
in red jackets and short white trousers and armed with Remington rifles
and all withdrew to a camp outside the town. The Bugis princes and
princesses were received in audience by the Governor of Celebes and
Dependencies, Van Braam Morris, and a company of infantry and a
detachment of cavalry formed a guard of honour outside Government House.
Here they expressed their wish to stand by the Government and to
avenge the treachery, which had raised indignation all through Celebes.
The Government, much touched by this proof of friendship, left it
to the judgment of the Commander-in-chief of the expeditionary army
to reply to this disinterested proposal.
It is beyond doubt that the Macassar and Bugis auxiliaries might
have rendered us invaluable services and the history of our Indian wars
relates many instances where we have drawn no inconsiderable benefit
from the troops of our allies. As they are, however, especially fitted
for guerilla warfare their services were hardly needed in Lombock, as
we had the Sassaks at our disposal for that.
Besides from a political standpoint it was undesirable to introduce a
new element into the island and allow the Macassars to get mixed up
with Lombock affairs and perhaps eventually gain too much influence.
The Government therefore in the name of the Commander-in-chief
thanked them very politely for their kind offer; much disappointed,
the auxiliaries were disbanded by the princes of Bugis and Macassar
and taken back to their respective districts.
It is scarcely conceivable that the inhabitants of the capital were
much disappointed or felt particularly grieved at the departure of
these thousand warriors from Macassar!


IX.
CAPTURE OF MATARAM.
Now comes Mataram?s turn! The day fixed for the attach, the 29th
September, was kept a profound secret.
In order to mislead the enemy as to the real point of attack, demon-
strations had been going on during the last two days towards the
North East.
A column composed of a battalion and a half of infantry and a section
of mountain artillery advanced on the 27th September towards Rembega,
under command of General Segov.
At first they took up their position at Pagarakan and directed their
fire against the kampong of Kemasan (see map) North of Mataram.
Then they advanced to a point between Rembega and Karang Barn and
took up a position facing east and again opened fire against Kemasan,
as well as against Mondjok, the North Eastern division of Mataram.
Although the firing created great confusion, which was expressed by
rapid movements and an incessant beating of the tom-tom, neither at
Mataram nor at Tjakra did the Balinese leave the lines, so our column
returned to the bivouac towards afternoon.
The same movements were repeated on the following day by the
same column under General Segov, the right wing was flanked by the
deep ravine at Karang Barn and the left wing was stationed at Rembega,
and from these points they again opened fire against Kemasan.
The inhabitants of Rembega having informed the General that the
Balinese had made a sally soon after our departure on the previous day,
the column remained in position for a very long time in the hope that
the enemy would make a fresh sally.
Once again there was considerable commotion at Mataram and the war
drums were furiously beaten at Tjakra; still nothing further seemed to come
of the intended sally. Our troops had started on their homeward march
and the rear-guard was covered by the cavalry, when the latter suddenly
perceived a division of Balinese, about 200 strong, rushing wildly amidst
oud yells and shrieks to attack the troops.
The cavalry reported this to General Segov, who immediately despatched
Staff-officer Willemstijn with instructions to the retiring troops at once
to return and take up the position they had just left.


As soon as this order was carried out, not too hurriedly, but quickly,
as if on aarade, and the mountain artillery had come into action, fire
was calmly opened once again on the Balinese.
Nothing daunted, the adversary advanced first in a compact body and
then in less serried lines to within 90 yards of our troops; this attempt
at resuming the offensive was doomed however to be both their first
and last. ? .
General Segov having given stringent orders that serious fighting was
to be avoided, the enemy was not pursued and the troops returned to
Ampenan.
What was it that led to this extraordinary advance on the part of
the Balinese and actually headed by the Crown-Prince too P :
The cause was a very mundane one, but one which oftener plays a
more leading part in warfare than people are generally apt to admit,
the stomach! . -
It appears that large kitchens had been established just outside Kemasan
-for victualling the garrison not belonging to Mataram; no small con-
sternation was felt therefore when our bombardment was directed against
this very vulnerable point on which the Balinese are so sensitive.
Late in the evening of the 28th, when the troops were confined to
camp and no further outside communications was possible, they were
made acquainted with the plan of attack against Mataram, which was
timed to take place before sunrise on the following morning. All the
necessary measures had been taken.
In the course of the day the Brins Hendrik, the Borneo and the Bali,
.which had been cruising along the coast, returned to the harbour of
Ampenan. During the night their naval brigade come ashore. These,
200 strong, together with 3 companies of barisans and half a section
of cavalry were to cover the basis of operation during the attack against
Mataram. The naval brigade of the and the
240 strong, were to relieve the garrison of the principal posts: 90 men
were told off for Arong-Arong, 100 for Kaleh and 50 for East Paga-
sangan.
Thus, for the struggle for Mataram, as many available troops as
possible were mustered, viz., three and a half battalions of infantry, a
section and a half of cavalry, two sections of field-artillery (the third was
still at Kaleh), two and a half sections of mountain artillery (one was
still at Pagasangan East), as well as three sections of engineers, train
and ambulance. They were to advance in three columns: the main or
attacking column, under Lt. Col. Trackers, consisting of the 6th and
half the 7th battalion (Major van Blornmestein) with artillery, train and
ambulance and a section of engineers, were.to march against the S. W.
part of Mataram. . :r
The right wing was to be covered by a column of 2 companies of
the 9th battalion, 1 section of field-artillery train, ambulance and
engineers, under Lt. Col. Scheuer, who is to take up position atPoenia
to hinder the Balinese from sending assistance from Tjakra and to
20


await additional orders from the Commander-in-chief before pushing
further forward. Colonel Swart with the 2nd battalion, artillery and
engineers was to march on the left flank from Arong-Arong and follow
the movements along the main road and effect an entry into Mataram
from that side.
Finally, a reserve of 2 companies (the 2nd half of 7th battalion)
remained temporarily with the artillery at Kaleh. With these were the
Commander-in-chief and his staff.
Attached to the artillery of the various columns were gunners furnished
with grenades.
The Second-in-Command as Commandant of the bivouac stayed behind
at Ampenan.
Firing and cannonading both from the ships and the forts had been
kept up uninterruptedly until two o?clock in the morning, from which
time all was silence; the enemy might take his rest in peace.
Before 4 a.m., while it was yet quite dark the troops assembled on the
high road from Ampenan and at a quarter past they marched to Arong-
Arong and Kaleh. From this point the main column, with Captain
Slangen?s company as advance-guard, followed the little footpath on the
right bank of the Antjar for nearly half an hour.
At about a couple of hundred yards distance from Mataram this
path had to be abandoned and they proceeded along the bed of the
river itself at this part not quite 5 metres wide, and about 1-|
metre deep. This offered no very great difficulties, there being only
a foot of water and in the deepest parts 20 inches. The river runs to
the S. W. angle of Mataram and thence along the Southern front,
formed by a wall, which was connected- with the earthworks we have
before referred to (from Arong-Arong to close to the S. Antjar).
As soon as the first company reached this wall, they were to try and
force an entrance and take up their position, while the other companies
were to spread out eastwards to the high road, which runs from South
to North through Mataram.
As soon as the South front as far as the main road was taken, an
advance was to be made in a northerly direction to the poeris at the
cross-roads and these were to be occupied.
The marshalling of such a vast force and the march in the dark
occupied more time than was expected and although such an early start
had been made, it was broad daylight when the main column, cautiously
moving along the bed of the S. Antjar reached the dangerous S. W.
corner of Mataram.
The view was greatly obstructed by the dense growth of bamboos.
Everything was as yet quiet. The hope was entertained of surprising the
enemy. Suddenly an Amboynese so dier of the advance guard fired a
shot ?he had seen or fancied he had seen a Balinese through the shrubs.
All chance of surprise was now at an end! In a moment the alarm had
sounded at Mataram and a minute later the enemy occupied the wall,
and fired point blank at our unprotected troops in the river.


While the vanguard responded to the fire, the next company under
Captain Schreijner hurried past. A breakwater to prevent the overflowing
of the Antjar was soon cleared away by the engineers, a few vollies
were fired and then forward ! Up against the wall went the section of
Sub-lieutenant H. Yalkenberg?himself at the head!
[he struggle was short but sharp. True, our men, preceded by the
young hero, succeeded in climbing the Avail with scaling ladders * and in
taking the enemy s position?but it was done at a heavy loss, Yalkenberg
was one of the first to pay for his courage with his life, Sub-lieutenant
Granpre Moliere was wounded, several soldiers and convicts fell too.
Now the town- was entered and the real difficulties began. The
complication of Avails and passages of which Mataram was composed
enforced very slow progress. Every wall had to be knocked down,
breached or climbed to penetrate to the next homestead, but from
behind every wall, from within every homestead, the enemy, who offered
stubborn resistance, had to be driven aAvay.
Still it was apparent, that misled by our demonstrations they were not
prepared for attack in this quarter, for in many of the dwellings there
Avere still women and children. Not to fall into our hands many ?kris?
themselves and others are put to death by the retreating .Balinese.
Everywhere Avere groups of men fighting and it was only by signals
that connection could be kept up amongst them.
At eight o?clock, even at nine o?clock the struggle was still going on in
this labyrinth. Although the men advanced as much under cover of the
walls as they possibly could, the number of our victims Avas steadily
increasing; and at this juncture Major van Blommestein had his foot
badly wounded.
With the help of portions of Swart?s column the left wing succeeded
in advancing, but only very sloAvly and the right wing could not get on
at all. They had reached as far as the homesteads lying on the main
road running from South to North, but it Avas impossible to extend to
the east or north. Every attack was repulsed by the Balinese, and the
main column was in a decidedly critical situation.
The Commander-in-chief perceived the danger; Lieutenant de Greve,
acting Staff-officer, Avas despatched to Lt.-col. Scheuer, carrying orders for
him to advance to rescue the right wing of Trackers column; but to
avoid, where possible, the main road occupied by the Balinese.
Lt.-col. Scheuer understood perfectly well that if he proceeded by
winding in and out through the tortuous walls, he Avould never be able
to reach the column in time and furthermore that he and his men would
very likely be caught in an equally dangerous position. He decided
therefore to folloAV the main road, j* ?But it is not free,? remarked
lieutenant de Greve.
* Made of bamboo a few days before; every company was provided with four of these ladders.
f It appears that in the interval Christan?s company had advanced through the side roads
further West of the main road.


?Where the 9th battalion marches, the road is free!? is the pithy
reply, an answer open to criticism, but which in this case did not
fail to excite a spirit of daring and which was a fine proof of the mutual
trust between officers and soldiers. They all knew they could rely
upon one another, t .
And this trust was soon going to be put to the test.
They started at once from the kampong of Poenia and marched in a
Northerly direction. Without heeding the hostile fire?Sub-lieutenant
Grootenboer was immediately wounded in the abdomen ?they crossed the
river Ant jar and a few walls and homesteads in order to reach the main
road. One more short passage and they will be there. Now onwards.
The enemy seeing themselves attacked on the left flank wheeled round
precipitately. Thus Commander Tracker?s right wing was relieved and
could advance.
As connectedly as they could the troops drew nearer to the cross roads.
But here the enemy had taken up a new position which they defended
with all the vigour of despair. It was now about 10 a. m.; Scheuer?s
column, always driving the hostile forces back, had nearly reached the
walled-in space of the S. W. poeri, the former dwelling of Gusti Njoman
Kaler.
A few Balinese retreated behind a narrow little gateway and were promptly
followed by the fusileers Terpstra, Baas and Nelk. Suddenly these three
men find themselves in the large enclosure of the poeri face to face
with hundreds of Balinese, amongst whom was very probably the Crown-
prince with his body guard.
The three men were greeted with a shower of bullets; Baas was wounded
in the head, Terpstra in the hands, but Nelk was uninjured. At the sounds
of this firing lieutenant Muller wanted to penetrate through the doorway
but his men drew him back. It was too reckless. Nelk was also called
back, and he returned to his comrades safe and sound.
It was necessary to force their way through from some other point.
Scheuer?s column tried to push further along the main road to arrive
at the cross roads, whence they intended to take the poeri by storm.
It was precisely at this point that the enemy had concentrated all their
forces. Both from the surrounding walls and from the trees the fire
on the column was so fierce, that it was utterly impossible to proceed. A
section of native soldiers was now ordered to sacrifice themselves for
the general benefit. They .were to advance to the point where the four
roads meet and where they would naturally attract the enemy?s fire thus
giving the main body an opportunity of advancing to invade the poeri.
The natives advanced hurriedly to reach the appointed spot, but were
checked by the terrific fire. The same order was given to a second
section, but neither could they advance and many sought shelter behind
the waringin trees on the road.
Commander Scheuer asked, ordered reinforcements to advance but,
where were they to come from? Just at that moment Lieutenant Broekman
was hurried forward to help with his section of Europeans.


lo remember where he came from, we must go back a little.
The ambulance under command of Surgeon J. W. Portengen had
advanced on the main road as far as the third side street from the cross-
roads, say, about 280 yards from the poeri. On the west side of this
street runs a clear little stream, and running parallel with the water was
a dee j trench. This was an invaluable discovery: the wounded could be
laid c own, close to the clear-running water where it was thought they
would be well screened from the enemy?s fire by the walls.
1 herefore the wounded were carried here, including those of the
main column. Lieutenant Brockman was appointed by the commander
of his company, Captain Janssen, to cover the ambulance with his
section.
}
He heard the call of Colonel Scheuer. Broekman had failed to receive
the ? Order of William ? notwithstanding his exemplary conduct at
Atcheen. Was not this an opportunity to win it?
Just at this moment the ambulance did not require his protection,
so forward he went.
$
He succeeded in reaching the cross-roads with his section and in hold-
ing the position for a little while but this preliminary triumph was
dearly bought! He was shot in the back from a tree N. W. of the
poeri, and his lower limbs were immediately paralyzed.
Although he suffered most excruciating pains, no murmur was ever
heard to pass his lips and his mind remained clear to the end. His
comrades spoke words of comfort to him and the Commander-in-chief
visited him, announcing to him the news that he was to be decorated
with the ? Order of William ? for his bravery. .
Poor fellow he died just one month after the capture of Mataram.
It was a touching sight to see the affection with which the native soldiers
of his company adorned 1 his bier! And' touching too were the words
spoken by the minister over his open grave.
He did not survive to see the accomplishment of his heart?s dearest
wish, but his name is inscribed now as ? knight ? in the registers of
the Chancellor?s office of the Order.
The position of Brockman?s section was becoming more and more
perilous; in addition to their commander many others had fallen: and
it was evident that the remainder would not be able to stand their ground
much longer.
Yet it is imperative to maintain the position. Who was to advance
now? There was some slight hesitation. Colonel Scheuer determined
to go himself: he knew all would follow his lead.
Luckily however this resolution needed not to be carried out! Captain
Janssen seeing that it was a question of prompt action, placed himself
at the head and was quickly joined by a few good shots: some
Balinese soldiers standing behind one of the low walls were shot down,
after which an attack was made, and the enemy were obliged to
withdraw.
Grenades are thrown over the high walls into the large enclosure and


once again an advance was made towards the narrow gateway; Captain
Janssen at the head of his company. They effected an entry at the point
of the bayonet into the enclosure, whence the enemy were forced to beat
a retreat. Meanwhile the main column had also penetrated into the open
square. *
Before proceeding we must see what happened to the ambulance after
Brockman?s departure. Besides this officer himself many other seriously
wounded soldiers were brought in. Just as two men of the 7th battalion,
Corporal Zijlstra and Fusilier Singel, were carrying in Lieutenant Grooten-
boer a heavy volley was directed straight against them from behind a low
wall just at the end of the trench where the ambulance was stationed.
The doctor immediately put rifles and cartridges in the hands of
Zijlstra, and Singel and Fusilier Van Wijk of 7th battalion whom he had
just bandaged, and ordered them to reply to the fire while the wounded
were all told to bend low or were stretched flat on the ground.
While the doctor proceeded with his task of bandaging, a European
soldier lying on the ground behind him received a bullet through the
head, which bullet was certainly meant for the doctor. The three
soldiers managed to keep the enemy at bay by greeting them with bul-
lets every time their heads appeared above the walls and this was kept
up until Capt. Utzman of the 6th battalion, who was advancing with
the main body, came to the rescue and drove the Balinese soldiers
away.
At last the doctor was able to comply with the order of Colonel Scheuer
and transport the wounded one by one along the East side of the main
road to the poeri, to the prince?s residence on the N.W. side, where
the ambulance was established in a large shed.
We will now return to the main column.
At the same time that Janssen?s company had pushed through the
front entrance of the poeri Captain Creutz Lechleitner and his company
reached the back entrance, where they fell in with a band of thirty
men armed with spears and krisses. A short close fight ensued; Sub-
lieutenant Van Teyn cleft the head of a Balinese right through the
middle, and one by one those remaining succumbed. Any further resist-
ance would be futile. The Dewas have so ordained it.
Amid loud rejoicings all the other detachments made their way into
the poeri; the position at the cross-roads was given up by the Balinese;
those who did not escape were shot down and the ground was covered
with their dead bodies.
The spirit of the enemy was broken. They might have continued to
defend themselves from the three other poeris, which formed equally
strong positions, but their courage was exhausted.
* It is possible that in our account of the attack on Mataram some inaccuracies may have
crept in, as we have had no official reports to draw from. The accounts we have received
have frequently been at variance with one another. This is however not to be wondered at
when we hear of the same thing occurring at headquarters; for which reason the Commander-
in-chief has ordered that in future all accounts of fighting be brought in on the evening of
the encounter.


A couple of shells from the mountain artillery sufficed to drive away
the few remaining Balinese and the troops were delighted to recapture
one of the field pieces they had lost on the 26th August, along with
the limber, a couple of wall pieces and a forge which were carried in
triumph to the poeri.
The 2nd battalion, which had been following the movements of the
left flank of the main column, had in the interval also reached the
cross-roads.
The reserve had also advanced to this point, and the troops were
assembled on the high road for a moment?s repose after the struggle.
The Commander-in-chief appeared on the scene; a deafening cheer
went up from every throat; he was greeted with indescribable enthu-
siasm as he mounted the steps of the palace of the Balinese princes.
What thoughts must have passed through the mind of this man,
bearing the weight of such a heavy responsibility?
In his mind?s eye he could picture to himself those weary troops,
who, barely a month ago narrowly escaping destruction, had been pur-
sued and disgraced and had their moral so grievously shaken; and now?
Not only was that army vastly increased in numbers, but it had
gained inward strength and had once more confidence in itself.
The enemy, defiant and arrogant, had hoped to drive us back to sea,
but instead of that had been himself repulsed in every direction by the
superiority of our forces.
Beside the triumphant names of Pagasangan and Pasinggahan we may
now write the not less celebrated name of Mataram.
With pride and satisfaction indeed may the leader of the army stand
at the head of his valiant men, in the very centre of the former seat
of Balinese power.
For the first time during all this critical business a smile flits across
the otherwise serious face of the Commander-in-chief as he nodded to
officers and men. He thanked them for the courage they had displayed
and baring his head led them in giving three cheers, which were
vociferously joined in by the troops.
It was a solemn moment. It was as it were a cementing tighter and
closer of the bonds that united them. The past has been obliterated and
now each one can look back with honour to these days of victory, and
face the future with renewed hope.
Still bad times were yet in store for us.
It was deemed inadvisable to pursue the enemy further that day in
the midst of the labyrinth of walls. A strong post had to be built
at Mataram, which was at once begun in the open space of the S.W.
poeri. For the safety and protection of the fort which was to be
called Mataram-poeri, all the surrounding territory had first of all to
be cleared.
A portion of the troops protected the workers, and the others along
with the convicts are set to clearing under the lead of the engineers

These residences were sumptuously furnished, magnificent specimens
of European comforts and luxury were profusely strewn about. A
number of precious stones, gold, costly weapons, objects of Balinese art,
various things which they had secured as .booty in their attack against
us, were brought to light. Time for examination was not allowed. )


Shortly after everything was devoured by the flames. *
In the midst of this horrible scene of devastation, the Sassaks again
clustered round in hundreds, to search the houses for plunder. �
Loaded with booty, whole tribes of them returned to their kampongs,
while some few remained to assist in the work of demolition.
Ihe hie spread further and further and notwithstanding a heavy
showei of ram continued to burn fiercely right through the night. In
the interval the fort had been put into as an effectual state of
defence as was possible. A small work to secure the communications
was also constructed between Arong-Arong and Mataram. At 6 p. m.

where they were received with tremendous enthusiasm.
I wo campanies of the 6th battalion, as well as two field pieces and
one mountain gun were left at Mataram-poeri and one section in the
small work on the West side.
The men of the naval brigade returned from the posts they had
occupied to Ampenan.
The casualties during the day were killed : 1 officer, (Sub-lieutenant
H. Valkenbmg of the infantry) 13 soldiers and 3 convicts; the wounded
included 4 officers (all of the infantry) and 58 soldiers. Total 79.
Ihese serious losses show how heavy the fighting was.
Ihe enemy s losses were far more numerous, although the number of
wounded who made good their escape to Tjakra is unknown. It was
however possible to form an opinion, judging from the number of dead
bodies which were found everywhere, both on the ground and in the
dwellings. Ihe number was computed at 300, amongst whom were
women and children, some of whom had unfortunately fallen victims to
our bullets, but many had received death at the hands of their own
people. From reports received the Crown-prince was also dead; he had
::allen with his men while defending the poeri.
Some of his faithful followers had carried the corpse to Tjakra;

son, but was persuaded not [to do so. The body was too shockingly

question of complete destruction. The small low walls had scarcely
suffered at all.
The greater part of the houses had not only remained in habitable
condition, but were actually inhabited not only by men, but even by
women and children.
Experience once again taught us that too much reliance should not
be placed on the results of a bombardment of large places built with
solid stone walls.
The capture of Mataram could not fail to fill the Balinese with con-
sternation, and the alarm at Tjakra was almost universal. Many would
have surrendered at this juncture of affairs, others tried to escape, and
large numbers sought protection amongst the Sassaks, promising to
accept Islam ism.

OCCURRENCES PRECEDING THE ATTACK OF TJAKRA NAGARA.
It was once more Saturday night?29th?Both Sept.?but what a
different Saturday to that of five weeks ago. This time the sleep of
the troops remained undisturbed.
The following morning, 80th Sept, the Second-in-command advanced
with a column, composed of companies of Infantry, 1 section of
mountain aitillery, 2 sections of engineers and all the available convicts
to proceed with the work of demolition. What a frightful undertaking
is the destruction of a town. The walls must be knocked down, homes
laid waste, trees felled, so that Mata-
ram as a town, may cease to exist.
Day after day, week after week, the
work of extinction will be continued
without interruption, until it is accom-
plished.
But, we will not anticipate events.
The whole of the BOth September the
labours were carried on under suitable
cover. The fort at Mataram-poeri was
reinforced, the surrounding ground was
cleared.
Nothing more was seen of the enemy.
The booty-seeking Sassaks scattered
themselves over the entire East part

of Mataram and it was not long before
they discovered and brought back to us with great rejoicing the second
of our lost field-guns. Capt. Willemstijn, of the staff who was present
with Segov?s column made a reconnoissance on the other side of the
R. Antjar?in their precipitate flight the Balinese had omitted to destroy
the bridge which crossed the river at this point?and Avas able to see
distinctly the earthworks, by means of which the Balinese had shut off
all communication with Mataram from the East side.


The Sassaks were also busily engaged searching about in the N.W.
direction, and it was quite certain this part must be deserted too, for
the wary Sassaks would never have ventured where they were likely to
meet their foes.
It was thought that all the Balinese must have retreated from Mataram.
Already ?it was 4 p.m. ?preparations were made for the return to
Ampenan. Two Sassaks, one provided with a Netherlands flag, the
other with a white one, begged for an interview with the Commander.
Admitted to General Segov they inform him ?that they have come as
representatives of their kampongs in N.W. Mataram to make their
submission and further, that about 50 paces from the N.W. Poeri there
was a store of Balinese weapons and ammunition. The General can go
there quite safely, there was no danger whatever and they will show him
the way. Should he find anything wrong, he will be able to shoot
his informants.? Of course the General did not go on this errand
himself, but despatched a section of Infantry belonging to the 2nd
battalion, under Lieutenant van Appen.
Captain Erpecum, acting aide-de-camp to the General went with them
as a matter of curiosity and for the same reason they were joined by
Captain van Griethuijsen, commander of van Oppen?s company.
Guided by the Sassaks, they turned into a narrow street W. of the poeri
and running Northwards. One hundred and fifty paces further, they
had to enter a side-street, only about two yards wide, which the guides-
said, lead to the powder-magazine They follow it for a bit ?This is
going too far?, says van Erpecum. Yes, the guides begin to think they
have taken the wrong turning. One of them is lifted up to look over the
wall; the house was empty, ?this was the wrong place. So they turned
back until they reached a continuation of the street where they were first of
all, and keep more Northwards. There on the left-hand side was a narrow
little doorway, yes, that was the door leading to the magazine.
They entered but barely had part of the troops passed through,
when they were surprised by the most overwhelming fire from all sides.
?Back!? shouted van Erpecum; all made for that narrow little
doorway ?but only one man could go through at a time. It was a
hopeless struggle to get out ?the enemy fired straight into the very
midst of that mass of humanity.
And outside? Erom behind the wall on the other side of that narrow
street the Balinese speared or shot at point blank range, those of the
unfortunate men who have not got inside.
Captain Erpecum succeeded in retreating to a short distance with a
good many of the wounded, ?-among whom was Captain van Griethuijsen?
but had to leave behind those who were killed; they reached another
narrow passage and there van Erpecum tried to put his men under
cover. Just as he went round a corner to see what the exact situation
was, he was fired upon and fell, and it was in vain that they tried to
help him; Lieutenant van Appen was also shot through the chest and
he too fell a victim in this unequal struggle.


, The General heard the firing and immediately sent a couple of
sections of infantry to the rescue; but in this maze of walls it was not
so easy to find their comrades; everything in the poeri was in a state
of alarm; a cavalry soldier came hastening up for ?tandoes? for the
wounded, some of them were already being carried back, The first
was Captain van Griethuijsen, then came Lieutenant van Oppen. The
surgeon and the recorder Yalette try to bandage their wounds whilst
bullets were whizzing around them but it was too late to save van Oppen,
he succumbed to his injuries. A short time after a couple of convicts,
who had voluntereed to undertake the dangerous task, went and fetched
the dead body of van Erpecum; a bullet through the heart had caused
instantaneous death.
. And thus the very day after the victory two smart, efficient young
officers lost their lives.
If an officer?like Valkenburg and Broekman the previous day ?
fall in the heat of the fight, at the head of his men, whilst stimulating
and encouraging them in their duty, it is no doubt hard, very hard
for those they have left to mourn them. But in that case the mourners,
be they child, brother, husband or friend, have the solace of knowing
that the lost one laid down his life on the altar of the fatherland and
that the sacrifice thus offered has had glorious results! Not so under
such circumstances as we have described.
Towards dusk the enemy was driven away and all was quiet at
Matarara.
The troops returned with the wounded, of which besides Captain
Griethuijsen there were about nineteen soldiers. There were also nine
soldiers missing. What fate had befallen them?
Deeply and sadly impressed by these occurrences the men made the
return march to Ampenan in complete silence. By the time they passed
Arong-Arong it was quite dark.
Suddenly a shot was fired from the kampong of Sinagong on the North
of the high road. Fortunately nothing more was heard and it was indeed
a blessing that the enemy did not further harass the column that night;
how easy it would have been to create confusion in the darkness in that
long line, which included so many hundred convicts.
Thus it happens during every war that there are moments of weakness
even for the victorious side, if only the enemy knew of them and made
the most of them.
Without however any further disturbance the troops reached head-
quarters, but it was a very wretched night for everybody.
The following day two events of very opposite natures took place;
one was a work of vengeance.
One of the Sassak guides, who had led our brave men into the pitfall,
had been shot at the beginning of the fray, but the other had been
taken prisoner and conveyed to Ampenan. At first he denied having
had any share in the betrayal but a few applications of the cane
soon brought him to the speedy acknowledgment that he had acted in

obedience to the commands of his master, Gusti Gredak; he had been
ordered to try and induce the General and as many Dutchmen as he
could to fall into the snare. First of all he had refused to obey, then
the Balinese took a spear and stuck it through his foot ?and really the
marks were there?and threatened him with death if he persisted in his
refusal.
This confession sealed his fate.
The next morning he was hanged just outside Ampenan and his fate
was shared by a Balinese spy, who had been caught the day before.
Were these guides really guilty? We tell the tale that was extracted
by the cane for what it was worth; but decidedly appearances were
against them.
But then on the other hand the question arises, what could have
prompted the Sassaks to such an act? Fear of the Balinese?
They knew perfectly that they were sure of our protection, whilst if
they misled us, they were certain of punishment, if not immediate death.
The Mataram Poeri. Scale 1:2250.
And surely it was not affection for the Balinese that could have inspired
them; besides was not the powder-magazine found a few days later in
the neighbourhood where the disaster had occurred?
Whatever may have been the true state of things, there was not time
for enquiry on the battle-field and the knot had to be cut in the simplest
and quickest possible manner.
Furthermore it was expedient to give some sort of satisfaction to the
deeply-embittered soldiers. And the other victims?
Rows upon rows of men were standing around a newly-dug grave while


the bodies of their comrades were laid to rest; their grief was mingled
with resentment, when they thought of the treachery that had taken from
their midst those brave fellows, who escaped death on the open field.
The chief of the staff spoke of the loss sustained by the army, the
comrades and the relatives of the deceased; the priest, Father Vogel,
said a few timely words to those gathered together at the grave side
and when he said that many of us are nearer the gates of eternity
? than we may suspect,? everybody felt the terrible truth of this remark
and the Commander-in-chief, deeply touched, took the hand of this
faithful minister, who had done his duty on so many sad occasions.
The work of demolition progressed daily at Mataram.
Fvery morning early the troops with all the available convicts marched
there and only returned at nightfall.
Slowly but surely the ground around Mataram-poeri was being cleared
and levelled and was becoming wider in area; the covering party was
always at the prescribed distance in front, and everything is done with
the utmost caution and not a step was taken before making perfectly
sure of the safety of the situation. ?
In the beginning, whilst the demolition was being proceeded with in
South and West Mataram, bands of Balinese had shown themselves in
Noith and East Mataram, so it was decided to re-inforce our post at
Mataram-poeri, on the 2nd October, by an additional 20 c.m, cannon.
work was terminated in the S. W., it was begun in the N. W.
On the sth October the soldiers that were missing after the catastrophe
of the 80th Sept, were found all heaped up together; these were sergeant
Van Till and eight fusiliers. The enemy had taken their rifles, ammu-
nition and clothes, but had not mutilitated the bodies.
Quite close to the spot where they were found, the workers really
discovered the magazine of which the Sassaks had spoken; it contained
216 barrels and 18 kegs of gunpowder, 4 cases of cartridges for breech-
loaders and repeaters, and implements for filling cartridges.
It is a mystery why all this material was left behind, for the enemy
had not quitted this part of Mataram in such great haste.
About a yard from this point was found one of our shells, which
had not burst.
The systematic way in which the demolition was carried on brought to light
many other important finds, principally in the way of arms and ammunition.
Naturally the Sassaks possessed themselves of the lion?s share of the
treasures, such as furniture, clothes, valuables and cases filled with
Kepengs. Here and there great stores of rice were dug up.
Their generous offer to dig up the treasures buried behind the poeri
at Mataram, was however rejected; they were told that the troops could
not spare time for that at present, for it was not considered necessary
to see all the treasures disappear into the hands of the Sassaks. *
As, in the beginning at least, the Sassaks had been of very little help
* We have not heard whether any later researches have been made there...


in the work of demolition, and as there were too few hands available
for the gigantic undertaking, the Commander-in-chief had requisitioned
the services of 500 free coolies, who reached Lombock on the 2nd
October. They were sent from Madura and were placed under the
orders of a distinguished Madurese.
The transport was now 2900 men strong and was also increased by
220 horses and the necessary transport material. The various tactical
units absorbed some 1200 convicts for regimental transport: the remain-
ing 1700 men with the horses and staff were at the disposal of the
engineers.
On the whole the conduct of the free coolies left a good deal to be
wished for; but we cannot withhold a word of praise from those men
who had been convicted and sentenced: this expedition owes them a
tremendous debt of gratitude. Great services were rendered by
this mass of long-suffering and willing humanity. They it was who
transported all the artillery material, and all the requisites for the
medical department and the commissariat, etc. How hard they toiled
in the bivouac and in the numerous engineering operations; how
bravely they passed through the enemy?s line to seek information; how
uncomplainingly they went forth to scout and spy, how readily they carried
extra ammunition; how courageously they faced the fire to reach a
wounded soldier and carry him under cover.
On the 6th of October the whole of West-Mataram was razed to the
ground, and after a well-earned rest on the 7th, the work could be
begun in the Eastern portion.
A group of old men, women and children, who had been left behind
in their dwellings were conveyed to Arapenan. It was soon noticed
that some amongst them were suffering from small-pox; they were at
once isolated and eventually sent to Labouan Tring.
From information received, it became known that the disease was
raging on the East coast. A Doctor Djawa from Boeleleng and a vac-
cinator were immediately sent to the district, to prevent as much as
possible the spreading of the malady, whilst Doctor Yorderman, inspector
of the civil medical department in Java, came to Ampenan from Batavia
to take further precautionary measures. '
As it appeared that various cases of sickness had occurred at Mataram
and Tjakra, great fears were entertained lest the infection should reach the
camps, so a special medical officer was instructed to re-vaccinate the troops.
Concerning the general condition of the men?s healths, at the beginning
of October it had been declared excellent, but very shortly afterwards,
on the Bth, the sick list was found to be a long one; in fact it amounted
to 6 per cent of the troops.
By the 10th October Mataram was in such a position as to run no
risk of being re-occupied by the enemy. Still it was quite another
month before it could be said that the enemy was completely driven
from the neighbourhood, and before an attack on Tjakra Nagara could
be thought of.
O


Let us see how this month was spent.
Ihe attitude of the Balinese at Tjakra Nagara was entirely a defensive
one. Aftei the fall of Mataram many had no doubt escaped in a
INoitherly and INoith Lasterly direction, where they were safe from
the fire of our ships and our columns; but, either by force or by
pi onuses the piince was able to prevent the greater portion of the
people from leaving his capital.
m .9 n night of 4th sth October there was loud musketry firing in
Ijakra. Ihe following morning several Netherlands flags were seen
living fiom different points and a white one was flyin�? from the
Western maingate. What was happening? was there dissension between the
followers of the prince, determined at all costs to defend their last strong-
hold and the party who was willing to surrender? And had the latter
got the upper hand at these different points P or was this flying of our flags
simply a stratagem of war and were they trying to entice us into a trap ?
As no further steps were taken to betoken submission, the latter
conjecture was considered the correct one and the work of bombarding
Ijakra from Mataram and Pagasangan East was proceeded with
Had all or perhaps part of the Balinese really nitended to surrender ?
It is not surprising after all that had taken place that the Commander-
m-chief should be very suspicious of any advances they might make' Prom the
reports of the spies we learned that there was a split in the enemy?s camp ?
and surely our mode of answering those who wished for peace can
haidly be called conciliatory. It would have been easy to ascertain the
real facts of the matter; a portion of the troops might have established
themselves on the enceinte and thence have judged to what extent
our presence was likely to prove valuable or not to those who wished
to sever their connection with the prince. Hitherto there was a gener-
ally prevailing opinion amongst the Balinese that we would shoot
every man who came over to us.
In reply to the roundabout enquiries that were made by the Balinese
the Commander-in-chief intimated that all those who surrendered and
who were found to be neither instigators nor ringleaders, should be
paicloned under certain conditions (such as the giving up of their arms
. ?.. | .j D
a certain appointed place), and
their lives should be spared. At a later date, after being empowered
to do so by the government, a promulgation was issued, saying that the
i\ 6s should bo spaied of all those who surrendered either singly or in a body
On the 10th October the poenggawa Ida Bagoes Saray of Tjamara
(Morth Mataram) gave up his arms and with 59 fighting men, 26 women
and 21 children surrendered to the Commander-in-chief and they were
immediately escorted to Labuan Thing; after that but few surrendered.
The prince still maintained too much authority and there could be no
question of treating with him. Dead or alive he must fall into our
hands, nothing less could efface the outrage to our army and our honour
could not otherwise be redeemed, nor could the future government of
Lombock be established on a sure basis.

From every point of view, the position was now such that there
remained no alternative but to seize the capital by force of arms.
The most desirable plan would have been to surround Tjakra either
from Kambega on the North or Soekadana on the South, but this was
not practicable with the forces available. There was nothing to be done
excepting to make the attack straight in front while threatening the flanks.
Preparatory to the siege it was essential to strengthen the artillery
in the front, besides guarding against possible attack on the north side.
The south side of Tjakra could be enfiladed from Pagasangan East.
The demolition at East Mataram was so ? far advanced that batteries
could be erected, while the necessary guns could be brought from the
posts at Arong-Arong and Mataram poeri, which were less favourably
situated for carry-
ing out the pro-
posed project.

This was reckoning without our host, who in this case was represented
by the watery element.
In consequence of the heavy rainfall in the mountains all the small
rivers were very much swollen.
The rivier Djangkok had risen considerably and swept away in its

OCCURRENCES PRECEDING THE ATTACK OF NAGAR A.

Here too they had had a bad time of it. In times of inundation the
little rivers running both north and south are unable to empty
themselves into the sea, so they streamed into Ampenan, and the
people were knee-deep in water. The lower parts of the town had been
evacuated with the least possible delay and shelter sought in the higher
lying parts.
Measures had to be taken at once to restore communication and to
prevent the recurrence of such an accident, the knowledge of which
might have been very much to the
advantage of the Balinese, had they but
known of it.
The first thing that was done to re-
open communication was to fetch one
of the lighters belonging to the Royal
Steam-packet Company, take it to pieces
and carry it to the river, the two
pirogues were used as ferries, whilst a
temporary wooden bridge was built by
the engineers with the help of the
marines, which would serve until an
iron one could be made.
To facilitate the quicker discharge
of the river Djangkok into the sea, a
canal was cut from the point of the
river where it curves to the south,
straight into the sea.
Battery Karang-Bedil. Scale: 1 to 2250.
lii order to secure a higher and healthier position for the troops and
provide that in case of a renewal of this contingency there should be an
abundant supply of forces on the opposite side of the river, it was
decided to construct a fortified encampment for two battalions of infantry,
artillery, cavalry and engineers at Kapitan.
Besides this a dam was constructed to lead the waters of the Som-
brok ?a river north of Ampenan ?in a more northerly direction to the
Meninting, to prevent the flooding of the camp on the north side.
Many repairs were needed; gales of wind and rain, both in the
quarters at Ampenan and at the outposts and also on the roads, had
worked considerable damage everywhere. The new Decauville-line
from Ampenan to Pagasangan East by Kaleh, was so deeply imbedded
in mud, that preference was given to the old main road: Arong-Arong-
Mataram-Pagasangan East, which was now free.
It is almost, unnecessary to say that under the circumstances the dis-
embarking and transport of supplies was a matter of great difficulty and
took a great deal of time, especially the transport of artillery material
and ammunition.
Although every effort was used to push on the building of the pier, still
little progress was made. The shore could no longer be reached by
the rafts; and the cases of ammunition had to be opened on the raft

am! the projectiles were carried on shore one by one through the surf.
\\hen it became impossible to lower the cases on to the rafts, every-
uug iac o e 3iought by pinnaces. Some of the lighter cases could be
placed ill them as they were, but the larger ones had to be opened and
all the projectiles and cartridges had to be placed in the pinnaces
separately and carried on shore, the sailors being up to their waists in water.
i 11 Ca {? mi ? ht c( j l . nc W^en , even mode of disembarkation would
be impossible, when all communication would be broken with the harbour.
Meanwhile the two 12 c.m. guns
had been placed in battery at Karang
Bedil on the 19th October.
To accelerate communication between
this post and the main road running
North and South, a solid bridge was
built across the river Antjar and for its
protection a blockhouse was erected
in the high road near the bridge.
The following day they were able
to beg in a new battery at Padjang
on the east side of Mataram and north
of Karang-Bedil.
The enemy tried to impede the
labour here by heavy firing from
Battery at Padjang. Scale : 1 to 2250.
Mondjok (N. E. of Mataram) which they still occupied, but they were
repulsed with slight loss in killed and wounded.
ihe new post at Padjang was so far advanced at night that the
company left behind had no reason to fear an attack.
lluee days later it was strengthened by two 12 c.m. guns and a
-0 c.m. mortar, on the fourth by two more similar mortars, while the
artillery staff was composed of two superior officers, 3 corporals and
28 cannoneers.
On the 28th October Karang-Bedil was strengthened by one 12 c.m.
gun and the artillery garrison was brought up to 2 officers, 2 N.C.'
officers, 2 corporals and 15 cannoneers.
With this complement the batteries against Tjakra were ready for action.
As the work of building the new posts had proceeded, some of the
earlier ones had lost their importance, so that they could either be quite
abandoned or the garrison very much decreased. Kaleh was reduced to
company and so was Mataram-poeri and these troops were left there
only to keep open the line of communication; but the post of obser-
vation at the W. entrance to Mataram as well as the S. W. fort at
Arong-Arong were dismantled.
During all these preparations the enemy had continued mostly inactive.
Only on the 27th Oct. had the enemy fired on the troops whilst they
were opening up the ground near Padjang on the North bank of the
Antjar; a clearance had been necessary at this point to get a clear
view of Taman Radja and Bangkal Tjoelik.


The three batteries facing Tjakra: Pagasangan East, Karang-Eedil and
Padjang had kept up a continuous fire against the capital since the
23rd, with the result that on 80th Oct. a powder magazine exploded at
Tjakra. The shock was felt at a considerable distance; pieces of wood
and stone were flung as far as Mataram where the troops were working.
All during this month every effort was put forth for the improvement
of the dwellings and the lines of communication, the need of which
was felt more and more.
-
On the 19th of October there was another very heavy rainfall at
Ampenan and the river Djangkok again overflowed.
The work of building the new encampment could only be proceeded
with very slowly; the spot chosen was on the North of the road to
Mataram and as it was thickly wooded and there were very large trees
to be felled, the time spent even in preparing the ground was considerable.
?Although there were thousands of hands employed,? writes the cor-
respondent of the BataviaaschNieuivsblad to his paper on 4th Nov., ?it
took a Avhole fortnight to raise a breastwork 4ft high, to build four
very primitive small forts, to cut down the trees and put up a wire
entanglement round the bivouac.
?In view of the very slow progress and seeing that at this rate it
would take another three weeks to complete the work, it has been decided to
resort to more decisive tacties so, late at night, the order was sud-
denly given to the 6th battalion to be ready to start at daybreak the following
morning, for the new encampment at Kapitan. Certainly the idea was
not inviting, but the officers clearly understood that it was the best
thing to be done. The officers and soldiers, helped by the convicts,
the Madurese and Sassak coolies, and instructed by the engineers, all
set to work cheerfully to do the best they could to forward the work,
but towards midday a torrent of rain fell, drenching the men and every-
thing they had brought with them. This however was not allowed
to interfere with their labours and towards evening all were under
cover.
? The rain is incessant. The bivouac is nothing but a pool
of mud; everything is wet, nobody possesses a dry stitch of clothing
for the sun is hidden.? Two companies of the 7th battalion were sent
to Kapitan the following day and managed to run up a sort of make-
shift shelter, but there could be no question of continuing the work
seriously. .
?To begin with, the Sassaks coolies have simply remained away during
the last couple of days; they object to working in the rain. Secondly
the Sassaks are bringing in no more materials, and the numerous bar-
racks for infantry, artillery, cavalry, ammunition, victuals and convicts
which figure so prominently on the ?plan for the bivouac,? cannot be
made to assume tangible shape without materials, but if only we had
materials we should get on famously.
?It seems such a pity that all the ground should have been so much
dug up. It is nothing but mud, mud, mud!


?lo the honour of our soldiers be it said that under these most
unsatisfactory circumstances, all continue to work diligently and cheer-
fully as long as their health permits. They understand as well as the
officers that fate is responsible for this distressing state of affairs and
they try to make the best of things.
.... Slow progress is being made with the iron bridge across the
Djangkok. ..
dhe landing of all the heavy materials was attended by many
difficulties; competent workmen were scarce; the stony nature of the
soil obstructed the driving in of the iron pillars. A new approach had
to be made, for the bridge was about 165 yards east of the old
bamboo one. . . .?
On the sth November General Vetter sent the following communi-
cation to Batavia.
t
are being severely felt; for the last four
days we have had an uninterrupted downpour of heavy rain, which is
doing serious damage to the roads. The temporary bridge over the
Soungei Djangkok is impassable, so that all communication has to be
carried on by means of the bridge of boats? ?Communication with the
harbour is repeatedly interrupted, and on the 3rd it remained so all
day owing to the heavy rainstorm from the S. West, which caused the
a to swell tremendously.?
Ihe situation was assuming a very alarming aspect: communication
with the harbour was growing more and more difficult, for one entire
day it was cut off entirely, the roads were like swamps, the rivers were
all swollen, part of the country was completely under water.
What results could be expected from an attack against Tjakra under
such conditions?
What resistance did we not encounter at Mataram? And even yet the
enemy could not be said to be quite driven away from there. What
would be the result if we besieged Tjakra, so much more extensive,
feeling too that the enemy would fight this time with the energy born
of despair?
Would it be possible to march through these swampy rice fields
and to wade through these unfordable rivers? Would the artillery ever
be able to keep up with the other troops?
On the other hand, how would a - delay affect the health of the
men? Was not Lombock during the West monsoon known to be
unhealthy ? . '
And now, with all these rains and storms and insufficient protection
from the inclemency of the weather and the marshy ground, was there
not every reason to dread all sorts of illness?
The sick list had already reached the enormous proportions of 8f
per cent, and for Europeans even 11| per cent!
Surely under these circumstances it is not to be wondered at that
the Commander-in-chief thought of the future with gloomy forebodings.
And, there were other dark clouds perceptible on the horizon.


We will now say a few words concerning affairs not taking place on
the actual battle-field.
The day after the capture of Mataram, the men landed from the
Frins Hendrik and the Borneo had returned to their ships, those of the
Bali had gone on board the Koningin Emma.
The Borneo began cruising the North coast again; the Frins Hendrik
remained in the harbour at Ampenan, on account of the less favorable
health conditions of the men; and in her stead the Tromp took up the
station in Kombal bay.
On the 4th October the Bali threw fifty shells into the big kampong
of Pemenang on the N.W. coast, a place where the Balinese had stored
away large provisions of rice. The kampong was soon a mass of flames
and four rice magazines were destroyed, the natives fled further inland
and the Sassaks continued the work of demolition and plunder. Large
quantities of arms and ammunition were discovered by the Sassaks, from
whom a great part were obtained later through the intermediary of the
commander of the Bali, assisted by the Bugis chief, Abdullah Bouta,
who exercised great influence on the North coast; 11 guns, some
muzzle-loading and repeating rifles, besides 40 barrels of powder, pro-
jectiles, etc., were later on conveyed to Ampenan.
As soon as the health of the men on board the Frins Hendrik had
improved, they started from Ampenan to cruise the North coast;
however five days later, 24th October, they were compelled to return
to Ampenan owing to the illness of the commander and eventually the
ship went to Macassar for coal.
The Borneo which during the early part of the month had been
assisting in the preliminary bombardment of Tjakra Nagara left the
North coast to cruise about in the strait of Lombock and search all
vessels going to and fro between the islands of Lombock and Bali;
various reports from the spies in the beginning of November went to
prove that the Balinese government were trying and apparently with
every chance of success, to enter into friendly negotiations with the
chiefs of Praja. The extraordinary attitude assumed towards us from
the very beginning by Goeroe Bangkol and maintained in spite of our
appeals seemed to confirm the correctness of the rumours, rendering it
imperative to keep a sharp look out over Praja; and other indications
were not wanting to strengthen our suspicions.
Gusti Njoman Dangin, a Balinese chief residing at Tjakra, who had
notified his intention hitherto not carried out, to submit to us,
warned the Commander-in-chief by letter that Goeroe Bangkol was only
waiting for a favorable opportunity to betray the Netherlands govern-
ment and intended to stand by the Balinese princes, having in fact
already despatched envoys to treat with them. Things had come to a
pretty pass, if our troops might be betrayed at any moment by the
principal Sassak chiefs! Strict watch over events on the opposite coast
and everything that came from there was therefore obligatory and the
precaution taken was not in vain. On two different occasions the Borneo


jj
overtook a native vessel carrying letters on palm leaves from Karang-
assim, one being from Gusti G?de Djilantik to the Balinese prince
Datoe Pangeran. The letter from our friend was full of sympathetic
enquiries after the Sassaks and their present frame of mind; he explained
that he himself had only returned to Bali to satisfy his followers,
unwilling to leave him alone at Lombock, but that he was quite ready
to return alone if by doing so he should be of any use to Datoe
Pangeran. What was the meaning of this? Did it not look as if Datoe
Pangeran, instead of having fled from the Balinese as stated, had been
sent to Praja by the Prince to act
in their interests? Certainly these
offers of assistance made by Gusti
Djilantik were strangely at variance
with his assurances of friendship
towards us; the contents of the letter
would further imply that he had not
yet abandoned all hopes of playing a
political part amongst the Sassaks,
confirming the impression made at the
beginning of the negotiations.
In view of all these facts the Com-
mander-in-chief decided to obtain
positive knowledge of the real dispo-
sition of the chiefs and the inhabitants
of the districts of Praja; it was also
desirable to know the intentions of
Goeroe Dangkol towards Datoe Pan-
geran, and the position of the
latter towards the Balinese members
of his family. This delicate task was
entrusted to Controller Liefrinck,
since September acting assistant-
J. H. Liefrinck.
resident at Lombock. He started on his missison on the 12th November,
travelling overland to Praja through a district, where daily skirmishes
were taking place between the Balinese and the Sassaks. The country
was also rendered unsafe by the Sassaks of Praja, itself, who were
plundering right and left, not even showing mercy to those of their own
tribes inhabiting the Western part of the island. On the day of his
departure a column consisting of two infantry battalions, a half-troop of
cavalry and two sections of mountain artillery under General Segov,
with Captain Willemstijn as Chief of the Staff, made a demonstration in
a Southerly direction towards Pagoetan, for the possession of which
kampong the Balinese and the Sassaks kept up a continuous struggle.
The troops marched via Kaleh to Pagasangan-East, took up their position
on the East frontier of the kampong and directed their artillery guns
against Abean Toeboeh, the most Southerly division of Tjakra Nagara.
Liefrinck reached Praja safely and his reception was everything that


could be desired; he told Goeroe Bangkol of the letter written by
Djilantik and warned him of the danger he ran if Datoe Pangeran
risked conniving at assistance from Bali. Goeroe Bangkol solemnly
declared that he would never have anything to do with the Balinese and
all the other chiefs gave repeated assurances of their friendliness and
gratitude to our government; Liefrinck was able to return on the 16th
November with satisfactory information.
Owing to the successful issue of the war we shall never know in how
far the disquieting rumours were really true or not; but we are safe
in saying; ?there is never smoke without fire!? And it is a noteworthy
fact- that no more disturbing news was received after Liefrinck?s mission
and we have no hesitation in stating that the timely measure of the
Commander-in-chief, combined with the tact of his envoy, saved us
from very imminent peril.
In another and more literal sense the atmosphere was clearer, for the
rains and storms of the latter part of October and the beginning of
November were only temporary and fortunately the actual rainy season
did not set in until some weeks later; everyone?s courage revived and
with renewed strength the operations were continued and carried through
to a triumphant termination.
To achieve this happy result more troops were needed. For within the
stiong walls of Tjakra Nagara the Balinese had concentrated all their
remaining forces and no sacrifice would be spared in the defence of their
last stronghold, abundantly supplied with ammunition and weapons.
The peculiar structure of the place with its numerous houses encircled
by high walls and forming as it were so many fortified posts was well
adapted to call forth all our energies; every attacking division would need
to be covered in flank and rear by strong detachments, thus lessening
the number of combatants as they advanced towards the point to be
attacked, and for this purpose there were but 8 battalions available, so an
additional reinforcement of 2 battalions of infantry was considered
necessary and fortunately the Government shared the opinion of the
Commander-in-chief, and telegraphed that when the time came when he
actually required further help, it would be sent him without delay. On
the 7th November General Vetter sent the telegram and on the 10th
the order was issued . . .
Before it could be deemed safe to direct operations exclusively against
Tjakra it was imperative to drive away the Balinese in occupation of
the North-East of Mataram still in communication with Tjakra and
forming an observation corps as it were in our midst and ready to take
the offensive at the proper time.
The day on which the Commander-in-Chief telegraphed for his rein-
forcements General Segov started at 4.80 a. m. with two battalions, the
6th and the 7th, two sections of mountain artillery, two sections of
engineers, the necessary train and some cavalry in order to clear the
kampong of Mondjok of the enemy, lay it waste and, if considered
expedient, construct a fort there.


About 7 a. m. two companies of the 6th and two of the 7th battalion
weie in the fiont line in the North East of Mataram; each company had
a section thrown out as skirmishers, and was supported by the second. The
hist line uas followed at a short distance by a second composed of one
company of each battalion. Ihe whole movement was covered by one
reserve company behind each battalion and the artillery was temporarily
divided amongst them.
Ihe advance proceeded slowly, all obstacles were cleared away with
spades, hatchets and pick-axes; half an hour later the company of the
left v\ mg (7th battalion) saw some armed Balinese, probab y advanced
outposts, taking flight, f his retreat was immediately followed by a vigorous
beating of the tom-toms at Moudjok, whereupon firing began; pro-
ceeding chiefly fiom the trees and was replied to by a few rounds from the
artillery; the Balinese who fortunately for us shot very badly on this
occasion not one of our troops was hit?fled at the end of a cjuarter
of an houi. Moudjok was soon occupied and the adjoining kampong of
Bangkal Ijoelik offered no resistance whatever; on the contrary several
Sassaks advanced with white flags and the Netherlands colours.
The right wing (6th battalion) was not long in pushing the enemy
out of the kampong of Taman-Radja, they having fled to the front of
Tjakra, which was immediately placed under fire.
Meanwhile the work of devastation was being proceeded with, walls
were laid low and trees were chopped down; many weapons were found
here and a quantity of things were recovered that had belonged to the
7th battalion, formerly stationed near here. As the work was pushed
forward it became evident there was no suitable place for a fortified
post, besides which there appeared no need for one.
The troops return; Mataram was entirely vacated by the enemy and
with the exception of Moudjok, completely laid waste. But what
a terrible task it was and how many thousands of hands worked at
it for weeks together!
Was this complete destruction?and the same applies to Pagasangan
and Pasinggahan?necessary or of any use? Was it necessary from a
military point of view? We read in the official report that already on
the 10th October, Mataram was in so far destroyed as to render
re-occupation by the enemy impossible; how is it then that a whole
month later it was considered unsafe to besiege Tjakra? Surely we
cannot put down this wholesale destruction to a spirit of revenge. It is
natural that at the beginning there was a strong desire to atone for the
first disaster, but weeks afterwards more dispassionate reasoning ought
to have prevailed; but we are convinced that mere anger and vengeance
cannot have been the guiding motives of the Commander-in-chief.
In our opinion it would have been desirable to confine the work of
dismantlement within the narrowest limits compatible with safety:
10. in our own immediate interests to save the strength and health
of the troops; and in order to pursue and terminate the operations as
soon as possible before the approaching west monsoon;


20. in onr future interests, which demanded the overthrow of our
enemy in the least possible space of time, and having forced them to
accept our rule, to restore them to their ordinary mode of life and
contribute to their welfare. A prosperous people loves peace, is more
inclined to order and quiet and is the easiest to govern.
Self-interest and humanity ought to have prevailed.
How many treasures of Balinese art have thus been lost to ns!
On the 11th November the iron bridge across the river Djangkok was
ready; and to facilitate the transport a beginning was made on the same
day with the Decauville railway from Ampenan to Mataram through
Kapitan. Our line of communication from the basis of operations
(Ampenan) to Pagasangan East being perfectly safe, work of dismantling
our post at Pagasangan West was begun also on this day.
On the 14th November General Segov, to whom Captain Willem-
stijn was attached as Chief of the staff, with a column consisting of
the 7th battalion, 100 men of the naval brigade, one section of mountain
artillery and 20 cavalry, marched through Kaleh to Pagasangan East,
hence in a Southerly direction past the outlying post No. 11l across
the wet sawah to the North frontier of Pagoetan, where they took up
position with the object of lending moral support to the Sassaks, conti-
nually harassed from Abean Toeboek and by wandering Balinese, and
also with the hope of inciting them to more energetic resistance against the
latter. After a short time and without having perceived anything
of the enemy they set out on the return march at a quarter past ten.
These days were busy ones, spent in general improvements; the Decau-
ville line was pushed rapidly forward and the accommodation for both
officers and men at Kapitan was being worked at; stables were also
put up for the artillery horses, a large quantities of sand was brought
up from the beach to repair the roads and a large supply of provisions
was laid in. Stores and ammunition were transported daily to the posts
and batteries, which needed to be well equipped for the coming action.
On the 16th and 17th November, the two days previous to the actual
assault, a heavy bombardment, of 60 to 80 rounds per gun, was to be
directed against Tjakra by all the batteries.
The main object of attack was of course the poeri; but each battery
was given a special objective. The three 12 cm. howitzers and the
one 12 cm. and a gun at Pagasangan East were to direct their fire
against the South of Tjakra, viz., Panaraga and Abean Toeboek. The
7 cm. gun at Karang-Bedil against Soeita and the East of Tjakra,
about 4000 yards distant; the three 12 cm. guns of this post were
to tire at Toh-pati (North Tjakra) and also to put the west front of
Tjakra under fire, south of the high road, to breach the walls for
the advance of the troops and to force the enemy to abandon that
face. With this object one of the 12 cm. guns of Padjang was
also put into requisition, as well as the three mortars which were stationed
there and with which it would be impossible to reach the Poeri. The


second 12 c. gun at Padjang was to direct its fire against Toh-pati
and the village of Sajang, North of Tjakra.
On the 16th November all the ships of the expeditionary Naval force
were collected in the harbour of Ampenan; the had come from
her cruising station in Kombal-bay, on the 12th; on the 15th the Bali
and the Brins Hendrik had arrived from the North coast. On the
17th the Borneo added her fire to the land batteries and threw 100
shells into Tjakra Nagara.
The Pi 'ins Hendrik, the Borneo, the Trom and the Bali, disembarked
their Naval Brigade (184 men) on the 17th and they were to occupy
the garrison of Kapitan during the operations against Tjakra.
Out of the Naval Brigade already on shore 60 men are to assist in
the capture of Tjakra, 60 others are to occupy Kaleh and 20 others
the outpost of the river Anjar.


XI.
FRESH REINFORCEMENTS. FALL OF TJAKRA N AGAR A.
Amidst great demonstrations of sympathy the two battalions appointed
to reinforce the expedition left their respective stations;
The sth, composed of 18 officers, 575 soldiers, 2 officers? horses with
23 women, left Semarang on the Gouverneur Generaal?s Jacob and the
11th of the same strength started on the from Meester
Cornells.
Early in the morning of the 16th November the G. Jacob entered
the harbour of Ampenan and by nine o?clock the sth battalion was
quartered in the old barracks on the shore. The ? arrived in the
afternoon, but owing to the heavy surf and the lateness of the hour
the disembarkation was postponed until the following morning, when by
10 a.m. the 11th battalion also reached the bivouac of Ampenan.
Much to the disappointment of the sth battalion they were not to take
any active part in the prospective attack, but were to take turns in
relieving the different posts with the ? Naval Brigade, thus leaving five
complete battalions for actual fighting: the 2nd, 6th, 7th, 9th and 11th.
On the 16th November detachments of the sth were despatched to
relieve the occupation of posts I, II and 111.
In the afternoon all the commanders of regiments were summoned to
a conference with the Commander-in-chief to receive their orders for
the action intended for next day. We give the orders in full to show
how much foresight is needed and how even the smallest detail is
thought of preparatory to such a serious undertaking:

The 4th (reserve) column under Major Willems of the 7th battalion
of infantry, one company of the Madurese troops, 60 men of the Naval
ugacle two sections of field artillery, one section of mountain artillery
and 75 convicts.
The 2nd battalion of infantry and two companies of the 9th now
occupying the posts, are to be relieved in time by the sth battalion.
Ihe attack on Tjakra Nagara is to take place from the west. The
different columns must march so that the three first reach the West
front of Tjakra by 5.30 a. m.; Scheuer?s column is to be on the right
bwart s in the middle and Segov?s on the left.
Scheuer?s column is to rest its left flank on the high road from Mata-
ram to Tjakra, and extend as far the nearest road Southwards, which
runs East and West: in order to secure its right flank, this column is
stronger, than the centre ope. Swart?s column is to advance between
the main road and the Antjar stream, while the right flank of Segov?s
column also rests on the Antjar. &
In order that the various columns may reach the points of attack in
good time they are to start in the following order:
Two companies of the 9th batalion, two companies of the 11th, three
gunners with hand grenades, two Cohorn mortars, one section of engi-


neers, four cavalry orderlies, 125 convicts and the relieving divisions
for Kaleh and Pagasangan East are to start from Ampenan at 8.80 a. m.
for Pagasangan East via Kaleh. The troops appointed to relieve these
posts will march on ahead, so that no time may be lost in effecting the
exchange and the troops stationed at the posts must be in marching
order when the fighting column comes up. Two cavalry orderlies are
to remain stationed at Kaleh and two at Pagasangan East to carry infor-
mation backwards and forwards, whilst the four available cavalry sol-
diers now at Pagasangan East are to be attached to Scheuer?s column,
but will temporarily stay at Mataram with the reserve column.
At 8.45 a.m. six cavalry troopers, one section of engineers, three
gunners with hand grenades, two Cohorn mortars, 125 convicts, besides
two sections of field- and the section of mountain artillery of the
reserve column and the troops appointed for the relief of the garrisons
at Arong-Arong, Mataram-Poeri, and the posts on the Antjar,
Karang-Bedil and Padjang, are to march from Ampenan to Padjang
via Arong-Arong and Mataram-poeri. The troops that are to garrison
Karang-Bedil march by Mataram-Poeri; the relieved garrison also goes
via Mataram-Poeri to Padjang to join the second column. Two cavalry
troopers remain at Mataram-Poeri and two at Padjang to carry orders
and instructions, whilst the remaining two with the two already at his
disposal are to act as orderlies to Colonel Swart. At 4 a. m. the
first or left column (at the head) and the fourth or reserve column
besides the field and mountain artillery are to march from Kapitan to
Mataram.
During all these marches the utmost stillness and silence are to be
observed.
At 4.80 a.m. 20 cavalry troopers with one officer must hold themselves
in readiness, to be disposed of as desired by the Commander-in-chief.
The men are to be in marching order without knapsacks, but must
carry their quilts and over-coats. In addition to his 60 cartridges, every
man must take 20 more in his trousers-pockets, and in his haversack
ketoepat (cooked rice in little bags of plaited cocoanut leaves) and a
two clay?s supply of ?dendeng? (smoked meat) or sardines; the coolies
will carry ?hollands? enough for two days. The cooking utensils are
to be taken, with cooks, cooks-mates and four kitchen coolies to each
company ?these are to be stationed at Mataram-Poeri.
At least four scaling-ladders ought to be carried by each company.
Each battalion can have at its disposal 64 convicts to carry reserve
ammunition, 76 for the ambulance, 16 for the kitchen utensils, 12 to
carry the gin and 82 for the scaling-ladders, in all 200.
Every section of mortars is to have 48 convicts.
Any corps unprovided with a sufficient number of convicts may
obtain the number wanted by applying through the Chief of the Staff
to the Commander of the general transport.
The meal hours are to be as follows:
The men are to breakfast before starting, while the cooked rice and


vegetables carried by each man, and the provision of smoked meat or
sardines for the day is to be used for supper. At Mataram-Poeri
cooked rice and vegetables will only be prepared for the following day ?
after that, dinner will be cooked for the whole column which will be
carried from there to Tjakra Nagara, as also the breakfast (including
ground coffee) for the next day. The necessary victuals will be stored
at Mataram-Poeri. The coffee for the next morning is to be made
y t -fi m +i l at Na ? ara ? after having used the kettles to make
.t with, they must be taken back to Mataram-Poeri. The transport
will then leturn to Tjakra with the day?s provision of ?ketoepat? which is
to be distributed to the men and carried in their haversacks.
le artillery attached to the various columns are to feed with the
I,C ;, 7 Column, including the Commander-in-chief and
the Chief of the Staff as also Lieutenant-Colonel Hamerster-attached
o tle Commander-in-chief ? will at the commencement of the operations
be stationed east of Padjang, about where the 7th battalion was
formerly located.
If the troops require more ammunition it can be fetched by the
infantry from Padjang and Mataram-Poeri or by the mounted artillery
from the various posts according to the orders of their commanding
o ceis; reserve hand grenades may be procured from the artillery
sections of the first, second and third column and at Mataram-Poeri.
.Both at Padjang and at Mataram-Poeri there are depots of engineering
material, in the event of forts having to be constructed at Tjakra
Aagara; at lUataram-Poen 150 lanterns are stored.
All Commanders of regiments and companies and all other officers
are particularly warned that no place is to be burned without leave of
the Commander-in-Cluef or the Chief of the Staff
During the operations Major' Laceulle will be in command at the
bivouac at Ampenan and Captain Otken at that of Kapitan.
By order:
(Signed) De Moulin.
Chief of the Staff.
Once again it is a Saturday night and again too we are dealing with
tjakra Aagara! but this time the parts in the drama are reversed and
it is we who are going to attack the enemy in their stronghold The
day of retribution is about to dawn! & ?
At the appointed hour the columns w r ere on the march, but not a
sound was heard; they intended to surprise the enemy! The moon lio-hted
up the path; they can hear in the distance that the posts are keeping up
a vl g�rous fire, the _ heavy cannon never ceases for one single instant;
as many as ten projectiles being hurled into Tjakra at one time; the
sound of the explosions is terrific and every now and then a red streak
m the sky shows the beginning of a fire* The troops are filled with
Ai? � _
As was discovered later, the enemy had unroofed many of the houses, so that there
were not many large fires, which was fortunate, as they would have caused great obstruction
to our troops.

enthusiasm; they see that the long desired result is close at hand,
Tjakra Nagara is bound to fall!
The right column, (Scheuer?s) which had started at 8 a.m. and relieved
the garrisons of the 9th battalion at Kaleh and Pagasangan East, reached
Doesoen Gebang, a small kampong East of Pagasangan at about 4.80 a.m.,
following in a North Easterly direction the road from there to Tjakra
Nagara; since the last reconnaissance had been made, a couple of days
before, the roads had got into a bad state, so that it was nearly
daybreak when the column arrived at the west front of Tjakra. With-
out seeing anything of the enemy they succeeded in taking up their
allotted nlace covered by a company and a half of the 11th battalion. Sud-
denly at about 5.80
a.m. heavy firing
was heard from
the North, indicat-
ing that the left
column was already
engaged with the
Balinese and that
further surprise was
out of the question.
The enemy had
been driven from
the West front
by our artillery and
was now defending
the interior of the
capital with the
greatest pertinacity
and it would be
necessary to fightfor
it inch by inch. Each
homestead must be
captured one by one
and every few steps
there were fresh
i
walls to be thrown
down or pierced.
Time after time
small bodies of
troops advanced
? Balinese Lady/
lance or spear in hand and flung themselves on our soldiers; true they met
their own death in this desperate struggle, but at a terrible cost of men
to our side. In this fashion fifteen cross roads or alleys had to be
traversed before reaching the main road running from North to South
from Teliwang to Abean Toeboek; notwithstanding that the distance was
passed as quickly as possible, we sustained considerable loss from the

? Attacking the N, E ; Poeri of Tjakra Nagara,?


Balinese shooting from the trees and walls on the South. At one of
the last side roads before the main road from Tjakra Nagara to Mata-
ram, four Balinese rushed forward with their lances; three met almost
instantaneous death, whilst the fourth, although wounded, rushed onwards
and thrust his spear into Captain Scheib, who succumbed immediately
the infuriated soldiers showed no mercy and the fourth man was soon
disposed of. It was a frightful sight, some men even hid amongst
their wives and children, who asked ?arapon? (mercy) for them. But
the duty of self-defence permits of no forgiveness here.
Women, magnificently dressed and belonging to the highest, the
Brahmin caste, threw themselves blindly amongst our troops trying to
defend themselves with spears, but they too met their death as their
husbands had done. They sought death in preference to dishonour!
They had been made to believe that if they lived they would be
handed over to our soldiers as concubines and they preferred death to
the shame of being treated as the despised caste of Sudras.
Scheuer?s column reached the high road from Teliwang to Abean
Toeboeh at 11 o?clock; here they saw a division of the centre column
(Swart?s) hurriedly retreating from the west wall of the large poeri, the
former residence of the chief, North Bast of the cross-roads. Had it
been repulsed ? And what had it being doing in the interval ?
Although this column had started a quarter of an hour later than
the right column it was able to enter Tjakra Nagara at 5.15 a.m. on
the West between the high road and the river Antjar when the bom-
bardment had ceased. Nothing was visible of the enemy and the greater
jart of the walls and homesteads were destroyed, the few remaining ones
being deserted and everything around testified to the successful work of
our artillery; Swart?s column was able to penetrate 300 metres inside the
town without meeting the enemy, who was evidently surprised. However, as
soon as the first shot was fired in the North, the tomtom summoned all the
Balinese and henceforward the column?s advance met with the same
energetic resistance as Scheuer?s, and, as at the capture of Mataram,
most of our losses were caused from the Balinese posted in the trees.
Many bands of both men and women impeded our progress with their
spears; in every case they paid for it with their lives, but not without
inflicting considerable loss on our soldiers.
The nearer the columns came to the central point of defence, the
more obstinate and fierce was the resistance encountered; and thus pushing
forward steadily they arrived near the N. W. Poeri, the former head-
quarters; in their endeavours to take this point the troops were furiously
fired upon on the right wing from the S. W. Poeri, so it was necessary
to capture this stronghold before advancing towards the residence of
the Prince. Colonel Swart advanced to the front line to give his orders
and directions and after a few vollies, the 3rd company under Captain
Van den Ende and a portion of the 2nd under Lieutenant Heijtman
advanced towards the S. W. poeri, and, at the head of a section of
Amboynese, Captain Van den Ende penetrated into one of the squares


densely occupied by the Balinese; there was a short sharp hand to hand
hg i anc 6 Balinese lay dead on the ground, 16 having been killed
with he bayonet I'he S. W. poeri was very soon in our possession, but
it had cost the lire of Lieutenant Ancona.
At about 11 a.m. they were able to attack the North-East poeri- the
right wing (4th company) under Captain Koch attacked the West wall of the
poeri; there were however no breaches to pass through and the wall was
too high to climb and there were no scaling ladders at hand; a section
of engined s succeeded in laying a breaching charge of dynamite
and it was just when they were running away from the wall to
await the result at a distance, that Major Scheuer?s column appeared
at the cross-roads. 11
As soon as the charge had exploded (near space 4, see plan of poeri
at Ijakra Nagara) the Ist and 2nd sections hurried to the breach- the
inopean fusilier Aan der Klamp, was the first to enter and was soon
followed by the men of the Ist, 2nd and 3rd section, the last being
replaced by the 4th in the high road running West to East and
followed with their fire the retreating enemy. It was Swart?s column
vho were the first to penetrate the poeri; they were inside, but how were
they to get on beyond it?
The three sections now found themselves in spaces 4 and 3 leading
to space 15 by a narrow street and a gate; through a hole in?the wall
they could see the enemy and they shot a few of them down, with the
result that some took to flight and others rushed towards them through
the narrow doorway; all, who were not killed in their attempt to pass
irough the door, were killed as soon as they came upon our men in the
space now occupied by us. The street and space 15 were subsequently
?occupied by the 4th company. ,y
, Whilst Captain Koch was trying to push north in the poeri, Major
ocheuer had forced his way into space 15. On arrival at the cross
roads one company of the right column showed front to the South-
one detachment occupied the ground South and South East of the poeri?
another further Bast of the high road to Narmada and one company
succeeded in taking the large front square (space 2). The engineers
attached to this column effected a breach in the high wall on the east of
the square, thus allowing of an advance into space 14, the enemy
withdrawing still further into the interior and the next movement brought
.out the meeting of the two columns in space 15. Before proceeding
with the account of these two columns in their long and bitter conflict,
et us see what had befallen the left column, who contrary to all antici-
pations had found themselves confronted with the main body of. the
Balinese. J
When Segov?s column, having marched from Ampenan half an hour
later than the right column, reached a point West of Padjang about
o a.m., they crossed the river Antjar and fell into their line of battle at
5.10 a.m. East of Jaman-Radja: The Ist company on the right, the 4th
on the left wing, the 2nd in the middle, the Ist section in ?all cases

being in the fighting line, the 2nd about twenty paces behind. The 3rd
company formed the reserve.
After marching along the north frontier of Tjakra in this order about
a distance of 450 yards, the column was perceived by the enemy, but
the few Balinese occupying the sawah were soon put to flight by a
couple of vollies from the Ist company.
This was, however, immediately followed by severe firing from the front
of Tjakra, which was energetically responded to by the advancing column.
The 2nd company of Amboynese under Captain Schreijner took up
position on an eminence, whence they fired steadily, causing extensive
damage. The section of mountain artillery on the left flank directed then
fire against the sawah tract north of Seliwang to prevent assistance from
til at. nna.rt.er being brought to Tjakra. Advancing further eastwards
Schreijner?s com-
pany had to en-
dure an especially
heavy fire from be-
hind the walls.
After uniting the
Ist section of the
right?with the left
wing Captain
Schreijner advanced
and was immedia-
tely followed by
the entire company,
who were soon
inside the narrow
northern portion of
Tjakra which had
been assigned to
Segov?s column as
point of attack.
While the sec-
tion of mountain
artillery continued
for a time in the
position they had
taken up, the lead-
ing sections pushed
forward with all
their strength to
the high road of
Teliwang and the
?A section of mountain artillery on march.?
cross roads were reached at 7 a.m. According to their instructions, they
endeavoured to proceed southwards to the poeri, but at this point-they
were overwhelmed by the Balinese who had been driven away from


West Ijakra by Swarts and Scheuer?s columns; the enemy?s forces
were so numerous that the position was only held with the greatest
difficulty and with much loss.
The reserve was called up to cover the left wing and the artillery left
to take care of itself.
General Segov tried in vain to effect a junction with the centre
column; a change of front Southwards was impossible without it, the
enemy on the right hand flank holding too many of our troops in check.
Hie reserve on the left flank were repulsed in an assault against a
Dewa temple standing east of the high road from Teliwang and the
situation was becoming dangerous.
At 7.80 a.m. General Segov sent word to the Commander-in-chief
that he could not effect a junction with Swart?s column and that reinforce-
ments were needed to make the change of front as ordered, possible.
This news was received by the Commander-in-chief at 8 a.m. Neither
of the other columns had yet reached the large poeri, the chief goal,
and both had still to face a severe struggle, the result of which could
hardly be foreseen.
General Vetter sent an answer by two cavalry orderlies to the
effect, that no reinforcements could as yet be sent, but that a message
was being sent to Swart s column to push north and try and join the
left column.
The orderlies were unable to pass through Tjakra and deliver the
answer, everywhere they were met by the enemy and were obliged to
return to the Commander-in-chief, who meanwhile had arrived nearer
the poeri.
Colonel Segov?s column was meantime in a bad way and many of his
brave men had been laid low?it grew later and later and yet he
received no answer to his request and no relief ;?finally he sent his
staff-officer, de Greve, to the Commander-in-chief with the question:
?whether in spite of all the difficulties he was to try and effect a change
of front southwards, or whether he should try to re-cross the Antjar
and join Colonel Swart?s column??
Lieutenant de Greve fell in with General Vetter at the cross
roads, just as the latter was giving orders to two companies of the 7th
battalion from the general reserve, to go to the relief of the left column along
the high road to the cross-roads of Teliwang. Now that the Commander-
in-chief found himself master of the main cross-roads and inside a portion
of the poeri, he felt himself in a position to despatch some of the
general reserve to the help of the left column.
What had the reserve been doing in the meantime?
It left Ampenan at the same time as Segov?s column and had at
first taken up a position on the high road Mataram-Tjakra Nagara,
south of Padjang, subsequently slowly following the advancing movement
of Swart?s and Scheuer?s columns. Once inside Tjakra its progress
had been much impeded by the destruction that had been wrought to
the roads and a good deal of clearing was necessary before it could

proceed with the ordnance. Whilst advancing they also cleared the
roads of all enemies they met, knocked down walls or made large
passages through them. They fell in with a good number of Balinese
Doth north and south of the high road attempting to pursue the rear
of the advancing columns and, thus fighting their way onward, the reserve
arrived at the cross roads just as Swart?s and Scheuer?s columns were
about to attack the poeri. They had just posted themselves there with
the two companies of the 11th battalion of the left columns when the
orders of the Commander-in-chief reached them.
? High road inside Tjakra Nagara.?
The two companies of the 7th battalion appointed to relieve the left
column immediately advanced along the high road to Teliwang, crossed
the river Antjar and threatened in the rear the Balinese attacking General
Begov's right flank. These, now freed from the enemy, made with the
help of the two fresh companies a movement north, in order to attack
the Dewa-temple as ordered; but by the time the troops entered the enemy
had fled. The walls of the temple were at once levelled to the ground
and the remainder of the captured position cleared as much as possible.
Subsequently the column advanced to the cross roads and the exhausted
troops arrived there about 1 p. m.
During this time the advance in the poeri had been continued; after
occupying space 15, one section managed to penetrate into the passage
between 5 and 16, but was severely attacked by Balinese with spears.
However the enemy were overmastered and an advance north was made
by the three sections from space 5, the passage way and space 16.
Whilst the Ist and 3rd companies of the 2nd battalion were pushing


forward North and North East, Scheuer?s column was advancing along
the south extending his line eastwards.
Amidst continuous fighting they captured the West and North East
spaces, advancing as far even as the Majoera, the eastern portion of
the poeri; but all attempts to capture the central portion were in vain.
Here the Balinese had taken up position and had strongly fortified the
high surrounding walls. This portion of the poeri proved to be the
actual residence of the prince, space 22a. b. c. and 23 the treasury.
Here the Balinese fought with the energy of despair to defend their
prince and his treasure.
Lieutenant Gerlach faced the redoubt with his section in space 17,
Lieutenant Oudshoorn with his in space 18 and Lieutenant Verwey Mejan
occupied space 24 with two sections.
Every endeavour made by the column from these points as well as
all attempts made by the Ist and 3rd companies of the 2nd battalion
to penetrate deeper into the palace remained without the slightest effect.
Neither the fire of the guns against this fortified group of houses, nor
the 12 c.m. shells thrown in by hand, not even setting fire to one of
the buildings north of the fortified post could induce the Balinese to
surrender their stronghold. Picked shots entrenched in the innermost
building of the prince?s abode shot down with repeaters every man who
raised his head above the protecting walls.
In vain too were all the efforts of Scheuer?s column; finally two moun-
tain guns were brought into requisition and at less than 25 paces distance
fifty shells were thrown against the fortified houses; the fire of the enemy
was silenced; ?it looked as if they no longer intended defending themselves.
A third attempt to penetrate was made and Lieutenant Muller entered as
far as the front gallery without receiving any fire; the barricaded door
was thrown open. He thought himself master of the situation?but once
inside fire poured upon him from all sides, and it was only by a miracle
that he returned with his wounded.
The artillery once again opened fire on the houses, another company,
the first of the 9th battalion, made one more assault; but in vain, the
troops were again repulsed with heavy losses.
It was now 3 p. m. and no apparent progress was being made. Major
Scheuer sent word to the Commander-in-chief at the cross roads of
the state of affairs and to ask for further orders.
The troops, who had not tasted food or drink for twelve hours and
had been fighting nearly the whole time, were absolutely done up with
exhaustion and fatigue. The hour was too far advanced now for a system-
atic dismantlement, even should the stronghold fall into their hands,
so the Commander-in-chief decided to put an end to the operations for
that day and allow the men time to recover before proceeding any
further. At 2.30 p. m. food was been brought up from Mataram-poeri to
Tjakra under the personal supervision of Major van Berg of the transport.
The 9th battalion with a section of engineers Avere appointed to occupy
during the night the Dewa-temple South of the Majoera, Avhilst three


companies of the 11th battalion and one section of engineers were left in
another temple, lying South West of the high road, but just bordering on it.
Both positions were strengthened as much as possible from the stores
of engineering material at Padjang and Mataram-Poeri. About 4p. m.
the troops not told off to occupy Tjakra assembled in the high road and
marched to their respective quarters, reaching Kapitan and Ampenan about
6 p. m., where they were most enthusiastically received and hoped
to enjoy a well-earned rest. It was not to be a long one however, as a hot
contest was anticipated on the morrow before the enemy?s last stronghold
was taken.
At 5.80 a. m. on the following day, 19th November, a column under
General Segov advanced from Kapitan; it was composed of the 2nd and
6th battalions, three companies of the 7th, one company of the 11th,
two companies of Madurese, two sections of field and one section mountain
artillery, two cohorn mortars, one section of engineers, in addition to
all the available convicts of the general train.
On their arrival at the cross-roads at Tjakra Nagara they learned from
the troops left in occupation that the night had been undisturbed; but
that the sentries had heard people moving inside the poeri and further-
more that a scouting party sent out at daybreak found that the space
so stoutly defended by the Balinese on the previous day had been
deserted but was being looted by a mass of people, who quickly dispersed
at the sound of the rifles. The treasury of the prince was discovered,
where in a chamber 16 ft. 9 ins. by 16 ft. 9 ins., rijksdaalders were
heaped up to the height of 2 ft., besides which there were many objects
in gold, precious stones and endless valuable curiosities.
But where was the old prince himself?
According to report he had been wounded the previous day during
the siege of his palace and his faithful followers had conveyed him
during the night to Sasari, a kampong north of Tjakra Nagara on the
road to Lingsar.
On receipt of this news the Commander-in-ehief with the Chief of
the staff made the following disposition for the troops:
The 6th battalion were to clear the ground north and south of the
high road?the west entrance to Tjakra Nagara, breaking down all the
walls possible, to begin with those running along the high road; subse-
quently they were to clear the road, so that traffic might not be
impeded.
Two companies of the 11th battalion w r ere to dismantle the Dewa-temple,
S. West of the cross roads, where they spent the night. When this was
accomplished they were to open up the ground lying around the temple
occupied during the night by the 9th battalion, as this temple was
intended for occupation by the troops.
Three companies of the 7th battalion were to prepare this temple to
accommodate the troops and put it in a state of defence and occupy
these quarters when the remaining troops returned to Ampenan and Kapitan.
The 9th battalion and one section of engineers were to place the most


S. W. portion of the poeri and the one containing the treasury in a
thorough state of defence. One company, the 4th of the above-named
battalion, was especially charged to guard the treasury and pack up all
the money and treasure found.
The Madurese were to guard the cross-roads.
A column commanded by colonel Swart, consisting of the 2nd battalion,
two companies of the 11th, one section of mountain artillery, one section
of engineers and 12 cavalry soldiers with one officer, received orders
to make a reconnaissance in an easterly direction, (towards Soeita) to
try and reach the east exit of Tjakra Nagara and to carefully examine
the ground on both sides.
During their march many Balinese implored to have their lives and
homesteads spared and the request was granted on condition that they
broke down the walls enclosing them and those running along the streets,
but, in case of refusal, everything was levelled to the ground.
The population immediately set to work to fulfil these conditions and
further showed their good will by offering the soldiers cocoa-nuts and
drinking water.
Swart s column reached the goal of the march without encountering
any hostility or resistance.
Many inhabitants of the captured town came to make their submission
to the Commander-in-chief and were informed by the Resident of Bali
and Lombock that their lives and dwellings would be spared, if they
complied with the above mentioned conditions. The Commander of
Narmada, Gusti Made Getas, also came to the General to make his
surrender.
In the treasury of the old prince the Commander of the 4th com-
pany and his two officers had put 1000 lbs. of gold and 6996 lbs. of
silver coins?the latter slightly damaged by fire?into bags and this
was only a part of the booty! It was placed on carts for transport
to Ampenan, to be received there by a specially appointed committee.
In the course of the day the inhabitants of Tjakra brought back to
us two field-guns and a mountain gun left behind in our retreat three
months before. There was still one piece of ordnance missing and
this too they promised to bring, everything was progressing beyond our
expectations.
Alas! once again our victory was marred as it was after the capture
of Mataram.
Whilst Captain Tuinenburg was engaged superintending the emptying
of a powder magazine of the poeri into the big pond in the Majoera
lest the fire from a neighbouring house should spread to it, a spark appears
to have flown across, causing the most frightful explosion. Captain
Tuinenburg, shockingly burned, was flung into the pond; Lieutenant Campioni,
who was assisting him, was badly scorched and thrown to a great distance;
thirteen convicts carrying out the work were so seriously hurt that
some died very soon after and the others had to be transported to the
hospital at Ampenan.


The whole supply of powder and ammunition was afterwards rendered
harmless by the engineers. With the exception of the three companies
of the 7th battalion remaining at Tjakra, all the other troops returned
to their respective quarters at 4 p.m.
Tjakra Nagara, being taken, we may take a look at the exact position
of things and a retrospective glance at the overthrow of Balinese power
in Lombock.
The losses on both sides were severe; it is impossible to deter-
mine accurately those of the Balinese. No absolute reliance can be
placed on the numbers given by natives, however well-intentioned they
may be, for they are quite unable to grapple with big figures. But,
from the following, some idea may be arrived at.
In their advance from West Tjakra to the poeri, the 3rd company of
the 2nd battalion, who met with the least resistance comparatively
speaking, counted from 25 to 30 Balinese killed outside the S.W. poeri.
If we reckon the losses inflicted by the four companies of Swart?s
column as being four times this number, we are more likely to under-
than over-estimate the figures.
Scheuer?s column must have claimed an equal number of victims, so
that the total loss inflicted by the two columns before storming the
poeri may be put down as between 200 and 300. Adding to this the
numbers killed by the left column who met with the longest and most
stubborn stand and those killed by the reserve column, we should say
the figures would reach 400 to 500.
Inside the poeri 37 dead bodies were found in one room, 17 in
another and groups of 3, 4 and 8 were found in several places,
so that we may safely assume the number of Balinese that fell at the
siege of Tjakra Nagara to be about 600,
Whatever importance may be attached to this, there is no doubt that
the Balinese losses were very great; on their scouting expedition on the
morning of the 19th on the road to Soeita, Swart?s column counted
500 dead bodies in a space some 1300 yds. long by 170 yds, wide.
All the houses both right and left of the road were examined, in one
there were 18 dead bodies, in another 11, in a third 7, etc. We must,
however, bear in mind the custom of the Balinese of keeping their dead
above ground and that many bodies may probably have lain there from
the date of previous battles or have been brought thither from other
neighbourhoods.
But on our side too victory was dearly bought!
Mingled with the shouts of joy and triumph sent up in the mother
?country, there was sorrow and grief in the hearts of many who have
to mourn the loss of a dearly-beloved father, brother, sons or friend.

H. Holkema, both of the infantry, besides 103 soldiers were wounded.
The medical staff did splendid work; every column had its own
ambulance with one or two surgeons; stretchers and carriers were in
abundance to carry the wounded as quickly as possible to the head
ambulance, stationed opposite the fortified post of Padjang, where a shed
about 100 metres long had been erected containing space for 40 men
and two operating tables.
After the wounds had been
attended to, those who were able
to be transported were sent to
Ampenan and then on board
the hospital ship ? Maetsuijcker? .
The delegates of the Red Cross,
as well as the head of the
Society for mutual Help, pro-
vided the sick with all the
necessary refreshments.' The
Senior Chaplain, Offerhous, re-
mained at the head ambulance
and the Reverend Father Yoogel
was with the columns, giving
spiritual assistance and com-
fort to wounded and dying.
Major Schuckink Kool conscien-
tiously superintended the burial
of the killed. Those who fell
in the service of their country
received therefore every care
and attention. All this, and
the consideration of the great
object their dead ones helped
to achieve, may be of some slight
consolation to those who are
left to denlore their loss.
? Father F. J. A. Yoogel.?
The whole of Tjakra bore evidence of the efficiency of our artillery;
some parts had naturally suffered more than others; considering the
wide area covered by the poeri?7oo by 800 yards ?with its innumer-
able walls and divisions, it was of course impossible to lay it in ruins
in a few hours, the interior however had fared badly and some portions
were entirely destroyd. Oddly enough, the West and South outer wall
showed no traces of the bombardment; only a fragment of a shell had
caught the upper part at one spot. Besides, we had proofs of the fort
artillery doing great execution by their blowing up two powder magazines,
known to be in the vicinity of the poeri. We must however not lose
sight of the favorable circumstances that permitted our batteries being
placed within such a short distance of Tjakra, thus enabling all the
guns, even the 20 cm. mortars, to take an effectual share in the bom-

FRESH REINFORCEMENTS. FALL OF TJAKRA NAGAR A.


bardment. The siege train may be said to have played a great part in
the capture of Pagasangan, Mataram and Tjakra Nagara, but, it was
rather in spite of its guns than by them; they left a good deal to be
wished for. The best gun was the 12 cm. breachloader, a very good
gun, as long as it is not worn out with tiring. As we have already
mentioned, six had been transported to Lombock, one was placed in
battery at Pagasangan, two at Padjang and three at Karang-Bedil; not
only were they few in number, but, out of these few, there were only
two modern ones, the others being old and thus probably nearly
worn out.
Of the four 12 cm. muzzleloaders, brought from the abandoned fort
at Tjilatjap, one was completely worn out, and the others, placed in
battery at Pagasangan East, though still serviceable, only carried 2530
yards, or, with shrapnel .1760, being thus worth but little. The worst,
however, were the wholly antiquated 20 c.m. bronze mortars; six of
which had been despatched to Lombock, but half only could be placed
in battery against Tjakra (viz., at Padjang.)
; When fired with a full charge, their range was only 1500 yards,
and had but slight penetration. But with such a large and close target
they produced a great moral effect, owing to their large calibre.
The quality of the ammunition was first-rate; it rarely occurred that
the shells did not explode and their not doing so might be accounted
for by their falling into the large ponds of the poeri.
Regarding the number of rounds fired, it was at first decided that every
gun should discharge 80 rounds daily. In order that the enemy might be
harassed all day long it was arranged that each of the three batteries should
rest two hours for every one hour of firing?the original plan being to
maintain this rate for fourteen days, then to double it for three days
previous to the actual assault. When, shortly after the commencement
of the bombardment, resistance became so stubborn, the roads grew bad,
transport more difficult, the unloading of ammunition more complicated,
communication with the harbour even interrupted and all the branches of
the service severely taxed, some fear was felt that the ammunition would
run short if the firing was kept up at this rate, that is to say
owing to the many obstacles it might be impossible to replenish the
supplies. * It was for this reason and not for lack of ammunition
that the Commander-in-Chief ordered a diminution in the rate of
firing.
If, then, the bombardment of Tjakra Nagara, both by reason of the
guns used and the small quantity of ammunition expended during a
certain period, was not quite so vigorous as might otherwise have been
both feasible and desirable, no reproach must attach to the staff, who,
from the Commander, Major Boetje, downwards, made the very most
of what was at their disposal.
. -^ s regards the replenishing of the supplies the guns were regularly provided with a
six days? store; considering that the supply was taken to one of the three posts every dav,
each post must have always had at the very least a three day?s allowance of ammunition. ?


A word of praise too must not be omitted for those responsible
away from the actual seat of war, but, who worked indefatigably at
the artillery work shops and at the laboratory at Surabaya. By con-
tinuous work, sometimes both day and night and even Sundays, this
body of men were able to satisfy the heavy demands of the expe-
ditionary forces.
Concerning the actual and final assault, there were of course various
ways of undertaking it, to review which would take too much time.
Ihe plan adopted was essentially a simple one, an important matter
in military operations skilful and complicated combinations there were
none; all three columns had one and the same plainly marked out goal,
viz., the cross-roads occupied by the prince?s poen. If we consider, that,
notwithstanding this obvious simplicity and distinctness, both of the
fiont attacking columns had to bear the brunt of the fight unaided,
that the left column was unable to effect a junction with the centre,'
that communication could not be kept up by the cavalry orderlies, we
have a practical lesson in the difficulties attendant on a combined
attack in India. It is clear, that if these take place on a large scale and
at great distances, the result hangs merely upon a thread.
Ihe composition and use of the general reserve can only meet with
universal approval. Its strength, as far as the infantry was concerned,
4 companies of the twenty available for the assault, was none too great ?
the other columns could not have been weaker than they were, so that
the necessity of further reinforcements, first of one, then of two bat-
talions of infantry, is conclusively proved.
The inference to be drawn regarding the inadequacy of the first expe-
ditionary force is self-evident; for, although the Balinese had time to
organize the rebellion, the defence, and especially the peculiar disposition
of the place where their chief forces were concentrated, would have
been the same in both cases and, although, we cannot but regret the
losses and the retreat of the 26th of August, there is not the slightest
doubt, but what our disasters would have been far more serious had we
attempted to take Mataram and Tjakra Nagara by storm when we first
landed. This expedition points in a striking manner to the absolute
necessity of sending at the very outset of an expedition sufficient force
to meet all eventualities.
The capture of Tjakra Nagara has once more testified to the efficiency
of our Indian army and to the magnificent results to be obtained by
it. Skilfully led, supported by a clever general staff, headed by men like
Segov, Swart and Scheuer, our troops fought with such unflagging
energy against a well-armed enemy, defending his hearth and home with
desperate resolution, that their heroic courage and contempt of death
finally conquered all obstacles in their path.
The crowning point of the combat was the siege and defence of the
poeri; here, in the presence of the old rajah himself, the last decisive
struggle was fought; this last stronghold was defended with the energy
?of despair, and both men and women sacrificed themselves literally at


the foot of the throne. Many krissed themselves rather than fall into
our hands. *
Let ns give honour to our opponents, who, in the days of prosperity,
showed every deference to the vanquished and who died like heroes in
the time of adversity.
Might not the poeri have been entirely surrounded on the afternoon
of the 18th November? We think that the capture of the poeri might
have been very probable and that it would have been quite practicable
to surround the place; but we consider that the Commander-in-chief
showed great discretion in not exacting the uttermost from the exhausted
troops and exposing them to a night attack in an unprepared position.
One important way of escape was cut off for the prince and his
defenders as a greater part of the territory was occupied by Sassaks,
and, any extra money that would have been added to our treasury by
continuing the struggle the same day, would have been bought too dear,
for it would have cost many more precious lives.
So, without a blow or a shot, the last stronghold of the enemy fell
into our hands the next day.
The prophecy of the governor was fulfilled! Our Indian army had
maintained its reputation in the most brilliant manner and one more
glorious page had been added to the annals of our country.
* In one of the portions of the post, where such a stubborn defence was made on the
previous day, 4 women were krissed. One, who was remarkably young and beautiful and
belonging to the Brahmin caste, had been one of the old prince?s favorites.


XII.
FALL OF THE LOMBOCK DYNASTY.
The rebellion was, virtually speaking, terminated the day we captured
Tjakra Nagara; but, with a view to the future settlement of affairs, we
had still to obtain possession of the Prince and the chief members of his
family. The old Rajah having, according to report, fled to Sasari, the
most North Easterly point of Tjakra, a column was sent there on the
morning of the 20th November, starting from Ampenan at 3.80 a.m.
under command of General Segov and composed of the 2nd, 6th, and
11th battalion, one company of the 7th, two companies of Madurese, two
sections field- two sections mountain artillery, 4 gunners with hand
grenades, two sections of engineers, 22 cavalry soldiers and one cavalry
officer, besides all the available convicts.
Reaching the cross-roads of Tjakra at 7.15 a.m. three companies of
the 2nd battalion, one company of Madurese and two sections of field-
artillery were ordered by the Commander-in-chief to block the various
ways leading to the cross-roads and to keep guard, whilst half a section
of engineers, under cover of the remaining company of the 2nd battalion,
were told off to search the treasury and all other possible receptacles and'
secure the contents.
The remaining troops and one company of the sth battalion as well
as 100 convicts were to proceed to Sasari, where general Segov, with
Major van Kooten and Ist Lieutenant de Greve as Staff-officers, were to
try and arrest the prince. From the cross-roads they followed the high
road in an Easterly direction, striking north at the second crossing and
halted shortly after passing over the Antjar. Meanwhile the cavalry were
ordered to ride through the rice-field and reach the road to Lingsar
with the utmost speed and post themselves east of Sasari to prevent the
prince?s escape from this point.
The 6th battalion, with one section of mountain artillery, half a sec-
tion of engineers and 50 convicts, marched in a N. E. direction to the
village of Selakala, where they changed front and took up their position
on the road to Lingsar, east of and facing Sasari.
The 11th battalion, a section of engineers and 50 convicts advanced
northwards through Poenia and took up position South of the road to
Lingsar, also facing Sasari.
23


The remaining troops ?one company of the sth and one of the 7th
battalion, one company of Madurese and one section of mountain artillery ?
formed the reserve between and in rear of the two first mentioned columns.
When these had taken up their appointed positions, the cavalry were
relieved and received orders to watch the saw ah from the North and
North West of Sasari as far as the high road from Teliwang to Abean
Toeboeh and to prevent flight in that direction. AVhilst nearing the
north of Sasari, a few shots were fired at them but they found no serious
obstruction on their road.
Two Balinese were now despatched to the prince, calling on him to
surrender; flight was impossible and if he did not give himself up of
his own free will, force would be used. Who could predict the line of
action that he would adopt? The prince was really here with his son, Anak
Agong Made Djilantik, successor to the throne since the death of K?Toet,
and with his grandson (son of K?Toet) Anak Agong G?de Oka. It must
be borne in mind that we are now dealing with the brother of the
rajah who in 1846 expressed himself as ?unable to understand that a
Balinese rajah had taken to flight instead of shutting himself up in his
Kraton with his people and fighting to his last breath as demanded by
the custom of the country and the honour of a rajah.?
How differently history would have dealt with the memory of this
famous prince, had he acted consistently with the theories he shared in
earlier years, and how many humiliations and mortifications he would
have been spared.
For two long hours he hesitated, but finally decided to throw himself
upon our mercy and to surrender himself, his son and his grandson to
General Segov.
Attired in yellow and seated upon a chair, he was carried by his followers
to the victor, an event never to be forgotten by those who witnessed
it and occupying a memorable place in the history of our Indian warfare.
That the surrender might not have any appearance of being a voluntary
one and to exclude all false apprehensions from the minds of the Balinese,
the request made by the prince, to be carried the whole way by his
own attendants was refused.
Six convicts were appointed to carry his chair and two carried the
golden pajong (umbrella) ?the only remaining symbol of his greatness ?
to protect the head of the prince against the scorching rays of the sun.
All the columns united in the return march to Ampenan, excepting
the sth, 7th and 11th battalions, who remained to act as escort to the
treasure discovered that day, consisting of 7459 lbs. of silver and three
cases of valuables. In due course Mataram, or rather the space it once
covered, was passed and who can tell the feelings of the prince when
he looked round in vain for his former capital.
Ihe prince was temporarily housed in the offices at Ampenan, used
hitherto by the General-Staff, and a squadron of infantry mounted guard.
The joy of the troops and comrades at Ampenan was boundless!
Three companies of the 7th battalion occupied the Dewa-temple, now put


into a state of defence and one company of this battalion was left in the
poeri to guard the treasury.
V arious notable Balinese surrendered themselves the same day, amongst
others, Anak-Agoeng K?Toet Djilantik Kanginan, grandson of the Ranalds
eldei brothei, rrho died in 1870. Finally, the last missing gun was
brought back by the inhabitants.
Now that we had secured the prince, his son and his grandson, it
was the turn of the remaining members of the family and on the
21st November the prince was instructed to write to his relatives at Sasari
bidding them come at
once to Ampenan. The
two Balinese messengers
returned with unsatisfac-
tory replies: one member
of the family, Anak Agoeng
Nengah Karang, a son of
the before mentioned elder
brother of the prince, had
excused himself on the
plea of illness, two others
were absent, etc.
On receipt of these replies
a column commanded by
Colonel Swart, composed
of the 6th and 11th infantry
battalions, mountain artil-
lery and two companies of
Madurese (Captain Otken)
marched to Sasari, which
they reached at 9 a.m. and
surrounded. The members
of the prince?s family were
summoned to surrender and,
as the parleying led to
nothing, the artillery opened

fire on their residence at 11.80 a.m.
1 lie place nas soon in flames, and at the same time a terrible noise was
heard; from the border of the kampong a brisk fire was directed on our
advancing troops on the east side. The reserve were ordered to go to
their relief, but, by the time they had reached the fighting line, a terrible
drama had taken place.
Whilst the 6th battalion were encircling the kampong more closely,
suddenly, and amidst the wildest yells and cries, a whole band of Balinese
rushed forth from the burning pile on Captain Schreiner?s column.
These were all the remaining members of the reigning family with
their suite, poenggawas, idas, gustis, men, women and children; they
were ready to seek death and had arrayed themselves in their most


elegant dresses, adorned themselves with jewelry, armed themselves
with the sacred kris or spear and, thus prepared, they hurried themselves
with all their strength on our soldiers.
This was the famous ?poepotan!?*
Our soldiers did not hesitate for a moment; the enemy was quickly
decimated; few came within reach of our bayonets, those who were
not immediately shot down took their own lives rather than fall into
our hands. Amongst those killed in this last struggle were two sons
of Made; Anak Agoeng k?Toet Djilantik Weda and Anak Agoeng Ajoe
Made, a great-grandson of the prince, (Anak Agoeng G?de Djilantik)
the five year old son of Anak Agoeng G?de Poetoeh, killed at Pagasangan,
all the daughters of the Rajah: Anak-Agoeng Ajoe Made, Anak-Agoeng
Ajoe Neugah, Anak-Agoeng Ajoe Karang and Anak-Agoeng Ajoe Praha,
and two of his grand-daughters Anak-Agoeng Ajoe Poetoe and Anak
Agoeng Ajoe Mas.
Twelve men occupying the highest positions and fifty of the most
noted women died like heroes. In this they acted according to Balinese
?adat? and they claim our respect and admiration.
After the Madurese took the first line, a further advance was made
into the interior of the kampong; this movement produced a heavy
fire from the enemy, especially from the trees. Major Trackers, com-
manding the 6th battalion, was mortally wounded, the gray charger he
was riding serving unfortunately as an admirable target to the Balinese.
The young 2nd Lieutenant F. Franssen was badly wounded at the same
time, but in spite of the loss of blood, led his men to the end of the fight.
In view of this resolute opposition, the 11th battalion, who meanwhile
had made a breach in the north wall of the kampong and were within
170 yards of that face of the building, received orders to join the
left wing. The two battalions then advanced together and succeeded in
reaching a breach in the east wall of the kampong and had already
entered, when suddenly ?about 1 p.m. ?a most terrific explosion took
place in a powder magazine close by, presumably ignited by a Balinese
posted at the breach. Huge masses of earth, burning straw, pieces
of wood, heavy beams were flung up in the air and fell to the ground
in the midst of our men and the fire spread to various parts of the
kampong; a few minutes later a second explosion was heard and the
entire kampong was in a blaze. However, Lieutenants Ter Beek and
Wefers Bettink succeeded in leading their native (Javanese) soldiers ?all
of the 3rd company of the 11th battalion?straight into the middle of
the burning kampong, abandoned by the enemy. This company had
nothing more to fear from the Balinese, but, unfortunately, the 6th bat-
talion was unacquainted with their entry into the kampong and kept up their
fire in that direction, so that their comrades had some difficulty in protecting
themselves. When the Commander of the column was informed of the
state of affairs, he issued orders for a retreat, considering it inadvisable

to push further forward into the flames. This circumstance permitted

the latter to the mountain kampong of Awang Madia.
The troops ietui ned to Ampenan carrying the dead body of Major Trackers
and one soldiei killed and Lieutenant Transsen and 12 soldiers wounded
Great sorrow was felt at the death of Major Trackers, who by his calm
demeanour in battle, had won the confidence of all who served under
him and was highly esteemed by officers and men alike for his many
excellent qualities.
Ihe following day 23rd November? a reconnaissance was made from
the Tjakra cross-roads in a southerly direction towards Abean Toeboeh;
all the side roads east and west of the high road were thoroughly searched
without encountering the smallest display of hostility and the inhabitants
set to work willingly to break down the south wall of Tjakra.
On this day. a larger proportion of notable Balinese of rank came to
surrender than on any previous day and these included Ida K?Toet
U anasari, the head of the Brahmins at Tjakra.
On the same day another important event took place at Ampenan:
Controller Liefrinck informed the Prince by a written * communication
of the Commander-in-chief?s decision to send him to Batavia. However
distasteful this news might be, the prince had no choice but to submit.
Hie pi nice passed between a double line of soldiers from his tem-
porary dwelling to the shore; not a soul was visible; the soldiers were
confined to barracks; there were no salutes; the departure had been kept
secret and was hurried as much as possible to avoid any kind of demon-
stration. The Prince touched the soil of Salamparang for the last time
and carried away with him a few handfuls of sand, as a souvenir, to the
country to which the company were going to exile him!
He took his seat in the state barge of the which
was towed by the steam launch of the Tramp to the Brim Hendrik, the
man-of-war destined to carry to Batavia the Prince with his son'and
grandson taken prisoners on the 20th November, as also his grand
nephew who surrendered after the fall of Tjakra. Next to the state
barge, guarded by the sailors, was a boat of the Bali with a launch of
the Tromp, filled with poenggawas and followers. The steam pinnace
of the Maetsuycker had in tow a launch with followers of lower rank,
and was accompanied by an armed pinnace.
Controller Liefrinck went with the Prince on the Hendrik. A
few shrill whistles and the man-of-war left the harbour of Lombock
carrying into exile the last Rajah of the island.
On the 24th November many more notable chiefs surrendered and
on the 25th another member of the family was brought to Ampenan,
the rajah?s eight year old son: Anak-Agoeng K?Toet Oka, who lived
* This appears to have been the only way of communicating with him. Although the prince?s
mind was perfectly clear, he was too deaf to confer with verbally.


with his mother Duida Pateniah?a Sassak ?in the kampong of Soeka-
radja and whom one of the chiefs had induced to surrender. But Anak-
Agoeng Nengah Karang was still at Toh-pati.
The next day, 26th November, a column, composed of half a battalion
of infantry, one half troop of cavalry, one section mountain artillery
and one section of engineers commanded by General Segov, marched on
this place. Prom the cross-roads at Tjakra they proceeded northwards;
the 6th battalion took up position in the kampong of Teliwang, the
remainder of the troops in the sawah north of Toh-pati, where the
artillery set up their battery; the last summons to surrender remaining
unanswered, fire was opened on the residence of the members of the
prince?s family. Shortly afterwards a gate was opened on the west front
of Toh-pati; a few minutes later Anak-Agoeng Nengah Karang appeared,
carried in his chair by his followers and surrounded by a few others
who had. continued faithful to him.
Our troops directed a heavy fire towards the approaching group; struck
by many bullets, the prince died in his chair, his friends falling around
him, including men, women and one child!
The troops penetrated into the kampong and were received with a good
deal of opposition, but, after some steady fighting, the Balinese were
driven to flight; but many notable men and women were killed in this
last engagement.
On our side the casualties were: one soldier killed and five
wounded. KToet?s son, Anak-Agoeng G?de Rai, who had fled to the
mountains, was brought from his hiding place by two poenggawas and
taken to Ampenan on the 29th November and later to Batavia with
his wife, Ni Dami, his mother Djero Mimbar, and the Rajah?s young
son, Anak-Agoeng K?Toet Oka, with the boy?s mother, Adinda Patimah.
Meanwhile the old Prince had arrived at Batavia and, in spite of all
the measures taken by the Government to keep the arrival quiet, the
news had become known, and early on the morning of the 28th Novem-
ber, thousands of spectators gathered at Tandjong Priok to witness the
arrival. There was a great deal of activity on the man-of-war, where
the Resident and many other civil officials went on board to receive
the prisoners.
A section of marines were landed and a guard was placed along the
quay before the Rajah disembarked. He looked very old and a few
grey hairs showed themselves from beneath his head-covering, he wore
a yellow silk jacket and a short sarong. On his upper lip was a plaister
and his body was bandaged where he had been wounded while defending
the poeri.
Whilst he was being carried in his chair across the gangway, murmurs
were heard amongst the multitude, and here and there an oath, but there
was no disorder. The Rajah was followed by the crown prince and then
came the rest of the suite accompanied by the officials, causing consid-
erable surprise to the crowd.
A couple of carriages in the train had been reserved for the prison-


ers; looking up at this strange conveyance with a kind of childish
eai, epi nice w r as lifted up into it by his attendants, his wounds
imped mg his movements, and his son and grandson entered the same
compartment, as also Heer Liefrinck and various officials. The second
(?amage was for the suite and was accompanied by the sheriff.
Ihe tram left the station amid the shouts of the people and all
along the line there were crowds waiting to catch a glimpse of the
pusoners, they left the train at Koningsplein and the rest of the
journey was made in hired carriages and they were escorted to their final
destination by a detachment of cavalry in addition to various other
nu itaiy officials; a residence had been prepared for the princes at
Janah Abang under the direction of the sheriff. *
Meanwhile all the poenggawas, pedandas and the entire population
of Balinese at Lombock had surrendered; inspections were made every
daym the different districts: 27th?29th November Colonel Swart visited
\armada; JOth November General Segov marched to Lingsar; the Ist-
December an expedition went to Rembega and Gnnong Sari; there w T as
not a vestige of opposition anywhere; peace prevailed everywhere- the
lazaais were busily frequented as of old, and the people throughout
showed obedience and good will.
The time had now arrived when some attempt could be made to
introduce order into the disorganized state of the island The Com-
mander-in-chief was assisted by G.A. Scherer, director of Internal
Government, who had started once more for Lombock on the 17th No-
vember according to instructions from the Government, who knew that

order of the day after the fall of
Ijakra. All the Sassak chiefs were summoned to meet the Commander-
in-chief on the West coast for the purpose of holding a conference-
besides Mami Sapian, Goeroe Bangkok also chief of Praja, answered to
the summons, bringing with him this time the Balinese Prince Dafoe
Pangeran, who was at once?December 9th?shipped off on the
to Buitenzorg. Goeroe Bangkol had put forward as many difficulties
to the depaitme as he could; but he was given to understand that
the Governor General insisted upon it and he was bound to submit to
the inevitable, and thus another obstacle was removed from our path.
Various posts were already being dismantled and the time was ap-
proaching when the greater part of the troops could return home. Some
took their departure early in December, including the sth, 6th, 7th
and 9th battalions, the artillery, cavalry, engineers, departmental corps,
and auxiliaries not appointed for occupation of the island.
In the beginning of the work we spoke of the enthusiasm displayed
towards the departing soldiers, but it was insignificant in comparison to
Besides the prince, his son, grandson and nephew the other state prisoners at Janah
Abang were: the poenggawas Gusti Njoman Wanasara Jogok, Dewa G?de Pinatih Deddek
Gusti iNeugah Penida Dekdak, Gusti Wajan Jedoekh, four men and four women servants.
On the sth December the prince?s youngest son and his mother Dinda Patimah were also
conveyed here, and one male and one female servant.


the cordiality and excitement which prevailed on their return, we will
only mention one instance to show the frame of mind existing.
Gaily decorated with flags, the steamed into the harbour of
Tandjong Priok at 7 a.m. on the 10th December; a vast multitude
assembled to greet the home-coming troops and words fail to describe
the joy and happiness of the meeting after the long anxious period of
separation. There were of course many sore hearts and this day of
rejoicing was to many a day of sorrow and mourning, but outwardly
there was nothing to mar the universal gladness.
At Batavia, as well as at Noordwijk and Koningsplein where the
train halted, great crowds were gathered to welcome the newly arrived
troops and amongst the various military authorities was the Commander
of the army; at this point too the Governor-General and Mevrouw van
der Wijck and the Colonial Secretary had come to greet Major Scheuer
and his battalion.
No one present will ever forget the moment when the Governor
General stood in front of the colours in the centre of the battalion
drawn up in a square and addressed a few well chosen words to the
troops, congratulating them on the share they took in the work of con-
quest and referring sadly to those of their comrades who had died on
the battle-field; when amidst loud cheers Mevrouw van der Wijck
placed a wreath of flowers on their flag ?on that cherished flag that
they had carried high even in the days of disaster.
The troops filed past the national guard, the 10th battallion, the engi-
neers and the cavalry, from the Koningsplein to the esplanade of fort
Brins Hendrik.
At this stage the enthusiasm of the people reached its height;
two triumphal arch ways with the inscriptions; ?Honour to the fallen
Heroes,? and ?Welcome? testified to the feelings of the citizens, who
in spite of the heavy rain, had waited from early morning for the arrival
of the soldiers. Their approach was the signal for tremendous cheering
and their brave Commander was nearly covered by the flowers strewn
along his path and every one was anxious to be first to shake hands with
the heroes of Lombock. The enthusiasm was boundless and this was
but a precursor of similar scenes repeated at Batavia, Semarang and
Surabaya. In honouring these brave men we honoured the whole of
our Indian army.
By a Government resolution of 24th December 1894, the expedition
was broken up, and nearly all the troops not needed for garrison
purposes left the island within a few days. The mobilized Madurese
and the Madurese free coolies returned to their homes on the 27th
December and we hope that faithful Major Majang Koro will enjoy
the well-deserved repose he has earned by his unsparing devotion to
our cause.
The Commander-in-chief with his staff left at the close of the year,
reaching Batavia on the 2nd January; a magnificent ovation awaited
him and the public demonstration showed full appreciation of General


Vetters services; Ins health, however, necessitated his return to the
mother country and on the 13th he quitted the service on a retiring
pension and started for Holland. P
His retirement was not of long duration for on the 19th June he
was nominated Lieutenant-General, Commander of the army and head
of the war Department in the Dutch Indies in the place of Gey van
Pittius who had resigned on the 2nd of May.
Colonel Swart was left in command of the temporary occupation of
Lombock with the 2nd and 11th battalions and the necessary detach-
ments of the other branches of the service; the main body of infantry
was quartered at Ampenan, one company with a detachment of garrison
artillery occupied a fort, New-Mataram, built on the ground occupied
by the former Lalinese capital of that name; half a company of infantry
was divided between two block-houses; one half way between Ampenan
and Mataram, the other at the iron bridge across the river Djangkok.
Owing to the unhealthy condition of the troops at Ampenan, a semi-
permanent encampment was established at Kapitan at a higher and more
lealthy situation.
It was not only at Lombock that the troops suffered much from the
fatigues and privations they had experienced during the campaign. Many of
the European soldiers who had returned to Java carried with them the
germs of illness and more died from the effects of campaigning than
were actually killed in combat. *
Meanwhile two men-of-war and one of the transports remained in
Lombock waters to put a stop to the opium smuggling; besides seeing
to the conditions laid down for the import, export and transit trade
being carried out, part of their duty consisted in lending co-operation
if needed, to enforce the execution of the measures enacted.
After the departure of the Commander-in-chief the Resident with
his staff devoted all his energies to introducing regulations concerning
administration and justice amongst the natives and to restoring peace
and order amongst the inhabitants, especially trying to render life and
property safe. This was a very difficult task, the more so in the
Sassak territories where, owing to the long standing state of rebellion
and warfare, anarchy had become the order of the day and the few
remaining chiefs were contending among themselves for the upper hand.
Controller Engelenberg was especially appointed to supervise the East
coast and make the chiefs understand the real need of the new measures
for the restoration of law and order, and his instructions were most
stringent concerning the traffic in men and the old laws of vassalage.
The improvement of the roads and the irrigation system also claimed a
considerable share of his attention.
As long as no decision was arrived at regarding the future govern-
* Total of killed: 15 officers, 96 European, 34 Amboynese and 36 native soldiers, in all
175. Total wounded: 30 officers, 238 Europeans and 235 native soldiers, in all 503; of these
5 officers, 20 Europeans and 19 native soldiers died afterwards.
From an account in the ?Bat. Meuwshlad? 175 Europeans, 33 Amhoynese and 38 native
soldiers, in all 246 men, died from sickness, fatigue and exhaustion.


ment of the islands all the regulations bore only a provisional character,
but by the middle of the following year, 20th July, 1895, the vexed
question was finally settled by taking Lombock under our direct admi-
nistration. It now forms an assistant-residency under the Resident of
Bali and Lombock.
Whilst investigations were being made, as to at whose door lay the
blame for the attack of 25th ?26th August the previous year, the old
Rajah died at Batavia on 20th May.
Towards five o?clock in the afternoon of that day he felt ill and it
was decided to call in the doctor; the old prince went to bed and drew
a heavy sigh, attracting the attention of one of his suite. On reaching
the bed-side life was extinct; the Rajah had died painlessly of cessation
of the heart?s action. The union of the Atman and the body was ter-
minated and the calm features bore no traces of the sufferings this
once powerful prince had passed through.
In accordance with the Balinese custom the body was purified,
wrapped in linen and costly cloths, then placed in a coffin decorated
with linen and flowers, around which his followers watched and prayed
all night.
The funeral took place quietly the following morning, the hour pur-
posely being kept secret; the poenggawas carried the coffin to the
boundary of the homestead, whence the bier was carried by sixteen
natives to the burial ground at Karet; alongside the coffin walked two
attendants carrying umbrellas to protect the corpse from the rays of the
sun, as is customary amongst the Balinese. A small crowd of casual
passers-by on the road stared at the procession with curiosity, but
without having the least idea who was being conveyed to his last
resting-place. The coffin was lowered into a grave in an enclosed piece
of ground of the cemetery in the presence of the Resident, the assistant
resident and the sheriff. Such was the end of Lombock?s last prince!
Concerning the other members of the dynasty, three more of whom
had been despatched to Batavia in the middle of May, it was decided,
conformably to Article 47 of the administration laws, that they should
live elsewhere in Dutch India; in the interests of peace and order their
return to the island could not be permitted.
The same measure applied equally to Datoe Bangeran, there having
been abundant evidence to prove that he and his Balinese relatives took
part in the revolt against our government.
The greater part of the poenggawas and many of the prince?s fol-
lowers were allowed to return home after his death, some having
already gone in February.
To complete our subject it might have been advisable to discuss
further developments in Bali and to describe how the fall of the Bali-
nese princes in Lombock affected the sister island but space forbids us
to enter into any more details; we fear to have already somewhat tried
the patience of our readers.


Just one word about our friend Gusti Djilantik.
On the one hand, he has to contend with a very influential Balinese
party at Karang Assim hostile to us and who, during his absence, sent
an embassy to Bangli and Gianjar to incite rebellion and an attack on
the Distiict Boeleleng; a strong party who reproach him with the
death of Made and sympathy with our interests to the detriment of
the Balinese. . ..
On the othei hand he is threatened with his old enemy Karang
Assim, the Dew a Agong of Kloenkoeng, who asks for nothing better
than, with our help, to settle with him for good and all.
ihere he stands between two fires, his conduct towards us certainly
not having been strictly straightforward.
It is a difficult position for Djilantik, but at the same time, a source
of embarrassment to our Government and a successful solution of the
problem will call for great tact and prudence.
_ shortly aftei the revolt broke out, Djilantik had been arrested, as'
his behaviour towards General Van Ham and the Resident Dannenbargh
wan anted, we should have been in a position to place Karang Assim
under our direct control and further grounds were given for this by the
conspiracy of the Karang Assim party and the correspondence which
passed between Djilantik and our enemy Datoe Pangeran.
Djilantik s captuie could not have been effected without a struggle,,
but, with our strong triumphant forces and with the impression created
by oui victory, this could easily have been accomplished taking into
consideration the condition of Bali.
Howevei, this step was not taken and after a good deal of discussion,
our Government decided to leave Djilantik to govern Karang Assim
provisionally, as our representative.
Hie difficulties with which he is beset, the intense desire of our
Government to avoid every thing that may lead to disturbance at Karang
Assim, and the necessity of supporting Djilantik, to prevent his throwing
himself into the cause of the Karang Assim party- ?a 1 these things point
to a long continuance of the present state of affairs, but it is only a
temporary arrangement and we must never for a moment lose sight of
our political goal in Bali.
We have finished our task and no one more than the writer himself
is so fully aware of its many shortcomings.
The mam object of the book has been to endeavour to tell the truth
and we hope to have succeeded in giving a faithful picture of this
highly remarkable country and people, of their sufferings and of their
struggles, of the fall of their Prince and the way in which a newly
conquered province has been added to our magnificent possessions in
the East! We owe our best thanks to the hearty co-operation we have-
received from his Excellency, the colonial minister, Mr. J. H. Bergsma,
with whose permission we received valuable assistance from Heer Referen-
daris J.[J. Yichoff, chief of the third office of East India affairs in that


Department, and also to the many whose names have already been
mentioned and to many, whose names we are not at liberty to disclose.
It is difficult for an historian to abstain from criticism, but in seeking
to be as impartial as possible we have been happy to find more
occasions for praise than blame, with full appreciation for the manner
in which the expedition was prepared, carried out and brought to a
triumphant end. It has been an intense satisfaction to us to narrate the
deeds of loyalty, heroism and self-sacrifice of our Indian army and
thereby to save from oblivion the unimpeachable conduct of our brave
soldiers.
One last page remains to be added to our story, a glorious one.
It was the 6th July 1895 and a glorious summer?s day; the cloudless
blue sky seemed as if it were desirous to participate in the homage about
to be paid to our heroes; thousands of spectators had gathered to
witness the solemnity about to take place in the Malieveld; at noon loud
cheers announced the arrival of the two Queens, who with their presence,
were about to grace the touching ceremony. Tbe young Queen herself
was going to bestow the order ?For Valour, Prudence and Fidelity?
(Military Order of the Netherlands); from the Commander-in-chief down
to the soldier of lowest rank, every man presented himself before his
young Queen and she attached the ?order? to his breast, as it was
handed to her by Atchin?s old hero, General van der Heijden. *
It was a moment of solemn silence when the Queen-Regent stepped
forward and addressed the troops:
Officers, non-commissioned officers, corporals and soldiers!
/
?It was the Queen?s wish to present this mark of honour to those
who have fought for the maintenance of our power in our possessions
across the sea. From my heart I congratulate you all.
?You deserved this distinction when in troublous times you were
willing to sacrifice your lives for your Queen and your country and
thereby added a new and glorious page to the annals of the army and
the navy.
?I join with the Queen in honouring you all at this moment for the
magnificent proofs you have given in the conscientious fulfilment of your
duty, for your self-sacrifice and your fearlessness in the face of death.
?You may look back to those days of hardship with legitimate pride
and it is a privilege for me to thank both army and navy for their
services to the Queen and the Fatherland; and at the same time we
pay homage to the memory of those who fell in the struggle.
?Honoured be the men who met their death fighting for their country?s
honour. They cannot receive the reward for their courage, for, faithful
unto death, they have given up their lives. Officers, non-commissioned
officers and soldiers, tell your comrades in the Indies that both Queen
and people feel for them the highest admiration and gratefully acknow-
* At Batavia the presentations had been made on the 22nd June.


ledge that the Indian army fulfils its calling with honour. May success
cvei accompany your arms for the honour of our colonies and the
welfare of our country.?
Ihe moment is indelibly marked on the memory of all present when
the young Queen exclaimed:
Long live the Indian army. ? The deafening cheers, the ?Long live
the Queens, that rose spontaneously in response were an outlet for the
pent-up feelings of all; it was an unasked for, and therefore all the
moie L sinceie, oath of allegiance and loyalty to Netherlands? beloved
Misti ess. It was a fitting close to the Lombock Expedition!
