JUVENILE POEMS

1888




DEDICATION.
To MR. GEO. GUNTER, Senr.
My Dear Father,
As a mark of gratitude and love,
these Poems are dedicated to you, not as a compliment to you,
but to myself ; for I am conscious that they are so inferior as to
require to be thrown upon the shoulders of one who can support
so great a burden of faults, and one who, if alone in his opinion,
will not censure me. The Poems are published at the request,
and for the perusal, of my friends, and consequently dedicated to
you, my dearest friend. So, with no higher hopes of success than
that my friends will be pleased with these attempts,
Believe me to remain.
Your affectionate Son,
GEO. GUNTER.


PREFACE.
At the earnest request of many friends I have ultimately decided
to publish a small collection of Poems, and in doing so, though I
am by no means sanguine of success, I cannot avoid feeling a con-
siderable degree of solicitude regarding the fate of these
unpolished effusions of my, at present, inexperienced mind. It
may ameliorate these attempts, and also make their faults, of
which I know they possess many, more pardonable, to inform my
readers that none of these Poems have, without one exception,
received any previous study; in fact, this is truly an impromptu
volume. Solely for the perusal of my friends these Poems have
been published, and from them alone I ask pardon ; and if these
few lines will preserve me from censure, I will be satisfied and
grateful, despising the criticisms of others : for
“ Their warmest plaudits I would scarcely prize,
Their sneers and censures I alike despise. ”
Yours faithfully,
GEORGE GUNTER.
May, 1887.


Juvenile Poems.
THE STORM.
Tiie fishing boat upon the wave
Is tossing to and fro ;
The heav’ns above are dark with clouds,
And fierce the west-winds blow.
The lightnings flash across the heav’ns,
The thunder peal is heard,
As tho’ the wrath of Providence
Had by man’s sin been stirred.
Across the angry foaming deep
The lightning’s flash is seen,
Revealing but the snowy crests
That bound each wave-ravine.
But still the fisherman cares not,
His heart is light and brave,
He thinks his life pure freedom,
When tossing on the wave.
No thoughts of self come to his mind,
No thoughts of fear molest
The heart that stoutly beats within
His manly love-warmed breast.
His mind is ever on his wife ;
Tho’ loud the waters moan,
So true his love is that he lives
For her —and her alone.
A better husband never lived,
So loving, true, and kind,
His wife is in each passing thought
That crowds into his mind.
So much he loves his wife at home,
So faithful, loving, fair,
There’s not a pulse within his frame
That beats not true to her.


JUVENILE POEMS.
The storm still rages, hut the boat
Still lifts above the waves,
And waters gaping seem to show
Dark, dismal, wat’ry graves.
And down the rain in deluge streams
Upon both land and sea,
As though all heaven’s fountains had
Been suddenly set free.
And lo ! a sound now meets his ear
It is the breakers’ roar ;
Above the storm he hears the roll
Of waves upon the shore.
And easily could now be seen,
By heav’n’s electric light,
The face that was unchanged before,
Now turned to deadly white.
Now quick he brings the boat about,
Now strains the sturdy oar,
And strives to pull his little craft
Back from the dangerous shore.
“ How is’t,” he cried in blank despair,
“ That light I cannot see ?
The course I steered I know is right
Lost, lost I soon shall be.
“ If shining from the window pane
The little lamp shone forth,
I could have scorned the raging night
That poureth out his wrath.
But now, alas ! 1 fear I’m lost —
Lost, wrecked upon the beach ,
I cannot pull against this tide,
And help is out of reach.
“ Oh ! Emma, why so careless thou
When on my life it hung?
Who shall console thee when the waves
My funeral dirge have sung 1
Oh ! why did you not light the lamp,
As I on leaving said 1
Alas ! I shall be drowned to sleep,
Rocked in a wat’ry bed..


THE STORM.
“ Oh ! hear’st thou not the raging storm 1 —
Still, still I drift ashore;
Farewell, farewell, my Emma dear,
I ne’er shall see thee more.
And still may God protect you well
When I am dead and gone,
Though I would still protect you, if
The little lamp had shone.”
Ah ! little knew he why the lamp
Had not been lit that night,
Or rather, why its cheering rays
Met not his longing sight.
But still he blamed not, but he blest—
Would all might do the same,
For seldom we for certain know
The one whom we should blame.
But faithful, true, his wife had been
Her charge well she had kept,
And thro’ the long and dreary night
She prayed for him and wept.
But sickness did that day befal
His darling wife at home,
And still she lit the little lamp
To guide him o’er the foam.
And in the window placed it, so
That he could see its ray,
For, from the seat he would return,
Long after close of day.
And to her bed she quickly went,
Disrobed, and then she lay
Upon her bed, and prayed, for she
Could not kneel down to pray.
And oft her prayer repeated,
She slept, but did not rest,
For evil dreams, foreboding ill,
Kept rising in her breast.
Night fell, and with it rose the storm,
She heard it as she lay,
But from her bed she could not rise,
She could do nought, but pray.


JUVENILE POEMS.
But this she did most earnestly,
And sank once more to sleep,
And with it dreamed, ill-omens came
Of him upon the deep.
And half asleep, and half awake,
She saw a vision glad—
Her husband stood beside her bed,
In seaman’s clothing clad.
Up from her bed she jumped in joy
His toil-worn hand to clasp,
T'o kiss him—but what is the cause
Of that deep painful gasp !
Ah, yes ! too true, he was not there,
A vision ’twas she saw,
But little dreamed now yet that he
Would never see her more.
Nought cpuld she see, nought could she hear,
But thunder, wind, and rain ;
She thought to hear her husband s tread,
But listened still in vain.
Then drawing round her shoulders tigh
A shawl to keep her warm,
She went outside to wait for him,
She did not mind the storm.
But now, alas ! the reason clear
Dawned on her startled brain —
Tho’ she had lit the little lamp,
To <uiide him o’er the main,
The storm had broke the window'-pane
While she, ill-dreaming, slept,
The wind had blown it out, and now
She wrung her hands and wept.
And rushing forth into the night,
She called her husband’s name, w
“ Oh ! William, William, do come home .
Nought but an echo came.
She called once more and louder still,
She shrieked for him again ;
The storm still howled, and drowned her voice,
And she called but in vain.


THE STORM.
Then as she listened for a sound,
And held her trembling breath,
(She little knew her husband was
Fast drifting to his death),
A heart-appalling crash she heard
Above the water’s moan,
And mingling with the howling storm,
A crash, and now a groan.
To God she raised a fervent prayer
Beside that surging sea,
Saying, Heav’nly lather, take me too,
Or bring him back to me.”
With hands and face uplifted, see
She prays, but not aloud,
And now a moonbeam came from out
A slightly parted cloud.
And now she calls to God again,
Now for her husband calls ;
Her name upon an echo borne
Upon her ear now falls.
And on the heaving wave she sees
A figure rise and fall,
And once more hears her whisper’d name
It is her husband’s call.
Yet none but her could hear that voice,
And once again it came,
“ Oh ! Emma dear, my own, good bye
His dying words her name j
For, drifting to a craggy rock,
His boat was crushed, and he,
All bruises, pains, and hurts was left
Upon an angry sea.
Yes, in his parting breath he gasped
Her cherished name once more,
Then, senseless, drifted on the wave
Toward the lashing shore.
And picture, too, his wife s dismay,
Her anguish, grief, and pain ;
The limbs and lips were motionless—
To move but once again.


JUVENILE POEMS.
Now drifted by the waves ashore
Upon the beach he lay ;
His wife is there, and from his lips
She kisses off the spray,
And begs of him to speak to her—
A smile plays o’er his lips,
As from their ghastly form the wave
Slowly, retreating, drips.
But there he lies, unconscious still,
Upon the verge of death,
And once more whispered “ Emma,” but
It was his parting breath.
She kisses him again, and lifts
The now still, silent head ;
But soon does she discover that
His manly spirit’s fled.
Dead ! dead ! upon the dusky beach—
Dead ! in his loved wife’s arms ;
The lips are ever motionless
That once so praised her charms.
Once more she breathed a prayer to God,
But only sobs were heard,
Aud looking up to ITeav’n, she prayed
In thought, but not in word.
Her hands above her breasts were clasped,
As though she breathed a prayer
That God would take her as He had
Her husband near her there.
Then, looking at her husband’s form,
She tried to speak in vain,
For fainting by his side she fell
With one loud shriek of pain.
And there until the morning’s light
The two lay side by side,
So faithful that in love they lived,
And in that love they died.
And God her prayer had granted,
She’d gone with him to dwell,
To live once more, as she had lived,
With one she loved so well.


THE STORM.
And in the morning they were found
Locked in a fond embrace,
Her head upon his manly breast,
A smile in each pale face.
Thus died they, and were buried,
As tho’ they’d but one breath—
They who refused to part in life
Were parted not in death.
Since, from the little window-pane,
The lamp has never shone,
But still is left in memory
Of near ones that are gone.
And oft in stormy weather, when
The wind is blowing high,
The fisher tells this story sad,
And ends it with a sigh.
And when around the winter’s fire
His family all chat,
When in its warmth and cheery glow
Soft sings and purrs the cat;
When girls are sewing, mothers too,
And lads at some pursuit;
When loud the storm is howling, and
The voice of all is mute;
When ’tis the time for telling tales,
When true ones they would hear,
When stories in the fisher’s cot
Would bring them better cheer;
When tales of ghosts and giants fail
To please the mipds of all ;
When tales of fights and battles
Will not the mind enthral;
When sons are eager for a tale,
When daughters ask one too,
The mother asks the father, please,
To tell them one that’s true—
How pleased the father is to tell
The story I relate ;
With tears his wife and children
List to their dismal fate.


JUVENILE POEMS.
And on Sunday evenings, when
The wife’s short work is done;
When children walk, and thus enjoy
The warm and pleasant sun —
The cottage on the rock they view,
The lamp and broken pane,
They think of the sad story,
And they tell it once again.

LINES
Written in commemoration of the 25th September, 1886.
How time flies with merry swiftness,
Winged on manhood’s happy hours,
As the parrot, clothed with gayness,
Leaves in spring its woodland bowers.
So my mind, this hour reverting,
Chases gloom and cares away,
In the happiness of lifetime
That my mind re-calls to-day.
Years have passed as years will ever,
Time its course has swiftly run ;
Every evening ends in twilight,
Every morning brings the sun.
So, our lives in daily labour,
Sorrow sometimes dims the eyes,
But remember, that to-morrow
Suns of pleasure will arise.
Listen then, my merry children ;
Annie, sit close by my side,
While we talk about the spring-time
When I claimed you as my bride.
Spring as now, was in its fulness,
Parrots mated in the trees,
Flowers, and early fruits in clusters,
Waver’d in the evening breeze.


COMMEMORATION LINES.
When thy cheek with youthful freshness
Vied the colour of the rose ;
When thy brow was soft and whiter
Than the fairest lily blows ;
When 1 praised thy raven tresses,
Now like mine, with silver laid;
When I pressed thy hand in fondness—
Fondness that can never fade.
When I pledged, in fond emotion,
All my love in fondest vow;
When I vowed to love you ever—
I would pledge it once more now;
When you vowed your fond affection,
And I sealed it with a kiss;
When the future smiled around me,
And I dreamed of future bliss.
Then, ’twas then, oh ! welcome spring-time,
Annie that should cheer thy heart ;
Joined were we, for e’er united,
Until death should bid us part.
Bid us part —I dread that moment;
God alone could make me bear,
Or endure the patience needed,
Until I should meet thee there.
And should life’s long sultry summer
Scorch the verdure of my years,
Disunited —here to linger,
God alone could dry thy tears.
But such time must come, and will come,
And tho’ it should rend the heart,
We may cherish still, as certain
We shall meet, no more to part.
Whilst we live, let us be happy,
Joy should fill each fleeting year,
Not a page be dim and blotted,
With thy tender, trickling tear.
Let us not recall a sorrow
Of the dim and distant past,
When our hearts were sorrow-saddened—
Time has flown, nor flown too fast.


JUVENILE POEMS.
I’d not wish those dear departed,
From their perfect bliss on high,
To these realms of sin and sorrow,
Doomed for ever here to sigh.
’Tis a pleasure, tho’ the parting
Caused us unremitting pain,
That angelic sons and daughters
In a Saviour’s love remain.
Pass we on ; let nought but pleasure
Carefully our thoughts confine ;
Let our minds review together
Over twenty years of time.
Turn and contemplate with gladness,
Turn with joy, as well we may,
To the day that we were wedded,
Twenty years ago to-day.
Time has passed, as passes cloudlets
When before a winter’s wind,
As I view the various changes
In this ref’rence of the mind.
Twenty years has brought us treasures
That are never found to roam,
Loving children, smiling faces,
Treasures in the sphere of home.
There is, first, our cherished first-born,
George, admired by friends and foes ;
Look on him with fond affection,
How our memory sweetly throws
To the time he was an infant,
Nineteen years or nearly so—
He was not our earthly treasure,
Annie, twenty years ago.
Now in manhood’s ways he labours,
Quite a man except in age ;
But we’ll not proclaim his virtues,
Turn we then another page.
He the poet we admire,
Be his talents even so ;
We had not a bard to cheer us
This day twenty years ago.


COMMEMORATION LINES.
Turn again, his sister Annie
Charms the parent’s loving eyes •
She has all her many virtues,
, If she be not quite as wise.
Now she is a perfect woman,
Lovely as e’er Nature formed—
Unto us who so admire
Virtue’s beauty, unadorned.
In her face descry thine image,
As I first beheld thy face,
In her mild and girlish manner
All the former beauty trace.
And remember at this moment,
Ere we further onward go,
That her merry songs and music
Cheered not, twenty years ago.
Then there’s Willie, Sam, and Edgar,
And there is the babe Le Roy,
Who, so fond of infant beauty,
Could have wished a finer boy.
Sam and Willie, see them singing,
In the pretty village choir,
And hearken Edgar’s merry laugh,
With his spirits somewhat higher.
And Le Roy, our latest treasure,
With his sweet and winning ways,
Brightens all the home around him,
With the mirth his joy conveys.
Let us at this time remember,
As the hours sweetly flow,
That these other little jewels,
Shone not, twenty years ago.
Twenty years to-day have flown,
Scarcely noted in their flight,
Leaving treasures in their course,
That we have reviewed to night.
Merry children, smiling faces,
Loving hearts as ever beat,
And we two are still together,
Happiness is then complete.


JUVENILE POEMS.
May never grief or sorrow,
Become our lot to bear,
For we have conquered trouble,
When such has been our share.
But now may every pleasure
Our very lives instil,
And if God send us sorrow,
Resign us to his will.
Yet our life has been a pleasure,
Mine has been since by your side,
Every roughness has been smootliened
Since I claimed you as my bride.
Turn then, contemplate with gladness,
Turn with joy, as well we may,
To the day that we were wedded,
Twenty years ago to-day.
FAREWELL.
Farewell, and if my fondest prayer
Can make thy slumbers light,
Be paradise thy daily share,
And dreams of Heaven, thy night.
But if that fervent prayer of mine
Should be of lesser worth,
God make thy home, from time to time,
A heaven upon earth.


THE SEA.
“THE SEA.”
To the shore there comes a moaning,
Comes a deep and hollow moaning,
Yet no human voices owning,
With their echoes long and free;
But it has a heavy murmur,
Has a long and heavy murmur,
Sometimes weaker, sometimes firmer,
Comes the moaning of the sea.
On the shore ’tis always swelling,
Always rising, always swelling,
While its hollow moans are telling
Horrors of the past to me ;
Scenes of wreckage, scenes of plunder,
Of the savage merman’s plunder,
Rising like the distant thunder,
On these moanings of the sea.
Here I love to walk and ponder,
Love to listen and to ponder,
While upon the beach I wander,
Heavy hearted as can be ;
For some horrid shriek is welling,
From the billows crest is welling,
And some fearful tale is telling,
Of the dark and murky sea.
Now the murmur grows still nearer,
Grows far plainer, and still nearer,
And the murmur grows much clearer,
From the ocean unto me;
Then at length some form discerning,
Many forms and sounds discerning,
All my mind is deeply burning,
With the horrors of the sea.
Still the moanings grow more horrid,
Grow still nearer, and more horrid,
And my fever’d brain more torrid,
As these ghastly forms I see ;
Cries arise which tell distresses,
And the gloom, my heart depresses
With the horrors of the sea.


JUVENILE POEMS.
See ! a vessel, shattered, sinking,
Terror-stricken people sinking,
Wailing, and of future thinking,—
Rise these cries of woe to me;
“ Help !” hark ! cries for help are rising,
Shrieks to Heaven for help still rising,
Prayers for help (their lives now prizing),
From these horrors of the sea.
Dries still rise in wild confusion,
Moans and shrieks in wild confusion,
Earnest prayers in great profusion,
Rise upon these moans to me.
“ Oh ! my child ! Oh ! Father spare him,
Take me Father, and but spare him,
Hear my prayer, Oh, God ! and tear him
From the horrors of the sea.”
Shrieks my startled ear are shaking,
Children’s cries my heart are breaking,
And amid the waters breaking,
Rise these tales of woe to me;
Sharks with frightful jaws devouring,
Hungry sharks their prey devouring,
Now my heart is overpowering
In these horrors of the sea.
Lo ! I see a figure moving,
On the foaming billows moving,
With strong heart his powers proving,
Striving bravely on to me.
But I see his arm is tiring,
With the labour now is tiring,
And, Oh, God ! he is expiring
In the horrors of the sea.
Once again the sea is moaning,
With a distant kind of moaning,
In a solemn way intoning
Murmurings that had come to me ;
And the waves are darkly rolling,
Inky waves are darkly rolling,
For departed, bells seem tolling
In the horrors of the sea.


THE SEA.
Now from out the breakers welling,
From the roaring breakers welling,
Sounds of mirth are gently swelling,
Joyful, too, as they can be ;
They are mermaids sweetly singing,
With the mermen sweetly singing,
While some jewels they are bringing
From the horrors of the sea.
From the wreck they gather treasures,
Gather many valued treasures,
And the music of their pleasures,
Fill the moans that come to me ;
List! the mermaid now rejoices,
Over jewels she rejoices,
And together swell their voices
From the horrors of the sea.
Lo! I see a woman standing,
On the cliff a woman standing,
With a fixed eye and commanding,
Looking piercingly at me ;
Now she raised her eyes to heaven,
Praying with her eyes to heaven.
Rest to her would soon be given
In the horrors of the sea.”
From that dangerous height and lonely,
From the cliff so dark and lonely,
From the lips of madness only,
Came these words distinct to me :
“ Heav’nly Father, Oh ! forgive me,
In thy mercy, Oh ! forgive me,
Rest I pray you now to give me
In the horrors of the sea.
Now her arms are firmly folding,
O’er her breasts are firmly folding,
And intent, my breath am holding,
For the fate that is to be.
Now she leaps ’twixt wave and heaven,
Now descends ’twixt wave and heaven,
From the earth for rest is driven
To the horrors of the sea.


JUVENILE POEMS.
But a splash, and all is over,
All the maddened life is over,
. And the waves will roughly hover,
And return a moan to me ;
And amid the hollow rolling,
’Mid the waves so darkly rolling,
Now there swells a distant tolling,
From the horrors of the sea.
Thus from out the billows swelling,
From the foaming billows swelling,
Comes a solemn murmur telling,
Of its constant woes to me;
And this ever constant moaning,
Ever moaning, moaning, moaning,
Is an awful dreadful groaning,
From the horrors of the sea.

BEAUTY.
Ye bards of old, who smote the tuneful lyre
To gods of war, of beauty and of fire,
Whose stirring words inspire the young and old,
To thoughts of daring, and to deeds as bold,
Inspire my muse with true unerring song,
To view the beauty of the female throng.
What varied faces meet the searching eye,
In all the changes of a changeful sky.
Long sought in vain, at length my lot to view,
One female form to Nature’s model true ;
Then let the Muse with ample justice tell,
The beauty of a maiden formed so well,
Describe the charms proud Nature once revealed,
For ages past, for ages long concealed.
’Tisas a dream, that Nature’s voice I heard,
And deeply wondering treasured every word.
There as I mused (upon a rock I lay,
Where trees obscured the ardent orb of day),


BEAUTY.
The voice of Nature came, not harsh and rude,
But mild and gentle in a tone subdued,
A veil of myst’ry that o’erhung my eyes,
Was by the voice of Nature bade arise—
When lo ! before me on a mossy green,
’Neath which a sparkling rivulet was seen, '
A lovely maiden, nude, but perfect lay,
And warmed her calmly in a genial ray.
I sought the reason of this vision fair,
So sweetly formed, so exquisitely rare,
When Nature proudly, but unfeigned replied,
“ This lovely maiden will be no man’s bride.
This perfect form that thus has charmed thine eye,
Long since was formed beyond yon azure sky ;
One perfect model, one alone was mine,
Wherewith to form so true a form and fine,
But such my lot when from the mould she woke,
The die that formed her, dread misfortune! broke.
Since then till now for many ages past,
In vain to equal her the form is cast,
And may that form, her beauty e’er retain,
For Nature strives to equal her in vain.”
The voice had ceased.— But still in gilded ray,
The beauteous figure, there reclining lay.
To here pourtray, the pen would justly scorn,
Did not her beauty, beauty’s self adorn,
For Muse would fail inspired with passion warm
To picture true this lovely sylph-like form.
There hung her hair, her raven locks and long,
There shone her eyes, her deep dark eyes and strong,
There sweet composed her limbs so neat and fair,
Among a bed of violets, blushing there.
How sweet her breasts, ‘ her gently budding breasts,’
So chaste, the flowers seemed unwelcome guests.
There were her lips, the breeze scarce dared caress,
That blushing roses tinted with a press.
They seemed to move—l heard a sweet refrain,
And rapturous listened to the following strain: —
The pride of the earth is not wisdom and worth,
But beauty’s quick fading career,
W hat would they resign for such beauty as mine,
While I, it regret with a tear ?


JUVENILE POEMS. .
The charms of the face with this vain foolish race,
Are all that enrapture the eye,
While thus I am left of a loved one bereft,
And doomed in my beauty to sigh.
I boast all the charms that excite the alarms
Of Cupid’s deep, passionate dart,
And yet would I yield all this power I wield
For one dear affectionate heart.
But Nature’s decree so regretful to me,
Betrothes me as solitude’s bride,
Unknown is my home, and there no one can come,
Where beauty and sorrow reside.
The vision faded like the dew of morn,
Beauty had vanished and her beauteous form,
Long shall the mind the image sweet retain,
Of beauty perfect, long sought for in vain.
TO LE ROY.
Twelve months ago we hailed thy birth,
Twelve months thy smiles have blessed,
Twelve months ago thou earnest to earth,
Twelve months by all caressed.
How pleased were all to praise thy face,
Ere God had ope’d thine eyes,
And then at length how praised their grace,
More blue than heaven’s skies.
When earthly pains would rack thy neryes,
And mother kissed thy brow,
Thy pleasing smile, then plainly serves
Thy thankfulness to show.


TO A DOG.
How oft we watched thy slumbers light.
And prayed for thee the while,
Then thou would’st ope thine eyes so bright,
And give each one a smile.
How oft dear mother spoke to you,
That you might learn to talk,
And tried how hard to teach you too
That you might learn to walk.
And oh ! how pleased was she when first
You said some simple word,
And what a load of praise did burst
From hearts that thus were stirr’d.
And when “ Mamma ” you first would say,
To high delight of all,
Your mother taught you day by day
Your father’s name to call.
His name now swells thy pretty voice,
And to him love you show,
I scarcely think you make a choice,
Because you love them so.
When twelve months more have past with fate,
Fate fraught with fun and joy,
We hope once more to celebrate
The birthday of our Roy.
TO A DOG.
Poor luckless dog, we here thy loss deplore,
Could pity call thee back, we’d pity more.
In vain our grief, remorse alike how vain,
To add to all our woes and sorrows, pain.
No more shall you, at Rosebrook, hunting there,


JUVENILE POEMS.
Pounce without warning on a sieeping hare,
No more the sound of guns delight thy ear,
No timid hare thy tracking scent wdl fear
No more the yelping mongrel in the street
At thy harsh bark will make a fast retreat
For thou art gone, whose virtues will appear
When hares a“re sought, and thou no longer here.
Poor luckless dog, we pity thee who can
Thou too hast shared unwarned, the lot of ma
The lot of man when doomed to doctor s ski ,
thVcrTmef Proidmtister of death,
Heardst thou the yell, that filled his ;
Watched thou Ins eye m wild expirin & »-■ »
And feared not then to see him in thy dreams.
To see the blood pour from his wounded side,
Who in the cause of honor fought, and died l
Avaunt! vain quack. Hast thou a soul to save,
And see a brute in his life’s fluid lave,
And by thy hand f Were his a crime indeed ?
Then yours in justice is the darker deed.
To stop oppression of a weaker kind,
Was that the object of thy generous mind,
To show the public thy assassin s art,,
To plunge the lance in helpless Carlo s heart,
To use oppression in thy wounded pride
That same dread crime, for which poor Carlo died.
Poor faithful dog, revenge must be unheard.
And satire’s song, must plead thy cause preferred.
Profession’s stamp, will aid thy murderer s cause,
And prowling friends will render their applause.
Thy worth I know, but theirs I value not,
Thy value perished but is neer forgot. ,
Thou hadst few friends ; but sleep beneath the shade,
While doctor slashes still, the dagger blade.
Round him will friends, their daily smiles renew,
Because such men of breeding here, are few ,
But if I judge him by his dismal heart
Of which thy death was but a real part,
It seems to me, to glance some few years back,
He wed a white, that should have been a black.


. “WHERE DO BRITISH HEROES SLEEP?”
“WHERE DO BRITISH HEROES SLEEP?”
Where do British Heroes sleep,
In their robes of honor drest ?
What poor helpless orphan’s weep
Round their honoured place of rest 1
Know’st thou not our nation’s name
Owes its glory to their death,
That her dear undying fame
Proudly swells their parting breath 1
Go where waves Atlantic roar
O’er a vast unfathomed deep,
Where fierce breakers lash the shore—
There our British heroes sleep.
There no widow’s wail is heard,
There no stricken orphans mourn,
There no praise-containing word
Is on marble column borne.
Go across the desert lands
Where the wild hyenas creep,
Over battle’s blood-red sands—
There our British heroes sleep.
There no marble marks the spot
Where our heroes rest in death ;
Whitened bones—a mingled lot—
Show us where they yield their breath.
Look where Belgium’s sons of toil
Go, their crops of grain to reap ;
Look o’er Spain’s rich golden soil—
There our British heroes sleep.
There no friends surround the grave
Where our heroes rest in peace;
Foes now view where still the brave
From their gloried labours cease.


JUVENILE POEMS.
France, thy soil has been enriched
By the blood our heroes shed,
Led by one they deemed bewitched —
Where, then, is our heroes’ bed 1
On Corunna’s battle plain,
’Neath Trafalgar’s stormy deep,
Waterloo’s proud fields of fame—
There our British heroes sleep.
Some more favoured in their death,
Having in the scene of war
Yielded their inspiring breath,
Rest on England’s happy shore.
Vict’ry crowned their latest breath
On the plain or on the deep;
England boasts their pride in death—
Where our dauntless heroes sleep.
AUSTRALIA.
Australia, dear land of the brave and the free,
Whose Hag never bends o’er the slave,
Whose fame has extended o’er desert and sea,
Whose pride o’er the treacherous wave.
Should nations invade us, our numbers, tho’ small,
How great in our courage we’d stand ;
We’d fear not tho foe should invasion befal,
But die in defence of our land.
Then stand side by side, in national pride,
Proud sons of Old England are we;
We cherish her name, her far-echoed fame,
The home of the brave and the free.
Australia, the pride of thy sons on the wave,
Our boast is our dear native home ;
Thy sons of the soil will be loyal and brave
If daring invader should come.


A ROMANCE.
Old England rejoices our courage to see, ,
Her assistance is always at hand;
For we will not fear who are loyal and free,
To die in defence of our land.
Then stand side by side in national pride,
Proud sons of Old England are we ;
We cherish her name, her far-echoed fame,
The home of the brave and the free,
If foes dear Australia should cross o’er the wave,
Where England our freedom has won,
We’ll tight like our sires, the glorious brave,
Whose race of existence is run ;
The daring invader a cold dismal grave
Will find at the patriot’s hand;
For we will not fear, who are sons of the brave,
To die in defence of our land.
Then stand side by side, in national pride,
Proud sons of Old England are we ;
We cherish her name, her far-echoed fame,
The home of the brave and the free.
A ROMANCE.
Sweetly the moon with her pale silv’ry beams,
Thro’ the pine-boughs pours her delicate gleams;
Softly is whispered some passionate word,
Deeply a heart by that whisper is stirred,
Fondly by someone that whisper is heard,
Loving and true.
Doubtful, yet hoping these sweet words were true,
Trusting the future her dreams would renew,
Calmly she smiled with a tear in her eye,
Lightly there rose from his bosom a sigh,
Vowing, he whispered, “I’ll love till 1 die
No one but you.”


JUVENILE POEMS.
Deeply his words in her fond bosom grew,
Doubting lest they were too good to be true;
Silence now reigned in the growing delight,
Silence gave dreams of a future so bright,
Tranquil as air in the region of night,
Tranquil and free.
Breathless, as hourly waiting some dread,
Silence repeated the words that were said
Only the beating of hearts on the aii,
Breaking the stillness of happiness there,
Fondly encircling the loving and fair,
Lovely to see.
Bolder at length by success was he grown,
Shadows of failure completely had flown ;
“ Doubt not,” he whispered, “ nor say ’tis an art,
“ That pleads for the love those orbs can impart,
“ Deeply these words are engraved on my heart,
“ Ever thine own.
“ Then will I doubt not,” the fair one replied,
“ Make me for ever thy dear chosen bride,
“ Show still the love thou for ever hast shown,
“Then when the years of our beauty have Hown,
“ Still may I claim you, though grey-headed grown,
“ Ever mine own.”
Fondly his arm round that fair form was clasped,
Fondly as tho’ that embrace was the last;
Starting—what sound is thus forced on the ear,
Filling the eyes and the heart with a fear 1
Only her pa, with a savage dog near,
Savage and glad.
Sweetly the moon with her pale silv’ry beams,
Through the pine-boughs pours her delicate gleams.
Where is the trace of their whispering now 1
Silence repeats not the much-treasured vow—
Why did he leave in a hurry and how
Painful and sad ?


REPOSE.
REPOSE.
When day is over, with its toil,
Then men who dig and plough the soil
Can take a well-earned rest;
And quite the same with one of those
Who weary over writing grows,
He takes a sweet repose.
And so with those who work at all,
Whether with pen or heavy mall,
They can in sleep invest;
When heat or labour indispose,
He, when his eyelids gently close,
Will take a sweet repose.
And thus will all who work or play,
When tired out by length of day,
They find that sleep is best ;
The weary wife who sits and sews,
The weary belles, the weary beaux,
Can take a sweet repose.
And when the morning comes again,
With busy hands and busy brain,
By languor unpossessed ;
Thus happy, off to work he goes,
For he, by being one of those,
Can take a sweet repose.
He sleeps and dreams of rod or gun,
His dreams are always full of fun,
He is of care divest;
Thrice happy if he’s one of those
Who own all friends, for seldom foes
Can take a sweet repose.
Not so with him of evil mind,
Whose every action is unkind,
Whom everyone detest;
When wearied out at length he grows,
He then by reaping what he sows
Takes not a sweet repose.


JUVENILE POEMS.
Or he with burglaring intent,
When outward-bound, whose mind is bent
On plundering a money chest;
When Sol his light of morning throws,
He, fearing then his many foes,
Takes not a sweet repose.
And likewise he, who shut in gaol,
Refused dismissal or e’en bail,
Being the people’s pest;
His mind is full of serious woes,
And tho’ he wished to sleep or doze,
Takes not a sweet repose.
And, worst of all, the murderer’s sleep,
Who from his ghastly dreams doth leap,
By demons now possessed ;
And lest he’s found by one of those
Who seek to find out where he goes,
Takes not a sweet repose.
Ghosts round his weary head doth rise,
And seek his terror-stricken eyes,
Soon as his couch is pressed ;
At length he dies, let us suppose,
He, just the same, where’er he goes,
Takes not a sweet repose.


WHEN MILD HOURS.
LOVE LYRICS.
WHEN MILD HOURS.
TO M. J. J. G.
When mild hours of leisure my happiness reckon,
When thoughts dear to mem’ry for ever appear,
Through the gloom of the distance thy hand seems to beckon,
And mem’ry soft whispers my darling is near.
Yes, near unto mind, though by distance long parted,
As dear as when lips are still meeting in bliss ;
Who know its deep rapture ? Ah, ask the true-hearted,
For who would not die, with his darling sweet kiss.
But farewell, my darling, farewell till I meet you,
Your mem’ry must rise unrestrained to my heart ;
Farewell till the time when at length will I greet you,
To love you for ever, but no, never to part.
THE LOVER’S OFFERING.
Since riches here are not niv part,
Nor gems nor emeralds mine,
I have alone a constant heart,
And that, my love, is thine.
This off’ring, then, I’ll make to thee,
Undecked by useless art;
So let thy dearest treasure be
My fond and faithful heart.


JUVENILE POEMS.
MY DREAM OF LOVE.
TO M. J. J. G.
I had a dream, a vision sweet,
When night and dew of morning meet
With twinkling stars above ;
I dreamt that we stood side by side,
I dreamt I claimed you as my bride
In never-ceasing love.
I saw thy beauteous blush and smiled,
By dreaming eyes and hopes beguiled,
Upon my treasure rave ;
Thy form tilled me with fond delight,
Thy veiled face and robes of white
Were never seen so fair.
X wo ke —my dream of bliss was o’er,
And thou wert in my sight no more,
But shall be by-and-bye ;
Or else from pride, my vows deride
Ne’er by my side, my treasured bride,
I’ll mourn for thee and die.
PARTING.
TO M. J. .T. G.
We met, and we parted, in pleasure, in pain,
When near thee how quickly time ned ;
The hours than moments no longer remain,
A word-sigh, a kiss, and ’tis sped.
’Tis sad that the hours of pleasure should move
To pain unconceivably fastj
That hours are moments when lightened by love
A moment of bliss—and tis past.


THE ROSES.
Those moments of pleasure I ever shall prize,
None treasured in mem’ry so dear
Than when in the depth of thy lovely dark eyes
I read that thy love was sincere.
Yes, darling, thy glance, so calmly possessed,
At parting deep mingled with pain,
But urged me to clasp thee at once to my breast,
And never to leave thee again.
Tho’ still we shall meet, and still we must part,
Yet neither can cease to adore;
And oh ! the sweet raptures that time shall impart,
I meet thee, to part nevermore.
And while hours fly to that moment of time,
Whose raptures I will not foretell,
I shall for the present abandon this rhyme,
And wish you, my darling, farewell.
THE ROSES.
TO M. J. J. G.
Come, inspire my muse, sweet heavenly dews,
Come, make it expressive of love ;
Inspiration so lent, prize the flow’rets she sent,
The bard’s kindling passion to prove.
Oh ! bear to my mind these flow’rets entwined,
The love that inspired the gift ;
Teach my heart to revere a treasure so dear,
And care from my bosom uplift.
Those sweet fragile flowers will summon the hours,
Thy presence my bosom caressed ;
This tale they must bear, that a fond thought was there,
While they were reposed on thy breast.


JUVENILE POEMS.
The while tho’ apart, thy kind loving heart,
My constancy still to repay,
While envious eyes so admired my prize,
She thought of her darling away.
That maiden-blush rose ! how my mem’ry it throws
To mv first cherished hours of bliss, .
When, beyond all control, how you blushed when I stole
That bud of affection—a kiss.
That bud nourished now by the heart’s dearest vow,
Blooms brighter than heavenly ray ;
Unlike other flowers, when culled from their bowers,
It blooms without chance of decay.
Those buds of affection, oh ! sweet recollection,
For ever in duplicate gleam ;
The two that entwine are your heart and mine,
The third is its flourishing dream. .
Those roses I’ll cherish, and tho’ they may perish,
While love must for ever remain, .....
Their leaves once so bright, shall fill with delight
A bosom once burthened with pain.
And should fates decree e’er part you and me,
Our love, which can never expire,
Shall bury its glance, till awaked from the trance,
Twill burn with unperishing fire.
And if I should die, give the thought not a sigh,
Should I in my grave lie at rest;
Love, place the dear flowers, rememb ring past hours,
To moulder away on my breast.
That breast where true love, ever constant shall move,
If forced to cold nature resign ;
Remember how clearly, how fondly, how dearly,
That silent heart, Marie, was thine.
But should we be left, of life unbereft,
Fond love to my bosom repay ;
United we’ll wear those roses so dear,
Yes, wear them, my darling, for aye.


THE EMBLEM.
THE EMBLEM.
Emblem of our plighted hearts,
Plighted love that never parts,
Be to her a constant token
Of those vows so sweetly spoken,
Darling, thou art mine.
Time may bar us often meeting,
Make our raptured moments fleeting;
Time may hasten each sad parting,
Think, as loving tears are starting,
I am ever thine.
Should’st thy heart in absence doubt me,
Think not I could live without thee;
Look on this recall, my dearie,
That I vow with love I bear thee,
I am true till death.
Yes, my love is thine for ever,
For we cannot, will not sever ;
Years may pass, as time is rangeless,
Still I’d vow my love is changeless
In my parting breath.
Take then, love, and wear this token;
When were vows more truly spoken
Than those which at first delight us,
And which must at length unite us
In a happy life.
Fare thee well, my dearest treasure,
Life without thee has no pleasure ;
Fare thee well, my love, adieu,
Till I fondly claim in you
My own darling wife.


JUVENILE POEMS.
WHISP’RINGS OF MY HEART.
TO L. B. A. M.
In leisure mem’ry fondly strays
To you, all else resign ;
For thou hast said in rhythmic lays
That thou art ever mine.
I know that thou art ever mine,
That ne’er from thee I'll part ;
That I am, darling, ever thine,
Are whisp’rings of my heart.
Of every wish that swells my breast
None fonder can I know
Than that to see thee ever blest,
And I can make thee so.
To live in bliss without alloy,
With thee, I ever sigh ;
Yet if ’t would give my darling joy,
For thee I’d also die.
My joy is such that none can mar,
For we will never part,
And all these passions truly are
The whisp’rings of my heart.
And I’d resign all else thats mine,
But thee, fond, faithful heart,
Shall still be mine, while stars may shine,
Sweet idol of my heart.
parted.
TO M. J. j. G.
Earth has lost its dearest treasure ;
All the world holds dear to me,
Vanished with all other pleasure
In my fate of losing thee.


PARTED.
Gone what dreams of bliss 1 cherished,
Gone all earthly joys from me ;
All my love and heart have perished
In my fate of losing thee.
Earth that once seemed glad and brightest,
Brighter than all fancied bliss,
All my hopes the best and lightest
Sunk at that last parting kiss.
For I knew that my fate was sealed then,
Sealed the doom I still must rue?
Can my heart for e’er be healed then ?
Yes, but that alone by you.
But I see—oh ! dread reflection,
We for evermore must part ;
This the saddest recollection
Of my broken, faithful heart.
How I dreamed a blissful future,
Built fond castles in the air,
Said those things intent to suit your
Tastes, for ever good and fair.
How I deemed this earth a heaven
Bowed alone before her shrine ;
For her all my heart was given,
All my love, my thoughts, were thine.
How I thought my sweetest treasure
Was her loving heart alone ;
How I, doting, thought with pleasure
She was fitted for a throne.
Paid her homage, fond and tender,
Thinking it was duly thine,
Prayed that Heaven then would send her
Happiness when she was mine.
How I trusted what was spoken,
As ’twere echoed from the heart,
Giving many a loving token —
All are gone since we must part.


JUVENILE POEMS.
If deceitful proved she ever,
Faithless ! were it nothing more,
Were it then our fate to sever,
Could I leave her and adore.
Dreams still whisper, whisper kindly,
Love will yet my heart restore;
But I know it lures me blindly,
For on earth we meet no more.
Yet I love her and will ever,
Place my heart, before her shrine,
Hope may shine, tho’ I may never
Call her fondly, dearly mine.
Earth may never know the reason,
That our hearts are parted now,
Neither guilty of a treason,
Neither faithless to a vow.
But I know, all earthly treasure
AH in life once dear to me',
Vanished with all other pleasure,
In my fate of losing thee.
To die with thee in early bliss,
More pleasure would bestow,
To die with thy sweet parting kiss,
Than all this world can know.
If thy sweet lips would poison yield,
Behold me—do not sigh,
Before thy loving presence kneeled,
To press them till I die.
But oh ! those lips 1 oft have pressed,
Bespeak a heavenly charm,
That soft and smoothly heaving breast,
Ah ! I have lost their balm.
E’en rather than the life maintain,
Without thee as my bride,
Contented more to ease my pain,
In dying by thy side.


'“SINCE FIRST I MET THEE.”
But fare thee well, —we met to part;
Could I this life resign,
’Twould freely go to claim her heart,
And once more claim her mine.
“SINCE FIRST I MET THEE.”
TO E. M. B.
Darling, since when first I met thee,
Since our lips first sweetly met,
I can never more forget thee,
Tell me will you e’er forget.
Tell me—when our lips are parted,
When another’s hand is pressed,
Will you still remain true-hearted ?
Shall I vanish from thy breast ?
Will your heart —the heart I cherish—
Still retain its loving vow ?
Will that love for ever perish
Which is pledged so sweetly now ?
Love, I doubt not. May I ever
Claim your fond and faithful heart ?
Will you promise ne’er to sever—
Ne’er from me, my love, to part?
Yet should we, my love, be parted,
Should you doom me to despair—
Think of me then broken hearted :
Time shall not my love impair.
Do you love me ? may I ever
Claim this constant heart of thine ?
Take my hand before we sever :
Tell me you will e’er be mine.


JUVENILE POEMS.
May I claim thy dear affection 1
And, if thou art ever mine,
Be thy dearest recollection
This fond heart is ever thine.
Ever thine ! those words, my dearest,
Will remain, though we should part;
While you e’er will be the nearest
To this ever-constant heart.
« the whisperings of my heart.
TO E. M. B.
That time will join our hands again.
At length, no more to part—-
That you will true to me remain—
Are whisperings of my heart.
All joys must in our path await
Our griefs alike to share ;
The ups and downs of earthly fate
Each loving heart shall hear.
No griefs, no sorrows shall arise
While we are side hy side,
No pain of parting dim thy eyes,
No absent grief betide.
Each moment bring us pleasures rare :
From thee no more to part!
And all these pensive pleasures are
The whisperings of my heart.
Tho’ sorrows on my bosom prey —
(For love is pain to me)
Tho’ I may die when you ’re away
I’ll live on seeing thee.


“THO’ CRUEL FATE.”
For I must love thee and adore
While love is mine to give;
Deny it not, but prize it more :
From thee I could not live.
Once, love, so near—now severed far,
At length no more we part ;
And, dearest, all these passions are
True whisp’rings of my heart.
“THO’ CRUEL FATE.”
TO E. M. B.
“ Tho’ cruel fate should bid us part,
Your love it cannot kill
You say that with your faithful heart
“ You ’ll love me dearly still.”
But why, my love, such sadness breathe 1
Why dream of parting now ?
Why, love, thy constant heart deceive
To doubt the lover’s vow ?
Fret not thy loving heart again,
For we will never part;
The sigh, my love, which brings thee pain
Would break this faithful heart.
Let doubting sorrows never stay ;
For, when united, we
Shall drive the cares of life away
W ith fond felicity.


JUVENILE POEMS.
“I’LL THINK OF THEE.”
TO E. M. B.
Tho’ distance part my love from me,
Tho’ absence pain her heart,
This fervent breast that beats for thee
Will ne’er from thee depart.
Then dearest one thy fears arrest,
Devote thy thoughts to me,
For ever with a loving breast,
I still will think of thee.
Should other lips than mine betray
A hope inspiring love,
And sweetly words of love array,
Like murm’rings of the dove ;
Or should deceivers wear a mask,
And plead their love for tliee,
“ At such a moment I but ask,”
That you will think of me.
TO E. M. B.
TO MARGARET.
FOR F. T. B.
When absence pains my ardent breast,
When griefs assail its core,
One heart alone, alike distressed
Can mine to life restore.
That breast —ah ! dearest all thy charms
Are sweetly prized by me,
My heart, oft moved by fond alarms
Reminds me still of thee.
Those ruby lips I oft have pressed,
The sweet soul-stirring kiss,
Have soothed my bosom into rest
By their unequalled bliss.


FAREWELL.
What would I yield, what would I give
That bliss once more to know 1
Tis true, I feel I could not live
Unless I loved thee so.
Yet, why should I my passion sigh,
You know this heart is true,
And surely you will not deny
The love I claim from you.
Then tell me, darling, tell me now
That we shall never part,
And pledge me in your sweetest vow,
Your fond and faithful heart.
And I will take your hand in mine,
Joys, griefs, alike to share,
To wander down the sands of time,
With you my darling there.
For ever, yes —for ever thine,
For ever side by side,
To fondly claim you ever mine
My dear, my cherished bride.
FAREWELL.
(WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A YOUNG LADY.)
How sad it is to say farwell,
And bid a friend adieu;
Yet, comforting to hear her tell,
“ I’ll ever think of you.”
These parting words, no look of pain,
Is all I ask of thee ;
The least assurance to remain
In thy sweet memory.


JUVENILE POEMS.
And when receiving this from thee,
Ne’er saddened by regret,
This promise you shall have from me,
“ I never shall forget.”
Though time in after years may tend
My memory to fade,
This frail memorial of a friend,
May raise it from the shade.
And when I think of years gone by,
And thoughts of youth renew,
I’ll not repress the rising sigh,
Whene’er I think of you.
Words however strong, can never
Express a last farewell,
But farewell, and if for ever,
Still for ever, fare thee well.
“ DEPTH OF AFFECTION.”
TO M. J. J. G.
Could I but reveal every passion I feel,
A love that can never be more,
Of this I am sure, that my love is so pure,
I cannot love thee—but adore.
Adore thee I know it, and could I but show it,
As deep and as firm as I feel,
I would not require to pour out my fire,
Nor to thy compassion appeal.
And do I not know, of the depth of thy vow,
Which fails not to stir my fond heart,
While I should despair, beyond all repair,
Should 1 from thy bosom depart.


“DEAREST, LIGHTEN YOUR HEART.”
If forced to resign what I now claim as mine,
If in vain to thy bosom I sigh,
I shall linger in grief, till death brings relief,
Yes, linger to love thee, and die.
For my love is so true, that no one but you.
Shall gain its regard for a day,
For I know day and night, with a smile of delight,
That thou art my darling for aye.
“DEAREST, LIGHTEN YOUR HEART.”
TO M. J. J. G.
Dearest, lighten your heart, for we never will part,
For faithful I’ll be to the last,
I will seek no relief from a transient grief,
For sighs, fears, and doubtings are past.
Love languish, no longer, but make thy heart stronger,
Thy heart’s bitter wailings are o’er,
Oh, let thy heart feel it, and love soon will heal it,
To languish and sigh never more.
Were my heart bared before thee, oh ! how I adore thee,
Would be deeply engraved on its core ;
E’en list not to sighs, but look close in mine eyes
And see there, the girl I adore.
And while I regret we are parted as yet,
We shortly will meet once again,
When thy lips I shall kiss, and may the sweet bliss,
Relieve thy fond bosom from pain.


JUVENILE POEMS.
THE SECOND ADVENT (fragment).
I have watched with awful wonder,
Vivid lightning, with the thunder
Bursting inky clouds asunder,
As torpedoes burst the wave,
And with awe my feelings numbing,
Through my mind is swiftly running,
That like this will be the coming
Of Him once on earth to save ;
The archangels’ trumpet blowing,
Angels coming, angels going,
Waking those who little knowing,
Sleep within the grave.
A WISH (impromptu).
May relief from all grief and from care be your fare,
Unblest with the thoughts of the past,
Rare pleasures and treasures, may your mind ever find,
With good luck as a friend to the last.
PLEA FOR FRIENDSHIP.
Are the bands of friendship broken,
Broken ne’er to join again 1
Words tho’ true, yet rashly spoken,
Spoken when in deepest pain.
When in happy hours of leisure,
Will you think of me once more ?
When in thoughts of greatest pleasure,
Will my rashness be glanced o’er ?


“TEARS OF AFFECTION.’
And forget that e’er I loved you,
Loved as ne’er I’ll love again,
Has my passion never moved you,
Have I truly loved in vain ?
But let friendship still continue,
Let not that be thrown aside,
Glad that I am friendly with you,
Friend of mine, another’s bride.
Friendship then, is all I ask for,
Tho’ I wished for more in vain,
Sorry that it must be looked o’er—
Let our friendship still remain ?
Now farewell, for I must leave you,
Leave you, thro’ no wish of mine,
Still remember that I love you,
Love you ever, ever thine.
“TEARS OF AFFECTION.”
No vow is so sweet, so sincere, so complete,
Tho’ said in an exquisite way,
As the vows that arise from the tear-sprinkled eyes,
That the tears of affection betray.
The vow that is plain in its truth shall remain
Ungarnished by vain verbal ray,
For the love that endows ever comes from the vows
That the tears of affection betray.
In elegant phrase some encumber their praise ;
Their vows they most earnestly pray ;
They are not as sincere as the vows we can’t hear,
But the tears of affection betray.


JUVENILE POEMS.
TO A PHOTO.
TO E. M. B.
Oh ! faithful art, to represent so true—
So dear, so sweet —a photograph of you.
Those are thy lips that oft I’ve sweetly pressed
To soothe thy loving bosom into rest
That same sweet smile they wear when by my side
Shall wreathe them ever, darling, as my bride.
Could they but speak ! Alas ! what vain delight
Inspires my hopes to even wish they might?
And yet so loving, so complete that smile,
While, musing sweet, they seem to say the while—
“ I’m true, my love—my faithful, ever thine,
Knowing for ever I shall claim you mine.”
Would they could speak, my constancy to bless !
But, no : I must that futile hope suppress,
Lest, if such bliss could .ever chance to be,
I’d worship it as e’er I worship thee.
Those sparkling eyes! the fire of love beams there
Beneath a lovely brow, so soft and fair.
Within those orbs how truly have I read
More faithful vows than lips have ever said.
Thy heart speaks there—that heart I love so well,
And pleads a love that words can never tell:
That look is there—(as some lone watch they keep
For him whose loving vows once made thee weep) —
That look is there this loving heart has blest;
These lips are there I oft have sweetly pressed ;
Those eyes are there that beam with constant love
As warm and soft as murmurings of the dove.
Yes, all are there—all, all thy sweetest charms,
As when I clasp thee, loved one, in my arms.
Thus has the picture thou hast sent to me
Aroused my dearest memories of thee,
Foretold my pleasures, and those charms of thine
When I shall claim thee, darling, ever mine.


EPISTLE TO A FRIEND.
. EPISTLE TO A FRIEND.
Tho’ time and distance friendship’s joys debar,
Sad thoughts upraise or pastimes pleasures mar,
These lines perhaps will, as I wish them, tend
To prove the lasting mem’ries of a friend.
My friend ! Ah, what a name! ’Tis dear indeed
In such an age, when masks of friendship plead
O’er hatred’s eyes a friendship true and plain,
With hope of loan or monetary gain.
In such an age as this I do not fear
To style you as a friend for ever dear ;
For ever dear whilst mind its power retains,
Recalls the past, and future hopes maintains.
These fervent hopes, lest fortune’s frowns condemn,
Will he rewarded like the dream of them.
Thus on will Time, with all its changing gleam :
To realise our hopes—renew the dream.
Those mirthful hours now past (and past too soon)
When we beneath the evening’s brilliant moon
Have talked of future days, then seeming fair,
Of happy days—“ built castles in the air ”
Those pleasant times, could they once more return,
For whose dear pleasures ever shall I yearn,
Methinks at least we would not trust the dream
Of future bliss, with its bright transient gleam ;
For hopes will rise, altho’ most hopes are vain,
That we may taste these pleasures once again—
Once more renew the usual evening rounds
Together o’er the old familiar grounds.
These lasting charms (for charms like these bestow
The constant grief the absent one must know)
Must with the griefs of life’s drear battle last
Till griefs are o’er and earthly sorrows past.
Yet, while I know one friend of youth is true—
Tho’ I may ne’er these charms of youth renew—
Still must I own one charm of life is left
Of which, perchance, I shall not be bereft.
And while I contemplate such joys as these,
That must the anguish of this breast appease ;
While still one pleasure here remains on earth
(A friend that’s true, of yet unrivalled worth),
I can with better grace to fate resign


JUVENILE POEMS.
The other pleasures which no more arc mine,
The tranquil scenes for ever dear to view,—
Thus to associate, when such thoughts are rite,
The scenes of friendship with a friend for life
Unchanging ever, for he is, I know,
A friend to all, to vice alone a foe.
“GOOD NIGHT.”
TO L. B. A. M.
Words for Music.
Night its cloud of darkness throws,
Swiftly time in sweetness flows ;
Now the moon has sunk to rest
In her robes of splendour dressed.
Must I leave thee, darling, now ?
Leave without love’s faithful vow 1
Tho’ despair should break my heart,
Must I now r from thee depart 1
Chorus : Then, good night!
Fairest, dearest, sweet —Good night !
Wilt thou leave me thus in pain 1
We might never meet again
Till upon the golden shore
We shall dwell for evermore.
Must I leave thee, darling, now 1
Leave without love’s faithful vow 1
Tho’ despair should break my heart,
Must I now from thee depart ?
Chorus.
No ! that smile thy passion proves ;
Love within those orbs now moves;
Unto me thy pleasure beams
As if angels blessed thy dreams.
So I’ll leave thee, darling, now—
Leave thee with love’s faithful vow :
Peaceful be thy dreams and light
Till we meet again—Good night !
Chorus.


“RECOLLECTIONS OF CHILDHOOD.”
“RECOLLECTIONS OF CHILDHOOD.”
I.
When retrospection fills the leisure hour,
Else idly spent in some secluded bower,
When mem’ry views as in a mirror seen,
’Midst pleasures here, the pleasures that have been ;
When to the mind returns some long-lost face,
Some treasured scene, some well remember’d place,
Or boyish haunt, perhaps how greatly chang’d ;
Some distant hill, in youth how often rang’d,
Some word endear’d, to heart and mem’ry sweet,
That solitude’s dark gloom will bid repeat,
To soothe the heart by its inspiring ray,
As night retreats before the orb of day.
When in the gloom, I seem to feel the press
Of parted lips, that linger’d to caress,
How true returns the picture of the past,
On mem’ry’s pages too securely cast.
Time dims the verdure, but the constant dew
Of sweet reflection, calls it forth anew,
As when high heaven’s cheery drops restore
The grass, that long a sultry summer bore.
So with reverted, but a cloudless eye,
Once more I view the scenes that never die.
11.
Then dear old home, long left, but ever dear,
Where from my eyelids scarcely dropped a tear,
Let first my song thy constant cliarms renew,
Where I the breath of life first feebly drew.
Gone are those walls, no vestige there remains
That eyes may cherish, tho’ the mind retains.
Still, still I see, as from my infant bed,
The drooping willow wave its verdant head ;
Short distance thence a great acacia grew,
The fragrance of whose blossoms oft I drew ;
The scent of roses, on the breezes borne,
Spread softly o’er my sweet repose at morn ;
My cheerful eyes towards the window drawn
Viewed the bright streaks of summer’s roseate dawn ;
And when my limbs regaled in sportive play,


JUVENILE POEMS.
And passed the pleasant hours of youthful day,
It was my pride-the joy of bygone years,
Whose pleasant dreams my youthful life endears,
To gambol o’er the green—the verdant flat,
With shoeless feet, and head without a hat,
To walk along the river’s banks of green.
And view the silvr’y stream that flowed between,
To watch the finny tribe, with scales as >ng \
As polished silver on a moonlit night,
Jump from the water, splash amid the stream,
And gild their sides with Sol’s enliv mng team.
There on that green the cricketers displaye ,
With wielding bat the flying ball was stayed ;
Far through the air the ball was seen to rise,
The fielder missed it—sun was in his eyes—
Each dire mishap a prompt excuse would yield,
And plead their want of practice in the held.
Sometimes the ball with reckless flight and quiver,
By driving willow, reached the sparkling river.
Up went a cry, a cry of wild applause,
Six runs awarded the heroic cause.
Alon" the flat the runners tried their pace,
While smiling fair ones showed the handsome ace ,
All kinds of sports, the visitor would find,
To calm the trouble of a weary mind.
The champion Watson sped among the rest,
Each striving first the tighten’d tape to breast.
But all these joys, these all from first to last,
Are numbered sadly in the distant past.
The house has gone, and changed the scene o, yore,
The tall acacia also is no more.
The longer left, the willow’s drooping form,
Was rudely shattered by a raging storm,
And in their place the wheat field now is spread ,
The rose that fragrant bloomed, long since is dead.
Childhood is o’er, but mem’ry’s vision sweet.
The charms of vanished youthful days repea
111.
More in the town, the stranger’s eye commands
Where the brick steeple of the old church stands.
’Twas in that church that I received my name,
And of a faithful flock, a lamb became.


“RECOLLECTIONS OF CHILDHOOD.”
The walls are gone, the steeple stands alone,
From which rang out a bell of joyous tone.
Across the street a stately structure rose,
From which the song of praise oft sweetly flows.
How does my mind recall the long past days,
When I have joined my voice with heartfelt praise
Within those walls. There did my youthful tongue
Join psalms and hymns that there were daily sung;
Still does that choir with youthful faces throng,
And brothers’ voices chant the sacred song,
Dressed all in white, how pious there they stand,
The bright forerunner of a heavenly band.
IV.
On goes the mind. The old fainilar way
I see again, once travelled day by day.
There stands, unchanging still, St. Alban’s School,
Kept strict by discipline and stricter rule.
Daily my path toward those walls were bent,
Wherein how many happy hours were spent.
Beyond that fence in games of base employed,
Were spent some hours that I most enjoyed ;
In quarrels oft —for many feuds arose,
My bosom friends were sometimes greatest foes.
These all forgot, save that which never dies,
But grows in age’s rock—firm friendship’s ties.
Times also were, when cricket seasons came,
Each strove to earn with bat and ball a fame ;
Well I remember, still I see the place,
I bowled the ball with such a rattling pace
Once past the wicket, thro’ the fence it broke,
A feat which then great admiration woke.
At the other times the marble taw was sped,
A game at which I seldom was ahead ;
But in the midst of all the eager fun,
We found our game was prematurely done,
And if at marbles; this I must confess,
Some went with more than his and some with less,
And into school. Here will my mind recall
More lasting pleasures than the bat and ball;
And my old teacher, can I here deny,
Who owes more gratitude to you than I ?
Can I deny the thanks so justly thine,


JUVENILE POEMS.
This tribute of esteem—these thoughts of mine.
We were your care, our progress was your pride,
Oft was your patience most severely tried,
Your perseverance brought its due success,
And thanks from me I can but ill express.
Yes, 1 would wish, when I consider all
The cares and troubles, that on teachers tall,
When I reflect with meditative eye,
O’er mem’ry’s page of days long since gone by,
That I could frame for thee more worthy lays,
To tell thy virtues and to speak thy praise.
Those days are past with others quite as dear,
My sole regret, they are no longer here.
The school is closed, another in its stead,
Usurps the learning and erects its head.
Where are my friends, the boys of long ago,
They are my friends, I never had a foe.
Absence blots out all enmities at last,
And leaves but friends—the mein’ry of the past.
Few still remain, but scattered far and wide,
O’er plain, o’er mountain, and the boundless tide,
Go on their ways. Have they a thought of me
Of scenes and pleasures that have ceased to be f
Yet, I look back with unremitting joy,
And view the pleasures that had pleased the boy,
In vain ’tis true; from them alone I learn
These joys, these pleasures can no more return.
Y.
Again indeed, some other joys were mine,
Which even here I may not quite resign,
But when resumed, however changed the clime,
My mind flies back beyond the space of time,
Calls back delight from years increasing van,
And points the scenes in which they first began.
Time’s rangeless path, how swiftly flies along,
Till present pleasures to the past belong,
Till sorrows rise regretful of the last,
That scenes so welcome are so quickly past.
But onward too dim sorrow heedless hies,
Where roses strew the path, and pleasure lies ,
At length dissolved no more their flavours taste,
All trace is lost of them in equal haste.


“ RECOLLECTIONS OF CHILDHOOD.”
Ah ! there are sports which ne’er have lost their charm,
For weary minds a still unfailing balm.
How I have loved in days of long ago,
The fishing line with careful art to throw,
Or watch the float with still and pensive eye,
Upon whose summit sits the dragon fly,
Long for a bite, at length obtain my wish,
And land with pleasure the expected fish.
At other times, as anxious as before,
An hour to watch, and still an hour more ;
At length a nibble; now prepared again,
Wait for a bite which almost seems in vain ;
Again a nibble, and another, lo!
The float has nearly disappeared below ;
But back it comes, again to anxious wait,
Then pull it out —but on it there’s no bait.
Another on, the hook is well concealed,
Not e’en the shank I like to have revealed.
Now drop it in, and look with anxious care,
While, for a time, the float is still as air.
Then bob ! bob ! bob ! I have another bite,
I take good care this time to have him right.
With expectations now my mind is fertile,
I p U H—I have him—yes ! a great big turtle.
VI.
Thus were my days in early childhood spent,
But they are past and were too early sent.
My chief delight, most lasting too of all,
I love to practice as I do recall.
Still does its charms as then my time employ,
And reigns the summit of my every joy,
Disperses gloom w ith all its many cares,
And e’en the wearied, troubled mind repairs,
Inspires the mind with joys sincere and bright,
Exults the heart with impulse gay and light.
Such are the virtues of this matchless fun,
Borne on the sound and power of the gun.
Out in the fields where buzzing quail abounds,
How merrily the loud report resounds;
Spot scents a covey, now he’s on the trail,
See with what eagerness he wags his tail;


JUVENILE POEMS.
Now he has set, his tail outstands and straight,
And with what eagerness does he await;
The word is given, a brace are in the air,
Ban", bang, l esounds and back he brings the pair.
With game-bag full of ducks, and snipe and quail,
Pigeons and curlew's, plover, too, and rail,
Homeward rejoicing—Oh ! what joy is ours.
Who would not thus employ his leisure hours f
These days are gone with others in their train,
But sports like these within my reach remain ;
And they recall the hours that cannot last,
Among the pleasures of a living past,
For still it lives on mem’ry’s fadeless page,
And grows not dim with fast increasing age.
VII.
How sweet the theme, when present pleasures cast
Some dim resemblance of the treasured past,
Reflects a shadow, now no longer here,
Of times long vanished, but of times that were.
Oh ! solitude, oh ! gloom, my dearest friend,
With thee my life I lead, and hope to end.
Few feel thy charms, and few will learn to feel
The recollections that thy hours reveal.
In youth I courted not thy glooming reign,
Yet having loved thee constant must remain ;
In youth a foe avoided, and despised,
At length embraced, and ever dearly prized.
Thy charms I knew not, now for ever know
The lasting pleasures that thou canst bestow.
I thee have sought, companion of my heart,
When other joys and friendship’s smiles depart,
And I have found thee, and thou hast become
Part of my nature, constant friend and home.
Nay, do not marvel that I now embrace
The dismal father of a gloomy race
For solitude has charms, tho’ free from care,
That kings and queens may never hope to share.
Another world appears to be his realm,
He, on the ship of ages takes the helm.
Here, I look back a thousand years and more
And see by hist’ry’s eye what was before,


“RECOLLECTIONS OF CHILDHOOD.”
Commune with Csesar, wonder at the man,
And see the face of earth ere time began ;
I hear the voice of friends now passed away,
Once merry voice, but now no longer gay.
In paths I walk, by feet of man untrod,
And see in grass and stone the hand of God,
I view the sky, a jewelled glist’ning sphere,
And woke to marvel, see it also here.
These dear delights I could not now resign,
Nor claim the social mirth a joy of mine.
These are not all, but others more sublime
Creep on my mind and wrest an age from time,
Draws back the veil, the veil of years gone by,
Before the power of recollection’s eye.
Home scenes and faces joyfully appear
They are not mine, tho’ still remembered dear.
There have I watched in summer’s azure skies,
The morn enlarged, a sphere of gold arise,
Lift from the hills as gently as a breeze,
And soon look down upon the tallest trees.
Then like a kite, diminishing in size
When near approaching to the concave skies,
Struggling as though to reach the Lden blue,
Its golden tint becomes a silver hue.
On summer evenings, ’twas my joy to go,
When heaven seemed dry and earth was parched below,
Down to the river’s gently sloping side,
And on its bosom confidently ride.
There near the edge the youngsters played their pranks,
Splashing securely near the grassy banks,
Shouts of delight they sent upon the air, —
I must confess the scene was passing fair.
And then the youth who came his limbs to lave,
Conquered at once the freedom of the wave.
Dashed thro’ the water buoyantly afloat,
Ploughing the surface like a faithful boat.
But sorrow’s mask to pleasure soon succeeds,
And quickly takes the place when joy recedes.
Yet, since 1 ne’er these charms of youth forget ?
I will not give my name to vain regret,
For recollection, faithful to the last,
Draws vivid pictures of a treasured past ;
And tho’ I must some joys of youth resign—
Some scenes and pleasures that are no more mine,


JUVENILE POEMS,
Tho’ other eyes enjoy the vanished scene,
And gambol where I played upon the green,
Still can I find, and never cease to find,
Some fond enjoyment for the pensive mind :
Reflection’s aid in Solitude’s still bower
Recalls the face, the scene, the place, the hour.
VIII.
Then came a change : that home was mine no more.
A visitor I enter through the door,
Welcome and loved, a brother and a son,
Fondly expected at the set of sun.
Time labours on, the days, the weeks go by,
Spreading vast changes to the searching eye ;
At length arrives the eve I should return
To friends, whose hearts with expectations burn ;
Brothers look out an elder one to greet,
Gazing intently up the sloping street.
Once more at home, a father’s hand I press,
And brothers and a sister dear caress,
Hear all the news, each eager to relate
With cheery voice what happened there of late.
Old scenes appear, tho’ some are changed and gone,
That once was my delight to look upon ;
Old friends 1 see, attention to command,
Who meet me here and there with outstretched hand;
Old voices now, me with a welcome greet,
The same that solitude will oft repeat.
Old sights recur that ever please my eyes,
When o’er the hills I see the pale moon rise,
The same loved hills, that time cannot absorb,
Reveals to view the golden, nightly orb.
Time’s viewless wing quick wafts the hours aside,
As favoured winds the bark upon the tide.
My space of joy—the days, the hours are past,
I bid farewell to home, perchance the last.
Few hours hence avail to change the scene,
Rude craggy rocks usurp the sloping green,
Mountains o’er hills in quick succession rise,
With distant peaks that seem to touch the skies.


“RECOLLECTIONS OF CHILDHOOD.”
IX.
The pilgrim next, for pilgrim I have been,
Passing from place to place, from scene to scene,
Pursues his course another home to find,
And seeking, finds congenial to his mind.
Yes, it has been, and 1 would change it not,
My fate to seek another homely spot,
Pound which the smile of friends would soon become
The circle of delight, I call my home.
Time has at length that search of mine repaid,
And friendship’s form, which time can never fade,
Its changes spread o’er visions that have been,
With contrasts sweet to beautify the scene.
H ere may my mind a pleasant past forget,
Unmingled as of yore with deep regret;
Here may recall (a year has passed between)
The brightest joys this heart hath ever seen.
Oh ! worthy name for such a pleasant place,
Where I may ever meet a smiling face,
What joys, delight within thy walls should meet,
For true to me has been thy name “ Retreat .”
What weary trav’ller, hungry and forlorn,
But here finds shelter from a wintry storm,
Rests from his journey, and, on being fed,
Calmly reposes on a proffered bed.
This welcome roof, discovered now at last,
Bids me forget the pleasures of the past.
Since here 1 came two years have passed away,
But still thy charms have found no dull decay ;
While I recall what I can ne’er forget,
Tho’ with remembrance comes a sad regret —
’Tis that I loved !
X.
The world was changed to me:
My heart was bound to beat no longer free.
I oft had loved some sweet angelic face,
Praised with intense devotion every grace ;
But ere my heart a true affection knew,
From time’s experience indifference grew,
Another’s charms possessed the changing hear t,
And bade the former love henceforth depart;


JUVENILE POEMS.
Embraced the one another to resign,
Without a wish to ever call her mine.
Nor would I blame for faithless want of truth
When wild romance inspired the love-lorn youth.
Passions that thus unreasonably burn
Die out, and seek more fuel in their turn ;
Perceive some beauty in a lovesick maid;
Whose yielding heart but needs to be repaid,
And failing still the youthful heart to move,
Seek other faces to ensure that love.
Not long the heart was loveless doomed to beat
Within thy ever-welcome walls, Retreat.
Thus did I find a loved one and a home
Where love should live and sorrow never come.
And she was all this world holds dear and bright,
Love was her sphere, affection was her right,
For she was love. To her and her alone
My love was giv’n,—this heart her willing throne.
I courted her with looks, with earnest eyes,
For which return she gave with loving sighs ;
And when our eyes, being raised, the other’s met,
With searching glance her orbs were sweetly set
To pierce .my eyes, and there descry love’s art,
Or read the whisp’rings of the faithful heart.
The time soon came when evening’s closing hours
Brought to repose the nightly folding flowers.
I took her hand, and she withdrew it not; —
Ah ! can that evening ever be forgot 1 —
I vowed my love in words that love inspired,
And tho’ my vows, it seemed, she much admired,
Still there was ought —I failed to trace it out—
That filled her face with sweet but hop ful doubt,
And she made no reply. Again I asked
Why her dear face in trouble then was masked.
She raised her eyes to mine, her tearful eyes,
Mingling her words with half-escaping sighs,
And said, with accents tremulously sweet,
Causing my heart more eagerly to beat,
“ My words had pleased her, and believe she would
If but my vows were true as they were good.”
With hopeful heart I told my vows again,
Begging my pleading might not be in vain.
Her love at length was mine, and evermore
Shall I unchanged that faithful heart adore.


“RECOLLECTIONS OF CHILDHOOD.”
But fate had willed, nor altered the decree,
To part thy loving, constant heart from me.
Oh ! could I see my future earthly doom,
What joys, what sorrows must my heart consume !
Could I but know that we should meet again,
And soothe the heart that now is racked with pain,
Could I but see the love thy love had blessed,
And press again the lips 1 oft have pressed,
Could I but feel the heart not wholly lost,
Forget the love I have, and know the cost;
Could some sweet spirit gently hov’ring o’er
What once I claimed, but now can claim no more,
Tell her my love, or whisper back to me
That she from pain and grief is ever free,
Then could I yield and willingly resign
The love and heart that are no longer mine,
Strive to forget our farewell was the last,
And bury in the present all the past.
XI.
But now my recollections, now farewell,
Till other times and other scenes impel
The mind to view the distant past once more,
Recounting all the joys it knew before ;
Till present joys become a pleasant past,
Whene’er the eye is retrospective cast;
Till future joys, tho’ mixed with sorrows some,
The hopeful present have at length become,
Till then my recollections silent flow,
JNor on the past one vain regret bestow.
Let silence reign, else may the past condemn
The vaunted pleasures that succeeded them,
Deny the present all the charms we prize,
Lost in the joys where fond remembrance lies.
A STORM AT SEA.
The day was calm : the sea was calmer still,
Unstirred by wave, by ripplet or by rill ;
No cloud obscured the sun’s warm, genial ray;
Tho’ winter brought it, seemed a summer day.


JUVENILE POEMS.
Night slow closed in. The calm and breezeless air
Bore token of an evening still more fair.
Yet now the eye more skilled in winter storm,
Not used to gaze at winter fires made warm,
Wore pensively a troubled look and stern,
And rested on some object of concern
Of deep concern to the experienced eye,
So trained to read the bodings of the sky,
Where Nature paints, with awful grandeur spread,
Those dark and dismal storms the seamen dread.
Along the western sky a few dark clouds—
(Scarce to be dreaded seemed these stormy shrouds)
Now gather close, as flocks of timid sheep
When warned of ill for mutual safety creep.
In strange succession on and on they come,
Some banking up and onward driving some,
Till, ere the night, the once pure azure sky
A dismal robe of darkness lends the eye,
And e’en the inky ocean, dread to view,
Reflects more horrors in its murky hue.
Now .all is darkness save round the distant west.
With stormy blackness in fierce grandeur dressed ;
And here, beneath its robes of veiled storm,
Clouds seem to part, as tho’ by Neptune torn,
And lightning glimmers o’er the waves around,
Attended oft by thunder’s rumbling sound.
Once more ’tis calm. What threat’ning horrors reign .
The frightened sea-gulls quit the inky main ;
With noiseless wings they to their cliffs repair,
Their wave-girt cliffs, to seek for safety there ;
While all around, as tho’ in constant dread
Of frowning horrors bursting overhead—
While over all there comes a deadly chill,
There rests the dull depression. All is still.
The home-bound vessel from another world
Lies cal ml v now and all her sails are furl d ,
No sound on sea, in vessel or in sky,
And pensive faces now are turned on high.
All Nature’s hushed into a slumber mild,
Awaiting now a burst of tempest wild
In expectation for the threatening sky
To burst forth all its raging from on high.
In calmness yet, till, by the thunder torn,
Now bursts around the fury of the storm.


A STORM AT SEA.
Flash after flash is seen and thunder heard,
Peal after peal, and sea and sky are stirred ;
Forked lightning bursts the rolling vapour’s form ;
All nature, too, seems troubled by the storm.
Louder and nearer now the thunders roll,
And lightnings rend the heavens from pole to pole.
The skipper, lashed with firmness to the wheel,
Now turns aghast at each succeeding peal,
And makes the shore toward the lashing bar
With moanings constant that are heard afar.
In each successive flash he views the waves
So often made the hardy seamen’s graves,
And with a courage strong and vision stern
Watches the vivid flashes in their turn ;
And on and on from wave to wave he bounds:—
With thunders roaring still the air resounds.
Drenched there, he stands, by all the blinding spray,
Steering his vessel on her dangerous way,
With hopeful heart (but still his hopes are vain)
That he may yet the harbour safe regain,
Escape the bar, whose very sound brings dread,
And moans from all its many ill-starred dead,
And reach his home.—Ah ! what a scehe is here,
Mingled are prayers, and sighs, and many a tear;
A face is to the window pressed—a tearful face,
A babe is folded to her breast—a sweet embrace,
Fond eyes look forth, and anxious in the night
She views around by lightning’s vivid light,
And deeply forth into the darkness peers;
Fancy amid the .storm a footstep hears, —
A footstep dear, she ne’er will hear again,
Nor see the face she seeks, but seeks in vain.
Thus is she doomed to look across the deep
For one whose heart-felt vows once made her weep,
To wait and watch till time brings on despair,
And constant mourning blanch her cheek so fair,
Till morn brings hope, and eve a cheerless gloom
Of forlorn hopes, inevitable doom.
Oft to the window drawn by hopeful heart,
Still sighs the moaning bar and hopes depart,
Backward she turns, again to weep despair,
And sinks with sobs and sighs into her chair.
Her babe she presses fondly to her breast,
Its lips to hers how oft are sweetly pressed,


JUVENILE POEMS.
How oft its face is wet’with loving tears,
Impending fervently^endears;
Firmly she presses close'to the cherub form,
Lest it be swallowed in storm.
Beside her stands his mother, sad and worn,
To griefs inured, for many she had borne,
And strives to soothe her daughter’s griefs and sighs,
To dry with hopeful words her aching eyes,
To ease her heart, when some fond question asked,
Her own sad eyes by partial darkness masked ;
“ Say, mother dear,” for thus would she accost,
“ Think’st thou my own beloved will be lost;
Think’st thou his hand I e’er will press again,
And in his bosom hide my face from pain,
In bliss once more 1 ” With sad and tearful eye,
And doubting heart, she reply,
“ No ! my child, it cannot, must not be
That he thy dearest, thus will part from thee,,
The God who notes from Heaven the sparrow s tall
Will see thy tears, will hear thy fervent call.
Alas, ’twas vain; all hope was gone and past,
And he they wait for long has breathed Ins last.
Unknown his grave, his fate alike unknown,
No sacred spot, no fond sepulchral stone,
No more shall he his wife and babe behold,
No more a tale of danger dark unfold,
No more his mother see, herjdndness know,
And she will sink and perish from the blow ;
No more his wife will meet him at the gate,
And tell him sweetly 4 that the hour is late ;
No more his babe, a curly-headed^boy,.
With smiles indulge his fond paternal joy,
For all are gone. His widow will grow old,
His boy a man, with fearless heart and bold ;
And oft will they recall in silent gloom
The storm which stole him to an early doom,
With saddened eye together will relate
The seaman’s daring, but oft hapless fate,
The mother pray her son’s proud youthful form
Will never brave the dangers of a storm.
The End.
