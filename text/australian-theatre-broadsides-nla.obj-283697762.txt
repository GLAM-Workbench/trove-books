Some of the tribes of India lave a
marriage custom which calls for the
presence of a cow and a calf at the
ceremony. The principals and the priest
drive a cow and calf into the water, and
there the bride and groom, as well as the
clergyman, clutch the cow’s tail, while
the officiating personage pours water upon
it from a glass vessel, and utters a
religious formula. The couple are now
united in wedlock ; and the priest, for his
part in the ceremony, claims the animals,
and also receives any sum in money which
the groom thinks is necessary to pro-
pitiate the idols.

times as large as it was in 1869, the year

out of copyright, no less than 11 London
publishers hate brought out editions, and
in the face of tl at we have sold of
‘ Pickwick ’ alone 521,750 copies during
the last 21 years."
Miss Maunders : “He proposed, but I

Curling tongs dry the hair by removing
the natural oil, and crimping the hair
over hot iron sooner or later causes it to
crack and break. This is not a matter of
so great importance in young girls, whose
hair will grow again, but in the case of
older women, in whom the hair is
beginning, to tain out, it is ap l- to hasten
the fall of what remains and to cause
partial baldness over the forein a 1 and

Clarke, who is a salesman in a grocery
shop, met a friend who is assistant in a
cigar shop, and asked him for a cigar.
“ Haven’t got any,” said his friend.
“ Haven’t got anv,” said Clarke.
“ Why, when I used to work in a cigar
shop I always had my pockets stuffed
with cigars.”
“ Yes, probably that’s the reason why
you aren’t in a oigar shop now,’ was the
crushing reply.

A new story of Ouida is going the

publisher, the late Mr. J. P. Lippincott,

course of a very friendly conversation, to
ask her how she came to know so much
about clubs, camp life, barracks, gambling-
houses, and other places which are only
visited by men. She placed h r nands
upon her knees, and, looking straight at
her questioner, saucily said, “ It is none
of your business.”

The English railways were first largely
modelled upon the old stage-coaoh sys-
tem. The “ coaches ” were at the begin-
ning fac-similes of stage ones, and the
guards wore red coats, like their prede-

.play the train out of the station, and for
a time the “ fares ” were actually entered
on a way-bill.
