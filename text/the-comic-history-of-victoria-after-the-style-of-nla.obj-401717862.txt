COMIC HISTORY OF VICTORIA,
After the style of Gilbert A. a’Beckett
(a very long way),
WRITTEN BY MR. W. B. (TILL,
A.nd delivered by him , with immense applause , at the
Suburban Fenny Readings.
Ladies and Gentlemen, —It is with great diffidence that I
appear before you to-night to lecture upon so important a
subject as the “History of Victoria” —the magnitude of the
undertaking almost stays me at the very threshold of my dis-
course, but with your kind assistance accorded to me in the
usual manner, I will endeavour, as lucidly as possible, to
instruct you in the manners and customs of your adopted, and
to some here, native country —how from a wilderness of blacks,
gum trees and ’possums, it has reached its present proud
position amongst the nations of the world. But, oh ! for the
sake of educational advancement, do not, no, do not mis-
construe my statements.
To commence then. In the early ages, before trotters
became marketable commodities, or Scotch pies were called
into existence to cheer the hearts of men, this soil was un-
trodden by the foot of a white man, or any oder man, except a
black man. The blacks, the original, and aboriginal, inhabi-
tants, were existing in a happy state of ’possum skins, grease
and tattoo, to say nothing of grubs and the tender hind quarters
of the agile kangaroo rat. They were married, and gave in
marriage; the ceremony of their solemnization being connected
in a marked manner with a curious piece of hardwood, termed,
in the mellifluous language of the natives, a “ waddy.” They
peacefully built their bough huts, passed their days in indo-
lence, and at night they watched each twinkling little star,
and every stalwart denizen of the forest did exclaim “ I wonder
muchly what you are; ” or he would take a stroll to the broad

waters of the Yarra Yarra, or mighty Merri Creek, there
launch his frail bark contrivance, and in proud consciousness
of liberty would revel in the delight of “ Paddling his own
Canoe.” But, oh! for the sake of educational advancement,
do not, no, do not misconstrue my statements.
Time passed on, as time usually does, and a change came
o’er the spirit of the darkies’ dream. A mighty man from the
northern shores —Sir John de Palkner—did here arrive in a
gallant bark, and the strokes of the axe resounded through the
leafy forest. It was at this important period in the history of
the country, that the Parliament Houses were commenced,
which are calculated by some of the greatest statisticians in the
kingdom, as likely to he finished when G. P. S h apologises
to the house for his unseemly behaviour —if not sooner. Hob-
son’s Bay at this time was a dreary waste of waters —no mighty
“ Suffolk” or “ Great Britain” with its keel ploughed the
deeps and shallows of that enclosure, and no “Kangaroo” or
“Despatch” steamboats smoked its way across to the town of
'William, or the sand-locked shores of Geelong. This same
city, by the way, is supposed by antiquarians to have been
founded by the Ancient Mariner, who, after laying out its
streets to the best advantage, sailed from its harbour in disgust
at not being able to acquire the language or understand the
habits and customs of the Geelongese. But, oh ! for the sake
of educational advancement, do not, no, do not misconstrue
my statements.
I will pass now over a lapse of years, during which nothing
of any importance occurred —except the introduction of meat
or fruit pies, all hot, and the unlimited consumption of two
ales —and come to the period when Charles 1., surnamed
Hotham, ascended the throne, and ruled over what, it now
seemed, was a golden country. Through the mismanagement
of the prime minister of the period the Battle of Eureka was
fought, and many lives were sacrificed. It now being admitted
on all sides that the rebels, or miners, as they were then called,
were, to a certain extent, justified in raising the standard of
revolt, how necessary it becomes, for the sake of justice, to
now reward the said prime minister —the PosTEii-child of the
state —for having been the means of bringing on, by his per-
nicious counsels, so disastrous an affair. But, oh ! for the sake
pf educational advancement, do not, no, do not misconstrue
my statements.
This reign was characterized by an indiscriminate waste of
the public funds, and the erection of stately buildings, destined
to bear the name of the Western Market, the ruins of which
are to the present day jealously guarded from intrusion by the


corporation, for the purpose, it is supposed, of showing ensuing
generations what clever ideas their forefathers had, and what
a clever —though, perhaps, slightly insane—way they possessed
of carrying those ideas out. It was at this time that two great
national works w r ere performed, viz., the erection of atoll-gate
upon the St. Kilda Hoad, and the placing of a pair of spectacles
upon the tower of St. James’ Cathedral.
The Hegent Macarthur and Henry 1., surnamed Barkly,
succeeded Charles m quick succession, and a great man of the
period, the O’S' y of that ilk, began to make himself con-
spicuous. Like all great men, in all countries and times, he
had his detractors; but John the big calmly held his own
until the day of misfortune came, and the great man fell;
whether he hurt himself when he fell history telleth us not,
suffice it to say—he fell; and loud and long was the rejoicing
thereat. He was a Spaniard by birth, and has lately visited
his native city of Tipperary, situated between the Alps and the
Baltic Sea. But, oh! for the sake of educational advancement,
do not, no, do not misconstrue my statements.
It was at this time also that we made a great step towards
civilization, by introducing the Single Bottle Bill, which has
had the effect of inducing some mothers of families to smuggle
in, amongst their Saturday night’s groceries, a small trifle of the
‘ ‘ cratur,’ ’ ingrafting a taste for the liquor which eventually leads
to divisions in ‘the home circle, desertion of children, and utter
wretchedness. A great change now took place in the principal
street of Melbourne—the Hue de Bourke—brought about by
the establishing of alfresco Oyster Saloons in Paddy’s Market,
the said market deriving its appellation from a distinguished
foreigner of that name.
After a long reign of uninterrupted prosperity Henry de-
parted this country, and was succeeded by Charles 11., sur-
named the Darling. Upon this monarch it is supposed that
the ballad of “ Charlie is my Darling” was composed. It was
in this reign that two very important arrangements took place
—the Dead Lock, upon which some very hard-working people
who were politicians, subsisted for a short time —and a Shoal
of Pilchards, upon which numbers of hard-working people
who were not politicians, subsisted for longer. Two A r ery
great men at this time made their appearance—MacC h and
George Higg m—the latter had a conscience, and he let
everybody know it; Mac was a Scotchman, and so we’ll say
nothing about his conscience. They held the reins of state,
and all sorts of people ran to their horses’ heads, and numbers'
were run over for their pains—which the verdict was, “sarved
’em right.” This age is also remarkable for the introduction
of L. L. Smith’s pills, and the exit of Barney Sullivan from
these shores.


Charles reigned a very short time, and was succeeded by the
Regent Carey, whose term of office was brief, the throne being
soon occupied by Henry 11., surnamed Manners, from his
introduction of an article so much needed in this country. It
was at this time that chignons began to assume gigantic pro-
portions upon the backs of ladies’heads ; the “Flying Scud”
to engage general attention; and the somewhat remarkable
phrase of “Jumpin’ Moses” to engross the public mind. At
this period, too, the system of Palm Oil, for obtaining appoint-
ments, came into fashion, and several very handsome little
sinecures were obtained by pursuing that system at Kyneton ;
the oil sensibly removed the roughness of the Sands, which
wore away beneath the lubrication, much to the operator’s
delight.
Having now arrived at our own time, I must reluctantly
leave my lecture to the future, and thank you sincerely for the
interest you have shown in my subject. You will all perceive
what numerous things might have been done in this country,
had they been attended to; and likewise that had they been
attended to, what numerous things might have been done.
Ladies and gentlemen, I shall finish by observing that Her
Bright Smile Haunts me Still, and When this Cruel War is
Over, I sincerely trust, you will all Paddle Your Own Canoe.
