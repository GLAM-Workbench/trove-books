THE town of Liverpool was founded by Governor Macquarie on
November 7 th, 1810, although there were several small settle-
ments in the district prior to that date, notably the properties of
Thos. Moore, Andrew Thompson and Dr. Townson. The official records
of St. Luke’s Church show* that Rev. Samuel Marsden had both baptised
and buried children who had been born in the district prior to 1810.

While all credit is due to Governor Macquarie, the founder of Liverpool,
and more particular]}' of St. Luke’s Church, we must not forget that
the Rev. Samuel Marsden, of St. John’s. Parramatta, was the pioneer of
religion in the Liverpool district, and the first entries in the original regis-
ters bear his name; “Edward Fletcher, born Bth March, 1808, baptised
19th Mia}’. 181.1; Thomas Tyrell (a child) drowned in the river, and buried
19th May, 1811; Brian Coulon buried 2nd June, 1811. aged 58 years.”
Marsden
Rev. Samuel Marsden conducted divine service in Liverpool as oppor-
tunity offered, using a Government building, utilised as a school, in Bigge
First Services
Street.
The Rev. John Youl was the second clergyman to be associated, and
the first to be exclusively employed in Liverpool. He arrived in Port
Jackson by the “Royal Admiral,” November, 1800, proceeding subse-
quently to the South Sea Islands, returning to Sydney again in 1807. In
1816, after having been employed in the Ilawkesbury River district, he


was appointed Acting Chaplain at Liverpool 1816. where lie remained
practically three years. As statements have been published that Mr. Youl
proceeded to Van Diemairs Land 1816 or 1817. for the sake of accuracy
to Earl I mention that Macquarie, in his despatch to Ear] Bathurst of 20/7/1819
states, inter alia, that “Rev. Mr. Youl. who has been doing duty at Liver-
LS to P roeml earl L to llis own proper station at Port DairyrapleM
Youl to Earl Bath- _^ n 24th 1821 Rev. John Youl requests, in a memorial to Earl
UrSt Bathurst, that his stipend might be increased from ten shilling per day
and mentions the fact that before going to Port Dalrymple he had per-
ormed clerical duty at Liverpool, one of the out-stations of Port Jack-
son, for three years.
iirst Marriage Pew John Youl celebrated the lirst marriage in Liverpool, that of
. obert .Burrows to Emma Goodwin. 23rd December, 1816. Mr. Youl
died m Fort Dalrymple, 1827. Dr, Youl, City Coroner, Melbourne, and
Lir J, Arndell You! were sons.
Proposal to Ibolld st dinFcti*
In the Historical Records of Australia, Vo], IX, we read the copy of


Macquarie’s despatch to Ear] Bathurst, dated 4th April. 1817. as fol-
lows: —‘‘A man named Francis Howard (1 reeuway. who came out here in
1814, and who was an architect of some eminence in England, having been
recommended to me by Governor Phillip, I have employed him as civil
architect. I propose to build a church at Liverpool. I shall give a con-
tract for the building immediately, paying the expenses from the Colonial
Fund. I have already had a very neat house erected in Liverpool.' 7
Parsonage
Surveyor
In the Government Orders, Civil Department, 28/11/1818. a state-
ment appears of the payment to William Stone —travelling expenses
surveying churches at Liverpool and Windsor. £l/10/-.
Greenway
Greenway, who designed Macquarie’s public buildings, received the
magnificent salary of three (3) shillings a day.
In the ‘‘Sydney Gazette” of 14/2/1818 there is in the “Statement of
Public Accounts.” the following item for the quarter ending 31/12/1817;
“To Mr. Nathaniel Lucas, being the first instalment of his contract for
erecting a church at Liverpool, £330.”

Jas. Smith
Air. Lucas died while the work was in progress, viz., 28th April. ISIS,
aged oi years, and was buried in the burial ground to the west of St.
Luke’s cemetery. Upon his death the contract 'was taken over by Mr,
Jaines Smith, who had been employed building; a parsonage at Parra-
matta. and in Government Orders appearing 28/11/1818 an entry
appears : “To James Smith, on account of contract for building new
church, at Liverpool, £200.” In Government Orders appearing in the
“Sydney Gazette” of 28th August, 1818: “To Mr. James Smith, part
payment of contract building Liverpool Church, £400.”
1819.
In Government Orders. Civil Department, February 20th, 1819: “To
Mr, James Smith, part payment of contract building Liverpool Church,
£•100. The total cost of the building was £1570,
The church was opened for divine service during; October. 1819, and
St. Luke's Day has always been considered the anniversary of the sacred
edifice.
1819,
In a paper read before the Australian Historical Society, May 28,
1912, it is stated that the church was completed August, 1824. but this

conflicts with the official records. In Vol. X (1819-1822) of the His-
torical Records of Australia, 24th .March, 1819: ‘'There is a now church
building' at Liverpool.’’ And 28th February, 1820. in a list of public
works completed, mention is made of “a new church -at Liverpool.” In
the “Australian Almanac” for 1834 appears a list of Public Buildings
erected, from plans furnished by Green way between 1816 and 1820, and
the return includes church, parsonage, hospital and gaol at Liverpool.
In Macquarie’s despatch to Earl Bathurst date 24/3/1819. he men-
tions: “There are new churches building at Windsor and Liverpool.” He
reports again, 28/3/1820: “The following Public Buildings have been
completed since my last despatch, .... a. new church at Liverpool.”
Ihese records not only prove that St. Luke’s was completed during the
last quarter in 1819, but they prove also that it is
The Oldest Existing Anglican Church in Australia.
The corner stone of St. Matthew's Church of England, Windsor, was
first laid on 11th October, 1817, but owing to a succession of reverses it
was not completed until 1822, The Macquarie tablet on St. Luke’s is


dated 1819. and that on St. Matthew's, 1820, In the ease of the latter
eliureli the main walls had to be taken down and rebuilt.
Tlie First Incumbent.
Macquarie, writing to Bathurst, mentions that ‘‘'Rev. fir. Yord is to
proceed early to Port Dalrymple” and that “the Rev. R. Cartwright is
to be removed to Liverpool at his own request.” Upon his arrival in the
colony (1810) he was appointed Chaplain at Green Hills (Windsor). He
held the incumbency of St. Luke’s 1819 to 1836. He died on his property
at Collector on 14th December, 1856, being then in his SCth year, and was
buried in St. Luke’s cemetery.
The early clergy, in General Orders, 14/2/1818, were required, at
the baptism of infants, to warn parents of the ravages of smallpox and to
urge upon them the benefits of vaccination. Again, if the clergyman
failed to properly register births, etc., “he shall be proceeded against
under the Tippling Act.”
The first ministers were not overpaid. Mr. Toul received £l5O per
44 - - —— 44


year. Mr. Taylor £2OO. an 4 Mr. Diilfns £lOO. The two latter had also the
oversight of Bd. Mary tie:' Virgin, Denham Court.
Very little is known about the second minister. His name appears
in the minute book, April. 1827. and on 21/5/1828 he appoints Col,
McKenzie his warden, the others being Lieut. Sadlier and Mr. Lloyd. The
minute hook for 1837 to 1846 contains man}’ interesting, and some amus-
ing details. Thus, in 1837, Dr. P. Hill. Messrs. J. J. Moore. T. Y. Blomfield
and D. Johnstone were appointed trustees of the church. In 1840 Rev. J.
Dnffns appoints Col. McKenzie to be his warden, (.}, Blackett replacing
Mr. Lloyd upon the vestry.

On 13/5/1841, Mr. Dnffns presiding, consideration is given to Lloyd
and others’ dispute re paying for vaults ; the aid of the Bishop and the
A ttorn er-G en eral is sought. In 1842 the dispute is still unsettled. £1 fee
is paid for Col. Fillips’ headstone, hut Messrs. Lloyd, J. J. Moore and Cor-
deaux had not settled, el aiming a wrong interpretation of the Act re
measurement as their reason for not doing so. The Warden’s account
for candles to light the church was £O/13/9.

THE EEOTOEY.

On 2/8/42 Rev. J. Duff ns complains that the sexton was drunk at a
funeral and the offender was suspended (from duty presumably ) for, two
mouths.
Parsonage.
The Parsonage had been used by the Government as a Lunatic
Asylum for some time, and on 15/4/1839, the Trustees wanted the Colonial
Secretary to allow them a reasonable amount to cover cost of repairs.
E. Deas Thompson, 30/5/’39, replies to the effect that as rent had been
paid for the use of the building, the upholding of landlords’ repairs rested
with the Trustees. Subsequently, on 20/1/1840. E. Deas Thompson,
through the Bishop, conveys Government’s permission to the Trustees to
sell the Parsonage, and with the proceeds, together with £lOO awarded
by Major Barney and Mr. Miller as worth of tenants’ repairs, to be
applied to building a new parsonage, provided the Government is to be
called upon for no further contribution in any shape.

Clock.
St. Luke’s clock, probably one of the best time-keepers in the Statu
bears the name and date: “Twaites, 1823.” The original copper dial.
superseded for years by a glass one. has been renovated and restored to its
original position.
Registers.
Ihe early registers provide most interesting reading, and contain the
pi a. me,s of many most respectable early colonists, people who have written
their names large in the records of the State. To descend to the other
end of the social scale, one cannot help noticing the number of pioneers
who were married “by consent of the Governor.” Many early pioneers
including some “first fieeters,” were buried in St. Luke’s burial ground’
in -no record remains of them except the entries in the registers. The

Some of these short and simple annals are indeed tragic—thus:
“Mary P , came out by name of Mary 0— , died of snakebite,
16/11/1812”; “John T . ex ‘ Coramandel, ’ found drowned in the
river, 4/6/1812”; “Isaac Eustace (freeman), a soldier, was killed by
natives in the district of Appin and buried 8/5/1814”; “Stephen G ,
ex ‘Three Bees,-’ was killed by fighting 26/3/1816.”
One cannot help admiring the splendid signatures of the two first
parish clerks, John Cutler and ii. Reeves. The parsons’ “fist,” as a rule,
was not very good.
Cemetery
Close to the church and rectory is the cemetery. Within this enclo-
sure repose the mortal remains of many old identities of the town and
district, notably Rev. R. Cartwright, and Mary, his wife: Arm, his daugh-
ter and the wife of Lieut. R. Sadlier, Captain Horsley, of Royal Horse
