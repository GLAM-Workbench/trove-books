(Lttock of Ik gmnhark.
A Faithful Picture, drawn from a most deplor-
able case of Intemperance, which came
under the Author?s own notice.
?Twas when the Summer?s bloom had filled
The mind with pleasing calms,
And Summer winds were whisp?ring low
Their everlasting psalms;
And sweet perfumes from tender blooms
Sent up their fragrant balms.
And children?s voices could be heard
Singing in merry throngs.
As though the mirth of all the earth
Was centred in their songs.
And every tongue spoke out a joy,
And none for human wrongs.
When upwards thro? the street, there came
A man whose very mien
Bore all the signs that he had shunned
The road to virtue?s sheen;
Whose form and look at once partook
Of that that was unclean.
He had that wild and haggard look,
As though he was accursed;
That subtle craving after drink,
That morbid devilish thirst,
That aim of soul to drain the bowl,
Which Virtue never nursed.


That pale, unsteady, wretched gaze
Of one who was unfed,
As though his soul was haunted still
By some great nameless dread.
The look of all within the thrall,
Of that which is not bread.
There was a tremour in his gait,
A movement never still,
A fear of some impending shock,
That drink would never kill;
That certain sign of want of force,
And feebleness of will.
The very children as they passed
Ran by, like startled rooks,
Then parted into little throngs,
And clung unto their books.
As though each mind, to fear inclined,
Was haunted by his looks.
And as he passed from out the crowd,
And left the city hum,
He begged a shilling, ?just to buy
Him food ?he needed some.
Then went iftto the next canteen,
And spent it all in Rum.
And so he drank, from day to day,
Though ruin followed fast,
While not one thought of future joy
Was o?er his spirit cast
But just one link, on ruins brink,
To bind him to the past.


And that was of an early love,
One sad sweet epitome,
Of one fair scene in beauty?s sheen
Set in a village home.
Like some bright star serenely set
Above a princely dome.
Now through the mornings gentle breeze
There came a solemn knell,
Of shattered hopes and buried joys,
His spirit could not quell;
When from her side he parted wide,
And said his last farewell!
He heard the Sabbath bells ring out,
With most melodious sound,
As if in all their silver peals
All other tones were bound.
As though the fair surrounding air
With melody was crowned.
He saw the crowds go into church,
He saw them all disperse,
With all their smiles of happiness,
That made his vice look worse.
And with its stain he walked like Cain,
And seemed to bear the curse.
He heard the women?s voices ring
In trebles from the choir,
And all their hymns with fervor glowed,
And tremulous desire;
They seemed to roll all through his soul,
In tones of living fire.


It made him think of long ago,
When love brought sweet reward
When as a boy he smiled with joy,
When bounding o?er the sward,
And sung within the village church,
In praises to the Lord.
Hut now what was he?shunned by all
A thing! and not a name ;
A living emblem of the ills
That Drunkenness can frame;
A wretched brute who bore no fruit,
Dut only weeds of shame.
And as the music rose and fell,
Its sweet tones did unlock
The rusty flood-gates of his soul,
As light reveals the rock,
Each tender strain ran thro? his brain
Like some galvanic shock.
And like a flash from star to star,
His life leap?d up to view
The virtues that he might have known,
The vices that he knew;
From busy schemes and idle dreams,
Leap?d out the false and true.
Just then a shadow wrapt his brain,
A shadow weird and grim,
That rose from all the vicious ways
In which he seemed to swim,
That bid farewell to every spell
Of happiness to him.


There clear before him lay the life
That he had so caress?d,
The drunken and ignoble ways
Of all his sad unrest ?
Oh God! he gasp?d, had I but clasp?d
One virtue to my breast.
I might have been like other men.
Who pass me night and morn
And not a ragged drunken sot,
A wretched thing of scorn,
1 wonder why I did not die
The day that I was born.
And so each mind of morbid tone
Dwells not on beauty?s glow,
But on the gloom where shadows loom,
And miseries ebb and flow,
As though each nerve had started out
And pointed to a woe.
And so he thought of stranded ships
And all the wreck of life,
And yet he lived who caused the wreck
Of name and hopes, and wife,
It seemed to dart thro? brain and heart,
And pierce him like a knife.
His wife sleeps low within the tomb ?
His children! where are they ?
One little girl whose sweet caress
Still haunts him night and day,
Whose sweet face gleams through all his
dreams,
With resplendent ray.


She met him once with looks of doubt
And anguish on her brow;
Was that her father meanly clad,
To whom she used to bow,
She turned with dread and swiftly fled,
She did not know him now.
Again his craving drives him back
To where the drunkards tread,
And begs a glass he is so faint
And dizzy in his head,
And drinks the rum to drive him dumb,
Without an ounce of bread.
And now he haunts the canteen bar
In mean and ragged suit.
And mixes with the drunken scum
The low and dissolute,
For virtue?s foe clings to the low,
As brute clings unto brute.
And there he sat with haggard face,
And dim and vacant stare;
And spell?d within his morbid mind
The words so framed with care,
That shone from flask and painted cask,
And many a bottle there.
And in the spelling of the Hum,?
The ? red ? to him recurred,
And so he spelt them backwards both,
And Murder was the word;
Then with a sudden fear and dread
His very soul was stirred.


For then he thought of horrid deeds,
How men but seldom pause*
When mad with drink they leap th brink
Of Providential laws;
And mix up in some savage deed,
With red Rum as the cause.
And what was this ? self-murder too,
How long could he now last;
Drinking like rain?that which has slain
Its millions in the past;
Delirium now was near his brow*
To bind its fibres fast.
And then through all his morbid mind
He seemed to hear the thud,
As some sharp knife struck at the life
Just springing in the bud,
He seemed to see the murderer?s hand
Red with human blood.
Then he called tor more to drink,
To still the horrid thought;
And longed for bread ?but ah! instead,
It was the rum he sought,
Then gulped the burning liquor down,
Which his last coin had bought.
And then he laid him down and dreamt
Those dreams which are the worst,
Those phantoms of a flagging brain
Which drinking long has nursed,
Those fevered link s which haunt the sinks
That rum has so accursed.


He dreamt of wrecks upon a sea,
Where he was all afloat,
A sea of Rum and phantom ships
Yet not a sail or boat,
On every side an ocean wide,
And one parched human throat.
And horrid snakes coiled round his limbs
The black, the green, the brown,
They fastened round his neck and face,
And tried to drag him down;
The power to swim forsook each limb,
And yet he could not drown.
The phantom ships drove near him fast*
With crowds forever dumb.
With gloomy flags that bore the words :
? Behold the drunkards come,
? We are the dead the drunken dead,
? That sold our souls for ? Rum.? ?
And though an ocean spread around,
A seal was on his lips ;
Oh, how he longed but just to taste
His usual drunken sips,?
While all the snakes did hiss and bite,
And scourge him worse than whips.
Just then there came a blinding flash,
The sea was all in flame;
And every burning billotv burst
And scorched him as it came,
And then he cursed the raging thirst
That paralysed his frame.


And then the ocean faded out,
But yet the flame was there,
And millions scorched and writhed
In its strong and sulphurous glare,
A fetid smell that spoke of hell,
But not a breach of air.
And far above where angels stood;
He saw his little girl,
Whose tender eyes with sweet surprise
Shone lustrous as a pearl;
And then he woke with sudden start,
His brain all in a whirl.
And so he rose and staggered forth.
And bubbled filthy lore;
A frenzied broken human soul
That no one could adore.
A shattered harp that would not give
A melody no more.
And so they found him pale and wan,
And prematurely grey,
With all the signs and furrowed lines
That tell of quick decay;
A worn out and battered wreck
That drink had cast away.
So one fair and beauteous morn,
When Spring had bloomed again,
The drunkard ?helpless as a child,
Yet free from ache or pain
Was carried to a gloomy cell
With fetters on his brain-


And there he stalks from day to day,
Dressed in a pauper?s suit,
The parent eye might him descry,
Would scarcely know the fruit,
So low has he sunk down and formed
A level with the brute,
Yes, there he dwells, a warning sign.
To all of those who nurse
That fatal bowl, that drugs the soul
And bids its joys disperse,
A Certain and unerring mark
Of drinks perpetual curse.
His mind is chaos dark, and void
Paralysed and numb;
Each valued word that once was heard,
Seems frozen up and dumb,
But yet he has one gleam of light
And babbles still of Rum,
Oh, that this warning could engrave
Some new and golden rule,
To write its chart upon each heart,
In life?s too busy school;
Ere there shall surge o?er ruin?s verge,
The tempter and his tool.
Then let your firm resolves stand firm,
To shun the Rum's abuse,
And not with moderation play
The reins both fast and loose,
And shun the sips that scorch the lips
Ere you perish in the use.

THE FOUNTAIN
H E A L T 11,


� jjf Jfoitnfain of
Old as the everlasting hills,
And richer than their wealth
Is that pure stream which gently fills
The fountain of our health ;
True as the shadow to the sun
It points to sunny goals,
Whose treasures may be grasp?d and won
By firm and ? temperate souls.
The fount that thousands seek in vain,
That hope so oft embowers,
That drops as sweetly as the rain
Does on summer flowers.
That fountain is not far to seek,
?Tis traced on Wisdom?s chart,
It blooms upon a maiden?s cheek
And leaps from heart to heart.
It has a beauty of its own,
A mirth that never dies,
When all its springs are kept in tone
By temperate supplies.
It has the melody of song
Whose music never jars,
But floats above all human wronp?,
And mingles with the stars.


We wish for riches, and would keep
A guard upon our wealth,
Forgetting that we cannot reap,
Without the grasp of health;
Until Intemperance firmly pinned
Has blurred us with its stain,
We find that we have sown the wind,
To reap the hurricane.
See pampered John, beguiled by use,
Feeds highly day by day;
And drinks the strong fermented juice,
Of that which brings decay.
And just as he begins to scout
His heritage of woe,
John dies some day, and leaves his gout,
A legacy to Joe.
Poor Bill is drunk, and James is sick,
And Jane begins to bawl,
And troubles seem to loom as fast,
As shadows on the wall.
Go! trace it to intemperate hurt,
A mild ancestral treat,
As sure a thing in life?s dessert,
As pudding after meat.
The husband, happy with his wife,
Must own the fountain?s truth,
Fcr he is cheerful all his life,
And she wears well her youth;
While all her children bloom around,
Their mother and their sire.
And share with them the healthy round,
And temperate desire.


16 ? Fountain oj Health ,
So Truth and Love must be combined,
And have a temperate aim,
Then shall we have a healthy mind
Linked to a healthy frame.
Our children?s voices then will bless
The homes that gave them birth,
And mingle with each fond caress
Their melodies of mirth.
Oh ! may this crystal fountain tide
Be used by all the world,
Its portals will be always wide,
Its banner never furled.
Go, seek it in the ? Templars ? cause,
And learn to shun the bowl
Which so infringes Nature?s laws,
And sears the human soul.
Then pledge with me this noble theme,
And may its pleasures bless
The thousands who float down th? stream
Of misery and distress;
And may the Templars ? be a guide
To those who seek for health,
And live to be their country?s pride,
A nation?s truest wealth.
