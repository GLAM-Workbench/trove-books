THE GROSVENOR HOTEL
amw'mca wmt,. srwjtr.
Overlooking the Far-famed and Beautiful Sydney Harbour
The Elysium of Tourists, Families, and Commercial Men
JOHN UOWAJf, €e»«ml Manager.
—
\
THE GROSVENOR stands on the most elevated site in Sydney, and surpasses
any other Hotel in the Southern Hemisphere in respect to the grandeur of its outlook.
It is within five minutes’ access of the Circular Quay, the and all the other
Intercolonial Companies’ wharves, the Public Offices, Parliamentary Buildings, Law Courts,
Botanic Gardens, and the chief business centres, and yet, from its unusual elevation, is free
from the noise and bustle of the city.
It has every convenience and accommodation offered by the highest-class European and
American hotels* and is furnished throughout in the most modern and sumptuous manner,
including one of the finest Billiard Tables in the colony.
. Having a mansard roof, a furnished Smoke Room is erected in the dome thereon, access
to which is quickly gained by an “ Otis ” Travelling Lift, and in which gentlemen can enjoy
the luxury of their favourite weed in full view of the enchanting scenery that surrounds.
YACHTING PARTIES ARRANGED FOR IN ONE HOUR.
Intercolonial or other Visitors to Sydney can secure Suites of Apartments, or
any other Accommodation, or full information respecting the same, by addressing the
General Manager.
Telephone No. 860.


Exhibits in % New Soutl\ Wales Court.
SUMMERFIELD AND COMPANY, 235, 237, and 239 Pitt
Street, Sydney. Clothing — Boys', Youths', and Men's; Ladies’
Tailor-made Costumes and Riding Habits; Felt and Paris Silk Hats —
Boys', Youths’, and Men's and Ladies' Riding Hats ; Boots and Shoes —
Ladies', Gentlemen's, and Children's; New South Wales Tweeds, Serges,
Flannels—manufactured by Vicars, Thompson and McDonald, and others.
No single firm exhibiting in the N.S.W. Court shows a greater variety of the
actual manufactures of the colony than is displayed by this well-known and highly
enterprising firm, Messrs Summerfield and Company, Pitt Street, Sydney.
When it is remembered that they show every kind and style of made-up clothing
suitable for boys of all ages, either in the nursery, the playground, or the church;
for youths at school, cricketing, or the university; for men of all degrees—workmen,
stockmen, business men, professional men, jockeys; tailor-made costumes of colonial
made materials for ladies, as well as exquisitely shaped riding habits—every garment
specially made for this Exhibition by their own staff on their own extensive premises—
all delivered in Melbourne within three weeks from the time they decided to exhibit ;
when all this is remembered it will readily be acknowledged they must be what they
claim to be—one of the very foremost firms in all Australia engaged in the woollen
clothing business.
Messrs. Summerfield and Company do not profess to be actual manufacturers
of anything beyond clothing, but their exhibits include other manufactures usually
associated with what are technically known as outfitting goods, hats of almost
every kind—certainly every kind made in this colony—shirts and boots of every
description, all of which are produced specially for them by the best makers, each
of their kind, in this colony.
Messrs. Summerfield and Company also show a very large variety of New
South Wales tweeds, which are so displayed that visitors not only can, but are
specially invited, to handle and critically examine them. These very sterling goods
were not got up regardless of cost for exhibition purposes, but were simply selected
from their ordinary stock, and such as they are daily in the habit of making into
garments for their numerous customers. It would be well for the pockets of
innumerable fathers of families if they would insist upon having both their own and
their sons’ every-day clothing made exclusively and always of New South Wales
made woollens, which for actual wear and tear are unquestionably the very best fabrics
produced in any part of the world, owing nothing to shoddy, nor anything to mere
finish and get-up.
Messrs. Summerfield and Company pay an average of £25,000 per annum
in wages alone, this sum being distributed over their various establishments in
Brisbane, Newcastle, and Maitland, as well as in Sydney—the firm employing local
labour in each instance.
Messrs. Summerfield and Company are ably represented in Sydney by two
members of the firm, Messrs. Frederic Jones and William Griffith, both
well known for many years in commercial circles as amongst the most resolute,
persevering, and successful men in Sydney.

BRADY’S REVOLVING SHUTTERS,
OFFICE AND WORKS:
DARLING STREET, PYRMONT BRIDGE ROAD, GLEBE,
s"2"iDnsrE"sr, 2sr.s.‘\7^-
Builders’ and Contractors’ News, July 21, 1888
AMONG the exhibitors at the Centennial Exhibition will
be Mr. E, Brady, manufacturer of Patent Revolving
Shutters in wood and in iron, for Dwellings, Shops, Banks, &c. Mr. Beady is sending a model
structure in wood, 10ft. square and 12ft. high, exhibiting four fronts, each fitted with a
distinct type of his Patent Shutter. A fifth specialty of Mr, Brady’s manufacture is shown
inside the chamber, and consists of three double-thickness panelled partitions, hung on
centre-pins, with iron rack-running gear overhead. These partitions (which are sound-
proof), being of a very handy width, are light and easily manageable, and can be slewed
round and stowed away up against the wall with ease and rapidity. Mr. Brady makes every
part of his Shutters on the premises, having set up special machinery for the purpose—that
used for dealing with the hoop-iron being very ingenious and accurate. Owing to the im-
provements covered by his patent, his Shutters are unusually strong, and their coiling and run-
ning gear very seldom gets out of order, if used with ordinary care. Mr. Brady was the first
man in New South Wales to manufacture every part of Revolving Shutters, both in wood and
in iron ; and his work and prices compare favourably with those of the imported articles.
Enoch Taylor & Co.,
BOOT & SHOE B(AMFACTDREI(S and IMPORTERS,
22 TORE STREET, SYDNEY, N.S.W.,
WITH
Branches and Representatives in Brisbane, Melbourne, Launceston, and Adelaide.
Njf HE Exhibit of this Firm has not been got up, as many are, to show what
“ wonderful Boots can be made in New South Wales, but as a sample only
JL of the Goods always held in Stock, and for which Orders can be executed
at a day’s notice.
The Boots are those in every-day use, and for which the Firm receive large
Orders from all Colonies in the Australasian Group and Pacific Islands, the
general excellence of same having gained the highest praise that can be attained.
It will be observed that every Boot has a number attached, the quoting of
which is sufficient to define any particular article. If required, E. T. & Co. will
forward a Descriptive Catalogue to any business address named.
It is worthy of mention that in the manufacture of Boots, Shoes, and Slippers,
the Firm employ a greater number of hands than any other in Australia ; and
when it is stated, and cannot be substantially contradicted, that they import English
and Continental Boots to more than double the value of any other single house
in the trade, some idea of the magnitude of their business is gained.

Althouoh other portions of the Australian continent
were visited by Europeans much earlier, it was not until the
year 1770 that the coast of what is now New South Wales
was discovered, when Captain Cook entered Botany Bay
in the “Endeavor” on the 28th April, landing on the
same day in company with Hr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and
others. On May 1, Forby Sutherland, one of the seamen
of the “Endeavor,” was buried near the watering place,
the south point being named Point Sutherland by Capt.
Cook from this incident. A few days later, on May 6,
Capt. Cook set sail from his anchorage in Botany Bay, and
at noon was abreast of a harbor which he named Port
Jackson, after Sir George Jackson, Secretary to the
Admiralty.
Coasting along the eastern seaboard, he finally reached
the northern extremity of the continent at Cape York,
and on the 21st August of the same year landed on a
small island in its vicinity, and took formal possession of
the whole eastern coast, from lat. 38° to lat. 10° 60' S., on
behalf of H.M. King George 111., at the same time be-
stowing on it the appellation of New South Wales.
It having been determined upon by the British Govern-
ment to send a number of convicts to Botany Bay, six
transports carrying 564 male and 192 female criminals,
and three storeships, sailed from Portsmouth on the 13th
May, 1787, accompanied by the warships “Sirius” and
“ Supply,” the whole expedition being under the command
of Capt. Phillip, of the “ Sirius,” who was authorized by
the Government to found a colony. The fleet of eleven
ships, with 1,030 persons, arrived in Botany Bay on the
20th January, 1788, having lost 32 souls by death during
the voyage, and six days later came to an anchor in
Port Jackson, when formal possession of the territory
was taken by Governor Phillip, and the British colors
hoisted. On the same day, the French ships “Astrolabe ”
and “Boussole,” commanded by La Perouse and L’Angle,
anchored in Botany Bay.
On the 13th February, Norfolk Island was established
as a dependency of the colony, under Lieut. King, after-
wards Capt. King and Governor of New South Wales and
Van Diemen’s Laud. The entire live stock of the colony
in May of this year was found to consist of 2 bulls, 8
cows, 1 horse, 3 mares, 3 colts, 29 sheep, 19 goats, 74 pigs,
5 rabbits, 18 turkeys, 29 geese, 35 ducks, and 210 fowls.
June 4 being His Majesty’s birthday, a grand dinner was
given by the Governor, when the name and boundaries
of the first county in the colony were fixed. It was called
Cumberland.
In June, 1789, the Hawkesbury Eiver was discovered
by Governor Phillip, in company with Oapts. Hunter,
Collins, Johnston, and others; and detachments of some
companies arrived which had been raised in England for
the service of the colony, and were called the New South
Wales Corps. In November, an observatory was com-
menced at the west point of Sydney Cove, together with
a residence for Lieut. Dawes, the officer in charge. The
first harvest in the colony was reaped at Rose Hill (Par-
ramatta) in December of this year.
On the 26th September, 1791, Lieut.-Govemor King,
who had left the colony for England the previous year,
arrived in the “ Gorgon ” in charge of the Territorial
Seal, and His Majesty’s gracious permission to grant
pardons, absolute or conditional. Shortly after, on
November 1, Governor Phillip was dangerously wounded
in the breast by a spear thrown by one of a party
of natives he was endeavoring to conciliate. On
February 24, 1792, Lieut.-Governor Grose arrived from
England, and on December 11, Governor Phillip departed
thither, handing over the Government of the colony to
the late arrival.
Meanwhile, building and agriculture were being carried
on apace, and in 1793 the Government purchased from
the settlers 1,200 bushels of wheat, this being the first
sale made. In December, 1794, Lieut.-Govemor Grose
sailed for England, handing over charge of the colony
to Captain Paterson, of the New South Wales Corps, who
was superseded by Governor Hunter on the arrival of the
latter on the 7th September, 1795. The chronicles of the
next year record the important discovery of coal at Port
Stephens. In August, 1797, the colonial ship “ Cumber-
land ” was piratically seized and carried off by convicts.
The three years 1796, 1797, and 1798, were remarkable
for successful explorations of both the coast and the
interior, Flinders and Bass distinguishing themselves
by their discoveries.
On Governor Hunter embarking for England on the
28th September, 1800, the Government of the colony
devolved upon Capt. Phillip Gidley King, late Lieut. -
Governor of Norfolk Island. Property of all kinds had
rapidly been increasing in value during the last three
years, and now reached such ridiculously high prices as
£9O for a horse, £BO for a cow, £7 10s. for a Cape sheep,
£1 Is. for a goose, 16s. per lb. fqr tea, &c., &c. These rates
were not caused by the scarcity of the commodities, but
through the movements of a ring of traders, mostly of
the official, civil, and military classes, who obtained the
control of most of the goods which arrived, as well as the
agricultural produce of the colony which was for dis-
posal, and were then able to demand arbitrary prices
from the consumer.
In 1803, the first Australian newspaper, the Sydney
Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser , was instituted
and published by Mr. George Howes. In 1804, there was an
imeute among the convicts at Castle Hill, which was put
down by the military, when many of the leading insurgents
were hanged. The year 1806 is memorable for a most
disastrous flood at the Hawkesbury on March 20, which
inundated nearly the whole of the settlement, many
persons perishing, and whole families being ruined. The
consequences to the colony were little short of a famine.
Food of all kinds rose rapidly in price, bread of very in-
ferior quality selling for 2s. 3d. per lb.
On the sth August of this year Captain William Bligh
arrived, and relieved Governor King of his rule, the
latter at once taking his departure for England. At this
time the population of New South Wales numbered
7,200, with 1,084 more at Norfolk Island ; the area of
land occupied was 48,855 acres, of which 12,860 acres were
under crop ; and the live stock consisted of 438 horses,
3,264 cattle, 16,501 sheep, 14,300 pigs, and 2,900 goats.
Governor Bligh’s tenure of office was marked by great
antagonism between himself and the wealthier class of
free settlers, as well as the military officers, and lie was
specially severe with Capt. Mao Arthur, the first introducer
of sheep to the colony for wool-growing. This state of
things finally led to the arrest and deposition of the
Governor on January 26,1808, by Major Johnston, com-
manding the 102nd or New South Wales Corps, who as
senior military officer then took upon himself the duties
of government. As soon as this had occurred, Capt.
Macarthur was appointed Colonial Secretary, and the
other responsible posts under Government were filled by
those who were favorable to the chief actors in this
small rebellion, the former occupants being superseded.
This condition of affairs only continued until July 28th,
when Lieut.-Colonel Foveaux returned from England
with the appointment of Lieut.-Governor, and at once
superseded Major Johnston. Not wishing to identify
himself with either party, Foveaux simply carried on the
government of the colony until Colonel Pearson arrived
from Van Diemen’s Land on January Ist, 1809, and
superseded him. He also kept aloof from the late party
quarrels, deeming it wiser to await the instructions of
the Home Government, and meanwhilekeepiug Governor
Bligh under arrest at Government House, in default of
his accepting the offer of the command of the “ Porpoise,”
and agreeing to proceed to England with the utmost
despatch. On the 4th February, Governor Bligh signified
his willingness to leave in the “ Porpoise ” and sail for
England as demanded; and the following month saw
the departure of Major Johnston for England, to meet
any charges that might be laid against him, and he was
accompanied by Captain Macarthur. Bligh, instead of
sailing directly for England, went to Yan Diemen’s
Laud, with the view of arousing popular feeling in his
favor; but finding himself thwarted by the Lieut-
Govemor, Colonel Collins, continued to hover off the
coast until the arrival of Colonel Lachlan Macquarie as
Governor on December 28th of the same year, accom-
panied by the first battalion of the 73rd Regiment, under
the command of Colonel O’Connell, who had been ap-
pointed Lieut.-Govemor.
The new Governor’s first work was to re-instate all the
officers who had been removed when Bligh was placed
under arrest, and to order the officers and men of the
New South Wales Corps to hold themselves in readiness


to proceed to England. Despatches were sent inviting
Bligh to return to Sydney, and in a few weeks he did so,
when he was received according to his naval rank of
commodore. He finally left the colony on the 7th May,
and the result of the enquiry at home was that Lieut.-
Colonel Johnston was cashiered the service, and Captain
Macarthur debarred from returning to the colony for
eight years, for the part which they respectively took in
connection with the deposition of Bligh.
Under Governor Macquarie’s rule, the material pro-
gress of New South Wales was very great. Roads and
bridges were constructed with vigor, the work of ex-
ploration was carried out in an able and steady manner,
and Sydney was transformed from a mere collection of
huts into a busy town.
In 1813, the expenditure of the colony amounted to
£235,000, and in 1814 to £231,362, which was reduced to
£150,000 in 1815. In this year (1813) the first successful
attempt was made by Blaxland, Wentworth, and Lawson
to cross the Blue Mountains, which had hitherto baffled
all efforts in this direction. They reached a point about
14 mile beyond what is now known as Katoomba, the
spot being marked by a tree, which is still in existence. In
this year also, a market and half-yearly fair were estab-
lished in Parramatta, and in 1816, the foundation-stone of
the Macquarie tower and lighthouse was laid by the
Governor ; while the Bank of New South Wales was
established on April Bth of the following year. The
Benevolent Society of New South Wales w r as brought into
existence on June 4th, 1818, and in the same year the Go-
vernor visited Newcastle on a tour of inspection. In
1819, the Sydney Savings Bank was established, and
the country west of the Blue Mountains received the
name of Westmoreland. In 1820, the foundation-stone
of the Georgian Public School was laid by Governor
Macquarie, who also visited Bathurst, and marked and
named Campbelltown on the Ist December.
The population of Sydney had risen this year to up-
wards of 7,000, about a third of the entire population of
the colony; and several thriving manufactures, such as
woollen cloths, earthenware, salt, candles, soap, hats, &c.,
were being carried on there. The next year saw the
opening of the Sydney Benevolent Asylum by the
Governor on the Ist October, after which he sailed
on a tour of inspection to the northern settlements
on the Ist November. Some idea may be formed
of the prosperity and increase of the colony by
the following returns for October, 1821, which include
Van Diemen’s Land as part of New South Wales :
Population, including the military, 38,778 ; cattle,
102,939 ; sheep, 290,158; pigs, 33,906 ; horses, 4,664;
land cleared and in tillage, 32,267 acres.
Six days after the departure of Governor Macquarie
from Sydney, Major-General Sir Thomas Brisbane, K.C.8.,
arrived, and his commission as Governor of New South
Wales and its dependencies was published and read in the
capital on the Ist December, 1821. Macquarie and
his family did not, however, take their departure for
England until February 12th, 1822, the late Governor
employing his time meanwhile in making a tour of the
colony. Major-General Sir Thomas Brisbane, the sixth
Governor of New South Wales, entered upon his duties
under most favorable circumstances. He found the
colony in a flourishing condition, its productions rapidly
increasing, and its population receiving accessions of men
of capital and energy almost daily, while his advent was
hailed by the colonists of all classes with the greatest
satisfaction. Unfortunately, however, he showed himself
to be totally unfitted to cope with the exigencies of a
young and thriving colony, in which there were two
classes bitterly antagonistic to each other, and each
striving to gain the ear of the Governor by every ex-
pedient possible. On the one side he was beset by a petty
oligarchy of exclusives, who regarded themselves as the
only persons whose claims to grants of land, convict
labor, or social recognition by the Governor ought to be
considered at all, while on the other side he was worried
by the demands for legal rights and social recognition on
the part of numbers of wealthy emancipists, backed up
as they were by the public voice, whenever the last
could make itself heard. So uncongenial did Sir Thomas
Brisbane consider his position in Sydney, that he made
Parramatta his head-quarters, where he spent most of
his time superintending the erection of an observatory,
and devoting himself to scientific pursuits, much to the
satisfaction of the small class of exclusives above-men-
tioned, who now did pretty much as they liked.
On the 13th August, 1823, the Australian Religious
Tract Society was instituted at Sydney, and on the
29th of the same month, the 3rd Regment (the Buffs)
arrived in the capital; while the Royal Veteran Com-
pany was disbanded on the the 24th September.
Governor Brisbane’s administration, however, was
marked by events of the deepest importance to the
colonists and their descendants—events, the effects of
which will continue to be felt for ages. These were as
follows :—the concession of the first instalment of self-
government by the institution of a Legislative Council
on August 11, 1824; the formal acknowledgment of the
liberty of the press on October 1 of the same year ; the
discovery of an overland route to Port Phillip, and the
formation of settlements at Moreton Bay and other
places ; and the commencement of a steady flow of emi-
gration from the United Kingdom, owing, in a great
degree, to the steps taken by a native of the colony, Mr.
William Charles Wentworth, to disseminate in England
information relative to the condition and prospects of
Australia.
On March 6,1824, Erancis Porbes, Esq., the first Cuief
Justice of New South Wales, arrived in Sydney, and the
48th Regiment embarked for Madras, while one month
later Sax Banister, Esq., the first Attorney-General, and
William Balcombe, Esq., the first Colonial Treasurer,
reached the capital. August 1 saw the arrival of the
first Solicitor-General, Mr. John Stephen, as well as that
of Mr. William Carter, the first Master in Chancery ; on
the 18th, the Rev. Thomas Reddall was appointed
Director-General of Public Schools, and on the 28th of
the same month, Mr. G. G. Mills, Registrar of the Supreme
Court, arrived in Sydney. On October 14, the Austra-
lian newspaper was first published, and during this
year an exploring expedition towards the south was
undertaken by Messrs. Hume and Hovell, who penetrated
to Port Phillip and subsequently returned.
Sir Thomas Brisbane’s administration lasted somewhat
less than four years, and, early in December 1825, he
sailed for England, after having resigned the reins of
government into the hands of Colonel Stewart, of the
Buffs. The Returns for this year for the colony show a
Revenue of £71,682 ; and Expenditure of £82,000 ; value
of Imports, £300,000 ; population, 33,675 ; sheep, 237,622;
cattle, 134,519; land under cultivation, 45,514 acres;
wool exported, 411,600 lb. In whaling alone, the mer-
chants of Sydney had this year nearly thirty ships en-
gaged, whilst many others were employed in the island
trade, and the pearl and seal fisheries.
On the 18th December, 1825, the seventh Governor of
New South Wales arrived in the person of Lieut.-General
Ralph Darling, relieving Colonel Stewart of the position
he had held for about three weeks. The new Governor
inaugurated his tenure of office by purging all the de-
partments of the public services of the emancipist and
convict elements which had been introduced by Mac-
quarie, and continued to a considerable extent by iSir
Thomas Brisbane. This measure, of course, raised up a
bitter feeling among the large class of emancipists, and
the Governor and his policy were assailed in very strong
terms in the columns of the “ Australian ” newspaper,
whilst the organ of the Government lauded both to the
skies.
The extraordinary success which had attended those
engaged in pastoral pursuits served to attract the envy
and emulation of both other colonists and new arrivals,
the consequence being that a perfect mania set in for
the possession of live stock. Unfortunately for the
speculators for rapid fortunes, the weather was beyond
their control, and, from the close of 1826, a drought of
three years’ duration commenced, which caused a finan-
cial crash of the most disastrous character. Distress and
ruin fell upon scores of respectable people who had been
considered wealthy but a few months before. Owing to
these untoward circumstances, the free male adults who
arrived in 1828 and 1829 did not exceed 260 in each year,
whilst the number fell in 1830 to 166. In 1831, again,
there was a slight increase to 185. But, unfortunately
for the colony, it so happened that these years which
brought so few free emigrants saw the introduction of a
larger number of convicts than had ever been previously
sent in a like time ; fully 3,000, of whom five-sixths
were men, being poured into the country.
In 1828, an expedition of discovery left Sydney in
charge of Captain Charles Sturt and Mr. Hamilton
Hume, and on the 4th of February of the next year
reached the bank of a fine river, which was named the


Darling. A few months after the return of this band of
explorers, Captain Sturt set out on another expedition,
accompanied this time by Mr. George Macleay, as second
in command, and struck the Murrumbidgee, which they
sailed down until its junction with the Lachlan was
reached, and finally until they were shot into the broad
and noble Murray Eiver, which they so named after the
then Secretary to the Colonies, Sir George Murray.
They at length found themselves on the shores of En-
counter Bay, and not being able to reach St. Vincent’s
Gulf, where succor awaited them, they determined to
retrace their route by the Murray, and started on their
return journey on the 14th January, 1830, reaching
Sydney on the 25th May following, after having under-
gone almost insuperable privations and labors.
The introduction of steam navigation into Australian
waters took place in 1831, when the steamer “ Sophia
Jane,” 154 tons register, was brought out from England
by Lieutenant Biddulph, 8.N., and two small colonial-
built steamers, named the “ Surprise ” and “ William the
Fourth,” were launched. Shortly afterward, the first
•olonial steam company was formed, under the title of
the Australian Steam Conveyance Company. In 1831,
also, the system of free grants to private individuals was
finally put a stop to by orders from the Imperial Govern-
ment, by which in future no lands were to be disposed of
except by public auction, at an upset price of not less
than ss. per acre. The population of the colony this year
was 51,155; export of wool, 1,401,284 lb; value of total
exports, £324,168; imports, £490,162; Expenditure,
£103,228 ; Revenue, £121,066.
On the 22nd October, 1831, Governor Darling em-
barked for Canton, on his way to England, his term
of office having expired, and was succeeded by
Major-General Richard Bourke, who arrived in Port
Jackson on the 2nd December following, Colonel Patrick
Lindsay having assumed the office of Lieut.-Governor
pending his arrival. During this year, Major (after-
wards Sir Thomas) Mitchell, the Surveyor-General, un-
dertook an expedition to the northward in search of a
great river, said to exist in this direction, and reached
the rivers Gwydir, Namoi, and Peel. He set out
from Sydney on the 24th November, his drays and
men having preceded him some time before to-
wards the river Hunter. Three hundred miles had to
be traversed ere the expedition would pass the line to
which the squatter population had already extended
itself in that direction. In due course he reached
the Hunter, and overtook his party of about fifteen
souls, which consisted of convicts with the exception of
a soldier or two. Besides these he had two gentlemen,
assistant surveyors, to accompany him, Mr. White and
Mr. Finch. In addition to a supply of muskets, pistols,
and sky-rockets, Mitchell says:—“ Of tilted carts we had
two, so constructed that they could be drawn either by
one or two horses. They were also so light that they
could be moved across difficult passes by the men alone.
Three stronger carts or drays were loaded with our stock
of provisions, consisting of flour, pork (which had been
boned in order to diminish the bulk as much as possible),
tea, tobacco, sugar and soap. We had, besides, a number
of pack-saddles for the draught animals, that, in case of
necessity, we might be able to carry forward the loads
by such means. Several pack-horses were also attached
to the party. I had been induced to prefer wheel-
carriages for an explorating journey, first, from the level
nature of the interior country; secondly, from the
greater facility and certainty they afforded of starting
early, and as the necessity for laying all our stores in
separate loads on animals’ backs could thus be avoided.
The latter method being further exposed to interruptions
on the way by the derangement of loads, or galling the
animals’ backs, one inexperienced man being thus likely
to impede the progress of the whole party. For the
navigation of rivers, two portable boats of canvas had
been prepared by Mr. Eager, of the King’s dockyards at
Sydney. We carried the canvas only with models of the
ribs, and tools, having carpenters who could complete
them as occasion required.” Arrived at the Peel River,
Mitchell engaged a black guide at the last squatter’s
station, and then crossing over to the further bank,
entered on the yet unexplored region, the Peel stretching
away westward, its course traced by the lines of large
blue gum-trees. On the 16th December they reached
the Namoi, and ranged along the northern boundaries
of the Liverpool Plains. Having in vain attempted a
course northwards, past a rocky hill which they called
the Pic of Tangulda, and having passed a small river
which they named the Maule, they returned to the
Namoi, and, leaving the cattle and drays under a guard
at a camp, embarked on this river in their canvas boats,
only to discover their total unfitness for sailing on Aus-
tralian waters. They were quickly stove in by snags, so
that the party was compelled to send back for the cattle
and drays. Following the course of the river in a north-
westerly direction, they passed the western extremity of
the Nandewar Range on their right, and then holding a
northern route, they reached the river Gwydir on the
9th January, 1832. Determining to follow down the
Gwydir to its junction, they set out again a week later,
after Major Mitchell had explored the way some dis-
tance on horseback. Mr. Pinch, who was far behind,
bringing up fresh additions to their stores, was left to
find his way by the tracks of their wheels. Hastening
forward north-west, Mitchell’s party soon came upon
another deep and rapid river, the Karaula; crossing
which Mitchell went on with a reconnoitering band to
trace the course of this new river. After about twenty
miles of travel, they came upon the Gwydir again, falling
into a large river, which they at once recognised as the
Darling, or rather in that latitude, the Barwon.
“ Thus,” says Mitchell, “ I now overlooked, from a bank
of seventy feet high, a river as broad as the Thames at
Putney, on which the goodly waves, perfectly free from
fallen timber, danced in full liberty. Thus termi-
nated our excursion to explore this last-discovered
stream. Into this river we had traced the Gwydir ; the
junction of the Namoi also could not be far distant; and
even that of the Castlereagh was only about seventy
miles to the south-west.” Intending to proceed still
farther north in the exploration of the country, they re-
turned to the camp, where they were met with news
which completely changed their intentions. They found
that a party of natives had been there, who were much
inclined to steal, and had evidently been watching the
expedition ever since it had entered the district. Shortly
after their return, Mr. Finch, who had been bringing up
further supplies, arrived, and, as Major Mitchell says,
announced that “ two of his men had been killed, and all
the supplies, cattle, and equipments had fallen into the
hands of the natives. This catastrophe occurred at the
Ponds of Gorolei, beyond Mount Frazer, which Mr.
Finch had reached after having been distressed, even
more than our party had been at the same place, for
want of water. This privation had first occasioned the
loss of his horse and several other animals, so that his
party had been able to convey the supplies to the ponds,
by carrying forward from the dry camp only a portion
at a time on the remaining bullocks. Mr. Finch at
length succeeded in thus lodging all the stores at these
ponds, but being unable to remove them farther without
the assistance of my cattle, he left them there, and pro-
ceeded forward on foot along our track with one man,
in expectation of falling in with my party at no great
distance in advance. After ascertaining that we were
not so near as he hoped, and having reached the
Gwydir, and traced our route along its banks, until he
again recognised Mount Frazer, he returned at the end
of the second day, when he found neither his tents nor
his men to receive him, but a heap of various articles,
such as bags, trunks, harness, tea and sugar, canisters,
&c., piled over the dead bodies of his men, whose legs
he at length perceived projecting. The tents had been
cut in pieces, tobacco and other articles lay about, and
most of the flour had been carried off, although some
bags still remained in the cart. The two bullocks con-
tinued feeding near. This spectacle must have been
most appalling to Mr. Finch, uncertain, as he must have
been, whether the eyes of the natives were not then upon
him, while neither he nor his man possessed any means
of defence. Taking a piece of pork and some flour, he
hastened from the dismal scene, and, by travelling all
day, and passing the nights without fire, he provi-
dentially escaped the natives, and had at length reached
our camp. Thus terminated my hopes of exploring the
country beyond the Karaula, and I could not but feel
thankful for the providential circumstance of Mr.
Finch’s arrival, at the very moment when I was about
to proceed on that undertaking, trusting that I should
find, on returning to this depot, the supplies which I
expected him to bring. We had now, on the contrary,
an additional demand on our much-exhausted stock of
provisions. The season when the rain might be expected
was approaching, and we had behind us 200 miles of


country subject to inundation, without a hill to which
we could, in such a case, repair. The soil was likely to
become impassable after two days’ rain, and our cart
wheels were represented by the carpenters to be almost
unserviceable. These considerations, and the hostile
disposition of the natives in our rear, not only deterred
me from crossing the Karaula, but seemed to require my
particular attention homewards.” As they proceeded
homewards, Mitchell saw fires kindled, and strong bodies
of natives again and again came into view. On arriving
at Finch’s camp, they found a single cart and the two
dead bodies of their companions now in a high state of
decomposition. The bullocks were no longer there ; the
natives had revisited the camp, and earned away the
remainder of the flour and the canvas of the tent. The
bodies lay under a heap of saddles, yokes, harness, pack-
saddles, trunks, canisters, &c. The savages appeared
to have been ignorant of the uses of tea, sugar, and
tobacco, as these were scattered about, destroyed by the
late rains. A spade, a steelyard, and a hammer were
left, although iron had been so much in request that
they had drawn one of the iron pins of the cart. Having
buried the bodies, conscious that they were being
watched by the natives, smoke arising from various parts
around, they continued their route. The rains having
set in, the plains thence to the Namoi were deep
in mud, and made it difficult to advance, but on the 26th
February they reached that river, and crossed it on the
28th. The remaining distance to Sydney was through a
tolerably well-settled country.
Wine was also received in Sydney from the Bathurst
district, made from the grapes grown there, and the coal
works at Newcastle were opened in December, 1831.
In 1833, the right of emancipists to sit as jurors was
legally determined in their favor. In April, 1834, new
assignment regulations were published, resulting in
the overthrow of a monopoly by which, heretofore,
the proprietors and lessees of large tracts of land had
engrossed a disproportionate amount of convict labor,
to the prejudice of those of smaller means. During the
next year, Sir Thomas Mitchell set out at the head of
another exploring party, and reached the river Darling.
One of his followers, Mr. Richard Cunningham, botanist,
was murdered by blacks after having lost himself in
the bush, whilst in pursuit of those products of nature
which enriched his science. In 1835, also, seventeen
counties were proclaimed, and the agitation which had
existed for some time in favour of Representative Gov-
ernment greatly increased. Governor Bourke was
Knighted in the course of this year, Archdeacon Brough-
ton created Bishop of Australia, and the Right Rev. John
Bede Folding, Bishop of Hiero-C;esarea and Yicar-
Apostolio of the Australian colonies, arrived in Sydney.
On the 15th March, 1836, Sir Thomas Mitchell started
on a second exploration of the Darling, from which he
subsequently returned on the 3rd November following,
having discovered the river Glenelg and added largely to
the previous knowledge of the country generally. In
this year the Legislative Council passed the important
Church Act of New South Wales, by which religious
equality was firmly and permanently' established in the
colony.
In September, 1837, Sir Richard Bourke’s resignation,
which he had previously tendered, was accepted with
deep regret by the Imperial Government, and Sir George
Gipps became his successor, arriving in Sydney on the
23rd February, 1838, Colonel Snodgrass having under-
taken the duties of Lieut.-Governor in the Interim. To
show their appreciation of Governor Bourke's many and
important public services, the colonists determined to
erect a statue of him. and large subscriptions at once
poured in for the purpose. 1837 saw the completion of
the aqueduct from Botany to Sydney, commenced in
1827, and showed a total population of 76,000, of which
55,000 were free, and 21,000 convicts. In 1838, reporters
for the press and the public generally'were first admitted
at the proceedings of the Legislative Council, which were
now published at large in the newspaper’s ; while the
system of assigning convicts terminated with the close of
the year.
The year 1839 opened with the publication of the
report of the Parliamentary Committee on Transporta-
tion, wherein it was recommended that the transportation
of convicts to New South Wales and the settled districts
of Van Diemen’s Land should cease ; that convicts should
only be sent to settlements where there were no free
people, and that such settlements should be used ex-
clusively for this class of criminals; and that convicts
who were punished abroad should be compelled to leave
the settlement to which they had been sent, after the ex-
piry of their sentence, the Government furnishing them
with the means of doing so. At the same time that a
section of the colonists advocated the continuance of
transportation, it was generally considered and petitioned
that one-half the expenses of the maintenance and
coercion of the convicts should be contributed by the
Home Government.
During this year Governor Gipps propounded a scheme
of public instruction, based on the “ Irish National Sys-
tem,” and a sum of .-£3,000 was placed on the Estimates
for the purpose of carrying the same into effect. A
severe drought prevailed in the colony, and the neces-
saries of life became so scarce and dear, that a public
subscription was raised with which to purchase food,
and distribute the same amongst the poorest and most
distressed classes. Bushranging was very rife, and
statistics showed an increase of crime to the extent of
fifty per cent. In the commencement of 1840, Mr. John
Kennedy Hume, resident in the Yass district, was shot
dead in cold blood by one of a party of bushrangers, who
were afterwards attacked by a number of settlers,
headed by Mr. Henry O’Brien, when some were shot, and
the principal of the gang taken prisoner and executed at
Goulburn. In this year an Act was passed appointing a
Commission under the title of a Court of Claims, to
revise the claims put forward by some individuals to
large tracts of land in New Zealand, the results of which
were that the claimants were either found to be entitled ■
only to a small fraction of the area they asserted j
they had purchased, or, in some instances, the claims :
were altogether disallowed. The colony was also divided i
into three districts; the northern, comprising all the
country in the neighborhood of Moreton Bay; the
middle, consisting of New South Wales proper; and the I
southern, contained in the newly-settled district of Port
Phillip, where, moreover, the price of land was fixed at
£1 per acre without competition, whilst in the other two
the minimum was twelve shillings, with sales by auction.
The entire revenue of the colony was £682,473 ; total
disbursements, £561,023 ; value of imports, £3,014,189;
exports, £1,399,692 ; while 17 vessels, with a total
carrying capacity of 1,196 tons, were built and registered j
in the colony during the year.
In 1841, the Governor announced at the opening of
the Council that, henceforth, New Zealand formed a sepa-
rate Government. A general census was completed in
the course of this year, from which it was shown that
the total population of New South Wales, including the
province of Port Phillip, was 130,856 ; of which number
87,298 were males, and 43,558 females.
In February, 1842, a petition to the Imperial Govern-
ment prayingfor representative government, was adopted
at a meeting in Sydney, presided over by the sheriff,
and on the 11th April following, the statue of Governor
Bourke was inaugurated in the presence of a vast public as-
semblage of all classes. In the following month, the Legis-
lative Council assembled, during the sitting of which a
bill was passed incorporating the town of Sydney, when
the qualification of voters was made to consist in the
occupancy of a house or warehouse of the annual valnej
of £25, for twelve months preceding the enrolment, no,
person being entitled to vote, however, who was not a
resident householder in the city, or within seven miles of
its boundaries. The qualification of an alderman, coun-
cillor, auditor, or assessor was real estate of the value of
£l,OOO. or property rated in the annual value of £5O. In
November the municipal elections took place, the first!
aldermen chosen for the city being Robert Owen, John-
Hoskiug, George Allen. Thomas Broughton, Francis
Mitchell, and J. R. Wilshire, of whom Hosking was
elected Mayor. The Richmond River was* discovered in
this year, and the term “ squatter ” was first used in its
present significance as applying to those owners of ex-
tensive flocks and herds who rented lauds from the Crown 5
for grazing purposes. Tobacco was also first manufac-
tured in the colony. An earthquake shock was expe-
rienced in various parts of the colony on the 28ti
October, and towards the close of the year the new Imperial!
Act, regulating the disposal of waste lands, was received
at Sydney. By this measure the auction system was
universally brought into operation; the lauds were
divided into town, suburban, and country lots ; and £l
per acre was fixed as the minimum price for country lots
in all parts of the colony.


On the first day of 1843 the new Act to provide for the
Government of New South Wales, whereby the right of
representation was conceded to the colonists, was re-
ceived in Sydney, having passed the Imperial Parlia-
ment and received the Boyal assent the previous July.
The new act provided for the establishment of a Council,
to consist of thirty-six members, of whom twenty-four
were to be elected by the people, including six members
for Port Phillip, and of the remainder, six were to be
Government officers, and the other six Crown nominees.
On the Ist August, the first Representative Legislature
of New South Wales met, when Alexander Macleay was
elected Speaker. The monetary distress which had for
some time weighed down the energies of the colony, was
now increased by the failure of the Bank of Australia, and a
select committee of the Council reported that there were
thirteen hundred mechanics and laborers out of employ-
ment in Sydney alone. At this critical time, Sirs. Caroline
Chisholm commenced her philanthropical labors in aid of
the poorer classes, by making arrangements for locating
thirty families at Illawarra, on land granted to them on
clearing leases, the proprietor of the soil supplying the
tenants with provisions for the first five months of their
occupancy.
The year 1844 saw the commencement of the contest
between the Executive Government and the squatters,
the former having issued a proclamation in April, alter-
ing the terms on which licenses to occupy Crown Lands
were granted, and declaring that parties occupying
stations in separate districts, notwithstanding that the
same might be contiguous, should not only be required,
in future, to take out separate; licenses for each such dis-
trict, but also to pay the established fee of £lO for the
same. A meeting of squatters was then held at the
Royal Hotel, for the purpose of protesting against the
proposed regulations, when a society was formed under
the designation of the “ Pastoral Association of New
South Wales,” to secure the due protection of the pasto-
ral interests ; and at the annual meeting of the Council,
Wentworth opened the subject of Colonial Grievances.
In the course of the Session, the Hon. Francis Scott,
M.P. for Roxburghshire, was appointed parliamentary
agent to represent the colony in the House of Commons,
at a salary of £5OO a year. During the year the first
Jewish Synagogue in Sydney was opened and consecrated.
Sir James Dowling, the Chief Justice, died, and was suc-
ceeded by Sir Alfred Stephen. The government of Nor-
folk Island passed from New South Wales to Van Die-
men’s Land, and the value of the exports exceeded that
of the imports for the first time in the history of the
colony.
In September of this year, Dr. Ludwig Leichhardt
undertook an expedition of exploration from Moreton
Bay to Port Essington, in the course of which the rivers
Mackenzie, Cape, Burdekin, Clarke, Lynd, Condamino,
Dawson, Van Diemen, Macarthur, Wickham, and Roper,
were met witli and named, the little baud of explorers
finally reaching Port Essington on the 17th December,
1845, and returning to Sydney by sea on the 29th March,
1846, with the loss of one man, Gilbert, who had been mor-
tally speared in an attack on the camp by aborigines on
the 28th June previous. To reward the explorers, a
public subscription amounting to more than £1,600 was
raised, which was supplemented by a vote of £l,OOO by
the Legislative Council, and all classes pressed forward
to testify their joy at the re-appearance of men whose
safety had long been doubted. At the latter end of 1845,
another campaign was undertaken for the purpose of
further exploring the Australian wilds, and Sir Thomas
Mitchell was, for the fourth time, chosen to lead the
Party. During the thirteen months’ absence of the expe-
dition, Sir Thomas penetrated so far north as lat.
24° 12' 37", reaching the banks of a fine river, which he
judged to fall into the Gulf of Carpentaria, and naming
the same the Victoria, in honor of Her Majesty. He
brought to light a vast extent of new and fertile country,
traversed the Fitzroy Downs, and increased his know-
ledge of the waterways of the continent by exploring the
rivers Barwon, Narran, Balonne, Culgoa, Maranoa, Sal-
vator, and Claude.
In May, 1846, a company was formed for constructing
railways from Sydney to Goulbum, to the Hawkesbury,
and to the Nepean, under the title of the Great Southern
and Western Railway Company, the capital of which was
to be one million, in fifty thousand shares, three-fourths
of which were to be reserved for sale to British capital-
ists, in the same mouth the Legislative Council met for
the despatch of business, and rejected the Crown Lands
Bill, when the Governor prorogued the House till the
25th August, meanwhile retiring from the colony and
the contest on the 10th July, when he was presented
with a farewell address, bearing five thousand seven
hundred and fifty-five signatures. Thus retired a
Governor, a worthy successor to him who preceded him.
Gipps was succeeded on the 2nd August by the new
Governor, Sir Charles Fitzroy, shortly after whose
advent the question of transportation was brought before
the Council, a despatch having been received by the
Governor from the Secretary of State, in which it was
proposed to renew the introduction of convicts. Whilst
the Council was in favor of the measure, the prevailing
sentiment throughout the country was one of detesta-
tion ; and anti-transportation meetings and memorials
were got up all over the colony, so that, finally in the
month of August, 1847, Cowper, in his place in the
Council, carried a resolution by eleven to seven, dis-
approving of a return to the system of transportation
and assignment. In July, 1847, the new squatting
regulations were received in the colony, by which the
public lands were divided into three classes—the settled,
the intermediate, and the unsettled. The settled lands
comprised the nineteen original counties, together with
the counties of East and West Macquarie, all land within
twenty-five miles of Melbourne, fifteen miles of Geelong,
and ten of several other towns, including Bathurst, all
lands within three miles of the sea, and within two miles
of the Glenelg, the Clarence and the Richmond rivers.
The intermediate districts comprised, with the exception
of those parts included in the settled areas, the counties
of Bourke, Normanby. Grant, and Auckland, the district
of Gippsland, and any counties which might be fixed
and proclaimed before the 31st December, 1848. The
unsettled districts comprehended all the remaining por-
tions of New South Wales. The Governor was empowered
to grant, in the unsettled districts, leases for pastoral
purposes for terms not exceeding fourteen years ; in the
intermediate districts, for eight years ; and in the settled,
for one year, subject to different provisions in each of
the three cases. In October of this year, Dr. Leichhardt
set out for Moreton Bay to proceed on that expedition of
exploration from which he never returned, his intention
being to endeavor to reach the Swan River In Western
Australia; and on the 7th December, Lady Mary Fitz-
roy, the wife of the Governor, was thrown out of her
carriage at Parramatta, and killed almost instantane-
ously. The population of the colony was 205,009; number
of acres under crop, 164,784; value of imports, £1,982,022;
and of exports, £1,870,046.
In the early part of 1848, Edward Kennedy returned to
Sydney, after completing the exploration of the Victoria,
one of the rivers discovered by Sir Thomas Mitchell in
his last expedition. He traced it as far as lat. 27° 66',
lon. 142°, where the stream became lost amid sandy,
barren ground. His party had been absent about twelve
months. He set out again about the beginning of May,
at the head of an expedition, with the view of exploring
Cape York Peninsula, for which purpose he went by sea
to Rockingham Bay, and on the Ist June commenced his
land journey towards Cape York. Early beset with the
impracticability of the country, he had first to leave part
of his supplies behind, next part of his men, and finally
attempted to make his way to Port Albany in company
with one black named Jacky Jacky. When in sight of
the sea in the neighborhood of this settlement, he was
attacked by blacks and speared so badly that he died
within an hour or two, Jacky Jacky finding his way to
Port Albany thirteen days later. Of the expedition, only
two white survivors were rescued, Mr. Carron, the
naturalist, and another, who had been left at Weymouth
Bay by Kennedy in his onward march.
On the Bth June, 1849, the “Harkaway” arrived in
Sydney with two hundred and twelve male convicts on
board, when an immense anti-convict demonstration was
made at the Circular Quay, and a protest drawn up for
presentation to the Governor, in which it was requested
that the prisoners in the “Harkaway” be immediately
sent back to England. Finding the Governor deaf to
this application, another meeting was called, when a
petition to the Queen was adopted, praying that the
Right Hon. Earl Grey, Secretary of State for the colonies,
might be removed from Her Majesty's Councils, and that
the government of the colony might bs carried on by
Ministers chosen from, and responsible to, the colonists
themselves.


On the 4th September, a bill to incorporate the Sydney
Railway Company was read a second time. In April,
1850, a despatch was received by the Governor from the
Secretary of State, in which he was informed that no
more convicts, after those which were already on the
way, would be sent to any part of New South Wales, in
consequence of the address from the Legislative Council.
During the session of the Council, which was prorogued
in October, the act for the establishment of the Sydney
University was passed, a project of which Wentworth
had been the originator, and in which he was, from the
initiation, the prime mover .In July, the first sod of the
Sydney and Goulburn Railway was turned by the Hon.
Mrs. Keith Stuart, the Governor’s daughter. The
Governor became very unpopular towards the close of
the year, when his despatches to the Imperial Govern-
ment on the anti-transportation demonstrations were
seen by the colonists, and further large and enthusiastic
meetings were held to protest against any further influx
of criminals to any part of the colony. In December,
the “Act for the better government of Her Majesty's
Australian Colonies” was received in Sydney, in which
Port Phillip, now named Victoria, was granted colonial
independence.
At the final session of the Legislative Council in 1851,
the Electoral Bill was passed, by which the new appor-
tionment of members was effected, the number of the
representatives being fixed at thirty-six, shortly after
which, on the 2nd May, the first representative legisla-
ture of New South Wales came to a termination after an
existence of eight, years. This last month was also
remarkable for an event which was destined to effect a
complete revolution in all the interests and relations of
the colony. Edward Hammond Hargraves at this time
succeeded in discovering gold in the vicinity of Bathurst.
The consequent rush to the auriferous regions, and the
general unsettling of the population, affected the price of
provisions, and in a fortnight flour rose from £2O to £3O
per ton. Towards the end of Juno, the first gold to the
value of £3,500, was sent home in one ship. The effect
of this discovery on the question of transportation was
naturally to strengthen the hands of those inimical to
the measure, inasmuch as, doubtless, hundreds of men in
the United Kingdom would not hesitate to undergo a
brief term of punishment in order to find themselves
later on settled in a comitry where the precious metal
was to be found in large quantities ; and when, in July,
a report was received of a recent speech of Earl Grey in
the House of Lords in favour of a continuance of the
measure, the Council of the Australian League met and
drew up a petition to the Queen, giving forcible expres-
sion to the wishes of the colonists, and praying her to
dismiss that nobleman from her Councils.
At the inauguration of the new Legislature on the 14th
October, Fitzroy, in his opening speech, announced that
he had been appointed Governor-General over all Her
Majesty’s Australian possessions. On the 10th Decem-
ber, the Governor-General transmitted to the Council a
copy of a despatch which he bad just received from the
Secretary of State, forwarding an Order in Council re-
voking, so far as New South Wales was concerned, the
Order in Council of the 4th September, 1841, appointing
]daces to which felons and other offenders might be con-
veyed. The distemper, known as the “Cumberland
disease,” made great ravages among the cattle in the
course of this year. In March, the first railway contract
was accepted, being for the substructure of a portion of
the line between Ashfield and Haslem’s Lock. With re-
gard to the discovery of gold, the Rev. W. B. Clarke, the
well-known geologist, proved that he had at various
times publicly stated that the colony contained aurife-
rous deposits, and claimed the credit of being the
first to announce the existence of the precious metal in
Australia. A census was taken this year, showing the
population of the colony, exclusive of Port Phillip, to be
187,243, of whom 108,691 were males, and 78,552 females ;
184,550 free, and 2,693 bond.
In the month of January, 1852, an expedition, under
Mr. Hovenden Hely, set out in search of the missing
explorer, Leichhardt, but returned after an unsuccessful
search of some six months. In June, the village of
Gundagai was almost totally destroyed by a flood, in
which seventy-seven of the inhabitants lost their lives ;
and in October the Sydney University was inaugurated,
the Rev. B. T. Hamilton, M.A., being elected Provost.
The first mail steamer, the “Chusan,” arrived in the
colony, t id the Cape of Good Hope, in August, having
made the passage in 79 days. This was the first result of
an engagement between the Home Government and the
P. and O. Company for a bi-monthly communication.
Port Jackson was now made a free port, an act for
abolishing harbor dues, entry and clearance fees, light-
house and water-police dues having become law. The
gross revenue this year was upwards of half a million.
In 1853 the new goldfields regulations came into
operation, and caused very great dissatisfaction. On
the 21st December, 1853, the new Constitution Bill passed
the Council. This measure established two deliberative
chambers, a Legislative Council of not less than 21
naturalized or natural-born English subjects, and a
Legislative Assembly to consist of 54 members. During
this session, the Council voted Hargraves £lO,OOO, as a
reward for the discovery of gold, and £l.OOO to the Kev.
W. B. Clarke, as a mark of the appreciation in which the
country held the geological reports addressed by him at
various times to the Government. A pension of £lOO a
year was also voted to the mother of the explorer Leich-
hardt. In the course of this year, Her Majesty’s Govern-
ment sanctioned the establishment of a branch of the
Royal Mint at Sydney, and the new works for the
defence of the harbor at Pinchgut Island, Lady Mac-
quarie’s Point, and elsewhere, were commaiced. The
sum of £2oo,ooowas also appropriated this year for the.
purposes of immigration.
In the early part of 1854, the new Constitution Bill
was sent home in charge of Wentworth, the author of it,
and Thomson, the Colonial Secretary, one of its warmest
supporters, who were charged with the duty of concili-
ating for the Bill the favour of Parliament and the
Government. At the meeting of the Council in .Time,
the Governor announced that Her Majesty had been
pleased to sanction the establishment of a branch of the
Royal Mint in Sydney, as prayed for in the address of
the House of the 19th December, 1851, and in the course
of the session the endowment was provided for any
affiliated colleges that might be established in connection
with the Sydney University. The question of immigra-
tion was also dealt with, and further sums remitted for
that important object, while a sum of £6,000 was voted
the Governor in augmentation of his salary, to defray
the increased expenses of his office from the Ist June,
1851, to Ist June, 1854 ; and a series of resolutions were
carried laudatory of the Governor’s success in his ad-
ministration, extending over a period of more than eight
years, and which was now fast drawing to a close.
Among the Acts passed during this session was one em-
powering the Government to treat with the several
railway companies for the purchase of their works.
During this year the Sydney Grammar School was
founded and endowed, the Governor-General made a
voyage to Port Curtis, and Alexander Cuthill, an old-
established and much respected medical practitioner of
Sydney, who was shot by an insane person, left a legacy
of £lO,OOO to the Asylum'for Destitute Children.
The year 1855 opened with the departure of Fitzroy
and the installation of his successor, Sir William Denison.
Before embarking on the 28th January, Fitzroy was
presented with an address from the inhabitants of the
colony at large, accompanied by a munificent testimonial
of £2.000 in money. As a consequence of the Russian
war, then raging, steam communication with the colony
ceased, the company which had the contract for carrying
the mails alleging that, after the commencement of
hostilities, they lost by their contract at the rate of
£40,000 a year; while, at the same time, the House voted
£50,000 for the new defence works, projected by the Gover-
nor. at Kissing Point and elsewhere. In October, the
new Constitution, which returned with the confirmation
of the Imperial Parliament, was received in the colony.
The mode in which the contract for the performance of
the sewerage works of the City of Sydney was carried out
occupied a good deal of the attention of the Council and
the public during this year, and the report of a select
committee proved beyond question a large amount of
fraud and corruption in the affair. In the course of the
session of the House, a resolution was passed increasing
the Governor-General’s salary from £5.000 to £7,000, and
on the 19th December the Council was prorogued, and
the new Constitution formally inaugurated by the Gov-
ernor-General being newly sworn in under a commission
from Her Majesty, revoking that under which he had
held his authority, and re-appointing him Govemor-m-
Chief of New South Wales.


In July of this year a new exploring expedition set out
under the leadership of Mr. Gregory, the expense of
which was borne by the Imperial Government. His
instructions were to sail for the Victoria River, and
ascend as far as navigable, after which they were to land
and proceed as far as practicable towards the head of the
river, when further movements were left to the discre-
tion of the leader. In September the railway to Parra-
matta was formally opened, the Sydney Mint having been
started in the previous May, in which month, also. Dr.
Barker arrived as second Bishop of Sydney and Metro-
politan of the Protestant Episcopal Church, in succession
to Dr. Broughton, who had died in England in the
beginning of 1853. Sir Thomas Mitchell, the indefati-
gable and successful explorer, the historian, the poet, and
the man of science, died in October from bronchitis,
produced by exposure during a recent surveying expedi-
tion. The total revenue of the colony was £1,643,403,
and the gross expenditure £1,660,688.
The year 1856 opened with the establishment of respon-
sible government, and Stuart Alexander Donaldson
became Chief Secretary and Premier; Manning, Attor-
ney-General ; Darvall, Solicitor - General; Nichols,
Auditor-General; and Thomas Holt, Treasurer. Sir
Alfred Stephen assumed the position of President of the
Council, and Mr. (now Sir) Daniel Cooper was elected
Speaker of the Assembly. The Ministry', however, was
very short-lived; for, owing to what they considered a
want of support, they tendered their resignations on the
21st August, and Cowper was entrusted with the task of
forming a new r administration, which he speedily did by
taking the position of Chief Secretary himself, and asso-
ciating with himself Robert Campbell as Treasurer,
Murray as Minister of Lands and Works, Martin (now
Sir James) as Attorney-General, and Lutwyche as
Solicitor-General. The new Ministry was even more un-
fortunate than its predecessor, as a vote of want of con-
fidence was carried against it in September, and it there-
upon resigned, when Parker essayed his hand, his col-
leagues being Donaldson, Treasurer; Hay, Minister of
Lands and Works; Darvall, Attorney-General. Deas
Thomson was appointed Vice-President of the Executive
Council. A census taken in the course of the year
showed the population of Sydney proper to be 53,118 ;
that of the suburbs, 28,209.
In September. 1857, the Parker Ministry resigned,
having been defeated on their Electoral Bill, and made
way for Cowper as Premier; Jones as Treasurer;
Murray', Secretary for Lands and Works; and Martin,
Attorney-General. This was the first strong ministry
which had taken office, but owing to their defeat on a
bill to increase the assessment on stock and the
rent of the Crown Lands, the House was dissolved by
proclamation in the following December. During this
year the Pitcairn islanders, the descendants of the muti-
neers of the “ Bounty,” were finally established at Nor-
folk Island, their late island abode being no longer
adequate to the maintenance of the increased numbers
of the community. Extensive floods took place about
the middle of the year at the Hunter, the Hawkesbury,
and other parts of the colony; and two dreadful ship-
wrecks occurred in the immediate neighborhood of Port
Jackson Heads. The first, on the 21st August, was that
of the “Dunbar,” from London, when out of a total
number of 120 souls, only one man came ashore alive.
Many of the passengers belonged to the most respectable
class in the colony, and the obsequies of all those whose
bodies were recovered at once took the form of a public
funeral, when business was suspended throughout the city.
The second wreck was that of the “ Catherine Adamson.”
also from England, when twenty-one lives were lost, in-
cluding several persons well known and much respected
in the colony. The live stock this year amounted to
180.000 horses ; 2,148,700 cattle; fi,139,000 sheep; and
109.000 swine.
The new parliament assembled in March, 1858, and the
session was soon after marked by a collision between the
Legislature and the head of the Executive, the opening
speech of the latter mentioning his intention of sending
some of the troops away from the colony, in order to be
of service in assisting to quell the Indian Mutiny', and
the House adopting a reply deprecating the removal of
this force as inexpedient and injudicious. At the end of
the year the new Electoral Bill became law. wherein vote
by ballot was instituted, the number of members of the
Assembly was increased to eighty, and the franchise ex-
tended to every adult male of six months’ residence in
any electorate. In October, telegraphic communication
was established between Sydney, Melbourne, and Ade-
laide, rid Albury; and, in November, a mixed flock of 280
llamas, alpacas, and vicunas was landed in Sydney from
South America, the importer of this new stock being Mr.
Charles Ledger, an Englishman established in Peru. The
Murrumbidgee was for the first time traversed by a
steamer as far as Gundagai, an important step towards
opening up the interior of Australia. In April, 1859,
Parliament was dissolved preparatory to the elections
under the new Electoral Act, and shortly after the open-
ing of the subsequent session the Ministry resigned, a
resolution of Parkes declaring that the duties on tea and
sugar ought to be forthwith repealed, having been carried
against them. No one else being able to form a Ministry,
the former Government kept their seats on the ministerial
benches, and succeeded in carrying a motion rescinding
the resolution relative to the tea and sugar duties.
This year saw the separation of Moreton Bay from the
colony of New South Wales. The Cowper Ministry,
being defeated on their Education Bill, resigned, and
Forster formed a weak government, which went out of
office in February, 1860, giving way to Robertson as
Secretary for Lauds, with Cowper as Chief Secretary,
with a seat in the Upper House. In 1859, Captain Cadell
ascended the Darling in a steamer for a distance of 500
miles, and telegraphic communication with Van Diemen’s
Land was effected. The early part of 1860 was marked
by most disastrous floods in all parts of the colony,
causing immense losses in stock and crops ; but the dis-
covery of a rich goldfield at the Snowy River tended
somewhat to lighten the gloomy prospect.
On the 22nd January, 1861, Sir William Denison relin-
quished the reins of government and left the colony,
leaving Colonel J. F. Kempt as locum tenens until the
arrival of Sir John Young on the 22nd March following,
when the latter was sworn in as Governor-General. In
January of this year, a great rusli took place to Lambing
Flat, which was discovered to be a gold-field ; and the
Volunteer movement was first initiated. Shortly after
the occupation of Lambing Flat by the miners, the white
diggers and the Chinese came into violent collision, the
former being desirous of driving the latter from the
ground, and matters became so grave that a force of
military and police was despatched to the spot, when a
series of encounters took place between the representa-
tives of law and order and the rioters, in which serious
loss of life and injury to the person ensued before any
kind of tranquillity was restored to the locality. During
this year the Land*Bill of Mr. (now Sir John) Robert-on,
popularly known as Robertson’s Land Bill, passed the
Legislature and became law. A despatch was also received
from the Imperial Government in October, declining to
confer the title of Governor-General upon any future
Governor of New South Wales.
TheyearlB62 opened with considerable excitement in the
colony, caused by the arrival of the first English cricket-
ing team, which culminated on the last days of January,
when the visitors played against twenty-two of the
colonials in the Domain in Sydney, and came off vic-
torious by forty-eight runs. In January, the new Publi-
cans Act also came into operation, and the Chinese
Immigration Restriction Act in the following February.
In July, a movement was instituted in Sydney for raising
subscriptions for the relief of the distressed operatives in
the manufacturing districts in England, and by the
following September £17,100 had been remitted home,
whilst at the final meeting of the committee of this
Lancashire Relief Fund, held in January, 1864, it was
stated that the contributions sent from the colony for the
relief of the sufferers amounted to the handsome total of
£22.288. In October, 1862, the lessee of the Pitt-street
Tramway commenced running passenger cars and goods
trucks, and in the following January, the Sydney Money
Order Office was established. The first colonial-built
screw steamer was launched in Sydney in February, 1863.
and named the “ Commodore Burnett;” and in May the
Volunteer Naval Brigade was organized. On the Bth
October the Cowper Ministry tendered their resigna-
tions, having been defeated on a vote in Committee of
Ways and Means, and Mr. (the late Sir James) Martin
formed a new G overnment on the 20th following, his col-
leagues being Messrs. W. Forster, Eager, Wilson, Holroyd,
and Faucett. Numerous bands of bushrangers had long
harassed the country districts, especially in the west, with
their depredations, often accompanied by murder; and
strenuous efforts were made by the authorities to cope


with the desperadoes, a number of whom were shot at
different times by those they attacked, while others were
captured and brought to the scaffold. The value of total
imports this year was £8,319,576 ; exports, £6,936,839 ;
revenue, £1,550,047; expenditure, £2,064,299.
In January, 1864, the Free Trade Association of New
South Wales was formed, and in the next month the
northern districts were visited by disastrous floods, fol-
lowed by others later on in the year, which ruined the
crops and caused the loss of several lives. In November,
the Martin Ministry was defeated on a motion of want of
confidence moved by the Hon. Charles Cowper, where-
upon the House was dissolved on the recommendation of
the Premier (Mr. Martin), who was subsequently rejected
by the electors of East Sydney, together with his col-
league, Mr. W. Forster.
In January of 1866, the Fifth Parliament of New South
Wales was opened by the Governor, when Mr. Cowper
moved an amendment to the address in reply to His
Excellency’s speech, expressing a want of confidence in
the Martin Ministry, which was carried ; whereupon the
Ministry resigned, and Mr. Cowper undertook the task of
forming a new one, with himself as Colonial Secretary ;
Mr. Robertson, Secretary for Lands ; Mr. Arnold, Secre-
tary for Public Works ; Mr. Smart, Colonial Treasurer;
Mr. Darvall, Attorney-General; and Mr. Hargrave,
Solicitor-General. In July the Stamp Duties Act came
into operation, and in December the Premier proposed an
ad valorem duty of 5 per cent., which was accepted by the
Assembly. St. Mary’s Roman Catholic Cathedral was burnt
down in Juno of this year, and in the following October
there died at Bathurst the gifted Daniel H. Deniehy,
orator and critic. During the year bushranging was
carried on with as much audacity as ever, in spite of the
violent deaths of such prominent desperadoes as Ben
Hall, Gilbert, Morgan, and others, who were shot by the
police at various times when resisting capture. The
Mayor of Sydney was allowed £l,OOO towards the ex-
penses of his office for the first time this year.
A few days after the opening of 1866, the Cowper
Government resigned, having been defeated on a motion
for declaring the seat of Mr. Burdekin (who had accepted
office as Treasurer) vacant; whereupon Mr. Martin once
more formed a Cabinet, having for his associates Messrs.
Parkes, Byrnes, Wilson, Eager, Isaacs, and Docker. The
principal legislative measure of the year was the Public
Schools Bill of Mr. (now Sir Henry) Parkes, which
passed botli Houses in December. In the previous month,
a bill to authorize the Government to take up the Pitt-
street Tramway had passed the Assembly, and still
earlier (in April), a despatch was received from tlie
Imperial Government making the Sydney sovereigns a
legal tender. Terrific gales of wind visited the coast
during July, causing many shipwrecks and distressing
loss of life.
The year 1867 commenced with the appointment of the
Council of Education under the Public Schools Act, con-
sisting of the Honorables George Allen, W. M. Arnold,
James Martin, Henry Parkes, and Professor Smitli; and
the removal of the Pitt-strcet Tramway rails. A few
days later, news arrived in Sydney that the bodies of four
police constables had been found in the bush at Jindera,
who, it was subsequently ascertained, had been mur-
dered by two bushrangers named Clarke. These latter
were captured in April, and suffered the extreme penalty
in the June following, rewards amounting in the aggre-
gate to £5,000 having been offered for their apprehension.
In May, the ship “Vernon” was declared by proclama-
tion to be an Industrial School, and on the 24th Decem-
ber His Excellency Sir John Young, who had governed
the colony for six years and nine months with great ac-
ceptance to all classes of the community, left Sydney
for Europe, General Sir Trevor Chute taking the oath of
Administrator of the Government until the arrival of
his successor, Earl Belmore. This year was marked by
the occurrence of most disastrous floods in many parts of
the colony, entailing immense losses and widespread
distress. The Revenue was now £2,034,490; Expendi-
ture, £2,249,621 ; value of total Imports, £6,699,804;
Exports. £6,880,715.
On the 7th January, 1868, Earl Belmore arrived in
Sydney, and on the 21st of the same month H.R.H.
Prince Alfred entered Port Jackson, in command of the
“ Galatea,” and was the subject of numerous entertain-
ments of welcome, until he finally left for England on the
6th April. Unfortunately, the round of festivities was
sadly marred by the dastardly attempt at his assassina-
tion by a man named O’Farrell, who shot the Prince in
tlie back on the 12th March, whilst he was attending the
Sailors’ Home picnic at Clontarf. The ball was success-
fully extracted two days later, and the Prince was
happily able to re-appear in public on the 27th of the
same month, whilst his would-be murderer was executed,
after trial and condemnation, in the following April.
On the 13th October, Parliament re-assembled, and the
Martin Ministry tendered their resignations a week later,
Mr. Robertson having moved an amendment to the
Address in reply to the Governor’s speech, which, on
division, was only lost by the casting vote of the Speaker
in favor of the Government. The Governor having
sent for Mr. Robertson, that gentleman accepted office
as Premier, his colleagues being Messrs. Samuel, W.
Forster, Sutherland, Josephson, Eager and Sir W. Manning,
Shortly after the opening of 1869, St. Mary’s tempo-
rary R.C. Cathedral, in Sydney, was totally destroyed by
fire; and on the 11th March following, the Duke of
Edinburgh paid his second visit to the city in H.M.S.
“ Galatea.” His stay, however, was only a short one, as
he took his departure on the 3rd of the succeeding month
for New Zealand and other ports, but returned seventeen
months later, and finally left on the 16th November,
1870. On the 30th September, the Free Public Library
was opened as a Government Institution, the books of
the Australian Library having been purchased for the
purpose from the proprietors and shareholders of the
latter, which now ceased to exist. Parliament was dis-
solved on the 16th November of the same year, and the
first session of the new Legislature opened on the 27th
January, 1870, Mr. Robertson having meanwhile retired
from the Government, and Mr. Cowper having accepted
the position of Colonial Secretary and Premier. On the
7th December, this Ministry resigned, and Sir James
Martin succeeded in forming an Administration, which
was sworn in nine days later, and comprised Sir James
Martin, John Robertson, G. W. Lord, W. C. Windeyer,
J. B. Wilson, J. Byrnes, and J. Docker. August of this
year saw the withdrawal of the Imperial troops from
doing duty in Sydney, and on the 23rd of that month
they left the colony, two days before which event the
Intercolonial Exhibition at Prince Alfred Park was
opened by the Governor. Floods of a very disastrous
character again devastated large portions of New South
Wales, causing immense loss of property and widespread
distress in the country districts. One of the most noted
bushrangers of the colony, Thunderbolt, was shot dead
by a constable in May.
On the 2nd April, 1871, a census of the colony was
taken, which gave the population at 503,981 souls; on the
13th of the same month a meeting of citizens was held,
and a petition drawn up for presentation to the Governor
and both Houses of Parliament, praying for the annexa-
tion of the Fiji Islands ; and two days later the Governor
opened the Great Northern Railway to Scone. In May,
tlie Military and Naval Forces Regulation Bill and the
Stamp Duties Amendment Bill were passed, and the next
mouth saw the passage of a vote of £30,000 for works of
fortification and defence. The returns were now ;
Revenue, £2,908,183 ; expenditure, £3.006,576; value of
imports, £9,609,508 ; exports, £11,245,032.
The commencement of 1872 was signalled by the
destruction of the Prince of Wales Opera House by fire,
and on the 21st February the governorship of Earl Bel-
more came to an end, and he embarked for England, Sir
Alfred Stephen being sworn in as Administrator, which
office he held until the arrival of the incoming Governor,
Sir Hercules Robinson, on the 3rd June. On the 29th
April, the Martin Ministry handed in their resignations,
and on the failure of Mr. W. Forster to form a new one,
Mr. Parkes was entrusted with His Excellency’s commis-
sion, and successfully performed the task by the 14th
May, his colleagues being Messrs. Samuel, Piddington,
Farnell, Sutherland, Lloyd, Butler, and Innes.
Towards Uie end of June, the first telegrams were sent
from Sydney for direct transmission to England across
the continent of Australia; and on the Ist July, the
Governor opened the Great Western Railway to Mac-
quarie Plains, making a tour of the northern districts a
little later on. Two men. named Nichols and Lester,
were executed in June of this year for the perpetration
of several cold-blooded murders, their victims having
been enticed by them on board a small boat by promises
of employment at places up the Parramatta River, and
then deliberately put to death for the sake of their per-
sonal property.


At the close of February, 1873, Sydney and its suburbs
were visited by unprecedentedly heavy rains, flooding
the lower portions of the city. The remains of Mr. W.
C. Wentworth, which had been brought from England,
were accorded a public funeral on the 6th May, in pur-
suance of a resolution of the Assembly, when all the
principal houses of business were closed. In June, the
President of the Legislative Council, Sir Terence A.
Murray, died; and in the following October, the News-
paper Postage Abolition Bill was passed, and the House
approved of the course the Government had taken in
entering into an agreement by whi«h a mail service to
England rid San Francisco was arranged. Sir Alfred
Stephen having retired this year from the Chief Justice-
ship, Sir James Martin was appointed his successor, and
took his seat in the Supreme Court for the first time on
the 19th November. On the 27th of the same month, a
series of resolutions, submitted by Mr. Parkes, passed the
House, providing for a Department of Justice and Public
Instruction, with a responsible Minister at its head, and
for the abolition of the office of Solicitor-General.
On the 28th November, 1874, Parliament was dissolved,
the Government having been defeated three days earlier
on the Governor's minute respecting the release of the
bushranger Gardiner; and on the 27th January, 1875,
the first session of the eighth Parliament was opened, the
Government being defeated on the following day oil the
address, whereupon Mr. Parkes tendered the resigna-
tions of himself and colleagues. After Sir William Man-
ning had failed to form an Administration, Mr. Robertson
was sent for, and succeeded in his endeavours, his
associates in the Ministry being Messrs. W. Forster,
Docker, Dailey, Lackey, Garrett, Burns, and J. Lucas.
During this session the principal measures passed were
the Marriage with a Deceased Wife’s Sister Bill, and the
Lands Act Amendment Bill. The Speaker of the Legis-
lative Assembly, Hon. W. M. Arnold, was accidentally
drowned in the Paterson River in the beginning of
March, and Mr. G. W. Allen was chosen to fill the
vacancy. On the 20th August, Captain Goodenough,
R.N., Commodore on the Australian Station, died from
the effects of a poisoned arrow wound received from a
native while on a visit to Santa Cruz Island, on ttie
12th of the same month, and was buried at the St.
Leonards Cemetery, in the presence of about ten thousand
people; and on the 20th October, Sir Charles Cowper,
Agent-General of the colony, died at his post in
England. The following month saw the arrival in Syd-
ney of the “ Vasco da Gamma,” the first temporary vessel
of the new Pacific Mail Service. On the 20th February,
1876, the English mails were conveyed for the first time
overland from Melbourne to Sydney, the time occupied in
transit being 42 hours ; and in the following April a ten
months’ drought broke up with rainfall.
The Robertson Government came to an end on the
16th March, 1877, having been defeated on two or three
motions, and Mr. Parkes formed a new Ministry, com-
prising himself, Messrs. Piddington, Driver, Hoskins,
Samuel, F. B. Suttor, Lloyd, and Windeyer. This did
not, however, last five months, but gave way in August
to a return of another Robertson Administration, the
members of which, besides the Premier, were Messrs.
Docker, Long, Combes, Baker, Garrett, Lackey, Davies,
and Dailey. On account of the Assembly refusing to
suspend the Standing Orders to grant Supplies, this last
Ministry resigned on the 20th of the following mouth,
when Mr. Stuart was sent for by the Governor to under-
take the formation of a cabinet. Being unsuccessful in
Ills endeavors, recourse was had to Mr. S. C. Brown,
who also failed, so Parliament was dissolved on the 12th
October, with the view of obtaining the verdict of the
country. The result of the elections was that the
Robertson Ministry retained office, being in a measure
reorganized by Air. Baker’s acceptance of the Lands
Department in place of Mr. Garrett, resigned, Mr. Jacob
becoming Minister for Mines. The dead-lock, however,
continued, and after Sir Henry Parkes had resigned his
commission to form a Government on the 13th December,
Mr. Parnell successfully accomplished the task, his col-
leagues being Messrs. Fitzpatrick, Sutherland, W. H.
Suttor, Leary, J. F. Bums, and W. J. Foster. In June of
this year, Messrs. Parkes and Robertson received the
Order of K.O.M.G. from Her Majesty.
The year 1878 was notable for the decision of the
Assembly to open the Museum and Free Public Library
on Sundays ; the death of the Rev. W. B. Clarke, M.A.,
one of the first geologists of the day, on the 16th June,
and that of Ur. Lang, a man identified with the fortunes
of the colony for forty years, on the Bth August, a public
funeral being accorded his remains two days later; and,
finally, the agitation against the employment of the Chi-
nese. The Government Land Bill having been negatived
on the second reading on the 6th December, the Darnell
Administration resigned the next day, the result being
the formation of a coalition Ministry by Sir Henry Parkes,
with Sir John Itobertson in the Upper House, with them
being Messrs. Watson, Hoskins, Baker, Samuel, F. Suttor,
Lackey, and Windeyer, after Sir John Robertson had
failed in his endeavors to form a Government himself.
On the 19th March, 1879, Sir Hercules Robinson, the
most popular Governor the colony had ever had, left
Sydney on the termination of his Administration, to the
great regret of all classes of the community, and Sir
Alfred Stephen was sworn in the next day as Lieut.-
Governor, which position he held until the arrival of
Lord Augustus Loftus on the 3rd August following. The
present tramway system was inaugurated on the 16th
September, steam instead of horse traction being substi-
tuted about a week later, and on the next day the Sydney
International Exhibition was opened in the Garden
Palace, and had a most successful run until the 20th
April, 1880, when it was finally closed. On the Ist Sep-
tember, the Great Southern line was opened to Gerogery.
The Legislative Assembly was dissolved on the 9th
November, and the new Parliament opened on the 16th
of the ensuing month.
A census was taken throughout the colony on the 3rd
April, 1881, but owing to the untoward destruction of the
Garden Palace by fire, with all its contents, on the 22nd
September, 1882, and the fact that the compilation of the
census was being undertaken in that building, the
detailed records in connection with the same were un-
fortunately destroyed in the conflagration. This census
gave the population of the colony at 751,468, of which
number 411,149 were males, and 340,319 females. Small-
pox made its appearance in 1881 in Sydney, spreading
with alarming rapidity, so much so that most stringent
rules of isolation were carried out, with the view of
stamping out the fell disease. It was not, however, until
the following year that the city could be declared free
from the scourge, whilst for some considerably further
length of time it was introduced into the port by shipping
from Hongkong, although, happily, it has been confined
to the quarantine grounds. The Chinese Restriction Bill
and the Licensing Bill were passed in the last month of
1881, which also saw the departure of the Premier, Sir
Henry Parkes, on a visit to England. The detached
squadron arrived in Port Jackson on the 14th of the
previous July, with the two eldest sons of the Prince of
Wales, who were serving as midshipmen on board the
“ Bacchante,” and left again on the 10th of the next
month for Brisbane and other ports of call.
In 1882, New South Wales commenced to have a navy
of her own, H.M.S. “Wolverene” being presented to the
colony by Her Maiesty the Queen on the 16th January.
On the Ist August, Henry Kendall, facile princeps the
bard of Australia, died in Sydney. The Garden Palace
was destroyed by fire, as before mentioned, on the 22nd
September, the estimated loss being about £260,000; but
as many of the most valuable public records and the
magnificent collection of minerals belonging to the
Department of Mines were sacrificed in the conflagration,
no money value can properly assess a loss which is in
some respects irreparable. On the 26th of the same
month, Mr. Copeland's motion for throwing open the Art
Gallery on Sundays was carried in the Legislative As-
sembly, and on the 11th November following the magnifi-
cent steamer “Austral,” belonging to the Orient
Company, sank whilst at her moorings in Sydney
Harbour, five lives being lost on the occasion. She was
raised again, however, in March, 1883. and shortly after left
for England, practically nothing the worse for her sub-
mergence. At the latter end of November, 1882, Parlia-
ment was dissolved, the Government having been
defeated on their Land Bill; and the result of the
subsequent appeal to the country showing that the
Ministry was not in accord with public opinion, the
members thereof tendered their resignations after the
assembling of Parliament on the 3rd January following,
when Mr. Alexander Stuart formed an Administration,
with Sir Patrick Jennings and Messrs. G. H. Reid, Dailey,
Cohen, Dibbs, Copeland and J. P. Abbott as colleagues.


The commencement of 1883 was marked by continued
controversy in Parliamentary circles —the laud question
proving itself to be one of paramount importance. Among
the more decisive actions which preceded subsequent
amendments in the law was a sudden withdrawal from
auction of about a million acres which had been adver-
tised for sale. Agitations of various kinds ensued, and
it became apparent that the country was dissatisfied
with the Land Law of 1861, and with its amendments.
The question of extending education to all classes
also found force during the early months, and initiative
steps were made with respect to the establishment of
a system of popular technical instruction, which was
finally established in July. On 27th April the Statute
Book of the Colony received the addition of the Crim-
inal Law Consolidation Act, which repealed many
flagrant penal provisions, and, upon the whole,
effected a radical change in the New South Wales code.
The colony was connected by rail with Victoria on 14th
June; upon which'occasion it was shown that during the
ensuing few years direct railroad communication would
be established between Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney,
and Brisbane. In view of the increasing population and
of the demand for breadstufls, the Sydney Corn and Pro-
duce Exchange was shortly afterwards inaugurated.
During October the third session of the eleventh Par-
liament was opened, and one of its first acts was to
invite a supply of 150,000 tons of colonial-manufactured
steel rails, with a view of opening up the local indus-
tries of the colony. The latter months of the year are
chiefly memorable on account of unprecedented heat,
continued drought, and for numerous discoveries of
minerals and precious stones in parts of the territory
which had been hitherto looked upon as comparatively
barren.
Sir John Robertson was elected leader of the Opposi-
tion during February, 1884, and acrimonious debates
succeeded for a considerable time, although but little
Parliamentary progress was made. The opening of this
year was chiefly remarkable for a continuance of the
great mineral and precious metal discoveries of 1883 —
particularly at Silverton and Broken Hill. The yields
proved to be of fabulous extent; assaying from 60,000 to
20,000 ounces of silver to the ton. A census was taken
showing that there were 214,016 names of adults on the
electoral rolls. A universal depression threw thousands
of persons out of employment, and the force of public
clamoring resulted in a reduction of the assisted immi-
gration vote from £75,000 to £50,000. On 24th Septem-
ber the Colonial Treasurer propounded the startling
proposal of loan estimates of no less than £14,688,808,
including £13,313,000 for railways, railway works, and
trial surveys. In keeping with views which had been
expressed some years previously by Governor Sir Her-
cules Robinson, schemes were laid down which would
open up a network of trunk and branch lines through-
out the colony. A temporary lull took place, however,
in Parliamentary matters owing to the forced retire-
ment for a time of the Premier, Mr. Stuart, from severe
illness. Attention was turned to British interests in
New Guinea, and Sir Peter Scratchley left Sydney as
High Commissioner in Papua on behalf of Great Britain.
The colony appeared, from statistics, to have steadily
developed, in spite of all depression and bad seasons,
and an improved state of affairs was confidently looked
for by reason of the drastic amendments which had been
effected in the Land Act.
The leading opening event of 1885 was the publication
of the new Crown Lands Regulations, from which so much
good was anticipated; but which, subsequent events
proved, were not equal to the country’s requirements.
The Government, under the Hon. G. R. Dibbs’ leader-
ship, followed with the memorable action of discon-
tinuing the Bank of New South Wales’ monopoly of the
public banking account, and in lieu of it they trans-
ferred the colony’s deposits to the Associated Banks; a
step, which though seemingly of but little significance,
has not been without a permanent effect. The 97th
anniversary of the colony’s foundation was celebrated
with much enthusiasm on 26th January ; and on 12th
February, the Hon. W. B. Dailey made the memorable
offer of a contingent of New South Wales armed and
mounted troops to aid the Imperial forces in the Soudan.
The offer was accepted by England, and the contingent
left Sydney on 3rd March on board of the troopships
“ Iberia ” and “ Australasian.” This event marked an era
in the colony's history, and from that period the spirit of
military ardor has been kept actively alive, and has
spread to the sister colonies. Attention from time to
time was, during the middle of the year, turned to the
future prospects of New Guinea, and several expedition-
ary forces were despatched to explore the country with
a view of opening it up for Australian enter-
prise. The number of colonists had increased in New
South Wales from January to March, nearly 23,000 over
those in Victoria, and the immigration question again
sorely taxed public consideration. In July, Archbishop
Moran, the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, was elevated
to the position of the first Australasian Cardinal.
Lord Augustus Loftus having completed his term at
Government House, his successor, Lord Carrington,
arrived in Sydney and was publicly welcomed on 12th
December, 1885, with much enthusiasm.
The year 1886 opened with evidences of increasing
activity in mining matters in several parts of the colony.
On the 25th of January the first Federal Council was
held at Hobart, in Tasmania, and, although New South
Wales declined to send a representative, some interest
was evinced in its proceedings.
Parliament met for the transaction of business on the
27th of the same month, and the new Government
formed by Sir John Robertson at the close of 1885 gave
a brief outline of its intended policy. Early in February
the Ministry was subjected to a motion expressing want
of confidence, and was defeated. An attempt to form a
coalition Government was unsuccessful. Sir Patrick
Jennings managed subsequently, however, to construct a
Cabinet from his own party.
On the 31st of May of this year a terrible shipping
disaster occurred on the coast near the southern ex-
tremity of the colony. The Ly-ee-moon, one of the
Australasian Steam Navigation Company’s fleet, while on
the voyage from Melbourne to Sydney with a full com-
plement of passengers, struck the rocks at Green Cape,
and almost immediately afterwards became a complete
wreck. A loss of over 70 lives resulted, which caused
considerable sensation throughout the colonies.
The announcement by the Treasurer in October that
the deficit in connection with the revenue had been
increased during the year to over two millions sterling,
created a large amount of uneasiness in the community,
and led to meetings inimical to the Government.
Early in January 1887 the Jennings Ministry resigned,
a result due ostensibly to a dispute between the Premier
and one of his Cabinet. Sir Henry Parkes was invited
by His Excellency to form a Ministry. This he carried
into effect, and finding the condition of the Assembly
such that the work of legislation would be unnecessarily
impeded advised a dissolution. The appeal to the
country which followed was decisive and unmistakeable.
The previous administration had favoured a protective
tariff, and had even carried a measure, the incidence of
which was entirely in this direction. The question,
therefore, to be decided by the electorates was whether
such was to continue or a return to be made to the
principles of freetrade. By an overwhelming majority
the electors asserted that freetrade represented the
voice of the people, and the newly formed Government
returned triumphant in all the important districts. On
the Bth March the first session of the thirteenth Parlia-
ment was opened, and towards the close of the month
the Treasurer submitted a statement of the public
accounts to the Assembly explaining the Government
proposals for getting rid of the large deficit.
On the 23rd of this month the most appalling accident
that has ever taken place in connection with mining in
Australia occurred at the Bulli Company’s colliery in
the Illawarra district, and resulted in the loss of over 80
lives. The catastrophe was subsequently found to have
been caused by an explosion of gas in one of the more
dangerous sections of the mine.
In May an address of congratulation to Her Gracious
Majesty the Queen on the attainment of the Jubilee
year of her reign was adopted in both Houses of Parlia-
ment, and on the 20th and 21st of June public rejoicings
were held throughout the colony. The metropolis and
the more important townships were brilliantly illumi-
nated, and on the second evening a display of fireworks
on a magnificent scale was given on the harbour in con-
nection with the shipping, men-of-war and batteries.
As the year drew to a close one of the principal sub-
jects of interest was the near approach of the Centenary
of Australian Colonisation, and the various preparations
for its due celebration.

New South Wales, the oldest of the Australian colo-
nies, and having a superficial area of 309,175 square
miles, is bounded on the south by Victoria, the west by
South Australia, the north by Queensland, and the east
by the South Pacific Ocean. With a coast line of about
800 miles, from Point Danger in the north in lat. 28° 7'S.,
extending southwards to Cape Howe in lat. 37° 28'S., and
long. 150° B'E., the colony is thence separated from Vic-
toria by an imaginary line and the River Murray as far
west as the 141st meridian, which latter then forms the
western division from South Australia until the 29th
parallel of latitude is reached. The northern frontier
consists of the 29th parallel to the Macintyre River —this
river, the River Dumaresq, and that spur of the Great
Dividing Range which meets the coast in lat. 28° 7'S.
The greatest length of the colony is 900 miles; the
greatest breadth about 850 miles ; the mean breadth
being 600 miles.
The principal Ports and Harbours, commencing at the
most northern, are the Tweed, Richmond, and Clarence
Rivers, Port Macquarie, the Manning River, Port
Stephens, Port Hunter, Broken Bay, Port Jackson, Port
Hacking, Wollongong, Kiama, Shoalhaven, Jervis Bay,
Bateman’s Bay, and Twofold Bay.
The more important Capes are Point Danger, Cape
Byron, Lennox Head, Smoky Cape, Cape Hawke, Sugarloaf
Point, Point Stephens, Crocodile Head, Cape St. George,
Green Cape, and Cape Howe.
The Great Dividing Range of Mountains runs parallel
to the coast at a varying distance of 30 to 100 miles,
and furnishes the sources of almost all the rivers water-
ing the colony, besides dividing it into three distinct
parts ; the coast districts, or all the country to the east-
ward of the Range, the Mountain District, consisting of
rich and fertile table-lands of red and chocolate coloured
loam, and the Great Western Districts, vast rolling plains
of saltbush—the soil of which is also of a loamy nature.
The loftiest elevation of this range is Mount Kosciusko,
7,176 feet. Besides this chain of mountains, there are the
coast ranges, of which Mount Coolungera, 3,712 feet, is the
highest point, the interior ranges (highest elevation,
Mount Arrowsmith, 2,000 feet), and solitary mountains,
the loftiest of which rears its head 2,900 feet.
All the Rivers of any importance flow from the Western
Watershed, trending southward and westward in their
course. The Murray River rises in the south-eastern
corner of the colony, and has a length of 1,120 miles
in New South Wales, finally emptying itself into the
Ocean on the South Australian coast. The Murrum-
bidgee River, rising some little distance north of the
source of the Murray, is about 1,350 miles in length,
and flows into the latter near Balranald, after union
with the Lachlan River, which rises in the Dividing
Range between lat. 34° and 35° S., and is 700 miles long.
The Darling River, springing from the northern ex-
tremity of the Great Range, joins the Murray at Went-
worth, after a south-westerly course of 1,160 miles. The
principal affluents of the Darling are the Macintyre, the
Gwydir, the Namoi, the Castlereagh, the Macquarie, and
the Bogan. The coast districts are watered by fourteen
rivers from the Main Range, the principal of which are
the Clarence, 240 miles in length ; the Manning, 100
dFeatum.
miles; the Hunter, 300 miles ; the Hawkesbury or Ne-
pean, 330 miles, from which the water supply to Sydney
is in course of formation ; and the Shoalhaven, 260 miles.
Of Lakes, the largest in the colony is Lake George, 25
miles long by 8 miles in width, situate about 25 miles
S.W. of Goulburn, and the next in size, Lake Bathurst,
8 miles square in area, is about 10 miles distant from the
larger lake. The waters of both are saline.
Owing to the vast extent and diversity of elevation of
the colony, the Temperature varies from the coldest to be
met with in the British Isles, to the genial warmth of the
Mediterranean, and choice may be made of a climate—
either dry or moist, hot or cold, but everywhere coupled
with a marked salubrity. Sydney, the metropolis, has a
mean temperature of 62° 6' in the shade ; and, indeed,
these figures may also be fairly taken ns representing the
like temperature of the colony. Whilst the mountains dur-
ing the winter are clothed with snow, which occasionally
carpets the highlands of the middle districts also, Sydney
has not been visited with a fall since 1836, although
slight frosts are usual in the winter at nights ; and the
neighbourhood of the Clarence, again, enjoys a moist and
balmy atmosphere, suggestive of tropic lands.
Forests of mighty proportions, and offering many valu-
able descriptions of wood, add their quota to the natural
products of New South Wales, and, year by year, new
characteristics and properties of them become discovered
and developed, tending always to their increased com-
mercial advantage. Foremost amongst the indigenous
trees is the Eucalyptus, or Gum-tree, having about fifty
varieties in all. yielding a most valuable wood for various
purposes—not the least of which are its febrifuge proper-
ties. In the northern parts of the colony the Cedar tree
is to be found flourishing on the eastern side of the Great
Range, and is the most valuable timber as well as that in
greatest demand in the country. Sheltering Fig-trees of
different kinds are of abundant growth, the fruit being
poor and insipid, whilst an almost endless variety of
ferns of all sizes are to be met with in every gully and
sheltered nook at the mountain’s foot. The flowering
plants of New South Wales exceed those of the whole of
Europe, and number some 10,000. The Acacia, or Wattle,
with its fragrant yellow blossom, has about 300 different
varieties.
The kangaroo is found in most parts of the colony,
and in many places in such numbers as to cause
serious losses to squatters, by eating the herbage, to the
disadvantage of the grazing stock. Wallabies, paddy-
melons, and kangaroo rats are smaller members of the
family, and, with the bandicoot, native bear, native cat,
opossum, and wombat have their habitat in the country
districts. The Ornithorhynchus Paradoxus, or platypus,
is also to be met with by the banks of rivers and streams.
Parrots of various kinds and brilliant plumage people the
woods, whilst members of the eagle family are to be seen
in different parts of the interior. The emu, the largest
feathered biped in the colony, is now only to be found on
the western plains. The lyre and the bower birds, the
great kingfisher or laughing jackass, and many others,
are also natives of the colony. There are great quanti-
ties of snakes, the death-adder being the most dangerous
to human life ; and lizards—the iguana being the largest


of tlie species. The coast and mouths of the rivers
swarm with many varieties of edible Fish, the principal of
which are the bream, mullet, jewfish, kingfish, whiting,
schnapper, taragliu, flathead, mackerel, and garfish ;
whilst the oyster-beds of the Hunter, Clarence, Cook’s.
Clyde, and other rivers offer a plentiful supply of the
succulent bivalve.
As regards the agricultural consideration, the Soil of
the coast districts is of remarkable fertility, and suitable
for almost all farming purposes. From the southern
boundary to the Illawarra district, some 200 miles
in length, the laud is most highly adapted for dairy
farming. On the alluvial flats of the Hawkesbury and
Nepean rivers, hay and corn are principally grown. On
the land watered by the Hunter River, the vine and most
kind of cereals flourish. Northwards still, the rivers
Hastings, Bellinger, Macleay, and Manning water an
area of three millions of acres, on which sugar and maize
are found of profitable cultivation, and thence to the
Northern boundary of the colony there are some four
millions of acres of land fertilized by the Clarence, Rich-
mond, and Tweed Rivers, of a general capacity for grow-
ing semi-tropical produce of almost every description. On
the western watershed of the Great Dividing Range,
there are about fourteen millions of acres suitable to the
growth of English cereals on the table lands of New Eng-
land and Tenterfield, whilst the highlands and plains of
Braidwood, Goulburn, Yass, Bungendore, and Monaro
offer about fifteen millions of acres of land, on which all
English cereals, fruits, and vegetables flourish and fruc-
tify. Tobacco-growing as an industry is yearly increas-
ing, and the suitability of the country to the growth of
the mulberry tree, and the fact that the silkworm lives
healthily and particularly free from disease, point to an
almost certain and prosperous sericnltural industry in
the future of the colony.
The Great Western districts, stretching to the western
and north-western limit, are those in which the great
Pastoral Runs are for the most part found, those being
specially favored which are watered by the River Darling
and its tributaries. This saltbush country consists of
red, loamy plains, destitute of timber, except in those
parts which are liable to floods in winter. The soil of
the plains is loose, and in very dry weather the grass
nearly disappears ; but as the country becomes stocked
by the pioneer squatters, the tread of the animals binds
the surface, the grass acquires closeness and strength,
and the saltbush gives way to an abundant growth of
fattening herbage. As a consequence, when the rain falls
it begins to form watercourses, waterholes become creeks,
»nd the streams increase in volume.
The mountain ridges and table-lands of the colony con-
sist mainly of the older Palaeozoic formations, pierced and
rent by intrusive igneous rocks of various ages. The older
settled districts of the east coast lie mostly on rocks of the
carboniferous formations, or on newer deposits of the
Mesozoic age ; while the great western plains and valleys
are almost wholly of Tertiary sandstone or more recent
deposits, with intervening areas covered by overflows of
igneous trap rock. The oldest sedimentary rocks are
Silurian, consisting of crystalline sandstones and lime-
stones. Granitic rocks of various kinds are abundant;
while Syenite forms the summit of Kosciusko, the highest
mountain in Australia. Gold occurs in granite, and the
tin of New England is all derived from the same stone.
The carboniferous rocks cover an immense area, and are
largely coal-bearing, so that the coal-fields of the colony
are among the most extensive in the world. Cannel
coal and mineral oils are also produced by the carbonife-
rous rocks. The secondary formation is scantily repre-
sented by small patches of trias at the Clarence River,
and by some coal-bearing beds near Parramatta. Tertiary
deposits are almost unknown in the east; while, to the
west of the Dividing Range, they cover enormous areas.
There are also immense deposits of sands, gravels, marls,
and clays, of late Tertiary or Post-tertiary age ; whilst,
more recent still, are the deposits of drifts and boulders,
with the red earth deposited in caves. Igneous rocks
occur abundantly, and of all ages, from the basalt of the
Paheozoio formation to the product of volcanoes of Post-
tertiary age. In the southern part of the Dividing Range
columnar basalt is abundant, and is found as high as 600
feet above the sea. Greenstone dykes cut through granite
at Naas Valley, and alter sandstone to quartzite at Mount
Tennant. Trachyte crowns the summit of Mount Linde-
say. Igneous dykes at Illawarra, Mnrrurundi, and other
places, have changed coal into coke. Great outflows of
basalt occur at most of the gold-fields.
Almost every description of Mineral Wealth is to be
found in the colony, and, indeed, some kinds seem
to be practically inexhaustible. The auriferous area
is approximately put at 70,000 square miles; but new
fields are being continually opened, and such a vast
amount of gold still lies in its hidden depths that any
accurate computation is rendered impossible. Few coun-
tries offer coal under such favorable circumstances and in
such abundance as New South AVales —the seams to the
north, south, and west of Sydney being considerably
above sea level, whilst it is almost certain that the imme-
diate neighbourhood of the metropolis itself possesses a
vast coalfield at 1,500 to 2,000 feet below sea level. Exten-
sive tin discoveries have been made of late years, the
principal centres being Glen Inues, Tingha, Vegetable
Creek, and the northern border, the approximate ex-
tent of stanniferous area being 8,500 square miles.
Copper deposits are also very large, embracing an area of
6,713 square miles, but the mines have only been feebly
worked, owing to many deterring circumstances, of
which want of,capital and facilities of carriage are not
amongst the least. Silver mining has been neglected ;
but late discoveries at Boorook, in the Tenterfield dis-
trict, of rich lodes, will probably lead to more attention
being paid to the best methods of reducing and treating
the ore. The iron deposits are found to the west and
south of Sydney, Mittagong, and Lithgow Valley, supply-
ing what appears to be a practically unlimited quantity.
Lead ore, in the form of galena, is to bo met with in
different parts of the colony, and .with shale, antimony,
bismuth, asbestos, and other minerals, only requires
greater practical attention and scientific working in
order to develop into a valuable item of colonial wealth.
Precious stones of various kinds, including diamonds,
emeralds, sapphires, and rubies, also form a part of the
mineral wealth of this most favored colony ; and, as its
metropolis offers the most magnificent harbor in the
world for the accommodation of the trading vessels of all
nations, and its railway facilities are being rapidly ex-
tended, tapping its most remote corners, it is not too
much to say that, taken all in all. no fairer country can
be found.


The Beneficial Influence of a Free Trade Policy upon the Colony of New-
South Wales, having special regard to her Industries.
By Edward Puls ford, Secretary of the Free Trade Association of New South Wales,
of the Cobden Club.
and Honorary
Member
IT is one thing to see a great work ; it is another tiling
to explain the forces that created that work. We see
around us a flourishing and rapidly growing community,
but we must look below the surface with diligent care if
we would ascertain and understand the influences that
hare created a sight so gratifying to the eye. The
careful student knows well that it is easy to either
under-estimate or over-estimate the importance of the
various forces that have contributed to produce certain
results, more especially if there exists a latent desire to
show that one given force has had an influence of a very
marked character. Bearing these facts in mind it will
be our duty to exercise the greatest scrutiny over the
facts and opinions we put forward.
We will commence the consideration of our subject
with the year 1851. That year saw the southernmost
portion of New South Wales separated and formed into
another Colony, under the name of Victoria. That year
will ever be memorable in Australian history on account
of the discoveries of gold in the newly-created Colony in
quantities so large that for several years the attention
of the world was thereby drawn to Victoria. The effect of
the great addition made by Victoria to the world’s stock
of gold has been of a great and enduring character.
Wherever civilization existed the influence was felt.
May we not take this as prophetic of the yet greater
part a complete and united Australia will play in the
history of the future ?
The immediate effect of the discoveries was to cause
an extraordinary change in the relative positions of New
South Wales and Victoria ; the latter colony shot abreast
and then ahead of the former with astonishing rapidity.
The year 1886, however, once more finds the mother
colony assuming the premier position even as regards
population. The consideration of our subject will be
facilitated by an examination of the figures representing
the growth and changes in the relative proportions of the
populations of the two colonies :

These tables present many features of great interest.
The year 1857 saw the culminating point of the rush to
the goldfields of Victoria, the population of that Colony
had then increased no less than 373 per cent, since 1851,
against an increase of only 55 per cent, in that
of New South Wales. In 1857 Victoria had 6100 out
of every 10,000 of the united populations, a pro-
portion that gradually fell to 6000, 5600, and 6000
respectively in the years 1866, 1876, and 1886. Whilst,
on the other hand, New South Wales, which in
1857 possessed only 3900 out of every 10,000 of the
united populations, increased her proportion to 4000,
4400, and 5000 respectively in the years mentioned.
These changes are remarkable, but when it is remem-
bered that opposing fiscal systems have been followed in
the two colonies for the past twenty years, they gain
added significance. We are far from asserting that Free-
trade in New South Wales is entitled to all the credit for
the improvement in her relative position, or that Protec-
tion in Victoria is alone to blame for the falling off in
the relative position of that Colony, for it is obvious that
other causes must have their weight—good seasons, gold
discoveries, &c., are independent of fiscal policies, and
are bound to have their influence. Nor can we for
one moment assert that it is impossible for a country
to attain a certain amount of prosperity under a policy of
Protection. What we contend for is that whatever
prosperity may be attained under Protection, it must of
necessity be less than might have been attained under a
policy of Free Trade. We shall do our best to trace the
connection between the development of the industries of
New South Wales and the fiscal policy with which the
Colony has so long been identified.
By the term “ industries ” we do not propose to limit
ourselves to mere manufacturing enterprise. We shall
take the term in its full sense, and shall endeavour to
estimate the results of the entire labour of the Colony,
in whatever directions they may have been achieved.
A practically Free Trade tariff was adopted in 1852.
There have been certain departures, during the interval
since that date, from the simplicity of its provisions, and
it would be no difficult task to show that those departures
had unfavourable results; but we think it to be unwise
to occupy ourselves-with detailed examinations of tariff
changes; we prefer to state the broad fact, that since
1852 the fiscal policy of the Colony has been practically
one of Free Trade. It is evident that New South Wales
—like every other country in the world —has certain
natural advantages, and as a matter of course, wealth is
most easily obtained when it is followed in natural
channels, indeed the whole secret of Free Trade lies in
permitting this to be done. It is also obvious that men
will take up industries one after another in the order of
their value if they are left alone, and the fact that
valuable industries receive no attention, is generally a
proof that others still more valuable employ all the
available labour.

The first great industry of New South Wales is the
pastoral one. Who can, who dare, dispute the beneficial
influence of Free Trade on this great industry ? Nay,
we may even remark that it has been brought as a charge
against Free Trade, that it has been beneficial. Scattered
far and wide over avast extent of country, the pastoralist
has been permitted to obtain his supplies of manufac-
tured goods, and of food, without having to pay
blackmail to protected manufacturers and producers. It
has been said that one of the causes of the great Civil
War in the United States, was that the Southern States
were not allowed to freely exchange their cotton for
the manufactured goods of Europe, but were compelled
to pay large sums of money to the manufacturing
interests of the Northern States. New South Wales has
not perpetrated a like folly, the producers of her greatest
article —wool —have enjoyed the benefits of freedom,
what they wanted for the carrying on of their industry
they have been permitted to obtain as cheaply as the
world could produce it, and they have been permitted to
receive the full price their produce realized in outside mar-
kets. The intimate relation that exists between imports
and exports has been recognized, and natural laws have
been permitted to exert their full force without deflection
into side channels. There are people who think that a
manufacturing industry employing a few hundred people,
and adding but little to the sum total of the public
wealth and prosperity, is of great importance, and that
the pastoral industry of the Colony is a matter of no
concern ; but he who wishes to take stock of a country’s
growth and wealth will proceed on the simple rules that
govern a tradesman or a merchant in his annual stock-
taking—that of figures alone. We venture to say that
the growth of the pastoral industry of New South
Wales has been a splendid one.
The enormous increase in the number of sheep is
reduced in importance by the falling off in the number
of horned cattle, but after making every allowance for
that, the figures bear witness to an exceptional advance
in the position of the industry. To fully understand
these figures, it is worth while referring to the statistics
of other colonies for the years named. We take the
colonies of Victoria, New Zealand and South Australia
because their fiscal systems have been the most opposed
to that of New South Wales.
Victoria.
Here we find that the three important colonies of
Victoria, New Zealand, and South Australia practically
have remained at a standstill for a lengthened period so
far as this great industry is concerned. Dare any one
affirm that they have advanced in other directions at
anything like sufficient speed to compensate ?
It is interesting to note the declared value of the
exports of wool—the principal product of the pastoral
industry in New South Wales and in Victoria, excluding
of course the produce of other colonies :
Exports Wool.
The requisite statistics are lacking which could afford
material for a comparison of earlier years. The reduced
figures for 1885 in both cases represent the great fall in
value that took place.
The fact that the value of the exports of wool, the
produce of New South Wales, advanced in the way
indicated, whilst those of Victoria positively receded,
is a most important one, and shows what a mine
of wealth the pastoral industry has become to this
Colony, and shows also a great triumph for Free
Trade principles. It is within the limits of our
subject to point out, that had England “protected”
her farmers—in England the term “ farmers ” includes
pastoralists—New South Wales would have had no
such figures to show to-day. To produce what none
will buy, or to produce largely that which can be only
sold in limited quantities, would have been, of course,
absurd. Much has been said of the benefits of England’s
Free Trade policy, but the half has not yet been told.
Whilst England was enriching herself, she was enriching
others; nay, she was doing more—she was laying the
foundations of a new Empire. Victoria is herself an
example of the success of Free Trade, of the triumph of
a generous policy over one of selfishness. “The bene-
ficial influence ” of England’s Free Trade policy has
blessed and enriched Victoria, even while Victoria has
been fighting England with the destructive weapons of
Protection. The triumph, “ the beneficial influence,” of
Free Trade principles are written so plainly in the pro-
gress of all these colonies, that “he who runs may read.”
The fast-growing cities, the railways and telegraphs, the
noble buildings, the public parks, the numerous other
signs of prosperity and civilization now found through-
out Australasia are tributes to the far-reaching success
of England’s Free Trade policy. Naturally, where a
generous policy has been generously met, there we find
the greatest results, and the rapid growth of the Colony
of New South Wales must ever form one of the note-
worthy facts of the nineteenth century.
So long as wealth is the product of honourable
labour there is nought to consider but the amount,
and if the free energies of this Colony have singled
out the wool industry as worthy of special and
preponderating attention, it may be assumed that the
total of the Colony’s wealth is greater and not less than
it would have been had the Legislature pursued a policy
of forcing the labour of the Colony into directions it did
not take. The addition to the Colony’s wealth made by
the pastoral industry is difficult to exaggerate, and most
certainly is not generally known. It is often said that
the pastoral industry gives employment to very few
people—there never was a greater mistake. The men
who are to be found actually on the stations are only a
small portion of the total number who gain their liveli-
hood by the pastoral industry. It is this industry that
has been the main cause of the expansion of the railway
system, andHhe carrying out of numerous other public
works; that supports thousands of railway employees;
that causes the stores of country merchants to over-
spread the land, and brings into existence the minor
industries and employments, without which civilization
would be incomplete. The rising of the Nile is to
Egypt just what a favourable wool season is to New
South Wales —a stream whence wealth flows over all the
land. It is in Sydney that the benefits of the pastoral
industry culminate ; the professional, the mercantile,
the shipping, and the working classes find profitable
employment in many ways that could be easily traced
back to the one great industry, in addition to all that
which is directly and evidently due to it.
We will now leave the pastoral industry, the over-
whelming preponderance in the increase of which in
this Colony utterly outweighs the advances made in
other directions by the sister colonies. Yet it will be
our pleasing task to show that, even with this great and
overwhelming growth in one direction, New South Wales
has made rapid strides in many others; that the generous,
fearless spirit of Free Trade has been conducive to the
creation, the strengthening, and the expansion of new
and important industries. First, we will refer to agri-
culture, which naturally follows the pastoral industry.
New South Wales had under crop—


It will be here seen that the increase has been very
much the same as that in the population. It will be
well, however, to note the increase that has taken place
in certain other colonies.

1880 .. 1,688,275 . 2,574,489
1885 .. 2,405,157 .. 2,785,490
These two colonies show an enormous growth, one
entirely dwarfing that of New South Wales. But the
growth of New South Wales has been natural, that of
Victoria a forced one. Consequently, therefore, the gain
in New South Wales represents absolute gain, whilst the
gain in Victoria necessarily is accompanied by loss in
some more natural direction or directions. Apart from
this we have to bear in mind that the last four years
—those in which the production has been largest—
have been years of extraordinary and almost unprece-
dented depression in the value of agricultural products,
wheat more especially. There is, therefore, solid reason
for congratulation in the fact that New South Wales
has not forced agriculture. The distressing depression
that has overtaken the Colony of South Australia bears
strong testimony to the unprofitable nature of agri-
culture of late years. An adherence to Free Trade
principles has saved this Colony from very serious losses,
and virtue, in this case at least, has received its reward.
It is further a matter for sincere congratulation that of
the acreage devoted to agriculture in New South Wales
a large proportion has been planted with maize, in
which article the colony practically has no competition.
The following figures represent the production of this
branch of farming in New South Wales :
1870 .. 4,483,457 bushels produced.
1880 .. 4,761,856 „ „
1886 .. 4,235,163
These figures must be taken in conjunction with those
giving the export of maize.
1874 .. 1,025,182 bushels exported.
1880 .. 757,104 „ „
1885 .. 394,422 „ „
The home consumption has grown so rapidly that the
surplus for export has practically disappeared, and New
South Wales has had yearly to import immense quanti-
ties of other feeding stuff; though, it may be remarked,
the very heavy imports of the past three years are
largely due to the effects of the disastrous droughts
in the Colony. Although the production of wheat
is still a long way from being equal to the supply
of the Colony’s own wants, it is far from being
a despisable factor in the general welfare, for the
average production exceeds 4,000,000 bushels. Oats,
barley, &c., are produced, but only in rather limited
quantities. The production of potatoes is not neglected,
but it receives less attention now than it did some years
ago. The production grew to 62,228 tons in 1880, but
fell to 38,695 tons in 1885.
Hay is, naturally, produced in large quantities, the
figures being ;
1875 .. .. 93,440 tons.
1880 .. .. 162,763 „
1885 .. .. 191,378
Notwithstanding this large growth the Colony has been
a large customer to Victoria, the imports, principally
from there, having been—
3,668 tons in 1875
14,578 „ 1880
21,444 „ 1885.
The imports of hay and other feeding stuffs of course
fluctuates, being greatest in times of severe drought.
Can there be any doubt of the wisdom of admitting
duty free the articles of which wayward Nature often
stints the supply ?
The sugar industry has assumed considerable dimen-
sions in the north of the Colony, especially on the
Clarence and Richmond Rivers. It is in connection
With this industry that there is to be found a marked de-
parture from the general Free Trade policy of New South
Wales. Yet this departure has been an involuntary one—
a duty imposed on imported sugar having led certain
people to attempt the production of cane sugar in order
to divert this duty into their own pockets. Since the
commencement of this industry it is probable that about
£600,000 in all has been thus diverted from the public
treasury towards its support. It would be a pity indeed,
if after the collection of this vast sum from the tax-
payers of the whole Colony, there was nothing to show
for it. Certainly it has aided in the development of the
districts named, and in the creation of a certain amount
of wealth in the hands of private persons. On the other
hand it is absolutely clear that development would have
proceeded faster in other directions if energy and capital
had not been thus tempted to produce sugar. It is a
strange commentary on this matter, that to-day the
sugar industry, with 25 per cent, protection, is less
profitable than the maize industry which is chiefly
carried on in the same districts. There seems no reason
to think that the Colony would have been one whit less
developed, or its people' less prosperous, if the £600,000
had been saved. We have seen how largely the export
trade in maize has fallen off—it is probable that the
production and export of this article would have largely
increased but for the effect of the protection enjoyed by
sugar, which has lessened the attention given to maize.
Had the agriculturalists of the north been left free to
work as they found to be best, they would certainly have
grown very much larger quantities of this grain.
The fruit-producing industry of the Colony is an im-
portant one, and at the same time rather a marvellous
one. Fruit is produced so easily, and generally sells for
such good prices, that one can but be impressed with a
feeling that there exists great prosperity where so prolific
and pleasant a source of income receives attention in-
sufficient to provide for the requirements of the people.
It is only of oranges and grapes that we may be said to
fully supply ourselves. Of the former, indeed, we
produce very largely, and are able to send a fair quantity
away to other colonies. The following is said to he the
quantities produced in the respective years named: —
1880, 3,806,906 dozen; 1885, 8,749,256 dozen. Of green
fruit exported—largely oranges—we have the following
statisticslB7o, £51,562 ; 1880, £90,381 ; 1885, £114,501.
At the door of the prosperous man how frequently
the tradesman stops to leave luxuries? Who would
think that less frequent calls indicated growing pros-
perity ? Yet there are those who look aghast at the
large and frequent supplies of luxuries received by this
colony. Notice these imports of green fruit, all addi-
tions to our own home production : 1870, £17,612 ; 1880,
£65,461 ; 1885, £178,505. Besides, we receive large
imports of dried, bottled and preserved fruits. Is there
no tribute to the power of Free Trade in these figures ?
Do they not proclaim that New South Wales has the
wealth to buy ? That she has pursued a fiscal policy
that has indeed been beneficial to her industries and has
raised her emphatically to the position of premier Colony
of Australasia ?
There are two kinds of Protection : First, the one
given by Nature free of all cost; second, the one created
by law and sustained by taxation; and just as a country
is unburdened by the law-created, tax-sustained pro-
tection is Nature’s protection able to work her wonders
and the country’s trade truly free. Free Trade consists
in making the most of Nature’s protection, while the
policy known as Protection consists in more or less
ignoring Nature’s protection. Peculiarities of climate,
soil, and people, together with the distance between
countries, are the chief characteristics of the true pro-
tection enjoyed by every country. England and New
South Wales have both large coal supplies, that in
England being much cheaper than that in New South
Wales, yet the natural protection of distance keeps
English coal out of the Colony, and enables our coal
companies to pay—easily pay—much larger wages than
are paid in England. Both countries produce wool, but
Nature has given New South Wales the more favourable
climate, so that she can produce enormous quantities
cheap enough to enable her to send her wool to the other
side of the world and sell it there in ever growing quan-
tities. Among other characteristics of natural protection
may be mentioned abundant supplies of capital and
labour, skilled and unskilled. Free Trade is nothing but
the exchange of the products of these varied advantages;
and it is by exchanging what we do not want for what we
do want that our wealth grows. We shall now endeavour
to show how the various mechanical and other manufac-
turing industries of the colony have benefited by the
operation of the principles of Free Trade. Of course it
is in many of these industries that Protection —law-
created, tax-sustained Protection—when adopted exerts

its greatest power. That it has a power it would of
course be absurd to deny. If nine men out of ten are
taxed for the benefit of the tenth man, it would be
strange if that tenth man could show nothing for all the
plunder conferred on him. Considering the many years
Victoria has devoted to the furthering of prosperity by
Protection, and the large total of public wealth that has
been bestowed on the purely manufacturing industries,
it is simply marvellous to find that New South Wales is
so little behind her in the total of similar industries.
We will carefully compare the figures showing the hands
employed in those industries tabulated in our statistics
under the heading of “ Works, manufactories, &c.,” in
the two colonies for the year ending December 31st, 1884.
The Victorian statistics being made up to March 31st,
1885, in order to give the correct comparison we deduct
one-quarter of the total increase for the year. We also
separate the male and female hands, in order to get the
fairest comparison.
Males Females
The Statistical Register of New South Wales does not
include in the number of hands employed in “Works,
manufactories, &c.,” those in flour-mills, chaff-cutting,
corn-crushing works, goldsmiths’ establishments, the
Boyal mint, and cheese factories. We have, therefore,
deducted the number so employed in Victoria—total,
2,267 —from the full total for Victoria, which other-
wise would stand at 40,352. The correct method would
have been to allow the Victorian figures to stand
and to make the requisite addition to the New South
Wales figures; but, in the absence of the needful
statistics, we have been compelled to adopt the course
we have done.
Victoria having, at the close of 1884, a population
exceeding that of New South Wales by 40,000, we have
deducted from Victoria the necessary percentage to
represent this excess, in order to show the exact position
on the basis of population. We venture to say that it is a
very remarkable thing that in spite of the extraordinary
development of our pastoral industry we should have
run Victoria so exceedingly close in other industries,
some of which she has stimulated at great cost for
twenty years. It will be noticed that the principal
excess in favour of Victoria is in female hands, repre-
senting, of course, greatly less wage-earning power than
that of males.
Free Trade permits manufacturing industries to obtain
their raw materials at the lowest possible cost, and the
first element of success in such industries is cheap
material. Naturally, manufactories so established have
the widest range of markets, and no one therefore who
understands these matters is in the least surprised at the
limited power possessed by Victoria in the matter of
exports of manufactures. It seems idle to contend as to
what constitutes raw materials, since clearly the raw
material of one industry is the manufactured article of
another; therefore, if the manufactured articles of certain
industries are protected, it means that the raw materials of
certain other industries can only be obtained at a dis-
advantage.
The Colony of New South Wales possesses manufac-
turing establishments that would be esteemed important
in size, and first-class as regards workmanship, even in
England. And working simply on the natural lines of
Free Trade they have produced results that reflect high
honour on their proprietors, and give abundant reason
for the belief that a great manufacturing future is
before the Colony.
At the Sydney International Exhibition, held in 1879,
the following seven exhibits out of many more may be
referred to as evidence of the progress even then made
in the Colony. (1) Iron, intermediate shaft for oscilla-
ting paddle engine ; award, first degree of merit; report,
a very creditable forging, well finished. (2) Pair of
high-pressure compound launch engines, fitted with link
and having counterbalanced crank and shaft;

without the
stimulation of protection. To produce these varied
articles in open competition with the capital and skill of
Europe may be claimed to be highly satisfactory. In all,
from 2,000 to 3,000 men find employment in building
ships and steamers, in the engineering work in connec-
tion with them, and the dry docks, patent slip, &c.
Considering the cackle of delight that is continually
being raised at the “ very wonderful ” progress of
Victoria, it is not out of place to compare the ship-
building of the two colonies for some years past:—
New South Wales. Victoria.

1884 „ .. 7,663 .. 167
„ .. 7,663 .. 167
In these figures the “ beneficial influence” of Free Trade
is apparent. In Victoria many of the shipbuilders’
materials have to pay tribute to manufacturers, whilst
in New South Wales the shipbuilder is not oppressed in
order that some of his neighbours may be “ protected.”
The manufacture of agricultural implements, carts,
waggons, carriages, coaches, railway carriages, &c., has
become very important, and there are several establish-
ments in the Colony which are on a very extensive scale.
In businesses such as these the benefits of Free Trade are
very distinguishable, as manufacturers are able to supply
themselves with the numerous materials they require at
the lowest prices at which they are obtainable. In 1884
there were throughout the Colony no fewer than 299
manufactories devoted to these special industries, and
the hands employed were stated to number 2,975. These
manufactories are widely scattered, though the principal
of them are to be found in the neighbourhood of
Sydney itself. It is well worthy of note that in 1884
New South Wales exported £23,912 worth of carriages,
carts, waggons, and materials connected therewith, all of
which were made in the Colony. It is entirely unneces-
sary to load this Essay with numerous details, and we
shall not therefore take up space with enumerating the
various manufactories in the purely mechanical trades
that have one after another sprung into existence;
suffice it to say that there is scarce an industry of this
kind which has not its exponent in New South Wales.
The leather and allied trades form a really valuable
cluster of industries, the development of which has pro-
ceeded In the most gratifying manner, and they now
give a large employment to labour. Free Trade has
benefited these industries by giving them access to all
the supplies required in the course of the various manu-
factures without inflicting penalties for the advantage
of other people. To the producer of leather; the manu-
facturer of boots and shoes ; and the manufacturer of
saddlery and harness, the whole world has been open for
the purposes of both purchase and sale. The fancy
leathers of Europe, the various tools and wares required,
have all been available, without any addition to the cost,
except the expenses attending shipment to the Colony.
In 1884 there were employed in these industries the
following number of hands :
Tanneries, &c 796
Boot and shoe manufactories .. .. 2,289
Saddlery and harness manufactories .. 1,068
Making a total of 4,153 hands. When we remember the
lieavy taxation imposed in Victoria in support of similar
industries, it is a matter for genuine surprise that New
South Wales should be so close on the heels of that
colony—indeed, in the case of saddlery and harness, New
South Wales is distinctly ahead. It is worth while com-
paring the exports of the two colonies of boots, shoes,
saddlery and harness.


Total Exports 1884 and 1885.
New South Wales £114,281
Victoria £89,763
It is understood that no re-exports are included, the
figures represent goods actually the product of the
respective colonies. It can be clearly seen that the Free
Trade policy of New South Wales has already given her
a distinct advantage over Victoria in the export trade to
outside countries. It is of very little consequence to
Victoria how fast this outside trade grows —she can
expect but little from it —the bulk of the orders must
come to New South Wales, that is, of course, supposing
her to be true to the policy under which she has become
entitled to it. In the manufacture of clothing, New South
Wales occupies a very creditable position, in 1885 the
number of hands employed was 3,072, about one-half
being females. In Victoria the number was 5,317, about
two-thirds being females. Victoria only arrived at this
position through the agency of a protective tax on the
community of no less than 25 per cent. We are inclined
to think that there are some industries in which a very
high average of employment is not a sign of the highest
degree of prosperity, and in such industries we should
reckon that of the manufacture of clothing. Wages
tend to a low, rather than a high average compared with
that ruling in other industries, and indeed it is work
suited rather to women than to men. We take it as a sign
of the benefits of Free Trade, that New South Wales can
employ her fast-growing population as she does, and
import the bulk of her clothing.
It is pleasant to notice the large number of saw-mills
that overspread the Colony. In 1884 the number was
377, nearly the whole of them being worked by steam.
It is evident that the value of the machinery in the
whole of these mills must amount to a very large sum,
audit is easy to see that, had machinery been subject to
a heavy protective tax, for the benefit of local machinery
manufacturers, that it would have acted as a heavy
handicap on this industry. It can therefore be distinctly
proved that Free Trade has had a “ beneficial influence 1 ’
in the direct development of this important industry.
Of course cheap machinery has tended to the supply of
large quantities of timber at the minimum of cost, and
it is certainly not necessary to use many words to show
the immense importance to a great many trades of cheap
timber. Thus the benefits of Free Trade act and re-act
on trade after trade. In 1884 there were about 3,500 men
employed in the New South Wales saw-mills.
That Victoria should have given a large yearly sum
of money to promote the woollen trade, with the result
that mill after mill has suffered severe reverses, and the
whole trade express a fear of being unable to sustain
competition, unless they are paid still larger sums of
public money, is a state of things that would not at all
prepare us to expect that—without the least protection
—the industry would be able to exist in New South
Wales. Yet, strange to say, several factories on a small
scale have been carried on for years, and it is under-
stood that more than one owner has made money at the
business. How is this possible ? Is it not that cheap
machinery, &c., and enforced self-reliance, in the end,
are, to the industry itself, equal and superior to the
advantages derivable from Protection, and this without
the infliction of taxation on the bulk of the people ?
The hands employed in 1885 numbered 323 in New South
Wales, and in the much-vaunted mills of Victoria to 814.
As far as Victoria is concerned, it is certain the game
was not worth the candle.
Nearly 4,000 men are employed in the brickyards and
lime-kilns of New South Wales. Certainly, to all such
industries. Free Trade can only have been an unmixed
blessing. To be able to buy all tools, implements, carts,
saddlery and harness free of protective taxes, has been,
of course, helpful. We may here just point out that
there are scores of trades that have, perhaps insensibly,
enjoyed the “beneficial influence ” of Free Trade in a
similar manner—thus the proprietors of account-book
manufactories, steam printing establishments, steam
joinery works, steam cabinet works, basket and brush
manufactories, have all been permitted to supply them-
selves with the cheapest machinery and raw materials
the world could offer, and the progress they have made
m amply sufficient to satisfy the admirers of a Free
Trade policy, since the progress that does not spring
from public bounty, must rest on solid foundations.
The free admission of printing-paper and printing-
machinery, has obviously assisted very materially in
developing the newspaper system of the Colony. That
there should be from 150 to 200 newspapers in thus
colony of only one million people, speaks highly for both
the enterprise and prosperity existing in New South
Wales. A signal proof of the “ beneficial influence ” of
Free Trade principles is to be seen in the establishment
in Sydney by a number of American gentlemen of the
Picturesque Atlas Company. This company is executing
art work of the very highest class for the whole of
these colonies, and have been led to open their estab-
lishment in Sydney because of the absence of those
restrictions which exist in certain other colonies. The
company is now spending one thousand pounds weekly
in wages—a sum that might have been lost to the colony
had the principles of Protection dominated its fiscal
policy.
The manufacture of food products is certainly assisted
by the Free Trade policy of the Colony. Free machinery,
tools, tin plates, &c., &c., permit the best to be done that
is possible. In preserved meats, exports are made amount-
ting to from £150,000 to £200,000 per annum, and of
necessity this business would have been more difficult to
carry on had the cost of requisite materials been increased
by protective duties.
At present, more than 2,000 miles of rail ways have either
been built or are in course of construction. The policy
of the Colony has permitted these to be constructed at
the minimum of cost. It would be easy to dilate at
great length on the importance to a country of cheaply-
constructed railways. Every one can see that if by
protective duties the cost is largely increased, that that
increase of cost stands as an impediment to the reduction
to the lowest points of the rates of carriage on goods.
Consequently, therefore, a protective policy creates a
position that tends to the contraction of trade ; and, of
course, on the other hand, Free Trade tends to the
expansion of trade, because the rates of carriage have
not to be added to on account of the effect of protec-
tive duties. That the effect of Free Trade has been bene-
ficial directly to the railway system, and, therefore,
indirectly, through that system to every industry and
every traveller in the Colony, is too clear to admit of
argument.
The various mining industries of the colony call for
special note, as they have been important factors in the
promotion of the prosperity we see around us. The
following minerals were produced in the year 1885 :
Tons. Value.
Coal .. 2,878,863 ~ £1,340,212
Shale .. 27,462 .. 67,289
Copper .. 4,379 .. 209,250
Tin .. 4,815 .. 252,645
Iron .. 4,175 .. 25,793
Total Value .. £1,895,139
These figures represent a very large employment for
both capital and labour, directly as far as production of
minerals is concerned, and indirectly as far as other
industries are concerned. To complete the subject of
mining, we give the particulars of the precious metals
raised in the same year.
Gold £366,388
Silver £343,281
The number of hands employed in coal-mining alone
was 7,097 in 1885. What has been the effect of the Free
Trade policy of the Colony on these important and wide-
spread industries ?We regret that it is impossible to
give even an approximate estimate of the total
machinery, tools, spades, shovels, carts, waggons,
saddlery, harness, &c., in use, but we may remember
that there are 53 coal-mines alone. It will assist our
judgment also to scan the particulars, which the Statis-
tical Register does give, of the machinery in use in 1884
simply in gold-mining—viz., first, quartz-mining, 58
steam-engines, 45 crushing-machines, 227 stamp heads,
&c.; and, second, alluvial mining, 26 steam-engines,
32 puddling-machines, 15 water-wheels. 20 pumps, 81
stamp heads, &c. We must also bear in mind the various
smelting-works for iron, copper, and tin, the size of
which may be judged by the fact that they employ
generally more than 1,000 men. A due consideration of
all these matters will impress us with the fact that the
expenditure of all these concerns on imported material


must necessarily, during the course of the last 25 years,
have been something to which the word enormous may
reasonably be applied. We will not presume to estimate
the number of millions of pounds so spent; but we ask,
If every million pounds had had £250,000 added for pro-
tective taxation, would it not have proved injurious to
these important industries ? Of course the answer must
be in the affirmative ; and if it were possible to estimate
the amount of damage such duties would have inflicted,
then we should also be able to measure with some degree
of exactness the extent of “ the beneficial influence” of
Free Trade in opening up the mining industry of New
South Wales. In passing, it is but just to mention the
fact that the shale-mines have been somewhat stimulated
by the import duty on kerosene oil; these mines have
therefore had the advantages of Free Trade in producing,
and the benefit of Protection in selling. As the shale-
mining forms only a small portion of the total mining of
the Colony it is not necessary to follow up this point—it
does not disturb the general conclusion to which we
have logically arrived, viz., that the policy of Free Trade
has greatly assisted the important mining industries of
New South Wales.
We now approach the part of our subject where the
advantages accruing from a Free Trade policy are not
only enormous, but can be made easily self-evident. We
refer to the shipping industry and interests dependent
upon it. We have already shown the superior position
occupied by New South Wales as far as mere ship-
building is concerned. It would really be foolish to
waste time to prove that Free Trade promotes the pros-
perity of shipping, for the one great aim of Protection is
to stop goods being carried into a country’s ports, or, in
other words, to stop the employment of shipping. We
will now look at the tonnage entering and clearing from
the ports of New South Wales and Victoria :
Tonnage Entered and Cleared.
New South Wales. Victoria.
1860 .. 859,337 .. 1,180,779
1870 1,461,762 .. 1,344,862
1880 .. 2,432,779 .. 2,179,899
1885 .. 4.133,077 .. 3,260,158
These figures show in a very marked manner the growing
superiority of New South Wales, the colony of \ictoria,
once far ahead, being left far behind. It is proper to
remark that there is something deceptive in these
figures when they are judged merely by European
standards; nearly all the European steamers call at
several colonies, and their tonnage is reckoned in each
one—thus the steamer “ Austral,” 5,588 tons register,
calls at Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney, and her ton-
nage, reckoned several times over amounts to a large
total in one voyage. In this way Australian sta-
tistics are often made to appear startlingly large. It
may be remarked that the Victoria figures are swollen
by the addition of 94,644 tons shipping entered at ports
on the Murray. The New South Wales statistics do not
recognize traffic at the river ports, why, it is hard to
say. Were similar figures added for New South Wales,
the superior position of the Colony would be more
apparent than at present. It may be added that in
1884 the New South Wales tonnage was larger even
than that for 1886. .
To judge the full importance of these figures it is
necessary to remember the numerous classes to whom
profitable employment is given by the movements of
shipping—sailors, engineers, firemen, trimmers, carpen-
ters, cooks, stewards, wharf labourers, stevedores, coal-
lumpers, carters, sail-makers, mast and block makers,
pilots, &c. There are 4,000 men on the Register of the
Federated Seamen’s Union in New South Wales, and
there is a very large number outside the union. It is to
be regretted that it is impossible to ascertain with any-
thing like exactness the numbers of the other bodies
mentioned, but it is a thoroughly safe estimate to put at
60,000 the total of the population supported by the ship-
ping industry, wives and children included. It is obvious
that one million tons of shipping do not enter and leave
our porta in excess of the number entering and leaving
the ports of Victoria without affording a large amount of
employment over and above that given in Victoria. Nor
does this extra exhibit all the difference, for steamers that
load and discharge at both Melbourne and Sydney on
their voyages from and to England have more cargo to
land and to load at Sydney than at Melbourne, which
means a greater relative employment for labour. Ship-
ping brings, it must not be forgotten, a large amount of
custom to many trades, thus ship-stores dealers, ship-
chandlers, fruit growers, dairy farmers, butchers, &c.,a1l
find that the prosperity of the shipping industry is
profitable to them.
The advertisement columns of our daily papers afford
splendid evidence of the growth of the shipping trade of
the Colony. Besides all the steamers and vessels engaged
in simple coasting work within the Colony itself, there is
an intercolonial service of great importance, and an
ever-growing service of magnificent fleets of steamships
with England, Europe, America, India, China and else-
where. To dilate on them all, many a glowing para-
graph might be written, but we abstain. Wo may
point out, however, and we do it with pride, that it
is undoubtedly ,to the generous Free Trade principles
of New South Wales that the other colonies are very
largely indebted for the presence of the fine steam-
ships that visit their ports. Had our trade been
confined within the bounds of a selfish protectionist
policy, it must have been held within limits so much
narrower than it has attained that there would not have
been cargo enough to tempt shipowners to the ventures
they now gladly enter upon, hence every colony hi
Australasia has benefitted by the fiscal policy of New
South Wales.
Finally, we claim for Free Trade that It has made
Sydney the great commercial emporium of the Southern
world. Geographically it might be said that this was
her natural position; but in point of fact, it is not many
years since Melbourne, by right of possession of the
bulk of the trade, filled this position. But things have
changed ; just as water seeks its level, so commerce seeks
the channels of freedom. As the forces of ignorance and
selfishness erected Customs barriers in Victoria, they
helped to turn the tide towards Sydney, and, as in Sydney
no obstacle was placed in its way, the commerce of the
Southern Pacific gradually made this port its head-
quarters. There is something enchanting about what
we may term the poetry of commerce, to watch the
ships and steamers of the nineteenth century—many of
them monsters of marine architecture —taking away our
wool, tallow, coal, tin, copper and other products, here of
themselves nearly valueless, and bringing back to us in
exchange for them the products of every nation and clime
under the sun, and of the mightest civilization the world
has ever seen ; surely this is enough to fill the heart and
satisfy the reason of man. And when we find our port
made the depot, the gathering and the distributing
centre of Australasia, we know that our policy of Free
Trade is bringing profit and employment to capital and
to labour, and is at the same time helping to unite
together the various nations of the world in the bondsi
of peaceful enterprise.


suWr
It cannot be denied that vast and various as have beeu
the changes in Australia’s social and political history
luring the last hundred years, the revolution undergone
i the art and science of building has beeu most entire
id desirable. Entire as regards the complete re-
ing of nearly every public buildingiin the colony, and
ible both as regards style, increased magnitude, and
the employment, and therefore bread, it has given to
thousands of the working classes. Of late years
specially the change has been most marked. Palatial
public offices have arisen at many of the street corners.
Valuable properties have been resumed by the Crown,
their rookeries swept away and great stone buildings
ted in their stead, as though by a magician’s wand,
at a cost which, less than twenty years ago, would
tare startled the then Treasurer.
Materials, too, have changed since the earlier days of
ie colony, The porous red-brick has given way to stone
most structures of any pretensions, and shingles to
rrugated iron and slate.
These changes are. to a certain extent, caused by the
Rural advance of the times, but a great deal has been
ought by government enterprise, and brought about
the private capital which has opened out the immense
[uarries of Australia, and particularly those adjacent to
Sydney.
These latter now furnish the building commodity of the
ountry, and although only worked, as it were, on the
surface, pay out their hundreds of thousands of tons
umually, and build enormous structures almost as quickly
is they do the fortunes of their owners.
They are the fringes of that immense bed of sand-stone
vhich extends from the Hawkesbury to about one
mndred miles in a southerly direction —a mighty work
>f nature’s dreamy past. Whether this bed is a marine
ieposit, or has been formed by the drift-sand of bygone
iges, is a mystery which will perhaps never be elucidated,
dthough many prominent geologists incline to the belief
;liat it has been caused by drift-sand. Certainly this
ould in some measure account for the stone’s extreme
>£tness when freshly cut, and the entire absence of any
difying properties. This latter causes it to oxidize
hen exposed to the air, and in a few years to change
rom a warm sienna, or brick-dust color, to a deep umber'
ind to become in time almost as hard as granite.
There is no doubt that the possession of this mine of
milding wealth has caused Sydney to far surpass Mel-
bourne and Adelaide in the matter of street architecture,
though it must be a cause of continual regret that so
wuy of the stately edifices are erected on poor and
1-chosen sites, where their magnificence is dwarfed in
arrow roadways, the average width of the widest of
’lnch is little more than one chain from each building
The whole of the public buildings of New South Wales,
icluding post offices, schools, court-houses, and forti-
'ations, may be roughly estimated in value at between
u and eleven millions of pounds. This, of course, does
it include the land, which in school, asylum, and gaol
grounds must necessaiily amount to an immense sum of
money. So in giving a rough outline of the more impor-
tant buildings of this colony an approximate value of
the property will be included.
ttutHungg
GOVERNMENT HOUSE
is one of the few public buildings which were not
designed in the colony, but by Mr. Blower, the architect
for the front part of Buckingham Palace, to the order
of the Imperial Government. The foundation stone
was laid on the 26th of January, 1830, so that its jubilee
may be celebrated with the colony’s centenary. The
ceremony, an important one at the time, was performed
by Col. Snodgrass, who was Acting Governor before the
arrival of Sir George Gipps. The building contains state
rooms of somewhat small proportions, perhaps, but
decorated in lavish style, and private rooms for the
Governor and his household fitted up with every regard
to comfort. As years go by it will probably be found
advisable to provide a more sumptuous house for the
head of the Government, but with the present building in
the Domain will disappear one of the few remaining
landmarks of the early history of the colony.
THE GENERAL POST OFFICE.
Very many years ago, when the old Post Office premises
were becoming inadequate and totally unsuitable for the
growing requirements of the people, a piece of land,
having a frontage of 445 feet to Clarence-street, by a
depth of 164 feet to Wyuyard-street, was resumed by the
Government.
Designs, to suit this site, were obtained from England.
In 1854, the sum of £40,000 was placed on the Estimates
for the purpose of commencing the work.
The plans obtained not being considered suitable to
the requirements, it was decided to erect a new building
on the old site. A temporary wooden building was
therefore, in 1863, erected in Wynyard-square, and the
dilapidated binding, which had been erected in 1821, was
razed to the ground and sold by public auction. Two of
the pillars which had supported the Doric portico were
the only things reserved, and these were retained
for marking the measured nautical mile in the harbor.
One is still to be seen at Bradley’s Head, where it is
ever likely to remain as a water-mark of the distance
between that place and Port Denison, and as a landmark
of the earlier history of the colony.
The first stone of the principal arch of the new building
was laid by his Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh,
who was then on a visit to the Australian colonies.
It is a solid piece of heavy masonry, with three
magnificent frontages of 78 feet to George-street, 353 feet
3 inches to the proposed new street, and 108 feet to Pitt-
street. It has an elevation of 80 feet from the pavement to
the top of the parapet capping, and an altitude of 168 J feet
from the pavement to the foot of the clock tower. A
further altitude of 43 feet to the top of the cupola, and
thence 31 feet to the base of the flagstaff, making an
an altitude total of over 240 feet from pavement to top of
tower.
At about 200 feet from the basement is built a light
room, wherein is a lantern, from the centre of which a
powerful arc will flash out the hours. This will cause
the hour-hammer to descend upon a five-ton bell, at an
altitude of over 220 feet. At the moment of it striking,
the face of the clock will be visible for more than 60
miles round, and, on a clear night, the dial will be clearly
seen from the mountain ranges, and out at sea for


a like distance. Thus, the exact Sydney mean time will
be obtainable every night, and the Government are to
be congratulated on the fact of having the highest
clock, of this description, in the world. In addition to
the hour-bell, there will be four other bells of four tons
each, to chime the quarters, half, and three-quarters.
There will also be fixed a fire alarm, which will connect
with every fire station in the city or suburbs, by the
means of electricity.
From the attic floor to where the ascent is made by
lift, a spiral staircase arises to the carillon room of the
tower. From this elevation, a panoramic view of sur-
passing splendor of the city of Sydney may be gained ,
and from this enormous height will be signalled the mail
steamers of each company, with flags by day, and by
powerful lanterns at night.
The size of the post office is simply incredible, the
sorting and despatch room alone covering an area of
200,000 cubical feet, which space will at night time be
lighted by a reflecting lantern combining, by mechanical
contrivance, an ample ventilator.
The rooms are lofty, large, and apparently numberless.
At all events it would be next to an impossibility to
enumerate and thoroughly describe the different com-
partments. It will therefore suffice to explain the
character of the interior of one, and that will perhaps
act as a fair guide to the others. For instance, then,
the banking room is a magnificent chamber 60 feet
by 43 feet, and 24 feet high. It is floored throughout
with ornamental white and black marble tiles, relieved
by three polished mahogany tables, set at even distances,
for the use of the public. The ceiling is a work of the
most elaborated order of decoration, and from the centre
is suspended an exquisite pendant chandelier. The
cornices are let in with marble statuary, enriched in
gold, and the walls, which are painted in delicate marble
tint, emblazoned with allegorical designs, are relieved by
Corinthian pilasters, worked in veined marble and gold.
Add to this, woodwork of the most massive and costly
description, a heavy carved counter, 3 feet 6 inches wide,
running the entire length of the room, and a fair idea
may be gained of the beauty of the interior of this
palatial building.
The lower portions of the building comprise offices for
the Postmaster-General, the secretary, electric telegraph
superintendent, clerks and operators ; also repairing
rooms, sorting chambers, stables, and lavatories. From
the attic to the basement the same finish is manifest.
The whole is built of Pyrmont freestone, cut in
unusually large blocks, and polished and unpolished
Jloruya granite. The floorings are mostly of concrete
and iron, and the general designs were drawn by the
Colonial Architect.
The building has cost about £303,000, irrespective
of the value of land, which is generally estimated at
about £lOO,OOO.
THE LANDS OFFICE*
Tenders were called for this building in 1876, and
one for the portion fronting Bridge-street, accepted for
£62,500. The site chosen was the same block of land
on which the old building had stood for so many years,
with the exception that the boundaries were extended
to embrace the whole block.
The first half of the office was completed in 1880, and
given over to the use of the government; the total cost
having been £87,596. The coat of the building win
ultimately completed is estimated at £200,000.
The Lands Office is a substantial pile of Pyrmont fn
stone. It possesses a frontage to Bridge-street of abc
200 feet, with present depth of about 66 feet arid 50 f(
to Gresham and Loftus streets respectively.
In point of magnificence it will compare favorab
with any similar building in the world, and is erected
the composite order of architecture. It is distinguis
able from many of the colonial buildings by a bro;
colonnade, which runs round the entire first floor, i
massive columns and beautiful groined arches being oi
of the best features about the exterior. The elevatic
cannot be less than 70 feet from pavement to portic
and a large octagonal copper dome rises to a furth
altitude of about 30 feet. Apart from the streets alreai
mentioned, it is bounded, on the north by a triangul
park, and the statue erected to the memory of the la
H. S. Hort, on the east to another Government resen
and on the west to the Sydney Exchange. The southe;
boundary will, when extended, face the Hoads Bran
Office, and many other handsome buildings.
THE COLONIAL SECRETARY AND SECRETARY FOR
WORKS OFFICES.
The Departments of Colonial Secretary and the Secre
tary for Public Works are housed in a building whose
stately proportions and splendid position at once mart
their importance and the growth of the colony. Ii
stands on an elevated site, which presents a frontage oi
227 feet to Bridge-street, 140 feet to Macquarie-street
and 80 feet to Phillip-street, and effectually shuts out the
possibility of meaner buildings raising their heads in it
vicinity and detracting from its beauty. The advantagi
is one that some of the public buildings of the colon)
do not share, for it is not an uncommon thing for i
princely structure to be found in a position when
very small tenements and narrow streets invariabl]
obscure its fine proportions. In this respect, th
Colonial Secretary and Secretary for Works’ Offices an
fortunate; and, whatever criticism may be made o
their design, no one for a moment will deny that, seei
towering over the buildings which encircle the lowe
ground near the Circular Quay, or the verdant trees tha
shade the'sloping shores of Farm Cove, they present
massive and stately appearance.
The building was commenced in about Septemh
1869, and completed about March, 1880, when it v
formally taken possession of by the Government. T
cost of the structure is estimated at £129,000, and, wi
the solidity of the masonry, and the lavish style in whi
it is furnished, together with the exceedingly high pr
of labor are considered, there will, perhaps, be little
wonder at that the cost was not greater.
Like most of the buildings designed by Mr. Barnf
this is described as being in the style of the Italii
Renaissance. Whatever orders of architecture ha'
been utilised —and they are many—the result b
not been inharmonious, but, on the contrary, o'
of the blending of some of the features of one ord
with those of another, has come a simple yet dignift
style. Elaborate ornamentation in this Governme
building has not been adopted, and the architi
has relied on stately pillars, and graceful but plain arch
to give effect to his design. The building is aim


ted entirely of Pyrmont freestone, though
granite has here and there been incorporated
ith it. It rises to the height of four storys, and the
stance from the basement to the ridge at the highest
point is 90 feet. There are three entrances —one in
Macquarie-street for the Colonial Secretary, one in
ge-street for the public, and another in Phillip-
it for the Secretary for Works. The porch over the
er is supported by polished granite columns.
The corners of the building in Macquarie-street and
Phillip-street are decorated with allegorical statues,
sculptured by Signor Simonetti, a gentleman who has
executed several important works for the Government.
They are sheltered in niches, rising one above another.
In the first niche, on the Macquarie-street side, is the
statue of Wisdom, in the second Justice, and in the
third Mercy ; while on the Phillip-street side, are Labor,
Science, and Art.
The interior of the building is divided into two parts, one
for the Colonial Secretary’s Department and the other
for the Secretary for Works. Both portions are sumptu-
ously furnished and are designed with every regard to the
comfort and health of every public servant, from the
lowest to the highest. There are 90 rooms and 5 strong
ims in the whole building and access to them is
ivided by staircases and hydraulic lifts. With the
exception of state rooms, which are larger and more
elaborate in design than the others, there is not much to
call for remark as one room is in most respects the fellow
of another. The room for the Executive Council and
Cabinet meeting, in the Colonial Secretary’s office, is
expensively fitted up and the lofty ceiling is painted in
•ty colors, finished and enriched with friezes and
edallions. The principal color used in the other rooms
green relieved, however, in gold. The arrangements
; the building, whether for sanitation, public con-
ice or safety, are as perfect as their experienced
ler could make them, and in all respects Sydney’s
me and Foreign Offices, for such they may be called,
worthy of the oldest city in Australia.
THE GLADESVILLK ASYLUM.
Built on a beautiful rising slope on the north bank of
ie Parramatta River, and extending as far back as
irban Creek (whence its original name), the Glades-
lle Asylum commands a greater and more lovely view,
fined with fresh air, than any other similar institu-
te the country. It is bounded on the north by a
lificent stretch of rich undulating country, by a
y little village, and the extensive parishes of Ryde
md the Field of Mars; on the east, by an arm of the
Parramatta, and a sweeping view down the river, with
dimpses of the turrets of Sydney in the extreme
ice ; on the south, by the waters of the Parramatta,
of the outskirts of the Parramatta districts, with
i vaporish Blue Mountains beyond, and the parishes
Liberty Plains and Concord ; and on the west, by
rtion of the village, and the ribbon-like winding head
the river.
The building, or rather aeries of buildings, stands on a
a rge area of land, tastefully laid out as cricketing,
ixereise, drying, bowling, and pleasure grounds.
If contains every department necessary for the
se to which it is devoted. It possesses also sea
and lavatories, and elegant fresh water baths.
It is difficult to name the sum which the original
portion of this public work cost, but it is estimated that
the additions, alterations, repairing &c., from 1863 to
1887, have amounted to £88,710.
CALLAN PARK ASYLUM.
This building, standing on a magnificent site, situate
in Callan Park, between Balmain proper and Petersham,
in the parish of Petersham, and County of Cumberland,
was erected in 1881, from designs by the Colonial Archi-
tect, at a cost altogether of £240,302, besides other
items, large and small, the exact amount of which it has
been found impossible to arrive at.
Callan Park Asylum is bounded, on the north by
Balmain ; on the east, by a main road, 66 feet wide ; on
the south, by the municipality of Petersham; and on
the west, by an arm of the Parramatta River.
It is provided with every requisite likely to add to the
well-being and comfort of the inmates, possesses exten-
sive pleasure grounds, and is well laid back from the
main gates, which are approached from the main road.
The asylum embraces a vast number of rooms, com-
partments, and offices, including superintendent’s
quarters, matron’s rooms, keepers’ dormitories, besides a
maze of wards and apartments, padded rooms, morning,
evening, private, and reception rooms for the use of the
patients. The sanitary arrangements are excellent, and
meet the requirements of the large number of persons
employed or confined in the building.
The Parramatta Asylum stands on the low-lying flats
of the south-east portion of Parramatta, in the parish of
St. John and County of Cumberland. It is a very old
building, notwithstanding that it has been elaborated
upon and a great portion re-built. The old place is
entered into by a long court yard, and is built more in
the style of a prison than anything else, with its squat
buildings, with projecting roofs, its paved yards, high
walls and, in many cases, heavily barred windows.
THE NEWCASTLE ASYLUM
is an old rubble building built by convict labor, and
standing in a low-lying but extensive domain. It is
approached from the lodge gates by a long road which
divides, as it were, the main building into separate
wards. It was originally intended for barracks for the
soldiery stationed at Newcastle.
The cost of the additions and alterations to the
Newcastle asylum from 1871 to 1886 has been £21,837.
THE PENITENTIARIES OF NEW SOUTH W ALES.
The colony of New South Wales possesses a criminal
population of about 5 per cent., has 20 gaols, about 30
police prisons and lock-ups, with numerous stations and
buildings. These places of detention naturally represent
a considerable sum of public money, more particularly
in the cases of the gaols proper, such as Darlinghurst,
Berrima, Bathurst, Goulburn, Maitland. Parramatta, and
a few others. The average annual cost for the last 30
years of maintaining these buildings in repair and
adding to them from time to time has been no less than
£26,000.


DARLINGHURST GAOL
is an old institution, but containing every modern
appliance of prison organisation. It stands on about
four acres of valuable property, which space is utilised to
the very best advantage. It is situate in Darlinghurst
—whence its name —in the city of Sydney, County of
Cumberland, and is erected of freestone, with iron and
wood fittings. It is bounded, on the north, by a road
1 chain wide, and the beautiful suburb of Darlinghurst;
on the east, by a road, Green Park, and the districts of
Paddington; on the south, by the criminal courthouse,
and the intersection of South Head road with Oxford-
street ; and on the west, by a 66-feet road, the receiving
house, and the low-lying suburb of Woolloomooloo.
The grim rectangular exterior—the present massive
wall—of Darlinghurst Gaol, was erected only a few
years ago, at a distance of 2 or 3 feet beyond the old
wall, which still exists as an inner shell, and as an
additional strength to the prison. It is a plain stone
wall with heavy porticos, and at each of the four comers
has a sentry-warder's box and guard-room. The western
side is the main frontage, from whence the prison is
entered through heavy iron gates, which run on rollers.
The courtyards of the gaol are flagged with stone,
some slight exceptions being observable about the flower-
beds and the small garden in front of the governor’s
house—a substantial, though sombrous-looking dwelling,
In the exact centre of the gaol is a long stone building,
facing north and south, from which the wards branch off
like the points and half-points of a compass, and in such
a way as to afford a comprehensive view of anything
going on to the four armed sentries, who are stationed
on the four top comers of the outer wall. These wards
are devoted to various uses. In the workshops, long and
short-sentence men are made to work at their respective
trades —bootmaking, carpentering, tailoring, and mat-
making—the surplus of which is sold to the public at the
bare value of material and labor.
The following sum represents the actual expenditure
in the Colonial Architect’s Department on this building
during the last 23 years:—£29,2s4 15s. The present
outer wall, which was erected in 1880, cost £9,146 4s. 9d.
There are 81 other gaols in the colony, 13 of which
have been built during the last 20 years. The following
figures will give the cost of the erection of these
(marked thus “), the after expenses of extending
and repairing included; also costs for extending and
repairing all other gaols in New South Wales, for a
period of 23 years:—Armidale, £13,823 13s. 6d.; Albury,

these figures to the cost of Darlinghurst, Berrima,
Maitland, and Parramatta (extension and repairs only),
and we have the following .-—Cost of erecting 13, and
repairing 31 gaois, as above, £348,157 15s. Bd.; Dari:

matta, £9,666 Os. 7d.; Maitland, £16,748 4s. 7d.—Gr
total, £421,470 18s. Bd.
PARRAMATTA GAOL
is a huge building, situate on the outskirts. It ha
much of the appearance of Darlinghurst, and is cot
ducted on the same principle. The computed cost ft
additions, &c., during the last seven years, amounts to
total of £9,665 Os. 7d.
EAST MAITLAND GAOL
stands on the east side of the railway station, and is
long stone building, which, seen from the train, has tl
appearance of having been erected on a considerab
height. The expense of repairing, &c., for the last :
years has been £16,748 4s. 7d.
BERRIMA GAOL
is the great penal establishment of the colony, and
conducted on much the same lines as is the penitentis
of Pentridge, in Melbourne. It is the gloomiest-looki
gaol in the colony, and has the strictest discipline of a
in Australia. For the severity of its code it is rema:
able; and the sum which has been expended on additi
and improvements amounts to £17,645 2s. lOd.
LIGHT-HOUSES.
Macquarie Lujht. —Until recently, this light-hoiv
standing on the South Head of Port Jackson, w
acknowledged to be the finest in the world, and evi
now, in the power and brilliancy of its light and tl
perfectness of its apparatus, it is inferior only to one
two. It was the first light-house on this side the equat
into which electricity was introduced as a lightii
medium, and is at present the only light-house on tl
Australian coast lighted by this agency. In 1873 tl
site of the present light-house vfas occupied by an o
structure, possessing an inferior light, which for sou
time had been found by mariners inadequate. Tl
Colonial Architect was consulted, who, finding the buil
ing in every way defective and unsuitable for a larg
light, advised that a new building should be put up, ar
the best lighting apparatus obtained from England. 1
1878 the sum of £15,000 was voted towards the work, ai
the Agent-General was instructed to call for tenders i
England for the supply of the necessary apparats
Experienced judges recommended that the optical app
ratus, known as the first order 16-metre holophota
which was specially designed and constructed for tl
electric light, and provided with a dioptric mirror I
utilising the landward sector of the light, and a I
Meriteus Magneto-Electric Machine, which combinf
the greatest reliability with the maximum efficient-
should be obtained. This was resolved upon, and i
thf t in case of accident there would be no danger of tl
light being extinguished, the machinery was ordere
in duplicate. Messrs. Chance Brothers and Compar
of Birmingham, supplied the machinery, at a cost
£6,959, and in January, 1882, it arrived in Sydney. Tl
entire building cost £13,000, which, added to t!
machinery, made a total cost of £20,000. The lantei
lenticular apparatus and clock-work machinery we
erected, and the machines, and gasometers, pipes, tanl


and gas supply were ready for use by August. The light-
house was permanently lighted on the Ist June, 1883.
The electric apparatus has never been at fault, but in
case of emergency, either gas or oil lamps may be
be employed, without more than a few seconds being
lost in making the change. The light, as already
stated, is of the kind known as the 16-sided first order
dioptric holophotah It revolves so as to show a flash
every minute, of an intensity equalling between five and
six million candles. The distance at which it can lie
seen at sea is freely estimated from 40 to 60 miles.
The tower in which the light is sheltered rises to a
height of 58 feet, and is surmounted by a balcony running
all round the structure just underneath the lantern. It
is built of stone quarried in the neighborhood, and is a
structure of remarkable solidity. Two parallel wings
run out from the tower, and these give to the base of the
structure a length of 72 feet and a width of 23 feet. In
the southern wing are fitted the electrical apparatus and
the gas engines which work them ; the northern wing is
divided into a waiting room for visitors and other offices.
Tanks, pumps, and a gas-holder, supplied by special main
from Sydney, which have been specially designed to meet
the requirements, take up some of the remaining
ground of the light-house enclosure.
Green Cape Light claims some special reference, because
its tower, with one exception the loftiest along the coast,
is built entirely of concrete, a material which has not
been used for the purpose in this or any of the other
colonies. Its tower rises to a height of 68 feet, a revolving
dioptric white light, has a focal plane of 144 feet above
high water mark. The contract for the building was
accepted on the 29th December, 1880, and completed on
Ist November, 1883, when, lighting apparatus having
been fitted, the light-house was illuminated for the
first time. The total cost of the tower and lighting
apparatus was £17,936.
Montagu Island Light, built of grey granite quarried in
the island, has a fixed and flashing light, possessing a focal
flame of 262 feet above high water mark. It stands on
an eminence above which its tower rises to the height of
39 feet 9 inches, measuring from floor to floor. The
structure was commenced in 1880 and completed in 1882.
Cape St. George’s Light, situated a little South of Jervis
Bay, was built about 28 years ago. It is furnished with
an old stationary light which, however, serves its purpose
very well.
Port Stephens Light is an old catoptric reflecting light,
possessing a focal plane of 126 feet. The tower, built
some 30 years ago, is 51 feet high.
Seal Rods Light, situated on one of the points of that
name, is built of brick on stone foundations. The tower
is only 21 feet 6 inches high, but the elevation is sufficient,
owing to height of the point, to give it a focal plane of
258 feet.
Bnrrenjoey Light, standing close to the entrance of
Broken Bay, is built of stone. The tower, which is fitted
with a red dioptric light, of the second order, with a focal
plane of 371 feet, is 80 feet high.
Solitary Island Light— the most northern of our light-
houses, stands on the South Solitary Bock.
FORTIFICATIONS.
It is roughly estimated that the New South Wales
Government has, on its more modem fortifications, spent
£200,000, of which £40,000 have been expended at New-
castle.
Commencing at the north side of Port Jackson, the
first defence work arrived at is at Bradley’s Head, where
there is a fort constructed for three guns, with the
necessary magazines and quarters.
At George's Head, there is a battery of four guns, with
shell rooms, and permanent quarters for the defending
forces. Under the head, almost on a line with the
water, are two casemate batteries, which, constructed at
great cost, are regarded as the most modern and perfect
defence works in the colony. The batteries are protected
in front with 15-inch armor plates, and on the top with
iron girders of great strength, which support a roof
composed of massive timber, concrete, and stone work.
They are armed with three 18-tou guns, of the type
known as Armstrong muzzle-loading rifle, which is
principally in use in the colony’s fortifications.
Middle Head Battery, placed so as to command the
entrance of the harbor, mounts two 25-ton mechanically
loading guns, perhaps the heaviest calibre employed
here. The guns and works are placed entirely under
cover, so that the only person who would be exposed
would be the cannoneer.
Inner Middle Head has four 80-lb. muzzle-loading rifle
guns.
On the south side of the harbor, near Camp Cove, is a
battery of five guns of heavy calibre, and on the side of
the cliff, pointing southward, are placed three 18-ton
guns. Alterations are going on at present, with a view
to making the whole of South Head defensible. The
rocks are being scarped to make walls, which will take
in the whole of the road near the lighthouse and the
surrounding laud for some distance. Further on, at
Steel Point, is a battery of three 80-pounder muzzle-
loading rifle guns.
The fortifications at Botany, situated at Bone Island,
a little south of La Perouse, will be of a very complete
description when finished. They comprise a very strong
casemate lottery, armed with one 18-ton gun, and several
guns of lighter calibre, placed to command every side of
the port. The works, which have already cost £30,000,
are still incomplete, and provision has yet to be made
for machine guns, such as Gatlings and Nordenfeldts.
Magazines, shell rooms, &c., are situated under ground.
The defences of Newcastle are far from being complete,
though more than £40,000 have been spent on them up
to the present time. The batteries are constructed for,
and armed with, three 12-ton guns and one 80-pounder.
A casemate battery, which is designed to communicate
with, and control a proposed line of submarine mines, is
constructed for three 80-lb. rifle guns. Besides these
works, extensive barracks, shell rooms, and magazines are
in process of construction.
THE COURTS.
The court houses of the colony are mostly built of
brick and plaster, but the court at Darlinghurst, and a few
of the lower courts in Sydney and in the country, are
constructed of stone.


Taking the head or Supreme Court, at corner of King
and Elizabeth streets, we have a plain building of the old
school, with heavy brick and cement colonnades. It is
distinguishable only for its antiquity and its utter
uselessness for the purposes to which it is still devoted.
It is an unpretentious building, containing Equity and
Divorce Chambers, besides the ordinary Jury courts,
offices of the Master in Lunacy, sheriff, and clerks, besides
j edges’ private chambers, &c.
Next in importance is the District Court, a tribunal
for the deciding of civil cases. It is a brick building
at the top of King-street. Within it are jury or ordinary
courts, offices of the registrar, clerks, bailiffs and judges’
chambers.
The other city courts are petty debts’ and police
courts and presided over by a bench of magistrates.
They consist of the “ Central,” a very old building
sltnate at the corners of George, Druitt and York streets,
and the “Water Police,” situate near Circular Quay, an
old structure, but with a very fine stone elevation lately
erected at a cost of £7,767.
Similar courts are situated at St. Leonards, a splendid
building with heavy pillared colonnade, fronting Lane
Cove Road, at Balmain, Redferu, and Newtown.
The Newcastle Court is very much in the style of the
St. Leonards budding. It combines jury and magistrates
courts and police stations.
The total cost, during the last twenty years, of building
courthouses has been £280,000, and the number erected
128, while the costs of repairs of same and older courts
have amounted to £130,000 for a like period. The
expense of building police stations and lock-ups during
the last twenty years has been £268,000, and the number
203, the repairs amounting to £60,000.
Thus it will be seen that the courts and police offices
of New South Wales have, during a period of twenty
years, cost upwards of £700,000.
THE PUBLIC LIBRARY.
The Public Library is a plain but massive building of
stone, and having frontages to Macquarie and Bent
streets. It possesses a free lending branch, and a
spacious and lofty reading-room capable of seating
about 150 visitors. On its shelves may be found volumes
many centuries old, and on that account alone very rare,
while there may occasionally be seen portfolios of sepia
drawings and tracings from Michael Angelo and other
masters.
In 1885, the library was extended down Bent-street,
the additions costing upwards of £17,000.
THE SYDNEY MUSEUM
is a fine Doric pile, situate at the corner of College and
William streets, in the city of Sydney. The main eleva-
tion has much of the style of the British Museum, though
on a much smaller scale.
It is built of freestone, and is divided into six parts.
The greater portion of the building is old, but large
additions were made in 1864, at a cost of £19,914, and a
new wing was erected in 1867 for the sum of £4,995;
also a few improvements in 1886.
The main frontage is to the north, and has a very
classical appearance. Standing well back from the
street, and on a considerable elevation, it comprises two
wings, with long windows, with triangular i>orticos well
relieved from the building. These wings are divided by
a massive piece of work, with heavy columns supportini
the finest pediment portico of any building to be foum
in Sydney.
The western frontage to Hyde Park is a plain one, and
contains three rows of long windows with triangular
porticos. The bareness of the elevation, however, is
redeemed by a few fine pilasters, whose exquisitely
designed capitals support a triangular pediment of rare
beauty. The interior of the Museum contains a comfort-
able residence for the curator, and excellent quarters for
the assistants and housekeepers. The portion devoted to
the use and instruction of the public is divided into six
parts—a basement, ground, first and second floors, and
two galleries. The basement is lighted by lofty sky-
lights, and contains lepidopterous specimens of consider-
able value. The varieties are carded, and shown to
artistic advantage in long glass cases, which run down
the entire length of the compartment.
The ground floor is well covered with objects of
interest, such as stuffed animals —marsupials, the genus
bovine and feline, and a few beautifully preserved rep-
tiles and lizards, besides a mammoth skeleton (now
falling to pieces) of a mastodon, fossils, and a thousand
other things, gathered together at great expense and
labor.
The first floor is mostly devoted to the exhibition
of stuffed sharks of every description, swordfish, dogfish,
and table varieties without number ; while in a wing on
the same floor, are shown Devon marbles, and many
valuable geological wonders. On the second floor is an
interesting collection of birds, from the tiniest bullfinch
to the largest of the falcon family. In many of these
specimens a praiseworthy attempt has been made to show
the birds in their natural state.
THE SYDNEY OBSERVATORY.
Considering its importance, the Observatory has cost
less money than any other public building in the
city. The initial cost of erection was small, and the
only monks which have since been expended on it
would be more than covered by £6,000. Notwithstanding,
it is a picturesque old place, with its grey and ivy-clad
walls. Built on the highest land in Sydney it commands
a view to every point of the compass—a view which
extends for many miles around, and enables the visitor
to discern ships on the horizon, objects of interest in the
city, and rain clouds on the tops of the Blue Mountains.
In the old Gothic tower, surrounded by charts, com-
passes, telescopes and other instruments of science, the
astronomer pursues his silent studies, aud observes the
movements of the heavenly bodies. On this tower is
displayed a one o’clock time-ball, which is every day run
up at about 5 minutes to one, and which is as punctually
let fall at the stroke of the hour.
The Observatory also has a flagstaff and a code of
signals, which allow the initiated to be informed of the
arrival of English, foreign aud intercolonial ships in the
waters of Port Jackson.
PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
Since the passing of the Public Schools Act public
schools have arisen in every suburb, even in places
possessed of only a few dozen residents, and in the erection
of these national institutions the most thoughtful con-
sideration lias been given to large and airy class rooms,
to extensive aud open recreation grounds, and lastly, but
most important of all, to the sanitary arrangements.
Mention may be made of the following schools
Fort-street, Sydney, aud Crown-street, Surrey Hills, both
particularly fine buildings, and erected on large and well
laid out areas, aud the schools in Derwent-street, Forest
Lodge—a new structure of free-stone and red brick—in
Darling-street, Balmain, William-street. Abercrombie-
street, Sydney, and in North Shore.


Mater
Sydney Water Supply,
NOTES ON THE UPPER, NEPEAN SCHEME.
THE source of supply is the waters of the Nepean, (Bor-
deaux, and Cataract rivers ; the united drainage area of
the two former rivers is 284 square miles, that of the
Cataract 70 square miles—in all 354 square miles.
The average annual rainfall on the gathering ground
is 54 inches.
The average flow of the rivers amounts to 106,000,000
gallons annually, of which the Cataract contributes
24.500.000, and the Nepean, including the Cordeaux,
80.600.000. Of this quantity there would be available
for supply, on an average season, 34,675,000 gallons,
equal to 95,000,000 gallons daily, the balance running
to waste in the rivers.
A concrete dam, 11 feet 6 inches high, deflects the
stream through the Nepean tunnel; the top of the dam
is 439-60 feet over high water, Sydney harbor. The
tunnel from the Nepean to the Cataract river, called
the Nepean tunnel, is 4J miles in length. Sectional
area 86J square feet, inclination 2 feet 6 inches per mile,
capacity 95,000,000. gallons daily.
Below the outlet of the tunnel, a masonry dam has
been thrown across the Cataract river, which intercepts
the united water of the two rivers, and diverts it into the
Cataract tunnel. The greatest height of this dam is
16 feet 3 inches, R. L. of top, 426-00, or 2 feet over crown
of the Cataract tunnel. This tunnel has a sectional
area of 71£ square feet; inclination, 3 feet 6 inches per
mile, carrying capacity 155,000,000 gallons daily. Length
1| miles.
Both the Nepean and Cataract tunnels are unlined.
At the outlet of the Cataract tunnel the water is
delivered into an open canal, and thence to Prospect
there is an alternation of canals, tunnels, and pipe
aqueducts, 28J miles being open canals, J mile pipe
aqueducts, 5J miles in tunnels, nearly all of which are
lined throughout with brickwork.
Through the sandstone country, which extends for
a distance of about 12 miles from the outlet of the
Cataract tunnel, the channel has been formed with
straight or slightly battered walls.
The depth from berme to bottom is 10 feet, width 12
feet 6 inches, depth of water 8 feet; the fall is at the
rate of 1 foot 9 inches per mile. Where lining was
necessary the walls have been built of masonry, set dry
or on cement, as the circumstances of the case dictated.
Prom the termination of the sandstone country, the canal
is mainly through shale and clay, and the section adopted
has sloping sides.
The dimensions are : width at bottom, 6 feet, sides
slope of 1 to 1, depth from top of berme 9 feet, top width
23 feet, andi width at top water level, 19 feet; depth of
water 7 feet.
The sides and bottom are protected with stone pitching
9 inches thick. The inclination of this channel is 2 feet
per mile.
The canal above Prospect terminates in a basin, with
an overflow weir, /leading the water into a concrete
Supplies
channel, down which it flows into the reservoir. The
inclination of this channel is 1 in 38-25, the level of the
overflow weir at the end of canal is 243" 15, that is 48'15
feet above the proposed high water of reservoir.
In addition to the Nepean and Cataract tunnels, already
referred to, there are twelve other tunnels, in all about
5| miles long. The general sectional area of these
tunnels is 56J square feet, and the fall 6 feet per mile.
With the exception of one tunnel, 1,000 yards in length,
they are lined with three rings of brickwork, in cement.
In the portion of the work, from the outlet of the
Cataract tunnel, to about 8J miles below it, the line
crosses eight deep creeks, and afterwards the Great
Southern Railway. Across these breaks, the water is
carried by wrought iron flumes, some 8 feet, and some
7 feet 6 inches in diameter, supported on masonry piers
with concrete abutments.
The capacity of the works above Prospect is slightly
over 150,000,000 gallons daily.
Prospect Reservoir.
The main storage reservoir is at Prospect, about 20J
miles from Crown-street service reservoir. Its leading
dimensions are :—•
Area of watershed, 2,361 acres.
„ water surface, 1,261 acres.
R.L. top of dam, 209 feet above high water, Sydney.
High water level, 195.
Lowest level to which water can be drawn for
supply, 170'00.
Width of dam on top, 30 feet.
Slopes, 3 to 1 inside, 2J to 1 outer, with 15 feet
bermes at R.L. 175 and 147.
Width of by-wash, 100 feet.
Maximum height of dam, 84 - 77. feet,
Length, 110 chains.
Greatest depth of puddle trench, 50 feet at the
deepest part of bank.
Puddle wall width on top, 8 feet, side slopes 1 in 8.
Puddle trench side slopes, 1 in 8.
The water from the reservoir is drawn through a
tunnel carried round the east end of the dam, by means
of two 48-inch pipes, and delivered into the canal leading
from the reservoir.
A 30-inch main has been laid from the basin above the
reservoir to the canal below it, for the purpose of supply-
ing the latter independently of the reservoir, and also to
give head for working,valves, &c.
The 48-inch pipes, referred to above, also serve for
emptying the reservoir.
The canal below the reservoir is 4J- miles long, and the
cross section is partly with vertical walls, and partly
Y shaped.
The high water level at the reservoir end of canal
is 175-50. The level of the top of canal is the same
throughout the entire length of this section, viz., 177-50
this arrangement allows an increased head to be obtained
for the works nearer Sydney.
Owing to the nature of the ground, 900 feet of this
section had to be covered in, and is virtually a culvert
under pressure. The fall in canal is at the rate of
6 inches per mile.

the water will flow through pipes.
From the pipe-head to Pott’s Hill, a distance of 4|
miles, the pipes are of wrought iron or mild steel, 6 feet
diameter. At Pott’s Hill the pipe terminates in a
screening chamber, from which the 48-inch main starts.
The capacity of the canal and 6-feet pipes, from Pros-
pect to Pott’s Hill, a distance of about 9f miles, is
50,000,000 gallons daily.
Near this point a balance and service reservoir is to
be constructed hereafter, having a capacity of 100,000,000
gallons ; the reservoir will be constructed so as to admit
of the water rising freely, if necessary, to the same height
as the water at the commencement of canal, viz., 175 - 50.
A branch pipe, 15-inches diameter, leads off the 6-feet
pipe, at the Dog Trap Road, to supply Granville, Auburn
and South Parramatta,
From Pott’s Hill screen tank, two 30-inch pipes will
start, and supply the Northern, Western and Southern
suburbs—one is to be taken across the Parramatta River
to Ryde, where there will be a pumping station to pump
the water to an elevated tank on the Lane Cove Road, at
Chatsvvood, to supply the whole of the North Shore.
From a reservoir on Ryde Hill, the districts of Hunter’s
Hill, Gladesville, &c., will be supplied.
A 48-inch pipe carries the water from the screen tank
as far as the branch to Petersham, a distance of 7f miles,
from which point to Crown-street, a distance of 3| miles,
the pipes are 42-inoh.
The Petersham reservoir holds 2,000,000 gallons, and is
supplied by a 48-inch branch from the main, 1200 yards
long. The time required to fill this reservoir is 2f hours.
The Crown-street reservoir, into which the 42-inch
pipes discharge, Is the one at present used for supplying
Sydney. The top water level is 14P00 over high water,
Sydney, and the bottom 125'U0. The capacity of the
reservoir is about 3,250,000 gallons ;it is, however, con-
templated to enlarge it to about 4,500,000 gallons
immediately.
The pumps by which the upper levels are supplied are
at Crown-street.
The pipes will discharge a volume of water equal to
17,775,000 gallons daily.
The following is a statement of the lengths of each
description of conduit: —
Total length .. 63f miles.
About nine-tenths of the district of Sydney and
suburbs may be supplied by gravitation.
Besides the water supply for the city of Sydney and
suburbs, a number of country towns’ water supplies have
been carried out, and others are in progress, these works
being executed under the Country Towns Water and
Sewerage Act 44 Viet., No. 14.
The works executed arc as follows :
Hunter River District Water Supply
Albury Water Supply
Bathurst Water Supply
Goulburn Water Supply
Wagga Wagga Water Supply
Deniliquin Water Supply;
and the following are in progress—
Bourkc Water Supply
Wentworth Water Supply
Lismore Water Supply
Balranald Water Supply.
The works have been authorised, and plans and spei
fleations are now being prepared to supply the towns
Orange and Wollongong.
With the exception of the two latter, which are gra l
tation schemes, all the supplies are obtained by pumpii
from rivers.
The first five schemes are furnished with compoui
beam engines, working over deep wells connected wii
the river.
Deniliquin is furnished with a horizontal rotative
geared engine, working a vertical pump; and Bourke,
Wentworth, Lismore, and Balranald, are each furnished
with two pairs of Worthington duplex engines. In each
case, the Worthington engines are fixed about 15 feet
above summer level of the river, in a circular brick
chamber, 15 feet diameter, the walls of which are carried
up to above flood level. The pump chamber is enclosed
within a building, which also contains the boiler and
fuel space.
The following is a brief description of each scheme
Hunter River District Water Supply.
Pumping scheme.
Nearly the whole of the towns and municipalities in
the Lower Hunter River District are supplied with water
pumped from the Hunter River, at a point about 1J
miles above the town of West Maitland.
The towns and municipalities supplied are—West
Maitland, East Maitland, Morpeth, Minmi, Plattsburg,
Wallsend, Brookstown, Jesmond, Lambton, New Lamb-
ton, Waratah, Hanbury, Hamilton, Adamstown, Tighe’s
Hill, Islington, Wickham, Burwood, Merewether, Car-
rington (late Bullock Island), and Newcastle.
The engine-house is situated about 45 chains from tin
river, and contains three compound beam engines am
five boilers, made by Messrs. James Watt and Co., o
Birmingham, each engine being 80 horse-power (nominal)
The water is pumped from the river into a storage
reservoir, with a storage capacity of 172,400,000 gallons,
formed by the construction of an earthen dam across the
Walka lagoon.
From the storage reservoir the water is pumped into
settling tank, close to the engine-house, holding 1,390,6 C
gallons, at a height of 75 feet above the sea; thence
gravitates through four sand filters into a clear wate
tank, which holds 589,500 gallons, at a height of 50 fe<
above the sea level.


From the clear water tank, the water is pumped to a
reservoir situated on Butti Hill, 5 miles 48£ chains from
the engine-house, holding I.ooo,OOOgallous of water, at a
height of 307 feet above sea level. A reservoir, at East
Maitland, 4 miles 14 chains from the engine-house, con-
taining 472,000 gallons, at a height of 151 J feet above sea
level, is also supplied direct from the pumps.
From Butti Hill, the water is supplied to the following
service reservoirs by gravitation, viz.Minmi reservoir,
9 miles li chains from Butti, holding 69,800 gallons at a
height of 193 ifeet above the sea; Wallsend reservoir,
9 miles 41 chains from Butti, holding 451,000 gallons, at. a
height of 111 feet above the sea; Lambton reservoir,
12 miles 36 chains from Butti, holding 404.000 gallons, at
at a height of 169 feet over the sea; Hamilton reservoir,
16 miles 45 chains from Butti, holding 404,000 gallons at
the same height as Lambton reservoir; Newcastle
reservoir, 17 miles 34 - 6 chains from Butti, holding
523,600 gallons, at a height of 187 feet over sea level;
Obelisk Hill reservoir, Newcastle, holding 157,120 gallons,
at a height of 233 feet over sea level; and an elevated
iron reservoir on Shepherd's Hill, holdingi2o,ooo gallons,
at a height of 311 feet above the sea.
The last mentioned reservoir is supplied by a hydraulic
pump, operated by water pressure from the main
Butti reservoir. A portion of the water is forced up to
the high level tank, and the waste water from the engine
is delivered into the Newcastle reservoir.

Roads—Bridges—Tanks and Wells
The total expenditure of the Department for all purposes
of construction and maintenance for 80 years has been
£11,6X2,900, of which £1,145,000 has been raised by loan
for sewerage and large bridges, thus leaving the outlay
from revenue for construction and maintenance of roads
and bridges during the 30 years, £10,500,000.
New South Wales has been the last of the colonies to
establish local government through its length and
breadth.
It has hitherto been confined to the towns, where it
has been gradually introduced with considerable success,
and is now general in all places of sufficient size.
Roads.
The roads of the colony at large were aU in charge of
the Government, up to the period of the opening of the
goldfields. They were managed by the Surveyor-General,
Sir Thomas Mitchell, and large and massive works of
engineering interest were carried out, the chief of which
were the Bathurst Road, from Penrith, and the stone
bridges at Parramatta and Landsdown, near Liverpool,
with some dams for water supply. The stone arch, near
Liverpool, is a work of great magnitude, nearly as
large, and of the same character as the Prince’s Bridge,
at Melbourne, Sir Thomas Mitchell’s assistant, Mr.
Lennox, having built both. The bridge at Melbourne is
now being replaced by an iron bridge.
The duties of the Road Branch proper comprise
designing, construction and maintenance of roads,
bridges, punts and ferries. The Survey Department
reserved certain roads through farms and as boundaries
during the settlement of the country, and, in many
places, located the roads through Crown land, it has,
however, often been necessary for engineering reasons to
deviate from those lines in construction, and the
selection and locating of the routes in the most advan-
tageous positions has formed no inconsiderable portion
of the work of the Department.
The mountain passes between the Richmond and
Tw ed, and the three over the coast ranges, connecting
Tenterfleld, Glen Innes, Armidale with Grafton, the
passes connecting Armidale with the Bellinger, as also
with the Macleay, the several passes into the Illawarra
country, and the Moss Yale and Nowra, the Braidwood
and Clyde and Moruya roads, and the Manaro and coast
passes being the chief, nearly all of which had to be
explored and located by the Departmental officers. In
the earlier days, and indeed up to the present, the
operations of the Department have been hampered and
restricted by the comparatively limited sums for the
works to be done, and by the necessity of providing for
emergencies consequent on the discovery of fresh gold
or other mineral fields, also by the series of flood years,
and by the gradual fencing of the country, and necessity
for following up settlement, or indeed anticipating it,
in the thickly timbered districts. The opening of the
railway extensions have from time to time entailed the
necessity of providing for changing the direction of the
traffic from lines parallel with the rail, in routes con-
verging on the stations.
During the excitement of the goldfields, the roads
were under provisional management, and owing to the
immense traffic, and the difficulty in procuring labor,
got into very bad order. During this period, many
timber bridges were constructed by the colonial archi-
tect, Mr. Weaver, all of which have been replaced with
more permanent structures —having lasted from 20 to 80
years.
In 1857, a systematic management of the roads was
initiated, and the present Road Department formed,
under Captain Martindale, R.E.; and, with the exception
of Sir T. Mitchell’s noble works, all the roads and bridges
now existing throughout the colony, outside municipal
limits, have been constructed by the Roads Departments
which, previous to the introduction of municipal govern-
ment, also constructed the main leading thoroughfares
through the towns, as at Albury, Goulbum, Bathurst,
Orange, and the Maitlands. In 1864, the operations of
the Department, up to that time confined to the main
roads, were extended over all the roads in the colony;
since 1869, the Department has dealt with the con-
struction of tanks, dams, and wells, on the leading
thoroughfares through the dry country.
In many cases punts have have had to be provided to
cross rivers and arms of the sea. There are seven steam
punts, and 85 punts worked by hand-gearing and steel wire
ropes, and other means; 57 boat ferries —many of these
are leased, but the revenue only suffices for working.
In the year 1878, the Department was charged with the
carrying out of the sewerage and drainage works of
Sydney and contiguous suburbs, and with the prepara-
tion of designs for drainage of the eastern suburbs, and
of the towns of Albury, Goulburn, Newcastle, St.
Leonards, and Manly, for most of which designs are
completed and ready to execute.
The colony is divided into 54 road districts, and in
remote and certain other districts, for the expenditure of
desultory grants, there arc 400 trusts working under the
Department.


The total length of roads in charge of the Department
is 26.300 miles, of which 22,368 are managed by road
engineers and superintendents. There are in existence,
the work of the Department, approximately, about
1,400 miles of mountain passes ; 6,000 miles of metalled
and gravelled roads ; 4,000 miles of drained and culverted
roads; 4,000 miles of cleared road; and 7,000 miles of
naturally fair road in fine weather, on which works have
not been constructed.
There are nearly 10,000 bridges and culverts, measuring
over 60 miles in length, of iron, stone, and timber, some
of them of considerable size, as the iron bridges over the
Parramatta River, Ironbark Creek, at Nowra, Manilla,
Bingera, Gnnnedah, Boggabri, Gnndagai, Hay, Bal-
rauald, and Bourke. In addition, 50 miles of earthenware
pipes, from 12 to 24 inches in diameter, have been laid
down as culverts, &c.
Many novel designs have been introduced to meet the
circumstances of sites and traffic.
In some cases, the bridges are submerged over 30 feet,
the handrails being lowered and secured to deck, in
floods, as at Windsor and Richmond.
In other instances, at Balranald, over the Murrum-
bidgee, and Bourke, over the Darling, steel girders have
been used for lifting spans to provide for navigation.
A bridge of this type is now being constructed at
Brewarrinna.
Tanks and Wells.
The Department has now been for nearly twenty
years charged with the construction of tanks and wells,
for the supply of water on stock routes in the interior,
the larger artesian and other boring having been
entrusted to the Mines Department, as involving the
geological experience and information at the disposal of
that Department.
There are, nearly complete. 146 different works—llo
tanks,. 28 wells, and 8 dams. Most of the works have
been constructed under very great difficulties. Owing
to the dry seasons which prevailed, the contractors had
to contend with obstacles which much enhanced the cost
of the work; but, notwithstanding this, it was considered
advisable to push on with the work, and be in a position
to take advantage of the first rain, rather than indefi-
nitely postpone the whole question. The result has
proved a success, as all the stock routes on which those
works are constructed are now well provided with water.
Most of the tanks are furnished with lifting and dis-
tributing appliances to avoid the waste and other evils
connected with the admission of stock to water in the
tanks. The excavated earth is in nearly every case
deposited in a regular embankment round the tank, and
when possible these embankments are utilised for storing
water above the surface, so as to store two cube yards of
water for each cube yard of excavation; where this end
is not attained the banks are of value in sheltering the
water from the wind and thus decreasing evaporation.
The standard depth is 18 feet, the capacity 2,000,000
to 3,500,000 gallons, exclusive of conservation above
surface. The total storage capacity of tanks is over
600,000,000 gallons, and the wells will yield a total of
about 1,000,000 gallons per day, when constantly worked.
The lifting appliances are either steam or horse-gear
pumps—the former being preferred when fuel is obtain-
able. There are 51 steam pumps, 48 horse-gear, and one
hot-air pump. The water is lifted into service tanks,
now being made of iron buckle plates, on rolled joists,
placed on concrete piers, and with a capacity of 20,000
gallons each. From these tanks the water gravitates as
required into the troughing from which the stock drink.
This is usually 300 feet long and made of rolled steel of
suitable form on concrete or wooden supiwrts involving
no work to put in place.
The wells being 70 to 400 feet in depth the water is
raised in buckets by a horse whim, and stored in a service
tank, as described, for the tanks.
A windmill has in one instance been employed to pump
from the well.
Making allowance for the cost of maintenance for 30
years, the road works remaining, together with the tank
and well works, though not directly revenue-producing,
or, as yet, reproductive works, still form a most valuable
asset for the colony, and an asset always increasing in
value. The roads, by reason of their growing usefulness,
being more developed each day by the railway extension,
and by the increase of settlement, neither of which
could be carried on to advantage without them.
The lines of a most complete system of road com-
munic ition through the colony have been laid down. It
has always been the object of the Department to
definitely locate the road at difficult places, and to do
any works of construction, sucluas bridges or culverts,
in the first instance, so as to facilitate the operations of
the local governing bodies now about to be instituted,
which will, as far as road works go, chiefly consist of
maintaining the old and macadamizing new lengths.

General Remarks. —The Railways alone of New South Wales have been valued by competent authorities
an amount far larger than that expended on their construction. In addition to this realizable asset there is
sum of £12,000,000 due by the conditional purchasers of crown lands, producing an annual interest of £150,00
and about 156,000,000 acres of the public estate still unalienated, the .annual rents of which are £440,000, t
freehold value of which is almost incalculable. At the end of 1887, the amount unexpended at the credit
the Loan Account was £1,908,517. There is no Sinking Fund.
* Based on the prices given in the second column, allowance being made for redemption of the loans in due

Cfje <H2Ucml Crato of Eustralia anti
(By R. B. SKAMP, Esq.)
IN the history of Australia there is no more remarkable
feature than the rapid and enormous development of its
pastoral industries. Intrepid explorers were quickly fol-
lowed by enterprising settlers, and many millions of
acres in the interior, but recently a terra incognita, are
now well stocked with sheep and cattle. The country
which a few years ago witnessed the dying struggles of
the heroic explorers Burke and Wills, is now a thriving
settlement, forming a centre from which fresh conquests
of the wilderness are being constantly made. The absence
of rivers from many otherwise valuable districts is no
longer a bar to profitable occupation. Improved methods
for the conservation of water have been devised, and the
sinking of wells has been attended with the most gratify-
ing success, an abundance of wholesome water having
been found in most instances at comparatively small dis-
tances from the surface. Immense tracts of land are
thus brought into use, which a few years ago were
regarded as irreclaimable desert.
Although the introduction of sheep and cattle into
Australia dates from the ninth decade of the last
century, the industry may be said to have had but a
struggling existence until the year 1860. During that
year the total export of wool from the different
colonies forming the Australian group was only 160,997
bales, valued at £2,897,946. In 1887-8 it amounted to
1,020,005 bales, representing at the present low prices a
money value of £14,280,070 sterling, which sum would
be considerably augmented if the value of the meat,
hides, tallow, and other allied produce exported were
taken into account.
Although this result is without parallel in the history
E ancient or modem colonization, the rate of progress
ill probably be far outstripped in the next twenty years.
ready a great part of Queensland has been occupied or
ipped out into stations. Settlement has commenced in
Northern Territory; and projects for stocking large
of Western Australia are eagerly supported by capi-
alists; and the South-western district of South Australia,
i'here the brave Eyre encountered such incredible hard-
kip and suffering, is now traversed in safety by the
itable squatter in search of new country for his
ing flocks.
Fortunately for Australia a dry climate and compara-
ively scanty herbage are favourable to the growth of fine
and in the following short historic sketch of the
m sheep (without which no treatise on wool would
complete), it will be observed that those districts in
Old World, which may be regarded as the original
nue of the race, are subject to the same climatic laws as
a large portion of this continent.
Amongst the numerous divisions of the great ovine
the merino stands prominently forward as the only
iy whose history can be traced for many centuries,
e useful animals were introduced into Europe from
Minor by the ancient Greeks, and through them
itted to Italy, shortly after the foundation of
nne, where they were brought by careful management
a high state of perfection.
Ancient writers on Italian agriculture assert that
during the palmiest days of Imperial Rome the Italian
sheep were cultivated with the greatest assiduity, being
clothed by day and housed by night. Of such value was
the wool, that no labor was considered too great that
would improve its character or assist its growth. Every
three or four months the fleece was washed, then mois-
tened with oil or wine, and carefully combed, while the
cots or houses which sheltered the sheep at night, were
cleaned and fumigated every day. According to Pliny
the best wool of all others was that of Apulia, a province
in the south of Italy, bordering the Adriatic Sea, and
the next best that grown further south, about Tarentum
(now Taranto), while for whiteness there was none
better than that grown on the Po and in Lombardy.*
Introduced into Spain by its Roman conquerors, the
Greek sheep, as they were called, found there a climate
and soil peculiarly suited to their organisation, and the
fame of their matchless fleeces, so frequently referred to
by early authors, when they grazed on the eastern
slopes of the Appenines, does not appear to have been
affected by their change of habitat, for on the authority
of Strabo, the geographer, who wrote in the early part
of the reign of Tiberius (14-37 A.D.), it is stated that
the rich fabrics worn by the wealthy Romans were
manufactured in his time from the flocks which roamed
over the plains of Truditania, in Spain.f He also states,
when referring to the inhabitants of this important
province of Hispania, that “ They formerly imported
many garments, but now their wool was better than that
of the Coraxi, and so beautiful that a ram for the pur-
pose of breeding was sold for a talent (£216), and that
fabrics of extraordinary thinness were made of this wool
by the Saltratoe.”J
In tracing the history of the merino sheep the fact that
the southern portion of the Iberian peninsula was cele-
brated under the Carthaginians for the superiority of its
woollen manufactures, must not be overlooked; but
whether they introduced the sheep, from whose fleeces
those valuable fabrics were woven, from their African
dominions, or whether they were brought from Syria or
the Asiatic shores of the Black Sea by earlier colonists
from Greece or Phoenicia, is more or less a matter of
conjecture. It is, however, certain that large numbers
of sheep were imported from Italy by the Roman colo-
nists, and it is recorded that the elder Columella, who
possessed a farm in Beetica (Granada and Andalusia), in
the reign of Claudius (A.D. 42-54), 260 years after the
Carthaginians had been finally expelled,§ introduced
Tarentine sheep for the purpose of improving his flocks.
According to Pliny, Solinus, and other ancient writers,
the original Spanish sheep were of various colors, black,
red, and tawny, and the remains of these varieties of
colors are said to he discerned in the buff, fawn, or satin
colored faces, red ears, and spotted legs occasionally
noticed in the merino of the present day. There is,
therefore, no doubt that the Greek sheep of Italy, either
* Plin. Secund., lib. viii., ch. 48. f Livingston’s Essays
on Sheep, p. 39. J Encyclopaedia Londinensis, vol. xxiv.
§ 205 B.C.


with or without admixture with the fine-woolled sheep
of the Carthaginians, were the progenitors of the world-
famed Spanish merino.
It is unnecessary here to follow this interesting branch
of the woolly tribe during the eighteen centuries it
remained exclusively in Spain ; it is sufficient to say
that through all the vicissitudes of that country the race
maintained itself pure.
Although its descendants and offshoots are now to be
found in the four quarters of the world such is the vigor
of the blood, and so readily do they adapt themselves to
changes of climate, that with proper care and attention
they retain those excellencies that have made them
famous above all others for the superiority of their wool;
it is not too much to say that the intelligent sheep
breeders and flockmasters of Australia have by the
importation, improvement, and perpetuation of this par-
ticular species of the animal kingdom, added more to the
wealth of that division of the globe than have the
promoters of any other industry yet introduced.
When Captain Arthur Phillip founded the first Austra-
lian settlement in one of the picturesque bays of Port
Jackson, on the 26th January, 1788, not a single specimen
of the ovine tribe was among the imported stock. Before
the close of the year, however, some twenty-nine or
thirty sheep were brought from Bengal. These were of
the true East Indian race, having long legs, fat
rumps, large heads, pendant ears, Roman noses, arched
backs, and narrow shoulders. Their fleeces were thin
and poor, of a coarse hairy type, and of little commercial
value. Such, however, was the adaptability of the cli-
mate and pasture of the new settlement for the sheep
industry that during the first two or three years both
wool and carcase improved so considerably as to literally
surprise the colonists.
Small additions to this flock were made from time to
time, and prior to the year 1791 a few Leicesters, South-
downs, and low class Irish sheep, brought out in some of
the Government ships, were established at Port Jackson.
In addition to these a small number of sheep had been
imported from the Cape of Good Hope. They were said
to be of Spanish race, but it is not recorded whether
they were of the merino or of the long-woolled species.
During this year(l79l) Captain John Macarthur arrived
in the colony with his regiment, the 102nd foot. He
appears to have discerned at once the excellent pros-
pects the new settlement presented for stock breeding,
and being an enthusiastic agriculturist he soon formed
the nucleus of a flock. First, he purchased thirty ewes
which arrived from Calcutta in a merchant vessel, and to
these he added eight or ten of the mixed sheep then in
the colony. This was in 1793. These Indian sheep, like
their predecessors, were badly formed, undersized
animals, with fleeces bearing a closer resemblance to
hair than to wool; but by crossing them with sheep of
English blood a highly satisfactory result was obtained,
the fleece being improved to double its original value.
This success induced Captain Macarthur to attempt the
production of wool of a finer quality, he being fully con-
vinced that the soil and climate of New South Wales
made bad fleeces good and good better.” It was not,
however, until 1797 that the opportunity presented itself.
At that date Captain Waterhouse, [pi H.M.S. “ Reliance,”
brought from the Cape of Good Hope a small flock
pure Spanish merinos, which had been bred by Coloi
Gordon, from sheep sent originally from Hollani
Although many died on the passage, Captain Macartl
was fortunate enough to secure five ewes and thi
rams.f the balance of this valuable acquisition bei
distributed between the Rev. S. Marsden, Mr. C
Captain Kent and some others. This experiment pro's
eminently successful. The sheep improved in hea'
and vigor, and the wool after four seasons showed
signs of deterioration. It was considered by the coloni
to be equal in quality to the produce of the pi
merino flocks of Europe. So satisfied was Capti
Macarthur of the excellent quality of the wool that
1801 he made a voyage to England and exhibited to t
London brokers several samples of Australian wc
which they declared were equal to the finest import
merino.
Encouraged by this success, Captain Macarthur pi
sented to Lord Hobart, Secretary of State for the colonii
an address setting forth the special fitness of the dims
and herbage of New South Wales for the production
high-class wool to an unlimited extent. This led to
grant of 10,000 acres of land being conferred upon hii
During this visit he was able to acquire some sheep
the best Spanish blood at the first public sale by Kii
George 111. of his Hampton Court merinos, held
August, 1804. He purchased eight head—3 rams and
ewes.J They were sent out to improve the Camden sti
flock, which at that time consisted solely of the progei
of the merino sheep previously imported from the Cape
Good Hope.
The Hampton Court flock, which was established
the King for the purpose of improving the English sh
wool, is thus referred to by Bischoff in his valuable wc
on the History of the Woollen and Worsted Manufactui
He says:—“ln the year 1702, through the medium
Lord Auckland, who had been ambassador in Spain,
Majesty procured from the Marchioness del Cam
d’Alange, 40 of the best Spanish sheep (5 rams a
35 ewes) in exchange for eight fine English coach horse
The sheep selected were of the Negretti breed, t
largest and strongest, as well as the most valuable,

transhumantes or migratory flocks the Peninsula
d boast of. So highly esteemed were their fleeces for
less of quality and denseness of staple, that a law was
ited prohibiting their exportation, and direct applica-
had to be made to the Spanish King in this instance
the sheep were allowed to leave the country.
It will thus be seen that the Camden flock which has
ad so large an influence on the sheep of Australia was
f the purest Spanish strain; and its spirited founder,
y the naturalization of the merino in this country, has
nabled Australians to echo the old Castilian proverb—
The sheep foot is tipped with gold.”
At this time the number of sheep in the colony of New
outh Wales amounted to 10,167, the increase during the
vo preceding years having been very rapid, as will be
i by reference to the following statistics, published on
authority before quoted. The Table shows the pro-
ssive increase of sheep in New South Wales from the
ndation of the colony to the year 1803: —

From the year 1803 the live stock of the colony increased
ipidly, and settlement was pushed further westward
ichyear, until, in 1813, after a most distressing season
E drought, the coast range was penetrated, and the vast
ell-grassed plains of the interior were brought within
h of the settler. By this discovery an immense
nt of magnificent grazing country was opened for
enterprising squatter, and the pastoral interest
ived an impetus which, in spite of dry seasons and a
lost of minor difficulties, has placed Australia in the
irst rank of wool-producing countries.
The next stimulus to sheep farming in Australia was
le discovery that Tasmania with its salubrious climate
id regular pastures was equally if not more suitable
New South Wales for wool growing. At the
mt day its flocks are famed for great density of
e, combined with superior quality and style; the
It of the most assiduous care and attention extending
rar a long period.
Although Tasmania was first settled in 1804 sheep
rare not introduced into that colony until the year 1807,
■hen some small draughts were brought from Bengal
nd Norfolk Island. They were worthless animals as
egards wool, and being of small frames were not in
ivour as mutton producers, which doubtless induced
olonel Paterson some years later to import a few Tees-
rater sheep from New South Wales. This breed, which
i now extinct, is described as being tall and clumsy, but
ielding a heavier carcase than any other; while the
'ool is said to have been long, coarse, and thinly set upon
skin. * These were subsequently crossed with the
cester, but no great improvement was made until
9, when Colonel William Sorell, Governor of the
>lony, introduced 181 pure merino lambs from the Gam-
in flock. The total number of sheep in Tasmania at
this date, as will be observed from the subjoined table
ivas between 170,000 and 180,000, all of which were
-woolled animals, of mixed breed.

In 1827 the Van Diemen’s Land Company, which had
then been established two years, introduced 264 Saxon
merinos. They were brought out in the ship “ Caroline,”
and comprised 103 rams and 161 ewes. Although this
was not the first direct importation of fine-woolled sheep
from Europe, it was one of the most important, as to
it many of the most celebrated Tasmanian stud flocks
owe their origin. Other shipments soon followed, and
by June, 1830, their stock of sheep, numbering 9,334,
had cost them £30,717, the greater part of which had
been imported from Europe at heavy expensed In
addition to the operations of this company, several
draughts of German merinos were brought out by the
settlers from time to time. They were from the best
flocks of the Principality, and all closely related to
the Elector’s flock, which at that time was the most
celebrated in Europe. According to Bischoif, who
quotes from the French of C. P. Lasteyrie, the Saxon
branch of the great merino family was founded in this
wise. The Elector of Saxony wishing to repair the
devastations occasioned in his dominions by the Seven
Years’ War, obtained from the King of Spain in 1765 a
hundred merino rams and two hundred ewes, selected
from the best flocks of the Peninsula. They were of the
Escurial variety, which originally differed somewhat
from the Infantado or Negretti in both frame and wool,
being described by Spooner, in his History of Sheep, as
having long legs, a long spare neck and head, and a fine
short fleece ; while the Negretti had shorter legs, a com-
paratively broad head, and a short round body, well
woolled all over. The distinctive character of the Escurial
variety became even more marked after they were im-
ported into Saxony, for it is recorded that after a con-
siderable lapse of years the wool produced by the Elec-
tor’s flock which had been kept pure, had improved in
quality and style; having become finer, softer, and
more elastic than that of sheep which grazed on the
sunny plains of their native Spain.
It must be understood that tlie great aim of the early
Australian colonists was to grow wool capable of com-
petition with the fine-haired German sorts in the home
market, and it was to further this object that the Saxon
merino was introduced into New South Wales. The
Australian Agricultural Company in 1825, Hr. Eiley, of
Baby, in 1828, and other sheep breeders about that time
imported large numbers of pure Saxon, French, arid
English merinos. The Australian Agricultural Associa-
tion introduced, during the early part of its career, several
thousand high class sheep from the chief flocks of
Europe. The British merinos imported were chiefly
from the flock of Mr. Thomas Henty, of West Tarring,
Sussex, which at that time bore a very high reputation.
They were bred up from the flocks of King George 111.,
Sir —. Barclay, of Bury Hill, and others of equal renown,
t County of Buckingham only.

and by unwearied assiduity bad been brought to so high
a state of perfection that between the years 1817 and
1830 they were never beaten, either at the county shows

don, the first and second prizes always falling to their
share. About the year 1823 the first specimens of this
celebrated flock were introduced into New South Wales
by Mr. John Street, who had been induced by Mr. Henty
to emigrate to the colony, and who brought with him,
as a present from that gentleman, nine ewes and one
ram. Some lambs were dropped on the voyage, and Mr.
Street was able to dispose of the male portion of the
progeny soon after his arrival at very high figures, one
ram selling for one hundred guineas, while the original
ram was leased for the season for a similar sum. This
favourable reception induced Mr. Henty to make some
direct shipments of rams to Sydney on his own account,
and two lots of from eighty to one hundred each were
sent out by the “ Orelia ” (Captain Hudson) and “ Lusi-
tania.” As a further illustration of the high character
of the West Tarring merinos, it may be mentioned that
shortly after the arrival of the abovenamed shipments,
Mr. Macarthur, Mr. Lawson, and two other noted breeders
went home to purchase stud rams, and that after search-
ing through the continent and England they finally
selected from Mr. Henty’s flock.*
The sheep imported by Mr. Eiley were from the cele-
brated Gadegast stud, at Thai. Oschatz, Saxony, and
were descendants of the Elector's flock, whose history has
been already given. Their fleeces were unequalled for
style and character, and there is no doubt that many of
the Mudgee breeders owe to this and subsequent impor-
tations from the same source, the fineness of hair, softness
of handle, and elasticity of staple for which their flocks
are at present noted.
The returns of stock given in the Australian Agricul-
tural Company’s sixth annual report show that up to
the end of April, 1829, the number of imported merino
Mr. Eyrie Graham, in his valuable treatise on the merino
sheep, says that about the year 1839 the Australian
merino had attained its highest point of excellence. He
remarks “ Time, climate, and intelligent management
had eradicated the legion of bad qualities which charac-
terised the original stock, and the whole of the sheep in
the colony (N.S.W.) were types of one class, differing
only from the operation of local influences, and the degree
of intelligent care bestowed upon them by owners.
Although nearly every squatter had been breeding
for numbers and not for quality, there were no
mongrels, for such was the surprising durability and
vigor of the blood that neither cupidity, neglect, nor
total ignorance could destroy the character of the wool.”
* In the year 1796 Thomas Henty, Esq., purchased the
demesne lauds in the parish of West Tarring, consisting
of 281 acres. This farm is now in a high state of preser-
vation. The breed of merino sheep has been brought to
a high state of perfection by Mr. Henty, and many from
his flock have been sent to New South Wales, purchased
by Mr. Macarthur.— Henfield’s History of Sussex, vol. 2,
page 188.
Although this may appear a high enconium to pass
the virtue or tenacity of hereditary transmission of 1
merino blood in New South Wales, equal praise coi
be bestowed on the sheep in Tasmania at this tii
which, owing to the numerous importations of Germ
and English merinos, had improved to a like exte:
some of the established stud flocks having thus ea:
reached a very high degree of perfection.

It will be noticed on reference to the above figures thi
the flocks of New South Wales and Tasmania had i
creased to goodly numbers by the time “ Port Phillip” (i
Victoria) was settled, consequently the early colonis
of Victoria had no difficulty in obtaining live stock.
The first permanent settlement In the Port Phill
District was made by a Mr. Edward Henty,f at Poi
land Bay, on the 19th November, 1834, and the fir
sheep were brought from Tasmania by Mr. Francis Henl
in one of their own vessels, “ The Thistle,” on the 191
December of the same year. They consisted of a draugl
of the original English flock, some of which had bet
previously brought out to Western Australia in the sh
“Caroline,” by the brothers James, Stephen George, ai
John Henty in the year 1829, and taken from thence 1
Tasmania in February, 1831, where in April of the san
year they again met the greater portion of the parei
flock which had been brought out by their founder, M
Thomas Henty, in the ship “ Firth of Alloway.”

th Wales contributed a fair proportion, and it is to
amalgamation of the two great branches of the
ino family, as represented by the Camden and Tas-
an sheep, that many of the Victorian flocks owe
high character and world-wide fame.

Two years after the settlement of Victoria an addi-
onal impulse wa« imparted to Australian sheep hus-
andry by the colonisation of South Australia. On the
Bth December, 1836, the first English settlers landed at
told fast Bay. They came out under the auspices of the
uth Australian Agricultural Company, to which asse-
rtion is due the honor of introducing the first sheep
to the colony. In the first report of this company,
rted May 20, 1836, their first purchase of sheep is
ius referred to “ They have commenced their stock by
basing a very superior lot of fine merino rams and
, selected in Saxony for a sheepholder in Van
len’s Land, but afterwards handed over to them at
more than prime cost. They have also sent out

The merino flock arrived by the ship “ Lady
lane Pelham,” Captain Ross, which left Liverpool on
March 30th, and were under the special care of the over-
seer of the stock. In the following year, the “ Solway”
wrought out a second detachment of pure stock for the
Company, consisting of 24 Saxony rams and ewes, and
ibont the same time Mr. William Malcolm imported 30
from Mr. Macarthur’s Camden flock. A little later
some merinos were imported from Tasmania, by Mr.
illett, and at the same time the South Australian Com-
ny obtained further supplies from the same colony for
estates at the head waters of the Torrens and
iparinga Rivers.
Messrs. T. H.Beare, W. Giles, and H. Mildred were
Iso amongst the earliest importers of stock. According
3 a paper read by Mr. J. H. Angas, of Collingrove,
efore the Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society
f South Australia, on February 29, 1884, the sheep in-
roduced by the above flookmasters were all ewes, and
'ere said to be selected from Mr. Thomas Henty’s flock,
d bred by him. They were brought from Van
emen’s Land, in the “ Cygnet,” and landed at Kangaroo
and shortly after the arrival of the Company’s ships.
Many other early settlers, such as Messrs. Angas,
VParland, Hawker, and Leake, procured sheep from
asmania and New South Wales. The stock from the
rtter colony were driven overland, as many as 35,000
sheep reaching the new settlement, in 1839, by this route.
Large numbers were also brought by vessel from Tas-
mania, consequently the rate of increase was very rapid,
as will be observed by a glance at the following table :
1838. 1839. 1840.
28,000 108,700 200,160
The largest importers of pure bred sheep, however,
from both Tasmania and Europe, were the South Aus-
tralian Company, who, from the commencement, devoted
their best efforts to improve their flocks. The sheep
selected at first were mainly Saxon merinos, on account
of the extreme fineness and high quality of their wool;
but in June, 1844, fifteen choice Mecklenburgh rams were
sent out to them, in a vessel from Bremen, which had
been selected, says Southey, in his “ Rise, Progress and
Present State of Colonial Wool,” “ Not so much on ac-
count of the fineness of their wool, as their weight of
fleece, coupled with length of staple.” Many private
colonists also exerted themselves to improve the character
of their flocks, and all the branches of the merino tribe
were tested in turn. Messrs. Hallett Brothers imported
rams from Lord Western’s pure English flock,* and later
on Messrs. J. H. Angas and A. B. Murray introduced some
members of the American family, while other enterprising
flookmasters saw in the French merino the characteristics
they required. These more recent importations are
merely mentioned in passing as they are fully treated in
another part of this article. Taken as a whole, the
South Australian sheep of the present time compare
very favourably with the stock of the neighbouring
colonies, but many of the best flocks are those which trace
their origin from the early importations of Camden and
Tasmanian blood.
Although the colony of Western Australia has not so
far contributed very largely to the wool export of this
continent, it will ultimately become a good sheep
country, as it comprises a large area of pastoral terri-
tory that only requires stocking to become productive.
The first permanent settlement was made by Major
Lockyer and party in the year 1826, and when Captains
Fremantle and Stirling, of H.M. ships “ Challenger” and
“ Parnelia,” founded the Swan River settlement in 1829,
two hundred sheep were landed. During this and the
following year a number of settlers arrived from England,
bringing with them, amongst other stock, a large
number of sheep. Several importations from Tasmania
were likewise received about this time, but like the bulk
of the English sheep, they were large framed animals,
growing a coarse, long fleece, and entirely unsuited for
the climate, consequently both wool and carcase de-
generated in quality each year. Ultimately they were
crossed with merino rams, but as some years had elapsed
before this attempt to improve the quality of the wool
was made, it was a considerable time before the West
Australian clip bore anything like a uniform type, a large
proportion being fuzzy, hairy wools, showing no breed or
character. However, the introduction of the merino
blood, as usual, worked wonders, and in spite of many
natural disadvantages the quality of the clip has since
steadily improved, and some of the leading marks now
realise prices not far behind average Riverine brands.

In the year 1842 the number of sheep in the colony was
60,380,f and the export of wool 237,900 lbs. Owing to its
Under the influence of a succession of good seas
combined with fair prices ruling for wool in the hi
market, the stock of sheep in Australia increased i
One of the most important events that occurred during
this decade, and which may be said to have opened a new
era in Australian sheep husbandry, was the introduction
of long-wool sheep. They were imported into New South
Wales by Messrs. Icely and Eodd, of Bathurst, in 1840,
and were of the Leicester breed. Before this date the
whole of the sheep in the Australian colonies, amounting
to over 6,000,000, were, with the exception of the small
number in the Swan River settlement, of one breed, pro-
ducing a uniform class of wool, which had grown into
great favour in the home market, where fine Botany and
Van Diemen’s fleeces, at this date, realised from Is. Bd. to
2s. Id. per lb., washed, and from 9d. to 12d. per lb. in the
grease, according to condition. Squatting had therefore
become a lucrative pursuit, and many professional men
and others, whose knowledge of sheep and wool was ex-
tremely limited, were now largely engaged in sheep
farming.*
About this time, 1840, the idea of increasing the weight
of fleece by crossing with the English long-woolled sheep,
became prevalent, and although it had been clearly
demonstrated by actual results that the weight of both
fleece and carcase could be increased by selecting the
largest and best-woolled specimens in the flock to breed
from, many growers preferred to follow the injudicious
system of crossing their merino ewes with Leicester rams
in the hope that they were going to retain the chief
characteristics of both breeds. As was to be expected,
the result was a failure, the crossbred progeny having
neither the fine dense fleece of the merino, nor the large
symmetrical frame and other inherent qualities of the
English sheep. In fact, to use a common expression in
the trade, the wool was neither “one thing nor the other,’’
and.it is to be regretted that this mongrel class of wool
has gone on increasing until it now forms no mean
portion of our export. In this instance proper care does
not appear to have been taken in selecting the soil and
feed most congenial to the habits of the long-woolled
sheep, which, unlike the merino, does not readily adapt
itself to changes of climate and pasture. As the true
home of the fine-woolled breeds has always been on the
mountain slopes and the elevated table-lands in the
interior of continents, so the marshes and fens near the
coast, and the rich meadow-lands on the banks of rivers,
furnish the best pastures for the coarse-woolled kinds.
With the one, a dry climate and scanty herbage assists in
maintaining the fine character of its wool, while with the
other, an even climate and rich succulent pastures are
necessary to produce the large carcase and strong, d(
grown, lustrous fleece for which it is celebrated.
Long wools were introduced into Victoria as early i
1841. They would probably reach South Austral
shortly after. They were, however, never held in mu<
favour in that colony, where the quantity of cross-br<
wool is not great, although in the colder portions i
Victoria, where sheep of a hardy constitution ai
required, they have been largely adopted. Up to tl
year 1874 the quantity of coarse wool exported was ni
large, but from that date the production showed signs i
increasing. Long wool sheep of various crosses the
began to be substituted for the merino on freehold estate
conveniently situated to large markets, where, when fee
was abundant, they thrived well. Not only do they gii
a heavier carcase, but they also yield a larger fleece tha
the merino, which is the reason of their coming into favoi
with farmers, who own small areas of good land, suitab
for English grasses. To be made profitable as wool an
mutton producers they should be kept only in localitii
suitable for the long-wool breed of sheep, but this is n(
always done, hence the large proportion of low grat
cross-bred wool which passes through the Melbourne an
Sydney warehouses. This dry, harsh, mongrel kind <
wool is solely the affect of injudicious crossing or negle<
in selecting proper pastures, as the long-wools, like tl
merino, thrive best when surrounded by the conditioi
to which the breed was originally accustomed.
Of late years some large flockmasters in the weste:
district of Victoria, and in parts of the Murrumbidg
district, possessing a suitable climate, have produced, 1
the first cross of the merino and Lincoln, a type of wo
eminently adapted for the manufacture of soft gooi
having a fine texture. Others, by again crossing back c
the merino, produce a still finer wool of superior qualit
but owing to the difficulty of maintaining evenness
type, and also to a change in the fashion, the quantii
of this class of wool is decreasing. For the farmer, tl
long wool breed is the most profitable, provided bol
soil and climate are congenial to their habits; but tl
pure merino will always remain the most suitable shee
for Australia, as a whole, and they are not likely to 1
replaced by any other variety.

ceived with great favour, and commands
the pastoral interest had made steady and rapid
s. Then came a period of more than ordinary
ression. Wool fell from 12d. to tfd. per lb. in the home
rket, and the demand for store stock becoming very
ed, consequent on a succession of dry seasons,
;ters had to resort more largely than ever to the
boiling down vat, which now afforded the only outlet for
their surplus stock. Then came the discovery of gold,
and the social revolution which followed. All other
filled, the process of converting sheep into tallow,
although delayed for a period, still went on. Conse-
quently when in 1867 good average greasy wool rose to
15d. per lb., the total Australian export was 8,000,000 lbs.
less than the quantity shipped in 1850.
As will be observed by the following figures this retro-
gressive movement continued up to the close of the de-
cade under review, when the total number of sheep in the
Australian colonies and Tasmania was only about
2,000,000 in excess of the number returned thirteen years
before :
the general character of the surviving stock by weeding
out inferior and weaker specimens, and thereby making
room for a larger and more profitable race of sheep.
Although fine flocks had been kept for the production of
wool alone, and it had been plainly shown in the early
days of squatting that the weight per fleece could be
i by selection without prejudice to quality, no
movement had been made up to this time to
iprore the size of the Australian merino, which then
elded a small fine fleece, averaging about three pounds
greasy, or barely two pounds washed.
At this period the Rambouillet or French merino was
kracting considerable attention in Europe and America,
id it became apparent to some of our large run-holders
it the introduction of a more vigorous race of sheep
in the German variety was necessary to raise the
dard of their flocks. As the Rambouillet type pro-
id to fulfil the requirements sought for, namely,
er carcase, heavier fleece, and longer wool, the neces-
means were taken to procure a selection from the
ich Imperial flock. The first lot to arrive in Victoria
b to the order of Messrs. Degraves & Co., in 1859, who
used them for some years on their Coliban Park station
with great success, and their progeny out of Negrettiewes
are said to have exhibited in the highest degree all the
essentials of first-class merino sheep, being of large frame
and growing a heavy' fleece of remarkable fineness and
length of staple. The next consignment, consisting of
forty-three rams, arrived in the ship “Calliance” in
November, 1860, and was imported by Mr. Hugh Glass,
through the agency of Messrs. R. Goldsbrough & Co.
With the exception of three, which went to Mr. Donald
Ferguson, of Broadf ord, this shipment was divided between
the Nattie Yallock, Mount Sturgeon, and Wharparella
stations, in Victoria, then the property of the importer,
where for a time they were used in the stud flocks with
fair success. The consignment which followed was a
joint one, in which Messrs. R. Goldsbrough & Co., and
the late Mr. Hugh Glass were interested. Fifty rams of
this shipment were offered for sale at Goldsbrough’s wool
warehouses on the 19th September, 1861. They were re-
ceived with great favour, and commanded keen competi-
tion, being all disposed of at an average price of £Bl per
head. Amongst the buyers were Messrs. Carter & Sons,
of the Wimmera, Mr. L. Mcßean, Messrs. Clark & McLeay,
Messrs. Peppin & Son, and other large Riverine flock-
masters.
These sheep possessed in a marked degree the distinc-
tive qualities for which the Rambouillet type is noted,
namely, excessive size, heavy neck folds, and dewlap
almost down to the knee, loose skin, and a large, even
fleece of great length and of a good bold, useful character.
Although only two and four-tooth sheep, so large were
they that many breeders doubted the pureness of the
blood. This erroneous impression, however, did not pre-
vent their being largely used in New South Wales and
Victoria, and many of the Riverine flocks which are
noted for size and weight of fleece, notably the Wanga-
nella and Bonooke, are indebted for these characteristics
to an infusion of French blood.
Like the Saxon and English varieties, the French
merinos are descended from the original Spanish race,
and their introduction into France is thus referred to by
Bisohoff. He says : “M. Dangevillier, the Governor of
Rambouillet, amongst others requested of the Spanish
Government to be supplied with a merino flock. The
King gave orders that a selection should be made from
the flocks of highest repute in Spain, and in 1786 three
hundred and sixty-seven* rams and ewes were sent, under
* According to Baron Daurier, Director of the Im-
perial flock, in 1861, the correct number was 383, com-
prising selections from the following flocks or cavanas,
viz. Perales, 58 ; Perella, 50 ; Paular, 48 ; Negretti,
42; Escurial, 41; Alcola, 37; Saint Juan, 37; Qranda,
20; Salazar, 17; Portago, 33. They were obtained
through the medium of M de la Vanguyon, ambassador
at the Court of Madrid at that time. A second impor-
tation was made in ninth year of the French Republic,
by order of Bonaparte, First Consul.


the direction of a mayoral and three other Spanish shep-
herds. When the original merino flock arrived at Ram-
houillet, it was composed of sheep possessed of uncommon
heauty.”
Although one of the most important this was not the
first importation of Spanish merinos into France. Youatt
states that early in the eighteenth century (which we
must read for the latter part of the seventeenth century),
Colbertf, the celebrated Minister of Louis XIV,, enter-
tained the project of improving the French flocks by
crossing them with the merino, and at his own expense
several sheep of this breed were brought across the
Pyrenees. Thirty years after, M. de Perce imported a
small flock; and, in 1776, Louis XVI. obtained from the
King of Spain a selection of 200 remarkably fine sheep,
for the purpose of assisting M. Daubenton in his experi-
ments, the object being to ascertain the best way of
improving the native sheep. Several small lots had also
been imported prior to 1786, for the purpose of improving
the old Rousillon breed —a short fine-woolled race closely
allied to the merino. The Rambouillet flock, however,
is the only one that became thoroughly established in
France. Since its foundation it has been the property of
the State, and the sheep have never been crossed with
foreign or native races.
The treatment adopted and persisted in by those to
whose care this now celebrated stud flock was entrusted,
had the effect of developing both carcase and
fleece until their present magnificent proportions were
reached. Lasteyrie gives the average weight per fleece
of the Imperial cavana, during a succession of years, as
follows In 1796, 61bs. 90z.; 1797, 81bs.; 1798, 71bs.;
1799,81b5.; 1800, 81bs. Mr. Trimmer, an English authority,
gives the weight per fleece in 1827 as 141bs. for rams, and
10 lbs. for ewes; and Mr. Randall states that, in 1864,
choice flocks of this breed in France then averaged 201bs.
for rams, and 14 lbs. for ewes—the former weighing
200 lbs. and the latter 150 lbs.
The favour with which these sheep were received here
did not, however, last long, as it became evident in course
of time that they were not adapted for the majority of the
pastoral districts of Australia. Their peculiar qualities
were the result of special selection, careful management,
and an abundance of rich feed, and it was necessary that
they should be surrounded by physical conditions
similar to those which had developed their characteris-
tics ; but as this was impossible on many of the stations
where they were introduced their progeny deteriorated,
the carcase losing in size and the wool in quality and
length of staple. Nevertheless, where the conditions
were at all suitable to their habits, they did well, and
exercised a beneficial influence on many flocks.
Importations into Victoria of pure merino stock from
other quarters were frequent during the next few
years. Numerous draughts of Negrettis from Baron
Homeyer’s and H. A. Steiger's}: flocks arrived in Mel-

In addition to the Germans, Mr. F. B. Clapp import*
some noble specimens of the American merino, the fin
shipment arriving in Melbourne in 1863. They were bre
by the late Mr. George Campbell, of Vermont, froi
his famous “ Old Grimes” stock, and were note
for the abundance and good quality of their woe
Mr. Clapp had several other importations during tl
ensuing four years, all of which were sold by iMessr
Clough and Co.
The Vermont merino is descended from the old Spanis
stock, their ancestors having been introduced ini
America in 1802 by Colonel Humphries, who was at tin
time United States representative at the Spanish court
By judicious selection and careful treatment they hai
gradually increased in size and weight of fleece i
such an extent that they now vie with the Frenc
family in these fundamental characteristics. In additic
to a naturally hardy constitution they are vigorous ar
productive, and extremely well woolled all over, tl
head, belly, and points being especially well covere
They are described by Dr. Randall, the highest authorit
on American sheep, as “ having a short, tliick body, goc
fore and hind quarters, and short, thick heads. A
have dewlaps and neck folds. The fleece, which is lon
and even all over the body, opens freely, and is of goc
lustre and style.”
One objection found to the American merino by Au
tralian breeders is that of undue production of yolk, tl
wool being as a rule very greasy when compared wii
Australian fleeces. This excessive exudation of oleag
nous matter is doubtless due to the course of treatmei
adopted by the owners of certain flocks for the purpo
of increasing the weight of the fleece ; but as the practii
of housing and grain feeding is not general, many of tl
best flocks of Vermont are said at the present time m
to produce more yolk than is necessary to insure 8
abundant growth of wool.
§ The early importations of merinos into
were, according to Dr. Randall, as follows: —In 17£
William Foster, of Boston, Massachusetts, importi
three merino sheep from Spain. In 1801, M. Dupont <
Nemours and a French banker, named Delessert, sei
four ram lambs to the United States, but only one su
vived the passage. In 1802, Mr. Livingston, Americf
Minister in France, sent two pairs of French merin
from the Government flock, at Chalons. Later in tl
same year (1802), Colonel Humphreys brought hon
with him 21 rams and 70 ewes. In 1803, a gentleman :
Philadelphia imported two pairs of black merinos 1
1807, Mr. Muller imported a small number from Hes
Cassel. In 1809 and 1810, Mr. Jarvis, U.S., Consul i
Lisbon, purchased and shipped about 3,850 Spani:
merinos. Between the years 1809 and 1811, from 3,000
5,000 Spanish merinos were imported by other peopl
The famed Atwood merino is bred up from pure Hue
phrey’s blood. The flock was founded in 1813.

No colony has shown more remarkable progress in
sheep husbandry, in a limited time, than Queensland,
which owing to its extensive pastoral areas is destined
to become a large wool producing country. Fully one-
half of its immense territory is suitable for sheep breed-
ing, and will with care and attention grow good wool.
All that is required is skill in selecting suitable stock
for the country they are intended to inhabit, and as a
very large portion of what is generally termed sheep
country in the great northern colony consists of plateaux
and high rolling downs, the temperature, even in the sub-
tropical part, is not too high for wool, under careful
management, to retain its normal characteristics. A
more frequent introduction of fresh blood as well as a
more rigorous culling than is necessary in colder latitudes
will naturally be required to attain this end; but as the
advantages to be gained by this course of treatment are
so obvious and so generally admitted by wool growers
there is little to fear from the disadvantages of the
climate. The disastrous drought of 1868 taught the
Queensland flock-master a never-to-be-forgotten lesson,
and it is not likely that sheep will again be placed on
country that experience has shown to be entirely un-
suitable for wool growing.
The stock of sheep in Queensland at the time of its sepa-
ration from New South Wales, in 1859, was about 3,000,000,

In the year 1881 some of the large Riverine flock-
masters, becoming impressed with the much vaunted
robustness of character and density of fleece of the
American branch of the merino family, imported both
rams and ewes to cross with Australian sheep. The
chief importers so far in New South Wales have been
Mr. Thomas McFarland, of Yathong, who purchased, in
1881, the celebrated ram, New York, from the stud of Mr.
S. B. Lush, of Batavia, New York; Messrs. McFarland
Bros,, of Barooga, who commenced with Matchless, said
to have been the best ram in America at the time;
Messrs. Hay and Sons, of Boomanoomana, who selected
In eight years the quantity had increased to over
8,500,000, but from that date a gradual decrease com-
menced and continued until 1878, when the total number
of sheep amounted to only 5,631,634. Prom the year last
mentioned there has been a steady advance in the pas-
toral wealth of the colony. Not only has the number of
sheep increased, but also the quality of the wool produced
has reached a higher standard, thus illustrating the fact
that droughts are not an altogether unmixed evil. They
have operated beneficially in teaching station owners
that moderate stocking is the safest course to pursue, and
that attention to breed and quality of wool gives better
results than breeding for numbers alone. If the wool
growers of Queensland will assiduously use their best
efforts to bring their stock to the fullest perfection, which
they can only do by annually culling out their inferior
sheep and breeding from those which have distinct points
of excellence a great future is before them, as the ele-
vated table lands or downs of the interior are well
adapted for the growth of superfine wool.

Son, of Scone, who imported one ram and three ewes
from California, merely as an experiment, the progeny
of the cross being kept quite distinct from the famed
Scone merinos. In fact the experimental stage can
hardly be said to have been passed, and comparatively
little American blood has yet been introduced into
Australian flocks. The records of “woolly” and other
noted American merinos, whose fleeces weighed from 50
lbs. to 60 lbs., have never been approached here by any
imported sheep, the heaviest shorn, as far as the writer
is aware, being about half those weights, when the loss in
scouring was 75 per cent. Tor actual weight of wool
the Wanganella shearing of 1885 beats most of the
American records, and to this could be added numerous
other instances of heavy clipping in various parts of
Australia, did space permit.f
At Mr. Jas. Lees, Larras Lake Station, Molong, 20 rams
clipped on an average 21 lbs. 5 ozs. 'in 1886. At Mr.
Samuel McCaughey’s, Coonong, and Mr. T. S. Falkiner’s,
Bonooke, have also been shorn rams clipping over 20 lbs.
of clean bright wool.
Aside from this second introduction of American merinos
the importations of fine woolled sheep have been unim-
portant, which is mainly due to the fact that our stud
flocks, which have reached a very high state of perfec-
tion, are quite equal to the demand made upon them. By
intelligent care and judicious selection, assisted by an
unrivalled climate, our breeders have succeeded in perfect-
ing types of the merino, suitable for every temperature
and district of this continent where sheep will thrive,
thus enabling Australia to produce all classes of fine wool
used in the manufacture of textile fabrics, ranging from
a soft silky material of extreme fineness and rare beauty
down, through the numerous intermediary grades, to the
bold, shafty combing sorts as represented by the Wan-
ganella and Bonooke flocks in New South Wales, and the
Canowie, Levels and Bungaree flocks in South Australia.
All the essentials that go to make a perfect merino wool
are to be found in the pure Australian flocks of to-day,
where both climate and pasture are superior to those of
other countries for the production of high-class wool.
Want of space prevents reference in this treatise to
the various stud flocks now established in Australia and
Tasmania, which have done so much to improve the
quality of our wools; but should any reader of this article
desire to make himself acquainted with their origin,
history, and peculiar traits he will find the necessary in-
formation in Mr. George A. Brown’s excellent work on
“ Sheep Breeding in Australia.”
fOn 19th August, 1885, in the presence of a number

WOOL PRODUCTION.
Fortunately for growers, and all interested in the
manipulation, transmission, and manufacture of wool,
the demand for this great staple has always exceeded the
supply. Although fluctuations in value are frequent,
and at times severe, there has been no actual cessation in
the increasing rate of consumption, which may be re-
garded as one of the most remarkable facts in the indus-
trial history of this century. Before the opening of the
present century, England, which is by far the largest
importer of raw wools, and which has long held the lead
in the manufacture of woollen fabrics, relied to a great
extent on her own production. The total quantity of
foreign wool imported on an average of the three years
ending 1793, was only 3,060,471 lbs. By 1823 the demand
on outside sources had increased to 20,651,415 lbs., the
domestic supply being then estimated at 150,000,000 lbs.
The increasing productiveness of the Australian and
South African colonies had now begun to swell the
London imports, and the figures rose rapidly year by
year, until we find that by 1887 the collective imports
of wool into England had reached the extraordinary
aggregate of 1,813,310 bales, or 697,000,000 lbs., of which
quantity the Australasian colonies contributed 1,116,538
bales, or 390,789,900 lbs.*
The first export of Australian wool to the mother
country was from Port Jackson in 1807, and consisted of
245 lbs. By*lBls the clearances amounted to 32,971 lbs.
In 1821 the quantity shipped had risen to 179,633 lbs.,
4,200 lbs. being the produce of Yan Diemen’s Land.
Although not the first shipment from that province, it is
the first recorded, until the year 1827 their wool returns
being included in those of New South Wales. In 1837 the
exports had reached 7,789,777 lbs., of which quantity
176,081 lbs. were Victorian grown. South Australia con-
tributed 16,400 lbs., or £770 worth in the following year ;
and in 1846 the export from the Swan River settlement
reached 469,500 lbs. In 1850 the total export amounted
to 69,483,987 lbs.; in 1860 to 56,349,066 lbs.; in 1870 to
122,972,916 lbs.; and in 1880 to 277,737,268 lbs. The pro-
portions contributed by the several colonies are shown iu
following table, which is compiled from official returns:—
* The English imports are taken up to end of Decem-
ber ; the Australian exports are made up to end of July;
thus the whole of last year’s increase is not shown in
the imports, hence the discrepancy that occurs between
imports and productions.

It will be observed that the export of wool from Vic-
toria in 1885 was much greater than that from all the
colonies in the group combined, with the exception of
New South Wales, although she owns only one half the
number of sheep depasturing in the colonies referred to..
It must be remembered, however, that the above sum-
mary refers to export and not to production, and that a
large border and coast traffic exists between the colonies.
The attached tables, which give the export of each
province for the year 1885, as well »as particulars of its
distribution, will also show the extent of the intercolonial
traffic and its influence on the export of each particular
colony. Under the present system it is impossible to
arrive at the production of any colony except Tasmania,
and even there the export for 1885 is less than production.

The following prices, which represent the money value
•of Australian wool in London at various periods, will at
the same time serve to illustrate the fluctuations in the
value of our staple commodity previously referred to.
The Australian Agricultural Company’s reports show
that their 1828 clip, which may be taken as a fair sample
■of good New South Wales washed wool of that period,
averaged 20d. per lb. Their next year’s shearing, which
showed a decided improvement in quality and condition,
averaged about 24d. per lb., some of the finer kinds from
the Saxon and French sheep sent from Europe to the
Company’s estates, realising from 2s. 6d. to ss. 3d. per lb.,
■whilst the fleeces from sheep purchased in New South
Wales sold at about 23£d. per lb. In 1824, Van Diemen’s
Land wool in the grease ranged from 3d. to 6d. per lb.
■owing to its inferior quality, but from that date a steady
Improvement in value took place. In 1831, the Van Die-
men’s Land Company realised 19Jd. per lb. for their wool
all round.* For some superfine merino fleeces of little
weight they obtained 3s. 5Jd. per fleece, and for fleeces
from improved sheep crossed by merino, 4s. 6Jd. per
fleece. In 1833 the Camden flock (Mr. Macarthur’s)
averaged the high price of 3s. 6d.perlb., while the general

average of other wool was from Is. lid. to 2s. 9d. per lb.,
according to quality. Some extra superior wool from the
Camden sheep brought 4s. 6d. per lb. during that year.
In 1834 the market price lor best Australian was 4s. 6d,
per lb. In 1838 superior washed from the same flock
sold up to 3s. 3d., and in 1839 up to 3s. Id. per lb.
In 1840 the current prices for Australian wool were as
follows:

In 1850 the average price of merino greasy, which had
risen from 9d. to 12d. per lb., fell, in the final series of the
following year to the first-named figure. A gradual advance
then took place, until 13£d. per lb. was reached in
August of 1853, only to suddenly drop to 9d. by the end
of the year. The market, however, recovered its tone
immediately, and prices rose.steadily until the highest
point during a period of thirty years was touched, namely.
15jd. per lb. This extreme average is recorded in the
third series of 1857, and was followed by a sudden fall in
the next sales to 9Jd., or a drop of 6d. per lb. in one
series of auctions. Prices remained steady at this level
until the November of 1858, when they again rose, and
after reaching 14jd. in 1860, continued to waver between
lid. and 13d. per lb. until 1867. Prom that date the
market began to decline, and prices did not see their
lowest limit until 1870, when 7Jd. per lb. was accepted in
the public sales for merino fleece. During the whole of
the next year prices continued to harden, and by
Christmas, 1871,14 Jd per. lb. was reached.
The following facts, which are taken from the Leeds
Mercury, of 23rd January, 1872, plainly show the rapidity
with which fortunes can be made or lost in the wool
trade.

These high rates, however, were not of long duration.
From 1872 to the closing sales of 1876, prices gradually
fell to IOJd. per lb., but rose in the next series to 14d. per
lb., only to fall almost as rapidly to 9Jd. per lb. in 1879.
In the February of 1880,14Jd. per lb. was again reached ;
but ere the year was out prices had declined to about 11 Jd.
per lb., which value was maintained up to the close of 1882.
In 1883, the price stood about 10jd., rose in 1884 to
Hid., , [declined to BJd. in the September series of
1885, but rose in the next sales to 9Jd. In April, 1886,
the price fell to BJd., but rose in the September series to

Crossbred wools, more especially those descriptions
which enter into competition with wools of English
growth, suffered to a far greater extent during the period
since 1880. The coarser the quality the greater has been the
fall; and unless some of our long-wool growers exercise
more care in the selection of their breeding stock, it will
soon be a difficult matter to find an outlet for the mongrel
fleeces they produce. As an illustration of the decline in
the value of English wool, it may be mentioned that the
price of pure lustre brook-washed fleeces fell from 20|d.
per lb. in 1874, to 10d$. per lb. in 1887. If, then,
pure Lincoln remains at this low figure, and there
is little prospect of improvements at present, what is to
be expected for a very large proportion of the crossbred
wool shipped from these colonies which has neither breed
nor character. Those who, by the small extent of their
holdings, the moist nature of their pastures, or their
proximity to large markets, are committed to the growth
of coarse wool, should exert themselves to breed up to a
far higher standard of excellence than they have yet
attained, if they wish to derive the greatest amount of
profit obtainable from this breed of sheep. Pure long-
wool stock, equal in size of carcase and weight of fleece to
any in the world are to be obtained in the colonies at
reasonable cost, and it is to be hoped that the poor prices
now ruling for low wools will be the means of impressing
on our farmers and small growers the necessity for imme-
diate attention to a matter which so closely affects their
interests.

Our local woollen manufacturers also consume annually
a considerable quantity of the staple, and although the
exact consumption in the colonies cannot be stated, an
estimate of 10,000 bales would not be far short of the mark.
Accepting this estimate as correct, a total production for
the Australian colonies and New Zealand of 1,030,000 bales
is arrived at, representing, at £l4 per bale, a money value of
£14,420,070 sterling. This may appear to many to be a low
average per bale, but when the large proportion of greasy
and coarse wools is considered it will be found to be a.
The quantity of Australasian wool imported to London
during the year 1887 amounted to 1,116,538 bales, or about

reasonable one. Messrs. Helmuth, Schwartze, and Co., in
referring to this subject in their Annual Review for
1887, remark : “ The total value paid by the woollen
industry for its yearly supply of colonial wool has not
increased since 1872. There are two years, 1879-80, the
first a year of undue depression, the other of equally
undue elation, produced by the American boom, where
the amounts differ considerably. But with these two
exceptions the yearly total has mostly fluctuated between
£18,000,000 and £20,000,000 (total colonial supply is here
referred to). The quantity of wool has in the meanwhile
grown from 743,000 bales to 1,444,000 bales. Allowance
should indeed be made for the largely increased pro-
portion of grease shipped, at present, from Australia, and
the consequent smaller contents of the bales. But even
giving this point due weight, the quantitative increase
is yet about 80 per cent, by the side of a stationary total
value.”
The proportion that greasy or unwashed wool bears to
the rest of our clip has already been shown, and the fol-
lowing figures, extracted from a carefully prepared table,
compiled by Mr. J. G. Ronald, will indicate the rate of
increase of the crossbred production, which in 1887 repre-
sented 20 per cent, of the total quantity catalogued:—

LOCAL SALES.
Although London has long been the principal mart for
Australian wools, a large and annually increasing quantity
is disposed of in the colonies. During the season —October
to January—auction sales of sufficient importance to

command the attendance of representatives from Gre
Britain, America, and the chief manufacturing countri
of Europe, are held in Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaid
in which cities great facilities are offered for the sale ai
shipment of wool. For the year 1887-8 the sales in tl
three leading colonies were as follows:
Melbourne and Geelong .. .. 188,080 bales.
Sydney 150,203 „
Adelaide .. .. .. .. 34,695
thus making a total of 372,948 bales, or considerably above
one-third of our total production. Of this quantity
116,000 bales were despatched, via London, to the mills in
England, France and Belgium, whilst 61,745 bales were
taken for direct transmission to America and various
Continental ports. It will thus be seen that a large pro-
portion of the Wool disposed of at the local sales finds its
way direct to the manufacturers. As great efforts con-
tinue to be made by the selling brokers in the colonies to
meet the requirements of the trade, by providing ample
accommodation for the grower, and placing at the dis-
posal of the buyer every facility for purchasing with
ease and security, it is confidently anticipated that when
more steamers are laid on, this direct trade will rapidly
increase, and that in the not distant future the bulk of
the wool grown in Australia will be sold in the locnl
markets. Already lines of powerful steamers connect us
with London, Hamburg, Antwerp and Marseilles, and
there is a probability of our soon being in direct com-
munication with Trieste; thus opening up fresh markets
in Austria and Italy.
Within the last few years periodical sales of Ai
wool have been established on the Continent of Europe;
and there is every reason to believe that strenuous efforts
will be made by those interested in their success to
increase their importance by purchasing largely
in the colonies. No doubt the facilities for sale
afforded by the extensive warehouse accommodation now
available at our chief shipping ports, have greatly tended
to foster and develop this direct trade, whilst the large
selection of clips brought forward has contributed to
secure full attendance of buyers, and spirited competition
for all wools offered.
Auction sales for the disposal of wool and station pro-
duce have been established in the colonies for many years.
In 1844 the Australian Oxen Company commenced opera-
tions in Sydney, but as their efforts to form a market
were not successful, the business was taken up three
years after by the late Mr. Thomas Sutcliffe Mort, whose
name from that date until the time of his death was
associated with every enterprise tending to develop the
pastoral interests of the country. Sales of wool com-
menced in Melbourne about the same period, one of the
first selling brokers being the late Mr. Isaac Hinds. The
production at this early stage of the colony’s career was
comparatively small, consequently the transactions were
limited, and it was not until the beginning of the next
decade that the sales became of much importance. By
this time Mr. Richard Goldsbrough was well established
in the business, and it is mainly through his practical
knowledge, enterprise and foresight in providing ample


accommodation for the storage and display of wool at the
start, that Melbourne has become one of the chief wool
marts of the world. Wool sales in Adelaide are of com-
paratively recent date, and may be said to have commenced
in 1878, when Messrs. Elder, Smith and Co. took up the
business. At that time the quantity sold locally was not
only limited, but the business was conducted in a manner
not likely to attract many buyers. Since then, however,
astonishingly rapid progress has been made, which is
mainly due to the efforts of the firm above mentioned,
who, by their indomitable perseverance, soon succeeded in
surmounting the numerous difficulties that usually
surround the establishment of a new market. Sales of
wool are also held in Brisbane during the season; and
although they are not yet of sufficient importance to call
for more than a passing notice, the time may not be far
distant when the buyers of the fine wools peculiar to
Queensland will find their best market at the seat of pro-
duction. The northern capital, in common with the
other chief cities of Australia, is now connected by steam
with Great Britain and the continent of Europe; and as
the great inducements offered for selling in the colonies
in preference to shipment are becoming so generally
recognised, obstacles that a few years back appeared in-
surmountable, are thus readily overcome.
The advantages gained by operating in the country of
production are equally divided between buyer and seller,
and this fact is no doubt the chief cause of the rapidly
increasing popularity of the colonial sales. By selling
locally the grower realises the full value of his wool at
once, and is saved the risk and anxiety attendant on
shipping to a distant and uncertain market; while the
manufacturer, on the other hand, can here obtain a full
selection of our choicest clips, and, by taking advantage
of the steam communication via Suez Canal, get delivery
at his mills within six weeks of the date of purchase. He
is consequently able to place his new goods on the
market six weeks earlier than if he waited for the Lon-
don sales to supply his requirements, thus effecting a
great saving in interest and expense.
The following comparative table will show the pro-
gressive increase in the sales effected in the three leading
Australian colonies for the last eight years, and the re-
eight years, and the re-
lation they bear in percentages to the total exports :

a feature of almost every inland town throughout the
colonies, and although it may be a question for future
consideration whether it would not be desirable to con-
centrate effort more and reduce the number of shows,
their beneficial influence to the present on the quality
and condition of our great staple cannot be questioned.
The annual shows of stud sheep held in Sydney under the
auspices of the Agricultural Society of New South Wales,
in Melbourne under those of the Australian Sheep
Breeders’ Association, in Tasmania under those of the
Northern Agricultural Association, and in Adelaide by
the South Australian Stock Breeders’ Association are
large and popular exhibitions. During the last few
years the quality of the exhibits has been of a very high
standard, and as many of the animals present scarcely
any noticeable points of difference the judges have not
unfrequently an arduous duty in estimating their respec-
tive merits.
At the last annual show in Melbourne, and at the sales
which followed, some of the most perfect types of the
Australian merino yet exhibited in these colonies were
brought forward. Owing to the quarantine regulations
the competition was almost exclusively confined to Vic-
torian-bred sheep, but many superb animals from the
other colonies —notably Tasmania and South Australia—
were present in the sale rooms. Although many
hundreds of sheep from various parts of the
colonies are brought together at these sales, it
would be difficult to find one without some dis-
tinct points of excellence, whilst amongst the prize-
takers and some others of equal merit that did not com-
pete, would be found numerous animals, combining in
the highest degree all the great essentials of first-class
merinos, namely, quality of wool, density of fleece,
length and evenness of staple, and symmetry of
form. Indeed, it is not too much to say that they
could not be surpassed, if equalled, in any country in the
world. Associations of this kind cannot, therefore, fail
to exercise a beneficial influence on our staple product,
and in the interests of the country at large it is to be
hoped that they will always meet with the encourage-
ment they deserve.
The exhibitions of wool which are held periodically
in Melbourne, Sydney, and Adelaide, are equally deserv-
ing of special notice. Like the pastoral shows they have
the effect of inciting considerable discussion on the
merits of different varieties of sheep and their adapta-
bility for certain climates, as well as on the subject of
wool growing generally. Being intercolonial, numerous
varieties of the staple are passed in review, consequently
the knowledge and experience thus gained are of a
thorough and comprehensive character,
The first Victorian wool show on record was held at
the warehouses of Messrs. Cuningham and Macredie
Melbourne, on the 12th January, 1866. It was confined to
merino wool, but open to all the colonies. Each exhibit
was to consist of two bales, one to be valued and sold by
auction in Melbourne, and the other to be sent to London
to be valued and afterwards disposed of there. The
result of this competition will probably be of interest to
those connected with pastoral pursuits, and the particu-
lars are, therefore, given in the following table :

Writing on the subject of this Exhibition, Messrs. R.
oldsbrough and Co. remark in their January circular
: that year :—“ On this occasion the first prize for the
ost superior sample, as regards character and condition,
is been allotted to an exhibit from Tasmania of the well
Manx brand, which breed probably owes its best
eristic to the admixture of choice German blood
ith our pure Australian merino. The progeny of im-
irtations from the celebrated French merinos of the
ibouillet flocks also appeared to great advantage, as
enced by strong and long stapled fleeces. The
iples of pure bred Australian were not in such desir-
s condition as could have been wished, and conse-
ntly did not show to proper advantage; still,under
re favourable auspices, we do not doubt that first class
sees could have been produced. Taking the exhibition
a whole, conclusive proofs are furnished of the great
itage that has been derived from the valuable selec-
of rams which of late years have been imported
n Europe, and we feel assured that, under the foster-
influences of one of the most favourable climates in
world their progeny must in future years be fully
alto, and probably eclipse, the most celebrated flocks
Europe.”
The second exhibition of this kind was held at the
une stores under the auspices of the Ballarat, Skipton,
ad other pastoral societies on the 16th January, 1867.
Ithough only two years had elapsed since the holding of
le previous show, a steady improvement was noticeable
i the class of exhibits brought forward. Most of the
pies were well got up, and it is gratifying to note
< on this occasion the pure Australian merinos took
highest stand, notwithstanding the fact that some
really splendid samples produced by crossing with
nported stock were exhibited.”* As a proof of the
nperior class of wool shown, it may be mentioned that,
■ the auction sale subsequently held, the exhibition lots
ialised prices ranging up to 3s. BJd. per lb.
On the 14th February, 1878, a large and interesting ex-
ion of wool was held in Melbourne by Messrs. B.
sbrough and Co. The highest value per fleece was
e test on this occasion, and the first prize was awarded
Mr. E. W. Pitts of The Levels, South Australia, whose
hibit of 60 ewes’ fleeces was valued at £29 Os. BJd., or
average of 11s. 7Jd. per fleece. Mr. Lachlan Mcßean,
Woorooma, New South Wales, won the second prize,
s exhibit being valued at 11s. 6jd. per fleece; and Mr.
L. Currie, of Larra, Victoria, came next with an
? erage of 10s. 9Jd. per fleece.
In the February of the following year Messrs. H. Cun-
and Co., held an exhibition, when prizes were
ded for the highest value per lb., as well as for the
valuable fleeces. This being the largest and most
m Plete wool show held in the colonies up to that time

with a sample valued at 3s. 9d. per lb.; and Messrs.
William Gibson and Son, of Scone, were awarded the
honors in the unwashed class for an exhibit valued at
Is. 7£d. per wool.
At the wool shows held at the Sydney and Melbourne
International Exhibitions, some splendid samples of Aus-
tralian merino wool were shown, comprising exhibits from
many of the most noted flocks in Australia, Tasmania and
New Zealand.
Space will not permit of more lengthy reference to
these interesting competitions. Suffice it to say, that,
while in no instance had quantity been sacrificed to
quality , the general excellence of our merino flocks was
indisputably proved to be second to none in the world.
Judging from the number of samples exhibited of a bold
shafty character, it would appear that a large number of
our flockmasters are becoming alive to the fact that sheep
producing long stapled bulky wool —wool with plenty of
bone in it —are the most profitable to cultivate over a
large portion of this continent; and in face of the
existing demand for wools of this class, it would be idle
to dispute the wisdom of this course of breeding.
A good market for superfine wools will, without doubt,
always exist; but owing to the expensive nature of the
manufactured article, the demand must necessarily be
limited, while on the other hand, the consumption of
fine goods of a slightly lower grade promises to increase
with the spread of civilization ; consequently there is
little to fear, as far as we can see at present, from over-
production of strong combing wools.
It has been estimated that within the last twenty
years the average weight of wool obtained per head
from the Australian flocks has almost doubled, the in-
crease in weight being most marked during the last
decade. Gratifying as this advance must be to all in-
terested in pastoral affairs, it is still more pleasing to
know that in obtaining this result the high quality of the
wool has been retained, its length increased, and its
general character improved—the result of skilful
management, unremitting care, and unwearying assidu-
ity, aided by a climate pre-eminently suited for the
favourable development of the merino breed.
Although much has been already done to improve the
stock of the colonies, much more remains to be accom-
plished, and the wool and sheep shows of the future have
a large field before them in which to exereise that in-
fluence which has been so beneficial in the past. A large
amount of praise is therefore due to those gentlemen
who were the prometers of institutions that have
assisted in sc marked a manner to increase the wealth of
the country, as well as to those who aid by prizes and
donations to further the objeet for which the same were
founded.


FUTURE PROSPECTS.
To all conversant with the position of the sheep in-
dustry in the great wool-growing countries of the world,
the enquiry' as to the possibility of finding markets to
meet the ever increasing production naturally presents
itself, for upon this the future prosperity of Australian
sheep husbandry mainly depends. Marvellous as have
been recent strides in the production of wool on this
continent, it must also be borne in mind that great, if
not equal, progress has been made by other pastoral
countries ; and as those causes, natural and otherwise,
■which in the past occasionally checked increase, are be-
coming less frequent and violent in their action, there is
every reason to believe that rapid development will
continue.
Leaving large European States, such as Russia and
Austria-Hungary, where sheep raising is pursued with
intelligence and vigour, we turn to those vast continents
in the southern and western hemispheres possessed of
almost illimitable areas, specially adapted by soil and
climate for pastoral occupation. Commencing with
Australia we find that recent explorations have dispelled
the supposition that its interior is a waterless desert,
where sheep cannot thrive, and that each year settle-
ment is being pushed farther inland. In many instances
the new country taken up is at once stocked with sheep ;
improvements are commenced on a large scale, and the
whole face of the country is being transformed. Districts
that a few years ago were trackless wastes, absolutely
without value, are now fine properties, yielding handsome
returns to intrepid pioneers. In Queensland, Western
Australia, and the northern territory, millions of acres of
rich pastoral land are yet unstocked, and stations in the
settled districts are, through the erection of fences and
the conservation of water, made to feed double the num-
ber of sheep they were able to carry in their unimproved
condition. It is therefore scarcely possible to estimate
the extent of Australian production by the close of this
century; but presuming that the present rate of increase
is maintained, its wool crop would amount to something
like, 2,700,000 bales.
In the Argentine Republic and Uruguay, which rank
next to Australia as wool-growing countries, the same
rapid development is observable, and each year shows an
improvement in the general character of the clip. Blest
with a genial climate, with rich pastures and never-
failing streams, they offer conditions for sheep farming
quite equal to, if not surpassing, those of our own coun-
try, and were it not for the instability of their past
governments and the supineness of their woolgrowers,
they would long since have taken, in point of quantity,
the foremost position amongst the wool growing coun-
tries of the world. The number of sheep depasturing in
the above States is estimated at 90,921,000, and now that
stable governments are established in both countries,
far more rapid development may be anticipated.
Great attention has also been given to sheep husband
in the United States of America for some time past, ai
the fiockmasters of Texas, California, Kansas, and oth
states and territories possessing the necessary conditio
for remunerative wool-growing are now making strenuo
efforts to improve the quality of their wool, and at t
same time to increase the supply, the number of she
having increased from 28,477,951 in 1870, to 40,190,866
1880, which number had further increased by 1887
44,759,314.
On all sides, then, we find a large expansion tak
place, and although the consumption has so far kept p
with it, we fail to see how the immense production of
future can possibly be absorbed at remunerative pr
unless fresh outlets are found for the raw material, ar
reform in the U.S. tariff occurs. Fortunately for the si
industry in all parts of the world, the efforts that h
recently been made to create new markets in some of
densely-populated countries of the East have met v
fair encouragement. Already a large trade in Califon
wool has been opened up by America with Japan,
the readiness with which European manufactures
adopted there, augurs favorably for the future, as
as that Empire is concerned. In the North-west 1
vinces of India the woollen industry is also establisl
An attempt has also been made to introduce our i
wools into China, and Australian yam even has 1
manufactured there; but the efforts made have not b
attended with much success up to the present,
renewed, however, they would probably meet with n
encouragement, and no time should be lost in mat
the experiment.
To the Bast, and in America, we must look for t
outlet which our ever-increasing supply requires; i
should we be successful in obtaining a fair market
our wools in either of the countries we have named,
anxiety respecting the future prospects of our sta
industry would be removed. One of the best results
the Calcutta International Exhibition was that of mak
the people of the East acquainted with many of
numerous varieties of Australian wool, several of wh
could, no doubt, be readily adapted to the textile ma
factures' of the country; and if the advantage t
gained be properly followed up, and persistent endeavo
be made to familiarize the people in the East with
use of woollen fabrics for clothing purposes, the gaii
Australia would be beyond calculation.
With the markets of Europe, which we now commi
ever open to receive our finer qualities, with free v
in the United States, and the teeming East ready to i
all our low kinds, production could be allowed to devi
to its fullest extent, and no industry in the world w<
have a more brilliant future before it than the I
Trade of Australia.

Thh important progress that the mining industry of
New South Wales has made is apparent when we corn-
pare the value of the mineral production of the past ten
years with that of the production of each of the four
preceding decades :

Previous to the year 1851 coal was the only mineral
raised, and even up to the year 1871 the only minerals
which had been worked were coal, shale, gold, copper,

December, 1881, tin, silver, iron, lead, asbestos, and bis-
muth have been added to our mineral products.

COAL*
Coal, though discovered in the year 1796 or 1797, was
not worked to any great extent till 1830.
The coal measures embrace an area of about 23,950
square miles. The seams worked vary from 3 feet to 25
feet in thickness, are nearly horizontal, and are in some
localities considerably above sea-level. There are at the
Present time seventy-two collieries at work, employing in
the aggregate above and below ground 8,118 miners and
others. In addition to the foregoing there are two mines
a t which very valuable seams of petroleum oil, cannel
coal, or kerosene shale are being worked. The number
of men employed at these mines above and below ground
18 317. Since 1865, when the working of these seams
commenced, the output has been 289,349 tons, valued at
£665,160 ss.

There are three principal coal-mining districts: the
Hunter River and Newcastle Coal-field, situated to the
north of Sydney; the Southern or Illawarra Coal-field;
and the Western or Lithgow Coal-field, upon the Great
Western Railway-line, about 85 miles west from the
metropolis. Coal is also being worked near Berrima,
between Illawarra and Lithgow; and some seams are
known to occur in the country lying between Lithgow
and the Hunter River. Sydney, therefore, occupies an
almost central position with regard to the coal-mining
districts, and beyond these coal has been discovered in
different parts of the colony, viz., near Inverell, Denison-
town, Dubbo, Barraba, Clarence, &c.
The seams of coal at present worked occur in the
Upper and Lower Coal Measures, in both of which
characteristic fossil plants of the genera Glossopteris and
Phyllolheca are found, while associated only with the
Lower Coal Measures are marine beds containing Spiri-
fers, Productce, and Orthoceras, with other fauna of Car-
boniferous age. The Newcastle or Upper Coal Measures
are believed to be of Permian age.
The seams of petroleum oil, cannel coal, or kerosene
shale, also occur in the Coal Measures. At Greta or
Anvil Creek it forms irregular layers sometimes over 6
inches thick in the main bituminous coal seam ; also at
America Creek, in one part of the mine, the seam of
kerosene shale was found to change into bituminous coal;
but at the Joadja Creek and Hartley mines it forms distinct
seams, attaining a thickness of 5 feet in the latter mine.
Kerosene shale occurs near Gulgong, Murrurundi, and
several other localities. An extensive deposit has been
recently found at Capertee, near the line of railway, from
Wallerawang to Mudgee. “It has unquestionably re-
suited,” says the late Rev. W. B. Clarke, “ from the local
deposition of some resinous wood, and passes generally
into ordinary coal, many portions of the same bed
in the Illawarra mines exhibiting the impress of fronds
of Glossopteris as plainly as they are shown in ordinary
coal shale.” * * * “ Presuming that the origin above
suggested is correct, viz. the occasional occurrence in
the ancient deposits of trees of a peculiar resinous con-
stitution, there is no anomaly in finding in one spot a
mere patch amidst a coal seam (as in the case of Anvil
Creek, on the Hunter River), or thick-bedded masses of
greater area, as in the coal seams of Mount York or of
America Creek, in the Illawarra, depending upon the
original amount of drift timber.”
The shale yields on an average about 150 gallons of
crude oil per ton, which contains over 60 per cent, of
refined kerosene oil, and the remaining products consist
of gasoline, benzine, spongaline, paraffin, wood-preserving
composition, and lubricating oil.
Its gas-producing capabilities amount to the large
yield of over 18,000 cubic feet of gas. with an illuminating
power of thirty-eight to forty candles. On this account
it has been found advantageous for mixing with ordinary
coal in the manufacture of gas.
GOLD.
Mining for gold in Australia commenced in the year
1851, but the discovery is recorded as far back as 1823.
Mr. Surveyor M‘Brian, in his field notes of the survey of
the Fish River, between Tarana and O’Connell, states—
“ February 15,1823. At BPSO to river, and marked gum-
tree. At this place I found numerous particles of gold in
the sand in the hills convenient to the river.”
In 1839 Count Strzelecki found auriferous pyrites.
In 1841—23rd and 24th February—Rev. W. B. Clarke,
M.A., F.R.S., discovered gold in situ in the granite
formation between Hartley and Hassan’s Walls, and at
the head of Winbumdale Rivulet. He very shortly
afterwards spoke of the abundance of gold likely to be
found in the colony, and as early as 1843 mentioned it
generally. In 1844 he showed a sample to the Governor
of New South Wales, Sir George Gipps, who said, “ Put it
away, Mr. Clarke, or we shall all have our throats cut.”
Professor Geekie, Director of H.M. Geological Survey
of Scotland, in his “ Life of Murchison ” thus refers to
Mr. Clarke’s discovery of gold—•“ The first explorer who
proclaimed the probable auriferous veins of Australia on
true scientific grounds—that is, by obtaining gold in situ
and tracing the present rock through the country—was
the Rev. W. B. Clarke, M.A., F.R.S., who, originally a


clergyman in England, has spent a long and laborious
life in working out the geological structure of his
adopted country, New South Wales. He found gold in
1841, and exhibited it to numerous members of the Legis-
lature, declaring, at the same time, his belief in its
abundance. While, therefore, geologists in Europe were
guessing, he, having actually found the precious metal,
was tracing its occurrence far and near on the ground.”
In 1843 or ’44, Macgregor, a shepherd, is said to have
found gold in the Wellington district.
In 1849 a shepherd boy was reported to have found a
nugget of gold in the Pyrenees (Victoria).
On 3rd April, 1851, Mr. B. H. Hargraves, who had
recently returned from California, addressed a letter to
the Colonial Secretary stating that he had been prospect-
ing for two months, and offered to point out the localities
in which he had discovered gold to any officer of the
Government on condition of the Government awarding
him £5OO as a compensation. To this the Government
directed that a similar answer should be given to that
returned to the former proposal of Mr. Smith.
The distance between the Albert Goldfield and the
Delegate Goldfield being 672 miles, and between the
latter and the Ballina Goldfield being 600 miles, it will be
seen that gold fields are distributed over the greater part
of the colony. Notwithstanding that the search for gold
has been carried on for thirty years, new fields or new
deposits are continually being discovered, some of them
in localities which were supposed to have been thoroughly
examined. Some of the fields recently discovered promise
to equal in extent and richness any discovered in the
early days; while our oldest fields, though apparently
exhausted as far as the miner unaided by capital and
skill is capable of exhausting them, yet contain deposits
of gold which will yield a rich harvest to the skilled
miner who shall bring to bear upon them appliances such
as are being successfully employed elsewhere. The truth
of this statement is likely to be demonstrated in a very
marked manner by the application of hydraulic sluicing
to the deposits at Kiandra, a field where gold mining has
been carried on upwards of twenty years, under the ordi-
nary primitive conditions, without any special success.
In order to encourage the introduction of such a
system of mining as will lead to the profitable working
of localities from which the operative miner can no
longer extract a living by means of the pick and shovel
alone, it will be necessary to provide security of tenure
over comparatively large areas subject to the employ-
ment of necessary appliances and labour.
Gold has always been found in association with certain
formations, and the extent of country occupied by these
is about 70,000 square miles—or nearly one-fourth of the
whole area of the colony—a considerable portion of which
has not yet been touched by the pick of the miner.
Gold-bearing quartz reefs have been found in New
South Wales in sedimentary rocks of Upper Silurian,
Devonian, and Carboniferous ages ; also in hornblendic
granites, porphyry, diorite, and serpentine; while the
deposits which contain alluvial or waterworn gold in
payable quantity, and which have been derived from the
degradation of these formations, are of Permian, Cre-
taceous, Tertiary, and Quartenary ages.
Auriferous quartz reefs in the Upper Silurian formation
have been worked at Hill End and Tambaroora, Trunkey,
Temora, Mount Brown, &c.; in the Devonian, at Nana
Creek, Boorook, &c,; in the Carboniferous, at Barring-
ton or Copeland ; in hornblendic granites, at Braidwood,
Adelong, &c.; in porphyry, at Grenfell; in diorite, at
Gulgong, Temora, Parkes, &c.; in serpentine, at Gun-
dagai, Lucknow, &c. The reefs vary from a few inches
to 10 feet in width, though occasionally they attain a
greater thickness. They generally have a meridional
strike, especially where they traverse the Silurian forma-
tion ; but in many localities the strike runs in other
directions. Thus at Hill End, Trunkey, and Adelong,
the prevailing strike is about N. and S.; at Dalmorton,
from E. 10° N. to E. 30° S.; at Grenfell, N.E.; at Temora
and Copeland, from N.E. to B. and S.E.
In these reefs the gold seldom occurs without one or more
of the following sulphurets: pyrites, galena, mispickel,
blende, and copper pyrites ; calcite is also frequently pre-
sent, and barytes rarely. At Hill End portions of the reefs
* See Geological Map of Hill End and Tambaroora, by
E. F. Pittman, Geological Surveyor, 1880.
contain potash mica (muscovite). “ In some places the mi<
was found to entirely replace the quartz, and here the gol
was found to be excessively rich.”* These reefs traver
chlorite slate, clay slates, and metamorphosed conglom
rates; the latter contain obscure impressions of encrinik
sperifera , and fa vosiles.
The rich quartz veins at Lucknow occur along the lii
of junction of serpentine and hornblende porpliyrj
besides quartz, the vein-stuff includes calcite, asbestc
serpentine, and abundance of mispickel, also a little mai
netite ; the gold is sometimes visibly disseminated throuj
the mispickel and serpentine.*
At Barmedman, in the Bland District, and at Cowarbe
in the Murrumbidgee District, gold is not only found i
the veins of quartz with pyrites and galena, but also i
the cleavage planes and joint-fissures of the adjoinii
slates. Near Glen Dines, in the New England Distric
it has been found in bismuth ores.
At the Brown’s Creek Mine, 6 miles west from Blayne
an immense breccia lode has been worked for mai
years. The gold is disseminated in fine particles througi
out the lode, and also in hard siliceous accretions whk
have been formed by segregation in the lode stuff; tl
gold, therefore, has evidently been deposited from soli
tion. The lode has been extensively worked, and yieli
an average of about 3 dwts. of gold per ton.
A quartz reef near Braidwood contains gold, cobal
iron pyrites, copper pyrites, blende, and galena.
On several of the gold-fields the reefs contain muc
pyrites, which, on assay, have been proved to be more i
less rich in gold. New South Wales doubtless affords
very promising field for the introduction of efficiei
appliances for the extraction of gold from pyrites.
A high yield of gold has, in some cases, been obtain(
from the silver lodes of Boorook, the ores from whic
consist of chloride and sulphide of silver, with a litt
iodide of silver.
Throughout the gold-fields, gold is always found to 1
more or less alloyed with silver and occasionally wii
traces of copper, iron, osmo-iridium, and other metals.
The greatest depth at which auriferous reefs have bee
worked in New South Wales is 1,010 feet, viz., in the Ad
long United Gold-mine, Adelong.
At Araluen, Uralla, the Granite diggings, near Mom
Brown, and other diggings where the formation consis
of granite, the gold in the alluvium has evidently m
only been derived from quartz reefs but also from tl
granite rock itself.
Near Hockley gold occurs in altered talcose schists.
The greater proportion of the gold hitherto raised hi
been from alluvial deposits. These, as before mention®
are of Permian, Cretaceous, Tertiary, and Quarternai
ages.
The Permian deposits consist of pebble conglomerat
forming the base of the Coal Measures, or “ Glossoptei
beds,” at the Tallawang diggings, and resting upon t.
Silurian schists traversed by quartz reefs from which t
gold must originally have been derived. The conglom
rate yields from 1 to 16 dwts. of gold per ton, wh:
nuggets weighing 5 oz. have been obtained from it. T.
gold is generally in the form of flat scaly pieces, ai
waterworn.
Gold has been recently discovered in the marine co
glomerates and shale beds, which are believed to be
Cretaceous age, and which rests upon the flanks of t.
Silurian, Devonian, and granite formations i» the Mou
Brown or Albert Gold Fields.f It is probable' that the
marine beds will only be found payably auriferous whe
they fill hollows or “ gutters ” in the surface of the old
formations.
Of the Tertiary deposits, gold in payable quantity h
been obtained from the Lower, Middle, and Upper Pli
oene alluvia, chiefly from the two latter. These are
fresh-water origin, and consist of ancient river-drifts
pebbles, sand, and clays, the remains of auriferous ft
mations winch had been disintegrated by denude
agencies during the erosion of the valleys. “ The foss
found in these fluviatile deposits or ‘ deep leads ’ of t
Middle and Upper Pliocene beds are very numeroj

Victoria, whose researches have thrown so much light
upon the character of the vegetation of this period, has
described no less than thirteen genera and sixteen species
of extinct forms, some of which have living allies. It is
worthy of remark that in Australia the Upper Pliocene is
the oldest formation in which the Eucalyptus has been
discovered ; it would therefore appear that this genus,
which now includes the principal forest trees of Australia,
is, geologically speaking, of comparatively recent intro-
duction on the Continent.”
In many localities the old river beds, or “ leads,” as the
miners term them, have been overwhelmed by flows of
volcanic rocks which are sometimes 200 feet thick ; con-
sequently shafts have to be sunk tlirough the basalt, as
on the Forest and other gold-fields, to reach the gold-
bearing gravels; but where, as on the Cudgegong River,
&0., the basalt has been completely cut through by the
subsequent erosion of the valleys, the leads may be
readily worked from adits driven under the basalt.
From 1,546 loads of wash-dirt from one of the rich
claims (four men’s ground) on the Happy Valley Lead,
near Gulgong, 6,203 oz. of gold were obtained ; and from
a claim on the Canadian Lead, on the same gold-field,
seven men in three years obtained, free of all expenses,
gold to the value of £28,000. One ounce of gold
per load, though above the average yield, is not an
uncommon return from the wash-dirt of the Pliocene
leads. But upon the Gulgong, Parkes, Forbes, and other
fields of gold-bearing fame, some of the leads have
been followed into deep ground where, owing to the
heavy influx of water, they could not be further profitably
worked by the ordinary manual efforts of the miners.
However, with the aid of steam power and improved
gold-saving appliances, they will probably afford remu-
nerative employment for many years to come.
The Quarternary or Post Pliocene and recent gold-
bearing drifts are found in all the alluvial flats through
which the rivers and creeks meander, and in the more
shallow ground, or “surfacing,” upon the sides and sum-
mits of the hills, in proximity to the rocks and reefs from
which the gold has been derived. On many of the gold-
fields these deposits proved immensely rich, and on
account of the facility with which they could be worked,
by even inexperienced miners, they were quickly ex-
hausted, excepting in localities where water was scarce,
and there are many such places, where the surfacing will
pay to re-work by ground-sluicing when a sufficient sup-
ply of water can be brought to operate upon it.
On the Mount Brown Gold-field, in the north-west part
of the colony, where there is a scarcity of water, owing to
the aridity of the climate, large quantities of gold have
been obtained from the alluvial by dry-blowing, wliich is
a tedious and troublesome process for the miners. Lat-
terly, however, two patents have been taken out —one by
Messrs. C. Phillips and Co., and the other by Captain
Park—for inventions of dry-blowing machinery for treat-
ing dry and loose gold-bearing deposits ; the recent public
trials of these maoliines proved successful.
Taking into consideration, therefore, the above-men-
tioned deposits not yet worked out, together with the
large extent of country occupied by formations of an
auriferous character awaiting the search of the prospector,
gold-mining in New South Wales may be regarded as an
important and permanent industry.
COPPER.
So far as is known our Copper lodes were first opened
iu 1858. Since then we have exported 79,131 tons 18 cwt.
of copper ingots, and 3,760 tons 4j cwt. of ore and regulus.
Total value to the end of 1887, £5,163,352.
The number of men engaged in and about our copper-
mines in 1887 was 553.
Our known cupriferous formations cover an area equal
to about 4,296,320 acres; but there are enormous tracts of
country the exploration of which will increase the area,
“pnie of the lodes at present in work are very large, and
tbc ores yield a high percentage of copper; but the low
Price of copper, coupled with the difficulties of transit
from the mines to the port, has had the effect of seriously
retarding the development of our copper lodes.
The most important copper-mine in the colony at the
Present time is the Great Cobar Mine, and it is the most
distant from the seaboard being 497 miles west of Sydney.
The quantity of ore already smelted at this mine is 80,820
tons, producing 10,987 tons of fine copper. In 1882, the
output of ore was 13,787 tons of ore, of which 11,702 tons
of ore were smelted, producing 1,805 tons of copper.
The lode occurs in Silurian slates; it varies in width
up to 100 feet. On the surface appear the outcrops of
two adjacent parallel lodes ; it is believed, however, that
all three form one lode, being only separated by pieces of
ground known to miners as “ horses.”
The ores consist of carbonates, metallic copper in films,
red oxide, and grey and yellow sulphides.
The oxidized ores are available in considerable quantity.*
At Nymagee, in the Cobar District, a large and valuable
copper lode is now being extensively worked. At the
Nymagee Company’s mine the output of ore in 1882 was
7,253 tons, 6,618 tons of which was smelted, producing 1,144
tons of fine copper. The lode traverses Silurian sandy
slate formation, striking N. 17° 30' W., and is nearly vertical.
The ores are remarkably free from injurious minerals.
In the same district, the Girilambone copper-mine,
situated 60 miles east of Cobar, has been opened, and
2,000 tons of ore was raised during 1882. This mine is
only mile from the proposed line of railway to Bourke.
Several other mines are being opened in the Cobar district.
About 90 miles south of Cobar is the Mount Hope cop-
per mine. The main lode is in ferruginous sandstones,
and is 24 feet on the surface : its strike is N. 7° 30' B.
The Bunaga copper mine, near Hockley, the Frogmore
copper mine, at Burrowa, and Peelwood copper mine, at
Tuena, produced considerable quantities of copper during
the year 1882.
Besides copper, gold and tin have been discovered in
the country lying between the Lachlan and Bogan Rivers,
which will doubtless become a most important mining
district.
Copper lodes have been opened, and more or less
worked, in years past, at Peelwood, Cow Flat, Wiseman’s
Creek, Thompson’s Creek, Carangara, Ophir, Cadia, Can-
oblas, Carcoar, Icely, Molong, Goodrich, Balara, Snowball,
Frogmore, and near Goulburn; the existence of other
lodes are known of in the Wellington, Murrumbidgee,
Bombala, Braidwood, Grafton and Albert districts.
Gold, silver, lead, zinc, and bismuth, are sometimes
found in the copper ores.
During the past year (1881) several rich copper lodes
have been discovered in the vicinity of Blayney, and close
to the Great Western Rail way-line.
Considering the extent of our copper-bearing country,
the progress liitherto made in copper-mining has not
been as great as could have been desired. The want of
success which has attended the attempts to develop our
copper lodes has, it is feared, in many cases, been due to
want of skill on the part of those engaged in the attempt;
but as our experience increases, and with the example of
some of our larger and better managed copper mines to
guide us, we may hope to improve upon the past.
The success which has attended the operations at some
of these mines during the past two years has evidently
had the effect of directing more attention to this branch
of mining; and if the new ventures be conducted with
skill and judgment, we may reasonably expect that our
output will be commensurate with the extent and value
of our deposits, and, as our railway system extends into
the interior, lodes which have hitherto been neglected on
account of the difficulties and expense of bringing the ore
or metal to the seaboard will be extensively and profitably
worked.
Tin, though discovered by the late Rev. W. B. Clarke,
as early as 1853,t was not worked till 1872. Since that
date we have exported 85,078 tons 6 cwt. ingots ; 16,480
ore and regulus; 291 tons 13 cwt. ore. Total value,
£7,927,876.
e Vide Report by the late Lamont Young, Geological
Surveyor, Annual Report of Department of Mines, 1880.
t The Rev. W. B. Clarke iu his report (dated 7th May,
1853) to the Honourable the Colonial Secretary, drew
attention for the first time to the probable occurrence of
extensive deposits of tin ore. He then stated that
« wolfram and oxide of tin, with tourmaline, occur near
Dundee and in Paradise Creek, and it is probable that
this ore of tin is plentifully distributed in the alluvia of
other tracts, as I have found it amidst the spineUe, rubies,
oriental emeralds, sapphires, and other gems of the detritus
from granite.” —Mines and Mineral Statistics, p. 71.


The number of miners employed in our tin mines in
1887 is estimated at 1,888, not including Chinese.
In addition to the alluvial deposits of tin ore there are
numerous valuable lodes, but the latter have not yet been
worked to any extent on account of the capital and skill
necessary for their proper development. The alluvial de-
posits first worked were found in beds of existing creeks,
but more recently tin ore has been found in large quan-
tities in beds of old rivers or creeks at depths varying
from a few feet to 150 feet. In some cases these deposits
are covered by basalt.
The extent, so far as known, of our stanniferous de-
posits is at least 6,440,000 acres ; but it will probably be
found more extensive than this, as Mr. H. Y. L. Brown,
Geological Surveyor, has recently discovered tin ore at
the “ Granite Diggings ” in the north-western portion of
the colony.
The tin-bearing localities hitherto worked are situated
about the high lands of the Great Dividing Range in the
N orthern and Southern Districts. Several lodes of Cas-
siterile have been opened, as at Tingha, Elsinore, New-
stead, The Gulf, Jingellic, &c.; they occur chiefly in
euritic and micaceous granites. But nearly all the ore
hitherto raised is stream tin obtained from the Tertiary
and Quarternary drifts, where these are composed of the
detritus from the stanniferous granites.
Gold, wolfram, metallic bismuth, and carbonate and
sulphide of bismuth are occasionally found with the tin
ore; sulphide of tin rarely. The concretionary variety
of tin oxide called “ Toad's-eye ” tin occurs in the Plio-
cene gold drifts at Grenfell.
IRON.
The existence of extensive deposits of rich iron ores at
Wallerawang, Lithgow, Mittagong, Mount Lambie, Berri-
ma, Illawarra, and in various other parts of the colony,
has been demonstrated —in many instances in the vicinity
of coal and lime in abundance ; but owing to the heavy
cost of erecting smelting and other works, and the diffi-
culty of securing the necessary skilled labour, very little
has yet been done towards developing this important
source of wealth.
In fact, with the exception of the Fitzroy Works at
Mittagong, which have been abandoned for some time
past, the only works in the colony are those of the Esk-
bank Iron Company at Lithgow Valley, which were
originated in 1875. These works consist of furnace
foundry and forge, and rolling mills; the two branches
are connected by a horse tramway. Most of the plant,
including a 24-ton fly-wheel, was made on the ground.
The blast furnace is capable of producing 100 tons of gray,
or 115 tons of white iron per week. Both pig and mal-
leable iron are made, and large quantities of rails for
tramways have been rolled. Upon this company’s pro-
perty are iron ore, coal, fireclay, and moulders’ sand.
Irregular masses and veins of magnetite with garnet
ironstone and some lodes of brown hasmatite occur in the
Devonian beds near Wallerawang, while interbedded with
the Coal Measures which extend from Wallerawang to
Bowenfells are several thin beds of rich clay-band iron
ore—a variety of haematite.
According to analysis made by Professor Liversidge,
the magnetite ore averages 40'87 per cent, of metallic
iron, the garnet ironstone 21 per cent, of iron, the brown
luematite 37-84 to 51-52 per cent, of iron, the clay bands
49-28 to 56 per cent, of iron.
The extensive deposit of brown haematite at Nattai is
a spring deposit formed at the junction of the Hawkesbury
and Wiauamatta formations. Iron ore, consisting of red
and brown haematite, occurs in the Hawkesbury rocks at
Mount Clarence in considerable quantity. A sample
analysed by Mr. C. Watt, Government Analyst, contained
55 per cent, of metallic iron. This ore is generally very
siliceous.
The large deposits of iron ore near Blayney are now
quarried for the Eskbank Smelting Works.
SILVER.
Valuable lodes have been found in various parts of the
colony, but none of them have been extensively worked
with the exception of those at Boorook, the discovery of
which is of comparatively recent date. The neglect of
these important deposits is mainly due to want of a
knowledge of the proper modes of treating the several
description of ores.
The lodes at Boorook are very numerous, and, so far
they have been worked, have yielded a large quanti
of silver in addition to, in some cases, a high percent*
of gold; but they have, with one exception, not be
worked to a greater depth than 80ft. or 90ft. The lod
vary in width from Ift. to 3ft. In the principal mine t
ore from the surface to a depth of 80ft. is chiefly chlori
of silver with a little iodide and argentiferous pyrites
below that depth blue or sulphide ores are chiefly m
with. The quantity of silver raised to the end of 18
is 2,923,037-62 ozs., valued at £612,886.
The Boorook lodes are situated in belts of felsp
porphyry, alternated with beds of fossiliferous shales
the Devonian formation.
Some extensive deposits have been opened at Thacks
inga and Umberamberka, near the Barrier Ranges, ai
at Broken Hill, Pinnacles, and Round Hill, near f
South Australian border, very large quantities of o
have been raised and treated.
Silver bearing lodes occur in the parishes of Yarral
pinni and Warrell, in the Macleay District. They s
found in both granite and Devonian shales, but chie
the latter; many of them present a favourable appei
anoe, being composed of several minerals, and havi:
much of the vesicular or porous character that is cc
sidered an encouraging indication by lode-miners. Quai
and arsenical pyrites predominate in their composite
while zinc-blende, iron pyrites, and galena, also occur.
The late Mr. Lament Young examined them a
considered them to be well worthy of being fnrtl
prospected.
Pyritous lodes yielding both silver and gold w(
worked for some time near Moruya.
The Sunny Corner Reef, at Mitchell’s Creek, whi
near the surface was so rich in gold, gradually ohang
in depth into argentiferous sulphides, from which lar
quantities of ore have been raised and treated.
Quartz reefs containing chloride of silver have recenl
been discovered near Denisontown; two samples tak
from near the surface gave on assay 98 and 143 oz.
silver per ton respectively.
Argentiferous lead lodes occur near Bathurst, at Hun
wood, Mylora, Good Hope, Peelwood, and in the Emm
ville, Tenterfteld, and Tuena districts, and in many otli
localities.
ANTIMONY.
Antimony ores have been found in numerous parts
the colony, the principal lodes occur in the Maclea
Armidale, Clarence, and Cudgegong Districts. Those c
the Munga Creek, near the Macleay River, traven
sedimentary rocks of Devonian age. The ore consists i
oxide and sulphide of antimony, and occurs in irreguli
bunches, occasionally of a considerable size, enclosed in
quartz matrix, which forms the chief constituent of tl
lodes.
One of the lodes near Armidale contains free go
plainly visible to the naked eye.
Until quite recently our antimony ores have been qui
neglected, but during the last two or three years some
the lodes have been worked, especially in the Made!
and Armidale districts, and there is reason to believe th
the output of this mineral will largely increase. Tl
quantity and value of antimony exported to the end
1887 was —metal, 473 tons 13J cwt.; ore and regulus, 3,1:
tons 15 cwt.; ore, 10J tons 9 cwt. Value, £67,239.
LEAD AND ZINC.
Ores of lead, especially of galena, which is often foul
argentiferous, are frequently met with in the gold-bearii
veins in the Silurian, Devonian, and granite form
tions. Sometimes the ores are contained in matrices
fluorspar and barytes. The lodes of galena which ha’
been opened have not as yet been worked with prof
When, however, this branch of raining receives mo:
attention on the part of miners it is probable that pa;
able lodes will be discovered.
Lead ores, chiefly galena, are found in the followil
and other localities: —Mount Grosvenor, Peel (nei
Bathurst), Glen Innes, Yass, Woolgarlo (near Yass
Mylora (near Yass), Darby’s Run (near Tingha), Broc
Creek, Gundaroo, Silverdale (near Bowning), Bookha
(in the County of Harden), Ravenswood, Wiseman
Creek, Murrumburrah, Canberra Plains, Winterton Mil
(at Mitchell’s Creek), Bungonia, Peelwood, Bombal
Barrier Ranges, Tuena, Tcnterfield and Emmaville.


Zinc-blende is also of frequent occurrence in the aurif-
•ous veins, but hitherto lias not been found in sufficient
aantity to pay for its extraction.
Chromite and Manganese.
Chromic iron, and manganese ores, have been found in
jnsiderable quantities, but cannot at present be proht-
tly worked, owing to the cost of carriage to the sea-
BISMUTH.
Bismuth ores have been found in the tin-bearing drifts,
and also in lodes at Silent Grove, The Gulf (in the Vege-
table Creek District), Glen Innes, Elsinore, Tenterfield,
and Adelong. Some of these will probably be worked if
a demand for bismuth arise. At Kingsgate, near Glen
Innes, a lode is reported to be 6 to 8 feet wide, from
which samples of metallic bismuth have been taken,
weighing from 1 to 2 lbs.
The quantity exported to the end of 1887 is 104 tons
15 cwt.; value, £20,675 14s.
Assays made by Mr. W. A. Dixon, F.C.S., gave as
follows From Tingha—waterworn nodules of carbonate
and oxide of bismuth, white to dark brown in colour,
contained bismuth 60‘43 per cent. From Tingha rolled
fragments, associated with talc and ferric oxide, con-
tained bismuth, 62-75 per cent.
Picked specimens of quartz, containing iron pyrites,
mispickel, and metallic bismuth, from a reef near Ade-
long, contained bismuth, 5-60 per cent.
A yellow, friable, ochreous mass of carbonate and oxide
of bismuth, with quartz and molybdic oxide, from Ten-
terfield, contained bismuth, 43'29 per cent., molybdenite,
6-60 per cent. , ... ~
Quartz, with metallic bismuth, carbonate of bismuth,
moiybdic oxide and sulphide from a reef 4 feet wide, near
Tenterfield, contained bismuth, 60-09 per cent.; gold, 1 oz.
4 dwt. 10 grs. per ton ; silver, 8 dwts. 10 grs. per ton.
Ore from near Glen Innes contained bismuth, 72 7 per
cent.; gold, 1 oz. 12J dwts. per ton, silver, 8 ozs. per ton.
Asbestos.
Asbestos in veins in serpentine is found in the Guu-
dagai and Bathurst Districts, but the veins have not been
much explored. The quantity exported to the end of
1887 is 25 tons 18 cwt., valued at £4BB.
Building Stones, Mahblbs, &c.
Sandstone, granite, flagging, marble limestone, slate,
fire-clay, and brick and pottery clays occur in abundance
in New South Wales. The city of Sydney is built upon
the Hawkesbury formation, which contains thick beds of
sandstone, affording stone of the finest quality for build-
ing purposes. It varies in colour from white to light
brown, and is extensively used in the erection of the
principal buildings in Sydney; it is also exported to the
adjacent colonies. The fine edifices for the Colonial
Secretary’s, Lands, and Postal Departments are built of
stone from the Pyrmont quarries ; and the whitish sand-
stone from the quarry at Mossman’s Bay, near Sydney,
has been employed in the erection of the Wilson Hall,
Melbourne University. Some of the sandstone is of very
suitable quality for grindstones. The granite used. m
Sydney is chiefly obtained from Moruya, but it is also
available near Goulburn and in other localities. 1 ery
durable sandstone flagging is quarried near Orange, Bur-
rowa, and Buckingbong. . .
Marble limestone of Siluro-Devoman age occurs m
masses of large extent near WaUerawang Bathurst
Marulan, Tamworth, Kempsey, &c. It takes a good
polish, and may be obtained in various colours-white,
black, grey, red, purple; it is chiefly used for decorative
purposes. Slates of good quality are quarried in the
Bathurst, Goulburn, and Gundagai Districts. Beds of
fire-clay are numerous in the Coal Measures, and the
Wianamatta shales afford excellent material for pottery
and brick purposes. There are large pottery, brick, and
fire-brick works in operation near Sydney and at Lithgow.
Gemstones.
These include the diamond, sapphire, oriental emerald,
emerald, ruby, opal, amethyst, garnet, chrysolite,
cairngorm, onyx, &c.,wliich have been found in the gold and
tin-bearing drifts and river gravels in numerous localities
throughout the colony. From the alluvial deposits in the
Bingera, Tingha, and Cudgegong Districts, at least 10,000
diamonds are stated to have been found; the largest
weighed about 5| carats. It is believed that with Proper
appliances for saving diamonds these drifts might be
profitably worked.

Cities
(4 ) To mineral lauds for the purpose of searching for
minerals in virtue of mineral licenses, each of winch
costs £1 per annum, and entitles the holder to occupy
40 acres of land. The title rests solely upon posses-
sion, continuous work, and the maintenance of proper
and well "defined boundary marks. Within thirty
days after the discovery of the mineral sought for in
payable quantity, the holding has to be converted
into a mineral lease. The process being as described
in clause (3.) The maximum area to be occupied in
one block for the purpose of searching for minerals
is as follows: —For coal and shale, 640 acres ; for
other minerals, 80 acres. . . . ,
In addition to the foregoing methods of acquiring land
for mining purposes, Crown mineral land may be condi-
tionally purchased under the provisions of the Land Acts,
upon application to the Land Agent of the district on
any Thursday, and depositing 26 per cent, of the purchase
money, namely, 10s. per acre. The conditions being that
not less than £2 per acre be expended m mme works
upon the laud during the first three years. After that
expenditure, the balance of the purcliase money, 30s. per
acre can be paid, and the title to the land, including all
minerals except gold, thereby secured. .
In making application to lease land (gohlor ™uiera)
for mining purposes, the applicant proposes the time for
commencing work and the number of men to be em-
ployed and the Minister either accepts the proposal or
requiras the applicant to vary it. The proposal, wnen
agreed to by the Minister, is embodied in the lease.
‘ f On newly discovered gold-fields or deposits,
to lease are required to proceed to work forthwith after
taking possession. This is intended to prevent the lock-
ing-up of land without work at new rushes.
All titles to mining lands under the Mining Act com-
mence with possession, which is taken by the erection oi
a post 3 inches in diameter and projecting 3 feet above
the surface and the cutting of an L trench 9 inches deep
and 6 feet long at each angle of the parcel of land.
Titles are made as follows : , . , ,
(1.) To claims for gold-mining in virtue of miners rights
which are issued to the applicant at 10s. per annum.
The process after possession being the posting of
notices and application to the local Mining Kegistrar
for registration in terms of the Mining Board Regu-
lations. In certain cases survey is necessary, and the
fee therefor has to be paid by the applicant.
(2.) To lease for gold-mining in virtue of minors’ rights,
the maximum area being 25 acres. The process after
possession is to erect a notice-board on the laud, post
notices on the local offices, and within ten days, and
not less than three clear days, to lodge with the
Warden of the district, or the Warden s Clerk of the
division, an application in the prescribed form for a
lease. With the application one year's rent at the
rate of £1 per acre and the survey fee have to be
deposited.
(3.) To lease mineral lands: The maximum area being,
for coal or shale, 640 acres ; for minerals other than
gold, coal, or shale, 80 acres. The process after pos-
session being the same as in the case of gold leases,
except that if the land to be leased is not within a
Mining District, the application has to be lodged
with the Land Agent of the district. The year’s rent
to be deposited with the application is at the rate of
ss. per acre, and the fee for survey has also to be
deposited.

(From Official Sources .)
is an historical record that on the 27th September,
325, an enthusiastic gathering witnessed the opening
f the first equipped railway in the United Kingdom
fact in the world. The new system had many
Bculties to contend against, and much prejudiced,
not fanatical, opposition to overcome, the people
having no idea of the rapid and wonderful change in the
world’s improvement the steam engine was to bring. As
Dr. llackay well sings:—
“Blessings on science and her handmaid, steam.
They make Utopia only half a dream,
And show the fervent of capacious souls
Who watch the ball of progress as it rolls,
That all as yet completed or begun,
Is but the dawning that precedes the sun.’
The colony of New South Wales at that time was a
■iistant and neglected part of the empire, containing a
population of 33,675, and it was not thought to be open
io much possibility of greatness. The coast lands were
known to be fertile, but beyond the barrier of the Divid-
Range, the land was fit only, it was considered, for a
population, and suitable for pastoral industry
Lachlan Macquarie, in many respects one of our
West Governors, had visited the inland districts, and ns
f result of his visit had written to the Secretary of
ite for the Colonies a few years before railways were
meed in England, that the difficulties which pre-
<uted themselves in the journey from Sydney were so
great and inevitable, that nothing could be looked for-
fard to beyond the country supporting an isolated popu-
by pastoral pursuits ; while Mr. Oxley, one of our
earliest surveyors, stated that the country was uninhabit-
able, and useless for all purposes of civilised man. It is
hardly necessary to say that these districts now support
a large and rapidly growing population, that railways
Hu through them, and that they possess some of our
Host thriving towns. But, at the time we speak of, none
°t the possibilities of communication and advancement
I pened up by the locomotive, were known, and the country
oe.vond the mountains was written of as the unexplored
interior.
English advancement and improvement were slow in
the colony at this time, and until the discovery
°f gold poured population into Australia, and gave life
a,l| i movement to its various parts, the improvement in
social and material things was very little. About the
of the gold discovery, however, railways were com-
menced in the principal cities, although it may be men-
tioned the idea had birth shortly before the gold was
found, and, by a happy coincidence, the first line was
°l>eued on the anniversary of the opening of railway
communication in England, viz., the 27th September
(b «t 30 years later), 1855. From that time the railways
i'ave gone on increasing with more or less rapid strides,
Ull til to-day we have a total length of 2,048 miles, of
"inch 2,003 miles are controlled by the Government, and
lsi 'l down on the English standard guage of 4ft. BJin., and
43 miles operated by a private comi any (Deniliquiu and
Scania), laid down to a guage of sft. 3in.
The progress and importance of a colony may well be
Wged by the length of its railways in regard to
filiation, and viewed in this way the colony of
New South Wales stands out strongly in favorable
comparison with other countries. It has a population,
speaking generally, of 1,000,000 people, or to be more
exacS 1,001,966, which divided by our railway mileage,
gives one mile of line for every 518 persons. In Great
Britain there arc 1,895 persons to each mile of line; in
France, 2,110 ; in Germany, 2,066 ; in the United States,
where they have done more in regard to railway enter-
prise than any other country in the world, one mile to
every 416 persons; in the adjoining colony of Victoria
there is one mile to every 544 persons. It is thought by
some who are well able to give an opinion in the matter,
that as we have completed our trunk lines and given
facilities for direct communication to most of our inland
districts, the colony should now seek to make those lines
which will be most profitable as feeders to the main rail-
ways, and at the same time desist from increasing the
mileage more than proportionately to the increase in
population—that is to say, that the colony should maintain
the relative proportion per mile of line to population that
the railways now bear. During the last 10 years the in-
crease in population has been 387,785, equal to 60 per
cent., and although the number fluctuates, still the per-
centage of increase may be taken as a fair basis of compari-
son, and it may reasonably be assumed that a similar in-
crease will be maintained in the coming lOyears. On that
basis, therefore, we can provide for an additional length
of 1,200 miles of new lines in the next 10 years, or an
average increase of 120 miles per annum.
Parliament has already approved, conditionally, of the
construction of 1,450 miles of line, as follows : —City Ex-
tension, Tarago to Braidwood, Gundagai to Tumut, Goul-
bum to Crookwell, Galong to Burrowa, Wagga to Tum-
berumba, Culcairn to Corowa, Kiama to Jervis Bay, Bega
to Eden, Perth to Eockley, Forbes to Wilcannia, Nyngan
to Cobar, Orange to Forbes, Musclebrook to Cassilis, Glen
Innes to Invcrell, Grafton to Glen Innes, Grafton to
the Tweed, Narrabri to Moree, and it is like'y that future
extensions will in some directions, at least, follow the line -
already considered. It is, however, satisfactory to know
that no line will be constructed without the amplest con-
sideration, as in the new Railway Bill, which is now before
Parliament, and which is unanimously approved by the
community, the provision is made that the Railway Com-
missioners—who are in a large measure independent—
shall make reports for the guidance of Parliament as to
the probable traffic to be derived from any new line that
may be proposed. The lines, moreover, wlieu approved,
are to be carried out under the direction of a proper and
capable Public Works Board. It may not be out of place
to say a few words with regard to the necessity of rail-
way extension, and the direction in which it might most
profitably be carried out. Although we have most fer-
tile areas, and magnificent resources, they have in many
instances remained uncultivated, owing to the want of
cheap and rapid means of communication with the sea-
board or other markets. In one respect, Sydney—the me-
tropolis of the colony, and containing nearly one-third of
the population —is peculiarly situated with regard to her
agricultural areas. There is, it is true, a large area of
available land between the coast and the mountains, on
which maize and oats and lucerne, and fruits flourish


exceedingly, but wheat, the great staple of life, does
not grow kindly. Once the mountain range is
passed, however, agricultural country is reached, where
wheat is grown to advantage, heavier average yields
being obtained than in either of the adjoining colonies.
The cost and difficulty of carriage have been a severe
handicap to farmers who live any distance from the j
markets, and a large quantity of breadstuff is imported i
annually from the other colonies. It would be a mani- |
fest advantage, therefore, to have our railways extended) j
in the first instance, to those wheat growing districts j
which are nearest Sydney. It is laid down, as a rule, that j
wheat growing cannot be carried on profitably where a j
road carriage of 20 miles to reach the railway, has to be
borne, and proposals have already been made for lines j
within an easy distances of Sydney, that will tap some of j
the finest agricultural land in the colony. The advan- j
tages of such lines would be three-fold. In the first place |
they would settle population on the soil, An agricultural i
district will employ 20 families where the pastoral in- j
dustry require one only. They will enable us to purchase j
our breadstuffs from our own people, and, further, such j
lines would prove remunerative to the State from a com-
mercial pomt of view.
It has not been the practice, however, to look to our
railways simply from a commercial standpoint, although
to a certain extent they have been a commercial success.
In a young country the construction of railways, in a
reasonable degree, is a positive advantage to the com-
munity, as they open up fresh markets, allow the
interchange of natural commodities, and accelerate the
development and settlement of new districts. The pre-
sent Minister for Works, Mr. Sutherland, when opening
the railway to the important town of Wagga Wagga, in
Riverina, estimated that the saving to the people by the
introduction of a railway was equal to three times its
gross earnings, and one of the ablest English railway
authorities, Sir Wm. Allport, has said“ I venture to
assert that the reduction in carriage by the railways, as
compared with former charges and quantity carried, has
effected a saving to the country of an amount equal to
more than double the entire gross receipts on all the
railways of the kingdom.”
On such a basis the saving to the people of the colony
by the railways, during the past year, has been nearly
£5,000,000 sterling. In this colony the facilities for in-
ter-communication mean more than they do in most
countries, for while one year a certain district may be
suffering from drought, another is flourishing, and the
railway enables the owners of stock to remove from
affected land to localities where pasturage is abundant.
The want of railways in previous years has caused, in
times of drought, the loss of immense numbers of stock,
and the colony has consequently suffered the loss repre-
sented by the value of the animals, which under other
circumstances might have been saved.
So far the colony has not been behindhand in its rail-
way system. It has moved faster, proportionately, than
almost any other country, and owing to its exceptional
position, and want of natural water-ways, the progress
has been justified, but it is considered by many the time
has come for the colony to “ bank its fires,” and move in
future proportionately to the increase in our population.
We have country already opened up, capable of support-
ing millions of people, and in future it would be well to
look to those places which, while rich in resources,
are comparatively undeveloped for want of communica-
tion, ratherthan to extend the line to localities possessing
means of communication, such, for instance, as our coast
districts, where, although the harbors are not perfect, yet,
with few exceptions, gateways open into every important
river district along the coast, ana steamers of varying ton-
nage can enter. A railway service, costly as it would neces-
sarily be by the extensive bridges, &c., that would have
to be made, could not compete with the water carriage.
There are, however, a few instances which on account of
exceptional circumstances, may not come under this
notice, such as the country lying between the Richmond
(which is fairly open as a port) and the Queensland
border, one of the richest tracts of country in the colony
—perhaps in the world—which is without easy access,
and has remained to a large extent undeveloped.
So much has been said on the future of the railways, a
little may be said on the past. We opened our first line
on the 27th September, 1855, and for a time progress was
slow. Ten years after there were only 143 miles opened,
and the earnings amounted to £147,653, equal to 1| pet
cent, on the capital expended. The next ten years saw
a slight improvement, the mileage at the end of that
term being 403, and the average interest on capital 2J
per cent., but in the last ten years the advancement has
been more rapid, the mileage (Government lines) actually
opened was 1,486, and the average interest paid on the
capital expended for the ten years was over 4 per cent.
Although the earnings for the past year were not equal
to the average, being about 3 per cent only, exceptional
and unfavorable causes existed. During last year the full
force of the disastrous drought which visited the colony,
affected the returns, added to which there was consider-
able disturbance of trade, consequent upon the uncer-
tainty which prevailed regarding the land laws and fiscal
policy, and in addition there was a large increase in the
capital expenditure caused by the rapid extension of new
lines. It cannot, of course, be expected that new lines will
immediately return an income equal to the interest. In
older countries railway authorities allow seven years for a
railway to develop a paying traffic, and here, although
immense natural resources are at command, it must be
apparent that in an entirely new country, it should take
even longer for the hand of enterprise to bring the dor-
mant riches into active life, and so create a remunerative
traffic for the railway. Had it not been for the loss in-
curred in working the comparatively new extensions,
the earnings last year, calculated from the published
statements, even with the drought and disturbance to
trade, would have been equal to 4 per cent, on the capital
expended. On the oldest constructed section the return
was nearly 8 per cent.
It is not necessary to enter into the details of the
traffic carried over the lines, as this information is giren
in the comparative statement of the traffic in the various
colonies. But, apart from the value the railways have
been as carriers of goods and produce, and in this colony
the most reasonable rates are quoted for the carriage of
goods, and from them railways derive the largest portion
of its revenue, the railways are of great value in facili-
tating the movement of the people, in saving the timed
the business man, in allowing the country people to come
to the metropolis, and in enabling the city residents to
take advantage of the mountain scenery and the change
of climate afforded by a trip to the highlands. The me-
tropolitan residents are particularly happy in their situ-
ation in regard to natural advantages, as in a couple of
hours run the railway will bring them to the mountain
heights, where they can enjoy in the warmest summer
months, a clear and bracing climate, and view some of
nature's greatest wonders, while along the sea-coast they
can be transported by rail to districts that vie with the
watering places of any other country. In addition, the
railways will prove of great advantage should at any
time the colony have to resist the invasion of a hostile
power. Their value in this particular has been tested hy
the movement of our present men of arms when engage®
in sham warfare, and as most of the principal towns, 9 s
well as the four principal colonies, are connected by rail-
way, a large force could at any time be quickly concen-
trated at any;given spot to oppose a menacing foe.
The. question of railway construction is one of interest
to both the colonists and the English people. The rail-
ways are the property of the people, and are a better asset
than the liability incurred in constructing them. The
English people have an interest in their transactions, a*
the money expended on these national works has been
borrowed principally from them. It must be remembered
that the national debt of the colony is represented by i®
public works, and it must be satisfactory to the investors
to know that these public works are at once opening
up the country and developing its resources, at the
same time improving their own value, and giving a betW r
security for the money advanced. Time after time we he» r
that the colonies are over-borrowing—perhaps it is n ot
said so much of New South Wales, as its securities
rally occupy the first place in the stock market —but i*
need only be pointed out that New South Wales has n®
encumberance of debt, and no taxation to meet such
debt. The money borrowed has been wisely invested)
both from a commercial and a political standpoint, and th*
investments, while doing incalculable good to the coun-
try, have proved of late years financially successful.

TOURIST’S INFORMATION,
IN the Gazetteer, on pages 82 to 92 and at pages 97 to 99,
will be found the names of the various stations in the
New South Wales Railway System, together with the
distances from terminal stations, the heights of the
stations above sea level, and the fares. Single and return
tickets are issued daily, but at certain times tickets known
as holiday excursion are issued.
Return Tickets are issued at any time, available
for return, as follows :
For distances not exceeding 15 miles—on day of issue.
For distances over 15 and not exceeding 25 miles —
following day. Those Issued on Saturdays to be avail-
able till following Monday.
For distances over 25 and not exceeding 50 miles—
within one week from date of issue.
For distances exceeding 50 but not 300 miles—within
one calendar month from date of issue.
For 300 miles and upwards—within two months from
date of issue.
In order to allow the city residents and others to
obtain the benefits to be derived from a trip to the
mountain regions, special facilities are afforded by the
running of convenient trains and the issue of cheap
return tickets, which are available for return for a
lengthened period as follows:
Excursions to the Tourist Districts.—Holiday
Excursion Tickets for these districts are issued at all
stations every day (Sundays excepted) by all trains,
available for return for two months from date of issue.
For the purpose of this regulation the Tourist Districts
are limited to places between Picton and Moss Vale
(inclusive) on the Southland Emu Plains and Bowenfels
(inclusive) on the West, and Walcha Road and Tenterfield
on the North.
Special Excursion Tickets, at 2d. per mile first
class, and Id. per mile second class, are issued by the
Saturday morning down Excursion trains at all stations
between Sydney and Campbelltown and Sydney and
Emu Plains inclusive, to stations beyond these points;
and similar tickets are issued by the Saturday afternoon
down Excursion trains to all stations at which the trains
are timed to call south of Fairfield and west of Parra-
matta. These tickets are available for return by Excur-
sion trains on the same day, or by the Monday morning
Excursion trains within ten days. Family tickets at
a reduction of 10 per cent, on the Excursion fares, when
three full fares are taken, are also issued. The advantages
thus offered are largely availed of, and the Saturday
Excursion trains are invariably well filled with passengers
journeying to the many happy retreats in the mountains,
of which the following may be specially mentioned as
being particularly worthy of a visit.
1. Penrith and the River Nepean.—The river is a
splendid sheet of fresh water, and it will be remembered
as the place where the race for the world’s aquatic
championship between Beach and Hanlan took place.
The views of river scenery here are unrivalled, and
12 miles from Penrith, near where the Warragamba
Hows into the Nepean, the basin, an immense natural
bath, is reached. The depth of the water in it has never
yet been ascertained. A writer says “It would be diffi-
cult to conceive scenery more beautiful than that which
characterises the junction of the Nepean with the Warra-
pamba. The Blue Mountains close in upon the rivers,
while the latter winds round about all the points and
corners as though loathe to leave places so pleasant.”
2. Glenwood, The Valley, Springwood, &c.— In the
journey the route passes over what is known as the
“ First Zigzag” where the ascent of the Blue Mountains
is really commenced, the train climbing the mountain
side on a gradient of lin 30. The outlook from the top
of the Zigzag is one of unrivalled beauty, taking in the
Emu Plains and a long stretch of a fertile verdant valley,
through which the Nepean, like a silver streak, runs. In
the vicinity of the stations named, the mountain views
are varied and picturesque, and the tourist can find
much to enjoy in the beautiful valleys that run down
from the narrow and comparatively level track along
which the railway is made. It is written of the
mountains here (Mr. Tingle), “ We have said that this is
a remarkable district, and justly so, because for magnifi-
cence of scenery, wealth of mineral resources, and
monuments of engineering skill, it is probably without a
rival in the southern hemisphere. The Blue Mountains,
with their innumerable hills and ravines, present exten-
sive panoramas of the grandest description. As the
traveller in the railway is sped along the summit of the
range, and catches glimpses of the thousand valleys
stretching like ocean waves to the horizon, on both sides
of the line (which for a considerable distance is laid
on a narrow causeway that looks as if built up for
thousands of feet out of awful depths of precipice and
ravine), he finds it difficult to imagine a nobler represen-
tation of the grandeur and sublimity of nature.”
At Lawson (58 miles from Sydney) there are many
views of great beauty and interest within comparatively
a short distance of the railway line. The place is well
provided with comfortable cottage homes, and is much
resorted to by invalids, who can, without fatigue, enjoy
the mountain scenery and have the benefit of the pure
mountain air. The principal waterfalls here are known
as Dante’s Glen, the Adelina Falls and the Junction
Falls. Four miles from Lawson are the well known
Wentworth or the Weatherboard Falls, which have been
well described by the late Dr. Lang.
“ At the point where the rivulet from the Weatherboard
hut discharges itself there is a break or bay in the line of
cliffs on that side, as if a vast portion of the wall of rock
had been quarried out for the purpose, the two points
appearing from behind like two lofty headlands jutting
out into the valley, and bearing a remarkable re-
semblance to the Heads of Port Jackson. The rivulet,
which in its course of two miles and a-half has been
swelled by one or two smaller streams issuing from
lateral valleys to the size of a common mill-stream,
precipitates itself all at once over the rocks at the head
of the bay and is lost in the abyss, the fall being at least
1.000 feet. On gaining the edge of the precipice the
waters of the rivulet seem to shrink instinctively from
the frightful leap to which they have been conducted
in their course down the valley, each individual drop
appearing endowed with separate volition, and seeming
determined to shift for itself, and the whole mass of
fluid resolving itself into what appears like innumerable
particles of frozen snow. Many hundred feet below, the
tops of apparently lofty trees are seen at the bottom
of Prince Regent’s Glen, and so completely do the cyclo-
pean walls of rock which form the glen defy all direct
communication between the heights and the hollow, that
the shortest practical route from the place where the
rivulet leaps over the precipice to the bottom of the
cliffs, over which it falls, is 16 miles. Governor Mac-
quarie named the waterfall the Campbell Cataract, in
honor of the Colonial Secretary of that period. A*
the time w r e visited the fall there was a strong wind
blowing up the glen. The wind caught the falling
waters before they had time to reach the bottom, and
scattered them into mist, carrying them to great
distances. The sun’s rays falling on the particles pro-
duced the phenomena of innumerable rainbows, the
effect of the whole scene being indescribably beautiful.”
At Katoomba (66 miles) there are innumerable pretty
views, waterfalls, cascades and glens, and here the
nearest coal mine on the mountains to the metropolis
is at work. Katoomba, with Mount Victoria, are the
principal resorts for travellers doing the western
mountains, and at both places excellent hotel accommo-
dation is obtainable, two of the largest hotels in the
colony being found here. ..
At Blackheath is the well known “Govett’s Leap,
which is said to be the deepest chasm with perpendicular
cliffs hi the known world. “It is almost surrounded with
these cliffs, which are believed to be nowhere less than
3.000 feet above the level of the sea. The full sublimity
and majestic grandeur of the scene is not realized at
a first glance. After contemplating it for a time the
mind becomes filled with awe and wonder as it vainly
strives to comprehend
. The vast immeasurable abyss
Outrageous as a sea, dark, wasteful, wild.”
The trees in the valley below, although one or two
hundred feet high, or perhaps more, are undistinguishable
in their individuality. Standing on the abrupt pre-
cipitous wall one cannot help feeling a strong desire
to reach the depths of the gorge. But the closerouo seeks
for a spot at which a descent can be made, the more certain
does it appear that such an object is unattainable.”
Mount Victoria again juesents a plethora of beautiful
views, ami days can be spent in visiting the various
sights, while the change enjoyed—the mountain is 3,509
feet above sea level—is one that is at all times found
beneficial. From this station one road leads to the

famous Fish River Caves, among the grandest of the
natural wonders in Australia. A second road to them
starts from Tarana, a station distant 60 miles further
on. The Fish River Caves are of vast extent and
singularly attractive, having a great variety of very
intricate galleries or passages, only to be traversed
safely under the care of the experienced local guide
employed by the Government. The subterraneous
scenes herein disclosed are indeed magnificent—well
worth the time and trouble of paying them a visit.
There is a whole group of these grand subterraneous
halls and bewildering galleries, and each one of the
series is known by a different name: the New Cave,
Lucas Cave, the Bell Cave, the Lurline Cave, the
Imperial Cave, the Elder-tree Cave, &c. Several objects
of great interest are to be viewed at and in the Fish
River Caves ; and amongst these are the Great Arch-
way, the Carlotta Arch, the Meeting of the Creeks,
the Binnacle Rock, the interiors, the outside entrances,
the waterfall, and adjacent woodland scenes. The
Carlotta Arch —a curious natural archway in the rocks —
excites much astonishment and admiration. These
oaves, so remarkable for their stalactitic and stalagmitio
formations, are of such an immense extent that whole
days are necessary for their due exploration.
Between Mount Victoria and Lithgow, on the railway,
the train passes over the wonderful Lithgow Zigzag,
pronounced to be one of the most wonderful engineering
works of its kind in the world. The train, by a series
of zigzags passing down the side of the mountain range to
enter the head of the Lithgow Valley. The fall from the
top of the range to the valley is about 700 feet. Lithgow is
an important industrial centre; large quantities of coal
are raised from the mines here, while ironworks, smelt-
ing-works, fireclay, potteryware, and other manufac-
tures are in progress. Of Lithgow it is said, “In no
place out of Sydney, within the colony, is there to
be found greater evidence of progress in the past and
solid prosperity in the future than in the little thriving
town of Lithgow—or Lithgow, Eskbank and the Vale of
Chvydd, for the three are in reality one —situated just the
other side of the Blue Mountains, and within easy reach
of Sydney by means of the Great Western Railway. As
in the instance of the wonderful results which followed
the rubbing of the lamp whose virtues are told in Eastern
story, the wild solitudes of the mountains have in a mar-
vellously short space of time answered the call of
Australian enterprise, and what no longer back than
eight years ago was almost untouched bush, boasting but
one or two inhabitants, is to-day a busy,manufacturing
community, who are solving some of the most important
problems connected with industrial pursuits in New
South Wales. Bountifully supplied as the locality is with
rich desposits of minerals and clays, and well provided as
it is with means of communication by which markets in
various directions can be found, the land lay for some
time uninterfered with, and then, its great value suddenly
becoming better known and understood, a mania to
possess it seized upon various persons, and it was speedily
taken up, principally under lease.”
Beyond Lithgow the railway westward stretches out
into great plains which run far into the heart of Australia,
end the broad acres give unlimited room for the millions
of sheep that are depastured thereon. The pastoral
industry is principally followed inland, but in many
places agriculture has been taken up, the fertile soil
(living most promising results. Again, the land teems
With mineral wealth, principally geld, silver and copper,
and attracts thousands in search of the hidden treasure.
The principal towns along the railway, westward, are
Mudgee, Bathurst, Orange, Dubbo and Bourke.
The Southern Railway again offers, within a short
distance of Sydney, many favorite places for tourists.
In the vicinity of the mountain stations are views of glen
a nd waterfall that surpass, at times, the famous views on
Ike Western Railway, and the localities only require to
be as well known to be as highly appreciated ; and,
further, while the western mountain line is for the most
Pwt barren, the southern line passes through a very
fertile region. Mittagong and Bowral possess a pleasant
taountain air, and are rich in beautiful scenery. Moss Vale
is the country seat of the Governor, and in its vicinity
,we the finest waterfalls—the Pitzroy—in the Colony.
Between the Southern Railway and the Coast (a direct road
connects the two), the land is broken by many valleys, and
the views to be had are beautiful in the extreme, while the
country is in parts of the most beautiful character.
One hundred and thirty-four miles from Sydney lies the
city of Goulburn, and from it a branch line runs to what
may be termed the lake district of New South Wales, as
here are found two splendid inland lakes, viz., Bathurst
and George; the latter is described as “being situated on
the very crown of a plateau more than 2,000 feet above
the level of the sea, and surrounded by mountains, some
of them rising nearly as high above its waters as they are
above the ocean. Lake George is 20 miles long, with an
average width of 7 miles. It is a perfect sea in miniature,
as it has bays and headlands, sandy beaches, rocky pro-
jections, and sheltered vales, upon whose pebbly strands
the waters roll when the wind ruffles, and by which they
flow quietly when the elements are still. Many pleasant
homes are to be found in its neighborhood, chiefly
towards the village of Bungendore, not far from
Collector, a settlement about two miles above the
highest point of the lake. On either side, that is to say
on the cast and west, mountains run up from the edge of
the water, and, increasing in height as they recede inland,
at length tower up as though intended to prevent in-
trusion from the outer world. All the scenery around is
of an exceedingly interesting character, and the far-off
cloud-capped towers covered with snow give an additional
interest to the scene. Lake Bathurst, a sheet of water
similar in character but scarcely half the size of Lake
George, is situated on the east side of the dividing range,
and about a dozen miles away.” Wild fowl of every
description are plentiful on Lake George, and its waters
teem with fish, so that this place is a favorite ground of
sportsmen.
The Southern Line forms the passage between Victoria
and New South Wales, the railways connecting at Albury.
From Goulburn outward the line runs through a district
extensively used for agriculture. The principal towns
are Tass, Wagga and Albury, and on the south-west
branch Narrandera and Hay. The Northern Line now
starts from Newcastle, the great coal port of the Colony,
from which upwards of one and a-half million tons of
coal are annually shipped. The line runs through the
valley of the Hunter River, which is a veritable land
flowing with milk and honey. Corn and the vine flourish
luxuriously, and the district is well settled, possessing the
important towns of Maitland, Morpeth, Singleton,
Murruruudi, &c.; at the latter place the railway leaves
the valley and climbs the Liverpool Ranges, and after-
wards the New England tableland. The land throughout
is fertile, while the views are ever changing and interest-
ing, the line reaching the great height of 4,500 feet above
sea level; the air in this hilly region in the hottest
summer being cool and bracing. Owing to the comparative
isolation of the Northern Line, tourists from Sydney and
visitors have not yet made their way there in numbers,
but as its many beauties are better known, visitors to the
northern coalfields, the fertile valley of the Hunter with
its vineyards, the mountain scenery among the Liverpool
Ranges, the pure cool atmosphere of New England and
its English fruits and productions, will increase more and
more every year.
In addition to the facilities afforded by the issue of
cheap tickets before referred to, excursionists, if in
sufficient numbers, can take special trains under low
rates. For 25 passengers a special train can be had for
10s. per mile, including return, minimum charge, £7 10s.;
or a number of carriages at the rate of 2s. or 3s. per mile,
per carriage, including return.
Regular travellers are allowed to take out season
tickets, the price of which, for a distance of 34 miles,
would be as follows (Ist class): —

Quarterly Tickets at a reduction of 16 per cent, off
monthly rates; half-yearly, 10 per cent, off quarterly
rates ; yearly, 5 per cent, oil half-yearly rates.
Children under 16 years of age, half-fares. Children
(school pupils), quarter-fares, in 2nd class only.
School Pupils Tickets are limited to one journey each
way daily.
Lady members of a family are allowed tickets at .half
these rates.
The overland passenger .traffic between Melbourne and
Sydney is provided for by the running of two trains each
way daily, an express and ordinary mail, the former doing
the journey in about 19 hours. The fares charged are
£6 Is. 6d. first class return, and 2nd class, £4 11s. At
excursion times the rates are reduced to £5 6s. 6d. and
£4 Is. respectively. The trains are provided with
sleeping-cars.
In regard to the carriage of goods, the rates are as
reasonable as the charges in any part of the world. The
goods are divided into classes, according to the practice
observed by all railway managers, the rates for the
various classes, for specified distances, are as follows,
intermediate distances being charged proportionate
rates:—
The above rates are general, but the competition for
the Riverina trade between Victorian and New South
Wales Railways has caused both departments to adopt
differential rates. In New South Wales the maximum
rates for any class of down traffic from Sydney to stations
distant over 305 miles on Southern and 340 miles on
South-western lines is £5 10s. per ton, or if in truck loads
not exceeding 6 tons, the maximum charge will be : Cor-
rugated iron and fencing wire, £lB per truck; other
goods, £2O per truck.
A reduction of 20 per cent, is allowed on Ist and 2nd
class down traffic from Sydney to stations on Southern
and South-western lines, distant over 340 miles, but no
further abatement is made on rates reduced under
clause 1. A reduction is also made generally when goods
under miscellaneous and special classes are carried in
truck loads, such reduction being equal to about 16 per
cent, on the rate per ton on produce carried 400 miles.

TRAMWAYS.
The tramway initiated in 1879 to afford communication
from Redfern Station to the Sydney International Exhi-
bition, was found to be so great a convenience that the
public agitated for the extension of the system to the
whole of the suburbs not provided with railway facili-
ties, with the result that the following places are
now connected with the City by tramways, which
all terminate at the head of Bridge-street:—Botany,
Bondi, Coogee, Crown-street (Surry Hills), Forest Lodge,
Glebe Point, Leichhardt, Marrickville, Newtown, Rail-
way Station, Randwick, Waverley, Woollahra, and Water-
loo, the total mileage being 28 miles. North Shore
opened since, from the Ferry to the Reserve.
To show the extent of the traffic, it may not be out of
place to say that the average daily number of trams run
is about 1,000, and that, during 1886, no less than
52,569,985 fares were collected.
The extension of the tramway system has had the
effect of opening up outlying suburbs, locating the popu-
lation outside the City, and generally advancing in value
suburban land, as well as increasing the prosperity of the
various outlying boroughs.
The lines are worked by steam motors, which, owing
to the gradients and centralized nature of the traffic, is
considered the most suitable traction power.
The engines employed are of the Baldwin Co.’s manu-
facture, and weigh from eight to thirteen tons each, with
outside cylinders and wheels, and four and six wheels,
four coupled, and pony truck with two wheels.
The cars are principally what are known as “ double-
decked ” cars, that is, having in each case an upper and
a lower deck. The carrying capacity varies as the size of
the cars, but on an average the smallest type can seat 60
and the largest 90 persons.
Cash and ticket fares are taken by the conductors,
payment being usually made by ticket.
The permanent way is generally steel, the rails weigh-
ing 42 lb. to the yard ; the formation between the rails
being principally concrete, although in one or two places,
where an exceptionally heavy vehicular traffic passes
over the street through which the tram runs, the forma-
tion is wooden blocks.
In keeping with the traffic, there is annually a large
revenue derived therefrom. For 1886, the revenue re-
ceived was £226,367, while, for the same period, the
working expenses, in consequence of heavy renewals and
locomotive expenses, were £201,737, leaving a net profit
of £24,630. Up to the end of the year mentioned, the
capital expended aggregated £742,113.

members are chosen to serve on Select Committees, and

interval between the prorogation and next session.
Under the Act the Committee has power to summon the
attendance of witnesses, to examine them on oath, to
require the production of all papers, &c. relating to the
matter before them, to enter and inspect any laud, build-
ing, place, or material, on giving due notice, and to fine
or commit to prison any person guilty of any mis-
behaviour or contempt in relation to business before the
Committee.
The functions of the Committee are defined by section
12 of the Act, as follows :—“ The Committee shall con-
sider and report upon all public works (except fortifica-
tions and works connected with the military or naval
defence of the colony) in all cases where the estimated
cost of completing such work exceeds £20,000; and
where such work purports to be of a reproductive or
revenue producing character, they shall have regard to
the amount of revenue which such work may reasonably
be expected to produce, and to the present and pros-
pective public value of such work.
Before the commencement of each session of Parliament
the Committee must make a report to the Governor of
their proceedings under the Act, and such report must
be laid before Parliament within 14 days afterwards.

Sydney Branch of the Royal Mint.
(MacquaHe-street.)
The Sydney Branch of the Royal Mint was opened on the
14th May, 1855, under the immediate control of H.M.’s
Treasury, and is supported by a special appropriation
of a sum not exceeding £15,000 a year. The coins struck
are sovereigns and half-sovereigns, and are a legal tender
the United Kingdom, and identical in every respect
with those issued from the Royal Mint in London, with the
exception of a small S, which is added as a distinguishing
mark. New silver and bronze coins from the London
Mint are supplied to the Sydney Branch for distribution
in the Colony, the charges for transit being defrayed by
the Imperial Government; and worn silver coin is received
and exchanged for cash of the same nominal value.
From the opening of the Sydney Mint on the 14th May,
1855, to the 31st August, 1888. 16,012,312 oz. of gold,
of the value £60,489,600, were received for coinage. Dur-
ing the same period £55,176,500 in sovereigns, and
£2,388,500 in half-sovereigns, making a total of £57,565,000
in gold coin, was issued, and also gold bullion of the value
of £2,685,202. The total issues of gold coin and bullion
amounted therefore to £60,250,202.
Of the 16,012,312 oz. of gold received, New South Wales
contributed 7,153,046 oz., Queensland 5,050,419 oz., New
Zealand 2,116,690 oz., Victoria 1,438,151 oz., Tasmania
11,803 oz., South Australia 48,764 oz., and other countries
14,800 oz.; the balance, 178,634 oz., consisted of coin.
From 1879 to 1886 inclusive, £327,615 in new silver coin
was issued through the agency of the Sydney Mint, and
since 1868, £29,370 in bronze. Worn British silver coin of
the nominal value of £108,673 was also withdrawn from
circulation, the net loss on which was 13-07 per cent.
Abstract of Transactions from January Ist

64 samples of quartz, weighing 60 tons, were passed
through the experimental quartz-crushing machine, and
372 oz. of gold were extracted by amalgamation.
The gold for coinage was received in 2,991 separate de-
posits, weighing collectively 597,707 oz. ; 6 per cent,
kas in its native state, 7 per cent, consisted of retorted
Sold, and 87 per cent, of gold bullion. The whole having
ooon melted, assayed, and valued, 577,423 oz. were refined
hy the chlorine process, producing 479,839 oz. of refined
Sold, of the average assay of 995"9, and 74,181 oz. of silver,
the average assay of 941.
662,410 oz. of refined ingots and alloy, and 427,294
oz. of scissel, were melted and cast into standard bars.
The average assay of the ingot bars was 916-696, and of
the scissel bars 916-699, the highest and lowest reports on
the former being 917-360 and 916-300, and on the latter
917-275 and 916-400.
The standard bars delivered into the Coining Depart-
ment weighed 957,550 oz., and 531,572 oz. of coin were
returned.
The average assay of the coin was 916-693, the highest
report 917-200, and the lowest 916-300.

Example for ‘Working out Case Spirits to
Proof Gallons.
Say 10 cases Geneva, each 3 gals. 29 gills (2*B under
proof)=39gals. 2 gills. Take the decimal of 2 gills (as
per Decimal Table), and proceed as under:
39‘06 (o'6 decimal of 2 gills.)
2-8 under proof.
r09'368=l gal. to allow.
39 gals. 2 gills.
Less 1 gal.
Equal 38 gals. 2 gills proof.
One case=3 gals. 29 gills @ 2-8 under proof
Sgals. 29gi115=3 , 90 (90 decimal of 29 gills).
2’B under proof.
0-10-920=1-10th to allow (or 3 gills, as table).
: 3 gals. 29 gills.
Less 3 gills.
Equal 3;gals. 26 gills proof.
To Work out Perfumed Spirits to Proof
Gallons.
One case Perfumed Spirits, 52-0 over proof, contains 60
packages, each 3 gills :
50, each 3 gills =.150 gills.
150-4-32 = 4 gals. 22 gills.
Then take the decimal of 22 gills (see Decimal Table),
and multiply by the strength, as under
4-69
52-0
9380
2345
2-43880=-2 gals, and 4-10ths=2gals. 13 gills to add.
i__*i x
4 gals. 22 gills+ 2 gals. 13 gills = 7 gals. 3 gills.
each 12 bottles, each 2
Ten packages Perfumed Spirits, i
oz. = 24 oz. = 240 oz., 34‘3 over proof
as under
Divide 240 oz. by 5 (as 5 oz. are = l gill).
Then divide by 32 for gals. 48(1
=1 gal. 16 gills; 34 - 3 o.p.
Then take the decimal of 16 gills (see Decimal Table),
and multiply by the strength, as under :
450
5-1450=5-10ths to add = 16 gills.
Then Igal. 16 gills -(-16 gills = 2 gallons proof.
One hundred packages, each 6 bottles, each 6 oz. 36
0z.=3,600 oz. 10'6 under proof :
Divide 3,600 oz. by 6 (as 5 oz.= I gill) : 3,600--5=720 ;
then divide by 32 for gallons : 720-5-32=22 gals. 16
gills.
Then take the decimal of 16 gills (see Decimal Table),
and multiply by strength, as the following example:—
22500
2’38600 = 2 gals, and 3-10ths to take off.
22 gals. 16 gills.
2 gals. 10 gills.
20 gals. 6 gills proof. : :
