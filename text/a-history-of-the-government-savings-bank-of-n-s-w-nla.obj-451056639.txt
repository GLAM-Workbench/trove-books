FOREWORD
THE present Government
Savings Bank and the older
Savings Bank of N.S.W. have
been fortunate in finding their his-
torian.
No matter how conversant one may
be with the history of the Bank, it is
impossible to peruse this record
without finding much in the way of
new information in regard to its
history.
The author is to be commended
not only for the thoroughness of his
research, but for the true historic
spirit with which he has completed
his task.
On behalf of my colleagues and
myself, I commend the book not only
to our staff but to the wider field of
those who will find in it an interest
much broader than the history of this
Institution alone.
H. D. HALL,
President.




PREFACE
This is not a text-book. I have tried to make it the kind
of book I have long wanted on my own bookshelves—one to
interest, inform and, I hope, inspire.
Barely a century ago the State Savings Bank in N.S.W.
was managed by one man on a salary of only fifty pounds
a year. To-day, a staff of 1,600 is required to conduct the
State Bank’s affairs, and the combined Balance Sheet of all
Departments totals nearly £100,000,000.
Although officially the history of the Government Savings
Bank of N.S.W. dates from 1871, I have felt justified in begin-
ning in the picturesque days of 1819 because, by its absorption
of the Savings Bank of New South Wales in 1914, the Bank
acquired the history and traditions of that earlier institution
and so, indirectly, takes its origin from “ Campbell’s Bank,”
which the Savings Bank of New South Wales absorbed in 1832.
I am greatly indebted to the Principal Librarian and Staff
of the Public Library of New South Wales (especially the
Mitchell Library), for their courteous and valuable assistance ;
also to my friend, Mr. H. E. Teare, who permitted me to quote
liberally from his “ Digest of Australian and New Zealand
Banking and Currency Legislation,” and whose “Australian
Banking, Currency and Exchange ” proved very helpful.
The Commissioners of the Bank generously placed the
Bank’s records at my disposal, and to them, and the many
members of the staff who readily supplied important informa-
tion, I am also grateful. Mr. A. W. Turner’s brief “ History
and Chronology of Savings Banks ” in the “Australian En-
cyclopaedia ” gave me the key to my research.
Mr. Norman Bede Rydge kindly granted me permission
to reprint five chapters from “ Rydge’s Business Journal,”
where I first published them in article form.
I wish finally to acknowledge my indebtedness to Mr, P.
Kearns, Secretary of the Bank and Mr, Robert McCall, who
carefully read the manuscript with a view to its improvement.
I shall be glad at all times to receive criticisms and sugges-
tions from my readers so that, years hence, when the time
comes to write a second volume, this one may be revised.

A History
of the
Government Savings Bank
of New South Wales
CHAPTER I.
“CAMPBELL’S BANK”
THE FIRST SAVINGS BANK IN AUSTRALIA (1819)
State of the Colony in 1819.
At the time this history starts the commercial life of New
South Wales was still unformed. The Colony had only been
established a little over 30 years, and though the Blue Mountains
had been crossed and there were settlements at Liverpool and
Windsor, the Bank of New South Wales was only two years old.
Among the 27,000 civilised inhabitants there circulated a con-
fused currency which included the “ Holey ” dollar and dump,
store receipts, notes of hand, notes on the Bank, Spanish dollars
and miscellaneous English coins. Only a few years earlier
quite primitive methods of barter had been employed, and it is
recorded that on the occasion of the first theatrical performance
in Sydney the price of admission was one shilling, paid in meal
or rum taken at the door.
Origin of Savings Banks in England.
It is remarkable, therefore, that a savings bank should have
been established here as early as it was. Although the first
European savings bank was established in Brunswick in 1765,
it is not until 1798 that we have any authentic record of an
English savings bank. In that year, Priscilla Wakefield estab-
lished a scheme at Tottenham High Cross, London, whereby
the poor of the district were encouraged to make provision for
their future needs. A year later the Rev. Joseph Smith founded
a savings bank at Wendover, and thereafter, the number of
savings banks increased rapidly. In 1817, two Acts were passed
which regulated their control and management.


Mr. Justice Field arrives in N.S.W.
That same year a young barrister, Mr. Barron Field who
had failed to make a satisfactory living by his pen, turned to the
law again and sailed for New South Wales to fill a judgeship
in our court. Before his departure from England he had been
interested in the savings movement, and one can imagine his
concern at the lack of facilities for saving in the Colony, and the
vice and thriftlessness which everywhere prevailed.
Lack of Facilities for Saving.
Many convicts were plundered of their savings on arrival,
and so it became customary for them to leave what money they
brought with them in the hands of government officials for
safe-keeping. This, however, was often unsatisfactory.
Robert Campbell.
Early in 1819, Mr. Robert Campbell, Merchant, of “ The
Wharf,” who has been called “ the father of Australian com-
merce,” accepted some savings for safe-keeping. He and Mr.
Justice Field were later instrumental in convening a meeting
of the inhabitants of the Colony to consider the formation of a
“ Saving Bank.”
Inaugural Meeting to Found a “ Saving Bank."
This Meeting was held at the New General Hospital,
Sydney, on Saturday, sth June, 1819. His Excellency, Governor
Macquarie, was in the chair and a report of the Meeting ap-
peared in the “ Sydney Gazette and N.S.W. Advertiser ”
on 19th June, 1819.
It was resolved, so the report ran :
1. “ That this Meeting have long witnessed with Sorrow the Ex-
travagance and Improvidence which the poor Settlers, Mechan-
ics, Servants and Labourers of this Colony have fallen into, by
Reason, first, of their having no Encouragement to save their
Earnings ; and secondly of their having, from the peculiar
Circumstances of this Colony, no Place of safe Deposit for
those Earnings, whereby Payments for Produce or Labour
are generally made to them in Property or Barter, in which
Account both the Labour and the Property are rated upon an
artificially high Scale, and the little Money that passes is quickly
dissipated in Spirituous Liquor or Gambling ; a System which
mainly tends to keep them poor, vicious, and unmarried, and is
therefore of the deepest Injury to the Colony.
2. “ That it appears to this Meeting that a great Part of these
Evils would be remedied, and Habits of Economy, Industry
and Matrimony generated, by one of those recent and laudable
Institutions of the Mother Country, called a Saving Bank.

3. “ That Mr. R. Campbell, senr. of Sydney ; Mr. H. McArthur
of Parramatta ; Mr. Wm. Cox, junr. of Windsor ; and Mr.
Moore of Liverpool be duly authorised by the Committee
hereinafter named of the New South Wales Saving Bank,
on every Saturday, at 10 o’clock in the Morning, or at such
other Day and Time as they shall appoint, to open a book for the
Receipt of any Sum, not less than two Shillings and Sixpence,
from any poor Person of his Neighbourhood, male or female,
married or single, and for the Re-payment of such Sum on
demand, but only at the same Day and Time.
4. “ That these Depositaries or Bankers shall not be required
to give the Depositors any written Receipt or Acknowledgment
as long as the Saving is under the sum of £1 ; but shall receive
and repay Money under that Sum, upon personal Sight of the
Depositary, or other Evidence at Discretion, simply recording
the Fact in his Book.
5. “ That immediately upon such Deposit having amounted to one
Pound, the Depositor shall receive a printed Receipt for the
same, signed by the Banker, who shall, upon every such Sum
having remained in his Hands for a complete Year, but not
otherwise, be liable to pay to the Depositor, or his legal personal
Representative the further Sum of one Shilling and Six-pence,
by way of Interest, for every such Pound, for every complete
Year that it shall have been left in the Hands of the Banker.
6. “ That each of the Depositaries or Bankers of the New South
Wales Saving Bank do forthwith give to the Trustees, herein-
after named, such landed Security as the Committee, herein-
after named, shall think sufficient to cover the Amount of any
Sum which may probably be deposited in his Hands, and do be-
come bound to the said Trustees to Re-pay all Deposits with
Interest, as herein-before mentioned, to the several Depositers
or their legal personl Representatives.
7. “ That for the Purpose of providing the Bankers and The Com-
mittee with the necessary Stationary, a present Subscription
be accepted to the Amount of Five Shillings only from each
Subscriber.
8. That His Excellency the Governor be humbly requested to
become the Patron of the New South Wales Saving Bank.
9. “ That Mr. Justice Field be the President, and Mr. R. Camp-
bell, sen., the Treasurer (as to the Stationary Fund) and Secre-
tary of the Saving Bank.
10. “ That the following Gentlemen be Trustees of the Saving
Bank, viz. :
Lieut. Governor Erskine, c.b.
Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde, 1.1. b.
Sir John Jamieson, k.g.v.


11. “ That for the purpose of hearing and answering any Com-
plaints of the poor Depositors, on the Subject of any Savings
by them lodged in the Hands of the several Bankers, a Com-
mittee (of whom 5 shall be a quorum) to consist of the President,
Treasurer, and Secretary, the Trustees, the Bankers, and the
following additional Gentlemen, do meet once in every three
Months at such convenient Place and Time as the President
shall summon them in the * Sydney Gazette,’ viz. :
Mr. Secretary Campbell John Harris, Esq.
Captain Piper Edward Browne, Esq,
Richard Brooks, Esq. T. S. Amos, Esq.
Thomas Wylde, Esq. Robert Jenkins, Esq.
F. Garling, Esq. James Norton, Esq.
12. “ That these Regulations be published in the three next
Sydney Gazettes, for the Information of the industrious Poor of
New South Wales, and be also printed (by Order of His Ex-
cellency the Governor, at the expence of His Majesty’s Govern-
ment) for Distribution among the Convicts upon their Ar-
rival in this Harbour.”
LACHLAN MACQUARIE, Chairman.
His Excellency the Governor having left the Chair,
it was, by Desire of the Meeting, taken by His Honor Lieut-
enant Governor Erskine ; when it was further Resolved:
“ That the warmest Thanks of this Meeting be humbly
offered to His Excellency Governor Macquarie for the Honor
of His Presidency this Day, and for the zealous Interest which
his Administration has evinced in this and all other Institu-
tions for the benefit of the Poor.”
James Erskine, Deputy Chairman.
First Savings Bank Advertisements.
Shortly after the holding of this meeting the following
notice appeared in the “ Gazette ” :
“ Saving Bank —Notice is hereby given, that the Books
will be opened for the Receipt of the Savings of the Industrious
Poor of the Colony, at the following Places, on Saturday next,
17 July Instant at 10 o’clock in the Forenoon:
“At Sydney, at Mr. Robert Campbell’s, George-street;
“At Parramatta, Mr. H. McArthur’s, at the Court-house ;
“At Liverpool, Mr. Moore’s, at the Court-house ;
“At Windsor, Mr. Wm. Cox’s, jun. at Hobart Ville.”
Robert Campbell, Secretary.
George-street, Sydney
10th July, IH9


To advertise the new Bank, and to comply with Clause 12
of the resolution passed at the inaugural meeting, “A Plain
Address to Convicts on Their Arrival, and to the Small Settlers,
Mechanics, Servants and Labourers of the Colony of New
South Wales ” was prepared by Barron Field. This “ Plain
Address ” explained the benefits of the new “ Saving Bank,”
and was distributed among the colonists and among the im-
migrants on their arrival. A copy may be seen at the Mitchell
Library.
Indifferent Success.
At first the success of the Bank was inconsiderable.
People still preferred to leave their money in the hands of
individuals from whom they could immediately withdraw it,
for the purpose of investing it in the purchase of small tenements
in the town, or of extra allowances for their immediate use.
Compulsory Thrift.
Perceiving this, Mr. Commissioner Bigge recommended
that everything in the shape of property that was to minister
to the indulgence of the convicts, or that they obtained from
any other source than their labour, should be carefully kept
from them on their arrival and deposited with the savings bank.
They were not to be allowed to withdraw on them “ till their
condition was improved by their good conduct, testified by
their masters.”
This recommendation was adopted, and any money they
had on their arrival was withdrawn from the convicts and
handed over by the surgeon-superintendent of each ship to
Mr. Campbell. The Bank thus came to be known as the
“ Prisoners’ Bank ” as well as “ Campbell’s Bank.”
In 1823, Sir Thomas Brisbane, in a despatch to Earl
Bathurst, Secretary for the Colonies, referred to two instances
of individuals “ entrusting to this institution no less than
fifty-one pounds.” Thereafter, till its absorption by the
Savings Bank of New South Wales in 1832 the Bank was far
more successful than Mr. Justice Field was at first inclined
to hope.
The following statement from the “ Sydney Gazette ”
of 31st July, 1832 excellently summarises the operations of
“ Campbell’s Bank.”

CHAPTER II.
THE SAVINGS BANK OF N.S.W.
Establishment in 1832.
“ Campbell's Batik," Inadequate.
By 1832, “ Campbell’s Bank ” had grown to such an extent
as to be beyond the casual control of a few philanthropists.
To quote the Governor in his address at the opening of Par-
liament :
“ The sum lodged in the Savings Bank having reached to
a considerable amount it has appeared to me proper that the
Bank should become a public concern regulated by Act of
Parliament.”
First Savings Bank Legislation.
Early in the year, Act 2nd Wm. No. 13 was passed, the
preamble to which ran as follows :
“ Whereas it is desirable for the encouragement of frugality
that persons possessing small sums of money beyond what they
require for the supply of their immediate wants should be
afforded an opportunity of depositing the same on good
security to accumulate at compound interest and to form
a provision for themselves and families.
“Be it therefore enacted . . ”
The principal clauses provided that the Bank should be known
as “ The Savings Bank of N.5.W.,” that the Governor should
be president, and that the affairs of the Bank should be managed
by a board of nine trustees.
The first trustees were :
Judge Dowling, Vice-President
Mr. Justice Therry
Colonel Shadforth
William C. Wentworth
Thomas Walker
James Chisholm
William Macpherson
John Blaxland
E. Deas Thompson


They held their first meeting at the Court House, King
Street, on 26th July, 1832, and conferred the office of accountant
on Mr. George Miller (which office he held till 1854). His
commencing salary was £5O per annum, but this was increased
the following year to £lOO per annum. A loan of £lOO was
made by the Government to enable the trustees to commence
operations, and Mr. James Chisholm granted the use of a room
in his house, gratuitously, for 12 months, for an office.
The Foresight of Mr. James Chisholm.
Mr. James Chisholm was an enterprising, successful man,
who had a romantic career. He was a Warrant Officer in the
old New South Wales Corps and was responsible for the
clothing and uniform appearance of the regiment. Fortune
favoured him and when he left the regiment he opened the
Thistle Inn in George Street, which, during the time he kept it,
had an excellent reputation. He was not slow to foresee the
usefulness of a properly constituted Savings Bank, and his
generosity in setting apart a room of his house for its accommo-
dation is but one instance of his interest in its welfare.
The New Bank Commences Business.
The Bank opened its doors for business on 18th August,
1832. Business was transacted at first on Saturdays from 6
to 8 p.m., and later on Thursdays from 1 to 2 p.m. also. The
first account to be opened was that of the Colonial Treasurer.
The first personal account was in the name of John William
Chisholm with a deposit of £l.
In the four months and a half which ended the year 1832,
the sum of £2,981 was deposited by 157 depositors. The first
interest paid out of the Bank’s earnings was the sum of six-
pence, to two depositors. Apart from the accountant’s salary
the only other disbursement worth mentioning during the first
few months was the sum of six shillings for the purchase of
candles !
Transfer of Funds from “ CamphelVs Bank.”
In his despatch of 19th March, 1832, the Governor related
that he had “ called on Mr, Campbell to make arrangements
for paying into the Colonial Treasury, to the Credit of the
Trustees, the money due to Government on account of the
convicts. Mr. Campbell requires time to make these payments
as he states the principal part of the deposits is lent on mortgage
at ten per cent.”


In the year 1833, the deposits increased to £15,255 and the
number of depositors to 2,549. In this year the balance of the
funds of free settlers deposited in “ Campbell’s Bank ” (amount-
ing to £2,295) was transferred by order of the Government
to the Bank, and from this period, it seems, Mr. Campbell
ceased to carry on the arrangement which for fifteen years
conferred great benefit on the unfortunate convicts, for whose
use it had been projected, and on the free settlers who availed
themselves of it.
Amending Act and Rules and Regulations .
In 1834, the original Act was amended by the Act 5 Wm.
IV., No. 16, by which the number of trustees was increased
to eighteen.
A copy of the Rules and Regulations for the conduct
and management of the Bank, made in the same year, and
approved by the Governor, may be seen among the records at
the Mitchell Library.
Tribute Paid by “ The Australian .”
How did our ancestors regard the Bank in those days ?
The following extract from “ The Australian,” published on
Monday evening, February 10th, 1834, testifies to their satis-
faction with the progress of the Institution.
“ The New South Wales Savings Bank is in a very flour-
ishing condition. Upon the first commencement of this
Institution it was calculated that interest at five per centum
per annum would be paid upon deposits—By the account
just published in the Government Gazette it will be seen that
a percentage of seven and a half has been paid to the de-
positors. We are very happy to hear this, because it shows
that savings to a considerable amount are frequently deposited,
not for temporary security, but as regular instalments to
important accumulations it is a proof of public improvement
in habits as well as in wealth, and an encouragement to the
economical and provident to do likewise. The depositors
are better off here than at Home with respect to these in-
stitutions. Here the security is real property. In England
it is Public Credit.”
“ The Australian’s ” remark about the security of deposit-
ors being better in N.S.W. than in England is interesting in the
light of later experience, for in a few years time, as is told in the
next chapter, discounts proved embarrassing to the Bank and
some of the “ Public Credit ” to which “ The Australian ”
referred with slight contempt would have been highly accept-
able.


Investment of Funds.
Shortly after the appearance of this paragraph, a series of
advertisements appeared in “ The Australian,” the first of
which—published on Friday, 12th of December, 1834—read :
“ £2,000 TO BE LENT
THE TRUSTEES OF THE SAVINGS BANK at their
meeting to be held on Saturday the 20th instant, at seven
o’clock p.m., in the Bank Office, at the house of James
Chisholm, Esq., will discount bills at 6 months, bearing three
names to the above amount. Discounts 10 per cent, per annum.
“ By order of His Honour the Vice-President, a General
Meeting of the Trustees is summoned at the time and place
abovementioned.
“ N.B.—No money will be lent on mortgage at the Meet-
ing.”
GEORGE MILLER,
Accountant.

CHAPTER III.
THE FIRST RUN ON THE SAVINGS BANK (1843)
New Premises and Branches.
After being closed as usual the first week in January,
the Bank re-opened for business in new premises on Saturday,
9th January, 1836. The new head office was situated at the
first entrance in King Street from George Street, at Moore s
corner.
In 1838, branches were established at Parramatta, Windsor,
Maitland and Bathurst. In the first seven years of the Bank’s
existence the number of depositors increased to 4,163, and the
deposits to £106,182. (This sum does not include the £7,000
or more deposited at the branches opened in 1838).
In view of the fact that the population of the colony in
1839 did not exceed 114,000 (of which number almost one-
third were in servitude) these figures show a large degree of
success for the operations of so short a period, being at the rate
of about twenty shillings per head of the total population.
Act of 1839.
In 1839 it was found advisable to pass another Act (Act
3 Vic. No. 12) consolidating and amending the existing Acts
and providing for the appointment of District Trustees and
Staff.
This Act was referred by the Secretary of State to Mr.
John Tidd Pratt, an eminent counsel to whom, in England, the
rules of the different savings banks were submitted for approval
previous to adoption. Mr. John Tidd Pratt was author of a
work on “ The Law Relating to Savings Banks.”
Criticisms by Mr. John Tidd Pratt.
It was not until 1841 that Mr. Pratt’s criticisms were com-
municated to the Trustees. Mr. Pratt found fault with many
things, but mainly with the control of the Institution by the
Governor of the State.
A reply to these criticisms was prepared by the Attorney-
General, on the observations submitted by Mr. George Miller.


Observations on Mr. Pratt’s Remarks by Mr. Miller.
Mr. George Miller’s remarks afford an illuminating side-
light on the state of the Colony at that period.
He said :
“ It appears to me that Mr. Pratt’s objections to the Savings
Bank Act originate in a want of knowledge of the State of Society
in this Colony which he assimilates with that existing at home
where there is in every district an established Gentry, Yeo-
manry, Clergy and Peasantry and in Towns a mercantile
community long and permanently fixed. While such is the
State of Society, Savings Banks will originate from example,
there being between those taking the lead and management
and those depositing a confidence grounded on existing ties.
In a new country like this, society is very different. No division
of it is fixed, a great proportion of the population are recent
arrivals, and the only permanent body is the Government.
“ So far back as the Government of General Macquarie,
a Savings Bank was established under private management,
but it languished and in 1832 when the present Savings Bank
was commenced the other was with a very few voluntary
depositors almost solely the repository of money taken by the
Government from prisoners of the Crown and placed there on
their account.
“ Mr. Pratt says : ‘lt appears to me very objectionable
that the Governor should be President of an Institution of the
nature of a Savings Bank particularly when he has by the Act
the whole control and management ’ —This is a mistake. The
act enacts that the Governor shall be the President, but the
management shall be vested in eighteen Trustees. The ap-
pointment of these Trustees by the Governor gives him no
voice in the management beyond the position which Mr. Pratt
su gg ests in the next clause of his letter he should be in, standing
between the Depositors and Trustees to protect the interests
of the Depositors by exercising a Controlling power over the
Trustees in seeing that the accounts of Receipts and Investments
are regularly kept.
“ There is a vagueness in Mr. Pratt’s opinion with re-
ference to the appointment of Trustees—a public meeting of
whom to elect them ?
“ If Mr. Pratt means a public meeting of the inhabitants
of a district or town to elect Trustees, it is only another in-

stance how difficult it is for anyone however well informed to
legislate for a society of which he knows nothing of the com-
ponent parts.
“ The clause which Mr. Pratt suggests with reference to
the settlement of disputes by arbitration, though not embodied
in the Act of Council, is in the Rules of the Bank which are
given gratuitously to all Depositors.
“ There is no Treasurer of the Institution —The Commer-
cial Bank is the Bank of Deposit (but as the Trustees meet
weekly to lend the available funds the balance in the Bank is
at no time of any great amount) and the clause giving a priority
of payment in case of Insolvency would only apply to the
accountant who grants security.
“ When Sir Richard Bourke determined on establishing a
Savings Bank on a popular and firm basis he saw the necessity
of identifying the Government with it—the Government is not
legally pledged to make up any losses or deficiencies and it
merely takes that stand which in a settled community would be
taken by men who can have no existence in a new and fluctu-
ating society. There has as yet been no loss, and the manage-
ment is entrusted to gentlemen whose duties are defined, and
under whose control nothing of a serious nature is to be
apprehended.
“ The Savings Bank as now established and conducted
has gone on as well as the best friends to such Institutions
could wish —in the absence of a Government fund wdierein to
deposit the money, it is lent on Bills and Mortgages of heritable
property.
“Any proceedings which would go to shake the confidence
of the Depositors in the affairs of the Institution might be
attended with consequences of the most disastrous nature —
£IOO,OOO lent on mortgage could only be recovered by a severe,
and certainly in many instances, legal pressure on numerous
individuals, and years might be spent in the recovery.
“ I trust therefore, that Mr, Pratt’s opinion will not be
considered of such importance as to cause any material al-
teration in our present constitution.”
Plainly, Mr. George Miller could not see eye to eye with
Mr, John Tidd Pratt.


Governor's Tribute.
In 1840, the Governor, Sir George Gipps, in his despatch
to Lord John Russell, said :
“As a proof of the condition of the Labouring Classes in
New South Wales, and of the advantages which persons may
reasonably expect to share in by emigrating to its shores, I
would beg to refer Your Lordship to the evidence of the
Actuary of the Sydney Savings Bank, who informed the Com-
mittee of the Legislative Council that during the year 1839
(the year of the greatest scarcity ever known in the Colony),
the Bank opened 100 new-accounts with Depositors per month ;
and that, during the present year (1840), the average number
of new Depositors is 150 per month, that 19 depositors out of
every 20 belong to the Labouring Classes ; that compound
interest at the rate of ten per cent, per annum is allowed by the
Bank ; and that the present amount of deposits (exclusive of
those of Convicts) is £127,000.”
Port Phillip Savings Bank Established.
A short Act was passed in 1840, known as 4 Vic. No, 15,
legalizing certain acts of the trustees, not provided for in former
Acts, and in the following year —1841—another Act was passed
(5 Viet. No. 5) establishing a Savings Bank at Port Phillip,
distinct from the Institution at Sydney. This Bank is to-day
the State Savings Bank of Victoria.
Artificial Prosperity of the Colony.
In the three years from 1839 to 1842 the deposits increased
over 50 per cent., namely, from £106,082 to £165,171, and the
depositors from 4,163 to 5,493.
This rapid progress, however, was delusive. The seemingly
lusty child was going ahead too fast, and—living in an artificial
atmosphere—it was rapidly outgrowing its strength.
From 1834 to 1840, capital poured into the Colony seeking
greedy gains at usurious rates. For several years imports
doubled exports ; in 1839 they were in excess more than a
million and a quarter, and in 1840 and 1841 over a million
and a half. The amount invested in land (the price of which
was then 12 /- per acre) was £316,626, an amount that—with
all the State’s plethora of gold and pastoral, mining and com-
mercial wealth—the sales did not again reach till 1854 ; three
years after the discovery of gold.


Downfall of Bank of Australia and the Consequence.
The Bank of Australia (established 1827), in which many
of the leading merchants and settlers were involved, fed the
mania for speculation by a wholesale system of discounting.
Mr. George Miller, Accountant of the Savings Bank, was
outspoken in his criticism of this Bank’s affairs. As was natural,
there were those who resented his intrusion, and they re-
taliated by enlisting the aid of a newspaper and subtly hinting
through its columns that perhaps his own Bank was not above
reproach. The rumour was even circulated that the trustees
of the Savings Bank had been discounting bills to an unsafe
extent. This had a disturbing effect. Immediately following
the failure of the Bank of Australia, panic broke out. It
was known that some of the trustees of the Savings Bank
were affected by the downfall of the Bank of Australia—con-
fidence was destroyed—and on Monday and Tuesday, the
Ist and 2nd of May, 1843, the doors of the Institution were
besieged by a clamorous crowd of depositors who in those
two days withdrew £22,666 ; a sum more difficult to raise at
that period, perhaps, than many hundred times the amount
would be to-day.
Curious Advertisement in the “ Herald .”
On Thursday, May 3rd, 1843, the day following the crisis,
the following interesting advertisement appeared in “ The
Sydney Morning Herald ” :
“ SAVINGS BANK
MR. SAMUEL LYONS begs to inform persons who have
deposits in the Savings Bank that he has the undermentioned
valuable properties for sale : and to convince persons that the
misrepresentations that have been made are entirely without
foundation, he is willing to TAKE ANY DEPOSITS they
may have there, in payment or part payment, should they
become purchasers at any of the following sales ;
“A large sale of Tea, on Friday, sth instant;
“A cargo of Sugar, now lying in the Harbour for sale in a
few days ;
“ One hundred packages of Merchandise, on Monday and
Tuesday the Bth and 9th instant;
“ Land in Parramatta Street, Wednesday, 10th instant.
“ George Street and Charlotte Place Auction Mart.”
Committee of Enquiry Appointed.
At the request of the trustees the Governor immediately
appointed a committee to inquire into the affairs of the Bank.
The committee reported favourably on the condition of the Bank


and the integrity with which it had been managed. The findings
of the committee partially restored public confidence, but at
the end of the year no less than 1,837 depositors were found
to have withdrawn their savings, amounting in the aggregate
to some £50,000. This was a sore trial to the Institution, but
it stood the test nobly. The resources of the bank were
sufficiently ample and liquid to enable the trustees, even in
those hard times, to meet every claim as it was made.
Alterations to Constitution.
It was evident, however, that alterations in the constitution
of the Bank were needed. In consequence the Government
passed an Act (7 Vic. No. 6) which entirely prohibited the dis-
counting of Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes, and this
mode of employing savings bank funds has not been resorted
to in N.S.W. since. The Act also provided that the profits
should be divided among the depositors in proportion to their
savings on the joint stock principle, and that only one-third
of the funds could be lent on mortgage. Funds could be
invested in New South Wales Government securities or in the
Bank of England. Two-thirds of the total funds could also be
placed at interest in Colonial Banks. If a depositor withdrew
his savings before 31st December in any year, interest was to be
credited at the rate of £3 /6 /8 per cent, per annum.
Since there might arise occasions on which the Bank would
be unable, without the assistance of the Government, to meet
the demands made upon it by depositors withdrawing their
accounts, the Government guaranteed the repayment of de-
positors up to £50,000. This amount remained unaltered for
seventy years.
As an additional safeguard, depositors were required to
give longer notice of their intention to withdraw (three months
for amounts over £SO).
Critical Conditions Continue.
The situation continued unsatisfactory for some time.
In the early part of 1844, the diminution of building operations,
consequent on the fall of rents in Sydney, caused a considerable
number of workmen to be thrown out of employment. Those
persons were living in greater part on the money which,
in better times they had deposited in the Bank. What would
happen, it was asked, if—in addition to the loss of their wages
—these people had to face the loss of their savings ? Fortunately
this eventuality did not materialize, but it was not until 1850
that deposits reached what they had been in 1843.


CHAPTER IV.
WHEN THE SAVINGS BANK OF N.S.W. HAD TOO
MUCH MONEY (1845-1848)
A Flaw in the Act.
The Act of 1843, designed to restrict the Bank’s invest-
ments to safe channels, carried its purpose too far, and in the
five years that followed, the rigidity of its provisions made it
difficult for the Trustees to carry on the affairs of the In-
stitution.
It will be remembered that the trustees were prevented
from lending more than one-third of the deposits on mortgage.
The discounting of bills was wholly prohibited, and in any
case would have been inexpedient. True, two-thirds of the
funds could be placed at interest with the trading banks, but
these institutions would allow no interest whatever on sums
deposited with them.
Trustees' Dilemma.
On 4th March, 1845, the Trustees began to grow alarmed
at the unproductive funds rapidly accumulating, and addressed
a letter to the Colonial Treasurer suggesting an issue of Govern-
ment Debentures as a measure of relief.
The only Government securities obtainable at that time
were Debentures issued for financing Immigration.
A further letter was sent to the Colonial Treasurer in May,
but the Trustees’ Minute of the 3rd June, 1845, provides
the best insight into the position.
This Minute read :
“ The Trustees have already purchased Land and Im-
migration Debentures at the market price to as large an extent
as has been found practicable, but notwithstanding that they
have applied to all the Banks which are the principal holders,
as well as to the agents employed in the negotiation of securities
of this nature, stating their willingness to make further purchases
at a premium of 2| per cent., the whole amount which has been
procurable from private sources has only been £1,600.”
The Trustees were of opinion that it would be unwise to


offer more favourable terms because, after providing for the
necessary expenses of the Institution and considering the
reduced period the debentures then had to run, the return
would be so reduced as to render the investment almost profit-
less, even if the necessary amount could be procured by this
means, which seemed doubtful.
The investments at that time consisted of £24,600 in
Government Debentures, £98,000 in Mortgages of Real
Property, £9,500 in Bills Discounted (under the old Act)
and £20,500 lying “ without fructification ” at the Banks.
It seemed that unless some profitable outlet could be found
for the steadily increasing balances, even the moderate rate of
£3 /6 /8 per cent, per annum could not be paid to depositors
on the Ist January.
In desperation the trustees informed the Governor that
“ under the circumstances, there being no present legal means
of investment, unless His Excellency the Governor and the
Colonial Legislature consent to some measure which will
enable the Trustees to place the funds of the Institution at
interest, its beneficial operations in the interests of the industrial
classes must be materially curtailed, if not entirely annihilated.”
Government Debentures asked for.
They, therefore, asked :
“ That application be made to the Colonial Legislature
for an Act to authorize the issue of Debentures not exceeding a
sum to be fixed, secured upon the General Revenue of the
Colony, and bearing interest at the rate of five per cent, per
annum.
“ That these Debentures should be confined exclusively
to the investment of the funds of the Savings Bank of New
South Wales and Port Phillip respectively, from time to time
as the Trustees of these Institutions with the concurrence
and approval of His Excellency the Governor may deem
expedient.
“ That the funds thus accruing should be placed to a
separate account in the Public Treasury to be termed the
* Savings Banks’ Public Work Fund,’ and be expended in the
prosecution of such public works as may be determined upon,
subject in every respect to the same rules in the application,
auditing and issue, as funds the produce of taxes, rates, duties

and imports are liable to under the provisions of the Act of
Parliament, 5 and 6 Viet., cap. 76.”
In making this proposal, the Trustees referred to the fact
that, for the benefit of similar Institutions in England
and in the principal States of Europe, laws had been
passed which freed them from any risk in the validity of the
Security on which the Funds were invested, or changes in the
rate of interest distributed. “It is true,” said the Trustees,
“ that from the existence of Public Works under the control
of the Legislature, it will operate not only for the benefit of the
particular class referred to (i.e., the poorer depositors), who will
thus be afforded the means of a profitable investment of their
deposits in the Bank, but also will promote the best interests
of the Colony at large. The Trustees take the liberty of suggest-
ing that, with the view of preventing any ultimate charge upon
the public from the measure now proposed, it would be de-
sirable to undertake such work only as may be calculated by
means of a toll or otherwise to provide for payment of the
current interest, and for the redemption of the principal sums
invested. If this be done, the means would be placed at the
disposal of the Executive Government and Legislature of
prosecuting many public works of great utility without having
recourse to raising funds by taxation or in any other way except
from the parties immediately benefitted, or receiving a fair
equivalent for the sum expended.”
Further Criticisms by Mr. John Tidd Pratt.
To add to the Trustees worries at this time, the criticisms
of Mr. John Tidd Pratt on the Act of 1843, came to hand.
Among other things Mr. Pratt said :
“ The rate of interest is altogether too uncertain, and on
looking at the amount of the annual charges for conducting the
State Savings Bank of New South Wales, they appear to be
exceedingly high, averaging 12/6 per Account per annum.”
To this the Trustees replied that unlike the Savings Banks
in England, the Institution had no means of investing its funds
in Government Securities of a fixed rate of interest, but had to
invest its money at the best possible rate. This necessitated
a distribution of profits in the form of interest somewhat on the
lines of the Joint Stock principle.
With respect to Mr. Pratt’s second point, that the annual
charges were too high, the Trustees said :


“ Mr, Pratt does not appear to have been accurately in-
formed as to the number of accounts, which he conceived to be
about one half of the actual number. The standard of expense
adverted to by him is altogether fallacious in its application
to this Colony, and indeed at best the number of accounts can
afford but a very uncertain criterion of the extent of the time
and trouble occupied by them since 20 small weekly depositors
require infinitely more attention and more frequent reference
to the ledgers than 200 large and consequently infrequent
depositors ... the expenses of the establishment ought to be
in proportion to the time and labour occupied by its work.”
That seems to have been the last occasion on which Mr.
John Tidd Pratt troubled the Trustees.
Continued Increase of Uninvested Funds.
Towards the end of 1845 an Act (Act 9, Vic. No. 25) was
passed which limited the amount to be received from any one
depositor to £lOO, except in the case of estates of intestate
persons paid in by order of the Supreme Court, and the deposits
of Crown Convicts. No interest was payable on any deposits
in excess of £lOO. Investments on mortgage were permitted
to one half the total deposits and the Bank was empowered to
lend £6,000 to the Corporation of Sydney for five years at
six per cent, per annum. The clause in the Act of 1843 by which
portion of the funds of the Bank might be sent to England for
investment was repealed, for at that time there was a strong
disinclination to “ sending money out of the colony ” for in-
vestment in England.
Yet despite these drastic curtailments of the facilities
offered to the depositors by the Bank, and the new fields of
investment opened up, at a meeting of the trustees held on the
11th August, 1846, Mr. Miller reported that the amount then
uninvested was £39,000, and that this amount was increasing
at the rate of £1,200 per month. It was estimated that the
amount lying idle at the close of the year would reach £45,000.
The Return of Deposits and Investments of the Bank as at
10th of August, 1846, was as follows :
Total Amount of Deposits .. .. .. .. £159,700
Investments :
Loans on Mortgage .. .. . • • • 93,400
Loans on Bills .. .. .. • • • • 5,500
Loans on Government Debentures .. .. 26,000
Cash in Bank .. ~ .. .. • • 39,000


In January, 1847, the Government notified its intention
of paying off the amount of the Immigration Debentures held
by the Trustees, in all some £26,000. As the uninvested funds
at that time amounted to £42,000, the Institution threatened
to be completely crippled. However, an outlet was found
for an investment of £6,000 with the Corporation of Mel-
bourne, and arrangements were made for a large deposit in the
Colonial Treasury.
Government Securities Available at Last.
This eased the position till 1848, when, after considerable
anxiety on the part of the Trustees, Act 11 Vic. No. 40, was
passed, providing that funds could be lent to the Government
for public works on the security of debentures chargeable on
the security of the general revenue of the Colony.
Thereafter the Trustees could watch an increase in de-
posits with satisfaction instead of with dismay.


CHAPTER V.
YEARS OF STEADY GROWTH (1850-1892)
New Head Office Building.
In 1846 an Act was passed authorising the expenditure of
£3,000 upon the building of suitable offices on a block of land
in Barrack Street (formerly part of the Barrack Square), granted
by the Government for the purpose. A single-storey building
was completed and opened for business in 1850. A second and
third storey were added later.
In 1850, also, a branch was established at Singleton.
Confidence in the Institution was by now restored, and in 1851
the depositors had increased to 5,550, that is, 57 more than in
1842. The deposits reached £199,261, or £34,090 in excess
of what they were nine years before. The population in 1851
was 187,243, so that the amount deposited was at the rate of
£2 /10/3| per head.
The Discovery of Gold.
In connection with this restoration of the public confidence
and the increase in prosperity, however, it must be remembered
that the year 1851 marked a great discovery—the discovery
of gold. This gave an impetus to the languishing energies of the
people and had a marked effect on the banking institutions
of the State; not the least the Savings Bank.
During 1852 the returns exhibited the relatively large
addition of £210,184 to depositors’ balances, being at the rate
of over £25 per depositor. There was an accession of 2,064
to the number of depositors. During the same year, Goulburn
Branch was opened.
The year 1853 witnessed a further addition to the deposits
of £170,833 and an increase of 1,495 in the number of de-
positors. Thus taking the two years 1852 and 1853 together,
we find no less a sum than £381,017 deposited by 9,720 de-
positors, whose balances at the close of 1853 totalled £602,269.
The Act of 1853.
In 1853, Act 17 Vic. No. 24 received Royal assent. By it
all the former Acts were repealed and their provisions amended
and consolidated. The Bank continued under the same name.
The trustees, as a body corporate were made capable of suing

at FitzRoy River.


and being sued. All securities belonging to the Bank were
vested in the trustees for the benefit of the depositors, with
power to “ take, hold and convey.” The Governor continued
as President, and the Board of Management still comprised
eighteen trustees (one of whom was appointed Vice-President)
and the Managing Trustee. Further provisions were : Five
trustees to form a quorum. No trustee to borrow money, nor
directly nor indirectly to receive any salary or emolument from
the funds of the Bank (excepting the Managing Trustee, by
whom the daily business of the Bank was conducted, and who
gave security for the due and faithful discharge of his duties).
The trustees were empowered to make rules for the conduct
and management of the affairs of the Bank, and to regulate the
rate of interest to be paid to depositors from time to time.
The rate for many years was 5 per cent, per annum).
Deposits from 1/- up to £2OO could be received. The
trustees were empowered to limit the interest so as not to be
payable on the surplus of any account exceeding £IOO.
The Act provided for the investment of funds by deposit
in the Colonial Treasury, or in any of the Banks of the Colony,
or in the purchase of debentures or any other public securities.
Any portion of the funds, not exceeding one half of the whole
moneys deposited and not more than £5,000 to any one person,
could be lent on mortgage of real estate. Investments in Bank
Bills were authorised if these investments offered profitable
employment of the funds of the Bank.
The appointment of district trustees for the country
branches was vested in the Governor. The trustees in Sydney
were given power to appoint the district accountants, who were
required to give security for the due accounting for moneys
in their hands. These moneys they were required to remit
to the Managing Trustee in Sydney monthly.
The trustees were required to publish annual Balance
Sheets, and to create a “ Reserved Fund ” from which to meet
such emergencies as a sudden demand or run on the Bank
similar to that which took place in 1843. The Government
guarantee of £50,000 was continued.
Christopher Rolleston’s Keen Interest.
On the 22nd of September, 1857, Christopher Rolleston,
who was then Registrar-General and an ardent supporter
of the Savings Bank movement (being a Trustee of the Bank)


delivered a lecture on “ The History, Progress and Advantages
of Savings Banks ” at the School of Arts, Sydney. Two thous-
and copies of this lecture were printed and distributed at the
Bank’s expense. By good fortune one copy found a place on the
shelves of the Mitchell Library and it has formed the framework
of the earlier chapters of this book.
Discussing the Balance Sheet published on 31st December,
1856, showing deposits totalling £667,420/15/2, Christopher
Rolleston pointed out that this sum was at the rate of £64 /6 /7
per head for each depositor, and £2/10 /If per head on the
total population. He compiled an interesting table which
showed the condition of the branches for that year. “It is
curious,” he said, “ to notice the variations in the average
amount of deposits to the number of depositors, as well as to the
total population of the respective districts.”
A copy of this table is given on the opposite page.
“ Leaving Sydney out of the question,” said Mr. Rolleston,
“ it will be seen that Windsor far outstrips the others in the
amount deposited, in the proportion of depositors to the total
population, in the average sum deposited, and in the sum de-
posited per head of the total population,
“To what cause the greater success of the Windsor Bank
is to be attributed I am not at the present moment prepared to
say. Whether arising from the exertions of the local directors,
or from the more industrious and thrifty habits of the people,
it bears evidence of an amount of industry, prudence and
prosperity, of which it would be gratifying to find more frequent
instances in other districts not less favoured by nature.”
• V
Discovery of Gold at Fitzßoy River.
The smooth tranquility of the Bank’s progress was for a
while disturbed in 1858 as a result of the excitement produced
by the discovery of gold at the Fitzßoy River. Receipts fell
away and withdrawals were heavy, but no serious consequence
ensued.
Thereafter, for many years, the Bank’s progress was steady
but uneventful. The trustees were conservative and a few,
one fears, were indifferent.
Branches were established in different parts of the State,
but only at long intervals. A local trustee, as well as the ac-
countant, had to be in attendance at each branch before any

business could be transacted. Business hours were thus often
restricted and this in itself militated against the full develop-
ment of the functions of the Bank.
Routine of Trustees’ Meetings.
The trustees’ minute books show that the Board’s chief
business comprised the consideration of applications for
loans by way of mortgage ; decisions as to the price to be
tendered for Government Debentures ; bargaining with the
trading banks over the rate to be received on Fixed Deposits ;
consideration of representations for the establishment of
branches ; the appointment or replacement of branch ac-
countants and discussion of questions of policy. Since the
salaries of the staff were not reviewed annually as they are
to-day, the Board occasionally received a letter from a member
of the staff “ praying ” for an increase in his salary. Some of
these requests the Board was “ pleased to grant,” and some the
Board refused. Of the staff, however, more is written in the
closing chapter.
Policy of Expansion.
In 1867, Mr. Alexander Dick, one of the trustees, moved
“ That having regard to the fact that the Reserve Fund now
amounts to £85,275, the time has arrived when the operations
of the Bank ought to be considerably extended.”
It was resolved :
“ That a Branch Bank be established in the Southern
part of the City with as little delay as possible, and a suitable
house be rented for that purpose.
“ That Branch Banks should be built in
“ Windsor ;
“ West Maitland ;
“ Newcastle ;
“ Parramatta ; and
“ Goulburn,
“ and that Mr. Rolleston, Mr. Dick, Mr Piddington, Captain
McLerie and the Managing Trustee be appointed a Committee
to report upon the best means of carrying out the same with
power to consult the architect.
“ That additional accommodation should be given for
carrying on the business of the Bank at the Head Office. ’
In view of the present-day importance of the Southern
Branch, the following extracts from the minutes of the Ist
June, 1868, make interesting reading :
“ The Southern Branch Committee reported that they had
rented the middle premises belonging to Mr. Whiting situated
near Christ Church, George Street, for one year at £l5O per
annum with the option of renewing the lease at the end of that
time for three years longer at the same rent.”


Southern Branch (corner of George and Hay Streets, Sydney).


Staffing Southern Branch.
The following report from the Managing Trustee was read
and approved, viz. :
“In appointing Officers to conduct the business of the
Southern Branch, I beg to recommend for the consideration
of the Trustees that the first Clerk, Mr. George Wilson, who
has been in the service of the Bank for upwards of Fifteen
Years, should be entrusted with the charge of the Bank, with
an additional security of £l,OOO. From his long service he is
well known to the Depositors and his appearance at the counter
of the New Bank would, I am persuaded, give confidence to
the General Public. I would also recommend that a Senior
Clerk be appointed as Assistant at a salary of £lOO a year—like-
wise a messenger at £4O per annum.
“ In the event of these recommendations being adopted
and to supply the vacancy which would thereby be created
in the Head Office, I would further recommend that the
Accountant, Mr. Cuff, who has hitherto been employed more as
a Teller than the Accountant, should take his proper position
as Accountant of the Bank, taking up part of his duties which
have heretobefore been performed by Mr. Wilson. That
Mr. George Wise, the second Clerk, whose principal duty
has been to enter the Receipts and Payments from the Pass
Books at the Counter, taking discharges for the latter, should
be appointed to receive Deposits and make Payments in lieu
of Mr. Cuff and that Mr. Henry Morgan, the third Clerk,
should take up the duties at present performed by Mr. Wise.
“ With reference to the Ledgerkeepers, as it is to be pre-
sumed that the opening of a Branch will relieve the work at
Head Office, I would recommend that no additional Clerk
should be appointed at present until the necessity is felt for
such a step.”
(Sgd.) G. O. Allen
The First Inspector.
In 1869 a committee of inspection discovered serious
discrepancies in the books of one of the country branches.
It was decided, therefore, to appoint an “ Examiner of Branch
Accounts,” and Mr. David Mitchell was the first to fill that
office. In the exercise of his duties he was obliged to travel
all over the State by coach—a very different means of transit
from that available to-day. On his first tour of inspection he
found that the books at some of the branches were kept in a
most unsatisfactory manner. At some branches no ledger,
even, was in use ! He had, therefore, to instruct the Accountants
of the country branches in the correct bookkeeping procedure,
besides which he reported to the Board in Sydney on the
suitability, or otherwise, of the different country premises.


CHAPTER VI.
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT
SAVINGS BANK OF N.S.W. (1871)
Inadequacy of the Barrack Street Branch.
Although by 1870 the Savings Bank of New South Wales
was doing very useful work, it had only sixteen branches.
The Act governing it, as has been explained, required the
presence of a trustee in every branch before business could be
transacted, and this in itself prevented any great extension of the
Bank’s facilities.
The Penny Banks.
In the city and suburbs there were a number of penny
banks (such as the Wollahra Penny Savings Bank and the
Surry Hills Wesleyan Penny Savings Bank) which benevolent
individuals had started with a view of encouraging thrifty
habits among the young and among those whose savings were
too small in amount to be acceptable at the Savings Bank of
New South Wales. But in several cases the original officers,
from various causes, had to resign, and it w'as not easy to find
others to take their tedious duties on them. For this reason
some of these little banks were threatened with extinction.
Post Office Savings Banks in England.
The Post Office Savings Banks in England were proving
highly successful, and similar institutions had already been
formed in Victoria (11th September, 1865) and Queensland.
N.S.W. was lagging behind ! Mr. Christopher Rolleston, by
now Auditor-General, still a trustee of the Barrack Street
Bank, still an ardent supporter of the Savings Movement,
doing his utmost to promote the habit of thrift among the
people of the State, perceived the deficiency and urged—in a
paper read before the Royal Society of N.S.W. on “ Post Office
Savings Banks, Friendly Societies and Government Life
Insurance ” —the early establishment of Post Office Savings
Banks in New T South Wales.
Christopher Rolleston's Plea.
“When we consider, “he said, “that out of the 113
towns and villages enumerated in the census of 1861, the ad-


vantages of Savings Banks have only been extended to sixteen ,
we see at once how inadequate is the Savings Bank of N.S.W.
to meet the wants of the inhabitants in the remote and sparsely
populated districts, and we are led to the enquiry how are we
to reach these people ? . . . There are plenty of bush public
houses with their demoralising allurements to swallow up the
yearly savings of a poor shepherd, bullock-driver or bush-
man. He is often relieved in a night of the earnings of a year ;
and, poor man, he can hardly help himself, for he does not know
where to place his money, or how to invest it; so he drinks and
squanders it, and returns to his labours a poorer, but not a
wiser man —in nine cases out of ten probably to repeat the same
folly again. I say, then, we are bound as a Christian com-
munity—seeing that we encourage, by our legislation, the
temptation under which so many are led to ruin—to do what we
can to provide an antidote. Much has been done to extend
the blessings of education to the young throughout the length
and breadth of the land, and as an adjunct to this we want to
provide for the education of the adult—the father that is, or is
to be, of the future generation. We want to train him in the
ways of industry, temperance, and prudence ; and to make of
him a better husband, a better father and a better citizen.
And of the means to be taken to bring about this desirable
result, perhaps the encouragement of institutions of the kind
I have alluded to are the most effective, but we must look for
an organisation better adapted for our purpose than that of
the present Savings Bank, and where else can we find an
organisation better adapted for our purpose than that of the
present Savings Bank, and where else can we find an organisa-
tion adequate to the accomplishment of the ends in view but
in the Post Office with its five hundred branch offices, scattered
all over the country ? In connection with the Post Office we
have a hundred and sixty “ Money Order ” offices, and wherever
there is a “ Money Order ” Office why should we not have a
Savings Bank ? We know that in the Mother Country the Post
Office has organised a most successful system of Savings Banks,
and that in the adjoining colonies her beneficent example has
been imitated ; and why not in New South Wales ? Why
should we be behind in the race for improvement ? ”
The Government Savings Bank Bill.
On Thursday, Ist September, 1870, Mr. Saul Samuel,
Colonial Treasurer, introduced a Bill “ to grant additional
facilities for depositing small savings at interest with the
security of the Government for the due repayment thereof.”


The proposed bank, although on the lines of the Post
Office Savings Banks in England, was to be called the “ Govern-
ment Savings Bank ” because it was thought that it might
be necessary to use the services of other persons besides post-
masters in the conduct of its affairs. Long-sighted wisdom !
Opposition to the Measure.
Opponents of the measure argued that the Savings Bank
of New South Wales already offered ample facilities for saving,
and that this new institution would enter into injurious com-
petition with it. Even so, there were other means of saving—-
the various banking establishments would take deposits as low
as £5 and give 5 per cent, per annum on them.
Some questioned the wisdom of diverting from the existing
banks the money which small traders and the working class
were in the habit of investing with them.
The most persistent objections, however, were firstly,
that the measure was an experiment prompted by a desire on
the part of the Colonial Treasurer to borrow large sums of
money not subject to Parliamentary vote, and, secondly, that
country postmasters (in many cases storekeepers receiving only
£l2 a year) were not desirable officers for positions as agents.
It offered a temptation to defalcations, the critics held. Others
protested that the Government was bound to lose heavily by
the scheme.
The Bill Assented to.
After being for a long time “ grounded among the shallows
of the Upper House ” (as the “ Sydney Morning Herald ”
put it) the Bill was assented to on the 6th of April, 1871 —Act
34 Viet., No. 15. It was typical of the institution that the Act
should be brief, comprising only sixteen simple clauses.
The preamble ran :
"... it is expedient to enlarge the facilities now available
for the deposit of small savings and to give the direct security
of the Consolidated Revenue to every such depositor for re-
payment of all moneys so deposited.”
The provisions of the Act were briefly :
1. The Governor could appoint “ any Post-master or other
officer of the Post Office or the Shipping Master at any Port
within the Colony to receive deposits for remittance to the
G.P.O. and to repay same under such regulations as the
Governor may prescribe.”

2. Deposits to be of not less than I/-, nor more than £2OO,
and not more than £2OO could stand to the credit of any one
account.
3. Deposits were repayable within 10 days after demand
for repayment.
4. The names of depositors could not be disclosed.
5. Deposits had to be paid into the Treasury and re-
paid thereout.
6. Any deficiency could be made up out of Consolidated
Revenue.
7 and 8. Interest not to exceed 4 per cent, per annum and
to be added on the 31st December in every year.
9 and 10. Minors and married women could have accounts
under certain conditions.
11. Accounts of the “Penny Savings Banks” could be
transferred to the new Bank.
12, 13, 14. Regulations to be compiled ; accounts to be
prepared annually, examined by the Auditor-General and laid
before both Houses of Parliament.
15 and 16. Purely formal.
The Bank Commences Operations .
On the Ist September, 1871, the Bank commenced business
in the old weatherboard post-office in Wynyard Square, just
opposite what was then Horner’s Hotel, The old post-office
was a long, ramshackle, one-storied building, and, being only
erected for temporary purposes, was lined on the inside with
calico and paper. It was insufferably hot in summer, and the
risk from fire was very great. One portion of Wynyard Square
at that time was a paddock, from which horses left for agist-
ment used occasionally to find their way on to the wide wooden
verandah of the post-office at night, making so much noise as
to keep the residents awake. The first comptroller was Mr.
Frank W. Hill. The Bank’s business for the first day was 13
new accounts opened and £3Ol deposited. At the end of
September it had 79 accounts and £1,622 deposits, which by
the 31st December had increased to 283 accounts and £14,226
deposits. Its growth from then on was fairly rapid, as the
following figures show :

1881 586,496

1896 4,372,965

First Bill for Amalgamation of the Rival Banks.
From the time the Bank was formed in 1871 an amalgama-
tion with the Savings Bank of N.S.W. seemed inevitable. In
1881 a Bill to amalgamate the two Banks was actually introduced
—but was not proceeded with.


CHAPTER VII.
THE RUNS OF 1892 AND 1893
Prosperity Preceding 1893.
For five or six years preceding 1893 the State enjoyed a
period of great prosperity. The Government borrowed on a
lavish scale ; the trading banks canvassed England and Scot-
land for deposits on which they paid unduly high rates of in-
terest and money poured into their coffers. Speculation was
rife ; more money was lent on many properties than they were
worth ; bogus companies were formed, of which some did
little more than speculate in their own shares.
No stringency had manifested itself in the early part of
1892, however, nor yet the least trace of uneasiness among the
depositors of the Bank. This makes the run of that year all the
more remarkable.
The Run of 1892.
On Wednesday, 10th February, 1892, there came a bolt
from the blue. For some unaccountable reason, withdrawals
totalled £16,221 as compared with £6,512 the week before.
That same evening, a mob-orator, harangued the unemployed,
from the Queen’s statue. His theme was the way in which the
worker contributed to the wealth of the capitalist and his
principal contention was that the thrifty worker who saved
money and placed it in a bank only conferred a benefit on the
capitalist who was enabled to borrow cheaply and invest the
money at a rate of interest out of all proportion to the rate he
paid. According to a newspaper report, the speaker said that
only that day he had heard that “ the Savings Bank in Barrack
Street had ‘ gone bung ’ ! ”
Such a statement among the idlers from the wharves
and the unemployed from Miller’s Point caused immediate
alarm. The following morning a crowd of over 3,500 surged
round the entrance of the Bank—simultaneously a run de-
veloped on the Southern Branch. The report of the scare,
which appeared in the “ Sydney Morning Herald ” at the time,
makes interesting reading and shows that the scare was not,
apparently, without a humourous side.

“A characteristic feature of the crowd,” said the “ Herald,”
“ was the evident determination of the women to push and
persevere until admittance was gained, at least within the outer
iron gate, where policemen stood on guard, and yet, from the
density of the crush, it would be apparent that hours must be
spent in waiting. A husband was heard gently to hint to his
better-half that it was all safe, but the intense look of deter-
mination to wait and win taught him wisely to retire. Old and
young women, mothers with infants in their arms, and even
very aged persons remained transfixed to the neighbourhood
of the gate, whilst the roadway was thronged with men,
idlers, friends of the women and persons of all grades in
society ’
Towards 4 o’clock the Hon. George Thornton, Vice-
President of the Bank, addressed the crowd from the balcony
above the entrance. “He instantly was met with orderly
silence,” the “ Herald ” report went on, “ and his words had an
immediate quietening effect, followed by a thinning and
gradual dispersion of at least one-third of the number of
anxious depositors.”
Friendly relationships existed between the Savings Bank
of New South Wales and the trading banks, with whom the
Savings Bank had continually invested a considerable amount
of money on Fixed Deposit. The Managers of the trading banks
immediately signed a document expressing their confidence in
the Institution and their readiness to pay its debts in gold.
By the irony of Fate, some of those same banks were to fail the
following year.
Public confidence was restored, and people were soon as
anxious to deposit money as they had been to withdraw it.
The following figures indicate the extent of the run :
On Saturday morning and night the receipts amounted to
£16,040/19/3 and payments to £5,360/12/9, the previous
Saturday’s payments being £4,198/5/11.
This ephemeral crisis brought no ill effects : indeed, from
the safe eminence of the present day, it might almost be termed
a providential dress rehearsal for the really serious, though no
better founded, run which was to follow.


Run on the Savings Bank of N.S.W. (1893).


The Crisis of 1893.
Although in 1893 the Bank was in a sound condition, there
developed a feeling of insecurity among the depositors, for
again some thoughtless person worked up a scare against the
Bank. There was a wild rush of depositors to withdraw their
money.
Looking at Barrack Street the first morning of the run it
seemed as if every depositor were there. The street was one
dense mass of people. No bank on earth can pay every creditor
at such brief notice, and this time, in view of the parlous
condition of the other banks, things were really serious.
Sir George Dibbs’ Action.
Suddenly through the crowd a big burly figure fought
his way. It was none other than Sir George Dibbs, the Colonial
Secretary ! Arrived at the door-step after a fierce tussle through
the crowd (some say he mounted a gin case), he said, “You are
mostly poor people, I know, who have left your earnings here,
and to make assurance doubly sure for you, the Government
has determined that you shall have the country’s guarantee
that every pound you have in the Bank shall be repaid in gold.”
The “ Bulletin,” describing the incident years later, said,
“ Under the circumstances Parkes would have called for six
reports and have written a weighty minute. Reid would have
prepared a fine electioneering speech to denounce the infamy
of the Savings Bank trustees in letting the Bank down and would
have stumped the country on it. Dibbs jostled his way down
to the Bank and into the board room and faced a group of
officials paralysed with fright. ‘ Bring me a sheet of paper !
he said. Such was the confusion that it took awhile to get even
that, and Dibbs swore his fine, healthy Australian swears.
* Stick that Outside ’ /
“ The paper brought, Sir George scrawled out a Proclama-
tion that the Government guaranteed every penny of depositors’
money in the Savings Bank. ‘ Stick that outside ’ ! he said,
waiting neither for Cabinet Meetings nor His Excellency the
Rubber Stamp.”
The proclamation referred to read :
‘ Depositors in the Savings Bank of N.S.W. will be
guaranteed and paid in full by the Government.’ ”
G. R. DIBBS, Colonial Secretary.


To ensure greater liquidity Dibbs also promised that
£400,000 of the Bank’s Government securities should be re-
payable in cash on demand. These were the only variations
ever made to the Government guarantee of £50,000 included
in the Act of 1843, an important fact to bear in mind when
considering the bitter arguments for and against the amalgama-
tion of the old Barrack Street Savings Bank with the Govern-
ment Savings Bank of New South Wales.
How the Government Savings-Bank of N.S.IV. Fared.
The Government Savings Bank of N.S.W., during this
trying period, benefitted to a considerable extent. It is almost
axiomatic that when private enterprise is failing, securities with
a Government guarantee are sought in inverse ratio. Conse-
quently the deposits of the Government Savings Bank increased
tremendously. Indeed at this time there was delivered through
the back door of the Barrack Street Bank the money paid into
the Government Savings Bank by those people who had with-
drawn their savings from the former institution and lodged
them with the latter.
The Government Savings Bank took over £300,000 in
notes during this run on the Barrack Street Bank.


CHAPTER VIII.
THE IDEAL OF A NATIONAL BANK
(1893)
Appointment of a Select Committee.
The vision of a State Bank had been before men’s minds
for a number of years before the banking crisis of 1893. When
Mr. (later Sir) Joseph Carruthers stood for Parliament in 1887,
at the age of thirty, he made the formation of a State Bank the
chief plank in his political platform.
In 1893, the Government appointed a Select Committee
to report upon the expediency of establishing a National Bank,
and the advisability of converting the “ Post Office Savings
Bank ” (as the Government Savings Bank was then known)
for that purpose.
Amalgamation Recommended.
The Committee examined many important witnesses,
including the General Managers of most of the trading banks,
and after making exhaustive enquiries reported that: “After
careful consideration they were of the opinion that a Bank of
Issue was not only expedient, but urgently desirable.” They
recommended that the bank should be a Government Bank of
Deposit and should have a General Banking Department.
It should adopt a Cash Credit and Land Credit System. The
Committee further recommended that “ The Post Office
Savings Bank should become a part of the National Bank and be
absorbed in it,” as also “ the New South Wales Savings Bank
which should cease separately to exist." * The amalgamation of
these two banks,” the report continued, “ would be a pre-
liminary step to annulling their present limitations, and the
extension of their functions. Amalgamated, they would con-
stitute the germ from which the growth and extension of the
functions of the National Bank would be gradually introduced
and established.”


Report Adopted.
The Report was adopted in the House by a large majority
and for a while the shadow of this National Bank was well
defined. Then came the first glimmerings of the dawn of
Federation and the shadow of a State Bank slowly dissolved
to leave more distinctly visible the outline of an institution
catering for the needs of the continent as a whole rather than
for one part of it, namely, a Commonwealth Bank.

CHAPTER IX.
THE GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK AS A
SUB-DEPARTMENT OF THE STATE TREASURY
(1901)
When the Commonwealth Acquired the Post Offices.
From the date of its establishment until the end of 1900
the Government Savings Bank was administered as a Sub-
Department of the Post Office. In 1901, when the Post Office
passed to the Commonwealth on Federation, it became a Sub-
Department of the State Treasury.
In 1903 the Federal Government required the full use of the
Post Office premises and pressed the Bank to find fresh offices.
In any case, new premises were sorely needed, for at that time
the work of the Bank was conducted in only four rooms, and as
there were about 250,000 open accounts, customers sometimes
had to wait a long while before they could be attended to.
The Bank Finds a New Home.
It was not until 1905 that it was possible to lease a suitable
building. That year the Government obtained the lease of a
building specially built for the purpose, by the Citizens’ Life
Assurance Company, in Moore Street, a few hundred yards
from the Bank’s old home. The lease was for 10 years, with an
option of purchase.
Describing the new premises, the “ Daily Telegraph **
(6th April, 1905) said :
“ The new rooms are commodious and have been suitably
furnished for the purpose. The accommodation for the public
is on the ground floor, and here there is much more space for the
transaction of business than was the case in the Post Office
Building. Not only so, but the Money Order Office still re-
maining in the Post Office, all the space in the Moore Street
building is available for Savings Bank business. In the base-
ment there is a strong-room, and provision made for stores
and a large number of valuable documents have been placed
there. On the first floor the Comptroller and his staff are
located, while on the second floor the accounts of the country
agents are dealt with. There are two other floors, and rooms
for the caretakers, so that there is provision for a growing


business. It has been arranged that all payments shall be
made ‘ at sight.’ This will include country accounts, and will
no doubt be found a great convenience. Owing to the extra
work involved it has been found necessary to take on 10
junior clerks.”
The Moore Street building was opened to the public on
April 3rd, 1905. Some years later the street name was changed,
and the building came to be known as “ 19-23 Martin Place.”
“ Not a Legitimate Bank! ”
Prior to 1906 the funds of the Bank were held by the State
Treasurer as Trust Funds. This procedure was occasionally
criticised, and in the Legislative Council the Bank was even
described by one speaker as “ another of those illegitimate
scions, burly and strong, and perfectly satisfactory as far as it
had gone —a magnificent contribution to confidence, but not a
legitimate bank.”
How different from the present day !


CHAPTER X.
THE GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK ACT
OF 1906
Wider Scope Afforded.
It was felt by many that as a Sub-department of the
State Treasury the Bank was hampered in its operations.
To overcome this, therefore, an Act was passed (Government
Savings Bank Act, No. 48) which gave it considerably wider
scope. That Act, indeed, was the most momentous in its
history : it lifted the Bank out of the narrow confines of a
Government Department, under the control of an official of the
Treasury, and vested its control in a Board of three Com-
missioners, who were expected to exploit the greater oppor-
tunities now afforded to the utmost.
No longer were its funds to be Trust Funds under Treasury
control, for by the new Act it was given extensive powers of
investment.
The Advances to Settlers' Board was absorbed, to become
the Advances Department.
The First Commissioners.
The first Commissioners to be appointed were Mr.
Alexander Macintosh (previously General Manager of the
National Bank of New Zealand); Mr. P, E. Williams
(Comptroller of the Bank under the old regime) and Mr. W. H.
O’Malley Wood (former Chairman of the Advances to Settlers
Board).
Mr, Macintosh retired in 1908 and was succeeded as
President by Mr. R. A. Warden. In 1909 Mr. Williams retired
and was succeeded by Mr. H. D. Hall, who had previously been
Chief Inspector. When Mr. Warden retired in 1919, Mr. W. H.
O’Malley Wood was made President and Mr. J. H. Davies
(previously Secretary) was appointed a Commissioner.
Reciprocity with other States and the United Kingdom.
In 1908 a system of reciprocity with the Savings Banks of
other States was introduced, under which every facility has
been afforded to depositors travelling from one State to another.


In 1909 this system was extended to the Post Office Savings
Bank of the United Kingdom. At the end of the first year,
£4,501/14/8 had been transferred to Great Britain and
£5,132/4/- had been received from there.
Absorption by the Commonwealth Bank?
Following the passing of the Commonwealth Bank Act in
1911 a conference was held between representatives of the
different State Governments to discuss the expediency of an
absorption of the State Savings Banks by the new Common-
wealth Bank. The representatives of the New South Wales
Government insisted that the State should have a say in the
management of the absorbing bank. To this the Common-
wealth representative refused to agree and there the matter
ended.
The Transfer from the Post Offices.
On July 3rd, 1912, the Commonwealth Executive Council
decided that the agreement under which the Bank used the
Post Offices as agencies should terminate on December 31st,
1912. To provide against this day the Commissioners sent ten
officers all over the State to make arrangements for the
establishment of new agencies and in 1913 the Bank finally
severed its connections with the Post Office.
Policy of Decentralization.
From 1907 onwards the Bank demonstrated the excellence
of its constitution by its remarkable expansion. When the first
Commissioners took charge, all the depositors’ ledgers were
kept at the Head Office, Country depositors were at a serious
disadvantage in respect of quick withdrawals. The 601 agencies
were merely offices receiving deposits, and paying withdrawals
only on authority from Head Office. By the end of 1914, no
less that 131 branches, giving all the facilities previously only
enjoyed by Sydney depositors, were open for business in the
leading country towns and suburbs. There were, in addition,
510 agencies.
Much has been said for and against this policy of de-
centralization. Surely the strongest argument in its favour, and
the best proof of the Bank’s success under the new Act, are to
be found in the following table :

CHAPTER XI.
THE AMALGAMATION OF THE SAVINGS BANK
OF N.S.W. WITH THE GOVERNMENT SAVINGS
BANK OF N.S.W. (1914)
The Rival Banks .
From 1871 the two savings banks, the Savings Bank of
New South Wales and the Government Savings Bank of New
South Wales, competed side by side. They were like two
streams which, commencing from different sources, flowed
parallel for a long stretch, finally to join and form one big river
which gained impetus and volume from the junction.
As soon as the project of a Post Office Savings Bank was
mooted the ultimate amalgamation of the two Banks seemed
inevitable.
On 12th August, 1881, Mr. James Watson, Colonial
Treasurer, moved in the Legislative Assembly :
“ That it is expedient to bring in a Bill to establish a
general savings bank, with Government guarantee, by the
amalgamation of the Savings Bank of New South Wales with
the Government Savings Bank.”
The Bill was never presented, though introduced twice,
and on a change of government in 1883 the matter was allow ed
to lapse.
As related in the previous chapter the amalgamation was
definitely recommended by the Select Committee of 1893. In
1896 the Reid administration, with that recommendation in
mind, brought down a bill to amalgamate the Savings Banks
and amend the laws relating thereto. Sir George Dibbs,
however, whose services to the Bank during the run of 1893
will be remembered, had just lost his seat in the House, and had
straightway been nominated for the position of Managing
Trustee. For years Sir George Dibbs and Mr. Reid had been
political opponents (Sir George Dibbs was Colonial Treasurer
when Mr. Reid was in Opposition) and the proposed amal-
gamation was at once denounced as an attempt on the part of
Mr. Reid to deprive his old political opponent of a lucrative


position. Whether from a spirit of chivalry or what, the Bill
was not proceeded with. Agitation continued, however, and
the amalgamtion became a plank of the Labour platform.
Arguments for Amalgamation
Those who favoured amalgamation pointed out that the
continuance of both banks meant unnecessary duplication and
harmful competition. The very constitution of the Barrack
Street Bank hampered its efficient conduct. For example, at
Newcastle, a branch with a large number of depositors, there
were a well paid manager and his assistant. These officers
were there all day and every day, yet, because the Act required
the presence of a trustee whenever business was transacted,
they were only able to open for business three hours a week
(an hour on Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday evenings) and
then outside business hours, because it was only outside
business hours that they could get an honorary trustee to attend.
It was held, moreover, that the trustees of the Bank were partisan
in their business dealings. For example, in 1902, when the
Government required a loan, the trustees debated the measure,
making it a party question among themselves. Repayment of
deposits was only guaranteed up to £50,000 (though morally,
it would seem, in view of the action by Sir George Dibbs
during the run of 1893, the Government was responsible for
the repayment of all deposits).
Arguments Against Amalgamation.
Opponents of the proposal feared that the amalgamation
was an attempt on the part of the Government to take pos-
session of the funds of the Barrack Street depositors to satisfy
Treasury requirements. What guarantee had anyone that
those funds would be properly safeguarded, it was asked.
The affairs of the Barrack Street Bank were controlled by
eighteen business men (albeit they were nominated by the
Government), but the funds of the Government Savings Bank
were controlled by a Treasury Official.
Barrack Street Bank Placed on a Better Footing.
In 1902 Mr. T. Rose introduced a Bill to amalgamate the
two Banks, but again the attempt was unsuccessful. Two Acts,
however, were passed (53 and 99 of 1902) which repealed the
obsolete provisions under which the Savings Bank of New
South Wales laboured, and which gave it greater scope. The
offices of the District Trustees were abolished.


An Entirely New Bank.
In 1904 another attempt was made to combine the two
Banks. A Bill was introduced by Mr. (later Sir) Joseph
Carruthers, by which it was proposed to constitute a totally
new bank. The Advances to Settlers Board Act was to be
repealed and the Board absorbed by the new bank together
with the Savings Bank of New South Wales and the Govern-
ment Savings Bank. The Legislative Council, however,
refused to sanction this absorbtion of the affairs of the Barrack
Street Bank by an institution which was as yet untried.
The “ Sydney Morning Herald ” and “ The Daily
Telegraph ” were fiercely hostile to the proposal.
Attempt to Amalgamate in 1906.
In 1906 Sir Joseph Carruthers again introduced a Bill for
the amalgamation of the two Banks, subject to a favourable poll
of depositors of the Barrack Street Bank. As before, the Bill
provided for the absorption of the Advances to Settlers Board.
The Legislative Council rejected the clause providing for the
amalgamation, although they passed the rest of the highly
important measure which became the “ Government Savings
Bank Act of 1906 ” (already discussed at length in Chapter Ten).
The success of the Government Savings Bank of New
South Wales after its absorption of the Advances to Settlers
Board, and its reconstruction under the control of three
Commissioners, removed all doubts and anxieties from the
minds of the public. They were persuaded by now that the
Institution was productive of really good results.
A Poll on the Question.
For a time, however, it looked as though any attempt to
amalgamate the two Banks had been abandoned. Then in 1911
interest in the subject was suddenly revived. The trustees of
the Barrack Street Bank decided to take a poll of deporitors on
the question. Every facility was given depositors to vote.
Envelopes were sent to them, stamped and addressed, to be
returned to the Bank. Their numbers were filled in, and all
they had to do was to write “ Yes ” or “ No ” and sign their
names. Strangely enough some of these referendum papers
were placed into the Government Savings Bank letter-box and
had to be sent from there to the Barrack Street Bank, so great
w T as the general confusion in the public mind. With the ballot
papers was sent a letetr explaining the proposed conditions of
the amalgamation.


The result of the referendum was as follows :
Number of Votes counted 70,225
Noes 50,290
Yes •• 18,624
Informal 1,311
Majority Against 31,666
While the poll was in progress a Bill (in anticipation of
which the poll was taken) was introduced by the Hon. A. C.
Carmichael. It was intituled “ a Bill to dissolve the Savings
Bank of New South Wales and vest the property, rights and
liabilities of the said Bank in the Government Savings Bank of
New South Wales.” Incidentally, the measure provided for
the creation of a “ Homes Advance Department on the lines
of similar institutions already existing in other States. Strong
opposition developed, which resulted in the defeat of the
whole measure. *
In 1912 a similar Bill, with minor amendments, was again
introduced. By now both Banks were paying the same rate of
interest, but the Bill was defeated on the second reading in
the Legislative Council.
The Commonwealth Bank enters the Field.
The year 1911, however, heralded an event which had an
important bearing on the question. The Commonwealth
Bank Act, providing for the establishment of a Savings Bank
Department, was passed and it was evident that the Common-
wealth Government intended to turn the Governments Savings
Bank out of the Post Offices. Here was a pretty pass, the
prospect of three Savings Banks competing for business in
towns where already two branches of the existing Banks were
operating side by side ! Already considerable confusion existed
and enquiries were frequently addressed to the wrong bank,
causing delay and loss of time.
By now every-one was satisfied that the Government
Savings Bank was more successful than the Savings Bank of
New South Wales. In 1912 the Government Savings Bank
increased its deposits by a considerably bigger percentage
than the Barrack Street Institution. The number of depositors
was increased by a higher percentage also. The Government
Savings Bank established 30 branches in four years as against
the few opened by the other Bank in the whole time of its
existence. Further, a depositor could have £5OO in the Govern-
ment Savings Bank and only up to £2OO in the Barrack Street
Bank. Many had accounts in both.


How the Staff would fare on Amalgamation.
With the prospect of losing the services of the Post Office
and the steady expansion of the Government Savings Bank’s
business it was urgently necessary to still further increase the
number of branches. Since it was necessary to find men to
staff these branches, the amalgamation would enable the
Commissioners of the Government Savings Bank of N.S.W.
to utilise the services of all the officers of the Barrack Street
Bank.
At the political meetings prior to the elections in 1914 the
question was discussed from every platform. Interest rates
could be adjusted ; the staff of the Barrack Street Bank had
nothing to fear (indeed by now the great majority of them
favoured an amalgamation); and the Government Savings
Bank was a proved success.
The Amalgamating Act.
Finally, therefore, in 1914 an Act (No. 6,1914) was passed
which provided for the dissolution of the Savings Bank of New
South Wales and the vesting of its property in the Com-
missioners of the Government Savings Bank. Thus after years
of jealousy and struggle to preserve the entity of an institution
which had its origin in the early days of our history, the Savings
Bank of New South Wales was absorbed by one better suited,
by virtue of its constitution, to cater for the needs of the thrifty
people of the State.
Trustees Gracious Minute.
At their final meeting in April, 1914, the trustees of the
old Bank passed the following minute :
“As the Savings Bank of New South Wales will cease its
existence after the 30th instant and will thereafter be amalga-
mated with the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales,
the Trustees desire to make the following announcement to de-
positors and the public generally :
‘The Trustees felt that in protesting against the amalgama-
tion they did all that was possible to preserve the separate
existence of the old institution so favourably know r n as the
Savings Bank of New South Wales, but now that the Legislature
of the State has decided that the amalgamation should be ac-
complished, the Trustees hope that the patronage which has
been given to the Barrack Street Savings Bank of New South
Wales will be continued under the new regime, as they feel
that the basis of the amalgamation as embodied in the Act is as
fair a proposal to both depositors and staff as could be ex-
pected.’ ”


Wellington Branch.


The Amalgamated Bank the Second Largest in the Empire.
“ We have pleasure in stating that the amalgamated Bank
will have the honour of being the second largest Savings Bank
in the Empire, being exceeded only by the Post Office Savings
Bank of the United Kingdom. The arrangements made for
the business of the united bank after the amalgamation, which
have been the result of conferences between the two in-
stitutions, will, the trustees are confident, result in greatly
increased facilities to the depositors in both Banks, and the
public generally. The guarantees given in the Amalgamation
Act in relation to depositors’ interest are of a very satisfactory
nature, and there is every probability that, given normal
financial conditions the rate of interest which has been fixed
at 3£ per cent, up to £2OO, will be continued for 10 years
under the provisions of the Act. The Government guarantee
covering the entire funds of the Bank will, in addition to the
reserve funds brought over from both institutions, provide
to all depositors the highest security possible.
“ The Trustees desire also to place on record their very
full appreciation of the loyal and efficient services rendered to
them and the Bank’s objects at all times by the Managing
Trustee, Mr. David Mitchell, and staff, and sincerely hope that
the change about to be made in the control will not be detri-
mental to their future. The Trustees, as their final act, com-
mend the new amalgamated Bank to existing depositors and
the public generally wdth every confidence.”
As a result of the amalgamation with the Savings Bank of
New South Wales in 1914 balances totalling £8,535,266 were
added to the Government Savings Bank deposits.
Adjustment of Interest Rates.
Immediately prior to the amalgamation the Government
Savings Bank was paying 3| per cent, interest. It was agreed
that for ten years Barrack Street depositors should receive
per cent, more than Government Savings Bank depositors,
unless the latter were receiving 3| per cent., when the rates
should be equal. For this reason both classes of depositors
were paid 3| per cent, interest from the date of the
amalgamation.

CHAPTER XII.
RECENT YEARS
The Blast of War.
On August 4th, 1914, came that reverberating declaration
which shook the world to its foundations. War, or the rumour of
war, upsets public confidence at once, and alarm was still more
increased on this occasion because—since it was Bank Holiday
—the doors of the Bank were closed ! Suspicion spread. The
following day anxious depositors thronged Martin Place.
Officials of the Bank addressed the crowd to allay their fears,
but for a while, withdrawals were heavy. Some of the Bank’s
Fixed Deposits with the trading banks had to be withdrawn in
cash, and only by this means was the Bank able to meet demands
and gradually restore public confidence.
Confidence Restored.
When confidence was restored, after the first frenzy of
fear, deposits leapt ahead, as the following table shows :
Agencies for Soldiers.
During the War agencies were opened at the various
Military Training Camps in N.S.W. Arrangements were made
with the Military Pay Department whereby troops serving
abroad could deposit with the Bank by making a direction on
their “ Pay Allotment ’’form. The troops were also enabled to
withdraw money in London (where an agency was established
at the Agent General’s Office in 1916), Cairo, Alexandria, and
Valetta (Malta).
The Return of Peace.
With the return of Peace, progress was naturally even
greater, though here it must be borne in mind that the progress

symbolised by figures is affected by the fact that the purchasing
power of the pound fell greatly. However, the following table
shows the statistical expansion up to date :
Tours Abroad.
In 1923 Mr. Commissioner Hall, accompanied by Mr. A. W.
Turner (at that time Secretary of the Bank) went abroad to
study Savings Bank and Agricultural Bank methods and to
gather ideas for incorporation in the new Head Office building.
Three years later Mr. R. W. May (then Chief Inspector)
represented the Bank at a Savings Bank Conference in Phila-
delphia, U.S.A. Thus personal contact was effected with
representatives of Savings Banks from nearly every country of
the world, and the Bank was richer by the useful knowledge
gained.
Thrift Service Department.
The trend of personal and domestic finance has altered so
materially of recent years (as evidenced by the phenomenal
increase of instalment selling) that Savings Banks have been
obliged to adapt their methods to meet the altered conditions.
In 1927 the Bank, awake to this new need, established a Thrift
Service Department, under the control of Miss Janet Mitchell,
8.A., a specialist in Thrift.
The Bank is an earnest advocate of budgeting, and places
Miss Mitchell’s services at the disposal of all who seek guidance
as to their personal and domestic finance, whether they are
depositors or not, without cost. It is significant that Miss
Mitchell’s counsel has been sought by many hundreds of
persons whose incomes vary from the lowest award wages to
(in one instance) more than £3,000 a year, and even by such
institutions as country hospitals.


Definite Object System.
During 1928 a new system of thrift collections was intro-
duced, known as the “ Definite Object ” system. By it the
Bank goes right to the heart of the factory, shop or office and
provides a means of saving the small sums which, too often
otherwise, are wasted. The depositor contracts to regularly
deposit specified amounts for a certain period, and to make no
withdrawals unless through an unforseen emergency. The
deposits are placed in a special envelope and dropped in
collecting-boxes, installed by the Bank, which are cleared at
regular intervals. So far the system has produced encouraging
results.
School Savings Bank.
School Savings Banks in N.S.W. are not of recent origin.
In fact, they were established, after careful deliberation, some
years before the beginning of this century. At one time the
school-teachers kept all the records and each school had, in
effect, its own self-contained bank. On 2nd January, 1925, as
a result of representations made by the Government, the School
Savings Banks were transferred to the Bank’s control and
20,773 accounts, with balances totalling £11,434 were taken
over. The Bank now keeps the accounts, enters the deposits
from a list furnished by the teachers, and pays withdrawals
separately. The hearty co-operation of the teachers has
accounted for the success of this system (at 30th June, 1929
there were 114,533 accounts for a total of £169,380) which has
assured to the Bank a steady increase of new depositors every
year. “ Train up a child in the way he should go ; and when
he is old he will not depart from it.”
Lay-by Accounts.
In February, 1929, a system of “ Lay-by” Accounts was
introduced. The purpose of this system is to enable depositors
to save amounts for definite objectives, such as holidays,
season ticket, rates and taxes, etc., and to keep these “ objective”
savings separate from their regular savings bank accounts. No
limit is placed on the number of Lay-by Accounts one may
open, and all earn interest at the Bank’s ordinary rate. To
30th June, 1929, 978 Lay-by Accounts had been opened.
Home Savings Banks.
The Bank has always been solicitous for its young or less
affluent depositors. In 1910 the “ Home Savings Bank ”


Dubbo Branch,


system was inaugurated, and in the ten years from Ist July
1919 to 30th June, 1929, 224,000 Money Boxes were opened
and the contents, totalling £419,200 credited to depositors’
accounts. The Commissioners believe that the money box the
teller pushes across the counter to the eager youngster may
contain the germ of a man’s financial independence and a
happy home.
The Bank's Advertising .
These are but a few evidences of the Bank’s strenuous
efforts to fulfil its objects. The encouragement of thrift is at
once a difficult undertaking—since self-denial is not a natural
tendency—and a delicate responsibility—since it involves the
spending habits of the whole State. In the past century this
responsibility was shared (in fact almost entirely undertaken) by
others, but to-day the moralists are almost dumb, and the
Bank must undertake its task alone.
Of recent years the advertising of its services has improved
enormously, and the ink of future chapters in its historv will, of
necessity, have to be tinged still more deeply with ably con-
ceived and well directed publicity.
A Head Office Beautiful.
The opening of the Bank’s new Head Office in 1928 was
a land mark in its history. When it first occupied the old
building in Moore Street (later Martin Place) the Bank was
able to sub-let some of the upper floors. Gradually, however,
it took over the whole building, which in the last few years
became seriously congested. The Commissioners had an-
ticipated this expansion, and in 1920 and 1921 they bought five
adjacent strips of land lying between Castlereagh Street and
Elizabeth Street, north from the “ Sun ” Office, with frontages
of 280 feet approximately to both streets and a through average
depth of 150 feet. It was originally intended that the new
Head Office should have only two frontages ; one to each
street, but after much deliberation the City Council decided to
extend Martin Place through a portion of the site bought by the
Bank. Building operations had been held up pending this
decision and the design had now to be altered, a third face,
fronting Martin Place, being added.
Contents of the Three Foundation Stones.
Three foundation stones were laid on the 13th of March,
1922, by the Premier, Mr. J. Dooley ; the Colonial Treasurer,


Mr. J. T. Lang and the President of the Bank, Mr. W. H.
O’Malley Wood. Glass receptacles containing the Common-
wealth Year Book, samples of our coinage and a copy of the
day’s programme were sealed in each of the foundation stones
by Messrs. Commissioners H. D. Hall and J. H. Davies.
Safe Deposit Vaults.
One feature of the building on completion was the Safe
Deposit Vaults. The provision of these was a further mani-
festation of the Bank’s readiness to render useful service, the
aim being to provide Safe Deposit facilities within the reach of
all. The Vaults were equipped with a 30-ton steel door and
protected by thick concrete walls, re-inforced by laminated
metal. They are surrounded by a cleverly designed patrol
passage. On completion the Vaults were the largest and most
efficient in the Southern Hemisphere.
Official Opening.
The official opening of the new building was performed
on the 13th of December, 1928, by the Premier (Mr. T. R.
Bavin). There was a large and representative gathering to
witness the ceremony.
On a cleared space outside the main door the retiring
President (Mr. O’Malley Wood), attended bj the new
President (Mr. H. D. Hall) and the other Commissioners, met
the Premier and his wife and daughter.
Mrs. Bavin, wife of the Premier, cut the ribbon in front
of the door with a pair of gold scissors presented to her by the
President, thereby severing an electrical connection controlling
the door, which promptly at the appointed hour commenced
to open.
The open doorway revealed a view of the great Banking
Chamber, with its splendour of bronze and marble. Thronged
inside was an eager audience who had assembled there throug
other doors. “ I declare this Bank open for the transaction of
business ” said the Premier, and the official party proceeded
to a raised platform in a corner of the Banking Chamber.
In his speech Mr. Bavin said that the splendid building
was evidence of the progress made by the State and of the
peoples’ confidence in the institution. It was notable for its
strength, dignity and beauty, and the banking chamber itself
was one of the largest in the world. Besides embodying the


most modern requirements of banking business, it was so
designed that the lower cost of maintenance in future years
wou’d far more than offset the expense involved in the
construction, which had been criticised. The building was the
work of Australian craftsmen ; 98 per cent, of the material
used was also Australian.
The Act of 1928.
Mention has been made of “ the retiring Commissioners ”
for by Act 31, 1928, a Commissioner must retire on reaching
age 65. Both Messrs. W. H. O’Malley Wood and J. H. Davies
had passed this age and had to retire. Messrs. R. W. May
(formerly Chief Inspector) and A. W, Turner (Secretary)
were appointed to fill the vacancies thus created.
With the passing of the Act of 1928, the opening of a new
Head Office and the appointment of new Commissioners,
another chapter of the history has begun, not yet far enough
advanced to write about.


CHAPTER XIII.
THE ADVANCES FOR HOMES DEPARTMENT.
Making Home-owning Easier.
For many years the Bank did little more than act as a
repository for the peoples’ savings. Latterly, however, it has
branched out and undertaken important new activities.
Since 1914 it has enabled thousands who otherwise never
could have done so, to buy homes on easy terms.
The cumulative effect of this home-ownership on the
national psychology has been tremendous. With the privilege
of ownership comes responsibility. Interest in civic affairs has
been stimulated and, taking the primitive view, the instinct of
self-preservation has been quickened and national pride
intensified. “ Give a man something to lose and you give him
something to fight for.”
Victorian Legislation.
In 1910 the Victorian Legislative Assembly passed an
Act (1 Geo. V, 2280) extending the “ Credit Fonder ” system
to enable borrowers to buy homes for themselves on easy
terms. The measure was immediately popular. Many seized
the opportunity to cast off the “ landlord incubus,” and own
their own homes. The prudent man reasoned that rent was an
irrecoverable expense, whereas instalments on the purchase of a
home were a capital investment. If he should die before his home
were paid off, the balance after deducting the amount still
owing on the mortgage from the amount realized on the sale
of the property would represent a capital fund for the benefit
of the widow.
'Hie Hon. Arthur Griffith's Interest.
The Honourable Arthur Griffith, perceiving the wisdom
and popularity of the Victorian Act, promptly urged the
New South Wales Government to make similar provision in its
own Savings Bank Act. The difficulty in the way was a clause
in the Bank’s Act which read :

No .... loan shall be made upon the security of lands

of any city, town, or village, whether so declared by the proc-
lamation of the Governor or not so declared.”
The Homes Department Act.
The first attempt to delete this clause from the Act was
unsuccessful, for it was held by many that a time-payment
department of the Bank to finance the holding of property
would be a dangerous experiment. In 1913, however, an Act
was passed, which provided for advances for homes, and on
the Ist of July, 1914 the Advances for Homes Department
commenced operations.
When the Bill was in committee Mr. James Dooley moved
that J;he clause authorising the Commissioners to advance up
to 75 per cent, of the borrower’s interest in the holding be
amended to authorise the Commissioners to advance up to
90 per cent. Of course, he was greatly ridiculed, yet, in the few
years of its existence the Department has more than justified
its formation and effect was given in 1928 to Mr. Dooley’s
“ revolutionary ” idea I
The Department's Popularity.
The following figures best illustrate the Homes Depart-
ment’s rapid growth:
One sometime hears it said that the practice of long-term
lending adopted by the Australian Savings Banks “ ties up the
country s capital. Nevertheless, if a plebiscite were taken as to
whether these long term loan departments were justified and
should be retained, the result, judging by the figures of the
Homes Department, would never be in doubt.


CHAPTER XIV
THE RURAL BANK DEPARTMENT
An Early Ideal.
The agricultural success of a country to-day depends
largely on the standard of financial co-operation it affords its
farmers. Long before the banking crisis in 1893 men felt that
the Banks were not adequately financing the small-holder —
the back-bone of the country —and to remedy this defect they
strove to create an institution that would cater entirely for the
financial needs of the farmer.
Reference has already been made to the promise by Sir
Joseph Carruthers of a State Bank in 1887. Five years later
Carl Pinschof (then Consul for Austria-Hungary) delivered a
lecture before the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce on
“ The ‘ Credit Fonder ’ System.” In his prefatory remarks
Pinschof urged “ the advisability of a study of the system with a
view of its introduction into Australia at the earliest possible
opportunity.” Sir Joseph Carruthers and Mr. Pinschof may be
said to have sown the seed of the idea which was later to
germinate and blossom as the Rural Bank.
The Select Committee appointed in 1893 to enquire into
and report upon “ the expediency of establishing a National
Bank ” (see Chapter VIII.) definitely recommended the
formation of a State Bank, but the report was pigeon-holed.
Drought in the Nineties.
The first drought of any severity which followed the crisis
in 1893 left the settlers without anyone to whom they could
turn for relief in their period of distress. It seemed inevitable
that thousands must have been driven from the land. The
financial institutions of the State were loth to finance them :
they had had such a bad time themselves and required money
so speedily that they preferred to keep their business to strict
banking lines rather than to embark in the pursuit of money-
lending on landed securities.


The Advances to Settlers' Board.
If the Government had not established the Advances to
Settlers’Board in 1898 thousands of drought-stricken farmers
would have been forced to abandon their holdings and leave
their homes. Though the Act creating the Board was hurriedly
framed it unquestionably averted a catastrophe.
In 1906 Sir Joseph Carruthers, with the findings of the
1893 Committee still in mind, sought to establish a new bank
wffiich would absorb the Barrack Street Bank, the Advances to
Settlers’ Board and the Government Savings Bank (see Chapter
XI). There was such an outcry from those who were interested
in the welfare of the Barrack Street Bank—who urged that the
new bank would be saddled with a heavy debt because of the
absorption of the Advances to Settlers’ Board—-that the Legis-
lative Council rejected the clause providing for the
amalgamation of the Barrack Street Bank. The other pro-
visions were retained, it will be remembered, and on January
the Ist, 1907, the Advances to Settlers’ Board became the
Advances Department of the Bank and its Chairman, Mr. W.
H. O’Malley Wood, one of the first three Commissioners to
control the destinies of the Bank under its new Act.
It is easy to understand the concern which was felt for
the safety of the peoples’ savings following the absorption of
the Advances to Settlers’ Board, but experience has shown that
the assistance granted by the Board was not misplaced, as so
far not one penny has been lost.
The 1920 Stringency.
The year 1920 marked a period of financial stress when it
was most difficult for settlers to obtain the financial assistance
they required to enable them properly to develop the land
resources of the State. Most of the other countries of the
world had schemes for affording relief to their farmers in times
of crisis, enabling them to finance their harvesting and carry on
developmental work, but New South Wales lagged behind in
this respect. The combined ill-effects of post-war finance,
unfavourable weather conditions and the difficulties of repat-
riation were telling on the farmer.
The Rural Bank Bill.
On the 9th December, 1920, the Hon. Wm. F. Dunn, then
Minister for Agriculture, who had given the subject serious
study, introduced a Bill which would enable the Commissioners
to create a special department of the Bank to:


“ Grant overdrafts payable on demand to agricultural, pastoral,
rural or primary producers, or to persons carrying on industries im-
mediately associated with rural pursuits on the security of land, crops,
wool, stock, plant, machinery, personal security, guarantees by co-
operative credit associations, promissory notes, bills of exchange, or
any other security approved by the Commissioners.”
The measure proposed to use the existing machinery of
the Advance Department : it was really an extension of the
functions of that branch.
The press spoke encouragingly of the measure ; it was
well received in the House, and the Leader of the Opposition
(Mr. T. R. Bavin) congratulated the Minister for Agriculture
on the Bill. It went through the Legislative Council (where it
was championed by Sir Joseph Carruthers) without amendment.
Extent of the Department''s Operations.
It was felt on all sides that the Rural Bank would fill a
long-felt want. That it has done so is borne out by the
following facts : It commenced operations on the 20th April,
1921. Since then deposits have grown to £8,914,585 and the
sum of £2,372,950 has been raised by the issue of Stock and
Debentures. To the 30th June, 1929, farmers had been assisted
to the extent of £23,695,989. Of this amount £5,951,427 was
outstanding on long-term loans and mortgages, and £6,938,040
by way of overdrafts.
W. 11. O'Malley Wood.
No history of the Rural Bank would be complete without
reference to Mr. W. H. O’Malley Wood, who so capably
helped to crystallize the ideal of the bank which was for so
long illusory.
Born in 1856, he passed as a surveyor when twenty years
of age. In 1902 he was appointed Chairman of the Advances to
Settler’s Board, and became one of the first Commissioners of
the Bank on its reconstitution in 1907. He was appointed
President in 1920. Perhaps no higher tribute could be paid
him than that by Sir Joseph Carruthers : “He has always
taken an interest in farming, and to-day owns a farm of his
own. He was forn and bred on the land, knows the land laws,
knows men (that’s a great thing !); he is a man of parts and a
man of the world, with a w r onderful knowledge of anything
appertaining to the land.” For twenty-two years he gave every
ounce of his energy to the Bank and for his reward he had the
satisfaction of being the President of one of the most successful
savings banks in the Empire.


W. H. O’MALLEY WOOD


A big man physically and mentally, possessing indomitable
optimism, a rare poise of judgment and a marked tenacity of
purpose, he left his impress on every phase of the Bank’s
activities and his example has been an inspiration to every
member of the staff.


CHAPTER XV.
THE GOVERNMENT HOUSING DEPARTMENT
Origin of the Department.
In 1911 there was a pronounced scarcity of houses. To
remedy this Mr. J, R. Dacey (Colonial Treasurer) introduced a
Bill to provide for the establishment of a suburb beautiful
(“ Daceyville ”). The measure was an extensive one, but
it was returned from the Legislative Council in a much
reduced form. The Government, however, had to afford
some relief, and in 1912 Act No. 7 was passed providing for
the establishment of a Housing Board. At that time it was
intended to extend the Bank’s Act to permit the Bank to finance
the building of homes, and this new Board was originally
called into existence to assist the class of people who wanted
homes at a rental but were not prepared to buy a home on terms.
The Act of 1919.
The Board met with but indifferent success till 1919. In
that year, following the war period, there was again a serious
shortage of housing accommodation. During the war the
construction of houses practically ceased, and immediately
after the war building costs soared sky-high. At that time there
was a limit on the amount which the Bank could lend to home
builders. Instead of the Bank’s Act being amended, however,
provision was made, in an extension of the original Housing
Act, for the Treasury to earmark a portion of the surplus funds
invested with it by the Bank. The Housing Board was enabled
to make advances to assist purchasers and to act as a contractor
in the building of homes.
Transfer to the Bank.
In 1924 it was decided to obviate the existing unnecessary
duplication and to transfer the affairs of the Housing Board to
the Bank. By Act No. 27 of that year the affairs of the Board
became vested in the Commissioners of the Bank to be wound
up.
On the Ist April, 1925, the Bank took over loans totalling
£639,933/5/7. These loans are gradually being paid off, and
finally the Department will become extinct.


Relationship between Departments of the Bank.
There still remains one feature common to the Depart-
ments of the Bank to be explained, and that is their complete
independence. Though all Departments are administered by the
same Board, run by the same staff and housed in the same
buildings each is, as it were, a “ water-tight ” department,
entirely independent of the others. Any losses a Department
might make after all its reserves had been depleted would not be
deductible from the accumulated profits of the other Depart-
ments, but must be made good by the Government. By this
means the Savings Bank Department of the Bank finds a
useful outlet for its funds by investing them in Inscribed Stock
issued by the Rural Bank and Homes Departments. Since
these Departments are guaranteed against loss by the Govern-
ment, the Savings Bank may be said to have made a gilt-edged
investment in itself.


CHAPTER XVI.
THE STAFF
Scarcity of Early Records.
No history of the Bank would be complete without mention
of the staff, yet no records are so hard to find as those relating
to the men who, year by year, laid the fragments of their efforts
on the ever-growing pile, much as the countless polypes have
gone to form the ocean beds of coral. Now and then have
come men endowed with extra talents, or a high enthusiasm for
their work, but of the rest one can only speak in general terms.
The first advertisement for a Savings Bank Officer in
Australia appeared in “ The Sydney Monitor ” on 28th July,
1832. It read as follows :
NEW SOUTH WALES
SAVINGS BANK
A PERSON writing a good hand and well qualified to keep
accounts, is wanted to act as CLERK to this Institution. He will
be required to attend at the office of the Bank, from 8 to 10
o’clock, on every Monday morning, keep the books of account,
and attend all Meetings of the Trustees every Monday morning.
The Salary will be £SO per annum, payable quarterly. The
appointee will be required to find security, himself in £IOO
and two sufficient sureties in £SO each. Application to be made
in writing, addressed to William Macpherson, Esq., the Col-
lector of Internal Revenue, before 10 o’clock on Tuesday
morning the 31st instant, stating qualifications, with refer-
ences as to character.”
Early Requirements of a Savings Bank Official.
It is interesting to read the comments of the “ Sydney Gaz-
ette” (31st July, 1832) on this advertisement. A lengthy leader
was devoted to the subject.
“We think that the accountantship of this institution,”
said the “ Gazette,” “ will turn out to be an office of great
responsibility and considerable risk and we would argue, from
these considerations, that the remuneration paid to this
responsible officer should be such as to induce a man of tried
character and studious habits to devote a large share of his
time to the interests of the community in connection with
the working of this specific system of deposits. The accountant


Section of the Staff (1905).


of this institution ought to be a philanthropist and political
economist, in the true and heart-felt sense of the terms —who
should be able and willing to estimate the nature and amount
of the good accruing to the community from the proper
management of such an establishment. We hold that his office
might be made one of the most useful and important in this
community .... A right-minded and able man, who has
sincerely at heart the production of the greatest possible
amount of good in the midst of the community of which he is a
member, would have it in his power, if placed in this situation,
to be of more real service to the mass of the population through-
out the colony, than all the clergymen of all the denominations
of religious profession amongst us are capable of effecting by
their public, unwearied, and meritorious ministrations ....
“ The people require to be wooed into the formation of
saving and prudential habits, and were a man of influence,
such as we would consider fit for filling effectively the office
which we have to our eye, to betake himself con amore to the
business of philanthropy, he would soon find ways and means
of working a wonderful reformation throughout the different
grades of our present population.
“ When we speak of the Clerk or the Accountant of this
important institution .... we mean a man of enlarged and
enlightened philanthropy, who would feel it the delight of his
life to lay his shoulder actively to the wheel of social improve-
ment ; who (to speak a familiar but expressive phraseology)
would make it his hobby to methodize amongst the people
themselves inferior Banks —managed entirely by the depositors
of each little circle —which should issue a lodging in the
Parent or Government Bank, the veriest fraction that might be
saved out of the daily earnings of the lowest of the people :
And who would do more than this even ; who would feel a
degree of honourable pride in devising and recommending the
best methods of employing the moneys of the depositors, after
they should have reached a certain amount, so that every
depositor should at the earliest possible moment feel himself
possessor of something like real property, and have in con-
sequence a stake of growing importance in the welfare of
the community.”
Staff of the Old Savings Bank of N.S.W.
Fifty years ago the staff of the Savings Bank of N.S.W.
were, relatively, well paid. Their pay and conditions were
always determined by those prevailing in other Banks. Later,


however, diminishing profits necessitated reduced and less
frequent increases to bank salaries. Later still, when the
various banks sustained heavy losses, conditions for the different
staffs grew bad. Just prior to the Amalgamation there were men
in the employ of the Barrack Street Bank, 26, 27 and 29 years
of age who had been in the employ of the Bank for as long as
ten or eleven years whose salaries were not more than £IOO
or £l2O.
Staff of Government Savings Bank of N.S.W.
The staff of the Government Savings Bank of N.S.W.
were, for many years, Post Office officials. An outstanding event
in the lives of the old hands was the transfer of the Government
Savings Bank of N.S.W. from the Money Order Department
of the Post Office, which occupied a week-end. Very friendly
relationships still exist between members of the Money Order
Office and senior members of the Government Savings Bank of
N.S.W. who severed their connection with the Post Office
in 1905.
Following the amalgamation of the two Banks in 1914 the
entire staff of the Savings Bank of N.S.W. was absorbed by the
Government Savings Bank of N.S.W., with the exception of
the Managing Trustee, Mr. David Mitchell (the same David
Mitchell who was appointed “ Examiner of Branch Accounts ”
in 1869). Being well on in years this gentleman retired.
War.
When the war broke out the staff quickly responded to
the call. The Bank’s Honour Roll, erected in the Concourse of
the Head Office Building, shows that 212 officers enlisted
(189 actually embarked). This represents 35 per cent, of the
male staff at the beginning of the war. Many returned to
resume their peaceful calling in the Bank, but 33 laid down
their costly sacrifice on Freedom’s altar. These, in the words
of Lawrence Binyon,
“ shall not grow old as w r e that are left grow old.
Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn ;
At the going down of the sun and in the morning
We shall remember them.”
Commissioners' Generosity.
In every instance where an officer’s military pay was less
than his Bank salary, the Commissioners made up the difference.


The Present Board of Commissioners.
R. W. MAY
H. D, HALL
A. W. TURNER


All officers absent on active service were granted annual
increments in salary, and the annual recreation leave to which
they would have been entitled was allowed to accumulate to
their credit and was made available at convenient times after
their return.
The U.8.0.A.
The war ended, the effect of the high cost of living was
felt keenly by bank officers, as with all other sections of the
community. The need, too, for an organisation to foster the
interest of bank officers had long been felt.
Early in 1919 the officers of the trading banks formed
the United Bank Officers’ Association, and this body was
registered as a Trade and Industrial Union.
On 25th August, 1919, a meeting of the officers of the
Bank was held in the hall of the Railway and Tramway In-
stitute. There, the objects of the Bank Officers’ Association
were explained, and those present pledged themselves to give
the new organisation their whole-hearted support. Because of
the high cost of living at that time, it was suggested that a bonus
based on salaries should be paid to the staff, and a committee
was accordingly appointed to approach the Commissioners.
Activities were at first confined to a consideration of the
question of a bonus, then the committee was enlarged, and
later the Commissioners were approached. After considering
the requests of the deputation, the Commissioners granted a
10 per cent, bonus on salaries. Great was the joy of the Staff !
During the negotiations for a bonus the matter of affiliating
with the United Bank Officers’ Association remained in
abeyance. On the 11th February, 1920, however, a meeting of
the officers of the Bank was convened in the Protestant Hall,
Sydney. Arguments were heard for and against an affiliation
with the United Bank Officers’ Association, the Public Service
Association, or alternatively the formation of a Guild.
Finally it was decided to form a Government Savings
Bank Branch of the U.8.0.A. and the first office bearers
were elected.
The Staff soon interested themselves keenly in the welfare
of the Branch, and this interest has been well maintained,
the Branch now being the strongest in the Association.


As an initial step the Branch obtained retrospectivity, to
Ist December, 1919, of the Basic Wage adjustment of £44 per
annum for male officers and £33 per annum for female
officers.
Next, a sub-committee was appointed to draft a log of
claims for presentation to the Commissioners. After many
months of hard work the claim was presented on 28th June,
1920. This claim covered all the working conditions of every
section of the staff and provided for a system of classification.
The Commissioners, although they regarded the claim
as too high, took an enlightened view of the staff’s activities,
and on 11th August, 1920, submitted a counter-proposal to the
Association.
Conferences were arranged between representatives of
the Commissioners and the Sub-Committee of the Association.
After many weeks of deliberation the first Staff Industrial
Agreement, with a duration of three years from Ist December,
1919, was drawn up. This was the first Industrial Agreement
giving legal sanction to an award for bank officers in any
part of the World.
Staff Welfare.
Apart from this conciliatory treatment of the staff’s
Industrial Association the Commissioners introduced pro-
gressive welfare schemes. In 1925 a “ Welfare Fund ” was
established, and in June, 1926, “ O’Malley-Wood House ”
(named in honour of the President) containing 6 fully furnished
flats, was opened at Katoomba for use by Officers on recreation
leave.
The Commissioners have at all times shown a lively interest
in the athletic and social events promoted by the staff.
Evidence of their attention to the personal needs of the
staff are the large Dining and Social Room at Head Office
and the many modern comforts which are included in the
construction of the building.
Truly this is “ an era of wider liberty and humanised
discipline, of easier conditions and less drudgery, of relaxed
strain and shorter hours.”
The Branches.
It has not been possible, within the limits of these covers,
to describe the history and progress of the many branches.


Their usefulness has been comprehended in the success of the
institution as a whole. Since the establishment of the Rural
Bank in 1921 many of the branches have doubled their staffs.
Besides its purely Savings Bank transactions, and the
Rural Bank and Advances for Homes Department activities
referred to in preceding chapters, the Bank assists the Govern-
ment of the State by paying Widows’, Civil Service and Police
pensions and Child Welfare disbursements. For the twelve
months ended 30th June, 1929 these miscellaneous transactions
at branches totalled 247,538.
Graduates from the Ranks.
An agreeable observation with which to close this book
is that in recent years the executives have graduated from the
ranks, Messrs. R. W. May and A. W. Turner entered the
service as clerks : both are now Commissioners, the former
after being Chief Inspector, the latter after being Secretary.
Their positions were filled on their promotion by Messrs.
V. A. Rosich (Chief Accountant) and P. Kearns (Assistant
Secretary) both of whom entered the service as clerks.
What of the Future ?
Who shall say how the Bank will fare in the never-ending
flight of future days ? “ The past is gone, the future yet
unseen,” but we can look to that future with high confidence,
for the Bank began in a humble way, as befits it, and to-day
its Head Office stands proudly overlooking the place of its
birth and growth—a symbol of the success which will in-
evitably attend the years of patient thrift it exhorts its depositors
to practice ; a monument to the wisdom and foresight of its
founders and the loyal confidence and support of those for
whose use it was intended.
