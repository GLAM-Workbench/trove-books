In Chanting
1. Try to understand the meaning and to enter into the spirit of
the words, and express their sense and feeling as simply and
fully as possible.
2. Asm reading, so inchanting, donot utter the words fa unequal
and even manner, but give prominence to those wtooh are
more important, touching lightly the less important.
3. Attend to the stops, recite uniformly, and observe the time
of good reading.
* The perpendicular bars correspond with the bars in the chant,
and indicate the note to which each word should be sung.
+ When the Psalm contains an odd number of verses, (as in
Ps. lxvii.) the last half, if a double one, must be repeated
for the final verse.


j PSALM L
BLESSED is the man thatwalketh not in the counsel of | the
& -uni godly, [-the | scornful.
Nor standethin the way of sinners, nor sitteth | in—the | seat of
But his delight is in the | law of—the | Lord;
And in his law doth he | medi—tate | day—and \ night.
And he shall he like a tree planted by the | rivers-of | water,
That bringeth | forth—his | fruit in—his | season;
His leaf also | shall—not | wither ;
And whatso | ever —he | doeth —shall | prosper.
The ungodly | are—not |so ;
But are like the chaff which the | wi-nd | driveth-a | way.
Therefore the ungodly shall not | stand in-the | judgment,
Nor sinners in the congre | ga—tion | of—the | righteous.
For the Lord knoweth the | way of-the | righteous:
But the way |of the—un | godly—shall | perish.
jj PSALM VIII.
LOED our Lord, how excellent is thy name in | all—the |
'•J earth!
Who hast set thy | glory—a | hove—the | heavens.
Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast thou or | darn-
ed | strength [and the a | venger.
Because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the | ene-my |
When I consider thy heavens, the | work of thy | fingers,
The moon and the | stars,— which | thou hast—or | darned;
What is man, that’ thou art | mind—ful |of him ?
And the son of man, | thatr-thou | visit—est | him?
For thou hast made him a little lower I than—the | angels,
And hast crowned | him—with [ glory-and | honour,
Thou inadest him to have dominion over the | works of—thy |
Thou hast put I all—things | under—his | feet v [hands,


All sheep and oxen, yea, and the [ beasts of—the | field ;
The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever
passeth | through—the | paths of—the | seas.
O | Lord—our | Lord,
How excellent is thy [ name—in | all—the | earth.
HI. PSALM XIX.
CTtTIE heavens declare the | glory—of | God ;
And the firmament | sheweth—his i han—dy | work.
Day unto day | utter—eth | speech,
And night unto | ni—ght | shew—eth | knowledge.
There is no | speech—nor | language
Where their | voi—ce | is—not | heard.
Their line is gone out through | all—the | earth,
And their | words—to the | end—of the | world :
In them hath he set a tabernacle | for—the | sun,
Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth
as a strong | man—to | run—a | race.
His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto
the | en—ds | of it:
And there is nothing | hid—from the | heat—there | of.
The law of the Lord i 3 perfect, con | verting—the | soul :
The testimony of the Lord is | sure, —making | wise—the | simple.
The statutes of the Lord are right, re | joicing—the | heart:
The commandment of the Lord is j pure,—en | lightening—the |
eyes.
The fear of the Lord is clean, en | during—for [ ever :
The judgments of the Lord are true and j righte—ous [ al —to |
gether.
More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than | much—fine |
gold.
Sweeter also than j honey—and the J hon—ey | comb.


Moreover, by them is thy J ser—vant | warned :
And in keeping of | them —there is | great—re | ward.
Who can under | stand—his | errors ?
Cleanse thou | me—from | se—cret ] faults.
Keep hack thy servant also from pre | sump —tuous | sins ;
Let them | not—have do | min—ion | over me :
Then | shall I—be J upright,
And I shall be innocent | from—the | great—trans | gression.
Let the | words—of my | mouth,
And the medi | ta—tion | of—my | heart.
Be acceptable | in—thy | sight,
O Lord, my J strength—and J my —Ee | deemer.
IV. PSALM XXIII.
rE Lord is my shepherd, I [ shall—not | want,
He maketh me to lie | down—in | gre—en | pastures :
He leadeth me beside the | sti—ll | waters.
He restoreth my soul; he leadeth me in the paths of | righteous—
ness | for—his | name’s sake.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the | shadow—of J death,
I | wi—ll | fear —no | evil,
For | thou —art | with me,
Thy | rod and—thy | staff—they | comfort me.
Thou preparest a | table—be | fore me
In the | pre—sence | of—mine | enemies.
Thou anointest my | head—with | oil;
My | cu—p | run—neth j over.
Surely | goodness—and f mercy
Shall follow me J all—the | days of—my [ life;
And | I—will | dwell
In the | house—of the | Lord—for | ever.


V. PSALM XXIV.
CJTHB earth is the Lord’s, and the | fulness —there | of ;
The world, and | they—that | dwell—there | in.
For he hath founded it up | on—the | seas,

Who shall ascend into the | hill of—the | Lord ?
Or who shall | stand—in his | ho —ly | place 1
He that hath clean hands | and a—pure | heart: [ceitfully ;
Who hath not lifted up his soul unto | vanity,—nor | sworn—de |
He shall receive the blessing | from—the | Lord,
And righteousness from the | God—of | his —sal | vation.
This is the generation of | them—that | seek him ;
That | seek—thy | face, —0 | Jacob.
Lift up your heads, 0 ye gates, and he ye lift up, ye ever—last |
And the Xing of | glo—ry | shall—come | in. [ing | doors ;
Who is this | King—of | glory ?
The Lord strong and mighty, the | Lo—rd J mighty—in | battle.
Lift up your heads, O ye gates ; even lift them up, ye ever—last |
And the King of | glo—ry | shall—come | in. [ing | doors ;
Who is this [ King—of | glory ?
The Lord of hosts, | he—is the j King—of J glory.

Of | whom—shall I [ be—a | fraid 1
Though an host should encamp against me, my heart | shall—
not | fear : [confident.
Though war should rise against me, in | this—will | I—be |
For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in | his—pa | vilion :
In the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall | set me
up | on—a | rock.


Hear, O Lord, when I | cry with—my | voice :
Have mercy also up | on me,—and | an—swer I me.
When thou saidst, | seek ye—my | face :
My heart said unto thee, thy | face,—Lord, | will—l | seek.
Hide not thy | face —far | from me ;
Put not thy | servant—a | way —in | anger :
Thou hast j been—my | help;
Leave me not, neither forsake me, 0 | God—of j my—sal | vation.
When my father and my | mother—for | sake me,
Then the | Lord—will 1 take—me | up.
Teach me thy | way,—o | Lord,
And lead me in a plain path, be J eau—se ( of—mine | enemies.
Wait t on—the | Lord :
Be | o—f | go—od | courage,
And he shall | strengthen—thine | heart:
Wa | it—ll say,—on the | Lord.
VII. PSALM. XXVIII. 1,2, 6—9.
QjjtNTO thee will I cry, 0 J Lord,—my | rock ;
