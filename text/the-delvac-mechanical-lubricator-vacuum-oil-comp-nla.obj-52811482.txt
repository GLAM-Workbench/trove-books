What Means to You!
Correct Lubrication plays a vital role in securing capacity
production and low production costs. It is your best
insurance against excessive machine wear, high maintenance
costs and interrupted production. It has been proved
again and again that use of the right oil in the right place,
in the right way, is one of the most vital factors in industry.
In fact, it is really four factors in one.
THE SUM OF
THESE FOUR SAVINGS
1. REDUCED POWER CONSUMPTION
2. MORE CONTINUOUS PRODUCTION
3. DECREASED MAINTENANCE
4. LOWER LUBRICATION COSTS

THE DELVAC
MECHANICAL LUBRICATOR
(British Design and Manufacture; Patent No. 533542)
THE MECHANICAL FEEDING
OF LUBRICATING OILS
THE ORIGIN
OF THE NECESSITY
THE complicated mechanisms that
have been evolved in the rapid
advance made within recent years
in engineering practice have demanded —
indeed that advance has in many ways
been dependent upon—efficient lubrica-
tion. This need has been met by con-
tinuously improved lubricants, each
adapted, as the result of research and
practical test, to meet the service required
of it.
Coincident with the call for these high-
grade lubricants, there is one that is
equally insistent —for some means that
will be fully reliable to ensure positive
feed.
CORRECT AND POSITIVE
APPLICATION
Correct application is a factor that can-
not be ignored, particularly in the lubri-
cation of air compressors and of internal
combustion engines of the Diesel, Com-
pression Ignition and Gas Engine types.
Positive application results not only in
efficient lubrication, but in economy of
consumption and therefore of running cost.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF
MECHANICAL FEED
Mechanically-operated lubricators were
employed originally for the introduction
of oil to steam cylinders and valves, but
to-day they are being applied with equally
satisfactory results to the cylinder lubri-
cation of internal combustion engines and
to a wide range of service in bearing
lubrication. Particularly is this the case
with large footstep and other bearings,
where uniform temperatures and security
from overheating are of vital importance.
AUTOMATIC WORKING
A mechanical lubricator, being driven
from a moving part of the engine or
machine on which it is employed, feeds
oil only while the engine or machine is in
motion, which makes for economy of oil
consumption.
THE PROBLEM SUMMARIZED
The chief causes of lubrication trouble,
even with the best oils in use, are over-
feeding, underfeeding and irregular
feeding.
Overfeeding of even the best lubricating
oil in the presence of highly superheated


steam, or in internal combustion engines,
is undesirable, and underfeeding is just as
objectionable. It is consequently neces-
sary that uniform predetermined rates of
feed shall be maintained.
It is an easy matter to design a pump
that will feed oil against most practical
pressures. It is, however, only by careful
design and special workmanship that a
pump can be manufactured which will
permit of the feeds being cut down to the
lowest limit consistent with safety and
efficiency, and which will maintain a
uniform rate of feed of small quantities for
long periods against high pressures and
over a wide range of loads and tem-
peratures.
The average mechanical lubricator may
be satisfactory for steam cylinders, in
which the moisture of condensation assists
lubrication even when the lubricator has
stopped for a period ; but it is not reliable
under highly superheated steam con-
ditions, nor when employed for internal
combustion engine cylinders. In the
latter, the lubricating oil is exposed to
flame contact, and in both, a short
stoppage of the oil feed would end
probably in abrasion of the working
surfaces, or possibly in seizure. Therefore
it is essential that the reliability of the
lubricator employed be beyond question.
DEFECTS OF THE AVERAGE
LUBRICATOR
The main defects of many of the
mechanically-operated lubricators at pre-
sent on the market may be summarized
as follows :
(1) A large number of them will
pump oil against high pressures ; but
with the majority it is not possible to
pump minute and regular feeds of oil
against high pressure.
(2) The motion of the engine does
not definitely control the amount of
oil being fed.
(3) The “ human element ” has not
been eliminated ; inasmuch as necessity
exists for the adjustment of needle
valves on starting and stopping.
(4) Sensitiveness to changes in vis-
cosity of the oil caused by temperature
fluctuations.
(5) Variation of the rate of feed,
caused by diminution of the head of
oil in the container.
(6) Badly fitted glands, causing the
introduction to the engine of an irregular
mixture of air bubbles and oil; a
particularly undesirable feature where
the lubricant comes into contact with
highly heated surfaces.
(7) Deficient filling facilities, pro-
hibiting the use of effective straining
devices.
(8) Difficulty, and often the impossi-
bility, of adjusting or flushing multiple
feeds individually.
(9) The oil shown in the sight feed
may not represent the actual amount
being fed to the engine against pressure.
(10) Oil shown at the sight feed dis-
charging from a measuring plunger is
against atmospheric pressure and not
against working pressure.
(11) Impossibility of timing the oil
injection.
(12) An undesirable multiplicity of
working parts, the wear of which may
cause lost motion and consequent error
in the proper functioning of the lubri-
cator. Such a lubricator may become
less reliable without necessarily giving
direct evidence of this at the sight feeds.

THE DELVAC MECHANICAL LUBRICATOR
When it is appreciated that the efficient
lubrication of expensive high-powered
prime movers depends largely on the
absolute reliability of the means of apply-
ing the lubricant, it follows that the
mechanical lubricator fitted should be an
engineering job throughout, and in full
keeping with the importance of its duties.
Bearing this in mind the design, con-
struction and workmanship of the Delvac
Mechanical Lubricator, which is entirely
a British product, are of the highest order,
so that it meets every requirement in
reliability and regularity of working.
It consists of a cast-iron oil container or
reservoir carrying one or more independent
pump units, which are actuated by motion
transmitted through an eccentric or
operating shaft traversing the whole
length of the container, various forms of
drive being used. In containers with
ten or more pump units the operating
and rocking lever shafts are supported
by a centre bearing in addition to the
two end bearings.
The number of feeds and the capacities
of the containers supplied are set out below.
If desired, containers can be made with
two or more separate compartments to
permit of feeding different grades of oils.
The approximate container capacity of
the Lubricator varies according to the
number of feeds required. From and
including 3-pints, the highest number of
feeds indicated in the following list is
the maximum that can be fitted to the Oil
Container. Where a larger Container
with a less number of feeds is required,
suitable blanking-off caps are fitted in
place of the pump units and flushing
units.

PUMP CONSTRUCTION
(FIGS. 2, 3 and 4)
The pumps are of vertical differential
plunger type. The plungers (103) are
ground accurately on both diameters, the
lower or larger part working in an exten-
sion of the pump barrel (100). The upper
or smaller part is accommodated in a de-
livery valve cage combined with a self-
aligning bush (89A), thereby ensuring
accurate alignment under all working con-
ditions. This method of pump construc-
tion enables small uniform quantities of
oil to be pumped against high pressures at
all operating speeds.
The lower or larger part of the plunger
is made in three sizes, viz., |-in., A-in.
and diameter. The upper or
smaller part is in all cases |-in. diameter.
Unless one of the smaller sizes is
specifically called for, all pump units are
fitted with plungers having a lower part
diameter of |-in.
The smaller sizes of plunger are de-
signed to meet cases where the number
of pump strokes per minute is high and
where very small quantities of oil have
to be fed. They should be fitted, there-
fore, where very fine feed adjustments
are necessary, so that a practical working
stroke may be observed on the flushing
regulator unit (72).
Where required, pump plungers of
different sizes can be fitted in one multi-
feed lubricator.
Oil-sealing chambers (D and G), pre-
venting the ingress of air into the pump
chamber (F), are arranged both at the
top end and at the bottom end of the
differential plunger (103), thereby obvia-
ting the use of packing.
The pump units are interchangeable
for all types of drive.
Fig. 5.—Method of Mounting Eccentric and Lever Driven
Delvac Lubricator on Horizontal Open Type Gas Engine


PUMP OPERATION
Each pump is operated by means of a
separate hardened steel eccentric (50)
fitted with a loose ring. The eccentric is
fixed on an operating shaft (40), and
engages with a hardened steel lever (61),
which is mounted on an idle shaft (39).
The return or suction stroke is effected
by means of a spring (108).
On the downward or suction stroke,
oil is drawn through the suction valves
(92 and 105), up the hollow plunger
(E), into the pumping chamber (F).
On the upward or delivery stroke, the
suction valves (92 and 105) close auto-
matically, and oil is forced from the
pumping chamber (F) up and through
the annular space (B), through the ports
(A), and thence through the delivery
valves (92 and 91) and the oil nozzle (87)
into the water chamber of the sight-feed
fitting, to the top of which is fitted an
oil delivery pipe. All danger of air-
lock is eliminated, as the oil passes through
the pump in a direct vertical fine without
interruption from any horizontal obstruc-
tions or pockets.
When the Lubricator is operated by
means of a ratchet, worm and wheel,
internal spur gear or direct pulley drive,
the eccentric (50) makes one complete
revolution for every pump stroke.
With a lever drive in use, the eccentric
(50) does not rotate but simply oscillates
and depresses the rocking lever (61).
When eccentric and lever-driven Lubri-
cators are fitted, it is essential that they
be mounted as close as possible to the
driving eccentric or cam (as in Fig. 5) in
order to secure maximum stroke for the
driving lever (147). Also the eccentric (50)
should be in the position shown in relation
to the driving lever (147) to ensure its
correct operation in conjunction with the
rocking lever (61).
PULL-ON SPRING DEVICE
(Fig. 6)
To ensure a positive return of the
operating lever (147), particularly in cases
where one or more pumps are working
at a reduced stroke, all eccentric and lever-
driven lubricators are fitted with a pull-on
spring device (166).
It will be seen that the fitting may be
fixed either above or below the operating
shaft of the lubricator. (A) shows the
fixing when the lubricator drive is operated
from the back, and (B) when the drive
is taken from the front.
OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS
(Figs. 1 and 2)
STARTING-UP
After fixing the Lubricator, fill the
container with oil through the strainer
(109), Uncouple the union nut (86), remove
guide wire (99). Fill the sight-feed glass
with water (preferably clean condensate) up
to the top of the shank (94), and replace
guide wire (99). Note.—Where the Lubri-
cators are fixed in an exposed position , or
where the engine room temperature may fall
below freezing pointy a small percentage of
glycerine added to the water will prevent
freezing. Replace and retighten union nut
(86).
Remove screw (25), and, by means of a
screwdriver, open the air-vent screw (90)
about a couple of turns; now operate
the flushing rod (72) by hand until oil
emerges freely past the air-vent screw
(90). Some of this oil drops into the oil-
sealing chamber (D), which communi-
cates, by means of ports (Al), with the
clearance space (C), and thus forms an
oil seal round the top end of the plunger
(103). Tighten up screw (90) and replace
screw (25).
Loosen the coupling on the check
valve (not shown) at the farther end of
the oil delivery pipe and continue to


pump by hand till oil appears at the coup-
ling, indicating that this pipe is filled.
Tighten up the union nut on the check
valve and couple up the drive, and the
Lubricator will work as soon as the engine
starts.
With a multi-feed Lubricator, each feed
must be treated in the manner described.
ADJUSTMENT OF FEED—HAND
FLUSHING AND STROKE REGULATOR
The stroke of each pump is adjustable,
and is regulated by the flushing rod (72).
Turning this rod in a clockwise direction
decreases the rate of oil feed; turning it
in an anti-clockwise direction increases
the rate of oil feed.
Hand flushing is achieved by depressing
and releasing the rod (72). This rod also
gives an indication of the pump stroke
when the Lubricator is working.
HAND FLUSHING DEVICE
The operation of hand flushing is
facilitated by the use of the hand flushing
device shown in Fig. 7.
The device, which is applicable to
Lubricators both of tubular glass and
bull’s-eye types, consists of a plate (76)
fitted across the face of each pair of
pump units and held in position by the
air-vent screw caps (25). This plate
is slotted to provide a fulcrum for a hand
lever (75) which passes over the flushing
rod (72) on the Lubricator.
OIL LEVEL GLASS
To prevent oil in the container from
being pumped to a level where ingress
of air through the pump suction valve
would stop the pump working, an Oil
Level Glass (26) is fitted to all containers.
The oil level should not be allowed to
fall below the bottom of this glass, or


the operation described in the section
“ Operating Instructions —Starting Up ”
will have to be repeated to reprime the
Pump. As a guide, a red mark is placed
at the bottom of the glass and the oil
level in the container should never be
allowed to fall below the upper edge of
this indicating mark.
IN THE EVENT OF THE PUMP NOT
FEEDING
Open the air-vent screw (90), and see
that oil comes out when flushing by
means of the flushing rod (72).
REMOVAL OF PUMP UNIT FROM
CONTAINER
Slacken the screw (30). The pump
unit can then be removed from its seating
on the cover. When replacing the pump
unit, it should be pressed down until it
rests firmly on its seating on the cover.
While in this position, the screw (30)
should be set up by hand and tightened
with a short spanner.
INSPECTING OR DISMANTLING PUMP
UNIT
By means of the flats provided, hold
the sight-glass casing (80b) in the jaws of
a vice. Then with a |-in. spanner un-
screw and remove the pump from the
sight-glass casing. Hold the pump in
the hand and give the outer sleeve (107) a
partial turn, which allows the pin (Jl) to
pass through the slot (K). A further
half-turn allows also the pin (J 2) to pass
through this slot. The combined de-
livery valve cage and self-aligning bush
(89a) may be withdrawn from the sight-
glass casing (80b) by removing the air-vent
screw (90). The suction valve cage (104)
can then be withdrawn from the outer
sleeve (107) by using a |-in. spanner, and
the plunger (103) removed.
RE-ASSEMBLY OF PUMP UNIT
Drop the plunger (103) into its place in
the outer sleeve (107) and then screw the
suction valve cage (104) hard up on to the
Fig. 7. —Hand-Flushing Device


lower face of the plunger shoulder. This
can be done by using two |-in. spanners.
Place the spring (108) on the spigot at the
top of the outer sleeve (107), and insert
the larger diameter of plunger (103) into
its barrel (100). Place the combined
delivery valve cage and self-aligning bush
(89a) in position in the sight-glass casing
(80b) and replace the air-vent screw (90).
Enter the smaller diameter of plunger
(103) into the bore of the combined
delivery valve cage and self-aligning bush
(89a) and screw the barrel (100) into the
sight-class casing (80b) by hand; then
place the casing (suitably protected) in a
vice and tighten up the barrel (100) by
means of a |-in. spanner, care being taken
to rotate gently by hand the outer sleeve
(107) to ensure that the self-aligning bush
is taking up its correct position. Having
tightened up the pump as described, it
should be worked by hand to see that it
moves freely during its stroke.
The suction valve balls can be removed
from their cage by releasing the small stop
spring (106). This should be replaced
after the balls have been put back on their
seats.
The discharge valve balls can be ex-
amined by removing the screwed oil
nozzle (87), which should be screwed
securely into its place after examination.
N.B.—lt is essential that the pump he
assembled as described above.
LID TO COVER OF LUBRICATOR
(FIG. 8)
The Cover of each Lubricator is fitted
with a lid that is sufficiently close fitting
to afford ample protection against the
ingress of dust and other foreign matter to
the container and which can be swung
clear for filling purposes. The chain
attachment precludes any possibility of the
Fig. 8. —Lubricator Cover Lid with Securing Chain


Lid being lost or mislaid. The oil strainer
can be removed without disturbing the
securing chain.
Fig. 8 shows the arrangement and the
method of securing the chain to the Cover
and Lid.
DRAIN PLUG
A drain plug is fitted at the bottom of
all containers.
Fig. 10. —Pressure Relief Valve
STEAM HEATING CARTRIDGE
(FIG. 9)
A steam heating cartridge can be sup-
plied for use in exposed positions or
during the winter months, when oils may
become sluggish. It should be fitted into
the drain plug hole and connected up to
a small steam pipe provided with a
suitable valve or cock.
SIGHT-GLASS FITTINGS
There are two types of sight-glass
fittings—the tubular and the bull’s-eye.
The tubular fitting (Fig. 2) is suitable
for pumps required to feed against pres-
sures up to 650 lb. per sq. in. The
bull’s-eye fitting (Fig. 1) is supplied in
either phosphor bronze or steel, the phos-
phor bronze for pressures up to 2,240 lb.
per sq. in. and the steel for pressures
above 2,240 lb. per sq. in.
Fig. 9. —Section of Heating Cartridge
The tubular sight-feed has one cylin-
drical glass (95), the joints at the top and
bottom being made by means of vulcanized
rubber rings (96). The bull’s-eye sight-
feed has two glass discs (81a), one front
and one back, the joints being made by
means of vulcanized rubber rings (82).
In each case the sight-glass fitting forms
part of the pump unit and is mounted on
the top of the cover, thereby allowing a
clear through view and a ready means of
verifying the amount of oil that is being
pumped.
It is sometimes assumed, because there
is a considerable pause between one drop
of oil and the next leaving the oil nozzle
(87) at the sight-feed, that the engine is
without oil during that period. A little
consideration will show that this is not
the case. If reference be made to Fig. 1
it will be seen that the bull’s-eye fitting
(80c) and the pipe on the top of it form a
fluid column. When the lubricator has
been fitted ready for its first start, the
bull’s-eye fitting (80c) is filled with water
(or other liquid), and the operation of the
lubricator fills the pipe line above the
bull’s-eye fitting gradually with oil up
to the check valve at the delivery end of
the pipe fine. Then, for illustration, if
it takes ten strokes of the pump to build
up on the nozzle a drop of oil sufficiently
large to leave the nozzle and pass out

Fig. 19. —Ideal Arrangement of Oil Inlet for Timed Injection
through the water, it follows that at each
impulse of the pump a tenth of a drop of
oil will have been discharged into a space
already filled with liquid. There must,
therefore, be discharged at each stroke of
the pump one-tenth of a drop of oil at
the engine end, otherwise the piping or
bull’s-eye fitting would burst. These
remarks also apply to the tubular-glass
sight-feed.
PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE
(FIG. 10)
When pumping into sealed spaces, such
as lantern glands, against pressures over
2,240 lbs. per sq. in. it is sometimes
found necessary to fit a pressure relief
valve into the pump unit. This relief
valve, spring loaded, consists of a body
(251) which screws into the air vent in
place of the air-vent screw, the joint
being made by the air-vent screw washer
(90). The valve is a A-in. hardened steel
ball (252) and the load is set and adjusted
by a spring (253) and the body screw (254).
To allow the relief valve to be fitted, a cap
(255) replaces the brass Vent-Screw Cap.
TIMED OIL INJECTION
(FIG. 19)
The set of conditions described in
the penultimate paragraph permits an
approximate timed injection of oil to the
piston and cylinder walls of an internal
combustion engine; but for this purpose
it is necessary to employ an eccentric
and lever drive on the lubricator. This
drive giving a stroke of the pump for each
stroke of the driving mechanism.
Fig. 19 illustrates the arrangement. The
ideal position for the oil inlet to a gas
engine cylinder is indicated by (A), which
is at the point between the two back
piston rings when the piston is at its
outer dead centre. The point at which
the oil inlet to the cylinder is placed
most frequently is indicated by (B), which
is too far forward, as the oil cannot reach
the piston rings readily. The eccentric
(F) should be set so that the Lubricator
injects the oil just before the piston
reaches its outer dead centre on the
power stroke.


SELF FILLING SUCTION PUMP
When the Delvac Mechanical Lubricator
is used to lubricate a number of points on
an engine or machine and especially where
a fairly copious supply of oil is required,
the oil can be returned to the Lubricator
Container from a collecting sump or tank
by means of a Suction Pump fitted in the
Container in the same manner as the Force
Pump. The arrangement consists of three
parts : the Suction Pump (Assy. 270), the
Foot Valve (Assy. 281), and the Overflow
Fitting (Assy. 283). The Overflow Fitting
regulates the height of the oil level in the
container. The Drawings {see Appendix C)
show the arrangement and the Pump details.
STANDARD DRIVES
A ground steel eccentric shaft (40) is
used throughout, the shaft projecting 4-in.
beyond the edge of the container on all
lubricators. This arrangement permits of
the use of any one of the standard methods
of drive shown in Figs. 25, 26, 27 and 28,
i.e., pulley, sprocket, direct lever, ratchet,
worm and wheel, or internal spur gear, or,
as illustrated in the 18-feed lubricator
in Fig. 18, chain and sprocket wheel.
Where it is desired to take a drive from
the end of a shaft by chain sprocket or
pulley, this can be done by screwing Pintle
(201) into the centre of the shaft and fixing
on it a sprocket or pulley as illustrated in
Fig. 20. The pintle is locked by Dowel
(202)
The stuffing box bearing (42) is common
to all types of drive. The screwed gland
(41) is a standard fitting, except where an
internal spur gear drive is employed. All
drives can be fitted either right or left
handed.
The eccentric shaft lever may be
actuated either from an eccentric and
lever or by a swivel coupling, connecting
rod, eye and stud, as Figs. 15 and 25. These
arrangements give an oscillating movement
to the eccentric shaft (40) and are very
convenient for engines and machines run-
ning at comparatively slow speeds, as they
permit of a pump impulse for each move-
ment of the operating lever (147).
When fitting a worm and wheel and spur
gear drive to the Lubricator, the packing
material should be removed. The screwed
gland (41) is used for fixing the worm box
in position, an additional locating pin (9)
being utilized.
In order to meet the wide range of
speeds encountered in high-speed engines
and machines, the worm reducing gears,
which are enclosed and self-lubricated,
are supplied to give a speed reduction of
20 : 1 or 40 : 1 as required. The worm
reducing shaft can be fitted with a pulley,
available in various sizes to suit require-
ments, or alternatively with a chain-driven
sprocket.
Fig. 20. —Pintle Mounting for Sprocket or Pulley


Where an internal spur gear drive (Fig.
28) is fitted, a steel fixing sleeve (155) is
employed. Pinion teeth cut on the outer
end of this sleeve engage with a planet
pinion (158), the extended teeth of which
engage in turn with the eccentric shaft
pinion (156), giving a speed reduction of
20: 1. A pulley is not required for this
drive, as the revolving gear case (153) with
its cover (154) constitute the driving
medium and give what is equivalent to a
pulley diameter of 4|-in.
In special cases, the eccentric shaft (40)
can be arranged to extend through an
additional stiffing box fitted at the end
of the container opposite to the driving
end. This arrangement will be found
useful where it is desired to couple up
two or more lubricators in line and to
operate them by means of one driving
gear, or where a flushing handle is required
on a ratchet-driven lubricator, the shafts
being joined by coupling (141) or coupling
(203).
POSITIVE BACK-LASH ARRANGEMENT
(For Ratchet Drive only) (Fig. 21)
In all ratchet-driven lubricators pro-
vision is made for preventing back-lash
in the eccentric shaft by the fitting of the
Positive Back - Lash Arrangement illus-
trated in Fig. 21.
Being Positive, this device eliminates
entirely any possibility of back-lash in
the eccentric shaft.
A ratchet wheel riveted to a standard
eccentric (50c) is engaged by a back-lash
pawl carried in bracket (181), which is
fitted on standard blind-end bush (48).
In order to compensate for the space
occupied by the back-lash ratchet wheel a
brass make-up washer (180) of suitable
thickness is inserted between the head of
the blind-end bush and the container, thus
permitting the use of standard fittings
throughout.
The movement of the ratchet wheel is
controlled by a pawl (181 b) mounted on
a pin (181 c) and a pawl spring (91).
When it is necessary to fit the Positive
Back-Lash Arrangement to a lubricator
which has the eccentric shaft extended
through both sides of the container, the
bracket (181) is fitted on the unscrewed
portion of the stuffing-box bearing in
the container in the same way as when
a blind-end bush is employed.
LOCKING DEVICE FOR ECCENTRIC SHAFT
GLAND
(Lever and Ratchet Drives)
Fig. 22 shows the simple but effective
method adopted to prevent slackening
back of the gland nut on the eccentric
shaft (40).
The device consists of a check spring
(41a), encircling the threads of the gland
and anchored by the locating pin (41b).
With the spring in place the gland can
be tightened up, but unless the locating
pin be removed the gland cannot slacken
back.
When it is desired to re-pack the gland,
the locating pin must first be taken out
so that the spring is free to revolve and
come away with the gland nut. After
re-packing, the locating pin should, of
course, be replaced.
Care should be taken to see that the
ring of the check spring is on the screwed
part of the gland and not in the recess
at the back of the thread, before re-
placing the locating pin.
FIXING OR MOUNTING OF
LUBRICATOR
To permit of the Lubricator being
mounted on a horizontal or a vertical plane
interchangeable feet are supplied with all


Fig. 21. —Positive Back-Lash Arrangement
sizes except the single-feed type for which
there is a suitable bar mounting bracket.
BOLT CENTRES
Figs. 29, 30 and 31 in Appendix B
give the fixing bolt centres and other
details for both bottom feet and back
flanges for Lubricators up to eighteen
feeds.
The pint size container is fixed by two
-|-in. dia. by |-in. long hexagon screws
in the base of the container and placed on
a centre line parallel to the centre line of
the eccentric shaft, and l|-in. distance
between centres. Full details are given in
Appendix B (Fig. 29).
ATOMIZATION OF STEAM
CYLINDER OIL
To ensure effective distribution and
economy in feed, a steam cylinder oil
should be introduced, through an
atomizer, into the centre of the flow of
steam in the main steam pipe.
Fig. 22.—Locking Device for Eccentric Shaft Gland
The steam, impinging against the
spoon-shaped end of the atomizer, drives
the oil through the slits in the atomizer,
causing the oil to become broken up into
small particles and mixed intimately with
the steam. In this manner the oil is
carried with the steam into the engine,
and is distributed thoroughly over the
internal working surfaces.
The photographic reproduction over-
leaf demonstrates atomization admirably.
In this experiment, a very heavy steam
cylinder oil was fed into a steam pipe
through an atomizer at the rate of eight
drops per minute, the steam pressure
being 70 lb. per sq. in. A piece of
blotting paper was held at a distance of
fifteen inches from the outlet and the oil-
impregnated steam allowed to impinge on
it. It will be seen from the illustration
that the oil is finely divided and that
atomization is excellent.

Atomization of Steam Cylinder Oil
CHECK VALVE AND ATOMIZER
The fitting of a check valve to the
extreme end of the oil pipe remote from
the Lubricator makes certain that the oil
pipe is at all times completely filled,
thereby preventing drainage and ensuring
that oil is available immediately the engine
starts.
Fig. 24 shows a highly efficient check
valve (A) fitted to an atomizer (B). This
combination is most generally used where
it is desirable to introduce steam cylinder
oils into the main or branch steam pipes.
The check valve (A) is fitted also to the
extreme ends of oil pipes leading to
external parts.
Atomizers for fitting into main and
branch steam pipes are stocked in four
sizes as follows :
Fig. 24. —Check Valve fitted to Atomizer.
Note. —In addition to its unique construction and performance, the Delvac Mechanical
Lubricator has an outstanding advantage in that it can have a pump unit removed
for cleaning, adjusting or repair and replaced without interfering with the working
of other oil feeds or the machine on which it is fitted.
