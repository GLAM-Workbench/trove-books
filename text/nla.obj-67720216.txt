It is a wholesome and a healthy symptom when men of the ght
and culture, like the author of the above brochure , manage
to steal enough of leisure from the hurly-burly of modern life
to write a book in the interests of one of our social or political
institutions. It evinces a living and a very real interest in
the problems of society ; and we recognise in this work of Sir
Archibald Michie an attempt to contribute his quota towards
the settlement of that ? still vext Bermoothes,? the Victorian
Education question. These remarks hold good of every in-
genuous attempt, quite irrespective of the quality of the
? settling material ? supplied as a precipitate.
It might be thought that, to a ripe student like Sir Archibald
Michie, the compilation of fifty or sixty pages of controversial
matter is a very small affair at any time. In some instances
this might hold true, but it could scarcely be a fact with such
a subject as ? the working of the Victorian Education Act,? and
never when it is dealt with as industriously as in the instance
before us. It involves a good deal of hard reading of blue-books
and statistical studies, of weighing and comparing conflicting
evidence, and no little sifting amongst dry-as-dust details.

THE TRUE STORY
OF THE
VICTORIAN EDUCATION ACT.
? Observations on the Working of the Victorian Education Act, and on
the Alleged Roman Catholic Grievances.? By Sir Archibald
Michie, Q.C., K.C.M.G. George Robertson & Co., Melbourne,
Sydney, Adelaide, and Brisbane.
It is a wholesome and a healthy symptom when men of tho? ght
and culture, like the author of the above brochure , manage
to steal enough of leisure from the hurly-burly of modern life
to write a book in the interests of one of our social or political
institutions. It evinces a living and a very real interest in
the problems of society; and we recognise in this work of Sir
Archibald Michie an attempt to contribute his quota towards
the settlement of that ? still vext Bermoothes,?' the Victorian
Education question. These remarks hold good of every in-
genuous attempt, quite irrespective of the quality of the
? settling material ? supplied as a precipitate.
It might be thought that, to a ripe student like Sir Archibald
Michie, the compilation of fifty or sixty pages of controversial
matter is a very small affair at any time. In some instances
this might hold true, but it could scarcely be a fact with such
a subject as ? the working of the Victorian Education Act,? and
never when it is dealt with as industriously as in the instance
before us. It involves a good deal of hard reading of blue-books
and statistical studies, of weighing and comparing conflicting
evidence, and no little sifting amongst dry-as-dust details.
Referring to the Reports of the Royal Commission, Sir Archi-
bald says :


? I have read these reports, and for my present purpose I have also
refreshed my memory by a re-perusal of Professor Pearson?s report, in
the year 1878, on the working of our present Education Act.?
If it were for nothing else, the sheer endurance involved in
that last feat, entitles the pamphleteer to our respectful at-
tention.
But the author?s subject is one of perennial interest. One
cannot write intelligently on the Education Act in Victoria, and
lack readers. And when an ex-Minister of the Crown and an
ex-Agent-General, who has had good opportunities of studying
the subject from other points of view in the Mother-land, offers
us his best thoughts on an ever-recurring problem, though we
may not agree with him, we ought in fairness to listen, and
weigh what we hear.
Those who, like ourselves, remember the grim humor of Sir
Archibald?s old-time style, and who take up this work with an
expectation formed upon those reminiscences, will be disap-
pointed. We find rather the garrulousness of age ?long anecdotes
with thin ghosts of jokes haunting their tails. That report of
Professor Pearson seems to have acted as a mental shower-bath
on the old gentleman?s mind, which lacked the vigor to produce
reaction. It had operated like a wet blanket spread over fire-
works. Anyhow, Sir Archibald?s mental fireworks have not
gone off in these ? Observations.? Here and there we catch a
glimpse of what might have been intended for a squib, a
rocket, or a Catherine wheel, but the fuse of words being damp,
they never do more than fizz a little. The ? Observations ?
are therefore at times a little obscured and a great deal uncon-
nected.
Does the Act reach the People I
When the author has got the length of the first dozen pages
without having done anything more profitable than exhume a
number of examples of the mal-administration of the Act under
Colonel Smith?s regime , this fact seems to have dawned upon
him j for he asks the question which before that has arisen to
the lips of every reader :?? Why re-ventilate these discreditable
proceedings now that the state of things which produced them
has been superseded by a Civil Service Commission ? ? The
answer he gives to himself is wholly inadequate. He fears, after
all, that the Act is unpopular, and he has spent one-fourth of
his space over this preliminary re-exposition in order to show
that these ? discreditable proceedings,? and not its own defects,
are the cause of its unpopularity.
He assumes, from some data that he does not give, that a
- .1


large indefinite number of the children of school age ?some
40 or 50 per cent, perhaps?are never reached at all by any
schoolmaster. He is ? perplexed ?on the point, and it is that
unfortunate report of Professor Pearson that has befogged him,
as it did its author and many other people. Recently Mr.
Robert Harper made a great speech in Parliament on the same
subject, and adopted a similar notion. Mr, Harper?s speech, as
a whole, is creditable to his judgment, his justice, and his in-
dustry ; but on this special point we believe him to be wholly
mistaken. He declared that Victoria has 26,447 children of
school age who never see the inside of a school book. It will
not be difficult to prove that both Sir Archibald and Mr.
Harper are at fault in these figures, and that whatever may be
the defects of the Victorian Education Act, they do not lie in
this direction.
Both the pamphleteer and the orator affect to distrust Mr.
Hayter?s figures, and yet neither of them have any other guide
by which to work out their own calculations.
At page 83 of the last Victorian Year Book , we find a table
of the ages of the population of Victoria, carefully estimated
up to 1883 from the 1881 census. If we jump from that to
page 561 we shall find the information in the first table worked
out most perfectly to illustrate the very point that has so
? perplexed ? Sir Archibald and misled Mr. Harper. Let us
set it down :
Total Number of Children in Victoria at School Age 199,150
Being educated?
In State Schools 154,022
In Private Schools , 27,450
At home (census figures) 5,800
187,272
Unaccounted for 11,878
This shows that 94 per cent, of the children of school age
living in Victoria are being educated; and as the Education
Report for 1883-84 shows that the per-centage of defaulters in
the statutory attendance of 30 days per quarter is only 4-6, the
whole result is satisfactory, so far. When we remember the
number of children living on stations and beyond the reach of
schools, 11,878 do not seem a large total for the whole of the
colony, towns and cities included. Sir Archibald has thus
occupied a fourth of his space in laboriously explaining away
a thing that does not exist.
Why our Education System should be Decentralised.
Our author is deeply impressed with the necessity of decen-
tralising the operation of the Act, and he gives strong reasons


for believing that the present plan of transacting every petty
detail in a Melbourne office can never develop a really national
system. And in this he is in accord with nearly all the best
witnesses. But while his eyes are turned in the right direction,
his sight scarcely extends beyond the rim of his spectacles.
He sees rightly on the point so far as he sees at all; but he
wishes to decentralise the system, to give boards of advice
plenary powers to buy their own ink and copy-books, to
establish a local control?not for the purpose of making the
system itself more expansive, more adaptable to popular wants,
more (as in Canada) applicable to diverse and special local
requirements, and so more truly national; but merely as a bribe
to the vanity of parents, to induce them to ? exhibit more
interest in school management.? He would popularise the law,
not by making it suit the people, but by drawing the people
gradually to work the law for themselves. ?As you increase
the number of the parents? duties,? he says, ? so you increase
their interest in the general subject.?
This ? lame and impotent conclusion ? is not an unfair type
of the capacity he exhibits in dealing with other points. He
has no glimpse of the larger reasons that point to Decen-
tralisation, such as those expressed by Professor Elkington,
pp. 297-8 Commission?s Report:?
Local administration is always much more economical than cen-
tralised administration. For instance, we could have schools built under
the supervision of local authority at a cost averaging little more than
one-third what the Department has been paying for its country schools
; P ne advantage I claim for municipal administration
is that we can satisfy all requirements of religious denominations with-
out recognising the religious classification as the basis of the establish-
ment of any school My view is that decentralisation,
properly carried out, would solve the Catholic difficulty.
Our author cares for none of these things, because he does not
desire to ? solve ? any difficulty whatever. He does not wish
the system to fit the people, but compel the people to fit the
system, being, he says, ? much mistaken if the people of the
present day do not determine to maintain inviolate our national
secular system, and without fear, favor, or affection of or for
any sect whatever, exclude altogether the clerical element from
these schools.?
The fact is?however these theorists may kick against such
facts?uniformity in education is an impossibility. It is a dream
of modern Radicalism?a dream which the experience of all
the ages has shown to be but ? the baseless fabric of a vision.?
In this fact, if our author ? had the trick to see it,? lies the
necessity for Decentralisation, and not in the desire to ? increase
the number of parents? duties.? The local control would at


once make possible the Canadian plan, and the principles of
that plan cut the religious difficulties right through the centre,
and give to each section of the community justice and con-
tent.
Is our System National ?
Most of those who live to learn have arrived at the con-
clusion that we can never enjoy a national system till Decen-
tralisation shall give elasticity of working in the place of hard-
and-fast square-cut lines of unbending uniformity. Some who
oppose any amendment of the Act are actuated by a fear lest
a change might ? spoil our national system.? What we said
on that point some months since we may repeat here :
Nothing can be plainer than that we have no national system to be
spoiled. We have a system that is odious to all Catholics and distaste-
ful to half the Protestants?a system that is really inflicted upon the
people ; a system which, as we believe, was conceived in error and propa-
gated in spite by the bribe of the word free ; a system that Dr. Moorhouse
has described as ? the most frightfully desolating piece of legislation.
Now, to call a system a national one that is thus described by the great
responsible head of the Church of England ; that is reprobated and con-
demned by the very principles of the Catholic Church ; and that is
lamented over as God-dishonoring by many Wesleyan and Presby-
terian dignitaries, is a misnomer. It is not national it never can be
national. It is a sectional system only, designed for the secularists.
Them it pleases ; they are satisfied. Few others are so,
It may last five years, 10 years, or 20. But as it is an injustice,
based on error, unphilosophical in design, and contrary to the very
national conscience, we are sure it cannot permanently stand. Our most
earnest desire, as patriotic citizens of this fine free country, is to do our
little towards bringing about such a reform as may remove the irritation
of a grinding wrong that now exists in the midst of a free people. There
is no difficulty in this save such as is created.
Canada has solved the question to the satisfaction of all. The result
system would solve it in Victoria. If that be not satisfactory, then why
should we not copy the happy results that have been achieved in Canada,
rather than perpetuate a system here that is galling good men and tine
citizens with a sense of oppression, and which, more terrible still, in the
minds of many able thinkers of all creeds, is laying the foundations of a
national materialism and scepticism that will bear bitter fruit in the
future.
Some points in Mr. Harper?s recent speech are well worth
transcribing here :
The Royal Commission strongly advocated local control?a com-
mittee for each school, and school boards for each district?practically
the Canadian system. They urged the necessity of unsectarian religious
instruction almost as warmly as Mr. Higinbotham did, and they thought,
as did the hon. member for East Bourke Boroughs, that the restriction pre-
venting teachers from engaging in Sunday-school work should be re-
moved. There was a radical difference existing between Protestants
and Roman Catholics as to the duty and obligation of using the Bible in
State schools. The Protestants, or the majority, held that the Bible was
the rule of faith and morals, which all should read for themselves ;


an Catholic Church, while admitting the Bible to be a
rule of faith held that it ought to be expounded and taught through the
medium of the Church. That fact was one which ought not to be lost
snght of m a country like this. It was quite impossible to create a
united system unless that fact was taken into account, and unless the
problem was dealt with and looked at with a broad spirit of tolerance
and at the same time to do what was right and proper to all sections of
the community During the debate, the necessity of doing away with
denommationalism was talked about. The Attorney-General remarked
Ve are engaged in a fight with denommationalism. I trust we shall

They might as well seek to put down associations of labor or capital or
"\ ot f ers " h,ch ke P l wlthl , n In connection with education,
such attempts were extremely improper. Recently he had seen a cartoon
"Vi 1 a f blg , b � y a l a , ltt ! e b �7 were struggling for the possession of
a basket of apples. While the big fellow was holding the little one
down, another mischievous boy came by and walked off with the apples.
That was the position ot the religious denominations under this Act.
the Protestants might be taken to represent the big boy, the Roman
Catholics the little boy, and the secularists the mischievous boy who
h th a � i ot um Amer u? n , P rofessors were warm in praising the
Canadian Act, and he did not think it was too much to hope that if it
could be adopted here it would ere long be in force in all the other
Australian colonies, and there would thus be a common school system
throughout the whole of the British dominions, for the Canadian Act was
Scotland* ar> reCOgmSmg existing to that in force in England and
j'* loB6 extrac *s was written to represent the
Catholic view of the Act; the second contains the matured
opinions of a representative Presbyterian. It will be verypertinent
here to quote a more extended utterance ot the Bishop of the
Church of England. And we do this all the more readily because
it has been attempted to be shown that when Dr. Moorhouse
said before the Church of England Assembly in 1884 ?It is
the most frightfully desolating piece of legislation I ever saw ?
he was referring to the 12th clause only. Quite apart from
the fact that the 12th clause is the very keystone of the system
and that he who condemns the keystone condemns the sound-
ness of the arch, we shall see that Dr. Moorhouse has been and
is, a wholesale opponent of the system. In the same
Assembly, held four or five years before that just referred
to, His Lordship, in the course of one of his most eloquent
broadly-hberal, and catholic utterances, used words and argu-
ments that made us not only admire his intellectual grasp but
venerate him for his brave defence of intrinsic injustice ?and
bus tender solicitude for the little children of God. Ravin-
?pointed out how moral causes act and react on the history of a
people, and that national greatness depends on moral force

contended that since that time the Bishop has altered his views
we will quote a short extract from his evidence before the
Royal Commission in 1883. At pages 24, 25, 26, 28, he says :
To
= oV ' the

demoralisation of the children, and a very serious interference with the

base my opinion upon notions, but upon facts. ... i admit
r"ts r Vl !i m 0 T ak u th ? fullest amission on that poini, tha?t ihe Roman
Catholic difficulty has been the rock ahead in all my efforts as Ibe
heve, to improve the education of this land. I did, when I came to this
colony as the gentlemen of this Board must remember, propose that a
separate grant should be made to Roman Catholics. I did that upon
this ground. I thought they felt the conscientious objection to secular
or undenominahona l religious teaching more strongly than all other
citizens of this land. I was asked, ? Why do you say that ? ? and lam
afraid that my answer was a very practical one. I said, ? I measure a

upon their consciences ; and I said, ?If this stress is exceptional the
indulgence should be so too.? I am aware that that moposi
tion of mine has been so sternly and universally rejected, that it seems
to have no chance whatever of being accepted within any computable
time. I have therefore dropped it, not because I think it was wrong- or
unreasonable , btit because I believe it to be impracticable . *
1 h u e above quotations we learn what the Church of Eng-
and Bishop taught his clergy years ago, what he told the Royal'
Commission about the tendency of the Act, and that it was all
in accord with his declaration of 1884, that the secular principle
of the Victorian law is the frightfully desolating piece
of legislation I ever saw.? We might easily quote the whole-
sale condemnations of representative Wesleyan clergymen and
laymen also, proving beyond question that the heads of? Pro-
testantism and the whole body of Catholics are utterly opposed
to the Act. 1 hus in a democratic community we have the re-
markable example of a minority of the population inflicting an
odious tyranny upon a reluctant majority. Mr. Harper?s picture
of the big Protestant boy holding the little Catholic boy down
whi e the still smaller Secularist boy ran off with the disputed
apples, just explains it. 1


We may give another example of the extravagance of the
system as at present conducted, by quoting a table
recently supplied by Mr. Robert Harper, as follows : ?

The Question of Cost.
When Sir Archibald Michie approaches the question as
to whether Education should be free, he feels himself on unsafe
ground. But this does not deter him from speaking his mind ;
and he says with much force, ? that the country ought not to
be put to the expense of �600,000 a year for educating the
children of the rich and prosperous .It seems
certain that unless some radical change be made in this particu-
lar, our system must break down sooner or later under the mere
weight of its own increasing costliness.'?
That is well-spoken. But here again the Canadian system
of local rating is all-sufficient to solve both difficulties ?that of
cost and the other of relieving the State of the unnatural bur-
den of educating the children of the well-to-do.
The amount of public money spent last year on State
schools was �593,742. The Catholics spent of their own
�26,555. Let us compare the result

Here is a startling difference as to cost, and yet the Royal
Commission?s Report says
The evidence taken before the Commission shows that the secular
instruction at the Roman Catholic schools has been quite equal to that
of the State schools.


To bring out this result, the total cost of the Ontario
system was, exclusive of buildings, �533,712. Mr. Harper?s
figures do not represent the Victorian total cost. It cost
�5 Os. Gd. per head last year for each child in average
attendance, and �4 14s. lOd. for each child educated up
to the statutory attendance of 30 days per quarter. It was
objected to Mr. Harper that teachers? salaries are higher in Vic-
toria than in Canada, upon which he rejoined that by adding
�140,401, one-third of the amount paid for salaries, the total
would be �074,113, exclusive of buildings. This additional
cost for salaries, he says, brings out the result as compared with
Victoria as below ;

These figures, to all who study whem, ought to show what our
Victorian Fetich is costing the people in cash, as well as in
something dearer than money.
Very Poor Padding.
There are many pages of ? Observations? devoted to tedious
technical questions, such as ?where primary education ends and
the higher education commences ; the troubles of the educated
poor; the necessities of using the rod; the merits and de-
merits of ? cramhow teachers should be paid ; and the evils
of sending infants to school ?? all of which, though we may
most powerfully and potently believe, yet we hold it not wisdom
to have thus set down ? in a treatise of this nature.
A P/ing at the Churches.
It is not, however, until half the ? Observations? have been
made, that the author gets to the heart of his subject? u teaching
religion in the State schools.? He has been holding himself in
hitherto, trying his paces, testing his wind ; but now he gives
himself a free rein, and fairly runs (when he does not stagger)
a tilt at every ecclesiastical windmill. The old fire tries to
flicker up again, as the veteran feebly revels and frolics, at-
tempting to knock over what Mr. John Woods delights to call


the ? Superstition Shops,? with a fine impartiality that causes
a visible glow of satisfaction. Dean Macartney and the ? Bible
in State Schools League,? Mr. Archer and ? The Education
League,? Archdeacon Slattery and ? the free and flashing
sword,? Dean Milman and the Church of England Rubric,
the Melbourne Presbytery and its ? Moderators,? Roman
Catholic absolution, Episcopalian ordination, Bishop Moor-
house, and ? the principles of Romanist dogma,? come in for
pell-mell pokes, up-and-down cuts, bantering blows, and play-
ful side-hits in passing. And yet there is no power, even if
there were the will, to seriously hurt anybody. It is all done
in a feebly good-humored way, and nobody ought to feel a whit
the worse when it is over ?save, perhaps, that the actor, sitting
down and calmly surveying his own antics, may feel a little
sorry that in his exuberance he exhibited himself so unre-
servedly. There is no malice in his gibes, and even when he
tries to be most bitingly severe upon the Roman Catholic
Bishop of Wellington, or upon what he calls ?the bits of ob-
solete priest-craft in that Cranmer-made compilation of com-
promise, the Protestant prayer-book,? there is more fun than
ferocity in his attacks. Indeed, they are scraps of polemics
that have no raison d'etre in ? Observations on the Working of
the Victorian Education Act,? and are thrown in evidently by
the author, not to enforce any point of his subject, but because
the ? old man, sir, must be talking,? and he wanted to have
? a fling at the churches.? The latter would be exceedingly
ill-conditioned indeed if they begrudged the genial disputant
his harmless little pleasantries. We have no present business
with them.
Cash and Conscience.
But as Sir Archibald prides himself on his logic, there are
just three points on which we may profitably ask him to revise
his position. The first is when he ridicules the intimate rela-
tion between cash and conscience. The second is where he
denies that a Victorian State school may be as offensive to a
Catholic as a Canadian Catholic school to a Protestant. The
third is his contention that the disproportionate cost of Catholics
in gaols, reformatories, and charitable institutions, may be
pleaded as a set-off to the money-wrong (if any) suffered by
Catholics in the Education Vote.
We are concerned to correct this false logic of the author
on these special points, only because they happen to be floating
fallacies that are pretty widely spread, and Sir Archibald has
but given form and substance to them.
As to the cash-conscience then. The author quotes question


'2250, page 118* of the Royal Commission?s Report, and
Archdeacon Slattery?s answer to it:?
? I want to see where this legislation touches the Catholic conscience.?
Answer. ?? It touches their pockets.?
And upon this the pamphleteer remarks : ?? It would thus
appear that, according to our candid and logical Archdeacon,
the word conscience and pounds, shillings, and pence, are
synonymous and convertible terms.? The next few pages are
designed to show that as the question is one of cash it has
nothing to do with conscience.
Now, this point is susceptible of very brief disposal. A
parable on all fours with the case will probably convince the
author of his error. Let us suppose that Sir Archibald is
compelled to join a Barristers? Union, one of the rules of which
obliges every member to subscribe to a common fund for the
purchase of wigs and gowns. But instead of purchasing wigs
and gowns of different sizes to suit the various members, the
Union Executive decree that all those articles shall be of one
uniform size, and that three sizes too small for Sir Archibald?s
capacious brain and manly shoulders. He protests, and de-
mands an article he can wear. The Executive reply ;?? We
are determined to maintain inviolate our present system without
fear, favor, or affection of or for any member whatever. If you
try our wigs and gowns long enough you will come to like them
well in time. What suits one man ought to suit another.?
And Sir Archibald is forced to accept the dictum , and is
mulcted because he is not a mannikin and cannot do with the
stunted vesture of a dwarf.
Just in the same way the Catholic declares that the emascu-
lated State school system is much too small for him. It will
not cover the demands of his conscience, which revolts at the
stunted and dwarfed Education wig and gown of the Secularist.
The Catholic protests, and Sir Archibald replies : ?? We are
determined to maintain inviolate our present system, &c.
What suits a Secularist ought to suit a Catholic.? And so the
Catholic is fined for conscience sake. A money penalty may
destroy freedom of person or freedom of conscience. Sir
Archibald can now see the intimate relation between cash
and conscience. There is no need to follow that point any
further.
Catholic and Protestant Tolerance compared.
The second point is contained in the following piece of
false logic :
Reverse the present relative proportions of the population, and let us
suppose that our little State consisted of three-fourths Romanists and one*


fourth Protestant, with a Parliament and Government to correspond.
Would such a Roman Catholic Government be likely to listen to Pro-
testants demanding as subjects ?not as Protestants ?separate provision foi
purely Protestant Schools? ?Yes,? say some ot the Roman Catholic
witnesses. ? The Romanists do this in Canada, where a Roman Catholic
population do not object to separately State-aided Protestant Schools.
Hut note the substantial and essential difference between the Victorian and
the Canadian cases. In the Romanist populations of Lower Canada, the
tenets of the Roman Catholic faith are inculcated in the schools themselves.
To compel the Protestant children to go to such schools, would be to ex-
pose them to the possibility, if not probability, of being proselytised into
Romanism, and this would not be endured. No such liability hangs over
the Catholic child who goes to a State school in this colony ', where no
teacher is allowed to teach anything that can offend the religious feelings
of any one.
The italics are ours. We shall refer to them directly. A
couple of extracts from the Commission?s Report will best dis-
pose of the question quoted above. At page 319 Mr. Andrew
Harper gives evidence as follows ;
10,487. ?In Lower Canada the majority would probably be Catholics,
and in Upper Canada Protestants? Overwhelmingly so, and in Lower
Canada the majority arc Catholics. I believe the minority of Protestants
is smaller there than the minority of Catholics in Upper Canada.
10,488.--! think you will find that the Catholics in Lower Canada treat
the Protestants with exceptional liberality, and I want to know whether
you speak of the whole of Canada? Up to 1871! it was precisely the
same in both Upper and Lower Canada, except that the Protestants are
rather more liberally dealt with in Losvcr Canada than the Catholics in Upper
Canada. The Protestants in Lower Canada could have a separate school
whenever they desired it, without any restriction as to numbers, while the
Catholics in Upper Canada had to number five householders
But of course, as against that, you must remember that the schools in
Lower Canada were entirely sectarian.
That quotation exactly fits and fully answers Sir A. Michie?s
first question as to whether a Catholic majority in any State
would listen to a Protestant demand for purely Protestant
schools.
Now let us see what his reason is worth where he attempts
to establish a difference between the Victorian and Canadian
cases. Strangely enough, he pleads in the italicised lines re-
ferred to above, that the absence of all dogmatic teaching in
the Victorian State schools is a reason why Catholics cannot
be offended in them. And yet he well knows that it is this
very phase of secularism that is most offensive to Catholics.
It is the one great reason for which they condemn the State
schools. Catholics very logically and justly regard Secularists
as a sect, and as the most dangerous of all sects. Of all ? isms?
the most offensive, the most destructive, the worst in their eyes
is Secularism, the very monster whose Temple is the State


school. A Catholic child attending one of these schools?to
((note Sir A. Michie?s own words?? is exposed to the possi-
bility, if not probability, of being proselytised into ? Secularism.
This is what, with a singular absence (indeed a total lapse) ot
logical acumen, Sir A. Michie either cannot or will not under-
stand. And yet it is plain to demonstration that by assuming
the inoffensiveness of State schools (the thing most strongly
denied) he is simply begging the very question at issue. Does
he ask for evidence ? This is what Rev. Thomas Cahill
says, page 123, question 2324 :
Now we believe that in the school the character of the child is formed.
We believe that the child is affected by all its surroundings in the school.
What are the surroundings for a Catholic child in the State school ? The
teaching of the Catholic religion is utterly excluded. The faith of the child
is exposed to danger by such exclusion.
this passage, as well as the whole controversy of the last
ten years, shows that to the Catholic mind this Secularism is
the most pernicious of all ? isms,? and more objectionable than
Protestantism, because its underlying principle is a blank denial
of all religion.
Therefore no Canadian Protestant could be more offended
in a Catholic school than is a Catholic conscience in a sectarian
State school. And so the whole of this second point of Sir A.
Michie comes down with a crash, and shows his logic as faulty
and his reasoning just about as sound as his theory about cash-
consciences. He is not, poor man, what he was twenty years
agone.
Sir A. Mickies Reason why it is Right to Wrong
Catholics.
If anything, he is still more unhappy in his third point,
where he contends that if he can show that it costs more pro-
portionately to govern Catholics than Protestants in gaols,
reformatories, and charitable institutions, the State has a right
to recoup itself from the former section of the community out
of the Education Vote. Putting aside the plea that making
Education penal or dear is not just the best method of relieving
the prisons and the reformatories?as the English penal laws
against Catholic Education in Ireland amply proved?we are
met with the consideration that the inmates of the reformatories
well as hospitals and other charitable institutions (leaving
prisons aside for the time being) are there principally through
poverty or misfortune. Sir Archibald Michie thinks it would
be quite right to treat this poverty as a crime, to visit it with a
penalty, and fine the Catholics as a section of the community
if he can show them to be poor.


And the fact of this fine would scarcely be its worst feature.
The method of its infliction would be still more cruel. If it
were a double tax on the Catholic?s beer and tobacco, it would
be bad enough. But no. He will re-enact in Australia, in
another form, the odious Irish penal laws against Catholic
Education, by making this poor poverty-stricken Catholic pay
twice over before he can get the Education he desires for his
children.
Probably his proposal never struck Sir Archibald in this
way. We rather think indeed that this logical aspect never
dawned upon him, because his pamphlet shows his head to be
none of the clearest, and his heart none of the worst. And
quite probably also those who from time to time use similar
arguments have never thought of the monstrousness which this
view of the case lays bare. If they had we cannot suppose
that they would gravely defend the principle of charging a class
of men twice over for their Education merely because they are
worse off and more in need of charitable help than their neigh-
bors.
Sir A. Michie's Class Taxation Proposals.?The dilemma
they land him in.
So much by way of reply to the items of reformatories and
charitable institutions. Taking for the nonce?unquestioned
and unanswered ?the statements as to the undue numbers of
Catholics in the gaols, let us see what logical connection there
is between that alleged fact and the equal rights of Catholics in
the Education Vote. . .
Sir Archibald makes much of his argument that if it be
true that the Catholics cost more than their share in the gaols,
then the Catholics outside the gaols may be called upon to
make good the amount in the Education vote.
There are some fallacies best refuted by the reductio ad
absurdum method. This is one of them. We shall therefore
first remark that all inmates of gaols are imprisoned not be-
cause they are black, white, old, young, merry or sad ; not
because they are orthodox or infidel, sceptic or pagan, Catholic
or Protestant?but simply because they are law-breakers or
criminals. Hitherto the criminal only has been punished for
his crime. But Sir A. Michie proposes to alter all this, and to
visit the sins of special sections of the criminal classes upon
corresponding sections of uncriminal classes in the community.
Being himself a Protestant, he proposes in his liberality to
commence with the Catholics. But the classifications will have
to be indefinitely extended. For instance, a scientific and care-


ful research may show that merry men are more criminal than
sad men, or vice versa ; that red-bearded men produce more
villains than do those with black beards; that barristers and
politicians furnish an unconscionable proportion of rogues;
and that the priests and presbyters of Sir A. Michie?s pet
aversion scarcely trouble the turnkeys at all. At any rate, on
the basis of the Michie argument it will be necessary to ascer-
tain these points. Because it is quite clear that if orderly
Catholics are to pay the exact proportionate cost of their
criminal co-religionists, the same rule must hold true respecting
lawyers, doctors, ministers, tinkers, tailors, red beards, black
beards, the merry and the sad. If classification is to commence,
it must go all round. Thus if it be found that merry men
supply the largest class of prisoners, then every smiling face
outside a prison must either drape itself in solemn black and
cultivate a
? dejected ?haviour of the visage,?
or pay a fine to recoup the extra prison expenditure on the
surplus of merry men there. Indeed, this very thing was
gravely proposed the other day in one of the Melbourne papers,
when it was urged that beer and spirit drinkers, and not the
general public, should be called upon to find the money to
pay the compensation for houses that may be closed at the in-
stance of the teetotallers.
Doubtless this is turning Sir A. Michie?s elaborate argu-
ment into ridicule. But it must be remembered that it was he,
and not we, who put the ridiculous element into it. We have
merely unveiled and exposed it.
Catholic Dogma and Crime.
These are some of the reflections that are evoked by a
perusal of the ? Observations on the Working of the Victorian
Education Act.? There only remains one other question of
any immediate public interest, and that is to inquire how far
it is true that the Roman Catholics, as such, are a dispropor-
tionate tax upon our prison management.
To give a complete answer to this question would lead us
into the region of moral philosophy, and into a wide array of
statistics?a process in itself exceedingly interesting, but not
quite fitted for a popular treatise. We should have to trace the
course and current of society?s more hidden sins and immorali-
ties, as they operate before they ultimate in crime against the
law and come under the ken of the policeman. Racial
differences would have to be examined, each with its dominat-


ing vices, some deep, corrupting, cunning, and concealed, filming
? the ulcerous place;
Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
Infects unseen
and other vices exploding openly into breaches of the human
statute. These speculations would all be necessary before
justice could be done to the subject which Sir Archibald has
touched upon and airily drawn conclusions from. But as we
have said, this is not the place for them.
In the meantime, Sir A. Michie has himself saved us from
the necessity of a complete answer in the present case by the
fatuous use he has made of his hastily-generalised facts. He
says :
The cause or causes of the remarkable excess of Roman Catholic crime
and its inevitably consequent check to the prosperity of the community, is
as important a social question as the reader can address himself to. Is it
too much to say that there is at least evidence that the cause, latent as it
may be to many, lies in some of the principles of Romanist dogma ?
Such a question as that, as we shall see, puts him at once
out of court on his own arguments, without appealing to the
higher knowledge indicated above. This is so, because, if that
contention of his were true, the facts alleged in Victoria would
be general. In all the other colonies, in America, in Germany,
in England, Ireland, and Scotland?wherever Catholics and
Protestants were living together?the same causes would pro-
duce the same effects?the Romanist dogma would bring forth
crime. Now, not only is this not true, but it is grotesquely
false, and nobody has ever yet put forward a hint of such a
thing. Indeed the disproof is close at hand. For instance, in
South Australia, where the Catholic population is only 16 per
cent, as against nearly 25 in Victoria, the proportion of re-
corded crime to the population is larger than in this colony,
showing an instance where the fewer the Catholics the greater
the crime.
If we turn to Queensland, we find the proportion of
Catholics 28 per cent., while the crime average is almost ex-
actly the same as in South Australia, where Catholics are little
more than half as numerous.
In New Zealand, Catholics number only 14 85 per cent, of
the population, and yet there is more crime there recorded than
in Victoria, where Catholics are nearly twice as many.
Passing to New South Wales, the same examples follow us.
The proportion of Catholics is 28-54, almost the same as in
Queensland, and yet the amount of convicted crime is double,
and more than three times that in Victoria, showing that there


is no relation whatever between the Catholic religion and the
crime tables.
High State of Irish Morality .
But the capital confutation of Sir Archibald?s enlightened
and liberal theory remains. According to his contention,
Catholic Ireland?the land par excellence of Catholic faith and
principle, the jewel of religious fidelity in the Pope?s tiara ?
we can say this with propriety, not being Irish ourselves ?
ought to be a pandemonium of crime. If ?Romanist dogma?
tends to propagate crime, then we shall find ultra-Romanist
Ireland to be a hissing amongst the nations, a very sink-hole
of iniquity. Let us see how this theory is borne out by facts?
by the book of facts that Sir Archibald Michie likes to go to,
but which he uses only just so far as it suits one side of his
subject.
?Hayter informs us that in Ireland commitments average
only 8 per cent., that is fewer than those in Victoria, and not
half those in New South Wales. The per-centage of convic-
tions in Ireland is still fewer than in either Victoria or New
South Wales. In fact, recorded crime in Ireland is less than
the average of England and Wales, or Scotland, or of the whole
of the Australian colonies. (See Hayter, pp. 32, 521, ;>3O).
The following is an analysis of Hayter?s crime tables,
showing the number ot convictions to every 10,000 of the
population for the places named, and they are ranged in the
order of their criminality ;
Western Australia?average 7 years 15T6

We have confined ourselves to convictions only, in all the
countries and colonies named, because these afford the only
safe evidence of crime. Mere arrests would be a fallacious
test. But the case is just the same if we leave the criminal
records, and touch upon those deadly sins that have branded
London as the ? modern Babylon,? and the recent exposure of
which in the Pall Mall Gazette has caused a thrill of horror
through Christendom. Ultra-Catholic Ireland stands out con-
spicuous for its purity. Let Hayter speak again

Here, once more, we have ultra-Catholic Ireland setting an
example of purity to the nations.
These facts are recorded in the same book from which Sir
Archibald Michie professes to have drawn the material for
his theoretic popgun. They show that a little learning is a
dangerous thing, and that Sir Archibald Michie has not
learned the A.B.C. of statistical study.
But we have not done with him yet. He has brought out
his case against Catholic crime in Victoria only by confining
himself to one single table of one single year in Mr. Hayter?s
book, and by ignoring others which put a different complexion
on the subject. At page 509 of Hayter is a table as fob
lows :

Now, that table shows the number of convicted Catholics,
even in this colony, to be the merest fraction above their due
proportion in the community?a fraction which may turn on
the other side at any time, and on which no argument can be
possibly built, quite irrespective of the figures previously
quoted as to the crime in Ireland and other places ; and it
leaves the suspicion that Sir Archibald Michie, with true pro-
fessional instinct, was more intent on ? making a case ? than
on getting to the very truth and the heart of his subject,


What True Catholic Teaching tends to.
Sir A. Michie sends a Parthian arrow at the Catholic
Church. He took it out of Macaulay?s quiver. Macaulay, he
reminds us, wrote that Catholic countries always fell behind
Protestant states?? Whoever, knowing what Italy and
Scotland are, and what 400 years ago, they actually were, shall
now compare the country around Rome with the country around
Edinburgh, will be able to form some judgment as to the
tendency of Papal domination.? And so on, and so on.
The fact of Sir A. Michie quoting this sort of writing as a
commentary upon the Catholic Church shows that he has
learned nothing since Macaulay?s time of the principles ofmoral
theology. Had he ever read Cardinal Newman?s Eighth
Lecture on Anglican Difficulties , he could never have
perpetuated Macaulay?s blunder. We wish we could quote
that lecture in full. It loses flavor in mutilation. But a
few extracts must serve, with a reference of the reader to the
complete text. The learned prelate first states the case against
Catholicism even more strongly than did Macaulay :
You are much offended, you say, with the bad state of Catholics abroad,
and their uninteresting character everywhere, compared with Protestants,
Those countries, you say, which have retained Catholicism, are notoriously
behind the age ?they have not kept up with the march of civilization; they
they are ignorant, and in a measure, barbarous; they have the faults of bar-
barians; they have no self command; they cannot be trusted. They must
be treated as slaves, or they rebel; they emerge out of their superstitions
in order to turn infidels. They cannot combine and coalesce in social in-
stitutions; they want the very faculty of citizenship. The sword, not the
law, is their ruler. They are spectacles of idleness, slovenliness, want of
spirit, disorder, dirt, dishonesty. There must, then, be something in their
religion to account for this; it keeps them children, and then, being
children, they keep to it.
Such are the alleg*ations Newman sets himself to give a
reply to. That reply is a triumphant one in its fulness. He
does not admit the picture, but answers it as if it were true.
He commences with the pregnant enquiry as to what are the
aims of the Church, and points out that those'aims are the very
opposite of the world?s aims :
The world believes in the world?s ends as the greatest of goods
Evil, says the world, is whatever is an offence to me, whatever obscures
my majesty, whatever disturbs my peace The Church looks
and moves in a simply opposite direction It looks beyond the
outward act, on and into the thought, the motive, the intention, the will.
? ?????? O, most tender loving Mother, ill-judged by the world,
which thinks she is, like itself, always minding the main chance
The Church overlooks everything in comparison of the immortal soul.
_ ? She knows no evil but sin She has one and
only one aim?to purify the heart The one idea that sin is the


The world too, as is necessary, has its scale of offences as well as the
Church; but referring them to a contrary object, it classifies them on quite
a contrary principle; so that what is heinous in the world may be regarded
patiently by the Church, and what is horrible and ruinous in the judgment
of the Church may fail to exclude a man from the best society of the world.
All questions implying the existence of the soul, are as much
beyond the circuit of the world?s imagination, as they are intimately and
primarily present to the apprehension of the Church ? ? ? lc
Church pronounces the momentary wish, if conscious and deliberate, that
another should meet with his death, or suffer any other grievous misfortune,
as a blacker sin than a passionate unpremeditated attempt on the life of the
Sovereign Polished, delicate-minded ladies, with little of
temptation around them, and no self-denial to practice, in spite of their
refinement and taste, if they be nothing more, are objects of less interest to
her than many a poor outcast who sins, repents, and is with difficulty kept
just within the territory of grace. Again, excess of drinking is one of the
world?s most disgraceful offences ; odious it ever is in the eyes of the
Church; but if it does not proceed to the loss of reason, she thinks it a
far less sin than one deliberate act of detraction, though the matter of it be
truth The Church professes to judge after the judgment of
the Almighty. His judgment is not as man?s?? I judge not according
to the looks of men,? He says, ? for man seeth those things which appear,
but the Lord beholdeth the heart.? The Church aims at realities, the
world at decencies All I would say to the world is Keep
enemy of the soul; and that sin especially consists, not in overt acts, but in
the thoughts of the heart.
The Church aims, not at making a show, but at doing a work
She holds that it were better for sun and moon to drop from heaven, for
the earth to fail, and for all the many millions who are upon it to die of
starvation in extremest agony, so far as temporal affliction goes, than that
one soul, I will not say should be lost, but should commit one single venial
sin, should tell one wilful untruth, though it harmed no one, or steal one
poor farthing without excuse She would rather save the soul of
one single wild bandit of Calabria, or whining beggar of Palermo, than
draw a hundred lines of railroad through the length of Italy, except so far
as these great natural works tended to some spiritual good beyond them.
She is sent to seek the lost; ?that is her first object, and she
will fulfil it, whatever comes of it.
He then asks how it is that Catholic countries happen to be
behind Protestants in civilization ? He refuses to admit all
that is alleged on the subject, except hypothetically, and then
adds that if it were really so?
Then all I can say is that it is not wonderful that civil governments
which profess these objects, should succeed better than the Church, which
does not. Not till the State is blamed for not making saints, may it be
fairly laid to the fault of the Church that she cannot invent a steam engine
or construct a tariff.
And again, speaking of the Church?s code contrasted with
the world?s ?
your theories to yourself; do not inflict them upon the sons of Adam every-
where; do not measure heaven and earth by views which arc in a great
degree insular, and never can be philosophical and catholic. \ou do your


work, perhaps, in a more business-like way, compared with ourselves, but
we are immeasurably more tender and gentle and angelic. We come to
pool human nature as the angels of God, and you as policemen.
And so he goes eloquently on to elaborate the beautiful
argument, and show that the Church?s kingdom, like Christ?s,
is not of the world. It never can be distinguished bv its riches,
s . laxui T> P om P> its mammon worship. The highest
civilization may often co-exist with the deepest and darkest
of spiritual degradation. Your Macaulays and your Michies, in
their shallow worldly wisdom, judge by the world?s standards.
1 hey are right, they know no other gauge. God does, and so
does his true Church.
If we chose to paint the obverse of the picture, how easy
would it be to show what the mere excess of riches and
Protestant civilization lead to. The horrible white slave
traffic of London would guide us to a good deal. Remember
what Bishop Moorhouse said the other day :
Mr. Moody is no alarmist. He is a shrewd man, with a keen eye
and a large knowledge of the masses of England. And what did he say
the other day, in the presence of 5000 men in Liverpool ? ?You are
altogether mistaken in supposing that it is intemperance which is the
chief sin of England. What is eating into the heart of your noble
country is the sin of impurity.? Now I know where I stand, and I know
the solemn responsibility which lies on me to tell the truth in this
matter?no more and no less ; and speaking under the sense of that
responsibility, I say that I have good reason for repeating Mr. Moody?s
warning here. Emphatically the great danger of our young men is not
diunkenness, but impurity. Our warmer sun, our lonely forests, the early
age at which our young people earn considerable wages, even the
sectilav tone of our thought , all contribute to this result. And the
danger is not distant. It is upon us.
This is unanswered, almost undisputed. What a mockery,
then, lor smug- Protestant pharisees of the Michie and Macaulay
order to condemn Catholic Italy and Spain tor their lack of steam
machinery and material wealth, without taking into account that
material wealth may he a curse to a man or a nation that knows
not how to use it save in multiplying luxury and sin. If it be
true that Catholic States are less rich than Protestant ones, may
the explanation not be that they have been better led on the
lines of Holy Scripture?? Seek ye first the kingdom of God
and his justice, and all these things shall be added unto you.?
Summing up.
If his whole pamphlet were intended as a grim joke, the Jest
is a bad one, because the humor is even Jess than were
Grat.iano?s reasons, ? as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels
of chaff: you shall seek all day ere you find them, and


colony ??
when you have them they are not worth the search. Eut
if on the other hand it was designed as a serious contribution to
the elucidation of a very important question, it is altoget lei
unfortunate. So far as we can gather, it sheds no light any where,
but tends instead to raise all the theological dust possible so as
to obscure the points at issue. The quality of its reasoning we
have shown; its superficial grasp of facts we have also illustrated;
its purpose we can only guess at ?a sort of mischevious challenge
to the sectarian spirit, and a trailing of the coat tails to the sects,
themselves. It is just such a book as a frolicsome light-headed
ill informed young man might have written, who had more
leisure than sense to employ it. The world might have forgiven
the young fool for his folly; but when hoar age, either from
impotence or frivolity, falls into the excesses of thoughtless
youth, burlesques all religion, and strives, even though it be in
jest to set the various churches by the ears, one can only wondei
and exclaim?? Is it indeed possible that this poor light-hearted
creature ever lived in London as the representative of this great
