Preface
The idea for die present book first came to me some years ago when Mr John Lust, librarian
of the Chinese section in the Library of the School of Oriental and African Studies in
London University, showed me their copy of the San-ts'ai t‘u-hui in the reserve
collection. Not, however, until late autumn in 1978 was the publication assured by the
cooperation of the English and American publishers handling the book. Although long
meditated, the final research and writing has been done in a short space of time, and not all
aspects have been examined in the same detail.
The stth has 150 Chinese volumes or fascicules and to choose only 120 plates from such
a large number was not easy. Some sections could be quickly eliminated since they were
either unillustrated or only had crudely drawn diagrams. Several sections have excellent
pictures but had to be passed over since their annotation would have needed more time for
research in unfamiliar fields than was going to be available. Inevitably the selection is a
personal one, reflecting my interests, but it has been based on certain principles. First, that
the pictures chosen should be good, and that the subjects feature in Chinese art and literature.
A further consideration was that the parallels between Chinese and European lore about
strange races and animals should be illustrated.
Apart from the way the stth has been used by successive generations of Chinese
editors the fact that a Japanese edition was published in 1715 means that it was a potential
source for artists’ patterns there too. Some supplementary illustrations from paintings,
carvings and the Japanese illustrated encyclopedias have been included to point to the way
in which the woodcuts reflect subjects used by artists.
Some books, such as the encyclopedia itself, are referred to frequently and these have
been given abbreviations based on the first letter of the romanization of the Chinese or
Japanese characters in the title, a method commonly used in books on Chinese studies. All
references to sources are given in the text in () referring to the serial number of the item
in the bibliography followed by the volume and part if needed and then the page and plate
numbers as required.
This book could not have been produced without the help of many friends in the School
of Oriental and African Studies and elsewhere. Without Mr Graham Hutt’s work on the
translations, no easy matter with so carelessly edited a text, and his advice on questions of
interpretation it would not have been possible to produce the book. My thanks for
encouragement and help in elucidating bibliographical problems are due to Mr Lust and
Brian Hickman, the librarian of the Japanese section of the library; Mr Kenneth Gardner
of the British library helped in getting the photographs of the books in their collection;
Mr Gavin Bridson, librarian of the Linnaean Society of London helped with advice on
locating botanical and zoological works, as did the staff at the British Museum, Victoria and
Albert Museum, the London Library and the Percival David Foundation with books and
advice in several fields. The illustrations are largely the work of Mr Paul Fox of the School
of Oriental and African Studies and the owners of other objects kindly provided pictures.
The book is dedicated to a very dear friend who, by her interest and encouragement
when things were not going smoothly, greatly helped me.

1 The San-ts‘ai f u-hui
Reference books have a longer continuous history in China than in any other culture, and
several of the oldest ones are still, with their commentaries, in constant use by scholars. The
encyclopedia, Lei-shu - categories of writings, was, however, seldom illustrated, and some
of the earliest examples of the genre are known only from the dynastic histories (9 and
191). Most of them consist of quotations, beginning with the Classics and including later
writers, arranged under various headings and subheadings. These often preserve parts of
long lost books and may have a better text than the current editions of whole works which
have survived (178.107). Designed to provide busy administrators with summaries of
current knowledge, or as a writer’s manual, there was little call for illustration. Their
organization differs, growing in complexity, but a Sung encyclopedia has four main
sections: Heaven, earth, man, plants and animals (191.119). A similar classification was used
in the first Chinese dictionary, th eErh-ya, a Han explanation of difficult words in the
Classics, and a Sung illustrated edition of this is known (42).
The stth, or Tripartite picture assembly, is classified as an encyclopedia of arts and
crafts (191.143) but, while it does include instruction on calligraphy, painting, playing the
lute, etc., its general structure follows the normal pattern described above. The emphasis
on the illustrations relates it to the Chinese school books; a fifteenth-century example,
perhaps reproducing a Sung original, has recently been reprinted (81). Certainly Yosai
Nakamura’s Kinmo zui, published in 1666, seems to build on such slight foundations to give
a useful introduction to knowledge current in Japan at the beginning of the Edo period.
The illustrations of plants, birds and animals, each with a small landscape setting, look back
to the style of the Sung illustrations to th cErh-ya.
Compiled by Wang Ch‘i, 11. 1565-1614, who spent much of his life in study and writing
at his studio called Plum Blossom Stream near Shanghai, the stth was published at
Nanking in about 1610 (58.2.1355-6). It was compiled from a number of older illustrated
books, of which only the lute manual discussed in chapter v has been certainly identified,
and some excellent drawing books. The quality of the illustrations varies greatly, some of
the carvers making the blocks seem to have been much less skilled than others, and none
would have improved on the original material being copied. Although it has been
criticised quite severely by some of the western writers who have noted it in their books
(191.144; 218.149-50), it has been much used in China, especially for its illustrations, and is
quoted by both the eighteenth-century encyclopedia (91) and the most recent dictionary
(38) -
A Japanese version of the stth, the Wakan Sansai Zui was apparently published in 1715,
but the contents, while roughly the same, are much altered. Several sections are omitted
altogether, and in those retained the sequence is altered to such an extent that it is difficult to
check one with the other. The illustrations are much smaller, set in a compartment at one
side or in the centre of the page, and the Chinese characters are provided with a phonetic
transcription in Kana and often with their seal script forms. The latter, which are not found
in the stth captions, reflects thejapanese interest in Tensho, seal script, which began in the
Edo period calligraphy. The edition of the ws z used for comparison is in the British
Library and has extensive annotations in French and English, including translations of most
of the titles to the fascicules, in an eighteenth-century Dutch(?) hand.
