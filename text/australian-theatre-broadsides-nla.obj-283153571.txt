“ Robbing Peter to pay Paul ” is said
to have originated in an act of the Church
government of England, in 1560. At
that time St. Paul’s Cathedral, being out

tion of the income of Westminster, which
was consecrated to St. Peter, was diverted
to the repair of St. Paul’s.

Are the Natural Cure for
MEASLES, lifLllliA,
HUIALiIA and EIIUIATISI.
Mrs. A. T. HANNAH, who was
absolutely cured of the fearful weaken-
ing effects of Measles after doctors had
failed, writes gratefully to us as follows :
Ledge, N.B.
“ To the Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co. :
Dear Sirs, —At the age of seventeen I was
taken with the measles, and I never re-
covered from their effects. My blood
seemed to have turned to water, and I
was pale and a victim to fainting and
hysterical fits. I was doctored by nearly
every doctor in town, without any bene-
fit. At last I decided to try Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills, and soon found
their beneficial effect, and to-day I am a
married woman, and as well as ever I
was in my life. I have not had the
slightest recurrence of my trouble, and
I am indebted o Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills for my health and strength,
and I believe these pills are the best
medicine in the world. I constantly ad-
vise all my friends who may be ailing to
Cured of Measles. try them.”
PALE GIRLS ARE MADE BRIGHT. HANDSOME & BLOOMING
What can be more distressing than to see a girl drooping and fading in the spring-
time of her youth. Instead of bright eyes, glowing, rosy cheeks, and an elastic step,
there are dull eyes, pale, yellow, or greenish pomplexion, and a languidness of step
that bespeaks disease and an early death if proper treatment is not promptly
resorted to and persisted in until the impoverished blood is enriched, and the func-
ions of life become regular.
Upon parents rests a great responsibility at the time their daughters are budding
into womanhood. If your daughter is pale, complains of weakness, is “ tired out”
upon the slightest exertion ; if she is troubled with headache or backache, pain in the
side ; if her temper is fitful and her appetite poor, she is in a condition of extreme
peril, a fit subject for the most dreaded of all diseases—-Consumption. If you notice
any of the above symptoms, lose no time in procuring Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills.
They will assist the patient to develop properly and regularly ; they will enrich the
blood and restore health’s roses to the cheeks ; bright eyes and lightness of step will
surely follow their use, and all danger of consumption and premature death will t be
averted.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills also cure Biliousness, Kidney-
Troubles, Sciatica, Anaemia, General Debility, Nervous Pros-
tration, Female Troubles, Indigestion, Insomnia, Locomotor
Ataxia, Paralysis, and Winter Ailments. Sold by Chemists and
Storekeepers, and by the Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co., Sydney

Du Maurier was a thorough worshipper

Madame Bernhardt will not exercise,
and hates fruit, unless she happens to feel
in a mood for eating it, and still she has
a, handsome head of hair, which some of
the doctors say is quite remarkable, in
view of the fact that fruit and exercise
make beautiful hair. She makes her hair
grow winter and summer by exposing it.
For several hours a day it hangs down her
back, with the air blowing through it and
the sun touching it. Her theory is that
wherever the hairpins touch the hair it
will be dull and glossless.

To the Bile Bean Manufacturing Co.
Dear Sirs, —I have been for some years subject to Biliousness and
Headache, and, seeing Bile Beans were so extensively advertised, 1
decided to give them a trial, and accordingly put myself under a short
course. I can truthfully state that I experienced relief from the
beginning, and to-day I feel in perfect health. I can conscientiously
recommend Bile Beans to anyone suffering from Biliousness and
Constipation. You are at perfect liberty to publish this statement
when and where you please.

in the world at Detriot, Michigan, U.S.A. They have been used
throughout that country for years by the most eminent medical men.
Every pill is a dose, and their great worth lies in the fact that they
act directly on the bile ducts, and do not purge or strain the bowels,
therefore avoiding all vile after-effects that follow the using of nearly
all purgative medicines sold to-day. They are an undoubted specific
for Headache. Indigestion, Constipation, Debility, Dyspepsia, Piles,

IMPORTANT TO LADIES.
Medical men and scientists Just now are
concerning themselves much about the health
of women and growing girls, and there cannot
be any doubt a vast amount of good has been
done in awakening a general interest in the
subject. The great truth has been forced oaf
all concerned, that our race cannot progress
unless our women folks are sound, healthy and
strong. All writers agree that most of the
reform required for woirien lies in the question
of dress, and of all articles of attire required
the Corset is believed to be the most important.
Many medical men are of the opinion that
the Corset either builds up or interferes with
the health of women. Science has come direct
to the relief of women on this essential of dress,
the outcome of which is the French P.D.
Corset
These Corsets are a scientific perfection.
T hey not only give an elegant shape to the form
by holding it well together, but, being so flexible,
they conform to every movement of the figure,
thus giving support and the truest sense of
comfort and ease. By wearing a French P.D.
Corset a lady no longer feels cramped within or
without, the free circulation of the blood is not
impeded nor the figure distorted.
