WEEKLY ILLUSTRATED —September 25, 1937
The sort of act by which Ku-Klux-Klan became notorious—lynching of negroes. Lynching above (not
necessarily to be ascribed to K.K.K.) was carried out on Albert Gooden, 25-year-old coloured man accused
of shooting a white officer. Six masked riders seized Gooden from the "protection" of Sheriff Vaughn,
hung him up by a rope, fired 30 shots into him, and dropped Ins body in a creek. Deputy-sheriffs are
seen removing Gooden’s body.
Bodies of Hindus Are Burned on Funeral Pyres. In the days before British
rule, the flames consumed a Hindu’s living widow as well as his corpse.
Hinduism teaches that widowhood results from sins in an earlier life, so
to win a better life, widows used to throw themselves in the fire.
The Practice of Widow Suicide Is Called “Suttee.” Great Britain has for-
bidden suttee, but widows have little to live for. They are regarded as out-
casts, treated as slaves. Because of child-marriages, many are widowed
as girls and are doomed to long unhappy lives.

Managerial Note —
♦fTN presenting this “Revue,” Mr. Arnold wishes to impress
II upon his patrons that this production is quite different to
other “Revues” (such as “Come Over Here,” Tivoli Follies, etc.),
the entire atmosphere of “Step This Way” is novel, sometimes
serious —sometimes gay —sometimes light- —sometimes dramatic —
sometimes operatic, but always REFINED, the action of the
“plot” (?) being laid amid the elegant surroundings of a wonderful new
stvle of drawing room, as a matter of fact there is NO “SCENERY” in
the strict sense of the word, the stage setting is comprised of
but there, you must come and see it to believe it; it is like our
“billing” matter, etc., an artistic study in “BLACK and TANGO.”
The names of the artists in “Step This Way” are household
words in Australia and Great Britain, and they are headed by —
Miss Pearl Ladd.
Miss Pearl Ladd
PRIMA-DONNA of J. C. Williamson (Ltd)
Gilbert & Sullivan Opera Company, etc.
“Punch,” 23/7/14. — “Yeoman of the
Guard.”
Of Miss Pearl Ladd, who played the
leading female character, “Elsie May-
nard,” there is nothing to say but words
of the highest praise. Her acting was
spontaneous, unforced, natural, and when
necessary, pathetic. Although in the
foreground, she never came out of the
picture, but moved through the scenes
with a simple grace, singing charmingly,
and winning the hearts of the audience
as easily and unaffectedly as Elsie May-
nard had won those of Colonel Fairfax
and Jack Point. All her songs and duets
were encored. “ ’Tis Done —-I am a
Bride” was particularly well given, and
the note of pathos and pity for the poor
Merryman was not wanting in the finale.
Miss Ladd unquestionably had much to
do with the brilliant success of the pro-
duction.
Sydney “Sunday Times,” 27/6/15.
The feature of “The Chocolate Soldier”
at Her Majesty’s last night was the
brilliant singing of Miss Pearl Ladd, as
Nadina. Beginning with the “My Hero”
song in the first act, Miss Ladd electri-
fied the audience, winning a storm of
applause. The number which expresses
ardent devotion for her soldier lover was
given with fine dramatic feeling and rap-
turously encored. Both from a singing
and acting standpoint Miss Ladd scored
conspicuously in the part.
In “Stsp This Way” she takes the part of “Lady Fremantle.”

“Morning Herald,” Sydney, 20/11/14.
The most enjoyable moment of the whole
evening was afforded by Mr. Villiers Arnold
in his singing (as Captain Corcoran) of the
tender “Fair Moon,” the charm of his hght
baritone, the skill with which he blended the
registers, and his sympathy with the atmos-
phere of the serenade music, so impressed the
audience that they momentarily forgot to ap-
l plaud, and nearly lost their encore.

ENGLAND’S MOST DELIGHTFUL ENTERTAINER
MISS VIOLET CARMEN comes with a great reputation, earned through
her many successes at all the London and Provincial Halls, and a record tour
of two and a half years with the Brennan-Fuller Management in Australia and
New Zealand. . She has also appeared before their Majesties the King and
Queen, and was personally congratulated by Queen Mary. Miss Carmen specia-
lises in light comedy songs, Original Monologues, Dramatic and Humorous Reci-
tations, etc., etc., A critic on the London Press says:—
“One pauses before writing of Miss Violet Carmen — a beautiful face and
figure, and a wonderful elocutionary and histrionic power are all brought to bear
in her dramatic recital, “The Actress.” In this she displays a marvellous versa-
tility, changing rapidly and easily for portrayals of Lady Macbeth, Portia,
Olivia, Dickensiad characters, Lady Teazle from Sheridan’s “School for
Scandal,” etc., etc. At other times she
makes a hit as a soubrette in duets with
Mr. Alf Lawrance.
Dunedin (King’s Theatre) —“Miss Vio-
let Carmen and Mr. Alf. J. Lawrance,
two skilful and delightful entertainers,
disclosed an act in which polish, wit,
and lucidity were all abundantly present.
Miss Carmen sings with considerable
charm to the accompaniment of her part -
ner, and has a rare gift for that intimate
kind of humour that seems to include
each occupant of the auditorium in the
fun, and Mr. Lawrance is a pianist who
is droll as well as clever. This is one
of the most polished offerings we have
seen here for some time, and can be
truthfully branded as a ‘star act.’ ”

such as “I Like your Apron and your Bonnet,” “Grow, Little Mushroom, Grow,”
“Come along My Mandy,” ”You shall Live in a Chalet,” “Kitty, the Telephone Girl,”
“Come Down the Wanganui,” “I Like Your Old French Bonnet,” and most of the

EILEEN ALEXANDER
“Sittin’ at evenin’ in this sunset land
Wiv ’er in orl the world to ’old me ’and,
A son to bear me name when I am gone—
Livin’ and lovin’, so life mooches on.”
“I only know that kid belongs to me,
We ain’t decided yet wot ’es to be.
I think we ort to make him something great—
A bookie or a champion ’evey weight.”
Read What the Critics Say
“The Sentimental Bloke”
THE PLAY ITSELF NOT the Picture.
“Argus,” Melbourne.
“The feature of the comedy was the excellent work of Walter Cor-
nock in the title role as Bill the Kid. He took the part very seriously,
as becomes a philosopher who is in love, and admirably portrays the
character.”
“Age,” Melbourne.
“ ‘The Sentimental Bloke’ offers an entertainment rich in gay
farce and possesses several scenes of genuine comedy.”
“Herald,” Melbourne.
“It gripped the audience from the first line—was a certain suc-
cess when the first scene closed, and by the end of the second act
had developed into a triumph. A great ‘house’ laughed almost con-
tinuously. The players were recalled after every act, and at the
final curtain the audience insisted upon speeches from the author and
the producer. For warmth of applause and spontaneous enthusiasm
it was one of the most remarkable first nights of recent years.”
“Sun,” Melbourne.
“Another Australian play has had its chance and made good. Rock-
ing with laughter and shouting with delight an Australian audience
has acclaimed the poet C. J. Dennis as a playwright.”
“Bulletin.”
“A full house at Melbourne Theatre Royal on Saturday night gave
a roar of laughter and greeting to Dennis’s ‘Sentimental Bloke.’
The loss of ’Erb’s false teeth is still a matter for complaint by Leslie
Gordon, but his top-note is an octave lower than Tal Ordell’s soar-
ing yodel as a bunny merchant. Since he was last in Melbourne,
Ordell has manufactured a cry like a Stadium fan in training. Also
his manner has grown richer in picturesque suggestion; his easy
competence having developed through steadfast avoidance of bur-
lesque. Walter Cornock’s Bill is as good as ever.”

EIGHT HOURS WITH AN ELEPHANT . . . .
"I'm the kind of guy who is never late
for work. Here we are bright and early."
"Got lots of work to do this morn-
ing. Let's take this in our stride."
"I did this yesterday —Wait
till you see what I do today."
"A trunk is a mighty
handy thing for this work."
"See! This is easy. There
she goes crashing down."
"Swell place to work. I'm
good — got two trees then."
"That guy on my back just came out
for the ride. I do all of the work."
"Some of these trees are plenty hard
to knock over. But they can't lick me."
"I don't belong to any union but I
know just when it's time to quit."
"On the dot of 11 I squint at the
sun and knock off for my lunch."
"Two miles more —wish I could get work nearer home.
Wonder what the wife and kids have been doing today."
"There they are now. How about supper? Man, I'm
famished —been working ever since early morning."
"When it gets cool again I go back to the job for a couple
of hours. There's no point killing yourself for two dollars."
"It's a good thing they tie up those kids
or we'd never have a peaceful moment here."
"Here, son, remember you are
to eat it like a gentleman."
"Guess I'll slip out for a
little drink after supper."
"This one's on me, boys. Say, do you know how many trees
I pushed over today? I'll bet I set an all-time record."

The "QUINS” —Down on Their Selection
YVONNE, sturdiest of the “Quins,” does her gardening
in this easy-going, sitting-down fashion. Try it if you
want to ease the toil of weeding and digging. And what
do you think of her togs?
“JUST LAUGH ALL DAY, and turn your work into play,” says Emilie, as three other “Quins”
bend their backs in the serious toil of spring gardening. Ten hands are better than two for this
job, and you can’t beat a family of quintuplets for getting a comer of the garden dug up quickly.
PAUSING A WHILE from their labors, “Quin” Annette and “Quin” Emilie refresh them-
selves from their tin cups, but their eyes are thoughtfully centred on the patch they’ve just
dug up. They’re debating the kind of flowers they’ll plant.
HERE YOU SEE the Dionne quintuplets, the world’s wonder babies, in a corner of their selection-in
other words, the quintuplets’ playground—in Ontario. Its walls and fences make it look more like a con-
centration camp than the happy, sunny spot in which you’d expect to find the youngsters. They are
lined up in this order—Yvonne,
Annette, Emilie, Marie, and Cecile.
"MY WORD, this flower has the most beautiful perfume,” says Cecile, as she gives her complete atten-
tion to one of the wonders of the garden. These pictures are the first of a new series of the Dienne
quintuplets obtained exclusively by The Australian Women’s Weekly. Others will be published soon.

People of all ages assembled on the banks of the River Avon, near the Armagh Street Bridge, yesterday morning to watch elephants from Wirth's

Letter Writing Competition
DOUBTLESS many of the competitors in the above com-
petition are anxious to know the results, but everything
comes to those who wait; hence we give below the decisions
of Fred Bluett and Elton Black, the former selecting Love Letters
and the latter those of the Friendly type. Percy Mackay was
to have selected the winners of Critical Letters, but his career
was cut short owing to the fact that no letter of this category
was received. After reading the various letters, the publicity man
endorses the decision of the judges.
To publish the letters would certainly take up a considerable
amount of space, and probably embarrass some of the winners, so
we give hereunder the names, class of letter, and prize awarded:—
FRIENDLY LETTER.—Miss Freda Stock-well. Albion, first ; Mr.
A. Thomas, Indooroopilly, second; Mr. Frank Glynn, West
End, third.
LOVE POEM. Mr. J. Quartermaine, Brisbane, first. LOVE
LETTER. Miss Dulcie Barclay, Brisbane, second, Mi.
Sydney Johnson, Morningside, third.
The management thank those who entered into the spirit of the
competition, but up to the present we have not heard of any
engagements or such like being the outcome of the love letters.'
Yet, one never does know until the climax is reached.
Will the ladies, and gentlemen whose names appear above kmdlyj
call for their respective awards.

Mr. GUS BLUETT
To attempt to introduce Gus Bluett to the Brisbane theatre-

doubtful whether any other Comedian is so well known in Bri.
bane Gus is the youngest male member of the Classics, but .
wide experience to his credit, having toured South Africa, England
Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. His first appearance on the stage
was at the age of 10 years, when he assisted his father in the
screaming burlesque “The Boy Scouts” at the Opera House, Mel-
bourne, now known as the Tivoli. Since those days he has per-
formed on nearly every stage of note m Australia, _ one of n
biggest hits being that of “Potifor Bing” in ‘ The Bing Boys on
Broadway” for J. C. Williamson.

On 2d a Day.
THE GRIM YEARS.
By Denzil Batchelor.
JWA is the last place in the world to
recover, or to be recovering, from
the depression. For over six years
I th; Dutch East Indies have suffered
j as hardly as any other place on earth
■ has suffered.
Since the depreciation of the guilder,
in September, 1936, there has come a
period of relief, due not so much to
the lapse from the gold standard as to
the fact that world prices have
risen, and the demand for sugar, tin,
rubber, and copra is brisker.
Java itself is rich or poor almost- according
to the number of lumps of sugar you put into
your tea. (The tea itself, by the by, is likely
to come from Java, too. The Australian Tiade
Commissioner in Batavia told me that Aus-
tralia imports more tea from Java than from
anywhere else. It is sold blended, which is
the reason Java tea it not as much a house-
hold word as Java Coffee.)
Terrible Years.
But it is the sugar industry on which Java’s
wealth is primarily based, and the sugar in-
dustry has recently been going through leaner
years than wool and wheat ever dreamed Cw.
Last year the production of sugar was half
what it was six years ago. Before the de-
pression hit Java like a cyclone, there were
180 sugar refineries working in the island; now
there are 90. Despite the fact that in the
last six months sugar prices have shown an
upward trend, the Government is anxiously
looking round for new industries which could
be made to pay their way, and a match fac-
tory and paper mills are among the new enter-
prises to be subsidised.
The Mayor of Sourabaya, Mr. W. A. H.
Fuchter, specially appointed by the Governor-
General to command of the municipal coun-
cil of this city of 400,000 souls, was one high
Dutch official who spoke to me without
illusions of the little ray of hope the last few
i months had furnished. It was hard to see
in it a portent of a brighter age. Sugar was
not a commodity the world was likely to
clamour for at a fancy price; not counting the
cost, so long as it got what it craved. It had
not thus the advantage of iron and steel, thc-
wespons of war, was the Mayor’s dry com-
ment. Meanwhile, there were the terrible
yea-s of poverty and distress behind this
: sudden boom; much was mortgaged to them.
There were probably 5000 unemployed Euro-
peans in Java. As for the natives, it w T as im-
posable to compute how they had suffered
during the depression. They had silently dis-
appeared into their villages when work was
no ;onger to be had, and no one knew how
thej existed. There was a relief fund that
meted out a dole to air in dire need, natives
and Europeans alike, and the municipality
did what it could to help, but still the suffer-
ing throughout the depression had been very
great. Nor was the harvest of the present
boom startlingly abundant.
Shilling a Week,
Wages are still cruelly low. The manager 1
of a big rubber and coffee estate in East Java
told me that he was paying 8 and 9 cents a
day-less than 3d —for work which just comes
withir the grading of skilled labour. Women
could be found as unskilled labourers for half
as much as that, and unskilled women were
working eight hours a day in factories for
about a shilling a week.
It is affirmed that the Javanese peasant
can live on cents (about a penny) a day.
It depends on what you mean by living. If
you go into a Javanese kampong (native vil-
lage) you can see for yourself the house uy
which such life is sustained. It is bare ahu
.squalid, and stinking. Some mep might care
to kennel'a dbg in such a place; Ido not
know whether the R.S.P.C,A. Would prosecute
them.
With such conditions of life thp Javanese
peasant appears to be perfectly satisfied. He
is a placid, unexcitable type, and appears to
feel no resentment against the man at the
top, which is generally the reaction, just or
unjust, of other races when the stress of life
becomes unendurable. Ten years ago, in the
days before the depression, there was what;
might be termed a pint-size revolution in
Java. The revolt, as it is called, of 1927,
took place in Western Sumatra and the west of
java, and it was instigated from Moscow,,
which used as tools Javanese agitators who
had been trained in Russia. These men were
imprisoned in Java’s special' political peniten-
tiary, and since then the depression has coma
and gone and there has been no civil unrest.
Taxes on Bicycles.
Prices, and especially taxes, are as high as
wages are low. Income tax throughout Java
is probably 50 per cent, higher than it was
in 1931, and a special municipal tax in Soura-
baya raises it to really alarming proportions
in that city. The Government has thought
out certain taxes w’hich make Australian
legislators look feebly unimaginative. There
are two taxes on every bicycle, for instance,
and everyone who possesses furniture has to
pay an annual tax on that too.
It must be stated that the taxpayers’ money
has in many cases been put to excellent use.
The municipality of Sourabaya has a record
of 1600 houses built in 10 years to meet the
needs of poor people of all races anxious to
rise above the atmosphere of slum and kam-
pong. Their rents vary from one guilder
sixty cents (less than 5/) to 50 guilders a
month. I inspected many of them. With free
light and good water supplies, built in pleasant
grassy squares and crescents, they w 7 ere really
attractive homes. I wish I knew where it was
possible to find in Sydney such houses as the
better ones at even five times their rent; and
to the newcomer at least the other costs of
life look quite as expensive in Sourabaya as
in Sydney.
As the position is to-day, the Dutch East
Indies are to Australia a nextdoor neighbour,
with whom, however harmonious relations
may be, it is not easy to do much business.
There are 60,000.000 people living in the
Dutch Indies, of whom certainly 75 per cent,
are too poor to be buyers at all. Last year
Australia and New Zealand exported to the
Dutch Indies goods such as flour, butter in
tins, coal, and so on, to the value of about
£1,000,000 in Australian currency. They
bought in return sugar, tea, coffee, oil, rubber,
kapok, and othei goods to the value of
£3,500,000 (Aust.), a substantial trade balance
against us.
Japan Steps In.
Indications are that the current year will
be from Australia’s point of view the best
trading year with the Dutch East Indies since
the depression. It is, however, a difficult
matter to stimulate these islands to buy from
Australia. It is said to be hard to market
new imports here - generally, as soon as Aus-
tralia has dev a new import, Japan is
able to step in supply the goods more
cheaply.
The Dutch East indies possess a level trade
tariff —there is a wall, a low w r all, against
any importations; but it is a wall which nearly
always remains of the same height for all
competitors to scale. Australian imports find
themselves up against the same duties as
Dutch imports; generally speaking no nation
is favoured. There are, however, one or two
protective tariffs which result in Dutch tex-
tiles finding a market in the Indies at the
expense of cheaper Japanese goods. If you
ask a Dutch official whether such measuies
are expressly undertaken to stop the manufac-
tures of Osaka and Tokyo from flooding the
country, he will assure you that they are
not; but all the same that is their most con-
spicuous effect.
Meanwhile, Java is a lighter-hearted coun-
try than it has been for six nightmare years;
rubber is booming in Sumatra, taxes are paid
to lay down velvety roads for tourists to
motor over; and the little brown man in
white vest and purple skirt gives a lifetime
of labour to those brilliant green acres of cul-
tivation which must eat up every yard of his
island to yield enough to keep him and the
sixty million like him alive, and, mysteriously
enough, not kicking, on about twopence a
riav.
ElepHants Of
T emperament
Miss M. Wirtk’s Views
elephants are the most'
lovable creatures, they are un-
doubtedly the most peculiar mem-
bers of the animal world,” said Miss
Madeline Wirth yesterday.
“Gyp and Lena, the two pigmy
elephants that I have been working
during the present circus season, are
sisters, but they are entirely differ-
ent in temperament. Gyp is always
conscientious at her work, but she
disfikes strangers, and is rather mean
in nature. On the other hand, Lena
is docile and affectionate, and al-
ways seems to be laughing at life.”
Miss Wirth, who was born in Ade-
laide and educated at the Convent,
of Mercy there, makes a scientific
study of elephants. In upholding her!
views that elephants have brains as (
well as brawn she told an interest-,
ing story. „ ,
“On one occasion an elephant who;
was always chained and padlocked
extracted the key with his trunk
from the keeper’s pocket and used it
to free himself, afterwards standing (
on the key to conceal it,” she said.
“Another elephant systematically
gnawed away huge blocks of wood
in order to gain his freedom. He
finally escaped, but after roaming
for a short distance he returned, ap-
parently quite happy, to captivity.”
Miss Wirth, who nas also worked
with bears and lions, is not afraid
in the least of wild animals. “So
long as you keep your nerve and
show them you have no fear they
will respect you,” she emphasised.
“But once fall in their presence -Or
let them knock you down, and you
will need the help of your friends.”
I OTED CIRCUS
DIES
Joe Morris, one of Australia’s most
notable circus acrobats and dummy
clowns, died at Elsmore Hospital, Wa-
verley, last night, aged 66. He had
been in failing health for some time.
A widow and daughter survive him.
Morris was for many years the lead-
ing feature acrobat-clown with the
Fitzgerald, Wirth, Perry and Eroni
Brothers’ circuses. He also appeared
in pantomime, vaudeville, revue and
drama under the late Harry Rickards
and the Fullers. He was in partner-
ship in a vaudeville act known as
Morris and Wilson.
So passes one of the real old-timers,
a kindly and simple soul, beloved by
all who knew him in his triumphs
of sawdust and spangles.
AMBITIOUS
A Yorkshireman went to buy a horse
that would win the Grand National. A
livery stable he visited showed him one
that’was guaranteed to jump anything.
“But will it win t’National?” asked
the Yorkshireman.
“It’ll win anything,” was the un-
blushing reply.
“All reet. Awll take it,” said the
Yorkshireman, “but how’ll I tell when
it’s going to joomp?”
“Oh,” said the stableman, “that’s
easy. When it’s going to refuse a jump
it puts its ears back. When it’s going
to jump it pricks them up.”
The Yorkshireman mounted and rode
off down- the street. They came to a
viaduct over which a train was passing.
The startled animal stopped and pricked
up its ears. , .
“Whoa, there,” said the astonished
Yorkshireman. “Not on tha life. Th&
goes under that one.”

right through to Kawakawa, neai the
top of North Island. After that it
visited Sydney. broken IT ill, and Ade-
laide before coming to Pirie.
According to Mr. a
circus is sitil'l a good business -pro-
position. 'Tt 19 always a draw, be*
said. “The children want to see it,
;md they bring the adults. Of bourse,
we have had keener competition with
the advent of talking pictures, and 1
the public demands! still more for its
money. We are constantly getting
new acts.”
Not Good Sailors
So many miles have the animals
travelled that they are now accus-
tom ed to even squally weather at sea.
Of the nine elephants: there are two,
however —(Molly and Eily who aic
subjeot to the human ailment of sea-
sickness. 'The. remainder are not
troubled by rough seas and are almost
unperturbed when their great backs
are lashed with spray.
The huge animal performers had to
be given a change of diet while they
were in Java, as oaten hay was not
obtainable locally. The latter wasi
supplemented daily with the foliage,
of 60 banana palms, 80 bundles ofl
grass, and rice stalks.
When the circus arrived at Soura-
bayta, its first port of call, it was*
greeted by a huge crowd of curious
natives, must of 'whom had probably
not :seen an elephant before. There
was pandemonium when- the animals'
went for a stroll to relieve' their stiff
limbs. Natives who bad been un-
loading flour from a nearby vessel
were terror-stricken when they saw
the big creatures at large, and they
scattered in all directions.
Natives were given' five cents each
to lead the horses to the site arranged
for the show. They had no know-
ledge of how to handle the animals.
The latter wanted a gallop after the
voyage, and When they increased
their speed the natives, instead of
holding them back, began to run with
them. The result can be imagined,
and horses had to be retrieved from
far and near.
“Dinner is Served”
The menu for the four-footed
members of the show makes, interest-
ing reading. Each elephant dines* on
a hundredweight and a half of oaten
liay. daily, with a warm bran mash
every few days. There are more than
id horses, which eat half a ton of
chaff a day between them. Bananas,,
apples, and other lruit, lettuces, and
carrots are* purchased for the mon-
keys, which drink milk in which eggs
have been beaten.
The lions, tigers, and other big cats
dine on Ihe best beef —about 9b lb. a
day. 'The sole diet, of the. bears is
bread soakedf in milk, with fruit about
every 'second day. Each of tth'e|
two bears eats* two double loaves;
daily. The dogs consume 2*5 lb. of
meal. The performing geese must
not be forgotten. They thrive on
bran, pollard, and greens. Then
there are the seals, which take from
Ob to 80 lb. of cleaned fish.
Every Sunday the elephants are
lined up for a dose of medicine, con-,
si sting of a mixture of salt and sul-
phur-. The 'cat family is dosed with,
olive oil in meat and the dogs with
castor oil. >
When travelling extra 'supplies)
have to be -arried, the animals' being
constantly w to keep them out of]
mischief, as i are unable to exer-*
rise. Incidentally, only small fish are)
fed to the seals', which swallow their,
food whole. I
Staff Answers Rollcall
There are about GO workmen eon-;
nee ted. with* the circus, three compe-
tent cooks wring employed to prepare
their meats. A rollcall bakes place
every evening.
When a new site is reached the)
tents' cannot be immediately erected..
Various measurements have to be)
taken, the arrangement of entrances
and exits decided upon, and dressing
room's placed so that they will ensure'
t f minimum time for changing between
acts. The show is usually over
shortly before 11 ip.m., and .soon after
midnight everything has been stowed
away onboard the train and the whole
company is ready to move on again.
Wiirith’S' Circus claims to have the
largest travelling zoo in the world, to;
be the only one which shows all the
year round, and the only one to work'
its elephants out of the actual ring.
Big Top
pHILLIP WIRTH JR. says that
tastes in circus acts change as
rapidly as the fashions. At one time
the main attraction of a circus in
addition to its clowns and trapeze
artists was an animal act and fabu-
lous sums used to be paid for these
turns. Foreign trainers who had
broken the animals in had to be
employed and they made it as dif-
ficult as possible sometimes for an-
other man to take the act over.
* * *
ON one occasion in New Zealand
his father saved the new trainer’s
life when a Bengal tiger attacked
him Mr. Wirth rushed into the cage
with a blazing torch and singed the
animal’s whiskers. This fact was re-
called because the other night, Pasha,
one of the Bengal tigers now with
the show, was so occupied in look-
ing for a chance to leap at his
trainer that he missed his leap and
ran under a blazing hoop that is
part of the act and ran round the
cage with his whiskers singeing and
his face fur well alight for a minute
or two.
* % *
tNTEREST in animal acts has been
revived, but Australians still like
graceful equestrian acts and, he add-
ed with a smile, they still like to
see pretty girls in anything next to
nothing. Slack wire and tight rope
walkers are hard to find nowadays,
and tumblers and balancers are get-
ting scarce. Counting artists and
train crew, there are over _ 100 on
the big circus train. There is a big
mess kitchen for the staff and the
! Wirth family carry their own house-
I maid and cook in their special com-
partment, complete with kitchen.
CIRCUS PERFORMERS
MARRIED TODAY
Two of Wirth’s Circus performers, •
Laurance Staig, the man who turns a ,
somersault on a motor cycle while it j
swings in mid-air, and Miss Rae Brady,
a trapeze artist in the same act, were
married this afternoon.
The best man was another performer in I
the act. .
All the circus performers were invit-
ed to the ceremony, which was celebrat-
ed at St. Judith’s Church, Carlton.
After the circus performance tonight
the newly married couple will attend a
reception at Victoria Hall, Russell Street.

A Freak Wedding Any Way You Look At It
“With this ring I thee wed,” says Ripley’s armless wonder as
with his toes he places the ring on his bride’s little finger. It was a
big day for freaks. A midget was ring bearer, a mechanical man was
best man, and a sword swallow r er was maid of honor. The bride
herself is her husband’s target when, on the vaudeville stage, he hurls
knives with his feet.

lan Morton Westbrook, a young Australian, professionally known as “Hank
Morton—the Arizonan” (“the reincarnation of Houdini”), set out to make
money from his ability as an escapologist. PIX shows the escape act, in
which he is strapped in regulation prison jacket, in Chinese “torture straps,
hauled head-down 30ft. up a tree. He wriggles free, climbs down a rope lad-
der, and escapes. He has toured with Wirth’s Circus and on Hoyt s Theatres
circuit, and plans to ride round Australia with a Mexican, a two-man show.

Hank’s grandfather roughed it in Arizona for years, before coming to Australia.

Fakirs ARE Fakers
Travelers to India find a
curious pleasure in watching
the torture tricks performed
with groans and cries for
backsheesh (money) by fakirs
(wonder workers).
No magic is needed for
many of their grisly frauds,
merely a bit of knowledge and
a willingness to undergo dis-
comfort rather than work.
Not all of the fakirs are
frauds, however. Some un-
questionably have super-nor-
mal abilities.
Nightmare on Daybed
To train for his harsh career, this old man rubs his
body daily with oils, herbs and drugs that numb feeling.
He has heavy callouses on his thighs and feet, a con-
dition he developed slowly while learning his trade.
(It can be taught in a month.)
His weight is spread over many nails, so that no nail
point gets enough pressure to puncture his skin.
Fakirs sometimes have fevers caused by infections
that develop in nail scratches.
They hide while sick, because it is bad for business to
let the public know that a fakir can be scratched.
Tiny Beggar
This youthful fakir
studies his “prayer,” the
hocus-pocus he will mum-
ble to astound watchers
when he is a graduate
holy “man.”
His bed of nails has
wheels, and looks like a
child’s coaster wagon.

Unusual Families
A Complete Merger of Two Families was effected by
this group in Portland, Maine. The boys are all sons
of Napoleon Beaule, second from left in front, and the
girls are daughters of his wife, next to him, formerly
Mrs. Anna Rancourt. Mr. Beaule married her after
each of his sons had wed one of her daughters. The
arrows show which girl is married to which man.
Gabrielle (left) and Mary Ann are the girls in front.
In the back row, left to right: Elizabeth, Arthur, Lud-
ger, Godfrey, David, Bertha.
Anything for an Apple. Perhaps a smart photographer helped the
goat to the donkey’s back, but it’s all right, because both animals
like apples. The picture was taken in New Zealand.
Twenty-Four Children in 27 Years is the record of
Mrs. Virginia Heil, 41 (second from left in front).
Mrs. Heil is holding Patricia Joan, her youngest child,
born March 11, 1938, and around her are 10 of the
others, ranging in age from 13 months to 19 years.
Five other living Heil children were not at home for
the picture. Eight others died at birth. Mrs. Heil’s
husband, Harry, is a laborer.

6 Ready for Visitors. The biggest gorilla is displayed in his natural
surroundings. His skin has been attached to the figure with a slow
drying compound which permits the restorer to mold the animal’s fea-

killed at the same time, are preserved with the big gorilla.
It Looks Worse Than It Is
The Hippopotamus has a mouth as big and clumsy as his name, but his throat is so small
that he could choke on a tennis ball ... His stomach is a better match for his huge mouth.
In his 10ft. of stomach he can stow a dozen bundles of carrots, half a dozen cabbages, a peck
of apples, 15 loaves of bread and 150lb. of hay ... In spite of his great size, the hippopota-
mus is mild-mannered and steady in his habits; in fact he is among the most respectable of
jungle inhabitants. Fossil remains show that the hippopotamus once ranged over Europe and
India. The species is now making its last stand against the threat of extinction in Africa.
These Midgets Toured New England m this tiny
coach, pulled by these midget Shetland ponies, says
Mai James Doyle, the driver. Doyle, whose home is in
New York is a tamliar Broadway figure. The woman
in the picture is the widow of the famous Tom Thumb,
who died in 1883, six years before this picture was
made in Bar Harbor, Me. Beside her is her second
husband, Count Magri. The fourth figure is his
brother, Baron Magri. Doyle, then 20, tells of driving:
this equipage 44 miles one night between “stands. "


A Young Lady
Goes Into Her Dance
It's Lucky Her Partners’ Aim Is Good because this adagio dance took place
on a roof top, giving a final fillip of danger to what is always a risky per-
formance. The girl’s safety rests not only on the catcher, but on the strength,
timing and aim of the others, as well as her own ability to turn in the
air and prepare herself to be caught. Here she is partly turned over as
she flies gracefully through the air.
On January 19, 1938, Lois became a bride for the

named. The answer is a difficult one, as the
peculiar name is not definitely authenticated. Hov
stories, one of which is probably true. The firs i - ' L ' V' v

This unique Band is entirely composed of working men,’ mostly
weavers and mill hands, and it seems almost incredible that they
should reach the topmost rung of the ladder under such circum-
stances. Nevertheless, when one hears them play, whether it be a
Beethoven or Wagner selection, a Strauss waltz such as the “Blue
Danube,” or one of the old hymn tunes like “Lead, Kindly Light,” it can
hardly be realised that any Brass Band could produce such glorious
music. It is indeed an absolute revelation in Band muaic, and the
visit of this historic organisation is bound to prove of incalculable
benefit to the Bands in this country. One critic said, “The Besses
ha\ e taught us a new musical language. One could hardly imagine
that a Brass Band would produce such great and wonderful results.”
One or two of the chief incidents in the recent career of the
Besses will convey an idea of the effect their playing produces upon
the public. Two years ago a short tour was made in France at the
time die Entente Cordiale movement was in embryo. The Besses
were received and welcomed to France by President Loubet, and the
fiiat petformance in the lulleries was a memorable affair. It was
estimated about 100,000 people were present, and after,- the Band
played 'The Marseillaise,” followed by “God Save tLL Knur.” the

VALESKA SURATT.
LIMBERING UP BEFORE THE SHOW.
THE CLEVER DANCING ACT, KNOWN AS THE EIGHT PALACE GIRLS, TAKING THE KINKS OUT OF THEIR LEGS—WHEN THEY
GET ON THEIR STAGE TOGS YOU WOULD HARDLY RECOGNIZE THEM.


THE FAMOUS AUSTRALIAN SILVER BAND
NOW TOURING NEW ZEALAND.
MR. ALBERT H. BAILE,
The Eminent Conductor.
MR. VERNON J. BEACROFT,
Manager.
MR. H. GLADSTONE HILL,
Director of Publicity.
The band has just completed a
most successful Auckland and Wai-
kato season. Of the first concert in
Auckland the “HERALD says,
alia:
“This splendid body of instrumental- •
ists proved worthy successors to that
other famous combination, the New-
castle Steel Works Band, which so
delighted audiences on a previous
visit. Part of the original band has
been retained, but skilled musicians
have been secured from various towns
in Australia, with the result that the
present array of performers is even
stronger musically than the previous
combination. The cornet department,
in particular, is more brilliant, while
such is the alertness displayed by
each member that the most subtle
effects are secured in the ensembles.
Mr. Albert H. Baile, the famous con-
ductor, controls the band as before,
and his magnetic personality domin-
ates the player to a marked degree.
Every gesture with the baton con-
veys some meaning to the instru-
mentalists, who are finely equipped
both as regards tone and technique.”
Writing of the same programme,
the “STAR” remarks:
“One of the most noticeable fea-
tures of the band is its versatility,
grand opera, church' music, and jazz
(with appropriate gestures) being all
rendered with equal success and
equal fitness. When you hear a baud
revelling in the eccentric ‘Maggie!
Yes, Ma!’ one of the jazziest of
jazzes, you would hardly expect it to
move you in ‘Abide With Me’ or
‘Nearer My God to Thee,’ but nothing
could be finer than the reverential
way in which those grand old tunes
were played last night. The band
got a really majestic organ tone,
which, with one’s eyes closed, gave
a perfect illusion of being in church.
Then again, in grand opera, the
band showed a musicianly grasp of
the work. The dramatic passages
and exacting recitatives, which mean
so much to operatic music, sound
common place in the hands of com-
mon place bands, but the Australian
Silver Band does its work like an
orchestra.”
The Band will visit Taumarunui,
December 10; Taihape, December 11;
Marton, December 15; Feilding, De-
cember 16; Dannevirke, December 18
and 19; Blenheim, December 21; Nel-
son, December 22 and 23; Westport,
December 24; Greymouth, December
26; Christchurch, December 28 to
January 2; Invercargill, January 13,
14 and 15; Dunedin, January 18 to 23.
Afterwards the Band will visit Aus-
tralia, South Africa, England, '.S.A.,
and Canada.

IF WOMEN WEAR THE PANTS... THEN MEN CAN WEAR THE SKIRTS!
CHARGE AGAINST MAN WHO DRESSED AS WOMAN
PERCIVAL D. BAYNES, as he ap-
peared in court.
Entitled To, Says Magistrate
THESE modern days! Will there be no end to progress?
What with Oxford bags and beach pyjamas and riding
breeches, and young fellows who powder their chins
and don the dainty corset, you’ve got to watch out
lest you mistake someone’s brother for your sister.
That’s what these modern days are doing!
£jOW, take Percival Douglas
Baynes, of Rothesay Avenue,
Elwood, for instance. One day,
you might have seen Percy in
the street looking quite dapper
and business-like in his manly
tweeds— yet another day you
might have spied Perce appear-
ing very chic and feminine in
the latest Bourke Street fashion
for ladies. For Perce had a
weakness for donning the dain-
ties.
BUT, why shouldn’t us menfolk wear
the blouses and the silky things?
Why, indeed? Aren’t the ladies wear-
ing our pants? Aren’t they togging up
in the tweeds and the broadcloth? Of
course they are! Even Police Magis-
trate Bond has seen ’em.
“I’ve seen ladies walking down the
street in beach pyjamas, and riding
breeches, and I don’t see that it should
be any more offensive for a man to
dress as a woman than it is for a wo-
man to dress as a man,” he said in
the City Court this week.
So there you are, fellers —go to it!
The learned Magistrate, when he
made this momentous judicial
statement, was referring to the
aforementioned Percival Douglas
Baynes, who deals in property, and
has (or did have) what he called
“a foolish weakness for dressing
up.”
Detective James Theodore Cook
spotted him in Collins Street the other
evening, and decided to take the place
of Percy’s shadow. And away went Mr.
Baynes, all unaware of the attention
which had fallen upon him, to the
pictures. And, there, too, went the
detective.
Sitting almost beside him through-
out the performance, he kept one
eye on Perce, and, when the show
was over they caught a tram to
Elwood. Percival was nearly home
when Cook grabbed him.
“Why are you masquerading as a
woman?” he demanded
“I don’t know, I must have a kink,”
replied Percival.
“His face was powdered,” Cook told
the City Court, “his lips were reddened,
THE CITY COURT.
he had a lady’s hat on, and he carried
a handbag and lady’s umbrella. The
handbag contained a powder puff,
lipstick, a mirror and other feminine
articles **
So Perce, being quite s<pber, and, in
the opinion of the detective, guilty of
offensive behavior, was locked up.
He was fully clothed in feminine at-
tire, Cook added.
That closed the police case, and
Baynes, with the skill of a trained law-
yer, set about tearing it to pieces.
“During the time you had me
under observation, did I do any-
thing except wear the clothes?”
asked the educated man in the
dock.
“No,” replied the detective.
“I didn’t speak to anyone?”
“No.”
“I went straight home after the pic-
tures?”
“Yes.”
All that remained was the explana-
tion.
Baynes said he did not know why
he did it. There had been no rea-
son for it. He just had the urge,
and had succumbed to a foolish weak-
ness. The clothes were bought.
He was born in England 35 years
ago, and had been in Australia for
about eight of them.
Sergeant De La Rue: Have you
ever been in a mental home?
Baynes: No.
Are you wearing corsets? —Sort of
ones.
Mr. Bond: You had better not
probe too deeply into that, sergeant.
Mr. Bond did not think ill of Per-
cival. Indeed, he was more decent
than some women he had seen in
male attire, the P.M. said, and a man
was as much entitled to dress as a
woman as a woman was to do vice
versa.
After the case had been dismissed,
Baynes hurried to the watchhouse
and changed. He packed his silk
stockings, and his brown, fur-trimmed
coat into a case, along with his blouse
and what have you, and was gone.

changing,

WIRTH’S CIRCUS
AH EXCELLENT SHOW
The glitter and glamour of the saw-
dust ring has an irresistible lure for
young and old alike, and to New Zea-
landers the word circus is synonymous
with Wirth’s, and that also is a guar-
antee of the best in the way of variety
entertainment. It is two years since
Wirth’s Circus last pitched its tents in
Dunedin, and the opening performance
of the present season on the Caledonian
Ground last night indicated that
Wirth’s is as rich as ever in the bright-
ness, originality, and quality ol its
acts, and a large audience enjoyed
every minute of a show which went
with a sw’ing from start to finish.
Many former favourites are back with
Wirth’s, but there are new faces and
new and original acts. Wirth s lias
always been noted for the quality of
its animal acts, but it is doubtful if
a higher standard has been reached
than is the case this year. They are
all well presented, and something new
in this class of entertainment is pro-
vided by Frohn’s sea lions, whose per-
formance is one of the brightest parts
of the programme. “ Carbine,”
claimed to be the largest trained sea
lion in the world, had already had the
“ freedom of the city ” conferred upon
him, and he does not have to be in the
ring long to demonstrate that he is a
“ star ” in his own right. His feats
of balance are amazing, and while he
joins his smaller confreres in some
lively work with a beach ball and an
ordinary rubber ball, which they bal-
ance on the end of their noses, he later
performs the much more difficult feat
of climbing a ladder with a lamp
perched on his nose and then waddling
down the other side without in any
way disturbing it. Yet another indica-
tion of his remarkable sense of equili-
brium is the way he balances on b
* nose a stick with a ball on the end
it. It is feeding time for the sea lions,
and the speed with which they make a
meal of fish is as surprising as it is
amusing.
Performing tigers may not be rarities
altogether, but they are oddities, and
it is not often that such well-trained
animals are seen as those who were
put through a number of evolutions by
Captain Flyger. The usnal posing and
balancing feats were followed by hurd-
ling and the ever-popular and spectacu-
lar leap through the lighted hoop. Cap-
tain Flyger, who is a New Zealander,
handles his tigers with the nonchalance
that the average person would a cat,
and this despite the fact that during
a performance in Melbourne some time
ago he was attacked by one of them
and rather badly injured. Mr Harry
Mooney puts a troup of large-sized ele-
phants through many intricate move-
ments, which they perform with mili-
tarv-like precision, and the introduc-
tion of several bright novelties makes
this an enjoyable and instructive act.
The huge beasts display almost human
intelligence in following the commands
of their skilful trainer, and capping off
a fine turn Mr Mooney later presents
two midget elephants in a game of
skittles. There are other worth-while
attractions among the animal acts, es-
pecially the equestrian turns. These
are excellent, one of the best being the
act by Miss Nellie Connelly and Mr
Philip Wirth, jun. They make a very
difficult turn look easy, and that only
high-class performers can do. Miss
Gladys Wirth rides Duke in a series of
skipping, waltzing, and dancing turns,
and she displays the same fine horse-
manship that seems to be inherent with
all the Wirths. Fredga Zilamham also
presents a good equestrian act. Dannv
IVAlma and his performing geese and
dogs provide bright numbers, the acro-
batic fox terriers being very well
trained. One of the most amusing acts
on the programme is that in which the
monkeys race around the ring on the
ponies, this being presented bv Mr
Philip Wirth, jun.
Wirth’s is fortunate in being able to
call upon so many talented acrobats,
for this is always a popular side of a
circus programme. The Seven Hiltons
m a thrilling footballers’ springboard
act combiue acrobatic skill with ex-
treme daring, little Tich being the par-
ticular star in this number, his triple
somersault from a springboard into a
chair being a masterpiece of timing.
The whole of the work of this athletic
troupe is of a very high order, while
the balancing, tumbling, flying novel-
ties, skipping in mid-air, and such-like
of the Seven Nelsons are also outstand-
ing. The Seven De Paul girls engage
m whirlwind tumbling, lightning-like
pyramids, and contortion acts, and
theirs is one of the most colourful turns
on the programme. Miss El Star is a
contortionist of great ability, her *nost
pleasing performance being character-
ised by grace and perfect balance. The
ladder act by the Two Tramps is a
clever gymnastic turn, and no circus
would be complete, of course, without
its clowns. Wirth’s is verv well served
m this respect, for the clever fooling
and ‘gags” of the clowns kept the
audience 111 happy mood between the
acts.
The performance will be repeated to-
nigiit and during the week, and each
afternoon from 4 to 5 the zoo will be
open. A feature is “ Lady Bettv,”
said to be the only gorilla in captivitv
in the world. She is U years old
stands sft 3in, and weighs *B* stone!
and is reputed to be almost human.

A Caesar In Captivity
Who Refuses Every Drink
TO JUDGE FROM ITS EXPRESSION the first sacred baboon of Burma to
come to Australia is bored with the experience. The animal, valued at
£200, is a newcomer to Wirth's Circus.
He doesn't drink even water;
he doesn't eat citrus fruit; he has
a coat which would tempt even
jthe most virtuous furrier; he is
| the only one of his kind in Australia;
|he has a strange bark —yet he is almost
| human.
His name is Caesar and he is a Bur-
mese sacred baboon, valued at £2OO,
] who has just arrived from the tropics,
j Even in Burma these baboons-— called
sacred because of a ham of fur around
■ their heads —are exceedingly rare and
hard to capture.
Caesar was m> exception, but now he
has settled down to the humdrum life of
the circus and seemed comparatively
peaceful in his cage at Wirth’s Olympia
today.
Caesar is only four feet high when
he stands upright, but he is still young.
When fully grown, he will be nearly as
big as a man —and a formidable adver-
sary. Even now he can bend iron bars
and has four huge fangs.
All sorts of fluids have been placed
in Caesar’s cage, but he has not touched
any. He eats all vegetables.
His feeding is still experimental, for
little is known of his habits and na-
tural food, pending the arrival of in-
-1 structions from Burma.

letters, too, and between it was the frequent
mention of “Army Club ” that led to the

SYNOPSIS—
%
Founded on the classic Italian comedy oj Goldoni
\t Carnival time ladies of a small town near Venice resolve to amuse themselves
at the expense of their friends. To test her sweetheart, the Count Rinaldo, whom
she sees sitting at the Cafe opposite her house, the beautiful Constanza sends her
maid Mariuccia to him with a letter informing him that a lady who wears a pink bow
on her shoulder loves him. In addition to wearing one herself, she gives similar bows
to her young friends, Felicita, Dorotea, and Pasquina, and another to her aunt, the
old Marquise Silvestra. One after another the young ladies appear before Rinaldo,
and each time he thinks it is his beloved, but they vanish and leave him despairing.
Finally, however, the old Marquise accepts a glass of wine with him. At the moment
of declaring his love Rinaldo perceives that his companion is far from young, and
would gladly escape, but the old lady is not to be denied and drags him off to the
Carnival, whither all the young people have gone.
In the absence of her mistress, little Mariuccia arranges a supper for Leonardo,
her lover, who quickly arrives, followed by Battista, and the supper is for three.
During their merriment they are joined by the old Marquis di Luca, who also has a
weakness for Mariuccia. The feast is followed by several dances. First Mariuccia
and Battista each give a solo; then Leonardo intervenes, and there ensues an

essemble which is interrupted by the appearance of Felicitaand Dorotea. Seeing his
wife, Leonardo takes flight. The ladies tell Battista that his sweetheart Pasquina is
flirting with the gallant Captin Faloppa. Their story is confirmed by the guilty pair
themselves who pass by from the Carnival. Mad with jealousy Battista runs after
his rival, knocking over the old Marquis, who has fallen asleep after his supper.
All is quiet for a moment and the town clock strikes four.
t
The gentle Constanza is troubled at the ease with which her Aunt has enticed
Rinaldo away. Whilst she is deploring her loneliness the Marquise returns in triumph,
escorted by Rinaldo and Faloppa. Meanwhile Leonardo and Battista have donned
feminine attire in order to trick the former's wife and the latter's sweetheart. They
all determine to fool the old Marquis and Marquise. First the two pretended young
ladies delight the old nobleman by inviting him to join them at the Cafe. Meanwhile
the genuine ladies have prevailed upon Niccolo, the Cafe waiter, to disguise himself
as a Prince and offer his hand to the Marquise. To the music of the celebrated
“ Cat’s Fugue,’ they prepare for the old lady's return. On her appearance Niccolo
declares his passion, and the Marquise, delighted, announces her marriage with the
supposed Prince. Then Mariuccia removes the waiter’s mask, the supposed young
ladies reveal themselves as Leonardo and Battista, old age is discomfited and
triumphant youth is convulsed with merriment.

to an entirely new and novel test of strength. It la the only a«t of its kind In the world and is presented exactly as advertised. The act Is the one big attraction of the season aai draws
world-wide attention. It is a lifting act, not in the ordinary sense of the word where weights are raised and lowered with the arms, but the wonder of this act is that all the lifting is
done from %-inch slits cut through the captain’s breasts through which two Iren tubes, 1% inch long and % inch in diameter, are inserted. With these apparently frail strips of flesh
the captain lifts iron dambbells of from 50 to 260 pounds weight and bends an iron rod 8 feet long and % inch in diameter, requiring a power of 350 pounds. He finishes the act with a
wonderful example of endurance by suspending himself from a rope tied to the wounds in his breast and attached to the ceiling, and then permits a heavy man to hang to his feet for
from one to two minutes. (The act lasts from ten to fifteen minutes, and during his performance the captain will allow anyone to examine himself and his paraphernal*'a.) The
captain appears in a military uniform, or in tights, with a red silk shirt having a white open breast, and not with the upper part of his body unclothed as shown in the cuts. In 1918 he
played a long term in Montreal, Can., and New York vaudeville. Then two months with Publllones’ Circus in Cuba, during which Mr. Pubillones personally assisted the captain with
the act. The captain was interviewed by a Cuban reporter who said it was the first act of its kind in Cuba. Many prominent people of Cuba aßd the West Indies offered testimonials to
the same effect. The captain was a three months’ feature attraction in Forest Park (Chicago). January 15, feature attraction at Ostrich Farm, Florida. Also during Gasparllla Cele-
bration in Tampa, Fla. At the present time the captain is presenting moving pictures, having in his possession 2,000 feet of feature Mexican war pictures and 1,000 feet of new European
war pictures never before presented in this country. He has an excellent lobby display of these pictures. Captain Mach was born in Bohemia and was a-n officer in the Austrian army.
He speaks several European languages. The captain has a very interesting lecture in the European and also the English language. For many years he has been a good patron and a
constant reader of The Billboard as well as European theatrical papers. He sendfe beet wishes for a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to all his friends and readers of The Billboard.

WELL DONE
You can rave about your beauties,
Your fatties and your cuties.
Every maiden has a flashing, dashing smile;
But remember, dear old chappie,
It's good cheer that makes us happy ,
It's the laughs that make dreary life worth
while.
So give credit to the fellow
Who can make existence mellow,
Who can turn the clouds to sunshine every time;
And when hearts are cheered by laughter
And content that follows after,
The ridiculous may equal the sublime.

it takes part.” Mr. Fritz Hart, Director of the Albert Street Conseryatonum, and Pro-
fessor W. A. Laver, of the University Conservatorium, have spoken in similar terms of

Diminutive Immigrant Finds
Friend On Arrival Here
HAVING FOUND A FRIEND in Mr. Phillip Wirth, of
Wirths’ Circus, this little agile Gibbon monkey, which
arrived by the Nieuw Holland yesterday, decided to stick
to him. It was a fortunate choice, because the little
creature is destined to be trained to amuse circus crowds.
“The Dream of a Moving Man” is the quaint title of the act which T[?]
Briants will present to Tivoli audiences next month. Truly ludicrous
the act , as one can judge from the above photograph, is the personifica-
tion of comedy. These clever performers fall with such astounding a[?]
resounding whacks that most people would be ready for an ambulan[?]
after [?] imnacts with non-yielding boards.

Hoop Of Fire Act Takes Startling Turn
At Newcastle Performance
MAN'S ARMS AND HANDS CLAWED
gYDNEY, Sunday.—During the lion act at Perry Bros.’ Circus last
night at Newcastle, Captain Monsalo, 52, the lion trainer, was
mauled by a lion. His arms and hands were badly cut and his coat
was torn to ribbons.
JJALF way through the act, the lion was about to leap through the
hoop of fire but, instead, attacked the trainer, knocking him to
the floor of the cage and clawing at him fiercely.
audience scattered wildly as the man fought for his life, his
only weapon being a small fork.
AT ONSALO broke free for a secon
XTX and then the lioness, which, up t
this stage had remained in a corne
of the cage, made a spring at him.
Lashing out with the fork and
yelling at the top of his voice, he
cowed the lioness, which slunk
away, followed by the lion.
The doors were opened for him an
Monsalo was assisted to hospital.
Five years ago, during a performanq
in Queensland, Monsalo was attacke
by the same lion and his neck wa
badly gashed. He has been trainin
lions for 40 years and has been at
tacked eight times.
STOCK TRAIN DERAILED.
Elephant Renders Assistance.
WAGIN, Aug. 23. —The engine of an im-
portant stock train from Katanning en
route to sales at Midland Junction was
derailed in the Wagin railway yards about
5 p.m. yesterday during shunting opera-
tions. A relief engine was immediately
requisitioned from Narrogin to take the
stock to its destination. The relief train
left Wagin about two hours behind the
scheduled time, but arrived at Midland
Junctioa in time for the sales, as a fast
engine was utilised. No damage resulted
;o the live stock.
A special break-down train was sent
rom Narrogin to Wagin last night, and
lie origiual engine of the stock train was
•e-railed about 9 o’clock. It was then
iauled to Narrogin.
The cause of the derailment is not known*
aor the extent of the damage to the en-
gine.
As Wirth’s circus was showing here last
night, the services of Alice, the elephhnt;
were requisitioned to remove the trucks
from the derailed engine. There was no
engine under steam in the Wagin railway
yards, and the elephant’s timely help was
fully appreciated. A crowd of sightseers was
interested and amazed in watching the
work of the elephant, which appeared to
remove the trucks without effort and revel
in the task.
Other valuable assistance was rendered
by the electrical staff of the Wagin Munici-
pal Council, its members erecting a lead
from the street lighting poles to the scene
of the derailment, Jhus enabling the break-
down gang to work at ease during the
evening.
TRAINER ATTACKED
BY HIS LIONS
BITTEN ON RIGHT ARM
EXCITEMENT AT CIRCUS
SYDNEY, Sunday. “Captain Mon-
eala,” animal trainer, who in private life
is John Stephens, aged 52 years, was at-
tacked by a lion and a lioness during his
act at a performance at Newcastle last
evening of Perry Bros.’ circus. The lion
knocked Stephens to the ground, and bit
him on the right arm before it was driven
back with iron bars wielded by two mem-
bers of the circus staff. The lioness also j
leaped at the trainer, but failed to reach 1
him, and she was forced back before she
could repeat the attempt.
wnen he regained his feet Stephens
wanteu to continue the act, but he was
persuaded to go to the Newcastle Hospital,
where 16 stitches were inserted in his right
arm and hand. The lions were in an
obstinate mood throughout the act. It
took much coaxing to "ersuade the lion
to leave his stand, and as soon as he did
so he darted at the trainer. Members of
the audience screamed, and many women
and children left the tent immediately.
When the trapdoor to their box was
opened, the customary sign that their per-
formance was over, both animals trotted
meekly through the door.
GALLIPOLI HERO PASSEI.
The remains of the late Sapper
Frank Healey, of the A.1.F., who was
a cot case for 13 years, as a result
of having been shot through the
spine at the Gallipoli landing, were
cremated at Rookwood (Sydney)
cemetery. Owing to paralysis, which
developed from the injury to the
spine, Sapper Healey had never been
able to leave an air-inflated mat-
tress. Since his return to Sydney in
1915, he saw the city on two occa-
sions, each time from an ambulance.
A motor car, specially built to ac-
commodate his wheeled bed, was de-
livered at his home at Lane Cove a
fortnight ago, but he had not been
able to use it, as th& heart trouble,
which culminated in his death, had
been in acute form for two months.
Diggers pay tribute to the devoted
attention given by Mrs. Healey, the
widow, during the long years of her
husband’s illness. She nursed him
night and day. A soldier brother of
Sapper Healey was killed in France.
LEOPARD CLAWS TRAINER’S HAND
WHEN CAGE IS BEING CLEANED
KINDNESS ILL
REWARDED
Bad Temper After
Long Voyage
AIR. EMIL PAYER, animal trainer
attached to Wirth’s Circus, had 1
his hand badly mauled by a leopard
v/hich arrived on Thursday from Java.
The animal is one of three placed in *
quarantine with Wirth’s in Melbourne.
“It all happened through being
kind to dumb animals,” said Mr.
Payer last night, as he displayed
four swollen fingers, protruding
from bandages.
After their sea voyage the leopards
were handed over to the care of Mr.
Payer with wet, uncomfortable cages,
and he set about giving them clean
straw beds. He was pushing a bundle
of straw into a cage when the animal
inside slashed at him, buried its claws
deeply in the back of his hand, and
tore the tendons.
-Mr. Payer in early life trained ani-
als for Fitzgerald’s, Wirth’s, Ander-
m’s, and Armstrong’s circuses, and
ien worked for 25 years at his trade
an electrician.
A few months ago, following a
serious operation, he decided that
electrical engineering was too stren-
uous for him, and he returned to
his old business of taming wild
animals.
He claims to be the oldest trainer to
nter the cages of untamed animals,
iince rejoining Wirth’s he has trained
wo tigers in what is claimed to be
ecord time. He entered their cage on
he first occasion armed only with a
tick, and stayed with them for two
DEATH OF MR. G.
ANDERSON
Well-known Circus Manager
r PHE death occurred early to-day at Dal-
-1 keith private hospital of George An-
derson, who for the last 50 years, was
general manager of Wirth Bros. Ltd.
Circus.
During the last three years Mr. Ander-
son, who was 71, was resident at Wirth’s
Park, but previously he had travelled Aus-
tralia and New Zealand with the circus
organisation.
His duties were always concerned with
the managerial side of the circus, but on
very rare occasions he made an appear-
ance in the ring as master of ceremonies.
Mr. Anderson leaves a widow.
THE MODERN CIRCUS.
TO THE EDITOR OP THE “HERALD.”
Sir, —In the “Herald” of the 10th inst. I
noticed a discussion in the City Council rela-
tive to the Exhibition Building in Prince Al-
fred Park, a move to have it demolished being
defeated, and a decision arrived at to call ten-
ders for a lease of the building, subject to
certain alterations being carried out by the
lessee.
Might I be permitted to suggest that the
building would make an ideal circus and hip-
podrome, and as a performer who has spent
a lifetime in the business, my i-easons for say-
ing so are as follows: At present there are only
two theatres in Sydney for (flesh and blood)
shows, the patronage extended to them showing
clearly that the public have definitely got over
the shock that the advent of the talkies gave
them, and are demanding the personal touch
that only (in the blood) shows can give them.
In America, where practically all new forms
of entertainment originate, the circus has
commenced a new era, and has advanced from
a position of inferiority, till now it is the
premier physical display and national spec-
tacle, displaying the most lavish pageantry, and
combing the world for the best exponents of
the various circus arts, and to-day no circus
of less than three rings could draw a house in
the United States. The Ringling Bros.’ show
alone carries fifteen hundred people. In Eng-
land the same thing has happened, Bertram
Mills has revived the circus, his board of
directors include several of the nobility, the
publicity agent being no less a personage than
Lady Eleanor Smith, who wrote “Red Wag-
gon.” The Royal family invariably visit the
circus during its season at Olympia.
But, to get back to the Exhibition Build-
ing. There are at least four circuses In Aus-
tralia, which could and would play Sydney if
there was a permanent circus building, such
as the Olympia in London and the Madison
Square Garden in New York, and in most other
big American cities. The circuses that I re-
fer to are Wirths’, Ivan Bros., Perry’s, and
Sole’s. The fact that the building is an is-
land one would enable the marshalling of big
spectacular pageants to be done outside, thus
making it possible to play wild west, wild Aus-
tralia. cowboy or bushranger dramas. So,
with at least six months’ circus, and other
letting, the hippodrome should pay.
