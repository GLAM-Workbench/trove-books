I PM ST RUCTIONS
FOR THE USE OF
SANDOWS SPRING -j*
GRIP DUMB-BELLS.


Saodow’s Spring Grip
Dumb-Bells
HAVE BEEN SUPPLIED TO
H.M. KING EDWARD VII.; H.M. QUEEN ALEXANDRA;
H.R.H. THE DUKE OF CORNWALL & YORK;
H.R.H. THE DUCHESS OF CORNWALL & YORK;
H.R.H. PRINCE GEORGE OF GREECE;
H.R.H. THE DUCHESS OF AOSTA;
And to nearly all the Crowned Heads of Europe.
You should use the Spring Grip Dumb-Bell because
1. Exercise is Useless without Will Power. The Grip on the
Dumb-Bell Compels use of Will Power.
2. There is no Danger of any Strain on the Heart.
3. An Athlete can do more with these Bells than any other
KIND WHATSOEVER.
4. As One's Development Increases, Pace can be kept with it
by Adjusting the Springs.
S. They prevent Swing and Jerk getting into the Work.
GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS.
WHAT PART OF THE DAY TO EXERCISE.—I lay down no hard and
fast rule ; exercise according to leisure and inclination, but never
exercise until two hours have elapsed since the last meal.
WHAT TO WEAR WHEN EXERCISING.—Exercise stripped down to the
waist if possible, flannel trousers supported by an elastic belt (not
too tight) ; if a singlet is worn it should be of wool and cut well
away round the arms. Avoid anything tight round the wrists and
neck.
WHERE TO EXERCISE. —Exercise in a large well ventilated room with
the windows wide open, or even in the open air, if convenient,
taking care to avoid chills and draughts. If possible, stand before
a looking-glass, as it enables you to see the various muscles at
work ; it helps you to gain a greater command over each individual
muscle.


GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS — {Continued).
HOW LONG TO EXERCISE. —This is a very difficult question to answer,
and a certain amount of common-sense must be brought to bear on
the subject by the pupil. As a general rule the average person will
find five to ten minutes per day enough to start with, gradually
working up to thirty minutes per day as the pupil gets more accus-
tomed to the work. Don’t mistake laziness for weakness.
WILL POWER.—The amount of benefit derived from exercise is governed
almost entirely by the quantity of will power expended ; the
essential principle of the Sandow Spring Grip Dumb-Bell is that it
compels you to exert a considerable force of will power during
exercise.
CONCENTRATION—It is necessary to concentrate the mind entirely on
the group of muscles affected by the Exercise in operation at the
time being.
ADJUSTABILITY OF THE SANDOW SPRING CRIP DUMB-BELL.—
The resistance to the grip can be regulated to a nicety by adjusting
the number and stiength of the springs used, thus always keeping
up with the development of the pupil’s muscles.
ABNORMAL DEVELOPMENT IMPOSSIBLE —lt must be clearly under-
stood that the “ Grip ” Dumb-Bell, by being used as shown in this
booklet will strengthen all the muscles in the body in an equally
perfect manner, and that no muscles in the body are abnormally
developed at the expense of others, if the instructions on the chart
are adhered to.
OBESITY. —When obesity takes the form of a protruding stomach it is
generally caused through the abdominal muscles being unable to
cope with the extra weight thus put on them ; by practising
Exercises Nos. 14, 15, 16, these muscles are strengthened and
tightened up, thus pressing the stomach back in its original place.
DEVELOPMENT OF LEGS.—In Exercises 1 to 10 it is necessary to take
up the exact position as shown in the booklet, with the heels touch-
ing and the feet at right angles, the legs slightly bent with a 9-rnch
distance between the knees, and taking care to keep all the muscles
of the legs in tension.
Pupils arc recommended to read SANDOW’S booh on “STRENGTH, AND
HOW TO OBTAIN IT,” particularly the instructions bow to exercise, etc. Che
book is published by Itlessrs. Gale * Polden, Cfd., 2, Hmen Corner, Paternoster
Kow, or can be obtained with the Grip Dumb-Bell, or from any Bookseller,
PRICE 2/6.


THE USE OF SANDOW’S SPRING GRIP DUMB-BELLS
FOR THE CURE OF MODERN COMPLAINTS.
The regular use of Sandow’s Grip Dumb-Bells will supply every
organ and muscle of the body with that gentle exercise which is so
necessary to the human system. This exercise will, in a short time, give
permanent relief to all those complaints which are caused by any failure
of—or defect in—the muscular system, resulting from a sedentary life.
Whilst exercise is absolutely necessary to good health, every form
of exercise is not suitable. It must not put any strain on the heart or pro-
duce abnormal development, if it does, more harm than good will result.
We claim that you will obtain more benefit from exercise with Grip
Dumb-Bells than from any other exercise, and without the slightest
strain on the heart or producing abnormal development.
Exercise without will power also is useless. Grip Dumb-Bells
compel the user to concentrate his (or her) mind on the work through-
out the whole exercise, in order to keep the Dumb-Bells together. This
naturally improves concentration and the mental abilities.
Below we mention the exercises which are particularly beneficial for
various complaints.
CONSTIPATION.
Constipation is a fault of the muscular system, as that system is
responsible for the carrying away of all refuse matter. If the muscles
are faulty an obstruction is caused and trouble follows. Exercises will
quickly strengthen the abdominal muscles and consequently enable
them to do their work properly. (Exercises 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18).
INDIGESTION AND DYSPEPSIA.
The digestion of food is principally a muscular duty. If the
muscles around the stomach and other internal organs are not in
perfect condition, food cannot be properly digested, and indigestion and
dyspepsia are caused. Exercises 11, 12, 14, 15, and 19 have been
specially drawn up to strengthen these muscles and organs, and cure
these complaints.
INSOMNIA AND NERVOUS DEBILITY.
These are due to some failure of the nervous system. Now the
nervous and the muscular systems are closely connected, and by
strengthening the latter, nervous disorders may be cured. This is done
by the Grip Dumb-Bells benefiting the muscular system in a gentle but
certain way. From No. I—t1 —to —19.
SLUGGISH LIVER.
If the organs of the body are weak they will be unable to perform
their work in a satisfactory manner. A sluggish liver can be invigo-
rated and put in perfect working order by proper exercise, with the
Grip Dumb-Bells. (Exercises 15, 17, 18 and 19).
Note. — In order to get the most satisfactory results, it is better
not to restrict yourself to the exercises mentioned above, but to do a few
movements of each exercise on the Chart, paying special attention to
the one most applicable in your Special Case.

Sandow's Concentrated Embrocation.
I beg to call the attention of the general public to my latest
production in connection with the human body, viz. :
SANDOW’S CONCENTRATED EMBROCATION.
I think I may say without being egotistical that there are few
men in a position to judge the merits and appreciate the value
of an Embrocation so well as I, as owing to the nature of my
profession, I have naturally had to suffer every conceivable form
of sprain, strain, and bruise, and not only have I had to have a
good Embrocation, but one that would fit me for my work in
the shortest possible time.
Added to my personal experience over 100,000 pupils have
passed through my hands, a large proportion of whom have con-
sulted me for various ailments, such as : —rheumatism, neuralgia,
sciatica, overstrain, sprains, stiffness, writer’s cramp, chronic
inflammation of glands, bronchitis, coughs, colds, etc.
This being the case I have been continually experimenting
with the various therapeutic properties that would be suitable
for outward application in the above cases, and during my
travels that have been world wide I have collaborated with the
finest scientists and herbalists in the various countries for the
furtherance of my quest. Particularly so has this been the case
during my last visit to India and the East generally, where the
use of unguents is brought to a much higher state of perfection
than in Europe and America.
The result of all this work is embodied in the production now
known as SANDOW’S CONCENTRATED ENIBROCATION,
in the use of which I have never experienced a single failure ;
and in order that everyone may participate of the benefits
obtained from its use, I have put it on the market at a popular
price that will suit all pockets.
As I have found that a great difficulty in the use of Embroca-
tion lies in the fact that the user is ignorant of the correct
method of application, I have prepared a booklet illustrated by
photographs showing in detail the correct method of applying
my Concentrated Embrocation for the rapid cure of
rheumatism, neuralgia, sciatica, lumbago, overstrain, sprains,
stiffness, writer’s cramp, chronic inflammation of glands, bron-
chitis, coughs, colds, etc.
This Embrocation is in a highly concentrated form and being
exceptionally strong must not be used on a broken skin, and
care must be taken not to get it in the eyes.
