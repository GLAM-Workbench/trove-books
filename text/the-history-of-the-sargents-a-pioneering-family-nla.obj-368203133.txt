HISTORY OF THE
SARGENTS
A Pioneering Family of Early Days.
Thomas Sargent was born in Sussex, England,
in the year 1798, to Alice Packham, of the same
county, later migrating to New South Wales .11
the Ship “Woodbridge.” As far as his son Thomas
was aware hi s father had no sisters, the only other
member of the family being a brother, named James,
who remained in England.
Settlement in South Australia.
In 1847, Henry, James, Mary and Julia, younger
members of Thomas and Alice Sargent, with their
mother travelled overland from New South Wales
to South Australia. During the journey some of
the cattle went astray into the bush, and no doubt
became the parents of mobs of wild cattle which
afterwards roamed the Murray Valley. After set-
tling down the family formed what proved to be
life long friendship with Mrs James McDougall
and family. Henry Sargent and Lochie McDougall
spent many days together as young men with rifle
and were skilled on bringing down wild cattle in
the Murray Valley. Mrs. Sargent took up land at
Marrabel, near Saddleworth, and with her sons
carried on farming.


Henry Sargent’s Experiences.
Had Henry kept a diary it would have made most
interesting reading a s the following are but a few
varied experiences. On one occasion, in company
with William, Harding, set out to catch th e coach
at an outback country town. They had been shear-
ing or at otherwork, as the coach did not leave
until 4 a.m. Th e two young men engaged a room
for the night as the publican promised to call them
in time to catch the coach. They went to bed to
sleep the sleep of the tired, having no fear about
catching the coach. The Publican called them next
morning, but it was well after the coach had left.
They were informed that another coach would be
along that day week. The two young men seeing
through the wiles of the Publican to keep them
there a week, decided to walk the long journey.
Henry, who was the fastest walker would often
wait for Will.
On another occasion in Queensland when they
were looking for gold, Will Harding. James Sar-
gent and Aaron Harding were the party. They
were travelling the road at one place which was
exceedingly lonely and which wound its way
through the timbered hills. This country was the
haunt of a bushranger known for some reason as
"Fine Finger Dick,” whose method of treating his
victims was far from human. After robbing them
he would leave them bound to a tree, only a few
who could slip, cut or gnaw their bounds got dree,
while others starved to death. The party was warn-
ed that the bushranger was about and was advised
to take another track. However after calling a
council of war. they decided to carr'y on, rightly
judging that numbers if placed correctly would tell.
Will Harding wa s placed in command, a form of
campaign was drafted. When the bushranger was


sighted, at the word from the leader the men would
spread out among the trees on each side of the
track. As the men carried fire-arms and were ex-
pert s hots they went boldly forward having confi-
dence in themselves. Soon the bushranger wa s seen
around a bend in the road riding horse back towards
them. Word was given to spread out and soon
every man was in his place. Wdlliam Harding went
boldly forward, but as he afterwards said, with much
quaking—to meet the bushranger, who after passing
the time of day and a little talk, let the party go
unmolested.
Teamster Work In The Areas.
The Sargents did much carting, doing many a
long trip with bullock teams. On one trip to the
Blinmen they camped at the “Wild Dog Creek.’
near where Murraytown now stands, and about nine
miles S.S.E. of Mt, Remarkable. The only house
tnere at that time was a' shepherd’s hut on the bank
of the creekwhich had two pear tree growing in
front of it. Through wet weather the teamsters
were forced to camp for several days, the bullocks
meanwhile wandered several miles S.E. near to an-
other shepherd’s hut, not far from the N.W. corner
of Hd. of Appila. Henry Sargent wa s so impressed
with the country that he said that if ever he had
an opportunity he would take up land there, and
that chance came in 1875, when the land was offered
for sale.
James Sargent, Henry’s brother, tells how he
one day almost perished for want of water, but w"
able to reach a shepherd’s hut in time, although m
an exhausted condition. To James’ disgust and
disappointment the shepherd gave him only a littH
water in a pannikin and a dry crust of bread, which
he was ordered to eat before obtaining any mo"


to drink. In after years James, in telling of the
incident said that the shepherd probably saved his
life although at the time thought he was very
mean.
Wedding Bells.
One morning when Henry was out after the
bullocks he met the neighbour’s daughter. Elizabeth
McDougall, who was also looking for bullocks.
From such an introduction, sprung a friendship
engagement and a wedding. They were married at
Riverton in the Church of England by the Rev. J.
B. Fetherister, on Monday the 31st. March, 1862.
Witness —Lacklan McDougall, Mary Sargent (sister
of groom).
The young couple lived for a time on his
mother’s farm, there being no house on hi s own
property. This arrangement seemed to work well
for some years until the mother married again and
the family separated. Henry had no house to take
his wife and young family to. He made on his
own farm, near Saddleworth, an emergency shelter
with bags of wheat for walls and sheets of iron
for the roof.
Farming in Hundred of Appila.
Henry Sargent often suffered from ill-health,
in the seeding time of the year 1875, he was away
seeing a doctor so was forced td leave his seeding
unfinished. He left a man to put the crop in, but
as soon a s Mr. Sargent had gone the man left-
His oldest son George, with his mother’s help, har-
nessed four horses to the scarifier and cultivated
40 acres. A neighbour, Mr. Milne, sent his man
over to sow the grain. When that piece of crop-
ping was finished, George, with his mother’s help.


harnessed three horses to the double furrow plough
for George to go ploughing. Not knowing how to
place a thr'ee-horse swing, they had one horse
(Judy) on the short-end, giving her the work of
two horses. The neighbour went over to see how
things were and after having a good laugh put
the swings right.
On the arrival home of the father from Adel-
aide ne was surprised and pleased to find the seed-
ing finished and proud of the son who did it. That
was the last ,crop the Sargents put in on that farm.
In the year 1875, Mr. Sargent and his son George,
then aged twelve years, went north to the land that
he took up in the Hundred of Appila, to prepare a
home for his family. The shepherd’s hut previously
referred to where the bullocks had wandered from
the “Wild Dog Creek,” wa s moved to a more suit-
able place for the homestead, hy taking down the
pine slab walls, leaving the corner posts standing-
The horses and waggon were driven under the
paling roof then placed on the waggon and trans-
ported to the desired place to be erected and to be
used as a kitchen. Mr. Sargent had to wait for a
thunder storm before he could get water to make
pug to build the stone chimney.
Road Travelling in the Seventies
Leaving George wuth some working men at the
Appila West farm. Mr Sargent returned home to
bring up the family. He would not sell the old
farm for a s he sa ; d he was going to a new and
untried locally and may be glad to return to the
old farm. But that was not so, for in the sixth
year he was able to pay for the new farm. In
April 1876 the family moved per horse waggon t~


the new home. The party consisted of the father
and mother, Ellis, the eldest daughter about eleven,
John and James, who arrived at the new home on
his 7th. birthday. Henry, Elizabeth, Hannah, Peter
and Dougal, a baby six weeks old. Six children
under seven years and the mother with a whitlow
on her thumb.
On the first day of their journey they reached
Saddleworth, next day Clare. Hannah though onb
a small child, remembered the high horse yard;
there. They had a cow, for milk for the children,
and a calf and the cow were t.ed to the back of the
waggon. Elli s and John took turn about in walk-
ing behind the cow to keep her going. Once when
it was John’s turn to walk, the calf laid down and
John could not move her. He was unnoticed for
some time by the others in the waggon. Little d - d
John think tien, that one day he would be Mayor
of the town —Gladstone, which they had just passed
When it was noticed that John and the calf were
missing the cow was let loose and it soon raced
back for her calf. The father unhitched one of tho
leading horse s and rode back for them.
On the last night of the trip they stayed under
a huge gum tree on the bank of the Rocky River
near Stone Hut. It was here that a cat joined
them for the rest of the journey. For year s after
the smaller children at the homestead would climb
trees, sheds, etc., to look for the big gum tree
where they had camped the last night of their trip
Any tree that stood above it s surrounding mates
was accused to be the one Between Wirrabara
and the new home, they had to cross a steep, deep
creek and for safety sake the mother and all t l ' -
children had to get out of the waggon, while tlw


father drove the team over the creek. The road
from now on was but a winding track through the
scrub. What a relief it must have been for the
mother when she first viewed her new home, and
what a joy seeing her first born child—George,
First Home in Hundred of Appila.
The shepherd’s hut did for the kitchen and din-
ing room, with a lean-to at the back for the pantry.
Alai'ge iron room divided did for a bedroom for the
parents and smaller children. It was here that
Jane, Paul, William, Alexander and Thomas were
born. The older boys and the working men slept
in a well built bam. The cooking was done in a
colonial oven with the fire on top, and also under-
neath when it was needed for baking bread. The
camp oven was also used on an open fire outside
the kitchen, where bread would be baked in the
oven and scones on the lid.
Pathetic Tragedies
It was around this fire that a sad and sorrow-
ful accident happened. Peter only a few years of
age fell into the fire and was badly burned. The
father and mother did all they could for the little
sufferer. They were many miles from a doctor and
there were no means of going for one other than
walking or riding a draught horse. They attended
the child for several days and all seemed to be pro-
gressing satisfactorily with little Peter. One morn-
ing when the mother woke she found the child dead
in bed The father leaving the mother with their
dead child, walked twelve miles into Melrose at
the foot of Mt. Remarkable, to make arrangements
for the child’s burial. He carried the little coffin
home on his shoulder, and next day Mr. Woolf or d.
a neighbouring farmer, lent his spring cart to take
all that remained of little Peter to the Cemetery


near the foot of Mt. Remarkable. This was the
only cart in the district as all travelling was done
on horse back owing to the bad roads.
In 1879 —1882 a stone house, with five rooms,
was built. The stone for this house came from Mr.
James Milne’s quarry, as well as the stones for
Point Lowly Light House. It was in this house
their youngest child Arthur McDougall Sargent was
born. On October nth., 1882. Henry the fourth
son of Mr. and Mrs., Sargent, fell from a tree very
near to where the mother was milking. The other
members of the family were about to sit down to
their evening meal when coo-ee after coo-ee came
from the distressed mother. Henry had gone to
his mother with hi s injury saying that he had fallen
from the tree, on a "'bike and injured himself.
George who had not long came in from the paddock
mounted one of the working horses (Prince) and
rode six miles to Wirrabara. He wired for the
doctor at Laura, then rode on till he met the doc-
tor. Henry, however, died before the doctor arrived
and was buried at Wirrabara at the age of twelve
years. He was a bright, clever and loveable child
who was cut off in the bud. He was well liked by
all, especially his school mates, who spoke moist
highly of his character, his cheerful disposition and
his kindness to the younger children. The day he
was buried was the Picnic Day, which the children
had been looking forward to. for weeks before hand.
George never forgot that ride on a tired horse, ad
he had to gallop behind the doctor as far as Wirra-
bara and from then onwards in front to show him
the track. As it was a very dark night, Dr. Ham-
ilton remained until morning.
An Incident in Cattle Yard.
Mr. Sargent was most skilful in the handling
of wild cattle. A most amusing story is told as
to how he took the conceit out of one man. Mr-


Sargent had taken his young cattle down to a neigh-
bour, a Mr. James Milne, who had excellent cattle
yards in which to brand the cattle. While the men
were lassoing and branding the cattle, a man who
held a cosy Government position sat on the yard
rails commenting upon the way the stockmen were
handling the cattle, and also making a general
nuisance of himself. Suddenly Mr_ Sargent skilfully
threw the lasso over the man. hauled him off the
fence and quickly had him tied up as though he
were a steer. When let loose the man kept well
away from the cattle yards.
Purple Straw Wheat Introduced to
South Australia.
In March, 1883, Mr. Sargent when visiting his
brothers in N.S.W., procured from them a bag of
purple straw wheat. This wheat was afterwards
known a s Sargent’s Sydney Purple Straw—it being
a superior wheat to the old purple straw at that
time grown in S.A. The Sargents of N.S.W were
very careful in the cleaning of their wheat,' either
for seed or for show. Their method of preparing
wheat for the Sydney show, where they gained
honors, was simple though somewhat primitive.
They would put the wheat several time through the
hand winnower then they would spend their even-
ings spreading a little of their grain on the kitchen
table sorting out the best grains. So they would
spend their winter evenings. The sons said that it
was tiresome work sitting night after night pick-
ing out only the best shape grains of wheat. I
leave it to the old-time( farmers of South Australia
to say whether their evenings were spent in vain
or not. Ip recent years I met a farmer who lives
in the Swan Reach district still growing this var-
iety of wheat, 50 odd year s after its introduction
into this State.


When the bag of wheat arrived at Gladstone
which was the nearest railway station to Wirrabara
a few grains of wheat leaked out of the bag onto
the These grains were eagerly gathered
by the farmers present. Mr_ Sargent had some ex-
tra clean land in the S.W. corner of the north pad-
dock on which to sew this wheat and from, the one
bag he harvested 32 bags the first year. For years
it became the main crop of wheat in South Austra-
lia. It had a long head and often four grains wide
which produced some remarkable heavy crops. As
a lad I drove the horses in thei stripper in a forty
bushel crop and of course the crop was planted
broadcast and without super.
Passing of Henry Sargent.
Mr. Sargent did not live to enjoy the ■
of the wheat that he introduced, for in the same
year, 1883, he was taken ill and remover to a pri-
vate hospital at Laura in Mr. James, Milne’s trap.
While on his bed of sickness hi s son, George,
brought to him the report of the result of the first
harvest of the new wheat. Mr, Sargent said: ‘‘You
havea good wheat there George, so look after it.”
He died at Laura on December 24th., ! 1883, and was
buried at Wirrabara.
Willie O’Brien, a man who for many year s had
been employed by Mr. Sargent, spoke of hi m as
one whose word was his bond. Andrew Heard, a
neighbour, tells how the wheat agent at Port Ger-
mein said regarding Mr. Sargent “We know this
man i s no need to sample his wheat.” This
was at the time when every bag of wheat was
sampled, by the agent.
Straight in all his ways, men placed confidence
in him. He was hard working as far as his health
would allow. At the time of his death he owned


three farms, freehold, the third one being at Glad-
stone, which he bought from his brother-in-law
Lachlan McDougall. Mr_ Sargent’s brothers and
sGcers were: Thomas and George, Mrs. Bell, in
M.S.W., Mary (Mrs. James Johnston), Mildura,
Tic., Julia (Mrs. Woodman), S.A., and James S.A.
Two half brothers, Aaron and William Harding.
The children of Henry and Elizabeth Sargent,
who reached their maturity were: George, farmer,
Crystal Brook; Ellis (Mrs_ Thomas Murdock);
John, farmer, late of Gladstone, who was Mayor
of Gladstone several times and also scout leader
and a great man with young men. James, late of
Little Hampton was a gardener; Elizabeth (Mrs-
Walter Slee), Melrose; Hannah (Mrs. Robert Cox)
late of Parkside; Dougal, farmer, Swan Reach;
Jane Paul, W.A.; William A. T., farmer, W.A.,
who vained many honors with his stud merino flock,
Arthur McDougal, W.A., a successful farmer in
wheat and wool.
Mrs. Elizabeth Sargent
Too high a tribute could not be paid to the
memory of Mrs. Sargent, who toiled for her family.
She rose early to prepare breakfast for the men
while the little children were still in bed. Later
she would see the older children off to school, be-
fore feeding her younger ones. There was no
patent baby’s food used then. The staple food was
bread and milk made from wholesome home-made
bread and milk. Even the men and younger chil-
dren enjoyed a plate of bread and milk made by
Mrs. Sargent. The principal foods in those days
were bacon, beef, home-made bread, home-made
yeast cake, cheese, butter and cream, all of which
were produced on the farm.


At dinner time (mid-day) the little ones would
sit around the family table, but were put to bed
before the men came in from work at dusk. Mrs.
Sargent must have been a wonderful cook as men
who were employed spoke most highly of her ex-
cellent menu- Her own daughters in after years
spoke of her good cooking. At one time a 200 lb.
bag of flour would last a fortnight.
In the midst of her house work and attending
to her large family she always found time to read
her Bible, the book that she dearly loved. While
feeding her children at the breast she read her Bible
three times. “Sometime s I sat a little longer than
was actually required for the feeding of the child,”
she said. As the children grew older how she loved
to gather them around her on a Sunday evening
and read the Bible in turn. The simple evening
prayer she taught her children is well worth recorf
ing. It took in nearly the whole world, as we chil-
dren knew it.
“Gentle Jesus meek and mild, look upon a little
child,
Pity my simplicity, Suffer me to come to Thee.
O Lord bless Father and Mother, Sisters, Bro-
thers, Uncles, Aunts and Cousins.
Bless everybody and make me a good boy/girl.
for Jesus sake, Amen.”
Truly her children could rise and call her 'blest
and say with the writer:
For what we are to-day we thank our Mother,
Mother the best of earthly gifts, we love her,
She sought not her own comfort, she sought to
bless,
To lead errant footsteps to Jesus sweet rest,
We pray now Mother dear. God will give to you
All the many blessings that to you are due
—D-S.


Home Incidents.
Every spring of the year Mr. Andrew Clark,
who was storekeeper at Wirrabara asked Mrs. Sar-
gent to fill a 40lb. jar of potted butter. He used
to say that a lb of her butter was more bulky,
therefore of better and lighter texture than other
butter. At first he thought the difference was in
weight but the scales showed that Mrs. Sargent’s
butter wa s more in bulk not weight. She had a
remarkably cool hand for butter making and at one
time made her own candles from the surplus fat.
By nature of a retiring disposition, yet one may
envy her courage and steadiness of nerve in an
emergency. When the children were playing one
day near the stable they saw a six foot snake
Their screams soon brought their mother and eldest
sister Ellis to the scene of excitement, and they
very soon despatched the deadly animal. Snakes
were very plentiful as in most new country.
Other Snake Episodes.
Elizabeth (Jun) and the writer were sent to
bring back some young horses that had strayed
down the road. On the road was an °ld square
tank lying on its side, Elizabeth, in play, was going
to put her young brother in the tank, but they
found a big snake there. Leaving the snake in pos-
of the tank, the children quickly scurried
after the horses. On returning, they each found
a stick to kill the snake, which was now waiting
by the roadside. One look at the large reptile and
the children dropped their sticks and fled.
Dougal wag) sent to bring a cow into the yard
for his sister Ellis to milk and he saw a big snake


crawl into a hole. He went for his sister and on
returning found the snake waiting for them on the
path. Ellis with a well aimed blow killed the
reptile.
Port Germein Gorge.
Some years after the death of her husband Mrs,
Sargent drove a horse (Charlie) and trap alone on
a pitch dark night through the Port Germein Gorge.
Having no light she frequently struck matches so
that anyone coming might see her. The xoad at
that time crossed the creek 48 time in four miles,
of which 42 times were crossed in two miles. It
was a winding road with high steep hills around
so that even m daylight it was impossible to see
any distance. It was through this Gorge that two
horsemen. James Milne and Henry Sargent, rode
'horse back in the early days to find a road through
the Flinder’s Range to the sea. As the road became
too rough for their steeds they were foi’ced to trave 1
the last part of the journey by foot.
At the sea-end of the Port Germein jetty, which
is the longest in the State, li miles, Mrs. Sargent
found a swarm of honey bees hanging on the jetty.
With her hands she put the bee s into a bag amidst
the cheers of the passengers who were on a nearby
vessel. She was certainly a very strong woman al-
though after the accident of her son Henry, she
could not bear to see a child climb a tree.
Total Abstinence Advocates.
In the early days of the married life of Mr.
and Mrs. Sargent it was the custom in South Aus-
tralia to supply the men working in the harvest
field with wine


It was thought at that time that men could not
stand the heavy harvest work in hot Australia with-
out being fortified with alcoholic stimulants. But
this wa s soon found to be practically and economic-
ally wrong, and the wine was banished from their
home—they becoming advocates for total abstinence
from all alcoholic liquids.
Their children became members of the Appila
West Band of Hope, of which the monthly meetings
were for years the outstanding social gathering for
the young people. Their daughter' Hannah tells how
when a girl attending the Gladstone school, the head
teacher would send the children to the hotel for
drinks. When Hannah was sent she returned car-
rying the bottle at arm s length. On another day
when asked to go for more drinks, she refused as
she remembered her pledge, “Touch not, taste not,
handle not.” Soon after this the teacher was dis-
missed, but later reformed and took up private
teaching in New South Wales.
The strict practical religious teaching that Mrs.
Sargent embedded into the hearts and minds of her
children is seen to-day reaching to the second and
third generation. Many are engaged in active
Church and Sunday School work. Mrs. Sargent
was a very keen worker in the Methodist Church,
all her life, but in her later years she was a faithful
soldier of the Salvation Army. Two of her grand-
daughters are officers in the Salvation Army.
Some years after the death of her husband she
married a Mr., Whyte, and in xBBB went to live
at Murraytown. Some years later she removed to
Glenelg where she died on Friday, December 7th.,
1917. She was buried on the Sunday at the North
Brighton Cemetery at the age of 73.


A life of toil with hardships but always faith
love for her God, family and fellow' creatures.
My Jesus, I love Thee.
I know Thou art mine,
For Thee all the pleasures,
Of sin I resign,
My preciou s Redeemer,
My Saviour art Thee,
If ever I love Thee,
My Jesus ’tis now.
