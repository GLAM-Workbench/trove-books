OPENING.
The Chairman, in opening the pro-
ceedings, pointed out the objects of
the Labor movement, and declared
that the party could make little pro-
gress without the loyal assistance of
the women. The policy of the party
was humanitarian, and they desired
to legislate for the masses. There
were many questions on the agenda
paper deserving of careful considera-
tion, and he was sure that their de-
liberations would prove of the utmost
value to the movement.
ELECTION OF OFFICERS.
The meeting then proceeded to elect
a president. Three nominations were
received, and the voting resulted as


follows ;—Mrs. Beadle, 28; Mrs. But-
ler, 17; Mrs. Ruffy Hill, 11. The
counting of the preference votes gave
the final result:—Mrs. Beadle, 33;
Mrs .Butler, 23.
Mrs. Beadle was warmly received
in rising to return thanks. She said
that she regarded it as a great honor
to be elected president of the first wo-
men’s Labor conference.
On a ballot, Mrs. Stuart was elected
secretary, receiving 30 votes to 25 cast
for Mrs. Cort. Mesdames Hill and
Butler were elected vice-presidents.
Mrs. Cort was asked to act as min-
ute secretary, and Miss May Holman
to take a shorthand report of the
proceedings.
ADDRESS BY MR. BATH.
The Minister for Lands (Mr. T.
Bath) briefly addressed the gathering,
and expressed regret at the unavoid-
able absence of the Premier. Such
a large and representative gahering
emphasaised the importance of the
Labor movement, and it augured well
for the future influence of women on
industrial, political and social ques-
tions, so many of which were of pres-
sing importance. There were many
points which depended almost entirely
for their accomplishment upon the
sympathy of women. Logic in men
wa simportant, but it was women’s in-
tuition which pointed the way in the
true paths of civilisation and reform.
Mr. Bath referred appreciatively to
the endowment of motherhood—and
said that as soon as one reform was
passed the need for a number of
others was developed. They must not
only look after the child at its en-
trance into the world, but must also
guard its welfare in later years.
Educational work was left too much
to the teacher, and there should be
greater co-operation on the part of
the parents. Mr. Bath concluded by
hoping that the conference would not
merely be a great success, but would
be the precursor of others in the fu-
ture.
Mesdames Johnson, Green, Dodd,
Wheeler and Rapley were elected as
an agenda committee.
PRELIMINARY BUSINESS.
The standing orders of the Bunbury
Conference were adopted.
The hours of sitting were fixed as
follows:—Morning sitting, 10.30 a.m.
to 1 p.m.; afternoon, 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.
After a short discussion it was de-
cided to exclude the press and to sup-
ply reports to the papers.
At 1 p.m. the conference adjourned
till 2.30 p.m.
Upon re-assembling, Mrs. Johnson
submitted a report from the agenda
committee with regard to the grouping
of the various items, and this was
adopted.
Greetings were received from Mrs.
Skene, who reported that she was get-
ting on very well. A motion of sym-
pathy with Mrs. Skene was carried.
EQUALITY OF SEXES.
Mrs. Holman moved resolutions 1,
2, 3 and 4, as follows;
Labor Women’s Social Club.
1. That this first Labor Women’s
Conference, urges upon the Govern-
ment to promote legislation that will
remove sex disability and grant to
women full citizenship, thereby per-
mitting them to nominate as a can-
didate for the Legislative Council
and Assembly, Municipal Councils,
Roads Boards, Licensing Benches,
etc.
2. Also since women find it a
great hardship and injustice that
they should have to plead before
men only, and since it is evident
that the interests of women suffer
for the want of comprehension or
prejudice of a male jury, this con-
ference of women urges upon the
Government the need in all case
were women and children are con-
cerned to have women upon the jury,
and requests that they shall be eli-
gible therefor.
3. This conference of women is of
opinion that women magistrates
shall be appointed to deal with all
cases concerning women and child-
ren, and that only women be appoin-
ted to try all cases coming before
the children’s court, and that con-
ference further urges that in all
Government offices (State and Fed-
eral) men and women shall receive
equal pay for equal work.
Donnybrook Branch Women’s A.L.F.
4. That this Conference affirms
the desirability of the admission of
women to Parliament, and considers
that when elected they shall be re-
garded as being eligible to accept
and fill any position therein open to
members of the opposite sex.
On the suggestion of Mrs. Johnson


it was decided to defer the consider-
ation of the latter portion of item 3,
after the words “Children’s court,” till
a later stage.
In moving the adoption of the reso-
lutions, Mrs. Holman said she thought
it was the time that women took their
places in parliament and other public
bodies. It would be very good to
have them help the men in dealing
with the different questions of the day.
Sh ethought that women would be
able to perform some of the duties of
jurors better than men, and she would
also like to see women in children’s
courts.
Mrs. Murphy in seconding, said it
was time for women to take their
place side by side with the men, and
to have the privilege of sitting in par-
liament. There were many positions
in which women could be a very great
help to men, as they could bring in
legislation which would be very bene-
ficial to women and children.
The President said that all that was
needed was an alteration of the con-
stitution relating to the qualifications
of a member of parliament. By alter-
ing the word “man” to “person,” wo-
men would become eligible to sit in
the legislature.
Mrs. Needham moved as an amend-
ment to delete the word “only” in
item 3. The father of achild had as
much right as te mother to fill a po-
sition on the Children’s Court.
Mrs. Butler seconded the amend-
ment ,on the ground of the
ment, on the ground that she favored
the equality of the sexes.
Mrs. Stuart said that she believed
that she was responsible for the put-
ting of the word “only” in the motion.
Her reasons for so doing were that
she thought that the children under
the age of 18 would be more likely to
receive sympathic justice from women
than from men. The best of men did
not know how to sympathise with
young children, and they knew that
in the home the children turned to-
wards the mother for care and guid-
ance.
Mrs. O’Brien contended that men
were just as sympathic as women.
Mrs. Mellows pointed out that one of
thier resolutions was in favor of the
equality of the sexes in every position.
She thought it would be better to have
the men with the women on the Child-
ren’s Court,
Mrs. Ruffy Hill agreed with Mrs.
Stuart. The best man in the world
had not a mother’s heart, but every
women knew how to approach a child.
There were good men on the Child-
ren’s Court, but women Avould be able
to sympathise better.
Mrs. Green said that the Conference
was of very great significance to her
as indicating the progress made by
the women of the State 1 , but they were
not quite out of slavery yet. Women
should be in parliament as well as men
Man was superior to woman in the in-
tellectual field, but woman excelled
on the conduct side of life. Women
had just as much brains as men, but
ail through the dark ages they had
not been used. Now they were awak-
ening to the advantages of education.
The Labor movement and the social
movement closely concerned women,
who had not used their brains as
much as they should have done. She
did not think that women should sit
alone on the Children’s Court.
Mrs. Somerville agreed with Mrs.
Stuart that the child went to its
mother Tor sympathy, but did not be-
lieve that the mother knew how to
deal with every child. The father
could feel for the boys. Women could
be of great assistance on the Child-
ren’s Court, but she did not think they
should sit alone.
Mrs. Needham’s amendment to de-
lete the word “only” was then put and
carried.
Mrs. O’Brien moved an amendment
that women should not be allowed to
sit in parliament. She said that na-
ture destined women to bear children
and to mould the character and future
of the child. To do his well required
all the energy and care of women. A
mother had a privilege and a power
far greater than if she were a ruler
of nations, and moved in a sphere
where her goodness and wisdom
could be exercised to the fullest.
The child was the future citizen and
its worth to the community depended
largely upon the mother’s early care,
advice and example. Politics was a
sphere which was all-absorbing, and
were women to embark upon its
stormy sea. they would be compelled
to neglect their home and children. If
women entered part of their prestige
would suffer. To-day they experi-
enced the highest reverence and re^


spect from men, but once they entered
into competition and became the
rivals of men in argument and debate
they would fall from their present
high status. By entering politics wo-
men would lose more than they would
gain.
Mrs. Laidlaw seconded the amend-
ment. She did not think that women
were fit physically to undertake the
same duties as men.
Mrs. Pimm said that while she a-
greed with the idea that women should
take positions on various boards, she
did not agree that they should sit in
parliament.
Mrs. Stuart supported the motion,
and argued that women could be of
the greatest service on the licensing
bench. Women brought their sons up
to manhood, but could not legislate
for them when they were grown up.
They were turned out in the world to
work under man-made laws. To say
that a woman’s place was always at
home was a worn out argument.
Mrs. Ruffy Hill said she did not
think that the best men in the world
understood children properly, the
daughters even less than the sons.
She considered therefore that she
ought to be able to vote to put a
woman into parliament to legislate
for her daughters. It was said that
a woman who entered parliament
would neglect her home, but a woman
who would do that would neglect her
home in any circumstances.
Mrs. O’Brien, in reply, said that a
woman’s influence could do as much
good outside of parliament as inside.
The amendment was lost by a large
majority.
Mrs. Cort supported the motion, and
said that it was owing to the Legisla-
tive Council that women were not al-
lowed to practice as barristers in this
State. That chamber was the greatest
barrier women had against them, and
they must fight against it. Women
were not allowed to sit in the State
parliament, but they were not debar-
red in the case of the Federal parlia-
ment. If it was logical for a woman
to have a vote, it was equally logical
that she should be allowed to sit in
parliament. Women were never given
positions on any council or board
which had salaries attached to them.
Mrs. Dodd said it had been stated
that if women entered parliament they
would be a good deal away from home.
A woman, however, would go home
when the business of the House was
over. She would rather have laws
passed by women with clear brains
than by men with muddled brains.
They must not overlook the fact that
it would be just as right for the Con-
servative women to enter parliament
as the Labor women. It would be a
very good thing to have women legis-
lating for women.
Mrs. Somerville claimed that women
were equal to men so far as brains
were concerned, but there was one
point she wished to stress, namely
that women possessed a peculiar tem-
perament and were apt to suffer. On
account of that she thought they
should give place to the men in parlia-
ment.
Mrs. Waddell said that if women
entered parliament they would not
neglect their homes, because they
could provide out of their salary for
someone to do the housework.
Mrs. Dobson pointed out that while
the men had an eight hours’ day
laundry women had to work from 8
a.m. to 6 p.m. for 5/ per day. She
knew that from practical experience.
It was quite time they had women to
legislate for them in parliament.
The President said that 90 women
had been elected in Norway, and 160
others had come second. There was
a woman in the Chinese national par-
liament, and women were also elected
in Finland. There had also been
mayoresses who had been great suc-
cesses, and she did not see why in
time women should not be on an
equal footing with men and be a suc-
cess also.
The resolutions were altered to read
that the Government be asked to
amend the constitution by deleting
the word “men,” and putting in its
place “person,” thereby giving full
citizenship to women. Carried.
EQUAL PAY FOR MEN AND WOMEN
Miss O’Grady moved item 5 on the
agenda paper;
South West Clothing Trades Union.
That equality of employment and
wage be persistently advocated for
men and women, practised in our
own labor unions’ business transac-
tions.
Women had to take their places side
by side with the men, and she cou


tended that their work should be re-
cognised.
Miss Jennings seconded.
Mrs. Ruffy Hill said there should be
no difference in payment because one
worker happened to be a woman. A
number of women had delicate hus-
bands and families to support, and it
was a matter of justice that equal pay
should be given for equal work.
Mrs. Holman said that some of the
women working in the factories and
large warehouses were very badly
paid.
Mrs. Stuart: Equal pay means that
the employer will get his pound of
flesh out of the women.
The motion was carried.
Mrs. Needham moved item No. 7:
That this Conference affirms the
principle of equal pay for equal
work, and congratulates the Federal
Government on its observance of
that principle.
Mrs. Gilbert seconded.
Mrs. Cort said that the principle of
equal pay for equal work was already
being carried out by the Federal Par-
liament.
The motion was carried.
WOMEN ON BOARDS.
Mrs. Collett moved item No. 8:
Eastern Goldfields Women’s Labor
League.
That in the opinion of this Con-
ference women should be appointed
to all School Boards and Hospital
Boards.
Mrs. Finney seconded the motion,
and it was carried.
MATERNITY ENDOWMENT.
Mrs. Mellows move items 9, 11 and
12:
Subiaco A.L.F.
9. The Federal Maternity Bonus.
Labor Women’s Social Club.
11. That this first Labor Women’s
Conference endorses the proposed
Maternity Grant, apd suggests that
when the said Grant becomes law
the same be given direct to the
mother, and sincerely hopes that the
powers that be may be able to see
their way to increase said amount
as in other parts of the world.
12. That this first Labor Women’s
Conference urges the adoption of a
system whereby mothers shall re-
ceive continued adequate spport to
enable them to attend to their own
children, without having to compete
in the labor market.
She desired to add to the motions
“that this first Labor Women’s Con-
ference pass a vote of congratulation
on the Maternity Bonus Bill being
placed on the statute books, and re-
commend that it be extended to twins
and triplets.”
Mrs. Needham seconded.
The motion was carried, and Con-
ference adjourned at 6 p.m.
SECOND DAY’S SITTING.
Conference met again at 10.30 a.m.
on Thursday, October 24, the Presi-
dent (Mrs. Beadle) being in the chair.
CONGRATULATIONS.
Congratulations were received from
the State Executive of the A.L.F., and
the Bellevue branch of the same or-
ganisation.
PRESS REPORTS.
Mrs. Stuart reported that the press
had refused to print reports of the
Conference unless their representa-
tives were present.
AGENDA COMMITTEE.
A report was received from the
agenda committee as to the grouping
of items, and was discussed at some
length.
SEX PHYSIOLOGY.
Mrs. Stuart moved item 45 on be-
half of the Labor Women’s Social
Club;
That sex physiology be taught in
our State schools to children over
12 years of age, the boys by a duly
qualified medical man, and the girls
by a medical woman or certificated
nurse.
The mover emphasised the importance
of the subject, and referred to the need
of instruction being given by qualified
teachers only.
The President seconded the motion,
and pointed out that a large number of
teachers in the schools were not
qualified to teach on such a delicate
subject as sex physiology. It spoke
for the progress made by women that
such a large Conference as this was
willing to discuss the question.
Mrs. Green moved to add the follow-
ing words to the motion; “That a set
of suitable lessons be prepared by ex


we reeconomically free the social evil
would be largely done away with.
Mrs. Butler moved a further amend-
ment that the word “ medical ” be
struck out.
Miss Howard seconded the amend-
ment.
At 1 p.m. the' Conference adjourned
for lunch.
When the sitting was resumed at
2 o'clock, Mrs. Butler’s amendment
was put and lost.
Mrs. Stuart moved as a further
addendum: “That the parents be ad-
mitted to the lessons, mothers with the
girls and fathers with the boys.”
Mrs. Mellows urged that the fathers
would not have the time to attend.
Mrs. Dobson said that many of the
men were working in shifts, and could
manage to attend.
The motion, with the two addenda,
was carried.
CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN.
Mrs. Stuart moved item 68 on behalf
of the Labor Women’s Social Club:
That this first Labor Women’s
Conference, being of the opinion that
flogging is useless as a preventa-
tive og sexual crimes against young
children, urges that the law be al-
tered t omake the punishment for
such offences segregation for life.
If flogging were of any use in pro-
tecting children she would support it,
but the offenders were sexual maniacs,
and flogging would do them no good.
Segregation was the only remedy.
Mrs. Holman seconded the motion.
She believed in segregation, but not
in flogging.
Mrs. O’Brien agreed with the pre-
vious speakers, and said that flogging
would only lead to a desire for re-
venge.
Mrs. Cort moved to add the following
words: “And that they be placed un-
der medical treatment.” The offence
should be treated as a disease rather
than a crime.
Mrs. Dobson seconded the proposed
addendum.
The motion, with the addendum, was
put and carried.
ADMITTING THE PRESS.
Mrs. Stuart said that she had found
that a motion could be rescinded, and
she desired to move:
That we rescind the motion not
to allow the press to he present.”
Mrs. Waddell seconded.
The motion was supported by Mes-
dames. Rapley, Ruffy Hill, Cort, and
Green; and opposed by Mesdames But-
lerfi, Thomas and O’Brien.
The motion was carried, as was also
a further motion by Mesdames Stuart
and Weare: “That the press be re-
admitted.”
ASSISTANCE TO MOTHERS.
Mrs. Lewis (Maylands) moved item
10:
That this . first Labor Women's
Conference urge upon the 1 Govern-
ment the need for making provision
—by means of legislation—for as-
sistance to be provided for all
widowed mothers left with young
children.
She said that the present Government
was spending £6OOO per year helping
widows, but it was quite possible that
in future the vote might be cut down.
Every widow should have this help
as a right, and not as a charity dole.
Mrs. Mazzoletti seconded. There
was nothing so hard as the struggle
of a mother to keep her young chil-
dren.
Mrs. Dobson sail that a woman who
had to look after her home and also
to support her children was doing
what was practically three women’s
work.
Mrs. Ruffy Hill moved as an amend-
ment to delete all the words after
“Government,” and to add the words:
“That assistance be provided for all
women who have children dependent
upon them.” She' urged that assist-
ance should not be confined to widows.
Mrs. Holman seconded the amend-
ment.
Mrs. Griffin supported the amend-
ment. She knew of a number of
cases where poor women were suf-
fering for want of a little help.
Mrs. Dood said that where men
neglected their wives she 1 would like
to know they were made to work hard
in gaol, and the money they earned
given to their wives.
The amendment was carried.
. Mrs. Lewis said that in order to
make it binding on all future Govern-
ments she would move:
That this first Labor Women’s
Conference recommends that this


item be placed on the 1 statute book.
Mrs. Weare seconded the motion,
and it was carried.
MATERNITY NURSING.
Mrs. Cort moved on behalf of the
Moora Women’s Branch, A.L.F.:
That some scheme of district nurs-
ing be inaugurated, with provision
for lectures in Midwifery by Dis-
trict Medical Officers, and with spe-
cial facilities for country districts,
so that the well-being and good
health of both mother and child may
be guarded.
The following motions by the East-
ern Goldfields Women’s Labor League
were considered at the same time:
That this Conference is of the
opinion that the Government should
erect maternity homes in all large
centres.
That the Conference requests the
Government to grant free railway
fares to women travelling to and
from any centre for the purpose of
atending a maternity hospital.
Mrs. Cort referred to the hardships
which women in the country districts
had to undergo, and said that some
system of district nursing was abso-
lutely necessary. From a maternity
hospital trained nurses could be sent
out into the country, and these could
train the women by means of lectures.
She congratulated Mr. Underwood up-
on his advocacy in the House of
free nurses and free medical attend-
ance.
Mrs. Wheeler seconded. Instead of
mothers being brought to the mater-
nity homes trained nuTses could be
send to the homes of the mothers. She
would like to see some system of train-
ing adopted upon the lines of that
carried out by the late Dr. Haynes.
She thought this would be a very good
thing to supplement the maternity
bonus.
Mrs. Mazzoletti said a trained nurse
was necessary at Denmark, which was
four hours’ journey from Albany. An
application to the Government had
met with the response that the matter
had nothing to do with them.
Mrs. Holman thought it was time
that a maternity hospital was built by
the State Government, and a district
nursing scheme inaugurated. She
thought that a deputation from Con-
ference to the Government would carry
some weight.
The resolutions were carried unani-
mously.
THE MEDICAL PROFESSION.
Mrs. Collett moved on behalf of the
Eastern Goldfields’ Women’s Labor
League:—
That the Conference recommend
the Government to nationalise the
medical profession.
The prices charged by the medical
profession on the goldfields were ex-
tortionate, and everything possible
should be done to get the profession
nationalised.
Mrs. Stuart seconded. If the pro-
fession were nationalised, there would
be an assurance that every doctor was
competent, which was not the caes at
present.
Mrs. Ruffy Hill said that it was to
the interest of the doctors to have
sickness. The Japanese paid a high
salary to the doctor in whose district
there was no sickness.
Mrs. Thomas, in supporting the mo-
tion, said that (Joctors’ fees were very
expensive, and many lives had been
lost for the want of a little attention.
Poor people should have the benefit
of the best medical attention that could
be got.
The motion was carried unani-
mously.
STATE CLOTHING FACTORY.
The President moved item 26:
That this first Labor Women's
Conference requests the Government
to establish a State Clothing Fac-
tory for the purpose of manufactur-
ing all uniforms needed by civil
servants and State officials.
She said that in one of the private fac-
tories where uniforms were made
there were employed four males, eight
females, and eleven children, the
wages of the latter ranging from 5/
to 22/6. Trousers for some of the
railway men were made at 7/10 per
pair. There was sufficient work to
guarantee the running of a State
clothing factory.
Mrs. O’Brien seconded.
Mrs. Mellows asked what the' factory
inspectors were doing in view of the
sweating which was going on.
Miss Swanton, a visitor, was re


quested to speak, and said that
much sweating was going on in the
tailoring trade, for which there was
no redress in the Arbitration Court.
Miss O’Grady said that the union
allowed two apprentices to each adult,
but on account of not having an arbi-
tration award they had no control
over the employers.
Msr. Green moved to add the words;
“And urges that union wages be paid
and speeding-up be abolished; and that
not more than two apprentices be al-
lowed to a journeyman or woman, and
that no child under the age of 15 be
allowed to work.”
Mrs. Dobson seconded.
Mrs. Wheeler said it had to be re-
membered that these girls would be
the future mothers. Something should
therefore be done to bring about the
reforms to do away with injurious
conditions.
Mrs. Beadle spoke in reply, and the
motion was then put and carried unan-
imously.
On the motion of Mesdames Waddell
and O’Brien a hearty vote of thanks
was accorded Miss Swanton for her
address.
The Conference adjourned at 6 p.m.
THIRD DAY’S SITTING.
Conference met at 10.30 a.m. on Oc-
tober 25, Mrs. Beadle presiding.
On behalf of the Labor members of
Parliament, Mr. Heitmann invited the
delegates to an afternoon trip on the
river. The invitation was accepted
on the motion of Mesdames Butler and
Weare.
THE REFERENDA.
Mrs. Needham moved item 27 on be-
half of the Northam branch;
That this Conference appeals to
all mothers and daughters to sup-
port and vote for the amendment of
the Commonwealth Constitution
when submitted for the approval of
the people by referendum at the
next general elections.
The referenda ought to be carried, to
give the Federal Parliament more
power and to prevent the High Court
throwing out so many reforms as un-
constitutional.
Mrs. Stuart seconded.
Mrs. Thomas supported the motion,
and in so doing said that many people
blamed the Labor Party for the high
cost of living. The rise in prices,
however, had followed the rejection of
the referenda proposals. Sugar,
condensed milk, and infants’ foods had
all gone up. The Federal Govern-
ment was helpless, as it had no con-
trol over goods once they entered a
State.
Mrs. Ruffy Hill could not understand
why thinking men and women did not
carry the referenda. Laws passed by
one State were of little avail unless
the other States took similar action,
and no good could be done until power
was conferred on the Federal Parlia-
ment. They must put their shoul-
ders to the wheel and carry the re-
ferenda.
The motion was carried unanimous-
ly.
WOMEN’S SUFFRAGE.
Mrs. Gilbert (Northam) moved item
29:
That a communication be for-
warded to the leader of the British
Labor Party, sympathising with the
women of Great Britain in their en-
deavor to secure adult suffrage.
The women of Australia knew what
a great benefit the suffrage was, and
she thought it would be- only fitting
to send a message of sympathy to
their sisters in England.
Mrs. Dobson seconded, and described
herself as the only English suffragette
at the Conference. The 1 women of
Australia got the suffrage practically
without a fight, and did not value it.
Mrs. Cort said that all the women
of England were not fighting for
adult suffrage. The people who were
fighting were the People’s Adult Suf-
frage League. Others were fighting
for the property vote. She thought
the resolution should be sent to the
leader of the British Labor party, to
be forwarded to the league.
Mrs. Stuart moved as an addendum:
“That the letter of sympathy be for-
warded to the leader of the Labor
Party in Great Britain.”
The motion, with the addendum,
was carried unanimously.


MUNICIPAL SUFFRAGE.
Mrs. Finney (Eastern Goldfields
Women’s Labor League) moved;
That the Government be requested
to grant adult suffrage in all muni-
cipal elections.
Mrs. Lewin seconded.
Mrs. Dobson pointed out that women
in England were eligible to sit on
municipal councils, and had been in-
strumental in carrying a number of
reforms.
The motion was carried unanimous-
ly.
HOURS OF CHILDREN.
Miss Jennings (South-West Cloth-
ing Trades Union) moved:—
That the age of girls employed in
shops, factories, and offices be
raised from 14 years to 16.
And also the following motions stand-
ing in the name of the Eastern Gold-
fields Women’s Labor League:
That children employed in fac-
tories should not receive less than
6/ per week, or be employed more
than 48 hours; the age limit to 'be
restricted to 15 years.
She thought that children should not
be allowed to work more than 40 hours
per week.
Mrs. Finney seconded.
Mrs. Griffin thought that 16 years
was too late; the two years, were
practically wasted. Forty-eight hours
were too long for children to work,
and it would tell against them in after
life.
Mrs . Cort moved as an amend-
ment: —
That apprentices should not work
more than 40 hours in one week,
and that the age should not be less
than 15, also that apprentices should
receive not less than 6/ per week in
shops and factories.
The amendment was carried.
HOURS OF ADULTS.
The following motions were taken
together:
(1) That 44 hours constitute a
week’s work for men and women.
(2) That the hours of women
workers under the “Early Closing
Act" are excessive, and should be
reduced from 52 to 44 hours per
week.
Miss O’Grady moved the joint reso-
lutions on behalf of the South-West
Clothing Trades Union, and said she
would like to see the inspectors more
vigilant.
Mrs. Butler seconded the motions,
which were carried.
REGISTRY OFFICES.
Mrs. Kenneally (North Perth) moved
the following motions: —
(1) Government supervision of pri-
vately owned registry offices.
(2) Amended legislation for in-
spection and State control.
Also, on behalf of the Kalgoorlie
Women’s Club:—
(3) That the fees of employment
brokers should be fixed by law, and
their methods subjected to official
inspection.
She said that the average person who
visited the registry office was not in
a position to argue as to terms, and
had to pay the extortionate fees de-
manded. Some of the agencies sent
people out on wild goose chases so as
to get their fees.
Mrs. Jordan seconded, and said that
many cases of victimisation had oc-
curred on the goldfields.
Mrs. Cort and Miss O’Grady spoke in
support of the motion, which was put
and carried.
IMMIGRATION.
Mrs. Needham (Northam) moved: —
That the preference now given to
immigrants over Australian subjects
in Government Departments be im-
mediately stopped.
Mrs. Needham said that many immi-
grants had been put on as permanent
hands in the railways over the heads
of casual employees.
Mrs. Gilbert seconded.
Mrs. Stuart supported the motion,
and said that she had had some per-
sonal experience in the matter. She
was sorry for the immigrants, who
were brought out by the Wilson Go-
vernment to create surplus labor,


Mrs. Thomas pointed out that the
present Government had to carry out
the contracts entered into.
Mrs. Cort said the immigrants were
brought out to go on the land and
to do domestic work. There was
plenty of room for them in the coun-
try.
Mrs. Weare pointed out that a great
many nominated immigrants were com-
ing out as well as others.
Mrs. Butler said that very often the
immigrant was given a position be-
cause he was more capable to fill it.
Miss Jennings contended that the im-
migrant could not compete with the
Australian. They did their work dif-
ferently at home, and had a longer
time to do it.
Mrs. Austin said that immigrants
were not given preference at the Mid-
land shops.
Mrs. Holman asid that she knew of
cases where immigrants would not
go into the country, and hawked goods
from door to door.
Mrs. Wheeler moved as an adden-
dum: “That stricter supervision be ex-
ercised with regard to immigration.’’
Mrs. Dobson said that the girls in
service at Home had each their parti-
cular duties to do, and it was not right
to expect them to perform the duties
of a whole household.
The motion, with the addendum, was
put and carried.
ASIATIC LABOR.
Mrs. Needham (Northam) moved:
That this Conference urges all
women to support white labor in
preference to Asiatics, and that this
specially applied to the purchase of
vegetables, laundry work, and furni-
ture. , #' i'Uffl
Women were the chief culprits in
this respect. If they would deal only
with Australians it would be much
better for all concerned.
Mrs. Rapley seconded, and said they
were all pledged to support it.
Mrs. Collett said she knew from ex-
perience that many women took part
of their laundry work to Asiatic laun-
dries.
Mrs. Pimm said that people had to
buy through white men what the
Chinaman grew.
Mrs. Thomas said that white men
should be encouraged to have their
own gardens. In a little while 1 , with
the irrigation scheme, the white man
would be able to compete with the
Asiatic.
Mrs. Stuart said she would like to
move as an addeudum; “That the
Federal Government be asked to de-
port all Asiatics,” but at the request of
the President she consented to with-
draw it.
Mrs. Cort moved as an addendum:
“And that with regard to vegetables
we have a State market selling only
white-grown vegetables.”
Mrs .Weare seconded the addendum.
The motion, with the addendum, was
carried.
ADDRESS BY MR. ANGWIN.
When Conference resumed at 2
o’clock an address was delivered by
the Honorary Minister (Mr. Angwin),
who outlined the policy of the Govern-
ment with regard to widows and or-
phans. He said that midwives were
authorised, where necessary, to send
for the district medical officer, and
the latter was paid by the Govern-
ment. A good deal had been said
about the maternity bonus, but the Go-
vernment had been providing bonuses
during the last ten months. The Go-
vernment objected to a mother being
compelled to approach any court to
ask for relief for her children. Several
nurses had been sent into the country,
but the difficulty was with regard to
providing them with homes, and the
Government was considering the ad-
visability of erecting suitable houses.
A site had been chosen for the mater-
nity hospital, which would be erected
at a cost of between £14,000 and
£15,000. The hospital would be un-
der the control of the Government.
Mr. Angwin was accorded a vote
of thanks by acclamation for his
speech.


THE SOCIAL EVIL.
Conference went into committee to
discuss items 88, 89, and 90, which
were moved on behalf of the Bast
Perth branch by Mrs. Neil:
That a law be passed and enforced
that it be made a criminal offence
for a man to solicit a woman for
immoral purposes.
That houses of ill-fame should be
registered, and strictly supervised,
especially in regard to young girls
being detained against their will.
That the subject of prostitution
be considered.
After a good deal of discussion the
following motion was carried, on the
motion of Mesdames Green and Whee-
ler: —
That the Health Act be more
strictly enforced in regard to vene-
real diseases and that medical men
be required to notify the same; also
that lock hospitals be established
away from crowded centres, so as to
obtain complete isolation for these
diseases, and that it be considered
a criminal act for any responsible
person knowing another to be suf-
fering from this disease not to report
it.
Conference assembled again at 7.30
p.m.
EDUCATION.
Mrs. Stuart moved and Mrs. Butler
seconded, item 41;
That during the heat of summer,
having regard to the children’s
health, children should be taught as
much as possible in the open air.
The motion was carried.
Mrs. Stuart moved, and Mrs. Thomas
seconded, item 42:
That home lessons be abolished un-
til after a child has passed the fifth
standard.
Carried.
Mrs. Cort moved, and Mrs. Clarson
seconded, item 43:
That Australian history from up-
to-date and approved text books, lie
taught in our State schools.
Carried.
Mrs. Stuart moved, and Mrs. Ruffy
Hill seconded, item 44:
That in the interests of teachers
and scholars alike no class in our
primary schools should number
more than 40.
Carried.
Mrs. Collett moved, and Mrs. Jor-
dan seconded, item 46;
That only teachers of mature years
be allowed to teach the infants in
our State schools.
After considerable discussion the
motion was lost.
Conference then considered items
47, 48, and 49:
That Conference request the Mini-
ster of Education to introduce a uni-
form set of school books, alterable
only every four years, then only on
the suggestion of a majority of the
teachers, a majority of whom shall
have the right to suggest what the
alteration shall be.
Kalgoorlie Women’s Club.
That enquiries be made of the
Educational Authorities as to why
the class books used in the State
Schools are so frequently changed,
apparently without any sufficient
reason, so that the books used by
the elder children of a family are
of no use to the younger ones when
passing into the same classes.
Northam Branch Women’s A.L.F.
That the Government be requested
to furnish all school requisites at
cost price to children.
It was contended that these were
covered by item 40, dealing with free
school books and requisites, and after
discussion the items were deleted.
NATIONALISATION OF INDUS-
TRIES.
Mrs. Hoffman moved items 22, 23,
and 24, on behalf of the Kalgoorlie
Women’s Club:
That the Conference recommend
the Government to nationalise the
medical profession.


That the undertaking business be
municipalised.
That there should be a State laun-
dry in all large centres, and that
preference of employment be given
to necessitous women.
She said that on the goldfields the
Japanese had a monopoly of the laun-
dry work, and a State laundry would
do away with this. There were many
widows and women with sick husbands
who could be employed in a State
laundry.
Mrs. Collett seconded.
The motions were carried.
FOURTH DAY’S SITTING.
Conference met at 10.30 a.m. on
Saturday, October 26, the President
being in the chair.
ADDRESS BY MR. DODD.
Mr. J. E. Dodd, Honorary Minister,
was present and addressed the dele-
gates. The Government, he said,
might not be able to agree to all that
was asked by the conference, but he
was sure Ministers would be able to
go a good way towards meeting their
views. Delegates should see that the
planks of the Labor platform were
carried out, and should strive to get
to the cause of the evils of our social
system, instead of dealing with effects.
He,thought they could get a start on
the initiative and referenda, and the
right to work. A great deal depended
on the women. John Ruskin once
said: “If the women of England would
dress in mute black for one week they
would stop every war.” All should
try to get down to the root causes
of the evils and see if they could not
make life a little better.
Tfee President expressed the plea-
sure of delegates at the presence of
Mr. Dodd, and assured him they would
all do their best to get the Labor
platform carried out.
INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION.
On behalf of the Northam branch
Mrs. Needham moved:
That all international disputes be-
settled by arbitration to allow the
professional soldier to obtain useful
employment.
The professional soldier lived in idle-
ness, and his upkeep was a great ex-
pense to the State.
Mrs. Gilbert seconded.
Mrs. Oort, while agreeing with the
spirit of the resolution, at the same
'time supported the Commonwealth
compulsory training system. If we
laid down our arms and other nations
did not it would be a very foolish ac-
tion.
Mrs. Stuart said if the Federal Par-
liament concentrated its efforts upon
bringing in the best legislation the
people of the world would rush to Aus-
tralia, and with the added population
there would be no need of militarism.
The motion was lost.
DEFENCE SCHEME.
Mrs. Stuart then moved:
That the first Labor Women's
Conference admits the necessity for
the Commonwealth scheme of de-
fence, but urges upon the Govern-
ment the necessity for saving all
expenditure upon military uniforms,
a simple badge on cap and coat
sleeve being, in its opinion, quite
sufficinet to distinguish all grades
from the lowest to the highest in
the army of defence.
Mrs. Stuart said that war should not
be decked out with trimmings, as it
was too horrible, and they should see
that the defence scheme in no way ap-
proached the military systems of the
old countries. The worst blot in
England’s history was the South Afri-
can war.
Mrs. Kenneally seconded the motion,
and Mrs. Dodd supported.
Mrs. Rapley said that the seventy
millions spent by the British Govern


ment were not wasted, as the work
of making uniforms brought benefit to
some of the people. The uniform
itself was an attraction to the boys.
Mrs. Gilbert moved that all words
after “defence” be struck out.
Mrs. Needham seconded the amend-
ment.
The amendment was carried, and the
motion, as amended, was then passed.
WELCOME TO VISITORS.
Mr. M. F. Troy, Speaker of the Le-
gislative Assembly, was welcomed,
and spoke a few appropriate words to
the Conference.
Messrs Lennon, Kelly and Stock,
delegates to the Timber Workers’ Con-
ference, also expressed their pleasure
at being present. All four gentle-
men expressed the hope that the first
Labor Women’s Conference would be
of great benefit to the movement.
Conference then adjourned.
RIVER EXCURSION.
During the afternoon the delegates
to the Women’s Labor and Timber
conferences were entertained by the
Government by means of a river ex-
cursion, which proved a very enjoy-
able function.
FIFTH DAY.
Conference met at 2 p.m. on Sun-
day, October 27.
PICTURE SHOWS.
Mrs. Finney (Eastern Goldfields
League) moved:
That in the opinion of Conference
some of the pictures now shown are
unsuitable for children.
Mrs. Hoffman seconded.
Mrs. Ruffy Hill moved an amend-
ment: —
That a State Board elected by the
people should be appointed to super-
vise picture shows.
Mrs. Butler seconded the amend-
ment.
Mrs. Cort said that the picture pro-
grammes were mixed ones. If they
could get some good industrial pic-
tures, showing the condition of the
workers, it would do some good.
Mrs. Austin thought there should
be some regulation prohibiting chil-
dren under 14 attending the shows, as
some of the pictures did great harm
to young people.
The amendment was carried unani-
mously.
PROPOSED BENEVOLENT FUND.
Mrs. Weare moved on behalf of the
Labor Women’s Social Club:—
That this first Labor Women’s
Conference urges legislation for the
purpose of creating a Benevolent
Fund, either by an extra tax of sd.
in the £, or by deducting said
amount from the usual income tax;
all incomes of £250 and over per
annum to be taxed for said purposes.
The mover said that the work could
be carried out by the Charities De-
partment. A good deal of collecting
was carried out for various charitable
institutions, and the people with small
incomes gave the greater part of the
donations.
Mrs. Dobson seconded. She would
rather pay a small tax than be sub-
jected to the continual strain of buy-
ing tickets, etc.
Mrs. Dodd moved as an amend-
ment :
That this Conference is of opinion
that a benevolent fund be created
for hospitals and necessitous people
solely administered by the State, by
means of a greater tax on the unim-
proved value of land and an absen-
tee tax.
She expressed the opinion that the
unearned increment ought to be taxed
for benevolent purposes.
Mrs. O’Brien seconded, and spoke


warmly regarding the huge tracts of
land held unused by big landowners.
After several delegates had spoken
in support the amendment was agreed
to.
CHILDREN AS COLLECTORS.
Mrs. Collett moved, on behalf of the
Eastern Goldfields League:
That Conference urges the Gov-
ernment to pass an Act to make it
unlawful for a child under the age
of 14 to collect for any cause what-
ever.
Also item 75: —
That the penny prick card be not
allowed to be given to children under
11 years.
She knew from experience that it was
very easy for young children to spend
or lose money.
Mrs. Hoffmann seconded, and said
I hat the money was a great tempta-
tion to the children.
Mesdames Baker, Austin, and Dob-
son supported the motion.
Mrs. Cort moved as an amend-
ment:—
That the Minister for Education
give instructions to school teachers
not to distribute collecting cards of
any description whatever, and that
it be made unlawful for any organi-
sation authorising children under
16 to collect.
Mrs. Austin seconded the amend-
ment, which was carried.
BOYS AND TOBACCO.
Mrs. Finney moved item 77, on be-
half of the Eastern Goldfields Labor
Women’s League;
That in the opinion of Congress
the sale of tobacco and cigarettes
should be prohibited to boys under
the age of 18 years.
She considered it very necessary, es-
pecially on the goldfields, to restrict
the sale of tobacco to children.
Mrs. Murphy, in seconding, thought
that the sale of cigarettes ought to be
prohibited altogether.
Mrs. Dodd said that the remedy lay
in the nationalisation of the tobacco
trade, but Mrs. Stuart said this would
not prevent the boys getting tobacco.
The motion was lost.
SAVING CHILD LIFE.
Mrs. Collett moved item 74, on be-
half of the Eastern Goldfields Women’s
League;
That the Conference requests the
Government to use every endeavor
to save child life.
Mrs .Finney seconded.
Mrs. Dobson said the most important
thing was to protect the mother.
Mrs. Wheeler said that statistics
showed that there was a greater in-
fant mortality in this State than in
any other. A good deal of the harm
was attributable to giving children
adulterated foods instead of pure cows’
milk. The long hours worked by
girls in shops and factories did not fit
them to become the mothers of healthy
children.
The following amendment, moved by
Mrs. Butler, and seconded by Mrs.
Cort, was put and carried:
That this Conference ask the
Government to administer, in the
shape of an Act, the resolution af-
firmed at the Bunbury Conference
in regard to the endowment of
motherhood, viz.—The principle of
State endowment of motherhood, in
the direction of providing nursing,
surgical and medical attendance in
the home, also a weekly allowance
where necessary for a reasonable
period before and after the birth of
the child.
CARE OF LUNATICS.
That the Government be asked
to erect a ward at the Claremont
Asylum to provide proper care and
expert supervision over suspected
temporary insane persons.
Mrs. Waddell urged that proper pro-
vision be made for such cases, and
instanced a person in Fremantle who
had been improperly treated.
The motion was carried, with the ad-
dition of the following addendum, mov-
ed by Mrs. Neil:


That seeing that it is bad for
young children to he in the company
of grown-up lunatics, the State be
asked to erect a small cottage for
mentally afflicted children.
SIXTH DAY’S SITTING.
The Conference opened at 10.30
a.m.
FIELD TRAINING FOR GIRLS.
Mrs. Butler moved, on behalf of
Subiaco, in favor of compulsory train-
ing in field nursing for girls. She
thought that a system of training for
girls was necessary, to work in with
the hoys’ defence scheme.
Mrs. Finney seconded.
Mrs. Mellows thought the scheme
ought to he included in the school cur-
riculum.
Mrs. Stuart was against all militar-
ism, but favored field training for in-
dustrial cases.
Mrs. Holman said that the attempt
to start a girl scouts’ movement had
been a failure.
The motion was lost.
BOOTS FOR CADETS.
Mrs. Finney moved, on behalf of the
Eastern Goldfields Labor League;
That the Conference should urge
the Federal Government to supply
the cadet boys with one pair of boots
every year.
Mrs. O’Brien moved an amendment
that two pairs a year be provided and
that the leather be right side out.
The amendment was lost, and the
motion carried.
CO-OPERATION.
Mrs. Butler (Geraldton) moved the
following motions;
(1) That this meeting requests
the Government to open grocery
stores in all the leading towns of
W.A. on the co-operative principle,
and provide all commodities and
labor.
(2) That Conference considers that
the time has arrived for the State
Government to enter into the dis-
tribution of household commodities
on a mutual or co-operative basis.
The people in the country had to pay
a very heavy freight on the goods sent
to them, and the time had arrived
when the Government should bring
forward some scheme for the distribu-
tion of commodities.
Mrs. Giles seconded.
Mrs. Mazzaletti said that a co-ope-
rative scheme such as that proposed
would be of great benefit to the people
of Denmark.
Mrs. Dobson said that buying and
selling by the State did not consti-
tute co-operation. The motion was
withdrawn in favor of the following
motion by Mrs. Dobson:
That this Conference urges upon
the women to unite in forming co-
operative stores throughout the
State.
Mrs. Butler seconded.
Mrs. Cort referred to the heavy
freights charged on the Midland
line. Co-operative stores would lower
the cost of living.
The motion was carried unanimous-
ly.
TREATMENT OF SCHOOL
CHILDREN.
Mrs. Mazzoletti moved the follow-
ing resolutions on behalf of the Den-
mark branch: —
That this Conference favors free


dentistry in State schools.
That children attending State
schools, and who when medically ex-
amined are found to be suffering
from some ailment, should receive
the necessary remedial treatment
free of cost to the parents.
Mrs. Hoffman seconded.
Miss Jennings thought that the mo-
tion should apply to all schools, and
the motion with this addendum was
carried.
HOSPITAL MATTERS.
Mrs. Hoffman moved:
That the visiting days be extended
to three per week at all public hos-
pitals, as the present provision
causes much crowding and inconve-
nience.
r*J
The mover said that in Kalgoorlie
the visiting days had been reduced
from three to two.
Mrs. Collett seconded, and said that
visitors from the country should be
allowed to visit patients as soon as
possible.
Mrs. Stuart opposed the motion, on
the ground that too many visits were
trying to the patients.
Mrs. Holman took the same view, as
a member of the Perth Hospital
Board. Every time the question had
cropped up on the board the doctors
had objected.
Eventually the motion was deleted
in favor of the following resolution by
the Kalgoorlie Women’s Club; —
That the secretaries and matrons
of all hospitals and sanatoriums
should be strictly enjoined to show
the utmost consideration to their
patients, especially in connection
with matters of finance, and with
the visits of near relations from
distant parts.
The motion was carried.
MEETING OF CONFERENCE.
Mrs. Needham (Northam) moved;—
That Conference meet triennially.
An amendment by Mrs. Wheeler,
seconded by Mrs. Stuart, “That Con-
ference meet every two years,” was
• carried. A further amendment, mov-
ed by Mesdames Weare and Kenneally,
in favor of an annual meeting, was
lost.
WOMAN ORGANISER.
Mrs. Needham moved:—
That a woman organiser be ap-
pointed by the State Executive at the
earliest opportunity.
She emphasised the need of an or-
ganiser, especially in the country
districts.
The following motion was consider-
ed at the same time;—
That is is advisable to have a
Labor medal struck on similar lines
to that worn by the N.S.W. Laborites,
the net proceeds to be devoted to
propaganda work.
Mrs. Kenneally seconded the joint
motion, and spoke strongly in favor of
the proposed medal. They would
like to have to show that they belonged
to the party.
Mrs. Gilbert emphasised the import-
ance of having a woman organiser for
the country districts.
Mrs. Pope supported the motion.
Mrs. Rapley opposed the motion, on
the ground that Labor women had
always been willing to work gratuit-
ously. She moved as an amend-
ment:—
That propaganda committees be
formed, and balloted for by leagues
and unions, and that all the cost be
borne by the State Executive,
Mrs .Butler seconded the amend-
ment, which was lost. The 1 joint mo-
tions were carried unanimously.
Conference then adjourned for
lunch, re-assembling at 2 p.m.
BARMAIDS.
Mrs. Cort moved item 62 on behalf
of the Barmaids and Barmen’s Union: .
That this Conference urges upon
the Government the absolute neces


sity of amending the Licensing Act
so as to allow the registration of
barmaids in the interests of every-
body concerned in the liquor indus-
try.
Also item 63, proposed by the Kal-
goorlie Women’s branch:
That congress urges the Govern-
ment not to employ barmaids in
State Hotels.
She thought there were quite sufficient
barmaids now in the industry, and
said that the barmaids were used
against the 'barmen.
Mrs. Ruffy Hill seconded. Women
had to put up with many insults be-
hind the bar, which was not a proper
place for women.
Mrs. Baker did not hold with turn-
ing out those women who were now
making their living in this way.
Mrs. Butler said that no women had
been employed in the State hotel up
to date.
Mrs. Stuart did not agree with regis-
tration at all.
Mrs. Holman said that all the bar-
maids she knew were opposed to re-
gistration. Some of them had fami-
lies to keep.
The motions were carried.
DISLOYALTY.
Mrs. Needham moved items 17 and
20, on 'behalf of the Northam branch—
That the Constitution of the W.A.
Labor Federation be effectively
amended to prevent the violation of
principles, and the disloyalty of in-
dividual members to our humane
movement by a pledge from all its
units.
That no unionist be allowed to
affiliate, or to remain affiliated with
the A.L.F. after disloyalty to the
Labor movement has been proved.
Mrs. Gilbert, in seconding, said there
had been instances of disloyalty in
Northam.
Mrs. Kenneally said they had also
had experiences in Sydney. They
should be able to put the traitors out.
Mrs. Stuart supported, but asked
that the term “disloyalty” be de-
fined. The Metropolitan Council had
censured the workers’ representative
on the Arbitration Court for concur-
ring in an award which imposed sweat-
ing conditions on the restaurant em-
ployees. In Parliament Mr. Scad-
dan, when asked whether the Govern-
ment could interfere in that award,
gave the legal opinion, and the words
that he might have spoken were left
unsaid.
Mrs. Lewis said that what one called
disloyalty another didn’t. Was a
man who acted differently to what his
fellows thought was right to be de-
barred from joining a union again?
The motions were lost.
POLITICAL LITERATURE.
Mrs. Gilbert (Northam) moved:—
That all persons be especially urg-
ed to study Socialism by lectures,
literature, etc., whenever the oppor-
tunity presents itself.
Mrs. Needham seconded.
Mrs. Green moved an amendment:
That this Conference congratu-
lates the State Executive on its re-
cent purchase of literature, and
urges it to take further steps in the
direction, as the education of the
people on these lines is the next step
in our movement.
After some discussion it was de-
cided to hold over the items till the
literature had been examined.
PROTECTION OF ABORIGINES.
Mrs. Green moved the following mo-
tions:—
(1) That this Conference considers
it very necessary that a female in-
spector should 'be appointed to in-
spect the native women in the Nor’-
West.
(2) That this first Labor Women’s
Conference considers the system of
indentured native labor at present
in vogue in this State is practically
slavery, and urges that for the well-
being of our own race, and to in-
sure peace and happiness to the
remnant of our country’s aborigines,
native labor should be totally abol-
ished, and suitable reserves set aside
where the natives will be completely
segregated, and allowed to live their
own lives.
(3) That the Government be asked
to prohibit employment of aborigines
of both sexes on stations, as the
conditions under which they work
are detrimental to the interests of
the white woman, and that the
Government be asked to set aside


areas as reserves whereby the na-
tives may work for themselves.
She considered that segregation was
very necessary to secure racial purity.
The natives in Kimberly were a men-
ace, as they were in a very diseased
condition. She contended that the
people who took over a territory
should administer it in the interests
of the natives, as well as in their
own interests. In Kimberley the lot
of the natives was simply slavery. It
was a great country, and if more
white labor were introduced it would
be better developed. The increased
cost of labor would mean that the pas-
toralists would either have to develop
his holding or sub-divide it. There
would never be many white men in
the Nor’-West all the time the coun-
try was in so few hands. The native
women of the Nor’-West practised in-
toralists would either have to develop
the white man came by reason of
poor food and other causes. If the
native women were segregated there
would be a great exodus of white men
southwards to get married. Moola-
boola station was supposed to be for
the natives, but it was only a cattle
station.
Mrs. Waddell seconded. If the 2500
natives in the Nor’-West were placed
in reserves they could be made to do
some reproductive work.
Mrs. Thomas said there had already
been a deputation to the Colonial
Secretary. The only way was to
keep on agitating.
The motions were carried unain-
mously.
THE LICENSING ACT.
Mrs. Murphy (Donnybrook Women’s
A.L.F.) moved:
That the Licensing Act be amend-
ed to the effect that it should be
illegal to sell wine or other intoxi-
cating drinks at shops where fruit
and confectionery are sold.
The delegate said that young girls
went into fruit shops for wine, when
they would not go to a wine shop.
Mrs. Kenneally seconded.
Mrs. Gilbert and Mrs. Austin sup-
ported the motion.
Miss O’Grady said that these shops
were sometimes very convenient. She
did not think a wine shop was a very
bad place.
Mrs. Grebh said that if the motion
were passed the men would have a
monopoly of the hotels.
The motion was carried.
Mrs. Murphy moved:
That the Licensing Act be amend-
ed to the effect that an unmarried
woman be eligible to hold a publi-
can’s general license.
Mrs. Austin seconded.
Mrs. Thomas opposed. Equality
for the sexes was not always good.
The motion was carried by 25 to 19.
Mrs. Doherty (Bunbury) moved:
That the Licensing Act should be
amended to the effect that the Early
Closing Act as applied to grocers
should also be made to apply to
hotelkeepers.
Mrs. Thomas seconded.
Mrs. Needham moved an amend-
ment that all hotels be closed at nine
o’clock.
Mrs. Rapley seconded the amend-
ment, which was lost. *
Mrs. Dodd moved a further amend-
ment that the Licensing Act be en-
forced more strictly to ensure the
closing of all public and private bars
precisely at 11 o’clock.
The amendment was carried.
Mrs. Collett moved a further amend-
ment that on the goldfields the hour
of closing should be twelve. She de-
clared that the people on the coast
did not realise the conditions under
which the goldfields people lived.
Mrs. Stuart seconded the amend-
ment, which was lost by a large ma-
jority.
The motion by Mrs. Dodd was thep
carried.
POLICE AND INEBRIATES.
Mrs. Doherty moved:
That this branch is of opinion
that the police are allowed too much
latitude in regard to the ill-treat-
ment meted out to intoxicated per-
sons while in their charge.
Mrs. Thomas seconded.
Mrs. Kennealley thought that men
were often taken to the police station
when they might be sent to their
homes.
Mrs. Collett spoke against the mo-
tion, and Mesdames Austin and
O’Brien in favor.


Mrs. Butler thought the Inebriates
Bill would cope with the difficulty.
The motio was carried.
HOSPITAL PROBATIONERS.
Mrs. Jordan (Kalgoorlie) moved —
That the hours of hospital pro-
bationers should be reduced from
twelve hours per day to eight.
She contended that eight hours were
quite sufficient for such tiring work.
Mrs. Hoffman seconded.
Mrs. Stuart moved an amendment:
“That nurses themselves decide by
ballot.” If the hours were shortened
the time on probation would be leng-
thened.
The amendment lapsed, and the
motion was carried.
CHILDREN’S SPORTS.
Mrs. Hoffman moved on behalf of
Kalgoorlie Women’s Club:
That some reasonable restriction
should be placed upon the constant
call for the attendance of our youths
and children at public sports.
The children went in for too many
sports at the schools, and on account
of late hours did not get sufficient
rest.
Mrs. Jordan seconded.
Mrs. Cort said that surely they were
not going to ask the State to look
after their children.
The motion was lost.
UNCONTROLLABLE CHILDREN.
Mrs. Hoffman (Kalgoorlie) moved—
That in all cases of uncontrollable
children brought before the courts,
leniency should be shown towards
first offenders, as well as a kind
consideration for parents (especial-
ly in cases of widows) who often
feel the judicial separation as a
worse bereavement even than death
itself, because of the measure of dis-
grace that attaches to it, although
they have done their best.
Mrs. Hoffman said that when a father-
less child was brought before the
court it was sent away. It seemed to
be a crime to be without a father.
Mrs. Jordan seconded, but Mrs. Col-
lett opposed.
Mrs. Griffin said she had known
cases where boys were given no
chance but were sent to the schools.
Something ought to be done to pre-
vent boys being branded as criminals.
Mrs. Ruffy Hill contended that the
children were sympathetically treated
at the Children’s Courts.
The motion was carried.
Conference then adjourned.
SEVENTH DAY.
Conference met at 2 p.rii. on October
29th.
SUSPECTED LUNATICS.
A letter was read from the Hon.
Minister (Mr. Angwin) with reference
to the ward for suspected insane per-
sons.
Mrs. Stuart moved: —“That the
Mr. Angwin expressing the desire of
secretary be instructed to write to
Conference that the wards for sus-
pected insane persons be placed un-
der a lunacy expert.”
Mrs. Waddell seconded.
The motion was carried.
POLITICAL LITERATURE.
Mrs. Gilbert’s motion urging the
study of Socialistic literature was
then further considered, together with
the amendment moved by Mrs. Green.
After some discussion the amend-
ment was defeated, and Mrs. Stuart
moved a further amendment:
That the literature purchased by
the Executive be confined to the
referenda proposals, and the planks
of the Labor Party.
They should aim at establishing an
Australian Socialistic Commonwealth,
and to get the referenda was the first
step.
Mrs. Dodd seconded the amendment,
which was carried.
STATE CHILDREN’S COUNCIL.
Mrs. Mellows moved:
That this Conference favors the
formation of a State Children’s
Council formed on the same lines
as the one in S.A., to be worked in
conjunction with the State Children’s
Department.
In South Australia there was a coun-
cil appointed by the Government, which
saw that suitable homes were selected


for the children, and provision was
made for the orphanages. Cases went
before the council instead of before
the 1 Children’s Court.
Mrs. Callaghan esconded.
Mrs. Butler supported, and said that
in South Australia the council had to
select the neighborhood in which the
child was to be placed.
Mrs. Stuart favored a council elected
by adult suffrage.
The President supported an elective
council, and said that Mr. Scaddan was
in favor of the idea.
Mrs. Mellows altered her motion to
read:—
That this Conference considers it
advisable to have a State Children’s
elective council, to be worked in con-
junction with the State Children’s
Department.
The motion was carried.
DAY LABOR IN BAKERIES.
Permission was givenu to Mr. Stent,
president of the Bakers’ Union, to ad-
dress the conference in support of day
labor in bakeries. He declared that
the continued night work was very
unhealthy, and the proposed change
would not cause any inconvenience.
Mrs. Cort then moved;—
That the delegates to Conference
should support the day work system
by every means in their power.
Mrs. Butler seconded the motion,
which was carried unanimously.
Mr. Stent thanked the delegates for
their sympathy, and wished them every
success,
STATE GOVERNORS.
Mrs. Stuart moved;
That this first Labor Women’s
Conference urges the Government to
immediately take steps with the view
of putting into effect the 10th plank
of the general platform of the State
Labor Party, viz., the abolition of
the present system of State Gover-
nors, and Government House, the
office to be filled by the Chief Jus-
tice; the money thus saved to 'be
ear-marked for the establishment of
maternity homes.
It cost £7IOO per year for the up-
keep of the Governor, yet when the Go-
was appointed they
were promised that it would mean
economy in legislation. The Labor
Government should immediately peti-
tion the Home Office that upon the ter-
mination of the present Governor’s
term they did not want any more.
Mrs. Holman seconded, and Mrs.
Lewis supported.
Mrs. Cort moved an amendment to
delete all words after “Chief Justice.”
Mrs. Lewis seconded the amendment,
which was carried.
The resolution, as amended, was
carried.
REBATES OP TAXATION.
Mrs. Needham (Northam) moved;
That the Commonwealth and
State Parliaments be asked to con-
sider the advisability of instituting
a system of rebates of taxation on
householders, according to size of
families, thereby giving the heads of
large families a more equal chance.
Mrs. Dodd seconded.
Mrs. Green pointed out that pro-
vision was already being made by the
State Government in the direction in-
dicated.
The motion was carried.
EIGHT HOURS IN THE HOME.
Mrs. Needham moved that item 81
standing in the name of the Northam
branch: —
That women systematically con-
fine their household duties to eight
hous per day.
be deleted. She explained that it
was only proposed by way of a joke.
The motion was carried.
PROTECTION OF SEAMEN.
Mrs. Waddell (Fremantle) moved;
That this Conference urge the
Federal authorities to approach the
British Board of Trade with the
object of having a clause inserted
dealing with runners.
Mrs. Waddell referred to the run-
ners on the ship Hilston, who were
sent to goal for eight weeks because
they refused to work while the vessel
was in port. She complained that
the magistrate did not understand sea-
going customs.
Mrs. Lewin seconded.
The motion was carried.


CONGESTED HABITATIONS.
Mrs. Giles (Geraldton) moved:
That the Government be urged to
introduce legislation to provide for
at least one-sixth of an acre for
every house.
She said that in Geraldton there
were as many as six houses built on
a quarter of an acre of ground.
Mrs. Butler, in seconding, said that
during her recent visit to Geraldton
she was horrified at the crowded habi-
tations she saw, the evil being worst
in the Chinese quarter.
Mrs. Dodd moved an amendment:
That the Government be urged
to introduce legislation that in fu-
ture not less than a quarter acre,
with 50 ft. frontage, be a block, and
that all warehouses and factories of
more than four stories be prohibited.
Mrs. Rapley seconded the amend-
ment, which was carried.
DEPUTATIONS TO MINISTERS.
It was resolved that all ques-
tions that were decided upon
by a majority of the Conference
be grouped and brought under the no-
tice of the responsible Ministers.
Mrs. Mazzoletti read a letter receiv-
ed by the settlers of Denmark from
the Government, and it was decided
that the matter be one of those brought
under the notice of the Government.
ADDITIONAL BUSINESS.
Conference having completed • the
agenda paper, proceeded to discuss
various motions of which notice had
been given.
OLD AGE PENSIONS.
Mrs. Stuart moved;—
That Conference asks the Federal
Parliament to take into consideration
the conditions and costs of living in
administering the old-age and in-
valid pensions, and where conditions
demand it, to increase the minimum.
She contended that owing to the in-
crease in the cost of living, the pen-
sions were not sufficient for Western
Australia.
Mrs. Collett seconded.
The motion was carried.
APPOINTMENT OF OFFICIALS.
Mrs. Stuart moved;
Then in the opinion of confer-
ence the State and Federal Govern-
ments be requested, all other things
being equal, to appoint to the State
and Federal services Laborites, in
order that Labor legislation may in
the future be sympathetically ad-
ministered.
She claimed that Labor legislation
could not be sympathetically adminis-
tered through an official who was anxi-
ous to make Labor administration a
failure.
Mrs. Rapley seconded.
Mrs. Butler opposed, and said the
motion meant class legislation.
The motion was lost.
THE REFERENDA.
Mrs. Ruffy Hill moved;
That this Conference congratu-
lates the Federal Government upon
its action in again introducing the
referenda proposals, thereby giving
the people an opportunity of saying

to live in comfort and happiness
shall cease to exist.
Mrs. Collett seconded the motion,
which was carried unanimously.

Mrs. Nicholls moved;
That this Conference advocate the
necessity of placing a tax on bache-
lors.
The delegates contended that a
reasonable tax on bachelors might
bring them to a sense of their re-
sponsibilities. It would help pay the
maternity bonus.
Mrs. Clarson seconded the motion,
which was put and lost.
GREETINGS PROM MRS. SCADDAN.
Mrs. Johnston said that a telephone
message had been received from Mrs.
Soaddan, conveying her greetings and

solved that Mrs. Scaddan’s greetings

work for men and women, and to

MENT.

for the worker as the present one.
