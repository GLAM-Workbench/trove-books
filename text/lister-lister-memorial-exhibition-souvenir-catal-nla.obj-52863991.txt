WILLIAM LISTER LISTER* son of John Armitage Lister (who arrived
at Sydney in 1854), was born at Manly, 27th December, 1859, in 1868
the family returned to England, and William went to Bedford School, where
he came under the influence of a Hr. Rudge, one of the masters, who was
a water colourist of the Birket-Foster type. Here, too, Lister came into
contact with a family of boys named Frazer, all of whom subsequently
made their mark as artists, and together they formed the “ Cudgel Club/’
as a member of which Lister first started to sketch and paint. Leaving
Bedford, he completed his education at Pont St. Maxence, France, sending
most of his work done there to dealers in London. In 1876, at the age
of 17, he exhibited three watercolours at the Royal Scottish Academy.
As his parents were not in favour of painting as a means of livelihood,
Lister took a course at the Fairfield Engineering Works, and studied
mechanical engineering at the College of Science and Mechanics, Glasgow.
During this period he joined the St. Mungo Art Club as its youngest
member. After four years at Glasgow he went to sea, visiting the Levant,
West Indies, and America, becoming Chief Engineer at 25.
Returning to Sydney in 1888, he joined the Art (now Royal Art)
Society of New South Wales, being elected Vice-President in 1894, and
President in 1897, which latter position he held until his retirement in


194 L He was appointed a trustee of the National Art Gallery,, of New
Sooth Wales in 1899, and was elected Vice-President in 1919, retaining
office until his death.
Lister was awarded the Wynne Prize in 1898 for 44 The Last Gleam 95 ;
in, 1906 for “ The Golden Splendour of the Bosh ” (later bought by public
subscription and presented to the National Gallery) ; in 1910 for 45 Mid
Song of Bird and Insects Murmuring ” ; in 1912 for 44 Sydney Harbour ” ;
in 1913 for 4< Federal Capital Site ” (which also won the Commonwealth
Government's prize of £250, and was subsequently purchased by the
Government); in 1917 for 44 The Wind Swept Marshlands ” ; and in
1925 for 44 A Track th rough the Bush.’ 4
Besides running a successful one-man show for over twenty years,
he exhibited with the Royal E mpire Society of Artists, the Royal Society
of Painters in Oils, the Royal Society of British Artists, London, and was
an honorary member of the Royal Cambrian Academy, Wales. He is
represented in the Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, Hobart, Geelong,
Wellington and Cardiff Galleries, the Mitchell Library, and in many private
collections throughout the Empire and America.
He died at Sydney, as the result of an accident, 6th November, 1943.
