Commercial Travellers' Association

OF VICTORIA.
1899 .
MELBOURNE, JUNE, 1899.
INCEPTION.
All the fabulists of all the ages are
never tired of telling us how from
“acorns small great oaks arise.”
The particular acorn which has
developed into the C.T.A. of Victoria
was insignificant enough as far as
mere size goes; but if its contem-
poraries could have divined the
potentialities of growth concentrated
within its small compass, they would
have considered it a very remarkable
acorn indeed.
So far as is known, the idea of a
C.T.A. for Victoria was first mooted
by Mr. W. Bell Jackson, now a well-
known Melbourne merchant. Only
later on, however, was a definite
scheme evolved.
It was nearly nineteen years ago,
in the latter half of 1880. One
winter night four travellers met
casually in the commercial room of a
small Coleraine hostelry. Under the
thawing influences of a blazing log
fire and a friendly pipe, the innate
comradeship of the craft asserted
itself. It was agreed with enthusiasm
that the lack of cohesion and
generally chaotic tendencies of the
Victorian travelling man had got to
end right there. There was no
adjournment either of the meeting or
of the effort. Two of the four
present resolved to act, and the other
pair agreed to pay • half of all
incidental expenses.
Not many weeks had elapsed when
a written circular was addressed to
several of the oldest and most respec-
ted men of the road, soliciting the
use of their names as promoters of a
proposed Commercial Travellers’
Society. The ground proved stony,
and the replies were few and far
between.
Our four organisers, however, were
of the true pioneer breed, and were
in no way daunted by this first rebuff.
Almost immediately they came up
smiling with the first printed circular.
This production was headed,
“Proposed Commercial Travellers’
Club.” It gave a summary sketch of
the ideas actuating its authors, and
concluded with a form for signature
to the effect that “I agree to join the
Commercial Travellers’ Club, pro-
vided I approve of the Articles of
Association.” It was posted to all
known travelling men, and a month
was allowed for the seed to take a
hold, and for the forms to be
returned.
The promoters had a liberal share
of the sanguine temperament, lacking
which no pioneer’s moral outfit is
complete; but, in this instance, the
paltry realisation of their great ex-
pectations must have been dispiriting
indeed. The whole month of waiting
resulted in only about a dozen
replies. It looked as if the movement
would have to be shelved as an abject
failure, but one great, final, desperate
effort was decided upon.
On December Ist, 1880, the morn-
ing papers were liberally sprinkled
with the announcement of a meeting
of C.T.’s to be held that night at the
Duke of Rothsay Hotel. In the
“Wanted” column appeared the
cryptic injunction—“C.T. call Duke
of R. See advt. under Meetings.”
Other messages of a similar import
lurked insidiously in the heart of
“Missing Friends,” and so on, ad in-
finitum, as far as the not too gorgeous
funds available would permit.
This meeting proved the turning
point. It furnished at once the
force that galvanised the body of
travelling men into active life, the
P. P. BRESNAN.

lever of Archimedes that overcame
its resistant inertia, the foundation of
its prosperity, and the pivot around
which the affairs of its Association
have ever since successfully revolved.
Over forty travellers mustered, and
a variegated assortment they proved
to be. Some were pugnacious, some
came as scoffers, and others merely
to satisfy their curiosity.
One seasoned veteran, so the
legend runs, got on his hind legs
and wanted to know what these
“young fellows” were presuming
“ to be about to be going to do,”
why the meeting had been called
together, and, in short, why was this
thus generally. One of the promoters
rose to the occasion with: “Gentle-
men, we are here to-day to
endeavour to meet an acknowledged
want. We are all agreed that a
society, properly constituted, would
be to our mutual benefit. I
see in this room travellers old
enough to be my father —men
who have travelled almost as many
years as I have lived—and yet you
want to know from me what we are
to do. Why, gentlemen, the whole
thing is in a nutshell. I beg to move
that the gentlemen here present
constitute the Commercial Travellers’
Association of Victoria, and that all
future applicants be admitted by
ballot; let us here appoint a president,
a committee, a treasurer, and a
secretary ; let the committee prepare
rules, and submit them for the
approval of the general body, to be
called together as soon as the rules
are ready; and before I sit down I
have much pleasure in proposing Mr.
P. P. Bresnan as the first president.”
The above resolutions were all

carried, and as a proof of bond fides ,
those present were asked to deposit a
guinea entrance fee. About thirty
guineas were thrown upon the table,
and “our at one time depressed pro-
moters,” jubilates the chronicler,
“ left the room that day as proud as
emperors, and the Association was
launched on a flood tide, her
bowsprit pointing straight towards
fortune.” The first Vice-President
was Mr. David Irvine; the first
Treasurer, Mr. J. F. Flockart; the
first Secretary, Mr. G. F. Griffiths;
and these gentlemen may be regarded
as practically the founders of the
Association.
The world moved swiftly even in those
days, and the newly-fledged officers
were not slow in trying their wings.
Exactly three days after the great
meeting above recorded—that is, on
January 3rd, 1881—they took their
first Club-room (which proved to be
most cosy quarters) in Phair’s Hotel,
Collins-street. In that small, unpre-
tentious room much of the best work,
much of the most lasting work in the
annals of the Association, first took
shape and form. If it was the
meeting at the Duke of Rothsay that
supplied the yeast, it was the quiet,
steady work at Phair’s that made the
good bread. The rules then adopted
—after most careful consideration —
have served, save for the revision
natural to so extended a period,
not only for fair weather, but for foul,
and to this day they remain essentially
intact.
Among other matters, the promoters
decided that they would accept of
no subscriptions from any outside
source until the Society had proved
itself self-supporting and independent;
then if the well-disposed chose to
subscribe to the Relief and Scholar-
ship Funds, so much the better. This
decision was stoutly adhered to, and,
as a matter of fact, several very liberal
offers of pecuniary aid were politely
refused, the promoters notifying that
they would call for such voluntary
subscriptions only when the Associa-
tion was fairly standing on its own
feet.
Another important decision arrived
at was to the effect that the Associa-
tion should be composed of, and
should be officered and governed by,
commercial travellers only.
EARLY YEARS.
Towards the end of ’B3, the lusty
young Association began to suffer
badly from growing pains. The cry
for more room” became a general
and a clamorous one. On Novem-
ber 3rd of that year, rooms were
secured at Carton’s Hotel. The
sojourn there, however, was a short
one, and in August, ’B4, the Com-
mittee leased a suite of rooms at the
Duke of Rothsay Hotel. Five
hundred pounds was voted for
furnishing purposes.
Two of the Furnishing Committee,
however, lacking the seasoned caution
of their successors, and fired with a
strenuous determination to “ lick
creation,” overdrew the amount pro-
vided, an enormity which so stirred
the indignation of one choleric and
matter-of-fact member, that when
accounts came in to the amount of
£ 620, he sternly refused to have
anything to do with it. The bulk of
the members, however, and the
General Committee, were either more
soft-hearted or more susceptible to
aesthetic influences, for they passed
all the accounts without so much as
censuring the ambitious “ young
lions,” whose excess of zeal was
responsible for the O/D.


The Club as now constituted
became an exceedingly popular
institution, and members accrued so
rapidly that it was not long before the
Association found the necessity for
still further expansion. The matter
was gone into with characteristic
energy. A sub-committee secured
the offer of a lease of a fine block of
ground adjoining the Duke of
Rothsay, and empowered an architect
to prepare the plans of what would
have proved a really handsome edifice.
Tenants to occupy the ground floor
were secured, estimates for furnishing
were obtained, and a complete
scheme was submitted to the General
Committee. Prudence carried the
day, however. The first year’s
outlay involved under the new
scheme would have figured out some-
thing like two thousand pounds, and
the more cautious committeemen
thought this too large an order
altogether.
All things considered, they can
hardly be accused of faint-heartedness,
and it would be cruel to confound an
acute sense of personal responsibility
with a spirit of timidity. All the
same, it turned out that the forward
policy would have been the correct
thing, and the enhancement in value
of the Association’s lease would
have proved a very handsome nest-
egg if they had cared to turn it into
hard cash.
How firmly the more enterprising
and far-sighted members were seized
of the necessity for erecting a Club
House on the modern plan can be
seen as far back as ’B2. In the
Annual Report (the Second), date
November 30th of that year, occur
these remarks :
“ The matter of a Commercial Tra-
vellers’ Club has been constantly brought
before your Committee, and it is their
hope that before very long they will have
such a building in the city of Melbourne
as will not only be an ornament to the
city, but also an immense benefit to all
those connected with it.
“ It may be said by some that there is
plenty of accommodation for commercial
men in Melbourne, and it may also be
argued that they are scarcely in town
often enough to be able to take advantage
of its benefits; but those who know from
experience the kind of life that all
travellers are forced to lead when away on
their journeys must know that they
require a place when they return to
Melbourne on their short spells between
seasons, &c., offering all the advantages
of an hotel, but still of a quieter nature,
and more likely to take the form of a
homely lounge or quiet retreat, and yet
not without a little amusement at command.
“ Your Committee have confidence in
stating that this idea, if properly carried
out, would prove to be an immense
success, and from the very large number
of mercantile men who have from time to
time expressed themselves ready to co-
operate by becoming members of the Club,
it is felt that to delay at this juncture
would be throwing away a golden oppor-
tunity.”
These words were written seventeen
years ago. It was written in the
Book of Fate that the ideas of 1882
should have to wait until 1899 for
their full and complete fruition;
meanwhile, all honour to the far-
seeing members who at once epito-
mised the present needs of their
fellow-travelling men, pierced the
mists of futurity, and furnished an
ideal which the Association, struggling
towards it ever since, has finally
succeeded in reducing to a reality.
(During both ’B2 and ’B3 Mr. J. W.
Groves was President.)
At the close of the year ’B3 the
members’ roll numbered 159; in
November, ’B4, under the presidency
of Mr. I. S. Holtz, it stood at 225 (the
latter in addition to a Club members’
roll of ’88). The increase was
neither erratic nor sensational, but
steady and consistent.
In 1881 the roll stood at 98
„ 1882 „ „ 131
„ 1883 „ „ 159
~ 1884 „ „ 224
While giving every credit to the
determined exertions of the travelling
men themselves, let us not forget, in
explaining the successes of those
early days, the noble way in which
many of the most prominent men in
Melbourne Commerce bore their
share in putting the young Association
on its feet. At the annual dinner in
’B2, the late Mr. W. K. Thomson,
of Messrs. Jas. M'Ewan and Co.,
occupied the chair, and drove home
the claims of the C.T.’s of Victoria
with such force and conviction that
over £l2OO was promised there and

then, the list of donors being headed
by:—
Messrs. Sargood, Butler and Nichol,
Messrs. Paterson, Laing and Bruce,
Messrs. Wm. Peterson and Co.,
;£IOO.
The (then) Hon. Ft T. Sargood
carried his generosity still further, and
offered, on condition that the travel-
lers collected to donate
another to their funds. Mr.
W. K. Thomson followed suit, and
Mr. J. M. Bruce also promised that
if further assistance were required to
complete the amount required, he
would give a second donation.
Fired by such a generous challenge,
Mr. G. F. Griffiths, the indefatigable
Secretary of those days, pledged him-
self to collect the necessary sum in
order to entitle the Association to the
extra £ 2OO, at the same time appeal-
ing to members for their hearty
co-operation in the task. The result
was a characteristic one. Not only
was the desiderated gathered
in, but more than besides, the
whole being placed on deposit at the
Commercial Bank. This happy con-
clusion was largely due to Mr. Wm.
Vint (Messrs. Jonathan Vint and Sons)
and Mr. R. Anquetil (Messrs. Luke,
Williams and Co.), who, when there
occurred a short but rather discon-
certing lull in the collecting, gallantly
came to the rescue—Mr. Vint with a
second donation of 50 guineas, and
Mr. Anquetil with from his firm
and from himself. It was in
this year (1884) that theannual cricket
match was inaugurated. Mr. Anquetil
was the prime mover, and at the open-
ing match his firm (Messrs. Luke, Wil-
liams and Co.) entertained the Asso-
ciation in the most elaborate style.
In this year the Committee were in
considerable tribulation as to the
state of hotel accommodation through-
out the country. From the first the
Association had addressed itself
vigorously to bringing about most
necessary reforms in this connection.
A standard had been fixed, with the
intention of according patronage only
to those hotelkeepers who lived up to
requirements. It would seem, how-
ever, that this scheme, though formu-

lated, was largely kept in abeyance,
for in ’B4 we find the Committee re-
gretting the fact that they have to
report that Boniface is still largely
in a recalcitrant mood, and that the
accommodation provided by him, or
supposed to be provided, has not
improved to the extent anticipated;
and metaphorically recommending
their successors to put their feet down
hard, and insist that a suitable stan-
dard be fixed, and that all houses fur-
nishing proper accommodation be
placed on the list, no hotel to be
named unless considered up to the
mark.
THE BOOM PERIOD.
1885 to 1889.
These were the years of inflation—
the years when business was replaced
by speculation, and enterprise by a
foolhardy recklessness; the years
when the wild-cat was abroad masque-
rading as the ordinary, reliable do-
mestic tabby; the years when Vic-
torians sowed the wind, oblivious of
the crop of whirlwinds which they
were to reap for many a long, hungry
year afterwards. The Victorian
C.T.A. was by no means innocent of
the distinctive foibles of the time; on
the contrary, it embraced them with
zeal. Members cultivated the art of
believing that all is gold that glitters
with an assiduity equal to that dis-
played by the most sanguine boomster
of them all. The punishment came,
and the Association took it unflinch-
ingly; and, finally, it atoned for its
errors in the most adequate of all
possible ways —it survived. The
most marked feature of the period,
the idiosyncrasy which differentiates
it most cjearly from the other epochs
of the Association’s history, especially
from these latter years, is the extent
to which the Club dominates, over-
shadows, perhaps even saps, the more
legitimate activities of the Association.
The record of significant events in
the life of the Association is accord-
ingly rather meagre.
The life is there, the stream of
tendency still flows, but rather as an
undercurrent not to fbe deciphered,
much less appreciated, until the re-
action comes —until the bad times
set in, when once more it asserts it-
self, takes the upper hand, and
reduces the less essential to its
proper footing. In 1885 Mr. J.
Stennett was President, and it was
during this year that the present
secretary, Mr. Jas. Davies, was ap-
pointed to that position. During
April of this year new premises in
Collins-street, immediately above
the Argus Office, were taken, and
here three years of useful work and
comfortable club-life were put in.
In 1886 Mr. C. Forbes was Presi-
dent, being succeeded in 1887 by Mr.
C. L. Pridham. In April of the
latter year died Mr. P. P. Bresnan,
the first President of the Association,
and one of the worthiest men who
has ever filled such a position, either
with this Association or any other.
It was in 1887 also that much interest
was taken by members in the plans
of the new building then about to be
erected at the corner of Collins and
S wanston streets (afterwards occupied
in part by the Association). In May,
’B7, an application was made to the
then Minister of Lands for an allot-
ment of land at Murrumbeena to be
vested in the Association. The
application was refused, but shortly
afterwards an allotment at Oakleigh
was granted instead. In 1888 Mr.
R. M. Flockart occupied the Presi-
dent’s chair. His year was both
an arduous and successful one,
being specially distinguished by
the Association’s removal (in
May) into the new building in
Queen’s-walk, which it occupied
continuously from that date up to a
few weeks back. In 1889 Mr. J.
Saunders was President, and the
business knowledge and acumen he
displayed proved him to be eminently
fitted for the position. In the world
outside the rift in the lute was just
beginning to make itself visible ; the
boom, its gaudy colours commencing
to fade with a disconcerting abrupt-
ness, was tottering to its end.
Within the Association these outside
conditions were necessarily reflected,
but not yet to such an extertt as to
seriously clog the functions of the
Association, still full of vigorous
youthful life. The full force of the
reaction was not yet, but it was to
come. How it was met and con-
quered, let the history of the suc-
ceeding years disclose.


YEARS OF MATURITY.
I. S. HOLTZ.
President 1884.
1890.
In this year progress was less
marked than in the previous twelve
months, though no serious set-back
was experienced. • The total revenue
(for the year ending June 30th) was
a slight falling-off on the pre-
vious year. Thesensationalprosperity
of the boom period is now on the
wane, and the depression is beginning
to make itself felt. The shadow is
only the size of a man’s hand as yet,
however, and the worst that the Com-
mittee has to report is that during the
year the Association has only im-
proved its financial position to the
extent of The falling-off is in
the section of the Association’s opera-
tions that consists of the Club. The
dull state of trade struck here
at once, and heavily. A certain
standard of comfort had been pro-
vided, and was expected to be main-
tained. so that expenses were inclined
to be stubborn, and resist all attempts
at curtailment. The Club as a specu-
lation, shows a profit on the year of
nearly ; but as it has cost the
Association some for decorat-
ing this part of its premises, and
installing therein the electric light, the
net gain is trifling.
C. L. PRIDHAM.
President 1887.
The Members’ Roll shows a slight
falling-off, but this had been antici-
pated. Full members now number
224 and Club members 395, as against
227 and 416 respectively in the pre-
vious year; but the Committee exhort
members to be of good cheer, as there
are fully fifty new men waiting
to be enrolled. The sum of was
granted for relief during the year.
The social activities of the Associa-
tion were in full evidence. The
annual ball, held in August, 1890,
proved a success of enthusiasm, and
the Committee are convinced that
this function is now to be numbered
among the “ institutions” of the
C.T.A., and are the more emphatic
in their faith, seeing that this ball
has shown a profit of nearly
instead of the previously habitual
deficit. The Association property at
Oakleigh has been carefully attended
to; 105 trees, kindly donated by
the Conservator of Forests, have
been planted, and are doing well;
also the English grass sown the
previous season is growing in first-
rate style. Sir Henry Loch has left
Victoria, and Lord Hopetoun has
come in his stead. The noble Lord
has displayed the greatest readiness
to succeed Sir Henry as Patron of the
Association.
Mr. Daniel Rutter Long, an old
member and friend of the Associa-
tion, has handsomely donated
to the Relief Fund, and has been
made a Life Governor in consequence.
The death is recorded of Mr. W. D.
Cain, a well-known Full member and
intercolonial traveller. During the
year the President (Mr. Robert
Crawford) found it desirable to make
a business trip to the old country, and
a substitute being necessary, Mr.
John Saunders has been elected to
fill the breach, and has done it to
everyone’s satisfaction. Mr. Joseph
Hunter, one of the Trustees, has been
compelled by stress of work to resign,
and Mr. Richard Allen has been
appointed to the vacancy. Vice-
President James A. Martin has left
for England, and seeing that he was
a Foundation member, the Com-
mittee are concerned accordingly.
Mr. George Powell takes up Mr.
Martin’s role for the rest of the year.
Summing up the net result of the
year, the Committee regret that they
are unable to record the phenomenal
progress of the previous year, but
considering the troublous times that
faced them when theyassumed office,
they are content to abide the verdict
of their fellow-members.
1891.
This is the first year of storm and
stress. The “ depression,” which was
supposed—hoping against hope—to
be a mere passing buffet at the hands
of fate, has proved rather a series of
strokes from a bludgeon. The net
gain on the year’s transactions has
been only £6\ 4s. Bd., but the general
state of things outside absolves the
Committee from any need for
apology. It is in the Club that the
debacle has played most havoc, while
expenses as usual have been persistent.
To make things blacker, the great
strike has had its fatuous word to say,
and the fuel and gas account has
swollen inordinately. The Members’
Roll as regards Full Members is
stationary (228 against 227 of the
previous year), but at the Club Mem-
bers’ Roll the mailed fist of Depression
has struck heavily indeed, and it now
totals only 318 as against 395. Relief
to the amount of has been dis-
bursed. The social side of the
Association’s work has not been
allowed entirely to lapse, but ex-
periences have not been too encourag-
ing. The annual dinner (November,
1890) proved a dismal failure,
the attendance of members being
most dispiritingly meagre, and the
net result a heavy loss. The 1891
Ball, however, has been a moderate
success, with a small balance to the
good. The annual revision of the
Association Hotel List is now coming
to be recognised not as a mere form,
but as a tangible fact, and country
hotelkeepers are already showing an
anxious desire to be selected. The
crusade against the insanitary con-
dition of some of the hotels is being
prosecuted with energy, and the
Central Board of Health have been
approached with a request for assist-
ance in dealing with this abuse, so
inimical to the best interests not only
of C.T.’s, but of the travelling public
at large. Relations with the Railway
Department have been of a most
cordial character, the Commissioners
having paid the Association the
compliment of requesting a deputation
of its representatives for the discussion
of details of traffic management, &c.
The deaths of three Full members
occurred during the year—Messrs. R.
C. King W. Kerslake, and T. A.
Green—all three men in their prime,
and universally popular. During this
year the Club lost the services of Mr.
VV. H. Sandy, who had served it
faithfully for several years as house
steward. The general management
of the Association and of the Club is
now vested by the Committee in Mr.
James Davies, the Secretary. The
President for the year was Mr. C. J.
Charlwood (1890-91).
1892.
This has been the year of crashes,
smashes, and financial chaos. Every-
thing that has a basis into which
pecuniary considerations enter to even
the smallest extent —a swollen cata-
logue nowadays—has been tottering,
staggering, crumbling into its consti-
tuent dust. The C.T.A. has stood,
however, and it is with pardonable
pride that its Committee record that
the business of the past twelve
months (ending September 30th,
1892) has resulted in no loss more
serious than that consisting of the
depreciation of the Club furniture.
The balance-sheet, as submitted,
shows an apparent loss on the year’s
transactions of ,£385 7s. 2d. Of this
amount, however, all except
18s. 2d. (for depreciation of furniture)
should have been charged to the pre-
vious year. The Club section has
been hit very heavily. Its revenue for
the year shows a shrinkage of
7s. 7d. on the previous year.
The only method of meeting
such a serious falling-off in re-
ceipts, say the Committee, has been
to exercise the most strenuous
economy in expenditure. The brake
has been applied fairly drastically, so
that the expenses of carrying on the
Club were ,£447 less than the pre-

vious year, and those of the Associa-
tion less, showing a total saving
on the working of the institution of
,£529 for the year. The diningroom
was the most exasperating cross which
the Committee had to bear. It
showed a loss of £460 6s. 6 1. for the
twelve months, as against a loss of
on the previous year (after
charging the latter with the same
ratio of working expenses). Some
idea of the economy that the Com-
mittee effected may be gained from
the fact that in the actual takings
there was, as already noted, a falling-
off of £624. 19s. 1 id. The tenden-
cies disclosed by this state of affairs
were so ominous that the Committee
took the bull by the horns and closed
the diningroom altogether on Sep-
tember 10th, 1892. The omnipresent
depression is a knife that cuts and
slashes in all directions. The Asso-
ciation’s landlords have accordingly
agreed to a reduction in rent
from to per annum,
dating from October Ist, 1892.
President Powell, who is at the helm
during this anxious period, appeals
to members to bear in mind that they
are shareholders in an institution
which possesses trust funds aggregat-
ing £31 19 14s. id. invested for their
sole benefit, and that over and above
this they are owners of unincumbered
property worth £IBO6 gs. 5d., and of
five acres of valuable land at Oakleigh,

granted by the Government for the
erection thereon of homes for aged
members. The Members’ Roll shows
much the same tendencies as that of
the previous year. Full members are
stationary (230 against 228), but Club
members number only 262, against
the 318 of the previous year. During
the year death has claimed three Full
members —Messrs. Thomas Glancy (a
founder), T. Carlisle, and L. E. G.
Bright. The sum of ss. has
been disbursed for relief. A strong
stand has again been made over the
revision of the Hotel List, and hotel-
keepers continue to come into line.
This year relations with the Railway
Department have been less cordial
than usual. The change in the
personnel of the Board of Commis-
sioners (consequent on the super-
session of Mr. Speight) was fol-
lowed by an apparent lack of that
readiness on the part of the Com-
missioners to consult the convenience
of travelling men that had hither-
to characterised them, and some
friction was the natural result.
During this year a circular was
addressed to the leading Melbourne
firms, drawing their attention to the
facilities afforded byjffie Association
for the engagement of reliable travel-
lers. The circular met with a most
favourable reception, and this branch
of the Association’s usefulness was
looked upon as having been put on a
sound footing.
1893.
President George Powell found
that his business engagements would
make such serious demands upon his
time, that when the first six months of
his second year of office had elapsed,
he handed over the reins which he
had so skilfully manipulated, and
Mr. Andrew Winton Jack was unani-
mously voted to fill his place. The
policy of cautious management
initiated by President Powell and
his Committee was steadily adhered
to by their successors. Deter-
mined to be on the safe side,
President Jack and his colleagues
prepared themselves for a period of
unexampled depression, and they got
it. In plain figures, the net revenue
was less by than during 1891-2.
Yet, thanks to the lesson of economy
taught by the retiring Committee,
despite this alarming shrinkage the
year resulted in an apparent deficiency
of only 1 os. id., after writing
off a sum of £t> 2 9 9 s - for depre-
ciation of Club furniture, &c. This
result, as against a corresponding
deficit of £sßs 7s. 2d. on last year’s
net revenue of £too more, had a
right to feel proud of itself. The
anxious care exercised is proved by
the figures of the Club account. The
loss here was 2s. 1 id. in 1891-2,
whereas the twelve months under
review only resulted in a debit of
income was less by o is. 51!. —
careful husbandry indeed. Owing to
there being no profit on the year’s
working, the current funds had to be
debited with ns. 2d., the sum
due to the Mortuary Benefit Fund
under the rules. The Committee
took this step without hesitation,
feeling assured that they would be
justified in the event. The Full
members’ roll shows a total of 211, as
against 226 last year—a most satisfac-
tory result, all things considered. In
the Club members’ roll the slump
continues, and they now total only
197, against 262 in the previous
year. During the year Mr. William
Burns, an old and highly-esteemed
member, joined the great majority.
A sum of was distributed in
relief. A gratifying function of the
year was the Relief Day Collection,

id. This year the Mortuary Benefit
Fund is in full working order, and a
sum of is the available dividend.
In the matter of the Hotel List, the
Committee went further than its pre-
decessors. Convinced that some
adequate method of classification was
still to seek, they grasped the nettle
by dividing all the hotels of the
colony into two sections, A and B;
those in the A division being con-
sidered entitled to charge a maximum
rate of ios. per diem, and those in
the B one of Bs. The classifica-
tion proved so unanswerable that
only three hotel proprietors objected.
This is, in many respects, one of
the most significant years in the
Association’s experience, and the
concluding words of its Committee are
worth reproducing. They “ have no
apprehension as to the reception
which their report will receive. The
figures speak for themselves. There
can be no doubt that a tide of en-
thusiasm has set in in connection
with the Association, and the new
Committee will have the pleasing
task —which is not grudged them—
of bringing in the sheaves. The year
just passed has been one of intense
anxiety and hard work, but has ter-
minated happily. The Association
has asserted its value, which has also
been ascertained by members. The
retiring Committee now hand over
their charge, and commend it to the

care of their successors, with every
prediction of a prosperous future.
Success is within their grasp, and, as
business men, they will not easily
let it escape.”
1894.
This year witnessed the turning of
the tide. When President Jack and
his Committee took office they laid
down for themselves a definite pro-
gramme, and to it they rigidly
adhered. Its aims may be epitomised
as follows:
1. To restore the Association’s
finances to a healthy con-
dition.
2. To increase the body of Full
members.
3. To reorganise the hotel list
and tariff.
4. To adopt and supply an
Association badge.
5. To revise and publish the
Association’s rules.
6. To establish a Widows’ and
Orphans’ Fund.
7. To settle the matter of Club
premises.
As to how this programme was lived
up to by the Committee, and (it must
be added) by members generally, let
the facts and figures that follow
testify.
1. The Finances. —The ex-
penditure, especially that connected
with the Club section, was overhauled
in the most thorough way, while at
the same time every effort was made
both to increase the revenue and the
margin of profit. As a result, the
general revenue showed a profit on
the year of £646 3s. Bd., against the
previous year’s loss of 10s. id.
This year, for the first time, all trans-
actions connected with the trust funds
(Mortuary Benefit. Relief, Widows’
and Orphans’, and Scholarship Funds)
are kept entirely apart from the ordi-
nary accounts. The constitution of
the Association has also been altered
so as to prevent the future investment
of the trust funds otherwise than in
Government stock or first mortgages
on freehold property. As evidence
of the drastic reforms initiated, note
that assets have been written down to
the extent of Bs. 7d. (The
chief item was the balance credited
to Club furniture account over and

above the value of the furniture,
which, under the old system, repre-
sented so much of the trust funds.
The Committee took the Spartan
view that the furniture was not worth
more altogether than the
ns. 4d. so invested, and wiped out the
balance of 17s. 9d. entirely.)
After this exhaustive review of the
assets, and after devoting in
cash (one-third of Full members’ sub-
scriptions) to the Mortuary Benefit
Fund, there remained 9s. 2d.
undivided profits to carry forward.
2. The Members’ Rolls.—The
bold expedient was adopted of
abolishing the Full members’ entrance
fee for three months, and in the event
it proved also a happy one. Over
one hundred good men and true were
brought in, raising the total number
of Full members to 327—a record-
breaking feat, being 116 ahead of the
previous year, and 100 in front of the
best year since the birth of the Asso-
ciation. As for the Club members,
they stand at 209, as against 197 the
previous year. (The deaths of three
old and highly-valued Full members
had to be recorded —Messrs. David
Gardiner, Frederick George Glanfield,
and I'. F. B. Jenaway.)
3. The Hotels. —The energy in
this department was as marked as
elsewhere. During the year no less
than 118 letters were despatched to
the proprietors of various Association
hotels, drawing their attention to
many details affecting especially the
comfort of members, and, incidentally,
those of the travelling public
generally.
4. The Badge. —An uniform
metal badge was adopted.
5. The Revision of the Asso-
ciation Rules. —What an important
alteration for the better was made in
the position of the Trust Funds has
been already noted.
6. Widows’ and Orphans’
Fund.—This took a definite shape
1 as one of the most laudable adjuncts
of the Association. The Fund was
initiated with a capital of
ns. 6d., the proviso being made that
it should not become operative until
,£lOOO should stand to its credit.
JAMES DAVIES.
Secretary 1885-1899.


7. The Club.—The working of
this section resumed its station
on the up grade with a profit of
7s. 1 id. (against a loss of
£43 19s. 1 id. on the previous year).
An arrangement was entered into to
cancel the existing lease of £5OO
per annum, and to issue a fresh one
for five years at £3OO per annum (as
from May Ist, 1894), the landlords to
put the rooms in thorough order.
The Club was accordingly re-decorated
without any expense to the Associa-
tion. (This year was inaugurated the
Club Circulating Library.)
Such a catalogue of achievement
speaks for itself. Following upon the
stern economy of the preceding year,
this energetic campaign rounded off
its accomplishment in the most
brilliant style, and, jointly with it,
proved undoubtedly the stepping-
stone upon which the Association has
risen to its present proud eminence.
President Jack and his retiring Com-
mittee, in transferring their trust to
other hands, conclude with the hope
that their “ successors will not abate
one whit of energy because the posi-
tion of the Association is prosperous.
Folding of hands in time of pros-
perity has been a great danger in the
past, and there is always a danger of
its repetition. There is much good
and vigorous work to be done, and
with the assistance of the enthusiasm
now prevailing among the general
body of members, and with their
minds free from any financial
anxiety beyond the necessity for
reasonable caution in administration,
the incoming Committee should make
a great stride in prosperity.”
1895.
“ The present position of the Asso-
ciation is in the highest degree satis-
factory. The funds are on a sound
basis, and in a flourishing condition.
The prospects of the C.T.A. of Vic-
toria were never brighter.” Such is
the dying note, the swan’s song of
President Jack and his Committee-
men as they drop the reins of office
at the close of ’95. It has been a
year of happiness and contentment,
and, to corroborate the old aphorism,
it need not fill a very large space in
this historical tableau. A net profit
is recorded of 4s. id., of
which £982 ns. 4d. was used to
eliminate the item of “Club Furni-
ture” from the list of Trust Funds
investments, which are now credited
with hard cash to that amount, and
are distinctly the healthier for the
transaction. Warming to enthusiasm,
once they were started on the subject
of furniture, the Committee went
further, and wiped the item out of the
balance-sheet altogether, besides a
sum of 3s. 9d. which had been
spent on renovating same. The Club
Furniture accordingly disappeared
altogether from the list of the Asso-
ciation’s assets —a triumph of healthy
administrative finance. The total of
the Trust Funds has now reached the
handsome sum of 145., en-
tirely invested in Victorian Govern-
ment stocks and first mortgages on
freehold property, with the excep-
tion of £787 9s. 5d., which lies
in the Union Bank awaiting invest-
ment. The Mortuary Benefit stands
at £2439 18s. sd. The Widows’
and Orphans’ Fund has grown from
£344 ns. 6d. to £603 9s. 4d., and
the hope is expressed that before
another year has elapsed it wall have
reached and be in full work-
ing order. The Full Members’ Roll
shows 323,against 327 of the previous
year, and has evidently reached the
“steady” level. Club members still
fall away, the figures being 179, against
209 in the previous year. The deaths
of three worthy Full members are
recorded —Messrs. H. A. Walker, W.
Drummond, and T. Chamney. The
theory of restricting the number of
Association hotels has been strictly
adhered to, and during the year
twenty hotels were removed from the
list, as against five added. The great
project of the Federation of the
C.T.A.’s of Australasia has now
assumed a tangible form (see “The
Federal Movement”).
1896.
The Association this year is under
the presidency of Mr. W. A. Morris,
and the general fortunate trend of
things is summarised in the congratu-
lation with which he is enabled to
close his valedictory message to mem-
bers. The transactions of the year
show a net profit of £1274 18s. 2d.,
apart from that on The Traveller
account, which latter has now disap-
peared from the balance-sheet. Of this
sum, £BB3 Bs. 3d. is carried in cash
to the Benefit Funds, £238 19s. iod.
has gone to adjust the account of
The Traveller (hitherto worked on a
method profitable enough in results,
but slipshod in principle, and, as a
criterion, confusing if not fallacious).
Essentially the figures closely re-
semble those of the previous year,
save as regards the Club section,
where there has been a diminution in
profits to the extent of 13s. id.
(In order to cope with this tendency
the fees of Club members have
recently been reduced, and the Com-
mittee report that already an improve-
ment begins to manifest itself.) The
BenefitFundsnow r total^6172 25.3 d.,
as against £3288 145., and are all
invested strictly according to the
rules of the Association, save
still in the Union Bank awaiting the
opening of a favourable channel of
investment. In relief, .^5l 6s. has
been disbursed, and—evidence of
the sound methods of working—
los. has been repaid by
members previously assisted. The
Mortuary Benefit, at the close of the
year, has a credit of 18s. 3d.,
as against £ 2439 18s. sd. at the close
of ’95. The Widows’ and Orphans’
Fund stands at ££7B 16s. 9d., just
falling short of the £ 1000 requisite
for it to become operative. The
Scholarship Fund is in a healthy con-
dition, and up to the date of report
the Association had paid to the chil-
dren of members over £3OO on ac-
count of Scholarships. Full Members’
Roll shows 341, against the 323 at
close of previous year. The Club
Members’ Roll is recovering itself, and
now stands at 202, as against 179 last
year. The suspension of the entrance
fee, and the reduction of the annual
subscription by one half, have largely
conduced towards this result. The
year’s death roll includes the names
of three old and esteemed Full mem-
bers —Messrs. Richard Simpson, E.
Meacock, and S. Watcham. The
United C.T.A. of Australasia is now
fairly launched (see “The Federal
Movement ’). His Excellency Lord
Brassey has consented to succeed
Lord Hopetoun as patron of the
Association. The chief social feature
of the year has been the great C.T.A.
Easter Carnival. The function was a
gigantic success, and especially notable
for the strong intercolonial element in
evidence.
1897.
President Miers and his Committee
are able to report a record year.
There has been a clear gain of
los. sd. during the year, as
against 18s. 2d. in ’96. Of
this sum, 9s. 9d. has gone
straight to the Benefit Funds,
has been set aside as a contingent
account in connection with the Trust
Funds, 7s. 3d. has been used to
write down the Government inscribed
stock to market value, and a balance
of 19s. iod. is carried forward
as a working balance. The Benefit
Funds have reached the total of
£73°7> as against 2s. 3d.
During the year they have been
invested in Credit Foncier bonds
to the amount of £\ooo, and
los. has gone into Government
inscribed stock; a further sum of
£6 OO is also available for investment.
The sum of £l2 12s. has been
disbursed in relief, and the Relief
Day Collection has brought 14s.
into the coffers of the fund. The
Mortuary Benefit now stands at
l6s. iod. The capital of the
Widows’ and Orphans’ Fund is now
£1163 12s. 3d., and is in operation.
An Annuity Fund has been proposed,
but in deference to actuarial advice
has not been persisted in. Full mem-
bers now number 333, against the
330 of ’96, while there are now 360
Club members, against 202. The
deaths are recorded of two old and
esteemed Full members —Messrs.
D. B. Groves and E. G. Robinson,
the former gentleman having been
one of the founders of the Associa-
tion. In the matter of hotels, a
circular has been issued to every
Association hotel, drawing the atten-
tion of proprietors to the necessity of
providing proper sanitary accommo-
dation, and stating that, if this were
not done, the licensing and health
authorities would be communicated
with. The relations with the Rail-
way Department have been cordiality
itself. The United C.T.A. of Aus-
tralasia has continued its onward
march (see “ The Federal Movement ’).
This was the year of the Queen’s
Jubilee, and the Committee showed
their sense of the fitness of things by
donating £23 to the Queen’s Memo-
rial Fever Hospital Fund. The late
fee charged for posting letters on
trains was rescinded so far as travellers
are concerned. It was proposed by
the Commissioner of Taxes to collect
income tax on half the amount
allowed by firms to their travellers for
expenses; but in consequence of the
representations of the Association,
the proposal was dropped, because it
was unjust. The desirability of erect-
ing a Club-house is being especially
driven home by the coming expiry of
lease (in eighteen months), and an
eligible site is already being discussed
as probably affording most of the
advantages to be desiderated.
1898.
This is another record year. The
net profit on the twelve months’ ope-
rations was ns. 1 id, against
los. 5d., making, with the
balance brought forward
19s. iod.), a total amount of
ns. 9d. available for allocation. Of
this, £2692 18s. 3d. is placed to the
credit of the various Benefit Funds,
and the balance l3s. 6d.) is
carried forward. The Benefit Funds
now total Bs. nd., as against
the £7307 12s. of ’97. The relief
disbursed amounted to 155., and
the Relief Day Collection netted
The Mortuary Benefit Fund has now
attained the magnificent total of
as against ss. 4d. in
’97. The capital of the Widows’ and
Orphans’ Fund now stands at
16s. 5d., and no claim has as yet been
made upon it. The Members’ Rolls,
like every other feature of this record
year, have reached their high-water
mark up to date—Full members
numbering 361, against the 333 of
’97; and Club members 446, as
against 360. The death of one Full
member is recorded —Mr. Walter
Turner. The relations between the
Association and the Railways are as
cordial as ever, the enlightened
regime of Mr. Mathieson accentuating
the fact. The hotel accommodation
of the colony has received the usual
earnest attention, and the Associa-
tion has been in touch with the
Central Board of Health on the
subject of sanitary arrangements, still
considering that there is much room
for improvement in the Association
houses. During the year sub-com-
mittees have paid much attention to
the details ot the Association rules.
One chief result is the proposal
brought forward by President Cump-
ston in favour of the incorporation of
the Association under a section of the
Companies Act. The status of Life
Governors has also been exhaustively
inquired into. The great feature of
the year’s operations, however, has
been the undertaking to provide the
new Club-house in .Flinders-street,
which at the date of report is in
course of erection. Altogether the
year’s business affords ample founda-
tion for the parting words of President
Cumpston and Committee —“We feel
justified in congratulating members
on the splendid position which the
Association now occupies. The
coming year is likely to be a most
important one in the Association’s
history, and in retiring from office we
wish to urge upon members the
necessity of cordially assisting our
successors in the very arduous duties
which are likely to devolve upon
them in connection with entering the
new premises and carrying the
financial scheme r<?same to a success-
ful issue.”
1899.
During the part of the present year
which has already elapsed, the steady
progress of the Association has been
fully maintained. The financial result
of the seven months ending April
30th was a net profit of
1 os. 9d., as against I2S -
for the corresponding period of last
year. The rolls of members present
a most healthy appearance, the total
number (paid up) of Full members
standing at 421, and of Club

members at 520 —a record in the
Association’s history. There is, in
addition, a very heavy list of nomina-
tions for election at the next meet-
ing of the Committee. The great
event of the six months was the
opening of the new Club-house
in Flinders-street, full particu-
lars as to which will be found on
another page. Another important
matter, which has absorbed a good
deal of time and thought, has been
the complete revision of the rules of
the Association. It only remains
now for the result of these delibera-
tions to be submitted to the general
body of members. The otherwise
bright record of the six months is dim-
med by the fact that no less than five
Full members have been removed by
death, viz.—Messrs. C. Sumerfield,
G. Clark, H. Bone, W. S. Ingle,
and E. C. Stooke. The Mortuary
Dividend, it may be noted, was fixed
at £to for 1899, and four out of the
five deaths recorded above were
entitled to the maximum dividend.
Delegates of the Association
attended the annual Conference of
the United Association in Sydney
at Easter time, and much useful
business was transacted, the chief
feature being the Accident Insurance
system arranged ‘with the Colonial
Mutual Insurance Company. Here
we leave the Association, under con-
ditions the most auspicious that it
has been its good fortune to experi-
ence since its inception, and surely
as favourable as those that have
fallen to the lot of any similar body
in any country, or at any period.
All the signs point towards a long
life and a prosperous one, and so
definite are they that any other result
is inconceivable.
THE MORTUARY BENEFIT FUND.
How best to crown the benefits
accruing to members by guaranteeing
them, in the event of death, against
the possibility of leaving those near
and dear to them in destitution had
from the first been a question that
had much exercised the more serious
minds of the Association.
The result had remained nebulous,
however, until in January, 1892, a
sub-committee was appointed to
exhaustively investigate the whole
subject, and, if practicable, to pro-
vide an acceptable modus opera?idi.
At the meeting of the General Com-
mittee of May 7th, ’92, that sub-com-
mittee submitted a scheme, the fruit of
much inquiry and earnest discussion,
and which has since been developed
into the present working scheme.
The scheme, as submitted, having
been discussed at considerable length,
and in a most favourable spirit, it was
finally resolved—“ That this meeting
approves of the scheme of a Mortuary
Benefit Fund submitted by the sub-
committee, subject to legal and
actuarial advice, and that a special
general meeting be called at a future
date to alter the rules of the Associa-
tion as required by such completed
scheme.”
During June, ’92, the sub-com-
mittee again met, and further
elaborated their draft scheme, pro-
viding for many contingencies which
had not previously occurred to them.
Ihe result of their labours was then
laid before the solicitors of the
Association prior to being handed
over to an authorised actuarial expert,
to be licked into final and definite form.
On December 3rd, ’92, the last
preliminary step was taken by the
appointment of Messrs. G. Powell,
A. W. Jack, and the late Mr. F.
Jenaway as a sub-committee to have
the necessary provisions added to the
books and rules of the Association,
and during ’93 the Fund was in full
working order; the sum of being
available as a Mortuary Dividend to
be divided amongst the beneficiaries
under the provisions of the Fund.
THE NEW PREMISES AT 190 FLINDERS STREET, MELBOURNE.
Since that time of initiation, the
career of this most important branch
of the Association’s activities has been
an unbroken success. During 1894
the sum of was paid in death
dividends, and at the close of the
year the capital and reserve fund
stood at ,£2134 1 os. Bd. Since then
the figures have grown as follows:
1895: Capital and Reserve Fund,
lBs. 5d.; Mortuary Dividends
paid amounting to 6s. 1896:
Capital, 18s. 3d.; Dividends
paid, £6B. 1897: Capital,
16s. iod.; Dividends paid (3 deaths),
l4s. 1898: Capital, ;
Dividends paid (1 death), j£so.
1899: The dividend is now j£6o.
Such arecord can only be characterised
as brilliant in the extreme, and given
time, the unflagging support which
the Fund has been accorded from its
initiation, and the wonder-working
powers of compound interest, one
can easily believe that that great
Canadian dividend of over is
within sight of the present generation
of members, or that even the best
figures of the American Associations,
where dividends range as high as
j£\ooo, are not outside the pale of
the possible.
It will easily be understood that
the striking career of the Victorian
Mortuary Benefit Fund has fired the
emulative zeal of our kindred associa-
tions on this continent, and quite
recently its most eminent apostle—
Mr. A. VV. Jack —opened (at the local
request) an energetic crusade amongst
our South Australian confreres , which
has already borne fruit.
The S.A. Association has inaugu-
rated a Mortuary Benefit Fund, which
is now in full operation.
THE WIDOWS’ AND ORPHANS’ FUND.
This was introduced by Mr. A. W.
Jack at the Special General Meeting
held on December 9th, 1893, and
finally formulated at the half-yearly
General Meeting in May, 1894.
The name of this fund has only to
be mentioned to establish its right to
be considered one of the noblest and
most commendable forms that the
activities of an association of travel-
ling men could possibly assume.
From the first it was determined that
the Fund should not become operative
until a sum of should stand
to its credit. The attainment of such
a standard was by no means a thing
of the dim and misty future. By the
end of ’94 a foundation had been
laid to the extent of ns. 6d.
By the end of ’95 the Fund had
grown to £603 9s. 4d. By Novem-
ber 2nd, ’96, the figure reached was
l6s. 9d., being only £22 3s. 3d.
short of the imperative By
the close of ’97 the capital had
grown to ,£1163 12s. 3d.; and at the
last Annual General Meeting (Octo-
ber 31st, ’9B) the Fund amounted to
l6s. 5d., no claim having yet
been made upon its resources. Every
member can rest assured that should
his widow or orphans be unfortunately
in need of assistance, there is no
danger of their being-allowed to want.
And so in this quiet, unpretentious
way has grown up and waxed strong a
Fund which now forms at once one of
the solidest of boons for members,
and one of the brightest of the many
bright jewels in the Association’s
record of usefulness and organised
benevolence.
VICTORIA AND THE FEDERATION OF
AUSTRALASIAN C.T.A's.
The desire for the Federation of the
various Associations of travelling men
of Australasia was one of the chief
sentimental characteristics of the
C.T.A. of Victoria from its very
inception. Neither the desirability of
the movement nor its advisability was
ever suffered to be shadowed by doubt
for a moment; the only dubiety was
as to its feasibility. “The news of the
recent formation of a Commercial
Travellers’ Association in New Zea-
land,” writes The Traveller q{ Novem-
ber 29th, 1890, “and the fact that Vic-
toria, N.SAV., Queensland, and South
Australia have for some time past
possessed each their C.T.A., suggests
to us with ever-increasing force the
conviction that the time is not far
distant when a conference should be
held of the various Australasian
Associations, for the purpose of
amalgamating into a body which shall
be national in its name and ends.”
Written evidences of the under-
current of sentiment on both sides
of the Murray crop up from time to
time. In the report of the half-
yearly general meeting held on
May 7th, 1892, we read —“An im-
portant matter, which is set down for
your consideration to-day, has been
brought under the Committee’s
notice —or, rather, re-called to their
notice by the C.T.A. of N.SAV.—
viz., a suggestion that a conference
be held for the purpose of considering
the advisability of amalgamating
the C.T. Associations throughout


Australasia. This is a matter
which is recommended to your care-
ful deliberation by the Committee.”
In June, 1892, the C.T.A. of N.S.W.
write approving of the Victorian sug-
gestion that a conference be held
in Melbourne during Cup week of
same year to discuss the subject
of amalgamation. On November
2nd this conference was duly held.
A scheme of amalgamation was agreed
upon tentatively, and was duly circu-
lated amongst the members of the
Associations interested. The central
idea of the project, as sketched out,
was an affiliation of the C.T. Associa-
tions of Australasia into one represen-
tative body, each retaining its own
funds and local interests. “The
anxious times experienced since the
scheme was promulgated,” says the
Thirteenth Annual Report (November
6th, 1893), “have deferred any further
practical steps being taken, but there
can be no doubt that affiliation must
be brought about, and the coming
year should record definite action to
this end.” Unfortunately, the event
failed to justify this prophecy. The
“anxious times” continued, and the
Fourteenth Annual Report (November
sth, 1894) remarks that “this im-
portant measure has not been
approached during the past year, the
various Associations concerned having
been busily engaged in attending to
their own affairs.” “The most kindly
relations,” continues the Report,
“have, however, continued to prevail,
and the interchange of courtesies
in the form of visiting members,
and information circulated from
one Association to another, has
been extensive. The retiring Com-
mittee express the belief that
some definite action should be
taken by their successors to assist in
bringing about a Commercial Travel-
lers’ Association Federal Union. It
is needless to expatiate upon the
power of such a body as compared
with the individual influence of the
Associations.” Then things suddenly
took unto themselves tangibility, and
the movement hastened on with great
strides, as if determined to make up
for time lost. On April 16th, 1895,3
Conference was held in Sydney at the
Australia Hotel, representatives from
the C.T.A.’s of N.S.W., Victoria, and
S.A. being present. Mr. Geo.
Nesbitt, the President of the C.T.A.
of N.S.W., wasinthe chair. A scheme
of Federation was drawn up, unani-
mously adopted by the delegates, and
referred to the several Associations.
On May 4th, 1895, at the Victorian
half-yearly general meeting, the Presi-
dent (Mr. A. W. Jack) moved—“ That
this meeting consider the scheme
for the Federation of the Commercial
Travellers’ Associations of Austral-
asia, as amended and agreed to at the
Conference held in Sydney on April
16th, 1895, and advise as to calling a
special meeting for the ratification of
the said scheme.” This was purely a
preliminary motion, and it was de-
cided to hold a special general meet-
ing on June Ist, to deal exhaustively
with the scheme. The meeting was
duly held, and the President moved
—“ That this Association ratify the
scheme for the Federation of the
C.T.A.’s of Australasia as agreed to
at the recent Conference of Delegates
in Sydney.” The President’s motion
was seconded by Mr. G. W. Cump-
ston, and a discussion ensued upon
various pointsof thescheme. With one
slight alteration (suggesting “ that the
number of delegates from each
Association whose expenses may be
paid from the funds of the United
Association shall be limited to two
only”) the President’s motion was
carried unanimously, and with ac-
clamation. New South Wales, South
Australia, and the South Island of
New Zealand cast their vote to the
same effect, only Queensland and
the North Island of New Zealand
standing out. “ There is every
reason to expect,” says the Annual
Report (November 4th, 1895), “that
these Associations will pass the
scheme at an early date, by which
means the United C.T.A. of Aus-
tralasia will become an accomplished
fact, to prove a powerful factor in
promoting the interests of its
members.”
THE DININGROOM.
On April 7th, 1896, occurred the
most important event which has yet
marked the careers of theC.T.A.’s of
Australia, or that ever can mark
them. On that date was held in
Melbourne (Queen’s Walk) the first
annual Conference of the United
C.T.A. of Australasia. As this meet-
ing was epoch-making, we give the
names of all the delegates present:—
N.S.W.: Messrs. J. F. Flockart
(President), W. J. Douglass, J. H.
Stanton, W. A. Hudson, T. R.
Rowlands, W. G. Bradley. S.A.:
Mr. J. W. Annells. Vic.: Messrs.
W. A. Morris (President), A. W.
Jack, S. Muhlebach, W. J. Miers,
G. W. Cumpston, and George Jones.
Mr. James Davies, General Secretary
of the United Association, was
present in that capacity. Mr. Andrew
Winton Jack (Vic.), Vice-President
of the United Association, was unani-
mously voted to the chair. Welling-
ton and Queensland still failed to see
their way clear to amalgamation.
What was to be done ? The Fede-
ral enthusiasm was too near boiling
point for delay to be thought of for a
moment. Taking the bull by the
horns was the course that fitted the
hour, and accordingly Mr. Hudson
(N.S.W.) proposed, and Mr. Morris
(Vic.) seconded, a motion —“That
this meeting re-affirm the scheme of
Federation agreed to at Sydney on
April 6th, 1895, and decides to pro-
ceed with the same on the under-
standing that the Queensland and
Wellington Associations may come in
when they desire to do so ; also that
the subscription of one shilling per
member per annum date as from
January Ist, 1896.” The motion was
carried unanimously, and the Welling-
ton and Queensland Associations
were notified in the most cordial and
fraternal manner possible that the
United Association ot Australian
C.T.’s was an accomplished fact, of
which they were welcome to avail
themselves by coming into line at the
earliest possible moment. Delegates
then proceeded with the most whole-
souled energy to discuss the constitu-
tion of the Association in the flash-
light of the twelve months’ criticism
to which it had been subjected by the
several provincial Associations. This
is not a history of the United Associa-
tion, except in so far as it is inseparable
from that of the Victorian body, and
we must be content to note that the
general business of providing a basis
for future operations was dealt
with in a masterly way, and
the foundation was laid that
will probably suffice to bear the
superstructure of the United Associa-
tion as long as there are travelling
men to unite. As an interesting
souvenir of the first batch of United
Association notabilities, we place
their names on record here. On the
motion of Mr. Flockart (N.S.W.),
seconded by Mr. Annells (S.A.), it
was unanimously decided —“ That
Mr. Andrew Winton Jack (Vic.) be
elected President of the United
Association for the year 1896-7.”
The Vice-Presidents of this first
practical year were Messrs. J. F.
Flockart (N.S.W.), W. A. Morris
(Vic.), J. W. Annells (S.A.), and
James Wilson (Dunedin). The
Treasurer was Mr. E. W. Hayward
(S.A.). “At the conclusion of the
Conference,” runs the chronicle,
“President Jack thanked the
delegates for their business-like
performance of their duties at
the Conference, and the delegates
retaliated by unanimously conveying
a vote of thanks to the President for
the masterly manner in which he had
piloted the business through.” So
closed the first Conference or the
United C.T.A. of Australasia dele-
gates, “ congratulating themselves
upon having assisted at the inception
of the giant offspring of the C.T.A.’s
of Australasia, which, it was predicted
by all, would speedily grow into a
magnificent and powerful body.”
How splendidly that hope has been
justified is a matter of proud self-
gratulation to every travelling man
throughout the length and breadth of
Australia; so all honour to the men
who were the chief instruments of its
realisation. Let us briefly sum up
the after-history of the Federal
movement. At Easter, 1897, the
Annual Conference (with President
Jack as Chairman) was held in Ade-
laide, Victoria being represented by
the President (Mr. W. J. Miers),
Senior Vice-President Mr. W. A.
Morris, Vice-Presidents Messrs. T. J.
Davis and Geo. Jones, and Corn-


mitteeman A. S. Nuttall. Victoria
was paid the acceptable compliment
of having Mr. A. W. Jack re-elected
President of the United Association
for the ensuing year. In 1898 the
Annual Conference was held in Bris-
bane at Easter, Victoria being repre-
sented by President Cumpston and
Vice-Presidents W. J. Miers and T. J.
Davis, and the work of Federation was
still further assured. At Easter, 1899,
the Conference met at Sydney,Victoria
being represented by President Geo.
Jones, Senior Vice-President G. W.
Cumpston, and Vice-President D. G.
Paterson.
THE NEW CLUB-HOUSE.
In the History will be found duly set
down how the ever-growing scope of
the Association, with the concomitant
necessity for more elbow-room, have
THE BILLIARDROOM.
driven it, the voluntary Juif Errant of
Club-life, from one resting-place to
another, to reach its domiciliary climax
in the new premises in Flinders-street.
In ’Bl Phair’s Hotel furnished what
were snug, comfortable quarters for
those days; then came Her Majesty’s;
next came the Duke of Rothsay;
then the premises higher up Collins-
street; then (in ’88) the rooms
in Queen’s Walk, where eleven
eventful years were spent with their
ups and downs, their fat periods and
their lean. And all those years the
activities were growing both in breadth
and in intensity. Funds were accu-
mulating, new avenues of usefulness
were opening up—the Widows’ and
Orphans’ Fund, the Scholarship
Fund, the Distress Fund, the Mor-
tuary Benefit Fund, and so on.
All that was lacking to this full ener-
getic life, all that was required to
round it off, was that it should receive
a proper setting, or in other words, be
adequately housed. This had been a
conviction of the “forward” section
of the members from the very first
(see the History), but events had long
conspired to keep it from embodying
itself in bricks and mortar. At last
the opportunity came, was seized, and
the result is the finest Club-house
devoted entirely to the wants and
interests of commercial travellers that
the world can show.
Some censorious persons may pos-
sibly be inclined to look upon the new
premises in Flinders-street as savour-
ing of the pretentious, or even of the
extravagant. Such an accusation is a
compliment in its way, and the best
answer to it that not a penny is owing
on the whole undertaking outside of
the Association and its members.
Everything has been paid for in hard
cash.
The universal verdict is that the
edifice is as ornamental outside, and
as comfortable inside, as time, ex-
pense, and architectural skill could
make it. It has a frontage of 40 feet,
with an elevation of 60 feet, the
design, in brick and stone, being at
once neat and striking. The en-
trance is an imposing one, flanked on
either side by reception rooms and
the offices of the Secretary. On the
ground floor are also the principal
bar and (immediately behind it) the
main dining-hall, a really magnificent
apartment, with walls and ceiling of
Keene’s cement, well lighted, pro-
vided with every modern convenience,
and capable of accommodating 200
diners. The Club room is on the
first floor, and is furnished in the
most modern and recherche fashion,
the taste of the furnishing committee
being made as evident by the ele-
gance of the appointments as is their
common-sense in the thoroughly
comfortable aspect of the tout
ensemble. On the same floor is the
billiard-room, on which the architect
and the furnishing committee have
lavished their skill and attention so
liberally that it is acknowledged to be
the finest in Melbourne. It contains
three of Alcock’s best tables. The
rest of the floor is occupied by three
card-rooms, a bar, a shower-room, and
two lavatories. On the second floor
are found the board-room, several
bedrooms and bath-rooms. The
board-room is a spacious apartment
in the front of the building, capable
of being used not only for committee
meetings, but for half-yearly and
special general meetings. The third
floor is occupied by bedrooms and
bath-rooms. There are in all 31 bed-
100ms. The fourth and topmost
flat is utilised in part for the house-
steward’s quarters, the kitchen, &c.,
and consists, in part, of a flat fireproof
roof, excellently fitted for the holding
of moonlight concerts and other
similar open-air functions. On the
whole, it may safely be said that no
convenience and no comfort to be
found in the most fastidious club-
man’s catalogue of requirements are
missing. The bathrooms—such indis-
pensable accompaniments of an Aus-
tralian summer—are plentiful and
get-at-able, while the sanitary arrange-
ments might teach a lesson to many
of the best-known clubs and public
institutions in the city. The archi-
tect (and designer) of the build-
ing, Mr. H. W. Tompkins, and the
contractor, Mr. C. Langford, are
entitled to the greatest praise for the
able way in which the work, alike in
its general effect and in its smallest
details, has been carried out. Mr.
R. B. Whitaker, the advising architect
of the Association, was also of
the greatest assistance in bringing
the work to a successful conclu-
sion.
INAUGURAL BANQUET AT MEL-
BOURNE TOWN HALL.
On the evening of June 2nd the
crowning touch was administered to
the inaugural ceremonies by a Dinner
at the Melbourne Town Hall. The
gathering was of the most representa-
tive character. Among the guests (of
whom there were fully five hundred
present) were the Mayor of Mel-
bourne (Councillor M‘Eacharn), the
Minister of Mines (Mr. Foster), the
Bishop of Melbourne, Sir Frederick
Sargood (M.L.C.), Messrs. Anderson
and Fink (M.L.A.’s), Captain Collins
(Secretary for Defence), Mr. E. G.
Fitz Gibbon (Chairman of the Metro-
politan Board of Works), Mr. Robert
Reid, M.L.C. (Chairman of the
Chamber of Commerce), Mr. R. J.
Alcock (ex-Chairman of the same
body), Mr. H. Butler (Chairman of
the Melbourne Warehousemen’s As-
sociation), Mr. Appleton (Chairman of
the Victorian Steamship-owners’ As-
sociation), Mr. C. M‘Gregor (repre-
senting the C.T.A. of New South
Wales), Mr. A. Mackie (representing
the C.T.A. of South Australia), Mr.
F. T. Derham (Chairman of the Vic-
torian Chamber of Manufactures),
Mr. W. Bell Jackson (Chairman
of the Old Colonists’ Association
of Victoria), Mr. E. Keep (Chair-
man of the Melbourne Hardware
Merchants’ Association), Mr. Fitz-
patrick (Traffic Manager, Victorian
Railways), Mr. J. A. Ewen (Messrs.
Sargood, Butler, Nichol and Ewen),
also Mr. H. W. Tompkins (architect)
and Mr. C. Langford (contractor) for
the new premises of the Association.
Mr. George Jones (President of the
Association) presided.
Apologies for absence, owing to
prior engagements, were read from
His Excellency the Governor, the
Premier, His Honour the Chief
Justice, the. Commissioner of Rail-
ways, Mr. E. L. Zox, M.L.A., the
President of the United C.T.A. of
Australasia, and from the Presidents
of the various affiliated Associations,
who all sent kindly messages.
The catering was in the capable
hands of Mr. H. Skinner, while the
musical arrangements were managed
by Mr. Harcourt Lee. “Her Majesty
the Queen” was proposed by the Presi-
dent, and honoured with enthusiasm.
Mr. R. J. Alcock then proposed “The
Parliament of Victoria.” He hoped
that the Government would speedily
see its way clear to reducing some of
the present questionable or entirely
superfluous taxes especially the
income tax. (Hear, hear.) He
regretted to have to say that of late
years there had been too much
legislation in Victoria. Bills seemed
to have been introduced with no
other object than to fill up time.
(Hear, hear.) The commercial
public had their gaze firmly fastened
on Federation, which they felt was
bound to be achieved, and in the
beneficence of whose results they
had the utmost confidence. One of
its most significant effects would be
that commercial travellers would be
able to go from one end of Australia
to the other, and have no vexatious
Customs barriers to encounter.
(Cheers.)


Mr. Foster, Minister of Mines,
responded. He considered that the
time had arrived when something
might reasonably be done by
Government to lessen the burden of
taxation. Without speaking authori-
tatively, he ventured to say that a
reduction of the income tax w r ould
soon receive the favourable con-
sideration of the Government.
(Cheers.) Victoria had not been in
a better position for many years past.
During the last year we had pro-
duced gold to the value of
; wool to the value of
2 33» 000 s and wheat to the value
of 101,365. Altogether, the gold
product of Victoria since the precious
yellow metal was first discovered
here figured out at a value of
Mr. Theodore Fink, M.L.A., pro-
posed the “Corporation of Mel-
bourne.”
The Mayor (Councillor M'Eacharn)
responded, and took the opportunity
of congratulating Mr. E. G. Fitz
Gibbon on his re-election to the
Chairmanship of the Metropolitan
Board of Works, emphasising, amid
loud cheers, the services which the
venerable Chairman had already ren-
dered to the City of Melbourne.
Sir Frederick Sargood, M.L.C.,
proposed “ The Commercial In-
terests.” Fifty years ago, said Sir
Frederick, he was himself a Mel-
bourne travelling man, and he was
therefore, he thought, rather peculiarly
fitted to realise the contrast between
the Melbourne of the forties and the
Melbourne of to-day. In ’49 some 488
vessels entered Port Phillip, freighted
with 97,000 tons of cargo; last year
the number of vessels was 1718, and
the merchandise totalled 2,400,000
tons. In ’49 the population was
66,000; to-day it is 1,200,000. The
annual w r ool export was worth in
those days some ; now it
reaches a value of two and a-quarter
millions sterling. This was surely a
creditable record for so small a com-
munity. He was glad to be able to
say that the day was now not far
distapt when all commercial barriers
between the various provinces of Aus-
tralia would be swept clean away.
(Loud cheers.)
“ The Commercial Travellers’ Asso-
ciation of Victoria” was proposed by
the Mayor, who took the opportunity
of quoting some striking facts and
figures relative to the progress of the
Association. His Worship also paid
a tribute to the unfailing courtesy
which he had himself invariably
experienced at the hands of travelling
men “ on the road.”
Mr. George Jones (President of the
Association) responded in the following
terms; —
My Lord Bishop, Mr. Mayor, and Gentle-
men—Your applause is indeed required to
back up my lack of words to adequately ex-
press our appreciation of the well-expressed
terms in which you, Mr. Mayor, have pro-
posed the toast of the Commercial Travel-
lers’ Association of Victoria—that Associa-
tion of which we are so proud. lam glad
to find you are so conversant with our
affairs ; you have eulogised our objects in
such a way as to take the wind out of my
sails. Eighteen years ago, when a few of
those typical travellers of the good old
school laid the foundation of the Associa-
tion, they could hardly have foreseen the
growth we would make in the time; but
by that united interest which has charac-
terised the Association, we have advanced
from one room in an hotel to apartments, j
thence to a building of our own—one that
is considered to be an ornament even to
this city over which you preside, Mr.
Mayor, and is probably the best Commer-
cial Travellers’ club-house in the world.
The completion of that work is the cause
of our gathering to-night; a dinner is not
with us an annual function, but this special
occasion we consider worth rejoicing over.
I hope we will not be dazzled by our suc-
cess thus far, but continue to perpetuate
those funds and objects for which we are
associated. To relieve possibly necessitous
travellers is a feature with us, and some
of us have a hope of solving to our satis-
faction that which legislators have in view
for more general application, an Old Age
Pension Fund.
1 o do something for the widows and
orphans of deceased travellers, to assist
in the higher education of members’ chil-
dren, are, we consider, laudable objects ;
and if we assist in bringing out some star
to advance Victoria we will be well repaid.
Our Mortuary Benefit Fund is our special
interest, and is much appreciated. To
belong to this Association the best of tra-
velling men may well consider it an honour
and a privilege.
Our functions are clearly established.
Socially, we support and protect the cha-

racter, status, and interest of commercial
travellers, and consider questions affecting
them, and endeavour to promote good-
fellowship ; and in this connection we
claim that when advancing our interests
we advance the interests of our employers;
when we strive for greater railway con-
venience, that is to facilitate and further
our business; when we seek greater
comfort in hotels, that again is to the
advantage of our employers, for a well-fed
man who goes whistling to work is calcu-
lated to work better than he who carries a
growl about with him.
We claim a national importance, being
ambassadors of that commerce which has
been, and is, such a factor in Britain’s
greatness.
Politically, we claim no special signifi-
cance, yet we modestly consider we are
not the least intelligent critics of that
which is best in laws for our country’s
progress and stability. The time may
come when we will be approached to form
ourselves a constituency and send a repre-
sentative to Parliament; and when that
day arrives, I have no doubt we will be
able to produce a man. Whilst awaiting
that event, we think some consideration
might be given us to facilitate our exercis-
ing the right of voting. A loyal and
patriotic C.T. has at election time to
sacrifice business for one, or possibly two
days, to do his duty to his country. We
have tried, and intend to persevere in our
efforts, to get some amendment of the
Voters Act in the desired direction.
To the Railway Department we are
indebted for much intelligent consideration.
They recognise in us a large part of their
passenger traffic, and are anxious and
quick to meet our requests. We reason-
ably think that which is best for us is good
for travelling people generally, and good
for the Department.
With the Customs we have little to do,
but suggest that were an easy and uniform
method of crossing our samples at border
towns provided, there would be a saving
of language. I hope—nay, lam sure—that
soon that trouble will be removed. On
the question of Federation, my words as
a commercial traveller are few: We want
room to stretch ourselves. Again, Mr. Mayor,
I thank you for the toast you so ably pro-
posed.
The toast of “ Our Guests” was
then proposed by Mr. G. W. Cump-
ston in a bright speech. The Bishop
of Melbourne responded in what
struck many as the most interesting
speech of the evening. His Lord-
ship recalled the intimate relations
which in the past have existed be-
tween commercial travellers and the
most significant features of British
trade. He instanced George Moore,
the Napoleon of Commercial Travel-
lers, whose operations “ on the road”
were colossal, and the wonder of his
contemporaries. He also alluded
pleasantly to Charles Dickens’s genial
appreciation of travelling men, some
of the most engaging creations of the
great novelist’s fancy being brethren
of the craft.
Mr. E. G. Fitz Gibbon also re-
sponded, as did Mr. W. Fitzpatrick
(Chief Traffic Manager Victorian
Railways), who took the opportunity
both to apologise for the absence of
his chief (Mr. Mathieson), and to em-
phasise the cordial good-will which
has always marked the intercourse of
commercial travellers and the great
Department which he ornaments.
The toast of “ Kindred Associa-
tions” was proposed by Mr. A. W.
Jack in one of his vigorous, stirring
speeches, and was responded to by
Mr, A. Mackie, Secretary of the
C.T.A. of South Australia, who apolo-
gised for the unavoidable absence of
his President, Mr. Kilsby; and by
Mr. C. M‘Gregor, of the C.T.A. of
N.S.W.
The toast of “The Ladies” was
proposed by Mr. D. G. Paterson,
and replied to by Mr. H. A. Bown.
Vice-President A. G. Bourbaud proposed
The Press. In characterising the Press
as one of the grandest and noblest of our
free institutions, he claimed that the Vic-
torian Press would compare favourably
with any in the world for alertness,
reliability, and enterprise, dwelling chiefly
on the great enterprise that characterises
the running of our morning dailies, but
with characteristic modesty refraining
from mentioning our old friend, the Herald ,
in that connection. The speaker predicted
that ere long London would find it ad-
visable to have on the staff of some of its
great dailies men drawn from colonial
ranks, and Mr. Bourbaud instanced such
men as Mr. Hogan (secretary to the
Colonial Party in the House of Commons),
and Henniker Heaton, also Kyrle Bellew
(the latter an old Herald reporter), as men
once connected with the colonial Press, who
had made their mark in the old country.
The speaker caused some diversion by
including in our list of exports such
“articles” as racehorses, singers, and
cricketers (the last of course subject to
"drawback” duty), and claimed that
before long journalists would be added.
The speaker, in conclusion, trusted that
the law of libel would speedily be altered,
and the disabilities under which our Press
suffered removed. The toast was received
with enthusiasm, and suitably replied to
by the members of the Press who were
present.
“The Chairman” was honoured by
Mr. S. Muhlebach, and this historical
gathering—a land-mark in the annals
of the C.T.A. of Victoria—finally
dispersed.
We must not omit to mention that
during the evening Messrs. Geo.
M'Dowell and Louis Luscombe did
ample justice to some first-rate songs.


THE GOVERNOR'S VISIT.
On the afternoon of Monday,
June sth, a large number of members
and commercial gentlemen assembled
to welcome His Excellency the
Governor, whose interest in the
Association had been awakened to
such an extent that he was kind
enough to intimate his desire to
personally inspect the new Club-
house. Lord Brassey arrived about
three o’clock, and was welcomed by
Mr. Green, Vice-President of the
Association, and members of the
Committee. Among other promi-
nent gentlemen present were the
Bishop of Melbourne, the Mayor of
Melbourne, the Town Clerk, Sir
Frederick Sargood, M.L.C., and Mr.
R. J. Alcock (as Trustees for the
debenture holders), Mr. Fitzpatrick
(Traffic Manager Victorian Railways),
Mr. H. Foster (Minister of Mines),
Mr. R. Reid, M.L.C. (Chairman of
Melbourne Chamber of Commerce),
Mr. Henry Butler (Chairman of
Melbourne Warehousemen’s Asso-
ciation).
His Excellency, Lady Brassey, and
the Hon. Helen Brassey, with Cap-
tain Pakenham (Private Secretary),
and Captain Cecil (A.D.C.), and the
other visitors, were conducted over
the building, and expressed the
greatest satisfaction with the splendid
arrangements for the comfort and
convenience of members. Refresh-
ments were partaken of in the large
dining hall, and Mr. James Davies,
the Secretary of the Association, pro-
posed the health of the Governor,
taking the opportunity to apologise
for the unavoidable absence of the
President, who was absent on the
business of his firm.
In responding, Lord Brassey said
that he and Lady Brassey had ex-
perienced the greatest pleasure in
visiting and inspecting the fine
edifice erected by the Association.
The representative gentlemen who
were present, said His Excellency,
were there to wish well to an institu-
tion designed to benefit gentlemen
who were performing very valuable
services to the community. It was
not an easy thing to be a producer
or a manufacturer, but he felt sure
that he would carry the commercial
gentlemen with him when he said
that it was an easier thing to produce
an article than to sell it. (Applause
and laughter.) To those far away
from the centres of production, it
was a great convenience to have
gentlemen who brought to them the
very things they stood most in want
of. (Applause.) In conclusion,
His Excellency expressed the hope
that the building would amply fulfil
all that was expected and required
of it, and he closed an interesting
speech by proposing the prosperity
of the Commercial Travellers’ Asso-
ciation.
The toast was briefly responded
to by Vice-President A. E. Green,
and a most pleasant function came
to a close.
THE PRESIDENT’S “AT HOME.”
By "JEAN."
The " At Home” to celebrate the opening
of the Club proved a brilliant function, and
the idea of having it on the Queen’s Birth-
day was nothing less than an inspiration,
for, as everyone was bent on merry-making,
it gave an air of gaiety to the town which
was quite inspiring. When Flinders-
street was reached the Club was the first
thing to attract the eye, for the whole
front of the handsome building was gay
with bunting. The ‘‘Union Jack,” the
present representative of the
“ Flag that’s braved a thousand years,
The battle and the breeze,”
was supported on either side by the flags
of the various colonies, and the “ stars and
stripes,” which has so recently waved over
“brave men and true” in war, occupied a
prominent position. On entering, we
wended our way at once to the dining-
room, en route passing the fine staircase
and bar, at which travellers’ wives looked
askance.
The President (Mr. G. Jones) and Mrs.
Jones welcomed the guests as they entered
the dining-room. Mrs. Jones, who was
gowned richly in black faille and jet, with
slight relief of white, and black and white
toque, stood by a small table, upon which
was a lovely presentation bouquet of
flowers. When seats were found, “ the
cup that cheers” was handed round, with
the accompaniment of dainty refresh-
ments. Suddenly, above the chatter of
tongues and tinkle of teacups, the tones of
the pianoforte were heard, and compara-
tive silence reigned while Miss Billings
opened proceedings by an overture. Mr.
G. M’Dowell then sang in an artistic
manner, and was followed by Mr. W. G.
Barker, whose fine voice and distinct
enunciation did full justice to the patriotic
song, “ A British Toast,” which roused
intense enthusiasm, culminating in three
hearty cheers for Her Majesty the Queen
at its conclusion. Miss Downing, daughter
of Mr. Jas. Downing, Full member, showed
herself to be the possessor of a fine voice
in a very tuneful rendering of Schubert’s
“ Serenade.” Miss Minnie Waugh evoked
much applause, but Mr. Charles Rose
was scarcely heard to advantage.
Upstairs another concert was in progress
in the reading-room, and refreshments
were served in the billiard-room. The
whole Club was thrown open for inspec-
tion, which the ladies took full advantage
of, travelling religiously from ground floor
to the roofs. Throughout nothing but
admiration was heard, for the whole build-
ing is replete with every comfort, even
luxury, until one lady said, “We shall
have no marriages soon if men are tempted
from home life like this.” The dressing
was smart and appropriate, but among so
many it was impossible to signal any out
for description, for we moved in a crowd
the whole time; but Parliamentary, as well
as mercantile, professional, and com-
mercial circles, were well represented.
“THE TRAVELLER.”
It was in May, 1889, that Mr. C. J.
Charlwood proposed, and Mr. Prid-
ham seconded, that the establishment
of an Association newspaper be
recommended to the Committee.
The motion was carried, and in
September, 1889, a circular was
sent to members intimating that
it had been “decided to institute
a Newspaper in connection .with
the Commercial Travellers’ As-
sociation of Victoria, and that, in
taking this step the Committee rely
largely not only on the support of
Members, which they take for granted,
but also on that of their numerous
friends in town and country, and the
general public as Subscribers and
Advertisers; and, in return, the Com-
mittee have every confidence in
promising a monthly budget of in-
teresting and novel news.” The
incubation period, however, proved
rather longer than appears to have
been anticipated, for it was not until
May 10th, 1890, that Vol. L, No. 1,
made its appearance—a modest little
concoction of twelve pages (n inches
long by B}4 inches wide), and minus
the coloured cover which has now for
so long been one of the recognised
features of the paper. The new
venture introduces itself to the “Men
of the Road” through the dignified
medium of blank verse. As an in-
teresting relic we reproduce part of
the lines :
The Traveller comes before you
modestly
And unassuming, as befitteth one
Of tender age and inexperience,
First venturing forth to join you in the
field
Of arduous labour—the encouragement
And due advancement of commercial aims.
For where’er
The intrepid foot of the explorer dares,
Ye follow in his track, scattering wide
The effects and habits of the civilised
world.
Thus are ye factors in the great design,
The “ union of all nature,” though,
perhaps
Unconsciously, ye work towards this end;
For man is ever selfish, aiming but
To further his own ends ; and yet his work
Is destined to fit in the general plan
Of universal progress. Such is yours,
Ye “ Men of the Road,” and such to join
The Traveller comes, hopeful that he
may bring
A fair impression to you, and receive
That warm and generous greeting at your
hands,
Which ’tis well known new travellers
receive
When first they come amongst you.
Thus the poet, and it will be
noticed, in passing, that already
The Traveller struck the true Federal
note, which it has since insisted on
through thick and thin, and which its
persistent advocacy has undoubtedly
done much to translate into hard
fact. The printers of this initial
number were H. W. Mills and Co.,
of Russell-street, who performed the
same office until the close of the
second volume.
'Number 1 of Volume 111. opens
a new epoch in the history of the
paper. The printing is now in the
hands of Messrs. Mason, Firth and
M'Cutcheon, and the editorship is
vested in Mr. Jas. Davies, the Sec-
retary of the Association (an arrange-
ment which has obtained ever since).
The journal is still of the same
superficial dimensions, butthe number
of pages has been increased to
sixteen, and altogether it bears a
healthy, prosperous aspect.
In June, 1893, a total change is
made in the style and get-up of
the paper. A coloured cover of
excellent design—with a figure typical
of Federation as its centre-piece
—now makes its first appearance;
the size is increased to 14 inches
long and inches wide; there are
once more twelve pages (of the
enhanced size), and the printers are
Messrs. Fergusson and Mitchell. The
Traveller appears “to-day,” writes
the editor, in introducing the new
departure, “in a new, and we hope
attractive, garb. Undismayed by the
gloomy outlook of business generally
in the colony, the management of
The Traveller feel themselves justified,
by the paper’s past success, in launch-
ing a smarter and larger craft in the
wake of the little pioneer which is
now withdrawn from active service,
after a useful and prosperous voyage.
Though not exactly a leap in the dark,
we must confess to a certain feeling
of trepidation over the step we are
taking; but an implicit confidence in
the support of the commercial travellers
of Australasia goes far to remove any
apprehension of failure or loss. This
confidence was evidently well-founded,
for in the very next issue the manage-
ment were able to increase the paper
to sixteen pages; and by October,
’93, the press of reading matter and
advertisements necessitated an in-
crease to twenty pages. The first
number of Vol. 7 (June, ’94) finds
the paper still of the same size, and
containing twenty pages, but once
more, as far as the printing is con-
cerned, in the hands of Messrs. Mason,
Firth and M'Cutcheon, where it has
remained ever since. In October,
1894, there is a jump to twenty-eight
pages. In January, 1895, the pages
number 32; in June they are in-
creased to 36. With Vol. 8, No. 1
(June, 1895), the ornamental front
cover disappears, and is replaced by
the utilitarian, advertisement-gar-
nished vestment known to present
readers of The Traveller. In Decem-
ber, 1895, the first 40-page number is
issued, and this has since remained
the minimum.
The Traveller was the pioneer
travelling man’s newspaper on the
Australian continent. Up to August,
1895, it was the only one. Since that
date, and up to the present, its only
rival (an extremely friendly one) has
been the official organ of the C.T.A.
of New South Wales, originally known
as the NS. IV. Commercial, and now
sailing under brighter auspices as
By Road and Sea.
In The Traveller , the C.T.A. of
Victoria possesses a property which it
has good reason to be proud of. Its
career has been in some respects a
remarkable one. It moulded itself
in the first instance on an American
rather than on an English model, but
under stress of circumstances it has
been forced largely to hew out its own
character. At the present time it is,
so far as we are aware, the largest
commercial travellers’ paper in the
world, and is run on entirely different
lines to any other such publication.
We don’t set this fact out in any spirit
of self-glorification, but rather as a
curious phenomenon, that a small
province like Victoria should be able
to support a travellers’ paper so much
larger than the English, American, or
French publications of a similar cha-
racter. We have no wish for one
moment to assume the rather invi-
dious role of exponents of our own
success, but will be content to claim
that—(l) The Traveller has not been
built up without a lot of real hard
work; (2) From its first inception it
has consistently supported the
broadest possible view of things, and
the most disinterested programme
practicable at any given time; (3) It
has never wavered for a moment in
its advocacy of the Federal spirit,
which has lately embodied itself once
and for all in the United C.T.A. of
Australasia. These, we firmly believe,
have been the chief stepping-stones
to its present position, and that they
ever could be so is surely one of the
most honourable distinctions of its
readers—the members of the C.T.A.
of Victoria in the first place, and in
the second place the travelling men
of the neighbouring provinces. In
conclusion, we must not forget the
honorary literary assistance lent by
members, some of whom have been
most enthusiastic and loyal in their
support of the paper.
