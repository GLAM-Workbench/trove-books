COUNT CURLY'S COLD
One day Count Curly Wee awoke. His head felt
rather thick,
His throat began to burn and ache, his snout
began to prick.
He sniffed a bit and sneezed a lot; he looked
quite white and wan . . .
“Oh, bring a gargle, Jenkyns, please ! A cold is
coming on !”
Poor Curly Wee had DREADFUL colds. The
worst you’ve ever seen,
The kind of colds that simply sneeze at gargles
and quinine;
The kind that thrive on mustard baths and
antiseptic sprays,
The kind that make you deaf and cross, and last
for days and days '■
NO CURE
Not only Curly had the cold which made him
sneeze and squirm,
But all his Fur-and-Feather friends were
ravaged by the germ.
(Now, there’s a picture of the germ that
wouldn’t be defied—
About ten million million times it has
magnified.) f
“Dow, Doctor,” snuffled Curly Wee, Why don t
you dnow a cure ? .
It ought to be,” sniffed Curly Wee, ad easy
thigg, I’b sure.” , .
The Doctor sneezed a dozen times, his nose he
loudly blew, , ~ , , ~,
Then cleared his throat and sadly croaked, ‘I
odly wish I dnew !”


HE DOESN'T HAVE THEM
I said that everyone had colds, but, reader,
pardon ME
Among the Fur-and-Feather folk, one person
walks quite free.
Midst eats who sneeze and hens who sniff and
sheep who wheeze and cough.
There is one friend we all know well from
whom the germs sheer off.
“I don’t catch colds,” smiles Ginger Dick. “The
reason’s plain and clear.
It’s not because I take cold baths (I don’t)
throughout the year.
It’s not because I spray my throat . . .” (Now,
reader, don’t be vexed:
This speech of Ginger Dick’s must be continued
in our next !)
EXPLORER'S TALE
“■When I was once,” barked Ginger Dick, “ex-
ploring foreign seas,
I landed on an Island which had four banana
trees.
And there. I found a loTely flower with leaves of
blue and gold,
It’s called the Antifrigid flower, because it cures
a cold.”
“I took one sniff,” said Ginger Dick, “I took one
long, long smell ... ..
The scent was just like camphor oil . . , with
cinnamon as well • . •” ..
(His audience held their wheezy breaths to hear
the tale he told)
“ And since the day I smelt that flower I’ve
NEVER had a cold !”


"I'LL FIND THAT BLOOM!"
“I’ll find that flower,” cried Curly Wee. “I’ll
bring it to our town !”
Upon his rosewood table top he brought his
trotter down.
“I’ll find that Antifrigid flower which cures all
cold and rheum:
I’ll buy a yacht and sail away to find that
precious bloom !”
Like wildfire round the town it went, the strange,
exciting news.
“Count Curly Wee has bought a yacht on which
to go a cruise !”
The people crowded to the quay to see its size
and rig—
Count Curly’s yacht, all white and gold, the
graceful Flying Pig.
THE CREW
Of course, the Count must have a crew before
he sails away,
And no one can engage a crew in just a single
day.
But here’s the Captain, wise and brave, and, oh,
so span and spick,
He’s sailed before from shore to shore, has
gallant GINGER DICK !
And here is Gussie Goose on board, the FLYING
PIG’S First Mate. . , „, .
(I never told you Gus had gamed a Mate s
Certificate ? , .
It’s dusty now, but there it is, engraved and
signed and all— , . . .
He pins it up for you to see upon his cabin
wall.)


GETTING READY
The Stewardess is Mrs. Horse. They wouldn’t
say her nay.
She vowed she’d be a lot of help and never in
the way.
She carries basins all aboard, this cheery
Stewardess,
And what she means to use them for . . . I’ll
let my readers guess !
“Hi, Curly Wee,” said Mr. Fox, as on the quay he
stood,
“Do you want a Carpenter aboard ? At wood
work I am good.”
“No, thank you. Fox,” replied the Count. “Your
offer I refuse . .
(He doesn’t want that cunning Fox to join him
on the cruise.)
THEY'RE OFF!
Oh, see the gallant sailor lads who round the
capstan go.
They sing their Bnnny Shanties loud and gaily
squeak “Yo-ho !”
Oh look ! The heavy anchor’s up. The yacht be-
gins to sway.
The crew raise one tremendous cheer. “We’re
off, my lads, away !”
The crowd begin to cheer as well, the streamers
gay they fling, _ „
And little paws are wildly waved, as well as hoof
and wing.
“Good-bye, my friends !” “Good luck, my lads !”
“HJave lots of joy and fun !”
“Smooth passage, lads !” “Bon, bon voyage !”
(The last was Lady Bun.)


VOYAGE BEGINS
The sea was just as smooth as glass, the sky was
blue as; blue,
And high above, as bright as brass, the sun was
shining, too.
“Good-bye to land,” waved Mrs. Horse, “good-
bye my home, good-bye.”
For now the land was just a line between the
sea and sky.
Upon the bridge stands Ginger Dick, the gallant
Captain Dog.
Beside him are the maps he needs, likewise the
captain’s log.
He knows the Isle for which they sail, he knows
the course he holds,
To find the Antifrigid flower which is the cure
for colds.
THE SHIP IS HAUNTED!
As Curly Wee and Ginger Dick were poring over
maps,
Upon the Captain’s cabin door there came two
timid taps.
"Come in, come in !” cried Captain Dick, who at
his table sat,
"Why ? . . . what’s the trouble ? What is
wrong ?” he asked the Coxswain Rat,
The Coxswain Rat looked deathly pale. He
trembled and he shook, ,
“The trouble is,” squeaked Coxswain Bat, ive
been and seen a Spook. -
I’ve seen a figure gliding round that ain t or
mortal fur. ~
This yacht is ’aimted, Cap’n Dick. This yacht
is ’aunted, Sir.”


THINGS DISAPPEAR
How CAN the yacht be haunted ? Pooh ! ...
And yet, you know, it’s queer
The way that things . . . without a cause . . .
completely disappear.
Mate Gussie’s blankets went one night !
Now, how account for THAT ?
, . . "Because the ship is ’aunted, Sir !” squeaked
frightened Coxswain Bat.
And how account for Mrs. Hen ? You cannot
doubt her word.
She isn't fanciful at all, she’s such a tough old
bird.
“I saw IT with my very eyes glide past my cabin
door ! . . .”
“The ship is ’aunted !” squeaked the Rat, who’d
mentioned it before.
CURLY INVESTIGATES
At last Count Curly Wee remarked to Gussie
Goose, the Mate,
“The business of this haunting spook I must
investigate,
I can't be bothered with these tales. I must and
will have PROOF.
I’ll sit upon the deck all night, a flashlight by
my hoof.”
Oh, all was still as still that night, and all was
silent, too
(Except for sundry little snores and churning of
the screw.)
Count Curly Wee was wide awake as with the
Goose he sat . . .
Two hours passed by . . . and three . . . and
four .. . and then ... “I say! WHAT’S
THAT P”


"ITS HUNGRY!"
The Goose’s head was bowed with fear, and, oh,
what things he feared !
But oif the gallant Curly went to where IT dis-
appeared.
Down the companion way he crept with soft and
noiseless tread.
And saw a Shadow gliding through the store-
room door ahead.
The hold where all the food is stored, that’s
where the Shadow glides.
But on Count Curly’s massive head each bristle
now subsides.
“A spook who wants some FOOD,” he thinks,
“no spook at all is he . . .
I might have guessed ! It’s Mr. Fox ! Come
out !” called Curly Wee.
A STOWAWAY
Yes, there is Mr. Fox the spook ... I mean, the
STOWAWAY,
In Gussie’s stolen blankets wrapped; he’s un-
ashamed and gay.
“I told you, Curly Wee,” he smirked, “I wished
to join the trip.
Well, well. I HAVE enjoyed myself a-haunting
round the ship !”
Of course, they’ll have to keep the Fox —or chuck
him in the sea. „ ,
“And that’s an act I’d NOT allow,” insisted Curly
Wee.
“He’ll have to work his passage, though—and
work it hard at that!”
“Make no mistake, I’LL see he works I” replied
the Coxswain Rat.


ON THEY SAIL
On, on to And the Isle where grows the Anti-
frigid flower.
South, south and always south they steam with
every passing hour.
“Is that the Island ?” asked the Goose, “where
those two palm trees grow ?”
“Not itthe Captain shook his head, “We still
have MILES to go.”
And oh, the lovely, balmy days, with just a
little breeze,
The Horse and Hen upon the deck sit knitting
at their ease.
“This IS the way,” neighed Mrs. Horse, “to see
the wide, wide world.”
“It is indeed,” clucked Mrs. Hen, the while she
plam-ed and purl-ed.
JOURNEY'S END
And now the yacht—the Flying Pig—sails
nearer every hour
Towards the Island where there grows the Anti-
frigid Flower.
Brave Captain Dick stands on the bridge, a tele-
scope to eye.
And keenly scans a long black line against the
southern sky.
A smile lights up his furry face at what he
dimly sees.
An island, yes, without a doubt . . . and three
banana trees.
He waves his telescope on high, and barks:
“Count Curly Wee !
Come up and stand upon the bridge our jour-
ney’s end to see !”


GOING ASHORE
And now beside the Southern Isle the yacht is
in the bay,
“We’ll anchor here,” barked Captain Dick, “and
here the yacht will stay.
We’ll launch our motor boat for five (the boat
will hold no more),
And four of us, besides myself, will swiftly go
ashore.”
Then Ginger Dick stepped in the boat, and
Curly Wee, of course,
Jack Rabbit went, and Mrs. Hen, and also Mrs.
Horse.
“The Mate will stay upon the yacht,” the Cap-
tain told the crew.
“And when I have explored the Isle then you
can all land, too.”
THEY WANT TO GO TOO
The crew are left upon the yacht beneath the
Mate’s command,
And how they sulked to watch the five who
skimmed towards the land !
“No grumbling there,” snapped Gussie Goose.
“Your turn to land will come !”
. . . But Coxswain Rat and all the rest still looked
extremely glum.
“It isn’t fair,” snarled Mr. Fox, as cross as cross
could be,
“Why should Jack Rabbit go ashore before a
Fox like me ?”
The discontented crew looked black. They
gathered in a knot,
And groused amongst themselves because they
couldn’t leave the yacht.


DUTY FIRST
Meanwhile the boat is! just ashore; the shingle
scrapes the keel,
“I’m first on land !” . . . Jack Rabbit raised a
loud, excited squeal.
“On good dry land,” neighed Mrs. Horse, “It’s
very nice to be . .
“On terra flrma once again !” smiled cultured
Curly Wee.
“Now, first,” barked Captain Ginger Dick, “our
duty’s very clear—
We’ll And the Antifrigid flower, which grows
some miles from here.
No picking fruit, Jack Rabbit, please ! No bask-
ing in the sun !
We will have lots of time for that when duty
has been done !”
TEMPTED BY BANANAS
Now, while the crew—you know their names—
went off to find the flower,
Mate Gussie more impatient grew with every
passing hour.
He gazed at the banana trees which grew upon
the shore . . .
“Bananas !” sighed the greedy Mate . . . “Ban-
anas I ADORE !”
Oh, what a very dreadful thing'. The Mate be-
trays his trust !
He doesn’t try to fight against his wild banana
lust !
Look, look. The Goose has left the yacht of
which he has command,
And in a little rowing boat he rows himself
to land !


MUTINY !
As soon as Gus had left the yacht, the Fox ad-
dressed the crew.
“You see the way we’re treated, boys ? It makes
me mad, it do !
The Captain and the Mate go off and leave us
here,” snarled he,
“Look here, my pals,” cried Mr. Fox. “I vote we
MUTINEE !”
“We’ll take this yacht,’’ said Mr. Fox, with his
most winning smile,
“And then we’ll sail away ourselves, and find
another Isle . . .
And YOU’LL be captain, Coxswain Rat, instead
of Ginger Dick . .
(The Rat, who’d wavered, squeaked: “Aye, aye
. . . That bait had done the trick !)
"IT'S GONE"
Meanwhile, here are the other five who’ve gone
to find the flower.
“We’ll see it soon !” barked Ginger Dick, when
they had trudged an hour.
By jove ! Their hearts beat loud and fast to
hear the news he told—
To think that soon they’d see the flower that
cures the common cold !
“It’s on this patch . . .” barked Ginger Dick.
He stopped. The patch was bare !
The Anti-frigid Flower had gone ... It was not
growing there ! , , ,
The ground was trampled round a hole—a shal-
low trench and small—
But flower and root and stalk and leaves* tiiey
were not there at all!


ALL IN VAIN
Imagine how the party felt. (Perhaps you’d
better not.)
To think that it was all for this the Count had
bought his yacht.
To think they’d sailed these thousand miles
across the stormy main.
To find . . . oh, bitter, hitter thought . . . that
they had sailed in vain.
Count Curly was the first to grunt. “We can’t
do any more . . .
And colds will just be caught again, as they’ve
been caught before.
And sneezes, sniffs and coughs and croaks are
things we must endure,
Because (his grunt was low with grief) we’ve
failed to And the cure.”
WHO'S THIS?
The dismal five retraced their steps along the
way they’d come.
And even cackling Mrs. Hen was most depressed
and dumb.
All silent, and in single file, they walked towards
the sea . . .
. . . “Why ! There’s the Mate Jack Rabbit
squeaked, “asleep beneath a tree !”
Surrounded by banana skins (my word ! There
was a heap !) , , , .
The Goose, beneath the tree he’d stripped, was
lying fast asleep.
(With large bananas —forty-two !—the greedy
Mate was stuffed.
And that, I hardly need to say, is why he looks
so puffed !)


WHERE'S THE YACHT?
“Mate Gussie Goose !” snapped Ginger Dick,
“Why have you left your post ?”
The sleeping Mate woke up and stared las
though he’d seen a ghost.
“Where am I ? . . . Oh !” The Mate blushed red:
with shame his beak grey hot.
“Of course,” he muttered low with shame, “I
should be on the yacht.”
“I only took a little leave,” protested guilty Gus,
“Oh . . . Sssseee !” He raised his voice in hiss
incredulous.
“The yacht is gone 1 It isn’t there The
awful news was true—
Count Curly’s yacht had steamed away with all
Count Curly’s crew !
MAROONED!
This second blow falls very hard upon the
startled six.
“Marooned ! Marooned barked Ginger Dick.
“Of all the dirty tricks !
I see the Fox’s paw in this !—so cunning and so
sly.
Oh, if I ONLY had him here !” He shook his fist
on high.
“And Chick . . . my chick.” clucked Mrs. Hen.
“My precious little tot !
My darling little fluffy chick is still upon the
yacht 1
She’s stolen by the wicked crew She gave
an anguished yell, , , , , . . .
And Mrs. Horse, with outstretched hoof, just
caught her as she fell.


WHAT'S THIS!
“Look, Captain Dick,” Jack Rabbit squeaked.
“There’s something: on that log;
It’s floating up towards the shore,” he told the
Ginger dog.
“Its something fluffy, small and gold,” barked
watching Ginger Dick.
“It waves a little, skinny claw. It can’t be . . .
Yes ! . . . It’s Chick!”
Young Chick it was, and up she came upon the
floating spar.
They heard her cheep to Mrs. Hen, “I wouldn’t
leave you, Ma !”
The Fox said I could come like this, although 1
might get wet—
He sends his kind good-byes to you without, he
says, regret !”
A THOUSAND MILES AWAY
Marooned, marooned ! They’re all marooned !
Tbe word is like a knell
(Which is—in case you do not know—a solemn,
tolling bell.)
Oh, see them on the lonely shore, the gallant
little band,
Marooned a thousand miles away from Fur-and-
Feather Land !
Upon the glittering, dancing sea the sun is shin-
ing bright.
As far as any eye can see it is a lovely sight.
But though the sun is blazing hot upon this
gorgeous day.
The hearts of all the seven friends seem frozen
with dismay.


THAT'S BETTER
Then Curly Wee threw up his head in gallant
attitude.
“Our plight could well be worse than this ... at
least, I think it could.
But let us with courageous smiles accept what
Fortune brings.
Come, Ginger Dick, and all of you, let’s make
the best of things !”
Oh, see what cheery grunts can do ! They all
take heart again !
“At least we’re all alive and well—and peckish,”
clucked the Hen.
And Mrs. Horse quite brightly neighed, “Exactly
how I feel.
And even though we ARE marooned, I’m sure
we’d like a meal.”
"ARE WE DOWNHEARTED?"
Well, there they are upon the shore, a-sitting
on the sand.
They eat their first delicious meal, this gallant
little band.
Bananas (on a turtle-shell) are passed from paw
to hoof—
And only Gussie lets them pass, his beak and
eyes aloof.
The milk inside the cocoanuts is drunk with
shouts of glee.
(The cocoanuts, when cut in half, make goblets
as you see.)
Count Curly raises high his nut, his merry eyes
a-glow.
“Are we downhearted ?” Curly asks. And every-
one yells NO !”


WHO'S THIS?
The moon above the Island rose, and silver
bright it shone,
■While all the others slept that night, Count Curly
worried on . . .
“If ONLY we had saws and nails ! —the things
that we could do 1”
“Ahoy 1” Across the shining sea there came a
faint “Hulloo
"There’s something black upon the sea . . .
There’s something—large—afloat!
It’s rather like,” grunts Curly Wee, “a lumpy,
oblong boat !
There’s someone sitting in ... or on .. . this
floating thing I see . .
“Ahoy 3 Count Curly, is that you ? It’s Jen-
kyns, sir ! It’s me !”
SORRY HE'S LATE
It’s fentyns ! On a cabin trunk that’s strapped
to floating buoys !
It’s Jenkyns, Curly’s valet pig, who comes with
loud “Ahoys !”
Escaped from Mister Fox’s crew on Curly’s cabin
trunk !
(Now, isn’t it a MIRACLE he wasn't lost or
sunk !)
“I’m sorry, sir,” the valet said, “1 h’am a little
late.
I couldn’t steer this through the sea at h’any
faster rate.
The sharks were sniffing round me hoofs h’in
quite a nasty way,
And wouldn’t leave the trunk alone for h’all
that I could say !”


"I TOOK THE LIBERTY"
Then Jenkyns, quite correct and prim, as though
he were at home,
Began unpacking Curly’s trunk, laid out his
brush and comb,
And on the sand in neat array he placed the
shoes and boots,
And neatly on the nearest trees he hung up
Curly’s suits.
“And, sir,” the faithful Jenkyns said, “h’l took
the libertee
Of h’adding just a few more things yon might
be glad to see.
Some hatchets, saws and ’ammers, too; some
tacks and nails and screws,
H’and h’other h’odds h’and h’ends,” he said
“1 thought you'd like to h’use.”
THEY START WORK
Well, now our friends can build a house. They
have the tools, you see.
With hatchet clasped inside his hoof observe
Count Curly Wee.
The splinters fly on every side as loud resound
his blows.
The tree is rocking on its stump. Look out, boys !
There it goes !
While Curly fells the island trees, the Goose and
Ginger D.
Cut into logs of equal size the trunk of every
“It’s rather fun,’’ smiled Gus at first. But that
was his mistake.
“Oh, boy,” he panted later on, “Do all my
feathers ache ?”


THE HOUSE IS BUILT
Well, there you are ! At last it’s built, the house
upon the shore,
And WELCOME carves our Ginger Dick above
the entrance door.
Count Curly Wee, that cultured pig, writes
SALVE on the sand
(You ask your father what that means; I’m
sure he’ll understand.)
Hullo ! A sudden splash of rain. And then
another splash.
But what do all our comrades care ? Inside
their house they dash.
Oh, let the rain come pouring down in torrents
from the sky.
Our friends inside their lovely house are sitting
snug and dry
"LETS LOOK AGAIN?"
“Now, Ginger Dick,’’ said Curly Wee, some morn-
ings later on,
“About that Antifrigid Flower—l wonder where
it’s gone ?
There’s just a chance we’ll find it yet. Let’s
search the island through.’’
“We might as well,’’ barked Ginger Dick. “We’ve
nothing else to do.”
Next day they rose before the dawn . . . They
left a note to say
“Don’t worry when you find we’ve gone. We’ll
both be out all day.’’
Then off they set. the Pig and Dog, that very
early hour
To search the Desert Island for the Antifrigid
Flower.


DANGER THREATENS
Oh, Curly Wee and Ginger Dick, if you had
only KNOWN,
You’d not have left your sleeping friends inside
the hut alone.
You’d not have gone—as here you go^—to
search the island through,
You wouldn’t smile—as here you smile—if, if
you only knew.
Far, far away across the bay, which sparkles
blue and bright,
D’you notice something long and black against
the morning light ?
It’s like a moving centipede upon the ocean
blue.
It is, oh, children, yes it is, a Monkey Tribe’s
canoe !
WHAT IS IT?
“You’re very silent, Mrs. Horse. Is anything
amiss ?
Let’s see what you are staring at,” came Gussie’s
Jovial hiss.
The Goose looks out beside the Horse. He
opens wide his beak.
He gives a kind of strangled gasp, but, oh, he
cannot speak !
“Whatever’s wrong ?” clucked Mrs. Hen, who
walked towards the door,
“Why, is there something strange you see upon
the island shore ?”
She looked, she stared, she gave one cluck,
and in a faint fell down,
and with her fell the curtain door, Count
Curly’s dressing gown.


HUNDREDS OF THEM
And now I’ll tell you what was wrong, why
Gussie was dismayed.
Why Mrs. Hen .felt sick and faint and Mrs. Horse
afraid.
A tribe of Monkey Savages were landing on the
shore !
(This picture only shows a few, but there were
hundreds more !)
Towards the hut the Monkeys ran with spears
a-waving high.
And “Wugga-wug !” the chieftain shouts—his
monkey battle cry.
(All monkey chiefs shout that, you know, when
rushing to a fray—
As Scottish chieftains used to sing the song of
“Scofts wha’ hae I”)
CAPTURED
The Monkey Chief and Monkey trihe were full
of Monkey glee.
They captured all our friends and burnt their
h O'use, as you can see.
The Chief, in Monkey language, cried with sav-
age Monkey smile,
“We’ll take onr captives all away to live on
Monkey Isle !’•’
Away from sunny palm-fringed shore, across
the ocean blue.
See, see it crawling through the waves, the
Monkeys’ long canoe.
And what’s beneath that heap of rugs ? Alas,
I’d have yon know.
Bound claw and wing, tied hoof and tail, the
comrades lie below !


SEARCH ABANDONED
Meanwhile the Pig and Ginger Dick are search-
ing hour by hour
To find the plant for which they came, the
Antifrigid Flower.
In grass and undergrowth they seek, in sand
and leafy mould,
For traces of that magic flower which eures
the common cold.
No use. No good. It’s all in vain they’ve scan-
ned each yard, each foot.
They’ve found no flower of blue and gold, no
petal, leaf or root.
“Well, let’s go home,” barked Ginger Dick. “At
least we’ve earned a rest !”
(Ah, little do the couple know their home is
now non est.)
"GREAT DANES ALIVE!"
“We ought to see the hut from here,” remarked
Count Curly Wee.
They rubbed their eyes and looked again. No
hut could either see ! .
“Great Danes alive !” cried Ginger Dick, who
started running on,
“I must have gone completely blind ... or
else the but has gone'!’’
They ran to where the hut had been, to where,
upon the shore
They! found a heap of smoaild’ring logs and
no one—nothing more !
“The rest . . . our friends . . . where are they
now ?” asked Ginger’s broken bark.
. , . A tear ran down his ginger face, and
drowned a sizzling spark.


A CLUE!
The Dog surveyed the smouldering logs and
whined below bis breath,
“1 cannot bear to think our friends have all
been burned to death.
To think that Gus is roasted goose and Mrs.
Hen roast fowl;
That Jfenkyns now is roasted pork ! . . . It
makes me simply howl!”
But while down Ginger’s anguished face the
tears of sorrow streamed,
Within the eyes of Curly Wee a hopeful twinkle
gleamed.
He took his magnifying glass and peered in*
tently through,
“I’m sure they’ve not been burned,” he said,
“because I’ve found a CLUE !”
"HERE ARE TRACKS"
“Just look at these,” said Curly Wee to weep-
ing Ginger Dick,
“This hair from Mrs. Horse’s mane, this feather
dropped by Chick.
This wool is from Jack Rabbit’s tall, so fluffy
and so white ]
I’m sure our friends hare not been burned, but
captured in a fight !”
“Great Danes, you're right barked Ginger
Dick, whose hopes began to soar,
“And see those tracks —such lots of them—all
leading down the shore.
Our comrades have been dragged down there.
it's very plain to see J”
“¥es I Here’s where Mrs. Horse was dragged,”
observed Count Curly Wee,


WHICH WAY?
“They’ve all been taken out to sea. But where ?”
asked Ginger’s wail.
“Upon the surface of the waves they could not
leave a trail.
There’s not a sign upon the foam to show
which way they went . . .”
He sniffed and sniffed, but all in vain. “I
can’t pick up their scent.”
"Perhaps there is another Isle,” suggested Curly
Wee.
“If I ascend this lofty palm the further I shall
see.”
(Now, children, if the earth were flat, then this
would not be so—
But then, of course, the earth is round, as
doubtless you will know.)
ON THE HORIZON
Far, far away across the sea on the horizon’s
rim,
Count Curly thought he saw a line all purply-
black and dim.
"It may be cloud,” said Curly Wee, “but then,
again, it mayn’t—
Another island it may be, though far away and
faint!”
“Towards that isle,” said Curly Wee, “ —if »ts
an isle—we’ll go !”
. . . Oh, see them step inside the boat (they
have a boat, you know:
The boat in which, long weeks before, the Goose
had rowed ashore.) ,
Now watch them as they both push off ana
each take up an oar.


A BRAVE PAIR
Away they rowed, the Dog and Pig, their
friends to seek and save.
Ton must admit this gallant pair were both
EXTREMELY brave.
A weaker Fig and weaker Dog than these two
heroes were
Would not have risked their bristly skin nor
yet their ginger fur !
“Look, Curly Wee,” barked Ginger Dick, and
pointed ginger paw,
“When you were up that lofty palm it WAS
an isle you saw !”
fit looks a dreary island, too, so rocky, grim
and black.
But neither of the noble two would THINK
of turning back 1)
WITH MUFFLED OARS
Look, look I upon a rocky peak, and high above
the sea,
There stands a Monkey at his post. A sentinel
is he.
His back is turned towards our pair . . . they
mustn’t make a sound.
Oh, can they land upon the shore before he
turns around ?
The couple swiftly shipped their oars, and from
their pockets drew
Their mufflers (which, by luck, they’d brought
in case a cold wind blew.)
They tied one tightly round each blade to make
the muffled oar.
Then silently, without a splash, rowed., on to-
wards the shore . . .


GOT HIM!
Now up behind the sentinel the creeping pair
must pass.
“My goodness me,” thinks Curly Wee, “if only
this were grass.”
The Dog goes soundlessly along, but, oh, alas,
alack !
Count Curly’s hoof has struck a rock with noise
like pistol crack !
The Monkey sentinel turns lound as quick as
lightning streak.
He opens wide his monkey mouth, a wild alarm
to shriek.
But ere the yell can pass his lips, our Ginger
makes a bound—
The Monkey’s gripped by ginger paws and can-
not make a sound.
LEFT HIM BOUND
The mufflers (taken from the oars) around his
mouth , they bind.
Count Curly’s silken handkerchief ties both his
wrists behind.
With Ginger’s hanky (not so clean) they tie his
. ankles tight
And there they leave him, gagged and bound, a
truly comic sight I
Now onwards from the rocky shore the gallant
pair proceed , , , ,
(They walked upon all fours, you know, which
THEY can do with speed.)
They have to hold their heads well down, to
keep them out of view—
For if the Monkeys saw the pair—! Well, that
would NEVER do !


TOOK DOWN THERE!"
Count Curly Wee pokes up his head. “Look,
Ginger Dick,” grunts he,
"The Monkey tribe must live down there in all
those huts we see.
"And in that hut,” he added low. while gazing
from on high,
"Where stands with spear that Monkey Guard,
our captive comrades lie !”
Still nearer to the monkeys’ huts the pair of
heroes crawl.
At length they reach a pleasant field, with
grasses growing tall.
There, well concealed from any view they
quickly creep along . . .
. . . Now Monkey chatter they can hear and
bursts of Monkey song!
"WE'LL DIG!"
“I’ve got it!’ whispered Curly Wee. “I have a
lovely plan;
It’s what another Count did once—a Count
who was a man.
The Count ol Monte Cristo did what you and
I will do . .
“And what Is that?” ashed Ginger Dick. Our
Count said, "Tunnel through.”
They’ll tunnel down beneath the hut and come
up through the floor !
The Count of Monte Cristo dug for twenty
years or more—
But then he didn't tunnel in, he had to tunnel
out,
Besides, he only worked with hands and not
with nose and snout!


INSIDE THE HUT
Our heroes now had found a spade, but what
a work it is !
“Your turn to dig.” says Ginger Dick. “Phew !
It’s a weary biz !”
“Great Danes, my muscles ache like mad. But
now, unless I’m wrong,
We should be underneath .the hut before so very
long.”
Meanwhile inside the Monkeys’ hut the captive
comrades lay,
You’ll hardly see them in the dark, so huddled
up were they;
Their paws and hooves were tied with rope,
their wings and claws as well,
And all were feeling very low, as I need! hardly
tell.
"HERE I COME"
The captured comrades hold their breath as
through the floor appear
Two bright grey eyes, a smiling snout, a well-
known bristly ear.
Two grimy hoofs come through as: well . . .
“Hullo,” grunts Curly Wee,
“I thought I’d better come this way to set you
people free 1”
Old Mrs. Hen was overjoyed. She clucked and
clucked with glee.
“Oh, lucky, lucky hour for us I Oh, plucky
Curly Wee !”
“Sh ! Please take care,” said Curly Wee, “ —and
not so loud, I beg 1
The Monkey guards may look inside. They’ll
think you’ve laid an egg!”


SAFELY OUT
Some yards away, to Ginger Dick, the rescued
comrades go.
He greets them with a helping paw, and whis-
pers, glad, “Hullo I’’
(This picture cannot show them all, but be
assured by me
That everyone is safely? out except Count Curly
Wee.)
The Monkey Guard outside the hut thinks
with a happy grin,
“My captives are an angry lot. They’re mak-
ing such a din.
At least I know they’re safely there, because
they squeak and shout . .
(He did not know that all the noise proceeded
from ONE SNOUT.)
A SIGN
Count Curly mimicked all his friends for hall
an hour or more.
“They must he safely off,” he thought. (His
throat was awfully sore.)
“If they’re across that distant hill they’ll leave
a sign for me . . .”
Count Curly through the window looked to see
what be could see.
Oh, children, look ! Upon the hill there’s some-
thing waving white.
That’s Ginger’s sign to Curly Wee that every-
thing’s all right.
It means the friends are up the hill and half
way to the shore —
It means the Count can leave the hut and join
his friends once wore !


WHY DOES HE WAIT?
But why does Curly stand and stare at what
he sees below.
He should be off to join his friends as fast
as he can go.
What, in the Monkeys’ garden bed, has caught
Count Curly’s eye ?
Why does he stand and stare like that ? I ask
you, children, WHY ?
He’s looking at some lovely flowers . . . some
flowers of blue and gold . . .
(Aha ! You’ve guessed the reason, then. You
need not now be told.)
. . . The size . . . the color . . . and the shape
. . . Oh, happy, happy hour !
“At last I see,” grunts Curly Wee, “the ANTI-
FRIGID FLOWER !”
DISCOVERED!
Count Curly must dig up the flowers, not
merely pick or cut.
With utmost caution he has left the window
of the hut.
Now, see him as with silent hoof he scrapes up
every root,
Alia stuffs them in his pockets—which does
not improve bis suit.
“The noise has stopped inside the hut. There
isn’t any din.
That’s strange,” remarked the Monkey Guard,
“I’d better look within.
. . . You’re very silent,” he began, in light and
mocking tone.
The jest it froze upon his lips. The birds (and
beasts) had flown !


ALARM SOUNDED
One moment stood the Monkey Guard fast
rooted to the spot,
And then hei saw the tunnelled floor ... and
then he grasped the plot!
He looked outside the window next . . .
“THERE’S one of them !" yelled he.
(Of course we know the one he saw. It was
Count Curly Wee.)
The Monkey blows his hunting hom, he blows
it loud and clear,
From every hut on every side more Monkey
Guards appear.
Count Curly stuffs the final bulb inside his
pocket (hip.)
He grunts, while taking to his hooves, “By
jove, I'll have to skip !”
THE OTHERS WAIT
PTow while the pig was fleeing fast in order to
be free,
The other comrades on the shore awaited Curly
Wee.
“He should have got away by now,” thinks
worried Ginger Dick.
“I hope the Count has not been caught, I wish
he would be quick.”
“Well, while we wait,” said Gussie Goose, “I’ll
tell you what we’ll do,
Let’s be prepared to get away by launching
this canoe—
It is the Monkeys’ biggest one, the swiftest and
the best.”
. . . “And, furthermore,” neighed Mrs. Horse,
“Let’s break up all the rest!”


THEY'RE CHASING HIM
Count Curly’s making for the shore. He climbs
across the bill.
Biut, hark ! What’s that ? A sudden cry. A
whistle loud and shrill—
They’ve sighted him, the Monkeys have 1 They’re
after him once more !
Oh, will they catch Count Curly Wee before he
gains the shore ?
Jack Rabbit, waiting on the beach, first sees the
Pig appear.
“Look, look ! He’s rushing down the rocks !’’
Jack Rabbit gives a cheer.
“Hurray, hurray !” cries Ginger Dick . . . And
then the Dog looks glum,
Swift, swift behind the gallant pig the savage
Monkeys come!
WILL HE DO IT?
Oh, will he gain the shore in time ? I wonder
if he will ?
Oh, see him leap across the crags and down
the rocky hiU.
Behind his feet a trail of sparks ascend, a fiery
shower.
As on he dashes, waving high the Antifrigid
Flower.
His friends inside the long canoe (prepared and
now afloat),
Make all the rocky echoes ring with cheers from
every throat.
Count Curly’s panting with each breath, there’s
pounding in his ears.
But through it all, as in a dream, the friendly
yells he hears.


ALMOST CAUGHT
The Pig has almost gained the shore. He makes
a final spirt.
But, see ! A monkey hand has grasped his full,
ballooning shirt 1
(Poor Jenkyns, watching, gives a groan and
turns as white as milk,
“They shouldn’t grab ’is shirt like that. They’ll
spoil the tussore silk !”)
He’s caught ! No, no ! He’s pulled away. The
silk has ripped apart !
(A sight which very nearly breaks the careful
Jenkyns’ heart !)
“Come on, come on !” yells Ginger Dick, his
paw stretched out to aid . . .
Behind the Dog each comrade waits with ready
paddle blade.
MONKEYS DEFEATED
He’s jumped ! He’s caught the ginger paw !
He’s safe in the canoe !
(His jump well-nigh upset them all into the
water blue.)
The paddle blades flash through the waves and
dash the silver spray.
And how the comrades laugh with joy the while
they speed away.
“Destroy our foes !” the Monkeys screamed,
“Destroy 'em root and branch !
Launch more canoes !” the Monkeys yelled.
(They thought they’d more to launch.)
(You think that rhyme’s a faulty one ? Well,
be that as it may.
It’s right for LAUNCH to rhyme with BRANCH,
the Wireless Know-alls say !)


"I'VE GOT IT!"
Across the bright and sparkling sea the rescued
comrades go.
At first the Count is far too tired to grunt . . .
far less to row.
He sits in comfort at the prow with face of
shining bliss . . .
At length he grunts to all his friends, “See
see, I’ve brought you THIS !”
“The Antifrigid Flower !” they gasp, the Hen,
the Horse and Chick.
“The Antifrigid Flower, at last !’" cry Gus and
Ginger Dick.
“You’ve found the Flower that cures all cold.
We can’t believe it’s true !”
They gazed with joyful awe upon the Flower
of gold and blue.
WHAT COURSE?
But though the friends have found the Flower,
you all must understand
The problem is to get it home to Fur-and-
Feather Land.
And Fur-and-Feather Land, of course, is miles
and MILES away—
A thought which fills brave Ginger Dick with
something like dismay.
“Now, listen, all !“ barked Ginger Dick. “What
is the course to take ?
Shall we go on towards our home, or for an
island make ?
The latter way’s an easy one. The first is hard
to do . . .”
“Let’s make for home and blow the risk 1” re-
plied the gallant crew.


GUIDED BY THE STARS
See, Ginger takes his compass out, the home-
ward coarse to steer.
It is a task which well might fill a weaker
soul with fear.
(But if you're brave and try your best, be sure
you will not fail—
At least, that’s what THEY’VE always found,
the heroes of this tale.)
While Ginger scans his compass well, the home-
ward course to keep.
The others, in the long canoe, take turns to
watch and sleep.
. . . “'‘The stars shine bright !” cries Ginger Dick.
“And there’s the star for us !
It’s always brought me lots of luck, the Dog
Star, Sir-i-us !”
NO FOOD!
When morning dawned the Goose woke up,
and cheerful he was NOT.
He’d had a lovely breakfast dream ... of coffee,
steaming hoi . . .
Of golden scrambled eggs on toast ... of
porridge white with cream . , .
“It’s dreadful,” wailed the hungry Goose, “to
tfSke from such a dream !”
You see, they’ve brought NO FOOD AT ALL.
There’s none in the canoe !
They’ve quite forgotten things to eat and
drinking water, too !
. . . Poor Chicken longed to peck some food, so
ravenous she felt.
Jack Rabbit’s face was set and grim. He
tightened up his belt.


NOT A SHIP IN SIGHT
Poor Jenkyns, least of all the crew, can go
without his food.
(A butler’s used to tasty meals and everything
that’s good.)
You cannot see the embonpoint that used his
form to swell,
For that has gone with lack of meals, as I
need hardly telL
“1 wish,” said Captain Ginger Dick (all shrunk
inside his suit),
“I wish that we could hit upon a South Sea
trading route.
I wish a ship would pick us up . . .” The watery
waste he scanned.
But there was not a ship in sight nor any sign
of land.
THE ADMIRAL HEARS
Once more the wretched crew we see, still
starving, still afloat.
(The ones you cannot see are in the bottom of
the boat.)
“Oh, if my friend the Admiral,” came Ginger’s
wistful yelp,
“Could see the plight that we are in, I KNOW
he’d send us help !”
Explain this wonder, if you can ! I will not
even try . . .
The Admiral, who’d been asleep, woke up with
startled cry.
“I heard the bark of Ginger Dick as clear as
clear could be—!
I must send out my fastest ship to help my
friend!” *(ed he.


SAILING TO SAVE THEM
The fastest cruiser in the Fleet has left the
naval quay.
It’s off to look for Ginger Dick, to search
across the sea.
(These guns are only dummy ones, I think I
ought to state—
For Fur-and-Feather Folk don't fight; they
merely arbitrate.)
“All hope has gone,” said Ginger Dick, with
gloomy, sunken eyes.
“As captain of this gallant crew, I must apolo-
gise.
I should have known the plan was rash, that
it could not be done.
And now, I fear, we’ll starve to death. For-
give me, everyone !”
SHIP AHOY!
When Ginger Dick had made his speech, a
long, long silence fell.
Then Curly opened wide his mouth and gave
a faint, high yell.
He clutched his comrade’s ginger paw within
his levered grip . . .
“Look .. . look, I say! Far, far away !—a ship,
a ship, a SHIP r
Oh, see the starving, silent crew all roused to
life again.
♦<ITI tie my apron on my oar !” clucks hectic
Mrs. Hen.
Old Mrs. Horse waves Gussie’s coat and neighs
aloud for joy,
And everyone inside the boat just bellows,
“Ship ahoy !”


DANGER PAST!
The Admiral stands on the ship, his spyglass
to his eye.
“Aha !” He sees a tiny speck against the dis-
tant sky.
What makes him wave with sudden joy the
spyglass in his paw ?
(I’m sure there’s not the slightest need to tell
you what he saw !)
“They’ve seen us !” cackled Mrs. Hen, who
clapped her skinny wings.
“They’ve seen our signal of distress, our flag
of apron strings !
The ship has stopped. It’s changed its course,
and it’s approaching fast !”
“I thank my Star,” barked Ginger Dick, “that
all our danger’s past !”
RUMORS AT HOME
Although WE know the friends are safe and
know they’re homeward bound,
All over Fur-and-Feather Town false rumors
sped around.
. . . “Oh, have you heard,” baa-ed Mrs. Sheep,
“the dreadful news they tell ?
Count Curly Wee is drowned at sea, with all his
friends as well t”
In Colonel Bulldog’s club that day, inside the
Smoking Room,
The members were, in easy chairs, filled with
uneasy gloom.
“This paper hints,” the Colonel growled, and
shook his “Daily Yap,”
“That Curly Wee and all his friends have had
some bad mishap !”


TO HEAR THE NEWS
The streets of Fur-and-Feather Town at six
o’clock that night
Were empty, yes, from end to end, with not a
soul in sight.
It’s not because the citizens have lost their
coats or shoes—
No, it’s beeaiuse they’re all at home to hear the
Wireless News.
See, here’s the snare Announcer, who is at the
microphone.
(He has a soft, caressing voice, with such a
lovely tone).
He clears his throat in genteel way, the first
news to begin,
When someone thrusts into his paw an Urgent
Bulletin.
"COUNT GURIYS SAFE!"
Inspector Goat and Grace Owl beside the wire-
less sit.
They hear the suave Announcer gasp as though
he’d had a fit.
. . . “Before the S O S’s and the Weather
Forecast, too,
Here is a bit of splendid news that’s only just
come through.
Count Curly Wee is sale and sound, and so
is Ginger Dick,
And Mrs. Horse and Gussie Goose and Mrs.
Hen and Chick.
Jack Babbit’s safe and Jenkyns, too. They’ll
all be home quite soon.”
. . . See, Mrs. Rabbit has collapsed—but it’s
a happy swoon !


"NOT FOR US?"
There isn’t room upon this page to show the
waiting crowd,
We’d need two pages for them all—which
wouldn’t be allowed.
So, here in front are three old friends—they’re
foremost on the quay.
And if the crowd behind should PUSH, why,
they’ll fall in the sea.
The Cruiser nears the crowded quay. My good-
ness, what a fuss.
“I don’t suppose,” barks Ginger Dick, “those
cheers can be for US . . . ?”
“Of course they’re not,” grunts Curly Wee.
(That shows how nice they are—
All proper heroes NEVER guess that they are
pop-u-lar !)
ABOUT THE FLOWER
Next day in Fur-and-Feather Town the ques-
tion of the hour
Was, “Did Count Curly Wee bring back the
Antifrigid Flower ?”
And some said “Yes” and some said “No.” And
some asked Curly Wee,
But Curly smiled, polite and sly, and grunted,
“Wait and see !”
Then, pasted large on every wall in letters red
and white.
Were posters: MEETING IN THE HALL AT SIX
O’CLOCK TO-NIGHT.
All those with Colds are (ran the bill) Requested
to Attend,
And everyone is urged to bring a coughing,
sneezing friend !”


" YOU'RE COMING, TOO!"
Now, Orace Owl had cought a cold while wait-
ing on the quay.
He’s sitting snuffling by the fire. “No meeting
hall for me !
I’d give my cold to other folk, and that would
not be right—
It would be MADNESS,” said the Owl, “if I
went out to-night.”
RAT-TAT ! There's someone at the door. It’s
Gussie’s rousing knock.
“Put on your coat !’’ cries Gussie Goose, “It’s
nearly six o’clock !
Not coming to the Meeting Hall because your
cold’s too bad ?
He flung the Owl’s hat on his bead. “Oh, yes
you ARE, my lad !’’
"I'LL GET PNEUMONIA"
“This walk will kill me !” wheezed the Owl, as
through the streets they sped.
“When I’ve a cold my doctor says I ought to
stay in bed.
Why mast you drag me out like this ? I think
it is a shame !
I’ll get pneumonia and I’ll die ! And you will
be to blame !”
But Gussie Goose made no reply. He just in-
creased his pace,
And pulled the hooting- Owl along to Curly’s
meeting place.
. . . At last they reach the Town Hall door
where folk are pouring in—
In just another minute now the meeting will
begin.


WHAT'S UNDER THE CLOTH?
The Hall is packed from end to end. The audi-
ence sit in rows.
And, oh, the coughs, the wheezy breaths, the
sneezings and the “blows.”
The Doctor—next whom Grace sat—with gloomy
face affirms.
“Upon roy bleat, this atmosphere is simply
thick with germs !”
Count Curly Wee gets up to speak in pleasant,
tenor grunt.
“My friends,” says he, “this is no fraud, no
advertising stunt.
This is the Wonder of the Age !” cries noble
Curly Wee —
“This is the ANTIFRIGID FLOWER I’ye brought
for all to see !”
"WHAT ROT!"
Then Curly lifts the velvet cloth, and there, for
all to view,
Beneath a dome of glass it blooms, the Flower
of Gold and Blue.
The audience sit as though they’re stunned.
Their wheezy breaths they hold—
So that’s the Antifrigid Flower that cures the
common cold !
“Whoever smells this lovely flower,” went on
Count Curly Wee,
“Thereafter he from nasty colds forever shall
be free !”
The listening Doctor gave a sneer and bleated
low, “What rot !”
(All doctors are a bit like that; they’re not a
trustful lot !)


IT'S GONE!
Who’s first to smell the healing flower? The
audience feels quite shy.
. . . “All right,” hoots Grace Owl at last, “I’ll
come and have a try.”
A bout ol coughing seized the Owl and shook
his feathered frame.
But, “Up you come,” beamed Curly Wee, and
up old Orace came.
He sniffed the Antifrigid Flower, a long, long
sniff he took.
The audience quite forgot to cough. They mur-
mured, "Watch him ! Look ”
Then Grace lifted up his head. With joy his
visage shone,
He hooted clearly as a bell, “My nasty cold has
GONE !”
THEY QUEUE UP FOR IT
The Doctor, still distrustful, sneered, ‘‘There’s
something wrong,” said he.
"The Owl pretends he’s cured, because he’s
friends with Curly Wee.
Say Ninety-nine,” he told the Owl . . . "Repeat
that number, please . . .
Good gracious, yes, the Owl IS cured—l cannot
hear one wheeze !”
My goodness, how the audience cheered. They
almost raised the roof.
(The Doctor’s words were all they wished to
have as final proof.)
Count Curly formed them up in queues to sniff
the lovely Flower—
And, oh, the colds it cured that day—some
hundreds in one hour !


IT'S FREE
The Tale of Curly’s famous flower (of which
he’d several shoots)
Was passed along by squeak of beak, by chirps
and grunts and hoots.
And country folk from far and wide, from
warrens, hedges, folds,
Came trooping up to Curly’s house to cure their
nasty colds. ...
And Jenkyns, guardian of the blooms that shed
their healing power.
Leads all the sniffling folk along to smell the
magic Flower
And if they murmur, “What’s to pay ?” he
answers, “It is free—
My noble master wouldn’t DREAM of charging
any fee !”
WHAT'S BECOME OF THE YACHT ?
Now, some of you will want to know (if you’re
like Curly Wee)
What’s happened to the cunning Fox, who
caused the mutinee !
“I wonder, too,” mused Curly Wee, “what’s
happened to my yacht. . .
. . . Well, since you're all so keen to know, I’ll
tell you—briefly—what!
When Mr. Fox went off that day with Coxswain
Rat and crew,
He laughed, “Ha-ha ! I’ve got the yacht and all
the money, too !
I mean to see the world, and take a pleasure
cruise—
-111 go exactly where I please, and do the
things I choose I”


"IT PAYS TO BE WICKED"
•“Now, mark you, Rat,” laughed Mr. Fox, when
several months had sped,
"It PAYS to be the wicked kind. That’s what
I’ve always said.
1 steal, tell lies, desert my friends, do every-
thing that’s wrong—
Yet look at all the luck I’ve bad, how well I
get along !”
But hardly had he said those words than all
the sky went black—
Behind a flash of lightning came a sudden
thunder-crack !
It was as though to Mr. Fox there called the
voice of fate—
“l’ve heard your wicked, boasting speech. Ah,
Mr. Fox, YOU WAIT !”
SHIPWRECKED !
The Fox bad not so long to wait ... In just
fire minutes more
A storm blew up, the like of which you’ve never
seen, before.
It simply lifted up the yacht on which sat
Mr. Fox,
And dashed it with tremendous force upon
some jagged rocks.
The Fax and Rat have not been drowned for
there, you see, they are—
Both very wet and very cold, astride a floating
spar.
I do not pity them at all, and nor I hope do
you—
I think we ought to feel quite pleased when
villains get their due!


"SAY CURLY'S DROWNED"
The couple drifted on the sea a week or even
morev
Till Fate, relenting, washed them up on Fur-and-
Feather shore.
No crowd turned out to welcome THEM, which
one can understand—
Not only were they both disliked, but no one saw
them land.
“Remember, Rat,” barked Mr. Fox, while trudg-
ing to the town,
“When people ask, ‘Where’s Curly Wee V we’ll
say we saw him drown.
We’ll say that all were drowned but us. . . He
winked his cunning eye.
“And don’t forget,” he told the Rat, “you must
pretend to cry!”
"DREADFUL NEWS"
I think I’ll hide behind this tree and hear what
they’ve to say.”
“Good Gracious, Goat,” said Curly Wee, as side
by side they sat,
I haven’t seen these villains since they stole
my yacht away . . .
“I do believe here comes the Fox and . . . yes,
by jove! . . . the Rat!
The Fox approached Inspector Goat . . . “I’ve
dreadful news,” sobbed he
“We found no An tifrigid Flower and drowned
is Curly Woe . . .
The yacht is wrecked . . . the crew is lost . . .
there’s only Rat and I . .
“That’s right, sir squeaked old Coxswain Rat,
who did his best to cry.


“WE TRIED TO SAVE THEM"
“They've all been drowned,” wailed Mr. Fox,
“.. . the brave, the gallant creiw .. .”
<You’d think his tears were genuine and every
word 1 was true !)
“I tried to save Count Curly Wee and also Gus-
sie Goose . . .
But, oh ” <he choked as though in grief), “my
efforts were no use . . .”
“That’s right!” moaned cunning Coxswain Rat,
“I tried to save poor Chick,
I held up Mrs. Horse for hours, and also Gingeir
Dick . . .
But all in vain. They sank and drowned before
me very eyes . . .”
(I ask you, have you ever HEARD such dread-
ful, wicked lies ?)
CONVULSED WITH GLEE
Behind the tree, and listening hard, and quite
convulsed with glee,
Was <1 need hardly tell you this) our hero,
Curly Wee.
He heard the Fox describe the way that he
(the- Pig) had drowned.
Oh, how he shook and shook with mirth, al-
though he made no sound.
“As Curly sank,” sighed Mr. Fox, “he named me
as his heir.
He said I was to have his house and all his
books so rare.”
This barefaced fib was just TOO much, 1 think
you will agree:
“Did I say that ?” Count Curly asked, and
ped around the trele 1


WHAT A SHOCK!
“Count Curly Wee !” “Count Curly Wee!” Oh,
what a shock of shocks !
It was as though a bomb had burst beside the
Rat and Fox.
Count Curly Wee, whom they had left marooned
upon the Isle,
Now met the villains face to face with bland,
malicious smile !
“Inspector Goat,” said Curly Wee. “Arrest that
wicked pair !”
The goat, as usual, was prepared. He bad his
pawcuifs there.
Before the Rat could sneak away, or Mr. Fox
be gone,
The Goat had whisked the pawcuffs out and
fixed them firmly on.
THE TRIAL
The Trial of Messrs. Fox and Rat took twenty
days to run.
I’ll not describe the trial at length, for trials
are not much tun.
They’re only nice for Barristers and Lawyers
and K.C.’s,
Because they like to wear their wigs and pick
up lots of fees.
Count Curly in the witness box stood up so
straight and bold.
He promised he would tell the truth, and all
the truth he told.
It was the most impressive tale that any court
had heard—
The Jury hung on every grunt and not a
creature stirred.


HE DOESN'T CARE
ihe prisoners both stood side by side within the
prisoners' box,
The Rat was frightened, pale and cowed. Not
so was Mr. Fox.
You know, he didn’t show remorse. He looked
quite happy, too.
He gave back-answers to the Judge, which
prisoners shouldn’t do.
The Judge (or Beak) summed up at last, “You’ve
been accused,” said he,
“Of stealing by nefarious means the yacht of
Curly Wee.
The evidence has now been heard from Curly
Wee and you.
And now I want the Verdict from the Twelve
Good Mice and True.”
THEIR SENTENCE
The Foreman Mouse rose to his paws. “We
need not Leave this box,
We find them Very Guilty, sir—both Messrs.
Rat and Fox.”
“Then listen, Prisoners,” boomed the Judge,
“Your punishment shall be
That NEVER shall you smell the flowers
brought home by Curly Wee.”
So now in Fur and Feather Land when win-
ter winds blow chill,
The Fox and Rat alone catch colds which
make them feel quite ill,
Alone in Fur-and-Feather Land they sniff
and cough and sneeze—
It serves them both ENTIRELY right, as
everyone agrees.
