To THE
PARTNERS
OF THE
flortfv iHvttteï¿½ Hoan & ftntu^tnient
Gayfield Square,
Edinburgh, Dec. 13, 1860.
Gextlkmex, ? I believe most of you arc aware, that by some of your
number desiring to have a true view of your affairs, an Accountant was
brought from Edinburgh, in the autumn of last year, to inspect and re-
port upon your books. The individual now addressing you is that Ac-
countant; and I regret that I must detain you for a moment from the
proper business of this letter, to tell you how the investigation was de-
feated, and tliis letter becomes necessary.
It was stipulated by the Directors, that the information obtained by
the inspection should not be published?a stipulation very unnecessary,
if there was not anything to conceal?very improper, if there was, and
the Directors should not, by amending it, render its publication unne-
cessary. But assuming, from my experience of Directors hitherto, that
there would bo nothing requiring to bo published, I not only did not
dissuade from agreeing to the arrangement, but distinctly recommended
it; and even, to keep down surmises, secluded myself from every friend,
while I remained at Aberdeen.
There are two sets of accounts in this case ?those kept at Aberdeen,
of the transactions in this country; and those kept in Australia and New
Zealand, of the transactions abroad.
After I had been for nearly two months toiling through ton years of
these accounts, from the commencement of the Company in June 1839,
to the latest advices or entries in 1849, it fell to me to make some in-
quiries as to matters which the books, &c., did not render clear; and
understanding that there was to be a meeting of Directors on 24th Oc-
tober (1849), I, on 23d, issued my queries in the usual form, in a letter
to the secretaries, Messrs Jopp and Siiand.
Having been so long in their offices, I thought It both just and pru-
dent to put it in their power to say to their Directors that their accounts
appeared to be correct; and I added, I had apprised my constituents
that they had not only displayed perfect integrity, ? as might have been
expected, but great diligence, and I think ability, in obtaining such large
sums from so manv hands; with much interest, which is more difficult


still to obtain ; and 1 have remarked, that the money was in some cases
remitted the very day after the collection was closed ; and in others be-
fore it, in anticipation of the funds coming in, &c.?
There "were reasons for all this, into which I need not enter at present.
It is enough to say, that I only did my duty; and I (irmly expected that
in the end it would be useful both to my constituents and the Company.
? But, (I continued), I hare had e/reaf trouble ulth the accounts abroad; partly
from their extent, hut more 1 from the eompiieations into which the original
Manager in particular had led himself, ifrom 11 1 e inexplicable nature, also, of
the results, (namely, losing 1 in appearance nearly the whole capital of the Com-
pany,) I leave been compelled to loch at or'ginal documents only, and, that of
course, has wasted much time * " * ami the principle of the Books has
been so erroneous, dial great part of the Company?s losses, as shown by them,
is merely imaginary, and I am endeavouring roughly to show the true state of
affairs.?
'With this I enclosed my Queries; and on 2Gth October, or the day
after the meeting of the Directors, I received the following answer:?
?Mr Beottie, (the discharged manager, and as to whoso transactions I was
chiefly inquiring,) has not any official connection with the Company now, so
that the Directors could not apply to him as you suppose. But m dare say Air
Beattie will very readily afford you every information in his power, and if
you wish it, wc will ask him to do so.?
1 Lad not, however, been accustomed to be so referred. Resides, I
saw that the reasons assigned were hollow, and evidence of a determina-
tion to ignore the inquiry; for Air Beattie had not been exonerated
from the necessity of answering to the Directors, as to any part of his
management; and whose word could I take in such a matter, unsanc-
tioned by them? No written information, not coming through the Di-
rectors, to me, could be expected to have validity with them; and oral
information might bo misrepresented. I, therefore, found it necessary
to trust solely to the books and documents.
My researches among these, assisted me to very clear conclusions as to
various important points. I embodied my observations in two separate
reports, and placed them in the hands of my friends ; and that the Directors
might not be taken by surprise at the general meeting of the Company
to be held on ICth November, but come prepared to explain, and con-
cede at once, whatever might be for the interest of the Company, and so
really do business, I, in a letter dated 12th November, apprised them
as fully as I could of the contents of the reports; and there were various
points bearing strongly against the books, and of course, the Directors
by implication, for having so long allowed them to remain unchallenged.
Reasoning from previous experience, however, 1 expected that the
.Directors would not have hesitated to suffer the reports to be received ;
but it could now be shown that they had predetermined riot to receive
them, nor oeknmrkilye them, (to use the words of their secretaries,) ? what-
ever tnnjiif, be their terms.??
They also, upon the bare view given in my letter, denied the validity
of every one of my observations, in a letter from their Secretaries, put
into my hands while the meeting of the Company was convening; and
armed with my private note , as to their oivn accounts, and with this letter
of their own, which they had rendered it impossible to answer, and there-
fore held unanswerable, as to the Colonial, the secretaries entered the
meeting?read that private letter, so Jar as it serreil the purpose of the
moment (that is, so far as it established their own accuracy) ail Invi/um


I could not be present at the meeting; but from my experience of
professional men here, for now thirty years, I could not, in the circum-
stances, suspect any unfairness to myself; and I did not. That, however,
appears to have taken place. My letter was mutilated ; and my object,
and that of my friends, which were honourable, and honourably pursued,
instead of being fairly met, were very foully defeated.
Still the Directors might very easily and quietly have repaired the
injustice to the Company and to me, by receiving the reports, and acting
upon them, as far as might be proper. This was offered to them the
moment that I discovered what had been done; on their refusal, the
alternative now adopted was also put before them ; and they may yet
thank me that I suppress their answer. I feel exceeding!)- the unplea-
santness of this alternative; but I could not avoid it, without sacrificing
myself, and the just objects of my friends, to an obstinacy on the part of
the Directors, which I believe will be seen to be worthy of no respect.
It is hardly necessary to remind the Partners, that inter alia two divi-
dends have been paid to them of six or six and a-half percent. ; one in
autumn 1811, amounting to - - - - - L.3511 13 4
The other in autumn 1842, of - 3128 18 4
but omitted, as 1 Have the written testimony of several respectable men
to show, all reference to the fact of its being dated twenty-four days
before the meeting; and that, instead uf approving the Colonial accounts,
it declared the very principle of the hooks to be erroneous, u and so erro-
neous, that great part of the Company?s losses shown by them was merely
imaginary;? and they concluded by such confident assertions as to the
other points noticed by me, as it will be found distinguish the letter just
delivered, as already mentioned.
These documents, or pretended documents (for a document not set forth
ns it is, is no reed, document), coming upon my friends so unexpectedly?
men of great intelligence, but inexperienced in the business of public
meetings, and honourable themselves, not suspecting duplicity in others
?they were paralysed. They therefore omitted to demand the date of
my letter ; or to see it, and know if it had been fairly read; or to ask if
the answer of the Secretaries to the contents of my reports had been sub-
mitted to me in such time as to admit of my reply. They omitted all
these. The consequence was, that the secretaries and Committee c:f ma-
nagement not only- carried their point of escaping censure and farther
question, but in the triumph of the moment, obtained a vote to be car-
ried, as illegal as it must seem questionable in its motives, namely, ex-
cluding ani) future inquirij but such as Iheij miijht deem it prudent to per-
mit!
6C70 11 8
or about 18 per cent, in whole, on the capital first subscribed of L.50,000 ;
That on the strength of these dividends, doubtless, the Directors were
soon after enabled to double the capital, receiving even a premium upon
certain of the shares. Above all, much money has been borrowed, ?I
do not say whether properly or not, but certainly in contravention of a
very prominent clause in the contract. It seemed absolutely necessary,
therefore, that the management ofthe Directors should be candid, and its
correctness clear. My letter to them of 12th November ran thus :
? First, I have found what the Directors may not be aware of, that while pay-
ing dividends to the partners of the Company upon understood profits, arising
chiefly from interest, there were no profits to justify that, realized or realiz-
able. On the contrary, that an undcr-currcnt of interest was running against
the Company from the prices of properties purchased hut unpaid, that even in


the very first year made large deductions from the amount assumed to be
realizable ; that several hundreds of these amounts could not he realizable,
being calculated upon advances on adventures, in which the Company itself
was a partner ; that both in the first and second years, upwards of ï¿½15,000 of
the capital of the Company that ought to have been productive, had become
steadily unproductive, being lent to parties, who, though liable in heavy in-
terests, payable quarterly, were paying none ; while many thousands more
had been laid out on property that was not, at the purchase, expected to pay
immediately, (and in fact has never paid at all). Those were the Town
Lots, &c.?
?Next, The addition to the value of sheep stock, - - ï¿½2634 19 4
(another great ingredient izi the profits first divided upon), was merely an
addition by estimate ; and in addition to tins, was so strangely mismanaged
in the books, that after being written off in appearance to the credit of the
stock, and of Profit and Loss, it stood as an actual debt against the adventure,
and was one of those causes of seeming great disaster, that went to sweep
away the capital of the Company ; namely, by rendering it necessary to write
off a larger sum as loss, by all the amount of errors in this mode of dealing with
the supposed gains.?
It nia}' be added here, that from this and such like errors, as well as no
doubt from actual failures in the value of property, it became neccssaiy
to write offas follows, viz :
Losses up to June 1848, - ï¿½19,581 4 0
~ Dec. ~ - 21,257 8 10
ï¿½40,888 12 10
And at Dec. 1844, there is a farther writing oil, of 15,751 2 5
ï¿½50,589 15 1
Thus actually sweeping away, more than the - 50,000 0 0
of paid up capital of the Company at the time ; many heavy purchases
being made and in possession, on the payment of mere deposits ; and great
part of their value lost, before the funds began to be collected for their
payment : for the calls on the second subscription to capital only began
to be collected in September 1844 ; continued through that year, and
1845-6 and 7 ; and part still remained to be received in November 1849.
? Third, (1 continued) the addition in the books, of all the expenses incurred
in working the stock of the Company to the stock , instead of being placed in
an account of expense and income, has had the same effect of over-exaggerating
the seeming value of the properties.
? Fourth, The confusion of additions to stock, (which is not an expense, hut
an addition to property so called), with the expenses of the farms on the one
hand, and on the other of transfers of stock with profits, has had an equally
injurious effect. It has made it impossible to ascertain the state of either stock or
profits.
? Fifth, The introduction of supplies of stock and furnishings from one estate
or farm to another, cross entries of all descriptions, and even entries of per-
sonal debts and credits by individuals, into the accounts of the farms, has
made it impossible to see what the farms are doing .
? For example?ln the first and second years of Lochinvar, the debit, includ-
ing all things?price, purchase of stock and implements, expenses, and in-
terests, exceeds - - - ï¿½11,900 0 0
It has credits in appearance, e contra, exceeding - ï¿½1,590 0 0
and this has no doubt deceived the Directors. But upon examination, they
prove to be mere credits for furnishings from its furnishings to other farms ;
credits of wages paid for other farms ; and even credits for debts incurred by
individuals with the stewards ; but not in any way connected with the profits
of the farms.?


1 afterwards added, ?
? 1 hero is not, during these two years, credit visible for so much us a bullocks bide.'
and this is the truth.
? Sixth, Tlie omission of all narratives to bills granted and paid for the pro-
perties, except the simple numbers of the bills, has made it impossible to see or
even to guess, for what the bills were granted ; whether for additions to the
value of stock, for furnishings to be accounted for, or for actual and irre-
coverable outlays.?
And it may be added, that narratives to the entries, though so far satis-
factory, would have been of little real use, unless the contents of the docu-
ments had also been property separated.
? Seventh, The stewards? transactions have never been brought into the ac-
counts, (so far as I have noticed), hut only their balances. These balances
may cover no profits, or they may cover any amount of profits, and their ex-
penses may be irrevocable, or they may he additions to stock.
? Eighth, The accounts transmitted hither as to Kaw-aw, show nothing. They
ought to show all outlays under different heads, and reeite the same.
?Ninth, A very great error has been committed inclosing the cattle co-
partnery, with Dr Imlay, at December 1843.?
This error appears to be to the extent of - - ï¿½2379 10 10
exclusive of interest since December 18-13, till settled.
I gave the full particulars in this case as in the report issued to my Em-
ployers, but I cannot repeat it here. But to render it intelligible as far
as possible, I may state this, that when it began to ho seen that the spe-
culation must end in loss, Dr Imlay, from whom the cattle were for the
most part purchased, seems from time to time to have given up bills that
had been granted in part of the price, and remained unpaid, as interim-
payments to account of loss ; and the error appeared to proceed, from
having credited those bills to the adventure in the first instance, in place of
to the individual; as if they had been profits, and so diminishing the loss ;
and afterwards crediting the individual 'with the hills again , as interim-pay-
ments to account of this loss.
The entries are most obscure, and would seem almost purposely so ;
but they were at last understood. They arc as follows :
1841. April 13. B, P. 14. 15. not retired by Imlay as agreed on ï¿½ 582 11 0
But certainly meaning , not retired, by tlie Company, as agreed
on by Imlay.
July 0. B. P. 77. 78.?7!). (Imlay?s) - - 1500 0 0
1842. March. 22. 23. - - 1725 0 0
ï¿½3807 11 0
To add to their obscurity, they stand among clouds of
other bills and cross bills, ?no other way explained than as
has been mentioned ; and it was only the fact of seeing
Imlay debited for only - ï¿½2078 12 9
as his share of loss, in the very same entry that
debits the Company, his equal partner, with 6340 11 5
that led to the very troublesome scrutiny by which this, in
all events most irregular entry, was discovered.
The actual amount that ought to stand at the debit of
the adventure at Dec. 1843, is - - ï¿½14,915 3 0
But deducting the above bills, - 3807 11 0
Reduces it, (at least according to the books) to

But these bills ought not to have been deducted from the loss, till that
loss was divided, for they formed no deduction from it. I therefore saw
no reason to doubt but I had discovered a very material error, and its
source ; and with this closed my observations for the present.
The letter of the Secretaries, delivered to me as the meeting of IGth
November was convening, endeavoured to explain away the error in mak-
ing the dividends of 1841 and 42, by saying, that they were ? paid upon
the faith of the radut estimated upon the. property, which the state and
circumstances of the Colony at the time afforded every reason to believe
to be correct.? Bat this is certainly not the case by the books, except
as to the sheep stock. On the contrary, the dividend seems to have pro-
ceeded on sums of interest written off as realized ; though in many cases,
only due , and it may be added never realized ; while nearly equal sums
duo, e contra , were altogether overlooked, viz:?
In 1840, - ï¿½lBll IS 2
1841, - 2548 17 0
1842, - 2843 0 6
and in 1843, it rose to - 3131 18 7
However, the Secretaries adjoin, ? every shareholder of the Company was
quite aware,? ??that the dividends were paid upon the faith of the
value estimated upon the property,? and to the Shareholders I must leave
it. I believe my friends would have been satisfied if the sense of this
oversight had inspired a little docility; but as all confession of over-
sight has been declined, 1 need hardly mention that the law is this :?that
persons knowingly, or without due care, paying fictitious dividends, ? are
not only civilly liable to those whom they have so deceived and injured,
but guilty of a conspiracy, for which they are liable to be prosecuted and
punished.?
? With regard to what you say of the value of the sheep stock, (the secre-
taries continue,) it has escaped you that sueh is a fructifying' stock, and that
the value of increase is in such eases generally reckoned with the proceeds of
Sales.?
I have answered, and should have answered at the meeting, had op-
portunity been given me, that this could not have escaped me ; but that it
was not the point to which I chiefly spoke. What 1 most particularly
observed was, that this assumed increase had been ? so strangely'misman-
aged in the books,? that in attempting to write it off to the credit of the
stock, ?it had been turned into an actual debt,? and by a manage-
ment something like insanity', this is the fact. It has been forgotten to
credit if by an account of increase, before writing it off ] and so instead of
a profit, it stands a pure debt.
Nor lias the system of these books been reformed in this particular, as
will be shown before closing; for in the case of Kaw-aw, and in June
1816, a precisely similar error has been committed under the eye of the
present Manager, to the extent of - - ï¿½992 12 6
and stood uncorrectcd at November 1849.


With regard to this, however, and the management of the books in
general, it'has been told me emphatically, that ?the Committee of
Slanagemext are perfectly mlkfad that the accounts are in every it mi
strictly correct; and the Directors do not feel that it is neces-
sary TO DISCUSS THIS MATTER W ITH YOU.?
There was no appeal from this, but to the proprietors ; the)- must
therefore themselves discuss this mat ter ; and I can only say to them, that
it is required.
The Cattle Adventure. ?The explanation as to this is almost as
surprising as all the rest. According to the boohs, nothiny could he more
clear, than that an cyreyious and rery serious error had been coinmittid.
But the Secretaries'say, ? We have to state that no error whatever has
been made, and that Dr Imlay?s account was fairly and properly adjutsed,
and afterwards audited and entered by Mr Taylor.?
Here is the explanation,?
*? The portion of the Cattle Adventure retained by the Company after settling
with Dr Imlay, was the Delatitc Station, with the Breeding Stock, &c., thereon.?
I had discovered this with the greatest difficulty, but it has no re-
ference to the settlement.
? This portion of the Stock remained in the possession of the Company for
sometime afterwards, and was ultimately transferred to Captain Maync, in
exchange for his undivided half of the stock and right of grazing on the St
Clair estate, and the ont-stations formed by part of that stock and its inci'case,
viz. :?Bundinburra and Rozenthal.
The adjustment of Dr Imlay?s account was made in November 1842, and the
transfer to Captain Maync took place about a year afterwards ?(the transactions
having no connection with each other), and when the stock had fallen very much
in value. The loss, therefore, arose from the continued depreciation ; with
which Dr Imlay had no more concern than ho would have had with any profit
which might have arisen from an increase of the value, had that taken place.?
I answer to all this, That in the boohs there is no trace of a settle-
ment at Nov. 1842 with Dr Imlay or with any one else.
2nd, The very same entry of 31sï¿½ December 1843, that settles Dr Im-
lay?s balance, and hands over to him cattle valued at ï¿½2550, hands over
also cattle and other property to Mr Mayne, valued at ï¿½4200. There-
fore, whether these tw r o transactions had any connection or not, or took
place at the same time or not, they stand unico contextu in the boohs of the
Company.
There is no hint of a separate date, or of a separate valuation, nor of
any source of settlement separate from the books ; and nothing can remove
the error of L.3807, Us. over-credited to the adventure, and seemingly
ruling the loss, except evidence, that in this settlement, no attention teas paid
to the boohs at all, but the entries concocted from a separate source.
Dr Imlay?s own actual payments too, viz : L.3807, 11s. up to March
1842, seem to indicate a consciousness of what would be due from him,
and that it would be more than L.2078, 12s. 9d. But farther reasoning
is unnecessary. The original documents should be produced.
And whatever was the rule of settlement, and whatever the loss, upon
what ground was I to conceive that Dr Imlay was released until the ad-
venture teas finally wound up, as it seems to be at December 1843 ; and al-
lowed to escape with a loss of - L.2078 12 9
while the Company is saddled with - 6340 11 5
Making a difference against them of
This is a now question.
4261 18 8?


Therefore, l.rf, By all the rules of book-keeping, and of ordinary evi-
dence, this account shows an error against the Company, from a short
charge against Dr Imlay, that would now with interest, exceed L.3000 ;
or 2nd, If the books arc unworthy of being reasoned upon as regular
books, then at least, as mere notings, they show this, that by releasing
Dr Imlay before hi* time , the Manager has inflicted an undue loss upon the
Company' to the extent of - L.4261 18 8
Now, with interest at 5 per cent. . 1191 11 0
Equal to, - 5758 12 8
The Company must itself expiscate this matter. It seems to proceed
on grounds quite beyond the reach of a mere inspector of books.
The connection with Mayne, which is thus brought into view, seems to
have been little less disastrous than that with Dr Imlay, and quite as
badly managed.
St Chur was purchased from James Atkinson in January' 1841,
for - - - L.20,000 0 0
L.5000 of the price was to have been paid down, the balance of L.15,000
to lie on mortgage ; but already the capital of this Company was so over-
engaged, that bills fell to be granted for even the L.5000, and of these,
only one for L.lOOO, appears to have been paid when due. The bills for
the rest and interest, are so chopped and changed, divided to-day, agglo-
merated to-morrow ; always changing amounts, and seldom giving par-
ticulars, and mixed up with accommodations on the one side and the
other, that if this account does not defy scrutiny, it all but does it.
From the letter of the Secretaries, it appears that this estate had been
under stock by Atkinson and Mayne, and that the connection with Mayne
was continued. But it is not till after the separation from Mayne, in
December 1843, that there is any separation whatever of stock and estate,
or that we learn from the books, &c. that the estate consists of 11,746
acres. Again, though the estate belonged to the Company, exclusively, no
rent has been charged against the joint stock; yet the amount on mort-
gage alone cost the Company L.1200 a-ycar ; and at L.1200 a-year, Mr
Mayne?s proportion at 31st December 1848, would be L.lBOO 0 0
which is not charged.
Or was the estate purchased, wider burden of a free right of grazing
for Mr Mayne's stock? And not only for his then existing stock, but
for its increase ? If so, the purchase was a very' strange one; and if
not, then the inference is, that either for his existing stock, or its in-
crease, or for both, Mr Mayne ought to have paid rent, and he has not.
A stock-account was instituted in this case ; and had it been faithfully
kept it would have shown the interests of parties so far. But it lias
been kept with anything but care. Even by? it, however, Mr Mayne
was, at 81st Dec. 1843, indebted to the Company - ï¿½4430 0 0
It appears to have been then decided to let him also escape;
and according to the letter of the Secretaries, ho was to
receive for his half of stock and rights of grazing, cattle
&e., valued at ï¿½4200 0 0
and what they have omitted to add, ?? not
exceeding ... 2500 0 0
of the amount at his debit.?
His part of the stock on St Clair and its
out-stations, therefore, had been valued at
December 1843, at

I cannot follow this farther from my notes ; but, 1844,
Deo. 31, there is the following entry: ?
? Sundries Dr to W. C. Mayne.
? It having been arranged on 6th May last, to accept his interest in outstand-
ing and unsettled transactions, in final satisfaction of the Balance due by him,
at 31 Dec. 1843, as per Ledger, - - - ï¿½1230 18 9
The following accounts fall to be debited with the propor-
tion* which have gone, or shall go to their credit.?

But it is useless to waste ink ; his balance was ? ar-
ranged ? to bo wiped out, and it seems to have been so,
and something more; for he afterwards obtains cash, ... ï¿½B5O 0 0
and is only noticed to have paid, by ten horses at ï¿½lO, ... 100 0 0
and all this exclusive of the apparent claim for rent.
The loss to the Company, upon the stock and farm of
St Clair up to June 1848 appears to be - - ï¿½18,499 2 7
At that period there Is still stock on the farm, p. ï¿½2,070 0 0
AMr Rankine manages it, and just pays expenses; and no wonder;
for, though he has long been about the farms, of all the sales recorded by
him, while others were joined in management, amounting to ï¿½368 15 2
every farthing appears to have been ? bad,? except 20 0 0
received for sheep, and through another hand. Mr Mayne is still also
designated at St Clair, but if so, he pays no rent; so that this large estate
is a nullity.
It seems a doubtful plan to settle with flock-masters for their shares of
the ? clips,? when the wool is weighed instead of the money received.
There are instances in which I could not trace more than half the as-

The omission of credit here would be ï¿½212 17 0

The following are trifling ; but, like straws, they show the current,

I must now take leave of Australia. It is needless to torture the
Company with recapitulations of losses that are irrecoverable ; I have
spoken only where it seems necessary with a view to future utility. In
these two last instances, and in which the guarantees of the Parties
were doubtless strong ingredients in the original temptation to the Ma-
nager to embark, the interests of the Company seem to have been vo-
luntarily sacrificed, at least to the extent of the property relinquished ;
about - - ï¿½IO,OOO 0 0
Neither did all the other losses proceed ? from the fall on Colonial pro-
perty.? The losses from improper loans and bad securities were very
great. Yet scarcely greater than might have been anticipated, from send-
ing out, and to a new settlement, a man to act as a Banker and Money
Lender, who had been bred to neither. Nor are Farming and Cattle
Dealing the most simple professions in this country; yet the Purchaser
and Manager in the enormous undertakings of this description for this
Company, was ignorant of both.
Neither was it wiser to perpetrate what I have noticed at the eleventh
hour (and only at the eleventh hour,) Art. IV. of the Contract of Co-
partnery discloses, viz. That while it appoints a Land-surveyor to be
Manager of this Loan and Investment Company, it appoints ? John
IvAE, Writer in Aberdeen, Accountant to the Company in Australia.?
Mr Rac, from his education as a lawyer, might have been useful as an
Assessor to the Manager, had he known anything of Colonial, that is, of
English law ; but he was nearly the last to have been thought of as a
Commercial Book-keeper, without special trainini/. This designation,
too long unnoticed, accounts completely for the state of the books during


his management; and us liiï¿½ successor appears to have been bred under
him, that accounts for the rest.
There is an over-sight nearly as great, and perhaps more unpardonable :
and that is, in a Committee of professional men sticking up for commer-
cial books constructed by a ? writer,? or any one instructed by him,
after their errors in principle and in 'Mail, have been pointed out, in a
manner that ought to have rendered them palpable to the most limited
experience.
Here are a few of the entries, that must for ever render such books
useless, as intelligible records of sueli transactions.

Need I say that not one of these entries should have appeared in its
present state? These bills should all have been debited to the parties
receicing them , the farms only debited with the wages paid in lieu of the
slops; or with such other things as fell to be charged to them, from
properly classed accounts.
The cash payments during the same period, equally indefinite, amount
to L.lOBl 14 2
And the loss, in whole, amounts to L.14,181 15 0
But this, including the foolish estimated
profit of - - 2,634 19 4
turned into a debt;
but leaves still,
11,646 16 8
Neither have Mr Rac?s talents, as a legal man, been much more useful
to the Company ; for, on 11th Aug. 1840, Mr J. S. Clarke, Solicitor,
Sydney, obtains a loan of ... L.500 0 0
for six months, on ? Warrant of Attorney,? the most stringent of all
securities. But Mr Clarke never pays a farthing , principal, interest,
or expenses: and in December, 1844, the debt is wiped off, with the
simple observation, ? security bad.? Did it never occur to the Direc-
tors to ask, why bad ? Was there not a legal adviser? And if not.
why ? And if there was, are they not liable in Australia in the conse-
quences of taking a bad security, as they are in Scotland ?

A Mr Smith, also an Attorney, ruins sundry of the debtors of the

But I perhaps should not have mentioned these, had I not observed the

Mr Beattie does not seem to have followed any business; and ? Tho-
mas Clarke? may have been paying for ? J. S. Clarke,? on a claim in
name of ? Smith,? as the Company?s Attorney.
All those might have been explained in private, but the Directors
would not; and whose word else could I receive on such subjects ?
KAW-AW.
Kaw-aw is now the hope of the Company, and the immediate question
will be, are things bettor or otherwise managed there than at other
places ? and I answer, not in the least.
The outlays there have exceeded ï¿½34,600, and give rise to accounts
of several hundred entries, hardly one of which appears in the shape in
which it ought to appear; and as already mentioned, the very gross
error of turning an assumed profit of ï¿½992 12s 6d into a debt, is repeated
in this place.
To shew the entries as they appear, I extract the following :

The first payments for the Island were in December 1842 ; and were
I to give the entries for the six years, they would give no farther light,
than do those for these six months.
I do not know what the proprietors may think, but I am compelled to
repeat, that not one of these entries is proper. ?l must add, that no cash-
keeper could even do justice to himself by such accounts ; and the idea of
showing that he does justice to his employers , seems not even to be dreamt
of.
For example : ?The charges for stores should never be entered as these
are ; they should be entered in a separate account, and that account
should either balance or show a profit. Of course it should be balanced
by payments proper to the works, or by sales; and only the charges
proper to the works should go against them, as wages, salaries, furnish-
ings to buildings, &c., under their proper heads.
Then the disbursements by the clerics , of what do they consist? No human
being can tell that; but any one can tell this, that their ingredients should
appear distinctly separated ; as for wages, and other proper expenses,
all regularly classed. But in this case wc cannot even tell the amount
intended to be charged. For example : ?there is a charge in February
for disbursements by Mayne, ... ï¿½565 17 5
and in April, there is another charge, also stated to he for
February , ------ 608 16 8
Can any Director say from information, whether both these charges are
correct? and amounting to L.1174 14s Id? or is the last a repetition
of the first, with additions p. L.42 19s 3d? The disbursements for

January do not appear omitted. There are charges for ? March.
L.319 12s 7d; and L.IOOO 16s Bd, appears sufficient for April, May,
and June.
Neither are we allowed to suppose that these contain all the charges
for the works, except the furnishings ; For, in June 1817, they are
debited to James Menzies for one year?s salary, - L.850 0 0
No other salaries are articulately charged;?nor can it be known
whether this sum should be.
There are heavy charges through \V. S. Graham, all equally un-
classcd, and their contents arc doubtless very various. We sec that he
even pays cash for the establishment; thus ?1817, June, the place is
debited ?to Halley for law agency, - - L.150 0 O??
But in February 1818, it is credited on account of this
charge, with - ï¿½5O 0 0
? Paid by W. S. Graham , and wrong placed in Oct. 1847.?
It is impossible, I think, to see this from Graham?s account; or to sec
whether much more that has been charged separately, may not have
been so paid, and omitted to be deducted. All the charges in these ac-
counts also, ought to have been classed. In short, these accounts in
general, are not merely like rubbish shot down, containing all possible
different ingredients ; but worse?their ingredients cannot be separated
here, and abroad it seems not to have been dreamt of.
It appears to me very clear, that even for his own safety, a Cashier
should have his accounts in a very different state, if he wishes to he as-
sured that he has charged all that he has paid : and the least that this Com-
pany ouyht to he offered , is an Abstract giving them the satisfaction to
know what amount has been laid out in buildings ; what in furnaces,
implements and other permanent sort of property ; and next, what in sa-
laries, and to whom ; what in wages, and of what description ; what in
Law expenses, and for what; and generally, whatever is paid under all
other different heads of expense ; and this not merely through private
notes, but the regular entries of books properly kept. The items of a
proper balance-sheet could, with very few lines of narrative occasionally
interspersed, have shown all this satisfactorily. But no where at present ,
docs there seem to be a single account of a proper character ; and the
Directors seem either incapable of seeing that any change is required, or
determined not to see it , when pointed out by those whose property is thus
and every way imperilled.
To close with this management.?At November 1849, the accounts
from this quarter were in arrear since September 1848, or upwards of
12 months ; and the following glaring error remained uncorrected since
June 1846 :
(Supposed chiefly Sheep, and lost through the in-
capacity of Aberdeen the Manager.)

Total Debt at this date, 7129 18 11
But it seems to have been assumed, or the fact,
that at this period there was a balance of 992 12 6
" in favour of Mining account."
Deduct tide sum of L.992, 12s. 6d. from the
Debt, and the Balance against the Adventure
would be only 6137 6 5
But it has been attempted to write it off to Profit , and on
the principle usual in these books, the estate is debited u to
Profit and Loss," 992 12 6
without having first brought it to credit.
The balance of Debt therefore against the estate, instead of
being diminished, is augmented by all this supposed amount oj
Profit, or to ï¿½8122 11 5
Causing in reality a difference of ï¿½1985 5 0
Being double the amount of the sum placed on the wrong side
of the account.
That it remained uucorroctcd at June 1848, (the last balance
in the books, at the date of my inspection), is plain ; for the
balance against the Adventure was then stated at ï¿½21,203 5 0
But its real amount was 20,210 12 6
Difference as above, 992 12 6
I think the balance should have stood at November 1849, 28,935 2 11
But if the above error has not been corrected, it would
stand at, 24,927 15 5
and so downwards.
Yet these are the books as to which ? the Committee of Management
are perfectly satisfied, that the accounts are in every item strictly correct."
And ? the form of keeping the books? appears to be also so satisfactory,
that ? the Directors do not feel it necessary to discuss this matter ? with the
Uepresentative selected by their deeply interested Partners.
Notwithstanding the inhospitality of the Committee of Management,
in taking the very unhandsome advantage of a St ranger, to use such com-


munlcations as his were, as they did ; and by moans of them and their lo-
cal and personal influence, to defeat the just purposes of his friends, I
have not the slightest wish on the subject, but to carry the objects of my
Employers, and which I think ought also to be the objects of the Com-
pany in general.
They are, Ist, To have these Remarks, or the Reports to which they
refer, received and considered either by the Directors, or by some com-
petent person or persons as Referees. I proposed this at the very last
hour.
And next, that such errors should be corrected, and such changes con-
curred in, as should be shown to be proper.
Had these two simple points been assented to, this letter would not have
been necessary.
Since they were not, I must say thus publicly, that I adhere to all the
statements of error, &c. which I originally 7 made to the Directors, and
have repeated above ; and I add, that the ? form of keeping the books,?
(as the Directors have expressed it,) is erroneous in almost all particulars.
It is very irksome to me to go farther into particulars, but I must here
state in conclusion,
Ist, That estates should never be confounded with stock, but stand
clear: and that nothing should be added to the debit and seeming value
of estates, but such substantial improvements as really increase their value.
2d, That stock should, on the same principle, be suffered to stand clear ;
so as its actual state may be seen and known under all changes ; being
not even confused by the expenses of management; far less with debits
and credits wholly foreign to it and them.
3d, That the expenses of management of the stock, under distinct
heads?of wages, and other incidents, should stand ready to be con-
fronted with profits only ; after the balance of stock on band, being
added to the credits by sales, the profits, if any, should be distinctly
seen.
4th, The same with agricultural farms, and the wine farm :? expenses
should never he added to value, unless so far as they increase value, but
deducted from profits ; and if there arc no profits, then from stock.
sth, Neither should press payments in cash or bills, be entered against
farms or stock, unless they are for one specific purpose, and that made
clear. They should be entered against the parties to whom paid ; their
contents only, so far as proper, distributed and charged , under their pro-
per heads. Without this, there can be nothing but contusion; without
it there is no book-keeping.
But, in all departments of this Company?s business, bills of largo
amount are entered without distribution or explanation ; large payments
of cash, for the most various purposes, are entered in cumuli); stores arc
debited in masses, to individual properties, ami then these properties are
credited for the portions transferred to others. This makes a show of
profit, where there is no profit, but merely a diminution of charge; and
the balancing of the contents of documents so treated, is impossible.
6th, That all stores should be entered in Store Accounts, and ba-
lanced by sales or payments made by means of them; those payments
only being debited to the proper establishments, or in their expense
accounts rather ; and when their amounts were seen to he correct, (such
as the true amount of wages, &c.,) then they should be charged against
profits, and the accounts of expense and profits closed, by carrying the
balance to Profit or Loss,


By the mode of keeping the books of this company, nothing has been
seen, or can he seen ; no one can see how the stores obtained have been
disposed of, or whether accounted for, or not. Both the stores and the
wages paid from them , may have been charged for anything that can be
seen. The same with the sums paid to the Stewards. Even the im-
portant and peculiar establishment at Kaw-aw is being managed in pre-
cisely the same manner. Large sums are charged for stores, and con-
siderable sums are seen to be returned ; but no one can see the nature
of the stores got, nor their amount in the whole, nor whether they arc
accounted for in full, nor horn they are accounted for in any part. Any
sums may be charged whether in bills or cash, and any sums credited
whether little or much; there is no check upon any branch of expendi-
ture, because there is no distinct declaration of its amount. A man
managing for himself could not proceed in this manner ; upon every
occasion ho must be framing for himself the check accounts, of which
hooka properly framed consist; and as management permitted for a
Public Company, and that Company far from the scene of the operations,
it is hardly possible to characterise this management, it is so very un-
business like. If the manager does Lis duty to the Company, half his
time must be wasted in checking the transactions of the clerks, and after
all, doing it imperfectly.
And the errors committed in attempting to bring imaginary sums to
the credit of Profit, are wholly unprecedented. Yet these errors have
been committed again and again, and are not only permitted, but as the
Company will see, defended. It is needless to recur to the errors that
have been corrected, by sweeping them, and almost everything else,
away as Loss ; but Kaw-aw exists, an active and I sincerely hope a pay-
ing adventure. It will not seem to pay better, with a sum of
L.992 12s fid at its debit, not one shilling of which was over paid for it,
or ought to have stood there ; and I need not say that similar errors
may be repeated.
What was meant is perhaps very plain. It seems to have been thought
there was value in hand for L.992 12s fid, and that it ought to be brought
into view. But the plans adopted for effecting such objects have been
habitually improper; and I need not repeat, have led to serious actual
errors.
I should think there can bo no question, therefore, that not only
should past errors be corrected, but that measures should be taken to
prevent all errors in future. Such accounts are discreditable in them-
selves, without reference to their possible consequences. But these con-
sequences might be such, both without and against intention, that should
the Directors longer persist in their present course, they would seem
personally liable.
Even the accounts of the Secretaries arc very imperfectly branched.
Though I, after much -labour, found them correct in the main particulars,
and did not consider myself called upon to do more than lay the items
of certain branches before those entitled to judge of them, it would take
the same labour from any one coming after me, without the aid of my states,
to show that they have either fully received, or faithfully accounted in
any particulars. There is not a Director existing, or that has ever
existed, could answer correctly a single question, even as to these ac-
counts, and show that he was correct, unless abstracts have been made of
them, ot a very different character from what 1 saw. The necessity lb;
such clearness, does not appear to be felt as it ought to be, in any quarter :
and this all parties have been apprised of, for now upwards of a year.


In saying this, I am moved by no personal feeling : ?neither ought it
to be supposed that I have lightly committed myself to such statements.
I have distinctly pointed to the foundations of every opinion I have
given, and every assertion I have made ; and if my statements shall be
suffered to be overborne by mere petulant denials. I need say nothing
farther, but that I shall be surprised.
