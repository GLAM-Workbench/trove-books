ON THE
APPLICATION OP PHYTOLOOT
TO THE
INDUSTRIAL PURPOSES OP LIEE.
A POPULAR DISCOURSE.
Delivered at the Industrial Museum of Melbourne, on
3rd November, 1870,
FERDINAND YON MUELLER, C.M.G., M.D., Ph.D., F.R.S*,
COMM. ORD. SANTIAGO, KN. OP ORDERS OP AUSTRIA, FRANCE, PRUSSIA, ITALY,
WUERTEMBERG, DENMARK, MECKLENBURG, GOTHA ; GOVERNMENT BOTANIST FOR
VICTORIA, AND DIRECTOR OP THE BOTANIC GARDENS OF MELBOURNE.
Called upon somewhat suddenly to choose the theme for the
discourse of this evening, I made my choice unguardedly. I
anticipated in my thoughts how, during the intended instruc-
tive recreation of this hour, the bearings of intimate botanic
knowledge on many an industrial pursuit might readily be
demonstrated by some impressive facts. But on reflection, I
saw myself at once surrounded by so varied and bewildering
a multitude of objects, that to do justice in a few words to
my theme became a hopeless task. But while L offer this
mere introductory address for a series of lectures in the phyto-
logic section of this institution, we might learn by a rapid
glance over an area of knowledge singularly wide, that only
The Lecture mas illustrated by large wall paintings of ?Eucalyptus
amygdalina" (the most gigantic tree anywhere in British terri-
tory), of ?Br achy chiton Delab tehei ? (the Bottle-tree of Bast
Australia'), of? Cereusgiganteus ? (the huge Cactus of New Mexico);
also by numerous Vegetable Chemicals, and samples of Ram
Material; by about one hundred different hinds of Paper, from
various substances; by microscopic drawings of Starches; and by
a host of living Plants of medicinal, or economic , or industrial
value.


through many successive discourses, explaining subjects in
detail, the student can become aware of the importance of
phytologic knowledge in its relation to the industrial purposes
of life. In all zones, except the most icy, mankind depends
on plants for its principal wants. For our sustenance, cloth-
ing, dwellings, or utensils; for our means of transit, whether
by sea or land; indeed, for all our ordinary daily requirements,
we have to draw the material largely?and often solely?from
the vegetable world. The resources for all these necessities
must be?it cannot be otherwise ?manifold in the extreme,
and singularly varied again in different climatic zones, or
npder otherwise modified conditions.
"To render, therefore, these vegetable treasures accessible to
'Our fullest benefit, not only locally but universally, must ever
be an object of the deepest significance. Increasing require-
ments of the human races and augmented insight into the
gifts of nature render now-a-days quite imperative the closest
appliances of science to our resources and our daily wants,
? Omnis tellus optima ferat /? has become the motto of our
Acclimatisation Society; or let me quote from Virgil:?? Non
omnis fert omnia tellus, hie segetes, illic veniunt felicius uvae .?
Striving to unite the products of many lands, it suffices for us
nowhere any longer to discriminate among these resources
with merely crude notions; but it becomes necessary to fix
accurately, also, as far as plants are concerned, their industrial
value, trace their origin, test their adaptability, investigate
their productiveness, durability, qualities; and to reduce all
these inquiries to a sound basis by assigning to any species that
position in the phytologic system, by which it can be recog-
nised by any one in any part of the globe. When the wants
of phytography are satisfied we have to call to aid chemistry,
therapy, geology, culture, microscopic investigation, pictorial
art, and other branches of knowledge, to illustrate the respec-
tive value of the species, and the degree of its importance to
any particular community. But in the discussions of one
evening we can do no more than to touch succinctly only on a
few of those vegetable objects most promising to our own
colony for introduction, or most accessible among those
indigenous here; we may glance on them, also, with a view of
learning how their elucidation might practically be pursued,
and the knowledge thus gained be diffused. To aid in the latter
aim the phytologic section in the Industrial Museum is to be
established; of the requirements of this sectionl shall say a few
passing words.


The products and educts of the vegetable world are immense;
any display of them in the order of science, as intended for
this museum, must carry with it a permanency of impressive
instruction which any other modes of teaching, sure to be more
ephemerous, fail to convey. But these efforts at diffusing
knowledge should be seconded by means not inadequate to a
great object, and should be worthy of the dignity and name
of this rising country. Who would not like to see the best
woods of every country stored up here in instructive samples
?nearly a thousand kinds alone to choose from as far as our
continent is concerned'? Who would not wish to have here at
hand for comparison the barks, exudations, grains, drugs, as
raw material ? Who would not desire to have ready access to
a series of oils, whether pressed or distilled, whether from in-
digenous or imported plants'? Who would not have it within
his power to compare the starches, dyes, casts of our luscious
fruits, or the paper-material, tars, acids, coals of various kinds,
fibres, alkaloids, and other medicinal preparations from various
plants'?
Why not place here a series of all the weapons and imple-
ments, traced accurately to their specific origin? From such
even in many instances we have learnt, through keen observa-
tions of the first nomadic occupants of the soil, the use of
many kinds of wood. All these objects, crude or prepared in
the multitudinous way of their adaptations, ought to be accom-
panied wherever necessary by full explanatory designations,
microscopic sections, and other means of elucidation; while the
periodic issue of descriptive indices, detailing still more
copiously the derivation, uses, preparation, and monetary value
of such objects, will enable us to serve the full intentions
for which this museum section has been formed.
Lectures, however valuable, demonstrations, however in-
structive, cannot alone form the path of extensive industrial
education; most minds indeed prefer to dwell tacitly on the
objects of their choice, and muse quietly about the adaptability
of any of them for operations or improvements in which they
may be specially interested.
How many inventions have received their first impulse from
an institution such as we wish to form ! Investigators,
eminent in their profession, will doubtless unite here, sooner
or later, to bring to bear the sum of their knowledge, earned
by a lifelong toil, for giving vitality to that information which
is to enter guidingly into the ordinary purposes of life. Thus,
the happiness and prosperity of our fellow-men should be en-


hanced and exalted, and one of the loftiest objects of our
striving after truths be fulfilled.
But the unassuming worker, conscious how far his own
honest intentions advanced beyond his best results, may well
exclaim with Moore, in his soft melodies: ?
? Ah ! dreams too full of saddening truth,
Those mansions o?er the main
Are like the hopes I built in youth,
As sunny, and as vain 1ï¿½
* 7
Let us first take a glance at one of our innumerable
forest glens. We see in the deep rich detritus of rocks
and fallen leaves, accumulated in past centuries, some of the
grandest features of the world?s vegetation. Fern trees* rise,
at least exceptionally, to a height of eighty feet, higher, there-
fore, than any in other parts of the globe, unless in Norfolk
Island. Mammoth-Eucalypts abound, having in elevation
rivals only in the Californian Sequoia Wellingtonia; we may,
indeed, obtain from one individual tree planks enough to
freight almost a ship of the tonnage of the ? Great Britain.?
Todea Ferns, now sought in trade, occur in these recesses, ?
weighing, deprived of their fronds, almost a ton; and if the
Xanthorrhoeas do resemble, as popularly thought, our once
spear-armed natives, then the Todea stems bear certainly as
justly a resemblance to large black bears, as has been comi-
cally contended. The Fan Palms,t though only occurring in
East Gipps Land, within our territory, rank among the most
lofty of the globe, though also among the most hardy. All
this in our latitude seems astounding?but more, it demon-
strates also great riches; and I allude to it here only because
I wished to show how a vegetation so prodigious points to
the facilities of a natural magnificent industrial culture. The
complex of vegetation is always an indicator of the soil and
climate; as such alone, plants deserve close study. In this
instance it reveals untold treasures, and yet without phyto-
graphic knowledge they could never be understood, nor any
intelligent appreciation of them be conveyed beyond the
locality.
But can this grand picture of nature not be further em-
bellished 1 Might not the true Tulip tree, and the large Mag-
nolias of the Mississippi and Himalaya, tower far over the Fern
trees of these valleys, and widely overshade our arborescent
* Alsophila Australis, E. Br.

Labiatae 1* Might not the Andine Wax Palm, the Wettinias,
the Gingerbread Palm, the Jubaea, the Nicau, the northern
Sabals, the Date, the Chinese Fan-palms, and Rhapis flabel-
liformis, be associated with our Palm in a glorious picture 1
Or turning to still more utilitarian objects, would not the
Cork tree, the Red Cedar, the Camphor tree, the Walnuts
and Hickories of North America, grow in these rich, humid
dales with very much greater celerity than even with all our
tending in less genial spots ] Could not, of 400 coniferous
trees and 300 sorts of oaks, nearly every one be naturalised in
these ranges, and thus deals, select tanning material, cork,
pitch, turpentine, and many other products be gained far
more readily there than elsewhere in Victoria, from sources
rendered our own 1 Ought we not to test in these valleys
how far the Sisso, the Sal, the Teak, may prove hardy, and as
important here as our Blackwood and Eucalypts abroad 1
Or shall I enumerate all the ornamental woods for furniture,
machinery, instruments, which from an endless array of
genera and species might be chosen as introducable indeed
from most lands; many of these, perhaps, to find an asylum
in our mountains before?like in St. Helena and other
isolated spots ?the remarkable and endemic trees are swept
by man?s destructive agency from the face of the globe 1
Shall I speak in detail of the trees which yield dyes, and
many medicinal substances 1 If the Turkey Box tree should
continue the best for the wood-engraver, it would in these
valleys assume its largest dimensions. I do not hesitate in
affirming that out of about 10,000 kinds of trees, which
probably constitute the forests of the globe, at least 3000
would live and thrive in these mountains of ours; many of
them destined to live through centuries, perhaps not a few
through twice a thousand years, as great historic monuments.
Within the railway fences, hitherto in this respect unused,
trees might be raised as material for restoring locally the
sleepers, posts, and rails, prior to their decay. The principles
of physiology, the revelations of the microscope, and the
results of chemical tests guide us, not only in our selection
of the trees, but often teach us beforehand the causes and
reasons of durability or decay.
The longevity of certain kinds of trees is marvellous. British
oaks are estimated to attain an age of 2000 years. The Walnut
* Rhododendron arboremn attains a height of BO feet, while Rh
Palconeri rises to 50 feet, with leaves half a yard long.


tree, the Sweet Chesnut, and Black Mulberry tree, live through
many centuries, if cared for. Wellingtonias are found to be
1100 years old. Even the South European Elm, which since
the time of the Romans has also made Britain its home, is
known to stand 600 years. Dr. Hooker regards the oldest
Cedars yet existing at Mount Lebanon as 2500 years old.
Historic records are extant of Orange trees having attained an
age of 700 years, yet aged trees continue in full bearing
under favourable circumstances; a single tree is said to have
yielded in a harvest 20,000 oranges. Individual Olive trees
are also supposed to have existed ever since the Christian era.
The European Cypress, the British Yew, the Ginkgo, and the
Kauri afford other remarkable instances of longevity.
The Date Palm gratefully bears its rich crop of fruit for
200 years. The Dragon tree of Orotava is another familiar
example of extraordinary longevity. Here, in Victoria, the
Native Beech and several Eucalypts are veritable patriarchs of
the forests, and of a far more venerable age than is generally
supposed.
So much for the lasting of some of our work, to encourage
planting operations.

If Cook, who stepped with the pride of an explorer on
these shores precisely a century ago, could view once more the
scene of his discoveries, he would be charmed by the sight of
noble cities, and the happy aspect of rural industry; but he
would turn his eyes in dismay from the desolation and aridity
which a merciless sacrifice of the native forests has already
so sadly brought about ?a sacrifice arising from an utter
absence of all thoughts for the future. Ever since antiquity
this work of forest destruction has gone on in every country,
until sooner or later such reckless improvidence has been over-
taken by a resentful Nemesis, in hindering the progress of
national prosperity, and the comfort of whole communities.
After lengthened periods of toil there partially arose,
but partially only, what an early guardianship might have
readily retained for most countries. When I largely shared
in the labours of establishing for Australian trees a reputation
abroad, I certainly did also entertain a hope to awaken here
likewise a universal interest in the dissemination of an almost
endless number of trees from the colder and subtropic girdles
of the whole globe. (Vide Phil. Inst., 1858, p. 93-109.) A
few scattered trees are of no national moment. We want the
massive upgrowth of the Pitch Pines, just as on the Pine
barrens of the United States; we want whole forests of the


Deal Pines, both cis and transatlantic; we want over all our
mountains the Silver Fir, already the charm of the ancients;
we want the Australian Red Cedar, scarcely any longer existing
in its native haunts; we want the Yarrah tree, forestdike as in
West Australia; we want the various elastic Ash trees, which
are so easily raised; we want, indeed, no end of other trees,
because the greater part of Victoria is ill-wooded; because our
climate is hot and dry; because extensive coal layers we have
not yet found. What practical bearing can all the teaching
in this hall, all the display in this museum, really exercise, if
finally the artizan finds himself without an adequate and
inexpensive material for his work 1 Annually the timber of
150,000 acres is cut away in the United States to supply the
want for railway sleepers alone. The annual expenditure
there in wood for railway buildings and cars is ï¿½7,600,000.
In a single year the locomotives of the United States con-
sume ï¿½11,200,000 of wood. The whole wood industries of
the United States represent now an annual expenditure of
one hundred millions sterling. There 400,000 artisans are
engaged alone in woodwork. Here in Victoria, notwithstand-
ing the activity of many sawmills, we imported only last
year timber to the value of ï¿½270,572 for our own use. As
these remarks may find publicity, I have appended fur-
ther notes on timber trees, eminently desirable for massive
introduction, but do not wish to exhaust by details the
patience of this audience.
But it would be vain to expect that Europe and America will
continue for ever to furnish for us their timber. The constantly
increasing population and the augmented requirements of
advancing industries will render no longer yonder woods
accessible also to us before the century passes, because even
in those northern countries the timber supply will then barely
satisfy local wants.
An idea may be formed of forest value when we enter on
some calculations of the supply of timber or other products
available from one of our largest Eucalyptus trees. Suppose
one of the colossal Eucalyptus amygdalina at the Black Spur
was felled, and its total height ascertained to be 480 feet, its
circumference towards the base of the stem 81 feet, its lower
diameter to be 26 feet, and at the height of 300 feet its dia-
meter 6 feet. Suppose only half the available wood was cut
into planks of 12 inches width, we would get, in the terms of
the timber trade, 426,720 superficial feet at one inch thick-
ness, sufficient to cover 9f acres. The same bulk of wood


cut into railway sleepers, 6 feet x 6 inches x 8 inches, would
yield in number 17,780. Not less than a length of 23 miles
of three-rail fencing, including the necessary posts, could be
constructed. It would require a ship of about 1000 tonnage
to convey the timber and additional firewood of half the tree,
and 666 drayloads at If tons would thus be formed to
remove half the wood. The essential oil obtainable from the
foliage of the whole tree may be estimated at 31 pounds; the
charcoal, suppose there was no loss of wood, 17,950 bushels;
the crude vinegar, 227,269 gallons; the wood tar, 31,150
gallons; the potash, 2 tons 11 cwt. But how many centuries
elapsed before undisturbed nature could build up by the subtle
processes of vitality these huge and wondrous structures !
Some feelings of veneration and reverence should also be
evinced towards the native vegetation, where it displays its
rarest and grandest forms. It is lamentable that in all Aus-
tralia scarcely a single spot has been secured* for preserving
some relics of its most ancient trees to convey to posterity an
idea of the original features of our primeval forests. Though it
may appear foreign to my subject, I cannot withhold also on
this occasion an imploring word, more particularly when I
notice land-proprietors in East Australia to hold not even
sacred a single native Banyan-tree, which required centuries for
building its expansive dome and its hundreds of columnar
pillars; nor to allow a single Cyrtosia Orchid to continue with
its stem trailing to the length of thirty feet, and to remain
with its thousands of large fragrant blossoms the pride of the
forest. That very Cyrtosia gives a clue to the affinity and
structure of other plants, not nearer to us than Java; and its
destruction, with probably that of many others which the
naturalist for ever is now prevented to dissect, or the artist
to delineate, or the museum custodian to preserve, will be a
loss to systematic natural history, also, for ever. Again, in a
spirit of Vandalism, a Fan-palm, after a hundred years? growth,
is no longer allowed to raise its slender stem and lofty crown
in our own forests of Gipps Laud, simply because curiosity
is prompted to obtain a dishful of palm cabbage at the sacri-
fice of a century?s growth.
* On the River Hastings some magnificent dales have been lately
protected by the Government of New South Wales for the sake of the
incomparably beautiful and grand native vegetation, an example
deserving extensive imitation. The forests of the Bunya Araucaria,
occupying only a limited natural area, are also secured against in-
trusion by the Government.


Let it be remembered that the uncivilised inhabitants of
many a tropical country know how to respect the original, and
not always restorable gifts of a bountiful providence. They
will invariably climb the Palm tree to obtain its nuts or to
plait its leaves; so, also, a resident in our forests might obtain
from a grove of our hardy palms, if still any are left in this
land of Canaan, an annual income by harvesting the seeds as
one of the most costly articles of horticultural export.
Speaking of palms, let me observe that the tall Wax-palm
of New Granada (Ceroxlyon andicola) extends almost to the
snow line. It is needless to add, that we might grow this
magnificent product of Andine vegetation in many localities of
the country of our own adoption. Each stem yields annually
-about 25 lb. of a waxy, resinous coating, which when melted
together with tallow forms an exquisite composition for can-
dles. Chamaerops Fortunei, a Chinese Fan-palm of consider-
able height, is here hardy, like in South Europe; so would be,
probably, the Gingerbread Palm (Hyphaene Thebaica). Of the
value of some palms we may form an appreciation when we
reflect, that Flats Guineensis, which at the end of this century
should be productive in Queensland and North-west Australia,
yields from the fleshy outer portion of its nut the commercially
famed palm oil, prepared much in the manner of olive oil; the
value of this African palm oil imported in 18G1 into England
was two millions sterling, the demand for it for soap manufac-
ture, and railway engines and carriages, being enormous.* The
Chilian Jubaea or Coquito Palm grows spontaneously as far
south as the latitude of Swan Hill, and is rich in a melliginous
sap.t A Date palm planted now would still be in full bearing
200 years hence.
When hopeful illusion steps beyond the stern realities of
the day, it cannot suppress a desire that enlightened statesman-
ship will always wisely foresee the absolute requirements of
future generations. The colonist who lives in enjoyment of
his property near the ranges and sees a flourishing family
growing up around him, asks ominously what will be the
aspect of these forests at the end of the century, if the present
?work of demolition continues to go on] He feels that though
the forests not solely bring us the rain, through forests only
a comparatively arid country can have the full advantage of

ration of palm-honey.


its showers, as bitter experience has taught generation
after generation since Julius Caesar?s time. The colonist
reflects with apprehension, that while no year nor day when
passed into eternity can be regained, no provision whatever
is made for the coming population, in whose welfare, perhaps
as the head of a family, and perhaps even bearing political
responsibility, he is interested. He would gladly co-operate in
the labours of a local forest board, just like members of road
boards and shire councils enter cheerfully on the special duties
allotted to their administration. His local experience would
dictate the rules under which in each district the timber and
other products of the forest could be most lucratively utilised
without desolation for the future; and he would be best able
to judge, and to seek advice how the yield of the forest could
be advantageously maintained, and its riches methodically be
increased. All this will weigh more heavily on his mind when
he is cognisant that even in Middle Europe, in countries so
well provided with coals, and of a much cooler clime than ours,
the extent of the forests is kept scrupulously intact, and their
regular yield remains secured from year to year and from
century to century. He would rest satisfied if only the trifling
revenue of the forests could be applied by him and his neigh-
bours to an inexpensive restoration of the woods consumed.
He would delight in seeing the leading foreign timber trees dis-
seminated with our own Red Gum tree, Red Cedars, Yarrahs, or
Blackwoods, not by hundreds but in time to come by millions,
well aware that the next generations may either censure
reproachfully the shortcomings of their ancestors, or may
point gratefully to the results of an earnest and well-sustained
foresight of future wants. As a first step, at least in each
district a few square miles should be secured for subsequent
forest nurseries in the best localities, commanding irrigation
by gravitation, and ready access also, before it is too late,
and all such spots are permanently alienated from the Crown.
Physical science must yet largely be called to our experi-
mental aid before we can dispel the many crude notions in
reference to the effect of forest vegetation on climate in all its
details. It is thus a startling fact, as far as experiments under
my guidance hitherto could elucidate the subject, that on a
sunny day the leaves of our common Eucalypts and Casuarinas
exhale a quantity of water several times, or even many times,
larger than those of the ordinary or South European Elm,
English Oak, or Black Poplar; while from the foliage of our
native Silver Wattle only half, or even less than half, the


quantity of water is evaporated than from the Poplar or Oak.
This degree of exhalation, so different in various trees, depends
on the number, position, and size of their stomata, and stands
in immediate correlation to the power of absorption of moisture.
Besides, if the evaporation of Eucalyptus trees is so enormous
during heat, and if the often horizontal roots of these trees thus
render soil around them very dry, in consequence of the copious
conveyance of moisture to the air, they simultaneously, by the
rapidity of their evaporation in converting aqueous to gaseous
liquid, or water into vapour, cause a lowering of the temperature
most important in our climate during the months of extreme
heat, while their capability of absorbing moisture during rain
or from humid air must be commensurately great.
It is beyond the scope of this address to dwell further on
facts like these; but I was anxious to demonstrate by a mere
example how much we have yet to learn by patient research
before we will have recognised in all its details the important
part which forest vegetation plays in the great economy of
nature. Concerning forest culture, I would very briefly allude
to an instance showing how by the teachings of natural science
and thoughtful circumspection the rewards of industrial pursuits
may become surprisingly augmented. In the uplands of the
Madras Presidency an ingenious method has been adopted in
gathering the harvest of Cinchona bark, in recent very extensive
plantations, by removing it in strips without destroying the
cambium layer. Then by applying moss to the denuded part
of the stem, not only is the removed portion of the bark re-
newed within a year to the thickness of three years? growth, but
the protection of the tender bark against the influence of light
and air allows nearly all the quinine and other alkaloids to
remain retained in the cortical layer without decomposition,
while in the ordinary three years? bark half or more of these
principles is lost.
Facts like these lead us to appreciate the important bearings
of the natural sciences on all branches of industry; but they
warn us also to pause before we give our further consent to
the unlimited and reckless demolition of our most accessible
forest lands, on the maintenance of which so many of our
industries depend.
Just as it required, even under undisturbed favourable
influences, centuries before our forest riches were developed to
their pristine grandeur, so it will need, in the ordinary laws of
nature, at least an equal lengthened period before we can see
towering up again the sylvan colosses, which eminently con-


tributed to the fame of the natural history of this land?if,
indeed, the altered physical condition of the country will render
the restoration of the trees on a grand scale possible at all.
Has science drawn in vain its isothermal girdles around the
globe, or has the searching eye of the philosopher in vain pene-
trated geologic structure, or in vain the exploring phytographer
circumscribed the forms % Well do we know what and where
to choose; botanic science steps in to define the objects of our
choice, which other branches of learning teach us to locate and
rear.
The Tea would as thriftly luxuriate in our wooded valleys
as in its native haunts at Assam, and yield a harvest far more
prolific than away from the ranges. Indeed, we may well
foresee that many forest slopes will be dotted in endless rows
with the bushes of the Tea, precisely as our drier ridges are
verdant with the vine. Erythroxylon Coco, the wondrous
stimulating plant of Peru, should be raised in the mildest
and most sheltered forest glens, where the stillness of the
air excludes the possibility of cutting frosts. Hop, culti-
vated as a leading industry in Tasmania since a quarter
of a century, will also take a prominent place on the brooks of
our mountains. Peru Bark trees of various kinds should in
spots so favoured be subjected to culture trials. How easily
could any swampy depression, not otherwise readily of value,
be rendered productive by allowing plants of the handsome
New Zealand flax lily quietly to spread as a source for future
wealth. How far the demand of material for industrial
purposes may quickly exqeed the supply may be strikingly
exemplified by the fact, that hundreds of vessels are exclusively
employed for bringing the Esparto grass (not superior to
several of our most frequent sedges) from Spain to England,
to augment the supply of rags for the endless increasing re-
quirements of the paper mills. Conversion of manifold
material, even sawdust, into paper is carried on to a vast extent;
a multitude of samples placed here before you will help to
explain how wide the scope for paper material may extend.
But the factories want material, not only cheap, but readily
convertible, and adapted to particular working.
In all these selections, a few glances through the microscope,
and the result of a few chemical reactions taught in this hall,
may at once advise the artisan in his choice.
Phytologic enquiry is further to teach us rationally the
nature of maladies to which plants are subject, just as it
discloses even the sources of many of the most terrific and


ravaging diseases of which the human frame is the victim.
The microscope, that marvellous tool for discovery, has become
also the guardian of many an industry. The procesess of mor-
bid growth, or the development and diffusion of the minute
organism, between which descriptive botany knows how - to
discriminate, are thus traced out as the subtle and insidious
causes which at times involve losses that count by hundreds of
thousands in a single year, even in our yet small communities.
But while the microscope discloses the form and development
of the various minute organisms which cause, through the
countless numbers of individuals, at times the temporary ruin
of main branches of rural industry, it leaves us not helpless
in our insight how to vanquish the invaders. In correctly
estimating the limits of the specific forms, calling forth or
concomitant with some of the saddest human maladies, phyto-
graphy shares in the noble aim of alleviating human suffer-
ings, or restoring health and prolonging vital existence.
But it comes most prominently within the scope of this
industrial museum to delineate for the agricultural and forest
section, in explanatory plates, the morbid processes under which
crops and timber may succumb, and an industry be para-
lyzed or a country be verily brought to famine; it devolves on us,
also, simultaneously to explain the effect of remedial agents,
such as sound reasoning from inductive science suggests or
confirms. To array samples of all field products which our
genial clime allows us to raise is doubtless the object of an
instructive institution, more particularly in a young country,
to which immigration streams mainly from a colder zone ; but
this display of increased capabilities, and of more varied pro-
ducts of a mostly winterless land, may entice the inexperienced
to new operations without guarding him against failures. I
should even like to see tables of calculations in this museum,
from which could be learnt the yield and value of any crop
within a defined acreage and from a soil chemically examined;
but from this I would regard inseparable a close calculation of
the costs under which each particular crop can only be raised.
Unfortunately, surprising data are often furnished concerning
the productiveness of new plants of culture; but it is as fre-
quently forgotten, that the large yield is as a rule dependent
on an expenditure commensurately large.
Among the most powerful means for fostering phytologic
knowledge for local instructive purposes, that of forming col-
lections of the plants themselves remains one of the foremost.
No school of any great pretension should be without a local


collection of museum plants, nor should any mechanics
institute be without such. It serves as a means of reference
most faithfully; it need not be a source of expenditure ;
it might be gathered as an object of recreation; it may
add even to the world?s knowledge. Through the trans-
mission of numbered duplicate sets of plants to my office the
accurate naming may be secured.* From such a normal col-
lection in each district the inhabitant may learn to dis-
criminate at once with exactness between the different timber
trees, the grasses, the plants worthy of ornamental culture, or
any others possessing industrial or cultural interest. The
sawyer, as well as the trader in timber, may learn how many
of the 140 Australian Eucalypts occur within his reach ?how
phytography designates each of them by a specific appellation
acknowledged all over the globe. Phytologic inquiry, aided by
collateral sciences, will disclose to him beforehand the rules
for obtaining the wood at the best seasons, for selecting it for
special purposes, for securing the best preservation. Phyto-
chemistry will explain to him what average percentage of
potash, oils, tar, vinegar, alcohol, tannic acid, &c., may be
obtained under ordinary circumstances from each. He will
understand, for instance, that the so-called Red Gum tree of
Victoria, the one so famed for the durability of its wood and for
the peculiar medicinal astringency of its gum resin, is widely
different from the tree of that vernacular named in Western
Australia- that it is wanting in Tasmania, yet that it has an
extensive geographic range over the interior of our continent;
and that thus the experiences gained on the products of this
particular species of tree by himself or others are widely
applicable elsewhere. Through collections of these kinds the
thoughtful colonist may have his attention directed to vege-
table objects of great value in his own locality, of the existence
of which he might otherwise not readily become aware. New
trades may spring up, new exports may be initiated, new local
factories be established. Phytographic works on Australian
plants, now extant in many volumes, can readily be attached
and rendered explanatory of such collections. A prize
held out by the patrons of any school might stimulate the

packed, can be inexpensively forwarded by post, and by the excel-
lence of the Australian postal arrangements can be sent from distant
stations of the interior, from whence botanical specimens of any kind,

able; while full information on such material will at once be rendered.

faculties of a loftier understanding will be raised.
To the adult also, and particularly often to the invalid, new
sources of enjoyment may thus be disclosed. What formerly
was passed by unregarded, will have a meaning; every blade
over which he stepped thoughtlessly before will have a new
interest; and even what he might have admired will gain
additional charm; but while penetrating wonders he never
dreamt of before he ought piously to ask who called them
forth 1

A voice divine shall talk in each stream ;
The stars shall look like worlds of love,
And this earth shall he one beautiful dream.?

What one single plant may do for the human race is
perhaps best exemplified by the Cotton plant. The Southern
States of North America sent to England in 1860 nearly half
a million tons of cotton (453,522 tons), by which means, in
Britain alone, employment was given to about a million of
people engaged in industries of this fabric, producing cotton
goods to the value of ï¿½121,364,458. From Rice, which like
the Cotton will mature its crop in some of the warmer parts
of Victoria,* sustenance is obtained for a greater number of
human beings than from any other plant. In the greater part
of the Australian continent, wherever water supply could be
commanded, the Rice would luxuriate. I found it wild in
Arnheim?s Land in 1855. Of Sugar Cane the hardier varieties
may within Victoria succeed in East Gipps Land, and other
warmer spots. Great Britain imported in 1863 not less than
586,600 tons.t Even our young colony imported last year to
the value of nearly a million sterling (ï¿½948,329). Think of
the commerce in other vegetable products, such as require in
different places our local fostering care in order to add still
more to our resources. Of various Tobaccoes we imported into
Victoria in 1869 (deducting exports) to the value of ï¿½83,788;
of Wine, ï¿½84,687; of Cereals, ï¿½781,250; of Paper, ï¿½123,158.
I will not enter on any remarks about Sugar-beet, on which

one of our fellow-colonists has lately compiled an excellent
treatise. Of Tea, in 1865 Britain required for home con-
sumption eighty-five millions of lbs.* What a prospect for
tea growth in Victoria, where this bush cares neither for
the scorching heat of the summer nor for the night-
frosts of our lower regions; whereas in the forest glens of
our country, Tasmania, and elsewhere, the Tea-bush would
yield most prolific harvests. Test plantations for mani-
fold new cultures were recommended by me years ago in
one of my official reports to the Legislature; one planta-
tion for the desert, one for subalpine regions, one for the
deep valleys of the woodlands. The two latter might be
in close vicinity at the Black Spur, and thus within the
reach of ready traffic. The outlay in each case would be
modest indeed. What an endless number of new industrial
plants might thus be brought together within a few hours?
drive of the city, under all the advantages of rich soil, shelter,
and irrigation ! What an attractive collection for the intelli-
gent and studious might thus be permanently formed.
I will not weary this audience by giving a long array of
names of any plants resisting alpine winters, such as in our
snow-clad higher mountains they would have to endure.
We know that the Apple will live where even the hardy Pear
will succumb; both will still thrive on our alpine plateaus.
The Larch, struggling in vain with the dry heat of our open
lowlands, would be a tree of comparatively rapid growth
near alpine heights. The Birch, in Greenland the only tree,
in Italy ascending to 6000 feet, in Russia the most universal,
and there yielding for famed tanning processes its valued
bark, is living ?to quote the forcible remarks of an elegant
writer?? is living on the bleak mountain sides from which
the sturdy Oak shrinks with dismay.? Add to it, if you like,
the Paper Birch, and a host of arctic, Andine, and other
alpine trees and bushes. Disseminate the Strawberries of the
countries of our childhood, naturalise the Blackberry of
northern forest moors. The American Cranberry-bush (Vac-
cinium macrocarpum), with its large fruits, is said to have
yielded on boggy meadows, such as occupy a large terrain of

the Australian Alps, fully one hundred bushels on one acre in
a year, worth so many dollars. If once established, such plant
would gradually spread on its own account for the benefit of
future highland inhabitants. The Sugar Maple would seek
these cold heights, to be tapped when the winter snow melts
For half a century it will yield its saccharine sap, equal to
several pounds of sugar annually.
Let us translocate ourselves now for a moment to our desert
tracts, changed as they will likely be many years hence, when
the waters of the Murray River in their unceasing flow from
snowy sources will be thrown over the back plains, and no
longer run entirely into the ocean, unutilised for husbandry
The lagoons may then be lined, and the fertile depression*
be studded with the Date Palm; Fig trees, like in Egypt
planted by the hundreds of thousands to increase and retain

instead of the Mallee scrub; not to speak of the Vine in end-
less variety, nor to allude to a copious culture of Cotton in
those regions To Fig trees and Mulberry trees I refer more
particularly, because it must be always in the first instance
the object to raise in masses those utilitarian plants which can
be multiplied with the utmost ease and without special skill
locally, and which, moreover, as in this case, would resist the
dry heat of our desert clime. When recommending such a cul-
ture for industrial pursuits, it is not the aim to plant by the
thousand but by the million. Remember, also, that a variety
of the Morns Alba occurs in Affghanistan, with a delicious
fruit; and that the importation of Figs into Britain alone, from
countries in climate alike to large tracts of Victoria, has been
ot late years about one thousand tons annually. What tha-
Fig-tree has effected for rainless tracts of Egypt is now on
historic record.
I have spoken of horticultural industries as not altogether
foreign to this institution?indeed, as representing a rising
branch of commerce. Were I to enter on details of this
subject the pages of this address might swell to a volume.
But this I would mention, that in our young country the
manifold facilities for rearing exotic plants in specially
selected and adapted localities could only as yet receive im-
perfect consideration. We have, however, ample opportu-
nities of selecting genial spots for the growth of such singular
curiosities as the Flytrap plant (Dionrna Muscipula) and the
Pitcher plants (Sarracenias) of the bogs and swamps of the
b2


pine barrens and savannahs of Carolina, if we proceed to
moory portions of our springy forest land. There 18 no tell-
ing too, whether the Pitcher plants of Khasya and China
(species of Nepenthes) could not readily be grown and mul-
tiplied in similar localities, and the hardier of grand Epi-
phytes among the orchids, such as the _ subalpine Oncidium
Warczewickyi) of Central America, which might readily be
reared in our glens by horticultural enterprise, together with
all the hardier Palms which modern taste has so well adopted
for the ready decoration of dwelling rooms. _
Such plants as the Beaucarnea recurvata of Mexico, with
its 5000 flowers in a single panicle, and the hardier Vellozias
from the bare mountain regions of Brazil, would endure our
open air ; while the innumerable South African heaths,
Stapelise, the Mesembryanthema, Pelargonia, lily-like plants,
and many others, once the pride of European conservatories,
can with increased sea traffic now gradually be introduced as
beautiful objects of trade into this country, where they need
no glass protection. It leads too far to speak of the still
more readily accessible numerous showy plants of South-west
Australia, but among which, as a mere instance, the gorgeous
Anigozanthi, the lovely Styhdia, the gay Bauksise, and the
fragrant Boronias may be mentioned.
Before leaving this topic, I may remind you that many
esculent plants of foreign countries are deserving yet of test
culture, and, perhaps, general adoption in this country. _ ihe
Dolichos sesquipedalis of South America is a bean, cultivated
in France on account of its tender pod. The Arracha escu-
lenta, an umbellate from the cooler mountains of Central
America, yields there, for universal use, its edible root. The
climbing Chocho of West India (Sechium edule) proved
hardy in Madeira, and furnishes a root and fruit both palat-
able and wholesome. Vigna subterranea is the Earth But of
Natal. The Tara of Tahiti (Calocasia macrorrhiza), though
perfectly enduring our lowland clime, is as yet, with allied
species, but little cultivated ?neither the Soja of Japan (Cly-
cine Soja), nor the Caper of the Mediterranean. The Sea-
kales (Crambe Maritima and C. Tatarica) might be naturalised
on our sandy shores.
Regarding fibres, much yet requires to be effected by capi-
talists and cultivators to turn such plants as the Grasscloth shrub,
which I distributed for upwards of a dozen years, to commercial
importance for factories. A kind of Jute (Corchorus olitorius)
succeeds as far north as the Mediterranean, and grows wild


with the Sunn Hemp (Crotalaria juncea) in tropical Australia;
the latter plant comes naturally almost to the boundaries of
our colony. A Melbourne rope factory offers ï¿½3O for the ton
of New Zealand Flax, and can consume six tons per week.
Hemp, used since antiquity, produces along with its fibre
the Hypnotic Churras. England imported in 1858 Hemp to
the value of more than one million pounds * This may suf-
fice to indicate new resources in this direction. For Sumach
our country offers in many places the precise conditions for
its successful growth, as I confirmed by actual tests. Tannic
substances, of which the indigenous supply is abundant and
manifold, would assume still greater commercial importance
by simple processes of reducing them to a concentrated form.
How on any forest river might not the Filbert tree be natu-
ralised ; on precipitous places, among rocks, it would form a
useful jungle, furnishing, besides its nuts, the material for
fishing-rods, hoops, charcoal crayons, and other purposes.
From a single forest at Barcelona 60,000 bushels are obtained
in a year. (For these and many other data brought before you
in this lecture you may refer further, most conveniently, to a
posthumous work of the great Professor Bindley, Treasury of
Botany , edited by Mr. Th. Moore, with the aid of able con-
tributors.) Even the Loquat would attain in our forest glens
the size of a fair, or even large tree.
Osiers and other willows used for basket work, for charcoal,
or for the preparation of salicine, might line any river banks,
quite as much for the sake of shade and consolidation of the
soil as for their direct utilitarian properties. In the forest
ranges any dense line of Willows and Poplars will help to
check the spread of the dreadful conflagrations in which so
much of the best timber is lost, and through which the tem-
perature of the country is for days heightened to an intolerable
degree far beyond the scenes of devastation, while injuries are
inflicted far and wide to the labours in the garden or the field.
In the most arid deserts the medicinal Aloes might readily
be established, to yield by a simple process the drug of com-
merce. Gourds of half a hundredweight have been obtained
in Victoria, and show what the plants of the Melon tribe
might do here, like in South Africa, for eligible spots in the
desert land. Among the trees for those arid tracts, the
glorious Grevillea robusta, with its innumerable trusses of fiery

red and its splendid wood for Staves, is only one of the very
many desirable; just as in the oases the Carob tree will live
without water uninjured, because its deeply-penetrating roots
render it fit to resist any drought. But it may be said that
much that I instance is well known and well recorded ?so,
doubtless, it is, in the abstract?but variety requires to be
distinguished from variety, species from species, and their
geography, internal structure, and components need carefully
be set forth, before any industry relating to plants can be
raised on sound ground in proper localities, and be brought to
its best fruitfulness.
Even a pond, a streamlet?how, with intelligent foresight,
may it be utilised and rendered lucrative to industry! The
Water Nuts,* naturally distributed through large tracts of
Europe and Asia, afford at Cashmere alone for five months in
Vfche year a nutritious and palatable article of food to 30,000
people. Can the Menyanthes not be made a native here?one
of the loveliest of water plants, one of the best of tonics ]
The true Bamboo, which I first proved hardy here, used for no
end of purposes by the ingenious Chinese ?can we not plant it
here at each dwelling, at each stream, a grateful yielder to
industrial wants, not requiring itself any care, an object
-destined to embellish whole landscapes] An Arundinaria
Bamboo from Nepal (A. falcata) proved very tall and quite
hardy even in Britain; and yet taller is the Mississippi Arun-
dinaria (A. macrosperma) ?indeed, rivalling in height the
gigantic Chinese or Indian Bamboo.
Imagine how there might arise on the bold rocky declivities
of the Grampians the colossal columns of the Cereus gigan-
4eus of the extra-tropic Colorado regions?huge candelabras of
vegetable structure, which would pierce the roof of our
museum hall if planted on the floor, and would be as expan-
sive in width as the pedestal of the monument consecrated to
our unfortunate explorers. Picture to yourselves an Echino-
cactus Yisnago of New Mexico, lodged in the wide chasm of
our Pyrenees, one of these monsters weighing a ton, and ex-
panding into a length of nine feet, with a diameter of three feet.
Think of such plants mingled with the Canarian Dragon tree,
one of which is supposed to have lived from our Redeemer?s
time to this age, because four centuries effected on these Giant
Lilies but little change. Welwitchia here, like in rainless
Damaraland, might grow in our desert sands as one of the

most wonderful of plants, its only pair of leaves being cotyle-
donous and lasting well-nigh through a century. Or associate
in your ideas with these one of the medicinal Tree Aloes of
Namaqua, or one of the Poison Euphorbias, never requiring
pluvial showers (Euphorbia grandidens), some as high as a
good-sized two-storeyed dwelling-house; transfer to them also
Cereus senilis, thirty feet high, which with all its attempts to
look venerable only succeeds to be grotesque; add to these
extraordinary forms such Lily trees as the Fourcroya longseva,
with a stem of forty feet and an inflorescence of thirty feet,
whereas Agave Americana, Agave Mexicana and allied species, .
while they quietly pass through the comparatively short space
of time allotted to their existence, weave in the beautiful
internal economy of their huge leaves the threads, which are
to yield the tenacious Pita cords, so much in quest for the
rope bridges of Central America.
Some of the Echinocacti extend as far south as Buenos
Ayres and Mendoza, and would introduce into many arid tracts
of Victoria, together with the almost numberless succulents of
South Africa, a great ornamental attraction, which horticul-
tural enterprise might turn to lucrative account; just like our
native showy plants will yet become objects of far higher
commercial importance, than hitherto has been attached to
them. The columns of Cereus Peruvianus rise sometimes to ?
half a hundred feet; some Cactere are in reality the vegetable
fountains of the desert. Such plants as Echiuocactus platy-
ceras, with its 50,000 thorns and setae, should be cultivated
in our open grounds for horticultural trade, whereas the
Cochineal Cacti (Opuntia Tuna, 0. coccinellifera and a few
other species), might well be still farther distributed here, ih
order that food may be available for the Cochineal insects
when other circumstances in Australia will become favourable
for the local production of this costly dye.
These are a few of the many instances which might be
adduced to demonstrate how the landscape pictures of Victoria
might be embellished in another century, and new means of
gain be obtained from additional manifold resources.
But while your thoughts are carried to other zones and
distant lands, let us not lose sight of the reason for which we
assembled, namely, to deal with utilitarian objects and the
application of science thereon. All organic structures, how-
ever, whether giants or pygmies, whether showy or incon-
spicuous, have their allotted functions to fulfil in nature, are
destined to contribute to our wants, are endowed with their


special properties, are heralding the greatness of the Creator.
But here in this hall I would like to see displayed by pic-
torial art the most majestic forms in nature, were it only to
delineate for the studious the physiognomy of foreign lands,
irrespective of any known industrial value of the objects thus
sketched. The painter?s art in choosing from nature does
impress us most lastingly with the value and grandeur of its
treasures. Each plant, as it were, has a history of discovery
of its own; who would not like to trace it ? And this again
brings us face to face with those who carried before us the
torch of scientific inquiry into the dark recesses of mystery,
and shed a flood of light on perhaps long-concealed magni-
ficence and beauty. The youth, aroused to the sublime
feeling of wishing at least to follow great men in independent
researches, may be animated, if in a hall like this each divi-
sion were ornamented with the portraits of the foremost of
those discoverers, who through ages advanced knowledge to
the standard of the present day.
? Deeds of great men all remind us
We can make our lives sublime,
And departing leave behind us
Footprints on the sands of time.
? Though oft depressed and lonely,
Our fears are laid aside,
If we remember only
Such also lived and died.
? Learn from the grand old masters,
Or from the bard sublime,
Whose distant footsteps echo
Through the corridor of time.?
Longfellow.
Discovery proceeds step by step. Commenced by original
thinkers enlarged by sedulous experimenters, fostered by
the thoughtful portion of the community, and by any admin-
high views, it is utilised by well-directed enter-
prise, and marches onward steadily in its progress. Gutten-
berg and his collaborators gave us the printing art, which has
done more to enlighten the world than all other mechanisms
taken together; and though four centuries have altered much in
the speed and cost of producing prints, they have not materially
changed the forms of this glorious art, as the beautifully-
decorated pages of the earliest printed bibles testify. Thus
we have reason to be yet daily grateful for this invaluable
gain from the genius of days long passed.


Thoughtless criticism is but too often impatient of success,
and demands results premature and unreasonable. Incom-
petent and perversive censure may even carry the sway of
public opinion?misleading, and misled; and still worse
organised tactics may apply themselves, for sinister purposes
of their own, to disturb the quiet work of the discoverer, mar
the results of his labours, or paralyse the vitality of research,
not understanding, or not wishing to understand, its direction
or its object. .
And yet, should we have no faith in science, whether it
reveals to us the minutest organisms in a perfection unalter-
able,* or the grandest doctrines of truth, sure ever to bear on
human happiness and the peace of our soul; should we have
no faith in science, whether it unravels the metallic treasures
of the depth and the coals of the forests of bygone ages,
or by eternal laws permits us to trace the orbits of endless
celestial worlds through space; no faith, if it allows us through
spectroscopic marvels to count unerringly the billions of oscil-
lations of each ray of dispersed light within a second ;or
if it discloses the chemism of distant worlds, and therewith an
applicability of research, both tellurial and sidereal, ever
endless and inexhaustible. Science, as the exponent of God-
like laws, draws us in deepest veneration to the power divine.
That is true science!
? As into tints of sevenfold ray
Breaks soft the silvery shimmering white;
As fade the sevenfold tints away.
And all the rainbow melts in light;
So from the Iris sportive call
Each magic tint the eye to chain,
And now let truth unite them all,
And light its single stream regain.?

the brilliant anilin colours, and brought about an almost total
change in many dye processes, how many new wonders
may not be disclosed to technology by the rapid strides
of organic chemistry 1 ? As is well-known, three or four chemic
elements are only engaged in forming numberless organic
compounds, by a slight increase or decrease or rearrangement
of the atomic molecules, constructing, for instance, from these
three or four elements, ever present and ever attainable, the
deadly Hydrocyanic Acid, the terrible Atropin, or the dreadful
Aconitin at one time ; or at another time, harmless Ammonia
combinations universally used for culinary and other purposes
of daily life. Our wood-tars, we may remember, are left as
yet almost unexamined as regards their chemic constituents,
hew of our timbers have been chemically analysed; few other
of our vegetable products are as yet accurately tested. What
an endless expanse for exploration does organic chemistry thus
offer us! We are called on, among a thousand things, to trace
out similar mutual relation and counteraction of such extremely
powerful plants as the Belladonna and Calabar Bean. Here
medicine, chemistry, and phytology, go hand in hand. How,
again, is any analysis of the chemic constituents of any plant,
for cultural purposes or otherwise, to be applied, unless we
command a language of phytographic expressions, which will
name with never-failing precision the object before us, and
give to its elucidation value and stability?
We may speak chemically of potash plants, lime plants,
and so forth; we may wish to define thereby the direction of
certain industrial pursuits, and we may safely thereby foretell
what plants can be raised profitably on any particular soil or
with the use of any particular manure ; but how is this know-
ledge to be fixed without exact phytologic information, or how
is the knowledge to be applied, if we are to trust to vernacular
names, perplexing even within the area of a small colony, and
useless, as a rule, beyond it? Colonial Box trees by dozens, yet
all distinct, and utterly unlike Turkey Box; colonial Myrtle,
without the remotest resemblance to the poet?s myrtle; colonial
Oaks, analogous to those Indian trees, which as Casuarinse
were distinguished so graphically by Rumpf already 200
years ago, but without a trace of similarity to any real oak
afford instances of our confused and ludicrous vernacular
appellations. A total change is demanded, resting on the
rational observations and deductions which science already
]as gained for us. Assuredly, with any claims to ordinary
intelligence, we ought to banish such designations, not only


from museum collections, but also from the dictionary of the
artisan.
One of the genera of Mushrooms, certainly the largest of
them (Agaricus), contains alone about a thousand species
well distinguished from each other, a good many even oc-
curring in this country. For the practical purposes of
common life it becomes an object to distinguish the many
wholesome from the multitude of deleterious kinds, or
the circumstances under which the harmless sorts may be-
come hurtful. In France the cultivation of mushrooms in
underground caverns has become a branch of industry not
altogether unimportant. How, in other instances, is many a
culinary vegetable to be distinguished from the poison herb
without the microscope of the phytographer being applied to
dissections, or without the language of science recording the
characters ? How many a life, lost through a child?s play-
fulness, or through the unacquaintance of the adult even with
the most ordinary objects of knowledge among plants, might
have been saved, even in these times of higher education, if
phytologic knowledge was more universal 1 The species of
fungi, which can be converted into pleasant, nutritious food are
far more numerous than popularly supposed, but for extending
industries in this direction botanic science must assume the
guardianship. In a technologic hall like this, I should like to
see instructive portraits also of all the edible and noxious
plants, likely to come within the colonist?s reach.
Among about one thousand kinds of Fig-trees which, (so
Mons. Alphonse de Candolle tells me) through Mons. Bureau?s
present writings for the Prodromus, are ascertained to exist,
only one yields the fig of our table, only one forms the famed
Sycamore fig, planted along so many roads of the Orient;
only one constitutes our own Ficus macrophylla, destined, in
its unsurpassed magnificence, to overshade here our pathways.
How are these thousands of species of Ficus, all distinct in
appearance, in character, and in uses ?how are they to be
recognised, unless a diagnosis of each becomes carefully
elaborated and recorded, headed by a specific name?
Without descriptive botany, all safe discrimination becomes
futile. To bear our share in building up an universal system
of specific delimitation of all plants is a task well worthy
of the patronage of an intelligent and high-minded people.
The physician is thereby guided to draw safe comparisons in
reference to the action of herbs and roots which he wishes to
prescribe, as available from native resources. Thus it was
through Victorian researches, that not only the close affinity of


Goodeniacese to the order of Gentianeae was brought to light,
but simultaneously a host of herbs and shrubs of the former
order gained for therapeutic uses. When once it was ascer-
tained that the so-called Myrtletree of our forest moors was
a true Beech, the artisan then also found offered to him a
timber of great similarity to that of the beech forests of his
British home.
Of the grass genus Panicum, we know the world possesses,
according to a recent botanic disquisition, about 850 species,
all more or less nutritive. But one only of these is the famous
Coapin of Angola (Panicum spectabile), one the Warree (Pani-
cum miliaceum), one the Bhadlee (Panicum pilosum), one the
Derran (P. frumentaceum). We might dispense perhaps, as
far as these few are concerned, with their scientific appella-
tions, though not even the mere task of naming has become
therewith easier, and no information whatsoever of their
characteristics has been gained. But if we wish to refer to
any of the many hundred other species of Panicum, in what
way are we to express ourselves if even their vernacular names
could be collected from at least a dozen of languages, and
impressed on any one?s memory ? They are, as may readily
be imagined, very different indeed in their special nutritiveness,
degree of endurance, and length of life. Of 140 species of
Bromus, only one is the Prairie Grass, which attained already
a great celebrity as a pasture grass naturalised in this country;
and it is only one other Bromus, among the many nutritious
kinds, which carries the palm as the most fattening fodder
grass for cold, marshy pastures, and gradually, through de-
pasturing, surpresses completely all other grasses and weeds;
so it is proved on the marshlands of Oldenburg. This Bromus
(B. secalinus), as far as I am cognisant, is nowhere as yet
economically cultivated in Victoria.
Nothing would be easier than to commence disseminating
a number of the best grasses in addition to those already
here; for instance, the Canadian Bice Grass (Hydropyrum
esculentum) for our swamp lands. Their nutritive value must
be tested by analysis and other experiments, just like that of
the Saltbushes of the Murray Flats. Hence ample scope for
the exertions of science also in this direction.
In Cotta?s celebrated publishing establishment at Stuttgart,
a most useful work is issued by my friend, Prof. Noerdlinger,
on the structure of timber of various kinds, illustrated by
microscopic sections of the wood itself; for the latter fascicles
I furnished some material from this colony. The work should
be accessible in this museum to all interested in wood work.


How much we have yet to learn of the value of our forest
products is instanced when we now know from Spanish phy-
sicians to combat ague with Eucalyptus leaves, or when
Count Maillard de Marafy, from experiments instituted this
year in Egypt, announced to us that Eucalyptus leaves can be
used as a substitute for sumach. (Egypte Agricole, 1870.)
Already in the earlier part of this lecture I spoke ot the
Peru Bark Plants j but the Cinchonas are not all of the same
kind. Some endure a lower degree of temperature than others,
some are richer in quinine, others richer in cinchonine, others
in quinoidine; and this again is much subject to fluctuations
under different effects of climate and soil. Great errors may
be committed, and have been committed, by adopting from
among a number of species the least valuable, or one under
ordinary circumstances almost devoid of alkaloid, though
a representative of the genus cinchona, and not unlike
the lucrative species. When calculations in India piognos-
ticate the almost incredible annual return of 130 per cent,
after four years on the original outlay for Cinchona plantation,
it is supposed that the conditions for this new industrial
culture are to the utmost favourable. That one of the
best species did not thrive there at all m proportion
to expectations, is owing, in my opinion, to geologic condi-
tions The cinchonas before you, reared m soil from our
Pern tree gullies, I intended to have tested for the per-
centage of their alkaloids prior to this evening; but the
timely performance of this investigation was frustrated, i
think, that I have proved the hardiness or adaptability o
these important plants for the warm Palm valleys of East
?Gipps Land, as many indigenous plants from that gema
spot are quite as much, if not more, susceptible of
the night frosts of our city than the Cmchonae, if bars
cutting winds are kept from the latter. But as yet i
am unacquainted with the likely results of remunerative Cin-
chona cultivation within the boundaries of this colony, as far
as such depends on the constituents of the soil. ihat
inquiries of this kind are not mere chimeras may be con-
ceded after an explanation of this kind for e 611 ~
future technology. Geology, one of the brightest uteUrtes
which rotate around the sun of universal science, continues
to send its lustre into the darkness which yet involvesso
many of the great operations in tellurian nature. Ynrt
insight into the relation of this discipline of jctenc to
vegetable physiology is certain to shed abundance of light
lo on many Whes of applied industry. The causes why


the Ironbark trees of our auriferous quartz ridges differ so
materially from the conspecific tree of alluvial flats can only
be explained geologically. So it is with the narrow-leaved
Eucalyptus amygdalina on open stony declivities as com-
pared with the broad-leaved Eucalyptus fissilis, which in such
gigantic dimensions towers up from our deep forest valleys.
But all this has an important bearing on technological exer-
tions in manifold directions. The timber chosen by the
artisan from a wrong locality may impair the soundness of a
whole building ; or a factory may prove not lucrative simply
because it is placed on a wrong spot for the best raw material.
A thousand of other industrial purposes might yet be
served by a close knowledge of plants. So the designer
might choose patterns far more beautiful from the simple and
ever perfect beauty of nature than he gains from distorted
forms copied into much of our tapestry; thus a room, nowa-
days, as a rule, decorated with unmeaning, and often, as far
as imitation of nature is concerned, impossible figures 5 , miylit
become, geographically or phytographieally, quite instructive,
if here the founders of territorial estates ?some, perhaps, as
large as the palatinates of the Middle Ages?should wish to
perpetuate the custom of choosing a symbol for family arms,
they, as the Highland clans adopted special plants of their
native mountains for a distinguishing badge, might select
as the ancestral emblem the flowers of our soil, destined,
perhaps, to be traced, not without pride, by many a lineage
through a hundred generations.
Precise knowledge of even the oceanic vegetation, in its
almost infinite display of forms, offers not merely the most
delicate objects for design, but brings before us its respective
value for manure, or the importance of various herbage on
which fishes will browse; while such marine weeds may as
well be transferred from ocean to ocean as ova of trout have
been brought from the far north to these distant southern
latitudes. Who could foresee when first lodine was accidentally
discovered in seaweeds, through soda factories, or Bromine
subsequently appeared as a mere substance of curiosity, what
powerful therapeutic agents thereby were gained for medicine
what unique results they would render for chemical processes?
ot what incalculable advantages they would prove in physio-
logical researches or microscopic tests; and how, without them
photographic art could not have depictured with unerring
fidelity millions of objects, whether of landscapes or of the
starry sky, whether of the beings dear to us or the relics of
antiquity, whether enlarging the scope of lithography or


recording the languages which the flashing of telegraphic elec-
tricity sends to a dwelling or to an empire 1 ? Even the
vegetable fossils, deep buried in the earth or in the cleavage
of rocks, when viewed by the light of phytology become so
many letters on the pages of nature?s revelation, from which
we are to learn the age of strata, or may trace the sources of
metallic wealth, or by which we may be guided to huge rem-
nants of forests of bygone ages, stored up for the utilisation
of this epoch, or may comprehend, as far as mortal under-
standing serves us, successive changes in tellurian creation.
When Ray, and subsequently Jussieu, framed the first
groundwork for the ordinal demarcation of plants; when
Tournefort by defining generic limits brought further clear-
ness into the chaos of dawning systematic knowledge, and
when Linne gave so happily to each plant its second or spe-
cific name, but little was it indeed foreseen what a vast influ-
ence these principles of sound methodic arrangement would
exercise, not only on the easy recognition of the varied forms
of vegetable life, but also on the philosophic elucidation of
their properties and uses, and this for all times to come.
Many even at the present day, and among them at times those
on whom the destinies of whole states and populations may
can recognise in phytographic and other scientific
but little else than a mere play work; yet without
such labours every solid basis for applying the knowledge of
plants to uses of any kind would be wanting. We would stray,
indeed, ungraded in a labyrinth between crude masses or
inordinate fragments, instead of dwelling in a grand and
lasting structure of knowledge, unless science, also in this
direction, had raised its imperishable temples. But how much
patient and toilsome research had to be spent thus to bring
together in a systematic arrangement all the products of this
wide globe; how many dangers of exploring travellers had to
be braved to amplify the material for this knowledge, and
how many have to pass away even now-a-days, persecuted and
worried like Galileo at his time, no one yet has told, nor will
tell. Well may we feel with the great German poet, as
expressed in Bulwer Lytton?s beautiful wording: ?
? I will reward thee in a holier land,
Do give to me thy youth!
All I can grant you lies in this command ?
I heard, and trusting in a holier land,
Gave my young joys to truth.?
But is there nothing higher than the search of earthly
riches, and is to this all knowledge of the earth?s beautiful


vegetation also to be rendered subservient 1 Is there nothing
loftier than to break the flowers for our gaieties or to strew
them along a mirthful path 1 There is ! They raised the
noblest feelings of the poet at all ages, they spoke the purest
words of attachment, they ever were the silent harbingers of
love. They smilingly inspired hope anew in unmeasured
sadness, and on the deathbed or at the grave they appear to
link together, as symbols of ever-returning springs, the mortal
world with immortality; they ever teach us some of the
subliraest revelations of our eternal God.
The laurel crown of the hero was a people?s highest reward
of chivalrous and glorious deeds.
The myrtle, or orange wreath for bridal curls, remains the
proudest gift to youthful hope.
The little blooming weed, content in a parched and dreary
desert, revived the strength of many a siziking wanderer
(Mungo Park); the ever unalterable beauty and harmony of
floral structures preaches the truths of eternal laws in the
universe?a faith that gave expression to Schiller?s memorable
words, as repeated by that leading British statesman, ? It?s
not all chance the world obeys.? (Gladstone.) The innocent
loveliness of nature?s flowers has often aroused anew the
shaken spirit of the philosopher, and to these and other gifts,,
of nature the American bard alludes, when he speaks of
great zoologist, Agassiz, of whose friendship I may well be
proud.
?And whenever the way seemed so long,
Or his heart began him to fail,
She would sing a still more wondrous song,
Or tell a more marvellous tale.?
And when it seems that all hopes of the weeping mother
are extinguished, or even the teachings of religion may well-
nigh forsake her, then the deep meaning of some of our
noblest poems inspired by nature is understood, and faith in
eternity once more embraced.
? And the mother gave in tear and pain
The flowers she most did love,
She knew she would find them all again
In the fields of light above.?
? And with childlike credulous affection
We behold their tender bud expand,
Emblems of our own great resurrection,
Emblems of the bright and better land.?
