QUEENSLAND.
Queensland, the most recently-established Austra-
lian Colony, is situated in lat. io° 40' —29° S., and
long. 138° —15 3 0 30' E., and comprises the whole north-
eastern portion of the Australian continent. It was
erected into a Colony towards the end of 1859. Pre-
vious to this event it formed an outlying portion of
the older Colony of New South Wales. Its southern
boundary commences on the eastern coast of Aus-
tralia at a point marked on the map, called Point
Danger, about 400 miles north of Sydney, the capital
of New South Wales, and the greater portion of the
southern boundary is formed by the 29th parallel of
South latitude. The eastern sea-board extends about
1,400 miles, from Point Danger to Cape York. Its
breadth at the southern boundary is about 900 miles
from the eastern coast-line to the meridian of 138° East
long., which forms the western boundary-line of the
Colony, separating it from the territory of South Aus-
tralia. This includes the greater part of the Gulf of Car-
pentaria, which has a seaboard of about 750 miles. The
whole of the Colony of Queensland comprises 669,520
square miles, or 420,492,800 acres {i.e., equal to more
than five and a half times the area of the United


Kingdom of Great Britain), and if we bear in mind
that the greater part of it is available either for pas-
ture, agriculture, or mining, it may be regarded as the
largest in the Australian continent.
Any sketch of this vast territory can only be of the
most general kind. We will, however, glance at its
principal features in connection with the map which
is prefixed. The highlands of Stanthorpe form the
most southerly point, and where are found the rich
tin mines, with a granite table-land, having an average
elevation of about 2,800 feet, and a climate not unlike
that of the South of England. Immediately adjoining,,
and on the north, are the famous Darling Downs, with
a general altitude of 1,600 feet above the sea level,,
one of the finest pastoral districts in the world, the
climate resembling that of the South of France..
These downs lie on the western slope of the great
Australian Cordillera, which runs parallel to its east
coast for 1,800 miles, and some 70 miles inland, and
which separate the Darling Downs from the Moreton
and Logan districts, rich in the finest coal, with a
good soil well watered. A seam of splendid coal has
been discovered at Walloon. It is nine feet in thick-
ness, and fulfils all the conditions of a first-class ex-
port coal.
We come then to the Wide Bay and Burnett dis-
tricts, and in addition to their rich pastoral and agri-
cultural capabilities,[we find the gold and copper fields
of Gympie, Kilkivan and Mount Perry. Were Gympie
with its rare mineral deposits situate nearer to the
centres of civilization and capital, it would long since
have been the great attraction of a busy population
one hundred times the present number. So far as we
have at present described the country, the rivers con-


sist chiefly of the Brisbane and the Mary, both nearly
.as wide as the Thames, and fairly navigable for sea-
going vessels for miles up from the mouth. Going
northward from the district last described, comes that
of which Rockhampton is the shipping port. Here
we cross the tropic, and nature begins to show herself
on a vaster scale; larger rivers, larger plains, and
larger animals are found. The two rivers, Fitzroy
and Burdekin, drain a country larger than ancient
France. Here again we have gold and copper in
abundance, gold, silver, lead, and copper, all being
found in one piece of quartz in many of the lodes here-
abouts. The zamais, and other tropical palms, begin
to appear, and the giant fig-tree towers like a cathedral
cupola above all its fellows;
Still passing northward, the constant westerly bend
of the Queensland coast becomes more noticeable,
and soon the rich sugar plantations on the Pioneer
River are reached. Then come more rich mines of
gold, plenteous coal and copper, with countless inter-
spersed lead and silver lodes, carrying associated gold,
but all quite neglected and unnoticed amid so much
other wealth.
Tracts of country near the Burdekin, and some
thousands of acres in extent, are covered with net-
works of mineral reefs. The Cloncurry copper mines
are abundantly rich in the beautiful clear red crystals
of the famous ruby oxide —the most valuable and
easiest smelted copper ore known. They lie on the
Cloncurry river, which runs into the Gulf of Carpen-
taria, as does also the Gilbert, which, in addition to
the universal gold, affords some of the most superb
oriental agates and sardonyxes in the world, fully
rivalling, if not surpassing, the best deposits of


Uruguay and Brazil, in the size, transparency, and
brilliant colouring of the stones.
It would be superfluous to follow out the description
of the Colony northward, which stretches away into
the Cape York peninsula, describing the enormous
golden wealth in reef and alluvial ; we will, therefore,
be content and work our way back and south to the
opal mines of Western Queensland, not forgetting to-
notice as we pass the coralline beauties of the great
Barrier Reef on the north-eastern sea front, and which
ably bears the palm as the first coral bank in the
world, 1,200 miles in length. In the west we come
to the great watershed of the Warrego, Thomson and
Barcoo rivers, which mostly find their final outlet in
the Murray River system of South Australia. In
Western Queensland lie the trachytic conglomerates
which form the matrix of that gleaming and gorgeous
gem, the priceless opal. This stone, with the large,
clear, glowing red chrysolites of the Burnett River, and
the delicate aqua-marine of Stanthorpe, are the leading
gems of Queensland.
Very little has been said hitherto of the pastoral
wealth of the colony, but the whole of it is none the
less abounding in sheep, cattle and horses, whose inte-
rests all the minerals and sugar tend to keep going
instead of interfering with. All this vast western
country is being fast filled up with the sheep and cattle
it so well can carry, and its distance from the eastern
sea coast is now being rapidly reduced by means of
railways. The limit of the pastoral and productive
wealth in the future of these vast western plains is
scarcely to be estimated.
Most of the productions of both temperate and
tropical countries can be cultivated with success-

in Queensland. It is admirably adapted for the pro-
duction of cotton, which is said to be indigenous here>
and from the absence of severe frosts perennial, its
quality being affirmed by judges to be superior to
cotton from any other part of the world. Its timber
also is of fine quality, the Moreton Bay pine and the
Damarra Robusta, together with the cedar of Queens-
land, forming valuable products for export.
Enough will have been said to enable the reader to
form some slight idea of the general outline and rich-
ness of this vast territory. We will now glance at the
rise and progress of the Colony. At the time of its
establishment as an independent colony the popula-
tion of Queensland was somewhat under 24,000.
The towns which might more correctly be desig-
nated hamlets were but few, while the districts known
by the name of Moreton, Darling Downs, Wide Bay,
Burnett, and Leichardt, with a portion of what was then
and still is the Maranoa, were at that time the prin-
cipal districts where pastoral pursuits were carried on.
Queensland, however, was not even at that time des-
titute of stock, being possessed of over three millions
of sheep and over four hundred thousand head of
cattle.
The following table shows the official return of Population,
population in Queensland from iB6O to 1876 inclusive,
at the close of each year :
It is generally (but erroneously) supposed by many Health.


who reside out of Queensland, that owing to its partly
tropical character, that its death-rate per thousand
must be very high every year as compared with that
of other communities. On referring to the official
report of the Registrar-General, as laid before Parlia-
ment, we find that the healthiness of the Colony is little
less than wonderful. For the seventeen years extending
from iB6O to 1876 inclusive, we find the average annual
death-rates per thousand to be iB - 59.
We have already glanced at the quantity of stock
in the Colony at the date of its establishment, and it
may be well here to resume a brief notice of the pro-
gress of the Colony with regard to these matters.
From 1859 to 1868 there was a steady and continued
increase, and the returns for the latter year show that
at the time there were in Queensland 66,878 horses,
968,279 head of cattle, and 8,921,784 sheep. These
figures show that during that short period the Colony
had made rapid progress as a grazing country. About
this time, however, probably with a better knowledge
of the grasses of the country, an opinion prevailed
that some of the districts were better adapted for the
growth and fattening of cattle than for sheep.
Possibly the great expense attending the carriage of
wool to a port may have had something to do with
this opinion. Be this as it may, from that time to the
present, while horses and cattle have largely increased,
the number of sheep has sensibly diminished.
In 1876 the number of horses in the Colony was
130,289, of cattle there were 1,985,807, and of sheep
7,241,810, As to the possession of cattle, Queensland
stands next to New South Wales, which is the largest
cattle-producing Colony in Australia, and although in
the number of sheep she possessed 70,000 less in 1876

than in 1875, yet in 1876 the value of the wool is
stated at £1,499,576, as against £1,366,000 in 1875.
This is no doubt to be attributed to the constant
introduction of fresh blood and the increase in the
weight of the fleece.
Perhaps nothing that could be said here would give gports and
a clearer or more convincing proof of the ever-in-
creasing and vital power of this Colony than a glance
at the authorised returns of imports and exports.
In the nine years, 1867-1875 inclusive, Queensland
stood as follows with respect to imports and exports :
Dissecting these returns for 1875, we find that the
mining wealth of the Colony is coming very consider-
ably to the fore; the exports of gold and other metals
show a total of £1,847,575, while those from the
pastoral industry give a total of £1,551,202.
It may be taken that the exports now exceed the
imports by over £1,000,000 per annum, thus gaining
the foremost place in exporting power per head of
population over all the other Colonies of Australia,
and, we believe, over all the other countries in the
world.
As an agricultural country, we think that Queens- Agriculture.
land will be able to take a position second to none,

and to test those powers we can only do it by the
little she has done. Taking the single article of
wheat, what is the average raised per acre of this
cereal by all the Australian Colonies ? In 1875 we
find Victoria raised 15 bushels, New South Wales 14
bushels, South Australia 12 bushels, Queensland 22
bushels per acre. It will thus be seen that the power
is there. However, amongst so much other wealth, this
has been neglected, and will doubtless remain so while
the wants of the inhabitants in this way can be so
adequately supplied at the present reasonable rate by
the adjoining Colonies.
The financial year in Queensland, so far as the
public accounts are concerned, ends in each year on
June 30. The revenue is very largely obtained by
means of the custom house, partly from the rents of
runs, rents of conditional purchases of land, duty,
stamps, railways, telegraphs, and post office, and
miners’ rights. Omitting loans and their disburse-
ments, the revenue and expenditure stood as follows
from 1859 to 1876, and inclusive of land orders: —■

Rise and Progress of Towns.
It may not be inappropriate here to take a short
glance at the rise and progress of a few of the lead-
ing towns of Queensland as published in the “ Queens-
lander”
Brisbane, the metropolis of Queensland, occupies Br ; sbane .
a fine hilly, bold site on the banks of the river of
the same name, which is here about 1,000 feet wide.
It cannot be called the prettiest or the ugliest capital
in Australia ; it lacks the noble harbour of Sydney
and the snow-capped background of Hobart Town,
but still it has its distinguishing advantages, for none
of the sister cities command anything approaching
such a sweep of really grand view in every direction
as Brisbane does, and extending 160 miles from
north to south, and 100 from east to west —an area
nearly equal to all Tasmania. On the south are
visible Mount Lindsay, nearly 100 miles ride from
Brisbane, also the great rainy McPherson’s range, a
wall at right angles to the coast, and nearly 6,000 feet
high in places, while, on the north, the eye commands
* By the Audit Act of 1874, 38 Viet., No. 12, it is enacted that the
Financial year shall commence on the Ist of July and end on the 50th
June following. This Act came into operation on the Ist January, 1875,
in consequence of which these figures are only for the half-year ended
30th June.


the Kilcoy and other ranges which shed the distant
head waters of the Mary and Burnett rivers on their
northern slopes. To the west the dim blue peak of
the Main Range, serrated by the gaps of Koreelah
and other passes, loom 70 miles away, and mark the
site of Darling Downs, while, to the east, the sea
view is shut in by the cypress pine hills and sandy
cliffs of Moreton and Stradbroke islands, thirty miles
away. Brisbane is built on a cape of land formed
by a bend of the river, the said cape pointing to the
south-east On the north-east and south-west of
Brisbane is the river, 1,000 feet wide; on the south-
east of the city lie the Botanical Gardens, and on the
north-west rise the Windmill Hill and Wickham
Terrace Reserves, so there are fresh air and “lungs”
in plenty all round the pretty metropolis of Queens-
land. And, speaking of fresh air, we are reminded
of fresh water, with which no city in the world is
better supplied in proportion to its population than
Brisbane is.
About seven miles back from town, and at an eleva-
tion of 240 feet above the tidal river level, the waters
of Enoggera Creek are dammed back to form a lake
of about 200 acres in extent and 40 feet in depth
creating a water supply which, for volume and pres-
sure, surpasses that of Sydney, with six times the
population of Brisbane. The reservoir is thus con-
stantly fed by the waters of a pure mountain stream,
which rises in broken granitic country that surpasses
in unfrequented wildness and difficulty of access even
the loftier ranges of the tin country, and so, fortu-
nately, guarantees a continued freedom from any im-
purity. Beautiful villas, commanding extensive and
picturesque views of mountain, sea, river, garden,


farm and forest in every shade of pleasing tint and
sharp outline under the clear sky of Australia —are
found on all the suburban roads. The present popu-
lation is about 30,000.
Rise and Progress of Ipswich.
This town, formerly called “Limestone/’ from its Ipswich,
geological formation, was established as a branch
penal station in connection with Brisbane at the same
time as the latter was, and being at the head of river
navigation, and the spot where the steamers and bullock
drays met and exchanged their respective loading,
such as wool for station supplies, in the old days before
railways were thought of, Ipswich soon became a
thriving place after the settlement of Darling Downs,
and contained at one time no less than 30 hotels, and
the boiling-down of stock added still more to the bustle
of its daily life. So great, indeed, were its vitality and
growth and the energy of its inhabitants, removed as
they were from the enervating influence of the sea air,
that at the time of separation, its population and elec-
toral roll being about equal to those of Brisbane, it
disputed the right of the latter place to be declared the
seat of government of the new Colony.
Since that time, however, Ipswich has, owing to the
advent of railways and the cessation of boiling-down
of stock, and other causes, not progressed so rapidly
as in the first few years of its existence. It is a neat,
clean town, with some four or five thousand inhabitants,
a creditable volunteer force, numerous branch banks
and government offices, and depends at present for its
support on the magnificent agricultural district by
which it is surrounded. The abundance of coal in its


immediate vicinity gives promise of its being the seat
of manufacturing industry in the future, and there
seems little doubt about its becoming ultimately a
large and populous town. Its present population is
about 5,500.
Rise and Progress of Toowoomba.
This township was once the site of a grassy camping
ground for the Darling Downs bullock teams in olden
times, and it being a well-watered open dell near the
edge of the Main Range, and some 2,000 feet above
the sea level, teams used to rest here both before
making the descent and after accomplishing the ascent
of the Cordillera, especially as the grass was splendid,
and the open timber of gigantic stringy bark and green
wattle, rich in gum and bloom, bespoke a wholesome
pleasant country to dwell in. Two large swampy
“sponges,” separated from each other by a ridge,
gradually converge and unite to form the head of
Cowrie Creek. This place, known once as Drayton
Swamp, in honour of the ancient and now almost ob-
solete township of Drayton, of 1843-57, is now the
leading township of Darling Downs. It had, in 1854,
but one house on it; in 1857 it was still inferior to
Drayton; but by 1859 it had asserted itself, and the
parent township had to take a secondary position.
Since that time Toowoomba, nourished by the trade
arising from pastoral and agricultural sources alike,
and with some hope of minerals too looming in the
future, has continued to go ahead, its only check having
been during 1866 and the following years. Its public
building, stores, streets, shops, churches, chapels, and
volunteer corps, all denote substantial prosperity and
genuine public spirit, and a healthier, pleasanter.


44 pluckier” township does not exist in Queensland. It
onjoys railway communication with Brisbane, Ipswich,
Warwick, and Dalby, the two latter lines converging
to Toowoomba. A powerful, well-organised agricul-
tural and pastoral society holds its useful periodical
show meetings here, and the mountain air, keen breeze,
rich pasturage, and the grand wine and wheat country
around this favoured spot of earth, all help to impart
a vigour to its denizens and doings which is thoroughly
English in character, and the cheeks of the people are
quite as rosy as their apples, which is, indeed, saying
a great deal.
The mean temperature is 62?, which is considered
by physicians to be the happy medium furthest re-
moved from undue heat and cold alike, and the one
most suited to the human constitution.
Its present population is about 5,000.
Rise and Progress of Warwick:
Warwick is situated on the southern part of Dar- Warwick,
ling Downs, on the banks of the Condamine River, a
gravelly, dry site, and a very English-looking place
altogether. There are fine farms and vineyards all
round it, and the splendid pastoral properties which
are close at hand, as well as the tin mines only fifty
miles away from its railway station, give Warwick a
comfortable status amongst the Queensland towns.
Its present population is about 3,300.
Maryborough
Is a municipal township on the River Mary, 60 miles Maryborough,
from its mouth, about 180 miles north of Brisbane.
It is the port of shipment for the greater portion of


the Wide Bay and Burnett district, and is in the centre
of a large agricultural population settled on the banks
of the Mary River, both above and below the town.
It will be seen from the panoramic view of the
town exhibited, that there is still plenty of room for
the erection of buildings, even in some of the main
streets:
That these gaps will soon be filled up there can be
little doubt, since it is one of the soundest business
towns in the Colony, and has a large and increasing
trade from the mining, agricultural and pastoral
district of which it is the port.
The present population of the municipality is about
6,000; of the suburbs and agricultural settlements-
in the neighbourhood, about 8,000.
Rise and Progress of Rockhampton.
This town did not exist in 1857, when the an-
nouncement at the Surveyor-General’s office in Syd-
ney (by a Brisbane gentleman visiting there) of the
fact that there existed in Keppel Bay a navigable
river called the Fitzroy, as wide and as deep as the
Thames, caused a surveyor to be sent up, and a town-
ship to be laid out at once, about 45 miles from
the river mouth, and just below a reef of rocks which
barred all further navigation upward for large vessels.
The streets were judiciously planned, like those of
Melbourne, two chains wide, and Rockhampton is con-
sequently a well-built and fine-looking town, and
being the focus and shipping port of a vast, rich
mineral and pastoral belt of country on the Dawson,
Mackenzie, Isaac, Comet and other rivers, as well as
of the Peak Downs country, it possesses a great trade,
and will, in time, when railways pierce the interior


become a place of very considerable importance. The
Athelstan Range, at the south of the town, rises to
the height of about 150 feet, and on it are situated the
suburban residences of the leading townspeople.
Water is supplied from the Yeppen Yeppen and
Crescent Lagoons, and there is steam communications
with Yaamba, some distance further up the river.
Mount Bersaker affords a rich field of research to
the botanist and geologist, in fact Rockhampton is
the centre of a rich gold and copper district, and
minerals are found in nearly every direction you can
travel from it. The present population is about
6,000.
Rise and Progress of Gympie.
A wild and unfrequented spot on the banks of the Gympie,
Upper Mary River, and one of little use for pastoral
purposes, and so consequently seldom traversed, was
suddenly, towards the close of the year 1867,
awakened to brisk life by the discovery, at the hands
of a man named Nash, of a rich deposit of alluvial
gold, containing some £17,000 of dust. He took it
■up very quietly and sold some of it at Brisbane as
‘‘Cape River” gold, but the secret oozed out at
last, and Gympie Creek was worked for alluvial
digging.
Strange and wonderful adventures befel the few
citizens of Brisbane who essayed the perils by flood
and field of an overland trip to that unexplored
country (supposed in olden days to consist of
mahogany swamp and poor grass ranges) which lay
between the metropolis and the Golden Creek (for
Moololah, Maroochydore, and other rivers with rich
soil banks, were unknown to fame then). By-and-bye,
2


however, the alluvial was found to be a shallow myth,
and rich reefs of quartz and calcspar traversing a
greenstone or diorite rock were found to contain
fabulous wealth in gold, and the New Zealand, Lady
Mary, Smithfield, Monkland, Caledonia, and other
famous reefs began to send forth their splendid speci-
mens to astonish the metropolitans, and the machine
crushings soon placed Gympie at the head of the
world in the return of gold per ton of quartz ; the
magnificent and unrivalled average of nearly 2\ ounces
to the ton, having been maintained on this field up to the
end of 1870. The road to Brisbane was put in order,
and Cobb and Co. began to appear on the scene. A
well-conducted newspaper soon graced the new town-
ship, and Gympie from 1868 to the present time
has continued to be one of the “ great facts ” of
Queensland.
Like other large quartz-crushing centres of industry,
it has been afflicted with one drawback, and that is in
the manner in which all the luck seems to flow into
few hands, who become inordinately rich and all the
rest of the people correspondingly poor. This is the
case at Gympie, where many a man, who never would
have owned £\oo anywhere else in the world by his
own exertions or brains, has found the gold grow as
it were, wherever he went to dig. Some of the early
crushings at Gympie were wonderful—there was really
more gold than quartz in some of the veins, even in
mere bulk, and the machine had to be stopped some-
times, as the soft, malleable, ductile metal remained
immoveable and insensible under the stampers to the
action of the water, clogging like so much “ toffy,” or
cobbler’s wax, and so had to be cleared away before
the steel hammers could be effectually brought to


bear on the ordinary quartz. Gympie continues to
flourish and presents as fine an opening for capital as
any gold-field in the world. The present population
of Gympie and its suburbs is about 4,500.
Rise and Progress of Townsville.
That “ trade makes the port,” and not the port Townsville.
trade, cannot be better exemplified than in the case
of Townsville.
This port is situated in latitude 19 0 10" South and
146° 58" E. longitude, and is only about 80 miles
from the town of Bowen, which enjoys one of the
finest harbours in Australia, whilst every facility can
be given to the shipment of produce, yet Bowen has
suffered a continued decadence since the formation of
Townsville, the progress of the latter (with not a tithe
of its facilities for trade as far as the port is con-
cerned) having been continuous, as the following com-
parison of exports and imports between 1865 and
1875 will show.
1865:—imports, £570; exports, £8,145 ; customs
receipts, £ll2 15s. 4d. Half-year ending 30th June,
1875: —imports £67,116; exports, £168,885 I customs
receipts, £17,411 ss. Bd.
The agricultural resources of Townsville, and the
immediate district around it, are not great, but exten-
sive and permanent gold-fields, and a vast area of
pastoral country, for which it forms the natural port,
have combined to raise it into importance.
These gold-fields are Star River, Ravenswood,
Charters Towers, Cloncurry, Gilbert and Etheridge.
The copper mines, principally awaiting the pushing
out of a railway from Townsville westward before
development, are situated on Star River and Copper-
field River.


The amount of gold exported from the port of
Townsville is constantly increasing, and there can be
little doubt that the mineral wealth of the district for
Which Townsville is the port is as yet only developed
to a very small extent, and will be greatly increased
in the future. Its population is about 2,500. Although
situated well within the tropics, the heat to be natur-
ally expected at Townsville is tempered by the
influence of the south-east trade winds, and with pro-
perly constructed residences and attention to keeping
them cool, there seems no reason why the inhabi-
tants should not enjoy as good health as those who
reside in Brisbane or Maryborough.
Cardwell, its Rise and Progress.
In Rockingham Bay, some .90 miles to the north
of Townsville, is the pretty little town of Cardwell.
The bay which it faces is one of the most beautiful,
as well as the finest harbour in Northern Queensland.
Its picturesque situation at the foot of the loftiest
mountains of the Coast Range, its elegant public build-
ings, and tropical scenery, render it a study for a
painter. The difficulty of overcoming the Coast Range
has hitherto presented an obstacle, not altogether
.insuperable, to its rapid progress, but this drawback,
-it is confidently expected, will shortly be overcome,
as an accessible road has lately been discovered over
The range.
Its population, including that of the neighbourhood,
is about 500. The gold escort from the Etheridge
has its head-quarters here. The surrounding districts
are pastoral principally, and large numbers of sheep
and cattle are reared on its rich pastoral lands.
Tropical fruits grow here in wild luxuriance.


It is from this port that the squatters and Herbert
River planters draw a large proportion of their
supplies.
A jetty, 2,000 feet long, extends into the bay,
Cardwell contains a court house, two hotels, two
stores, a national school, a branch of the Bank of
New South Wales, a telegraph office, a post office,
and a dugong oil factory.
Should the Palmer River diggings approach Card-
well as closely as they at present promise to do, a
great future is yet in store for this lovely town.
Springs of fresh water, which are constantly running
on the beach even below high water mark, are a
peculiarity of Cardwell. A pilot, pilot cutter, and
crew are stationed here. The steamers of the Eastern
and Australian Company call here.
COOKTOWN.
A newly-proclaimed mining township, situated on Cooktown,
the northern bank of the Endeavour River, about
1,050 miles north-west of Brisbane.
Though the town has been born in a day, it will
most likely take its place as one of the most import-
ant centres of the Colony, should the yield of gold
continue from the Palmer River district, for which it
forms the port.
Already a large population (4,000) has settled at
Cooktown, and as the available sites for building are
limited, it is likely that such sites will become very
valuable.
Somerset
Is a small township, situated at Cape York, 1,55° Somerset
miles north-west of Brisbane.


It is a harbour of refuge and a place of call for the
vessels engaged in the b£che-de-mer and pearl shell
fishery of Torres Straits, which is now employing a
large fleet of ships.
At the present time there are fifty large boats
engaged in the fishery.
As an instance of the profitable nature of this trade,
it may be mentioned that a vessel made in one season
no less a sum than £ 6,000.
From the preceding rapid glance at the principal
towns and Settlements of Queensland, the reader will
be able to form some idea of the rapid growth of the
Colony, and it may here be mentioned that the
Government looks carefully to the health and general
requirements of the towns. All the large towns are
amply supplied with water by means of pumping
stations and reservoirs, the service being constant and
the mains fitted with fire hydrants, all arrangements
being of the most modern and approved kind.
In railways the Colony is not behind hand, con -
sidering the present population. The battle of the
gauges was fought out in Australia again, and one
Colony has adopted one gauge and another Colony
another gauge. Thanks, however, to the good sense of
the leading authorities, the gauge adopted in Queens-
land, 3 feet 6 inches, is one that cannot fail to give
economical results for a new Colony whose very life
and existence depends on a cheap and rapid mode of
transit. At the present time Queensland can boast
of 272 miles of railway opened, 200 miles now under
construction, and 232 miles more authorized by
Parliament.
In telegraphs the Queensland lines stretch from
the southern boundary to the Gulf of Carpentaria.


Every gold-field, town and village has its station.
There are 120 stations, and 4,708 miles of line opened
and in daily operation, with 265 officers of various
grades on the permanent staff, besides those employed
on extensions.
In every town and village a branch of the Govern- savings’
inent Savings’ Bank is to be found, and when we take Banks *
into account the many inducements which always
exist in a young Colony for spending, or rather wasting
money, it is pleasing to observe that thrift and frugality
considerably prevail amongst the working-classes in
Queensland, for on December 31, 1876, the Savings’
Bank held to the credit of 12,904 depositors.
This is altogether independent of the other banks,
which at the same time held upwards of
the property of depositors.
Education in all the Australian Colonies has always Education
been a subject of great interest. In Queensland, so
far as primary education is concerned, the Legislature
has placed it upon what may be considered a per-
manent footing. In the State schools education is
free, secular, and compulsory within a limited distance
of a school. At the end of 1876 there were 170 State
schools, 67 provincial or probationary schools where
no State school had been erected, and 24 Roman
Catholic and non-vested schools. The latter are
schools that existed previous to the passing of the
State Education Act, and continue to receive aid until
1880. The children enrolled in these schools are as
follows : —State schools, 28,923 ; provincial schools,
2,057 5 now vested, 5,866; making a total of 36,846.
Primary education in Queensland has thus provided
a sufficiency of schools for present use, and considering
the amount of population the enrolment is good.


The gold-fields of Queensland are very numerous,
and have been found here and there on the slopes on
each side of the main dividing range which separate
the eastern and western waters, and also on spurs of
the range which forms the watershed to the Gulf of
Carpentaria.
The names of these gold-fields are Gympie, Talgai,
Kilkivan, Calliope, Canoona, Cawarral, Morinish,
Peak Downs, Cape River, Charters Towers, Ravens-
wood, Star River, situated on streams running to the
east coast, and Etheridge, Gilbert, Palmer, Cloncurry,
on tributaries of rivers falling into the Gulf of Car-
pentaria.
There being now no duty on gold in Queensland
it is difficult to arrive accurately at the produce of
these gold-fields ; the most part, however, of the gold
produced is bought up by the banks, and they always
report the same when reported to the Customs.
From this source it has been ascertained that the
yield of gold in 1874 was about one million sterling;
in 1875, owing to the greatly increased production
from the Palmer diggings, it was .£1,498,433.
The alluvial deposits in which gold has been found
in Queensland have hitherto been very shallow, and,
therefore, easily worked. The river beds, however,
which can only be worked during the dry season,
will in all probability afford good wages to mining
parties for years to come, a portion of whose number
may either be engaged opening auriferous quartz veins,
or prospecting for more remunerative alluvial deposits
in other portions of the same district.
It is the auriferous quartz veins in all these districts
which now attract the principal attention, and there
can be no doubt that these will afford remunerative
employment to miners for a considerable time to come,


especially when the more economical system of mining
by machinery, which is now being adopted by some of
the leading tin mines in the old country, whereby a
mine, which would have taken ten to twelve years to
open out and develope, can now be done in from one
to two years, and the facilities for conveying mining
plant to the various mining centres are increased by
railway communication.
The average yield from the auriferous quartz veins
in the Colony has always stood very high as compared
with that of other Australian Colonies. .
From the statistical register for the Colony we gather
that the average yield from auriferous quartz crushed
in 1873 on the several gold-fields, where crushing-
machines were in operation, was 1 oz. 14 dwts. 20 grs.
per ton.
The following are the Commissioners appointed
by the Government of Queensland for the Paris
Exhibition:—
Hon. Arthur Macalister, Esq., C.M.G., Chairman.
Arthur Hodgson, Esq.
William Hemmant, Esq.
E. O. McDevitt, Esq.
Sir W. W. Cairns, K.C.M.G. {special).
George Thorn, Esq.
R. M. Stewart, Esq.
Thos. Hamilton, Esq., Hon . Secretary.
E. A. CLARE, attache to the Commission and in charge
of the Court.
Queensland Court.
We come now to a description of the Queensland
Court, as designed and arranged for the Queensland
Commissioners at the Paris Exhibition by Mr. W. H.
Ashwell, C E., Executive Engineer to the Queens-
land Government Agency in London.


It was the original intention of the Commissioners
of the British Section that Queensland and Western
Australia should occupy a rectangle 40 feet long and
36 feet wide. Twenty-eight feet of this width was
devoted to the former and twelve feet to the latter.
In the meantime, Western Australia had decided not
to exhibit as a Colony, and the Commissioners,
graciously considering representations made, very
handsomely placed the whole of this space at the
disposal of the Queensland Commissioners. Even with
this addition it is only about a third of the space
occupied by this Colony at the Philadelphia Exhibi-
tion of 1876.
In so small a space it has been difficult to make an
arrangement which should not appear overcrowded,
and still give a fair idea of the general features and
products of the Colony, and, at the same time, meet
the views of all the exhibitors. The physical character
and natural products of the Colony may be seen at a
glance. The physical character being shewn by a
series of photographs illustrating the various geological
formations of the country, and beneath the photo-
graphs the natural products are presented to view in
specimen cases. The Geological formation, Mining,
Pastoral, Agricultural, and other industries, are each
represented in sections.
The arrangement of the Court is such as to make
the greatest amount of wall space, in order to exhibit
the grand collection of coloured photographs. The
walls, which are 10 feet high and timber framed, are
set back about 5 feet from the boundary of the Court
on all four sides, and are covered with photographs on
each side down to the show cases, which are arranged
along each side of the walls; access being had to
the interior of the Court by entrances 6 feet wide


diagonally at the corners. In the centre of the Court
are arranged other cases, with a raised case in the
centre containing the gold specimens ; below the show
cases round the walls are arranged the geological
maps, showing the position, &c., of the various strata.
Description of Photographs.

view of mining for gold in the deep alluvial drifts.
Here the miners are seen working in the alluvium, the
depth of which varies from 50 to 120 feet. Handsome
returns of gold are yielded at the latter depth. Such
deep sinking, however, is rather rare in Queensland,
as nearly all the alluvial gold is found in shallow drifts,
rarely exceeding 20 feet in depth.

of building adopted at a new “ rush ” on the gold-
fields. Here, in the first instance, bark stripped from
the Eucalypti, the common tree of the country, is used
for exterior purposes in all kinds of building. Later
on, should the character of the diggings warrant it,
comfortable buildings of wood and stone are substi-
tuted.
Photograph Photo. No. II. —Represents ordinary alluvial mining.
In the foreground may be observed the puddling-tub,
used in soaking the auriferous clay (if of a clayey
nature), and the cradle for finally extracting the gold
from the concentrated debris.

opened in the Colony, chiefly on the Darling Downs
and in the West Moreton district, and coal in any
quantity can be obtained within no great distance from
the capital—Brisbane.


Photos. No. 27 and 28. —Furnish a good idea of the
character of the forests usually met with on the areas

Photo. No. 29. —Presents a remarkable example of
the junction of two different geological formations at
the base of the cliff. We have a series of slates and
sandstone, nearly perpendicular, in which are embedded
auriferous quartz strings and veins. On the denuded
upturned edges of these slates occur horizontal sand-
stones and conglomerates of the carboniferous age.
In these conglomerates, at the junction of the two
formations, in certain localities of the Peak Downs,
drifted gold has been found in the carboniferous
conglomerates, distinctly proving that some gold, at
all events, existed in the veins prior to the deposit of
the carboniferous rocks.

ordinarily of a fattening quality ; such districts there-
fore are mostly taken up by pastoral settlers, who, in
the breeding of the cattle have found the country to
be of the most valuable kind. Where, however,
granitic country lies near the coast, so that the
stock depastured on it can have access to salt pans
and the saline herbage around them, cattle fatten
rapidly.

DYEING MATERIALS.
The climate and soil of many portions of the
colony are well suited to the production of madder
and indigo of superior quality. In addition to these,
many of our indigenous plants, amongst others
Pipturus propinquus, Morus calcar-galli, Laportea
gigas, etc., possess valuable dyeing properties.

brought prominently into notice. Almost the whole
of the recognized commercial fibres can be grown
with success, and the attention of many of our culti-
vators is being drawn to their production.

ESSENTIAL OILS, TINCTURES, Etc. (Prepared
L. Carmichael, Chemist.)
The myrtaceous trees and shrubs, which are found
in immense quantities throughout Australia, are all,
without exception, characterised by the presence of
essential oils in greater or lesser quantities. This is
not only the case with the Eucalypti, but also with
species of Melaleuca, Leptospermum, and various
others. Many of the Acacias produce flowers, from
which agreeable perfumes can be obtained. As yet
this branch of industry can hardly be said to have pro-
ceeded beyond the experimental stage, although it
will no doubt receive an impetus from the discovery
of a new species of Eucalyptus in Northern Queens-
land, from which Mr. K. T. Staiger, F.L.S., has ob-
tained an oil possessing superior properties.
329. Botanic Garden. —Oil of Blue Gum (Eucalyptus
botryoides, Sm.) Therapeutic uses, antiseptic,
useful in putrid fevers and foetid suppurations.

stigma quadriloculare, F.M.) Contains a very-
powerful bitter, and is said to possess the same
properties as Peruvian Bark.
Botanic Garden. —Essence of Verbena, scented
Ironbark from the Palmer River (Eucalyptus
Sp.) This is obtained from a recently dis-
covered Eucalyptus not yet named, possessing
the most powerful and agreeable perfume that
has yet been obtained from any of the
Myrtaceae.

(Eucalyptus tereticornis, Sm.), Darling Downs.
Possessing valuable therapeutic properties.
Botanic Garden. —Essence of Jasmine (Jasmimum
grandiflorum, Linn.)
Botanic Garden. —Essence of Acacia (Acacia
farnesiana, Willd). A native of the warmer
parts of Australia ; found as far south as the
Darling River. Its scented flowers are much
sought after for perfumery.
Botanic Garden. —Oil of Orange (Citrus
aurantium, Linn.)
Botanic Garden. —Tincture of Gelsemiutn, as
prescribed by Dr. Cannan, Brisbane; a plant of
therapeutical importance, the active principle of
which is gelseminin, said to be useful in cases
of neuralgia. Obtained from (Gelsemium
nitidum—Mich.)
Botanic Garden. —Tincture of Bitter Bark
(Alstonia constricta, F.M.) This tree is of
frequent occurrence in the scrubs ; the bark is
thick, of a yellow colour, deeply fissured and
of intense bitterness, and is reputed to possess


the same properties as quinine; is used in cases
of fever and ague with good effect.
as*.

sidered to possess the same therapeutic quali-
ties, combined with a more agreeable taste.

Linn.)
Botanic Garden. —Croton Oil (Croton Tiglium
Linn.)
Botanic Garden. —Oil of Lemon, scented gum
(Eucalyptus citriodora Hook.) The dried
leaves of this species preserve books and
clothes from the attacks of insects, and at the
same time impart an agreeable perfume. The
leaves used as a pillow are reputed to afford
immunity from fever and ague.
Botanic Garden. —Pitcheri. Used by the blacks ;
when chewed produces excitement and in-
toxication. Perfect specimens not yet obtained.


GUM RESINS.

TOBACCO.
Although tobacco has been cultivated for a con-
siderable period, owing to the general want of
experience and skill on the part of the growers, the
quality of the product was not so good as could be
desired. Within the last few years, aided by enlarged


experience, this difficulty has been overcome, and an
improved quality of leaf produced. Tobacco culture,
when skilfully conducted, has proved itself a very
profitable occupation- All the principal American
varieties are cultivated and the cultivation of the newer
and more estemed description, as Shiraz, Nicotiana
persica, and varieties from Bhilsa and Ispahan, is now
becoming general. The unusually unfavourable season
that we have just experienced, has materially affected
the tobacco crop, and consequently the exhibits are
not so numerous as they otherwise would have been,

SUGARS.
Ordinary commercial samples taken from bulk.
The production of sugar has now become a firmly
established and increasing industry. In 1876, there


were 13,690 acres under cultivation, and 70 mills and
12 distilleries employed in the manufacture of their
produce. The cultivation of the sugar-cane in Queens-
land already extends over ten degrees of latitude, and
upon all our northern rivers there is still a boundless
field for the successful prosecution of this remunera-
tive industry.

Brisbane District— Lat. 27 0 28' S.; Lon. 153 0 3' E.
Average annual rainfall during 16 years, 5226
inches, distributed over 127 days. Mean shade tem-
perature, 70°'2 F. Mean maximum shade, Bo° F.
Mean minimum 59 0 F.
There are 17 sugar-mills in this district in connec-
tion with sugar estates, and there also a large number
of small growers, whose crops are either purchased by
the mill-owners, or manufactured by them for the
growers, at a percentage of the sugar obtained. There
are also several distilleries in the district, which ex-
tends for a distance of 72 miles north and 18 miles
south of the city of Brisbane. In some portions the
frosts interfere with the cultivation of the sugar-cane.
The geological formation consists of Devonian clay
slates, shales, lepidodendron, and spinifer, and con-
glomerates in the upper beds, crystalline limestone in
the lower. Also, to the eastward, of paleozoic carboni-
ferous formation, glossopteris, with productus spinifer,

Logan District— Lat. 2/28' S.; Lon. 153 0 8' E,
Rainfall for 1875, inches, distributed over 104
days. This district extends southward to the
boundary of the colony of New South Wales, and
includes the Albert, Pimpama, Coomera, and Nerang
all sugar-producing rivers. The land employed in
the cultivation of sugar-cane consists principally of
the rich alluvial flats bordering the above-mentioned
rivers. There is a large area of land under cultivation,
and a considerable amount of capital has been in-
vested in the erection of improved machinery. There
are 18 mills in operation. In the neighbourhood of
the principal town, Beenleigh, the formation is mainly
of sandstone alternating with schist and occasional
patches of quartz. Coomera and Nerang are Devon-
ian, consisting of clay slates and shales, conglomerates
in the upper beds, crystalline limestone in the lower.

Mackay District. —Lat. 21 0 10'S.;
Lon. 149° 5 ' E.
Average annual rainfall for three years, 67*20 inches,
during 84 days: This district, which from its great
natural advantages has now become the most exten-
sive sugar-producing district of the colony, is situated
on the banks of the Pioneer River. There are already
r 8 mills and 4 distilleries in full work, and others in
the course of erection. The suitability of the climate,
coupled with the absence of frost and the presence of
rich alluvial flats devoid of timber, have conduced to
render this the most important sugar-producing district
of Queensland. The south side of the Pioneer River
is" a rich alluvial plain extending 16 miles from east to
west, by an average of 14 miles from north to south.
The north side of the river is hilly, of volcanic origin,
and in some places granite appears.

CEREALS,
The principal wheat-growing districts are in the
neighbourhood of Toowoomba, Warwick, and Allora,
situated on the Darling Downs, at an elevation of
2,000 feet above the level of the sea. Maize is also
largely cultivated, more especially upon the rich
alluvial lands on the tidal rivers. The Statistical
Report for 1876 gives the area under wheat as 5,967
acres, of which 1,165 were affected with rust and 347
entirely unproductive from the same cause. The
total yield from the clean crops was 91,170 bhls.,
giving an average of 20 bhls. 28 lbs., although in
some districts the average was as high as 28 bhls.

TEA, COFFEE, SPICES, &c.
Both tea and coffee can be successfully cultivated
in Queensland. In the southern portion of the colony
the coffee plant arrives at maturity in six or seven
years; on the northern rivers it commences bearing at
two years old ; although in the southern districts the
yield is good, the northern districts, more especially
the sheltered ridges of the Herbert, Daintree, Moss-
man, and Endeavour Rivers, are found more suitable
to its profitable cultivation. Tea grows luxuriantly


on the coast, but this plant, in order to develope the
full flavour of the leaf, requires a period of rest that
cannot be obtained where warmth and consequent
stimulus to growth is always, present, and a higher
elevation, such as the Darling Downs, is found more
suitable to this plant. Paraguay tea is admirably
adapted for cultivation in many parts of the colony,
and affords a heavy yield. In the more northern
districts, Theobroma Cacao, together with nutmeg,
cinnamon, cloves, and other spice-bearing plants,, give
great promise of future success.

In the year 1876, there were five flour mills in
operation in the colony, in the towns of Warwick,
Allora, and Toowoomba, and the quantity of grain
passed through their hands was, wheat 102,200
bushels, and maize 11,240 bushels.

ARROWROOT.
Arrowroot is cultivated with success in various por-
tions of the colony ; the supply has for some years
exceeded the local demand, and the surplus is
exported to the southern colonies. There are 30
manufactories, 27 of which are in the Logan district.
In 1876, 293,670 lbs. were produced, of which 162,495
lbs. were exported, valued at This does not
represent the total produce of the area under crop, as


in many instances it is used as pig-food. First-class
samples can be purchased in quantity at from two-
pence to threepence per lb.

TOBACCO.
Although tobacco has been cultivated for a con-
siderable period, owing to the general want of experi-
ence and skill on the part of the growers, the quality
of the product was not so good as could be desired.
Within the last few years, aided by enlarged
experience, this difficulty has been overcome, and an
improved quality of leaf produced. Tobacco culture
when skillfully conducted has proved itself a very
profitable occupation. All the principal American
varieties are cultivated, and the cultivation of the
newer and more esteemed descriptions, as Shiraz,
Nicotiana persica, and varieties from Bhilsa, and
Ispahan, is now becoming general. The unusually
unfavourable season that we have just experienced
has materially affected the tobacco crop, and conse-
quently the exhibits are not so numerous as they
otherwise would have been.

SPECIMENS OF INDIGENOUS PASTURE
GRASSES AND FODDER PLANTS.
738. Andropogon annulatus. Forsk. (Blue Grass). —


An excellent summer grass of an upright habit
of growth, good pasture, but is not very pro-
ductive during the winter months.
Andropogon halepensis , Sib.-—Tall growing peren-
nial grass, valuable for both hay and pasture.
It is an excellent cattle grass, though not much
sought after by sheep. In the northern districts
it grows strong and succulent, resembling a
cultivated sorghum. There are several varieties
of this fine grass.
Andropogon montanus, Roxb.—A tall, strong-
growing, coarse grass, deep rooted, and of
stoloniferous habit, found on the Darling Downs,
and is partial to rich flats. The flower panicles
possess a peculiar perfume.
Andropogon nervosus, Rott. (Rat-tail grass).—An
upright growing grass, found throughout the
colony, rather coarse, but yields a fair amount
of feed which is readily eaten by cattle.
Andropogon refractus , R. B, (Kangaroo Grass). —
An excellent grass for either pasture or hay,
common in open country in the southern parts
of the colony. It is a very productive summer
grass, but makes little growth during the winter
unless upon sheltered forest land. Its roots
have a strong aromatic flavour.
Andropogon rottboelloides , Steud.—A large grass
found on the rivers of northern Queensland
Its culm rises to the height of eight feet. It
yields a large quantity of fodder, as its culm,
seed, and foliage, together with the base of its
thick stem, are eagerly eaten by cattle and
horses.
Agrostis Solandri , F. M.—Perennial and annual.


Found in almost all parts of Australia : plentiful
on the Darling Downs, where it prefers the
strongest wet land. It is one of the first grasses
to spring after rains, and affords a supply of
nutritious herbage until dried up by the summer
heat. An excellent winter grass, and the
herbage is sweet and succulent.
Anthistiria australis , R. B. (Common kangaroo
grass).—A tall perennial upright growing grass,
often three feet in height. The roots are strong,
fibrous, and penetrating. It is found in all
parts of Australia, forms but few perfect seeds,
and these do not germinate freely. It is one of
the finest and most useful of the indigenous
grasses. It remains green during the summer,
but turns a little brown in the autumn, when
its nutritive qualities are at the highest. Horses
keep in better condition on this grass, doing
hard work, than on almost any other species of
native grass.
Anthistiria avenacea, F. M. (Darling Downs). —
Oat grass, one of the most productive grasses
in Australia, and unlike other kangaroo grasses,
it possesses the advantage of being a prolific
seeder.
Anthistiria ciliata , L.—Kangaroo grass of
northern Queensland. This is an excellent
grass for stock, and makes a larger amount of
bottom feed than the other kangaroo grasses.
Anthistiria membranacea, Lindl. (Barcoo Grass).
—One of the best pasture grasses in Queens-
land. This grass is exceedingly brittle when
dry, stock are found licking the broken parts
from the ground.


Arundinella nepalensis , Trin. —A grass well ad-
apted for hay. On the Darling Downs under
cultivation has been cut three times during the
season.
Chloris divaricata, R. B. (Dog-tooth Star Gras).
—An early grower, and although the stalks
appear dry, yields a quantity of nutritious
feed.
Chloris ventricosa , R. B. (Blue Star Grass). —An
erect quick growing species, found along the
borders of scrubs, and produces a large quantity
of leafy feed.
Chloris scariosa, F. M. —Particularly handsome
grass, and excellent pasture; found in the
northern and western districts.
Danthonia pectinata , Lindl. (Mitchell Grass). —
This is a valuable perennial desert grass, resis-
ting drought, and sought with avidity by
stock.
Danthonia lappacea , Lindl.—This grass, although
of rather a coarser nature than the preceding
one, possesses the same characteristics, and
from the well-known fattening and drought
resisting qualities of both species, they
are deserving of cultivation. Seed has been
sent to America, for trial in the Southern
States.
Festuca Billardierii , Steud. —Perennial grass ;
grows about two feet in height, does not per-
fect its seed well, produces plenty of tender
foliage, and is not much affected by dry seasons,
or easily injured by overstocking. It is a
valuable grass and may be considered one of
the best of our winter grasses.


Microlcena stipoides, R. B.—Perennial grass of
quick growth, producing abundance of seed,
keeps green during the diyest summer, and
vegetates freely during the winter, and may
be considered a good cattle grass.
Panicum leevhiode, Lindk—This very excellent
grass was discovered by Sir Thomas Mitchell
during his explorations in 1831. It was con-
sidered by him the best grass met with during
his journey. It is used by the natives as an
article of food, and is gathered by the women
in large quantities, and the seeds pounded
between stones, mixed with water, are formed
into a kind of paste or bread.
Panicum crus-galli, Linn.—A strong growing
grass that affords a large amount of feed to
cattle in seasons of scarcity, and is much im-
proved by cultivation.
Panicum decomposition, R. B.—One of the most
valuable of the Darling Downs grasses; under
cultivation this grass has yielded in one season
over three tons of hay per acre.
Panicum italicum, L.—This grass, notwithstand-
ing its specific name, is of Indian origin, and is
also a native of Northern Australia. It is a
good pasture grass, and possesses fattening
properties, and thrives well upon poor dry
soils ; although it is an annual it increases
quickly, from being an abundant seed-bearer.
The seeds, when pounded, mixed with water,
and baked, are used as food by the natives.
Poa Brownii, Nees.—There are several varities
of this fine pasture grass, common on both rich
and poor soils, producing an abundance of


foliage; bears hard feeding, and is one of the
best grasses to stand both winter and summer.
Poa ccespiiosa, Nees (Weeping Polly Grass)
fine grass, with rather a tufty habit of growth,
generally met with upon rich soils, where it
produces freely.
Poa Parviflora, R.B.—Very abundant annual
grass, and affords good feed to stock through-
out the season.
Perotis rara , R.B. —Good pasture grass, quick
grower, and affords succulent feed.
Sporobolus elongatus, R. B.—Fine open pasture
grass, found throughout the colony. Its nume-
rous penetrating roots enable it to resist severe
drought.
Siipa Dichelachne, Steud.—One of the best
winter grasses; quick grower and abundant

THE TIMBERS OF QUEENSLAND.
Owing in some measure to the vast area of Queens-
land, but principally to the diversity of its soil, climate,
and altitude, there are perhaps a greater variety of
indigenous timber-yielding trees than are to be met
with in any of the other Australian Colonies. The
deep ravines and sheltered valleys, and the high
mountain sides even in the same latitude, furnish
different varieties. of timber; and again, the same
varieties grown in different situations and under
different climatic influences, present a different
appearance.
The specimens exhibited are chosen chiefly for their
economic value. The list, however, does not include
one-fourth of the species that have already been des-
cribed, and there are also many that have not yet been
classified. Each district of this immense territory is
characterised by features in its vegetation peculiar to
itself, and years must elapse before they are all known
and botanically arranged.
On. the north-east coast a rich field for scientific
investigation exists, even if it were confined to timbers
of strictly economic value. Very many trees that are
known in other parts of Australia are to be found
there, together with those that are peculiar to Queens-
land, and our knowledge of the latter would, no doubt.


be largely increased were the country explored with a
view to ascertaining its natural vegetable wealth.
This would doubtless be the case were a stimulus
afforded by the opening-up of an export trade. Before
this can be accomplished, it is requisite that samples
of the timbers, a description of their uses and qualities,
together with the market price (where possible),
should be accessible to purchasers. With this object
in view the present collection has been formed.
It appears inseparable, from the state of affairs in a
young colony, that very little time or trouble should
be devoted to experiment, or to the improvement of
existing processes. The same timbers that the first
settlers made use of, are still employed as a matter of
course for the same purposes, and timbers in many
instances of a superior description, are neglected or
used only as firewood.
It will be for the practical builder, the shipwright,
and the cabinet-maker, to pronounce an opinion upon
the qualities of the timbers represented, and it is pro-
bable that many of them will have a greater value
placed upon them than they receive in Queensland.
The value of some descriptions of the Australian
Eucalypti for building and railway purposes has been
for some time past fully recognised, and the number
of species in Queensland is greater than in other parts
of Australia. But, at the same time, there appears to
be but little doubt that many of the Eucalypti produce
timber so much alike, that one piece cannot well be
distinguished from another, even when obtained from
trees having well defined botanical distinctions. In
addition to this genera, there are a variety of timbers
that are remarkable for their strength, durability, fine**
ness of grain, or ornamental appearance, which


renders many of them eminently adapted for the pur-
poses of the cabinet maker.
Wherever it is possible, the price for which these
timbers can be delivered alongside, ready for ship-
ment, is given, and where such is not the case, a slight
advance on the price of Eucalyptus timber may be
quoted, unles the timber is small and not of frequent
occurrence, and if persons in the trade are desirous of
making definite offers for a supply of these timbers,
they are requested to communicate with the Agent-
General, who will afford them the requisite information.
CATALOGUE OF THE TIMBERS OF
QUEENSLAND.
CONIFERS.
I. Araucaria Bidzuilli, Hook. (Bunya Bunya).—
Diameter, 30 to 48 inches ; height, 100 to 200
feet. A noble tree, inhabiting the scrubs in the
district between the Brisbane and the Burnett
Rivers. In the twenty-seventh parallel it grows
thickly over a portion of country, in extent
about thirty miles long by twelve broad. The
timber is not only very strong and good, but it
is full of beautiful veins, and capable of being
polished and worked with the greatest facility.
The cones produced on the upper branches,
with the apex downwards, are large, measuring
9 to 12 inches in length and 10 inches in dia-
meter.
2, Araucaria Cunninghamii, Ait. (Moreton Bay Pine).
—Diameter, 36 to 66 inches ; height, 1 $0 to 200
feet. This is one of the most useful trees in
Queensland. It covers immense tracts of land


along the coast and in the interior. The tim-
ber is an article of great commercial importance,
and is extensively used in the colony, and a
considerable quantity exported to the southern
colonies. The timber is strong and durable
when kept dry, and is also very durable in the
bottoms of vessels when kept constantly wet,
but soon decays when exposed to alternate
damp and dryness. When procured from the
mountains in the interior it is fine-grained and
is susceptible of a high polish, which excels
that of a satin wood or bird’s-eye maple. The
market value at the present time is from 555. to
70s. per thousand superficial feet.
Dammara robusta, Moore, (Kaurie or Dundathu
Pine). —Diameter, 36 to 72 inches ; height, 80
to 130 feet. This fine tree inhabits the alluvial
banks on rivers near the coast, in the Wide Bay
District principally. The timber is fine-grained,
free from knots, and easily worked. The
market value at the present time is 70s. per
thousand superficial feet.

growing on barren sandy soils. The timber is
an article of great importance ; it is durable,
fine-grained, fragrant, and capable of a high
polish ; it is used for piles of wharves and for
sheathing punts and boats ; it resists the
attacks of cobra and white ants, and the root
is valued by cabinet-makers for veneering
purposes. The market value at the present
time is 120 J. per thouand superficial feet.


5. Callitris verrucosa , R. B. (the Desert Cypress Pine.
—Diameter, 12 to 24 inches ; height, 50 to
70 feet. A handsome tree, scattered through
