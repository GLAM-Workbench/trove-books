The Roman
and the E
?Wherever one turns in this Empire of ours, one finds
the Roman Catholic Church aiding and abetting the King's
enemies.?
T *
In these words a Catholic correspondent of the Times
states a problem, or part of a problem, which has long exer-
cised thinking Englishmen: and the recent action of the Irish
bishops in throwing down the gauntlet to the British Go-
vernment, and officially supporting resistance to conscrip-
tion, has focused public attention upon it. Too much, per-
haps, has bï¿½en said about the altitude of the Pope and the
Vatican towards the Entente, too little about the open enmity
and subterranean plotting of the Church <as a whole against
the Allies. Lord Bryce, in his Holyj Roman Empire ,
quotes the mediaeval reformer, Marsilius* of Padua, to the
effect that the Church does not consist im any special sense
of the clergy (or the Papal hierarchy), but of all Christians
belonging to it; and it is very necessary that this point
should be borne in mind at the present jumcture. What the
Pope is saying or thinking is infinitely leess important than
what the priests and their flocks are doing. Let me pre-
mise that the following pages are writtem, not from a sec-
tarian, but from a purely national standpoint: the writer
is wholly uninterested in theological squiabbles, save in so
far as they affect the Empire and its ciitizens. He is not
attacking", the loyal?Catholic community of Great Britain,
or (as one paper puts it) ?restoring the llheological tempera-
ture of the days of Titus Oates.? No *sane person would
dr'eami of attacking staunch patriots like ILofd Denbigh and


the other English Catholics who have giVen vent to their
flaming indignation against the misdeeds of their co-reli-
gionists ; and our respectful sympathy goes out to them in
the somewhat difficult position in which their Church places
them. I am simply drawing attention to a state' of things
which constitutes a grave menace to ourselves and our Allies.
The charges?endorsed, as I have indicated, by many
Catholics of light and leading?which the Entente brings
against the Roman Church are briefly the following?
The Vatican has never been really neutral in the great
conflict, but has furtively, though actively, espoused the
cause of the Central Powers.
It has made itself the instrument of German policy, and
been the centre and inspiration of much enemy intrigue,
with disastrous results to our holy cause.
It is not denied that an abominable plot, resulting in the
blowing up of two Italian battleships and other injuries to
the Allies, was hatched by an inmate of its walls in close
relation to the Supreme Pontiff.
It is held to be largely responsible, whether by accident
or design, for the insidious propaganda which undermined
the loyalty of Italian troops, and brought about the Isonzo
debacle.
It has connived at, if it did not originate, scurrilous
attacks in clerical newspapers against the Entente in
general and England in particular.
The Pope is charged with sins of commission and omis-
sion.
Head of the most powerful religious organisation in the
world, he has steadily refused to utter any public or
effective protest against specific crimes, methods of bar-
barism, and violations of international law of which the
Central Powers have been proved guilty.


By his silence he has betrayed the sacred trust reposed
in him under his claim to be THE DIVINELY
APPOINTED AND SUPREME INTERPRETER
AND DEFENDER OF ETERNAL LAW.
The peace he suggested in his famous Note was a Ger-
man and anti-Ally peace, and the Note itself bears internal
evidence of German inspiration.
Catholic clerics and laymen in neutral and Allied coun-
tries have worked against the Entente by every means
in their power.
In Ireland and Quebec, the only two large Romanist
territories of the Empire, the mass of the Catholic popu-
lation are either actively disloyal or at best half-hearted
in our cause. Australian ecclesiastics follow suit by
preaching sedition.
To sum up, in every country where the power and the
influence of the Papacy prevail we find the mighty forces
of dogmatic religion actively arrayed in opposition to the
Allies.
The evidence on which these accusations are based is direct
and indirect. Here and there it is not altogether convinc-
ing, and certain charges which are at present only matters
of more or less justifiable suspicion have been erroneously
taken as proved; but more than enough remains to support
a formidable indictment. Let us briefly summarise the more
salient facts and examine the inferences which may reason-
ably be drawn from them, beginning with the case of the
notorious Monsignor Gerlach.
Our newspapers, for some unknown reason, did not give
this case half the prominence which its importance de-
served, and which it received in Catholic journals, with
the result that not one Protestant in ten appears to have
even so much as heard of Monsignor Gerlach and his plots.
I will therefore shortly retell the story. This Austrian
or, as some say, Bavarian prelate was the Papal Master of
the Robes, the friend and confidant of Benedict XV., who
in December, 1916, sent him on a special mission to France


as the bearer of three Cardinals? hats for French bishops !
Early in 1917 a brilliant coup by the Roman police resulted
in Gerlach being revealed as the author?together with a
business agent of Vatican prelates and other ecclesiastics,
the editor of a clerical journal, and three others ?of a series
of intrigues and plots, extending over a year and a half,
which resulted amongst other things in the destruction of
two Italian battleships, the Benedetto Brin and the Lionardo
da Vinci. He fled the country before he could be arrested,
but was found guilty in his absence of high treason, espion-
age, and other crimes, and sentenced to penal servitude for
life. The Court handsomely exonerated the Holy See from
ail complicity in these plots, which a serious Catholic is
reported to have described as ?the worst betrayal since
Judas. ??
It should be observed, however, that no process was
taken by the Pope against the traitor Roman prelate,
though some action of this kind was generally expected.
Moreover, there is a Latin proverb which says that a man
must be judged by the company he keeps, and I submit that
this Gerlach episode demands some explanation from the
Pope which has not hitherto been forthcoming. How came
it about that Benedict XV., himself (as I am informed)
partly Austrian by birth, kept this Austrian or Bavarian
prelate?an enemy subject?as his associate and right-hand
man after war was declared, maintaining with him an in-
timate relationship and bestowing on him a confidence which
was so grossly abused? Further, is it wholly unreasonable,
in face of what went on in Italy during the two months pre-
ceding the Isonzo disaster, and of the known political bias
of the Pope?s entourage, to suppose that there may have
been other people besides Gerlach about his august person
who were engaged in similar intrigues? Cardinal Gasparri,
the Papal Secretary, denies that the Vatican was implicated
in the disruptive propaganda, now admitted to be of
Romanist origin, designed to corrupt Italian soldiers; but,
as the Pope presumably did not suspect Gerlach, who for
eighteen months was successfully plotting under his very
nose.


he obviously is not in a position to answer for the integrity
of all his other numerous subordinates.
To avoid suspicion of bias, I will mention a limited number
of facts and events which are vouched for by Catholic
writers. Mr. Richard Bagot has described the campaign
of slander and vituperation against England and the Allies
carried on by Roman papers with the knowledge of the Vati-
can and the sanction of the clerical Parties, the propaganda
by leaflets and pamphlets distributed through clerical agen-
cies, and the methods employed to corrupt slightly wounded
soldiers about to return to the front; and the pages of the
Tablet contain much that confirms his statements. I have
myself been told, for instance, that the Isonzo disaster was
brought about by clerical intrigue acting on ignorant, priest-
ridden Southern troops; and the Tablet of September 15,
1917, quoted the case of the Corriere del Friuli , a Catholic
newspaper published at Udine, then the headquarters of the
Italian Army.
This paper told the soldiers that the Pope in his Note
had expressed a fervent desire for peace, and it practically
advised them to comply with his wishes by abandoning
their trenches?which they did in the most effectual
manner possible.
The Pope ordered the journal to cease publication, and
there were other papers which the military authorities had
to suppress. From the Times of November 15 we learn that
an article in the Unitd Cattolica , written jointly by the editor
appointed at the wish of the Pope (who is more closely con-
nected with Romish journalism than is generally supposed)
and the Cardinal Archbishop of Florence, stated that it was
not the Pope who was an advocate of German ideas, but
that it was the ?yeast of subversive Ultramontane ideas
which poisoned the heart and perverted the mind of those
unfortunates who failed in their sacred duty.? We have
here an official admission of clerical responsibility for this
great disaster to the Allies. The Cornere d'ltalia* an
tThe Italian Courier.


authorised exponent of Roman policy, tells us that
the loyalty of Italian Catholics rests on their re-
ligion. A somewhat insecure foundation, I venture to
suggest; when the interests of motherland and Mother
Church Conflict, the former is apt to come off second best:
and the paper proceeded to prove my contention by attack-
ing England venomously and playing Germany?s game by
endeavouring to sow dissension amongst the Allies. The
?hyena of the Vatican? (the Italian nickname for the great
Jesuit organ, the Civiltd CattolicaX) bared its teeth and
snarled fiercely, as usual at Britain and British policy, in
an article full of calumnies and misrepresentations which
earned the condemnation of the Tablet .*
It will be seen, therefore, that there is come confirmation
from Catholic sources of the assertion that the Italian troops
were demoralised through clerical influence, and that the
propaganda which brought about such disastrous results
was largely based on the Pope?s Peace Note. ?The general
effect of the Pope?s Note was deplorable,? says Mr. Edward
Marshall, the well-known American journalist, in a dispatch
to the Daily Chronicle.
?Men who had fought bravely in the Italian army before
it was issued stopped fighting when they thought the Pope
had bade them to do so,? because they thought ?the
Pope?s Austrian affiliation, reputed to be powerful, gave to
his Note real Austrian authority, and that, also, it must
express the will of the German Centre or Catholic Party.?
The clerics joined hands with the Socialists in the work-
ing out of Germany?s carefully prepared plans; but it was
the religious influence that proved the decisive factor in
the process of corrupting the troops. It must also be
JThe Catholic Citizen.
*The Tablet , however, did not give us the Civiltd*s nickname, or
state the fact that it occupies a unique and privileged position in Roman
journalism. By a Brief of Pius IX. it was proclaimed in 1866 to
be the special organ for teaching the Church?s true doctrine; and
the writers on its staff were formed into a special corporation, in 'per-
petuity, as an organic institution of the Church. The ?hyena?s? pro-
nouncements, therefore, have a more than ordinary significance.


remembered that authoritative Jesuit writers like Father
Gury, whose Compendium has been appointed, in Catholic
seminaries in all lands, as the standard manual of Moral
Theology, furnish disloyal persons with all sorts of effec-
tive means of checkmating Government action. Soldiers
may find in these books convenient excuses for deserting
from the colours or otherwise shirking their duties; and the
Italian priests were only acting on principles approved by
the Church.*
Meanwhile, in the country districts, the ignorant peasan-
try were ?on their knees before the Madonna, thanking
her for the peace the Pope had already brought; others
were saying that if peace had not yet come it was all the
fault of that old witch England. ?f
The Pope asserts that he is absolutely neutral, and bis
Cardinal Secretary told us in 1915 that His Holiness had
?peremptorily imposed the strictest and most absolute im-
partiality? on the Catholic Press. The citations I have
given above form a sufficient comment on this latter state-
ment; and it may be well to repeat that the Pope?s con-
nexion with, and authority over, the Romanist Press is very
considerable. As to the motives of the clerical Press the
Tablet (which has shown throughout the war a sturdy
patriotism deserving of all praise) states that there was a
widespread belief, which in one instance at least was proved
*Gury?s Compendium (in Latin) is before me as I write, and I find
his principles utterly subversive of military discipline. Briefly, he
says (Vol. 1., p. 472) that a soldier who serves in an unjust war is
responsible for every act of injury perpetrated by himself individu-
ally, and, proportionately, for the total injury wrought by the army ;
and he proceeds to supply the soldier with pleas that make it easy for
him to desert with a clear conscience. To take one example, a deserter
need not return to the colours if he thinks (the soldier is apparently
to be the judge) that he will incur great risk to his salvation (si grave
salutis pericidum offenderet) \ (1) if, for instance, adequate provision
is not made for the confessional : (2) if he expects to be severely
punished on his return : (3) if the war is an unjust one. Gury?s works,
like other Catholic manuals, contain many maxims calculated to weaken
allegiance to the State. (See The Jesuits, by W. C. Cartwright, M.P.)
t The Tablet , September 15, 1917.


to be well founded, that some Catholic newspapers in Italy
were subsidised by Germany; and the Holy Father's orders
were not always observed. Let us admit frankly that the
Pope's position is by no means an easy one.
His interests obviously incline him to our enemies? side,
while his intensely pro=German environment renders genu-
ine impartiality exceedingly difficult.
The tone and temper of his entourage are indicated by such
things as the Gerlach episode,
the refusal to permit a Requiem Mass to be celebrated in
Rome for murdered Belgian priests,
the attitude of the Papal Press,
the official solemnisation of the Kaiser?s birthday.
the perpetual presence in the Vatican of Austrian and
German Ministers,
the close association of Monsignor Tacci-Porcelli with the
Germans in Belgium (he left Havre for Brussels to ba
near them),
the Austro=German affiliations of representatives of the
Holy See in enemy countries,
the activities in Rome of ?the propagandist arch-plotter?
Erzberger, and many other things.
The Vatican?s desire to please the Central Powers was
shown by its specially exempting Germany from the extra-
ordinary Ne Temere and Motu Proprio decrees, which
have caused so much commotion in Ireland; Hungary was
later on similarly privileged.
The fault of Benedict XV. has been that throughout the
present crisis he has maintained a much stricter neutrality
in the great conflict between right and wrong than in the
purely secular quarrel between the Entente and the Central
Powers; and his silence on the moral issue, his failure to
make any effective protest against proved atrocities, will be
remembered against him when history records her verdict
on the whole case. His advocates tell us that it would have


been highly impolitic for him to interfere. To this the
voice of humanity can only reply, ? ?lmpolitic?? Possibly.
But right and reason say, ?Confound your politics: drop
politics for once, which have for long ages been the curse
of your creed and its ministers.
Do your duty like a man and a Christian Archpriest,
and cry shame upon the wrong. Act boldly in accordance
with your lofty title, Avenger of Eternal Law; and you
will gain far more spiritually, and in the long run, than
you will ever lose politically.? ?
But the Pope, who protested promptly enough against an
alleged violation of international law by the Italian Govern-
ment when it sent the Austrian Ambassador at the Vatican
about his business, is afraid lest speaking out against shame-
ful crime and villainy might offend the Germanic Powers,
and so (as one able writer puts it) ?endanger the salvation
of millions of souls?! There is a quaintly mediaeval flavour
about the latter argument. ?It is your task, Holy Father,
to convert the men of whom President Wilson finally de-
spaired.? So said M. I?Abbe Sertillanges in his great
sermon in the Madeleine; but the job had no attractions
for His Holiness. Yet would the Pope do well to remember
that his illustrious compatriot, Dante, found a special and
highly unpleasant inferno, infested with wasps and hornets
and other venomous creatures, reserved for all such as were
neutral in the eternal war between good and evil:
Nor yet were true to God, but for themselves
Were only . . . Fame of them the world hath none,
Nor suffers; mercy and justice scorn them both.
? lnferno , canto iii., 35; Carey?s translation.
I regret to have to add that in this ?secret place? the poet
also discovered one of His Holiness? predecessors in office
confined I?-a man
who to base fear
Yielding, abjured his high estate.


Whatever Benedict XV. and his advisers may be thinking
or doing behind their screen of silence and alleged neutrality,
the hostility of the Church in general towards the Entente
cannot be controverted. To what extent the Vatican, indi-
vidual members of the Curia, or their associates have been
pulling the strings, ï¿½we do not yet know; but that they
have been so occupied is absolutely certain.
Rome is confronted by the undoubted fact that wher-
ever her religion, which is controlled by the Holy See,
prevails, we find bitter and highly mischievous opposition
to the Allied cause.
Of Italy we have already spoken. In Spain two prelates
have spoken out manfully in support of our cause, but the
vast majority of clerics and clericals in the Peninsula form
the mainstay and backbone of the reactionary Parties which
afford shelter to German submarines, permitted one of them
to escape, and in other ways have helped our enemies to
the utmost of their power. The Spanish Sol told us how
certain Madrid priests, on the occasion of the Kaiser?s last
birthday, substituted a prayer for the All-Highest in lieu
of the customary one for King Alfonso. In the Argentine
Republic the insidious pro-German and anti-British propa-
ganda, which gravely imperils English capital invested in
the country, is stated to be largely based on sacerdotal
influence, whether worked from the Vatican or Madrid.
The audacious defiance of the British Government by the
Irish hierarchy puts the coping-stone on a long course
of* ecclesiastical action hostile to England and the Allies.
The bishops counsel resistance to the law; the May-
nooth=trained parish priest joins hands with Sinn Fein
rebels shouting for the Kaiser and Britain?s downfall.
Origen thought that ??the priest must be a little god.? In
Ireland he is a very great god, though his intellect and other
qualities are not always exactly god-like.
The people regard him as a sort of wizard, a medicine-
man with miraculous endowments, an indispensable medi-


ator gifted with special powers of propitiating the celestial
authorities. To oppose him even in such purely mun-
dane matters as butter-making, pig-killing, or the raan-
aging of waterworks, is to court disaster in this life: to
die under the displeasure of Mother Church is to risk
?something humorous and lingering, with boiling oil in
it,? in the great hereafter. Everywhere the individual
cowers before the organised ecclesiastical terror.
Catholics and Protestants, Home-Rulers and Unionists,
Ulstermen and Gaelic-Leaguers, are found in agreement as
to these facts, and unite in bewailing their direful conse-
quences. Poverty, squalor, sloth, and ignorance rule over
a people sinking to decay, that Rome?s empire may be main-
tained intact. And all the weight of her vast spiritual
forces ?perverted, as usual, to purely secular ends ?is now
being thrown into the scale against this country.
In Quebec, no less, we find sectarian separatism fanned
into a flame by clerical bigotry and obscurantism. There
the line of cleavage is even more directly a religious one,
and a spirit of isolation and parochialism is the inevitable
result. A French writer tells us how the two races are
shepherded apart by their priests and pastors, just as in
Ireland they are herded, as Mr. Ryan says in The Pope's
Green Island , in ?separate sectarian concentration camps.?
French Canadians have two Mother Countries; but the bulk
of them, nursing a questionable grievance, have refused to
fight for either.
It is urged in their defence, and we may readily accept
the plea, that thousands of them would willingly serve
if the pressure of their Church were removed; but the
great body of ecclesiastics, ?invincibly hostile and dan-
gerously active,? have interposed their veto. The cur6s
solidly obstructed recruiting in the villages, telling the
people that the war was a judgment on Fran" for her
irreligion.
In the debates of the Canadian Parliament various "peakers


THE ROMAN CHURCH AND THE ENTENTE
described how Government recruiting was system tically
hampered;
one officer was practically hounded out of the villages
by the Catholic clergy, who told thd people to let the Eng-
lish go to the front: when they were killed Frenchmen
could take their jobs.
The clericals threatened revolt, opposed money ants
for the war, and hampered Sir Robert Bordern?s effr s in
every possible way. Their so-called Nationalist leader ' ï¿½rote
a book vilifying England and all her works, whicl was
warmly praised by a Quebec cardinal, two archbishop and
several bishops.
Australian ecclesiastics showed no less zeal on behalf
of the Empire?s enemies. The Archbishop of Melbourne,
who holds a commission in His Majesty?s Forces as Chap-
lain-General, backed by the subordinate clergy, preached
sedition so successfully that, mainly through their e ff orts,
the vital Conscription Bill was defeated. 11
The Vatican denies responsibility for these things. The
Pope, we are told, ?is not a politician.? If this r leed
be so, I can only say that he is the first of his line ir \his
respect for many hundreds of years.
The Holy See is a polity no less than a religious insti-
tution; the Vatican, as I think Father Tyrell says, is
a bureaucracy exploiting the Altar and its mysteries for
secular ends and in the interests of a purely temporal sove-
reignty.
It regards politics, in fact, as a branch of morals and
as such subservient to the Holy See: the world holds no
keener politicians than the Latin Church?s priests and hier-
archy. The Catholic Union of Great Britain has coura-

20, 1916. Vol. 88, No. 124. Pages 1566-67. Mr. DILLON : ?Every-
one now 'knows it was the Irish in Australia who defeated con-
scription for that country.?


geously informed the Pope that it disapproves of the Church?s
political activities; but, unfortunately, the Church has never
throughout its long career ceased from meddling in secular
concerns, and there is not the smallest prospect of its mend-
ing its ways. The Council must know that it is demanding
the impossible. It is asking the leopard to change his
spots ?a thing which the animal has no wish to do, and
which it is incapable of doing if it wished.
The sectarian spirit of Rome, with its inflexible prin-
ciple of social and political severance, of detachment from
patriotic life and aims, is ever a sucker on the spirit of
nationality. The Church is, and has been throughout
the ages, the State?s implacable foe. t
She regiments its partisans against their Governments,
keeps men apart, and sows dissension. Love of country
is regarded as a menace to her supremacy : it is her business
to disengage men from ail mundane attachments, to ?estab-
lish a moral solitude,? and win everything and all human
beings for religion alone. ?God wants all?; loyalty and
civic duty should be placed at ecclesiastical disposal. Eccle-
siastical authority the Catholic Encyclopedia reminds us,
is compelled at times to impose directions which call for
the sacrifice of patriotic ideas or dreams; and so it has come
about that
in this war the hostile authority of Rome has lost to the
Allies hundreds of thousands of good fighting men, brought
disaster on their arms, and seriously weakened our Im-
perial constancy and will to victory.
I do not for a moment suggest that religion has been
the only influence at work. There are always sectional
and racial issues involved, contradictions and cross-currents
of various kinds. " Ireland has her Land Question and Sepa-
ration Movement, which are supported by others than pro-
fessing Catholics. Quebec has her language and education
controversies, which, though they concern French Roman-
ists only and directly threaten sacerdotal supremacy, cannot
be described as purely sectarian.


Still, the broad, unpleasant fact remains that the bulk
of the most dangerous enemies within our gates are Roman
Catholics, men whose loyalty, like that of Italian Papists,
is largely conditioned by their creed; men who are subject
to their priests and not allowed to think as they like in
matters spiritual or temporal, and whose mental bias and
attitude towards life as a whole are shaped by their reli-
gious views. And above the people is the spiritual mas-
tery of the clergy, the terrible power reposed in them by
Rome ?a power that no man, were he the best or wisest
that earth has to show, is fit to exercise?while over all
is the system which holds that the voice of the Vatican
is the voice of God. It is religion that supplies the uni-
fying force and the drlving=power which make our enemies
so formidable.
We could snap our fingers at Irish, Canadian, or Aus-
tralian clerics but for the glamour with which Rome invests
them. The Archbishop of Melbourne, ?leading his flock
along the paths of sedition? * (as an Australian Catholic said),
might possibly, were he plain Dr. Mannix, be regarded as
a negligible quantity; but Dr. Mannix, armed with Papal
thunders and acting as the authorised representative of the
great World-Priest and would-be World-Monarch, ?the
Arbiter of eternal weal or woe? ?Dr. Mannix, thus for-
midably equipped for miscief, showed himself in the recent
Australian elections* a force that had to be reckoned with.
The threats of Judgment Day terrors, hurled by Gre-
gory VII. at William the Conqueror if he dared to disobey
t|je Papal edicts, have their modern counterpart in the bully-
ing by Irish and Canadian priests of laymen who will not
vote as they are told or rebel in other ways against eccle-
siastical pretensions. Ireland is not the only country where
people hesitate to antagonise, even in material things, a
man who is credited with some mysterious, if undefined,
influence over their fate in the Great Beyond.
is meant, 20th December, 1917. The disloyal party
were defeated both in the Senate and the House of Representatives at
tke General Elections on May sth, 1917.


Militarism and priestcraft are twin plagues of our modern
world. Militarism is now the more pressing danger of the
two, priestcraft the more subtle and penetrating. If the
priest persists in acting as the tool of militarism, means of
counteracting his activities must be devised.
The Roman Church, as Cardinal Bourne said the other
day, is the only one that dares to say to a man, ??You
must!?
Its theocratic yearnings are as insatiable as the Prussian
Junker?s lust of world-power; and, like him, it combines
with dictation, persistent meddling in other people?s affairs.
Ihe Jesuits have been described as the stormy petrels of
politics; and of the modern Papacy the Jesuit can now say,
?L?Etat, c?est moi.?* Nearly every European country has
been compelled in its time to take protective measures
against the Order?s subterranean plotting and intrigue, its
disruptive tendencies, and persistent efforts to clog s the
machinery of the State. How successful those efforts often
are we Allies know to-day only too well.
J he right of defending itself against open or covert
enemies cannot be denied to any Government or people;
and if the Roman Church ?whether through the Pope,
the Vatican, the hierarchy, the priests, or the laymen?
continues to make war against the Empire and its com-
rades in arms, we may be forced, in face of continued
acts of aggression, to reconsider our attitude towards the
Pap'pl organisation as a whole. A political Church
is a thorn in the flesh of Society, a disturbing foreign
element weakening the State?s authority. Ours is, be-
yond all others, the land of toleration; but when-
ever Rome encroaches on other people?s pre-
serves, trespasses on ground that is not rightly
hers, she must be warned off the premises.

Lord Curzon's Evidence
and the Irish R. C. Bishops' attempted denial.
LORD CURZON AND THE IRISH CLERGY.
(To the Editor of the ?Morning Post?).
Sir, ?In the evening newspapers of yesterday Dr. Fogarty,
R.C. Bishop of Killaloe, referring to my speech in the House
of Lords, on June 20, is reported to have spoken as follows
at Limerick on Sunday, June 23 : -
?Lord Curzon presumed to say that the Bishops and
clergy of Ireland compelled other people to oppose conscrip-
tion under the threat of eternal damnation. AH he would
say about Lord Curzon?s very insulting remark was that it
was not only vulgar, but a vulgar falsehood, unworthy of
his rank and the high place he holds before the world.?
In the ?Freeman?s Journal? of June 22, Dr. McKenna,
Bishop of Clogher, is thus reported :
?Everybody would read with indignation a speech made
by a man very high up in the Government. He committed
himself to the statement that the Irish Bishops had com-
pelled the Catholics of Ireland to subscribe to the pledge
against conscription under the threat of eternal damnation.
He (Dr. McKenna) said that was untrue, and, further, that
the man who made that statement knew it was untrue; that
it was a deliberate calumny on his part, and a calumny
against which they protested, not that they (the Bishops)
cared what those people said. I was a calumny deliberately
made for other purposes to misrepresent Ireland before the
world, to misrepresent} her especially in those countries
where she might obtain sympathy and support. It was a
continuation of that misrepresentation that had been going
on for seven hundred years.?


In the ?Freeman?s Journal? of Monday, June 24, Cardinal
Logue is reported to have said to an interviewer on Satur-
day, that, so far as the Bishops were concerned, there was
not a word of truth in my ?outrageous statement.?
It is a pity that the Right Reverend Bishops did not verify
their quotations. If reference be made to my speech (Official
Report, published on the next morning, June 21, p. 330) it
will be seen that what I said was that:
The Roman Catholic clergy in Ireland advised their
flocks, under penalties of eternal damnation, to resist con-
scription to the uttermost.
I made no reference to the Bishops. I did not once men-
tion the Bishops in my speech. So far as that part of the
case, therefore, is concerned, the Bishops? charge against me
is untrue.
Next, as to the ?vulgar falsehood? of which I am alleged
to have been guilty, about the Irish priests, I append a num-
ber of extracts from recent utterances by them, which were
the foundations of the statement that I made :
On Sunday, 21st April, 1918, at a meeting, after Mass
at Castletownbere, held to protest against conscription, the
Rev. Charles Brennan, C.C., said they should resist it, that
they should all approach the sacraments and be ready to
die in their resistance, and that dying in their resistance
they would die with the full blessing of God and the Church
upon them. If they (the police) enforced it the people should
kill them the same as they would kill any man who would
attempt to take away from them their lives, and that the
police had no right to their lives if they came to arrest any
Irishman under the Conscription Act ... If the soldiers
did attempt to enforce conscription they should be treated in
the same way as the police. When the police and military
would die in enforcing the Act?as die they would should they
attempt to enforce it ?they would die enemies of God, whilst
the people would die at peace with God and under His
blessing and that of the Church.


Ob the 21st April, 1918, the Rev. Father Lynch, address-
ing - the congregation in Ryehill Roman Catholic Church,
said: 4 'Do ye resist conscription by every means in your
power; any minion of ' the English Government who shoots
one of you, especially if he is a Roman Catholic, is guilty
of mortal sin, and God will cry to Heaven for vengeance.?
On the 21st April, 1918, the Rev. Father Murphy, C.C.,
addressing the congregation in Kilgarvan Roman Catholic
Chapel, said that any Irishman who assisted the Govern-
ment to enforce conscription in Ireland, as well as being
a traitor to his country, is morally committing a sin against
the law of God.
On April 21st, 1918, the Rev. James Mclnerney, at Mass,
Scarriff, said: ?No Roman Catholic Irishman, no matter
what position he held, could assist in the enforcement of con-
scription in this country without being a renegade to his
faith. ?
On April 21st, 1918, the Rev. Father Donnelly Murrough
said: ?Those who were the means of enforcing it were
guilty of a mortal sin, because they had no legal right to put
such an Act in force against the wishes of the Irish people.?
On April 28th, 1918, Father O?Callaghan, after Mass,
Killyclogher, said: ?If any conscription is enforced, any
policeman who assists in any way in enforcing it is guilty
of murder and can never get absolution.?
On April 28th, 1918, Father Murphy, at Divine Service
at Killenena Roman Catholic Church, said: ?On last Sunday
I asked the police to throw off their jackets from a moral
point of view as they were nationalists and Irishmen with
the same Irish blood flowing through their veins, but to-day
I ask them from a spiritual point of view to do so, because
all Irishmen are asked by the Irish Hierarchy not to do any-
thing to facilitate conscription, and that if any policeman
went out to force Irishmen to join the English Army and
was shot when doing so he would be damned in hell, even
though he may be in the state of grace that morning.?


The Rev. Gerald Dennehy, C.C., of Eyries, County Cork,
told about three hundred men who received the sacrament
in his chapel that any Catholic policeman or agent of the
Government who assisted in putting conscription in force
would be excommunicated and cursed by the Roman Catho-
lic Church ; that the curse of God would follow them in every
land; and he asked his hearers to kill them at sight; they
uould be blessed by God, and this would be the most ac-
ceptable sacrifice that could be offered.
These quotations might very easily be multiplied.?Yours,

TWO RECENT LETTERS to the ?LONDON TIMES.?
VOILA LENNEMI.
The Hierarchy and the Civil Power.
(To the Editor of the Times.)
Sir, ?Sunday, April 2 1, 1918, is a day that will live in
history. For on that day?through the length and breadth
of Ireland?there was celebrated a strange and fateful Mass.
The enacting of the glorious and beautiful ritual of the
Roman Catholic Church was made the occasion, by the
Roman Catholic Hierarchy, for the sending forth of a fiat,
a solemn command, to the men of Ireland. At the end of
this fateful Mass the monstrance was raised aloft, the bell
was tolled, and the Sacred Host was exposed for the kneel-
ing people to adore. Again?in the mystical sense ?had
Christ, our Lord, been nailed to the Cross. Again?in the
mystical sense ?had He died for the sins of Man. For this
is the inner meaning of the glorious and beautiful ritual
of the Roman Catholic Church.
As I have said, this Mass was made the occasion for
the sending forth of a fiat, a solemn command, to the men
of Ireland. What was that fiat? What was that com-
mand? It was that Irishmen were not to go forth and
fight the battle of liberty. They were to be shirkers and
traitors. Not .traitors to England, but traitors to Humanity.
1 hey were to be traitors to the brave and straight men
of their own race, who had shed their blood, and who had
died in France. I hey were to be heedless of the voice of
the child, and the voice of the woman who cried out to
them for help. T hey were to stand by while foul outrage
and murder was being done. They were to pretend that
they thought that this war was England?s war. Even at
the very best?even if their own local quarrel with England
regarding Home Rule were settled to their satisfaction?
they were to wait for months before they would think even
of coming into the fight for the liberty of man.
Such was the fiat, such was the solemn command, that
was given to the men of Ireland by the Roman Catholic
Hierarchy, on the Sunday I have named. And the mass
whereof I speak was used to solemnise this command. Thou-
sands upon thousands of the men of Ireland agreed to abide
by this command.


And now a word of so as to this Mass that was used
to expoit the command that was laid upon the men of Ire-
land. I am at one with the Most Reverend Dr. O?Dea,
when he says that the Mass ought not to be used for any
political purpose. lam at one with him when he says
that to deal so with the Mass is a profanation and a sacri-
lege. Here are his lordship?s words :
?But that any Catholic, knowing what the Mass is, should
ask or press the Church to *pail Christ again to the Cross
and put Him to death in the Mass, not for the souls of men,
but to show off the strength of one party against another,
or to commit the Church to the support of either, and so
to strengthen either , party against the other in the country
?I ask, could any greater sacrilege be committed against
Christ, our Lord, or against the Mass? . . . May God
save us from prostituting the death of Christ in the Mass
to any passing worldly or political object.?
I accept his lordship?s view, and, this being so,
I, as a Roman Catholic, take this occasion to deny the
validity of the Mass that was celebrated throughout the
length and breadth of Ireland last Sunday. When the
Sacred Host was exposed in the monstrance, it was ex=
posed for an evil purpose. That purpose was to prevent
Ireland from doing her duty by Humanity.
Berlin was behind this Mass. It was celebrated for the
purpose of helping the Hun to crush and enslave mankind.
The Vatican took its orders from Berlin, and the Bishops
in Ireland took their orders from the Vatican. This Mass
was a profanation of a most sacred and holy rite.
The Vatican has thrown off the mask. It is at one
with Berlin, for Berlin has promised to it temporal power.
This is an open secret. The Vatican was behind the defeat
of Italy. The Vatican is working with the Hun. It has
condoned his horrible and bestial crimes. And now it has
come out openly in Ireland. It is betraying Irishmen
to eternal shame and dishonour so as to help Germany.
The ecclesiastical politician! He is of all politicians the
most deadly and the most sinister. He means, in the end,
the doom of the Roman Catholic Church. He holds sway
Jn Rome. He is the Vatican. The Vatican has betrayed
the Roman Catholic Church. The Vatican has betrayed
mankind. The Vatican has betrayed Christ.

(To the Editor of the Times.)
Sir, ?It has always, to my mind, been difficult to be a
loyal subject of the King and at the same time a Roman
Catholic. Ihe difficulties at seem insuperable.
Wherever one turns in this Empire of ours, one finds the
Roman Catholic Church aiding and abetting the King?s
enemies; sometimes openly, but more often in that darkness
in which the Church prefers to act. The forking in the
dark is difficult to meet, but in Ireland now the Church has
shown her hand openly. It should therefore be possible
to meet the open challenge.
I have had the best Catholic education, viz., at Stony-
hurst College and the Oratory School, and I am in a posi-
tion to know both sides of the question. It has always
been hard to bear patiently the intolerance which the Church
shows towards her own children, in denying them the exer-
cise of their own tfree will; but her attitude, and especially
her political attitude, towards those outside her fold is noth-
ing more nor less than Prussianism. I was pained as an
Englishman to read the words of the Cardinal Secretary
of State (Cardinal Gasparri), on the occasion of the cap-
ture of Jerusalem : ?While there should be legitimate thanks-
giving that the Holy City has been rescued from the Infidel,
it is to be regretted that that rescue should have been accom-
plished by a Power not of the true faith.? I was hurt to
hear from Australians that Archbishop Mannix, of Sydney,
exercised in his religious capacity, the strongest opposi-
tion to conscription on Australia, so much so that two
judges of the Roman Catholic faith openly disassociated
themselves from the attitude of their Archbishop. I was
shocked to read Mr. Hughes? speech in Canada, in which
he accounted for the Roman Catholic opposition to con-
scription in Quebec by political interference on the part of
a Church which desired to revenge itself for its treatment
in France.
I can find no words to express my disgust at the atti-
tude of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland to-day. The
Church is far too well disciplined from Rome for there to
be any possibility of trouble in Ireland, Quebec, or Australia,
arising without the knowledge of Rome. It appears to
me that Rome is deliberately challenging the British Empire,
and that she believes the Central Powers will win this war!


She is granted a tolerance in the British Empire which she
would never be granted in Germany, a tolerance which she
never shows herself in Catholic countries. My only object
in writing this letter is to warn those in England who are
daily being converted to Rome, Anglican clergy included.
I hope this letter may give them pause to think. I con-
sider the secession to Rome to be a national danger. I
myself am going in the opposite direction, convinced that
I am steering towards religious freedom as surely as my
country is steering towards the freedom of nations. I
revolt from religious ?Prussianism? and the training of
priests to be ?Prussian? * drill sergeants, as surely as I
know my country revolts from that real Prussianism against
which the world is fighting, but for which the Vatican has
consistently shown its sympathy by word and deed, and
by every artifice in its &c.,
