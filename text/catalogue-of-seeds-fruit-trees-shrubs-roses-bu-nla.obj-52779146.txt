PREFACE.
IN submitting our General Catalogue of Seeds, Fruit Trees, Grecn-bouso Plants,
Shrubs, Boses, Bulbous Boots, &c., &c., for 18YX>, it has been our endeavour to
make selection of such kinds as our experience has proved to bo the best, and most-
distinct in their respective classes.
The great variety of Seeds and Plants' now under cultivation, renders it
difficult to enumerate all; and with the view of assisting amateurs in planting, it is
deemed desirable to name only such as are considered the most worthy of being
cultivated, together with a Monthly Calendar of Operations for the Year.
Prom our knowledge of the Nursery and Seed Business, and the facilities wo
possess, at the Lilydale Nursery, Marrickville, wo are now, in a position to execute all
favours which may be entrusted to us with care and despatch, and at the lowest current
prices.

CALENDAR OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR.
JANUARY.
Kitchen Garden. —Owing to tlie boat at this season of tho year, very little can ho clone in the way of
sowing seeds, unless by artificial watering. If sura of rain, sowing can he done with safety. Water
vegetable beds freely in any weather, and when water is required, give a good soaking or none, as a
more sprinkling is more injurious than otherwise. Whore water is scarce, much protection may ho
afforded by mulching tho ground with stable litter, tan hark, or grass. All ground unoccupied should
ho dug, turning down all cabbage leaves, turnip tops, and such green refuse,'which form a valuable
manure ; heavy land should ho turned roughly—the exposure to tho sun will improve tho texture of
such soils. In favourable weather sow French Beans, Brocoli, Cauliflower, Cabbage, Peas, Onions,
Eadish, for autumn and winter use, Seeds such ns Cabbage, &0., should bo sown thickly in small beds
under a little covering, and kept well watered until tho plants are strong. Plant out ’Cabbage,
Cauliflower, &0., in favourable weather. Watch tho beehives lost tho swarms go astray.
Mower Garden. —Woods will require to bo kept down, and to keep a good show 'of flowers, will
require ottontion, watering early in tho morning preferred, as the ground is cool and will not injure tho
roots. Dahlias may bo planted, and those which are in flower may bo thinned out and tied to tho
stake. Tall growing plants will require tioing and staking.
Orchard. —Keep tho surface of tho ground clean and open by hoeing' or forking it over. Fruit
shoul ho gathered as it ripona. Stop all long shoots by pinching off tho ends. Vines should bo tied as
they grow, as tiro wind greatly injures tho foliago by dashing it against the espaliers or stakes; remove
all suokors and laterals every ton days. Thin out fruit on those trees that are ovor-hurclenod.
Farm.— Destroy woods before they seed. Break up laud for future crops. Sow Capo Barley for
green fodder, and Sorghum for lato crop.
FEBRUARY.
Kitchen Garden. —This should ho a soason of activity. Dig roughly all unoccupied ground, adding
well decomposed manure; tho land not immediately required will bo improved by exposure, and the
remainder will bo ready tho first shower. Transplant Cabbage, Cauliflower, Celery, &o.; sow French
Beans, Boot, Carrots, Turnips, and Peas for main crop; former sowings should ho turned out and kept
clear of woods. Mulch round tho Melon and Cucumber holes with a good dressing of long stable
manure, and it assists in keeping tho fruit clean and froo from dampness. IE tho weather is very dry,
and tho plants appear to suffer, give them a good soaking of water; it is hotter to depend entirely on
mulching than to give a more sprinkling of water, more especially to plants exposed to tho sun at this
soason, Seeds of plants previously selected should bo collected as they ripen, and before tho pods are
too brittle. Cucumbers, Melons, French Beans, should bo looked over every day, and gathered whether
they are required or not, for if left on to perfect their seeds the plants will soon cease to bo productive,
or form ill-sliaped inferior fruit.
■ Mower Garden. — Tho dry weather experienced at thin season of tho year materially c amagos tho
appearance of this department. Continue to lay Carnations, Picotoes, &0., &o,; thin out and tie up
Dahlias. Gather flower soeds as they ripen. Keep woods down and rake all borders, so as to look
clean and trim.
Orchard. —Tie up loose shoots of tho Vine, and ho careful not to hruiso tho wood or injure tho foliago.
Prop up such trees or plants as require support. If young trees are to bo planted out during the
approaching season, procure a supply of virgin soil and manure, mix it and lay it up iu a heap to
sweeten, it will well repay tho labour. _
Farm. —Continue to prepare land, ploughing it deeply. Turnips may ho sown for winter. Sow
Capa Barley, and Sorghum should be sown for green feed for stock. Plant early potatoes with light
•coat of manure,


march;
Kitchen Garden. —Keep all bods clear of weeds by frequent and (loop booing. Plant out Cabbage,
Cauliflower, Calory, Brussels Sprouts, &e., for succession. Always have bods dug in dry weather, full
depth, and manured, so that every shower may bo availed of lor transplanting. Sow English Beans,
Trench Beans, Boot, Carrot, Turnip, Parsnip—in fact, a general sowing. Sow all vegetables in rows,
about two foot apart, os they got more air, and are much easier kept clean.
Flower Garden. —As the season is now getting milder, you may safoly remove all screens or other
shelter, and allow the plants to have thobonofit of tiro atmosphere. Autumn flowering plants and shrubs
will have a very gay appearance; lot all walks and borders bo gone over, and everything made tidy;
fork in mulching manure; keep hoeing; clip edgings and hedges; continue to tie and Stake plants ;
store matured bulbs, &c,; plant out largely for winter flowers.
Orchard —No crops should bo sown, near young fruit trees, if so it ought to bo on tho outskirts of tho
foliage, so as to give tho trees every obauoo of success, Bo careful when digging near Orange trees not
to injure the roots, as the top roots run in all directions near the surface of the ground; to injure tho
roots tbo branches are liable to disease and die off.- All laud intended to bo planted this season ought
to be well trenched, manured, and, if possible, cropped. So as to got the 'soil in good condition when
planting takes place, and to ensure success, drain your ground at least three foot deep, and fill up with
stone's nine intihos ; if drain pipes cannot be had, then a layer of long grass or other rubbish on the
stones so as to prevent tho loose soil from choking the drain.
Farm. —Continue to break up land, Sow Lucerne, Clover, Eye Grass, Oats, Barley, and Wheat.
Gather in Maize, and plant Potatoes; out Tobacco as it arrives at maturity.
APRIL.
Kitchen Garden.— Hoe continually among crops to keep them clean ; have hods well dug and manured
for transplanting tho various vegetables now coming on. Thin out all crops that arc overcrowded;
divide and plant out pot herbs, giving a little water if required until established. Sow English Beans,
Pens, Onions, Radish, Lettuce, Mustard, and Cress, &c. Early Celery should ho earthed up in dry
weather, go over them first carefully with your hands, tho one holding up tho loaves, tho other earthing
round each plant, so ns to prevent tho loose soil from getting between tho leaves, fill up occasionally,
and it will bo ready in about two months.
Flower Garde w.—Tbo operations of this month greatly depend upon tbo weather; if wotplanta to bo
removed or planted, may be done at once, as there is some chance of getting them established before
dry weather acts in again ; Camellias, Gardenias, <fco., &c„ will remove with safety. Plant out all soft-
wooded plants, such ns Verbonias, Petunias, Ponstomons, &o.; cut away all dead branches, hoe all
borders, and stake plants that may require it. Plant bulbs and mark them with a stick, so as not to
destroy thorn in hoeing or digging.
Orchard —About the latter end of this month transplanting of young trees should ho proceeded with
so as to ho established in their position before tho final fall of tho loaf—it puts away all risk of a dry
spring, which is so injurious to newly planted trees; this will apply to nearly all fruit trees, more
particularly to evergreens, such as Oranges, Lemons, Loqnnta, Bananas, &o>
Farm. —Sow Vetches, Lucerne, Wheat, Barley, Oats. Maize will bo getting ready for quilling.
Gather Sorghum sued as it ripens. Cotton will require attention. Cut and house Tobacco as it comes
to iiiaturily,
MAY.
Kitchen Garden— Prepare all ground by digging and manuring for succession crops, Plant out
Cabbage, Cauliflower, &a, ; sow Beans, Peas, Radish, Lettuce, Onions, &o. ; look over the Celery rows,
dig ami prepare hods for Asparagus. In preparing beds for Asparagus, choose tho best soil in the
garden, and trench it at least eighteen inches deep, with ft good supply of manure and salt, let it remain
a fortnight, after that peg out your bods four feet wide, leaving a path two foot wide oacli side of your
beds, Plant four rows in each bod, keeping the front rows nine inches from (lie side, cover tbo crowns
at least three inches with good loose soil and manure mixed, rake to a smooth surface ; in the spring a
dressing of salt may bo applied.
Flower Garden, —Last month's calendar will suit this month. Prepare ground that, is to bo planted,.


and o,g soon as rain comes plant out at once. Out back and prune all trees and shrubs ready for digging,
Dahlia roots mar be taken up and placed in a shady place out of doors.
Orchard.— Transplant fruit trees of all descriptions, so as they will get well established during the
winter; transplant Strawberries —the most prolific are Trollope’s Victoria, Marguerite, and Sir Harry ;
pruning may be commenced at oneo, so as to get digging and manuring. done during the winter months!
■ Farm.—lt the sowing was neglected, do it at oneo. Out Tobacco ; pick Ootton.
JUNE.
Kitchen Garden. —At this season of the year no colonial seed should be sown, as the plants will run to
Seed just as they are hearting. English Seed will not run the first season, and should therefore he
exclusively used until September, when the danger will bo past. Hoe well among growing crops;
transplant Horse-radish, Eschalots, Rhubarb, Strawberries, and Sea Kale ; dig over old Rhubarb beds,
and plant Sea Kalo, anil Asparagus, using plenty of rotten manure. Sow Brocoli, Brussels Sprouts,
Cabbage, also Red Cabbage, Cauliflower, Lettuce, Peas, Beans, and Radish.
Flower Garden. —Planting should be proceeded with, also the taking up and dividing herbaceous
plants. Prune Roses, and cut off all straggling branches of trees and shrubs; turfing ought to be done
at once,
Orchard. —Now is the season for pruning Vinos and other fruit trees, and as it is so beneficial for
good fruit, it would well repay to got a good practical gardener to finish all pruning, so that the trees
may not bo injured through had pruning; if possible get the planting of fruit trees and strawberries
done this month, as it is the best uiocltb ftw planting.
Farm. —Some of the most successful cultivators of Lucerne consider this month the most favourable
for sowing that seed. Sow Oats, Vetches, &o.; prepare land for Potatoes, Carrots, Mangold Wurzel,
and other crops. Potatoes may bo planted in early positions, sheltered from the south-west,
JULY,
Kitchen Garden. —In sowing seeds after rain, see that the land does not clog, or it will bo injurious to
tho seed in coming up. The soil should never ho walked over or disturbed by sowing or digging the
crops until sufficiently dry to ho friable. If people wore to take this advice, there would he less failures
in seed sowing, which is too often blamed for bad. sood. Sow Cauliflower, main crop of Carrots, Turnips,
Beans, Lottuoo, Radish, Spinach, &c.; plant out Onions, Eschalots, and Potatoes. The soil for Onions
being generally of ft rich description, the crop is often iix clanger of being smothered if sown in hods, the
woods growing so fust ; if sown in rows yon can always run the hoe between. Keep the hoe going in dry
weather, for ground full of weeds is only a harbour for slugs and other garden pests.
Flower Garden. —Winter work ought to ho in an advanced state. Pill up blanks, and thin out where
over-crowded ; turf and top-dress lawns j lay and repair verges, and keep all walks in good order and
condition.
Orchard. —This is a good time to brush over tho stems of fruit trees with a strong compound as n cure
and preventive of disease ; to secure a good compound, 1 lb." of sulphur, 1 lb. of soft soap, i lb. of tobacco,
boil together, then add hot lime and soot to the thickness of paint (tho soot is only wanted to make tho
compound as near tho colour of tho stem as possible, so ns not to ho unsightly), which will promote the
health of fruit trees and Vines, also tend greatly to protect them from the attacks of insects. Prepare
laud that has boon neglected j plant grape Vines ; inspect all fruit trees to see that all suckers and cross
branches are out away; eradicate all docks and other strong-growing weeds.
AUGUST,
Kitchen Garden. —Peas sown tins month should ho in beds with a cool aspect, as south or south-east;
at this season groat advantage would bo gained by sowing tho land with salt, at tho rate of 7 or 8 lbs. to
the porch—if tends to sweeten tho land and destroy insects ; discourage woods and retain moisture. Sow
Beet, Broouli, Melons, Brussels Sprouts, Cucumbers, Pumpkins, Rhubarb, Parsley, Lettuce, Radish,
Spinach, Tomato, and Tobacco, (largo sowings) Leeks, Cabbage, Cauliflower, Turnip, and Parsnip, and
plant Potatoes. Keep the crops oloar of woods, and destroy any plants infested with aphis.
Flower Garden.— Complete tho planting and pruning, also the digging of all hods and borders, and
the repairing of walks and lawns. Plant out Hollyhocks, Dianthus, Pansies, Antirrhinums, Verbenas


Petunias, &o. Sow Cockscombs, Phloxes, Amaranthus, Zinnias, &o, Stake and tie all trees and
shrubs that may require it, clip hedges, edgings, <&o. .
Orchard.— Every effort should bo made to complete the transplanting by the end of this month, as
much labour in watering and shelter will be caused if the early growing kinds have to bo removed after
this month, Any work loft over from last month should bo completed. Keep the ground clean, and
the surface open to receive the dews and showers. Look over the Orange trees, and see if any insects
are beginning their destruction, if so, apply the compound before stated 5 if the young Orange trees are
showing too much flower, take it carefully off to encourage the foliage—they often die bank after
excessive blooming.
Farm. —Clean the crops put in last month; plant potatoes, sow white and yellow Maize, Turnips,
&so. ; if Clover, Lucerne, and Grass are not sown, do it at once,
SEPTEMBER.
Kitchen Garden. —This is one of our boat months for general cropping. Sow largely of almost every-
thing in the way of vegetables. Plant largely in Potatoes; in the interim transplant Cabbage and
Cauliflower for succession ; water Asparagus bedtf if the weather bo dry ; plant out Jerusalem
Artichokes, Rhubarb, and Ginger.
Mower Garden. —A few Dahlias for early flowering may safely bo planted; place tho others in a
moist corner so as to encourage them to start gently, Keep a good look out for slugs. Groat care
must bo taken in watering and shading newly-planted plants, as tho westerly winds are generally
severe at this season of tho year. Keep all woods down and fill up vacancies with herbaceous plants. ■
Orchard. —Recently-planted trees will require careful attention until they are established, giving a
good soaking of water if tho weather prove dry. Orange trees may bo planted in cloudy weather, but
only those that are still in a state of rest. Grape vines should bo gone over occasionally to remove all
superfluous wood and suckers, if tho weather is moist use tho sulphur dredge or bellows to present tho
oidium. You may still plant out Strawberries.
Farm. —Clean and earth up growing crops; plant out Sugar Cane, Arrowroot, Sweet Potatoes, Maize,
Potatoes, &c.; sow Prairie Grass, Cotton, &o.
OCTOBER.
Kitchen Garden, —Keep tho crops clean, and water whore necessary. Sow X’arslcy, English Doans,
French Kidney Beans, Mustard Oress, Radish, Lettuce, Cucumbers, &o,; transplant Oabbago, taking
care to chock the aphis on their first appearance,
Flower Garden.— The principal work to bo attended to this month is raking bods and borders,
keeping tho walks clean, mowing, clipping edgings, watering, staking, and shading, as tho weather is
generally very hot at this season of tho year.
Orchard, —Thin out tho crop on tho early poach trees whore tho crop is too heavy, prop up tho
branches that are liable to fall; remove suckers from vinos ns directed last month, tie up tho branches
as they extend, but so as not to cut or bruise tho loaves; remove superabundant fruit: plant out
Bananas.
Jfum.—Keep all crops clear of weeds, and plant and sow as per last month.
NOVEMBER.
Kitchen Garden— As tho season advances tho advantage of having tho ground trenched will become
more apparent; shallow-worked land will scarcely grow anything worth collecting. Full space must
bo allowed between the crops during tho summer months, or they will bo drawn and worthless,—ample
room and high cultivation are tho most economical in tho long run, Cucumber and Melon plants should
bo thinned out whore overcrowded, tho earth loosened among them, and tho branches fastened down as
they extend, so as tho strong winds will not destroy them. Keep all ground clean and clear of woods
by frequent hoeing. Sow French Doans, Melons, Broooli, Mustard Gross, Lettuce, Radish, Bumpkins,
and Cucumbers; transplant in calm cloudy weather for succession.
Flower Garden.— Tho Dahlias that wore put in a moist place will bo sufficiently started to Cutup and
plant out, Reserve the strongest plants, tho weaker ones may be kept back and planted later, so as to
ensure flowor.for tho autumn. Bulbs that are done flowering and getting ripe should now bo taken up
and stored in a dry place for the season. Mark all bulbs that are to remain in tho ground, so as not to
injure them when digging, Keep the surface of tho ground loose, so as to prevent woods from growing.


Orchard.— The eud of this month the China Peaches will require thinning, so as to swell the
remainder As soon as the fruit is fit for cooking, then thin out, so as not to lose any of the fruit; clear
out all useless wood; remove all suckers from Crape vines, stop any straggling branches, rub off
ill-placed shoots, so as to throw vigour into the leaders for next season’s fruiting, as well as the
advantage to the present crop.
Farm.— Constant attention should be given to the crops to keep them clean ; use the horse hoe, and
cultivator to economise labour. In making Oaten Hay out the crop when well in oar, but before the
seed is near maturity, the whole plant is then in its most nourishing state, and the seed will not shed.
BEGXMBER.
Kitchen Garden.— French Beans, Cucumbers, Vegetable Marrows, &o„ should he gathered
immediately they are fit for use, whether they are required or not, for if left on the plants will soon
cease to hoar. Sow Cabbage and Cauliflower seed—groat difficulty will be experienced in getting it to
grow at this season, sow in a shady place; sow French Beans, Mustard Cress, 4<s. Manure and dig
ground as the crops come off, so as to be in readiness for the first shower. Allow no ground to be
occupied with stumps, weeds, and rubbish, to harbour insects, vermin, and disease.
Flower Garden. —As the Grass lawns are the chief attraction, care should he taken to keep it closely
mown, and all weeds taxon out; keep all walks clear of woods. Perpetual Roses may he out hack, so as
to got fresh wood for bloom ; cut Petunias well back, as they will be getting unsightly by this time.
Sow a good supply ol autumn (lowering annuals. Keep all straggling plants staked and tied, Dahlias
will require thinning out and tioing.
Orchard ,—Attend to last month’s instructions; place straw or long grass under the fruit-bearing
trees, so as not to bruise or injure the fruit as it falls. Tie up the shoots of Vines, taking care not to
injure tho leaves. The centre of trees ought to bo looked to, so as to keep them open in the centre;
begin and trench ground intended for planting next season, and tako n crop off it before planting, as it
greatly improves the texture of tiro soil for planting young trees.
Farm. —Too much oaro onu scarcely bo bestowed upon'Potatoos dug up this month to protect them
from tho sun : they should bo dug up as soon as ripe, as they are liable to rot in the ground from the
great heat. Keep the crops clean, and thin out whore overcrowded.
aDIGhGKOSTGK
Tins, though simple, is frequently mismanaged in its performance, tiro chief objects are to renew the
soil for the roots of plants, and to pulverize it to tiro depth of tho spado, so that air and moisture may bo
admitted and maintained. The proper manner of doing it is to take out at one end of the ground a
clear trench tho full depth and breadth of the spade, and wheel tho soil removed to tho further end of
the ground to finish off with; thou fill tho above and every successive trench, by digging
perpendicularly narrow spaces tho depth of tho spado, turning tho soil regularly upside down, and
leaving no small divisions on the surface untouched. It is a common practice with labourers, digging
by contract, to turn over largo patches of tho surface at each stamp, by inserting the spade in a sloping
direction, this enables them to got sooner done with tho work, hut it leaves a great portion of the
ground, a littlo under tho surface, like a succession of terraces unturned.
roßKiiira-
Is simply turning over tho soil with a strong three or four-pronged fork, and this implement ought to
ho used, in preference to tho spado, among trees and plants, and all permanent crops, where tho roots are
liable to ho out; it ought also to ho used invariably in strong Soils, where there is a difficulty in
penetrating and pulverising with tho spade.
TR,Bisrcxa:iffsrc3-
Is a most important moans of improving soil; it serves tho same purpose as digging, but more
effectually. Thoro are various methods, according to tho different kinds of soil; a_ naturally deep soil
should ho trenched fully two foot deep, more particularly if required for tho cultivation of trees ,■ shallow
soil should bo done as deeply as possible. Some soils, sandy for instance, are so poor that they require

others of a stronger kind, or manure, added to them to give them consistence. In these, oases, the top
spit, or that nearest tho surface, is turned oyer into the bottom of the trench, being the beat, ■while tho
under or lowest spit is turned uppermost, being the worst, and is mixed with soil of better quality, or
manure, so that the whole depth is materially improved. In shallow soils, with a very stiff olay subsoil,
a portion of the latter should be thrown up to ,the surface, collected in heaps and burned, and then spread
out and mixed well with the soil.
Trenching, as digging, should he done systematically, and not in a careless manner, thus —marie out tho
ground to be trenched into squares two and a half feet wide across, remove tho whole of the soil out of
the first space the full depth, and wheel it to where tho work is to terminate, then turn over tho top spit
of tho next space into the bottom of the newly-made trench, placing manure or improving soil thoroon ;
now put tho bottom spit over that already laid, and continue so to tho end of tho work.
MtTXjOHiXISrCS-
Is a covering of stable straw in a half decomposed state spread on the surface of tho ground, over and a
foot beyond tho extremities of the roots of plants, two or three inches in thickness, applied during
extremely dry weather, to retard evaporation, to reduce the temperature at tho roots, and to retain, tho
porosity of the soil, which should have been well loosened when mulched.
Ton DnESSUffI is a light covering of any light soil or manure laid over small seeds, whoa sown -in stiff
soils, to promote vegetation. It sometimes is a manure or compound of soils spread on tho surface over
certain crops, such as Asparagus, tho substance of which is carried into tho soil by heavy ruin.
dDRA^ITTIISra-.
One of the primary steps to increase tho fertility of nearly every description of land is drainage, whioh
is attended with numerous advantages. Atmospheric infiiienco is not confined only to tho surface, hut,
by the removal of superabundant moisture, is enabled to penetrate into the lowest depths of tho soil, tho
results of which avo most strikingly manifest after rain—tho temperature is equalised, and tho otherwise
cold undersoil possesses the gonial warmth throughout tho growing season, nourishment suitable to tho
growth of plants is conveyed to their roots, noxious matter is washed ont,_ manure and vegetable refuse
are more speedily decomposed, and carbonic acid and other gases essential to plants, are produced in
abundance, while a stiff olay soil is rendered mellow and friable.
Tho depths and distances apart for making drains will vary according to tho description and feature of
the laud —an average distance is twenty feet—heavy soils need thorn closer, while light 01106 will do
with them further apart, branch drains being laid about throo foot deep, and main ones about four foot
deep. Main drains, where there are more than one, should ho at least 100 foot apart. Ono. or two-inok
pipes are very suitable for ordinary purposes, and may bo covered with a few inches of stones or cinders
overlaid with turf, straw, or, best of. all, the tops of the common tea troo, and filled up with, soil to tho
surface.

The OonieeiiS aro considered tiro grandest of Ornamental Trees; they nvo, for tlio most part, evergreen,
and thrive in any common soil, if deeply worked. They are best raised from seed ; but some kinds are
not yet obtainable in that way, and are found to do perfectly well grafted, when united to a proper stock.
Whore there is sufficient space, the Pines, Araucarias, and some of the Ouprossasos, should enter largely
into the composition of scenery ; in more limited grounds, the Junipers, Thujas, and Thujopsis, oto. My
stock is largo and healthy.
