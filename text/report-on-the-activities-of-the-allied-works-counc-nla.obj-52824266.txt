FOREWORD
DURING the latter portion of 1943 a report was issued covering the activities
of the Allied Works Council from its formation on February 26, 1942, until
June 30, 1943.
The period covered by the present report is from July 1, 1943, until
February 15, 1945, the date upon which the Council was severed from the
Department of Interior under Senator the Hon. J. S. Ceilings as Minister,
and incorporated within the framework of the newly formed Department of
Works with the Hon. H. P. Lazzarini as Minister for Works.
The system of organisation evolved during the earlier period of the
Council’s existence, and described fully in the previous report, continued to
function without major changes during the period now under review.
A gradual change in the nature and extent of the works has occurred
owing to the lessening needs of the Service Departments for war works, and
the increasing requests of all Departments for the planning and construction
of works required in the transitional period from War to Peace. This work
includes the planning of projects'which are likely to be of immediate Post-
War value.
The great increase in Commonwealth assets brought about by the heavy
building and works programmes over the past six years has presented a
major problem of proper inspection and maintenance, and the Council has
had to organise accordingly.
On October 30, 1944, the Hon. E. G. Theodore resigned from the
position of Director-General of Allied Works, a post which he had held
with great distinction from the inception of the Council.
During the last few months a number of Senior Officers who had been
seconded either from Governmental bodies. Local Government organisations,
or from private business life have returned to their former avocations after
rendering valuable service. Reference is made to a number of these officers
in the first chapter of the body of the report.
The expenditure by the Council during the period dealt with in this
report amounted to £68,000,000.

CHAPTER
1
HISTORY OF
THE ALLIED WORKS COUNCIL
Between July 1, 1943, and February 15,
1945, the Allied Works Council continued to
function as the principal constructional authority
for the implementation of military works
requirements within the Commonwealth of
Australia.
Authorisations under the Capital Works Programme
during the period totalled £95.915,409, as against
£108,920,595 for the period from February 26, 1942,
to June 30, 1943, while expenditure totalled
£65,425,790, as against £79,304,830.
About 43 per cent, of the total expenditure was
incurred in respect of works executed for the American
Forces, thus establishing a substantial contribution to
Reverse Lend Lease Aid.
The basic organisation evolved during the first year
of the Council’s existence, and during which the
amalgamation of the Works and Services Branch of
the Department of the Interior and the Allied Works
Council was consolidated under the latter title,
remained practically unaltered. It continued to
function through a series of directorates which
individually control matters pertaining to Personnel,
Finance, Mechanical Equipment and Materials Supply,
and Works ( encompassing Engineering, Architecture,
and Administration).
The composition of the Allied Works Council itself
remained unaltered until October 30, 1944, its
members consisting of:—
The Hon. E. G. Theodore, Director-General of
Allied Works;
Mr. C. A. Hoy, Assistant Director-General of
Allied Works;
A nominee of the Commanding-General of the
U.S. Armed Forces in Australia (Col. H. R.
Cole).
A nominee of the Commanding-General of the
Australian Military Forces (Major-General
C. S. Steele) ;
A nominee of the Commanding Officer of the
Royal Australian Air Force (Group-Captain
E. Knox).
Upon October 30, 1944, Mr. Theodore resigned
from the position of Director-General of Allied Works
and Mr. L. F. Loder, formerly Chairman of the
Victorian Country Roads Board, was appointed to
succeed him. At the same time Mr. L. J. Price,
formerly Deputy Director of Allied Works in Queens-
land, was appointed as an additional Assistant
Director-General.
Following the death, on June 2, 1943, of Mr.
Clarence Edward Davies, Works Director of the Allied
Works Council in South Australia, Mr. W. G. Lawrie
was appointed Acting Works Director for the State.
Mr. Davies, who had held the position of State Works
Director since the inception of the Council, had been
associated with the Department of the Interior
since 1914.
Arising out of the reduction in the Works
Programme in the period under review, certain
major alterations took place in the executive control
of the Council, a number of officers who had been
with the organisation since its inception retiring in
order to resume their previous avocations.
First major resignation occurred on March 31,
1944, when Mr. D. F. H. Packer retired from the
position of Director of Personnel in order to return
to the Army. He was succeeded in that position
by Mr. J. M. Bristow, previously Assistant Director
of Personnel.
Mr. E. F. Borrie retired from the position of
Director of Engineering on October 28, 1944, in order
to return to his post as Engineer-in-Chief to the


Melbourne Metropolitan Board of Works, and Mr.
R. B. Lewis was appointed as his successor.
Mr. J. R. Kemp, who had acted as Deputy Director-
General of Allied Works for Queensland since its
formation, retired on December 5, 1944, in order
to devote his full time to his work as Queensland
Co-ordinator General and Main Roads Commissioner.
His duties in the Council were undertaken by Mr.
H. W. Barker, Works Director, who was later appointed
as Acting Deputy Director-General of Allied Works.
Mr. Bristow resigned as Director of Personnel on
January 6, 1945, and was succeeded by Mr. N. F.
White, who had acted as his Assistant Director of
Personnel,
On January 31, 1945, Mr. W. K. Black resigned
from the position of Director of Finance in order
to return to the Zinc Corporation Ltd. He was
succeeded by Mr. W. H. Viney, formerly Director
of Administration.
The Council continued the policy of the previous
period, whereby it utilised the services of a large
number of State instrumentalities to organise and
execute much of its engineering construction pro-
gramme, so obtaining the benefits to be derived from
the trained staffs and accumulated experience of those
instrumentalities.
More than 20 public organisations throughout
Australia have taken part in the works being carried
out by the Allied Works Council. Some of these are:—
Queensland Main Roads Commission
Queensland Harbors and Marine Department
Queensland Public Works Department
New South Wales Department of Main Roads
New South Wales Metropolitan Water, Sewerage
and Drainage Board
New South Wales Public Works Department
New South Wales Maritime Service Board
New South Wales Water Conservation and Irriga-
tion Commission
Sydney County Council
Victorian Country Roads Board
Victorian Public Works Department
Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works
Victorian Railways Department
Victorian State Rivers and Water Supply Com-
mission
Melbourne Harbor Trust
Cairns Hydro-Electric Board
Brisbane City Council
Cairns Harbor Board
Townsville Harbor Board
Electricity Commission of Victoria
South Australian Highways and Local Govern-
ment Department
South Australian Engineering and Water Supply
Department
South Australian Harbors Board
West Australian Public Works, Water Supply and
Labor Department
West Australian Main Roads Department
and
Tasmanian Public Works Department
A large proportion of the building construction
included in the programme was carried out under
contract conditions, “Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee” agreements.
The latter were undertaken by this means owing to
the extreme urgency of the works in question, which
precluded the preparation of detailed drawings and
specifications essential to the invitation of tenders on
a firm price basis.
With the improved strategic position, the urgency
of many works of this nature has lessened, particularly
in Southern areas, and, except in isolated instances,
reversion to firm tendering has been adopted as a
policy.
At February 15, 1945, the Allied Works Council
had carried out 2,151 major projects, 1,128 of which
had been completed during the period under review,
while a further 457 were under construction. In
addition, there were thousands of projects costing
less than £5,000 each.
Upon February 2, 1945, the establishment of a
Commonwealth Department of Works was gazetted,
and the Hon. H. P. Lazzarini was appointed Minister
for Works, and became responsible for the administra-
tion of the National Security Regulations under which
the Allied Works Council functions.
A new position of Director-General of Works,
Department of Works, was created, and Mr. Loder
was appointed thereto as Permanent Head of the
new Department.
The Director-General of Works is responsible under
the National Security (Allied Works) Regulations
and the National Security (Aliens Service) Regula-
tions for the functions hitherto performed under the
designation of Director-General of Allied Works, the
latter title being abolished as from February 15, 1945.

CHAPTER
2
POST-WAR WORKS
During the past twelve months a great deal has been
accomplished in the matter of formulating and planning
a programme of Commonwealth works that will be
undertaken in the post-war period.
As an outcome of the formation of the National
Works Council for the purpose of considering the
post-war public works programmes of the Common-
wealth and the various State Governments, the
Commonwealth Post-War Works Reviewing Committee
was recently set up under the Chairmanship of the
Assistant Director-General of Allied Works, who is
also Assistant Co-Ordinator General of Works, to
deal with the programme of the Commonwealth
Government.
It is the function of this Committee to review the
programmes submitted by the various Commonwealth
Departments and Administering Authorities before
they are forwarded to the Co-Ordinator General of
Works.
Intensive post-war planning has been carried out
by the Postmaster-General’s Department, the Depart-
ment of Health, the Commonwealth Railways, the
Department of the Interior and the Commonwealth
Bank of Australia, and the programmes of these
Authorities were being dealt with by the Committee
at the close of the year under review.
Sketch plans, estimates, etc., for many of these
projects are already being undertaken and will be
followed up by working drawings and the necessary
particulars as quickly as circumstances will permit.
Authorities were dealt with by the Committee prior
to the last meeting of the National Works Council,
which was held in August, 1944.
During recent months the Commonwealth Post-War
Works Reviewing Committee has received the post-
war programmes prepared by the Council for Scien-
tific and Industrial Research, the Department of Civil
Aviation, the Department of Trade and Customs and
the Repatriation Commission.
As a result of the recommendations of the Review-
ing Committee with respect to those programmes, the
Council is now engaged on the preparation of the
necessary sketch plans, estimates and relevant data
with a view to advancing the various projects to the
stage of being completely planned for post-war
purposes.
This is placing a further heavy burden on the
Council, and while in the main it affects the technical
staffs, much has also to be done in the Administrative
Section in preparing for the transition from a war-time
to a peace-time programme.

FINANCE DIRECTORATE
In addition to the work represented by the expendi-
ture of over £65 millions between July 1, 1943, and
February 15, 1945, nearly £2 millions was spent by
the Council for other Departments in respect of works
not financed through votes under its control, and on
repairs and maintenance, thus bringing the total
expenditure to something in the vicinity of £6B
millions.
Although a large portion of the programme was
carried out by day labour under the immediate
direction of the Council or various Works instrumen-
talities, nearly 1,000 jobs were carried out under
Contract conditions and Cost-Plus Fixed Fee agree-
ments. The approximate value of these contracts
was £20.5 millions.
The figures set out in Chapter 4 illustrate the total
authorised programme for the Financial Period July
1, 1943, to February 15, 1945, the commitments or
liabilities incurred in respect of such works and the
actual expenditure. The information is tabulated to
show the totals in respect of each of the various
Services and Departments as well as the totals for
each State. The figures recorded in the State ledgers,
however, do not necessarily represent a true picture
as many works are financed through the record of one
State whilst actually executed in another State.
Tasmanian works for example are largely included
in Victorian figures.
A record of the monthly movement of the Works
Programme during the period is shown in graphical
form hereunder. At the commencement of the
financial period authorisations of about £3O millions
and commitments exceeding £l3 millions were brought
forward from the previous year.
The margin by which the expenditure failed to agree
with the estimate of £1 million per week is also shown
by the expenditure target line: —

A dissection of the ex-
penditure for each month
of the Financial Period
under review is given for
each State, together with
Commonwealth Monthly
and Progressive totals in
the following statement.
It is to be noted again
however, that the expendi-
ture shown against each
State is not necessarily a
true picture of the works
actually carried out with-
in that State;—
The expenditure recorded in the financial ledgers in the various States
during the period may be easily appreciated from the following graph:—
BULK PURCHASES AND INDIRECT
EXPENDITURE.
As distinct from the direct expenditure on capital
works, £l2 millions was expended during the period
through the Allied Works Plant and Materials Trust
Account. The functions of this account might briefly
be re-stated as for;
Bulk purchase of plant, equipment and materials
for the use of the Council and other
Departments;
Financing of storage facilities for bulk purchases
and payment of large cartage, freight and
shipping accounts;
Financing of the Council’s canteens and of pool,
transit, and group camps and messes for mem-
bers of the Civil Constructional Corps;

Financing of Civil Constructional Corps com-
pensation, sick leave, holiday pay, annual
leave, waiting time and travelling expenses
which cannot be charged against any one
particular job, and the payment of allotment
moneys to dependants of Corps members.
Financing of repair workshops, both mobile and
fixed, joinery shops, sawmills, quarries and
other special projects which are operated in
association with the conduct of works generally.
The expenditure incurred under these headings is
recovered by a charge against works, by cash from
various Departments and canteens, by transfer against
Reverse Lend Lease Vote in the case of supplies
made available to the American Forces, or by rental
charges in the case of plant and equipment, including
small ships hired against various jobs or to Common-
wealth Departments and State Works instrumentalities.
Of the £22 millions spent from this account during
the period, more than £l9 millions was recovered by
charges of the kind indicated in the preceding para-
graph. During the period of its operation since late
in 1942, a total of £31.8 millions has been debited
against this account, and at February 15, 1945 a
total of £25.4 millions had been recovered.
The total amount authorised through the account
exceeds £35.9 millions. The difference between this
figure and actual expenditure leaves £4.2 millions
yet to be financed through the account, apart altogether
from new commitments that will be raised during the
coming financial year.
Although the total works expenditure declined,
expenditure through the Plant and Materials Trust
Account during the period considerably increased,
largely due to the Council’s handling of earth moving
type equipment throughout Australia for all Service
Departments.

GENERAL
During the period a record number of claims was
passed by all branches to the Treasury for payment,
but as many of these covered groups of accounts it is
impossible to assess exactly how many were actually
handled. Proportionately the volume of work has
far exceeded that of any comparable prior period.
Although overall expenditure has declined, there
is yet little evidence of any slackening in the volume
of work to be handled by the Accounts Organisation
throughout the Commonwealth. This is mainly due
to the normal lag between accounts work and field
activities.

THE PROGRAMME
Expenditure on the capital Works Programme of the Allied Works
Council throughout Australia for the period from July 1, 1943, to
February 15, 1945, was £65,425,790, as compared with £79,304,830 for
the period from February 26, 1942, to June 30, 1943.
This reduction was confined to the Southern section of the Commonwealth,
total expenditure in Queensland and the Northern Territory combined
increasing from £25,835,292 for the period ended June 30, 1943, to
£29,310,938 for the period ended February 15, 1945.
A summary of authorisations, commitments, and expenditure upon the
Council’s Works Programme during the fiscal period ended February 15,
1945, is given in the following table. Examples of the types of works
required by the major Services and Departments are included in the
table, the items not dealt with in this way being mainly minor alterations
to existing administrative or laboratory buildings.

PROJECTS
Although Undertaken purely for purposes of immediate Military
defence during the most critical period of Australia’s history, by its
magnitude and complexity the Works Programme of the Allied Works
Council will have an incalculable influence upon the future development
of the Commonwealth.
While it is still too early to attempt to properly assess the ultimate value of
certain sections of the work carried out, it is clear that the Roads and Aerodrome
construction programmes, Harbour improvements, and Factory construction projects
will play a prominent part in all plans for Australia’s post-war period.
A brief outline of a very limited number of the 1,585 major projects handled
during the period from July 1, 1943, to February 15, 1945 is given in the
following pages.
DOCKS
Two graving docks, of lasting Naval and Mercantile value to Australia, have
been constructed since the outbreak of war in 1939.
The Allied Works Council has been responsible for the first project, and in
the case of the second, which was built by the Queensland Government, the Council
assisted in the supply of labour and equipment.
Situated at Sydney and Brisbane, the docks are of capital ship and cruiser
capacity respectively.

SYDNEY GRAVING DOCK
Work upon the Sydney Graving Dock had advanced
so far by February 15, 1945, that the official opening
date had been fixed for the following March 24,
although a considerable amount of finishing work
remained to be done.
On that date indications were that the finished cost
of the dock would be £9,000,000.
On July 4, 1940, War Cabinet decided that the
Minister for the Interior should be responsible for
the construction of the dock, and a Dock Construc-
tion Section under the control of the Assistant Director-
General was formed. This section has controlled
and co-ordinated the whole of the operations from
the beginning.
On August 7, 1940, a start was made on preliminary
reclamation work.
Late in 1941, when construction of the coffer-dam
by the Public Works Department and the Maritime
Services Board was well in hand, a programme of
work drawn up by the consultants and the Dock
Construction Section provided that the dock should
he ready to take a ship in 1944.
A concise account of the early history of the
project, and the first stages of its construction, was
given in the Allied Works Council Report for the
period ending June 30, 1943, the account covering
development from the time of the first discussions in
1938 up to that date.
Dimensions: The Dock has been constructed on an
area of Sydney Harbour embracing 32 acres, reclaimed
for the purpose of the project. Length from outside
cope at northern end to cope on centre line of dock
at south wall is 1,177 feet. An intermediate caisson
groove enables the dock to be divided into two
compartments.
Width between the east and west copes is 152 feet,
and depth of floor below finished surface level
55.5 feet.
The water capacity is 57,000,000 gallons.
Depth below low water Spring tide is 45.5 feet.
There are two caissons.
About 4miles of roadway and 7 1 /2 miles of rail-
way track, with 45 crossings, have been constructed.
As outlined in the previous report, by June, 1943,
all preliminary work, such as construction and
de-watering of the coffer-dam, excavation and dredging,
and the driving of sheet piling, had been completed,
and a start made upon the construction of the
dock proper.
On June 30, 1943, there were 3,500 men engaged
continually upon the dock, three eight-hour shifts being
worked in most sections. They were employed upon
the following operations: —


1. Construction in mass and reinforced concrete of
actual dock, pump house and sub-station.
2. The erection of gantries for concrete construction.
3. Erection of pumping machinery.
4. Construction of fitting-out wharf, 250 ton crane,
and electrical work.
5. Construction of caissons.
Construction of the dock proper was carried out in
mass concrete. The floor was built up in a mosaic
pattern, in blocks 22 feet square. Five travelling
transporter bridge gantries were used in order to
speed up the process of pouring the floor and the
wall sections.
So as to obtain the full benefit of these Iransporlers.
the outside floor blocks were cast first to allow of the
laying of the rails on which they were to travel.
In all, approximately 330,000 cubic vards of
concrete were poured to form the structure. The
mixing plant used was of an automatic type, and had
an output capacity of 1,200 cubic yards per 8-hour
shift. The cement was supplied not in bags, but in
bulk, and was pumped by special plant to hoppers
over the mixing plant.
Concurrently with this construction, the floating
caissons were built. These are of welded steel con-
struction, fitted with buoyancy tanks, tidal chambers,
and ballast tanks for sinking and floating.
These units were constructed within the area of the
coffer-dam alongside the east wall, because there were
no suitable launching facilities available on which to
build them.
So as to ensure stability, 1,500 tons of billet steel
ballast have been concreted inside the bottom compart-
ments of the caissons.
Cranes: A 250-ton crane is under erection on the
fitting-out wharf. This crane, which is estimated to
cost £280,000, has a lifting capacity ranging from
Concrete mixing plant in background, with rail tracks and hopper
trucks for transporting concrete
40 tons at 171 feet radius to 250 tons at 118 feet
radius, or within 48 feet minimum radius in each
case. In addition there will be two 50-ton cranes at
the dock sides, and a 40-ton travelling crane on the
fitting-out wharf. There will also be two 3-ton electric
cranes, and two 3 to 5-ton mobile cranes.
The main pumps for de-watering the dock, together
with numerous smaller units for servicing of the craft
within the dock, fire fighting, and taking of general
drainage, are fitted into a bomb-proof pump house,
with thick reinforced concrete roof slab. The three
main pumps have 50-inch suctions and 60-inch
deliveries, and are capable of emptying the dock
without a ship in four hours, thus shifting an approxi-
mate total of 57,000,000 gallons. They are driven
by 1.000 k.W. motors at 5,000 volts.
Altogether there are seven sub-stations incorporated
in the dockyard.
Fitting-out wharf: The fitting-out wharf is in
reinforced concrete throughout. The piers of the
main wharf where the 40-ton and 250-ton cranes will
operate are of cylinder type construction. These are
formed by sinking steel cylinders 15 feet in diameter
into the hard clay, after which the clay is excavated
to form a cove bottom, and 12 timber piles driven
to the rock. Tremie concrete is placed around the
timber piles in the sea bed, and the pier completed
as a 7.5 feet cylinder built in the dry within the 15-feet
cylinder. The latter is then removed.
The flooding of the area was carried out by the
opening of two 21-inch valves, set low within the coffer-
dam wall. The process was more or less a gradual one,
as a slow rate of filling is desirable to allow the work
to lake up any stresses gradually and without damage.
The coffer-dam was removed by two dragline
excavators, working from each bank, with a capacity
of moving 100 cubic yards per hour each. The
material from each side of the steel sheet piling was
removed first. The steel sheet piles were then drawn,
and a bucket dredger completed the work.
With the removal of this wall there remained only
the fitting of keel blocks to enable the dock to be
brought into operation, and this was soon afterwards
completed.
There now remained to be completed the erection
of the 250-ton crane, the fitting-out wharf, and much
detail.
The Allied Works Council is being assisted in the
construction of this dock by the New South Wales
Public Works Department, the Maritime Services
Board, Sydney Water and Sewerage Board, Sydney
County Council, the New South Wales Railways, and
a large number of private contractors.

BRISBANE GRAVING DOCK
Situated on the Brisbane River, the Brisbane Graving
Dock was commenced on August 17, 1942, and the
first vessels were docked on June 22, 1944. less than
two years after commencement.
For a dock of its size, this is probably a record in
dock construction.
The dock will accommodate any vessels that can
use the Brisbane River.
Structural engineers claim that the dock site is
possibly the best so far selected anywhere in the world.
Their claim is based on the fact that the site is
composed of soft but extremely watertight sandstone,
thus necessitating the concrete lining of a compara-
tively small area of the dock walls.
The Queensland Government entrusted direction of
the project to the State Co-ordinator General of
Public Works, who also held the position of Queens-
land Deputy Director-General of Allied Works, and to
whom a Board of Engineers was responsible for its
design and supervision.
The Main Roads Commission and Department of
Harbours and Marine carried out the construction with
workmen of the Civil Constructional Corps, dredge and
other employees. Evans Deakin & Co. Ltd. were
contractors for the Caisson construction and Peters’
Slip undertook the shipwright’s work.
The dock became an Allied Works Council project
when the Commonwealth Government agreed to
subsidize the cost of construction to the value of
£350,000, based on the then estimated cost of
£700,000.
Dock wall under construction, showing
concreted and natural surface sections




The estimated cost now stands at £1,093,000, the
increase being due principally to the inclusion of
additional work. The Commonwealth has increased
its contribution to £425,000.
The dock remains the property of the State, and will
be operated by it during the war and for some time
thereafter for ships of war and other vessels, according
to priority determined by the Commonwealth.
Dredging at the entrance was still in progress on
February 15, 1945, but the work is now nearing
completion. The quantity of material which it was
necessary to dredge in order to connect the dock with
the river channel was considerably in excess of the
quantity of earthworks removed in excavating the dock.
CONSTRUCTION.
Excavation: Excavation of the site occupied eight
months, during which time 350,000 cubic yards of
material were removed, the greater proportion being of
solid sandstone. The excavated material was used
for reclamation of mangrove swampland immediately
surrounding the dock area.
Concreting: The minimum of concreting was pro-
vided for. Concrete used totalled 40,000 cubic yards.
Except for the stair walls, the sill area, and wall
surfaces in the vicinity of the pump inlets, which
were of reinforced concrete, the natural sandstone
walls were unlined apart from a coat of gunite.
Manpower: Maximum number of men employed
was 850 for a period of approximately two months,
when concreting and earthworks were together at
their peak. The average number was just over 600.

No serious accidents or industrial disputes occurred
during construction.
Pumps: A 30-inch dredge pump, taken from the
former dredge HERCULES was installed. It is driven
by the original triple-expansion steam engine, which
is capable of developing up to 1,650 h.p. A circular
well was built, forming an underground pumping
station to house the engine and pump. Two 15-inch
diameter electrically-driven auxiliary pumps were
also used. Four water-tube boilers, marine type,
were installed. Two were taken from the dredge
HERCULES and two from the original H.M.A.S.
“AUSTRALIA.”
Cranes: One 40-ton fixed steam crane and four
3-ton Diesel locomotive cranes were installed.
The 4-feet high keel blocks are constructed of
Australian hardwood.
Concrete.piers, which are at 20-ft. intervals, support
the end of the breast shores, and are connected by
timber walks.
In addition, the piers support the rail tracks for
the locomotive cranes which run on either side of
the dock.
Stores and workshop buildings have been erected,
and plans for future expansions and additions to
supplementary workshops prepared.
One of the outstanding features of the undertaking
was the manner in which the constructional authorities
responsible for carrying out the project have impro-
vised, using men and material at hand, thus obviating
the enlistment of highly-skilled labour and the
installation of new and costly equipment.

MARITIME
WORKS
Because of the vital roles played by sea transport
and Naval power in the South-west Pacific, apart
from the two major graving docks dealt with in another
section, the Allied Works Council devoted a continually
increasing volume of its efforts into long-scale mari-
time projects scattered over the vast coastline of the
Commonwealth.
The works included dredging millions of tons of
material from strategic ports; design and construction
of Northern berthing facilities comparable to those of
the Southern capitals; development of large areas
for warehouse accommodation; provision of tanker
wharves capable of handling millions of gallons of
fuel oil; construction of small ship building yards and
slipways; erection of jetties and wharves; and harbour
defences against enemy attack.
The programme involved the co-opting of a large
section of the nation’s dredging plant, and its
co-ordination upon a long-range plan designed to
meet the ever-fluctuating need of the Naval Forces.
The implementation of the programme entailed the
utilisation of the plant and personnel of the harbour
and port authorities not only in the areas affected,
but throughout the whole Commonwealth.
TRANSHIPMENT PORT.
Originally estimated to cost £3,500,000, this project
provided for the construction of 6,000 feet of wharfage,
12 transhipment sheds, 40 warehouses and stores,
17 miles of road, 10 miles of railway track, and for
the use of dredges for deepening of the harbour.
Stone jetty in island fortress area
Commenced in June, 1943, the purpose of the
project was to permit the use of the harbour as a
central base for United States operations in the South
West Pacific Area.
Flying boat base
By October, 1943, the progress of the war was such
that it was possible to commence the development of
harbours much closer to the battle area, so that the
proposed works were reduced by approximately 50
per cent.
Works actually carried out were:—
Area of site: 190 acres.
Section: Wharf 800 ft. long, 50 ft. wide; one
transfer shed, 300 x 100 ft.; seven warehouses, each
400 x 88 ft.; hutted camp for 1,000 men; three
administrative buildings, 200 x 40 ft.
Earthworks; Fill hauled to site, 280,000 cubic
yards; fill moved by dozers and scoops, 400,000 cubic
yards.
Dredging: 212,000 cubic yards (solid measure-
ment) .
Roads; One mile of concrete roadway 20 ft. wide;
4 1 /j miles of gravel roadway, 20 ft. wide.
Drainage: Two miles of canals; 2% miles of open
drains; three-quarters of a mile of concrete pipe
culverts.
Water Supply; Construction of a pumping station,
and IY2 miles of 12 in. diameter main. Port area
reticulation was carried out with l 1 miles of 9 in.
diameter, and one mile of 6 in. diameter pipe lines.
Labour; The maximum number of C.C.C. members
employed was 550, assisted for three months by a
U.S. construction battalion.

The dredging was done by the “GFH,” largest
suction dredge in Australia. All dredged material
was pumped into a ponded area of mangrove swamps,
and will result in the reclamation of a useful area
adjacent to the wharf. The clearing of much of the
mangrove could be carried out only by manual labour,
and was particularly trying on the men.
ANTI-MALARIA DRAINAGE.
The main drainage canal, which intercepts the
run-off from swamps west of the City and carries it
clear of the Transhipment Port area, is so located as
to form part of the Port’s anti-malaria drainage
scheme.
This work, involving the surface water drainage of
a large area, was carried out mainly by Army
personnel. The Allied Works Council, however, was
responsible for arranging supply of materials, and
for the construction of bridges and culverts.
During the last wet season it had sufficiently
advanced to permit of the discharge of surface waters
from the area, and as a result the increase in the
incidence of malaria normally expected after a wet
season did not occur.
This project is now completed, and at least for
the time being the Council is responsible for its
maintenance.
DREDGING PROJECT.
Work upon another major dredging project was
continued during the period under review. Entailing
the removal of 3,000,000 yards of material, at the
date of this Report approximately 2,500,000 barge
yards had been dredged.
The area being dredged is in an exposed section of
water subject to heavy swells and high winds.
The eventual channel is envisaged as 600 x 28 ft.
minimum depth, and will be a permanent asset as an
approach to an excellent natural anchorage of great
extent and depth to 60 ft. over a major portion of the
area.
NAVAL BERTHS.
This is a very large project, comprising the
construction of 10 large Naval berths, with two-way
fuelling services to five of them, connected to storage
tanks holding a total of 25,000 tons of fuel oil.
The berths provide accommodation for large war-
ships and tankers, and as the sites selected were chiefly
at locations where no previous dredging had been
done, it was necessary to dredge approximately
2,000,000 barge yards of material.
Naval torpedo testing station
TORPEDO TESTING RANGE.
One of the highly experimental projects carried out
in Southern Australia during this period was connected
with the production of torpedoes in Australia. No
comparable facilities existed previously to provide in
this country a torpedo testing range for the purpose
of testing torpedoes locally constructed.
The works, which had to be carried out over a
stretch of 5,000 yards of deep, sheltered, current-free
water, included the building of an observation tower;
a series of floating structures to serve as targets;
extensive workshops; a slipway, and a 700-ft. approach
jetty.
Problems faced in construction included accurate
alignment of the various sections of the projects, and
design of a firing head structure to carry heavy
reaction forces over deep water.
SLIPWAYS, JETTIES AND HARBOUR
DEFENCES.
In addition to the works mentioned above, the
Council has constructed several slipways and jetties
for large vessels, and also completed construction of
numerous anti-submarine defences.
These projects have been carried out in all parts of
the Commonwealth, involving transport of men and
materials for this purpose to a number of ports on
the Australian coast.

ROYAL NAVY
A £5,500,000 programme, to be completed in sections
over periods ranging from one to six months, was
undertaken in December, 1944, on behalf of the
Royal Navy.
The programme, which includes a General Service
Depot project that covers an area of 200 acres and
has a capacity equivalent to two townships the size
of Penrith, New South Wales, was approaching
50 per cent, completion by February 15, 1945.
Because modern Naval warfare requires a battle
fleet to be supported by land based installations, the
programme included not only the housing of ratings
Bitumen surfacing of runway taken over
by the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm
and personnel, but provision for Fleet Air Arms,
extensive warehouse storage, subdivision of office
buildings and other structures, supply of furniture,
extensive waterfront works, and general works
ancillary to the major projects.
Individual projects exceed 200 in New South
Wales and over 50 in Queensland. Two will cost
approximately £1,000,000 each, two will exceed
£500,000 each, and several £lOO,OOO or more.
So as to enable the programme to be completed
by the target dates, nearly 5,000 workmen were
diverted to the Royal Navy projects. Interstate
transfers of men were arranged to meet portion of
this requirement and an organisation set up to
ensure the smooth flow of plant, materials, and
operations generally.
As a result of this organisation, the dates set for
the completion of building operations have been
met, and Naval personnel in several instances were
able to move into premises actually in advance of
completion dates.
Works undertaken include: —
Accommodation for Administration and Naval
personnel, General Service Depot for 8,200 officers
and ranks, including sleeping quarters, messes,
churches, gymnasium, detention barracks, sick bay,
N.A.A.F.I. Institutes and administration building.
Partial occupancy of this project was taken within
8 weeks of commencement.


Pending the completion of the General Service
Depot, temporary accommodation for 4,000 officers
and ranks was provided on a nearby racecourse.
This work included erection of tents with wooden
floors, electricity installations in every tent, requiring
3% miles of wiring, and provision of 9,000 pieces
of furniture, as well as messes, ablutions, canteens,
and other services.
The temporary accommodation project was carried
out within three working weeks, and was in time for
the arrival of the first contingent of Royal Navy
men in Australia.
Another project provides housing accommodation
for approximately 2,500 dock workers.
Accommodation for staffs and sections of the Royal
Navy necessitated 90 subdivisions being made in city
and suburban buildings, 24,000 items of furniture
being supplied for this purpose.
Three floors of office accommodation for the
Commander-in-Chief and staff were subdivided, fully
partitioned, and completely fitted and furnished in
9 working days.
Warehouse accommodation: Storage areas required
approximated 2,800,000 square feet, this amount
being supplied at the rate of one store per week,
each store being over one acre in extent.
Fleet Air Arms: Major aerodromes are now in
occupation by the Fleet Air Arm, runways being
sealed and handed over to the Navy authorities in
nine working days. The erection of 27 new hangars
has been undertaken in connection with aerodromes
projects, in addition to workshops for the assembly
and testing of aircraft.
Eastern Australian cruiser berth
undergoing extensions for Royal Navy
Fleet Repair Bases and Workshops: Work on the
waterfront comprises realignment of existing structures
for heavy crane, bays, subdivision of upper floors
with all facilities for resident naval ratings and
operatives, installation of extensive mechanical and
electrical plant and equipment, and extension of oil
reticulation. It comprises a considerable area of
the existing wharfage accommodation on the harbour
fronts.
In addition, special facilities were supplied at short
notice for extensive water reticulation to harbour
projects.
Simultaneously with these works new wharves are
being built and others extended, and a mass of minor
works which are proceeding include erection and
fitting of leave hostels, and alterations to existing
hospitals and other facilities vacated by the U.S.
Forces.

New South Wales shipyard
Fabrication of 100-tonner
SMALL SHIPS CONSTRUCTION
Created for the purpose of solving the problem of
congestion in Australian ports, particularly in the
North, the Small Ships Section of the Allied Works
Council up to February 15, 1945, had carried out a
programme of barge and lighter construction, and
small ship refitting and conversion, at an approximate
cost of £1,250,000.
At the time of the establishment of the Section,
existing facilities in Northern Australia were inade-
quate to handle the huge quantities of war material
daily arriving from southern depots and from overseas.
Extensive use of lighters was found to be the only
solution of this problem. These craft bad the
advantage of being able to serve in place of wharves
wrecked by raids, and of being easily dispersed in
the event of enemy attack.
Yards were established for the carrying out of the
programme at widely dispersed centres along the
eastern and southern seaboard of Australia, including
New South Wales and Queensland ports, as well as
Melbourne and Hobart.
Works carried out fall into six main classifications:

Sydney punts have been repaired and outfitted, and
are now in service.
(b) , New construction in timber of the Tobruk
type of portable barge.
Modelled upon lighters used by the Italians during
the siege of Tobruk, and which had proved adequate
for the transport of heavy materials, such as tanks,
a total of 78 Tobruk lighters, developed and adapted

Below - Newly slipped lighters at Queensland yards
to Australian conditions, were constructed, 53 at a
contractor’s yards at a Northern Rivers port in New
South Wales, and 25 by the Department of Public
Works, Hobart. Cost of this section of the programme
was £93,164.
(c) New construction of composite timber and
steel lighters of the Armco type.
This programme, carried out at a Northern Queens-
land port, consisted of 46 lighters of the 40-ton type,
and 12 of the 80-ton type. Completed cost of the
job was £88,410.
(d) New construction of all steel lighters.
Apart from general use, these lighters were fitted
out for various purposes, including refrigeration, fuel
carrying, and aircraft salvage.
After a preliminary order for the construction of
five 300 Philippine lighters had been fulfilled, they
proved so satisfactory that the quantity was sub-
stantially increased. Altogether 13 of the 300 ton
type and 18 of the 100 ton type were delivered from
Southern New South Wales yards. A further nineteen
100-tonners have been built to date at the Melbourne
yards.
The Refrigeration Lighter, which is a conversion of
the 300-ton Philippine lighter, is for use in Northern
waters for the refrigeration of foodstuffs.. Constructed
in New South Wales, the lighters are outfitted at an
estimated cost of £23,000 each.
The Fuel Carrying Lighters are also constructed
in New South Wales and are outfitted at an estimated
cost of £lB,OOO each.
The construction of Aircraft Salvage Barges, which
include the erection of a 3-ton crane, was carried out
at Melbourne. The six ordered have been delivered
to the Department of Air, at a completed cost of
£17,000 each.
Construction also included one prototype powered
end at the Melbourne yards.
An order for 10 Sectional 80-ton steel lighters has
also been completed in Melbourne, at a total completed
cost of £24,332.
(e) Repair and refitting of powered craft.
Dealing with the refitting and conversion of powered
ships for Service purposes, work done under this
division has included practically every class of small
ship, such as diesel or steam tugs, launches, motor
vessels, ferry boats, and dumb hopper barges.
(f) Maintenance of Central Cargo Control Com-
mittee lighters.
Maintenance work under this heading is carried out
in New South Wales and Queensland.

Oil storage depot in Northern Australia
OIL INSTALLATIONS
Apart from the provision of oil and petrol storage
tanks throughout Australia, with a capacity running
into many millions of gallons, the Allied Works Coun-
cil during the period provided a large number of
500,000-gallon prefabricated tanks for use in New
Guinea and in other advanced operational areas.
The programme, which covered works in most
States, may be divided into six main groups.
The first two, which are as follow's, may be regarded
as similar inasmuch as the storage tanks, etc., are
generally of the same type, and are often sited in the
same locality:—
(a) Bulk seaboard storage for aviation spirit and
petrol.
(b) Naval fuel oil storage.
Much of the work on these storages was required
in areas subject to cyclonic conditions, and open to
enemy raids and reconnaissance, which necessitated
the tanks being widely dispersed and located on sites
that afforded concealment from the sea. Camouflage
treatment, of the tanks while under construction was
also a necessary precaution.
The facilities to be provided under the scheme
ranged from temporary bolted steel tanks of 70,000
gallons capacity to steel and concrete tanks with a
capacity of 1,250,000 gallons each. Pipe lines con-
necting the tanks to either wharves or existing tanks
varied from 4 to 12 inches in diameter, depending
upon the type of fuel being pumped.
The steel tanks possessed a capacity of 500,000
gallons and were prefabricated at Newcastle.
The method of erecting these tanks was to first bolt
them up and then weld the joints, the bolts either
being welded in or removed and the holes filled with
weld metal.
In order to conserve supplies of steel, concrete
tanks were built on several sites, for the storage of
furnace oil.
Tanks for the storage of aviation gasoline and
motor spirit w'ere calibrated by officers of the Customs
Department, whilst those of the R.A.N., wdiich stores
furnace, diesel and distillate oils were cared for by
A.W.C. officers.
In all cases the tanks are filled by the pumps on
the tankers. At one centre back loading and bunker-
ing is by gravitation; at the others, where the elevation
of the tanks is insufficient, electrical or petrol engine
driven pumps are installed.
Many difficulties w r ere overcome during the con-
struction of some of the pipe lines and storage tanks.
All of the installations are now' in service.
A typical project embracing both types of storage
involved erection of four welded steel tanks, splinter-
proofed, and the laying of 4,200 ft. of 11-inch steel
main. 5,700 ft. of 8-inch, and 1.000 ft. of 6-inch,
together wdth the installation of pumping plants.

2. Earth protection for tank
3. Entrance to underground Naval
tanks

5. Northern Oil Depot filling and

6. Camouflaging oil depot site

New steel plate for the manufacture of the 11-inch
pipe was unavailable, but old plate from water pipe
line elsewhere was examined, selected and rerolled;
special 8-inch bore casing was found on a Northern
Australian oil boring project, and was brought 800
miles overland; the 6-inch pipe was not available,
and a temporary 4-inch line was installed. The main
pump came from Castlemaine, Victoria, and the engine
to drive it from the goldfields of Western Australia.
During the welding of the tanks the desert sand
continually swept across the work, affecting the
molten weld material. Intense heat inside the steel
necessitated much of the work being done at night.
(c) Safe Naval fuel oil storage.
Underground oil storage was provided in the Darwin
area during the period.
Tunnels were designed horseshoe in shape and lined
with rolled steel plate.
Approximately 15,000 cubic yards of concrete were
required to line the tunnels, approaches, and pumping
stations, and considerable research was carried out
before it was finally decided to use crushed quartzite
for all aggregates in preference to the local stone. All
aggregate used had to be brought 18 miles by road.
Excavation was done by very modern equipment
which was brought to Darwin from various parts of
the Commonwealth specially for the purpose.
Owing to the nature of the cross-section and the
class of work, it was necessary to use a total of 400
tons of heavy reinforcement in the concrete.
(d) Aviation fuel storage at rail sidings and
aerodromes.
Under this section of the programme, small tanks
were installed at a variety of sites, particularly in the
Northern Territory. Many of the tanks were taken
from existing installations in the Southern States.
(e) The assembly of prefabricated tanks and
fittings for use in operational areas by Army.
(f) The acquisition and supply of tanks and
fittings for Department of Army for use in
New Guinea and elsewhere.
Because the two schemes mentioned above are so
inter-related, they are surveyed in this Report as one
project. The first, known as “Bulk Oil Storage in
Forward Areas,” was initiated in June, 1943, in associa-
tion with a pool of tanks and ancillary equipment,
such as erection tools, plant and scaffolding, and
Pre-fabricaled huts.
Under this scheme, the standard type of 500,000
gallon steel tank described earlier and developed by
the designing section of the Allied Works Council for
1186 in many of the Mainland installations, was the
type of storage used.
M.T. Bulk Oil Store elevated tanks
The second scheme of acquisition of stores has been
in operation for only a few months, and involves the
supply of a smaller type of prefabricated steel tank
of 80,000 gallon capacity, together with reticulation
stores. The design of the unit is very similar to the
500,000 gallon type, and was also prepared by the
Allied Works Council designing staff.
Production of raw material by the contractors, and
fabrication of the tanks and fittings, were co-ordinated
so that deliveries of tanks at the rate of two per week
commenced five weeks after the issue of the order.
In concluding the above brief survey of the oil
storage programme, it should be mentioned that losses
during transport to site, occasioned by enemy action
and from other causes, had to be immediately supplied.
These replacements had to be effected from the Pool
with all due speed.
All Pool tanks are therefore designed so that
replacement parts are interchangeable, and are
supplied with all fittings necessary for efficient func-
tioning. The addition of special fittings, such as foam
connections, pressure vacuum vents, and swing arms,
ensures the suitability of the tanks for all liquids,
including aviation spirit.
In addition to the multiplicity of pipe lines which
are laid handling facilities for filling drums of
various types, rail tanks, cars and road vehicles, have
been installed at the bulk installations and sub-depots.
Apart from the major types of projects outlined
above, bulk handling facilities have been established
at several inland centres for the receipt and distribu-
tion of aviation and M.T. spirit. At one such installa-
tion 20 miles of pipeline were laid to deliver aviation
spirit from railhead to aerodrome.


FIXED
DEFENCES
A statically defended locality, or fortress area, such
as those designed to guard our large coastal cities
and towns, necessitates the installation of a complex
array of counter bombardment weapons of heavy
calibre and long range, down through a variety of
lighter equipment of close defence guns and quick
firing anti-motor torpedo boat units, as well as anti-
aircraft guns and searchlights.
Generally speaking it is popular to define, as well
as think of, fixed defences as one or more gun emplace-
ments erected along a coast line. While the guns are
the focal points of the defended area, it must be
remembered that the efficient operation of any battery
depends largely on the support given it from the
rear. Therefore, in visualizing works of this nature,
the existence of what might be called secondary con-
struction must be kept well in mind, particularly as
such is often of considerable magnitude.
The building of fixed defences may he divided into
two definite phases. Firstly, the construction of the
cm placements and such other buildings as magazines
and power houses necessary to fire the guns, and
secondly the construction of such ancillary buildings
and other works necessary to keep the weapon firing.
The second phase covers the erection of such build-
ings as reserve magazines, plotting rooms, observation
posts, searchlight stations, radio range finding stations
and workshops, accommodation for the garrison, etc.
Communication roads in the area are another essential.
As the emplacements are generally of a permanent
nature, it is both economic and desirable to provide
reasonably permanent support facilities. This is
justified on the grounds that every weapon in a fortress
area is co-ordinated with, and dependent to a large
extent on, the other guns in the locality. The actual
gun may be replaced by a more modern type but the
basic developmental works are still of great value.
The period ranging from July 1, 1943, to February
15. 1945. has been devoted to developmental work
necessary on existing installations as well as the
construction of a number of new emplacements.

2. View from lower gunpit
3. Searchlight auxiliary

While it is outside the scope of this publication to
give calibre, type and number of fixed defences on
this coast line constructed by the Allied Works Council
or by local authorities under Allied Works Council
supervision, some idea of the problems encountered
are enumerated below, and should serve to give a
clearer understanding of the construction involved.
The emplacements themselves, as well as plotting
rooms, magazines, observation posts, etc., often
necessitated construction in places difficult of access
and on poor foundations. Long hauls of materials
and the absence of suitable water for concrete, are
problems to be overcome. Reasonable protection
against attack from the air involved the factors of
provision of overhead cover. On the more important
weapons, protection against a direct hit has been
provided in a number of different ways depending on
the site, but it usually takes the form of a reinforced
concrete burster slab many feel thick supported by a
sand cushion, which in turn is carried by a heavily
reinforced structural member.
As an indication of the process by which a battery
comes into being, the following brief survey of events
gives some idea of the methods and quantities involved.
Primarily the site for the emplacements and other
structures is fixed by the Department of Army in
conjunction with an officer of the Council. The site
having been settled, surveys are made and preliminary
designs are prepared and submitted for Army’s
approval.
In the meantime quantities and estimates are taken
out so that the task of organising labour and plant
may be put in hand. Before work can commence,
however, camps have to be built and access roads to
the site constructed. By this time final plans are
sufficiently complete to allow excavation and pre-
liminary concreting of emplacements to proceed, pro-
vided that water and suitable aggregate are available.
Should such essential materials not be on hand, it is
often necessary to go to the extent of sinking bores,
sometimes to great depth, to obtain water, and establish
great piles of stone from outside sources.
When the major battery structures are well under
way a start is made on the less important buildings.
In some instances the urgency of having the weapons
installed has been such that the gun has been mounted
and manned before the emplacement was complete.
As an example of the quantities and construction
involved in a typical fortress works of counter
bombardment type, the following figures are quoted:—
(a) Excavationl2,soo cu. yds. of sand and
soil.
(b) Concrete 3,000 cu. yds. or approx. 5,000
tons.
(c) Reinforcing Steel 144 tons.
(d) Fabricated Steel —4O tons (Steel Plate and
Structural Sections).
(e) Timber 70,000 super ft. or approx. 200
tons (used for concrete formwork and
buildings).
(f I Miles of Roads 6)4 miles.
(g) Transport of Materials (Marine) —BB,OOO
ton miles.
(h) Manpower Maximum 110 men.
(i) Plant One tug and 3/60 ton lighters
together with several smaller vessels and the
usual assortment of construction equipment
such as motor lorries, concrete mixers,
cranes, etc.
( j) Jetties —3 in number with a total length of
625 ft. approx.
ik i Railways— I 1 -j miles plus sidings.
The figures quoted above are an indication only, and
neither represent the maximum, the minimum or the
mean for batteries even of a similar type.
It is the exception rather than the rule that batteries
of the same calibre bear any resemblance to one
another with regard to quantities of materials or
labour involved. In steep hilly country the difficulties
of mounting may well be appreciated, when it is
considered that the heavier type of equipment weigh-
in the order of 150 tons, the heaviest single lift of
which is 30 tons.

MUNITIONS
Work upon the munition factory construction
programme was continued during the period under
review.
Buildings erected at practically every one of the
existing factories during this period do not form part
of the actual production area, but comprise change
and mess rooms for personnel, administrative blocks,
laboratories, casualty rooms, guard houses, pay boxes,
identification races, and work shops.
Specialised designs were required in many of the
buildings involved, with connecting gritless asphalt
cleanways.
Engineering services completed during the period at
a majority of the projects included roads, cleanways,
fencing, and electrical and steam installations.
Apart from alterations and extensions to permit of
an increase in production of munitions, certain of
the ordnance factories have been converted to the
manufacture of metal containers, etc., for the supply
of emergency food rations to the Services in
operational areas.
MULWALA EXPLOSIVES FACTORY, N.S.W.
Work on this factory is nearing completion, most
of the work yet to be done being in connection with
the installation of the production plant.
The factory comprises 212 separate buildings con-
structed in brick, and reinforced concrete, timber-
roofed, and sheeted with galvanised iron, asbestos-
cement sheets, or terra-cotta tiles, according to the
use for which the particular structure is intended.
Mulwala is a striking example of a “preplanned”
factory, the disposition of the buildings allowing the
whole area to be broken up with dummy roads so as
to provide an effective camouflage screen for the
area.
A deciding factor in the selection of the site was
its proximity to the Yarrawonga Weir, 3,000,000
gallons of water daily being required for the factory
when in operation. To ensure a quality such as was
required for the process, one of the largest water
filtration plants yet installed in Australia was erected,
together with a modern treatment works for the
treatment of polluted water before it is discharged.
At the peak of production, 3,000 Corps members
were employed on this job, the total man-weeks being
estimated at 85,000.
SMALL ARMS AMMUNITION FACTORY,
FOOTSCRAY.
Spacious stores, to hold heavy raw material, were
erected during the period at cost of £150,000, a further
21,000 square feet being added to the existing Rolling
Mill.
One complete section of the factory was rebuilt,
and extended, at a cost of £90,000.
From a humble beginning some years ago, when
20 buildings were erected, there now stand 300
buildings, complete with modern machinery, steam
and power, and linked together with cleanways and
concrete roadways.

2. Wood pulp conveyor to nitrating house
3. Laying acid drain at N.S.W. factory
4. Installing boilers prior to building boiler house
5. Welding inside boiler house stack
6. Acid tanks in T.N.T. factory
7. Constant head tank cooling system


ORDNANCE FACTORY, BENDIGO.
Covering an area of 85 acres, about £700,000 has
been spent on the construction of the Bendigo
Ordnance Factory, in conformity with the policy of
decentralisation carried out in connection with the
Munitions Programme.
Comprising 30 buildings, this project has now a
total floor area of 531,000 square feet.
EXPLOSIVES DEPOT, LONGLEA.
Carefully laid out to take full advantage of natural
conditions, the Longlea Explosives Depot, is hidden
over a vast area in a State Forest.
Over 100 buildings, linked by many miles of road
and guarded by manproof fence, comprise the Depot.
Water mains and reservoirs for fire fighting have
been spread through the area, the project including
railways, platforms, administration offices, magazine
and test houses.
Carried out in 39 weeks by Day Labour at a total
cost of £200,000, this project was urgent from the
beginning, the magazines being filled as they were
completed.
MAINTENANCE.
While works carried out since July, 1943, on the
munitions factories have been on a much smaller
scale than in the preceding period, the Allied Works
Council commenced a maintenance programme of the
36 factories concerned at an estimated annual cost of
£350,000.
Work includes maintenance and repair of roads,
paths, cleanways, drainage, water supply, sewerage,
railways and tramways, and buildings both general
and structural.
Electrical and mechanical plant and services are
being maintained by the Ministry of Munitions.


ROADS
Main item on the Allied Works Council’s Roads
Programme over the period covered by this Report
was the maintenance of 5,000 miles of road, built
to the requirements of the Military authorities and
representing a Commonwealth asset valued at well
over £8,000,000.
Of the Military roads only the Forrest Highway,
which is included here so as to complete the construc-
tional records, was practically finished before the
advent of the Council, although a start had been
made on most of them by 1940 or 1941.
Over those years the work was directly in the hands
of the local State road-building organisations,
although practically every one of these bodies
co-operated in the early stages of the North-South
Road.
After the formation of the Council on February 26,
1942, the efforts of the State Instrumentalities were
completely co-ordinated and their resources augmented
by supplies of labour and equipment, so that the
Roads Programme proceeded at a pace which broke
all records for road-building in Australia.
Supplementing its Roads Programme, in the
Northern Territory the Council undertook the
maintenance of well over 5,000 miles of stock
routes, much of which was used for Military transport
as well as for the movement of stock.
Brief details of the main roads built in Australia
during the war years are as follows: —
NORTH-SOUTH ROAD (STUART HIGHWAY).
Length: 954 miles.
Route: Alice Springs railhead to Port Darwin, via
Tennant Creek and Larrimah.
Formation: Gravelled 40-ft. wide, with a 16-ft.
bitumen pavement.
History: The remaining 200 miles below Tennant
Creek were bitumen surfaced by the Country Roads
Board after June 30, 1943, and 412 miles given a light


maintenance reseal. As well as carrying out much
strengthening and drainage, the New South Wales
Department of Main Roads completed bitumening
above Larrimah.
Maximum number employed: 1,800.
Cost: £2,840,000.
MOUNT ISA-TENNANT CREEK ROAD.
Length: 403 miles.
Route: Mount Isa railhead to the North-South Road
at Tennant Creek.

1943, and during the period covered by this report
only maintenance work was carried out.
Maximum number employed: 400.
Cost: Approximately £285,000.
ATHERTON TABLELANDS ROADS.
Length: Approximately 200 miles.
Routes: Cairns-Kuranda-Mareeba-Atherton; and a
network of roads upon the Atherton Tablelands.
Formation: Mainly re-forming, strengthening, and
bitumening existing roads.
History: Commenced in 1943 and still proceeding,
by this work a network of rural roads, constructed for
peactime conditions, was strengthened and maintained
to handle exceptionally heavy Military traffic loads.

NORTHERN TERRITORY STOCK ROUTES.
Length: Over 5,000 miles.
Routes: Approximately 20 routes.
History: For many years the responsibility of the
Northern Territory Civil Administration, this work
was undertaken by the Council in 1942, and became
of paramount important during the great cattle treks
of 1943. It entails maintenance and sinking of bores,
servicing of windmills, and fire-ploughing of access
roads.
Maximum number employed: 20.
Cost: Approximately £B,OOO annually.

AERODROMES
Aerodrome construction carried out during the
period by the Allied Works Council included the
provision of another 100 runways, principally for the
Armed Services, the erection of a Continent-wide chain
of Service Aircraft Repair Depots, and improvements
to practically every Civil Aerodrome on the main
aerial trunk lines that bisect Australia.
The new runways, which are scattered throughout
Australia, bring the total number constructed by the
Council since its commencement to the vicinity of 400.
Bulk of the work carried out was for the Armed
Services, but a considerable increase in the amount
hitherto carried out for the Department of Civil
Aviation was a feature of the period’s activities.
An undertaking of vital importance to the future
of aerial transport in Australia was the development
of the airfields on the 1,400 mile mail trunk civil
airline from Brisbane to Torres Strait.
The airports concerned in this work were Archer-
field, Rockhampton, Mackay, Townsville, Cairns,
Cooktown and Horn Island. Work on these projects
was dovetailed with work at other aerodromes under
the control of the U.S. Army Air Corps and the
R.A.A.F. in the proximity of this route.
AIR REPAIR DEPOT, N.T.
One of the major projects undertaken during the
period was the construction at an estimated cost of
£600,000 of an Air Repair Depot for the U.S. Forces
in Northern Australia. Built in close proximity to
an aerodrome in the North, the purpose of this Depot
is to facilitate the repair and overhauling of service
aircraft.
As neither men nor materials were available in the
area, arrangements were made whereby the Allied
Works Council was to supply 1,250 men on the project,
while a further 750 were to be supplied by the
U.S. Armed Forces.
Portion of the plant and materials required was the
responsibility of the Mechanical Equipment section
of the Council, and the balance was to be supplied by
the U.S. authorities.
The work included:—
1. Clearing of timbered areas for roads, camp
sites, storage areas, approximating 160 acres.
2. Erection of six tubular cyclone warehouses,
150 x 100 ft.; igloo hangar 205 x 309 ft.;
Transhipping equipment for island aerodrome
off North Australian coast-Photo. M.R.C.
truck unloading platform; 5 Q.M’s. Stores;
8 Cool rooms; 2 signal depot repair shops;
mess huts; dispensary, post office; guard
house; orderly rooms; 500-bed hospital.
3. Electrical reticulation and installation, includ-
ing erection of 300 poles for high and low
tension lines, and 270 feet of cable for over-
head mains. Internal wiring absorbed
300,000 feet of cable.
4. Laying of 8 in. concrete floors in hangars,
6 in. concrete floors in warehouses, and 4 in.
concrete floors in minor buildings.
5. Construction of 320,000 square yards of
bitumen surfaced gravel roads and paved
areas.


In conformity with the 120 day estimate for the
completion of the project, work was commenced on
March 13, 1944, and completed on July 14, the target
date. The only work outstanding was a small amount
of bitumen sealing, and this did not prevent the Depot
from coming into full operation.
AIR REPAIR DEPOT, ARCHERFIELD.
Established adjacent to the Archerfield Aerodrome,
the Archerfield Air Frame Repair Unit was undertaken
for the provision of shelter for aircraft of the largest
size, and to give facilities for the overhaul of these
aircraft, and assembly of new craft from overseas.
The original project required the erection of two
hangars of igloo type construction, 353 x 170 ft.;
a large store, 255 x 170 ft.; together with various
ancillary buildings, such as stores, administrative
buildings, guard houses, and lavatory blocks. Later
the project was increased by the addition of two more
hangars, 353 x 188 ft., with greater height than the
first two.
1. Dispersal bay on Northern aerodrome
2. Three-mile diversion drain on Queensland airfield
Timber was used for the fabric, and the individual
arches of trusses were constructed on the ground in
two 90-ft. sections, being lifted into their final position
by specially devised methods.
Work also included preparation of the sites; forma-
tion of a 2,000 ft. taxiway linking the depot with the
aerodrome; and the provision of water, sewerage and
electricity services.
As with most aircraft depots, drainage was a major
problem, considerable work being required to provide
the necessary getaway for heavy rainfalls which are a
feature of the area.
The following particulars will give an indication
of the size of this project:—

Work was commenced on March, 1943, and in
August of the same year the project had advanced
sufficiently to allow work to be commenced upon the
first aircraft, and was completed by November, 1944.

NORTH BOURKE, N.S.W.
Two runways with an aggregate length of 14,000 ft.
by 100 ft. in width were constructed on the existing
Civil Aerodrome to provide landing facilities on the
Inland Ferry Route for the U.S. Army Services of
Supply.
Owing to the absence of suitable local gravel for
pavement purposes, construction was undertaken in
soil-cement. Local soils were pulverised on the run-
way, dry and wet mixed with from 10 to 12 per cent,
of cement, graded and rolled to profile, and then
cured under sisalkraft. Total thickness of stabilised
pavement is 6 inches.
Expenditure was approximately £150,000.
FORREST AERODROME, W.A.
Works on this aerodrome for the Department of
Civil Aviation have involved an expenditure of
approximately £90,000 to date all within the period
under review.
The work has consisted of the provision of two
runways, 5,000 ft. and 4,500 ft. in length, and each
150 ft. wide, with a large pipe drainage scheme, and
extensive perimeter open drains.
A tarmac and taxiway have also been provided,
and modern runway lighting, air navigation aids, and
other facilities have been incorporated in the project.
In the entire absence of a suitable gravel, the whole
construction has been carried out in crushed limestone
rock. This has involved the transport and erection
of suitable quarrying and crushing plant, as well as
the provision of the usual runway construction plant.
To obtain suitable consolidation the crushed material
has been windrowed, graded, and waterbound in
layers.
Construction of the two runways is almost com-
pleted, including a tar priming, and a thin bituminous
seal coat. The project was completed in December,
1944.
Quantity of rock handled and crushed was approxi-
mately 32,000 cubic yards. Pipe drainage totals
22,000 lineal feet, and open drains 13,000 lineal feet.
BROKEN HILL AERODROME.
Owing to the extreme climatic conditions and very
low annual rainfall, wind erosion is very severe in
the Barrier area, and grass growth cannot be
maintained.
Under these conditions, it was decided to provide
for the immediate needs of the Department of Civil
Aviation by the construction of two hard surfaced
sealed runways, forming part of a master plant for
four runways. These runways are 100 feet wide at
present, with provision for increasing to 150 feet when
traffic warrants.
As a result of low priority and difficulties of trans-
port to the area, the work had to he undertaken with
the limited plant and materials available locally.


Natural limestone gravels were used, and extreme
care was necessary in spreading and consolidation,
lest wind-blown sand should destroy the binding
power. Over 800,000 gallons of water were required
in the consolidation of the pavement.
Total paved area is approximately 88,000 square
yards, which, with associate works has been completed
at a cost of £20,000.
MOUNT GAMBIER.
Three sealed runways with connecting taxiways are
under construction at the Mount Gambier Aerodrome,
which has been doubled in area since being taken over
by R.A.A.F. from Civil Aviation.
Established as a R.A.A.F. standard station, accom-
modation has been provided for 1,200 persons, and a
temporary landing ground established for use during
the change-over from grass-surfaced runways to
bitumen.
A water supply system has been developed from an
adjacent deep bore, and a complete sewerage system
installed. The electric supply was brought eight miles
from the town by special high-tension line.

AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION
Rapid expansion of aerial warfare in the South
West Pacific Area resulted in a demand for the
establishment of adequate repair and maintenance
facilities for both frames and engines of aircraft.
All existing establishments and facilities were
expanded to meet the situation, and a considerable
building programme, which included all States, was
put in hand by the Allied Works Council for the
Maintenance Division of the Department of Aircraft
Production.
The largest establishments have in most instances
been erected in close proximity to existing aerodromes,
attention being given to aspects of planning so as to
meet both present and future development of Civil
Aviation in Australia.
Many new engine and machine shops have been
erected to cope with the unprecedented volume of the
highly specialised work necessary for servicing and
maintaining aircraft engines and instruments.
In some cases it was found possible to take over
and convert the activities of some of the large modern
munition factories erected in the earlier part of
the war.
ROCKLEA DEPOT.
Greatest of the Aircraft Production units constructed
during the period, the Rocklea Aircraft Engine Over-
haul Depot is established on an area of 65 acres.
The project, which has been established in certain
buildings formerly consisting of a section of the
Rocklea Ammunition Factory was for the purpose of
carrying out the following work:—
1. Reconditioning of aircraft engines.
2. Reconditioning of engine accessories.
3. Salvage and repair of engine components.
Building work included engine overhaul shops,
accessory overhaul shops, lavatory blocks, a hostel,
laboratory, stores, oil store, laundry, casualty room,


maintenance shops and store, machine shop, instru-
ment repair shops, and administrative offices.

So as to reduce the noise level of continuous testing
operations to a point where it ceased to be a deterrent
to the efficiency of the operatives and a nuisance to
residents within a radius of several miles, it was
decided that the testing of reconditioned engines at
Rocklea should be carried out within suitably
constructed enclosures.
Because of the excessive cost of sound absorbing
material, and the limited supplies likely to be available
within the time required, it was decided to erect “U”
type engine test cells, and to depend on solid masonry

noise, rather than on the Use of special materials.
The design was finally stabilised with regard to
arrangement, size and shape testing cells as actually
erected are 16 x 16 ft. in cross section, 78 ft. long
on ground plan, with air intakes and exhausts 16 ft.
square at a height of 39 ft. above ground level. The
cells are arranged in pairs, with the control cabin
mounted between each pair. Minimum external
thicknesses of masonry are 14 inches brickwork and
10 inches concrete.
There are approximately 2 1 /2 miles of storm water
and sewerage piping and IV> miles of water mains.
Messing and canteen accommodation has been
provided for well over 1,000 operatives.

TIMBER
Timber supplies totalling approximately 158,000,000
super feet were required during the period for the
Allied Works Council projects described elsewhere in
this report.
The quantities required in each State were:
Queensland 63,103,000 super feet
New South Wales 61,849,000 super feet
Victoria 24,182,000 super feet
Western Australia ... 4,006,000 super feet
Northern Territory 3,608,000 super feet
South Australia 2,546,000 super feet
Early in the period projects calling for the largest
quantities of timber were the wffiarf construction in
a North Queensland port and the prefabrication in
Sydney of huts, hospitals and warehouses for forward
areas.
Wharf timbers totalled 3,200,000 super feet, and
«erc partly met from Queensland saw-mills, but,
to attain the desired rate of production, orders were
arranged in New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania.
Other projects in North Queensland called for
the supply in a short period of 12,000,000 super feet
of scantling and flooring.
Queensland sawmills were drawn upon heavily for
scantlings, but flooring supplies and several million
super feet of scantlings were arranged out of Tasmania
and Victoria, and comprised a large proportion of the
11,000,000 super feet shipped northwards between
April and September, 1943.
Apart from the Main Roads Commission timber
camp at Mount Spec, where the logs were felled for
sawing at Townsville, mills were established at Jacky
Drawing newly felled logs to loading site
Jacky and Iron Range in Far North Queensland, and
tw'o others in the South West of that State.
Because from the outset of war conditions, construc-
tional work in the Northern Territory suffered from
lack of materials, due to difficulties of transport, it
was decided to investigate all possibilities of procuring
material locally.
Investigation in the area revealed that there were
excellent prospects of obtaining Leichhardt pine,
stringy bark, woolly-butt, paper bark, and other
timbers. The first Allied Works Council sawmill was
started at McMinns early in 1943, cutting poles,
piles, and sleepers, mostly for use on the Darwin
water front.
Good stands have been discovered at Mainary
Station and upon various spots on the Tablelands,
while air survey has disclosed possibilities on the
Alligator River, so that the development of timber
production should be of postwar value.
Timber stack at Northern Territory mill


As a result of experiment it has been discovered
that timbers such as paper bark, hitherto held
unsuitable for milling, is quite suitable for the
Northern area. Over 20 samples of unidentified
timber have been obtained, and sent to the C.S.I.R.
for investigation.
N.T. TIMBER PRODUCTION.
Timber production in the Northern Territory is
carried out in two main areas, Darwin and Mataranka
Katherine. The administrative centre in the Darwin
area is McMinns, controlling three mills for sawn
timber.
All three mills are of the Spot Mill type, consisting
of single benches driven by tractors as power units.
These are now being converted to steam drive.
Round timber production consists of 12-inch crown
piles for jetty and wharf construction (mainly paper
bark from swamps and jungles) ; light and power
poles for aerodromes (stringy bark ) ; sawn lagging
for lagging tunnels; sleepers of stringy bark; insert
and building poles.
In the Mataranka Katherine area there are two
mills Stirling Mill and Maranboy Panorama.
Both mills commenced operations in April, 1944.
Production is being organised to provide most of
the timber required in the Northern area for all
Defence projects, and so avoid transport difficulties,
as well as relieving demands on other forest areas.
A development of interest since the establishment
of the Allied Works Council has been the extensive
use of green timber in structural work. Many of the
projects could not have been completed to schedule
if experiments had not shown that it was possible to
use this type of timber.

U.S. PREFABRICATION
A significant feature of the Prefabrication Pro-
gramme undertaken by the Allied Works Council on
behalf of the U.S. Services of Supply is the fact that
although funds approved for this programme amounted
to £6,144,514, the estimated actual cost was only
£5,011,331, showing a surplus of £1,133,183.
The Programme, which was carried out in New
South Wales, included the supply of hut, hospital,
and warehouse units, as well as Air Force control
towers and cool stores, bundled and assembled so
as to permit of their shipment to any section of the
South West Pacific Area.
During the 16 months between May, 1943, and
the end of August, 1944, the Council supplied to the
U.S. Army from special depots established for that
purpose prefabricated material amounting to
18,274,000 square feet of hutments; hospitals capable
of providing beds for 28,250 inmates, with another
series totalling 9,000 beds which were completed by
October 31, 1944; warehousing units to a total
area of 8,000,000 square feet; 250 Air Force control
towers; and 140 cool stores with a total space of
60,200 cubic feet.
Although aiming at the prefabrication of types of
structures with a comparatively short life, suitable
for use in close proximity to battle areas, in certain
of its aspects, particularly in the development of line
production to a length of 4,600 feet and the application
of a revolutionary technique in the bundling of
material for despatch, the Prefabrication Programme
is fraught with the utmost significance to the future
of the Australian building industry.
The Programme itself consisted of seven structures
huts 54 x 20 ft. each; warehouses 88 x 393 ft.;
hospitals in units of 500 and 1,000 bed capacity; cool
stores with a capacity of 4,300 cubic feet each; Air
Force control towers; and power and transmitter huts.
The approximate cost of the major units was £l2O
each for huts; £3,300 each for warehouses; £6O per
bed for hospitals; and £2,360 each for cool stores.
The main scheme was worked on production, of two
basic structures, the hutments serving not only for
camps and ancillary buildings, but also for all hospital
buildings, while the warehouses called for a much
heavier type of framing.

HOSPITALS.
The type of hospital to be constructed from the
prefabricated material was designed for a spread over
a minimum area of 18 acres for 500 beds, and 26
acres for 1,000 beds, with an additional area to be
added if septic tanks were installed. Based on a
standard layout the buildings were to be grouped on
either side of a central service line containing path-
ways, water, sewerage, and electrical mains. The
buildings were to be at right angles to these central
lines, and parallel to the contours, to save excessive
excavation for floor levelling.
The standard portable hut was to be used in varying
combination for each size of prefabricated hospital,
with the addition of the necessary accessories. This
type of hut, with its wide overhanging eaves and
shelter ends, was designed for tropical use, and the
specifications called for it to be generally insulated
and fly-screened, with continuous openings at sides and
ends, protected with adjustable shutters. Floors were
normally to be of concrete.
Utilities provided with each hospital included the
reticulation of water, sewerage, electric light and
power, cool storage and laundry facilities. The
utilities were issued in pre-assembied parts, complete
with installation instructions, and could be installed
b> unskilled labour. Water supply and storage
design was based upon a consumption ranging from
26,000 gallons daily for a 500-bed hospital to 52,000
gallons daily for a 1,000-bed hospital, while electricity
consumption ranged from 24 kilowatts in the first
ease to 35 kilowatts in the second.
LINE PRODUCTION.
To carry out this major undertaking within the time-
limits set by the U.S. Army, it was necessary to
establish line production, occupying 40 acres of
1. Machines drilling warehouse members
2. Attaching iron couplings to sawn timber lengths

ground, and a total length of line production of
4,600 feet, with all necessary tools and machine
equipment. At the peak of production 2,000 work-
men were engaged upon the undertaking, a high
degree of efficiency being reached at a very early
stage of construction.
One of Australia’s leading building contractors was
appointed co-ordinating contractor, the various hut
and hospital bundling sections, hut and warehouse
manufacture, and storage depots being placed under
his agency. As a result of this arrangement it was
possible to provide a flexible basis to enable the
fluctuating demands of the U.S. Army to be co-related
immediately upon demand; to enable prompt adjust-
ments of supply as between the sections; to provide
a strong manufacturing unit on modern production
lines; to co-relate the functions of production, storage,
and despatch; and to increase production.
SUBCONTRACTS.
The hospital project included not only the supply
of hutments for use as wards and ancillary buildings,
but such items as hot water, drainage and water
supply installations; corrugated iron, asbestos cement
and linoflage sheeting; joinery accessories such as
doors, partitions, benches, tables; W.C. pans, sewerage
pipes, septic tanks, sinks, cisterns, grease traps;
bain maries and wiles cooker stoves; electrical cable,
globes, power points, switches, operating theatre
lights, etc. Altogether an additional 25 sub-contracts
were let out by the Council for their supply.
BUNDLING DEPOTS.
The Bundling Depots, which also included facilities
for the storage of prefabricated material pending
arrangements for its despatch, covered a total area
of 45 acres, most of it previously waste land. Depots
included sections for hospital bundling, hospital
storage, special building storage, hut manufacture,
hut bundling, and hut and warehouse storage.
The manufactured hut parts were picked up 1 y the
Council from the builders’ yards, and transported to
the Bundling and Storage yards. Here the parts
were received, counted, and checked, and then placed
in the stacking areas adjacent to the Bundling Shed.
The sheds were laid out with a series of transverse
production lines, each individual part being stacked
in its respective pile, and drawn from as required by
the bundling operators. Movable trolleys formed
work benches, and were complete with supplies of
nails, packing pieces, and labels. The complete
bundle was wired together with wire tying machines,
stencilled and moved on the trolley to the end of the
production line, swung on a turntable, and then
pushed on to skids and stacked. Mobile cranes
transported the bundles to storage areas.
The hospital frames were drawn from the central
bundling depot, and immediately stacked in the
storage areas. Joinery accessories generally were
bundled in the sub-contractors’ yards, and delivered
to No. 1 Depot for checking and stencilling with the
necessary U.S. markings, while such items as sewerage,
drainage, kitchen, and electrical equipment were
received, bundled, and marked in the No. 2 Hospital
Depot.
To ensure the easy and efficient erection of the
buildings, and the assemblage of these fittings, con-
sideration had to be given to the best method of
crating for storage, shipment, and handling in the
field. A considerable amount of experimental work
was carried out before satisfactory crates capable of
standing up to rough handling and specified field
requirements were designed.
LABELLING.
Attached to each crate was a metal label, numbered
and coloured in logical sequence, so as to simplify the
job of assemblage in the field. For instance, all
structural units were designated by a blue ' label,
while sheeting units, such as corrugated iron, asbestos
cement, or linoflage rolls carried a green label. These
colours were selected so that stock piles could be
created in the field according to their label colours,
and parts drawn in correct order by these colours,
so obviating the need for skilled storemen and
checkers.
In each bundle or crate was packed a printed
diagram in waterproof papers as protection against
damage, and showing clearly the methods required
for the erection and assembly of every item. The
numbers and directions on the assembly drawings
corresponded to the markings and numberings of the
fittings concerned. Thus a gang of men in the most
forward areas, and under the direction of only one
trained man, were able to fabricate a 500-bed hospital
in the comparatively short time of 60,000 man hours.
Each hospital of this size consisted of a total of
6,045 bundles, of which number 1,115 were frame
bundles. Approximately 10,000 metal labels were
required to identify the bundles.

Despatching a 1,000-bed hospital
for pre-cut warehouses were manufactured, bundled,
and stored at the Warehouse Depot. This type of
construction was designed as a standard building
393-ft. long by 88-ft. wide, but could be extended to
any length in units of 16-ft., which is the spacing of
the trusses. The whole of this type of construction
was not prefabricated in the true sense of the word,
as considerable labour, though unskilled, is required
in the field for its erection. Truss units were pre-
fabricated, but purlins (timber members connecting
the trusses ), and braces were nailed on the site.
Prefabricated timbers that do not need field work
were in hardwood, and purlins and braces in Oregon.
DESPATCH AND TRANSPORT.
So that loading and despatch might continue for
24 hours daily if required, all depots were floodlit,
and the organisation continually geared to a schedule
which allowed of an average shipment one day after
receipt of the shipping list. Various types of vessels
were used for the transport of the material, each of
the five holds of a Liberty ship being capable of taking
a 500-bed hospital, complete with installations.
Although at various times the depots were tested
to their uttermost, on no occasion did the Council
fail to fulfil a request by the U.S. Armed Forces,
no matter how short the notice of the shipment date
it had received. Upon one occasion, after shipping
in one week to the North one 1,000 bed and four
500-bed hospitals, representing a total dead weight
of 2,648,245 pounds, a request was received at 3 p.m.
on a Saturday for an additional 500-bed hospital.
By 8.45 a.m. on the Monday the shipment was on
its way.
MATERIALS SUPPLY.
Over a period of twelve months, timber used in
Prefabrication totalled 40,000,000 super feet; corru-
gated roofing iron 22,000 tons; abestos cement
1.300.000 square yards; piping 150 miles; various
sized bolts and nuts 500 tons; nails and screws
500 tons.
Owing to the great shortage of supply in galvanised
iron, the Council was obliged to improvise by having
ordinary black iron dipped with a protective coating
of camouflage paint, an innovation subsequently
adopted for various other types of jobs apart from
Prefabrication.
During the first six months of the Programme,
hospital buildings with a bed capacity of more than
20.000 nearly 40 times the capacity of Sydney or
Melbourne General Hospitals - - were delivered to
the U.S. Forces. Altogether sufficient buildings were
prefabricated to cover completely 18,274,000 square
feet, or to stretch end to end for more than 150 miles.
The weekly camp hutment output alone at this
stage was the equivalent of 500 weatherboard cottages.
An average floor area of 500,000 square feet was
manufactured each week. Assembled and crated
hospital, camp, and warehouse units were being
despatched at the rate of 10,000 tons a month.

DEPOTS AND CAMPS
Projects reaching a total cost of well over £2,000,000
were carried out during the period under review for
the purpose of providing administrative centres,
camps and accommodation of a general nature for
Service personnel.
Works undertaken included the construction of
barracks for administrative personnel in Brisbane and
Melbourne: Naval depots in Queensland, Victoria,
New South Wales, and Western Australia; Army
depots and staging camps; and Air Force depots to
provide accommodation for R.A.A.F. and U.S. per-
sonnel, particularly in North Queensland and the
Northern Territory.
ALBERT PARK.
One of the largest barracks projects undertaken for
the services is situated at Albert Park, Melbourne,
for the accommodation of Administrative personnel,
who were thus enabled to vacate school premises
formerly occupied by them.
Twelve two-storey buildings, each 324 x 42 feel,
have been erected, providing 323,000 square feet of
office space. In addition there is a large canteen
building.
An automatic telephone exchange, capable of
providing for 1,000 extensions, has been included and
installed by the Post Master General's Department.
The approximate cost of these barracks, including
all services, is £260,000.
TINANA STAGING CAMP.
Tinana Staging Camp, which is designed to accom-
modate 15,000 personnel, is located in forest country,
the buildings being dispersed over an area of
approximately 24 square miles.
The project called for roads, water reticulation,
and buildings, the latter being all, with the exception
of ablutions and latrines, of the U.S.A.S.O.S. pre-
fabricated type, erected on concrete floors.
Water was obtained from the Maryborough Reser-
voir, requiring a total of 18 miles of pipe line, with
all necessary storage tanks, fire plugs, and gale valves.
Two large warehouses were built on the main
railway line, complete with platforms and access
roads.
Equipment, such as bulldozers, graders, and power
shovels, were loaned by the U.S. authorities, and
greatly assisted in clearing the sites and expediting
construction.
A total of 500 Civil Constructional Corps members
were engaged upon the project, which was completed
in six months, well within the target date.


NAVAL DEPOTS.
Expenditure on the establishment of new Naval
Depots and extensions to existing accommodation, has
been approximately £250,000 for buildings and asso-
ciated services. Included in this amount is provision
of quarters for W.R.A.N.S.
BALMORAL NAVAL DEPOT.
The Balmoral Naval Depot occupies a site over-
looking Sydney Harbour. The main buildings are
of permanent construction, arranged so that the
general mass merges into the surrounding timbered
slopes.
Northern divisional camp
Additions carried out during the period for accom-
modation for W.R.A.N.S. are of a temporary nature,
but considerable care was shown in their siting, so
that the buildings might fit into the contours as suitably
as possible.
The temporary quarters consist of 14 structures,
complete with all services, and providing sleeping
and messing accommodation for personnel and officers.
These works were executed at a cost of £14,000.
NORTHERN NAVAL BASE.
Because the site selected was subject to flooding
by the tides, more than 27,000 cubic yards of filling,
pumped up from the sea bed, were used in building
up the area.
Apart from administrative buildings on the actual
site, the alterations to a former guesthouse were
effected to form a W.R.A.N.S. hostel.
Closely allied with the above Depot Camp is the
Naval Victualling Stores and Refrigeration Stores.
A.W.A.S. Camp, Northern Australia
AIR DEPOTS.
Construction under this heading was of a varied
nature, but was mainly concerned with the provision
of personnel accommodation upon the sites of aero-
dromes and Air Force stores and workshops.
An amount of £740,000 was expended during the
period upon these works, the largest single project
being £70,000 on buildings at a North Queensland
airport.
Typical of many of these depots, this project was
designed to meet the prevailing tropical conditions,
and to afford maximum free ventilation during the
summer months.
Construction included sleeping huts and ablutions,
complete with hot water, kitchens and mess huts,
together with Squadron Aid Posts and Sick Quarters,
water, electricity, and sanitary services.

STORES
Storage facilities provided by the Allied Works
Council during the period from July' 1, 1943, to
February 15, 1945, were on a colossal scale, covering
many thousands of acres of actual building space.
They embraced not only the usual warehousing
facilities, but large machine repair shops and fac-
tories, and railroad developments which included
the laying down of many miles of track.
A feature of the programme has been the establish-
ment of vast ordnance workshops and stores, as well
as ammunition depots, at the various breaks of gauge
throughout the Commonwealth, and their equipment
with special transfer sheds and three-rail devices to
facilitate the work of unloading and reloading material
from one rail system to another.
Buildings for warehousing purposes were stan-
dardised to a great extent, the “Wool Store” and
“Igloo” types of structure being adhered to where
possible.
ARMY STORAGE.
While it is impossible within the space available to
list the number and variety of storage projects
erected for Array, the following examples of works
undertaken or further developed give a general picture
of the types of projects carried out under this
heading:—
WALLANGARRA.
Established at the break of gauge between Queens-
land and New South Wales, the Wallangarra Army
Ordnance Depot covers an area of 708 acres, while
the Ammunition Depot takes up a further 570 acres.
Underground ammunition dump in Northern Australia


R.A.A.F. Store—Photo: D. of Air
Connecting by 10 miles of road from the railway
siding, 100 small stores, mostly 60 x 20 ft., and open
storage areas, now constitute the Ammunition Depot.
This includes 73 stores, 72 x 30 ft., constructed during
the last financial period an increase in storage of
over 50 per cent.
The Ordnance Depot and workshops area is occu-
pied by ordnance stores, A.E.M.E. workshops, armoury
workshop and test range, power houses, administrative
buildings, and camp buildings.
Among the new buildings erected during the period,
four provided additional storage of 98,000 ft. making
16 large stores in all, with a total floor area of
328,000 square feet.
Three additional workshops brought the number
of large workshops to eight, with a total floor space
of 150,000 square feet.
Water reticulation to the ammunition depot, ord-
nance stores, and workshop areas, with the necessary
service tanks, was finished, water being pumped from
a temporary source of supply.
Construction of a dam, with a crest length of
25 ft. and impounding 24,000,000 gallons of water
to a maximum depth of 25 ft. was completed, and will
form a permanent source of supply.
Works of a similar nature were carried out at
Bandiana, at the break of gauge between Victoria and
New South Wales, while other enormous ordnance
projects, each costing up to three-quarters of a million
pounds, were undertaken at Nungarin, W.A.. Mata-
ranka. N.T., and Calvert, Q.
NAVAL ORDNANCE.
Stores of various types, including ammunition
depots, were constructed or commenced for the
Department of the Navy in every State of the
Commonwealth.
RANDWICK.
Randwick Naval Stores, situated on a portion of the
old Randwick Rifle Range, forms one of the largest
building projects executed adjacent to Sydney during
the war period.
Army Ordnance Stores
Occupying an area of 54 acres, enclosed by man-
proof fencing, the Stores consist of 18 buildings, each
340 x 150 ft., giving a total storage of nearly
1,000,000 square feet, as well as administration
buildings, access roads, and park areas.
The buildings are of timber construction, with
weatherboard and fibro cement sheeting. Each build-
ing is floored with concrete capable of taking laden
trucks and heavy stores.
Altogether 385 skilled and unskilled workmen were
employed on this project, a feature of which was the
speed and efficiency of its construction.
Each floor slab contained a total of 980 cubic yards
of concrete, of which 168 cubic yards were poured
and finished off in one day.
After the floor slabs were finished, one store was
completed each four days, the record reaching one
store every 3% days.
Total cost was £325,000.


AIR STORES.
Apart from an even greater programme for the
construction of aircraft repair depots, which is dealt
with elsewhere in this report, storage projects were
constructed during the period on behalf of the Aus-
tralian and Allied Air Forces at an approximate
total cost of nearly £1,000,000.
MACROSSAN
The No. 8 Stores Depot project at Macrossan,
Queensland, consists of over 70 buildings, which range
from large stores 300 x 230 ft. built to a special design,
to camp hutments for personnel, together with roads,
a railway loop one mile long, water supply, electricity
and sewerage.
Included in the project are two store buildings of
the Igloo type with a 5-ton overhead travelling crane,
three Wool Store type stores, each 100 x 100 ft., and
two steel hangars, each 100 x 90 ft.
Material used in each of the large store buildings
included 1,620 cubic feet of concrete, reinforced with
150 tons of steel; 206,000 super feet of timber;
30,000 bolts; and 90 tons of corrugated iron.
Naval Stores
During the peak period of construction, which
occupied four months, 300 C.C.C. personnel were
employed on the project, the approximate cost of
which was £200,000.
TOTTENHAM.
No. 5 Stores Depot, Tottenham, Victoria, consists
of 10 major store buildings, the six largest of them
measuring 421 x 152 ft. each.
Other buildings include administrative quarters,
motor transport workshop, woodworking shop, packing
case stores, and camp areas for R.A.A.F. and
W.A.A.A.F. personnel.
As the depot is of a permanent nature, the main
structures are being erected with brick external walls,
and concrete floors. A crane bay occurs down the
centre of the larger buildings.
The total requisition amount for this project is
£332,000.
ELECTRICITY SUPPLY.
With the establishment of large Service installations
in the Charters Towers area, the peace-time electric
power supply was unable to cope with Service
demands, necessitating the installation of additional
generating plant.
A 770 H.P. Diesel alternator set, destined before
the war for use on one of the Pacific Islands, was
impressed and installed in the Charters Towers
powerhouse.
The additional electricity supply was reticulated
over a high tension network covering a distance of
50 miles, construction of the network requiring the
erection of 1,500 bolts, 4,500 insulators, and the
stringing of 150 miles of cables.
Twenty-one step-down substations were constructed
on this high tension network at various points within
Service establishments, while three large steel con-
ductors were carried over a clear span of 1,500 feet
across the Burdekin River.
Over 1,000,000 units of electric energy have so far
been generated for the Services as a result of this
project, which was implemented only by the closely
co-ordinated efforts of the local supply authorities,
the Armed Forces and the Allied Works Council.

HOSPITALS
Expansion of hospital accommodation required by
the Australian and United States Forces throughout
Australia during the period covered by this report
included structures of both a permanent and temporary-
nature, as well as a number of units erected from
material supplied by the Council’s Prefabrication
Section in New South Wales.
Apart from accommodation for the various fighting
services, a new feature of hospital construction during
the period was the building of additional hospitals
and extensions carried out for the Repatriation Com-
mission, due to the increasing flow of personnel from
the Services back to civil life.
It is impossible to cover fully each of the projects
undertaken, and a few only of the more important
ones are dealt with below.
no A.G.H., HOLLYWOOD.
The extensions to this hospital comprise generally
the provision of additional ward blocks, bringing the
total bed capacity up to 558. In addition to the ward
blocks, a modern steam laundry is being provided
which will be capable of providing fully for the
hospital’s requirements and certain ancillary external
establishments.
An interesting feature of the additions is the pro-
vision of a Chapel. Temporary additions have also
been provided for the accommodation of the increased
Staff personnel. These extensions have been under-
taken at a cost of approximate!v £194,000.
112 A.G.H., GREENSLOPES.
Additional accommodation to bring the bed capacity
of this hospital up to 600 patients, is being provided.
Hobart Repatriation Hospital


This comprises the establishments of three new
permanent ward blocks, now completed, additions
to the boiler house, and a modern new laundry block,
together with the provision of minor ancillary build-
ings, roads and services.
Work on the main administration building is now
in hand. Its completion will provide all the original
facilities as planned for this hospital group.
ROSS RIVER, TOWNSVILLE.
This project has been constructed on a site adjacent
to Ross River, about 6 miles from Townsville, at a
cost of approximately £133,000.
The buildings are of the Standard Field Hospital
type, designed for Army requirements, but with
modifications to make the buildings suitable for
tropical conditions. This is the first hospital of such
a character which has been undertaken.
Special attention has been given in the design to
ensure a maximum of ventilation and the provision of
shade from the tropical sun. This has been achieved
by the extensive use of shutters and wide overhanging
eaves and gables. All buildings have been completely
fly-proofed.
Buildings constructed comprise ward blocks each
accommodating 60 patients, Operating Theatre Block,
Dispensary, Pathological, Dental, X-ray and other
specialist facilities, together with a large kitchen
and associated messes for Staff and walking patients.
Present ward construction provides for 304 patients
only, but ancillary facilities are capable of carrying
additional ward accommodation to provide up to
600 beds.
The hospital is equipped with electric light, hot
and cold water, sewerage and IV4 miles of gravelled
roads connecting the various buildings. Work on this
project was commenced early in March, 1944.
REPATRIATION GENERAL HOSPITAL,
HOBART.
This hospital was designed by the Council in
consultation with the Chief Medical Officer, Repatria-
tion Commission Headquarters.
One building, the new ward block, has been
completed at a cost of approximately £40,000 including
furnishing and equipment and work has commenced
on the construction of new nurses’ quarters at a cost
of approximately £35,000 including furnishing and
equipment.
The new ward block provides accommodation for
60 patients, two Operating Theatres, X-Ray and Plaster
rooms, and other ancillary facilities. The whole
View of interior of tented ward of
Military Hospital in Northern Australia
building is of modern design and is in keeping with
the most up-to-date trend in hospital construction.
The new building for the nurses and household
workers’ staff, like the ward block is a modern
conception in keeping with modern facilities necessary
for such establishments.
KENMORE SANATORIUM, QUEENSLAND.
Constructed for the Department of Repatriation as
a T.B. Sanatorium for ex-Service personnel, this
project was also designed by the Council in consulta-
tion with the Chief Medical Officer, Repatriation
Commission Headquarters.
Erected on a site of 43 acres, approximately 10
miles from Brisbane, the buildings are modern in
design and are constructed of timber frames with
corrugated asbestos cement roofs.
Careful consideration has been given in the design
to the provision of adequate ventilation. At present
one chalet for the accommodation of 32 patients has
been erected, with kitchen and administrative facilities
capable of providing for an increased number of
inmates. The erection of quarters for the nurses and
household workers and male staff is now in course
of erection.
The design provides for an additional chalet, giving
a total accommodation for 64 patients.
The present section of the project has been erected
at a cost of approximately £25,000 and £14,000 has
been provided for the staff quarters.


LADY DAVIDSON HOME,
TURRAMURRA, N.S.W.
Extensions to this establishment have been carried
out at a total cost of £46,000. These provide for
additional chalets, wards and messes, quarters, etc.
JUNGARA PREFABRICATED HOSPITAL.
Erected to provide hospital accommodation for the
United States Army, this is the first of such hospitals
built by the Council of a completely prefabricated
nature.
Prefabrication has been undertaken from designs
prepared by the United States Army engineers. The
buildings are erected on a site close to Cairns.
The hospital has a 750 bed capacity, and is com-
pletely equipped with all services. In all, 124
buildings were erected, including wards, operating
theatres and accommodation for the nursing staff, etc.
The prefabricated parts were constructed in Sydney
under the Council’s control and were shipped direct
to Cairns and transported to the site, both American
and A.W.C. transport being used for this purpose.
Thirty-six hours from the commen'-ement of tic hist
move, each concrete floor slab contained its quota
of the 1,500 tons of materials ready for erection
A similar hospital of 1,000 bed capacity has also
been erected at Black River, close to Townsville, and
one of 750 beds at Ekibin.
Each hospital is provided with services for water,
electric light and sewerage. Roads and paths have
been laid and connect the various buildings.
YERONGA WOMEN'S HOSPITAL.
Erected on a pleasant site close to Brisbane, this
hospital provides accommodation for 200 service
women patients in ward buildings of the standard
camp hospital type. In addition there is a well
equipped operating theatre and other usual ancillary
facilities and services, together with accommodation
for staff.
FLINDERS NAVAL DEPOT.
Expansion of the Naval programme has necessitated
extensions to the hospital facilities and in this connec-
tion new ward blocks, and a kitchen of modern design
have been added. Further construction is to be
undertaken.

DEHYDRATION
Nearly 30 factories for the dehydration of vegetables
have been erected by the Allied Works Council in
various centres throughout Southern and Eastern
Australia.
More than 3,500,000 pounds of raw vegetables per
week, which are converted into approximately 340,000
pounds of the dehydrated product, are at present being
treated at the factories provided under this scheme.
The output is still increasing.
Before the war very few vegetable dehydrating
plants were operating in Australia, and those only on
a limited scale.
The factories have been established in centres
adjacent to the vegetable growing areas. Each has
been planned to suit the requirements of its particular
locality, and the types of vegetables it is proposed to
handle there.
Vegetables treated are potatoes, carrots, cabbage,
parsnips, onions and beet. Construction includes the
provision of facilities to permit of the product being
packed in tins containing from 7 to 11 lbs. of the
finished article.
Water is used in very large quantities in the
various processes, and in many instances the local
water supply had to be considerably augmented to
meet the demand.
As a result of the large scale water consumption,
problems of effluent treatment and disposal were
created, necessitating considerable research by the
technical staff of the Allied Works Council.
Building costs of the programme are estimated to
exceed £750,000, the approximate quantities of the
main materials being as follows:
Timber 1,900,000 super feet
Cement 3,060 tons
Screenings 10,000 cubic yards
Gravel 2,000 cubic yards
Reinforcing Steel 2,800 tons
Steel Plate 2,400 tons
Glass 100,000 square feet
Each factory is provided with first aid rooms; cloak
and locker rooms, wash and shower rooms, with hot
and cold water; and a cafeteria and luncheon room,
capable of providing hot meals for the entire staff.
The total output of these factories is at present
absorbed by the Allied fighting forces, mainly in the
S.W. Pacific areas. In the Post-War period the
products are bound to play an important part in
feeding the peoples of countries ravaged by war.

MAINTENANCE
Special attention was given during the period under
review to General Maintenance, which included
measures not only for the preservation of Allied Works
Council projects, but also for older establishments,
many of which were falling into disrepair.
The exact value of the assets to be maintained would
be hard to assess, but is reckoned in hundreds of
millions of pounds, and covers permanent, semi-
permanent, and temporary structures; thousands of
miles of strategic roads; nation-wide chains of aero-
dromes; and considerable harbour installations.
A maintenance organisation has been set up to cover
all work required to keep Commonwealth assets in a
state of repair commensurate with their permanency
and use. An indication of the size of this undertaking
is given by the fact that the cost of maintenance as
from July 1, 1944, to February 15, 1945, was
£2,400,000.
The position of maintenance works being carried
out for the various Departments is as under:
Department of Air: On all major R.A.A.F. Stations,
a civilian gang has been placed under the control of
a supervisor employed by the Allied Works Council.
The gang maintains all buildings and services on the
station. Many runways, taxiways and roads have
been resurfaced, and constant attention is given to
the patching, grading and general repair of airfields.
Department of Army: Minor maintenance works in
camps is carried out by Army personnel, but these
matters are gradually referred to the Council as such
personnel move on. Major works such as the main-
tenance of strategic and defence roads in Queensland
and the Northern Territory, maintenance of large
establishments and of rifle ranges, drill halls and
permanent buildings are cared for by the Council.
The major work is perhaps the maintenance of the
Stuart and Barkly Highways. This has involved the
setting up of road patrol gangs and camps, and the
establishment of a bitumen sealing organisation in
the Northern Territory.
Department of Navy: All maintenance works on
land based establishments controlled by Navy are
carried out by the Council. This involves the dredging
of berths and maintenance of buildings, wharves,
harbour installations, pipe lines and oil installations.
Department of Munitions: The Council is carrying
out the maintenance of buildings and civil engineering
Opposite: Gravel pit, Northern Australia
services at all Munitions establishments. This involves
a large repair and maintenance programme, and
includes resurfacing of roads and cleanways, main-
tenance of sewerage and drainage installations, and
general building repairs. Maintenance gangs are
continually employed at the larger establishments, and
as required at the smaller factories.
Department of Commerce and Agriculture: The
maintenance of buildings used for the dehydration of
food stuffs, and the storage of such items as potatoes
and rice, is being carried out as required under a
general arrangement with this Department.
Department of Aircraft Production: Pending com-
pletion of arrangements for the carrying out of
regular maintenance under conditions somewhat
similar to those governing works for Munitions, the
Council is carrying out necessary maintenance.
Other Departments Generally: Normal maintenance
is being carried out as usual. Because of the wartime
construction programme, many establishments have
fallen into disrepair, so that a larger maintenance
programme than usual is required. It is hoped to
gradually make up the leeway as conditions reach
normal.
Apart from its work as the maintenance authority
for all Commonwealth Departments and property, the
Council has undertaken the maintenance of all build-
ings and services, including camps, hospitals and
stores, for U.S.A.S.O.S.
Maintenance work, including repairs and altera-
tions, are also being carried out on behalf of the
Royal Navy, which Service has asked for estimates for
all of its establishments.
A certain amount of maintenance work has also
been undertaken on behalf of the Netherlands East
Indies Government.

MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT AND
MATERIALS SUPPLY DIRECTORATE
During the period under review expenditure in the
Plant and Materials Trust Account has been increased b}
£22,000,000, making a total expenditure on this account
since the formation of Mechanical Equipment and Materials
Directorate of £31,500,000. The activities of this
Directorate are here briefly summarised:—
EARTH-WORKING PLANT MACHINERY
AND TRANSPORT VEHICLES.
Purchase and Allocation of Plant, Machinery and
Vehicles from Australian and Overseas manufacturers.
Plant Valuation.
Plant servicing and maintenance, including the
setting up and running of Workshops in outlying
areas.
Spare parts control and supply.
Census of privately-owned plant.
Recording of plant movements.
MATERIALS.
Control and direction of materials required.
Estimation of quantities of materials necessary and
arrangements for quotas in relation to other Defence
requirements.
Purchase and supply of materials and specialised
equipment.
Control of materials by Reserve Stocks held by
Merchants for issue to Allied Works Council projects.
Supply of Bitumen for use in all strategic roads and
aerodromes.
Timber Mills in Northern Territory.
TRANSPORT AND SHIPPING.
Transport of all requirements of the Council by
road, rail, sea and air, including Customs clearance
of Imported items.
STORAGE.
Storage of Plant, materials and equipment in all
States and the Northern Territory.
DISPOSALS AND SALVAGE.
Disposal of all surplus items and collection of
Salvage.
PLANT AND MATERIALS FOR SERVICES
AND GOVERNMENTAL INSTRUMENTALITIES.
As well as supplies required by the Allied Works
Council, further Plant and Materials have been pro-
cured for allocation to Works Units of R.A.A.F.,
Australian Army, Navy, U.S. Armed Forces in
Australia, and for State Instrumentalities acting on
behalf of the Allied Works Council. The Allied
Works Council acts as Commonwealth Co-ordinating
Authority for Earth-moving Equipment.
MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT.
The Directorate continued the co-ordination of manu-
facture of Earth-moving Equipment in Australia
through Factory Equipment Section and production
was further stepped up by introducing more manufac-
turers into this class of equipment and arranging so
that manufacture could be on mass production lines.
Adoption of standardisation in connection with Earth-
moving Equipment also accelerated production.


During the period in question, 5,744 items of plant
were manufactured in Australia for supply to the
Services and others, to the total approximate value of
£3,234,188. In addition 3,947 items were acquired
from Overseas to the value of £3,710,080, distributed
as follows:
A.W.C. and
US.A.S.O.S. R.A.E. R.A.A.F. Others
Australian Manfrs. 1,863 2,183 771 927
Imported from U.S.A 744 857 443 1,903
Total items of Plant 9,691 Value £6,944,268.
Locally-produced items were of many different types,
the more important being pneumatic tyred scraper-
scoops, motor graders with imported power units,
drawn graders, bulldozers, bitumen sprayers, bitumen
healers, tractor and mobile cranes, aggregate loaders,
concrete mixers, power rooters, rippers, sheepsfoot
rollers, power rollers, 3/8 yard excavators, power
control units, logging and pile-driving winches and
stone crushers.
Imported items were mainly crawler tractors of
various sizes, wheel tractors and power units for motor
graders, tournapulls, ditching machines, mechanical
loaders, mechanical shovels, mobile workshops.
Impressment of plant practically ceased during
1943, owing to the influx from the United States of
numerous items in short supply. Because of the
improved deliveries from overseas, it was possible to
afford a measure of assistance to other Commonwealth
Departments controlling such activities as Timber
production. Mineral production, Coal production and
Food production.
CO-ORDINATION OF PLANT.
Forward Planning: The Allied Works Council is
represented on the Programming sub-committee of the
Applied Supply Council and in co-operation with
other Commonwealth Departments and more particu-
larly the Division of Import Procurement, has con-
tinued the preparation of details, as required, of
forward requirements of tractors and earth-moving
equipment to be obtained from Overseas sources, for
submission to Washington, D.C., of requirements of
all Programming Departments.
Plant Recording: A complete record has been
established of all plant acquired by the Allied Works
Council. A description of each item of plant, details
of the conditions under which it was acquired, the
State or Territory in which it is situated, and
particulars of its ultimate disposal are kept at Head
Office.
Hiring of Plant: A considerable quantity of plant
and equipment is hired to constructing authorities
Bulldozer clearing surface
for use on Allied Works Council projects. 'The hire,
rates, which cover depreciation and cost of major
overhauls have been reviewed from time to time in
order that rates charged for the hire of the plant be
based, commensurate with the need for completely
writing off the value of each item by the time the
end of its useful life is reached.
Control of privately-owned earth-moving equipment:
Although the control of such equipment was instituted
in April, 1942, it has been necessary to acquire only
a few items of plant, during the period covered by
impressment and in all such cases the equipment
concerned possessed special features. The records
obtained by the Census of Plant in April, 1942, have,
however, been kept up to date.
Spare Parts for Earth-Moving Equipment: Control
of spare parts of tractors and earth-moving equipment
by the Mechanical Equipment and Materials Supply
Directorate was continued throughout the period.
After providing for the needs of the Services and
Defence Works, it was found possible to release an
appreciable quantity of parts to other users, particu-
larly those engaged in food, mineral and timber
production and in essential civilian services.
Rubber Tyres and Tubes; Close liaison was main-
tained with Rubber Control with regard to the supply
of tyres and tubes for use on Allied Works Council
vehicles and equipment. Stocks held at centres
throughout Australia were kept under constant review
and steps were taken to achieve the maximum degree
of economy and efficiency in the use of rubber.
WORKSHOPS.
To maintain the plant used by the Allied Works
Council, many workshops have been set up and
developed for this important purpose in the Northern

Territory and Queensland. The value of repair and
maintenance work executed by the several workshops
has approximated £1,000,000.
MATERIALS.
The supply of materials for works carried out by
the Allied Works Council, has still presented a major
problem, especially in the distant parts of Northern
Queensland, and in the Northern Territory.
The planning of this supply by the Head-office of
this Directorate under “Materials Control” has meant
much statistical work in obtaining and co-ordinating
estimates of requirements from all States to ensure
supply of materials.
SUPPLY OF SPECIAL ITEMS THROUGH
TRADE CHANNELS.
The procedure has been continued whereby stocks
in short supply have been held by reserve merchants
for the Allied Works Council, this supply to go
through usual trade channels, and yet be under
necessary control and held in the areas where required.
QUANTITIES.
The following schedule of certain items of materials
procured during the period under review should convey
some idea of the magnitude of this supply in all parts
of the Commonwealth: —
Scantling 135,227,767 super feet
Flooring 63,845,163 lineal feet
Mosquito Netting 18,094 rolls
Wood Screws 206 tons
Roofing Screws 201 tons
Asbestos Sheet 6,715,926 square yards
Glazed E/ware Pipes 1,273,356 lineal feet
Concrete Pipes 836,093 lineal feet
Wrought Iron Pipes 7,104,944 lineal feet
Steel Pipes 239,757 lineal feet
Cast Iron Pipes 442,688 lineal feet
Armco Pipes 690,802 lineal feet
Fibro Pipes 1,143,567 lineal feet
Corrugated Iron 39,728 tons
Plain Iron 5,658 tons
Wire Nails 2,329 tons
Roofing Nails 521 tons
Bolts and Nuts 2,177 tons
Masonite 8,334,061 square feet
Caneite 13,618,676 square feet
Plywood 5,208,021 square feet
Cement 316,118 tons
Reinforcing Rods 13,768 tons
Paint 504,042 gallons
Fencing Wire 1,158 tons
Bulldozers operating in Far North Queensland gravel pit
In addition to those items many other types must
be added which, because they are not in critically
short supply, have not been recorded. Also, apart
from usual building materials, such items as Wire
Rope, Electrical Cable, Electrical Equipment, Piles,
Oils, Chemicals, Rope, Steel, etc., have been procured.
TRANSPORT.
It has been the responsibility of this Directorate
to arrange all transport for the Allied Works Council
by road, rail, sea and air. This has been done by
close liaison with Shipping Control Board, Land
Transport Board and the Department of Civil Aviation
and R.A.A.F. As much as 6,000 to 7,000 tons per
Island petrol dump


month have been shipped by sea to the Northern
Territory, as well as many additional tons by rail from
Melbourne and Sydney to Alice Springs and thence
by road to the Northern areas. Another route is
from Townsville to Mt. Isa by rail, for onward
despatch by road.
STORAGE.
With undertakings such as executed by the Allied
Works Council, a very comprehensive stores system
has had to be established. A headquarters Store in
Melbourne has functioned very satisfactorily for the
storage of plant, materials, clothing, canteen and
medical supplies, tyres, tools, etc., covering approxi-
mately 1,300 invoices issued monthly, some of which
invoices comprise many thousands of items, including
clothing, tools, etc.
Interior of section of A.W.C. Store
Stores have bteen established throughout the
Northern Territory. New South Wales has also its
own stores for material and equipment, whilst in
other States, stores are run in conjunction with State
Road Instrumentalities, enabling stores to be held in
many centres, especially in Queensland, where Allied
Works projects have been spread over almost the
whole State.
SALVAGE.
This section has been commenced during the past
few months, salvage being instituted at the request
of the Commonwealth Salvage Commission, for the
collection of waste paper, cardboard, rag, tyres, rope,
dunnage, waste metals, etc. Waste material is being
collected from offices, camps, stores, workshops,
garages and projects throughout the Commonwealth.
DISPOSALS.
A special Allied Works Council committee was
formed in March, 1944, to direct disposals of surplus
plant, materials and equipment now no longer required
by the Allied Works Council, such disposals being
arranged with the concurrence of the Department of
Supply and Shipping, pending the formation of the
Commonwealth Disposals Commission. It particularly
provides for disposal of plant to other Governmental
bodies and to private users engaged in work of National
importance by sponsorship of a Government Depart-
ment, and to Shire Councils in order that replacement
may be made of similar items of plant previously
impressed from them when the need was urgent.
Surplus clothing and messing equipment has also
been diverted through the Controller of the items to
the Army, Air Force, Navy, U.S. Forces, etc.
BITUMINOUS MATERIALS.
The Allied Works Council has continued its
responsibility for the requisitioning and distribution
of bituminous materials throughout the Commonwealth
of Australia, for the construction of strategic and
main supply roads, flight strips, camp and factory
sites, and miscellaneous defence works. Estimated
requirements are obtained from all States and sub-
mitted to the Central Bitumen Control Committee,
upon which the Allied Works Council is represented.
These requirements are passed through the Depart-
ment of Supply and Shipping for purchase by the
Division of Import Procurement, and implemented
either through Lend-Lease or by direct negotiation.
On arrival of the material in the various States, release
is arranged through the subsidiary State Committees
which are responsible for Bitumen stocks within their
respective States.
The supply in the period under review has been
adequate for all defence needs and has aggregated
many thousands of tons, representing a considerable
proportion of the total of more than 50,000 tons of
Bitumen and several million gallons of Tar that
have been used in Australia since the inception of
the Allied Works Council.


CHAPTER
7
PERSONNEL DIRECTORATE
Called into Being on March 13, 1942, for the purpose
of controlling the Civil Constructional Corps during the
period under review the Directorate of Personnel was
faced with a constantly changing industrial situation, calling
for a re-orientation of many aspects of its policy.
Although the gross total value of works projects
carried out by the Council for the period July 1, 1943,
to February 15, 1945, was £65,425,790 as compared
with £79,304,830 for the period February 26, 1942,
to June 30, 1943, membership of the Civil Construc-
tional Corps on February 15, 1945, stood at 16,701,
a reduction of 68.8 per cent, as compared with
53,518 on June 30, 1943.
Fundamental cause for the reduction in the member-
ship of the Corps was the improving war situation in
the Pacific, resulting in a gradual lessening of demands
for constructional work in the southern States of the
Commonwealth.
A further reason for the acceleration in the discharge
of Corps members was the Federal Government’s
decision, which was also ' actuated by the improved
Pacific situation, in the latter part of the fiscal year
to return to the normal contractual custom wherever
possible, whereby work is undertaken by contractors
on a firm price basis, and with the employment of
free labour.
Cost-plus fixed fee innovation was early introduced
into the Council’s procedures because of the exigencies
within the war situation, precluding the Usual prepara-
tion of requisite papers and essential designs required
under ordinary system.
So far it has not been possible to revert fully
throughout Australia to the normal contract procedure.
In the northern States or areas it is for many reasons
more expedient to adhere to the cost-plus system.
The substantial decrease in the strength of the
Corps automatically brought about the closing of a
number of camps, messes, and canteens; made neces-
sary the re-organisation of supplies of camp material
and foodstuffs; required the curtailment and readjust-
ment of medical and welfare services, and field staffs;
caused the discontinuance of training schools; and,
coincidentally, reacted on the Personnel Branch Offices
which are undergoing a complete re-organisation and
a general reduction of staff.
MECHANICAL TRAINING SCHOOLS.
Because by that time it was possible to meet the
demand for skilled mechanics, plant operators, and
truck drivers, the Mechanical Training Schools estab-
lished by the Council at Maribyrnong, Victoria, and
Rydalmere, New South Wales, were closed on March
30, 1944.
During the period in which they operated the schools
trained 703 Truck Drivers, 218 Motor Mechanics, 78
Diesel Mechanics, and 176 Plant Operators for the
Civil Constructional Corps.
Personnel trained as Plant Operators for other
units were 155 for the U.S. Army; 144 for the
Australian Army; 22 for R.A.A.F.; and 7 for Civil
Aviation. An additional 17 were trained as Diesel
Mechanics for the Australian Army, making an inclu-
sive total of 1,520 trainees.
LABOUR CONTROL DIVISION.
Starting the period at July 1, 1943, with a nett
enrolment for Australia of 53,518 members in the
Civil Constructional Corps, the monthly total declined
to a low level of 16,701 at February 15, 1945, being
36.817 members less or a reduction of 68.8 per cent.
This reduction is shown in monthly figures State by
State in Table 1.

Gross enrolments in the Civil Constructional Corps February 15, 1945, the number grew to 75,864,
from its inception to June 30, 1943, were 66,274 thereby adding only a further 9,590 members. See
members, and during the period June 30, 1943, to Table 11.
Since the inception of the Corps 59,163 members
were discharged, being an increase of 46,407 more
than the 12,756 that were discharged during the first
14 months of the Corps’ existence.
This steep rise in the number of discharged with a
declining rate of intake resulted in the sharp drop of
net enrolments over the period. Changing conditions
made the more selective handling of members impera-
tive for the reason that a somewhat different kind of
constructional work became concentrated in Northern
Areas, where climatic conditions demand the highest
personal fitness. Thousands of members who were
early enrolled (many of them on actual jobs) without
having been medically examined, a physical impossi-
bility in those days, were, on examination at the
conclusion of their annual leave, found to be not of a
sufficiently high medical standard, and accordingly
were discharged.
The continued intake of men, notwithstanding the
heavy discharges, was made necessary by the need in
northern areas of men of the highest physical standard,
and the need of extra technicians for the class of work
being done in the North. These figures do not take into
account non-C.C.C. members in the employ of
contractors engaged on Allied Works Council projects.

The number of men enrolled in each State at
February 15, 1945, as compared with the number at
June 30, 1943, shows in what State the greatest loss
per cent, of enrolments has occurred. Table V
shows in the first period that New South Wales had
Recruitment was made in three categories: (i)
Volunteers, (ii) Enrolled on the job, (iii) Directed
to serve.
The total of members enrolled on their jobs was
nearly half the total of those who volunteered and were
23,166 members or 43.3% of the total; while on
February 15, 1945, the number was 6,929 or 41.4%;
the Victorian figure of 11,166 or 20.9% changed to
2,292 or 13.7%; and Queensland enrolments changed
from 16,813 or 31.4% to 6,187 or 37.4%.
called up, while the volunteers exceeded half the
number of those who were directed to serve.
These are the three broad divisions into which enrol-
ments naturally fell, and it is interesting to note the
proportion of each, as may be seen in Table VI.

Reasons for the discharge of members are many,
and a partial analysis of them will be found in Table
IX. Medical unfitness is the predominating reason
which is explained elsewhere.
INDUSTRIAL ADMINISTRATION.
Terms and conditions of service of members of
the Civil Constructional Corps were regulated in 1942,
by determinations made by the Director-General in
respect to the States of New South Wales, Victoria,
Queensland, Western Australia, and the Northern
Territory; wages under these determinations were
those prescribed by the relevant State awards.
However, as the increasing transfer of Corps mem-
bers interstate became necessary, it soon became
obvious that a Commonwealth Award was essential.
Towards the end of 1942, an approach was made,
therefore, to the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation
and Arbitration, to promulgate an award covering
members of the Civil Constructional Corps in what-
soever State they were employed.
In consequence of this, Mr. Justice O’Mara, on
March 5, 1943, made an award in respect to members
employed in the States of New South Wales, Queens-
land and Victoria; and subsequently, it was extended
to members employed in South Australia.
This award applied also to the Northern Territory,
except in regard to ordinary rates of pay, because
the Court desired to see the conditions under which
members in the Territory were working before it
would alter the rates provided for the Northern
Territory under the Director-General’s Determination.
On November 25, 1943, the Court varied and con-
solidated the award of March 5, 1943, as a result of
applications made on behalf of the Director-General
and a number of Unions.
Increased rates of pay for certain classifications,
payment for travelling during week-ends, suspension
of members for misconduct, additional annual leave
for members on continuous country work, and
unlimited sick leave with pay for members required
to remain in a camp or elsewhere than their usual
place of residence all these were provided for in the
variation.
The position at June 30, 1944, was that the award
of November 25, 1943, applied to members in the
States of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and
South Australia; and the award of March 5, 1943,
applied to the Northern Territory as far as conditions
are concerned, but not as to rates of pay; no award
was made in respect of Western Australia as the
Corps was disbanded in that State.
On November 20, 1944, application was made to
the Court on behalf of the Director-General for the
extension to the Northern Territory of the award
of November 25, 1943. This application was opposed
by representatives of the members concerned, who
contended that the conditions of the said award should
apply, but the rates then being paid should continue
to operate. Judgment on the matter was reserved
by the Court.
With the exception of three strikes in New South
Wales, Queensland and the Northern Territory res-
pectively, little industrial trouble was experienced in
the period under review.
COMPENSATION.
Payment of compensation to members of the Civil
Constructional Corps who sustain personal injury
by accident or who contract certain industrial diseases
is made under National Security (Civil Constructional
Corps Compensation) Regulations which were pro-
mulgated on February 9, 1944. Prior to this date,
members, except in Queensland and the Northern
Territory, received compensation in accordance with
the provisions of the Workers Compensation Legisla-
tion of the State in which they were employed at the
time of injury.


The scheme now embodied in National Security
Regulations has operated in Queensland since October,
1942, and in the Northern Territory since December,
1942. In addition, to cover for injuries and industrial
diseases which occur in the course of employment, the
Regulations also provide for War injuries and for
injuries sustained without the members own default
or wilful act in a camp in which he is required to
live, or during travel to and from duty.
MEDICAL SERVICES.
Specifically charged with duties relating to the
enrolment of fit men into the Civil Constructional
Corps, and to the protection and improvement of their
health, the Medical Service, since its inception, has
supplied Doctors, Medical Orderlies, and Nurses to
201 Civil Constructional Corps Camps: 67 in New
South Wales, 73 in Queensland, and 61 in the Northern
Territory which included Tennant Creek and Mt. Isa
Road, and there were 21 Doctors, 78 Medical
Orderlies, and 46 nurses on active duty at the end
of the fiscal year 1944.
Medical examinations for enrolments and reclassifi-
cations required a large part of the time of the
medical staff in the Personnel Branches.
Medical Service is rendered to Corps members
wherever they are, including the remotest projects
and camps; and, it is estimated that an average of
20,000 cases were treated each month throughout
Australia in the period under review.
The facilities of the Army Medical Services have
always been available to Corps members; in Northern
Australia members had the use of Service Hospitals
as well as the attention of Service Medical Officers.
This was free of all charge to the Council.
C.C.C. Camp in Central Australia.
Civil Aliens' mess hut
CAMP SANITATION.
The duties of the Medical Services include regular
inspections of the sanitary condition of all Corps
camps, and its officers submit recommendations on all
questions connected with hygiene and sanitation in
relation to authorised and accepted standards of
health conditions. These specific duties have been
carried out in such a manner that new standards have
been set for erection and upkeep of camps in which
large numbers of men have to live.
SUPPLY DIVISION.
The Supply Division of the Directorate of Personnel
exercises control of Civil Constructional Corps messes
and canteens; attends to the procurement and distribu-
tion of supplies for free issue and for sale; super-
vises rationing regulations; trains kitchen personnel;
and purchases materials for other divisions of the
Directorate.
MESSING.
For the period under review, meals served in
messes under the control of the Allied Works
Council reached the astronomical figure of 25,626,471.
Quantities of some of the items of food used in
these messes during the period were:
7V 2 million pounds of bread,
7/4 million pounds of meat,
7 million pounds of potatoes.
2% million pounds of butter, and
7 million pounds of vegetables.
Total cost of these meals, in terms of food and
wages, was £2,043,819, representing an average cost
of 1/7 per meal.

Rations for each were drawn from the nearest
Divisional Issuing depot of the Australian Armed
Forces.
Close supervision of the allocation of kitchen
personnel did much to keep costs within economical
bounds, the basis of it being the operation of a
manning scale which determined the number of cooks,
cooks’ offsiders, kitchenmen, and butchers required to
provide any given number of meals.
STAFF HOSTELS.
Because of the lack of accommodation space in
northern areas, the Council found it necessary to
establish a number of hostels for members of its
staff, both resident and itinerant. Eight have been
opened; one at Brisbane, two at Townsville, one at
Cairns, three at Alice Springs, and one at Adelaide
River.
Fifty-four of these Canteens were in operation
during January, 1945; 13 in New South Wales,
1 in Western Australia, 16 in Northern Territory,
20 in Queensland, and 4 in Victoria. Where it is
impracticable to establish fixed canteens, adequate
provision was made for members to be serviced at
regular intervals through mobile units which,
collectively, travelled 236,475 miles during the
period under review.
To simplify accounting procedure, goods sent to
Canteens are debited at Selling Prices. These prices
are standardised throughout Australia. Thus, it is
possible for a member in Northern Australia to buy
the same goods at the prices offering in canteens that
are near to Capital Cities; distance does not cause
fluctuation in prices.
LEGAL SECTION.
It is the responsibility of the Legal Office to maintain
the discipline of each member of the Corps and
generally to supervise the National Security ( Allied
Works) Regulations.
To take care of members who absent themselves
without leave, a staff of investigators is maintained,
and the majority of the delinquents are traced.
They are then brought before the Court and fined, or,
in the more serious cases, sentenced to a term of
imprisonment.
Disciplinary action of this nature required the
greater portion of the time of the Legal Office. In
addition, the Legal Office gives advice to other Sections
of the Council and prepares agreements or other
documents that may require the application of legal
knowledge.
CIVIL ALIENS CORPS.
The Civil Aliens Corps was established in
accordance with the provisions of the National Security
(Aliens Service) Regulations. The main purpose of
these Regulations was that Refugee and Enemy Aliens,
not being citizens in a legal sense and subject to
enrolment in the Forces or the Civil Constructional
Corps, should be called upon to contribute to some
form of service of a national but non-combat character.
Men enrolled in the Civil Aliens Corps were allotted
to Allied Works projects or to Commonwealth and
Stale Government instrumentalities, according to the
urgency of such works and the permissible nature of
such employment.
Those aliens called up for service were subject to
a strict medical examination, and the nature of their
employment was reviewed by the Manpower
Authorities.

The following details show the result of the call-up and examination of aliens throughout Australia to
February 15, 1945.
Those now serving the Corps represent 1% of the
refugees on record and 8.4% of the enemy aliens
or 11.9% of the combined total.
The substantial exemptions on occupational grounds
and the high medical standards, also the lifting of
naturalisation and A.M.F. enlistment restrictions
resulted in the Corps being numerically smaller than
originally contemplated. In addition, it became
necessary to release a considerable number of cane
cutters, etc., for employment in the Sugar Industry in
Queensland.
Approximately one third of the aliens liable for
service have been employed, i.e., 5,297, but with the
normal wastage on medical and other grounds, the
peak employment in the Corps was 3,500.
The acute shortage of firewood for domestic require-
ments in three States was largely solved by the Civil
Aliens Corps —in two years and eight months the
production standing to their credit is nearly 1,000,000
tons.
In one State over half a million super feet of pine
was produced, and in another many thousands of tons
of potatoes dug when other labour was unavailable.
In Western Australia, members were engaged during
the summer on “Control burning” in the forests.
Construction work on the Butler’s Gorge Dam,
Tasmania, is being carried out mainly by the Civil
Aliens Corps on behalf of the Hydro Electric
Commission.
