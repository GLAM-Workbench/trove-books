100 YEARS


OUT GIRILAMBONE WAY
They'll be coming through the Mulga,
and through the Cypress Pine
To celebrate the Birthday
of a famous Copper Mine.
The grandsons of the founders
will gather for the fray.
A hundred years are slipping by
Out Girilambone Way.
They'll motor down the Highway
and some will come by 'plane,
The Boys and Girls of yesterday
are coming home again.
The miners came here walking
and some by horse and dray.
A hundred years have all passed by
Out Girilambone Way.
There'll be a spot of drinking,
and they'll talk of times gone by
They'll swing the picks and shovels
and they'll make the gravel fly.
They'll sing the songs their fathers sang
and dance 'till dawn of day.
A hundred years have come and gone
Out Girilambone Way!
Composed by Noel Doyle of 'Goree' for the Occasion.

FORWARD
Girilambone commenced with the discovery of copper, so it is appro
priate to commence this book with the people who were responsible for
the discovery of that copper for without them there would have been
nothing here except for a temporary navies' camp as the railway went
through.
Thomas Hartman, Charles Campbell and George Gibbs discovered copper
in the Cobar area in 1869 while sinking tanks and bores in the district.
In 1879 they were returning to Cobar by way of Martin Kerz' sawmill on
Dragon Creek and recognised indications of copper.
They took samples on to Cobar, and after tests, were satisfied about the
quality and so returned to establish the Girilambone mine in 1880.
Hartman, Campbell and Gibbs were joined by George Hunter about the
time they moved from Cobar to Girilambone and he and Thomas
Hartman each married one of Charles Campbell's sisters.
With the coming of closer settlement in 1910 coinciding with the decline
in mining activity the town was able to survive, and continues to this day
to provide services to the surrounding community.
This book attempts to record some of the people, places and events of
Girilambone and district, but because of the volume of information and
photographs sent in it is impossible to present it all.
1 hope there is something here for everyone and wish to thank all those
who contributed in any way at all.
1 also wish to congratulate Keith Heckendorf on the completion of a
difficult task in the writing of this book. Keith is particularly interested
in the history of Girilambone and has compiled an interesting collection
of stories, anecdotes, history and photographs.

THE DISCOVERY OF COPPER
Girilambone Copper Refinery (ladling refined copper into ingot moulds).
Girilambone is approximately 380 miles north west of Sydney on the
Sydney-Bourke line.
The name 'Girilambone' is of aboriginal origin, and means a place of
falling stars, and probably has some connection to a fall of meteorites
in the past.
It has been related by old residents of Girilambone that there was a
legend among the aboriginals of a meterorite striking the top of what is
known as 'Trig Hill' near the present township and left a large 'dent' in
it between the Trig Station and the northern end. This event, if true,
must have occurred a considerable time ago.


The old Girilambone mine town is situated about two miles approxi-
mately west of the present site of Girilambone township and came into
being about 1880 when copper was discovered there. There is some
dispute as to the original discoverers of the mine.
It appears that Messrs. Hartman, Campbell and Hunter discovered traces
of copper on the site whilst journeying from the Bogan to Cobar. They
took samples of ore to Cobar in 1879 which proved to be of a payable
nature, and later that year came back and pegged out 4 x 40 acre
mineral conditional purchases, and shortly afterwards commenced to
mine their claims. Their entitlement to the land was then disputed by
the owners of the run - No. 5 - West Bogan, known as 'Grahweed' on
which their claim was located. W.W. & T.L. RICHARDSON, the owners,
claimed prior rights by volunteer land orders, and attested that one of
their employees had drawn his attention to the evidence of copper prior
to Messrs. Hartman, Campbell and Hunter's claim.
It seems that, although the owner of 'Grahweed' knew of the mineral
likelihood in the area first, the other claimants were the first men
responsible for working the site. They, however, were not sufficiently
impressed with the results of their trials, and relinquished their rights to
the claim, rather than dispute it with the original owner of the land.

We are indebted to Mr. I.H. Young, a Geological Surveyor for the first
official records of Girilambone copper mine, and he states:-
"The copper deposit is situated on No. 5 West Bogan Block, near
the North West corner, on a small hill known as 'Copper Hill', and
has a strike of 18N, and dips to the East at an angle of 56°, and
a trench dug across the load 18' wide, shown it to be composed of
veins of Quartz, having between them bands of slate, and
intersliced therein, bunches of very rich red oxide of copper coated
with green carbonate."
and he then goes on to give dimensions and directions of the lode trace
which would only be interesting to an engineer.
In 1883 there were 130 men and boys working the mine until the end of
April, and then 22 workmen only were retained at the mine to sink a new
shaft. The main shaft was sunk to 252’, with the lode varying from 2'
to 15' wide, 450 tons of ore was raised for the year and yielded 32 tons
4 cwt and 1 qr. of fine copper valued at £1,655, with the value of land
put at £7,500, and population at that time was 500.
In 1884, a new shaft was sunk in further search for copper and
apparently ore was struck at 86', 122' and 300'. From 1885 to 1893 the
mine was not worked.
In 1893 it was let on tribute and ore was taken to the value of £957.
In 1894 two or more tributes were let and 36% tons of ore to the value
of £l,lBO was extracted.
During 1895-96 the mine was again idle. In October 1896 the
Girilambone Copper Mining Company Ltd, was formed, and operations
actively pursued. Two hundred men were employed. The main shaft was
deepened to 320' and during 1897 there was 17,154 tons of ore extracted
with an estimated copper content of 733 tons, and which produced 173
tons of refined copper when treated.
The main shaft reached 554' in 1896 but for roughly 125' it ran out of
the lode which had dipped away from the shaft. The main working level
was 300', but another was being driven at 520'. Other working levels
were 140' and 200',
The South Lode was worked from the main shaft by a 140' cross shaft
through which all haulage was made.

of Mines and Agriculture for the Copper - Mining Industry, 1899.
In a report made 28/2/1899, Mr. Blackmore, the Mine Manager, stated
that the main shaft 544' had been properly timbered and divided into
compartments, and little work was done on 360' level, insufficient to
determine the value of the lode. At 300' level, the west drive had been
extended 70' on the course of the lode and south west a new slope
showed malleable copper grey and carbonate ores. A new dam of 6,000
cubic yards was sunk to augment mine supply and old tanks cleaned out.
In 1898 the ores were roughly sorted by hand on the surface and by
screening, and the richer portion went to smelting bins, poor material
was discarded and balance went to ore breaker for jig preparation, and
sulphides direct to Jigs. There were apparently three classes of ore
division at this juncture, being:- Red Oxide and Carbonates from South
Lode, Sulphides from 240' and 300' levels, and Oxides from the zones
between. The Carbonates mined averaged an assay of 4.6% and this
figure was based on average weekly assays. About 40% of this class of
ore was sent direct to smelters, after picking and averaged 13%,
The ore from Girilambone mines is difficult to smelt due to an excess
of sulphur iron, and silica, and these conditions made furnaces suitable.

and Girilambone Copper Mines

bone Mine


The furnaces used were built of Waratah Firebricks, and later locally
made bricks were being made and performed well, and furnace bottoms
were made from the numerous Quartz reefs in the area. Wood was used
for firing, and was carted to the mine by horse teams. The stumps of
trees used for wood at the mine are still in abundance over a wide area
around.
Water was a serious consideration at Girilambone, The mine itself
apparently contributed 40-45,000 gallons a week, which was used for
concentration and passed from jigs to filter dams and then used over and
over. There was no natural water in the vicinity and extra water was
provided by ground dams.
The Girilambone Mine apparently had a rather interrupted career, as it
appears to have only worked in spasms, due to difficult extraction
situations, the rather low grade of the ore, the difficulty of extracting
all ore from tailings, and insecure price of copper.
From 1881 to 1907, 58,408 tons of ore was extracted for a total of 1,141
tons 13 cwt. 1 qr. 191 b. of refined copper. During the latter end of 1907
all work was suspended on the Mine. At this date 7/12/06 the Nominal
Capital of Mine was £50,000 consisting of 100,000 10/- shares. There
were not any shares fully paid up, and 50,000 of them contributed 9/2d.
per share and 50,000 were held in reserve.
There has not been any worthwhile work done at the Mine since 1907
with the exception of some leaching, from which small quantities of
copper were recovered.
There has also been considerable drilling activities in the vicinity but the
results of these efforts are unknown to the writer.
There are also other attempts at recovering minerals in the Girilambone
area with varying degrees of success. Namely at such places as:-
Bonny Dundee -16 m. S.VV. Girilambone 1902-1910, and produced
high grade ore.

SUMMARY OF MINE HISTORY
1881 Company formed to work lodes 6' to 25' wide. 650 tons of
ore was raised from sinking and driving operations.
1882 2,000 tons of ore was raised. The deepest level was at 198’
and lode 6' wide.
1883 New shaft started. Main shaft reached 252', lode to 19'
wide. 450 tons of ore was raised.
1884 Sinking of new shaft continued. Bunches of ore struck at
86', 122' and 300' levels.
1885-1892 No work,
1893 Ore to the value of £957 extracted.
1894 Output was 36 \ tons of copper.
1895 No work.
1896 Girilambone Mining Company formed and main shaft
deepened to 320'.
1897 Extraction was from 100', 200' and 300' levels, and from
the carbonate lode at the south shaft. Lodes reported to
be 15' to 100' across. On the 300' level four men worked
on a lode 30' long and 18' wide. 17,154 tons of ore was
raised. (4.27% cu.)
1898 The main shaft was sunk to 544' and platt cut at the 520'
level. A drive from the south shaft to the main shaft at
140' level was mined and the 300' west drive was extended
70' on lode. Little work was done at the 360' level. On
the 200' level ore was sloped to 25' wide. A new stope was
reported open in the south west drive.
7,948 tons raised to June 30th (5.40% cu.)
6,487 tons raised to December 31st (3.85% cu.)
14,435 tons


Miner's Right 1896.
1899 Difficulties with the smelting and new furnaces were
experienced.
Shaft openings are reported at the 140', 200', 300' and 360'
levels, while driving was started at the 440' and 520'
levels. The widths of the lodes were form 50' to 200', with
dips to the N.E. and strikes N.N.W. and S.S.E.
Production for the half year to December 31st was 943
tons. There is no figure for the first half year production
but because of reports of intermittent production and
smelting difficulties it is assured that this was also 3,000
tons, to give a total for the year of 6,000 tons.
1900 A winze was sunk from the 360' level, apparently to follow
the ore, but at 85' passed into light colour micaeous slate
containing very little copper.
Driving was done to the south east at the 360' level on ore.
An intermediate drive was mined in ore between No. 2 and
No. 3 levels 20' east from the hanging wall on previous
stopes, A south drive was put in 82' on No. 5 level in ore
averaging 5.5%. Much of the year was spent developing at


the 300' and 400' levels to open the sulphide zones. To
June 30th 13,162 tons were treated. No production for the
second half year is available, but several weekly reports
show 40 tons of ore raised per week. Using this as an
average this give a figure of 1,000 tons for the second half
year, and a total of 14,000 tons for the year. However,
because of the wide variation in production for each half
year this figure must be treated with caution,
1901 Considerable work was carried out during the year with
driving and production on all levels down to No. 5 level. It
is reported though that most production came from the
120' and 420' levels and some ore from the open cut.
Production from the south shaft appears to have ceased
early in the year.
Winzing below No. 5 level was carried out. This level is
described as having a defined wall running slightly to north
of west and dipping at 40° to north, which seems to be the
main foot wall of he copper bearing formation.
The face at No. 6 level was started and assayed 3.2%
copper. The No. 4 level southern drive was extended to
100'.
At the end of the year, drought and falling copper prices
appears to be the factors resulting in the closure of the
mine.
No production figures are available for the year, but based
on weekly reports of an average of 100 tons raised per
week, a figure of 5,000 tons can be taken.
1902-1904 No underground production occurred in these years, but
leaching of the tailings was carried out,
1905 Dewatering of the mine was carried out, and some
production was obtained from the south shaft, the open cut
and the No. 1 level. Possibly 1,000 tons was produced.
1906 Dewatering of the mine was completed by February and the
mill and furnaces put in operation. Because of a shortage
of supplies and firewood resulting from heavy rainfall,
operations were intermittent.


The ore treated amounted to 6,035 tons to yield 132 tons
of copper (2.2%).
The areas from which the ore was mined are not recorded.
1907 9.374 tons of ore was raised during the year to obtain
183 tons of copper (2%). The areas the ore was obtained
from are not known.
1908-1909 Mine closed because of low grade.
1910 500 tons of ore raised.
1911-1916 No work,
1917 100 tons mined.
1918 No significant production has since been reported from the
Girilambone mine, though several leaching operations have
been carried out.

THE MINE TOWN CIRCA 1883
There is not very much history available of the business houses in the old
town. It seems that the firm of Sullivan & Willis were the principal
storekeepers and hardware merchants. It is known that the Thorpe boys
were interested in a business there and as far as I can gather, they also
had a butchery. A blacksmith plied his trade in the town, and there
were at least seven hotels. There were several banks, two of which were
the Joint Stock and The Merchantile and both did a thriving business.
A man by the name of Adam Adams also was a storekeeper in
Girilambone in 1883. There were licences granted to Henry Thorpe, J.
Brennan and W. Sullivan as coach licences in the relevant period for the
Old Town, so I presume that was applied to delivery services.
John Ellerton was granted a Hawkers Licence about this time, and as far
as I know, or can ascertain, this licence covered a storekeeper. There
were numerous Afghan Hawkers in the area around the 1880's and 1890's,
and they were also around the district much later, as I myself can
remember Fazel, Been & Fatta Been coming around to "Tiverton" which
Bad (F. Heckendorf) owned around 1920. There were also some Chinese
in the district, and one - Wong Quay - was a market gardener for some
time. There was a Hawkers Vehicle Licence granted to Peter Joseph in
the area too, but I cannot find out any particulars.
Water was one of the greatest problems of the early days, the only
available drinking and general use water available was what ran off the
iron roofs, so that vegetable gardens were at a premium.
The cost of a 200 gal. Iron Tank in 1883 was £ 5/-/-
The cost of a 400 gal. Iron Tank in 1883 was £ 6/-/-
The cost of a 680 gal. Iron Tank in 1883 was £ 9/-/-
The cost of a 1080 gal. Iron Tank in 1883 was £l2/-/-
and the cost of filling a 200 gallon tank from the Bogan - 20 miles away
- was 10/-.
In 1882 four dishes and four drinking pots for the school was quoted at
12/6d. On the basis of the above estimates, £ll-1- a quarter was
allocated to Gidalambone (as it was then known) for the supply of water
to service the needs of a maximum weekly attendance of 91 pupils.


The water problem was later alleviated to some extent at the Mine
Town, by a Government Tank being sunk by horse and dray, down where
the late Sam Ferguson lived, and the Mine itself also constructed water
storage dams, but as these were mainly to service the mines, it did not
help the town position much.
The social side of town life in these days was that which the people
provided themselves. Dancing, dramatics, etc. were indulged in, as well
as private tennis, etc. But the main diversion in the town, apart from
gossiping, were the hotels, and the quantity of liquor consumed by both
sexes of an evening assumed gaugantian proportions, according to old
hands, and as Police control and closing times in those days were
practically non existant, it must have been lively.
Cards were a great diversion in those far off days, and were more
popular than now. It was nearly impossible to find anyone who could not
play 500's, Euchre, Crib, etc.

PRESENT TOWN OF GIRILAMBONE
The present town of Girilambone rose when the Railway Line came
through in 1883. Although its growth was not very evident for some
time, it was the Railhead. When the mine began losing ground about
1898, and the school and police station, etc. were built at the Railhead,
the businesses in the Old Town began to creep across the Line.
New Girilambone was a flourishing little village after about 1909 when
the mine closed.
The Police Station was built on its present site, and was an active
station until the early 1970'5. There was a Petty Sessional Court held
there with the local J.P.'s in attendance, and staffed by a list of officers
which I have recorded elsewhere. About 1974 the station was closed and
the patrol of the district taken over by Coolabah and Nyngan police.
The Railway also was a more evident utility in earlier years than it is
now. The advent of modern cars was the end of the "Iron Horse". I can
very well remember the days when it was far more reliable to go to
Nyngan by train than trust to a car with the bush track meandering
through the trees, and eight gates to be negotiated. It was not until
many years afterwards that the Bourke Road was even graded.
I think that Joe Power was probably the first storekeeper in Girilambone,
and he was evidently a man of strong character, and most likeable man.
He was rather well known for his leniency with the local pastoralists and
their accounts in time of drought.
Then both Thorpes and McKinnons had a hand in the business of
Girilambone in stores and hotels respectively. Jack Elletson ran a
business in the main street, (Bourke St.) and Larsens conducted a General
Store where the present one is now situated, whilst the Dickers had a
store where the old bakers shop is.
Donald Bradshaw took over from the Larsens as storekeeper and thence
it was taken over by A.V. Dicker and his sons who conducted it until
about the 1960'5. Charlie Dicker, second son of Vern and Ida Dicker, was
Baker in the town for some time. Les Dicker, another son of Vern
conducted the store until his retirement in the 1960'5. It has since been
under the management of Brian and Lorraine Smith. Vern Dicker married
Ida Power.


Old Town
There was a Blacksmith operating near the bottom crossing in the early
days, and as far as I know, was conducted by one of the Ryans. Charles
Day Dicker was operating a Blacksmith shop in 1905. Charlie Eldridge
conducted a Coachbuilders concern near where Mat Ryan has his home
now.
Harry Robinson's Fruit Shop was sited where the present Post Office is,
and Maggie Payne had a Green Grocery and Tea Shop where Donnellys
live at present.
The School of Arts Hall was built about 1908, and renewed in 1932 and
was the venue of all the travelling concerts and entertainers, as well as
holding dances and balls regularly. Bill Butler assures me that it was
used as a skating rink from 1908 for some years.
The Girilambone R.S.L. Club was established about 1954/5 and was
convened as a civic club as well. It is a well appointed, air conditioned
building, with ballroom and adequate lounges, etc. with an outside
barbeque. It takes the place of the School of Arts, which has been
condemned as a public building, and the Club also serves the drinking
needs of the town.


Village of Girilambone today.


The Girilambone Hotel, laterly called the "Thirst Quencher" has now
been closed down. Its licence has been transferred to another site
outside the district, and it looks as if the old Hotel is finished. It is a
pity that so essential a part of the town has been lost, probably for ever.
Girilambone has had a Cricket Club for about the last 60 years. I have
given some details of it elsewhere.
The Tennis Club is still in existence, and tennis was first played in
Girilambone about 100 years ago. The courts were moved several times,
but are now located adjacent to the C.W.A. Memorial Park in front of
the R.S.L. Club.
A Rifle Club was inaugurated in 1916, and with few exceptions has
functioned ever since.
A Pistol Club is now nearing completion on the adjacent common, and
will be in operation before the Centenary Celebrations in October of this
year 1980.
Girilambone Branch of the Red Cross was started in the early days of
the 1914-18 War, and with a brief break, continues to this day. The
C.W.A. is still a presence in the town and district after its inauguration
in 1923 by the late Mrs. A.P. Douglas of "Goree".
Girilambone had a race course and Jockey Club from the early days until
the 50's but it has not been revived since then.
It was not until the latter half of the century that Girilambone had a
town water supply. Prior to this the population had to rely on rain water
tanks. Electricity came to the town in the late 50's also, and was
brought here by the Macquarie Valley Bulk Supply.
The old Cemetery behind the Trig Hill is no longer in use, and now
occupies a site on the Brewarrina Road, east of the town. Helen Kerz,
who was one of the victims of the Erelong Massacre, was the first person
buried there.
When J. Hartman had the Hotel in Girilambone, he lived in a house on
the corner of the street between the Hotel and Store, it was used
afterwards as a Billiard Saloon, and then I believe Ken MacKinnon lived
in it for a while. The Old Railway Hotel was burnt down in 1932, and
rebuilt.


Girilambone has, like most other small towns in the country, seen the
heyday of its life. When I was a boy, the district would gather for
supplies on Saturday, both to live on and drink, and there was nearly
always something on on Saturday night. Everybody would be in town and
it was a break for the week and was much enjoyed. With the advent of
motor transport and good roads, and more particularly the Saturday
closing, these times were lost.
LOCAL GOVERNMENT

Local Councillor and J.P.
When the mines were discovered in 1879, there was no town of
Girilambone, and consequently no Local Government. There was not at
this stage any Council sitting at Nyngan (Nyngan did not exist to any
extent then). Nor was there any Bogan Shire, as the Shire was not
inaugurated until 1905. The Mine Town and later the Railway Town on
its present site, was on Private Property at this time, and consequently
the towns could be justly described as being the property of the Mine
Owners.


There was some Police Jurisdiction over the Mine Town, which came
within the framework of the Police Offences Act, and this area was
bounded by approximately Railway Road, Great Northern Road, and
Australia Parade, to the railway line.
As there was not any Police Station within the area, the protection of
Town, etc., relied on Troopers from either Canonbar or Bourke. Then on
9th December, 1905 the Bogan Shire was formed and this Shire embraced
all the land and towns around the area for rating purposes, etc. also as
a Police district.
The first Council was a temporary one, whose duty it was to prepare
lists and rolls of electors, etc, and make all ready for the election of
first Council. This first temporary Council consisted of A.J.L.
Flashman, F.B. Bloomfield, J.K. Doyle, J.E. Griffiths and Ken Murchison.
When the early preparatory work was done by the above, it resulted in
the election of the first official Bogan Shire Council who consisted of:-
Scott - President
Smith
Griffiths
Robinson
Frey
Ist Shire Clerk
G.C. Shaw
Ist Engineer
J.L. Norman
Girilambone and its environs then came under the Shire jurisdiction and
has remained ever since.

HERE IS A CLIPPING FROM THE SYDNEY MAIL
18th MARCH, 1882:-
GIRILAMBONE
MARCH 11.
Few, doubtless, of the readers of the Mail have even heard of
this, one of the latest and most promising of New South Wales
townships. Twelve months back and Girilambone as a town was
unknown, the name being significant but to a blackfellow, in whose
lingo it stood, and for aught I know now stands, for "the morning
star."
Some 18 months back good prospects of copper were discovered,
on the run of Mr. T.G. Richardson, known as Murrowombie. A
company has since been formed to work what has proved to be a
rich mine, and already some £IOOO or £I2OO are monthly paid in
wages, although no smelting is going on the furnaces being only in
course of erection. The ore is said to be very rich, and what goes
far to prove the assertion is that for some time no shares have
been in the market, holders being willing only to part at a very
considerable premium.
Then, too, Girilambone is on the main line of railway now in
course of construction from Nyngan to Bourke, and the head-
quarters of the contractors is only two miles from the township.
The firm of Mann, Carey and Co. secured the contract, and already
the work of clearing the line, cutting, fencing, &c ~ is going rapidly
ahead.
I have seen many towns in their infancy in this and other
colonies, but I never yet saw one with more signs of healthy
vitality than this same Jerry-lamb-bone as the unsophisticated
miners pronounce it.
During the last month two banks have opened here the Joint
Stock and the Mercantile, and judging from the cheeriness of the
bank managers' faces, business is by no means dull. Then we boast
of two hotels, both quite equal to ordinary country hotels, and
superior to. a very great many of your Sydney houses that I wot of.
The early closing law does not affect us much, as there are no
police stationed here, although no doubt before long we shall boast
our trooper, or perhaps two.
What we want more than police and more than a parson even, is
rain. Water, until a few weeks back, when a few inches of rain
fell, was quoted at 2s 6d per cask, and if we do not have more
within a week or ten days, the same quotation will rule again.


There is plenty of provision made to hold rain when it comes, but
you must catch your hare before you cook him
The store of Sullivan, Willis, and Co. is the great centre of
business, it being to all intents and purposes the Exchange of the
city. Pay-day is a great day here, and the amount of liquor
imbibed per male adult (and in some cases you may fairly throw in
a female or two) must entitle Girilambone to be ranked as a good
revenue producing township.
Despite the want of water grass is plentiful around here, and
after coaching it from Dubbo to Nyngan, one cannot but feel
relieved at the sight of a little verdure after a lot of desert.

Larsen.

HOTELS
There were at least seven hotels and wine saloons at the Old Mine Town,
and they were flourishing concerns until the closure of the Mines and the
Railway coming through, caused most businesses to shift to the new
Town.
There was the;-
Royal Hotel
Carriers Arms
Club House
Federal Hotel
Great Western
Giralambone
Victoria
and then there were several wine saloons, mainly for the benefit of the
camps serving the Railway line which was being built.
The licencee for the Hotels were as follows;-
Royal Hotel 1881/1882 J. McDonald
1883/1886 G. Buist
1887 No Record

When Cobb & Co. coaches were the only service between Sydney and
Bourke, a Hotel and Resting House was usually built every 20 to 30 miles
for refreshments, rest and facilities for a change of horses, and there
were Hotels both at Duck Creek, near where "Carlton" Station now
stands ("Carlton" is built with remains of stone used in old Hotel
Building), and another near Monkey Bridge. There is not much to show
where these then thriving houses stood, except for a few bricks and
broken bottles. However, in their heyday, and before the Railway took
the place of coach passenger and goods services, they were well
patronised and very popular places.

A blackfellow was shot at the Halfway Hotel at Duck Creek in March.
1894, but for what reason, and who shot him, I have no record.. The
original Licencee for the Halfway Hotel was Laars Larsen who was born
in Copenhagan, Denmark and came to Australia in the 1860's and
married Emily Hammond. They were the parents of Tom, Ted, Will,
Larry, Jack, Mary, Annie, and Fan Larsen.
About 1873 Laars Larsen and his wife took over the Halfway House at
Duck Creek, Licencees of which were:-

John Lamph arrived in Australia in 1820 and after a colourful career
settled near Bream Creek about 1835 and married Miss Sarah Peck.
Robert Lamph was a son of John and Sarah, and was born on 26th
February, 1829. He married Rebecca Young in 1854 and came to
Merryanbone, thence to the Canonba Hotel for a short while, after which
he took up the Elmswood Hotel at Monkey Bridge in 1871, and it was
held by him and his wife until 1895.
Robert and Rebecca Lamph are the parents of Llew Lamph who married
Ann Gibson. Llew lives at present on "Karingal" Station, Girilambone.
His son John lives at the old home also, with his wife Mary and their two
children.

REMINISCENCES
Back in the early 1920's when Alec MacKinnon (Flora Dicker's father)
owned the Girilambone Hotel, and was renowned as a practical joker,
comes the tale of one of his pranks.
Willie Wong, the Chinaman from Wilga Downs, would ride his bay horse
into Girilambone, and after hobbling and belling it. would get down to
some solid drinking at the Pub. One night, when Willie was in the
clouds, Alec went down to the horse with a bucket of whitewash and a
big brush, and changed the horse's colour.
Old Willie subsequently could only find a white horse, and eventually
walked back to Wilga Downs rather than take another's horse, as no one
could convince him that the white one was his.
Mrs. Flora Dicker.
Bill Butler tells of the time when, at one of the Coaching Houses, a
Chinaman was on the hops inside, and had left his horse and cart outside.
Some of the local wags took the horse out of the shalves, pushed them
(the shalves) through a wire fence, and then put the horse back in, with
horse on one side of fence and cart on the other.
The Chinaman eventually came out, and saw the position, for which he
apparently blamed the horse. He picked up a ruddy great waddy off the
woodheap, climbed up in the cart, and fetched the neddy a whollop
across the butt of the tail. The horse took off, spinning all four wheels
of course, took the fence with the cart, collected the copper belonging
to the laundry as well as one side of the said laundry, took the other side
garden fence, as well as giving the laundress in the building hysterics.
The practical jokers were splitting their sides laughing but were a bit
premature, because the local policeman saw the whole thing.
It was a rebounding joke said Bill, because it took the wags two years
to pay John Chinaman and the Publican's laundry bill at £2 a week.


RAILWAY
The railway line which came to Nyngan in 1883, extended on to
Girilambone and beyond in 1883/4. The town of Girilambone at that
time was situated where the Copper Mine is located, but gradually was
shifted from there to its present site, with the advent of rail facilities
and a cessation of activities at the mine.
The advent of rail facilities to Bourke was mooted as early as 1873,
when the then Secretary of Works, Mr. J. Sutherland, suggested several
routes on the map which he requested Chief Engineer, Mr. Whitton to
report on.
The earliest suggestion of the Line was from Orange through Parkes
district to the Darling River, which would have passed to the west of
Nyngan. . Then another suggestion would have had it go via Canonba,
Warren, etc. but the low,lying country was the greatest deterrent to this
route.

the right of the picture. Until its removal in the 1950's to the Orange area, it was the last
of its type operating in N.S.W.


The present route via Dubbo, Nevertire, etc. was approved in 1875. Two
hundred and twenty two miles of the Line was approved in 1880, and one
hundred miles were pegged out so that tenders could be invited. This
length - from Dubbo to Nyngan - was let to A. & R. Amos, and was to
be completed by 1882 and subsequently extended to. 1883, and finally
finished on 9th June, 1883 after a reward of £9,000 was offered by the
Government and Cobar Copper Mine for effort put into it.
Tender for the Nyngan-Bourke section was let to George Mann & Co. and
the line reached Bourke on sth September, 1885. Girilambone began rail
services about the end of 1883.
The earliest telegraphic facilities were handled by the Railways before
the Post Offices took over that duty.

THE GIRILAMBONE POST OFFICE
The telegraphic communications for the district were handled by the
Railway Department, and then taken over by a separate Post Office
about 1908. It is again difficult to obtain the earlier attendants to the
office, but it appears than the Larsens were one of the earliest and then
Mrs. Mankin and Ivy Millican.
Mrs Hullick was Postal Mistress to 1921 followed by:-
William Thorpe 1921/24
Mick Grady 1924/25
John Travers 1926/27
Then came the marathon career of Cecil Grady, which I believe is a
record for a country office. He held the post from 9/12/27 to 20/10/76.
Mr. C. Grady was honoured for his services as postmaster, with the
British Empire Medal, after his retirement, he passed away on August
29th, 1980. Charles Dicker then took charge on 21/10/76 up to the
present.

SCHOOL FACILITIES AT GIRILAMBONE
An early photo of the school.
About 1880 a private Township was formed at the site of the
Girilambone Copper Mine, which was situated on the North Western
corner of West Bogan No. 5 Run, which was owned by W.W. & T.L.
Richardson, and was then part of "Grahweed" Station which comprised
some 91,600 acres.
In that period - 1880/1882 - there were some 500 or more inhabitants
living in the Village, of which number, some 100 or more were children.
This naturally led to a very definite need for further schooling facitilies,
because it was evident from earliest reports that the majority of women
had to instruct their own children, and under the primitive conditions
that then existed, it was more than difficult.
As the number of children increased there was a movement set in motion
to get Government assistance in the nature of a Public School and after
a number of meetings a definite application was submitted to the
Director of Public Instructions for the school to be approved, and this
approval was received on 18/1/1882.


From the rather sketchy material I have been able to obtain on the
matter, the people prominent in the establishment of Girilambone's first
school were - W. Datson, M. Kerz, T, Readford, J. King and J.
McDonald, and their efforts resulted in a school consisting of a 40' x 20'
tent, approved on a block at the corner of Louisa Street and Rue
d'Enfer, covering some 20 square chains in area.
The first teacher at this school was a Mr. F. Phillips, appointed on
4/4/1882. From the notes made available by the earlier settlers,
conditions were very hard. For some time water was a problem at the
school, it having to be carted from the Bogan, some 20 miles away, so
that hand basins for washing, etc. were only a dream, and in most cases
drinking water had to be carried to the school by the pupils in bottles
from home. Ten shillings was the cost of 200 gallons of water at this
time, and it was expected to last three weeks. So that with a top
attendance of 91 pupils, there would not be many water fights!
The enrolment at the new school varied a little at the beginning and
from 14th July, 1882 to 24th August, 1882, the attendance fluctuated
between 52 (23 boys and 29 girls) to a top of 91 (40 boys and 51 girls).
The earliest teachers that I have been able to note were Mr. Phillips, Mr.
Samuel, Mr. Donohoe and I think, Mr. Sullivan who instructed the hopeful
until the opening of the school at the new Railway Town of Girilambone.
These early teachers were assisted by a Mrs. Datson, Sewing Instructor,
and also by Ellen Kerz who was appointed an assistant teacher on
11/12/1894.
In 1897 a new school was erected in Girilambone on a Block bounded by
Wilga, Vega, Mulga and Procyon Streets, and known as the "Bark Hut".
The new teacher in charge - 1897/1898 - was Mr. Beatty.
This school served the educational purposes of Girilambone until the
erection of the present school, which with renovations, etc. is still a
primary school. As far as I can gather, the present school was opened
about 1913.
The school at Girilambone is still functioning as a Primary School, and
secondary education is served by a daily school bus to Nyngan High
School.

tent, pupils were obliged to bring their own water in bottles, so said a ministerial decision. Finally,
after considerable haggling back and forward, the request for a water tank, wash stand, dishes and
drinking mugs was granted.

THE GIRILAMBONE "EMPIRE DAY" SCHOOL PICNIC
When I was a child attending a Subsidised School at my home in the
Girilambone District, 1910-1914, the High Light of our School year
was the Empire Day School Picnic held on the 24th of May in
Honour of Queen Victoria's Birthday. All the surrounding schools
with their Governesses were invited to attend this Annual Event
and what a day it was and how much it was talked about and
looked forward to for weeks beforehand. The Picnic was mostly
held on the Race Course which was about half a mile from the
school and after assembling at the school the children were then
marched this distance, each one carrying their own "mug", usually
white enamel. Families came for miles in Horse drawn Buggies,
Sulkies and on Horse back. The Fathers of the families very rarely
came to the Picnic as they were either too busy or considered this
day only for Mothers and Children. The Mother or the eldest child
usually drove the vehicle all happy and laughing and dressed in
their Best clothes. Early on the morning of this great day some
of the men folk who lived close by would gather branches of the
Gum Trees and lay them to form a large circle on the ground. This
was used then for the children to sit on to have their Picnic meal.
Cases of oranges and apples were in generous supply as were also
scones, home made biscuits and cakes, all seeming so much more
delicious eating with other children and out in the open. One
wor.ian in particular stays very closely in my mind, a Mrs Milliken,
who was always very much to the fore and I can seem to hear her
now as she served the children saying "Plenty to eat and nothing
to waste!" Races were run and games were played and much talk
was indulged in amongst the women folk who often had not seen
another woman to talk to for weeks.
The families who came on horses or horse-drawn vehicles could not
stay for the Bon Fire at night as they had to be home before dark.
No one minded this though as events like the Girilambone Empire
Day Picnic were few and far between and all were happy to have
had such a wonderful day out and been part of the Empire Day
Picnic.
Another couple worthy of mention as helpers on that day were Mr
and Mrs Harry Robinson, grandparents of Mr Ray Payne. These
people were always willing helpers as I remember very well.


THE GIRILAMBONE POLICE STATION
Police Station 1906 with Trooper Parkes in front.
The first police representative to serve in the Girilambone area began in
about 1896, when one mounted Officer was stationed there.
This same year a 1 acre site was reserved in the Town for a "Police
Station and Lockup", but was not built until 1899, at a then cost
of £B4B/-/-. A separate two stall stable and forage room also stood
adjacent. Prior to this date the Resident Officer appeared to live in
rented premises.
An additional foot Constable was attached to Girilambone in 1899, as the
Girilambone Copper Mining Co. employed a large number of men, but by
1901 the number had again been restored to one Officer, and remained
thus for the remainder of the Station's life.
About 1922, a 42% acre Police Paddock was reserved for the Police
horses, and was active until about 1955 when the advent of motor
vehicles took the place of horses for Police work.


Police Officers in attendance at Girilambone are as follows:-
J. Placker E. Simpson
P. Dedman W. Holmes
Kendall M. Bruce
Parks A. Bird
McDonald C. Swilks
Cunningham N. Wall
Stanton H. Browne
Honeysett F. McEvoy
J. Townsend B. Hay
R. Turner ' R. Clark
In 1975 the Station was closed, and patrolling carried out from Coolabah
and Nyngan.
UNION CHURCH
The spread of Protestantism in the very early days, as in all religions,
was somewhat slow, and difficult, owing to great distances and lack of
transport. The first effort at establishing any sort of Christian contact
with the various outposts was largely by lay preachers.
The first services of the Union Church in Girilambone Mine Town were
held under a tree about 1882 and gradually contacted a congregation
large enough to rent a building from Mr. Kerz. Brothers Bartley and
Spargo from Clunes in Victoria were the first two lay preachers to
organise the Church to any extent.
Eventually the Company was approached for a building site, and a corner
block was approved, and a building 40' x 20' decided on. Unfortunately
change of progress at the Mine resulted in the building reduced to 19'
x 22' at a cost of £ 125. Eleven members lent £lO each for immediate
erection, and were repaid as funds came forward.
The building was of weatherboard and iron with gothic windows at sides
and end.


The Rev. J.A. Bowring was the first Methodist to preach in the newly
erected Church and came over from Cobar on horseback for the purpose.
There were three services on the Sunday when the Church was dedicated,
and about 30 people attended each time.
I am not certain when the new Church was built in Girilambone Railway
Town, but have an idea that it was aobut 1912. Amongst those who were
active in the new Church were Messrs. McDonald, Elletson, Phillips,
Dicker, Millikin, Deris, Robertson, J. & F. Heckendorf, Davis, Beggs.
The Rev. J. Thomson was Minister at the first Union Church. The writer
was christened by the Rev. Mannerfield at "Tiverton" in 1916, and can
well remember that gentleman, and the Rev. Biddle going their rounds
of the properties in a horse and sulky. ,
The present Minister is Pastor Browne of Nyngan.
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
The Catholic Church, like the other Denominations in the Back Country,
met with many difficulties in the beginning, due to long distances and
the lack of transport.
The first men who conducted their calling in the district had as their
headquarters, Bathurst, and the needs of the whole of the West was
carried out from there. Later the Priests of the Parish at Bourke took
care of the district to Nyngan. They used pack horses in the early days,
and were often months on patrol.
Some of the earliest Priests were Fathers Martin Long, Curran, P. Shore,
Colemen Carey. Then Father Peter Tracey was Parish Priest from 1898
to 1904 and then was replaced by Rev. Father Moran who was in charge
of the district until 1931. I, myself remember Father Moran doing his
rounds in his buggy drawn by two ponies and he would call on everybody
irrespective of their creed and was a most respected man by all. His
lively presence, and cheerful wit was much appreciated.
Like the Ministers of all denominations, these men all kept in contact
with their members in spite of great difficulties, and were just as much
instrumental in opening up the districts as anyone else.


THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND
Before 1870 the only Church of England in the Back Country was at
Dubbo.
The Rev. F.S. Boyce set out in 1870 to proceed to Bourke and investigate
the suitability of building churches at the various Back Country centres,
and passed through Dandaloo, Buddabadah, Mudall, etc. enroute to that
Town, after noting that at this date 1870, there was only a hut on the
present site of Nyngan. he subsequently purchased land at Gongolgon,
Brewarrina, Bourke and Cobar on which to build churches.
In 1889, after the railway line had brought Nyngan into being, a Church
was established there, and from which the Rector used horse and sulky
to hold services at such places as Girilambone, Hermidale, etc. After
the 1914-18 War, a motor bike was used to visit the scattered flock and
a T Ford about 1925.
The first Church of England to be built in Girilambone was St. Pauls and
held its first service on 30th August, 1925. This Church was originally
a shop in Cobar and was built of corrugated iron and lined with Cyprus
pine.
Although the Church was not built until 1925, the Register at Warren
shows that services were held in Girilambone as early as 1882, both in
the Mine Town and in the Railway Camp adjacent to the present town.
Father Knowles is the present Minister.
Girilambone R.S.L. Civic Club in 1980.


THE R.S.L. CLUB
The R.S.L. Club was first envisaged about 1950. For a year or so
negotiations were carried on for land on which to build. This was finally
allotted to the Club where it stands at present. This land was originally
intended for a Post Office.
The first part of the Club comprising lobby, bar and one room was built
by Howell Bros, of Nyngan, and the Charter was received from D.T.
Curry, who was an R.S.L. Conciller, in December, 1954, The Club was
opened by Sir John Northcott on 3rd September, 1955. The addition of
Lounge, Billiard Room and Kitchen followed about 1957/58.
The original lighting in the Club was supplied by its own generator,
which also supplied the School fo Arts, but is now, of course hooked up
to the Bulk Electricity Supply.
Now that the hotel is closed, the Club is the only bar in the town, and
has a very wide membership. It is run as a Co-operative concern at the
present time.
The original membership of the Sub-Branch Club was 24 members, but
the toll of years has reduced the numbers considerably, and it has now
been dissolved.
Some of the original Sub-Branch Members were:-
Edwin Larsen Noel Doyle
Joe Ferguson Max Johnson
Chas Dicker Harry Fitzgerald
Jos Skinner Ray Spicer
Dib Crompton Paddy Cottee
John Crompton Jim Begg
Sid Hayes (School Teacher) George Mankin
Joe Heckendorf George Egan
Ron Maguire George Bartley
Alan Moxham Jack Phelps


GIRILAMBONE BRANCH RED CROSS
The Girilambone Branch of the Red Cross was formed on 30th November,
1914 and continued to function until 1918 thus assisting International
Red Cross through the 1914-1918 War.
The Branch was reformed on 22nd September, 1934, and has been an
active Branch ever since - raising many thousands of dollars to assist
Red Cross commitments round the world. As well as fund raising and
activities required during war time, the Branch has helped local families
in difficult times, and since 1968 the members have assisted Nyngan
Branch with the Mobile Blood Bank.
The names of many loyal and hard working members appear as one reads
through the Branch records and it would be impossible to mention them
all. We remember Mrs. Sophia Heckendorf who conducted her Oppor-
tunity Shop from the Second World War until her death in 1967 and which
was then taken over by Mrs. Grace Gibson, a Life Member, who
continued with it until her death in 1971.
Mrs Sophia Heckendorf who ran the Opportunity
Shop 1942-1967.


A list of long serving office bearers, included among which would be,
Mrs. Charlie Dicker, who was Branch Treasurer for 10 consecutive years
and Mrs. Tony Lodge, who was Secretary for 11 years. Mrs. Harry
Skinner, Mrs. George Gibson Jnr. and Mrs. Llew Lamph, all gave so much
of their time and effort to the Red Cross. However, our longest serving
member in the Branch is Miss Isabel Larsen, our present Publicity
Officer, who is now in her 14th year of Office, being elected to the
position in 1966.
The present Girilambone Branch has 28 Financial Members, and meets
every second month. Present President is Mrs. David Doyle, Secretary,
Mrs. George Gibson Jnr., and Mrs. John Lamph is Treasurer.
C.W.A.
The Country Women's Association was started in Crookweli, N.S.W. on
26th April, 1922. Only one year later, thanks to the efforts of Mrs. A.P.
Douglas of "Goree", Girilambone Branch was formed in 1923 with 38
members.
Foundation President was Mrs. John Davison of "Nealy" and Sec-
retary/Treasurer was Miss Anne Gibson (later to become Mrs. Llew
Lamph).
Meetings were held in the School of Arts Hall and occasional meetings
were conducted in the homes of members to add variety. In 1924 Mrs.
Davison was again President, her daughter Millie was Secretary and Mrs.
A. Payne the Treasurer.
The Branch went into recess in 1927 until 1930. In 1931 it was re-
opened with 17 members. Mrs. Ted Larsen, President, Miss Belle Gibson
Secretary and Mrs, George Gibson Treasurer. Mrs Gibson is still an
active member of Nyngan C.W.A.
During the war years, members knitted socks for the Lord Mayor's Fund,
and food hampers were sent regularly to "The Boys" overseas.


C.W.A. Memorial Gates erected in 1951.
1951 saw a C.W.A. playground opened with swings and park equipment.
This park is used continuously and still upkept by the Branch. Memorial
Gates were erected with C.W.A. finance and the R.S.L. later had a
Cenotaph erected. This is the scene of all our Anzac Day Com-
memorative Services.
The C.W.A. Christmas Tree has been the main local charity. It was
commenced in the early 1930’s and has continued ever since. In latter
years it has been held in conjunction with the R.S.L. Club. All district
children receive beautiful gifts from Santa Claus, and everyone shares a
high tea in a party atmosphere.
Hopefully we can continue with this and the other charitable work of
gifts to senior citizens and books to the school library, as well as
generally contributing to the social life of the ladies of the district.
Long live C.W.A.


CRICKET
Although the first cricket team was established at the Old Mine Town
in the late 1880's, there is very little detail available about it now. The
Thorpe and McKinnon boys were very enthusiastic and capable players in
those days, and it is certain that many more were outstanding, but we
lack records.
«T
The earliest data of any note on Girilambone cricketers comes from
George Gibson Snr. who reports his first game with the Girilambone XI
in 1920 when he was 16. Girilambone played the Nealy Station shearers
team which included the Davison boys and some good men from Bathurst,
among them being fast bowler Arther Dempsey. "Needless to add", says
George, "We got a lacing, my contribution being a duck!" Girilambone
Captain at that time was Vic Cousens, the local Station Master.
Around this period, George mentions such players as Jack and Leo
Davison, Horace Ireland, Bill and Harry Thorpe, and "Bowler" Egan.
George reports that the first bat he had was made of dried kurrajong,
and the first match he played in after some practice was against
Coolabah and included such players as Bob Bundle, Bobby Burns, Herb
Cooney and Charlie Hall. The Girilambone team won by an innings and
George took 6 wickets for 9 runs, and Sam Payne took 7 for 23 in the
second innings.
Girilambone Cricket Team, 1941. Standing:- Bob Gibson, ...,
Frank Davison, Ray Payne,... , Tom Davison, Bill Ferguson. Sitting:-
Jack Vigors, Ron Larsen, Ted Mac Alpine, Dal Page, George Gibson Snr.


George also mentions the match against Nyngan for the Toohey Cup.
Nyngan team which included Cec. Roberts, Dr. Forbes, Harold Cleaver,
Bill Butler and Eddie Grigg, was out first innings for 80 odd runs. George
and Sam Payne went in 9th and 10th wicket and Girilambone needed 50
runs to win. Sam made 37 n.o. and George, after 3 fours in succession
made 17. However, on the return match, Bill and Eddie went through
the Girilambone team like a dose of salts.
Players who made their mark in the Girilambone team were Ray and
Harry Payne, Eddie and Ron Larsen, Jack Gibson and the Davison boys
who played in this team for some years. Beasley, Bill Mitchell, Leo
Tolhurst, Frank Martin were all in the Girilambone team. Ted McAlpine,
the school teacher, was a great allrounder, and Dal Page's splendid
innings of 167 n.o. against Coolabah is still remembered. The highest
score Girilambone put up was 5 for 560 against Byrock, in which D.
McKinnon, -. Beasley and the Gibson boys put up high scores. John
Leggett, G. Gibson Jnr. played for Girilambone in later years, and the
mighty Harry Brown put Girilambone cricket on the map. The
Girilambone team played competition cricket until several years ago.
Tennis Party C. 1906. As far as can be ascertained the people shown are all members of the
Hunter family from L to R:- George, Harley, Olivia (Mrs G.), Sam. Laura (Mrs Larsen). Eliza
(Mrs C.) and Carl Hunter.


PASTORAL - 1834
Fencers and Farm Hands 4/- to 5/- weekly and found Rations weekly:-
10lb. flour
10lb. meat
2oz. tea
lib. sugar
2oz. tobacco
2oz. salt
2oz. soap
7qrt. milk
Milk was given in this quantity in lieu of tea and sugar.
This ration was considered to be better than the keep generally provided
by the people in their own homes, as in most cases the labourers were
convicts, and the constant emphasis by employers to labourers was on
striving to better oneself, as apparently the better a labourer behaved,
the better the quality and quantity of rations he was entitled to.
Wages to servants in the home was £5O to £6O plus rations for those in
a supervisory position, and £2O to £25 for those in a more humble
position, and if a wife helped in a home, the husband received a higher
wage.
Children and wife of an employee received rations from the employer.
Useful recipe for scab in sheep 1835;-
llb. quicksilver
hlb. Venice Turps
2oz. Spirits Turps
Work these ingredients together thoroughly for at least 6 hours
until Mercury is thoroughly incorporated and globules of
quicksilver are invisible when rubbed on paper. Then take 4lb.
of hogs fat and melt over a slow fire and when milk warm, add
it to previous (quicksilver) mixture and stir until cold.


Pastoral Statistics 1861 - 1901:-
Sheep 1861 - 6 million
" 187 5 - 25 million
” 1 877 - 4 million lost (drought)
" 1883 - 40 million
" 1891 - 62 million
Drought and Depression reduced the number to 36 million by 1899. Major
drought in 1902 reduced numbers to 27 million. Hence gain in 25 years
was lost in 6. Half a century went by before the 1891 numbers were
regained, owing to the invasion of introduced rabbits, and the sub-
stantially reduced carrying capacity which they caused. Indeed, it was
not until after the introduction of Myxomatosis into the rabbit
population that the stock numbers regained that which were in evidence
before the rabbit invasion began in the 1890's.
Average rainfall 1602 points for district
Lowest rainfall 563 points 1888
Highest rainfall 3878 points 1950
WEST BOGAN PASTORAL COUNTRY 1857
All the pastoral Country on the west side of the Bogan was surveyed into
Blocks (called "Runs") with a 5 mile frontage to the River, and extended
outwards for 15 miles. From Nyngan to Monkey Bridge, there were 10
of these "Runs", and the original selectors, as far as I can ascertain,
were:-
No. 1 G. Labelliere - 47,000 ac.
No. 2 J. Penzer and W. Gardner - 46,000 ac.
No. 3 J. Aarons - 46,000 ac.
No. 4 H.W. & A. Thompson
No. 5 In 1865 H.E. Holland
No. 6 J. Neal
No. 7 Lynch & Neil
No. 8 )
No. 9 Hall Family ) "Willaroon"
No. 10 )
Later in the 19th century, these "Runs" changed hands to some extent.
John Foster took over No. 6 from J. Neal, which was called "Nealy" and
was about 50,000 acres.


West Bogan Runs, Nos. 1 to 9, mid 1880's.


"Nealy" eventually was owned by Foster and Davison, and continued
under their ownership until all these "Runs" came up for closer
settlement about 1910. Even after this date, a portion of "Nealy"
continued under the former owners until recently.
In 1879 we find that both No. 4 and 5 were owned by the Richardsons
and was known as "Grahweed".
The country on the western side of these 10 "Runs" was "Wilga Downs",
owned by Goldsborough. All the country from Nyngan to Monkey Bridge
and out to Hermidale, about 800,000 acres, was five properties. It is on
Richardsons No. 5 block that Girilambone, both old and new, was
situated. The late Mick Fitzgerald was related to the Neals who original
owned "Nealy". His mother was a Miss Neal. The name of "Nealy" was
supposed to have reference to teal ducks which inhabited the gilgais
around the old homestead, but it appears more likely to be a corruption
of the original owner - Neal.
REMINISCENCES
The highest temperature I can remember at "Glenlea" (where I
passed my young days) was 128°F. and it was never under 100°F.
at night for three weeks. This was in 1938. There were quite a
few of the older people who died during this heatwave.
There is some controversy as to who had the first motor car in the
Girilambone district. Apparently three men - J. Davison "Nealy",
J. Lamph "Glenormiston", and F. Heckendorf "Tiverton" hod autos
about the same time - around 1912/15. F. Heckendorf had a 1910
model Carnation which was the only one of this make that 1 have
ever heard of. He bought it second hand and did not have it before
1912/14.
The old hands assure me that the Green Blowfly appeared about
1906 and was believed to have been imported from America.
Foxes appeared in the area about 1906, as prior to this time all the
ground nesting birds such as Curlews, parrots, several kinds of
larks, etc. were in abundance, also Kangaroo Mice, Bandicoots
(Flash Jacks), Wallabies, Wild Turkeys. All these birds and animals
were virtually extinct in the district 4 to 5 years after the fox
came.


Part of County Cambelego, 1909. Note that the sub-divisions are almost all exactly as they are today.


Native Companions (Brolgas) are very scarce here too as a result
of foxes and feral cats. Native Companions incidently live up to
100 years and generally mate for life, and remain in the same
place. Bill Butler states that two Brolgas have nested on his
property since 1928. Although they usually lay two eggs each year,
they have, in all that time, succeeded in rearing only three chicks,
for which Bill blames foxes.
What has hapened to the Frogs? When I was a youngster one could
not hear oneself think after a storm for frogs croaking, but now
they are very seldom heard after rain.
A GIRILAMBONE PIONEER
J.H. PAYNE OF "FAIRFIELD"
Just across the way from Grahweed
Heading slightly to the west
Lived a hardy pioneer couple
Widely known as Aussies best
Brought up in times when things were tough
Scarred by drought and little rain
A little block called "Fairfield"
Owned by one J.H. Payne
And everyone who knew him, spoke highly of the gent.
He'd always have a happy smile
He'd always pay his rent.
Before you'd see old J. himself
You'd most likely see his pipe
Poked from behind the grapevines
Just when the grapes were ripe.
That pipe of his with bendy stem
I'll tell you, "on the level"
The stink that rose from that old bowl
Would scare the very Devil.
He'd fill her 50 times a day, from his old jet black plugs
It surely makes one wonder when they talk to-day of drugs.

HARD TIMES
Sitting 'round the shearing board, chatting about nothing in
particular, my grandfather George started into a story.
"I've shorn for stingy fellows, but there was one bloke that took
the pudding."
"Don't you mean cake," I corrected.
"That's what I said," the old man replied. "Mind you this is as true
as I'm standing here. Anyhow, I was crutching for a bloke near a
place called "Gir Ham bone", his name I won’t mention. I'll call him
Fred."
"Now Fred wanted some wethers crutched and wigged and he asked
me what my price was. Threepence h'penny, I quoted him. Well
Fred staggered back at the price, but he recovered in less than a
moment and said, "George! how much is it for just an eye?"
"The price came down and the job was finished, in a rather short
time, but my pay was slow in coming. So I went to old Fred and
asked him what was the matter. And the old fellow told me a
story of how hard money was to come by. So at the end of it all,
I finished up taking a milking cow and a calf home instead of a pay
cheque."

EXTRACT FROM AN UNKNOWN NEWSPAPER OF JUNE 26, 1909:-
GIRILAMBONE
(FROM OUR OWN
CORRESPONDENT)
AFTER a long and painful
illness there passed away on
Thursday morning last, at
her late residence, Girilam-
bone mine, Mrs. Olivia Hun-
ter, an old and highly es-
teemed resident of this dis-
trict. The cause of death was
an internal complaint, from
which the deceased lady had
suffered soutely for some
years. In fact she had been
bed ridden for upwards of
two years. The best medical
advice had always been se-
cured, but apparently was
only effective in so far as
easing the pain was concern-
ed. Death was a happy relief
to so much suffering. The
late Mrs. Hunter who was 55
years of age, was born in
Denmark, but at the age of
20 came to Australia, land-
ing first in Victoria, but fin-
ally settling in N. S. Wales,
or to be more definite, at
Girilambone mine, at which
place her husband was em-
ployed. She was much res-
pected by all, and proved a
kind and good wife and
mother. For a number of
years she ably conducted a
Sunday School (Church of
England) at the Mine, and
was only forced to relinquish
the work through her illness.
To mourn their loss are left
a sorrowing husband, three
sons, (Carl, Samuel, and
Harold), and six daughters,
Mrs. Stephens (Amaroo, Mrs.
Routledge (Manly), Mrs. Lar-
sen and Mrs. Paterson, to-
gether with the Misses Lena
and Leslie, all of Girilam-
bone. The funeral, which
was largely attended, took
place on Saturday, the re-
mains being laid to rest in
the Church of England por-
tion of the local cemetary.
The Rev. R. Douglas, of
Nyngan, performed the last
sad rites.
Scarcely a week passes
lately without rain, which
has already worked miracles
in the appearance of the
countryside. Twenty points
of rain fell on Monday. The
weather is fine again and
quite mild.
Last week Murrawombie
station trucked 1600 fat
sheep to the Sydney markets.
On Friday last a successful
sheep sale was conducted by
Antill Bros, at the trucking
yards; Messrs. Brown, Murray
and Gibson being the pur-
chasers.

REMINISCENCES
From Jim Davison comes this contribution:-
The following is mainly in the form of anecdotes, and some of my
thoughts which I will try and put into words.
I have on record, taken from old Journals plus some thoughts of my
own, all the following:-
In June, 1915, Mr. C.M. Hall of "Willeroon" classed 21,060 fleeces
(Q 22/6 per 1,000. A total of £ 23/13/4 plus board valued at £9/-
/-, and in September. 1916 he classed 12,000 fleeces @ 25/- per
1,000. A rise of 2/6 per 1,000 in a little over 12 months. (Was
inflation on the way!) Seemingly he was a bit of a character in his
own right. I can recall one story he told my parents and they later
told me, of his riding a push bike into the wind, and the wind was
so strong it blew him backwards. The classing was at "Nealy";
where the wind was so strong, I don't know!


The first motor car my parents had was a Dodge 4 Cylinder,
purchased from Lyne & Co. of Nyngan 1370/-/-. July, 1917
(complete). I guess complete meant registration, etc 1 can
remember the car, so they must have had it for some years. / don't
know if it was a good or bad car, but there seems to be a never-
ending list of repairs. May be it was the driver. With all due
respects to dad as a car driver he was a very good horse and buggy
driver, and he did excel at the latter.
He had a very good sense of humour. I can recall the Rev. Father
Moran, who was stationed at Nyngan for many years and later at
Parkes where he passed away. Some of my earliest recollections
of him are when he used to do his rounds in a light buggy and two
ponies and later had a single seater Buick car. With great respect
for a wonderful man, he was just about as good a car driver as dad.
I fancy he was still driving his ponies. lam digressing, amazing
how one thought leads to another and another. Back to dad's sense
of humour.
One afternoon the Rev. arrived while dad was giving us kids our
hair cut (I may add he wasn't a very good hairdresser either).
Father Moran asked him where he had learnt his trade. Dad
answered ''Long Bay, Father". Not to be outdone. Father Moran
replied in his rich Irish voice "I am sure you did my good man, I
am sure you did". He had a great habit of saying "Ah know, ah
know". One day in Nyngan he was driving his Buick in the main
street, and the car stopped in front of the Far Western Motors,
about where P.W.'s parking lot is now. One of the mechanics went
out to see what was wrong and discovered the Rev. was out of
petrol and when the mechanic told him, he answered, "Ah know, ah
know". The mechanic answered "Why the bloody hell didn't you say
so”.
"Cigar" led by "Boxer" owned by H.D. Davison, "Burnside" (Yumbathuddi).


Another bit of humour from dad; he was playing euchre (at the
hotel of course). One of his opponents was Lloyd (Blondie) Inglis.
He (Blondie) dealt and took it up and said to dad "If you euchre me
this time, pop, you can kiss my ". Quick as a flash came
the answer "I'd sooner kiss your than your face". Of
course, all who remember the late Blondie will recall he was no
Clark Gable.
The first wireless at "Nealy", was made by a woolclasser named
Weignall. It was a crystal set and the only station we could
receive was 2BL. They used to play a little ditty "Tune in, tune
in, 1 think it just as well, you will hear the best of everything from
station 2BL". A little advertising even then. I think that would
be about 1919/1920.
There is also on record 500 wool packs costing £ lO9/2/10 which
included freight. Also an ice chest (which was a big luxury) bought
from E. Mugg of Bourke in 1916 for £3/13/-.
The following may be of some interest. About 1928/29 my brothers
Tom, Frank and I were sent out to muster Smith's and Hodder's,
now "Warra" (Keith Heckendorf) and we were to put the sheep into
Bald Hill (now Jim Gibson's country). It was just on dark when we
got them into Bald Hill; any way we came across a chap camped
for the night. He had a horse and spring cart and had a good big
fire going. He had been in town having a little holiday and was on
his way back to "Rosebank" where he worked. He must have been
on the final fling of his holiday, because he was down on his knees
showing us how he used to shoot grizzley bears in Canada; of
course we being kids got a great laugh out of it all. When I
mentioned earlier he was having the final fling of his holiday, it
was just that; indeed the final part of his life. Jack Vigor, who had
the hotel at the time and some others were going fishing the next
morning and they found this poor chap burned to death. It seemed
as if his clothes had caught alight and he ran in panic. They found
him some distance from his camp. I can't for the life of me think
of his name.
In conclusion I say to anyone who reads the foregoing, if they find
a little pleasure and some interest lam grateful. If I have bored
you accept my apologies.
If I have offended anyone connected to the people mentioned in my
anecdotes it was done without malice and I beg their pardon.

Bill Butler tells of the time during the War when some yanks were
on his property on R. & R. leave. They were shooting in a jeep
with a yank driving and were flat out after a red buck. After a
while the driver pulled up and on being asked why, replied - "Can't
catch him, the god-darned jeep was nearly flat out, and the 'roo
hand't even got down on to all fours yet!"
The following is a copy of an article taken from an old 1930 Nyngan
Observer:-
HEARTS OF OAK
by Harry Crawford
Station Master 1920
After an absence of 36 years it has been my pleasure to be the
guest of Mr. Donald McGuiness, his son Robert and Mrs. McGuiness
at their Mulga homestead, Coolabah. What lovely people they are.
In easy stages Donald and I renewed the life and progress of many
old friends of the early 90's and their descendants. In 1891/92 and
93 I moved about the West as relieving station master, and in
October of the latter year my new wife and her wayward pard
settled at Girilambone until 1900.
During that time one came to know everybody, and to rejoice with
the people when all went well, and to sorrow when the drought
reduced their possessions to nought and this latter state was theirs
when we migrated to Picton.
In my time the Copper mine was in full swing and ready money was
about. The Brewarrina line was not, and all the wool and goods
traffic moved into and out from Girilambone, so that it was a very
busy place. Let me mention the real pioneers of the new land
settlement.
The Mighty "Power"
There was Neil McDonald and his wife and a big family of sons and
daughters. No words of mine can portray the lovely qualities of his
family. We had the audacity to drive past their home one Sunday,
and didn't I get a lecture when Neil came to the station next time!
And what a great hearted fellow was Kenneth Murchison, and that
dear wife of his. Kenneth was for years and years one of the
leading figures in Western life. Alas! the heads of those fine
families have passed to their rest long since.


There was Kenneth McKinnon, C.R. Dicker, Tanner the Smiths
(brother and sister), the Payne family, Jim Begg, John Gibson,
Donald and Robert McGuiness, Mankin, the Larsen boys, Harry
Thorpe, Mr. and Mrs. Hartman (of the hotel) and many others.
There was another man, as great or greater than others, for Joe
Power was the centre man in the whole movement. He did very
well in his general store and this enabled him to go the other mile
with the settlers in their bad days, and laugh with them when the
clouds and rain returned.
Mr. Power used to come over to the railway station with his
cheque for freight, and often he would say, "I'll be glad if you will
hold this cheque for a day or two". I never failed to do so. On
these days Joe would be smoking the old wooden pipe. The next
time he might be seen smoking a fine cigar, the flavour of which
would make one envious. On these days the cheque could be
presented immediately.
In 1895 the McDonald's had a glorious crop of wheat - the first
ever grown so far West. They had 45 or 50 bales of wool from
their 3,000 ewes, but before I left the district their stock consisted
of only one cow and one horse hand fed.
It is from these dead ashes that I wish to pay tribute to a fine
stout hearted, courageous lot of people, for in my review with Mr.
Donald McGuiness I find that after struggling on like pilgrims in
dire distress, the earth responded plentifully at times and event-
ually the sons of the pioneers branched out on the properties of
their own, and in 95 per cent of cases they have made good.
When we left the West, John Gibson was working with K. Murchison
for 25/- or 30/- a week and rations, yet I know that not-
withstanding his great big family he possessed money and property
to the value of about £ 15,000 ere he died. His sons have made good
on the land and the Dicker boys, who were then just little boys, are
today holding down good jobs. Two are school inspectors, one is
secretary to the P.M.G., another a woolclasser and landholder and
who doesn't know Verne Dicker, the prosperous storekeeper of
Girilambone, and his son the baker?
The sons of my old friend Harry Thorpe, Ted and Harry are
substantial men of the land and trade. Tom and Ted Larsen have
passed on but Bill is comfortably settled on the land, and the Payne
boys too. Joseph Lamph who used to cart wool from Tom Cornish's
Womboin station, is now a big landholder, also the McManus boys.
George Butler has done exceedingly well, and has just returned

from his second trip overseas to the land of his birth. To prove
his faith in the land of his adoption he has promised to back the
Bill for the proposed £IBOO new School of Arts for Girilambone.
His dear wife passed over a few years ago, but there are two
daughters and a son at the old home.
The descendants of old Harry Payne have also done well and the
McKinnon family too. Mrs. McKinnon now over 80 years of age
still resides in the old family home. Another fine friend, the late
P.J. Kelly of Booroomugga, is now represented on the station by his
son. My host Donald McGuiness, his son Robert and his charming
wife and children, occupy a fine home on the Mulga holding at
Coolabah.
The tenacity and grit of all those people is amazing and in a sense
beyond all comprehension, to one who looked about in the year
1900 when the earth promised nothing.

GIRILAMBONE NSW 2841


The motif on the cover of this book and on the Centenary souvenirs was designed by Jamie Gibson,
13 years, of "Strathearn", Girilambone whose family first came to the district at the beginning of
the century.
The pick and shovel symbolise copper mining and the stars the name of the town "Girilambone"
which means "a place of falling stars". According to Aboriginal legend a falling star scooped a
depression on the top of Trig Hill.
