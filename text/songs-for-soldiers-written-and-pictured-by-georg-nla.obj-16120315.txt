These Soldiers’ Songs I dedicate
To God's best gift—a steadfast pal.
I read them first to you my mate.
We joined in wishes national.
When side by side life seems to be
A Cinema of pleasant dreams :
You learn't to ride to be with me
When making maps for warlike schemes.
And so we join in all we do.
We pick the best of fun from life :
These soldiers' songs I write to you
The best of pals—my wife.

DO IT FOR AUSTRALIA
A NATIONAL SONG
DO IT FOR AUSTRALIA!
Learn to fight as soldiers do—
Learn to train our boys and build them into worthy men and true;
It was on the men of Sparta that the walls of Sparta grew.
DO IT FOR AUSTRALIA!
And do every deed with might;
A goodly heritage as ours is worth a goodly fight;
For we battle for the future of "the nations of the white.”
DO IT FOR AUSTRALIA!
What a trust is in our hand;
For we hold the fort to-day against the trend of Asia’s band;
If we fail, the world will curse us as a “lotus eating land.”
DO IT FOR AUSTRALIA!
Was the spirit long ago
That led Australia’s pioneers to help this nation grow;
Australians, has that breed died out?
Fling out the answer—No!!
DO IT FOR AUSTRALIA!
Let this ever be our aim;
Let us set a grand example that our children do the same,
Until high amongst the Nations shines Australia’s honored name.


Our Cots
MARCHING SONG.
(Tune, “The man that broke the bank at
Monte Carlo.”)
Three little cots at Camperdown! Three little
children lie.
Who can tell what they will be in Australia’s
by and bye?
The General of our future, or the Admiral of
the sky
May arise from one of those three little tots,
So we build their little bodies in our cots.
CHORUS.
And we march along, with martial song, in our
bright Australian air.
We drill in street and square. For the future
we prepare.
But see that Young Australia gets the best of
help and care,
For they’re going to hold Australia in the
dawning.
We call aloud for immigrants to come from
oversea,
And we spend a lot of cash, so they’ll come to
you and me;
But don’t let us forget that young Australians
there be,
Who are sick and weak; poor helpless little
tots.
So we build them back to health in our three
cots.
Chorus.
Australia loses every year 10,000 lives or more;
It is worse than any war—and no enemy at
our door!
If they’re worth a fiver when they’re born,
when older they’re worth more,
So there’s big cash value in those little tots.
There’s a national business move in our three
Chorus.
There’s a moral obligation that everyone must
know:
Help the helpless little ones—you were one
once long ago.
But these had not the chances that your
mother could bestow,
So we help the little ones as on we plod.
We are building up the Temples of our God.
Chorus.
[ln August, 1912, a Naval and Military Carni-
val realised £285, which established three
Naval and Military Cots at the Royal Alexan-
dra Hospital for Children, for three years.
I desire these to be in perpetuity. This
book should help, as all proceeds will go to
that object. —G. A. Taylor, Hon. Organiser.]


GLORY FOR
AUSTRALIA
MARCHING SONG
Tune “ John Brown.’’
We are the Army of Australia the Fair;
That we will defend her well, we’re all prepared to swear;
For we are the men to fight—the men to do and dare.
As we go marching on.
CHORUS.
Glory, Glory for Australia; Glory, Glory for Australia;
With our guns and paraphernalia, we’ll go marching on.
If an enemy forgets himself and chances to alight
On our 10,000 miles of coast and dares to offer fight,
He’ll get more than he bargained for, and serve the beggar right.
As we go marching on.
Chorus.
Australia is a country great, a land of liberty,
Where people will tramp miles and miles a football match to see;
But think it rather tiring to drill like you and me!
As we go marching on.
Chorus.
But if they do not hurry up and join us like to-day,
They’ll get an awful licking if the foe will come their way;
And make them work like foreigners for eighteenpence a day!
As we go marching on.
Chorus.
Sometimes an officer who rides will pause and calmly think,
Then pass the word along to “brother officers’’—and wink;
And say the troops are thirsty, and it’s time they had a drink.
As we go marching on.
Chorus.
Marching is monotonous, that’s why we try to sing;
We’re not high-opera baritones, so shout like anything;
For glory for our Regiment—Australia—and our King.
As we go marching on.
Chorus.


• Call “Stables.”
The horse has been man’s staunchest friend,
Since history made a start;
To earn his bread, his aid he’ll lend
In pulling cab or cart.
When mankind goes to battle grim,
He takes with him, of course,
To work and fight and die with him,
His faithful friend—the horse.
CHORUS: Bugle Call “Stables.”
“Stables” they’re callin’
Come troopers, now fall in;
The horses are all in and wait at the lines ;
That they’re well groomed and well fed you must see;
For them a soft grassy bed there should be.
Until the dawnin’
We’ll ride in the mornin’
And all danger scornin’ we’ll win victory.
Of men who fall upon the field, we hear a wondrous lot;
But not a tear does mankind yield for faithful horses shot.
“The beggar’s hit! he’s now no use,” and vultures up on high
Watch gunners cut the poor beast loose—then swoop and help him die.
Chorus: “Stables, etc.”
They tell us that the motor-car will wipe the warhorse out,
They really “dunno where they are” to spread such stuff about;
We’d like to see the cars dash through the timber thick and large,
And jump the fences like we do when through the bush we charge!
Chorus: “Stables, etc.”
The Aeroplane some talk about and say it will supplant
The reconnoitring light horse Scout; we simply say “it can’t”!
The Aeroplanes can make a fuss and scout just as they please,
But cannot say how many of us are riding ’neath the trees!
Chorus: “Stables, etc.”

-HELD BY THE ENEMY.”
A Song without words


Introduce song with Bugle Call “Stables,”
sing Chorus, and then pick up first verse.
CHORUS
Sta—ble, Picket, it’s your job to-night:
See each blessed ’or—ses’ feedin’ bag is right;
See each rug is fixed quite taut and tight;
Or some slim chap may nick it!
Drive each peg so that it cannot slip.
Fix each leg rope so it will not trip,
Oh—an interesting job I tip
Is—Sta—ble Picket!
Hi—there you gunner in the new F.A, You have been a part of “Blues rear-
guard.
You’ve had hard fightin’ through a swelterin’ day.—“Red’s” advance had pushed
you rather hard.
If a position you’d take anywhere, to hold it long you didn’t get a chance;
Red’s Artillery would bang you out of
there and lead you and your horses such
a dance.
Chorus: “Stable Picket.”
The battle’s ended; then you hear the
You’re side lost, you’re really in the
news as you start the dusty ride to camp,
blues,” as you have that long and weary
tramp.
Constant jolting has made you rather
sore. You can’t see where fun comes in
at all;
So you reach the camp, but are your troubles o’er? Not much, for there’s that
blessed bugle call.
Chorus: “Stable Picket.”
You wish to say some nasty things, of course —but you shouldn’t say them if
they’re bad.
Remember that your broken-winded horse has had a worse experience than you
had.
How would you like to pull a heavy gun up and down the ridges as a test?
Under cracking whip you’d fail to see the fun. Then see the tired horses get a rest.
Chorus: “Stable Picket.”

Tune: It’s a Nice
CHORUS.
Good Light Horse—
We’re the first arm in the force—
To where there’s trouble we will find our way;
When the Empire has a row, we will all get
there somehow,
For we’re ever in the front when there’s a fray
Our horses share our fun, for we love them
every one;
An enemy we guess will feel remorse.
If he tries to take our land, he will feel the
heavy hand
the dashing, smashing good Light Horse
Just listen and we’ll sing to you our merry little song,
We started first in eighteen eighty-four;
To raise some cavalry, Macdonald said “we shan’t be long,
To help Australia if there should be war.”
He called the boys together and all who could afford.
Brought up a horse, no matter how decayed;
And enveloped in a tunic, with a p’liceman’s worn-out sword,
The Sydney Light Horse went upon parade.
Chorus: The Good Light Horse.
Our first escort was sending off the chaps to the Soudan,
When Dailey said, we were the pioneers
Of Lancer Corps, in all the world; and so the story ran,
The first world’s Corps of Lancer Volunteers!
Though we escorted Loftus on that first Empire Day,
It is funny now to read about our fix;
How we were short of lances, but were ready for the fray
With nothing but a lot of bamboo sticks!
Chorus: The Good Light Horse.
At Easter ’9B, four hundred bushmen without kit
Rode into Camp to show what they could do;
Mackay, their plucky Colonel, had a day to get them fit,
And march four squadron past at the review!
That night they got their uniforms, next day a sight was seen,
A real Australian turn-out was displayed;
A Reg’ment of real bushmen in their dress of myrtle green.
The first Australian Horse went on parade!
Chorus: The Good Light Horse

We made our mark in Africa, and Heaven rest each soul
Of dear old comrades that were left behind.
There were Griffin and Kilpatrick and the others on the roll
Of the heroes, whom we keep in mem’ry kind ;
We’re told we’ve made a record great in sport as well as war,
Our job in S.A. was well done they say;
We don’t forget our splendid officers who’ve gone before,
They built up what our fighters are to-day.
Chorus: The Good Light Horse
Sometimes we feel we’ve stayed too
long and ought to give it best,
But thoughts of an invasion raise
a scare.
We know if trouble came along, the
bushmen from the West
And North and South would join
us then and there.
Australia has a lengthy coast and
also big expanse,
For enemies to land and make a
stand.
The mobile Light Horse would soon
end a wild invader’s chance
Of staying long in this our dear old
land.
Chorus: The Good Light Horse


(Tune, “Sing a Song of Sixpence.”)
CHORUS. He lifts the logs and saplings;
Chancing silly stings
Sing a song of fences:
From adders, snakes and scorpions
Fences that we meet
During operations—
And other crawlin’ things.
Each of them a treat. Chorus.
Sickenin’ obstructions.
Spoilin’ all our fun;
If we only had our way THE WIRE FENCE.
Wed burn em every one! To infantry the Wire Fence
Is really just the thing.
__ _ That’s why they raise their voice in praise
THE POST AND RAIL When of such things they sing.
FENCE.
The trooper hates it any day,
The dashing F.A. too ;
First the Post and Rail Fence
Round the Cockle’s land,
But officers kindly look away:
Three snips—and then you’re through!
Leaves a sheaf of splinters
Stickin’ in your hand.
Chorus.
If the post be rotten
Or a trifle loose,
Shaking out the top rails
Saves you much abuse!
THE BARB WIRE FENCE.
The Fence that is Barb wired
Will raise a mournful wail;
Chorus,
No matter how you dodge it,
It grips you by the tail.
When even loose, it grips your legs
THE LOG FENCE
And clings just like a friend,
The Log Fence gives good cover who thinks Vet a fiver
But to get through counts. That you’re anxious for to lend.
The Neddy wont jump over:
The trooper then dismounts. Chorus.

RECITATIVE.
U£§/J='V This is the song of the signallers, the chaps who
wag the flags;
S You stay in bivouac; snug in bed, ]
J
Whilst we, the signallers, go ahead.
With our bundles of sticks and rags.
On our high boned mokes we make no fuss
But there’s a laugh and a jeer at us,
A laugh and a jeer at us.
At us!
Yet think of the job that we do for you;
You chaps who laugh and jeer!
We creep along with the main advance,
You wait behind—you take no chance
Till we tell you the road is clear.
Then everything that you have to do
Depends on the message we send to you
The message you get from us.
From us!


“For us.”
Oh! we’re the pals of each light horse scout.
And devils are they to go.
“The Ist Light Horse has crossed the bridge
And hold the enemy on the ridge”;
We wink by helio.
The rifles crack—you hear the fuss,
But you’re held back till you hear from us!
You must wait till you hear from us —
From us!
Yet ever since mankind learnt to fight
We’ve been useful though maligned.
The signaller of Egypt’s day,
When he brought bad news of a fray,
Was chopped down from behind!
Though you don’t attempt such jokes on us
You keep the rawest mokes for us!
The sorest mokes for us—
That’s wuss!
’Twas ever the same, you value least
In every rank and station
Those things most needful to your lives:
Why we know soldiers who give their wives
The least consideration!
So we sing for ourselves, our songs of praise!
We chuck at ourselves our own bouquets!
Our own bouquets from us—
From us!
It’s a long look back from our gear to-day
To the time of the “cross of fire”;
Which signallers carried from place to place
And ran their run like that Marathon race,
In the ancient days of Tyre.
And yesterday Marconi gave
The world the wonderful wireless wave!
That wireless wave—Marconi gave for us—
For us!
You seem surprised—yes—it’s for us!
Us signallers—objects of jeers,
With helio-flags and semaphore arms,
You coax us to work the wireless charms,
So christen us “Engineers”!
We stretch our lungs for ourselves—“ Three cheers
“Hip-Hip-Hip—Signallers—Engineers!
“Hi—Dry—Canteen—
Ten Gingerbeers—

Tunc; “The Absent Minded Beggar."
CHORUS.
Maps—Maps—Maps—Maps—telling you where you are.
Your enemy behind that ridge in ambush may be p’raps;
You can quickly get him set—see that he can’t move far,
But the first things you must get —are Maps—Maps—Maps.
Oh, it’s just a bit of paper marked in black, green, brown and blue,
And the blue mark means that water there maybe;
When you note brown along a road it means you may get through,
But look for bridges for Artillery.
Those wriggly lines mean contours, oh a useful thing’s a map.
The best of pals in war-time you will find it;
If you try to do without it, you will be a silly chap,
You’ll be the worst of beggars absent-minded.
Chorus: “Maps—Maps—Maps—Maps —etc.”
It was just a war in Africa, yet how we keenly felt
The lack of maps—we couldn’t travel far;
When you are lost like loonies over kopje, plain and veldt.
Without a map you don’t know where you are!
But Brother Boer knew well each hill—he knew each river bend,
He knew his country, knew his way about there;
He knew every little valley, and he knew well each blind end,
Where waiting till we came he blew us out there.
Chorus: “Maps—Maps—Maps—Maps—etc.”


For months and months that war stretched out, and Mr. Kruger said
He would “sweep the Englanders into the sea”;
But Bobs and Kitchener came along—Bobs smiled and shook his head,
“When we get maps another tale there’ll be.”
He sent for Colonel Henderson and Kich’s staff went out,
In Capetown G.P.O. some maps were finding;
They brought them up-to-date and then we knew our way about,
And we no longer were so absent-minding.
Chorus: “Maps—Maps—Maps—Maps—etc.”
We had the maps we knew the road, we guessed where Boers would hide,
We came in on their rear and made them roar;
Poking Cronje in the Modder and then turned that gory tide,
With maps in hand we ended that long war.
And there’s another instance—another striking case,
Of an army being mapless and so losing;
The Bulgars and the Grecians fought old Turkey to disgrace,
Because the best positions they were choosing.
Chorus: “Maps—Maps—Maps—Maps—etc.”
So it will always be the case if vict’ry is to come,
For knowledge is a power when it’s mapped;
Napoleon knew map-value on the glorious day at Ulm,
When 30,000 Austrians were trapped.
“Vive vive! Nap. fights them with our legs and not a shot was fired,”
His army cried in manner valedict’ry;
But they were wrong—it wasn’t with their legs—though they were tired,
’Twas with a map Napoleon won that victory.
Chorus: “Maps—Maps—Maps—Maps—etc.”
It may be years before we see (it may be in a week),
An enemy in force upon our shore;
Our great defence will strengthened be—and our foe will be weak.
If this our land he never saw before.
So let us have our eyes about—and keep each foreign spy
From making maps and observations taking;
And know our country well ourselves and have the knowledge nigh,
So honor those who spend their time map-making.
Chorus: “Maps—Maps—Maps—Maps—etc.”


We’ll sing the song of Lou.
Louis came from Jamberoo,
Lou : from
Jamberoo
LIGHT HORSE DITTY
Tunc : “ Killaloe
Whether you succeed or not always
try to do your best.”- Maxim.
Our sorrow at his loss we cannot quell;
For Lou is now at rest, he tried to do his best.
And so his epitaph we’ll simply tell.
He always tried to please, it seemed like a disease.
Yet he was jealous of the fellows who
Quite easily succeeded, not trying hard like he did.
Few tried as hard as Lou of Jamberoo.
CHORUS.
So here’s to Light Horse Loo—who
Came from Jamberoo —you
Couldn t find a clumsier if you made a special quest.
He d fumble and he’d stumble, and across his shadow tumble,
What Lou would do he knew that you would guess he tried his best.
At Parade he’d be the first, his turnout would be the worst,
Unbuttoned was his uniform of course;
As he stood there troopers chuckled, at his belly band unbuckled,
When he would mount he'd slip beneath his horse!
A nuisance was his zeal, when serving out a meal.
For he would fuss and fumble we confess;
His anxiety to hurry—spoil three uniforms—spilt curry,
And right before the LG. in the mess!
Chorus.
Once we lay low in the grass, where the enemy would pass,
And expose him to our fire on the road;
It was spoilt, and curses blue fell on Lou from Jamberoo,
For clumsy Lou had let a charge explode.
Horseholder we made Lou, no other job would do,
To the enemy his horses got away!
In his zeal to catch them Lou rode too far, and got caught too,
And we haven’t seen him since that fatal day.
Chorus.

ssi^a
Marching Song.
(Tune, “Father O’Flynn.”)
This is the Regiment Song—Let us yell it out.
If there is trouble —the Irish will smell it out.
It’s all in the blood, so that’s why we tell it out;
Just as in History’s pages ’tis told.
Chips of the old block, we sprout in Australia,
You know us by our wee bit of regalia.
With bayonets and such paraphernalia
We keep up the grim fighting spirit of old.
Chorus.
“Here’s to the Irish Australian Boys,
Divils for fighting and divils for noise!
Laughing, we pick out the best of life s joys.
For the worst of life’s troubles ne’er happen at ail!
On the SOUTHERN ROAD an Irish community
Boasts a girl in a store; and with wonderful unity,
Ev’ry man in the regiment takes opportunity
To have a personal reconnaissance!
When passing a girl with the touch of the Isle on her
It’s never “Eyes Front,” for we notice the style on her.
Each man in the regiment passes a smile on her,
That’s why they call us the Irish Gallants.
Chorus: “Here’s to the Irish Australian Boys, etc.”


The
Veteran
Tune,
“Reuben and Cynthia,”
from
“A Trip to Chinatown,”
This duet may be sung by half the
company (or basses) singing the part
of the veteran and the other half of
the company (or tenors) taking the
part of the trainee.
THE VETERAN:
“Trainee! trainee! I’ve been thinking, things are not what they should be;
“In my younger days there was no need for your ‘compulsory.’ ”
THE TRAINEE:
“Vet’ran! vet’ran! I've been thinking what you say is not quite right,
“In your days they had the ‘press-gang,’ press-gangs won Trafalgar’s fight.”
THE VETERAN:
“Trainee! trainee! I’ve been thinking guns were heavier in my days;
“And though haversacks were heavy, not a grumble did we raise.”
THE TRAINEE;
“Vet'ran! vet’ran! I’ve been thinking rifles may be light it’s true;
“But we carry ammunition more than twice as much as you.”
THE VETERAN:
“Trainee! trainee! I’ve been thinking uniforms are not so gay;
“They are not such dandy outfits as were red coats in my day.”
THE TRAINEE
“Vet’ran! vet’ran! I’ve been thinking khaki well our foe deceives;
“Red coats welcome bulls and bullets, pluck’s not worn upon our sleeves.”
THE VETERAN:
“Trainee! trainee! I’ve been thinking when you march ten miles or so
“How you grumble; we did fifteen in the days of long ago.”


Nature’s law of compensation, let me state,
As a source of inspiration it is great. C>,"
What goes UP please note precisely
By a DOWN is balanced nicely
1 will give you an example if you wait.
Take the soldier—see the private in his bliss! \
He is proud—his chest expanding UP like this; »> * j \
But as he rises in the ranks to something of renown, T \
The swelling isn’t on his chest, \
W

D0WN!
THE TRAINEE:
“Vet’ran! vet Tan! I’ve been thinking we to-day have heavy loads;
“And our movements are much quicker—l'll bet you had ‘better roads.' ”
THE VETERAN:
“Trainee! trainee! I’ve been thinking, your fighting methods system lack;
“Formations like extended —order aren’t as good as column —attack.”
THE TRAINEE:
“Vet’ran! vet’ran! I’ve been thinking, quick-firing guns would soon make lanes
“In your columns, which would also prove bulls’-eyes for aeroplanes.”
THE VETERAN:
“Trainee! trainee! I’ve been thinking discipline seems pretty dead;
“Why do soldiers write to papers when they think they’ve got ‘sore head’ ?
(Softly and slowly.)
But the trainee did not hear him, as he looked outside the door;
Calling to a passing sport —“Hi! tell us what’s the latest score”?

fighters and — okitcrs S on g in “lolanthe.”)
In street and lane our trainees train, and
chance a bump or two from motor-
cars,
Because some aldermen maintain a
dignity that’s on a par with Shahs’
Empire sentiments they’ll use, yet do
their best to put a chill upon
Our best defence, as they refuse Cadets
their Town Hall grounds to drill
upon
Chorus
Whenever we find a spy about and getting
information on the spot,
The daily papers loudly shout, and of
the circumstance will make a lot;
But all the time the foreigner just maps
the country that is new to him,
While people who could stop him simply
TALK about what they will do to
him.
Chorus,
Some public men, with much pretence,
will say “our destiny is national.”
And so shout out that our defence “should
be more vigorous and rational.”
Each speech they make will say, “Each
man should bear a gun”—or that’s
the trend of it.
They do not bear a gun themselves —
they would not know the business
end of it!
CHORUS.
And ail they do for our defence is—talk
—talk—talk—talk—talk—talk!
It suffers much in consequence of —talk
—talk—talk —talk —talk!
The men who teach the young trainee
should get your help and sympathy,
For when a foe will reach our shore,
and wildly hammer at our door,
You’ll talk —talk—talk—talk—talk—
talk!
But you’ll have to fight with something
more than talk —talk—talk—talk—
talk!


J
(Tune, “Jessie’s Dream.”)
Ye can blaw aboot yer heroes ye’ve met wi’ in history,
Hannibal, the Great Napoleon, Stanewa Jackson, Robert Lee;
There wis Dewey Admiral, wha gae auld Spain a bad defeat,
There wis Tushima Togo, wha smashed up Russia’s michty fleet.
There wis Hobson under fire, sank the Merrimac that day,
When he bottled up the Spanish ships in Santiago’s Bay;
Tho’ they a’ were michty men wha’s names in history lang shall ring,
We a’ ken a greater hero, it’s o’ him that we will sing.
Aye, it’s aisy tae mak heroes wi’ the enemy in sicht,
That’s whan every nerve is tinglin’, tae get at him and fecht;
When the guns are crackin’ roond ye, and yer seein’ comrades fa’,
Ye wish the “assault” was ordered and ye wait that bugle ca’.
Wi’ fixed bennets ye charge forward, wi’ set teeth, wi’ hard-gripped gun,
There are ninty o’ yer comrades, and they’re heroes everyone;
Aye! it’s in sic’ stirrin’ meenits heroes brave are quickly made,
But oor hero, Jock McDermott, won his glory on parade!
He wis in the Scottish Rifles, six foot tall and burly built,
Aye, McDermott looked a bonnie pictur’ wi’ his tartin kilt;
One hot day whan on parade, the General cam tae inspect,
Jock stood there jist like a statue, prood and haughty so erect
As he stood there at attention, ony officer he’d please,
Eyes front—knees straicht, heels thegither, feet at 45 degrees;
Sune his teeth began agratin’ and his een began tae roll,
But he didna mudge, tho’ up his leg an ant began tae stroll!
A sodger ant —the bulldog breed! But Jock stood still, tho’ he stared hard,
When that sma’ brit alo his kilt, began a nesty promenade;
That inspection seemed a lifetime Jock didna’ wince, he didna’ wilt,
There at “attention” he stood still, tho’ that ant broused alo his kilt;
No till “Stand at ease” wis gi’en, did he shift that ant! He feels
That he saved his reg’ment, yet for lang he stood up tae his meals!
Did ye ken Jock wis a hero just as michty as them a’,
Peacetimes eh hae their vict’ries, just as much as gory war.


The
Outpost
CHORUS
“Halt”—l quickly raise my rifle,
With my duty none must trifle;
You will get a warm reception
If at once you do not yield.
Thus I stand, defying entry,
For I am the outpost sentry;
The watching eye, the listening
ear of the Army in the field
Here I stand an outpost picket,
Aye! our foe is near—and keen;
Thus I watch each bush and thicket.
Seeing without being seen.
In the gloom of night each shadow,
May conceal a lurking spy;
Crackling stick and dead leaf rustle
Tell of footsteps, so I cry:
Chorus: “Halt, etc.”
Out upon the bleak ridge gazing,
I guard through the cold night long;
Far behind from Camp Fires blazing,
Come the sounds of jovial song.
There’s no fire for the sentry,
For my post must not be known;
So I fight against mosquitoes,
Whilst I feel inclined to drone:
Chorus: “Halt, etc.”
I may have to guard a highway.
Leading from the main camp site;
I oft’ wish that road were my way.
After that day’s “blue-red” fight:
As the boys—light-hearted laddies,
Go to town to have their spree;
Pass me with their Yip-I-Addies,
This the only song for me.
Chorus: “Halt, etc.”
But when you’re on outpost duty,
How the stars seem strangely bright;
All things then take on a beauty,
You don’t see in City Light.
And you feel there is a Something,
Whisp’ring to you—quietly;
To the Better Man within you,
“Be the man—you ought to be.”
But the devil that is in you.
Tells of spicy younger days;
Pictures coming city pleasures,
But your better spirit says:
Chorus: “Halt, etc.”

As It Was~Now and
Ever Shall Be
The snake with poisoned fang defends
(And does it really very well).
The cuttle fish an inkcloud sends;
The tortoise has its fort of shell;
The tiger has its teeth and claws;
The rhino has its horns and hide;
The shark has rows of saw set jaws;
Man—Stands alone, the whole world
wide
Unarmed and naked!— But ’tis plain
For him to fight—God gave a brain!
Far back in this world’s early mists
When man began to use his head;
He stopped from fighting with his fists
And gripped a wooden club instead.
But when the rival tribe was slain.
The first tribe then to stand alone
Had once again to work its brain
And made an axe—an axe of stone!
The stone-axe tribe would hold first place;
And ruled the rest where’er it went,
Because then—as to-day—the race
Was first that had best armament.
But human brain expanding more
(Its limits none can circumscribe) ;
The stone-axe crowd went down before
The more developed bronze-axe tribe.
Then shields came in to quickly show
Their party victors in the strife;
By warding off the vicious blow
And giving warriors longer life.
The tribe’s wise men would urge at
length,
No doubt as now, for tax on tax,
To keep the “Two tribe’’ fighting strength
With “super-dreadnought ” shield and
axe!


The bow and arrow came and won \
For Death came winged from far away. u
Then came the cannon and the gun;
And brought us where we are to-day.
And now we see the shield of yore
An arsenal of armour plate;
With crew a thousand men or more;
And guns a hundred tons in weight.
Beneath our seas dart submarines,
Around the world and back again.
But every marvel only means
Some greater triumph of the brain.
For while the thund’ring hammers ring ;
And super-dreadnoughts swarm the
sea;
There flits above, a birdlike thing,
That claims aerial sovereignty!
A thing of canvas stick and wheel
“The two man fighting aeroplane.”
It screams above those hulks of steel: I
“Oh ! human brain begin again.”


Oh Thou! who gavest brain and life
But as I ran that cartridge belt
The first the second to defend;
Along the breach and back again.
Sustain us through to-morrow’s strife
I raised my head. ’Twas then I felt
Oh Lord—be with us to the end.
A crashing shot cut through my brain!
’Tis true our foe’s a colored race
I know I fell—I know I slept
And ignorant of war-like science,
The sleep of death, and then I found
With weapons out of date and place;
Whilst we on Maxims—place reliance.
My tired spirit slowly crept
From that smashed carcase on the
For we to-day have progressed more.
ground.
To reach perfection do we strive.
It struggled from its tenement —
We recognise our one great law
“The fittest only shall survive.”
O God of Gods! May it not be!
For waiting there with grim intent
Our force in flesh and blood is small,
Were spirits of that sixty-three.
Much smaller than that dark skinned lot;
Grim vengeful spirits—I set free!
But we have many guns in all:
We pin our faith to shell and shot.
Around my anguished soul they crushed
And as this foe invades our land
Our freedom Lord must we defend.
Lord! through it all sustain our hand
To clutch it as it struggled there.
And then I know I only rushed
In headlong terror —God knows where!
Until the end—Until the end!
“Quick —crush that spirit of the Gun!!
For I’m “the man behind the gun.”
With frenzied screams they shriek at me
In dreams I saw the foe advance!
“Before ’twas sixty-three and One,
My Maxim mowed them—at the run.
“But now it’s one and Sixty-three”!
I butchered them in grim plaisance.
For I’m a gunner, with one gun.
And match for ninety can I be:
I fled in fear—I prayed for peace,
And heard a Voice proclaim; that War
And there beneath a blood red sun
Shall terror bring until ’twill cease
I mowed them down in ecstacy!
To be man’s universal law.
And of that ninety—sixty odd
Oh Thou who gavest brain and life
Were butchered in my fiendish fun.
The first the second to defend,
Were sent by me to meet their God,
Sustain us through to-morrow’s strife,
By me—the gunner—and one gun!
Oh Lord, be with us to the end!

It -was on the men of Sparta that they grew.

Do it for Australia! Let this ever be our aim;
Let us set a grand example that our children do the same,
Until high amongst the Nations shines Australia’s honored name.
A grand example ever be our aim.
Until high amongst the Nations shines Australia’s honored name.
