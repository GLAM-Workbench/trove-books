One day Mrs. Jones opened her front door and found a tiny puppy
sitting on her doormat. Now Mrs. Jones was a very kind lady, so,
although the puppy was very dirty and grubby she picked him
up and took him inside and gave him a big dish of milk to drink.

The puppy was so hungry that he rushed at the milk and stood
right in the dish and lapped it up as quickly as he knew how.

Mrs. Jones decided there and then that she would give him a
home and teach him to behave as a nice puppy should. After
Osker (that was the name given him by his newly found mis-
tress), had finished his meal, Mrs. Jones got a tub of water and gave
him a bath, then combed and brushed his coat until it glossed.


Now Osker was a very wayward puppy and for a whole week his
mistress tried to train him to sleep in the little box which she had
made up for him, but Osker much preferred to take his nap in the
big sewing basket.


In the garden of his new home the little puppy saw many amaz-
ing things such as little lizards which he delighted in chasing,
but, when he first saw a rather large frog, he nearly died of
fright.


Osker often watched other dogs racing past his house and one
day decided to go out and make friends with some of them. He
soon came across a very large dog who barked so loudly that
poor little Osker ran away as fast as he could go.

He saw a gate open further down the street, so dashed down the
path into the back yard where he saw some fowls behind a wire
netting. He scratched a hole in the ground and crawled through
and began barking wildly.

All of a sudden a big rooster came rushing towards him. The
rooster seemed so angry that Osker fled for home. When he
reached home he felt so safe that he vowed that he would never
go away again.

But the next day after being scolded for chewing the toe out of
Mr. Jones' very best slipper, he thought that perhaps after all he
would go out for a run. He took great care to keep away from
all big dogs this time, though.


He was enjoying his outing immensely when he saw a butcher
carrying a basket from which dangled things that smelt very
nice. He jumped and jumped and barked and barked, but he
just couldn't reach those sausages.

So he tore off to play chase with some children who were running
so fast that Osker could hardly keep up with them. They soon
came to a beach where the children played games in the sand
and paddled in the water.

Osker thought that this was grand and exciting, and when the
children threw sticks in the water Osker would rush in after them
and bring them back. The children were delighted and made a
great fuss of Osker.

Osker had never been so happy and pleased with himself. All
the way home he barked at the sparrows and chased them till
they fled in fright. This gave him so much confidence that he de-
cided that he would never be afraid of anything again.

Now at night time the slightest sound brings Osker to the gate
barking so fiercely that strangers dare not go too near the house.

And in the day time Mrs. Jones trusts him so much that when she
puts the baby out in the sun to sleep she always calls Osker to
come and watch that no harm comes to him.
