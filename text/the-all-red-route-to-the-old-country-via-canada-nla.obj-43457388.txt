THE "All Red Route” from
Australia and New Zealand
to Europe is via the sister
Dominion of Canada. The Trans-
Pacific crossing from Sydney or
Auckland to Victoria-Vancouver is
made by the Canadian Australasian
Line, intermediate stops ©being
made at Suva and Honolulu. This
service is performed by the quad-
ruple-screw motor ship "Aorangi”
(18,000 gross tons) and the triple-
screw steamship "Niagara'” (13,500
gross tons). These liners sail
regularly from Sydney every four
weeks reaching their ports as
follows; Auckland, Sff days with a
stay in port of roughly 24 hours;
Suva, 9 days with a stay of b
hours; Honolulu, 16 days with stay
of 6 to 8 hours, and Victoria and
Vancouver in 22 days.
Across Canada the journey is
made over the lines of the Canadian
Pacific Railway. The Rockies —the
backbone of the continent —are
first traversed by the quickest and
most picturesque route. Beyond,
there is a choice of itineraries to
the Atlantic coast. Travellers
whose business takes them to the
United States may leave the main
line of the Canadian' Pacific at
Moose Jaw, taking the "Soo” line
to Minneapolis, St. Paul and Chi-
cago. From these points they may
continue to New York or return to
Canada and see the eastern pro-
vinces.
The Atlantic seaboard being
reached, the Trans-Atlantic journey
is made by Canadian Pacific Steam-
ships, led by the blue ribbon ship of
the Atlantic, the "Empress of
Britain.” Frequent sailings are
operated to British and continental
ports by the picturesque St. Law-
rence Short Seaway. Accommoda-
tion to suit all requirements may be
had on the Canadian Pacific fleet.
Stop-overs. Across the Pacific
passengers may arrange stop-overs
at any port en route, on due notice
being given. Across Canada,
liberal stop-overs, too, may be
arranged. In primis Banff, Lake
Louise and Emerald Lake should
be visited. That the accommoda-
tion and service on the "All Red
Route” are unexcelled goes without
saying. The steamships of the
Canadian Australasian Line are the
finest operating between the Anti-
podes and the North Pacific Coast;
The Canadian Pacific whose trains
carry you across Canada and whose
steamships speed you across the
Atlantic, is the World's Greatest
Travel System.
First Class Cabin —“Aorangi”


Sydney. Sydney is the natural
port of departure on the "All Red”
Route. The largest city in Aus-
tralia, with a population just over
the million mark, it boasts the
finest harbour in the world with a
shore line of 165 miles. The
serried panorama of the city front
reveals towering spires and domes,
palatial public edifices and hand-
some business buildings indicative
of the city’s industrial and com-
mercial importance.
Auckland. A off-day trip from
Sydney (1,281 miles distant) is
Auckland —the largest city of New
Zealand and one of the most
beautifully situated in that fav-
oured country. The city was
founded in 1840 and for twenty-
five years from that time was the
capital of the Dominion until the
more central location of Wellington
brought about the change.
The site was chosen in order to
separate what were once the most
numerous and warlike tribes of the
Maoris; in consequence Auckland
possesses a museum containing an
unequalled collection of Maori
relics. The Maoris, the native
people of New Zealand, are Poly-
nesians who, according to their own
legends, discovered the islands more
than thirteen centuries ago. In no
way inferior to the white race
mentally, they are physically one
of the finest races in the world.
Fiji Islands. For three days
after leaving Auckland, the ship
proceeds northward through the
transparent waters of the Pacific
to the Fiji Islands. Six hours are
spent here. There arc 250 of these
islands in all, eighty of which are
inhabited, with a total population
of 160,000. On the most important
of these, Viti Levu, the capital,
Suva, is located and into its magni-
ficent harbour the liner steams.
The Union Steam Ship Company
maintains a beautiful hotel at
Suva, the Grand Pacific.
Honolulu. With the glamorous
lands of "Aloha” ahead the ship
runs north-northeast and within a
week is at Honolulu. Six to eight
hours are usually spent here.
Looking back on a visit to Hono-
lulu is like looking on a series of
beautiful pictures pictures of
flower-scented tropic nights, of
moonlit swims in the creaming
surf, of beach parties and dancing
to the haunting music of guitars, of
glorious "leis” or wreaths of flowers,
of coral reefs and palm trees, of
surf riding at Waikiki and Hawai-
ian boys diving for coins; pictures,
too, of the leave taking as the ship
draws away for Victoria to the
unforgetable strains of “Aloha.”

On the 7th at Oak Bay, Victoria
A Canadian Pacific “Princess” Steamship
Victoria. Charmingly situated at
the southern end of Vancouver
Island, Victoria —the capital city
of British Columbia —gives a bright
welcome to the arriving traveller.
Although its enterprising business
district speaks of a rich commerce
drawn from the forest, mineral and
agricultural resources of the in-
terior, Victoria is essentially a
home city, with beautiful houses,
bungalows, gardens, lawns, boule-
vards and parks. It has further-
more a distinct charm of its own
(hat has made it a favorite resi-
dential and vacation city for both
summer and winter alike.
The Empress Hotel. The Em-
press Hotel, first of the chain of
Canadian Pacific Hotels that you
will find spanning Canada from
coast to coast, is a beautiful struc-
ture matching the city, overlooking
the Inner Harbor and facing the
handsome Parliament Buildings.
Adjoining the Empress Hotel an
amusement casino, the Crystal
Garden, contains one of the world's
largest glass-enclosed salt water
swimming pools, with dancing
floors and attractive promenades.
The Parliament Buildings, which
rank among the handsomest on the
American Continent, overlook the
Inner harbour. Adjoining them is
the Provincial Museum, very com-
plete and interesting, and contain-
ing a large assortment of specimens
of natural history, native woods,
Indian curios and prehistoric instru-
ments. The Provincial library
contains a large collection of his-
torical prints, documents and other
works of great value and interest.
Victoria has a great mam' in-
teresting places to visit, such as
Oak Bay, the Beeches, the Obser-
vatory, Beacon Hill Park, and the
beautiful Butchart gardens. Sight-
seeing busses which leave the hotel
during the summer months make it
easy to cover some of these places
in a short time.
All kinds of summer sports are
available at Victoria, including
good fishing and year round golf,
the latter on six fine courses.
Playing privileges are extended to
visitors on these courses.
The fishing and shooting on
Vancouver Island arc of the best—
trout, salmon, pheasant, grouse,
cougar, bear, deer and moose being
the prizes. Shawnigan Lake,
Cowichan Lake, Sproat Lake, Great
Central Lake and Campbell River
areamongst the most famous fishing
waters of this continent. There are
also excellent bird shooting and big
game hunting.

Vancouver. Vancouver, the
largest city of British Columbia
and a short sail from Victoria
across the picturesque Straits of
Georgia, is beautifully situated
on Burrard Inlet, a long arm of the
Pacific Ocean that forms an all-but-
landloched and fully sheltered
harbor. Facing it across this
harbor is the sharp profile of a
magnificent mountain range. With
its imposing business section, its
busy docks, its fine shopping
streets and its flower-garbed resi-
dential suburbs that have over-
flowed north across the Inlet and
south towards the Fraser River,
Vancouver is one of the great
metropolitan centres of Canada. •
The Hotel Vancouver, operated
by the Canadian Pacific, is one of
the finest hotels of the North
Pacific Coast, very strikingly situ-
ated and with a high reputation
for the excellence of its service.
A Summer City. Vancouver is
a favorite summer city, for its mild
climate, floral luxuriance and close-
ness to water make life there plea-
sant. There are many bathing
beaches, parks, boulevards, golf
courses, automobile roads, and
short and long steamer trips on the
surrounding waterways. Stanley
Park, a remarkable forest of almost
primeval characteristics, is situated
within the city limits. Across the
Inlet is Capilano Canyon, a remark-
able natural feature; and the
Marine Drive is one that introduces
some very picturesque scenery.
The volume of trans-Pacific ex-
port and import trade has made
Vancouver a very important sea-
port, while the city has also im-
mense lumbering, mining, agricul-
tural, shipbuilding, and manufac-
turing interests.
Tramp ships from the seven seas
ply into Vancouver. Lumber from
the forests of British Columbia-
Vancouver's first commercial love- -
is still a great item in her exports,
both by rail and water, but the
giant elevators which annually in-
crease in number around the har-
bour bear witness to the phenom-
enal growth of grain export, for now

golden flood of Alberta and Sas-

elevators. Pulp, paper, canned
goods, fruit and hundreds of manu-
factured lines are handled.
To and from Vancouver, Cana-
dian Pacific Princess steamers pro-
vide a service on Puget Sound,
with a morning “triangle" service
to Victoria and Seattle, and direct
night service between Victoria and
Vancouver in each direction.

Across Canada. With the
western gateways of Canada
reached, the first stage of the
journey is complete. The second
may now be surveyed. To cross
Canada the rail must traverse the
canyons of the Thompson and the
Fraser Rivers. Majestic as this
scenery is, it'is but a prelude to the
more memorable spectacle of the
Rockies —that sea of almost seven
hundred peaks over 6,000 feet above
sea level. With the Rockies passed,
a variety of routes will be available
to the east.
All year round the Canadian
Pacific operates two passenger
trains across Canada in both direc-
tions: the “Imperial” between Van-
couver and Montreal and the
“Dominion” between Vancouver,
Toronto and Montreal. For those
who have occasion to travel via the
United States, excellent service is
provided by the “Soo-Dominion”
which operates between Vancouver
and Chicago, connection being
made at Chicago with points east.
Transcontinental trains operated
by the Canadian Pacific carry
modern all-steel equipment. Dur-
ing the summer months open
Observation cars are operated
through the mountains In addition
to the regular lounge and observa-
tion cars. Other types of cars
operated include Standard Sleep-
ing Cars with Drawing Rooms and
Compartments; Compartment Cars
(10 compartments). Dining Cars,
and Solarium Lounge Cars, the
latter equipped with vita-glass and
comprising Women's Lounge and
Bath, Men's Bath, Smoking Room,
Buffet, Observation Lounge Solar-
ium: Valet service is also available.
Travellers stopping over en route
will appreciate the comforts of the
seventeen Canadian Pacific hotels
which form a chain from the
Atlantic to the|Pacific.
These hotels are strategically
situated in the most important
resort and commercial centres of
the Dominion, and their appoint-
ments and service are of the highest
type. In addition to these hotels,
nine chalet-bungalow camps are
operated by the Canadian Pacific,
six in the Rockies and three in
Ontario.
To Alaska. A side trip from
Victoria or Vancouver is that to
Alaska —land of the midnight sun,
the Klondyke, the trail of the '9B
and the fierce stampede to the
northland for gold. The 1,000 miles
trip is made by Canadian Pacific
‘‘Princess” steamships.

Past such rugged giants as Mi. Stephen run the Canadian
Pacific Transcontinental lines. Mt. Stephen, 10,485 feet in height,
is named after George Stephen, later Lord Mount Stephen, first
President of: the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.

Iceland Poppies on the Margindof Lake Louise
Lake Louise, with the sun-gloriticd Victoria glacier at its farther
end, is probably the most perfect gem of scenery in the known
world—a dramatic palette on which the Great Artist has
splashed His most gorgeous coloring.


Banff Springs—A Canadian Pacific Hotel
©A.S.N.
Banff, situated amid a circle of pearly-gray peaks, is one of the
most popular mountain resorts on the continent due not only to
its environment but also to the superbly located and splendidly
appointed Banff Springs Hotel.


Fmorale Lake Chalet
Chateau Lake Louise Showing Swimming Pool
Tennis Courts at Banff Springs Hotel
Three of the most important
resorts in the Canadian Rockies
are —from West to East —Emerald
Lake Chalet, Chateau Lake Louise
and Banff Springs Hotel.
Emerald Lake Chalet, on the
shores of the lake from which it takes
its name, is built of great squared
timbers and is surrounded by rustic
bungalows. Less formal, perhaps,
than Banff or Lake Louise, it is no
less comfortable. In its vicinity are
many charming trail trips on foot
or by pony while the lake itself has
a fair supply of trout.
Chateau Lake Louise stands on
the Margin of the “Pearl of the
Rockies" In a wonderful Alpine
flower garden where poppies, vio-
lets, columbines, anemones and
sheep laurel slope through terraced
lawns to the water’s edge. Across
the front of the hotel stretches a
vast lounge that commands an
unobstructed view of the Lake.
The Chateau has many attrac-
tions, It is an ideal centre for trail-
riding, climbing and hiking to the
many other beautiful spots close by.
Fine hard tennis courts are attached
to the hotel and a boathouse sup-
plies row boats and canoes. There
is also an attractively terraced
concrete swimming pool, filled with
heated glacial water and with
instructors in attendance. There is
no fairer spot than Lake Louise
and no visitor to Canada should
depart without visiting it.
Banff, forty-two miles east of
Lake Louise, is the summer social
centre of the Canadian Rockies.
Situated in an amphitheatre of
peaks at the confluence of the Bow
and Spray rivers, it vies with any
other part of the Rockies 'with its
remarkable variety of sublime and
romantic natural beauty.
This appeal is due not only to
Banff’s own environment but also
to the world famous Banff Springs
Hotel. This magnificent structure
dominates Banff like a huge grey
baronial castle. Its interior is
characterized by a spaciousness,
comfort and beauty which have
made its standards a criterion.
The attractions comprise golf,
tennis, swimming—either in a
warm sulphur or a cool fresh water
pool —motoring through superb
scenery, riding and climbing.
Diversified annual events in-
clude official trail-rides under the
auspices of the Trail Riders of the
Canadian Rockies affiliated with a
similar order in Australia, golf
tournaments and "Indian week" a
colorful pageant when the Stoney
Indians hold their tribal sports.
In addition to the three hotels
already mentioned, the Canadian

Pacific owns and operates during
summer sixChalet-BungalowCa nips
in the Canadian Rockies. These
camps comprise a central chalet,
with dining room and lounge, sur-
rounded by snug cabins of timber
construction. The locations have
been, carefully chosen and the life
appeals particularly to lovers of
the great outdoors. Rates are
moderate.
Camps are operated at Wapta
Lake just west of the Great Divide;
at Yoho Valley famed for the crash-
ing Takakkaw Falls; Moraine Lake,
9 miles south of Lake Louise; Lake
O’Hara where no automobile has
ever penetrated; Castle Mountain
and Radium Hot Springs. Another
camp of similar nature is operated
at Mt. Assiniboine, the “Matter-
horn of the Canadian Rockies.”
Information on the hotels and
chalet-bungalow camps in the
Rockies may be had from any
Canadian Pacific Agent.
Motor Detour. Some of the most
magnificent scenery in the Cana-
dian Rockies is easily accessible.
Excellent automobile services
greatly enhance the pleasure of
the visitor.
One of the finest of these or-
ganized automobile excursions is
the Motor Detour between Golden
and Banff*. It has been especially
designed to enable those with
limited time at their disposal to
see the scenic “highlights” of the
Rockies. Eastbound, passengers
detrain at Golden, make the Motor
Detour and resume the; rail journey
at Banff. Special arrangements are
made for handling baggage and
sleeping car reservations.
After leaving Golden the detour
includes the Kicking Horse Canyon
Natural Bridge, Emerald Lake,
Yoho Valley, the Kicking Horse
Pass, Lake Wapta, The Great
Divide and Chateau Lake Louise
where an over-night stop is made.
From Lake Louise the detour con-
tinues to Johnston Canyon and
ends with a sight-seeing trip around
Banff.
While this 142 mile detour can be
made in 24 hours, most people will
prefer to spread it over two or three
days, or even longer, stop-over
privileges being allowed en route.
From Banff the long descent to
the prairies begins. Winding
through narrow passes, eroded In
the great grey bulk of the last
ranges, the railway follows the
ancient glacier-grooved BovvValley.
The gap is passed and presently the
mountains smooth themselves out
into rolling grassy foothills.

The Gap — Western Entrance
A Typical Prairie Scene
Royal Alexandra Hotel, Winnipeg
Across the Prairies. Calgary,
headquarters of a large irrigation
system developed by the Canadian
Pacific, is also the scene each July
of the famous "Stampede”—a
week's carnival of cowboy sports
and contests. The Canadian
Pacific Hotel here, the Palliser,
adjoins the station and provides
comfortable headquarters from
which to visit this enterprising
community.
For a day after leaving Calgary
the journey is across the prairies.
On either side, stretching for hun-
dreds of miles north and south are
seen the herds of live stock and
enormous grain, fields.
Important cities on the main line
are Medicine Hat, Moose Jaw,
Regina (capital of Saskatchewan,
with a fine Canadian Pacific hotel
named after the province), Bran-
don and Winnipeg. Branch lines
criss-cross the prairies.
To the United States. At
Moose Jaw the traveller whose
destination is the United States
will leave the main line and travel
over the Soo Line to Minneapolis,
St. Paul and Chicago. This is the
route of the Soo-Dominion from
Vancouver to Chicago.
Winnipeg. Winnipeg, at the
confluence of the Red and Assini-
boine Rivers, is the capital of
Manitoba- -a beautiful and pros-
perous city that is the metropolis
of the prairie provinces, one of the
greatest primary wheat markets of
the world and an important in-
dustrial and railway centre.
Through it every year flows the
largest part of the huge western
Canadian harvest on its way to
help to feed the -world. Adjoining
the station is the Canadian Pacific
hotel, the Royal Alexandra, a
popular hotel and social centre of
this progressive prairie city.
The prairies are left behind and
succeeded by a picturesque region
of forests, lakes, rivers and ravines.
Soon the western section of the
great province of Ontario is entered
at Lake of the Woods where flour
mills, pulp mills, and sawmills are
in operation day and night.
We are now in the vast hinterland
that fringes lake Superior. Hie
magnificent inland ocean is first
seen at the twin cities of Port
Arthur and Fort William whose
many giant elevators bear vivid
testimony to the western Canadian
wheat crop that finds its eastbound
outlet here.


_ Three Chalet-Bungalow camps,
similar in construction to those in
the Rockies, are operated by the
Canadian Pacific in Ontario.
The first of these is Devil’s Gap
Camp in the Lake of the Woods
region. The detraining point is
Kenora on the Canadian Pacific
mam line, 126 miles east of Win-
nipeg. The camp launch connects
with train arrivals and soon you
are at a charming settlement in the
heart of this unspoiled vacation
land. Golf, tennis, swimming,
fishing for "muskies,” bass and
lake trout, and all other aquatic
sports are among the attractions.
The camp is open in summer
months and the rates are moderate.
Great Lakes. A very agreeable
summer break in the trans-con-
tinental rail journey is the optional
two days’ sail by Canadian Pacific
Steamships across the Great Lakes.
Detraining at the Twin Cities,
travellers sail across Lake Su-
perior, through the locks at Sault
Ste. Marie then across Lake Huron
to either Port McNicol or Owen
Sound, on Georgian Bay, whence
Toronto is quickly reached by rail.
Passengers of course, who so desire
may make the entire trans-Canada
journey by rail.
The second of the Chalet-Bunga-
low camps reached is Nipigon, near
the mouth of the far-famed Nipigon
Ri ver and a week or so spent here
is an ideal prelude to the Great
Lakes trip. Good fishing offers
close by the camp and St. Ignace
Island where square tailed brook
trout and lake trout literally
abound. The camp has an ade-
quate supply of launches, canoes,
camping equipment and fishing
tackle and, in addition, a staff of
competent Indian Guides is main-
tained. Tennis, swimming and
dancing are also features of camp
life at Nipigon.
Then there is French River
Chalet-Bungalow Camp, beloved of
fishermen in every Province in the
Dominion and every state in the
Union to the South. The camp is
on the Canadian Pacific 45 miles
south of Sudbury.
The fishing possibilities include
fighting black bass, big savage
“muskies,” pickerel and great
northern pike. And there’s golf,
too, for you have full privileges on
a 9-hole, privately owned course
hewn out of the forest. Then there
is the outlying camp at Pine Rapids
which you reach by launch and
canoe. Two thirds of French
River’s business is repeat business.

Royal York Hotel, Toronto
Niagara Falls
Parliament Buildings, Ottawa
Toronto. Toronto is the capital
and chief city of the prosperous
Province of Ontario, and is growing
rapidly in population, wea. Ith and
industry. Beautifully situated on
the shore of Lake Ontario, its
inhabitants have an affectionate
name for it in “The Queen City”—
a fitting name when one considers
the beauty of its tree-girt boule-
vards, its gracious residences and
delightful parks. It is noted not
least of all for its great fall, "Fair,”
attended each year by over two
million visitors.
At Toronto is the magnificent
new Canadian Pacific hotel, the
Royal York — the largest hotel in
the British Empire. Despite its
enormity, the Royal York pre-
serves that atmosphere of comfort
and restful charm so characteristic
of all Canadian Pacific Hotels. A
fine golf course is operated by the
Royal York Hotel Golf Club for the
guests’ convenience.
Niagara Falls. If you would see
the great cataract at Niagara, you
may sail there or take the Toronto,
Hamilton and Buffalo Railway
through the beauteous Niagara
peninsula. And if you have the
rare fortune to pass through its
endless reaches of orchards at
blossom time a vista of overwhelm-
ing loveliness awaits you. The
Falls itself! Mere words can never
describe the majesty of that ter-
rific sweep of water that thunders
down from Lake Erie and roars
along the Great Gorge.
Ottawa. Capital of the Dominion
of Canada, Ottawa is easily acces-
sible by Canadian Pacific main lines
from Montreal or Toronto. Here an
entirely different spectacle may
attend you. The opening of the
Federal Parliament is a glittering-
function, carried out with all the
pomp and circumstance of West-
minster on a smaller scale.
Majestically enthroned upon a
high bluff looking across the Ottawa
River to the Laurentian Mountains,
the stately Gothic buildings of the
Houses of Parliament are a worthy
setting for Canadian Government.
And out of them rises the beautiful
Peace Tower, containing the world's
largest carillon.
In Ottawa is situated Rideau
Hall, the official residence of the
Governor-General. It is the centre
of the city's brilliant social life.
Other points of interest include the
War Memorial Chapel, the Royal
.Mint, the Victoria Museum, the
enormous pulp and paper indus-
tries in Lower Town. Miles upon
miles of beautiful driveways abound.


Montreal. Montreal, with a
population of over a million, is the
largest city of Canada and the
second largest port of North
America. Two-thirds of its inhabi-
tants speak French as their mother
tongue and all public notices are
printed in both French and English.
Indeed this gallic element is largely
responsible for the city's charm.
From Mount Royal, after which the
city was named, Montreal appears
spread out like an immense relief
map. One may spend hours on the
summit of this mountain gazing on
the splendid panorma of the city
and the St. Lawrence River, which
here is more than a mile’wide.
There are many sights to visit in
Montreal— the magnificent Notre
Dame Church, the interesting
Notre Dame de Bonsecours, McGill
University, Mount Royal, the old
historic Chateau de Ramezay.
beautiful parks, charming suburbs,
the docks, the French section, and

Quebec. From Montreal it is less
than five hours' ride over the
Canadian Pacific Railway to Que-
bec, a quaint old world city which
the fingers of modernism have
touched but lightly. Capital of the
Province, Quebec is the seat of
authority of French culture in the
New World. On the Plains of
Abraham outside the city walls
Wolfe and Montcalm battled for
mastery in this fair land. But the
old enmity between French and
British has been, forgotten and a
pillar in the Governor's Garden on
Dufferin Terrace jointly commem-
orates the two great warriors.
Centre of the social life of the
city is the Canadian Pacific's
great hostelry, the Chateau Fron-
tenac. Superbly placed over-
looking the broad sweep of the St.
Lawrence, the Chateau stands on
the site of the old Chateau St.
Louis, residence of the French
governors. The Norman spirit has
been preserved in this great hotel
and its turreted roofs fit well into
the Quebec picture.
Montreal and Quebec are the two
great Canadian ports of departure
for Europe. Situated respectively
970 and 832 miles from the open
sea, they are actually nearer than
New York to Liverpool, Southamp-
ton and other European ports.
Leader of the Canadian Pacific
trans-Atlantic fleet is the huge, new
Empress of Britain, holder of all
existing speed records between the
American continent and Europe.
