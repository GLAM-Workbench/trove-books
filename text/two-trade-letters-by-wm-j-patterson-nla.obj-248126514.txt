CAN OUR COMMERCE WITH THE AUSTRALIAN
COLONIES BE INCREASED?
Andrew Robertson, Esq.,
President Board of Trade;
Hugh McLennan, Esq.,
President Corn Exchange Association ,
Some particulars were given in my “ Annual Report of the Trade and
Commerce of Montreal, for 1870,” respecting the commercial relations of the
Dominion with the different British Colonial Possessions, and information was
presented relative to the practicability of increasing Canadian trade with the
West Indies as well as with Australia. Permit me at the beginning of this
communication—which I venture to address to you as representing the tw«
Commercial Boards in this city — to repeat one or two of the paragraphs, .which v, »
do notjeem jto be date ydt:— v, m
-wJ(M (Wt '
The direct trade between Canada (via the River Bt. Lawrence) arid Australia has
heretofore been in small compass, and, of course, irregular in its character, —consist-
ing almost entirely of lumber. It is hardly worth while to particularize. One cargo of
lumber was dispatched from Montreal to Melbourne in each of the years 1867,1868 and
1870, —besides some trial shipments from other ports,—an assorted cargo having,
not long since, been sent by rail from Ottawa to the seaboard for the same destina-
tion. By referring to Table E, on pages 132 and 133, the reader will find a detailed
statement of exports, the growth, produce, and manufacture of the United States, to
the Australian Possessions, which shows the aggregate value in 1867 to have been
$5,102,353; in 1868, $4,848,984, and in 1869, $4,619,313.
An examination of the articles enumerated will also show that many of them
are the growth, produce and manufacture of British North America; and the in-
quiry naturally arises,—Cannot our trade relations be increased with our Colonial
kinsfolk at the Antipodes?
Nature of the Trade. —Beginning with timber as the most important, the con-
sumption of this material is very large, particularly in Victoria, where all the indige- ;
nous woods are extremely hard, involving great expense in working them. The |
northern part of New Zealand produces a valuable species of pine, called Courie ;
this is almost exclusively used in that colony, and some is exported to Melbourne
and Sydney, but the appliances for preparing it for market are so inferior to those


of Canada, that the difference in cost is greater than that of freight. Queensland,,
and some of the northern rivers of New South Wales, also produce a pine, but in-
ferior to the courie, and only small quantities find their way to the Melbourne mar-
ket, and this chiefly in the log. Cedar, the produce of New South Wales and
Queensland, is imported into Melbourne to a considerable extent; this is an orna-
mental wood, soft, easily worked, and takes a polish equal to mahogany, which it
very much resembles; it is used for furniture and ornamental in-door work. Thefe
are other woods of this description brought from Tasmania. These latter are men-
tioned, because it has been asked whether Canadian ornamental woods would com-
mand a sale, and it should be known what they would have to compete with.
Foreign timber is imported from the Baltic in the form of deals, from English
and Scotch ports as deals and flooring boards, and from Oregon as lumber and Togs.
The timber shipped from the Eastern States is chiefly, if not all, Canadian; and
the timber merchants of the Dominion are suffering those of the United States to
make a profit in the Australian market, which, by a little enterprise on the part of
Canadians, might be secured to themselves. Shipments from Canada via the St.
Lawrence, it is true, are not practicable at all seasons, —neither are they from the
Baltic; yet, those interested m the trade send large quantities thence, when the
ports are open.
Kerosene Oil is, perhaps, the next article which could be profitably shipped to any
extent. The Australian market is now entirely supplied from the United States;
but, as the Canadian product can be refined into a quality equal to that from the
States, there is no reason why it should not form an important branch of the Cana-
dian trade.
Dried Fish, in limited quantities, might also enter into the catalogue of Canadian
exports to the colonies; but discretion would have to be exercised, because the con-
sumption is necessarily limited; —the article being also a perishable one.
Return Cargoes. —Respecting return cargoes for vessels proceeding from the St.
Lawrence, say to Melbourne, with timber and other freight, it may be safely as-
sumed that there is no probability of such a thing at present. The exports thence
consist mainly of gold, copper-ore, wool, tallow, skins, hides, leather and bark, ail
of which find, perhaps, a better market in England, than they would in Canada.
This, however, is only an apparent disadvantage,—the vessels proceeding from the
United States having to encounter the same obstacles, except in very rare instances.
The course usually pursued by ships arriving from America, is to proceed to New-
castle, New South Wales, and load coals for China, California, or other leading
ports in eastern countries, either on freight or on ship’s account.
Customs Duties. —All timber imported into Victoria pays an ad valorem duty of
per cent., charged on net invoice value, with 10 per cent, added, except logs of one
foot square and upwards, which are free. Oil is subject to a duty of 3d. per gallon.
There is a further charge for wharfage ; that on timber is 3s. per 40 cubic feet, and
thaton oil 3d. per case of 1 foot to 3 feet cubic, and 6d. per case of 3 feet to 6 feet.
Rates of Freight. —Freight is an item of expense, especially on timber, which
forms an important element in the calculation ofprolit. It is feared that rates from
Montreal or Quebec would be higher than from iNew York or Boston, because many
miscellaneous articles are shipped from the latter ports, enabling shippers to engage
Jarge vessels at proportionately lower rates than small ones could be obtained at.
Now, as the question of finding new markets for Canadian produce and
manufactures, or enlarging the trade with old ones, has been, and still is, chal-
lenging a good deal of attention, it has seemed to me that a little service might
be rendered to the Members of your respective Boards, and to the mercantile
community generally, by bringing together, in compact form, some of the Official
information to which I have had access, showing the extent and character of the
trade of the West Indies, and also of the Australian Colonies. Of course, I
do not intend to give a categorical answer to the question which has been placed


at the head of this letter; but I hope to be able to help those who may be specially
interested to say aye or nay for themselves, taking all circumstances into account.
I am, however, free to say that it ought to be much easier to enlarge Canadian
trade*with the West Indies and Brazil, than to initiate direct trade relations
with Australia, on account of our proximity to the two former, and because
the requisite financial and [other arrangements for satisfactorily conducting the
business already exist;—while the distance from the St. Lawrence to the
Antipodes, and the circumstance of the Australian trade being very largely
controlled by old-established firms in Great Britain, seem to be obstacles that
may not be easily surmounted. These considerations would have induced
me to give attention first to particulars about the West Indies (especially the
British possessions) ; but, as all the desired information is not yet at hand,
what I have relating to Australia is, in the meantime, herein presented. I
purpose addressing you hereafter, relative to trade with the West Indies.
I have, then, to request an examination of the accompanying tables, which
have been collated with a good deal of care from ofiicial sources. (1.) 1 able A.,
on pages 14,15, shows the values in Sterling money, severally, of the imports and
exports of the Colonies mentioned in it, also the aggregate trade of each, the
figures being compiled from Colonial returns, and the period including twentj-
one years. (2.) Table 8., on pages! 6, 17, contains a careful compilation of the
Customs Duties levied in each of the Colonies mentioned, upon the principal
articles imported. (3.) Table C., on pages 18-23, shows the quantities
and values of principal articles of merchandise, the produce or manufacture
■of the United Kingdom, exported annually to each of the Colonies mentioned
during a period of five years, the figures being taken from the Trade Returns
published by the British Government. And (4.) Table D., at the end, shows the
quantities and values of the various articles of merchandise, the produce or
manufacture of the United States, exported annually to Australia (Colonies
not particularized as in Table C.,) during a period of seven years, the information
being kindly furnished by Dr. Edward Aoung, Chief of the Statistical Bureau
at Washington, D.C.
Perhaps an examination of these Tables might suffice, in most instances, to
enable merchants and manufacturers to judge for themselves, whether the differ-
ent articles and quantities offer inducement enough to make the experiment of
competing for a share of the trade with the merchants of Great Britain and the
United States worth trying. I observe, however, that in some respects the infor-
mation in Tables C. and D. is not sufficiently detailed, if I may judge from par-
ticulars which are given with seeming accuracy in Colonial returns; a brief
analysis of the Tables, therefore, may be of some interest.
AGGREGATE VALUES OF AUSTRALIAN COMMERCE.
Ist. As regards the first of the series of tables (A), it seems only neces-


sary to remark that it is so framed as to show at a glance the annual varia-
tions in values of the imports, exports, and aggregate trade, in Sterling
money, during a period of twenty-one years, figures for 1856 to 1859 being
passed over. Commercially speaking, Victoria is the Premier Colony. The
largest amount of business for Tasmania was, remarkably enough, in 1854;
for Victoria, in 1874 ; for New South Wales, in 1874; for South Australia, in
1873 ; for Queensland, in 1874 ; and for New Zealand, in 1874. Comparisons
for West Australia arc omitted, tor want of sufficient data. The aggregate
trades of these Colonies for 1854 and 1874 were as follows:
Aggregates, 1854. Aggregates, 1874,
Tasmania £ 4,037,701 £ 2,183,110
Victoria 29,434,255 32,395,094
New South Wales 10,031,189 19,794,292
South Australia 3,469,929 8,386,147
Queensland 6,583,862
New Zealand 1,212,092 13,373,081
£ 82,715,586
The sum of these aggregates for 1874 shows an increase over 1854 of
7166 per cent.
TRADE BETWEEN GREAT BRITAIN AND AUSTRALIA.
2nd. Passing over the Table of Tariffs (B.) on pages 13, 14, and referring
to Table C, on pages 18-23, the following summary shows concisely how much
of the trade of the Colonies mentioned was done by the merchants of the
United Kingdom, in 1874 :
Imported by U. K. Exported from U. K. Total British trade.
Tasmania £ 439,359 £384,229 £ 823,588
Victoria 6,993,052 7,573,526 14,566,578
New South Wales.... 3,900,044 4,778,276 8,678,320
South Australia 2,592,463 2,097,525 4,689,988
Queensland 898,831 941,971 1,840,802
New Zealand 4,673,275 8,215,374
With the exception of Tasmania and South Australia, British merchants-
exported more merchandise than they imported in the year 1874. It must be
stated, however, that the figures in Table A, from Colonial sources, include gold
coin and bullion, while the official British lleturns given here do not include
them. The importations of bullion and coin into Great Britain from Australia
(Colonies not particularised) during five years were as follows:
Bullion iu ounces. Total Coin and Bullion in ounces.
1871 1,409.883 1.724,457
1872 1.234.019 1.495,514
1873 1,576.056 2,363,589
1874 1.200,524 1.681.082
1875 965,874 1.658,565
For the sake of perspicuity, I submit the following analysis:—The Ist
column of figures shows the total importations into each Colony in 1874, that


bciti" the latest year for which 1 have full statements in Colonial Returns; the
2nd'column shows exportations from the United Kingdom to each Colony in
same year ; the 3rd column gives the percentage of British exports to total
imports; and the 4th column shows the percentage of Colonial commerce carried
on with the United Kingdom :

COMMERCIAL INTERCOURSE BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND AUSTRALIA.
Special attention is requested to Table D, showing in detail, for seven years,
quantities and values of merchandise exported from the United States to Aus-
tralia. The information has been printed in full in the attached slip, rather than
in pages, that parties interested might the more easily refer to it; for the document
may be taken as showing more in detail the nature of the trade with Australia in
which the merchants of the Dominion might most reasonably hope to participate.
It will be observed, however, that while the Table is valuable in its details, as com-
pared with the summaries of exports from Great Britain,—there is an aspect in
which the comparison is less favorable, viz.: that the particular Colony is not
mentioned to which merchandise from the United States is carried. There are
some points incident to the statement in question which are worthy of notice
here ; and the first one is that, according to the official figures, the export trade
of the United States to Australia has decreased within the past ten years. The
annual values of exportations were as follows;
1867 $5,102,353
1868 4,848,984
1869 4,619,313
1870 3,419,973

1874 3,785,908
1875 3,505,435
1876 3,884,866
These figures show the average annual value of the merchandise exported
from the United States to Australia during the period, to have amounted to
$3,835,325 ; while the difference between the value of exports in 1867 and 1876
is $1,217,487, or a decrease of 23-86 per cent.
The expoitation of Breadstuffs from the United States to Australia appears
to have shrunk out of sight within the past decade. The values of Flour and
Wheat shipped were as follows:
Brls. of Flour. Bushels of Wheat.

It will be seen from these figures, that the average for the period is 2,418,-
094 gallons, the shipments in 1876 being 104,000 gallons under that average.
The values of shipments of Agricultural Implements from the
United States to Australia, during ten years, were as follows:
It would also seem as if the United States trade with Australia in this
class of merchandise has not been maintained, the annual average value
in the first five years of the decade being $83,389, and of the second
five $56,561.
Without analyzing further, I need only call attention to the articles exported
under the head of “ Iron and Steel manufactures,” especially Nails, Spikes, and
Edge Tools. The particulars under the head of Provisions, —also Wood and its
Manufactures, deserve careful notice*
DEMAND IN AUSTRALIA FOR AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS.
While it may not be said, from the information herein adduced,
that importations of Agricultural Implements into the Colonies have
been large in value, compared with certain other lines of merchandise,
it is nevertheless well understood that the agricultural resources of
Australia are yet in embiyo, and only now under process of develop-
ment. One of the Colonial Commissioners to the Centennial Exhibition
informed me, in Philadelphia, that there is a growing demand for almost
every description of farming tools'and machinery, and that the exhibits
of Canadian implements have attracted very considerable attention. The
opportunity for observation afforded by' that Exhibition will enable
manufacturers themselves to determine on the best description of imple-
ments required by agriculturalists in the Colonies, —and Australia will
undoubtedly" afford a vast outlet for the best, and only the best kinds.
The bulk of the various descriptions of implements and machinery as
set up in working order, would seem to make the freight-item a some-
what formidable obstacle to the development of trade with these
distant regions; but of course the manufactured parts can be packed for
transportation in comparatively small compass.
Of the articles said to be most in demand a few only can be par-
ticularized, viz: Corn Planters, Hand Seed-Sowers, Combined Reapers
and Mowers, Small Threshers, Hay Cutters, Railway" Horse Powers,
Shingle and Heading Machines. [With reference to a Diagonal Straw-
Cutter, one of the exhibits from Ontario, I was told by" an Australian
gentleman that there would be no risk in sending 409 or 500 of them in


the earliest shipments from Canada to the Colonies.] A cheap strong
Brick-making Machine would sell well. Small and moderately priced
Planers and Matchers, Scroll Saws, and the most improved Wood-Working
Machinery could be easily and extensively sold; while ingenious house-
hold goods and appliances of recent patent would find a ready market.
STATEMENTS ABOUT OTHER LINES OF MERCHANDISE.
In the foregoing considerations, I have mainly made use of figures from three
sources: —the Trade Returns of the United Kingdom, a Statement received from
the United States Statistical Bureau, and abstracts of the Colonial official records.
From what can be gathered from the two first-mentioned sources, an adequate
estimate of particular lines which occupy a prominent place in the Australian
commerce could hardly be arrived at. For example, —in 1874, Boots and Shoes,
to the extent of 180,744 dozen pairs, valued at £556,902, were shipped from the
United Kingdom to Australia,—from the United States only 25 pairs, valued
a t —while the Colonial records shew importations in that year to the value
of £B42,s4l,—leaving £275,639 unexplained, so far as available information
is concerned, but possibly accounted for by intercolonial trade, Mr. Morris
having stated at the meeting in this city on 23rd August, that “ in New South
Wales they produced boots very cheaply, but they were for stock farmers, and
sold at 6s. 6d.; but they made no high class goods.” Other articles might be
examined in the same way ; but, as this communication is already too long, 1
forbear, —confining ..myself to selecting a few items worthy of notice, from
returns of Imports into some of the Colonies, in the year 1874.

volume of “ Transactions,” speaks approvingly of the native Australian Wines,
and considers a large exportation as not unlikely in the future.

ARTICLES.


According to the foregoing table, the only manufactured article sent
{Sewing Machines) in each year was from the Province of Ontario. All
the fish sent were shipped from British Columbia, representing $3,677 in
1873; $32,771 in 1874; and $32,385 in 1875. The remaining articles—
produce of the Forest—were solely from British Columbia in 1873,
showing $34,706; but in the two succeeding years the shipments were
as follows in 1874, Quebec $7,629 ; British Columbia, $52,452 ; total
$60,081. In 1875, Quebec, $22,446 ; British Columbia, $124,736 ; total
$147,182.
A PRACTICAL SUGGESTION
It appeal’s from what has been submitted in this communication (1.)
That the Australian trade is great, valuable, and diversified; (2.) That
a large number of the articles comprising that trade are such as are pro-
duced or manufactured in the Dominion ; and (3.) The natural inference
is, that, with a view to participating in that trade, the conditions to be
kept in view are quality and price of commodities, and facility of inter-
course.
Perhaps the most effective way to tap the commerce of the Australian
Colonies would, in the first instance, be for manufacturers and merchants
interested in the movement to establish a “ Canadian Venturers’ Associa-
tion for promoting Trade with Australia.” The lines of merchandise
mentioned in the Tables indicate with sufficient clearness who might
be the Venturers. Were a thorough business-man, —one personally con-
versant with the trade interests of these Colonies, —appointed to act as
Agent of such a body of men, each assisting to meet the requirements of
the people there, he could give special attention to the interests of the
Members of the Association, and generally do much to extend the com-
mercial relations of Canada in that far-off region. The success or failure
of the enterprise would, in fact, depend almost entirely upon the character
and intelligence of the Agent. Obstacles would have to be surmounted;
such a Eepresentative, with plenary power, would be best qualified to
accomplish the task; and there can hardly be a doubt that the present is
a good time to make a systematic effort in that direction. It may be
expedient for Government to assist in sending “ exhibits ” to Sydney ; but
the trade relations that may exist hereafter between the Dominion and
Australia must be initiated, established and maintained on business
principles by the mei’chants and manufacturers themselves. It is gratify-
ing to know that facilities are now to be afforded for the immediate
transportation of merchandise; and I may be allowed to express the


hope that the “ Ocean Gem,” soon to sail from the port of Montreal, may,,
be the pioneer ship in a trade that shall yet involve large values of
exchange between the people of the Dominion and their colonial brethren
at the Antipodes.
I am, Gentlemen,
Your obedient servant,
WM. J. PATTERSON,
Secretary.
Montreal, 30th September, 1876.

WHAT IS THE COMMERCIAL OUTLOOK ?
CAN THERE BE AN ENLARGEMENT OF OUR TRADE RELA-
TIONS WITH THE WEST INDIES AND SOUTH AMERICA ?

Secretary Board of Trade and Corn Exchange Association.

WHAT IS THE COMMERCIAL OUTLOOK ?
CAN THERE BE AN ENLARGEMENT OF OUR TRADE RELA
TIONS WITH THE WEST INDIES AND SOUTH AMERICA ?
Andrew Robertson, Esq.,
President Board of Trade;
Hugh McLennan, Esq.,
President Corn Exchange Association;
Gentlemen :
As stated in the “ Trade Letter ” about Australia, I now address you
on a subject of more immediate interest and importance,—the extension
of commercial relations with our fellow-Colonists and others who live
much nearer us than our friends at the Antipodes. A moment’s reflection
will satisfy you that the subject of the present communication involves a
somewhat wider range of discussion than the former one, leading occa-
sionally (and, as I think, necessarily) to the expression of views which
may possibly not pass without evoking more or less criticism. I must
say, therefore, that I write from a purely commercial stand-point,
from a middle-ground, so to speak, between the general questions
of “protection” and “free-trade,” and, therefore, without refer-
ence to class-interests or party-relations of any kind; that I will
fry to be concise,—at the same time perspicuous; and that I will
consider myself well repaid if this self-imposed labor of collecting and
arranging the following materials, shall contribute in any way to induce
a thorough consideration of the questions inscribed over this epistle.
The only personal matter is, whether I ought voluntarily to incur the
charge of temerity in broaching a subject, in connection with which the
opinions of many intelligent men differ so widely; it may still be some


excuse for their utterance to state that they have grown and gathered
strength in my own mind during much of the time I have been Secretary
of your respective Boards.
NATURE, MAGNITUDE AND VARIETY OF THE TRADE
A clause in the instructions given by the Canadian Government to
their Representatives on the West India Commission in 1865 is as fol-
lows :
“ Knowing then that the countries to which you are about to proceed offer a
market for all the surplus products of British North America, and that they can
afford us in exchange all the productions of the Tropics, it is most desirable that
an effort should be made to remove the artificial obstructions which exist to free
commercial intercourse.”
That is to say, the merchants of Canada can supply Fish, Flour,
Meals, Peas, Butter, Cheese, Lard, Preserved Meats, Coal, Ice, Box-
shooks, Lumber, Petroleum, &c., —also manufactures of wood, wool,
&c., —while the people of the West Indies and South America
can give in return Sugars, Molasses, Coffee, Spices, Rum, Tobacco, &c.;
and not only so, but, as has been well said, the West Indies and
Canada respectively are “ the cheapest and best markets in which to
purchase.”
At the meeting of the Dominion Board of Trade, at Ottawa, in Febru-
ary, 1874, A. Woods, Esq., of Quebec, in a paper on Trade with the West
Indies, made the following among other statements :
“ When we remember that the average total imports by the British and Foreign
West Indies are in round figures valued at about $200,000,000, and their exports at
near $230,000,000 annually, the fact that the portion of the trade participated in by
this Dominion is small indeed must strike any person conversant with our natural
resources. Wooden-ware, shingles, staves, box shocks, starch, sewing machines,
biscuits, boots and shoes, as well as many other manufactures, besides the leading
staples of the farm, the dairy, the oil wells and fisheries, can be shipped from the
Dominion to the West Indies at prices to compete with any country. Lumber, in
its variety of manufactures, as well as the great bulk of the other articles which we
have already noted, can be put on board a sea-going vessel at the Port of Quebec
much cheaper than at New York. By utilizing our unrivalled line of interior
water communication with the West, we can lay down its products in the markets
of the West Indies on better terms than can the United States, where they have to
make use of long interior lines of railroad and canal communication before reaching
a shipping port.”
It is, therefore, worth while at the outset to point out how great is the
volume of the West India and South American trade, and to what a com-
paratively small extent Canada participates in a commerce so aptly
referred to in the foregoing quotations.
A series of tabular statements (A. Nos. I to Till, on pp. 33-35) show
the annual value, in pounds Sterling, of the trade between Great
Britain and the West Indies and South America, respectively, during


the past decade, —indicating also the fluctuations which have occurred.
To assist in comprehending the summaries referred to, I will point out
liere their salient features: —
Table A, No- I,— Shows the average annual commerce of Great Britain with The
Bermudas for ten (10) years, to be £68,310 ; the largest trade in the decade vas
in 1866, the value amounting to £89,740 ; but the trade of 1875 shows a decrease,
as compared with that of 1866, of £26,624 or 29.78 per cent. The figures in
the table also show that, except in the year 1866, the exports from Great
Britain constantly exceeded the Imports.
Table A, No. 7/,—Shows the average annual commerce of Great Britain with the
British West India Islands, including British Guiana and Honduras, for ten
(10) years, to be £9,938,919; the largest trade in the decade was in 1875, the
value amounting to £10,942,313, being an increase as compared with that of
1866, of £1,297,164 or 13-45 per cent. The figures in the table also show that
all of these Imports into Great Britain largely exceeded the Domestic Exports.
Table A, No. 777,—Shows the average annual commerce of Great Britain with the
Spanish West India Islands, for ten (10) years, to be £6,945,519 the largest
trade in the decade was in 1872, the value amounting to £8,706,823; but the
trade of 1875 shows an increase as compared with that of 1866, of £1,291,792 or
24'04 per cent. The figures in the table also show that the Imports into Great
Britain were always in excess of the Exports, except in 1871.
Table A, No. IV,— Shows the average annual commerce of Great Britain with the
French West India Islands and French Guiana, for ten (10) years, to be
£84,868 ; the largest trade in the decade was in 1875, the value amounting to
£309,149, being an increase, as compared with that of 1866, of £278,144 or 8-97
per cent. The figures in the tables also show that, with the exception of the
years 1870 and 1874, the Exports from Great Britain exceeded the Imports-
Table A, No. V,— Shows the average annual commerce of Great Britain with Hayti
and San Domingo for ten (10) years, to be £700,275 ; the largest trade in the
decade was in 1875, the value amounting to £1,159,720, being an increase, as
compared with that of 1866, of £447,647 or 42'73 per cent. The figures in the
table also show that, except in the year 1869, the Exports from Great Britain
regularly exceeded the Imports.
Table A, No. Vl Shows the average annual commerce of Great Britain with the
Danish West India Islands, for ten (10) years, to be £564,293; the largest
trade in the decade was in 1866, the value amounting to £87.>,517 ; the trade of
1875 shows a decrease as compared with 1866, of £439,840 or 50.35 per cent.
The figures in the table also show that the Domestic Exports from Great
Britain were uniformly in excess of the Imports-
Table A, No. VII— Shows the average annual commerce of Great Britain with the
Dutch West India Islands, including Dutch Guiana, for ten (10) years, to be
£435,719; the largest trade in the decade was in 1872, the value amounting to
£808,997 ; the trade of 1875 shows an increase as compared with that of 1866, of
£49,634 or 16'64 per cent. The figures in the table also show that the Domes-
tic Exports from Great Britain always exceeded the Imports.
Table A, No- VIII— Shows the average annual commerce of Great Britain with
Brazil, Uruguay, Argentine Republic and Venezuela, for ten (10) years, to


be £21,486,266; the largest trade in the decade was in 1872, the value amount-
ing to £27,1 <3,078 ; the trade of 1875 shows a decrease, as compared with that
of 1866, of £917,842 or 4'15 per cent. The figures in the table also show that
except in the year 1868, the Exports from Great Britain regularly exceeded the
Imports.
Another series of Tables (B, Nos. I to VI, on pp. 36-38,) show the
annual value, in Dollars, of the trade between the United States and
the West Indies and South America respectively during the past thirteen
years,—indicating also the fluctuations that have occurred. The promi-
nent characteristics of the trade are shown to have been as follows:
Table B, No. I,— Shows the average annual commerce of the United States with
the British West Indies, British Guiana, and Honduras, for thirteen (13>
years, to be $15,519,553; the largest trade of that period was in 1872, the
value amounting to $18,347,413; the trade of 1875 shows an increase over 1863
of $4,462,553 or 36-30 per cent. Only in one year (1872) did the Imports
into the United States exceed the value of Domestic Exports.
Table B, No. ll,— Shows the average annual commerce of the United States with
Cuba, Porto Rico, and other Spanish Possessions, for thirteen (13) years,
to be $85,009,113 ; the largest trade of that period was in 1874, the value
amounting to $123,495,090 ; the trade of 1875 shows an increase over 1863 of
$61,915,4790r 142-81 percent. The figures in the table also show, that the
Imports into the United States immensely exceeded the Exports throughout
that period.
Table B, No. Ill,— Shows- the average annual commerce of the United States'with
French Possessions in America (French West Indies) for thirteen (13) years,
to be $2,136,062; the largest trade of that period was in 1872, the value
amounting to $3,798,117; the trade of 1875 shows an increase, as compared
with that of 1863, of $2,207,750 or 1.73 per cent. The figures in the table also
show, that the Exports from the United States were in excess of the Imports
excepting in the years 1871, 1872, 1874 and 1875.
Table B, No. IV,— Shows the average annual commerce of the United States with
DANISH WEST INDIA Islands ’ hr thirteen (13) years, to be
$2,237,940. Unfortunately this table is not as clear as the others, as the Danish
West Indies were not separated from the country of Denmark in the United
States returns from which these figures are compiled. The largest trade of
that period was in 1871, the value amounting to $3,209,162 ; the trade of 1875
shows an increase, as compared with 1863, of $939,195 or 61-49 per cent. The
figures in the table also show, that the Exports from the United States largely
exceeded the Imports throughout the period.
Table B, No. V,— Shows the average annual commerce of the United States with
the Dutch West Indies for thirteen (13) years, to be $1,986,825; the largest
trade of that period was in 1874, the value amounting to $2,687,691 ; the trade
of 1875 shows an increase, as compared with that of 1863, of $791,931 or 43-33
per cent. The figures in the table also show, that the Imports into the United
, States exceeded the Exports from same, in 1863, ’69 and ’7l to ’75.


Table B, No, VI, — Shows the average annual commerce of the United States with
Brazil, Argentine Republic, Uruguay, and Venezuela, for thirteen (13)
years, to he $45,384,086 ; the largest trade of that period was in 1874, the
value amounting to $70,443,921; the trade of 1875 shows an increase, as
compared with that of 1863, of $46,418,032, or 199-66 per cent. The figures in
the table also show, that the Imports into the United States were greatly in
excess of the Exports during that period.
But for practical business purposes, it is desirable to come down from
this general view, —to look more to the details of that commerce as it
may be said to be passing before us now, —so as to afford matter for
stimulating reflection. For that purpose, I have collated some informa-
tion from the sources whence the materials for the above-mentioned
tables were drawn.
A GLANCE AT GREAT BRITAIN’S SHARE OF THE TRADE.
A reference to Table C p. 39, will show the quantities and values of
some of the articles of merchandize (the produce or manufacture of Great
Britain) exported to the West Indies and Brazil in the year 1875 ; and it
will be observed that many of the lines of goods are such as could have
been supplied from the Dominion. An examination, however, of the
British Trade Returns reveals the fact, that the shipments of Colonial
and Foreign produce to the same destinations include a variety of articles
of very considerable quantity and value, much of which may fairly be
supposed to be the produce of Canada. For instance, in addition to the
quantities and values of goods in Table C just referred to, the following
are some of the articles of Colonial and Foreign origin shipped in the same
Butter, cwts
Cheese, “
Oats, “
Cigars, lbs
Cordage, Twine and Cable Yarn.

year: —
There are many additional articles, which might reasonably have a
place in the foregoing, were it not that the particular destination is not
mentioned, being recorded as “to other countries.” It may easily be
inferred that nearly, if not all of the articles, would do no discredit to
Canada, without the brand or trade-mark of any firm either in the
United Kingdom or the United States ; and yet, as will be shown imme-
diately, the Canadian element in the vast commerce, (so far as the
records go) may be said to be a mere bagatelle.


HOW MUCH OF THE TRADE IS DONE BY THE UNITED STATES ?
I have selected the year 1874 as affording sufficiently recent
examples. The value of imports into, and exports from, the United States
to the several West India Possessions in that year are shown in the
following summary statement, —the entire volume of that trade amounting
to the very large sum of $145,416,483: —

In marked -contrast to the immense commerce involved in these
figures (making due allowance for disparity of population, and leaving
entirely out of view Great Britain’s share of the trade) the total trade
of the Dominion of Canada with the West Indies, including imports and
exports, only amounted in the same year (1874) to $6,057,129. To this
rather derogatory comparison must be added the fact, that the figures for
1874 show a decrease, as compared with 1872, of $62,538, or a fraction
over one per cent., the Dominion imports and exports in the latter year
amounting to $6,119,667. It must be further stated that the Provinces
which now constitute the Dominion imported in 1864- 65 direct from the
British and Foreign West Indies, merchandize valued at $3,353,719, and
exported to the value of $3,287,327, —in all, $6,641,046. The decreased
value of the aggregate trade in 1874, therefore, as contrasted -with 1864-
’65 was $583,917, or 8‘79 per cent.
The statement which follows here shows the total trade of the United
States in 1874 with South America, the aggregate being $88,517,767,
while the Dominion trade with that Empire was nil , on the record.

A large sheet Table (D) at the end of this letter, shows in detail the
quantities and values of the various commodities exported to the West
Indies and South America by the United States in 1874, which is well
worth examination, as establishing the accuracy of the statement made
to the Canadian Commissioners, already quoted. The ai’ticles mainly
imported by the United States from the West Indies and South America
are as followsmedicinal and cork barks, chemicals, drugs, dyes,
cocoa, cochineal, coffee, raw cotton, hair (unmanufactured), hides
and skins, crude india rubber and gutta percha, rags, woods
(unmanufactured), copper (in pigs, bars, &c.,) fruits, nuts, old and
scrap iron, lead (pigs, bars and old), whale and fish oils, olive oil
(salad), salt, spices, ginger, pepper, mustard, sugar and molasses, leaf
tobacco, cigars, spirits and cordials, wines, and wool. And, if further
corroboration of the statement to the Commissioners is necessary, it is
afforded by Tables E and F, (on pp. 40-41) which show quantities and
values of Dominion imports and exports for the same year.
In addition to the particulars detailed in Table E, the following
items must be added to complete the total import exhibit, viz. : From
British Guiana, 1143 gallons rum, valued at $611; 6,373 lbs. sugar,
equal to and above No. 9 D. S. (old tariff), valued at $3Ol ; i 4,635 lbs.
Molasses, other than for refining purposes, valued at $1,289. From the
Dutch West Indies, 856,319 lbs. sugar, below No. 9 D. S., from April 10,
’75 (new tariff,) valued at $34,158.
Then, in addition to the particulars detailed in Table F, the follow,
ing items must be added to complete the total export exhibit, viz..
To Brazil, coal, 527 tons, valued at $1,317. To Mauritius, pickled mac-
kerel, 390 bids., $1,440; pickled herrings, 356 brls., $1,426; canned salmon,
3,600 lbs., $6OO ; pickled do. 150 bids., $1,640. To Dutch West Indies,
planks and hoards , 224,000 feet, $2,965 ; ditto to Dutch Guiana, 119,000
feet, $1,450. To Mauritius, spars, 1,017 pieces, $7,761; shingles, 200,000,
$400; tobacco, 5,401 lbs., $1,085. To Bermuda, hay, 32 tons, $368;
vegetables, $373.
Now, with the facts so clearly before us that the West Indies and
Brazil are, so to speak, our neighbors (see pp. 19-20 as to distances), that
their staple exports are exactly what Canadian merchants want, while
Dominion staples are precisely what the people of these countiies lack,
and would gladly take in profitable exchange, —(for, after all, trade means
profit, in some respect or other, to the parties concerned in buying, selling
and handling) —does it not seem wonderful that so small a proportion of
that great commercial current appears to flow to or from Canada ?
It must not be overlooked, however, that under the very general desig-


nation of “ Foreign Exports,” Canada should probably have credit, as
already hinted at, for a considerable share of the trade done directly by
Great Britain and the United States, —how large a proportion cannot be
determined from the printed records. For instance, after the letter on
Australian trade was made public, I was informed by a gentleman in
the trade, that two of the most extensive boot and shoe manufactories in
this city were at work upon large orders for London, the goods to be sent
thence to Australia, —also, that assorted lots of doors, sashes, &c., besides
lumber, had been shipped monthly, sometimes semi-monthly, via United
States ports for the same destination. It appears, further, that among
other merchandise, potatoes and sundry bulky articles of farm produce,
have lately been sent weekly from Halifax (by United States steamers) to
New York, and thence dispatched, nominally on account of merchants in
that city, to Cuba and other West India Islands. It is impossible to say
how much of the produce of the Dominion Fisheries follows the same
course to a tropical market. It must be quite evident, however, that in
this way Canada not only does not get credit for her interest in the
transactions, but that the means of employment for the tonnage of the
Maritime Provinces are diverted from their legitimate channel, to the
loss of vessel-owners, —while the property disposed of in this round-about
way, is made just so much dearer to the consumer by its intermediate
handling, by the astute United States middle-men. (For illustration,
see foot-note on page 18.) Apropos of this, I quote again from Mr.
Woods as follows :
There can be no doubt but that a large quantity of Canadian products find a
•ii t 111 topics through the hands of the U. S. shippers. One instance of this
will illustrate the truth. During the past two or three years large quantities of
match splints, manufactured in Quebec, have been shipped to New Haven, New York
and other American centres, where they have been dipped and afterwards shipped
to liarbadoes and other West India Islands. Thus the U. S. manufacturer pro-
cures the bulk of his raw material here, pays inland R. R. freight, customs duty of
d 5 per cent., completes the manufacture of the article, employing labor at 100 per
cent, higher than with us, and then ships to the places named at a profit.
lo show how this trade has slipped from us, it may be noted that box shooks,
winch at one time were shipped in quantity from Quebec, and later on from St.
John, have latterly, to a large extent, been shipped from New York, in consequence
otthe greater facilities for procuring freight room at the latter port. Box shocks
are now shipped from Canada to New York in canal boats, and there stored, and
afterwards shipped to the West Indies. One recent instance is known of a Quebec
house having shipped a quantity of this article to Portland, where they were pur-
chased for New York acceptance and thence forwarded.”
These facts are suggestive enough, if not startling. If such a con-
dition of affairs should continue, how many years, it might be asked,
would have to elapse ere the status of the people of Canada would be
reduced to that of mercantile Gibeonites, —mere hewers of wood and
drawers of water to the merchant-princes of other lands ?—how long ere


our industrial and commercial record would be obliterated ?—and how
long ere this vast Dominion would become (practically, at any rate) an
appanage of the neighboring Republic, with the uninspiring knowledge
that all their fiscal arrangements are dead against their tributaries ?
TRADE WITH THE SPANISH WEST INDIES.
The West India Commissioners gave in their Report the following
statement of the general average annual value of importations of the
various kinds of merchandize, into the Spanish West India Possessions :
Wines and oils $13,000,000
Meats 13,000,000
Grains 10,000,000
Fish 4,000,000
Flour 14,000,000
Cither food 6,000,000
$ 60,000,000
Manufactures of Cotton 7,500,000
Linen 8,500,000
Wool 2,000,000
Silk 2,500,000
Furs 4,500,000
Wood 10,000,000
Furniture 1,500,000
Earthenware 1,500,000
Stoneware 1,500,000
Glassware 1,000,000
$ 40,500,000
Metals 17,000,000
Miscellaneous 26,000,000
$143,500,000
And these figures were coupled with this very pertinent remark:- —
“ Being large consumers of the products of British North America, so large,,
indeed, as to offer a market for the entire present surplus of our principal staples,
it would seem to require no other argument to convince us that we ought to nego-
ciate, if possible, such commercial arrangements as will ensure a direct and lasting
trade between the Spanish West Indies and these Provinces.”
In 1868, Senor H. de Uriarte (then Spanish Consul in this city, but
now Consul-General in New York city) made efforts to bring the Spanish
West India Possessions and the Dominion into closer commercial rela-
tions, and the effort was looked upon with favor by the Imperial Govern-
ment at Madrid, it being understood that the authorities still favor the
idea. Writing to Senor Uriarte shortly since for some information, he
said in reply:—“ I remember the instructive and very agreeable inter-
views I had with you, when in Montreal, for the promotion of commer-
cial intercourse between the Dominion and the Spanish West Indies. If
that calamitous insurrection had not broken out in October, 1868, I think
that such arrangements would have been made through my instrumen-
tality, and with the help of the valuable information I obtained from,


you, as would have proven of very great advantage to both countries in
many ways.”
It may be remarked here, that during a very recent visit to this city,
His Excellency the Civil and Military Governor of St. lago de Cuba
expressed how much he had been gratified by what he saw of Canadian
enterprise and progress, and how surprised he was that trade relations
between the Spanish West Indies and Canada were so restricted, —espe-
cially when the natural productions of the countries formed so large a
proportion of their respective wants; “ but, after all,” said he, “it ap-
pears to be impracticable for your people to deal with us to any very
great extent, without refineries to enable them to use profitably our
peculiar kinds of raw Sugars.”
Of the vast commerce of the Spanish West Indies, the subjoined«tate-
ment of values shows how small a portion of it is being done at present
by the merchants of the Dominion :
small a jjortion of it is being done at presi
)ominion:—

TRADE WITH BRAZIL.
From a most interesting volume, circulated by the Commissioners
from Brazil at the Centennial Exhibition, it appears that the Empire is
of vast extent, covering one-fifteenth of the terrestrial surface of the globe,
one-fifth of the New World, and more than three-sevenths of the Continent
of South America. It has a total population, estimated in round numbers
at 12,000,000, in which are included 2,000,000 wild aborigines, and
1,476,567 slaves. By the law of 1871, which assures the gradual extinc-
tion of slavery, the children of slave mothers born after that date within
the Empire are free. At the end of 1873 the Empire possessed railways
of a total length of 714 English miles; and at the end of June, 1874, an
aggregate length of 397 miles was in process of construction. There
were at the close of 1874, 3,375 miles of telegraph-lines, with seventy-four
officA. With the view of facilitating and developing commerce, Govern-
ment threw open to foreign flags the coasting trade, and the waters of its
most important rivers the Paraguay, the San Francisco, the Amazon, as
far as the frontier, over an extent of 6,140 miles, and their respective
affluents, thus setting a good example to other nations.
The magnitude and value of the trade of the Empire of Brazil are
shown by the following figures: —
J 1864. 1874.
Imports $61,522,937 $84,043,670
Exports 64,735,350 104,723,504
$126,258,287 $189,267,174
The increased aggregate value for 1874, as contrasted with 1864, is
163,008,887, or 49-90 per cent.

I have no detailed statement at hand, at present, to show the entire
values of the various articles imported into Brazil from all countries , but


a reference to sheet Table D will show that the articles from the United
States are largely such as are the growth and produce of the Dominion,
some of them perhaps actually of Canadian origin.
It is stated upon official authority, that the mean annual increase in
value of exports during fiveyearp, from 1869 to 1874 inclusive, was 10*65
per cent., and of imports, 5*44 per cent.
The proportions of quantities and values (according to the same
authority) of merchandize exported, as shown in the foregoing state-
ment, to the whole value of exportations in 1873-74, were as fol-

The recorded direct trade of Canada with Brazil must be included in
the fraction set opposite “other countries.” It amounted in 1864 to
about $BOO,OOO in value, while a statement before me shows that during
the fiscal year ending 30th June, 1874, the direct imports into the Domi-
nion from “South America” amounted to $472,705, and the exports to
$1,087,942.


With reference to the article of coffee (figuring so largely as an ex-
port) it is asserted that the quality has improved considerably within
the past 15 years, as the result of improved processes; and that, for a
l,ong time, more than half the coffee of Brazil has entered into consump-
tion in Europe, under the appellations Java, Ceylon, Martinique, San
Domingo, or Moca.
Sugar-cane was the chief product of a large portion of the Empire,
until the introduction of the Coffee-tree drew from it a great number of
laborers. Brazilian sugar is said not to compare favorably at present
with the product of other countries; but improved cultivation and ma-
chinery are achieving success, and the production and export of sugar
are on the increase. >
Greater care is now taken in the culture and preparation of tobacco.
SOME FEATURES OF WEST INDIA AND BRAZILIAN TRADE.
If the produce merchants of Canada will look attentively into the two
tables, H and I, pp. 43-44 (if the importations of flour may be taken as
criteria,) it would seem as if about three-fourths of the British West
India trade might be participated in, by establishing intimate commercial
relations with Barbadoes, British Guiana, Jamaica and Trinidad.
Flour. —An examination of importations into the British West Indies
serves to show the large quantities required of various commodities
which are among the products of Canada, and of which there is always a
surplus for exportation. Take as one instance the article of Flour. The
subjoined statement shows how much has been imported annually into
the British West India Possessions named during sixteen years;—

Table H., (see p. 43) shows the quantities of flour imported into all
the British West Indies during three years, indicating the proportions
supplied by British North America and the United States respectively,
giving also the average values and the rates of duty. #
It has been alleged that flour manufactured from Canada wheat is
not suitable for tropical latitudes; but the following extract from the
Report of the West India Commissioners seems to be quite conclusive on
that point. Referring to the Empire of Brazil, they said :
“ The greatest care should be taken to send none but the best quality of our
products to Brazil. This remark applies specially to wheat flour. The consumers
are the wealthy classes and the population of the cities. If, on the one hand, they
are fastidious in their tastes, on the other they are always ready to pay high prices
for a really superior article, and none but flour prepared with great care, and from
selected dry or kiln-dried wheat, such as will stand the moist heat of the Tropics,
without deterioration, should be shipped from Canada.
“ It is a pleasing fact that a considerable quantity of Montreal flour has f<*r the
last three years been sent to Pernambuco, by way of England, and has given great
satisfaction. It is certain that much of the flour shipped southward from New
York is made in that city in imitation of Southern Ohio, both as to barrels and as to
the flour itself, and is found to answer. It is worthy the attention of the trade
whether it would not be desirable to establish a special brand for flour manufactured
for tropical consumption, since, with care and honesty in the shipments of the
article, Canada flour would, in time, attain a high character.”
Speaking upon the same point in my “ Report of Trade and Commerce
of Montreal for 1866,” I there remarked ;
“An impression prevails that Canadian flour is not suitable for export to
tropical countries ; it is, nevertheless, true that Montreal flour is not wholly unknown
or unappreciated in the West India and Brazil market, although there is no satis-
factory method by which it can be ascertained what proportion of the flour
exported to these countries frqm the United States was really the product ofCanada.
Suffice it, in the meantime, that Montreal millers can, and gladly would, manu-
facture special brands for use in the West Indies and South America ; and certain
millers in Upper Canada have declared their purpose to arrange without delay to
produce flour adapted for these markets.”
Further inquiries instituted upon this point only a few days ago,
amply confirm the statement relating to the manufacture of brands of
flour suitable for the trade of the West Indies and Brazil. What is said
to be wanted is a fair chance to participate in the trade.
Meal, Butter, Salted Meats, &c. —As another instance of what Canada
could send, of articles extensively consumed in the British West India
Islands, I submit Table I, on page 44, showing the quantities of certain
commodities imported during-fifteen years,—lBs9 to 1873 inclusive.
Preserved Fresh Meats, &c. —The opening up and extension of trade
with the Tropics and South America would seem to affcrd an outlet for
the products of establishments here and elsewhere-for the preserving and
canning of all kinds of meats, soups, &c.
Ice. —Attention was directed some years ago, in one of my Annual
Trade Reports, to the circumstance that considerable quantities of ice


were being exported from the United States to the West Indies and
South America. The shipments of that commodity from United States
ports in 1874, were as follow’s: —

A systematic participation in the Tropical and South American
trade by Canadian merchants, would certainly admit of that article being
profitably dealt in.
OTHER MERCHANDISE THAT COULD BE SENT FROM CANADA TO THE
TROPICS AND SOUTH AMERICA.
In the immediately preceding section I have particularized a few of
the articles which Canadian Produce Merchants could send to the West
Indies and Brazil, quite as cheaply and conveniently as their United
States neighbors. On looking again at the Sheet Table (D), it has
seemed that consideration of it would be facilitated by selecting some of
the more prominent items of merchandise shipped from the United States
during 1874 to the different countries therein mentioned. The articles
upon which brief notes are here subjoined, are not.nearly all that might
have been specified, the table itself being concise and explicit: —


Agricultural Implements. —Ploughs and Cultivators were shipped to
the British West Indies, Cuba, Porto Bico, Mexico, and Brazil.
Breadstuffs. —Flour has been already noticed. Large exportations of
various kinds of Grain are recorded to nearly all the Islands and coun-
tries enumerated, the quantities and values being large.
Cable, Cordage, Hope, &c. —These are items of considerable value in
the list of exports.
Candles, Goal and Petroleum. —Large quantities of Candles are repre-
sented as having been shipped to all places mentioned in the Table;
84,233 tons of bituminous Coal are among the exports ; besides 6,212,970
gallons of Illuminating Oil, or over 155,000 barrels.
Carriages. —These appear to have formed some part of the exports
to nearly all places.
Dairy Produce. These have been generally referred to already in a
table (G). It may be specially noted here, however, that the aggregate
quantity of Butter shipped to the various countries was 1,782,326 lbs.,
and of Cheese, 1,180,071 lbs.; their combined values being $647,138.
Drugs and Chemicals. —The total value of these articles amounted to
§464,741.
Farm Products.— Horned Cattle and Horses were sent to the British
West Indies, Cuba and Mexico. Hay was an article of not inconsider-
able export to nearly all the countries mentioned; while Potatoes were
shipped in large quantities. With reference to prices of the latter article,
it will be noticed that the United States official values at the ports of
shipment, during 1874, averaged nearly one dollar (say, a fraction more
than per bushel, —the aggregate quantity exported being 413,483
bushels, and the value §407,610. *
Fisheries, the various Products of :—This single very general allusion
is quite sufficient here.
Iron, and Manufactures of. —These lines deserve minute examination ;
the value of Xails and Spikes alone amount to §156,206.
Leather, and Manufactures of. —The value of all kinds of Leather
shipped amounted to §41,162 ; of Saddlery and Harness, §15,000 ; while
there were 166,469 pairs of Boots and Shoes exported.
* With reference to a remark on page 10 about the increased price attached to
articles passing through the hands of middle-men, —and specially as regards the
value of Potatoes shipped from ports in the United States to the West Indies, &c.,
in 1874, it may be stated here that during the past two or three months, the average
price for shipping lots of Potatoes (Early Rose) in St. John, N. 8., was 40c. per
bushel, while in Halifax, N.S., the average was somewhat lower. If the price in
1876 was in any way near the rate of 1874, Produce-merchants in the Maritime
Provinces can have no difficulty in seeing that there must have been a very hand-
some margin to compensate for the enterprise of the United States merchants in ar-
ranging the details of sending one kind of Dominion produce to market.

GEOGRAPHICAL AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS.
With regard to the share which United States merchants enjoy of the
West India trade, it was remarked in the Report of the West India Com-
missioners, that their enterprise and activity, the immense accumulation
of capital during many years of peace, and their unparalleled growth as
a nation, afforded advantages for securing that trade, which the newer,
■smaller, and almost exclusively agricultural population of Canada could
not hope to obtain for generations to come. Added to these, the Reci-
procity Treaty enabled our Republican neighbors to import duty free from
Canada most of the staples with which they supplied the requirements
of Tropical and South American peoples. But many, if not all, of these
conditions are changed, and “ the advantages which the merchants and
traders of the United States undoubtedly possessed over those of the
British Provinces in 1862, are now more than equalized.”
It has, too, been erroneously supposed, that the northern ports of
the United States have greater geographical advantages for carrying on
commerce with the West Indies than is really the case. For instance,
with reference to St. Thomas, the difference in distance in favor of Boston
and New York is not material, as shown by the following figures:
The Commissioners, remarking upon this point, said:
“Halifax is actually nearer to the Brazilian ports than New York * * * * *
But this question of comparative distances from British American and United


States ports to the West Indies, though an important element in considering the
subject, is not of so much commercial significance as has been supposed. The true
question is—what is the relative position of these ports with respect to the chief
districts which produce the articles of largest consumption within the Tropics?
These articles are fish, meats, animal products, cereals, and lumber. The Ottawa
District and New Brunswick are the most important lumbering regions in America.
The fish of commercial value are caught in the greatest abundance in the neigh-
borhood of St. John’s, Newfoundland ; Halifax, Nova Scotia, and in the Gulf of St.
Lawrence. Cereals, animals and their products, and many kinds of manufactures
can be produced as abundantly and as cheaply on the northern as on the southern
side of the international boundary. Thus, while our ports are at a very slight dis-
advantage, with respect to distance, from the markets of the West Indies and South
America, as compared with the chief cities of the Northern States, they are at no'
disadvantage with reference to their proximity to what may be called the centres of
production of the articles most required in tropical climates. If merchants and
consumers in the West Indies can have their lumber, fish and flour shipped
direct from the place of growth, bv water, rather than by long railway lines to foreign
cities where they must undergo the expense and injury of transhipment, and are,,
after all, but verv little nearer to their destination, it would seem but reasonable that
they should prefer the direct route.”
It is the opinion of many who have given the question consideration,
that if Canada is to build up a large trade with the British and Foreign
West Indies for her Western products, she must have depots in the Mari-
time Provinces, from which to carry on the trade during winter.
In a valuable paper on Inland Navigation and Canal Improvement,
prepared by the Hon. John Young, and read at the Annual Meeting of
the Dominion Board of Trade, held in 1871, the following passage occurs :
“ It would ba difficult to point out all the advantages which would_ result to
Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, by the construction of the
Baie Verte Canal. If the 900 ton propeller could deliver Western or Canadian pro-
ducts at Halifax or St. John, these places would become cheap depots for such pro-
ducts. Assorted cargoes of fish, hoops, shocks, lumber, etc., would be made up at
these ports for the W est India Islands and South America, and could bring back
return cargoes from these countries, of sugar, coffee, hides, tallow, etc., to be again,
re-shipped as return cargoes to Canada and the United States by the inland propel-
ler, and thus delivered at less cost by such means than by any other possible route.”
Speaking of the prospective trade, not very long ago the St. John,
H. 8., (rtofosaid:—
“There is no reason why, with energy and watchfulness, Canadian produce
should not be able to secure a comparatively large and profitable share of the Yest
India and South American trade. The United States sends annually to the British
West Indies alone, from ten to fifteen millions worth of their goods, and to the other'
West India Islands and South America, wares to the value of sixty millions more.
The field is a tempting one to Canadian enterprise. In many classes of goods we
should be able to supplant the American producer, because of the cheapness of
labor here, and the facilities which we possess for producing many classes ot goods,
used in the southern portions of America and now furnished by the United States.”
SOME OF THE DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY.
So fir asmeie postal facilities are concerned, it is gratifying to know
that the Dominion has, for correspondence with the West Indies, the same
facilities via New York that are enjoyed by the correspondence of the


United States, the United States Post Office Department giving to
Canada the benefit of all arrangements it makes in its own behalf A
Canadian closed mail via New York is not made up ; a letter goes from
Montreal (say) to be included in the West India mails forwarded from
New York, on the same footing as a letter from Chicago or St. Louis.
There is a monthly mail posted from Halifax to Bermuda and St. Thomas;
but this packet is maintained by the Imperial Government mainly with a
view to communicating with Bermuda and the fleet on the North American
Station, and the sailings and arrivals of the packet are regulated from
England to suit the packet days to Halifax, and therefore do not fit in
very closely with the Packet days to St. Thomas; thus there is ordinarily
more or less of delay at those points to correspondence sent or received
by this channel to or from West India ports beyond St. Thomas.
While the fullest postal facilities must not be disparaged, yet the
mere transmission of letters is not the main point in direct trade, after
all; frequent steam communication between ports in the Dominion
(say, from Montreal and Quebec during the season of navigation, or
alternately from Halifax and St. John during the winter) is required to
neutralize the commercial demoralization which is the inevitable con-
sequence of dependence upon our neighbors for transportation facilities.
It may, therefore, be expedient to grant a moderate mail-subsidy to a
line of freight and passenger steamships until direct trade relations were
well established between Canada and the principal West India Islands ;
and the completion of the Intercolonial Railway now makes such an
arrangement perfectly practicable.
Among the obstructions which merchants would encounter, in
endeavoring to participate in the commerce of the British West India
Possessions, for instance, are the various import and export duties levied
under the several Colonial tariffs, scarcely any of the rates being the same.
Particular attention is requested to a set of tables I have taken pains to
prepare (K, L, M, on pp. 45-47) which include a number of articles, and
the different rates of import ’duty levied upon them in the Possessions
mentioned therein; —while table N (on p. 48) shows the duties that are
leviable upon certain kinds of staple and other merchandize exported from
the Possessions indicated. The tariff, in each case, is that which was in
operation in 1875.
Probablv, therefore, the earliest efforts ought to be directed towards
procuring the earnest consideration of our Government as to whether,
with the aid of the Imperial and severnl Colonial authorities, some
uniformity of customs tariffs could not be attained. A reciprocal modi-
fication, like that suggested by Sir A. T. Galt, (who at the time was


Finance Minister) in his instructions to the Canadian Representatives onr
the West India Commission, seems to be required. His idea was “reci-
procity ” in the mutual meaning of the word, applied to natural produc-
tions of the respective countries, —and he comprehensively stated it as
fallows:—
“ It would be improper for the Government to anticipate the action of the
Legislature in reference to taxation ; but it is necessary that you should be informed
that this Government would be prepared to recommend to Parliament the reduction
or even the abolition of any customs duties now levied on the productions of these
countries, if corresponding favor were shown to the staples of British North
America in their markets.”
In the absence of such a fiscal policy as will admit large importa-
tions into the Dominion of the staple productions of the British and
Foreign West Indies, it is the opinion of reflecting men that there
can he no direct trade worthy of the name between the Dominion and the-
West Indies. At the present moment a chief staple is alleged to be
practically excluded from the Dominion ; and some alteration seems to-
be needed to admit of raw sugar being handled upon equal terms with
the United States, a course which would restore and increase our direct
commerce with our Colonial brethren in the Tropics.
SUGAR TARIFFS.
A good deal of consideration has been given to the question of the
manufacture of beet-root sugar in the Dominion, and certain induce-
ments were offered to the party or parties who should successfully pro-
secute that branch of industry. It was imagined that the production of
that kind of sugar would afford extensive employment, by creating a
large demand for, so to speak, a new article of agricultural produce, as
well as by utilizing labor in the sugar-making process, and so measurably
implementing the loss arising from the decrease or discontinuance-
of cane-sugar refining. But it seems now to be well understood that
there is a climatic obstruction in the way to any very important success \
for the early frosts frequently experienced in Canada would be fatal to
such extensive cultivation of the beet as would be necessary to make
large investments in the business remunerative, —even with the special
inducements referred to. It would appear, therefore, as if the Dominion
must continue to rely for its sugar upon the product of the sugar-cane,
unless, indeed, the people are to hopelessly continue to be importers of
European refined sugars, (some of them said to be mixed in large propor-
tion with French beet-sugar,) or to continue to be dependent upon the
Government-favored products of the United States refineries. And this-
brings us face to face with the ever-recurring question of sugar imposts.

It may be remarked here, regarding the principle upon which Dutch
Standard (D. S.) numbers were made the nucleus of the various Tates of
Customs duty on sugar that, until within eight or ten years ago, perhaps,
color was considered as fairly indicating the vciluc of the commodity. The
people of the Netherlands, having first adopted Color-Standards, other
nations accepted the method, and hence the nomenclature. The United
States “experts,” who induced the Secretary of the United States
Treasury to accept their version of the story about drawbacks based upon
the D. S. principle, remarked, in their report on the subject, that it is a
“ system long since abandoned by intelligent dealers in sugar, who look
for commercial value and not for color.” If color is now an inadequate
criterion of value, such a classification is worthless; and the Canadian
duties are wrong in principle. Perhaps, therefore, the most satisfactory
and equitable method would be to levy on the value of the article at the
place of original shipment, making a sharp distinction between raw and
refined. The desideratum is believed by many to bo a re-formulation of
the duties which were in operation before Confederation, in Canada,
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick,—with a Surtax (amount to be fixed by
the Governor-General-in-Council) upon sugar from any country which re-
ceives a bounty hidden in the drawback allowed on exportation.
The question may, sooner or later, force itself upon the Govern-
ment of the Dominion, whether they ought not to adopt the principle of |
“countervailing duties,” upon every commodity exported from a foreign ,
country under a system of bounties, as a simple act of self-preservation.
In the case of sugar, I am told that the amount of bounty that may be
concealed in drawback can be easily ascertained; where there is a desire


to do so. This is also the opinion of an evidently well-informed writer
in the New York Chronicle on this vexed question.
Let me give you an illustration of the direction in which the hounty-
system would seem to be spreading. When in New York city, shortly since,
and passing not far from several large establishments where packing-
cases were being manufactured in immense quantities, I was informed by
a member of the State Legislature, that they were used in the exportation
of petroleum. The oil, it seems, is first put into tin cylinders,.made so as
that the tin plates will be cut up as little as possible,—a certain number of
filled flasks, or cylinders, are packed in each case, and the shipper
obtains a drawback upon the tin cases of one and one-tenth cents
(gold) per pound on the weight. Well, there is a duty upon tin en-
tered for consumption in Germany and Belgium, but, I under-
stand, none upon packages; so, after the petroleum is landed, the tin
cylinders are easily transformed into tin plates, (with a hidden bounty ),
being little or none the worse for their connection with the petro-
leum. There is evidently plenty of room in Germany and Belgium
for a practical retort a la lobster-cans I and with more show of right and
reason than in the notable example of the U. S. vs. Canada.
SOME PHASES OF FISCAL POLICY.
For many years the Government of Great Britain derived the
greater portion of its Customs revenue from a few imported articles
which entered into general consumption, viz., tobacco, spirits, tea, sugar,
wine and coffee, in this way easily spreading taxes over all classes of
society. The following statement collated from the official record, shows
the total annual income from Customs duties in the United Kingdom,
collected upon the articles mentioned during the past decade; it also indi-
cates the percentages of revenue jdelded by each :

It will
also be noticed,
examining the
years specified, that at present nearly one-half of the entire revenue from
Customs duties in Great Britain is collected, from only two impoited |
articles, tobacco and tea. The repeal of the sugar duties, about two
years and a half ago, was a movement in favor of cheap sugar, as well
as a concession to a very extensive manufacturing interest in England
and Scotland —that of sugar refining; for it will be observed that,
according to the following statement, the duty paid upon unrefined sugar
formed an exceedingly large percentage of the total revenue collected
from all kinds of sugar. It further appears from the official record that
in 1875 the consumption of sugar per capita of the population of Great
Britain was 65-17 pounds, against 55-02 in 1873, and 59-40 in 1874. (It
may be mentioned here that the consumption in the United States is
understood to be 50 pounds per capita , and in the Dominion 26 pounds,
—32 pounds having also been stated as the quantity.)

Of course, as is usually the case with all such functionaries, the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, while repealing these sugar duties, took good
care to gradually recoup himself for the loss occasioned to the revenue,
by securing increased receipts from the other articles. The repeal of
the sugar duties, however, did not remove all the disabilities under
which the British refiners labored; the damaging competition against

| which they had to contend was that which was made efficient by bonuses
(covered up in
drawbacks) granted by foreign governments, especially
that of France, to exporters of sugar to the United Kingdom. The fol-
lowing are the tariffs of sugar duties of France, Belgium and Holland :
France.
Belgium.
Holland.
The French bonus has operated so, that in September of the present
year, the same sugar which was said to be selling in Bordeaux at 7 pence
per pound, could be bought in England at 4 pence! The cost to the French
Government of this cheapened article in the United Kingdom, is stated
to amount to the very respectablb sum annually of 20,000,000 francs, or
nearly £BOO,OOO sterling! This is a state of matters which it was
intended should be remedied by the Convention of 1865, between the
Governments of Great Britain, France, Holland and Belgium. The object
of that Convention or Treaty was, to “ effect the abolition of all bounties
which might be given to the refiners of any country in the amount of
drawback allowed on the exportation of refined sugar,” It was well
known that such bounties, under the less objectionable name of draw-
backs were given by the three continental governments mentioned, and,
in fact, it was never denied by them; but each alleged, in extenuation,
that, unless by combined action, such bounties could not be abolished.
In Holland, the export of 79-7 pounds of refined sugar w r as allowed to
cover the import duty on 100 lbs. of raw sugar of any quality; and as the
duty was high, the bounty realized by export refiners who worked the
better class of sugars was very considerable. A similar state of
matters prevailed in Belgium. Well then, the 19th article of the
Convention provided that: —“ In the event of bounties being granted
on the exportation of refined sugars, the high contracting parties will
be at liberty to come to an understanding as to the Surtax to be imposed
on the importation of refined sugars of and from the said countries.”
Even with the conclusions arrived at by the above-mentioned Con-
vention, the chronic difficulty seems to be, to determine what would be


an honest drawback, and to'unite upon an equitable Surtax,— for French \
refiners declare they derive no benefit from the drawback; —and that
now the gravamen of the troubles attendant on the importation of refined
sugars into Great Britain. And no better evidence can he found of the
estimation in which sugar-refining is held by the British Government,
than the efforts so persistently put forth to deliver it from an unfair, if
not dishonest, and ruinous competition.
The Bounty-system enjoyed by the United Slates refiners is the
cause~of~mucli of the difficulty before which Canadian refiners have one
after another succumbed, —with these additional obstacles, that the
Dominion Parliament have not only not attempted to save them by
countervailing legislation, but that the Tariff is alleged to discriminate
to some extent against the importation of certain kinds of raw sugars.
There can be no doubt but that the United States Government believe
their refineries to be, as they undoubtedly are, the key to an immense |
and varied foreign trade; and hence every facility and advantage are
afforded them, in the shape of what are denominated “drawbacks.”
It is alleged that the Dominion duties on raw sugars prevent pro-
fitable refining, —especially as United States exporters, with a bonus of 51c.
(61 Jc.) per 100 lbs. on hard sugars, have controlled the Canadian market.
On the other hand the contrary view has been strenuously, and so far,
successfully upheld. The understanding, however, has generally been,
that, as a rule, business men do not needlessly relinquish profitable
enterprises, and, as refineries in the Dominion have been shut up, that
fact may fairly be deemed a conclusive answer to any theoretical alle-
gation.
With reference to the drawback arrangement in operation in the
United States, prior to October 9th, 1875, it having been shown to the
Secretary of the Treasury that the drawback was excessive, it was alter-
ed at that date by a Treasury Order; but a committee of “ exports ” was,,
on the representation of refiners, appointed by Hon. Mr. Bristow “h>
investigate into and report upon the question of the proper drawback to
he fixed on refined sugar, the product of imported raw sugar.” It may,
in brief, be remarked that the Report of that Committee contended that
the drawback given by the United States Government did not, and does
not include a bounty, and certain formulae were adduced by these so-
called “ experts” —who were, there is reason to believe, neither more
nor less than the facile representatives of the refiners—to prove that con-
tention. But the reports of these gentlemen were severely criticised, and
the fallacies in them exposed, in the Commercial Chronicle of New York,
(see the No. for 29th January, 1876,) and in other English periodicals


since. The following is the hypothesis of the “ experts,” on which
they based a recommendation for drawback upon hard white sugar:
60 lbs. hard sugar, at per lb -...52.16
lbs. soft and inferior sugar at 2£c. per lb -59
Ufoo' lbs. syrup (1 gallon) 6£c. per gallon -06- 25
lbs. waste.
Duty on 100 lbs. Dutch Standard, No. 10 to 13 = §2.25 + 25 per cent..s2.Blf 0 fi ff
The theory upon which the Secretary of the United States Treasury,
in his circular above referred to, is understood to have based his proposed
reduction of the rate of drawback which had prior to that period been
allowed, was as follows :
Operating on 120£ lbs. raw sugar the American refiner pays 2J per lb $3.01 £
And on exporting 100 lbs. of refined he obtains as drawback, $3.60 less
1 per cent 3.561
Being a bounty on 100 lbs. of refined of .55
Also admission of 12 lbs. treacle into United States free of duty .06
Total bounty on export of 100 lbs. refined of 0.61£
But the weight of influence was powerfully in favor of the slightly
amended propositions of the “experts,” and the U. S. Finance Minister
accepted the situation. Had not the result been so disastrous to a valu-
able branch of Canadian enterprise and industry, it might simply have
been deemed curious to know that it is now admitted by the trade in
the United States that there is a bounty underlying the drawback!
There can hardly be a doubt that this question of Sugar Duties, as
lying at the threshold of any attempt that may be made to increase our
trade relations with the West Indies, will come before Parliament in
some form or other; and itwmuld be very advantageous to the Members,
if Government were to cause an impartial and thorough investigation to be
made with a view to laying all the facts and circumstances before the
House next session. And it ought to be borne in mind by those who look
to the Home Government for precedents, that its free-trade theory
is not opposed to countervailing duties. That principle is in operation
now, in the case of British malt, spirits, and sundry other articles.
A COMMERCIAL SPECTRE!—SUMMARY OF DEDUCTIONS AND SUG-
GESTIONS.
You will, I am sure, have noticed, in looking over this communica-
tion, that the subject has not been gone into so much in detail as was
possible; but it would have been inexpedient, in the circumstances, to
have attempted to accomplish more. If it should seem as if too much
space has been assigned to the sugar question, let me state that in every


view which I have been able to take of the subject of trade with the
Tropics and South America—that is, whether trying to determine what
Canada could send to the Sugar-producing countries, or what could be
brought to the Dominion from them—a gigantic spectre has glided into,
and to some extent overshadowed, the field of vision, and Sugar Duties,
in flaming characters, seemed to be written on every wall and panel. On
the whole, however, I am inclined to suppose that, with something like
conclusiveness, it has been shown :
(1) That the magnitude and general character of the trade of the West
Indies, Brazil, etc., present an excellent opportunity for increased enter-
prise on the part of Canadian merchants.
(2) That the Tropical and South American countries on the one
hand, and the Dominion of Canada on the other, naturally and mutually
afford the best and cheapest markets in which the merchants of the
respective countries can make their purchases.
(3) That the geographical position of the Dominion is much more
favorable for direct trade with the West Indies and Brazil than is gene-
rally imagined.
(4) That the main obstacles in the way of immediate enlargement
of the trade of Canada with these countries, originate in a diverse
and obstructive fiscal policy, as well as in the want of means for frequent
direct transportation of merchandize from sea-ports in the Dominion to
the West Indies, etc.
(5) That the Dominion Government might, as far as comes within
their province, with eminent propriety take speedy measures to lessen
or entirely remove the barriers to commercial intercourse with the West
Indies and South America.
(6) (Inferentially, of course) that, to make the magnificent and
inviting commerce of the Tropics and South America available, Canadian
merchants should, for themselves, carefully examine and embrace the
opportunities that seem to offer for the extension of trade relations; and
(7) That the energetic prosecution of the trade which has been
under consideration, would be of untold advantage to the several Mari-
time Provinces of the Dominion, in developing for them an immense
winter traffic.
And now, in conclusion, I have only a word or two more to say.
The statements thus laid before you indicate very distinctly that there
is no insuperable difficulty in the way of tripling or quadrupling the trade
at present done by Canadian merchants with these countries. It is
understood that the Dominion Cabinet has had. this very impor-
tant subject under consideration; but nothing is known respecting the


course of action to be pursued. Let us all cherish the hope that former
inquiries and efforts at negotiation may have so cleared the way,
that some new movement may be at once made which shall initiate
arrangements in the various countries for reciprocal reductions of duties,
and the consideration of all other matters relating to commerce and ship-
ping, The subject is not one to be committed for consideration to mere
political partizans; it is not an abstract theory to be proved or disproved
By logical deduction; it is instinct with substantial realities, involving
the general welfare of this country, concurrently witt t£e "Ifncrease and
prosperity of a thriving population ; and it ought, therefore, to command
the cordial efforts of every business man to aid in building up a splendid
Industrial and Commercial Future for the Dominion of Canada.
1 have the honor to be,
Gentlemen,
Your obedient servant,
WM. J. PATTERSON,
Secretary.
