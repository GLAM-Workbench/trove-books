LAND VALUES RESEARCH GROUP
CITY OF OAKLEIGH.
A Study of the Distribution of Ratepayers Among
Vacant Land Holders, Improved Land" Holders ,
Absentee holders and"XocaT HolderU of Vacant Land
and the EffecV(Tpon Each Group~~of~ a Reversion
VaTuE~‘KtThg
A complete dissection of the Municipal Voters 1 Rolls has
been conducted by the Land Values Group, in view of a proposal
to revert from Rating Upon Unimproved Capital Value of Land
to the Net Annual Rental Value Basis. This proposal was
defeated at a poll of Ratepayers by 1761 votes to 587 votes.
The results are summarised below. They cover all holdings of
land even as low as £2 annual value which, in this district,
carries a vote.
The Rate of 6id. in the £ of unimproved land value corresponds
to 2/9 in the £ on the net annual value. There has been no
general revaluation for nine years,
A. SUMMARY OF PURELY VACANT LAND HOLDERS
The total voters on the roll is 5*075 so that the proportion
of vacant lot holders is 24%* As a considerable proportion of
the voters are joint owners of the same properties the vacant
holders will be greater as a proportion of distinct properties.
Of the total holders of vacant lots only* no fewer than 86% are
Absentee owners, i. 0,, live in other districTs^nfchaF'Oaki'oigh.
The largely speculative nature of these vacant holdings is
shown by the fact that of the 1,070 absentee holders no less than
265 are located Interstate or in country districts of Victoria.
The proportion is particularly high in the North Ward, 108 or
33% of the total absentees«
A further evidence of small scale speculation is found in the
fact that 488 of the 1,237 vacant holders (40%) are females, who
are not so likely to have intentions of building for themselves.
The total unimproved value of the district is £970,152 so that
under site value rating these/vacant B6%~absenteesi
now contribute 15~§% of" the total general! rate revenue * Under

Oakleigh Study
Sheet 2.
The number of ratepayers owning vacant land in addition to
built property is very small, but the land value held is very
great i, Under site value rating this group pays £1,840 in rates
which would fall to £l,lBO under annual valuo rating, a reduction
of £660, This gain would bo shared by only 104 holders however,
as 28 in this group are actually benefited by site value rating,
the saving on their built properties outweighing the extra on the
vacant land. The largest holders in this group are listed in
the Appendix,
Co PROPORTION OF HOUSES AND SHOPS BENEFITING
UNDER THE RESPECTIVE SYSTEMS
The rolls for each ward have been dissected and the houses and
shops benefiting under each of the rating systems are shown
below. Houses or shops with vacant land in addition are not
included.
In addition there were 37 built properties of other kinds which
benefit under site value rating and 26 which benefit under annual
value rating. The former are highly improved properties e.g.
House & Garage, House & Dairy, Theatre, Factory, Fire Station,
The latter are relatively poorly improved, e c gg Woodyards, Stables.
Blacksmith. 9
Although 31$ of the Shops would pay reduced rates under annual
value rating their interests would be injured by the change to
a considerably greater extent. The 89$ of houses which would have
rate increases with the change would have less money to spend in
their shops. At present the £2,750 more paid under site value
rating on the purely vacant land is defrayed almost entirely (86$)
by absentees in other districts. This amount would have to be
met from the incomes of the local residents with a change to
annual value rating and would have other secondary effects in
reducing the spending power in the district.


Sheet 3,
Although, numerically, the ratepayers gaining under site
value rating are in great majority, in terms of voting power the
houses mainly carry single votes whereas the majority of those
which would benefit under annual value rating have two or three
votes. One timber yard in this class actually carries nine
votes. The voting strength is thus much more even than these
figures might suggest, particularly as vacant land holdings
below £5 annual value carry a vote under a recent amendment to the
local Government Act, The largest holdings of vacant land and
land held in conjunction with buildings are listed in the
Appendix.
