Australian Anthem,
BESPECTFULLY DEDICATED TO
CHARLES IBBOTSON, ESQ., J.P.,
BY WILLIAM STITT JENKINS.
Queen of the British Isle!
Angels upon thee smile,
List to thy sons.
Should foes approach thy shore,
Loud let thy cannon roar;
We, Queen, will evermore
Stand to thy guns.
Land of the vine and oil!
Land of the sons of toil!
Queen of the sea!
Isle of the golden sand!
Here, men from every strand,
Hail thee, great Austral Land,
Home of the free!
God of our Bathers, rise!
Lord of the azure skies,
Smile on our grain!
Over this beauteous land,
May we, a righteous band,
Still in thy favour stand.
Thy laws to maintain.
GEELONG, VICTORIA,
MAY 24, 1858.
