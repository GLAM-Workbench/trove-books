Whose vast dominions gem the hemispheres;
And we, her people, of th? Australian Isles?

Plucked from the scabbard, crowned with victory,
For we Australians hold a coward abhorr?d. TV*
Then rouse ye people, and to-day unite
To celebrate the Diamond Jubilee
Of her grand reign, whose sceptre ever bright,
Sways, gently sways o?er fearless hearts and free.
Science and Progress, white-winged Peace and Truth,
Like unimprisoned flames, have brightly shed,
With each revolving year of her departed youth,
A heaven-born halo o?er her royal head.
Faith, Love, and Duty have upreared a shrine
Within the heart of England?s widowed Queen,
?lTï¿½p And nations, yet unborn, shall firmly twine
Around their hearts, her mem?ry evergreen.

Shield from all harm and to her pure life?s end
