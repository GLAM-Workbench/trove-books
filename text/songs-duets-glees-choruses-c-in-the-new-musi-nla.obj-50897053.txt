PROGRAMME.
It is presumed that, notwithstanding this cele-
taractcr has been already so often before the Public, and
although soma affirm him to be on his last legs, he is yet capable
of standing another trial; and that gmaugre his having already
been destroyed in SPAIN, resuscitated in DRURY-LANE, Vam-
pyrised in the ADELPHI, and damned in Ireland, this final
attempt to transport him to the OLYMPIC, will not fail to de-
light !—more especially, as it will afford the Public an opportunity
of judging of the state of society on t’other side the water, and
supply much useful information to those persons who are inclined
to go thither.

SONGS, DUETS, GLEES.
&c. &c.
ACT I.—SCENE I.
GLEE, — Blab, Flimsy, and Dive.
A ship—a ship—haste to the ferry,
The more that come here make us merry:
Let’s hail her with a high-down-derry.
Haste—haste to the ferry, Btc.
SONG, — Governor.
Al« —“ Old Commodore.”
Odzooks! whal a time you’ve been prating to me;
Why not tell me of this chap before 1
Perhaps he’s a great one, —it hkely may be;
Then let us away to the shore!
' While you were so full of gab.
Why not mention, Master Blab,
This fact to your Old Governor,
Your Old Governor;
He!—
Who will always make a rout
About who goes in or out;
But I think it’s best myself to see !


SONG, — Blab.
, Air—“ Love in the heart.”
What is it that drives the blue devils away ?
Or the bailiff displaces, by night or by day ?
That makes Justice see though she’s blind of each eye?
That checks in poor authors the sensitive sigh?
’Tis cash—’tis cash in the purse, &c.
And what makes an old maid in wrinkles excel
The bloom of young beauty ?—We know very well,
’Tis cash—’tis cash in the purse, &c.
What makes a swell dandy, in dennet or gig?
Saves smashing tradesmen, or buys a Brutus wig?
’Tis cash—’tis cash in the purse, &c.
DUET, —Don Giovanni and Leporello.
(Echo Song from Narensky.)
Gio.
In a cottage young Zerlina dwelt,
The spot I remember right well;
To sweet beauty whenever I knelt,
I was certain to hear off- —the belle.
Often cag’d, in a sky-larking row.
For flooring of Charlies a score,
Farewell, —farewell.
A round-house I ne’er shall see more.
Left. — (entering.)
Sure that voice—’tis the old one— oh, dear?
Or Master-infernal Don Ju'n;
1 should like to know what brought him here.
Came to life, I suppose in the moon.
Perhaps he’s forsaken his rib,
And found marriage a hell of a bore,
Hallo!—Hallo!
I’d like, faith, to see him once more!


DUET, —Don Giovanni and Leporello.
D. Gio.
Where have you been lately,
Leporello—Leporello!
I’m done up completely!
Leporello, &c.
To Botany I’m carried.
For what, d’ye think, &c.
Because two wives I married,
That had the chink, &c.
Lep.
Two wives are two-r-too many
This time o’day, &e.
And so they nabb’d Giovanni
For Big-a-my-^- for Big-a-my /
One wife may prove a blessing’,
. Perhaps a curse, &c.
My candid mind expressing.
Faith! two are worse, &c.
D. Gio.
And why did they send you here,
I prithee tell O, &c.
You need’nt blush, —there’s none near,
Modestfellow—Leporello.
Lep.
If the truth you must know.
I’ll tell no lie, &c.
I toolca pound note somehow,
A For-ge-ry, —A For-ge-ry.
D. Gio r
And could you not have trac’d it 1
Lep.
Not I indeed, &c.
So many names defac’d it r
I could’ntread, &c.


D. Gio.
It was a sad disaster,
So here they paclAl, &c.
You off—before your master.
Lep.
That is the fact, &c.
SON G, — Leporello.
Of all the Girls that are so smart.
There’s none like Betty Martin!
She is the darling- of ray heart,
And she loves me for sartain.
My eye!—she’s such a hand at dress.
Plain work or mantua-making-;
She wears a frill just like Queen Bess,
And has a way quite taking.
Her father was a duffer bold.
But one day got transported.
Because some smuggled silk he sold,
Notdu-ty paid—imported:
Yet what of that, my Betty dear!
Has beauty so bewitching.
She rules the roast at Old Wild's here,
For she’s Queen of the Kitchen.
DUET, —The Don and Leporello.
Air— “ When the Southern breezes play .”
D. Gio.
When the governor you see,
The long bow draw for me.
Tell him ’tis said,
OT eash I’m made,
For flight ’twill pave the way.


Lep.
I understand you, Don,
The lay you now are on.
Don’t be afraid,
I’ll gull the blade.
You may depend upon.
Both.
Then let us haste away.
And if we gain the day.
When once more free,
We'll merry be.
And catch us then who may.
SESTETTO, — (from the Haunted Tower.)
Gov.
You’re welcome, Don Giovanni,
We’ll strive to make your stay
Pass pleasantly as any,
Altho’ in Bot’ny Bay!
Chorus. —You’re welcome, &c.
D. Gio.
With gratitude delighted,
Your most obedient see.
Wilhelmina, — (aside.)
I wish I was united
To such a Don as he!
heporello and the Don , — (aside.)
Lep.
The gudgeon bites already.
D. Gio.
Yes, —all goes as I wish.
Lep.
But if you are not steady,
The plan you’ll surely dish!


Wilh.
What a fine man!
Lep.
That’s me!
D. Gio.
No, —me!
Thanks, —noble Governor!
Lep.
Thank you for me.
Wilh. — (Aside.)
What grace, —what an air!
D. Gio.—(to her.)
What beauty rare!
Wilh. — (aside.)
Born to delight and win the fair.
Lep. — (aside.)
Born to seduce—black, brown, and fair.
Chorus.— You’re welcome, &c.
END OF ACT I.


ACT II.
SON G, — Leporello.
Aik— “ Di tanti.”
He’s at his usual tricks.
Now he’s courting’.
So transporting,
Nothing his mind can fix, —
Not even Bot-a-ny!
Still all his study
Is some sparkling eye;
Cheeks, pale or ruddy.
Claim his roguish sigh !
Such hoaxing
And coaxing!
Adoring,
Imploring,—
Young JVil-hel-mi-ni-i !
He’s at his usual tricks.
She is courted,
He’s transported!
Nothing his mind can fix,
Not even Bot-a-ny!
SONG, —Don Giovanni.
Be mine, dear girl,—Giovanni’s heart
Can never prove untrue;
With every other flame I’d part
To spend an hour with you!
Then let us run away, my love.
Oh! let us run away ;
For like the fond and turtle dove.
I’ll love thee night and day, love !
B


A rake no more, my wild oats sown,
We’ll live quite free from strife ;
Each hour of thee more fonder grown.
My love, my only life!
Then let us run away, my love,
Oh! let us run away.
For like a fond and turtle dove,
I’ll love thee night and day, love!
I’ll love thee, &c.
QUINTETTO,
Leporello, Don Giovanni, Mrs. Wild, Wil. and Gov.
Lep.
Oh, Don, here is the Governor!
Zounds ! Mrs. Wild—what a comical spree ;
If soon you do not come over her,
There will be surely the devil to pay.
Gio. (striking him.)
Take that, you must have been loitering.
Or I should never have such a surprise.
Mrs. W.
No—no—’twas my reconnoitering
Dish’d your project, and falsehood likewise.
Wilh.
Vile Don! to me you’re quite hateful.
Gio. (to each.)
I joke but with her, —’tis your beauty I prize.
Mrs. Wild and Wilhemina.
Could I believe you were faithful.
Leporello, — (aside.)
Lord ! what flats, —how they swallow his lies.
Enter Governor.
What-—what—what can the matter he 1
What’s all this noise and confusion I hear \


Lep.
Don Giovanni wanted to batter me,
But he found me a customer queer.
Gov.
Come—come, —shake hands, and be friends again.
D. Gio. (significantly to the women.)
Well —I agree, let’s forget what is past.
Lep. — (aside)
More luck his impudence sends again.
He’s hoaxed them all, and we ve conquer’d at
last.
SON G, — Wilhelmina.
Air —“ Bonnie Laddie
He’s the only man I love,
Don Giovanni, &c.
How he kissed me in the grove,
Don Giovanni, &c.
If I can escape in time.
With Giovanni, &c.
Hoaxing parents will be prime,
With Giovanni, &c.
Why should I stay here and mope 1
Youth’s soon over, &c.
Better far for to elope,
With Giovanni, winning lover;
I’ll be off, faith!—sink or swim.
With Giovanni, &c.
For there’s none can love like him;
Dear Giovanni! sweet Giovanni!
SONG, —Betty Martin.
air —“ He's as tight a lad."
He’s a red nosed little fellow.
Plump and squat like Cupid too !
If I cut poor Leporello ;
I am sure he’d then look blue.


How my heart I did surrender.
When the funny blade I knew!
He knows well the passion tender.
And a pretty girl to woo.
He’s a red nosed, &c.
SON G, — Leporello.
Air—“ Miss Baity.”
Don Juan was a Libertine,
Bred up in merry Cadiz ;
He gamed,—drank hard, —dressed mighty fine.
And kiss’d a thousand ladies ;
His wicked course no art could tame,
His love’s they were so many ;
So out of shame.
He changed his name,
From Juan —to Giovanni.
Oh, Giovanni!
Vice — Juan — Giovanni.
What sundry bumps
And divers thumps
I’ve got from Giovanni !
A Donna he’d forsook, call'd Ann,
Unveil’d while he was vowing;
Said,—“ now I’ve found you out false man,”
And then began a rowing;
Her dad who had not gone to bed.
Came from his gin and toddy.
Cried —■“ what’s the fun 1
Oh, dear!—l’m run!”
Completely through the body!
Oh Giovanni!
Cruel Giovanni !
With carte and tierce,
How could you pierce ?
Old greybeard, through the body.
He next just stepp’d down stairs, —you know.
Where all thought he was undone ;
But kick’d up such a dust below,
They sent him back to London.


T’would fill a volume to relate,
His changes were so many,
Last Lady-day,
For Big—-or—my.
They shipp’d off Giovanni.
Oh, Giovanni!
Kaleidescope—Giovanni.
I’m quite perplex’d.
To know what next.
Will happen to Giovanni.
DUET, —Leporello and Betty.
(From the Haunted Tower.)
Lev,
Love makes Leporello,
Now a happy fellow.
Bet.
Our escape will be a rig;
Yes, that it will for sariain.
Lep.
Ok, jolly Betty Martin!
Will you hop with me 1
Bet.
The Twig!
Lep.
If you’ll to sarvice,
I’ll take a Jarvis,
When we get to London town.
Bet.
That’s just my notion.
Crossing the ocean,
To your plan. I’m up and down.
Lep.
From Bot’ny Bay,
Bet.
We’ll take a prance,
Lep.
In London gay,
Bet,
To sing and dance,


Both.
With a fal lal de ral, &c.
GLEE, — Governor, Flimsy, and Dive.
Fill every glass;
For punch inspires us.
And fires us
With courage, love, and joy ;
Punch so divine.
Who would decline;
Drinking, my lad, can never tire us.
Fill every glass, &c.
SONG, — Dive.
Air, —“ Bay of Biscay O!"
The playhouse doors were open,
The crowd began to roar.
When, for a gold watch groping,
They nabb’d me, —what a bore !
I said ’twas but a lark,
Which happen’d in the dark ;
But I lay,
Till next day.
In the watch-house safely, O !
At Bow-street, on the morrow.
When traps and scouts were by,
I tipp’d them shame and sorrow.
But that was all my eye.
Committed with a crew,
I swore I’d prove true blue.
Mittimus,
Without fuss,
Sent us all to Newgate, O!
For seven long years transported.
’That is the time o’day!
With kiddy coves assorted,
I drive all cares away.
Though now I’m up the spout,
My time will soon be out;
Then I’ll sail.
With the gale,
From the Bay of Bot’ny, O!


ECHO DUET, — Don Giovanni and Leporello.
(From “ The Americans.”)
D. Gio.
Now hope, now fear, my bosom rending,
I’m sure ’tis half-past twelve o’clock;
Where can Lep. his time be spending ?
What can delay the stupid block ?
(Lep. within,—“ block!”)
Hark! I think I hear him trotting,
Soon he must be with me here.
(“ with me here.”)
If once blown be all our plotting,
We’d come in for snacks I fear.
(“ snacks I fear.”)
’Twasnothim: this is most tiring;
I’d rather see him than a pound.
(“ than a pound.”)
Ah sure, dear Don, that note is thine;
The echoing sound alone is mine.
(“ alone is mine.")
’Tis—’tis his voice that meets my ear;
Say, where art thou whose voice I hear %
(“ hear.”)
Oh! quickly speak—no longer roam;
I wish we once were safe at home.
hep.
Yes, Don, ’tis I, your Lep. is near.
D. Gio.
Where art thou now ?
(Lep. — entering.)
I’m here !—l’m here!
SERENADE.
Air—“ May Moon”
D. Gio.
’Tis now the dead of night, my love,
From thy chamber window a light, my love,
I’ve a ladder of ropes,
And a world of hopes ;
Then quick let us take our flight, my love.


The moon is shining bright, my dear.
Our roving steps to light, my dear;
Then into my arms.
With all thy young charms;
Descend, and Giovanni, delight my dear.
FINALE.
Air — “ Rob Roy.”
Gov.
You’re a most notorious scamp,
111 Don Giovanni, O,
And from hence you must decamp;
111 Don Giovanni, &c.
Not content to steal my child.
Would you kidnap mother Wild ?
But your tricks for once I’ve spoil’d;
Rake hell, Gio. &e.
D. Gio.
Moderate your rage, my buck.
Don’t be a zany, O;
See how calm I bear ill luck \
Still gay Giovanni, O; -
Take things cool, like me, I pray.
I’ll be off at peep o’ day.
So farewell to Bot ny Bay,
Roving Giovanni, &e.
Lop.
What will now become of me ?
Poor Leporello O!
Governor, befriend me, pray.
That’s a good fellow, O ;
I’d much rather stay behind.
With my Betty Martin, kind,
She’s the thing,—-just to my mind.
Poor Leporello, O.
THE END.
