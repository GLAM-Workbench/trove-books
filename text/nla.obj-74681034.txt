The Case Against The Transport Workers Act
This leaflet Is issued with the
endorsement of the general sec-
retaries of the Waterside Work-
ers? Federation and the Federated
Ironworkers? Association the
two trade unions whose members
made a stand at Port Kembla for
democracy.
Here is a practical way for every citizen to carry on the fight
against the Transport Workers Act which was made at Port Kembla,
where in 1938-39 180 wharf labourers, 4,000 steel workers, and many
miners and men of other callings, preferred short rations to conniving
at the destruction of their fellow-workers in distant China.
Every elector who has any feeling for his fellow citizens ought to
send immediately to the Federal Member of Parliament for the district
in which he lives, this leaflet with his own name and address filled in on
the form provided below.
Waterside workers and seamen have been and are subject to the licensing
provisions of the Transport Workers Act, that indefensible piece of class
legislation which deprives many thousands of Australian citizens of the free-
dom of action which the rest of us enjoy. Maritime workers call this Act the
Dog Collar Act.
Why? BECAUSE THOUSANDS OF WHARF WORKERS AND SEA-
MEN ARE FORCED BY THE ACT TO BE LICENSED AND LABELLED
LIKE SO MANY DOGS. THEY CANNOT GET WORK UNLESS THEY
BUY A LICENCE.
A WORKER WHO DOES NOT PRODUCE HIS LICENCE WHEN
CALLED UPON TO DO SO BY ANY STATE OR COMMONWEALTH
POLICEMAN, AT ANY TIME, ANYWHERE, BREAKS THE LAW.
WORSE THE ?LICENSED WORKER? IF HE DOES NOT OBEY
WHAT A COMMITTEE CHOOSES AFTERWARDS TO DECIDE WAS A
?LAWFUL ORDER,? MAY BE STRIPPED OF HIS LICENCE, AND
HENCE OP HIS MEANS OP GETTING A LIVING. HE MAY BE DE-
PRIVED OF HIS LICENCE FOR ANY PERIOD THE COMMITTEE
NAMES, FROM A MONTH UP TO A YEAR.
What is this Committee, that the Act can set np in every port of the
Commonwealth, to rule the lives of the Australian waterside workers and
seamen ?
It consists of (1) the port licensing officer, who is a Government servant;
(2) and (3) two representatives of the shipping companies; (4) a representa-
tive of the Waterside Workers Federation; and (5) a representative of "other
licensed workers.? The Committee is called together at the will of the port
licensing officer or the Attorney-General, and THREE is a quorum.
WHAT IS THE ACT FOR! It was introduced 101 years ago by the Bruce
Government TO BREAK A STRIKE of waterside workers. Its provi-
sions were extended by the Lyons Government to the seamen in 1935, TO
BREAK A STRIKE. Again in May, 1938, the Government threatened
to use the Act TO COEROE THE SYDNEY WATERSIDERS INTO
LOADING WAR MATERIAL which would be used against the Chinese

And at Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and Hobart.
March, 1939.
This leaflet is circulated
throughout Australia, the Left
Book Club assisting in its dis-
tribution. Copies were supplied
to all delegates at the All-
Australian Trade Union Con-
gress held in Melbourne in
March, 1939,
people. By this threat the Government overrode the men?and the pro-
tests of Bishops, Trade Unions, Peace Societies and all democratic or-
ganisations of Australia.
These are some incidents of the infamous history of the Act up to No-
vember, 1938. Late that month, the Waterside Workers Federation Branch
at Port Kembla refused to load pig iron which Australia needs but which a
great Australian firm had consigned to the profitable war market of Japan?-
Japan, which has been branded an aggressor by the League of Nations, of
which Australia is a member!
The Commonwealth Government ordered the Port Kembla men to load the
?Dalfram.? When they refused, it threatened to impose the licensing pro-
visions of the Transport Workers Act. They held out, and the licensing pro-
visions were imposed. BUT NOT A WORKER TOOK OUT A LICENCE.
For two months the handful of Port Kembla watersiders, aided by the
steel workers and seamen, and by trade unions throughout the country,
held out against the Government, sacrificed their comforts, even many of
their necessities, for the sake of maintaining a principle.
AND WHEN THEY WENT BACK TO WORK, IT WAS WITH THE
GOVERNMENT?S PROMISE TO RECONSIDER ITS POLICY OF PER-
MITTING THE EXPORT OF PIG IRON WHILE FORBIDDING THE EX-
PORT OF ORES FROM WHICH THE PIG IRON IS MADE. (Cabinet de-
cided in February to continue to permit the export of pig iron.)
Moreover, they did not go back until the Government undertook to remove
the operation of the Transport Workers Act from Port Kembla. The men of
Port Kembla beat the Act and beat the Government.
But the Act cannot always be beaten. Port Kembla is the centre of an
industrial district, in which it is hard for authority to discriminate against any
section of workers and citizens. But Melbourne is not so completely organised;
and the full provisions of the Transport Workers Act are in force there.
and have been for years. Sydney and Brisbane are not completely organised.
The workers of those ports and others can only be restored to the full rights
of citizenship by the repeal of the Transport Workers Act and the destruction
of the licensing system.
If the Attorney-General wishes, as he says he does, to regulate the water-
side labour supply so that all workers can get a reasonable living, then
let him institute a Port Register which shall be managed by the union
under Government inspection. BUT THE TRANSPORT WORKERS
ACT MUST BE REPEALED.
