PREFACE
Precursors of the Australian Joint Copying Project
Although original sources in the Public Record Office had been used by F.P. Labilliere,
G.W. Rusden and James Bonwick in their historical writing, no systematic copying was
done until Bonwick was appointed archivist by the New South Wales Government in 1887.
The Government decided to publish his transcripts in the series Historical Records of New
South Wales, 1892—1901. The original transcripts are now held in the Mitchell Library.
Following Federation, the editor of Historical Records of New South Wales, F.M. Bladen,
urged the establishment of a Commonwealth archives office in association with a national
library modelled on the Library of Congress in the United States. In reporting to the
Commonwealth Parliament in 1903, he named the Public Record Office in London, one of
the many he had just visited, as beyond question the finest archives office in the world. He
was especially impressed by the facilities it offered for taking certified copies of the records,
and he recommended the extensive transcription of Australian material, for a ‘very trifling
cost’. He added that Tf when the transcriptions were made in London, one of the many
contrivances for multiplying writing were used, and six additional copies made, one for each
of the State Public Libraries, they would, I am sure, be treasured by those institutions as
amongst their most valued possessions’. In his view, only the index, which he urged should
be compiled at the time of transcription, needed to be printed.
The Commonwealth Parliamentary Library Committee accepted a responsibility for
preserving the records of national life and making them available, when in 1911 it undertook
the publication of the Historical Records of Australia, the successor to Bladen’s work for
New South Wales. Thirty-three volumes appeared until publication was suspended
following editorial difficulties, the last volume having appeared in 1925.
The Australian Joint Copying Project
The development of microfilm in the interwar years opened new possibilities for an even
more extensive and yet economic copying program. In 1939 the Commonwealth National
Library and the Public Library of New South Wales jointly made proposals for copying at
the Public Record Office. These proposals were upset by the outbreak of war, but in
October 1945 an agreement was signed under which the two libraries would jointly
microfilm material in the Public Record Office, London, relating to Australia. Filming began
in August 1948 and for ten years the work of the Project was confined entirely to the Public
Record Office.
In 1960 Phyllis Mander-Jones was appointed the first full-time A.J.C.P. Officer and, while
not neglecting the Public Record Office, she immediately set off in pursuit of private records
of Australasian interest throughout the British Isles. Her work, which ultimately led to the
publication of Manuscripts in the British Isles relating to Australia, New Zealand, and the
Pacific (1972), resulted in film being produced of records located in many of the smaller
and lesser-known repositories in Britain and Ireland.


Participation of Australian libraries in the Project has fluctuated over the years. At a
conference in 1949 agreement was reached that the State Libraries would participate to the
extent of buying the microfilms of all material relating to their own State. Subsequently,
however, some libraries withdrew from the A.J.C.P., while others participated more fully by
acquiring copies of all or most of the film produced by the Project.
In the late 1940 s the partners agreed that the geographical scope of the Project should be
extended to include material relating to New Zealand and the Pacific. The Alexander
Turnbull Library at Wellington joined the Project in 1953 and the filming of Colonial Office
records relating to New Zealand and Fiji commenced shortly afterwards. In 1958 the scope
was again extended to include much of South East Asia and Antarctica. This was found in
practice to be too ambitious, and after some years the A.J.C.P. largely reverted to its
original boundaries.
In 1988 the original partnership between the State Library of New South Wales and the
National Library ended with the withdrawal of the State Library of New South Wales from
the Project. The A.J.C.P. continued until 1993 under the direction of the National Library.
The State Library of Victoria, the National Library of New Zealand and the National
Archives of New Zealand continued to participate with the National Library of Australia in
sharing the costs of original filming. In addition, a number of Australian State and academic
libraries agreed to contribute to the costs of the salaries of the A.J.C.P. staff in London for
the period 1983-93.
In June 1993 the Australian Joint Copying Project came to an end. Films that were ordered
before that date continue to be received and copies are distributed to the other partners in
the Project. It is expected that the last reels will arrive in Australia in 1995.
The Microfilm
The achievements of what is believed to have been the longest running microfilming project
of its kind in the world have been substantial. It located, listed and described thousands of
classes and collections of Australian, New Zealand and Pacific records held in hundreds of
institutions, organisations and homes in almost every part of Britain and Ireland. It
produced and despatched to Australia over 10 000 reels of microfilmed records dating from
1560 to 1975.
For purposes of arrangement and description the A.J.C.P. film is divided into two series: the
Public Record Office Series and the Miscellaneous Series. Within the Public Record Office
Series, the records of the Colonial Office have been predominant, joined more recently by
the records of the Dominions Office. Almost 40 per cent of all A.J.C.P. film is taken up by
the despatches, correspondence, letterbooks and registers, dating from 1788 to 1951, of
these two departments. In addition to the huge classes dealing specifically with the
Australian, New Zealand and Pacific colonies, film has been acquired of many general
classes referring to such subjects as colonial appointments, honours, emigration, overseas
settlement schemes, the involvement of the Dominions in the World Wars and imperial
policies and relations generally.


Several other departments in the Public Record Office have also been the subject of filming,
including the Admiralty, Home Office, War Office, Air Ministry, Foreign Office, Privy
Council, Treasury, Board of Customs and Board of Trade. Material copied varies from log
books and station records (Admiralty) to muster books and pay lists for British regiments
stationed in Australia (War Office), diplomatic despatches (Foreign Office), ledgers and
accounts (Exchequer and Audit Department), registers of merchant shipping (Board of
Trade) and material relating to the transportation and administration of convicts (Home
Office and Prison Commission).
Collections of private records filmed as part of the Miscellaneous Series range from those of
the British Library and National Libraries of Wales, Scotland and Ireland to university
libraries, county record offices, museums, missionary societies, business archives and papers
held by private families and individuals.
A.J.C.P. Handbooks
In 1972 the National Library published the first part of the Australian Joint Copying
Project Handbook. To date, ten parts and some revised editions of A.J.C.P. Handbooks
have been issued. This present part of the A.J.C.P. Handbook is the revised edition of
Part 6, which was originally published in 1975.
The Handbook aims to provide a description of the microfilm at levels of progressively
greater detail, linking descriptions with reel numbers. Description at both general and
detailed levels enables a researcher to comprehend the context of particular records and to
reach relevant material more quickly.
The extent of the records microfilmed necessitates that the A.J.C.P. Handbook be issued in
multiple parts. Attention is drawn to the synopsis of the Handbook on the back cover of
each part, which lists the parts already published. The most concise summary of the
microfilm is provided by Part 1 , Shelf List of Copying in the Public Record Office, London;
Shelf List of the Miscellaneous Series , the last edition of which appeared in 1985. A new
edition of Part 1 will be published in due course.
At the detailed level, Parts 2-7 and 9-10 are class and piece lists for Public Record Office
records combined with a description of the contents of individual reels. Part 10 also
provides descriptions down to file level. Part 8 provides a description of each Miscellaneous
Series collection.
Users of the microfilm are also advised to consult the Guide to the Contents of the Public
Record Office (3 vols, London: H.M.5.0., 1963—68); and Phyllis Mander-Jones’
Manuscripts in the British Isles relating to Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific
(Canberra: Australian National University Press, 1972).
Access to Microfilm
A list of institutions holding P.R.O. and M Series film is included in Part 1 of the A.J.C.P.
Handbook. A.J.C.P. film is available for purchase and for interlibrary loan. Requests for
interlibrary loans should be sent to the Document Supply Service, National Library of Australia.


Requests to purchase microfilm should be directed to the Manuscript Librarian, National
Library of Australia.

INTRODUCTION
AIR MINISTRY
The Air Ministry was set up in January 1918 to administer the Royal Air Force. It was
headed by the Secretary of State for Air who was advised by the Air Council. From 1919 to
1945 the Ministry was also responsible for regulating civil aviation and from 1920 to 1940 it
was responsible for aircraft production. The Ministry was absorbed into the Ministry of
Defence in 1964.

EXCHEQUER AND AUDIT DEPARTMENT
The practice of declaring public accounts before the Lord High Treasurer and the
Chancellor of the Exchequer originated in the sixteenth century. An Act of 1785 created
five Commissioners of Audit and the number was increased to ten in 1806. In 1866 the
Exchequer and Audit Department was created, taking over the responsibilities of the
Commissioners of Audit and the Comptroller General of the Exchequer. The Department
has always been independent of the Executive and is responsible directly to Parliament for
auditing, certifying and reporting on departmental accounts.

METEOROLOGICAL OFFICE
The Meteorological Department of the Board of Trade was set up in 1855 and became the
Meteorological Office in 1863. In 1867 it was transferred to a Meteorological Committee
and received a grant-in-aid from the Treasury. In 1877 the Committee was replaced by a
Meteorological Council, comprising five members nominated by the Royal Society and the
Hydrographer of the Navy.
B. 1 Correspondence and papers of Kew Observatory. The Observatory was
erected by George 111 in 1768. In 1866 it established a close relationship
with the Meteorological Office and, although later controlled by the Royal
Society and the National Physical Laboratory, it reverted to the control of
the Meteorological Office in 1910.

BOARD OF TRADE
The Committee of the Council on Trade and Plantations was established in 1784 to regulate
trade between Britain, its colonies, France and the United States. Following its
reconstruction in 1786, it became known as the Board of Trade. Its business was originally
conducted at nominal meetings attended by the President and Vice-presidents, but they
ceased after 1845. Originally its functions were consultative, but in the mid-nineteenth
century its work became increasingly administrative, including the regulation of railways,
merchant shipping and joint stock companies. Although some of its functions were later
transferred to other departments, it remained responsible for commercial relations with
other countries, imports and exports, tariffs, industrial development, trade statistics, patents
and copyright, weights and measures, companies, bankruptcy and insurance. In 1970 the
Board was absorbed by the Department of Trade and Industry.

Originally responsible for the revision of tariffs and trade negotiations
with foreign countries, it took over a number of functions in 1863,
including copyright, trademarks, joint stock companies, industrial
exhibitions and quarantine. In 1872 it gave up responsibility for
commercial treaties and colonial tariffs and amalgamated with the
Statistical Department. In 1893 it became the Commercial, Labour and
Statistical Department.
B.T. 60 Correspondence of the Department of Overseas Trade. It was established
in 1918 and, under the control of both the Foreign Office and the Board
of Trade, was responsible for collating and disseminating overseas
commercial intelligence and administering commercial services abroad. It
also organised British participation in overseas exhibitions and in 1925
took over the administration of the Imperial Institute from the Colonial
Office. It was abolished in 1946.

colonial vessels.
CHANCERY
The Chancellor was originally the King’s principal secretary and adviser, and keeper of the
Great Seal. By the fourteenth century he was entrusted with hearing petitions to the King in
Council and empowered to proceed by rules of equity and conscience. His staff became
domiciled in Chancery Lane and, while their executive functions were curtailed, their legal
powers grew rapidly. Equity jurisdiction became the main function of Chancery. In 1873
Chancery became part of the Supreme Court of Judicature.
C. 114 Exhibits of Masters of Chancery. Masters of Chancery reported to the Court
of Chancery on matters of practice and the state of proceedings in litigation
and had custody of title deeds and other original instruments which the Court
placed under their care. The office was abolished in 1852.
CABINET OFFICE
The Committee of Imperial Defence was set up in 1902 as an advisory body to assist in the
formulation of defence policy and to ensure the coordination of military, naval and civil
authorities in time of war. It acquired a permanent secretariat in 1904. Following the
creation of the War Cabinet in December 1916, the Secretariat, headed by Sir Maurice
Hankey, was placed at its disposal. In 1919 the Secretariat was reorganised into two
branches —Home Affairs; and Imperial, External Affairs and Defence —both headed by
Hankey. The Cabinet Office has always been responsible for preparing agenda, circulating
papers, keeping minutes and sending extracts from the minutes to the relevant departments.
Cab. 21 Correspondence, memoranda and other papers relating to the Defence
Schemes Malaya.

Cabinet (1916-19), Secretary of the Cabinet (1919-38).
Cab. 133 Minutes, memoranda and other papers of Commonwealth and
international conferences.


BOARD OF CUSTOMS
The Board of Customs was established in 1671 with the appointment of six commissioners
to manage the customs duties in England and Wales. It amalgamated with the boards for
Scotland and Ireland in 1823. It was eventually headed by three commissioners. The
Treasury had overall authority for the administration of customs, while the Board dealt with
the practical aspects of the system, including collecting customs revenue, preventing and
detecting smuggling, collecting statistics of imports, exports and shipping, and enforcing
navigation and trade laws. In 1909 the Board took over the management of excise duties
and became the Board of Customs and Excise.
Cust. 34 Papers relating to plantations. From the seventeenth century the Board of
Customs was responsible for collecting duties and for administering the
navigation laws in British plantations and colonies. Until 1856 it
appointed customs officials in Australia and New Zealand and supervised
the colonial customs administrations.
MINISTRY OF LABOUR
The Ministry of Labour was established in 1916, taking over a number of responsibilities of
the Board of Trade, especially those relating to industrial relations and relief for the
unemployed. From 1939 to 1959 it was the Ministry of Labour and National Service and its
functions included the management of employment exchanges, recruitment and employment
of foreign workers, resettlement of members of the Armed Forces, industrial rehabilitation
and training of the disabled, and the administration of the youth employment service.
Lab. 13 Files of the Overseas Department of the Ministry of Labour. The
Department was created in 1942 and took over responsibility for relations
with the international bodies. It maintained close relations with the
Dominions in coordinating the allocation of labour during World War II
and was later responsible for the emigration of persons from Britain for
employment overseas.
MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT
The Ministry of Transport was established in 1919, taking over from other departments
powers concerning railways, canals, roads, bridges, vehicles, harbours and docks. In 1941 it
merged with the Ministry of Shipping (set up in 1939) to form the Ministry of War
Transport. In 1946 it reverted to its original title, but retained both inland transport and
shipping functions. The Ministry of Shipping had inherited some of the records of the
Transport Department of the Admiralty; other records can be found in Adm. 108 (see
AJ.C.P. Handbook , Part 7).
M.T. 32 Journals of surgeon superintendents in charge of convicts, containing rules
and regulations, lists of names, details of diet and medical reports.


PRIVY COUNCIL
In the fourteenth century the King’s Council, comprising his chief ministers of state and a
few bishops, peers and household officials, became known as the Privy Council. Among
other functions, it provided advice on whether petitions to the King should be granted and
acted as a judicial tribunal in cases where the common law was unable to provide remedies.
By the eighteenth century it had lost most of its administrative functions, although some
functions were carried out by committees of the Council, such as Trade and Plantations
(1784) and Education (1839). It retained certain judicial powers, such as being the court of
final appeal in the Admiralty jurisdiction. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council,
established by statute in 1833, heard civil and criminal appeals from courts of the overseas
dominions and colonies.
P.C. 1 Unbound papers on a very wide range of subjects, including charters,
commissions, public health, military and naval stores, schools, the colonies
(1785—1800) and the Convict Establishment (1819-44).
P.C. 2 Minutes of proceedings, orders, proclamations and other papers of the
Privy Council and reports and papers of Privy Council committees.
PRISON COMMISSION
Until 1877 prisons such as Newgate were administered by the central courts, while justices
of the peace were responsible for county and borough gaols. The Home Office had powers
of supervision over convict and local prisons and also controlled the convict hulks. In 1846
a Surveyor General of Prisons was appointed. In 1877 local prisons were brought under
government management, the Prison Commission being established as a statutory board to
administer and inspect prisons in England and Wales.
P. Com. 2 Registers of convicts and other records of British prisons and convict
hulks.
PAYMASTER GENERAL S OFFICE
The Office of Paymaster General of the Forces originated in the seventeenth century. In
1835 the Paymaster General’s Office was established, taking over four offices dealing with
the pay of the Armed Services, including the Paymaster General of the Forces and the
Treasurer of the Navy. In 1848 the Office absorbed the offices of Paymaster of Exchequer
Bills and Paymaster of the Civil Service, thereby becoming the principal paying agent of the
government and the banker for all government departments other than the revenue
departments.
P.M.G. 1 Entry books and registers of in- and out-letters concerning the Army
Establishment, including letters from Sir Thomas Brisbane to W.P.
Craufurd of the Paymaster General’s Office.


PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE
Since 1735 the residence and office of the Prime Minister has been located at No. 10
Downing Street. Until 1916 the Office consisted of only two or three private secretaries,
but it greatly expanded under David Lloyd George. The Office comprises private secretaries
seconded from departments, the Secretary for Appointments and a small permanent staff.
PREM. 3 Papers dealing with defence and operational subjects (1940-45),
reflecting the activities of Winston Churchill as Minister for Defence.
BRITISH TRANSPORT COMMISSION
In 1921 the various British railway companies were amalgamated into four groups. In 1939,
with the outbreak of war, the British Government took over control of railways and in 1947
the four companies were nationalised. Railways then became one of the responsibilities of
the British Transport Commission and were administered by the Railway Executive. In 1962
the Commission was abolished and railways were placed under the control of the British
Railways Board. At the time of nationalisation the Commission inherited the records of the
four private railways, which in turn had taken over the records of other companies in 1921,
and following earlier amalgamations.
RAIL 1008 British transport historical records, including records of the Great
Western Railway Company. Sir Daniel Gooch was Locomotive
Superintendent of the Company (1837-64) and was Consulting Engineer
for the Geelong and Melbourne Railway Company which began
construction in 1853.
TREASURY
The Treasury began to emerge as a distinct department in the sixteenth century and by 1660
had its own office in Whitehall and a permanent staff distinct from that of the Exchequer.
The Board of the Treasury was established in 1635 and the Lords Commissioners met as a
board to discuss matters of detail until the middle of the nineteenth century. It then took
shape as a ministerial department, headed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, while
maintaining a special relationship with the Prime Minister as First Lord of the Treasury. It
has always been responsible for overseas finance, government expenditure, economic
coordination and the management of the Civil Service.
T. 1 Original correspondence of the Treasury Board, together with reports and
draft minutes. Arranged chronologically, apart from a collection of
papers, the ‘Long Papers’ (c. 1820-40), which are grouped by subject.
T. 7 Out-letter books relating to colonial affairs.
T. 39 Accounts of foreign and colonial stations (1846-76), miscellaneous
accounts and ledgers.


T. 46 Victualling lists (1763-1820) relating to Grenada, Halifax, Tenerife, Rio
de Janeiro, Cape of Good Hope, Quebec and Montreal.
T. 62 Maps and plans which accompanied letters and reports.
T. 64 Miscellaneous papers, including colonial ordinances, trade returns, law
opinions, papers on Crown lands and shipping.
T. 172 Miscellaneous papers of the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s Office. The
Chancellor of the Exchequer became the working head of the Treasury in
the eighteenth century and was concerned with the whole range of
Treasury business.
T. 176 Papers of Sir Otto Niemeyer (1883-1971), Controller of Finance in the
Treasury (1922—27).
T. 229 Files of the Central Economic Planning Section which was transferred to
the Treasury in 1947.
T. 236 Files of the Overseas Finance Division of the Treasury which was set up in
1914 under John Maynard Keynes. Initially concerned with mobilising
overseas investment and borrowing, it later dealt with reparations and the
balance of payments.
T. 247 Papers of the economist John Maynard Keynes, Ist Baron Keynes, arising
from his work on the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s Consultative Council
(1940-46).
BOARD OF LONGITUDE
The Board of Longitude was set up by Act of Parliament in 1714 ‘for the discovery of
longitude at sea and for examining, trying and judging of all proposals, experiments and
improvements relating to the same’. The Commissioners, who included the Lord High
Admiral, the President of the Royal Society and various Members of Parliament, were
empowered to advance sums for promising schemes and to make a reward of £2O 000 to
the discoverer of a method of determining longitude with a margin of error of less than 30
miles. The Board met for the first time in 1737. The problem of determining longitude was
solved with the invention of a chronometer by John Harrison, a copy of which was tested on
Cook’s second Pacific voyage in 1772—75. The Board of Longitude was abolished in 1828.
At the time of microfilming, the records of the Board of Longitude were held at the Public
Record Office. They were later transferred to the Royal Greenwich Observatory at
Herstmonceux Castle, Hailsham, Sussex, and more recently to Cambridge University
Library.


MAPS AND PLANS
Maps in the Public Record Office fall into two categories: maps extracted by the P.R.O.
staff from correspondence and other records, and maps assembled in a departmental library
and transferred en bloc to the P.R.O. Maps in the first category are given a number with a
prefix which indicates their origin; for instance, MPG indicates that the map was originally
in a Colonial Office class and MPR indicates that the map was in a Rail class. There are
many Australian and New Zealand maps, both printed and manuscript, in the map classes,
but only eight were filmed by the A.J.C.P. An example of the second category is C.O. 700.
The maps in this class filmed by the A.J.C.P. are listed in Part 2 ofth e A.J.C.P. Handbook.
A.J.C.P. LISTS
Requests for copies of the A.J.C.P. lists, which contain more detailed piece descriptions,
should be directed to the Manuscript Librarian, National Library of Australia.
