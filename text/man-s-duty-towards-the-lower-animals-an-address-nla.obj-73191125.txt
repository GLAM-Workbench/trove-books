MAN?S DUTY TOWARDS THE
LOWED ANIMALS.
?A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast.?? Proverbs xii. 10.
The committee of the Victorian Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, have asked the clergy to bring the objects
of the society before their congregations from their pulpits.
Although I am aware there is a prejudice in some minds against
what are called moral sermons, yet I very gladly avail myself of
this opportunity to urge upon you a moral duty on this single
subject. I do so, because I have myself heard sermons in London
on single points of duty, which I shall never forget, and for
which I shall be grateful to the end of my days. And I do so,
because the subject I have undertaken to bring before you, to-
night, is eminently a practical one, and deals with our every-day
life. It certainly gives no scope for a theological argument, or
for a closely-reasoned sermon, but it is a wide field for a plain,
earnest, practice appeal, such as all may feel the force of and
apply to themselves. I have selected as the title of my sermon,
Man?s Duty towards?the Lower Animals; and I have taken the
text suggested by one of the daily journals. Among the many
moral virtues, and their contrary vices, brought before us in the
Book of Proverbs, the one I have just read is not perhaps the
least striking. It teaches us, in a general way, the treatment an
animal will receive from the hands of a right-minded and good


man: *'A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast.? That
is to say, the man who is under any Divine influence, who recog-
nizes the love and mercy of God, as extended to himself, such
a man will manifest a compassionate and kindly disposition
towards the brute creation. He will deem it cruelty to put
even the lowest animal to needless pain. He would especially
scorn to abuse those useful creatures which conduce so greatly
to the comfort, convenience, and support of life. But I
need hardly tell you that we are not a righteous race, we
are not even universally merciful. We are a fallen race,
prone to sin, and prone to abuse the best gifts of God.
And among the numerous crimes of which man is guilty,
that of cruelty to animals is not the least prominent. We are
not even in our treatment of the dumb animals what Adam was
in his innocency. The dominion which he exercised over the
brute creation, in Paradise, was a dominion of love, of kindness.
Adam was incapable of committing an act of cruelty before he
was guilty of the sin of disobedience. After the fall, man?s
dominion over the lower animals was a dominion of fear. When
Noah came out of the ark these words were addressed to him,
? and the fear of you and the dread of you shall he upon every
least of the earth,? &c* There was a complete change of feel-
ing, and with this reversion of feeling between man and beast,
there necessarily followed a reversion of treatment. Man no
longer possessed that peaceable and quiet dominion over the
beast of the field which prevailed in Paradise. The brute creation
no longer yielded peaceable, quiet submission, to man s authority.
It is with this altered state of things that I have to point out?
Man?s duty towards the lower animals. ?
Before we can understand our duty we must rightly compre-
hend our relationship.
What, then, is our relationship to the lower animals ? What
does Scripture teach us concerning this ? This is my first point.
The Scriptures teach us that God has given to the lower animals
a very important place in the world; they tell us also that they
* Gen. ix. 2.


have occupied a conspicuous place in God?s dealings with created
things. For example, when the wickedness of man provoked
God?s wrath, He said, ? I will destroy man whom I have created
from the face of the earth, both man and beast, and the creep-
ing things, and the fowls of the air.?* And when the plagues
were sent, it was upon every man and beast that the calamity fell.f
When the consecration of the first-horn of the Levites was
commanded by God, it included the firstborn both of man and
beast.X When the four sore judgments are spoken of by the
prophet Ezekiel, the man and the beast are joined together in
Ag?ain, when the goodness of God in the preservation
of life is mentioned by the Psalmist, that of man and beast are
united together, and spoken of in the same breath.\\ And when
Jonah preached to the Ninevites, the deprivations to which the
beasts were to be subjected were similar in kind to those of the
peopled There is indeed one-particular passage where, referring
to the mere death of our bodies, it is stated that man has no
pre-eminence over the beast: i.e., as regards our bones and flesh,
our material frames, we both alike return to the dust from whence
we came.**
And animals have their rights established by the authority of
Holy Scripture. God declared the rights of cattle from Mount
Sinai, and said that they should have a Sabbath, ? Thou shalt
not do any work, thou, nor thy cattle Hence cattle have a
right to one day in seven for rest. And God declared with
infinite emphasis that the ox on the threshing floor should have
the privilege of eating some of the grain as he trod it out, and
muzzling was forbidden.
Thus you will easily see from Holy Scripture how God has
often dealt with man and beast jointly?in other words, we see
their juxtaposition in the Bible : they are often side by side.
Passing? from God?s what do history and experience teach
us ? History and experience teach us that there is in the lower
animals an instinct very similar to the instinct in man: their
*Gen. vi. 7. f Ex - ix - 19 - t Numb. viii. 17. ï¿½ Ezek. xiv. 13, 17, 21,
|| Ps. xxxvi. 6. Jonab iii. 7. ** Eccl. iii. 19.


juxtaposition is traceable here also. Of course we know brute
creatures have no mind to which they appeal, ? they originate no
plan, they comprehend no principle, they anticipate no evil, the
past and the present and the future are one to them. They are
not immortal, and hence they are not criminal.? But they have an
instinct in many particulars very similar to that of human beings.
For example, the affection of the mother towards her young
throughout creation, and the obedience of the young to the
teaching of the parents are the same. An infant is in the fullest
sense, dependent on instinct; its capacity to discern, and its
strength to act, are no greater than in the lower animals. In the
tie which binds a mother and her infant, the strongest energies of
instinct are put forth. The desire for food in the infant is met
by a corresponding impulse in the mother, and the provision
which nature supplies, and of which the infant partakes, is pro-
ductive of the fondest pleasure. Now, this same instinct is
implanted in most of the lower animals. Most of the animals of
every country teach their young- what to eat and what to avoid ?
what to fear, and what to confide in. The watchful care and
tender love of the mother over her young, from the merest insect
to the noblest animal, is one of the most beautiful instincts in all
creation. It would be easy to give a list of cases of a different
nature to that mentioned. For example?There is an instinctive
sympathy in suffering in some of the lower animals which might
teach many human beings a valuable lesson. A surgeon in Leeds
records a remarkable instance of this in a dog. He found a little
spaniel lame, he carried it home, bandaged up his leg-, and after a
few days turned him out. The dog returned to the surgeon s
house every morning till his leg was perfectly well. At the end
of several months this spaniel again presented himself at the
surgeon?s door, in company with another dog, which had also
been lamed, and he intimated, as well as piteous and intelligent
looks could intimate, that he desired the same assistance to he
rendered to his friend as had been bestowed upon himself. This
compassion for the suffering dog, and the communication of the
relief he had received, and the appeal to the humane surgeon, the


writer truly remarks, is as extraordinary a piece of sagacity as
can be found in all the annals of animals.
Then there is an instinctive knowledge of locality in some of
the dumb animals, which is very remarkable. Dr. Jarrold relates
a case which shows this even more forcibly than that well known
to exist in every migratory bird, and many domestic animals
when removed to a distance. He refers to an ass which was
shipped on board a frigate bound from Gibraltar to Malta. The
vessel struck on some sands at some distance from the shore; the
ass was thrown overboard to give it a chance of swimming to
land, ?it was a poor chance, for the sea was running so high that
a boat which left the ship was lost. A few days afterwards,
however, the ass presented himself for admittance at the gates of
Gibraltar, and proceeded to the stables he had formerly occupied.
His late owner concluded that, from some accident, the animal
had never been shipped on board the frigate, and it was only on
the return of the vessel that the mystery was explained; and it
turned out that the ass had not only swam safely to shore, but
without guide of any kind, had found its way back to Gibraltar,
a distance of more than 200 miles, through a mountainous and
intricate country.
Thus, from what I have said, it will be seen?l st. That God
has, in His word, and in His dealings with created beings, often
joined man and beast together. 2nd. That history and experience
teach us that there are many points of similarity between them.
But man, of course, is at the head of creation. Yes. He alone
has been gifted by God with reason as well as instinct, hence his
superiority over the lower animals. Since then God has placed
man at the head of created beings, and made him a responsible
and an immortal creature, he has, to a large extent, control over
them. How is he to exercise that control ? or, what is ? Man's
duty towards the lower animals ? ? This is the question I now
propose to deal with. In one sentence, I would say, as a general
rule, there is but one law which should regulate our conduct
towards them, and that is the lam of kindness. Since God has
given to animals such a prominent place in His Word?since


God has given them instinct, in many points similar to that
implanted in the human race?what right has man to treat them
with needless cruelty ? The one great principle which should
guide all our common every-day life, in regard to the use of
animals, is kindness. Our treatment, if we are right-minded and
right-hearted men, will he as far as possible removed from
cruelty. All anger and bitterness will be subdued, and a kind
and tender spirit will be cultivated.
It is not easy to define the exact limits to which we may go in
the destruction of some animals, because there are certain vermin
which we are justified in killing in order to prevent them from
taking more useful animals; but if killed in such a way as not to
subject them to needless torture, there will be no act of cruelty.
But these are not the cases contemplated by a society established
for the prevention of cruelty to animals. You all know there
are certain forms of cruelty which are forbidden by law, and
punishable by law. And, as a writer in one of our journals has
stated, ?it is mainly to prevent those forms of cruelty, and to
expose and punish the individual offenders, that societies are
established ? in all large cities, and that a kindred one is estab-
lished in this city. ? The Society is principally concerned in
putting the law into action, but it is very desirable that there
should be no necessity either for the law or for any agency
auxiliary to such a law. What is really to be wished is, that
better state of mind which would make a man recoil at the
thought of inflicting unnecessary suffering upon a poor creature
that cannot defend itself.? The cases, however, which have
already engaged the attention of the Society are a sufficient
proof that there is great need in this city of some protection for
the dumb animal.
But, brethren, it is not so much the lam of punishment that I
wish to bring before you as the Gospel of love. The law is
distinct enough in prescribing the penalty for cruelty ?, but how
much nobler for men to be ?merciful on principle?? a
principle based upon humanity, and that humanity based upon
the Word of God and the example of Christ. Surely it cannot be


denied that to inflict any kind of needless pain, for money or for
personal gratification, is an act unworthy of a reasonable being.
Everyone knows that many persons are compelled to use, and
some to destroy, animals for food, but there need be no real
cruelty. All unnecessary suffering can and ought to be avoided,
whether animals be used for our pleasure or are designed for our
food. There is something mean and cowardly in giving distress to
a dumb creature that has little or no power of resistance. Such
cruelty deserves no sympathy, hut the strongest condemnation.
And it would he easy to pour forth loud and strong and
sweeping denunciations against those who are guilty of such crimes.
We may feel justly indignant when acts of cruelty come before
our eyes, but in our efforts to prevent this cruelty a more
excellent way is open to us. We should use our best endeavours
to promote kindness towards them, by remonstrating in a proper
spirit. The converse of the title, Prevention of Cruelty, would
he Promotion of Kindness. And as a general principle, I think
it will he conceded that the cultivation of kindly feelings and
gentle practices towards the lower animals throughout the com-
munity, would do more towards the furtherance of the humane
objects of this Society than all Acts of Parliament. Besides
which a mutual advantage would result from the carrying out of
this principle: the exercise of kindness towards brute creatures
will help us to curb all unkindly feelings towards our fellow men.
Cruelty to animals betrays an unmanly disposition, a little mind
and a cold heart ? but kindness, even to the lowest insects, is one
of the characteristics of a manly spirit, of a great mind, and of
a warm, loving, Christian heart. As an illustration of this, I
would mention a circumstance which came under my own notice
a few months ago. When walking with our beloved Bishop, he,
leaning upon my arm, suddenly stopped, and without ceasing his
conversation, stooped down to turn over a beetle which was
struggling for life upon its back; when the beetle walked upon
his feet, we proceeded on our way, and the conversation was
uninterrupted by any remark upon what had been done for the
insect. How many would have passed heedlessly on without


thinking 1 so insignificant an insect worthy of notice ? And how
such an act reminds one of Cowper?s touching lines ?
? I would not enter on my list of friends
(Tho? graced with polish?d manners and fine sense,
Yet wanting sensibility) the man
Who needlessly sets foot upon a worm.
An inadvertent step may crush the snail
That crawls at evening in the public path ;
But he that has humanity, forewarned,
Will tread aside and let the reptile live.?
You are, doubtless, aware it has been found that the most effectual
method of training the horse is that which is conducted by
kindness. The taming of some animals under such treatment,
appears to me to be as much an act of kindness as that of civi-
lizing a savage. Some one has stated that the goodness of God to
irrational being?s is so universal, that we seldom hear the cry of
distress, excepting it comes through the hand of man. The whole
earth is filled with animal delight; the bee hums, the frog croaks,
the squirrel chatters, the quail whistles, the lark carols, the whale
spouts ; these and all animals have their joy, as great to them as
our joy is to us. They do not go about moping and melancholy,
but all seem to be happy in life. Why, then, should we ill-treat
them ? Should we not rather try to imitate God, and be kind
and tender and careful towards them, and promote their happi-
ness as opportunity presents itself? To do this is to look on the
subject from the highest stand-point. Let us aim at this, my
brethren. Let us try to rise superior to our mere duty towards
the lower animals, and strive and pray to carry out that one
grand law of kindness as a Christian grace : This is the standard
of God?s word, and Christ?s example. Let us teach this to our
children, and let us show by our example to them and to all with
whom we come in contact, that one of the great aims of our lives
is to be kind and tender-hearted. And, my brethren, when we
think how much misery, how many sorrows, how many human
lives are embittered by unkindness, we may easily see how much
happiness the opposite spirit will produce : when we remember
how unkind thoughts of others have caused heart-burnings in


ourselves, and what mischief and grief are caused by hard speeches
and severe actions, surely we may say unhindness is the crying
sin of social life. I say, then, let us each enter into judgment
with our own hearts, and compare our own lives, outward and
inward, with the standard of God?s word and Christ?s example.
Let us remember what we are by nature, and what we may be, if
we are not, by grace. Let us remember what Christ is to us, and
let us never forget that we profess to be His followers. And oh,
what an example He is ! Think of His life?how gentle,?how
patient,?how long-suffering,?how forgiving,?how slow to
punish,?how swift to bless,?so human,?so humane ! Sure I
am, my dear brethren, that the man who has been redeemed by
His blood, united to Him by faith, and sanctified by His spirit,
will have no heart to distress or cause needless torture to the
smallest or lowest of the animal creation, but will be one of
whom it may be said, in the fullest meaning of the text, that
? the righteous man regardeth the life of his beast.?
