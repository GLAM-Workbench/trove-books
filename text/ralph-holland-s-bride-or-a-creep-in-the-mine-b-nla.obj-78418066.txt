H Creep in the HDme.
It was a bright September morn,
When I began this tale;
The Lyre-bird sang his matins loud,
Down in the fern-tree dale.
The sun danced lightly on the hills
And glanced among the trees,
And waked to life a thousand flowers,
Whose fragrance scent the breeze.
Ralph Holland sprang up from his couch
And glancing o?er the lawn,
Said he ? Dear Nell, my time is up,
I go to work this morn.?

?And why so soon Ralph,? Nelly cried,
(Ah, why indeed so soon,)
Our married life has scarcely seen
One quarter of the moon.
? My leave you know expires dear Nell,
The beginning of this pay,
And so we must provide, dear Nell,
For the dark and rainy day ?
? The mine is very dark, dear Ralph,
?Tis dangerous and deep,
And oh, dear Ralph, I dreamt last night
That it was on the creep.?
? I am sure it will not matter much
If longer here you bide ;
Consider but a week to-day
That I became your bride.?
?Oil could dwell upon those eyes,
And cherry lips so sweet.
The common lot of man is work,
I work that we may eat.?

? So put away those foolish fears,
Don?t place me under ban,
They?ll say I fear to work the mine
Now I?m a married man ;
I?m sure you would not have me be
A subject for their mirth,
Their ridicule we keenly feel
Though never meant to hurt.?
?Go then, dear Ralph, go to your work,
Be brave, be firm, be true,
But, O ! I never can survive
If evil befalls you.?
He kissed her on her rosy cheeks
And ruby lips as well,
And kisses from.his finger tips,
He threw across the dell.
As he climbed up the rugged path
That led him to the mine ;
And from his belt the crib was slung
On which he had to dine.
He whistled gaily as he walked
Among the forest trees,
And echoed back the? magpie?s song
That warbled on the breeze.
So very soon he reached the mine,
For he was never slow,
And with the daylight shift went down
To work with them below.
With pick and gad, hammer and drill
Right merrily he wrought,
And deep in the earth?s darksome womb
For golden treasure sought.
The time flew on as time will fly,
When work goes merrily,
Another hour the shift is done,
The time is nearing three.
Ralph thought about his pleasant home,
And of his loving bride,
And how he?d tease her for her fears
When again by her side.

In fancy he could see her stand,
Still by the cottage door,
Or run to meet him at the creek,
Where oft they met before
He?ll cull for her the brightest flowers
That deck the forest glade ;
So when she sees him thus return
She?ll be no more afraid.
When lo ! a rumbling sound is heard,
A horrid crash and roar.
The lights went out and all was dark,
So they could see no more.
Ralph struck a light and looked around,
But no change could he see,
For everything seemed safe and sound
Where worked his mate and he.
? I never told you? cried his mate,
?The mine is on the creep,
But we all thought our timbers strong
It safely would keep.?
Down the level they come with speed,
Towards the shaft they run,
They saw the creep?s destroying work
In earnest was begun.
The flinty rocks were grinding there,
Each other into dust,
From every rough and open rent
The noxious gases burst,
And from the stoutest timbers now
The jagged splinters fly
And massive rocks came hustling down,
As they went running by.
? Now mate? cried Ralph, ? I must return
To save the lives of three,
So you speed on towards the shaft
And do not wait for me.
There?s Tom and Dick, and deaf old Dave
A-working up the rise,
It will not do to leave them to
Be taken by surprise.


His mate sped on and so was saved
Abng with many more,
But Ralph returned and from that hour
Was seen alive no more.

The midnight shift is slumbering,
An uneasy daylight sleep ;
The ill news speeds from hut to house,
? The mine is on the creep.?
Then springing from their beds they leave
Their long much-needed rest,
Hurrying on their working clothes
All speedily are dressed.

Then quickly to the mine they rush,
And climb the massive mound
And when the boss calls o?er the roll
Each at his post is found.
?And now, brave men,? the captain said,
? I must thank all of you,
To come so prompt at duty?s call,
You must be brave and true.?

?The mine is on the creep you see,
The shaft is twisted round,
And four and twenty of your mates
Are buried under ground.
Who volunteers to rescue them

From drive, from rise, from stope,
Should make their wills before they go
On this forlorn hope.
?I warn you all before you speak,
?Tis deep and dangerous mine,
No ill will shall be shown to those
Who think best to decline.?
A hundred voices shouted ? aye,
All down the mine we?ll go,
We know the dangers we?ve to meet,
Our mates are down below.?


A female form rushed on the brace
With wild dishevelled hair,
?Oh ! let me down below? she cried,
? My Ralph is buried there.?
A matron grasped her by the arm
And thus to her did say
?What can avail this feeble arm,
You best go home and pray.?
? Brave hearts, clear heads, strong arms are
there,
To rescue those we love,
Let woman?s aid be holy prayer
To the great God above.
You know ?tis His Almighty hand
That guides the bolts of heaven,
Sure 'hat same hand can stay the bolt
E?er half its course is driven.?
They gently led her to her home,
Where she essayed to pray,
But vain, alas, must be the prayer
When the heart is far away
In vain her eyes were cast above
Where brilliant stars did shine,
With clasping hands and bended knees,
Her thoughts were in the mine.

When the midnight shift was changing
The braceman?s thoughts engage,
A fair faced youth was seen to spring
On the descending cage.
In the dark he quickly glided
Three hundred fathoms deep,
Down a shaft that?s all in torsion,
In a mine that?s on the creep.
What could induce that youth to go,
With form and face so fair,
Where strong men gasped and fainted
For want of proper air.
Among the splintering timbers,
?Mid showers of falling rock,
Where stoutest hearts and strongest nerves
Went reeling from the shock.

Where earth itself was groaning,
As if in anguished pain,
And the noxious fumes inhaling
Went reeling through the brain,
Where the captain?s voice was shouting
Above the din and noise,
?Make firm your props, secure your caps,
Drive home your lathes my boys ?

Like lightning now the picks are driven
As stroke on stroke they ply,
The broken rock from shovel blades
Along the levels fly.
This constant stroke of work goes on
Without a moment?s rest,
Each nerve is to the utmost strained,
Each does his level best.
Hour after hour the work goes on
At a terrific pace,
When one man through exertion faints
Another takes his place.
Still, still the fight goes bravely on,
There's scarcely time for breath,
It is against Old Time they fight,
And his grim brother Death.

At length the pick went crashing through
An open space revealed ;
The poisonous gases rushing out,
The facemen backward reeled.
The stranger youth sprang to the face
And seized the fallen pick,
With a few strokes enlarged the hole
And passing through it quick,
Was speedily lost to sight in the
Impenetrable gloom.
Some miners trying to follow him
Were stopped for want of room.
Suddenly came a mighty roar,
With a terrific shock,
As down some open chasm rushed
An avalanche of rock,

That dreadful shock went rushing on
Extinguished every light,
And bursting through the magazine
Exploded the dynamite,
Which shattering all timbers round
Entombed three miners brave,
Who worked so hard throughout the night
Their buried mates to save.
But ah ! that blast, that cruel blast,
It poisoned all the air,
And hearts that beat so high with hope
Were crushed with black despair.
The miners all must leave the mine,
?Twere certain death to stay ;
Although the men must cease to work
The women yet may pray.
But one is missed, ah ! where is she ?
What evil hath betide ?
Search where they will there?s none can find
Ralph Holland?s loving bride.
Strange thoughts now flash across men?s minds
About the stranger youth.
Was it, indeed, Ralph Holland?s bride
To prove her love and truth,
Had dressed herself in male attire
And left her home above,
And risked her life in the dark mine
To j&in her faithful love ?
So when the mine had ceased to creep
And the country was still,
They set to work to find their mates
Again with right good will.
A stalwart miner soon they found,
The strange youth on his breast,
Three hundred fathoms neath the ground
They found their last cold rest.
The stranger youth, his cap removed,
His golden locks revealed
Another votary of true love
That could not be concealed.

The stalwart man and slender girl,
They buried side by side,
And on the humble stone was graved
?Ralph Holland and his Bride.?
There let them rest in honored peace,
The loving and the brave,
May all true lovers drop a tear
Upon their silent grave.
