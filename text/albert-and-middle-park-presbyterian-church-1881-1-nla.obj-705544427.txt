A FOREWORD, WHICH IS AN EXPLANATION.
THIS brochure carries a running narrative of hurrying
years. Like a streamlet wandering placidly through
verdant meadow and difficult tanglewood, heedless of
the luxuriant and fragrant growth about her, so this
story threads its way peacefully through much that
should be heeded, through ways redolent with the fragrance and
appeal of the good works of men and women, telling of activity,
growth and accomplishment.
Names that are memories, tasks that have long since
passed into forgetfulness, could not be recalled and retold in
these only too brief pages. In the Lamb’s Book of Life these
will be found, for is not this the promise, when those scrolls of
immortality shall be unfolded? Suffice it, then, this silver
thread among the gold of service, rendered in the name of the
Lord God and the Holy Saviour of men.
Perhaps some day a readier pen and a wiser head will
gather from the past story of this Church and parish something
more readable and more enduring. Nevertheless, this thread in
the garment of history is a sound one, and maybe it will prove
its usefulness.
Meanwhile may the past and the present mingle together
in laughter and chatter and song.
“Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
And never brought to min’?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
And auld lang syne?
For auld lang syne, my dear,
For auld lang syne;
We’ll tak a cup o’ kindness yet,
For auld lang syne.
And there’s a hand, my trusty here,
And gie’s a hand o’ thine,
And we’ll tak a right guid willie waught,
For auld lang syne.”

TO relate in cold type the history of any Kirk or parish
must appear a poor means of expression to those who
have lived through that Kirk’s varied experience. Yet
it is a convenient way of letting the mind’s eye see the
Kirk as she was, and is, and of acquainting the present
generation of her story.
Some Churches are like placid streams —nothing seems to
disturb them overmuch through the years. Albert Park has not
been of this sort. She has been more like the ever-restless sea.
She has had her increase, like the full-flow of a tropic “king”
tide, but her ebbing has been, at times, almost tropic, too, in its
depletion. Through the years, one notes the rise and fall of an
ever-moving community, so that scarcely at any one period of
a brief history of fifty years can it be said that this Kirk has
shown remarkable advances, and maintained them. The ebb
and flow have kept the Communicants’ Roll much at the same
level, though they have caused those registers to be scored
through and scarred, displaying only too well how this migra-
tion has hurt. Still, what cannot be cured must be endured.
The parish has continued, and, Laus Deo, still continues.
In the year 1881, the Reverend Alexander F. Knox had
gathered about him an adequate congregation, meeting for
worship in the Mechanics’ Hall, Cecil Street, Emerald Hill.
With a little imagination at work, we can see this man of faith
impressing his ideals, but the good folk are unable to respond
satisfactorily. We can depict the note of chagrin in his voice,
in this memorable year of grace, 1881, because he appears to
have cherished the thought that this little meeting should be
a faith society. “My friends,” we can imagine him saying, “it
has been my wish that we should meet here on the Lord’s Day
morning, to break bread, and to hear the Gospel preached at
night. I did not desire that mention should be made of money.
There was to be no collection—no offering of any kind. We
were to work purely, from day to day, on lines of faith. But
see! In this year, 1881, you have asked to become a Presby-
terian congregation; you seem to like the Presbyterian way of
doing things, and, perforce, I must yield to your wishes.” We
can imagine him speaking his disappointment, and we also see
the congregation, in a very irregular manner, forming itself into
a Presbyterian community. As a free-lance Presbyterian
Church, it elected its first Session Clerk, Mr. Macallister. Then
folk began to ask: “What newly-established Presbyterian Church
is this?” The congregation, too, began to feel the need of a
Presbytery, upon which to lean in times of difficulty and
uncertainty. Two hundred and thirty-four were present at the


tea meeting on October 1, 1881, held to commemorate the forma-
tion of what was termed The Cecil Street Presbyterian Church.
But this Church did not flourish like the proverbial green bay
tree, and soon the congregation felt the necessity of seeking
incorporation with the Presbyterian Church of Victoria.
The Presbytery of Melbourne appointed a commission to
meet the congregation, pointed out how irregular had been the
procedure of this Kirk in the past couple of years, took her
View of Albert Park Church
under a motherly wing, and strongly suggested this adopted
daughter should go to Albert Park, because it seemed a more
suitable field. The congregation bowed to the wishes of the
Presbytery, and on February 18, 1883, decided to worship in the
Albert Hall, Dundas Place, on the Lord’s Day mornings, and,
because the hall was not available on the Sunday evening, to
worship in the Mechanics’ Hall, Cecil Street, at night. The
name of the Kirk was also changed to that of the Albert Park
Presbyterian Church. Later, the State school at Albert Park
was used on Sunday evenings for divine worship, but on Decem-


ber 12, 1883, the Albert Hall, Dundas Place, was secured for
both services for twelve months. It was decided to give a call
to the Rev. A. F. Knox, at a stipend of £3OO, with house rent,
but Mr. Knox appears to have declined the call. As soon as the
congregation settled in Albert Park, and began operations in
earnest, a call was extended to the Rev. Thomas Edwin Ick,
M.A., of Sandhurst, at a stipend of £450 per annum. A block of
land was bought at the corner of Merton and O’Grady Streets
on February 7, 1884, at the price of £7 per foot. Up to this
time, no organ appears to have been used to assist the praise,
and on October 13, 1884, at a special meeting of the Board of
Management, after various expressions of opinions on organs as
a help to public worship, it was recommended that an organ be
purchased from the Rev. Mr. King, Howe Crescent Congrega-
tional Church, for the sum of £7O. An olfer to remove and
rebuild it in the new Church building in O’Grady Street, at a
cost. of £3O, appears to have been considered exorbitant, and
rejected. The first organ blower was appointed on February 5,
1885, at £3 per annum. The organ screen in front of the organ
stool was erected also in 1885. The opening service of the
Albert Park new Church was held on the third Sunday of
January, 1885. This Church, which was of wood, was built, it
is understood, by Mr. Harry Buckhurst, he being the architect
and builder, and was to cost, at the outside, £2300 (the building
itself £1843). The organ was placed in the south-west corner
of the Church, because there were objections to it being put at
the rear of the building. The opening celebrations were com-
pleted by means of a soiree. The Rev. T. E. Ick, M.A., gaining
his medical degree, resigned his pastorate in January, 1889. On
June 4 of the same year, a call was extended to the Rev.
Thomas William Dunn. The call was signed by 142 members
and 72 adherents, the stipend promised being £450 per annum.
Mr. Dunn was inducted during that year
Church extension to Middle Park was considered as early
as November 26, 1889, but the Kirk Session did not think the
time a favorable one for such development. The next Minister
was the Rev. Thomas Tait, M.A. (later M.A., 8.D.), now in a
leading charge in Canada; but, after a short ministry of a few
years, he accepted a call to Brunswick. The Rev. F. E. Oxer,
M.A., B.D. (now Professor of Systematic Theology and Church
History in the Theological Hall, Ormond College), towards the
end of the year 1896, accepted the call to Albert Park. In Sep-
tember, 1901, Mr. Oxer was translated to the charge of Kirk-
lands-Epping-Campbelltown, in the Tasmanian Midlands.
The Rev. J. A. Burns was called from Daylesford, and
became Minister of the parish early in 1902. During his
ministry, meetings of a combined nature, consisting of Albert


Park Board of Management and Armstrong Street Branch
Church Board of Managers, were held, to consider the building
of a Church on a more central site.
Many, at this time, were greatly interested in this develop-
ment and project. With the permission of the General
Assembly, a site was purchased at the corner of Wright and
Page Streets. Land was also secured in Armstrong Street,
Middle Park, qnd a hall from Northcote was bought and placed
Interior of Albert Park Church, with Organ in background
on it. Services were conducted by the Church Extension Com-
mittee in the newly-acquired Armstrong Street Sunday School
Hall by the year 1906.
Mr. F. Ashton kindly supplied the following paragraph in connec-
tion with Middle Park Church :
The late Mr. Malcolm McGillivray called on a few Presby-
terians in Middle Park, with reference to having a Sunday School
and an evening service. The first school and services were held


in Honeybone’s Hall, Neville Street, about 1906. Afterwards a
piece of land was secured in Armstrong Street, between Banks
and Page Streets, and a small wooden building was bought and
placed on the land. The school and Church were successful from
the start, and were well atended. Quite a number of people
who had left off going to Church, owing to the nearest Church
being some distance away, took a great interest in the work.
The preachers were mostly young students, amongst them being
Mr. Kelly, who is well known to old members of Albert Park.
The Church was getting on so well, that an effort was made
for the Presbytery to allow morning services to be held, but
this was deemed inadvisable, as the Armstrong Street Church
was in their boundary. The Church was then closed, and joined
to Albert Park.
In 1909, Mr. Burns was compelled to resign, through ill-
health, much to the regret of the congregation, and early that
same year the Rev. W. Goyen, of Sunbury, was called. The
year 1910 became a very eventful one. The idea of amalgama-
tion thrived, and the Church began to be increasingly active.
There were, at this time, some 200 families connected with the
Church, and Mr. Goyen had the privilege of seeing, during his
ministry, the amalgamation of the Churches of Middle Park and
Albert Park, and the building of a new Sunday School and
Church.
To do this, the necessary permission of the Assembly being
secured, the Wright and Page Streets site was sold for
£843/15/-, for what was thought a better site in Richardson
Street, opposite the State school. The latter land was 99 feet
by 165 feet, and was obtained for £B4O. The Church Hall in
Armstrong Street was sold to Sydenham folk for £BO, with its
seating accommodation, and the land on which it stood for £520.
The Albert Park land at the corner of Merton and O’Grady
Streets was sold also, and the purchase money, less expenses,
was paid over to trustees in reduction of the Church mortgage.
The Church and seating accommodation at Albert Park was
sold for £BOO, and these joint amounts provided a nucleus for
the greater work to be established at the Richardson Street
site—a work that was necessary, since the Middle Park friends
felt that the Albert Park Kirk, being at one end of the parish,
did not meet in any way with their requirements.
Those who undertook this work will always be remembered
for the interest and zeal displayed in the buying and selling of
the properties to the best advantage, for the Church’s sake. A
new School Hall was built, at a cost of £865, on the new site
in 1911, and, largely through the enthusiasm and organising
ability of the Minister, Mr. Goyen, the new Church was pro-


ceeded with almost immediately. Meanwhile, accommodation
had to be found for Middle Park friends, and Honeybone’s Hall,
Neville Street (now back of the Methodist Church Hall), was
secured for a Sunday School and for divine worship. This took
place late in 1910.
The Sunday School having been built, united worship was
held there. The organ was brought from Albert Park and re-
assembled in the hall, pending the building and completion of
the Church. The new Church at length was built, at a cost of
£3130, and in 1912 was opened and dedicated. It was called the
Albert and Middle Park Presbyterian Church, though some, at
the time, desired a more ecclesiastical title, such as St. Andrew’s;
others suggested St. Stephen’s, and a few St. Enoch’s.
Interior of Church
The Rev. W. Goyen was appointed by the General
Assembly Director of Sabbath Schools, in 1914, and the congre-
gation called to the vacant pastorate the Rev. W. A. Stevely,
M.A., from Stanmore, Sydney. After a ministry of some ten
years, half of which were the anxious years of the Great War,
the Church again fell vacant. In 1924, the Rev. G. Patterson
Campbell, of Auckland, New Zealand, accepted the call. In
August, 1926, Mr. Campbell left for Stawell, Victoria, and m
December, 1926, the present Minister, the Rev. A. G. Mackintosh
Carter, 8.A., 8.D., then of Chalmers Church, Hobart, Tasmania,
received and accepted a call to Albert and Middle Park, and was
inducted into the charge on February 15, 1927.

Items re Organ.—The Church organ, in 1894, was said to
be in a bad state. In 1905, the organ was repaired, at a cost
of £3O. In 1911, an estimate was obtained for supplying a new
case, new tubes and electric blower for £lBO. New organ con-
templated for new Church early in 1914, to cost £550. Efforts
were made to raise funds, but allowed to stand over, through
the war. In February, 1916, the Organ Fund stood at £9O/15/5.
In 1917 Mr. Tress wished to have choir seats altered. On April
4, 1923, it was suggested that the congregation should spend
£lOO on organ repairs. January-April, 1929, old organ being
remodelled at a cost of £232. While remodelling organ, builder’s
name was found inside bellows: D. Renton, 1871.
Manse Items.—As early as 1885, Rev. T. Tait, M.A., had a
motion before the Board re a Manse. On July 7, 1914, the
advisability of securing house next door to the Church, as a
Manse, same being in the market, was considered. The pur-
chase of same was not recommended, owing to difficulty in
arranging to get money to finance the purchase. It was decided
on August 4, 1914, to do nothing in the matter for the present.
Then the great war came, which caused the matter to be
shelved. Nothing definite has been done, and since 1914 £BOO
has been paid in Manse allowance by the congregation, as rent.
The Sunday School.—Owing to the large amount of
material, this subject could not be properly investigated for this
historical souvenir. A history of the Sunday School may be
compiled later.
Works Committee and Ladies’ Societies. —Through the many
years, the Works Committee rendered yeoman service, as also
did the Choir and the various ladies’ organisations, to assist
the Church funds. No praise is too exaggerated in connection
with the work attempted and carried out by the various
organisations since the year 1884.
Present Session, 1929.—Messrs. J. Dalton, W. R. Dimelow,
J. Mclnnes, J. McLean, F. Rennie, L. Worrall, J. Wright, T. G.
Yule, G. Sim (Clerk).
Present Board of Management, 1929.—Messrs. W. Agnew,
L. E. Coulson, T. Guiver, W. I. Hemphill, H. Mackenzie, J.
Munce, W. Nelson, F. Pope, E. Shaw.
Finally, the present Minister is indebted to Messrs. F. W.
Meaden, A. E. Clarke, F. Ashton and W. I. G. Moss, of Uvadale
Grove, Kew, for information, and to the fine state of the Church
records, which enabled him to get together this brief narrative
of Albert and Middle Park Church history.
