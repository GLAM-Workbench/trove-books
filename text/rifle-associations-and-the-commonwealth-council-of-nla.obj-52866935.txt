later on in South Australia. Queensland, Tasmania and
Wostem. Australia., on. .the lines of the National liifk
Assoeiation of Great Brita-rn and. Ireland,
T.b e:m Associations are, and-always hove been, managed
respectively by a Council elected annually bv tke men!
here. among whom, arc not only leading officers of tin
Defence Forces (Naval and .Military), but also the best
rifienmn of each of the Colonies (now States). wkeiUu
connected with the Defence Forces or not. Their funds,
are. derived from the subscriptions cf their members,
donat.sf.me from the general public, entrance money paid
by competitors in the Amend Matches, and an Annual
Grant be Parliament.


Although these Aasociatious form no part of the Naval
or Military o3g»n.*atum »f \,i& Defence Forces, they have
always had tm Mil *aj y *' mraandants of ib.e various

In each Colony (new State) the Council of the
Association manages its business and Jure sole, .control o.<
the matches' ami competitions held nnder its auspices.,
and fixes the conditions under which, they are to be fired.
The Council has also- been recognised by the Government
and the general pubh.c as the supremo authority in al.
matters relating tef ride shooting within the Colony (now
State), The management is most economical. as the mem-
bers of Council are not paid for their services ; "and it is
most efficient, m they are. for the most part, expert rifle-
men themselves.
While fully recognising the value of the Musketry In
st-ruMao-n given to members of the Defence Forces, mxdei
the Naval and -.Military organisation, the Hide Associa
ciations claim that they have done more, during the last-
-4- years,- to produce; excellent m arksma-nship and high-
ekes ri fie -shooting through out Australia-, than ail othej
organisations combined.
line of the most import-ant -factors, in the production
of high-class ride shooting, has - been the competition, be-
tween represeutetivo teams of- the various' Colonies (now
States). The first series of intercolonial, -rifle matches wa;
arranged between, the: Bade Associations of New South
Wales and Victoria before 1862. The 'matches were bred
annually from 1862 to 1867 inclusive, in Melbourne and
Sydney' alternately, and it was- found -that these mi-tehe?.
had''-a ; wohderful effect upon all riflemen in creating en-
thusiasm' and developing patriotism, which caused thorn
to devote more time add attention to regular practice.
From 1868 to 1886 intercolonial .matches were held at
long and irregular intervals, and it was observed that,
in the years when no Intercolonial Match wan fired, there


was a great falling off i.u the practice of rifle
ana in tde spirit which, animated riflemen.
shooting.
In =he Councils of the various Belie Associations
were nr. m d to send delegates to Adelaide to discuss the
whole < pm-Aon of Intercolonial Rifle Matches, and to
decide 8a to their future management, and a match was
arranged to embrace teams from all the .Australian Colo-
nies (now' States), to bo fired at the Adelaide Rifle
Ranges, about the time of the Conference, In the match
and at the Conference New Bonth Wales, Victoria, South
Australia and Tasmania were represented. This was the
second time that four Colonies bad sect teams to fire-in
an Intercolonial Match, and a groat feeling of friendly
rivalry was generated. At the Conference it was resolved
to establish a Federal Council to deal with all matters
connected with' Bide Shooting in which more than one
Colony was interested, and especially to arrange for An-
nual , Intercolonial Matches open to teams from all the
Australasian -Colonies, and also to determine the condi-
tions under which such matches should be hired. A sub-
committee was appointed to draft a Constitution' and
Rules for the guidance of a Federal Council., and to sub
mit the same to a meeting of delegates appointed by the
Councils of the various Bide Associations, with full power
to form snob a .Council aud determine the scope .of its
authority and functions; and it was arranged that the
meeting of delegates -should he- held- in Sydney in 1888,
during the week or the Annual Eifie Matches there. .Rep-
resentatives were appointed by the Councils el the re-
cognised Rifle Associations of New South Wales, .Victoria,
Queensland, South Australia and . Tasmania, two from
each. Colony. These representatives met at the 'Padding-
ton Bide Ranges, Sydney, on 20th February, 1888, all
the representatives being present. Some Abjection was
taken to the use ol the word ‘'Federal.”, and to- meet this
objection it was agreed .that.the ward Adeneraß should
be substituted therefor. .A, resolution was then unani-
mously passed, that a Council;should be established, con-
sisting of two members accredited bv the Council ol the

Council of Rifle Associations, by the good ..olhcee of its
constituents, the Councils of the Slate Bihe Associations;
succeeded in raising l over i£l 560. of which Captain Chirr-
side (Victoria) gave £SOO, R. Barr-Soritlp Esq. (Sooth
Australia) £2OO, David Syme, Esq., £I.OO, the proprietors
of the “Argus” £I.OO, and the proprietors of the “Herald”
£SO (the daily newspapers of Melbourne thus contributing
nearly oue-sixth of the total amount collected in Aus-
tralia, of which total nearly four-filths was collected in
Victoria alone).
By the exercise of great economy, an Australian Bide
Team was sent to- Bisley, with, the magnificent result be-
fore mentioned, thus demonstrating to members- of the
House of Representatives that it- was no mere pleasure
trip of favoured riflemen, but- a serious competition of
our moot brilliant- rifle -shots with those of the whole
British Empire, The result was a grand triumph for
Australia-, which more than justifies tbs Commonwealth
Council in renewing its application for an Annual Grant,
to enable it to .maintain the prestige of An strop a for
skill and accuracy in ride shooting. This is no private
matter, but -a great public question fur the- Government
and Parliament t-o deal, with;- and the Domini on. of
Canada- is a- standing and continuing example of -wha-t
should he done. Not only are Canadian Bid© Teams
sent to Sisley yearly at public expense, but public money
was provided, in 1.897, to erect a grand pavilion, of a
permanent nature, for t-heir accommodation at the Bisloy
Biiie Ranges, The Riflemen of Australia: give their
time and spend their money, not for amusement, bur- m
make themselves proficient in the use oh the ride, and
so to- become efficient defenders of the .country, and they


should not bo called upon to subscribe the money ueces-
friary to secure the representation of the Commouwcalih
m the competitions of the units of the Empire
for supremacy in marksmanship. Under any eireuor-
stances, Eiiie Associations should, have the aid of Par*
liamentary votes as .hitherto, and if it be necessary at
any time to curtail the public expenditure or the Defence
Forces, that would, he a good reason for mcreasmg ihs
votes for Bide Associations, which, cost the country noth-
iug for management, and yet do splendid service in the
enconrageraont of rifle shooting. The Commonwealth
Oonacii of the Bide Associations of Australia has there-
fore urged the Government to ask Parliament to vote
T2OOO aumially for Intcmat-ioual Matches, including
those fired under the auspices of the National Bide Asso-
ciation of Great Britain and Ireland.
A reply has been received that the Government Us of
opinion that the decision arrived at by the House of
Bepresenta-tives last year (when the necessary provision
for sending a team of liiiiemen. Home was struck, out)
must be considered at final; and the Government- re-
grets that it is unable to submit the matter for re-com
federation/ ?
Under these eiremnstances, it has been determined to
appeal to the public for subscriptions, in order that Aus-
tralia may not humiliated before the world, in return-
ing the Kolapofl Cup to Bisley, without sending a team
to compete for it.
