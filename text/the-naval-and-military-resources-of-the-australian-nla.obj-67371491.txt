THE
VICTORIAN
REVIEW.
Vol. X.?No. LVlll. ? August 1. 1884.
THE NAVAL AND MILITARY RESOURCES
OF THE AUSTRALIAN COLONIES.
The object I have in view in writing this paper, and offering
such suggestions as appear to me to be of a practicable nature, is to
bring before the notice of the legislators of the different colonies a
subject which at the present time is of vital importance, and de-
mands their prompt attention.
The question of the expenditure entailed by our naval and
military defences is one which has caused at different inter-
vals a great deal of anxiety, not only to those who consider the
sums set aside for this purpose a useless expense, but also to the
more cautious and far-seeing colonists who have recognised the
necessity of protecting the ever-increasing commerce and the ac-
cumulative wealth of the Australian continent.
We may take it for granted that this necessity of providing
ourselves with a certain amount of means of defence has been
sufficiently recognised by individual colonies in spite of the oppo-
sition of short-sighted politicians. The principal states comprising
the Australian continent have, within the last few years, made
rapid strides towards ensuring their safety by means of a com-
paratively effective, yet not expensive, system of defence. Their
land forces have been reorganised. Officers of high standing in.
the Imperial service have been selected to carry out the necessary
Yol. X.? No. 58 S


reforms. The whole constitution of the volunteer corps has been
altered, to enable them to reach a higher standard of efficiency, and
to offer men of all ranks greater inducements than heretofore to
grasp a subject in which, up to the time of these reforms, they had
made but little progress. It is not my intention to cast any slur
upon those who have served with honour to themselves in years
past. I merely point out the fact that these changes have become
?necessary, and as time speeds on no doubt the increasing value of
our commerce will necessitate even more radical alterations. It is
my purpose briefly to review the present condition of the three
systems of defence existing at the present time, viz., the volunteer,
permanent, and naval forces. By advancing arguments that, I
hope, will appeal to the common sense of my readers, I trust to
prove what great advantages are to be gained by carrying out a
comprehensive and feasible plan of military federation, enabling
us to regulate our expenditure, to make the most of our resources,
and, by judiciously amalgamating the several forces at our com-
mand and placing them on a sound footing, to obtain for our adopted
country that moral influence based upon physical resources so
absolutely necessary for our welfare and success. The Imperial
Government has, in the most emphatic manner, repeatedly assured
us that if our wishes are to be respected b} r other countries we
must be unanimous in our appeals, and be ready to take upon our-
selves part if not the whole of the responsibilities entailed by our
demands. I cannot bring forward a more forcible argument to
show the urgency of at once settling this vexed question.
South Australia, I believe, initiated the advance in the volun-
teer movement. It substituted a regular system of payment for
all ranks, and distributed the drills in such a manner as to render the
training of an almost continuous character, thusforming a force more
nearly akin to the constitution of the militia battalions in England
than to those which are now recognised as volunteers. The wisdom
of adopting a system suitable to the taste and requirements of our
citizen soldiers has been proved by the success that has attended
its execution. The opinions of military authorities, who have from
time to time visited our shores, have been unanimous in their praise
of the soldier-like conduct of the men under arms, and the pro-
ficiency they have attained in the different drills appertaining to
the several branches of the service. I may here state, without
fear of contradiction, that this result has been attained in spite of
the' apathy shown generally throughout the colonies by the in


fluential and wealthy classes to a movement which ought to meet
with their fullest sympathy and support.
The yearly expenditure of the public money set aside for the
Defence vote has been stigmatised by narrow-minded persons as
wanton waste. It is by no means difficult to prove the contrary.
Puttingaside the fact of the advantages gained by offering our youth
the chances of undergoing a course of training calculated to im-
prove them morally and physically, to teach them self-control, and
to inspire them with a high sense of duty and loyalty?not taking
into consideration the undeniable truth that, should the occasion
arise, their services would be of immense value to the colony?the
money expended on this head benefits financially every class of
citizens, even those of the most peaceful disposition.
A large majority of our volunteers belong to the artisan and
working classes. In South Australia I know this to be a fact.
'One is not likely to forget that the colonies owe much of their
success to the strenuous efforts of the working man. It is a fact
of which they are justly proud. The public should not forget that
our revenue is truly said to be derived chiefly from this very
source the working man. A small portion of this revenue is set
apart to be distributed to these very taxpayers, who, in their turn,
pledge themselves to devote a considerable portion of their time,
to become efficient defenders of their country, and, if necessary, to
risk their lives in the execution of their duties. Some people may
call this sentiment. It is sentiment that has often turned into
a stern fact. The money thus circulated does not find its
way out of the colony. A large portion of the community benefits
by the contracts for clothing, etc. ; employers of labour find an
impetus given to their trades; artisans and factory hands obtain
employment for themselves and their families. What is the result ?
A certain sum of ready money is put in circulation, it is spent
principally in dutiable articles, the import trade is encouraged,
and an increase of revenue must accrue to the State. We may,
then, fairly conclude that the cry of wanton waste is but a fallacy.
If such is the case, the manifold advantages derived from the
movement surely entitle it to meet with every support from the
whole community. Now that the most important of the colonies
have taken steps towards placing their forces on a thoroughly
practical footing does the opportunity present itself of treating the
of defence as one of national importance, demanding that


proper means should be taken to obtain the highest standard of
excellence and the greatest profit at a minimum amount of expendi-
ture. I am by no means the first to suggest the expediency of
mobilising our forces and of placing them under the sole control of a
competent officer, thus enabling the colonies, as a whole, to depend
on a reliable force, whose organisation shall be complete, over
which there will exist no divided command, and whose numerical
strength will be sufficient to repel with confidence any attack on our
shores.
The knowledge that there existed amongst us a force carefully
prepared during days of peace, a force thoroughly practised in
every detail, a force whose organisation would stand the test of a
searching inquiry at any time?this knowledge would be our
greatest safeguard against unnecessary expenditure. It would
minimise the evil results of a war scare?that unnecessary haste to
protect ourselves at any cost when danger threatens us, which is
simply the result of a want of confidence in our existing institu-
tions.
It is now some years since, at considerable expense, the highest
military and naval authorities then present in the colonies were
invited to meet in Sydney, report on the state of the forces, and
offer suggestions for their better guidance. A valuable amount of
information was collected. Numerous witnesess were examined.
But what has been the result ? Have these suggestions been
adopted ? Has anything been done towards carrying out the system
of organisation therein proposed ? This is, indeed, a point about
which the colonies might with safety demand the immediate atten-
tion and prompt assistance of the Imperial Government.
The formation of permanent forces in the colonies has been the
natural result of the advance made in the defence of our shores.
Large sums of money have been spent in guarding the approaches
to our centres of population and our principal harbours. Necessarily
expensive fortifications have been constructed. Works of redoubt-
able strength are even now in the hands of contractors. It is
clearly, then, the duty of whatever party is in power to do their
utmost to preserve these works from decay and destruction. This object
can only be gained by the exercise of careful supervision. As a matter
of fact, the nature of these works of defence compels us to enrol an
artillery force. This branch of the service, from its highly scientific
nature, requires most particular attention and a high standard of
training. Many difficulties arise that have to be overcome more


by tact than by the hard and fast rules of the service, and criticism
generally so freely offered should be tempered by the recognition of
existing difficulties. I allude more particularly to articles I have
read in the public press of the colony of New South Wales.
Owing to the want of a supreme head, who would be responsible
for the force as a whole ?owing to the existence of different
systems appertaining to interior economy, very considerable
difficulty would be experienced in bringing together and working
satisfactorily the permanent forces of Victoria, New South Wales,
and South Australia, should the necessity for so doing arise.
Let us, then, amalgamate our forces under one head; let us
receive our orders and carry out our duties in a uniform manner.
Our men all trained on the same principles would be ready at the
slightest notice to take the field together, emboldened by the feeling
that unity is strength. All plans for their centralisation would be
matured, and they would form a nucleus of trained soldiers fully
worthy of our confidence.
I have heard it stated that, as we have volunteers, there is no
need for a permanent staff.
( Are those who hold this opinion aware of the extent of the
dangers that accompany the handling and caretaking of large
quantities of explosives ? Do they realise that as much powder is
often used for a single cartridge as would destroy an ordinary
house ? Do they know that, should an explosion occur in one of
the magazines, thousands of pounds? worth of property and great
loss of life would be the result ? If they are not satisfied on these
points, let them ask permission to be shown over one of the forts.
They will soon be convinced of the necessity for constant super-
vision. Volunteers who. devote only a portion of their time to
learn their duties as artillerymen cannot possibly give their undi-
vided attention to the care of forts; nor can they be held respon-
sible for their safety. These defensive works are mostly surrounded
by private dwellings. Surely it is the bounden duty of the Govern-
ment to guard the interests of those amidst whom they have stored
such dangerous explosives. It must not be forgotten that the
permanent forces perform many other duties. They guard the
Treasuries and public institutions; they are to be relied upon to
quell riots, &c., &c.; but my object is not to set forth the advan-
tages we undoubtedly gain by their existence, so much as to try to
obtain still greater results by placing them on a sounder basis.
As regards our naval defences, now, indeed, is the time to save


further expenditure, and to utilise to the utmost the resources at
hand. At present, four of the colonies are in possession of war
vessels of different size and type. In addition, we have a squadron
sent to guard our shores by the Imperial Government. Taking
each colony separately, its naval forces are not calculated to strike
terror into the hearts of an enemy. As long as no unity of pur-
pose exists ; as long as no systematic plan of defence is adopted,
we shall, in case of danger, be surprised into a hurried and, conse-
quently, faulty method of resistance. If, on the other hand, while
we have time, we set to work and form an allied squadron, we
must of necessity become a maritime power by no means to be
despised. We shall be able, if not to influence the policy of other
countries as regards their own affairs, at least, freely and with con-
fidence, to resent any interference with our own. But this is not
all. We would relieve the mother country of a heavy responsibility.
We would strengthen her by our independence, and, especially at
this particular time, when all her resources are being strained by the
the manifold demands of her empire, earn her gratitude and support-
The financial success of such a scheme is beyond doubt. All
business men will agree that the system of co-operation has been
successful in all commercial enterprises. I cannot attempt to enter
here into the details of carrying out what I may call ?The Naval
and Military Federation of the Colonies.?
The question of a general and complete Federation will soon
be discussed in our Parliaments; but should we find that we are
not yet ready for that final step which will proclaim Australasia ?one
nation,? there is no reason why the foundation stones of such a
structure, if proved beneficial and sound, should not be promptly laid.
In conclusion, I suggest that the Governments of the different
colonies at once take steps to call together a ? Council of Defence,?
that the duties of this ? council ? be to devise a scheme for the
immediate Federation of the colonies, as far as the question of
defence is concerned; and, finally, that should the scheme thus
provided prove satisfactory, it should at once be carried out.

THE BRITISH ARMY .
In view of the lately awakened interest in matters military which
has been shown in this country, and of the contingencies which
may hereafter arise in consequence of conflicting interests with
certain European powers, it does not appear inopportune to present
in a condensed and intelligible form the substance of the latest
? Several annual returns of the British Array.? The Parliamentary
blue-book is a bulky document, not only inaccessible to the
general public, but containing so many purely technical details
that few except those whose duty or interest prompted them to the
task would find either time or patience for its perusal. It is pro-
posed to present in this paper a careful summary of the chief
statistical tables, the percentages, absolute and comparative, as well
of numbers and nationalities as of the standards of height, and
what may be styled the moral statistics of the army. Not only to
the members of our different military forces, but to the civilian,
such a summary should not be without interest.
The return in question offers us not only a complete account of
all the statistical incidents of the past year, but of the correspond-
ing data for the last twenty years (1862-1882), and is therefore of
the utmost value for a just appreciation of the present condition
of the English army. It is probable that no other country
possesses such a complete and trustworthy record. The last 20
years have been of the utmost significance for the English Army,
and its aspect during that time has been entirely changed. Of the
many changes effected may be mentioned the introduction of the
short-service system, formation of a reserve, the localisation of the
army, and the withdrawal of a number of foreign garrisons of little
strategical importance. Of the 116 tables contained in the report
the present paper will be confined to the most interesting and in-
structive. We shall begin with Part I.?? Strength and Distribu-
tion of the Army.?
On Ist January, 1882, the army numbered 189,133 men, in-
creased by the first December of same year to 195,167, which gives
for the whole year a mean average of 189,229. The lovmst strength


was 183,335, on August 1; but on Ist January, 1883, the force
numbered 185,518, being 971 over the complement. It was in the
Foot Guards the deficiencies were most remarkable?963, while in
the infantry of the line there was a surplus of 3368 men. A
glance at the numbers of former years is interesting and is best
presented in tabular form ;
In 1866, with a complement of 176,731, the deficiency was 5737
InlB70 > ?? .. ? 161,150, ? ? 4131
In 1880, ~ ~ ~ 164,115, the surplus was 3794
InlBB2 > � � ? 163,411, ? ? ? 2254
The excess of 1883 is, however, only apparent, as there were
10,840 of the reserve included in the numbers, and the complement
was only increase I by 6700 men for the financial year 1883-84.
If one reckons farther that much more material was used in 1882
than in former years, and that 2253 fewer recruits were enlisted
than in the previous year, and, moreover, that in the first six
months of 1883 the greater number of the 12-years-service men
enlisted in 1870 (24,594), and the short-service men enlisted in
1876 (29,370), left the army, it is not difficult to see how the
Government tried to hide the deficit. Such measures as they took
at the eleventh hour to repair the loss were too late, and could
only contribute to lessen it in some measure, and adjust it for the
following year. That vigorous measures have not yet been taken
is all the more surprising, as the deficiency, without any gifts of
divination, could have been easily foreseen.
Recruiting in 1883 was not successful. The English Govern-
ment is, unfortunately for the maintenance of the efficiency of its
military force, obliged to enter into competition with the employers
of labour, while unable to offer such tempting inducements.
With the recovery of trade from a season of stagnation, and the in-
creased demand for workmen, the Government, forced into com-
petition in the labour market, not only by the ordinary needs of
the recruiting service, but in consequence of the withdrawal of
10,840 men to the reserve, was obliged to take the refuse of the
population. Furthermore, the regulations issued under the former
Ministry, raising the standards of height and girth, and fixing the
minimum age at 19 years, greatly restricted the numbers of re-
cruits. The Government found itself compelled to relax the regu-
lations as to girth and development, and lower the standard of
height. Changes in the standard of height are the best barometer

to show the proportionate number of recruits offering themselves.
When continental and English Radical papers attribute the small
number of recruits to the unpopularity of the army among the
people, it is a serious error, if not a slander ; the number of recruits
offering themselves in 1883, as will be shown later, was just as great
as in former years.
The 189,229 men of all arms were distributed as follows :
The Army Post was constituted at the close of the Egyptian
campaign, and is now for the first time included in the official re-
turn. Taking the Pioneers (sappers and miners) as the standard
of reference, and comparing the proportions of the different arms
with them and with one another, we find to every pioneer 3 cavalry
soldiers, 5 artillery-men, and 21 infantry-men; while in the German
army the numbers are 6, 5, and 29. The surprising strength of the
artillery in England is explained by the fact that the Anglo-Indian
service, as well as the English array proper, is supplied from the
same depots. Owing to the insular position of England, the
cavalry is comparatively weak, and in the event of disturbances in
India, or indeed potentially elsewhere, the Government can fall
back on the well-drilled, well-mounted native cavalry of the
Peninsula.
As regards status, the army of 189,229 men is thus divided

In consequence of the acceleration of promotions, the number
of officers has been reduced in the last twenty years from 10,800 to
7336. Up till the year 1879 the English army was endowed with
an altogether unusual number of general officers. There have been


no essential changes either in the gross strength or that of the
different arms during the same period.
The total number of men garrisoned in the British Islands was-
-94,29 England and Wales, 61,325 : in Scotland, 3609 ; and in
Ireland, 29,361 men of all arms. Ireland, owing not to the advan-
tages its surface offers for manoeuvres, but to its state or chronic
ferment, has always a far greater proportionate number of troops
than Scotland and England. In the former country the soldiers
are Ito 183 inhabitants, in England only 1 in 305. It is signi-
ficant of the state of affairs in Ireland during the past two or
three years that in 1878 the garrisons numbered only 18,787; in
1882-83, 29,361.
There were 94,934 men on foreign service; of these, 13,629'
were in occupation of Egypt, and 62,705 in the East Indies.
According to battalions, regiments, &c., the entire force was
distributed as follows :

Such a table as this gives sufficient food for thought. In spite
of the fact that in 1870 several smaller garrisons were withdrawn,
almost all the fortifications are insufficiently manned. In Gibraltar,
Malta, and the Bermudas the number of troops is altogether in-
adequate to defend them, for even a short time, in case of a sudden
outbreak of war; and in peace the service in these places is noted
for the areat rnortalitv amoner the men. It may be remarked here
almost all the fortifications are insufficiently manned. In Gibraltar,
Malta, and the Bermudas the number of troops is altogether in-
adequate to defend them, for even a short time, in case of a sudden
outbreak of war; and in peace the service in these places is noted
for the great mortality among the men. It may be remarked here
that at the time of the Egyptian expedition these fortresses were
ill-manned and ill-provided, and it is a question whether, in the
event of a European war, England would have time to make good
what had been neglected in peace. The position of affairs is-
equally dangerous in India and the Cape; in Canada alone is the
prospect encouraging. There the regular troops are backed by a*


strong militia (300,000 active and 600,000 reserve). England is
compelled for every petty little war to send reinforcements to her
foreign possessions, and so long as she has to do with barbarous
enemies, such a system may work passably; but it will be very
different when she has to try conclusions with some European
state.
Part 11. of the report deals with the ? Gain and Loss ? of the
army. Of 23,802 recruits in the year 1882, only 1252 chose the
long service of twelve years. There was a further increase of
10,840 from the reserve and of 1297 deserters restored to the ser-
vice. The ? Loss ? was 33,052, which, including the reserve, makes
a nett increase of 3778. There were 2140 deaths, 15,612 were
discharged, 4143 deserted, 8370 entered the reserve, 675 joined the
artillery forces, and 2112 additional were dismissed on various
grounds.
In 1882, 45,385 men presented themselves for enlistment; of
these, 11,271 were at once rejected, 8841 did not report themselves
at the depots, and 164 were finally refused for different reasons, so
that only 20,109 were sworn in. Of these, 1286 were dismissed as
unsuitable and 279 deserted, so that at last 23,555 only were added
to the forces. Most recruits enlist in the beginning of winter, and
many try to desert in the spring ; for these the army is merely a
place of retreat for the cold season. The recruits from England
and Wales numbered 18,840 ('OB3 per cent, of the population),
from Scotland, 2250 (?O5 per cent, of population) ; from Ireland,
2465 (?0469 of population). Since 1870 the number of men volun-
teering for long service has sunk from 22,192 to 1252.
The introduction of the short-service system has had one good
effect: the number of men volunteering has been steadily rising;
in the last twenty years it has risen from 19,456 to 45,385 men.
The quality has also improved. Of the 30,356 who volunteered
in 1874, 20,312 (two-thirds) were accepted; while in 1882, in spite
of the greater strictness of the administration and the rigid appli-
cation of the tests, of 45,385 volunteers so many as 23,550 (nearly
half) were approved.
By the new regulation the minimum age for recruits is fixed at
nineteen years. Mechanics for the artillery are accepted at seven-
teen. Boys for the bands, buglers, and drummers are admitted at
fourteen and sixteen. But the,statements of age given by volun-
teers, owing to the unsettled habits of the lower classes in England,
cannot be verified, so that the tables of ages are of doubtful value.

Of 23,550 recruits in 1882, 1328 were under twenty, and of these
11,992 were in their nineteenth year. There were 6846 between,
twenty and twenty-three, 2563 between twenty-three and twenty-
five, and the remainder were over twenty-five years old.
Within the first three months the following ?losses? were re-
gistered ;
At the end of three months, therefore, of the total number enlisted
only 20,992 men remained with the standard.
The desertions from the whole army numbered 4145 (2*3 per
cent.), of whom 1297 were brought back, leaving a nett loss of
2614 men. In the first year?s service 2228 deserted, of which
number 939 deserted in the first three months, 574 in the next
quarter, and 715 in the last half-year. Of two-years-service men
the number who deserted were 673; of three-years-service, 828 ;
and of more than three-years-service, 828.
The following table shows that during the past ten years the
number of desertions has much decreased. The numbers were :
Part IY. deals with punishments, and this is not the least in-
structive portion of the return.
There were 14,138 courts-martial held, over 15,598 men, for
19,811 offences. Of these offences, 12,144 were committed in
Great Britain and 7667 in the colonies. The offences visited with

A comparison of the number shows that discipline, in spite of the
higher pay and other advantages of the men, especially in India, is
better in the colonies than in the mother country. The number of
delinquencies by sentries is surprisingly small as compared with
that of the French army, and the explanation is to be found in
the greater vigilance of the English officers. Punishments for
drunkenness, as might be expected, are more frequent on foreign
service than at home, the inclination for alcoholic drinks being
greater in certain climates than others. The table quoted above
shows only the number of cases tried by court-martial, the punish-
ments awarded being?degradation 2269 men,deprivation of ?liberty?'
and forced labour 10,913. For minor offences, such as drunken-
ness without aggravating circumstances, &c., 23,637 men were
punished for 44,124 offences. In the period between 1830 and 1869
drunkenness was judicially punished if a man had been drunk four
times in 12 months. In 1869 a new ordinance was issued, whereby
the offence was punished by a money fine not exceeding 10s., and
a scale was framed, which will presently be referred to.
Drunkenness for the first or second time may be punished at
the discretion of the commandant by arrest; but if the offence is
repeated within three months, a fine of 7s. 6d. is imposed, and if
the offence recurs after the lapse of six months the fine is 55., and
if after nine months 2s. 6d. If a man keeps sober a whole year
and then offends, that case of drunkenness is treated as a first
offence, and the reckoning begins anew. If a man gets drunk
oftener than five times in a year, then an additional fine of 2s. 6d.
is imposed in each case. These punishments are not applicable to
non-commissioned officers. Since the introduction of this scale of
fines the number of offences has decreased. In 1872 the number
of punishments for drunkenness was 26,111, since 1878 the num-
bers have continued under 24,000
Part YI. treats of the age, height, and girth of the non-com-
missioned officers and men, and the tables give the data for the

In 1866 there were 13 per cent, under 20 years, 63 per cent,
between 20 and 30, and 23 per cent, over 30 years.

Since the introduction of the short-service system, and the
issue of the new regulations for recruiting, the number of men
between 20 and 30 has steadily risen at the cost of the younger
and older elements.
We come now to the size of the men. According to a recent
statement of the Army and Navy Gazette the minimum height has
been reduced from sft. 4in. to sft. 3|in. In 1854 the minimum
height was sft. sin., but sank by 1861 to sft. 3|in, Towards the
end of the sixth decade the minimum was fixed at sft. sin.; but
when, owing to the complications in the Balkan Peninsula it was
necessary to raise the battalions to their full complement as quickly
as possible, it sank to sft. 4in., and rose in 1880 to sft. 4|in., and
again sank to sft. 3in.

The mean average height of the infantry of the line in 1882
was sft. Bin., of the cavalry sft B?2in. Chest measurements are
-classified thus: Over 36 inches, 43 per cent.; under, 57 per cent.

The nationality of 1678 men is not given, and these may like-
wise be presumed to be foreigners.
Of the total population of the British Islands (census of 1881),
England gave 74'3 per cent., Ireland 14?2 per cent., Scotland 11*5
per cent. If we bring the actual percentages of the different
nationalities in the army to the test of relative populations, we find
the following important results :
1881- 69?7% Englishmen 8"1% Scotchmen 20"8% Irishmen.
1882- ? 7?8% ' ? 20-8% ?
1883- ? 8-0% ? 20?0%
As we shall immediately see by comparison of past years, the
English element has been steadily growing, while the Scotch and
Irish, the last no doubt in great measure for political reasons, offer
themselves for service in constantly diminishing numbers. In the
beginning of the century the Scotch regiments were of pure un-
mixed nationality, frequently indeed being wholly composed of
members of the same clan. Thus the Duchess of Sutherland raised
among her tenantry the 93rd Regiment, and presented it to the
Government, and in 1775 Lord Seaforth raised a regiment of 1000
men from the clan Macrae ; in like manner were other Scotch reed-
-7 o
ments raised. Now it is quite otherwise. The picturesque dress
has attracted a crowd of Englishmen and Irishmen into these
jegiments, to whom the traditions of the Highlands are completely
strange, and for whom the kilt has no patriotic significance.

as the popular song has it. The strong-limbed, hardy Scotch
mountaineer, originally fisherman, shepherd, or labourer, who looked
with contempt on the degenerate ? Sassenach,? has almost wholly
disappeared from the ranks of the army. In place of seeking his
bread, or improving his circumstances, as formerly by enlistment,
he now emigrates to America, where as a capable, sober worker he
is welcomed and valued. Most Scotchmen who now enlist are from
the manufacturing districts in Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, and the

Part YIII. of the return deals with the number of horses, their
size and age. The number of horses provided for on the establish-
ment was 27,290; but on January 1, 1883, there were only 24,301*
so that 2989 -were wanting to the complement.
Here are the details :

These numbers sufficiently show how little the English army
answers to the demands of an effective instrument of war. In the
event of mobilisation the regiments in India would soonest pro-
cure the necessary mounts; but what of England, where already the
cavalry of the line on the peace establishment is 1199 horses

deficient ? Requisition is illegal, and even in war time the army
must depend on contractors. The present price is high enough?�4o to
�SO per horse; but, were it necessary to place the army on a war foot-
ing, this price would rise exorbitantly, and the serious danger would
be incurred of failure to provide the necessary mounts in time. The
like state of things exists in the artillery, the horse artillery in
Great Britain being short of 196, the field artillery of 516, horses ;
but, on the other hand, in India there are 198 horses to spare.
The cavalry and artillery in the East Indies are mounted with
horses of Arab blood, which are capable of long service, but are
much smaller than English horses.
Some time ago a few Hungarian horses were introduced into the
cavalry regiments by way of experiment, but were found too small,
and otherwise unsuitable.
Part IX. of our return is devoted to the auxiliary and reserve
forces, which together make up 363,415 strong. The distribution
is exhibited in the following table

ment of the active army, that of the second class for the re-

In concluding this short review of the voluminous blue-book
before me, it will be seen that some of my comments indicate advance
in various directions ; but it is nevertheless not to be overloo e
that the English army is very far from being what, with its compact
formation, it should be-in a position to assert and maintain le
greatness of the empire it serves.
