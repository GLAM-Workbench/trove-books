Odd save Victoria,-
Long live Victoria,
God save the Queen !
Send her Victorious,
Happy and glorious.
Long to reign over us*
God save the Queen 1
Thy choicest gifts in store*
On her be pleased to pour.
Long may she reign.
May she defend our laws.
And ever give us cause,
To sing with heart and voice
God save the Queen 1
0 Lord, our God, arise ,
Scatter her enemies,
And make them fall«
Confound their politics,
Frustrate their knavish tricks*
On her our hopes we fix,
God save the Queen 1
0 Lord our rights maintain,
While great Victoria's reign,
Steadfast prevails.
Bless thou the Royal pair,
And with Almighty care,
Guard England's brightest heir.
The Prince of Wales !
