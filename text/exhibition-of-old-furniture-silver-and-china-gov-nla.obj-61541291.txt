PREFACE.
'Cv
The art of the Cabinet-maker was, until the end of the 15th
Century, but little developed in England, and most of the furniture
then made was simple and primitive in desigp. Rooms
were bare, the large hall was the general sitting-room, in
which the meals of the household and all entertaining took place.
The floor was strewn with rushes, on which, in the houses of the
rich, were laid small Eastern carpets. The few pieces of furniture
were made of oak, and consisted of little more than a long table,
forms and benches. AC hen a chair was included it was probably
only devoted to the use of its owner, and was carved with his or
her initials, or with some emblem; it was of solid construction, made
to support the weight of a man in armour. A carved oak chest
was looked upon as the most useful form of furniture, since it
could be used as a bench, armoire, or dresser, and as a travelling
box when changing houses.
In 1 50 9, with the accession of Henry VIII., came the first
great advance in English cabinet-making; it was then that the
expanding intercourse with Europe gave our forefathers new ideas.
Craftsmen came over from Italy and France, and it is to theii
influence that the higher standard of workmanship and design
shown in Tudor and Elizabethan furniture may be traced. The
carving improved in quality, and included representations of the
human figure, fruit and floral work, besides heraldic and many other
designs. It was then that MARQUETRY was first used; the
panels in the more elaborate pieces were often covered by a complex
floral pattern of inlay, for which woods such as ebony or rosewood
were employed. The most distinctive feature of this furniture is
that the legs of the tables, the posts of the beds, and the pillars of
the court cupboards, are of heavy make, and have a bulbous excre-
sence in the centre. \l i
In 1605 a new order of taste began to make its appearance, and
the last traces of Medievalism gradually ceased to be a natural form
of expression. A wave of eccentricity set in, and the royal Solomon,
as James the First was called, set the fashion for trunk hosen,
jerkins and doublets, all preposterously stuffed and padded. This
naturally affected the furniture, and the carved forms that had

characteristic of late Elizabethan work.
hitherto existed in bedsteads, chairs, and benches, gave place gradu-
ally to elaborate upholstery. The needlework and embroidery and
the rich and delicate hues of the velvets were of surpassing
excellence.
In cabinet making the JACOBEAN craftsman showed a strong
predilection for APPLIQUE DECORATION, panels being built up
with applied mouldings, while the employment of round, oval or
diamond shaped bosses, furnished further examples of the same
method. Another innovation being, that in Jacobean marquetry,
bone, ivory, mother of pearl, and tortoise-shell were first used as
inlay. In Jacobean furniture the leg and pillar supports assumed
lighter proportions; chairs, stools, and settees now came to be re-
garded as essentials in the rooms of well-appointed houses.
During the interval of eleven years (1649-1660) between the
execution of Charles I. and the restoration of the monarchy when
Charles 11. came to the throne, the furniture reflected the austere
tastes of CROMWELL and his Puritan supporters. Although


simple, it is dignified, and its sound construction bears witness to
the conscientious spirit of the craftsmen of the day.
At the RESTORATION, numbers of banished Royalists, who
had been living in Europe, returned to England, bringing with them
a knowledge of Erench and Dutch designs which greatly influenced
the taste of the day. Some of the Charles XX. furniture is over-
elaborate, but when moderated by the traces of Puritan feeling
that still existed, great beauty of design was achieved. Fine
SPIRAL TURNERY became popular; it is perhaps seen at its best
in the gate-legged table.
Chairs during this period showed more development than did
other pieces of furniture. In Tudor times, when the floors were
of stone or of brick, a foot-rest was the indispensable adjunct of
every chair. Now, however, when carpets were in more general
use, this was no longer necessary,
and the botftom rails gradually
came to be placed higher up the
chair leg. These rails in turn de-
veloped into the highly carved
STRETCHERS that are found
connecting the legs in chairs made
during the time of Charles 11. The
chairs had high carved backs, the
arms were formed of scrolls, and
cane was first introduced into the
seats and backs.
The fine carving created a de-
mand for WALNUT AND
CHESTNUT, as these were easier
to work and to turn, than the oak
that had hitherto been employed.

a fact that is attributed to the introduction of tea and coffee into
England.
With the accession to the throne of William and Mary, in


1688, an important Dutch influence was introduced into England.
MARQUETRY was the chief form of decoration, and in the hands
of English craftsmen it attained a perfection which the Dutch mas-
ters never achieved. In the process of construction it differed from
the earlier work, the pattern as well as the background being laid
down as a veneer. From the beginning of the reign of QUEEN
ANNE, the realistic Dutch representations of birds and flowers
gradually gave place to designs of an intricate series of very fine
scrolls.
During this period the English craftsman had little to learn
in matters constructional, the chief advance made was the intro-
duction of the curvilinear into design. The simple undulating lines
of the CABRIOLE LEQ took the place of the intricate schemes of
almost barbaric magnificence which were employed during the
Restoration. The beauty of the cabriole leg lies in the grace and
strength of the curve, and it is seen at its best when but little
decorated. The word cabriole is derived from the Latin
(capra, a goat), and in the early
examples the base is often carved
to represent the hoof of a goat. In
about 1700 this form was super-
seded by the plain pad or club
foot, which we instinctively asso-
ciate with the cabriole. Some ten
years later the claw and ball foot
sprang into prominence, while in
1714, at the beginning of the
reign of George 1., a further inno-
vation took the shape of a lion’s
paw.
At the end of the 17th cen-
tury the foundation of the East
India Company greatly increased
the interchange of ideas between
East and West, and it is to East-
ern influence that one of the
Queen Anne Chair, showing cabriole leg.
later finishes to the cabriole log—the CLAW AND BALL FOOT
may be traced. This, in its original Eastern form, represented a
dragon’s claw holding a pearl.
The cabriole leg enjoyed popularity for a hundred years,


dating from 1680, and was accompanied by a similar treatment in
the design of the back of the chair, a curve being introduced into
the uprights, while the splat assumed the shape known as “ FIDDLE
BACKED.” The chairs now began to have shorter backs of
hooped form, and, since these were more convenient, they gradu-
ally superseded the tall and narrow cane backed chairs.
Although marquetry was very popular during this period,
there was also a great demand for plain furniture, and this may
partly be accounted for by the reduced finances of the nation,
which had been impoverished by wars. Craftsmen relied for em-
bellishment upon the figure and grain of walnut, to an extent
hitherto undreamt of, and matched sections of the wood with
scrupulous care. It is to grace of outline, together with the
simple beauty of the material, that the furniture of this period owes
its artistic charm.
> Many new pieces of furniture were introduced during the reign
of Anne—wing-ear or Grandfather chairs, bureau book-cases,
china-cabinets, and knee-hole writing-tables, to mention only a
few. Many small w r alnut side-tables were made, with either
marble or wooden tops, which took the place of the cumbersome
buffets and court-cupboards. There was also a new form of settee,
made to resemble two chair-backs joined together by a top rail
forming the hoops. The side-board, as we understand the term,
did not-develop until the middle of the 18th Century. Neither
knives nor spoons were changed, forks were rare, and the food w r as
placed upon the table in rotation, hence, until Georgian times,
there existed but little necessity for any side-service.
The appreciation of LACQUER FURNITURE developed in
England soon after the Restoration, and a greal deal was made in
the country during the reigns of William and Anne. The taste con-
tinued during the first half of the 18th Century, and although large
importations were made from Holland during the earlier period, it
is improbable that Dutch lacquer was much in favour after 1725,
as many books written on the subject by English authors show that
this craft was firmly established in England by that date. Chip-
pendale, that versatile craftsman, reflects in his designs the strong
interest in Chinese art that arose about 1750, and which strength-
ened the demand for lacquer furniture. Bedrooms were furnished
throughout with lacquer, wall-papers, mirrors, and chintzes in
Chinese taste, and a quantity of small tables for cards and tea
were made about this period, both in red and black lacquer.


The first twenty-five years of the 18th Century represent an
almost stationary period in the artistic history of England; origi-
nality of design being practically quiescent, with a tendency to-
wards the destruction of what had previously existed. There was
still technical excellence in carving, owing to the influence of
GRINLING GIBBONS, and that the contemporary appreciation
of his work was great is shown by a criticism written by Horace
Walpole—“There is no instance of a man before Gibbons who gave
to wood the loose and airy lightness of flowers, and chained to-
gether the various productions of the elements with a free disorder
natural to each species,”

Influence of Grinling Gibbons. The cabriole leg with the lion decoration and
claw and ball foot are typical of early 18th Century.
GILDED FURNITURE had existed during the Restoration
period, but a further development in its manufacture took place
from 1714 to 1730. Though its popularity lasted a comparatively
short time, and the defnand for it was limited to the wealthiest
people of the day, yet in spite of this, and the fact that it is sug-
gestive of foreign taste, it remains a distinct feature of the times.
The designs were bold and often exaggerated; the heavily gilt


wood was carved to represent eagles or human-headed animals,
while shells, lion-masks, or contorted faces formed the knees of
the cabriole legs.
By the year 17 20 mahogany was being used not merely as a
veneer, but for solid construction; furniture-makers discovered in
it properties of lightness not existing in oak, together with a
strength and durability deficient in walnut. It was the discovery
of mahogany that suggested possibilities which later on resulted
in many varieties of decoration. • In walnut furniture mouldings
had been kept plain, but in the new wood decorated framings were
introduced, and panels of cabinets and wardrobes were carved,
marquetry being no longer employed,
The constant changes in design occurring at this time render
chronological arrangement of this transitional period most difficult.
In chairs the previous hooped form to the back had given way to
corners of square shape, the cabriole leg’s were sturdy, and
were headed by LIONS’ MASKS or by human faces. Card tables
with the lion decoration were in fashion between 1720 and 1730
in both mahogany and walnut; the corners of the tables are dished
to hold candlesticks, and as receptacles for money. China cabinets
were rare; they were by no means in general use during this period.
In about 1740, a change appeared in mahogany furniture,
elegance of line and form began to supplant the picturesque and
more solid designs of the previous twenty years, and furniture as
a whole became smaller and lighter in character; for in every period
of style elaboration of detail increases, and its size decreases as
the evolution proceeds. The backs and legs of chairs were now
treated more in sympathy with each other; the backs were formed
of a series of flat curved strappings, and generally the design of this
strapping was continued in the vase-shaped splat. This scheme
was developed in the hands of Chippendale into beautiful and in-
genious variations of the same motive.
THOMAS CHIPPENDALE came to London in 1727 with his
father, who was a carver, gilder, and cabinet-maker. He pub-
lished his celebrated book, “The Gentleman’s and Cabinet-maker’s
Directory, ’ in 1754, and it is probable that it was not till after the
publication of the “Director" that Chippendale’s influence really
affected English furniture.
The designs in this book embrace three separate styles, known
as the French, the Chinese, and the Gothic. The Anglicised


IN- ,... »• -»
FRENCH STYLE differed from tire corresponding period of Louis
15th, chiefly in the absence of the finely-chased and gilt-metal fit-
tings at the sides and corners; the gilding of the wood and the
beautiful tapestry coverings; and its development here was prin-
cipally confined to mirrors, sofas, and chairs. The CHINESE
STYLE was perhaps the most consistent of the three, as one ap-
parent motive was preserved throughout; the principal character-
istics were an open lattice work, termed at the time the Chinese
railing, pagoda roofs, with bells as pendants, and in the mirrors
and sconces, the introduction of mandarins, Chinese birds, and
little buildings among the decorations. The so-called GOTHIC
was an attempt to introduce certain elements of that ancient taste,
combined with later Georgian delicacy and lightness of construc-
tion ; but the result was unconvincing and unsatisfactory. Occa-
sionally these styles were interwoven, affording curious oppor-
tunities to the carver for eccentricity of design.
A very large number of subscribers to Chippendale’s book
were cabinet-makers; they reproduced designs so accurately that
it is difficult to decide their origin. It is impossible that Chip-
pendale’s firm could have made a tithe of the furniture assigned
to them, though there is no doubt that he was employed by the
richest classes both for their town and country houses. The de-
mand for really fine specimens of furniture even in 1750 was still
very limited. The population of London then consisted of only
600,000 inhabitants, and but a very small percentage of these were
patrons of art.
Library writing-tables were regarded as important pieces of

furniture, and much care was be-
stowed upon them. Great numbers
of chairs were made; they became
lighter in type, the legs vary-
ing between those of delicate cab-
riole form and the simple,
straight Chinese pattern. The
design of chair known as
“ RIBBON - BACK,” Chippendale
states to be his best. In some
instances the ribbon takes the
shape of a wheel, the uprights and
top are comparatively simple, but
form a beautiful undulation.


It is this subtlety of line that always stamps the chair of a
good maker. Since in Chippendale’s hook no mention is made
of.the claw-and-hall foot, it seems safe to assume that he omitted
it as old-fashioned, and not in accordance with the more delicate
and fanciful style he desired 'to introduce. Light CIRCULAR
TABLES were made, surrounded by a rail of fret-work carving in
Chinese designs. These tables were employed for showing off
snuff-boxes and silver ornaments, which were much collected. The
rails were to prevent the ornaments from being swept off, a very
necjessary precaution when it is remembered how full were the
skirts of the men’s coats and the women’s dresses. The CIiINA-
CABINETS were generally carried out in Chinese taste, in keeping
with the china then collected, which was almost always of Oriental
origin. The large book-cases of the period perhaps show the
great designer at his best; they were often architectural in treat-
ment, and had as a crowning feature the broken pediment of classic
days. The decorated lattice work traceries containing the glass
panes in the doors have never been surpassed.
All carving on the flat surfaces of mahogany furniture of this
period is applied; it is only upon the mouldings, the legs of the
chairs and tables, and the backs of the chairs that the decoration
is cut out of the solid wood. The carving of this age can be
divided into three periods. Beginning with an almost barbaric
boldness, it developed into a redundancy of finely-carved ornament
and finished finally in an altogether severer taste. Gradually
the influence of the 17th century design and the technique of Grin-
ling Gibbons was exchanged for an adaptation of classical and
Italian styles, of which ROBERT ADAM and PERQOLESE were
the founders, Heppl?white, Sheraton, and Shearer being more or
less their disciples.
About 1770 there was a revival of the taste for marquetry,
SATINWOOD for the first time forming the usual background.
Classical heads, full-length figures, broken columns, and vases, were
at first inlaid as centres to the surrounding marquetry, which itself
took the form of simple laurel leaves, or a series of plain bandings
in differently coloured woods.
Important cabinet-makers concentrated their attention upon
the COMMODE which was an elaborate form of chest-of-drawers,
with a serpentine front, and enclosing drawers behind the folding
doors of an ordinary cupboard. The tops of commodes were edged

with brass mouldings, brass fittings also decorating the shoulders,
feet, and lower edge of the doors. The whole scheme of this inlay
and metal-work is extremely beautiful, and broad in effect, and it
is unlikely that any English inlaid furniture was ever better made.
The credit for originating inlaid satinwood furniture is
generally attributed to Sheraton, whereas it was brought to this
perfection twenty years before his arrival in London. It was
Chippendale who, in his old age, adapted his taste to the new
fashion for satinwood, and much of the originality in inlaid furni-
ture is due to his connection with Adam.
HEPPLEWHITE, who died in ITBG, obtained celebrity as a
designer. His work, though at times original, is hard and plain,
lacking the delicate refinement of Adam, Chippendale, and Shera-
ton. He was perhaps most successful as a designer of chairs,
which were now approaching their final development, lightness and
simplicity of line, with comparative absence of carving, being
their chief characteristics. In place of the cabriole leg, a plainly
fluted, straight, and tapered shape was adopted in the new style ;
the ball and claw of the scrolled foot being entirely abandoned in


favour of a tapered and plinth-shaped block. Although some satin*
wood chairs were made, mahogany, from its practical qualities, was
more generally used.
SHERATON arrived in London in 1790, but although experl
in experience as a cabinet-maker, he does not appear to have
carried on this technical side of his work in person, for shortly
after his arrival he devoted himself to writing books of design for
furniture, for the execution of which he probably employed other
cabinet-makers. Sheraton’s work was always delicate, the
motives slender, vertical lines and long sweeping curves being
characteristic of his taste.
Book cases and china-cupboards gave great opportunity for
display of inlay and painting on satinwood. The larger speci-
mens were rare, not only on account of the cost of the satinwood
veneer, but because such a mass of brilliant yellow would have
been overpowering in a room. Side-board tables at this period
were, as a rule, comparatively plain, and stood upon rounded,
taper legs. It was not till the beginning of the 19th Century that
they were replaced by a heavy type of massive mahogany. Dining
tables were, for the first time, made to extend by means of slides.
Wardrobes were enlarged into three or four compartments, con-
sisting of a press and chest-of-drawers, flanked on either side by
a hanging cupboard.
With the close of the 18th Century, originality and real beauty
in English furniture ceased. Technically, the work remained ex-
cellent, but as imagination and enthusiasm gradually disappeared,
beautiful invention in domestic objects decayed and died. Archi-
tecture after 1820 was, for the first time in England, utterly ugly
and uninteresting, and the furniture became as heavy and prosaic
as its surroundings. The appreciation of beauty which had
existed for eight centuries, ceased suddenly, and was followed by
forty years of indifference. Happily enthusiastic artists and cob
lectors survived during the dark age of early Victorian fashions,
and it is to them that the revival of artistic effort is due.

PERIOD SILVER IN
COMMUNITY PLATE.
|||HE Golden Age of English
|)| Design, made golden by
such names as Chippen-
dale, Hepplewhite, Sheraton, and
the Brothers Adam, brought with
with it a new spirit in household
appointments.
It seems particularly appropriate
at the present moment, when the
truly wonderful genius of those
great masters is being so widely
recognised, to offer to the public
Knives, Forks and Spoons which
are founded on decorative themes
originated by them, and in harmony
with their best work.
We offer for your inspection,
therefore, Period Silver, in Com-
munity Plate, confident that it
possesses to a marked degree the
beauty and refinement of form
and ornament so characteristic of
the Master Designers.

EGORATIVE & RESTFUL LIGHT
IN YOUR HOME.
HY shouldn’t the light in your home be
soft and restful, and make the evening
the best part of the day? Your
children and the rest of the family will work
better and sleep better afterwards, if they spend
their evenings surrounded by a soft, restful, and
ample—but not glaring—light.
IF The inverted Gas Burner sheds a soft, pleasant
light, that will harmonize with, and enchance the
decoration of your home. The light can be
modified by means of artistic shades, and is as
evenly distributed and as beautiful as daylight.
T With Gaslight, there is no glare to injure the
eyes,—eyes and nerves are just as much injured
by glare as by insufficient light. Moreover, Gas
lighting is hygienic—the moderate heat evolved
from the combustion, sets the air in motion, and
thus assists ventilation.
Gaslight is the true light for YOUR Home!
