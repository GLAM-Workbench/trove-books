LECTURE, ETC.
Ladies and Gentlemen, ?
It is with feelings of very lively satisfaction that 1 present
myself on this occasion, having been requested by the Committee
of the Bathurst Mechanics? School of Arts to deliver an address as
a kind of inauguration of that Institution. It would indeed have
been more gratifying to my personal feelings, being comparatively
a stranger among you, to have sat on this occasion at the feet o
some gentleman of longer experience in the district, whose practical
knowledge of the necessity of such an Institution would have
enabled him to address you with better effect. But as a request to
co-operate in the promotion of any measure of public utility has
with me always the force of a command, I have not, in the present
instance, felt myself at liberty to decline. Nay, on the contrary,
entertaining as I do, both as a public teacher of the Christian
religion, and as a private member of society, the deepest sense o
responsibility for the furtherance, to the utmost of my power, of
every scheme which has for its object the moral and social ameliora-
tion of mankind in general, and of this colonial community in
particular, I regard it not only as a duty from which I cannot
shrink, but as an honor and a privilege also, to undertake the task
which has this evening been assigned to me, and to endeavour, as
best may, to enlist your judgment and your sympathies in behalf of
our infant Institution. I cordially congratulate you, Ladies and
Gentlemen, on the establishment of a Mechanics? School of Arts in
this ultramontane metropolis; and though we have not as yet
advanced beyond the first steps of our enterprise, yet I trust I am
not too sanguine in anticipating, that by the instrumentality of
this Institution, however limited in its beginnings, this western
region, so largely filled with pastoral, agricultural, and mineral
treasures, may speedily become no less distinguished for the intel-
lectual and moral elevation of its inhabitants.


Our estimate of the importance of such Institutions as this, must
depend on our views of the importance of Popular Education. The
elevation of the operative classes of our population from their
present state of ignorance, sensuality, and vice, to a condition of
knowledge, virtue, and comparative refinement, is the end proposed.
The establishment of Mechanics? Institutes is one very important
means for the attainment of that end; before we can rightly judge,
therefore, whether such Institutes are deserving of support, we
must first consider whether the end proposed is generally desirable;
and, secondly, whether the proposed means are in any degree
calculated to accomplish the end. To these several topics, Ladies
and Gentlemen, I shall endeavour to direct your attention in order.
Let us first, then, enquire, whether it be really a desirable thing
that ? the People ? should he educated, and to what extent? I need
scarcely say, that by the term ?People? I intend the great bulk
of our population, who are at present either entirely uneducated, or
whose acquirements have not extended beyond the rudimentary arts
of reading, writing, and arithmetic,?arts which do not, strictly
speaking, entitle the possessor of them to be regarded as an educated
person : they are simply the tools by which education is carried on.
The question is not with respect to the higher classes?to those
who occupy the raised seats on the social platform. The actual
establishment of a University, and the prospect of several Affiliated
Colleges, with subordinate Grammar or Primary Schools, must be
regarded as a sufficient guarantee that the generation now rising
among our upper ranks, and destined to be the legislators and the
leaders of this community in the succeeding age, shall not be with-
out the means of obtaining a sound literary, scientific, and Christian
education, upon their own native soil. But our present concern is
rather with that portion of our colonial population, recruited, as we
must expect it to be, by a continuous stream of immigration, who
from their social position are not likely to participate directly in
the advantages of University or Collegiate Education. To the
labouring classes, in short, in the most extended sense, ?including
all those who, whether as clerks, shopmen, mechanics, pastoral,
agricultural, or ordinary labourers, depend for their livelihood solely
on their personal bodily labour ; whose time, during the greater part
of the day, is not at their own disposal ; and whose opportunities,
consequently, for the acquisition of knowledge are much restricted;
?to these classes, our attention is now directed. And the question


is, Are these classes to bo educated ? Is the moral and intellectual
advancement of these classes an object demanding our warmest
sympathy ?our earnest and united efforts ?
Methinks I hear some cold selfish capitalist, in whose eyes a
human labourer is of no more account than a horse or a bullock
who estimates an immortal being, made in the image of the Living
God, by his comparative development of bone and muscle ?methinks
I hear such a man exclaim, ? What business have labouring men
with education ? It only makes them discontented, and unfit for
their sphere of life ?? In the Slave States of America, this senti-
ment is not an exceptional or occasional one, but is the deliberate
voice of the Legislature. Where that system of injustice and
cowardly oppression prevails, nothing of course can be more dreaded
than the spread of knowledge among its victims ) and consequently
they are sedulously kept in a condition of the most abject ignor-
ance and degradation. The necessity of condemning the slave to
this life of brutal darkness has always appeared to me one of the
most conclusive arguments against the whole system; and I know
no problem in social philosophy more difficult, than to account for
the fact, that in the United States of America, a nation which has
enunciated with so much accuracy and force the general doctrine of
man?s natural rights, and which in its early history battled so man-
fully for the maintenance of those rights, ?that in such a country,
a system, which condemns upwards of three millions of men to the
hardship of unrequited toil, denies them all the rights of citizen-
ship, and regards them in fact as mere goods and chattels, for no
other reason than that the Creator has given them a black skin,
should be suffered to pollute the earth for one hour. Now, I would
maintain, that, if the principle of denying education to our
labouring classes be a sound one, then we are bound to carry it out
to its legitimate conclusion; and we shall not arrive at that
conclusion until we have surrounded ourselves with all the horrors
and abominations of American slavery. If we keep our labourers
in ignorance, and yet will keep them as labourers, we can only
accomplish this object by reducing them to the condition of serfs;
for if you once permit a man to get the notion that he is anything
better than a nigger, there is an end to his passive servitude. A
slave once educated, will not remain voluntarily a slave: the lash,
and the fetter, and the brand, may coerce the body, but the soul
will assert its Divine original, and achieve its birthright, or die in


the attempt. It is only to the free labourer that education can be
imparted with safety. It were to be desired therefore that those
who are opposed to the education of the people would seek a home,
not on British shores, or under British laws, but in the more con-
genial climate of Louisiana or Carolina.
In a free community, Ladies and Gentlemen, the education of the
people can scarcely be regarded as an open question, Educated, in
some way or other, the people will be, in spite of all that political
theorists can say or do. If we do not educate them in what is
good, they will be educated without our assistance in what is bad.
The necessities of man?s physical condition, the influence of the
passions, the precepts and examples of early associates, are powerful
and efficient educators, which begin their office while yet the infant
is on his mother?s breast. The mind of man, from its earliest
consciousness, begins to seek for food with an instinct as infallible
as that which impels his body; and food the mind will have. If it
be not supplied with pure and wholesome aliment, it will turn for
satisfaction of its appetite to the veriest garbage, and the most
loathsome impurity. Nor does society want those who, for the
most sordid considerations, are ready to pander to the gross tastes
and evil passions of the ignorant, and who, by infamous publications,
and still more infamous scenic exhibitions, both propagate and
a SS ra ' a l' c fhï¿½ diseases of the social system. Unless, therefore, we
can subject men from their infancy to a degree of restraint equiva-
lent to imprisonment, and keep their minds from all contact with
other minds, we cannot prevent them from being educated. The
question is, shall we leave them to be educated by their passions
and propensities, in the school of the penny theatre or Casino ?or
shall we step in, and endeavour to impart lessons of a purer and
more exalted character ? Surely, every consideration, whether of a
prudential, a philanthropic, or a religious character, tends to
establish it as an imperative duty to educate the people.
Let us look at the question from a prudential point of view. It
has been long acknowledged as an axiom in medical science, that
the prevention of a disease is easier than the cure of it; and man-
kind are fast beginning to recognize the application of the same
axiom to the disorders of the body politic. Crimes are truly and
properly diseases: they are moral ulcers, by which are discharged,
in a manner palpable to the eye, the natural and acquired impurities
of the social system. The obvious analogy between physical and


moral diseases failed, however, to suggest to the philosophers and
legislators of previous ages the propriety of an analogous treatment.
We have been, in fact, too much absorbed in the exigencies of the
present, to spare much time for the consideration of future or
distant claims; and have comforted ourselves with the idea that we
have done our duty in providing for the punishment of criminals,
and in some cases endeavouring to accomplish their reformation,
without having made any serious etfort to stop the current of crime
at its source. It was not until a comparison of the of
Crime with the Statistics of Population, was forced on the attention
of British statesmen, that any question was raised as to the sound-
ness of that policy which offered to the unhappy violator of his
country?s laws no other prospect, than that of the gaol in the first
instance, and the gallows in the last. The establishment of Penal
Colonies appeared at' the time an important step in the march of
humanity; but the glaring fact still remained, that in spite of a
criminal code unparalleled for severity, no sensible diminution in
the proportion of crime to population occurred. The reiteration of
these stubborn statistics appears at length to have extorted the
confession, that the prevention of crime is better than its punishment,
or, as the same thought has been forcibly expressed, that ? It is
better to erect a guide-post at the commencement of life than a
gibbet at the end.?
Recent enquiries, conducted by gentlemen of undoubted ability
and reputation, into the condition of the labouring and lower
classes, have disclosed facts of the most appalling character. It is
now perfectly understood that there exists, in the mother-country
at all events, a distinct order of society, composed exclusively of
criminals, every member of which, old and young, subsists by the
habitual commission of crimes punishable by the common law with
imprisonment, transportation, or death. This criminal caste is
extended over the whole of Great Britain, and is united by strange
and peculiar laws, peculiar customs, and a peculiar language. They
are taught from their infancy to regard themselves as fugitives and
vagabonds on the face of the earth, and all who are not of their
caste as their enemies, whom it is meritorious to cheat and plunder.
Their hand is thus against every man, and every man?s hand against
them ) they grow up habituated to call evil good, and good evil;
and the last penalty of the law is the last round in the ladder of
their ambition.


Besides the positively criminal caste, there exists also the nomadic
or wandering caste, which differs from the criminal caste in following
some occupation, tramping from place to place, cither doing, or
selling, or exhibiting something, for a livelihood. An invincible
repugnance to regular labour?an incurable recklessness as to
future wants ?an immoderate desire for physical excitement and
sensual gratifications?and a general insensibility to moral obliga-
tions, are the characteristics of this caste, almost as much as the
criminal. Now, though it is only in old and very populous countries
that these classes can be said to exist to any alarming extent, yet
we must not forget that in these colonies, both the criminal and the
nomadic castes have very numerous representatives, sufficient, as our
population increases, to produce all the evils which their presence
has caused in the several nations of Europe. At this very hour the
colonists of New South Wales are annually taxed to the extent of
nearly ï¿½1 per head for every man, woman, and child, for the sole
purpose of detecting and punishing crime. It becomes then a
matter for the most serious deliberation, whether this immense sum
might not be more profitably invested in the establishment of
schools, Mechanics? Institutes, and other appliances for the purposes
of public education. An ignorant population is not simply a dis-
grace to any country: it is dangerous, and entails a very heavy
expense; and therefore even the purely selfish arguments of self-
defence and economy, are sufficient to prove the necessity of zealous
and persevering efforts to raise the character, not only of the
labouring classes, properly so called, but also of those lower castes,
which, so long neglected, have become a grievous thorn in the side
of the commonwealth.
Such is the merely prudential view of the case; but if we give
car to the distastes of philanthropy and of Christianity, the
necessity of popular education must appear still more urgent and
imperative. Even as men, endowed with common sympathies, we
cannot but regard it as a sad calamity, that so many of our fellow-
men should live and die in utter ignorance of everything that can
make them truly happy even in this mortal life. We cannot but
regard it as a grievous and sore evil, that so large a proportion of
our colonial youth are growing rapidly to man?s estate with minds
very scantily informed, and with very limited opportunities of
obtaining solid information. It cannot but be a matter of deep
regret to every well-constituted mind, that the only recreations


open to our youth, and to the labouring classes generally, arc those
of the race-course, the theatre, the billiard table, or the tavein.
Surely it is lamentable to see so much intellectual energy dissipated
in occupations which, even if no higher censure be stamped upon
them, must be regarded as frivolous, beneath the dignity of our
nature, and ill-calculated to prepare our people for the judicious
exercise of the rights and duties of free men. But as a Christian
minister I cannot feel satisfied to let the matter rest on the low
grounds of expediency or mere sentiment. The evils of which I
have spoken are not limited in their effects to this life only?they
extend beyond the grave. Even if the question of educating a
man were of no more importance than the educating of a horse,
we could then appeal to both economical and philanthropic consider-
ations. Not only is the trained horse a safer and more valuable
animal than the untrained, but the spectacle of a noble charger,
full of fire and energy, and yet under entire control, is far more
interesting and delightful than that of the rough unbroken steed,
roaming in the pathless wilderness, and rendering no service to the
world he inhabits. But the question of popular education tran-
scends in importance all others, just so far as the value of the
human soul transcends the value of all other created things. its
value is not to be estimated by considerations which belong only to
time, but rather by the incalculable magnitude of that Eternal Ocean
into which the stream of time is fast bearing us. A sound system of
education will not indeed neglect the physical element of man?s con-
stitution; but doubtless, our chief care should be given to the
immaterial and immortal element ?to the right direction and culti-
vation of the understanding, the conscience, and the affections.
And it seems to me impossible that any man, who has himself
experienced the advantages of a religious education, and the happi-
ness of living under the influence of strong religious impressions,
should behold without emotion so large a proportion of his fellows
living in ignorance or disregard of their inevitable responsibilities,
and refuse to put forth his hand to rescue them. The knowledge
that we are dealing with souls that cannot cease to exist, lends a
dignity to our enterprise which no mere temporal views can impart;
and in the reflection that these humble efforts may by the Divine
blessing endure in their results through the countless ages of
eternity, we may find the strongest encouragement to persevere, and
the strongest assurance of ultimate success. It was well said by


Loid Brougham, whose exertions in the cause of popular education
have reared for him a monument more durable than brass, and will
be remembered when his forensic and senatorial labours are for-
gotten : ? The power of doing good -to one?s country ?the power
that enables us to break the chains of enslaven men,? (and who so
wretched as the slaves of ignorance and vice ?) u whatever color, of
whatever caste they may be ?the power that enables us to ennoble
our age and to amend our race?that is a power, which a man,
which an angel might stoop down from his height to take up.?
After all, will it still be urged that to educate the labouring classes
is to take them out of this sphere, and to make them more discon-
tented and unreasonable than they are? Let me first observe,
that, as the experiment has never yet been fairly and fully tried, it
is somewhat premature to pronounce upon the result. If such
an eifect should even be witnessed, I venture to affirm that it
would not be because the people had been educated?but because
they had been badly educated. If trashy works of fiction, and
revolutionary, inflamatory, or immoral publications are put into
their hands, and they are encouraged to attend the harangues
of socialist or communist Lectures, or other vendors of moral
poison, of course it needs no prophet to foretel the conse-
quences. That many of the labouring classes have been ruined
by these means is unhappily too true. But is also true that the
comparative success of these evil agencies is to be ascribed to the
absence of any adequate means of diffusing sound knowledge
among the masses, who, by a strange perverseness are always more
leady to listen to the loud boastful pretensions of the Empiric,
either in medicine or politics, than to the sound advice of the
regular physician or statesman. And if we occasionally meet with
a mechanic giving himself unseemly airs of importance because he
has picked up a little knowledge beyond that professed by the
generality of his fellows, that is not an argument against Popular
Education, but rather a very powerful one in its favour. It is only
the ignorance of his companions that enables such a man to assume
any superiority: for were all educated there could be no such
assumption. It is simply because a tolerably well informed mecha-
nic is such a rarity, that when we meet with one, he is frequently
too much noticed, and flattered with the belief that he is somebody
of consequence; whereas, if Popular Education were general, such a
character would not attract so much attention. And if lam asked


to what extent would you carry this scheme of Popular Education ?
What amount of knowledge would you consider sufficient for a
labouring man ? I would reply, that, provided the knowledge
which is supplied to them be of good quality, I see no reason for
prescribing any limit to the quantity The fear is, not that they will
bverfeed themselves, but that they will eat deleterious food. All
men are naturally more inclined to gratify their imaginations than
to nourish their intellects, and more willing to nourish their intel-
lects than to discipline their hearts and consciences. If then we
adopt a system of education which supplies too much stimulus to
the ideal part of our constitution, and thus keeps us from close
grappling with the realities and responsibilities of life, and from the
sober and patient investigation of scientific truth, our enterprise will
neither command nor deserve success. But let it be granted, and I
trust that in the case of thï¿½ Bathurst School of Arts I may take it
for granted, that the education to be imparted is such as will expand
the intellect, enlighten the conscience, and awaken high and generous
sentiments in the heart; the gratification of the fancy being used,
not as an end, but as means to a higher end; let it be granted that
this is to be the general character of the education provided for the
labouring classes, and I know of no limits which can be assigned to
it, save those which are imposed by the circumstances of the me-
chanics themselves. Let them acquire, by all means, as much useful
knowledge as they can, in the time, and with the resources, at their
command. Let us endeavour to make the acquisition of such know-
ledge as easy to them as possible; but let it be our special
care to put nothing within their reach which can either minister to
a depraved taste, suggest erroneous principles of thought and action,
or present distorted views of the relations of human society.
Our Second enquiry, Ladies and Gentlemen, is, How far the
establishment of Mechanics' Institutes, or Schools of Arts, is calcu-
lated to accomplish this great object of educating the people?
It is very evident, that a complete system of popular education,
which shall form the character of future generations, and leaven the
whole mass of society, must embrace institutions of a much more
elementary character than a School of Arts. ? The child is father
to the man; ? and if we desire to have intelligent and virtuous
men, we must begin by educating their fathers; or in other words,
education, to be thoroughly effectual, must be commenced in child-
hood?yea, in veriest infancy. No one who has not witnessed it,


will credit the marvels tliat have been achieved in Infant Schools.
No one who had not seen it could form a conception of the amount
of information which can be imparted to children between the ages
of two and five, and that without the slightest co-ercion or severity.
It is both a pleasing and instructive spectacle to see two hundred
infants of those tender years, kept in perfect control and good
humour for several hours in the day, their limbs and voices harmo-
niously and healthfully exercised, and their minds stored with
precious truths, long before any attempt is made to teach them to
read and write. Education in the Infant School is not what it
w r as to us in our childhood, a toil and a punishment: it is a positive
pleasure; and we only want the system to be generally extended to
produce, in a comparatively few years, a radical change in the habits
and tastes of the labouring classes, and even of those lower castes,
now regarded as the Ishmaelites of society.
There arc however two very serious difficulties in the way of the
Education of infants and children in all countries; and unless these
difficulties be surmounted, Education will not be general, and the
elevation of the masses will consequently be only partial; those
whom it is most desirable to influence being always the most difficult
to reach. The first difficulty is, the unwillingness of parents to
send their children to school. There are not indeed many, even of
the most ignorant parents, who openly refuse to give education to
their children : we are more commonly met with excuses of various
degrees of plausability, which, however, practically amount to refusals.
This difficulty is a fatal one to anything like general Popular
Education; and having for many years given my attention to the
question, I have seen no reason to abandon the opinion I have long
advocated, namely, that the Education of children ought to be made
compulsory. Such a proposition is usually met by the objection,
that it interferes with the liberty of the subject. I reply, so it does
also to compel a parent to feed and clothe his child, duties which
the law does not fail to enforce. Now I contend that a parent has
no more right to neglect the Education of his child than to with-
hold necessary food and raiment. The difference is, that if a child
die from neglect, the parent may be indicted for manslaughter; but
if the child be suffered to grow up in ignorance and vice, and become
a public pest, the parent, to whose gross neglect such a result is
fairly traceable, is suffered to escape with impunity, the crime of
soul-slaughter being unknown to human laws. The only excuse


which ought to be admitted is the absolute poverty of the parent;
and in that case, it becomes at once the business of the State to
provide for the Education of the child, just as in similar circum-
stances the State provides Bread. If it be urged that so sweeping
a measure would cause a revolution, I admit that it would : and I
plead guilty to the charge of being an innovator and a revolutionist
of that stamp, and to that extent. I believe, however, that the
results of the measure would prove it to be a Regeneration rather
than a Revolution. I believe its effects would be nothing less than
to redeem our population from its present abnormal and chaotic
state, and awaken it to new life and to loftier aspirations.
The other difflcnlty in the way of Popular Education is the
comparative absence of competent teachers. This is an evil under
which in the Colonies we shall probably have to suffer, until proper
training Schools are established, and sufficient emolument offered to
induce young men of talent to embrace the Educational profession
from choice, instead of as a temporary resource, or a last expedient
when other employments have failed. We must not expect first-
class teachers, men both physically and morally qualified for their
office, to labour for lower wages than are earned by a journeyman
mechanic : the teacher of youth, more emphatically than any other
labourer, is worthy of his hire; and we must learn to estimate that
hire rather by the importance of the responsibilities with which the
teacher is charged, than by a niggardly calculation of what is barely
necessary to keep body and soul together. It is simply because the
Education of our youth has been hitherto deemed of inferior impor-
tance, and our educators badly paid, that we have in many instances
been eampelled to employ men of very indifferent acquirements, and
totally incapable of efficiently communicating even the little they
know. Until our Legislature be brought to adopt more decided
views, both as to the necessity of making Education compulsory,
and as to the necessity of providing a supply of qualified teachers,
all our efforts will but mitigate, and not thoroughly eradicate the
evils which lie at the very root of our social condition.
These remarks on the education of children, will not, I trust, be
considered digressive; they will, perhaps, assist us in defining the
precise position which a Mechanics? School of Arts ought to occupy
in the great business of Popular Education. Were our Primary
Schools sufficiently numerous, and the Education imparted in them
sufficiently extensive, our Mechanics? Institutes would necessarily


assume a much higher character. They would take up the education
of the youth, among our labouring classes at the stage in which the
Primary Schools left them, and carry them forward to those high
branches of science and literature winch the youth of our upper
classes acquire at the University. They should be, in fact, Univer-
sities for working men. A very excellent Institution of this
character in Sheffield has actually received the designation of ? The
People?s College.? But it is obvious that this state of things, how-
ever desirable, cannot be extensively realized for many years to come,
at least in the Colonies. We must be content, according to the pro-
verb, to ? creep before we gang.? But even creeping is better than
standing still. The world is not standing still: time is not standing
still: the enemies of Christianity and of pure social Morality are
very far from standing still: they are on the contrary most actively
engaged in disseminating corrupt doctrine, and exciting to corrupt
practices: there is an active putrid fermentation going on beneath
the surface of society, which occasionly betrays its existence by
convulsive heavings and noisome exhalations, and which threatens, if
it be not checked, one day to disorganize the whole mass. To shut
our eyes to these facts argues both indolence and folly : it is unques-
tionably the duty of every philanthropist and of every Christian to
do whafin him lies to arrest the progress of these evil and under-
mining influences ; and if we cannot do all we would, by all means
to do all we can.
The present generation of labourers has unhappily grown up with
little or no education. Too many of them are unhappily dissipated
in their habits, improvident for sickness and old age, negligent of
religious duties, and careless as to the management of their families.
The Sabbath day and the evening of their day of toil, are consumed
in idleness, in low amusements, or in vile sensual indulgence : the
cultivation of their minds, and the preparation for Eternity, seldom
occupy their attention. There are, I am aware, many honorable
exceptions ; but I fear that of a large proportion this is not an
overdrawn description From such a state of things not the labouring
classes only, but all classes of the community, suffer. We have not
only to put up with enormous wages, inferior workmanship, and
dilatory performance of contracts; but when our labourers have by
intemperance and profligacy brought themselves to the Lunatic
Asylum, the Hospital, or the Poor-house, the virtuous and industri-
ous portion of the community are taxed for their support. It is vain


to protest against such taxation, and say that as these men bring
these e\ ils upon themselves, they deserve to suffer the consequences;
we cannot leave human beings to die on the streets, whatever may
be their undeservings: they must be provided for, and that they
well know : the unprincipled drunkard feels secure, and deliberately
calculates, that he will not be left to starve : he sells his last rags
for liquor in the full conviction that the benevolence of the public
will both clothe and feed him, ?and so it does: we grumble, but
eventually we are obliged to pay; and so the mischief grows and is
perpetrated.
Can nothing then be done to check the evil ? Can nothing be
done to supply our labouring classes with useful instruction and
rational entertainment, which may save them from the fatal paths
in which too many of them are daily perishing? We cannot make
them children again, and commence their education from the first
elements; but it is not impossible to supply them with education in
a form adapted to their maturer age and capacity. The labours of
the Society for the diffusion of Useful Knowledge, and other kindred
Institutions, have provided us with the means of accomplishing this
object; and we may surely anticipate that many will be induced to
avail themselves of the opportunity thus afforded them, and find the
pursuit of knowledge more attractive than the excesses of sensuality.
We may confidently hope that not a few may be won from a career
of recklessness and danger, and encouraged in a plan of self-improve-
ment, the benificial effects of which shall extend to generations yet
unborn. Without some efforts of this kind, what is the next
generation in this Colony likely to prove ? What sort of men are
likely to constitute the great bulk of our society twenty years hence?
If left to themselves, they will grow worse instead of better : pur
labourers will not commence a work of reformation among themselves;
and still less will our criminals and nomades : it must be begun for
them; they must be drawn out, and encouraged with the most
kindly sympathy, and the most persevering benevolence, to give their
minds to occupations more worthy of their immortal nature, and
more conducive to their own true happiness, both here and hereafter.
In order however to enable you to judge fully, whether Mechanics?
Institutes are likely to effect the aid proposed, it will be necessary
to state what methods of Instruction have been adopted in similar
Institutions in the Mother Country, and in the Colonies. It is
about twenty years since the attempt was made to establish a


Mechanics? School of Arts in Sydney ; and for many years the
Institution advanced at a very slow pace. A Philosophical Appa-
ratus was purchased; but very little use was made of it, unless when
an occasional Lecture or two was delivered on some subject connected
with Physical Science. Nothing in the shape of a regular course of
Lectures, embracing systematic Instruction in any one department
of Science was found practicable. Indeed, there was little demand
for such instruction, and consequently but little effort was made by
the Managers to obtain it. The Library contained a very excellent
selection of scientific works, and invited the Members to tread the
higher walks of Literature. But I regret to say that the reading
was mainly confined to a very mixed assortment of works of fiction,
which, in may humble judgment, if not wholly excluded, should
be very sparingly admitted into the Libraries of Mechanics? Insti-
tutes. In fact, it is within my own knowledge, that, in the year
1849, the Members Roll of the Sydney School of Arts did not
include more than twenty Mechanics properly so called ; the other
members were clerks, shopmen, and gentlemen who subscribed to
obtain light reading far their wives and daughters at a cheap rate.
Now I am for from saying that these classes should not be allowed
to subscribe, but I must take leave to remind you that if the School
of Arts which we are now attempting to establish in Bathurst shall
attain no higher character than that of a cheap Library and Reading
Room for the use of the middle classes, it certainly can have no
claim to be called a Mechanics?? Institute; nor do I think, if I may
be permitted to say so, that it is consistent with public equity to
apply for grants of public Land and public Money, on the pretext
of promoting Popular Education, when in reality the diffusion of
useful knowledge among the working classes, if not wholly neglected,
is made altogether a secondary consideration.
Within the last six years the Sydney Institute has considerably
progressed, and under a more vigorous and enlightened management,
now bids fair to take its stand with similar Institutes in the Mother
Country. In addition to the usual Lectures, which, I rejoice to see,
are now of a much brighter stamp than formerly; the Managers
have succeeded in establishing classes for the study of the Ancient
and Modern Languages; of the exact sciences so necessary to the
architect, the builder, and the surveyor, as well as to private indi-
viduals ; of Drawing and Design; and also of Music, which is justly
regarded not merely as an amusement, but as a real elevator of the


mind, and a corrector of the taste. They have also a Mutual
Instruction or Debating Class, the advantages of which are perhaps
more questionable, as it is to be feared that the excitement of oral
discussion is not alw r ays favorable either to the acquisition of solid
knowledge, or to the establishment of truth. The triumphs of truth
have been achieved not on the platform, but in the closet; not by
the skilful debator, but by the laborious student.
In the Mother Country Mechanics? Institutes have greatly multi-
plied, and exercise a powerful and beneficial influence on those
classes for whose advantage they were originally projected. Most
of them have a Primary School attached to them, in which boys are
educated until the time arrives for their being apprenticed to a
trade : then the evening classes are open to them, and Lectures both
Scientific and Literary are delivered to them, a labour in which men
of the highest reputation in the United Kingdom have felt it a duty
and a pleasure to assist. In some of the larger Institutes, such as
Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, &c., occasional Concerts are
found to have a very excellent effect, the music being very judiciously
selected, and the performances of a superior character, while at the
same time the price is such as to place this highly rational and
refining pleasure within the reach of the humblest tradesman, and
what is of equal importance, within reach of their wives and families,
who are thus withdrawn from the polluting atmosphere and more pol-
luting performances of low Theatres and Tavern Concert-rooms.
Everything in short which human wisdom and benevolence can
suggest for the intellectual and moral elevation of the labouring
classes in the Mother Country, may now be witnessed in active
operation, and every day spreading more extensively through the
whole Empire.
It will not, of course, be possible to carry all these schemes into
practical operation in the provincial towns of these Colonies for
some years; but nevertheless much may be done, and I earnestly
hope will be done. With respect to a Library and Reading Room,
the establishment of these is a matter of such simple, and, in these
days, cheap arrangement, that I need say nothing beyond again
expressing a hope that the acquirement of sound knowledge in an
agreeable manner will be sought, rather than mere amusements
Some recreation, the necessities of our own mental, no less than
of our physical constitution, imperatively demand. To combine the
pleasant with the profitable, is alike the dictate of good taste and


sound philosophy; and the question to be considered, is not the
propriety of such a combination, but the relative proportions of the
ingredients; but 1 fear that if the recipes from which some libraries
that I wot of, have been compounded, were to be taken as models,
our book-shelves would be filled on the principle of Falstaffs? ? half-
penny-worth of bread to an intolerable deal of sack.?
With respect to Lectures, there will be more difficulties than with
respect to the Library and Reading Room. Desultory unconnected
Lectures are of little service: indeed they often do harm in commu-
nicating a mere smattering of a subject, and inducing the audience
to imagine themselves sufficiently acquainted with it My strong
impression is, that whatever Lectures we have should rather seem
to awaken curiosity and a desire for close investigation, than attempt
to treat of extensive subjects ; for as complete courses on any subject
cannot be accomplished, for some time at least, it would probably be
better not to encourage superficial enquiries. A much sounder plan
for teaching these sciences and arts which bear most upon the
pursuits of mechanics, would, I think, be the formation of classes,
in which the studies from the very absence of excitement would be
likely to advance all the more steadily and successfully. Classes
for the study of Arithmetic, Mathematics, and Architectural Draw-
ing, might probably at once be organized without much difficulty;
and another for the study of History and Geography, might be added.
These subjects are of the greatest importance to all classes of the
community; and I feel persuaded that nothing would be so well
calculated to strengthen those feelings of patriotism for which our
labouring classes have always been distinguished, as the knowledge
of the superior degree of political and social privileges actually
enjoyed by them, in comparison with the same classes in other
countries and in other days. A proper study of History and Geo-
graphy would convince our mechanics that so far from having any
real grievances or disabilities, they are practically the most free people
in the world, enjoying all the order and stability of a constitutional
monarchy, with more real privilege, and more substantial freedom
of speech and action than has ever been realised even in a pure
democracy.
Rut while we are thus exerting ourselves to promote the social
amelioration of those classes which form, so to speak, the bones and
sinews of our national frame, let it never be forgotten,?and with
the expression of this sentiment I will conclude?that we shall fail


in our attempt if we simply cultivate the intellect, and inculcate
the general precepts of morality while we yet neglect the heart.
Cold, formal instructions, even when men can be persuaded to listen
to them, have little effect in forming, and still less in reforming the
character. It is only through the heart that the life can be perma-
nently influenced. It is out of the heart that all evil actions proceed.
Do you seek then to divert this evil current ? And what means do
you propose to employ for this purpose ? Will you wait idly on the
banks of the river, like the rustic in the fable, expecting that it will
exhaust itself??you will wait in vain. Will you continue the
attempt to cheat it by the opposition of physical barriers ?maintain-
ing at an enormous expenditure, the machinery of police, and gaols,
and penal settlements ? These may to a certain extent prevent the
overflowings of the tide, but will never turn it into another channel.
It is but in another form, the folly of the Persian tyrant, who cast
fetters into the sea, because it was disobedient to his will.
Surely, the wiser and safer plan is to go to the source of the stream.
The mightiest river may be diverted from its natural bed by a
single hand, if you go to its source. And so, if we desire perma-
nently to raise the character of the people, we must endeavour to
reach their hearts. And this is not to be done by merely opening
the doors of a Mechanics? Institute and placing the means of intel-
lectual improvement within their reach. We must endeavour to
convince them, by shewing the sympathy which we really feel for
their peculiar circumstances and difficulties. In order to bring
them up into our own moral and intellectual level, we must be
willing to descend to them ?not indeed to flatter their failings, or
compromise, even to the slightest extent, the strictness of moral
rectitude ?but to shew that we recognize them as bound to us by
the ties of a common brotherhood, formed by the same Almighty
hand, stamped with the same Divine impress, and destined to the
same immortality. __ There is but one Christianity for the master
and the servant, for the rich and the poor, and it is only in the
daily exercise and interchange of Christian love, that the real hap-
piness of these respective classes can be secured. Knowledge alone
cannot change the heart, nor amend the life. Knowledge is
Power : but is power either for good or for evil, as it is controlled,
or not, by religious principle. The habitual course of our lives is
not regulated by our knowledge so much as by the state of our
affections j and it is only by changing the current of these that


any radical amelioration can be effected. No system of education
can be ultimately beneficial which neglects the education of the
heart; and though this is neither the place nor the time for dis-
cussing the means by which alone the human affections can be
brought under discipline, yet I cannot suffer myself to conclude
without reminding you, that, after all the treasures of earthly
wisdom have been explored, there remains a wisdom which is more
to . be desired than goW, and without which, all the sublimate
triumphs of the intellect are but miserable dross. There is a
knowledge, the depths of which cannot be sounded by human
plummet, which is bounded only by the circle of Infinitude, and
whose duration can be measured only by the shadows of Eternity.
There is a knowledge, the excellency and the power of which are
not of man, but of God ; the possession of which would be cheaply
purchased by the sacrifice of crowns and kingdoms, and for the
want of which, the great globe itself and all that it inherits would
be a miserable compensation.
