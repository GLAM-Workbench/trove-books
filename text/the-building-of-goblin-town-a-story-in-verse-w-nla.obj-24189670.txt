PROLOGUE
The Building of Goblin Town
This is a song about Goblin Town,
Packed full of Homes
For Elves and Gnomes;
This is a song about how they stayed
And lived in the town that they planned and made.
Shops,
Docks,
And rickety clocks;
Stood in rows
Like men in the stocks.
This is a song of the fun they had:
Naming the lanes,
Making the trains,
Setting the poles for the tall weather-vanes
Bells,
Wells,
Dingles and dells—
This is the song that their victory tells.
This is a song about Goblin Town,
Packed full of elfins and gnomes in brown.
Stores,
Doors,
And acres of floors;
Funnels and rigging for big man-o’-wars.


This is a story of how they made
Their wonderful Town in the forest glade.
Cogs,
Logs
Were ferried through bogs,
With the help of their very kind neighbours, the
frogs.
This is the song about Goblin Town,
Of sand and mortar,
Cement and water,
Tacks,
Sacks,
Needles and wax,
And an army of Goblins, with hods on their backs,
Carting the bricks for the chimney-stacks.
Come!
Run!
Join in the fun!
For the Goblins are building their Town in the Sun.
One has a square,
Another a chair,
And a third one a ladder, which doesn’t seem fair.
Tiles,
Files,
Fountains and stiles,
All to be set within so many miles;
Crates,
Weights,
Potatoes and dates,
And ropes for dividing the place into States.
This is a song about Goblin Town.


Of Tufty and Ren,
The property-men;
Of Nickle and Jan,
Tobias and San,
Puff, Muff,
Snowball and Fluff,
Squeaker and Todd,
And old Cotton-pod,
Who met every night and secured the site.
So we give their full names which, I think, is quite
right.
So this ends our song about Goblin Town,
Packed full of Homes
For Elves and Gnomes.
The next one you read is about how it’s done,
And, I think, we’ve agreed that it’s going to be fun.


The Building of Goblin Town
PART I.
Long before the work was started,
Goblins waited eager-hearted;
Wanting so to settle down,
In their dreamt-of "Goblin Town.”
"Goblin Town” had many makers
In its fifty thousand acres.
Some drew plans for fire-stations,
Others, houses for relations.
And excitement ran so high
As they clustered round to vie
With each other, and with zest
Each one thought his home the best.
When the site was chosen trim,
Little sheds were built of tin
To be kept as stores for tools,
Buckets, spades and folding-rules.
As the town was made and polished,
They the little sheds demolished;
So when everything was clean,
Not a tool-shed could be seen.


Little fat surveyors came,
And set their plumb-bobs taking aim,
And, their faces wreathed in smiles,
Measured up the town for miles.
Little men with happy faces
Stood in their respective places,
Working at the job in hand,
Marking out the blocks of land.
All along the grassy swards
Were the Goblins’ planing boards;
Some had barrows full of sticks,
Making fires for baking bricks.
All the work was smartly done,
From early morn to set of sun;
Every Goblin did his part
With a patriotic heart.
Barrows full of bricks were brought,
Tiles to pave the Prince’s court;
Chimney-pots of brown and blue,
Slates, and glass, and trellis, too.
Fences ready for some gates,
Little stoves and tiny grates;
Brown and yellow wooden doors,
Polished wood for ball-room floors.
You cannot think how long it took,
To lay the town out foot by foot;
To print out guide-signs nice and neat
For people walking in the street.


Without a doubt the town was laid
To give the people every aid;
And after each deliberation,
All was met with acclamation.
When the town was taking shape,
Goblins did prepare to drape
With gay bunting all the walls,
Ready for "house warming” balls.
Little poles to set in streets,
Little boxes full of "eats”;
These to keep the workmen going—
When they’d stop, there was no knowing
Forty streets ran to the West —
Forty of the very best;
Forty highways, running down,
Crossed them in the market town.
One by one the streets began
To shape themselves, ’cording to plan;
The Architect-in-Chief was smart,
And named them nearly all by heart.
First was "Meadow Lane”; it led
To a finger-post, which said:
"Good people, please keep to the right
If any ’buses are in sight.”
Where the streets were bad in places,
Goblins fastened escalators,
Which propelled you up the grade
To a rest house in the shade.


Streets and streets of homes were made
For lawyers, doctors, men in trade;
Names were printed on brass-plates,
And attached to front street gates.
Rabbits burrowed round and neat
Tunnels ’neath the busy street,
So that accidents and "fusses”
Were not caused by crowds and ’buses.
Do you know that for a year,
Ere the streets were neat and clear,
Motor cars went dashing by,
Sending paint-pots all awry?
Little "traffic cops” were brought
To guide the public through the Court;
Little constables in blue,
Made the folk walk two by two.
An arch of brickwork, coloured brown,
Became the entrance to the town;
And up the side a staircase led
On to a look-out overhead.
A Counting House the Mayor required,
And soon they did as he desired;
A Store Room free from rats and mice,
They built it for him in a trice.
"A stable for my horse,” he cried.
The Goblins built it fairly wide,
And answered all the Mayor’s reproaches
That they’d built it for his coaches.


The Mayor smiled, for soon he knew
His workmen had all things in view,
For in his room —he did not ask it —
Was a small waste-paper basket.
Goblins dug the Mayor’s garden,
Where the ground was like to harden;
Digging up the fertile soil,
Caring not for time or toil.
Wharfs were built and boats came in,
Railways soon increased the din;
Glass for windows, stained and plain,
Came by ferry-ships and train.
They also built a Church of stone,
And set it standing on its own;
Some fifty steps were at its door,
And costly carpets on the floor.
Then the shops were made and ready
(Some round trees to keep them steady);
When the people knew the way,
Soon the town looked very gay.
Goblins bought nigh all they saw,
And left a very empty store;
For the owners of the marts
Were forced to have new stock in carts.
Furniture and carpets grand
Were constantly in great demand.
The shop men gazed with fears and shocks
To see their fast-decreasing stocks.


Water was kept well in a store
In a mammoth reservoir,
On a hill set in between
The palace and the bowling green.
Trees were growing all around
The water-well, on grassy ground;
So full of water, sweet and cool,
Which filled the drinking taps at school.
For the school this site they chose.
Built the class-rooms in neat rows,
Where the teachers handed down
Traditions of their "Goblin Town.”
Little Elves, with well-scrubbed faces,
Stood in their respective places,
Starting off with pen and ink
To learn to write, and then to think.
Little Brownies, with their slates,
Talking to their little mates;
Standing all in strictest line,
Waiting for school-starting time.
Every scholar loves the school,
Where they learn the "Golden Rule.”
All the pupils work so well,
Keeping on ’till stopping bell.
Under glass, in good, round numbers,
Grew the little green cucumbers;
Lettuce tried their hearts to harden
In the vegetable garden.


Celery sticks and rhubarb red,
Cauliflowers with snow-white head;
Beans and turnips, mint and thyme,
Stood erect in perfect line.
You cannot think how long they thought
Just where to have their ground for sport;
And if a turf or stony wicket,
Would appeal to Mr. Cricket.
Here a level patch serene
Made the teachers’ bowling green;
’Neath a maple, nice and short,
Lay the pupils’ tennis court.
Goblins, digging in the ground,
Kept their muscles hard and sound;
Keeping cabbages and seeds
Free from all disturbing weeds.
Leaving these, we wander down
To the street which leads to town.
Note the busy little men
At their building once again.
Houses seemed to be complete
All along the little street;
Shops were stocked with chocolate bars,
Nets to catch the shooting stars.
When the Town Hall was complete,
They called the people to the street
To see the clock, and hear it chime
The hours of twenty-one and nine.


So, within the market places,
Goblins sat with upturned faces,
Waiting for the bells to chime
The hour the hands said was the time.
Then, with many squeaks and groans,
The bells chimed out in semi-tones;
And in all the crowded places
Glee was written on their faces.
Such a splendid clock was sure
An acquisition to the poor.
Watches were not needed now —
Not by poor folk, anyhow.
They also built a lovely Bank,
In which the Goblins’ savings sank;
The safe in which they kept their monies
Had a bodyguard of bunnies.
Such a wild conglomeration
Happened at the railway station:
Porters jostled by in fright,
In case the engine caught alight.
For the water was the trouble,
As it started on the bubble.
Tourists tried the peace to keep,
While the driver had a sleep.
When the train was running free,
Everything went merrily;
But now it caused them great alarm,
Lest it came to any harm.


Then there came a knowing porter,
Who pumped in some soda-water.
After some internal toil
It settled, and went off the boil.
The bridge that spanned the river bed
Was made of beaten gold and lead;
They took two years to stretch it wide
Enough to reach the other side.
Lawyers had their office buildings
Where the sun could catch the gildings
Of the bridge’s golden span,
Which across the river ran.
Chimneys stretched their necks up high,
Blowing smoke into the sky;
Coping made of stone was spied
All along the pavements wide.
Into town one evening, muddled,
Came on old man, very fuddled:
"Don’t you know, in leisure hours,
You should cultivate the flowers?”
With a lantern clutched so tight,
He hurried through the town that night
Calling out: "I’ve goods to buy!
Hurry, people; come and try!”
He wandered through the park just made
Past the sundial in the glade,
With his lantern held on high,
Calling out: "I’ve goods to buy!”


Many bought his little seeds
Which, alas! turned into weeds!
They did not think this very funny
When they came to count their money.
Soon, however, little Gnomes
Offered boxes of choice loams,
In which little plants were fed,
Ready for each garden bed.
Soon the town was full of flowers,
And the bees stayed there for hours,
For they knew most Goblins’ money
Came to them by selling honey.
Countless pansies tossed their heads
From dainty, dew-bespangled beds;
Rows of orange trees were seen,
With their glossy leaves of green.
Flowers bloomed from window-ledges,
Flowers peeped out of the hedges;
Flowers falling from the trees,
Loosened by the gentle breeze.
Bordered by tall hills serene,
Nestling in a valley green
Spreads the park before our gaze,
Tranquil in the twilight haze.
Pools, like shallow silver dishes,
Held the quaintest little fishes;
Ducklings (in most lands a sinner)
Never touched them for their dinner.


T.»
For a Goblin came and fed
Mushrooms pink and chillies red
To a ere they slept,
High the moon her vigil kept.
On the borders, as you pass,
Could be seen: "Keep off the grass”;
At the turnstile, please perceive
A sign which reads: "Pay as you leave.”
[End of Part L]


The Building of Goblin Town
PART 11.
Once more it is day, and we
Busy Goblin Town must see;
The industry these people show,
As mortals, we will never know.
They worked almost incessantly
Upon the University,
Making rooms and lobbies for
The students who would study law.
Taller grew the roof each hour,
Till on top they set a tower;
Then a flagpole on that, too,
Seemed to pierce the heavens blue.
The Castle for the King and Queen
Was quite the nicest thing yet seen;
Made from marble, white and blue,
With turrets and a draw-bridge, too.
Two floors of scented cedar, red —
One here, the other over head;
And oh! the trees they had to lop
To make the bottom hold the top.


Forty rooms were packed inside,
A library and ballroom wide;
A hall for pictures light and high,
With windows t’wards the Eastern sky.
The Queen her bedroom had in blue,
With windows all around for view.
" ’Twas built so I can see,” she said,
"The river from my satin bed.”
The Prince’s stateroom, by request,
Was called by everyone the best;
For he was pleased with everything,
And some day soon he would be King.
The King was growing old, and he
Spent long hours in the library,
Where over twenty thousand classics
Guarded were by Gnomes on hassocks.
Goblins waited on their King,
And brought him poems and songs to sing.
They whisked the tomes with Linnets’ wings,
And righted all disordered things.
Down from the roof, in glass so clear,
Was hung a stately chandelier;
And candelabra, gold and tall,
Placed along the library wall.
A polished floor of yellow tiles
Extended round, it seemed for miles;
And in and out the lines of shelves
The Gnomes could almost lose themselves.


The music room struck one with awe.
It had a polished parquet floor,
And, raised upon a special stand,
There stood a handsome little "grand.”
The Chapel, too, was set apart,
And hung with royal banners smart;
The dining room in panelled wood
Looked mellow, old, and very good.
Such a great big kitchen, too,
Where the cooks could dish and stew;
Where the servants piled the plates
Full of honey-comb and dates;
Where they stacked the hazel-nuts,
Where they kept the water-butts;
here they turned the holly-berry
Into wine for making merry.
In the royal cellars, too,
bottles stacked on shelves in view
Wines and lemonades and sauces
For the menu’s different courses.
In the stables, on the right,
Grooms kept forty horses white;
Forty snow-white steeds in hand,
Waiting for the King’s command.
In the ponds were golden fishes,
Satisfying royal wishes:
Little fish alert and small,
Bigger fellows brown and tall.


All the manufacturing trade
Was carried on in yonder glade,
So that dirty smoke and cinders
Would not smudge the palace "winders.
Also, it was thought the noise
Of cogs and wheels would cause the boys,
Whose job it was the lawns to keep,
To steal away and have a peep.
There also are some types who pry,
And so they built the windows high
To stop those people looking in,
To ascertain what caused the din.
In Goblin Town the Arts command
Respect throughout the elfin land;
Great artists came from far and wide,
The culture of the town to guide.
The Opera House was all the rage,
And had a new revolving stage;
But when completed each one said:
"All seats were sold out months ahead.”
So when the opening night arrived,
A "House Full” sign was hung outside;
The baby Gnomes were heard to sigh—
"There’s not a ticket left to buy!”
The Mayor appeared in robes of red,
And patted every little head.
"Don’t give up hope,” he gaily cried,
"The door is open—come inside!”


Once within, the Gnomes were led
To a gallery overhead,
Where a row of seats were found
To save them sitting on the ground.
The little Gnomes were so impressed
With coloured lights, and all the rest,
That when the bell announced the start
Each hand distinctly felt each heart.
Below the level of the screen
The Elfin Orchestra was seen
Busy tuning E and A,
All in readiness to play.
The orchestra was forty strong,
And played "sonatas” loud and long;
It also knew a symphony,
And dance for flute and tympani.
When all the instruments were right—
The violinists’ bows real tight—
On to a platform, stick in hand,
The great Conductor joined the band.
Then, lifting up his stick, he rose
Above his desk on to his toes,
And bringing down his baton smart
They started promptly off the mark.
The overture, "The Dragon Snores,”
Was met with very great applause;
The work was played with artistry,
As all the critics did agree.


So while the opera entertains,
We’ll go and see what else remains—
The Hospital and School of Arts,
The space for parking "cars and carts.”
The use of wireless, too, indeed,
Linked up the town with wondrous speed;
The Goblins just a lever pressed
If North desired to call the West.
When South a call required to East,
A gadget from the switch released
A wave, which bounded swiftly, like
A flash of lightning in the night.
So, when you have the time to spare,
Don’t hesitate to visit there;
Be sure you choose some Festive Day,
For then the town’s in best array.
So, for now my tale is done,
And I hope that everyone
Will be kind to Goblins small
Should they meet them out at all.
For you never know just when
You may meet one in the glen,
Hustling by in dress of brown,
Marching straight for "Goblin Town.”


Epilogue
So ends our song about Goblin Town,
Of Gnomes in blue and Elfins in brown.
Good-bye to Fluff,
To Snowball and Muff,
Jan,
Dan,
Nickle and San,
And the very old Gnome with the “fresh water” can.
This ends our song about Goblin Town—
The place they have raised to such special renown.
Lanes,
Trains,
Steeples and vanes;
Paddocks and fields
Full of sweet sugar canes.
So ends our song about Goblin Town,
Of Elfins in scarlet and Gnomes in brown.
Schools,
Stools,
Ladders and rules;
Hens on their perches, and fish in their pools.
So we must leave them in Goblin Town—
Leave all the homes
For Elves and Gnomes,
And the park where the “ranger” so silently roams.


Bells,
Wells,
Beaches and shells;
Drawbridges, castles, and moss-covered dells.
So ends our song about Goblin Town,
Of Gnomes in blue and Elfins in brown.
So ends our song about how they made
Their wonderful Town in the forest glade.
