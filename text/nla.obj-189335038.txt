THE EARLY HISTORY OF
WILLIAMSTOWN.


FIRST PRIZE ESSAY
ON THE
“EARLY HISTORY OF WILLIAMSTOWN”
BY
ANDREW A. CURTAIN.
Motto —“ Dingo .”
[Revised and directed by Mr William Hall, Junr., who arrived in the colony in June, 1840.]
TheTwn of Williamstown, one of
;he suburbs of Melbourne, is in the
parish of Cut-paw-paw, county of
Bourke, and North Yarra province of
he Legislative Council, and occupies a
situation on the south-west
mite of Hobson’s Bay. Its population
s slightly over 13,000, which is less
han that of the towns of North Mel-
>ourne, Briuiswick, Hawthorn, and the
'orough Kilda, but greater than
he town of Tootscray, and the borough
f Port Melbourne. The town, which
Uceived that title in 1886, is subdivided
||to four wards, each returning three
Members to the Council, its area is '
,540 acres, and 2,646 of its population

jenny rate), ,£13,819. Its total re-
ceipts for the year ending September
loth, 1888, was ,£13,936 14s, and
jptal expenditure for the same period,
£13,741 4s gd ; showing a credit
lalance of ,£195 9s 3d. Williams-
)wn is connected with the city by a
lilway round the shores of Hobson’s
lay, 9*4 miles in length, and may also
•e reached by train from Flinders street
‘.ation to Port Melbourne, and thence
er steamer Gem —-a distance altpgethcr
( r only five miles —the return fare by
ther route being one shilling.
1 Williamstown is neither extremely
ich nor extremely poor; its population
s mainly engaged in maritime work,
t being seaport town in Vic-
Dria, and the harbor of the P. and O.
and Orient mail steamers, and of the
fleets of the Victorian and Imperial
navies. Its graving dock —which was
opened in 1874, the memorial stone
being laid by Prince Alfred in 1868—
is one of the sights of Victoria; the
length is 450 feet on 'the floor by 80
feet in width at the entrance, vessels of
500 feet" finding ample room. The
town also finds employment for a, large
number of artists, it being the seat of
the National Railway Workshops,.built
at* Newport by Government anfl in-
tended to employ over thousand
\mjjkmen. Being a seaport and on the
Hhe*of railway in the colony, it is

which all the business of the mimin'
pality is transacted, is quite unworth

at the Railway Pier, at Williamstowi
proper, and at North Williamstown
, A, new station is in course of erection
between the two last named stations
and will, when completed, be the most
centrral in the town. The Mechanics
Institute—which has a library contain-
ing over three thousands volumes—is
the chief recreation hall; there is a
Sailors’ Rest; a Botanical Gardens,
admirably situated, and capable of
being made very attractive; a race-
course between the bay and Kororoit
Creek; a cricket ground at Point
Gellibrand, and a large bathing estab-
lishment on the South Beach, erected
by the Williamstown Bathing Company.
A reserve of three hundred acres, set
apart for the ranges of the Victorian
Rifle Association, might also be men-
tioned as a place of rtj(yeation, though it
is of little use in this inspect to the dis-
trict, and is indeed a drawback inas-
much as it closes a Government road
along |the beacih, and prevents settle-
ment in what is without exception the >

* *Between latitudes 57 and 58 in the
south of New South Wales there was an
interesting little stretch of country in
January 1837. It had been called after
the reigning British Monarch by Sir
Richard Bourke, who determined that
he should do something personally to
keep alive the memory of William the
hour.h in this place in a manner that
would not be unworthy of his sovereign’s
name. Ever sipce Lieutenant Grant
had in 1800 taken his little brig through
the straits discovered by Bass in 1798,
and Lieutenant Murray had in 1802,
under order from Governor King, entered
Hobson’s Bay and called the land sur-
rounding it after the first**

had been honored by frequent visits
from voyagers. The year 1835 brought
Batman in the cutter Rebecca and John
Pasco Faulkner in the Enterprise
schooner, from Hobart Town, with
horses, ploughs, grain, fruit trees,
seeds, provisions and men to form
a settlement, and lay the foundation of
future greatness. Still, at the time our
story opens, in 1837, the settlements
made by Batman and Fawkner had not
sensibly affected Williamstown. Their
flocks were driven nearer to Melbourne
where water was abundant and where
the pasture was almost as good. Yet
the place was not uninhabited. • Hun-
dreds of human beings ate, drank and
slept in it. Many had lived and died
1 here. The aboriginals found Williams-
town acongenial home and lived toagood
age in it, enjoying physical strength
j excelled by no other tribe in Victoria,
except those near the River Murray.
Theysufferednothingfrom their exposed
habits of life in its genial benignant
(climate, and were always well off as far
as food was concernfed. The mouth
the Yarra, originally called Hobsorfy*-
River, to the junction-of the Saltwater
River, teemed with flathead ana bream ;
jStony Creek abounded with eels. The
large mud flat near the river was often
(covered with pelicans, swans, ducks,
geese, and sea gulls; whilst cockatoos
and magpies made tlj.e trees on the
[Williamstown side of the entrance to
the river musical all the day long. If
a blackfellow wished to dine on an eel,
he had only to wade into the river,
pluck some dry reeds from the bank,
tie them to a stick and set them on fire,
attracting the fish to the light to be
speared ; blood cockles he could easily
catch ; or did hcjdesire wild fowl, the
matter was easier still—there was always
full and plenty within reach of his
deadly aim.
Williamstown was not uninhabited.
Much less was it devoid of the beautiful.
From any eminence the eye beheld a
stretch of magnificent scenery. A thick
growth of she-oak trees, eight feet high
in trunk, extended all over its bound-
aries, interspersed with native cherry
and blackvvood trees; while partly alon
the beach a variety of mangrov
and salt bush grew, charming the sigl
with their beauty. King Benbow, a
the head of his tribe of aboriginals, wa
the unquestioned monarch of th
Elysian home jutting out into the sea
with nature’s beauty and nature’s wealt
around him, and nothing to do but t
eat, drink and be merry. He did no
know that houses made with hand
were soon to replace much of nature
architecture, and that Benbow’s powe
and glory were to vanish gradually wit
the advent of the white man. Yet sue
a change came about, not rapidly bu
steadily, during the period to be con
sidered—from 1837 to 1873.
In 1837 the date of Port Phillip o
Australia Felix as a settlement begins
Melbourne was founded in that yea
upon the first disposal of land there
and at Williamstown, and named after
the then Prime Minister of England
Lord Melbourne. The seat of govern
ment was Sydney, the Governor being
■represented here by Captain Lonsdale,
superintendent. The settlement 01
Port Phillip was named after a governor,
/the present metropolis of Victoria after
a statesman, but the subject of our
sketch—Williamstown —after a king.
As Batman ans Faw.kner had re-
ported so favorably on the beauty of
the scenery, jjnd the extraordinary
richness of the pasture lands of Port
Phillip, owners of sto<?k in Van Dicman’s
Land, who did not care to reside them-
selves in the settlement, became anxious
to graze their stock upon its pastures;
and very soon cattle and sheep com-
menced to be landed from the island
to be shipped bade when in marketable
condition. It Vas usual to discharge
large vessels in the bay; if consigned to
Melbourne their .cargoes were trans-
ferred into lighters. Vessels drawing
over,, nine feet at flood tide could not ip.
over'the bar at the mouth of the river
off North Williamstown; but vessels
drawing less than nine feet went up flie
river to Melbourne. It happened that
in the thickly-w T oodcd Williamstown
there was a'bare patch, which the very

first residents in the place gave a name
to —“ The Front”—which is familiar
still. This strip extended from the
corner now occupied by the Bank of
Australasia to the corner of Thompson
street, where shops are now built by
Mr J. H. Craig ; and as the shore here
was a shellbank formation, some vessels
found it perfectly safe to run in on
the sand, remove the sheep into boats
to be landed, and compel the
cattle to swim ashore. The natural
advantage of the place in this respect
drew the attention of shippers to it.
Two sheds built of wood, to be used as
storehouses for shippers of wool, were
the first buildings erected. The next
was a store to supply the inhabitants
and squatters with necessaries, near the
ironmongery establishment now carried
on in “ The Front” by Mr Douglas.
The pioneers of this direct shipping
trade between Williamstown and Van
Dieman’s Land were Mr Manifold, who
grazed stock between Williamstown and
the Werribee or Exe River, and after-
wards went into the Western district,
where his • sons, Messrs Manifold, of
Camperdown, are now well-known ;
and Mr Staughton, of the Werribee,
one of whose sons, Mr S. T. Staughtop,
M.P. for West Bourke, is well-known
in the same occupation* and another
of whom, Mr Simon Staughton,
present owner of the Steampacket hotel.
The scarcity of water at this time, and
for fifteen years afterwards, was the
chief drawback to the place. The only
source of supply was from wells at the
Back Beach. As the trade of the new
settlement increased, it became neces-.
«iry 'to have officials to look after the
lipping; and the Sydney Government
appointed a staff of Customs officers,
consisting of Mr John Stafford, tide
surveyor, and a crew of four Govern-
ment men from Sydney, named Smith,
Jones, Folkes and Bath, with James
Pierce, a man-of-warsman, as coxswain.
Whatever population there was, some
twj|nty souk perhaps, was engaged
exclusively on the Bay, and J. P.
Fawkncr one day, being struck by the
fact, jocosely christened the place
“ The Fishing Village,” a name that
seems destined to stick.
One of the people who lived in VVil-
liamstown when it was first settled still
lives at the age of 88. He is Mr Edwin
Bath, one of the first five boatmen that
commenced Customs work in the Bay.
The year 1837 had closed, and it was
February 1838 —the 25th of the month,
eight o’clock at night—when he
entered Hobson’s Bay. On proceeding
past the Pope’s Eye shoal a vessel was
, sighted ashore, laden with stock from
Van Dieman’s Land to Melbourne. It
proved to be the barque Btitomart) and
Bath, who was on board the cutter
Ranger , rendered such assistance that
the vessel was got off, and he received
special thanks for his gal'ant efforts.
He is a Victorian colonist of 5 1 years
standing, and at one time was possessed
of some means, Bath place (off Fergu-
son street) having been his property.
At the age of 88 he is hale and cheerful,
and his eye still gleams pleasantly.
A hotel, the Ship Inn, was built by
Captain Leard in 1838, on the site now
occupied by the Steampacket hotel. It
was constructed of the material chiefly
used in Williamstown buildings for
many years afterwards—hardwood im-
ported from Van Dieman’s Land —and
was designed as a cottage consisting of
eight rooms and a verandah —a struc-
ture indicating some commercial enter-
prise. Captain John Bowden, who had
brought a brig-load of bottled ale into
the settlement, was the pioneer boni-
face, carrying on the hotel without a
license for about a couple of years, his
principal customers being shippers of
stock. As a counterblast to the open-
ing of the hotel a religious service was
proposed, the first in Williamstown.
The Rev James Smith, a minister of
the Church of England, determined to
preach on Sunday, March 17th, 1838.
He was to come from Melbourne by
boat and to hold the service in one of
the wool sheds, which was emptied of
its contents and swept out, the cobwebs
being brushed down, and projecting
nails and irreligious bits of batten re-
moved ruthlessly. When intelligence

ame that Mr Smith meant to bring his
Melbourne pulpit with him, the pro-
note.rs were thrilled with spiritual joy
.nd intense satisfaction. St. Patrick s
Day—the opening Sunday —turned out
jeautifully fine, and the clergyman was
jot long behind the time appointed.
I'he entire population —including half
;he cutter Ranger's crew of sixty-two
lien —“ smiled when a Sabbath ap-
peared,” and resolved to present an
edifying spectacle on this memorable
day, when religion was to be preached
to the people for the first time.
The minister, dispensing with gown
or surplice, preached a plain practical
sermon on the possibilities of this new
country, and the gratitude due to the
Creator for “the good land He hath
given thee.” As the seating accommo-
dation consisted of one chair, some con-
fusion arose as to the most worthy per-
son to occupy it. The choice fell on
Captain Scott, master of the vessel in
port, and he eloquently expressed his
appreciation of the compliment in
dumb show. At the hymn he was
smartly on his feet, singing lustily until
the last sweet echo had died away, when,
with a very devout aspect, he stooped
to resume his seat, and —fell heavily
on the floor. The first mate, observing
the ultra holiness of his skipper, had
resolved to test his sanctity ; and as he
was in the very act of sitting removed
the chair. The experiment was not a
isuccess from a religious point of view ;
the fall so offended the Captain that a
[few curses, unhappily darkened the first
J service held in Williamstown. The
Iclargyman could not have heard them ;
for Captain Scott, though much dis-
I gusted at the suppressed laughter among
! the congregation, said very little, and
said it softly and to the point, and then
| went on with his devotions
A second hotel was opened by Mr
James Jordan, near the present Club
hotel, Thompson street. It was old-
fashioned with attic windows, though
very comfortable, being lathed and
plastered. Mr Jordan, who conducted
I it, arrived in Sydney in the Asia in
1817, and came t 0 Port Philli P with
Governor Bourke, as his chief constable,
in 1837, when he resigned. Jordan was
an old campaigner ; fought in the
battles of Talavera, Bayonne, Badajos,
Toulouse, Vittoria and Waterloo, and
was one of the soldiers who carried
Lord Hill out of the ravine whon
wounded. He died in April 1877*
leaving a widow, who resides in a small
wooden building at the corner of Parker
and Little Nelson streets—which is the
oldest, I believe, in the town, Jordan’s
Hotel was opened in 1839, and named
the Woolpack Inn. Mr Howe started
business as a baker about the same time
at the back of the site of the bakery
establishment now conducted by Mr
Charles Curtis, Nelson place ; and Mr
John Levien, uncle to the present mem-
ber for Barwon in the Assembly, com-
menced operations as a butcher near
Palmer’s restaurant, Nelson place.
Under the command of Captain Brown
the Fire Fly steamer ran a trip every
day from Melbourne to Williamstown,
charging a pound lare ; and a whale-
boat carried passengers to Liardit’s
H eac h—now Port Melbourne —at the
same rate, landing them as near the
shore as possible, and leaving them
frequently to wade some distance to
dry land, and proceed to Melbourne
or do whatever business they were en-
gaged upon in wet clothing. Liardit’s
Beach was regarded as dangerous for
navigation until 1854.
In this year—lB3B—there arrived
an attractive young woman, who had
been a lady’s help. She had landed in
Australia, under engagement to a lady
and her husband, as far back as 1827,
in the ship John Batry, of London,
being then nineteen years of age. She
left Sydney with her master and mis-
tress three months afterwards, and went
with them to Van Dieman’s Land,
where her master, who had been in
delicate health, died. The widow then
returned to England, but her help re
mained on the island, where she fell in
love, the swain being the son of an
army captain, who, after serving the
British in India, had thrown up his com-
mission and settled in Van Dieman’s

Land. Marriage was the result;
and the young couple arrived in Wil-
liamstown in 1839. They stayed at
Captain Bowden’s hotel, and secured
an allotment in Little Nelson street,
between I hompson and Ann streets,
which has not been parted with since.
This attractive young person was Mrs
Spotswood, now living in Clark street,
a hearty woman, 81 years of age. She
is probably the oldest female colonist at
present in Victoria, having spent sixty-
two years in the colonies, or seven
years less than Captain Barry, the
“old pioneer.” Mrs Spotswood has
been blessed with thirteen children,
forty grand children, and eight great
grand children, and has given her name
to the rising suburb of Spottiswoode,
her husband having bought 119 acres
of it from the Sydney Government in
1847, a t 26s per acre.
The young wife soon left the Ship
Inn to start housekeeping. She was
the pioneer in this matter, and had to
take things as they came. As wood for
building purposes could only be pro-
cured from Van Dieman’s Land, the
walls of her domicile were more difficult
of erection than those of a modern
cathedral, and were put up gradually
as bits and scraps of wood were obtained
from vessels by her husband. She had
her domestic duties to attend to of
course; the silver—a frying pan—to keep
clean; and the drawing-room furniture
—a three-legged stool—to dust. These
articles and a candle mould, some pan-
nikins, tin plates, a box and a bed com-
pleted her household furniture. The
bed presented a very formidable diffi-
culty. The dwelling, so badly off for
walls, was in a much worse plight for a
roof. At night its roof was a sail—the
sail of the boat used by her husband as
a boatman during the day; and this
sail kept flapping in a manner that did
not conduce to slumber. During the
day the house was absolutely without
a, roof, and an important part of Mrs
Spotswood’s wifely duties was to rush
straight for the bed whenever a shower
was coming, squat down on it, and hold
up a large umbrella to protect it from
the rain. These drawbacks did not
prompt her to enquire “Is marriage J
failure”; her young heart being equal td
them She had no fresh water for cook
mg or washing, and had to use sea
water; fresh water had to be brought
in a boat from either Liardit’s Beach"or
Melbourne, and this was undoubtedly
the greatest trouble of all to the house-
keepers and to everyone, and the real
obstacle to settlement for many years.
It affected man and beast, and sheep
in beautiful condition, in their thirst,
used to drink eagerly the sea water on
the Beach, and die there in agony on
the spot, sometimes just after bein°-
landed. °
In 1840 a watchhouse was built near
the corner of Thompson and Little
Nelson streets, part of it still remaining;
a small jetty, to enable persons to get
in or out of a boat with dry feet, was
erected on the inner portion of the
Gem Pier site by the prisoners ; Messrs
Langhorne Brothers, merchants of
Sydney, opened a general store, and
soon afterwards a company was formed
for exporting salt meat; Messrs Bailey
and Clark started a business as black-
smiths in Parker street ; a third hotel,
the Albion, was built in Nelson place,
and carried on by Mr Dawson; Captains
Dalanoy and Morris undertook pilot
work privately, and were drowned in a
very tragic manner while on duty, their
boat being drifted ashore as a mes-
senger of their fate. Four pilots were
then licensed by the Sydney Govern-
ment, Captains Timothy, Tobin,
Trundle and Sutton—father of Mr H.’
P. Sutton, secretary of the Williamstown
Racing Club—much to the satisfaction
of shipowners and shipmasters.
In June of this year an event of much
importance took place at the residence
of the ex-lady’s help. With no canopy
but the blue vault of heaven, a babe
was introduced—the first of the white
race and feminine gender that ever
entered the troublous struggle of life in
Williamstown. It was the offspring of
Mrs Carey, and grew to be a young
woman, and is now married and known
as Mrs Robert Lamont, North Mel-

j bourne. A good deal of controversy can
be easily worked up in Williamstown
even in the year 1889 on this point of
first birth, and the writer is sensible of
the fact in declaring this one to have
been the first he will have incurred the"
1 censure and jealousy of other maternal
claimants, two or three of whom exist.
I A careful investigation of the case by
the writer —who cannot in any respect
be looked upon as a partisan —seems to
show that quite a rush for priority
amongst eager mothers took place be-
i tween the months of June and Decem-
ber, 1840. The Port Phillip Gazette
of 1840, has the following advertise-
ment :
Levien.—At Williamstown, on 29th March,
the “ lady” of Mr B. G. Levien, of a son.
Within a few weeks another advertise
ment appeared ;
Bowden.—On 17th April, 1840, Mrs Bowden
(wife of Captain Bowden, of the Ship Inn),
of a son.
And before any of these
| Sutton.—-On February 16th, 1840, the wife
of T. H. Sutton, of a daughter.
This event took place in Melbourne
and the competitor, as a matter of fair-
ness, must be disqualified. Another
little girl, the child of Mrs Jordan (wife
of the original licensee of the Woolpack
Inn), entered the contest on August
14th, 1840. This birth, though not
the first, was the most auspicious of
them all. None that has occurred in
.Williamstown since can compare to it.
King Benbow’s sway was great as we
have seen; and he determined, on
receipt of the news, to pay the Wool-
pack Inn a royal visit. He was located
at the time in his summer residence—
a mia mia in the direction of the
.Werribee—and with all haste, consistent
with his kingly dignity, proceeded to
the spot, barefoot. His Majesty was ac-.
companied by a train of courtiers con-
sisting or about fifty blacks, quite naked,
but equipped in the fashion of the time
with nullers, spears and boomerangs,
and painted from tip to toe in zig zag
fashion, thechiefs havinga bone through
their nostrils as an ornament. They
gave the necessary indication that the
royal visit was to be friendly. Hac
they intended it to be hostile, the tribe
would have come in war-paint, in terrible
aspect, with yellow zig zag streaks from
their foreheads to their toes, inter-
spersed with scarlet —emblems of war
—scarlet and yellow ochre. After
kindling a fire, proceedings would com-
mence with a dance, three standing
abreast, the lubras beating time with
sticks, and drumming their opossum
rugs, which would be rolled up tight in
a ball ; the movement quiet at first
and the action of the dancers graceful;
until suddenly yells “ Yah !” Yah !”
“ Yah !” “ Yah 1” “ Thur!” “ Thur !”
“ Thur !” “ Thur !” would burst forth,
and be caught up by every member of
the tribe; the pace of the dancers
would quicken and the harmony of the
time-beaters grow confused ; threaten-
ing and dangerous shouts would be
succeeded by cries for “ kidney fat.”'
This was in time of war; kidney fat
would have to be obtained as an aton-
ing satisfaction for some supposed
wrong, perhaps for a lubra stolen.
But to-day it was evident that human
life was not to be taken ; the occasion
was one of joy and friendship. The
colors that decked the royal train were
white and yellow ochre, the emblem of
peace, not scarlet and yellow, the signal
for war. No bloody thirst for kidney
fat ; no dreadful “ Yah !” “ Yah !”
“Brudder” was the word today; and
King Benbow, true Australian native
that he was, used this friendly saluta-
tion, albeit that the object of his good-
will was a little girl. “ Brudder” was
the first word, both courtesy and
diplomacy suggested it; the next words
were “patter” (bread), “bulgarney”
(meat), and “ bul bul” (drink), and it
was the monarch’s stomach within him
that suggested these. “ Bul bul” was a
potion the blacks used to manufacture
by the simple process of steeping sugar
bags in water, and it used to make them
drunk in a very short time. The de-
mands of the royal visitor were quickly
supplied and the lubras, specially
painted for the occasion, then stepped

forward and formally saluted “ their
white countrywoman.”
These obsequies having been done,
a great fire was kindled in a neighbor-
ing tree in Thompson street, in the
evening, and the tribe danced a corro-
boree dance before it in honor of the
festive occasion. Seen in the twilight
with the blaze playing on the fantastic
movements of the dancers, no manipu-
lator of lime light could wish for a
finer effect. “ Patter,” “ bulgarney”
and “ bul bul” went round, and what-
ever was superabundant was given to
the, lubras, who always acted as pack-
horses, to take away with them, when
they, following the mighty Benbow,
retired to the fastnesses of the Werribee.
This little child grew up to woman-
hood, and married Mr Morgan, who
became Mayor of Williamstown. She
died in 1885, at the age of 45 years.
Mr E. Graham, a driver on the railway
line, is the oldest living native of Wil-
liamstown ; and Mr George Spotswood,
who is 48 years of age is not much his

After the splendid reception given to
King Benbow at the Woolpack Inn
much of his natural modesty wore off,
and many residents were favored with
visits from him. As it was never
known, however, whether he might de-
clare for peace or war, the doors of
dwellings were made as secure as pos-
sible, and prudent housewives, in
answering a knock, always took the pre-
caution to bring the tomahawk with
them.
The administration of justice became
a local affair to be regularly conducted
in 1841. From 1837 to 1840 all
Williamstown cases had been tried in
Melbourne. A few weeks before the
Ship Inn was opened as a hotel, a
family came there requiring accommo-
dation. They were supplied with board
and lodged by Captain Bowden, and
made as comfortable as possible. A
female, who formed part of the com-
pany, was not content with the ordinary
regimen but asked to be supplied with
drink. Though the license had not
been taken out, a bottle of wine was
unsuspectingly given her. This illegal
though well-meant act resulted in the
female giving information to Captain
Lonsdale, and Bowden was fined ,£3O
in Melbourne for sly-grog selling and
could not get a license in his own name
at the next sittings of the court.
In March of this year—lB4o—at the
police court, Melbourne, Mr Jordan,
licensee of the Woolpack Inn, was
charged with harboring William Colley,
a prisoner of the Crown. Prisoners at
this time formed no inconsiderable
portion of the population. Those sent
from Melbourne were kept in a stock-
ade (now the West End Brewery),
which had been built for a bonded store
as mentioned before, and the Sydney
convicts (nearly all “ good conduct”
men, who had been transported from
the old country), were engaged in civil
service. They submitted to severe dis-
cipline with heroic fortitude and were
entrusted with perilous enterprises in
constructing lighthouses, adjusting
buoys, and boarding incoming vessels.
The construction of the stonework of the
Breakwater pier, the reclamation of Point
Gellibrand, the formation of Thompson
street and of Nelson Place, are evi-
dences of the valuable services they
rendered, even until 1854, in de-
veloping this town; and much more
that is still undone might have been
accomplished but for the outcry against
their unfair competition with free labor.
Prisoners at this time —1840 —mixed
a good deal with the people, who now
were arriving from Van Dieman’s Land
and Sydney ; and as those arrivals were
from convict settlements, many who
arrived in Williamstown free had prob-
ably not come to Australia free. At
least everyone who arrived was more or
less a suspect; and residents were at
liberty to form their own opinions.
The very phrase “free” immigrant is
suggestive. Even the father of John
Pasco Fawkner was a convict.
Jordan’s defence to the charge of
harboring Colley was that the constable
in charge of the Williamstown station
told him that Colley was a free immi-
grant, and that when he hired him as
The Early History of Williamstown,.


a servant he had no knowledge to the
contrary ; that, when be afterwards be-
came aware of Colley’s real character,
he at once gave information to the
police and had him apprehended for
being illegally at large. Jordan was
ordered to pay forty dollars, namely, a
fine of ten dollars and one dollar a day
for every day (thirty) that Colley had
been in his employ; and when the
time for renewing the license of the
hotel came round, Jordan’s application
was refused. However, this was not
the only matter for which he had been
before the court.
The first police magistrate stationed
n AVilliamstown was Captain Gordon,
i raan-of-warsman, and a disciplinarian
)f the most approved pattern. He not
)nly insisted on being obeyed in every-
thing, and in driving punishment home,
jut he required the people to pay some
•espect to the person of their magistrate,
jpart from his official position. The
irst thing he did on arriving in the
;olony was to order Ned Bath to be
)rought before him for not taking his
tat off to him. It was possible, and
juite probable, that Ned could not have
mown the new functionary ; and it cer-
ainly was not according to his grain at
his time, when he could toss five hun-
Ired weight about as easily as a dog
loes a rat, to take off his hat to every -
iody. He was more after the stamp of
he co'onist who was stopded in the
treet for not uncovering to a gentleman.
’ I don’t know who you are,” pleaded
he offender. “ Well,” said the portly
gentleman, “I am your governor.”
I hen,” was the answer, “You’ve got
d— good billet old man, if I were you
’d stick to it.” Ned’s manner before
ie magistrate was not so outrageous by
ir, and he was let oft after being repri-
manded ; but he never afterwards took
is hat off to Captain Gordon, and was
ever again called upon to do so.
Captain Gordon lived in a tent until
Uarters were built. These still stand
-a wooden house in Thompson street,
elween Nelson place and Little Nelson
feet, occupied by Mrs Nichol as a
oarding establishment. Part of this
building was used by the custom’s boat
crew, part by Captain Gordon as a resi-
dence, and a good-sized room was re-
served for the business of a police court.
The most incorrigible offender about
the place was old Davey Ross, a car-
penter and an old soldier, who lived
near the Harp of Erin hotel in Cecil
street norih, then a cattle run, and was
generally engaged looking after stock.
Davey and Captain Gordon were too
many to live together in a small com-
munity like Williamstown, and from
one cause or another, the former was
pretty frequently “on the carpet.”
Punishment, as a rule, was short and
sharp. There being no place of accom-
modation for prisoners, a person guilty
of a misdemeanor was put in the stocks.
This venerable instrument of cruelty
was fixed up in a spot which now forms
the spacious back yard of “ Craigantina”
—owned and occupied by His Worship
the Mayor—and was constructed of
two stakes driven firmly int > the ground,
with two cross-pieces of wood at the
bottom witjh holes to receive the
prisoner’s legs below the knee. The
top cross-piece was moveable, after the
fashion of a cowbail, and was padlocked
down on the prisoner. Ross was a very
good customer for the stocks, the result
of his drunken habits. He used to vow
vengeance on Captain Gordon to that
functionary’s face, and sometimes vary
his tune by asking him to let him have
a glass of brandy for God’s sake. As
he had many friends, his appeals were
not always vain, and the consequence
wsas that he often became quite drunk
in the place intended for his chastise-
ment and where he had only been
half drunk when pinioned.
Gordon was succeeded by Captain
Buubury as, magistrate and harbor
master, and the stocks were then done
away with, the watchhouse being built.
Religious matters now began to as-
sume a little shape. The Church of
England secured premises for divine
worship in Nelson place, and opened
them with a service conducted by
Bishqp Broughton, of Sydney. Chairs
were provided as liberally as possible,
The Early History of Williamstown.


and the surroundings made in every
way worthy the proverbial taste of the
Anglican church. A large congrega-
tion assembled and went through their
devotions without kicking over a chair,
after the manner of the other mishap
alluded to. Among the worshippers
were the Governor of Tasmania, the
famous Sir John Franklin, with Lady
Franklin and their daughter. This is
the only service in Williamstown at
which a governor and a bishop were
present.
Towards 1848 services were regularly
conducted by Mr Somerville, a lay
reader, the first ordained minister to
officiate regularly being the Rev Mr
Bean, who commenced his ministrations
in 1846. The sacred edifice had been
first used as a retail store by Mr Abra-
hams. The stone work of its walls still
stands and forms part of the 4dvettiser
Exchange, Nelson place.
The first church—a stone building—
was built for the Roman Catholic
denomination, by the Rev hather
Geoghan, attached to St. Francis church,
Melbourne, who came down frequently
during 1843 and 1844 collecting for it.
It is known that at least while raising
the money he drew no distinction be-
tween the denominations; but was
broad-minded enough to urge that by-
gones should be by-gones in this new
land. The reverend divine became
well known to all creeds, and subscrip-
tions followed in merrily. Mr James
Conroy, the original owner of the Pier
hotel, and one of the most enterprising
men that has ever lived in Williamstown,
gave a donation of ;£ioo towards the
work. A stone building was erected.
About a year ago it was pulled down in
order that a new school might be built
on its site.
Transactions in land were important
in the early history of Williamstown
such things as speculation on the part
of the public and enterprise on the
side of the auctioneer being by no
means uncommon. The first govern-
ment sale of land, which took place in
1837, furnishes a proof of the confident
hope even then entertained for the
future of the place. Seven allotments
were offered and purchased on that
occasion at the following prices : —|
Henry McLean, Sydney, £s° 1 S.
Webb, Melbourne, £4O ; J. McNamara
(the local tide surveyor), £43 ; William
Hutton, ; James Simpson, j
J. F. Strahan, £32] and William Leard,
,£46; total proceeds, £3 25. The
second sale was held in September,
1838, when twenty allotments were sub-
mitted in Nelson place and Parker
street. Messrs Hughes and Hoskins,
of Sydney, purchased nine of them, pay-
ing £l9 Bs, £36 2s, £32 6s, Bs,
£36 2S > £s*> £4l 16s, and £3 9 18s,
respectively for them. The minimum
price obtained was £ 19, the purchaser
of the allotment being Mr John Stafford,
the local customs officer. The total
proceeds of the sale was 12s.
Two years afterwards, in September,
1840, as showing the progress the dis-
trict had made, the sum of ,£6,488 was
realized from the sale of twenty-seVen
government blocks, or an average of
per acre. As some of the pur-
chasers were closely identified with the
town, the full list is appended ; —Lot x.

Natives’ Association. For those three
lots Mr Purves paid £920 ; a fortnight
afterwards he sold two of them tor
£l,OOO. That was not a bad fortnight’s
business for 1840 ; nor was a £l,OOO
an acre a small price for land in Wil-
liamstown at that time. The way Mr
Purves worked up the sale was a
caution ; it is doubtful if the devices
of the year 1888, in all the mad excite-
ment of the land boom, surpassed the
magnetic advertisement in which he
announced it. Here it is as it appeared
in the Port Phillip Gazette , Sept. 12th,
1840 :
First Land Sale at Williamstown.
•To merchant gentlemen retiring from business,
mechanics, and the industrious laboring
classes generally.
Mr Purves has the honor to announce to the
above named classes that, to meet the great
desire which has hitherto existed among the
inhabitants of Williamstown, he proposes dis-
posing of, at that flourishing commercial depot,
two allotments admitted to be the most valu-
able sold at the last Government land sale.
| On the ground on Monday 14th September,
at 12 o’clock. They are numbers 18 and 19,
block four, fronting on Codrington place (now
Parker street), Elliott street (now Cecil street),
and Little Nelson street. These will be
divided and put up in lots to suit purchasers as
;early as can be ; and as the terins are exceed-
ingly liberal, Mr P. confidently anticipates a
most spirited contest. The situation is the
most beautiful in Williamstown. No spot
equals them for mercantile houses, private
residences, or the more humble abode of the
hard-wrought and industrious or laboring
class.
On the formation of Williamstown, the want
of a supply of fresh water retarded its growth.
:Since, however, that obstacle has been success-
fully overcome by the spirited exertions of
'Messrs Langhorne Brothers and Company, by
discovering a supply of pure water sufficient
pfor the wants of the largest population in the
polony on the very allotments about to be
[Offered. The auctioneer has been informed on
andoubted authority that springs of water have
'Seen found on the ground. Altogether, with
these advantages, and the convenience the
’situation affords as a bathing place, these allot-
ments stand unrivalled. In the warmest day
[ n summer the heat is agreeably weakened by
:hc fresh cooling sea breeze which always exists,
fo mechanics and laborers it is well-known
•that wages to a greater amount are to be had
• U Williamstown than Melbourne, and building
|sites are 500 per cent, cheaper. Thus Wil-
'liamstown offers brighter prospects and far
•greater inducements to independence and com-
tort. Mr P. would therefore beg principally to
invite the working classes of Melbourne to
attend the sale; and these are respectfully re-
quested to come whether their intentions be to
purchase or not; that they may actually dis-
cover and enjoy one day of that delightful dif-
ference which exists between Williamstown
and Melbourne. Conveyances will be in readi-
ness during the morning and will start from the
Beach (Liardit’s Beach). There will be pre-
pared a most sumptuous luncheon, beneath a
splendid tent ; with a supply of the choicest
wines and all the delicacies of the season.
The scarcity of water in Williamstown
was, as this instructive advertisement
shows, a well-known fact, though it is
doubtful if the well referred to removed
the inconvenience. The only well in
1840 was Gellibrand’s, on Hannan’s
farm, the water from it being, at times,
sold at 30s a load.
The first land sale beyond Ferguson
street was held in October,®!B47, when
Mr Hall, senior, purchased the cele-
brated Hall’s farm ; and Mr Michael
Hannan bought the equally well-known
Hannan’s farm of 40 acres, at 30s an
acre ; and Mr Spotswood purchased, at
26s an acre, 119 acres of the district
which now bears his name. Hall’s farm,
consisting of 100 acres 3 roods 32 per-
ches, originally cost £l ll is 1 id, and
Mr Hall had a hard struggle to keep it;
but he was equal to the trial, as he
always regarded his block as the best
fronting the river. He stocked it with
thirty-twchead of cattle and four horses,
and made about fifty pounds of butter
per week, which he disposed of at eight
pence per lb., and also raised wheat,
oats, barley, peas and potatoes. He
had no notion of ever making it any-
thing but a farm ; and up to the period
of our history—lß73—it had not been
turned to any other use ; but Williams-
town residents know with what advan-
tage it was cut up and subdivided for
business and residence sites within the
last few years. Farming is not only out
of the question in Williamstown now,
but land is rapidly being turned to more
profitable account even in the Werribee
district.
Another element in the life of Wil-
liamstown was the Press. The first
legalised paper published in Melbourne
was the Port Phillip Gazette , the pro-
The Early History of Williamstown.


prietors being Messrs Arden and Strode,
It appeared in October 27th, 1838.
Previous to its advent Mr J. P. Fawkner
had been issuing a manuscript paper
called The Advertiser , but as he had
not entered into the necessary bond of
£3OO to bring it under the law, the
paper was discontinued. He then
brought out a scurrilous publication —
the Port Phillip Patriot —on February
16th, 1839 ; and in January, 1840, a
third paper, the Port Phillip Herald ,
“ impartial not neutral” appeared. To
keep up with the competition the
Gazette was then enlarged. The Gazette
of May 20, 1840, says : —“ On Monday
last Mr Power sold nine allotments at
Williamstown, 33 feet each, for £1733,
to Messrs Murphy, Langhorne, Power
and Simpson.” Land was therefore
sold for £6 a foot in 1840. In the
next month of the same year, Messrs
Langhorne advertise that their commo-
dious new store (now the West End
Brewery) is complete and open for
business. The personalities indulged
in by the papers would make a subur-
ban paper in 1888 blush. The Port
Phillip Herald, , of April 1845, says of
its contemporary : —“ The Port Phillip
Patriot has passed into other hands,
Mr Fawkner, senior, having pur-
chased the paper, but some talk
is made of Mr J. P. Fawkner, jun. once
more taking the reins to fight the battle
for his gentle public. Another rumor
is that a gentleman from Hobart Town
is to be installed ; but we cannot trace
this to a reasonable foundation. One
thing is certain : that Mr William Kerr
will sever his connection with the
Patriot after to-morrow. Mr W. H.
Mortimer follows in his train, and the
paper is to be published but semi-
weekly, as formerly, instead of three
times a week, as latterly.” The Herald
continuing, says : —“ It might reason-
ably have been expected, looking at the
treatment we have received from Mr
Kerr’s hands, that we should express
our gratification at his downfall. We
trust we know our duty to the public
and ourselves better. We regret on
public grounds that Mr Kerr did not
exercise the power he possessed foi
good or for evil with greater discretion
than has marked his career; but with
reference to his outrageous personal
attacks on ourselves —attacks which
were unprovoked and unjust in the
highest degree—we shall pass them by,
remembering that not being in a posi-
tion to defend himself, it would be
cowardly on us to attack an unarmed
man.” This was the chivalrous Mr
George Cavanagh, editor of jthe Herald ,
writing, and to his credit it must be
said that the Herald was a journal with
more fairness and principle than its
contemporaries. There was little to
write about when the Home news by
the mail was exhausted, and the papers
were obliged to fill in the intervals talk-
ing about themselves. As showing the
prospects not simply of Williamstown,
but of Port Phillip, in 1845, the Herald
ot May, in that year says : —“ Our en-
thusiastic contemporary ushers his
journal to the public this morning as a
daily publication. The object of this
is evidently to forestall the worthy
alderman —Mr Kerr who, having
shipped'his type and printer per Sham-
rock, to Sydney, intends to ship himself
per same vessel next trip to these shores
for the purpose, as he asserts, of publish-
ing a daily print in opposition to the
Patriot . After an uninterrupted ap-
prenticeship of ten years to the news-
paper press, we may be presumed tc
know something of its management,
aud with this knowledge, we deliberately
state that no daily paper can pay in a
small community like Melbourne. Were
the other papers to stop publishing al
together, and leave the field entirely
unopposed to one daily press, the specu
lation would be a failure in less thar
three months. As to Mr Kerr’s starting
a daily paper in Melbourne, the idea to
our mind is positively absurd and, with
him at all events, impracticable.” Mi
Cavanagh was right. The Courier ap
peared in June, 1845, and collapsec
in a few r months.
The means of communication be
tween Melbourne and Williamstowr
were too slow to render the Melbourn*

papers either popular or useful, and an
ingenious device was hit upon by which
news reached those interesred in a
cheap and efficacious manner. A giant
tree grew on a spot adjacent “ Craigan-
tina” buildings, and was used both as
an advertising medium and an organ of
public opinion. Did anyone want a
servant ? He posted a notice on the
tree. Had he a horse for sale or a job
to be done by tender ? Forthwith he
posted for a purchaser or a tenderer to
the tree. Was a dog lost or boat tackle
stolen? The public were made aware
of the accident or the theft by a poster
on the tree. The tree thus became not
only a medium of information, but a
market where labor and property were
bought dnd sold and all sorts of ideas
ventilated. I have been extremely for-
tunate in receiving from the facile pen
* of an early colonist the following humor-
ous but eloquent description of this
tree. It is almost needless to say it is
from the pen of a poet ; poetasters are
generally recognised by their prose.
The poet is Mr James Wallace, now of
Geelong, the oldest schoolmaster in the
colony, and the teacher of the first
public school opened in Williamstown.
He landed here in 1841, and is a warm
friend of Mr M. Brew, of the Stag’s
Head hotel, whose parents arrived in
Williamstown in 1839, and to whom I
am largely indebted for the lines. Mr
Wallace says :
The earliest tradition regarding the Old Tree
is to the effect that long before this country
was colonised it was held in almost religious
veneration by the aboriginals ; that it was be-
neath its umbrageous shade they held their
councils, and that after a battle with a hostile
tribe it was at the foot of this tree they regaled
upon their roasted captives.
The next item of tradition is, that upon one
grand joyous occasion, all the white men in the
colony assembled beneath it and drank undi-
luted rum out of government pannikins, until
they became so overwhelmingly joyful that they
lay down and sought refuge from the burthen
of their bliss in the regions of Somnus.
From the period of this remarkable event
all that happened worth historical notice was
that a circular seat being fixed around it, it
| became the favorite resting place of the
permanently unemployed, vulgarly called
“ loafers'’, and also the toil-wearied speculative
boatmen and other philosophical operatives,
especially the wood-carter, Mick Ryan, and
the policeman, Ned Stanley, where they
smoked their pipes, and spun their yarns, and
if the schoolmaster happened to join the party
the subject of conversation was elevated to the
consideration of the merits of the universe as
a work of art, as to whether it made itself or
was made by some one else, and if so, who
was “ on the job?”
But these good old times of Arcadian sim-
plicity having passed away, and the gold fever
having set in, the land became inundated by a
crowd of human locusts from all points of the
compass, and Williamstown, in common with
other tumble down villages, suddenly became
an important town, and was afflicted with an
instrument of torture called a municipal coun-
cil. At the sante time it was discovered by a
number of unimaginative matter-of-fact citit
zens, who were the fortunate owners of a
variety of vehicles, such as butcher’s and baker’s
carts, wheelbarrows, &c., that since the highly
enlightened members who constituted the
municipal grinding-machine were sufficient
ornaments to the town, the services of the Old
She-oak Tree, in that capacity, was no longer
required, and as it was an object of vehicular
obstruction, the council was called upon to have
it removed. Upon the question, “to be or not
to be” regarding its further existence, the coun-
cil became divided. The members who owned,
or had an interest in wheelbarrows, portable
baked potato institutions, baker, butcher or
dung carts, were resolved that it should be cut
down and then cut up ; sold for firewood and the
money sent home to England to benefit the
poor. The other portion of the council, who
were sadly in the minority, being ot a aestheti-
cal turn of mind, and ardent admirers of the
“sublime and the beautiful”, resolved to stand
up in defence of this venerable arbor town
ornament, though it should cost them the last
shred of their popularity. Outside and inside
the councd chamber the question was so vio
lently debated that it created quite a hurricane
in the Williamstown social teapot. A report
was current and passed from mouth to ears,
through the medium of whispers, that certain
members of the council, remarkable for pugna-
city and bloodthirstiness, went to the council
chambers secretly armed with daggers and
revolvers. Another report took wing and flew
about to the effect that a number of the “ sub-
lime and beautiful” party concocted the design
of borrowing the loan of Captain Burrell’s old
rusty cannon, which he kept as an ornament in
front ot his marine store, in Nelson parade,
then to charge it with powder and red wine
grapes instead of grapeshot to the muzzle, so
that when discharged among the enemy the
red juice of the grape, being mistaken for their
own blood, would make each think himself
mortally wounded, and flying in consternation,
leave the aesthetic philosophers masters of the
situation. While all this agitation was in opera-
tion, causing widely spread consternation, I
arose one morning, and while taking my usual

spot where had stood the “ pride of the village
in ancient times, horror of horrors what did I
see? Why, there lay the severed trunk and
broken limbs of the object of their contest
strewn o’er the ground,'where from prehistoric
times it had been, both by the savage and the
civilised, regarded as an object of veneration
and ornamentation. Verily, in this tragical
instance, the oft-repeated words of tha poet
were falsified, who has said that
“ A thing of beauty is a joy for ever.”

Poet Laureate of the village or the ill-to-do

spirit of darkness to my aid, who promptly
appeared in the attractive shape of a bottle of
dark brandy, the following perpetration was
the result:
THD LAST DYING SPEECH OF THE
OLD SHE-OAK TREE.
Addressed to the. Williamstown Council ,
a.d. 1857.
Sage Councillor Moxham sincerely I thank,
Though I’m not long destined to stand on
my shank ;
Who could think his rough bosom so tender
could be.
As to plead for the life of an Old She-Oak
Tree.
This proves that he owns the bright soul of a
poet,
Though dull Williamstownians appear not to
know it;
His love of the “ Beautiful and the Sublime”,
Being rather ecstatic for blank verse or rhyme,
E’re Brett with his placards disfigured my trunk,
Or Christian neW chums ’neath my shade
got mad drunk ;
When sable-skinned heroes sat round me and
boasted,
While feasting on foes they had vanquished
and roasted.
Often, if you saw me, you’d fall on your knees
And pay me due homage as Queen of Oak-
Trees ;
But, now I must fall by the axe of improve-
ment,
While none but wise Moxham opposes the
movement.
Tis true, he was backed by dear kind Captain
Langford,
But, candidly speaking he scarce can be
thanked for t ;
His heart is so kind, and his manner so civil,
He seconds all motions, for good or for evil,
When I think of the war-dances, feasting and
bobbery,
While the woods echoed round with joyous
corobberie ;
It grieves me to think, I must now fall a
martyr,
To suit every fish-hawker, butcher, and
carter.
Ere I kiss mother earth, let me utter this pray’r,
That Cloclson, nor Verdon, may never be
Mayor ;
May the rude fist of politics smashingly box
them.
For opposing the motion of chivalrous Mox-
ham.
Magnanimous Moxham, thou noble of soul,
May thy name ever stand at the top of the
pole;
May eloquence flow from thy persuasive
tongue,
’Till applause from the lips of opponents be
wrung.
And when thou has reached the proud zenith
of fame,
When knighthood’s bright halo encircles
thy name,
Let me beg that the crest on thy chariot shall
be,
Nine placards stuck round on an Old She-
Oak Tree.
Jack Armstrong, where is thy goodness of
heart,
So famous for taking a poor fellow’s part;
How oft ’neath my shade after daily turmoil^
You indulged in a yarn, a smoke, and a coil_
With my last dying breath let me claim your
protection,
Don’t give me to Dr Maclean for dissection ;
That versatile bright esculapion spark,

JAMES WALLACE.
As the gold discovery of 1851
caused a rush of ships to the Bay
that has never since been equalled, the
population and trade of Williamstown
became remarkably brisk, and there was
need for a local paper. As Port Phillip
was separated from New South Wales
in that year, with a parliament of its
own, the necessity for some newspaper
circulating among the local people
was pressing, and in response to the
The Early History of Williams town.


sighs of the community, the Chtonicle
appeared, price threepence. It was
still in the field at the time our history
closes, going well, with the running all
to itself; but how it would fare after
1874, when the Advertiser appeared as
a rival, is distinctly another matter, and
one that fortunately need not be gone
into even in a spirit of prophecy. We
shall simply record, as in duty bound,
that whatever literary nourishment the
public derived from a local press within
the period of our history was supplied
solely and entirely by the Chtonicle.
A reference to the land transactions
would seem to show that the prospects
of Williamstown were exceptionally
bright and promising in the year 1841
and 1842. This was undoubtedly the
case, and settlement was very rapid
during those years. There was then
a period of quiet extending from 1844
to 1851; when the question of obtaining
better communication with Melbourne
assumed some importance. The first
regular means of going from one place
to the other was provided in 1846, when
Mr James Hall, senior, of Hall’s farm,
accepted, at £36 a year, a contract to
carry the Custom’s letter box from Wil-
liamstown to Melbourne. He used to
start at eight in the morning and return
at about six in the evening, generally
bringing copies of the Herald , Gazette
and Patriot. When the river was high he
had to cover the distance between the
present Punt and the Fall’s bridge on
foot. In 1848, a skiff was introduced
for the work and thenceforth parcels
were carried either way. A year after-
wards—February, 1849 —Mr William
Hall, jun., joined his brother, their craft
being a four-oared whaleboat, designed
to carry passengers. In the year 1852,
the Gem pier having been so lengthened
that a small vessel might venture along-
side, the steamer Comet (Capt. Carder),
a vessel sent over from Sydney, com-
menced running two trips a day from
Melbourne to Williamstown. The
steamer Spec next appeared, and a few
years afterwards the Messrs Hall re-
tired from the contest, to resume it in
after years. The system of discharging
vessels into lighters, which has always
obtained in Williamstown, gave Captain
Cole, the owner of a number of lighters
and the gentleman after whom Cole
street is named, a busy and lucrative
undertaking for many years. Room
yet remained for improving the commu-
nication between the two places, and a
scheme was proposed for the purpose
In 1852, the prospectus of the Mel-
bourne and Williamstown Railway Com-
pany appeared with a capital of £50,000
in 10,000 shares of £5 each, the
Government of the day guaranteeing
five per cent to the shareholders for
twenty years on the' amount of their
investment. The aim of the company
was to construct a jetty at Williamstown,
to be carried out into the Bay, to admit
of ships of the largest burden unloading
in all states of the tide ; to carry the
railway from Melbourne parallel with
the river bank, and to provide ware-
houses for the storage of property. Per-
mission to carry out the work having
been obtained from the Legislative
Council (then the only parliamentary
chamber) on January 17th, 1859, the
line was opened for traffic.
Williamstown was now well off in the
matter of communication, and the ac-
commodation of vessels extended under
the charge of Captains Harrison and
Ferguson, who succeeded Captains
Lewis and Bunbury respectively as
Harbormasters.
Some time about the end of 1847, or
the beginning of 1848, the British
Government passed a resolution that
selections should be made from the
criminal inhabitants of Pentonville
Prison, put on board a transport ship,
conveyed to Port Phillip, and there,
after receiving their freedom, live on a
social level with the immigrant popula-
tion, converting, may be, Australia
Felix into a Thieves’ Paradise. These
promising youths, when compared with
the inmates of the other prisons, might
be considered comparatively innocent \
none of them had been convicted of
committing murders, nor had they
even graduated to the position of
bank robbers or burglars. They wore

the prison uniform until they were able
to replace it with the costume of the
period; and the old colonists, who,
did not regard them as a desirable ad-
ditions to the population, derisively
styled them “ The Pentonville Pets.”
One fine summer’s evening in the
year 1848, Mr James Wallace was re-
turning from Melbourne on horseback
to Williamstown, where he filled, as he
said, “ the more honorable than profit-
able position of village schoolmaster.”
The horse he rode was a small specimen
of the Timor pony breed. On his way
to the Saltwater Punt, which was the
crossing place, about where the Foots-
cray railway bridge stands now, he was
hailed by one of a couple of “ old
hands,” who were snugly ensconsed in
a sheltered nook, enjoying themselves
over a bottle of rum and a pannikin—
the universal drinking vessel amongst
lags. They first of all took Mr Wallace
for a new chum, and remarked that he
was more fit to carry the horse than it
was to carry him. The schoolmaster
wittingly replied that they were carrying
each other turn about, and that at pre-
sent it was the horse’s turn. The river
being high he had to wait some time
before the Punt could be worked with
safety; and when he resumed his
journey night had set in—a night of re-
markable darkness. As he passed
through the lonely shades of Stony
Creek he thought to himself “ what a
place this would be to commit a
murder.” “At the moment that I gave
expression to that diabolical jocu-
larity,” says Mr Wallace, “there lay
close to me a fellow being—a young
man scarce twenty years old —with his
throat cut from ear to ear !” He was
not, however, aware of that until he
reached Williamstown, though he passed
a party of police on his way.
Next day Mr Wallace was one of a
jury of Williamstown men summoned
to hold an inquest on the body, before
Dr Wilkins, the coroner. It appeared
from the evidence of Constable Brady,
afterwards governor of the gaol, that
Matthew Luck, a Pentonville “pet,”
had a brother in Tasmania in business
doing well, who, when he heard of his
younger brother having arrived in Port
Phillip a freed man, sent for him, paying
his passage in the Black Swan, which
traded between Melbourne and Laun-
ceston, and was to sail from Williams-
town in a few days. It was Matthew
Luck who was murdered, and Augustus
Dansey, his late companion, was in
custody, charged with the murder. In-
deed in the streets of London, in the gaol
there afterwards, on board the ship to
Melbourne, and even in the colony,
they had been constant associates. Since
they arrived they had occupied the
same lodging house and slept in the
same bed. Dansey was arrested on
suspicion of being the murderer, he
being the last one seen in the company
of Luck. A pocket-knife, with blood
on the blade, was found in his posses-
sion. Doughboy, a well-known Wil-
liamstown identity, the broom maker
and barber of the village, who spent
most of his time in the bar of the Ship
Inn, recording his “ Vandemonian ; ’ ex-
periences, happened to be on the look
out for a free drink, on the day of the
murder, when Luck and Dansey came
into the bar. They had been down to the
beach, and Doughboy had hired a boat
to take Luck to the Black Swan. They
were too late ; the Swan had sailed
some hours previously. Now they were
on their return to Melbourne. Dough-
boy as usual introduced his engaging
conversation, and Luck, being of a
communicative disposition, innocently
gave all the particulars of his prospects,
even mentioning the sum of money his
brother had sent him. The pair took a
bottle of ginger beer and some bread
with them, Matthew Luck paying all
expenses.
The Puntsman at the Saltwater River
had a distinct recollection of seeing two
“ Pentonvilles” —the one in custody
and the murdered man—cross the
river for Williamstown. The latter
had been so overjoyed at the prospect
of seeing his brother that he could not
help talking about it. There was no
other passenger on the Punt at the
time, and they were both dressed in their
The Early History of Williams town.


prison clothes. He saw Dansey return
in the evening alone ; and while he was
re-crossing Dansey said, in reply to a
question as to the fate of his companion,
“Oh, yes, he is on his way to his brother,
I saw him off.”
A juryman demanded that the
prisoner should be brought in and
caused to look on his supposed victim.
If he were guilty blood, he said, should
flow from the fatal wound. The
coroner ordered the experiment to be
tried. Dansey entered; but no blood, it
is needless to say, spouted from the
wounds of the victim. When Brady
informed him that he had been found
guilty, he replied that if he had a smoke
and a pint of porter he would feel quite
happy. He was hanged in due course.
The following lines were written by
Mr Wallace on viewing the spot:—
Stop traveller! view this blood-stained spot,
Tis marked with murder’s fearful blot;
’Twas here the foul assassin’s knife,
Destroyed a faithful comrade’s life.
Nor fell revenge, nor deadly hate,
Had urged the hapless victim’s fate ;
Premeditated, stern and cold,
The monster slew for love of gold.
From friends afar, and native shore,
The parched earth drank his young heart’s
gore ;
Life’s brilliant hopes—young manhood’s bloom
Were blasted by a fearful doom.
But, He who dwells on Heaven’s high throne,
Who heard the exile’s dying groan ;
With vengeful hand shall crush with speed,
The author of th’ infernal deed.
JAMES WALLACE, Sen.
On the night of April 2nd, 1852, oc-
curred in the waters of Hobson’s Bay
a piece of work which is destined to
remain as one of the most extraordinary
crimes recorded in the by no means
spotless record of the colony—the re-
markable Nelson gold robbery. On a
mild and peaceful evening, when the
rays of a full moon fell clearly on the
motionless water; when the Bay was
dotted with ships as it had never been
covered before, and has seldom been
since; when most of her crew were
ashore enjoying a well-earned rest from
toil, and others were asleep below —
a gang of men with muffled oars
c
rowed rapidly and silently to the side
of the barque Nelson as she lay at
anchor in the Bay. Without resistance
or even challenge they boarded her;
and at once proceeded to show that
they knew she had ten thousand
ounces of gold on board as part of
her cargo for England. With faces
blackened and covered with crape to
prevent recognition they promptly made
prisoners of a boy and two men, bind-
ing them, and throwing them into the
forecastle. The chief officer—our well-
known townsman Captain Draper,
examiner for the Marine Board —hav-
ing made his appearance from aft was
next called upon to surrender, and at
the same time rushed upon ; he strug-
gled and resisted and was not over-
powered until one of the robbers fired
a revolver at him, wounding him in the
thigh. They now seized the swivel
guns on the poop-deck and every
weapon they could lay their hands on,
and threw them into the sea. Straight-
way|then to the lazarette, for the golden
booty valued at nearly sterling,
was the next move. This splendid trea-
sure they secured, getting it into their
boats; every human being on board
was next imprisoned in the lazarette,
and then the daring robbers made off
with their booty, having performed one
of the boldest feats ever known in the
colony in a perfectly successful manner.
One man escaped to tell the tale,
and upon news of the wild adventure
becoming know measures were taken,
even before next morning, to search the
country round. The Harbormaster,
the water police and civilians innumer-
able, went out on the bay in boats ; the
mounted police and others scoured the
land, and the government offered a
large reward. The press teemed with
criticism, reflecting on the management
of the ship, and blaming Captain
Wright, the master, for not having a
watch on board. Still the daring
pirates remained at large. The only
clue of them that could be found was
one of their boats picked up at the St.
Kilda beach; and tracks of a dray,
which had evidently been there in
The Early History of Williamstown.


readiness, as part of the scheme, to
carry off the treasure. From this point
all trace was lost, and baffled all inves-
tigation for several years. But the
matter was not destined to be forgotten.
Three men were at length arrested,
placed in dock, convicted, and sen-
tenced to penal servitude for life.
Their conviction did not solve the
whole mystery. No trace of the trea-
sure has been found, and in all human
probability no trace ever will be.
In April, 1856, Williamstown was
incorporated under Captain Clarke’s
Act as a municipality. A Board of
Health had previously been in exist-
ence, but having little power and less
funds and no authority to levy rates or
impose any form of local taxation, its
usefulness was not very great. The
new municipality consisted of seven
representatives, namely, Messrs Thomas
Mason (chairman), Stewart, Verdon,
(now Sir George), Watson, Armstrong,
Dr D. P. Maclean, and Captain Lang-
ford. Mr John Rees was town clerk,
and was succeeded by Messrs Nichol-
son and F. Tattersall, and in 1864 by
Mr G. F. Smith. Mr Bull was the
first surveyor, and did a lot of work.
His operations were on the south side
of Ferguson street ; north of it the land
had been sold for farms in 80 to 120
acre blocks, and was not within the
jurisdiction of the municipality. Mr
John Findlay (now of the Colonial
Bank) took the council’s contracts,"one
of the first streets he made being Little
Nelson street. The council meetings
were held in a wooden building—the
original Woolpack Inn —in Thompson
street, now no more. The premises
now known as a council chamber were
built both for a municipal council and
a municipal court. The police court
was held by Captain Pasco in the build-
ing in Thompson street now u»ed as a
furniture warehouse by Messrs Kra-
kowski and Fredman, and nautical and
other cases were generally heard before
him; while the other building was at
first used exclusively for cases be-
tween local residents, and was presided
over by the chairman of the council
for the time being. In October,
1863, Williamstown was proclaimed a
borough, and continued so for the fol-
lowing ten years. The late Mr Daniel
Inglis, of North Williamstown, had the
honor of being its first mayor.
In 1849 a tragic occurrence happened
to two fishermen who lived in Williams-
town. They were killed by lightning
while fishing in a boat on the Yarra.
One of the men was father-in-law to the
other, and both left widows in poor cir-
cumstances. A collection was at once
made and splendidly responded to.
The public of Melbourne were also
attracted by the melancholy nature of
the case and subscribed a good deal of
money, chiefly in consequence of a
poem on the subject by Mr James
Wallace, of Williamstown, which ap-
peared in the Melbourne papers at the
time. I have received a copy of the
stanzas from the author, and in taking
the liberty of inserting them here can
only regret that they have not been ac-
corded a place more worthy of their
beauty as a piece of poetic composi-
tion :
I love to roam on Williamstown’s lone shore,
When wanton gales awake the slumbering
ocean;
When like roused lions the wild whirlwinds
roar, . . , ,
And clouds and billows rise in dread com-
motion.
I love to view the bold barque sweeping o er
The warring waters with a seagull’s motion,
In stern defiance of the hostile waves,
While Boreus blusters and dread Neptune raves.
Ten thousand red bolts cleave the sable sky.
The firm earth quakes beneath the crashing
thunder,
Two fearless men in death’s embraces lie—
One fatal flash their life-threads rent
asunder.
Two frantic widows raise the wild death-cry.
The awe-slruck villagers are mute with
wonder.
A hapless mother and her daughter mourn,
In life no more their fathers shall return.
It melts the heart to see yon orphan boy,
Who waits impatient on the. cold bleak
shore,
And o’er the bright waves cast an anxious eye—
He seeks a parent he shall ne’er see more.
His sister weeps, the poor child wonders why—
Grief never clouded her fair brow before—
To thee, poor Jacob, ignorance is bliss,
Those lips are clay-cold thou wert wont to kiss,
The Early History of Williamstown,


Who loved a father, and loved him alone,
Because no other being claimed his love,
Can sigh, responsive to the orphan’s moan ;
Who weeps for him translated to above.
Hearts may be grief-proof as if made of stone,
But not so mine—long years I vainly strove
The tyranny of sorrow to suppress ;
Yet years of struggle made my grief no less.
Oh, how uncertain are life’s precious gifts,
How frail the loved ones we so fondly
cherish,
When the Omnipotent His hand uplifts,
To strike down those foredoomed by fate to
perish.
A-down the stream the boat unguided drifts,
No more bright hopes its lifeless inmates
nourish ;
The morning sun shone on their manhood’s
bloom,
Its evening rays shall gild their lowly tomb.
JAMES WALLACE.
As a sequel to the Stony Creek
tragedy an authentic ghost story is
told on the authority of Mr James
Wallace, an eye-witness, which may be
given in that gentleman’s own words :
THE WILLIAMSTOWN GHOST
STORY.
A Sequel to the Stony Creek Tragedy,
“ Some books are lies frae end to end,
And some great lies were never penned.
But this, which I am going to tell,
Which lately on a night befel,
Is just as true’s the diets in Hell,
Or Dublin City.
That e’er he nearer comes oursel,
’S a muckle pity."
There lived in the locality of the Saltwater
punt, now the town of Footscray, at the time
of the tragedy, a particularly strong-minded
man, who made his presence heard and felt
among the crowd whenever there was one of
which he formed an element, and who, being of
a very dark complexion, was known by the
name of Black Paddy Ryan. Black Paddy’s
loud voice, bold manner, and athletic figure
impressed the people with the belief that he
was possessed of a good stock of bravery. But
the pacific state of society afforded him no op-
portunity of showing it until after the execu-
tion of Dansey, the murderer, and then an
incident occurred which showed that Black
Paddy’s courage was confined to this world,
and that he had no ambition to exercise his
courage in the dominion of Ghostland. It
happened, on one occasion, that Paddy was
delayed in Williamstown until the night set in,
and as there was some vague rumor afloat that
a ghost or two had been seen on several occa-
sions at the scene of the murder, which was
reported to be haunted, and Paddy, being a
firm believer in ghosts, and in their playing
tricks upon travellers, frightening nursemaids,
and compelling benighted schoolboys, when
passing through graveyards, to whistle in order
to keep their courage up, as the poet Blair
informs us, he resolved to keep clear of the
spot where the murder was committed. In-
stead of returning by the crossing place, the
scene of the murder, he deviated to the left and
got out of his latitude. After wandering about
until wearied, he found the hospitable farm-
house of Davy Ross. Here he refreshed and
rested himself, and then resumed his journey.
He got lost again, and wandered about until
the moon half emerged above the horizon, and
he found himself—why, at the very spot he
had striven by all means to avoid—at the flat
stone where the murdered man was found.
There were no fretful porcupines in Williams-
town in those days to which a ghost might have
alluded ; but when Paddy found where he was
the discovery certainly did freeze his blood.
There lived in those days in Williamstown
Thomas Sloan, the village cooper. He had
been a boatswain on board a man-of-war —had
sailed every sea, crossed every ocean, and was
in the habit of facing danger and death during
many years. This was true as regarded danger
in shape of shipwrecks and storms, bullets and
bombshells; but the moment danger assumed
the form of a ghost Tom’s courage evaporated,
and he fled without waiting to analyze the
materials of which ghosts were composed.
One fine Saturday, after it became generally
known that a couple or more ghosts had
established their head station at the scene of
the murder at Stony Creek, and that they
were on view at all hours, weather permitting,
and to be seen gratis, between “ the gloaming”
and twelve o’clock, I had urgent business in
Melbourne. My pony, knowing it was Satur-
day. and likely to be a go-to-town day, rendered
himself so invisible that though all my scholars,
stimulated by the promise of unlimited lollies,
searched everywhere, pony eluded their search,
and I took a passage in Mr William Hall’s
boat that sailed regularly between Williams-
town and Melbourne on Royal Mail service,
and used to accommodate a limited number of
passengers at the rate of what he jocularly
termed “ a bob-a-nob,” which when interpreted
meaneth a shilling a head. Having transacted
my business, I was on my way towards Cole’s
wharf to take shipping homewards again in Mr
Hall’s boat, when I met my neighbour Tom
Sloan. He had come around the road with
his horse and cart to purchase domestic
necessaries, and had not yet completed his
purchases. “ But it would be a moonlight
night, and it would save a ‘ bob,’ he said, if I
would wait and accompany him on the cart
around the road.” I thought to myself that
my finances could afford a “ bob” without feel-
ing the privation, and that I would derive so
much enjoyment on the journey by Mr Hall’s
boat and its pleasant passengers, that if I were
the giant Cormoran, with his two heads, I
would not hesitate to pay two “ bobs” for my
pair of “ nobs” rather than endure the slow
motion of Tom’s cart over nine miles of an up-
and-down track, enduring at the same time a

thousand pitches and tosses skywards and in .
the direction of the lower regions. And —
what would prove equally purgatorial —to
hear him relate for the three thousand and
forty-ninth time, his adventures among the
Patagonians. But all the objections that I
raised were overruled by Tom, and he so
earnestly besought me to accompany’him that
I consented. /
It was dark when we crossed the Saltwater
punt, but the moon had arisen sufficiently high
to dispel the darkness from the depths of the
creek, and Tom had finished telling me for the
ten-thousand-and-first time his experiences and
sensations during some one of his hundred sea-
fights, when—the horse came to a/sudden
halt. We both looked forward to see the cause.
But no other reason could be discovered except
that we were in front of the flat, upright rocf:
against which Matthew supposed to
be sitting when Dansey commenced his
butchery by striking him on the temple,
leaving the mark of the blow from a bottle
plainly discernable —the bottle which, upon
Doughboy’s evidence, they carried' full of
ginger-beer from the public house, and which
the jury found smashed to, pieces at the spot
where the body lay.
Tom lay stroke after stroke with his whip on
the immovable horse. But his blows produced
no effect. lie then looked around in search of
some other means of making the animal move.,
Turning his eyes in the direction of the flat-
faced upright stone he exciaimed “ Dash my
buttons, Wallace, look! look at that!” pointing
in the direction of the flat-faced stone.
Let me here observe that “ dash my buttons”
was Tom’s only substitute for an oath or an
imprecation. Confining himself to this one
safety valve for letting off the ejaculatory steam,
he used it so very frequently that his conversa-
tion might be said to be as densely ornamented
with buttons as a footboy’s jacket.
On hearing exclamation, I looked in
the direction his finger indicated, and there
behind the flat stone I beheld a dark body.
It bore the vague resemblance of a human figure,
but w-as of a shadowy consistency. Having
taken a steady look at it, he asked, “ What do
you make that out to be ?”
«• I don’t know ; let us go and examine it.”
“ No, dash my buttons if I do. I’d stand in
front of a twenty gun battery if duty called on
me, but it is no man’s duly to meddle with
ghosts.” • . .
As I had some years previously by means’ of
books and reasoning emancipated myself from
the tyranny of ghosts, and learned to attribute
all ghostly phenomenon to natural causes, my
Conduct on this occasion did not partake of
one particle of the brave or the heroic. That
cannot be heroism which in the case of ghosts,
goblins and demons, springs from the utter un-
belief of the existence of such being at this side
of the grave. Therefore, as I have a dislike to
receive anything, desirable or otherwise, under
false pretences, I beg of the reader to withhold
his admiration.
Acting, then, on the firm persuasion that
the shadowy phenomenon was an optical illu-
sion, and seeing a fair opportunity of throwing
Brutus, Richard the Third, and Thomas Sloan
into the back grounds as far as regarded hero-
ism, by simply walking through a ghost, which
none of these heroes dare do ; and in -order
that, when Tom would in future attempt to
overwhelm me with exploits amid shipwrecks
and tempests, bullets, bombshells, batteries,
&c., I would be in a position to “ pull him up
short” by saying, “Yes, yes, that’s all tre-
mendously fine, Tom, but you hadn’t pluck
to walk through a ghost as I had”—l, actuated
By this motive, went for the ghost, determined
? walk through it.
But the shadow, although a short distance
away, receded as I advanced, and yet kept so
close to me that if it were palpable I could have
touched or grasped it. I resolved, since I could
not w f alk through it, that I shove my
fist through it; but in deliveringithe blow I
allowed my body to bend too far forward, the
centre of gravity overturning the base, and I
fell prone on the earth.
When I recovered my upright position the
ghost had vanished ; but the horse, not hav-
ing recovered from its fright, still refused to
move until released from the cart, when it
suffered itself to be led up to the open plain,
whether it ’’became so much recovered that it
carried us both into the village.
Tom Sloan’s nijme being on his dray, all
who passed it on the day following before it
was removed, required an explanation, and
CTom brought his inventive faculties into opera-
tion, and heaped horrors on horrors to such an
extent that, were it not for the heat of the
weather the awe-struck listener’s blood would
run cold. At length the ghost story reached
the ears of that prince of wondermongers,
Jemmy Green, the principal Melbourne barber,
who kept 1 a combined curiosity shop, in Collins
street. One would think that when it passed
from Tom Sloan’s hands there would be no
room at this side of possibility for improvement;
but Tom compared to Jemmy, was only as the
apprentice to the master. Jemmy so re-adorned
it. with additional horrors, that all who needed
a barber or hairdresser’s service came crowding
to his shop, chiefly for the purpose of hearing
him -tell the yarn, and, like the the proverbial
snowball that increased by rolling—day after
day he continued to pile up newly-fabricated
horrors..
One day, happening to be in Melbourne, as
I was passing Jemmy Green’s shop my name
was called, and on looking behind, there stood
Jemmy at his door, beckoning at me with a
mysterious energy. I entered the shop and I
found it crowded with the unshaved and the
undipped,, Xhen did Jemmy flourish his
scissors in the air, strike an attitude and say,

i Augustus Dansey.” In reply, I begged to be
excused the pain of dwelling upon it; it was
too horribly horrible, and, knowing the con-
fusion such a dreadful ordeal would give rise
; to, I rushed out.

and triumph over discipline, he repre-
[ sents his hero as being dost in ship-
, wreck—as going down to the bottom in
; the embrace of a lady whom, even as a
| felon, he had had the courage and the
1 privilege to love. Such a death, even
as a matter of poetic justice, was good
: enough for a convict-—self-destruction
1 was much more common.
1 On March 26th, 1858, on a Govern-
ment reserve, near the railway work-
shops, one of the officers in charge of the
convicts at Williamstown was done to
ideath by a gang of them. The name
of the victim was Captain Price —the
original, according to many authorities,
from whom Marcus Clarke drew his
disciplinarian—Maurice' Frere. Captain
Price was murdered in broad daylight,
openly and atrociously, after coming
ashore from the hulks in the Bay where
some of the prisoners used to be kept.
He walked up to the quarry where they
were working in his usual cool, confi-
dent, overbearing style, to issue orders.
Upon a pre-arranged sign being given
by one of the convicts the gang at-
tacked him, knocked him down, and
beat him with their picks and shovels
until the unfortunate man ceased to
move. When word went to head-
quarters that the convicts had broken
out, all the mounted police in Mel-
bourne were despatched to the scene.
The military were called out, and the
volunteers were prompt at duty’s call —
though they forgot, by the way, to bring
their powder with them—a ludricious
oversight which has been a source of
laughter ever since. The outbreak
was suppressed in a few hours; the
ringleaders were placed in irons and
seven of them afterwards executed for
the crime. When the Pentridge Stock-
ade was finished, prison labor and
prison discipline, much to the relief of
this community, were transferred to
another suburb.
Very little was known of Price’s
character outside the penal establish-
ment until the murder was committed,
and then a - howl was raised by the
murderers themselves to justify the deed
of blood, that he was an intolerable
tyrant. Price owed his death to two
circumstances, viz., his utter disregard
of danger, and his love of taunting and
jeering. For instance, to one who was
reduced to a bread and water diet, he
would say, “ Don’t the wind blow cold
from the north on the bread basket, eh ?”
and to another, striving at mealtime to
deglutise a mouthful of brown bread
and a drink of cold water, “ How would
you enjoy a beefsteak with a nice yellow
selvege just now ?”
The conspiracy to murder Price was
fully organised. The prisoners con-
trived to file through their manacles to
such an extent that at a moment’s
notice they could wrench them asunder.
The time as well as the manner for his
destruction would seem- to have been

fixed, and what was afterwards believed
to have been intended for a gibbet was
found ; but he accelerated his doom by
indulging in his customary jocularity
on that fatal morning. Something of a
stinging nature that he said to one of
a gang, made him strike him with his
shovel. This was taken for the signal.
In an instant, to the astonishment of
the overseers of the gangs and the
warders, as if by magic, all the prisoners
were in possession of the use of all
their limbs, and in another instant they
were densely crowded round their
victim and showering stones upon his
head. It was but the work of a mo-
ment. Before warders and overseers
could come to his assistance, he was
mortally wounded, and died the next
evening in one of the public houses,
where he was carried. For several days
afterwards his clotted blood was to be
seen lying about. Owen Moran, one of
the overseers, was one of the fairest
men ever entrusted with convict dis-
cipline. He held his gang under such
control that not one of them joined
in the murder of Price. When one of
them said, “We may as well be in it
as not, for the warders will shoot us
down all the same.” “ No,” says Moran,
“ if you be guided by me, I’ll stand on
this heap of stones ; gather round me,
and they can’t shoot you without shoot-
ing me also.” They acted accordingly.
The result was that Moran, by sheer
moral control, kept his gang under sub-
ordination, and when all was over he
was promoted, and never was promo-
tion bestowed on a more worthy man.
Dr Geoghegan, the Roman Catholic
Vicar General, whose position brought
him in communication with Price, was
inclined to admire him as a disciplin-
arian ; he told the following anecdote
as a specimen of his administration :
“ One of the prisoners refused to work,
and instead of Price using force to
compel obedience, he ordered him to
sit on a stone, during working hours —
the insubordinate grew so weary of an
inactive existence that at length he
craved as a great favor to be permitted
to go to work.” However, Price’s name
is associated with many acts of th(
grossest cruelty, and he administered
without scruple his savage punishmenl
in the name of discipline.
Little else remains to be told. Oui
history closes two years after the arriva
of H.M.V.S. Cerberus , and one year
before the opening of the Alfred Gray
ing Dock. To attempt to deal in detai
with municipal or parliamentary matters
within our present limit would be vain
and quite beside the purpose of this
outline. The Early History of Wil
liamstown is intended to represent tht
struggles anterior to the establishmenj
of public institutions. What has since
been accomplished let the enquires
look around and see —the whole work
has been looking on, and history wil-
record all that is noteworthy in letter
of gold. ;
In 1841 all Williamstown was a cattk
and sheep run; Mr Cherry, father of tht
present member of the Wyndham Shirt
Council and of the Williamstown Rac
ing Club, held it under lease as a graz
mg area. Mr William Hall, jun., am
his brother at that time had frequentl]
to sit up through the night protecting
sheep from the inroads of wild dogs'
householders could obtain only a scant)
supply of fresh water; and Mrs Spottis
wood had to walk to Melbourne, carry
ing her son, a big boy, to purchase hin
a suit of clothes.
The people who, under such difficul
ties, laid the foundation of Williams
town are worthy of the highest praise
They should be looked upon as ex

in other enterprises, despite the scarcity

gratitude would the Williamstown resi-
dent show if, fifty years hence, he could
take the visitor to this “ flourishing

cribed it in 1840), and point out the
Cemetery for the Pioneers as the most
revered spot in the great manufacturing
city of Williamstown. Nothing would

Dampier was the first Englishman to
d in Australia; this occurred ex-
ly 200 years ago. What he wrote
the country, of the aborigines, of
* flora an d fauna, was minutely
iurate. The absolute truthfulness
all he published concerning New
•Hand has long been placed beyond
Jbt; nevertheless, during his life,
and for nearly ioo years after, his ad-
ventures were considered so extraordi-
nary and improbable, that Dean Swift
in his “ Gulliver’s Travels,” makes
his hero hail Dampier as cousin ; and
so sceptical was Swift of Dampier’s
veracity that he locates the territory of
the Lilliputians, as well as that of the
Brobdinagians, between the discoveries
of Tasman and Dampier— that is between
Hobartand Carpentaria. But Swift is not;
the only author who is indebted to Dam-
pier for incidents ; for the writer of a
still more popular, if not more wonder-
ful fiction is beholden to Dampier—
not merely for one or two incidents,
but for almost every leading incident
in the book. Dampier w T as the ship-
mate of Alexander Selkirk (the sailor)
whose story, under the name of “ The
Adventures of Robinson Crusoe,” has
delighted and captivated millions of
boys of British birth or origin, and, in
all probability, has done more to
cherish a liking for the sea and a love
of maritime adventure than any other
book ever printed. Dampier was in
the South Pacific on a buccaneering
voyage in 1705 —the name of the ves-
sel was the Cinque Ports. It is not
certain what position Dampier occupied
on board ; he was probably part pro-
prietor o.f the venture, as well as navi-
gator. Alexander Selkirk, a native of
Largo, in the county of Fife, Scotland,
was one of the crew. The voyage
was exceedingly unsuccessful—the ship
sprang a leak, and, in other respects,
became thoroughly unseaworthy. When
the vessel was in the vicinity of the


uninhabited island of Juan Fernandez,
disturbances broke out on board ; Sel-
kirk, partly on account of a dispute
with the captain, but chiefly because of
the rotten condition of the ship, re-
solved to remain on the island. He
took on shore his clothes, bedding, a
fire lock, powder, bullets, tobacco, a
knife, and a kettle; several books, in-
cluding a Bible and a case of mathe-
matical instruments. Selkirk’s sur-
mises respecting the unseaworthiness of
the ship proved to be correct, for she
foundered on her homeward voyage.
Dampier, however, with his usual good
fortune, escaped, and, after numerous
adventures, reached home in safety.
Four years and four months after leav-
ing Selkirk at Juan Fernandez, Dam-
pier was again in the South Pacific on
a buccaneering voyage as sailing master
of the Duke , from Bristol. Dampier,
no doubt, purposely made the island
of Juan Fernandez to rescue Selkirk
from his lonely habitation On the
evening of the 31st January, 1709, the
pilot sighted the island. After dark a
light was observed on shore. The
captain, under the impression that the
French were in possession, ordered the
decks to be cleared for action. At
dawn of day he stood in towards the
land, but no Frenchman could be
found. The yawl was then sent to
reconnoitre. As it approached the
shore a man was seen waving a flag;
when the boat arrived within speaking
distance, he directed the sailors, in
English, to the best landing place. He
was clad in goat’s skins from head to
foot, and presented a wild and uncouth
appearance. It was Selkirk, and the
account of his sojourn on the island
was the basis of De Foe’s delightful
story of Robinson Crusoe. George the
Third, of England, had a strong desire
to emulate King John, of Portugal, as a
patron of maritime discovery, and it is
on record that, when a very young man,
he frequently expressed his intention,
if ever he came t> the throne, of devot-
ing a portion of his revenue to that
object. When he became King he was
aeminded of his promise. He did not
send out many vessels on voyages I

most important in results being the ol

Cook. The primary object of tM

Hobson's Bay was named after Capt.
obson of His Majesty’s ship Rattle-
ake. It is situated at the northern
tremity of Port Phillip, and is capable
affording shelter to upwards of 800
ssels. The holding ground is excel-
it, the depth from three to four
thorns, over a bottom of stiff clay and
ud.
The first white men who landed at
lat is known as Williamstown, were
r Surveyor Grimes and his party in
eir survey trip round the bay. The
[lowing is an extract from the journal
this exploration round Port Phillip
itten by Mr J. Fleming, whose special
ity it was to note the agricultural
lalitiesof the country : —“Wednesday,
h Feb., 1803. —Continued to survey

mstown. The land for two or three
lies is a gentle rise from the beach
lich is muddy, or covered by large
)nes ; the land stiff clay; stones ap-
aring at top a little further nearer the
ach, a swamp, light black sand, white
ells at the bottom. There is a slip
trees about half a mile from the
beach, then a clear level plain to the
mountains, which I suppose to be
fifteen or twenty miles.” “ Friday nth
at eight o’cl ck, the captain, doctor,
self and carpenter, went on shore. We
observed a hill at a distance and made
to it; we crossed the two runs seen on
the 9th (Kororoit and Skelton Creeks).
One ends in a swamp the other salt
water where we crossed it, the country
very level, some plains stony and much
water to lodge in it in wet weather.
Went to the top of the hill, it is stony,
could see about ten miles around us a
level plain (Werribee Plains), with a
few straggling bushes. The face of the
ground is one-third grass, one ditto
stone and one ditto earth, mostly newly
burnt. Returned back nearly the same
course and found some brackish water
in one of the runs we crossed before.”
On the 12th the party were surveying
at what is now called Point Cook.
The next white man to pass over
what is now Williamstown was William
Buckley. He arrived at Port Phillip
in 1803, being one of the detachment
of pioneers intended to form a settle-
ment at that place a short time be-
fore the abandonment of the settlement
by Col. Collins, Buckley, and two
others, absconded. The three experi-
enced great difficulty in procuring food,
their chief sustenance being cockles
and mussels. One of the three left
his companions before they reached the
river at the northern extremity of the
Port (Yarra). The natives having set
fire to the grass afforded them the
means of obtaining fire which they
were afterwards careful to keep with
them. Buckley’s other companion
continued with him till they had
wandered nearly round the hay. As
they subsisted mostly on shell fish, they
kept close to the water’s edge, and
must therefore have passed over the
site of Williamstown. Somewhere about
Indented Head, Buckley’s remaining
companion left, with the intention of
returning to the Establishment and
surrendering himself to the authorities ;
but whether he or the one who had
previously left succeeded in his object

Buckley could not tell, he never saw or
heard of them afterwards. He thinks
it probable that they fell in with the
natives and were killed by them.
Continuing along the beach by him-
self he completed the circuit of the
Port, and afterwards proceeded a con-
siderable distance along the coast to-
wards and beyond Cape Otway, when
regretting the steps he had taken in
absconding, because of the precarious
life he was leading : the loneliness, the
difficulty of procuring sufficient food,
and the perpetual fear of being mur-
dered by the natives, he too resolved to
return to the Establishment. He re-
traced his steps as far as Indented Head
where he fell in with a family of the
natives, with which he continued to live
till he joined the party left by Bateman
in 1835, a period of 33 years. (Bon-
wick).
Sir William Mitchell crossed the
Murray into Phillip land (Victoria) on
the 13th June, 1836. In his account
of the journey, he says—“ We at length
discovered a country ready for the re-
ception of civilized man and fit to be-
come, eventually, one of the great
nations of the earth, unencumbered
with too much wood, yet possessing
enough for all purposes, with an exu-
berant soil under a temperate climate,
bounded by the sea-coast and mighty
rivers, and watered abundantly by
streams from lofty mountains. This
highly interesting region lay before me
with all its features new and untouched
as they fell from the hand of the Crea-
tor. Of this Eden it seemed that I
was ihe only Adam ; and, indeed, it
was a sort of Paradise to me, permitted
thus to be the first to explore the
mountains and streams, to behold the
scenery, to investigate its geological
character, and finally, by my survey, to
develop those natural advantages all
still unknown to the civilized world,
but yet certain to become, at no distant
date, of vast importance to a new
people.—Sir T. S. Mitchell, surveyor of

of Hobson’s Bay. It is sometimes
termed the antipodes of Greenwich ;
but since the true antipode is some
400 miles to the east of New Zealand,
it is at best but penantipodal, an un-
wieldly epithet, while the antipodes of
Williamstown is nowhere in England,
but in the North Atlantic. The south
extremity of the neck of land on which
the Town is built is known as Gelli-
brand’s Point, being named after a
gentleman who was among the first to
introduce stock, and who was murdered
by the blacks. The town was named
after William IV. of England, and was,
at first, designated King William’s
Town, afterwards William’s Town;
next the apostrophe was omitted;
then the initial letter of Town ceased
to be written with a capital, and
the name, condensed into one word,
assumed its present fi rm of Williams-
town. How long that will continue it
is impossible to say, for, owing to the
inveterate habit inherent in a busy
community ot clipping long words, it
is frequently writien Wins.town, which
may indeed become the recognised
form—by the vulgar, it is sometimes
termed Billstown—an obvious nick-
name. However, as Government in-
variably eschews familiar or opprobrious
appellations, that coinage will fortu-
nately never become current.
The first land sale in Port Phillip
was the largest and yet realised less
than any subsequent sale. The esti-
mated acreage was about 600,000
acres, while the price paid for the whole
was a few blankets, tomahawks, and a
small quantity of flour. This sale in-
cluded the whole of Williamstown, and
extended beyond Geelong and about
50 miles north of Melbourne. Mr
Rusden prepared a plan of the “ pur-
chase,” which is to be seen in the Pub-
lic Library. As, however, this “ sale”
was not recognised by the Government
of the day it merits merely a passing
notice.
The first government land sale was
held on the Ist June, 1837 ; the aver-
age price per lot in Williamstown was
the average price obtained at
the same sale for Melbourne lots of the
same size was
Sir Richard Bourke intended that the
future capital of the province (Victoria)
should be on the peninsula (Gellibrand’s
Point), and he accordingly caused a
township to be laid off in that locality,
which he named after His Majesty
King William, giving the name of Mel-
bourne that of his prime minister for
the time, to what he thought would be
a country village a few miles off. “It
is on or about the space where Wiliiams-
stown now stands the contract was
signed, sealed, and delivered by John
Batman on the one part, and three
royal brothers, euphoniously called
J a gg a Jagga, together with five minor
chiefs on the other.’’—(Kelly.) It is
a curious coincidence that Batman
should have singular notions. Round
the Fisherman’s Bend they glided and
up the glassy vista, all so still, so
dreamily rural, till at six miles distant
where v, the stream was broken by a
rocky ledge they filled their casks and
turned back to their vessel. That
evening Batman entering up his diary
noted : “This (Melbourne) will be the
site for a village.”—(Sutherland.)
Several eminent authorities, including
Westgrath, who arrived in Melbourne
sometime in 1840, are of opinion that
Sir Richard Bourke was right in think-
ing that Williamstown was a much more
eligible site for the commercial capital
than Melbourne. It is close to the
shipping, from which Melbourne is six
miles distant by water. Those who
decry Williamstown almost invariably
adduce as its chief defect the want of
fresh water. On the other side it is
asked “ How few large towns either in
Europe or America have a sufficient
supply of fresh water in their immediate
vicinity, so as to render them inde-
pendent of artificial means of bringing
it from a distance ?”
1 he proceeds of the first Government
land sale, had Sir Richard Bourke’s
original intention been carried out,
would have been sufficient to have sup-
plied means of providing the inhabitants
of Williamstown with a sufficient supply

of water for the first few years. But
the proceeds of that sale, and many
subsequent ones, went to Sydney.
Independent of this the money that was
spent in the transhipment and carriage
of goods from vessels in Hobson’s Bay
to Melbourne would have been more
than sufficient. Williamstown is in
many respects admirably adapted to
become the chief sea port of the
Southern Hemisphere. Melbourne as
capital and Williamstown a suburb is a
glaring instance of want of foresight and
decision on the part of local govern-
ment—qualities so essential both to
guide and to husband the energies of a
rapidly increasing population, while the
lacli of these attributes at the critical
moment will subject succeeding genera-
tions to incalculable inconvenience and
outlay. To deepen and widen the
Yarra, to drain or to fill up swamps, to
raise the banks of the Yarra to prevent
floods and the wholesale generation of
malaria, to take some of the kinks out
of a very crooked river by making a
“ new cut,” were long since admitted to
be practicable, and some of the improve-
ments are now accomplished facts. But
why were the inhabitants of the present
capital subjected to the enormous ex-
pense which these improvements imply,
when a situation was immediately
available for the erection of a great
commercial capital, presenting such a
combination of advantages for trade,
for salubrity, and for facility of construc-
tion as that of Williamstown? In all
likelihood the private interest of some
official stood in the way. 'The judici-
ous selection of the chief sea port of a
colony is a circumstance whose import-
tance can scarcely be over estimated.
The very life of a young community
consists in the imported articles of
necessity and convenience with which
it is enabled to supply itself from the
productions of older countries. Since
young colonies have m a great degree
no facilities wherewith to conduct manu-
factures of their own their energies
are usually with much greater advantage
devoted to raising largely some produce
that may be available in other markets,
and for the production of which the j
young country happens to be adapted. I
Now, the means of paying for imports j
is almost exclusively the proceeds of the !
exports. The defects of the capital |
sea port act as a two-edged sword in 5
cutting into the energies of the inhabi-'
tants ; such defects constitute an annual I
charge upon the country’s resources, I
and as surely diminish the annual supply I
of imports as if so much of the produce I
exported were annually lost or des-|
troyed. With the increase of commerce I
year by year the charge for carriage
which might have been avoided soon I
reaches an enormous amount; although!
each year perhaps less visible by the j
effect of habit and by the interests that |
have arisen in consequence, and be-f
come, as it were, vested in these diffi-l
culties. Such to a great extent is the!
case with Melbourne. In deciding!
on the site the chief recommendation!
is said to have been the immediate!
vicinity of the Yarra, in other respects!
it had decided drawbacks. The first
settlers saw the advantage of being near
the river; they did not see or did not
heed being equally near the swamp.!
A present outlay was avoided by draw-j
ing bills on the future which were ultii
mately paid with interest, the bills of
mortality. Situated six miles by the!
river course from the shipping in!
Hobson's Bay, and between these two!
points there were shallows having in ?
general only 9 feet of water at full tide. '
'The river too was so circuitous that
from no point of the compass could any!

Steamers and dredges have overcome!
these two difficulties now, but they were!
severely felt in the early days of the!
colony, causing as they did delays and
outlays, which from fhe first were con-1
stant drags, and it is only the wonder-j
ful resources of the colony that hav«
enabled her still to maintain a rapid
progress. These inconveniences were
particularly felt about the time of the,
gold discoveries and the stupendous,
increase of commerce that so promptly!

indequate, involving long and expensive
delay to shipping, and a charge equal
to a second freight upon the merchan-
dise, for on repeated occasions the
freight of the last nine miles from
London to Melbourne was as much as
the first 14,000, while the shorter pass-
age was far-less diligently accomplished.
Added to which the damage or total
less during the short river trip was more
than during the long ocean voyage.
The advantage of having fresh water
within easy reach is no doubt great,
but it is an advantage which is fre-
quently overrated, for the more rapid
the growth of the settlement the shorter
the time the water supply is available.
As with Melbourne so with other towns
similarly situated. The stream at and
below the town renders it practically
impossible to preserve its purity. Con-
sequently the supply of water for
domestic purposes to a town, the site
of which was determined on account of
the proximity of potable water must
sooner or later, and the sooner the
better, be obtained from distant source.
The history of the water supply of
Melbourne demonstrates the truth of
the foregoing. Of course the construc-
tion of the Yan Yean waterworks in the
forties was out of the question, never-
theless had Williamstown been made
the capital insteid of Melbourne, the
Yarra above the Falls would have
sufficed well into the fifties. Now as
the Yan Yean scheme was commenced
on the 26th Nov., 1853, and opened on
the 3 rst of Dec., 1857, there need have
been but little inconvenience on that
score; while the cost of conveying
imports from Hobson’s Bay to Mel-
bourne and of exports from Melbourne
to the Bay would have been more than
enough to have supplied Williamstown
with water till 1857. As it is, the heavy
death rate in Melbourne before 57 may
fairly be attributed to inhaling malarious
air from the surrounding swamps, and
imbibing polluted water from the Yarra.
The impurity of the drinking water was
a common topic of conversation in
those early days, and innumerable
Melbournites acting as their own medi-
cal advisers sought as they said to
correct it by the addition of alcohol;
a remedy, alas, which in the aggregate
proved as disastrous as the disease
itself. Williamstown too is free from
floods, a calamity to which Melbourne
is particularly liable, having during its
short existence of fifty years experiened
many, including six disastrous ones,
those 0f—1843, 1849, 1 863, t 866,
1870, and 1880. The flood of 1863 is
considered the greatest calamity to
which the colony has been subject, not
excepting even Black Thursday.
Flinders street was several feet under
water. One of the early visitors of
Melbourne has placed it on record that
he had to engage a boat to reach the
hotel at which he was to stop, and find-
ing the lower storey under water he
entered the house by the window on
the second floor, and made fast the
painter of the boat to the leg of the
table.
In the thirties there were two landing
places for stock in Port Phillip —one
was on Point Henry on the Geelong
side, the other was Gellibrand Point.
An old shepherd who was well ac-
quainted with those places at that time
says the air w’as not filled with rosy
odours, the shore being strewn with
dead carcasses. The poor pent up
animals, exhausted from confinement in
the vessels and want of water, would
rush readily into the sea to drink,
dropping and dying in heaps.
The Association’s 500 sheep arrived
in the barque Norval, Capt. Coltish, at
Point Gellibrand, 26th Oct., 1835. The
general rate of freight was 5s a head.
Roaring trade followed ; it was sheep
versus flour. A Sydney paper of the
day alluded to the dilemma : —“ The
settlers, it observes, complain of the
difficulty of getting supplies from
Launceston, as the owners of vessels
from that place to Port Phillip find the
transport of live stock more profitable
than goods.” Another trip of the Norval
was not so prosperous. Mr Ferguson as
Captain Swanston’s agent was arrang-
ing for a station to receive 1000 sheep
per Norval in Feb., 1836, chartered to
The Early History of Williamstown.


land at Point Cellibrand as before.
The owner, Mr Read, of Launceston,
is said to have had a valuable cargo of
wattle bark awaiting him in Western
Port., In his deplorable ignorance of
Victorian geography he concluded that
the two places were contiguous or
nearly so; so he sent his vessel straight
to Western Port, with orders to drive
the sheep across the Yarra. The over-
land trip through that thirsty rugged
country reduced the flock from 1000 to
75. This geographical mistake cost the
owner of the vessel

1843-4-5 were years of little progress
in Williamstown, but the exports from
Hobson’s Bay from Dec. 1845 to May
1848 were: —Wool, 24,850 bales “or

The first paper published in Victoria
was the Melbourne Advertiser, Port
Phillip, Australia, No. 1, written for and
published by John P. Fawkner, Mon-
day, January Ist, 1838, Melbourne,
Vol. Ist. On the second page of this
manuscript newspaper is the following :
“ Wanted by the Commercial World at
Williamstown and Melbourne, about 40
beacons good Ti Tree stakes, would answer
to mark the channel from the outer anchorage
to this town, whoever will perform this service
shall be entitled to public thanks.”
No. 10 of the Advertiser was printed
and contains the following notice : —•
“The undersigned beg to inform the public
that he keeps a boat and two men in readiness
for the purpose of crossing and recrossing
passengers between VVilliamscovvn and the
opposite beach. Parties from Melbourne are
requested to raise a smoke and the boat will
be at their service as soon as practicable. The
least charge is 5 shillings and 2/- each when
the number exceeds two.
H. McLEAN.
Williamstown, Feb. loth, 1838.
In 1838 the mode of telegraphing in
vogue in Williamstown was that of the
untutored savage, raising a smoke. In
less than nineteen years afterwards
Williamstown had adopted the mode of
the most advanced scientists, the electric
telegraph. In 1839 every description
of colonial property found a ready
market: sheep, cattle and horses rose
to unwonted prices; good samples of
sheep were sold at from to 10s
each; cattle from £l2 to and
ordinary saddle horses for upwards of
jQ 100 each. The fluctuations to which
live stock were liable may be seen by
the fact that in 1843 the same quality-
of stock was sold at the following
prices :—sheep, 3/6 ; cattle, 25/-, and
horses, In New South Wales
the depression was still greater than in
Victoria ; several capitalists, who came
opportunely into the field, bought up
large numbers of sheep at 1/6 each,
and it is said even as low as 9c!; cattle
were sold at 11/- each, and horses in
some instances for little more. The
failure of the crops and the death of
large numbers of live stock, caused by
three successive droughts of 1837-8-9,
raised the price of provisions im-
mensely ; the price of flour in Hobson’s
Bay was from to ton of
2000 lbs.; the 4 lb. loaf sold in Wil-
liamstown at 2/6 ; ten shillings a day
was the usual wage for a laborer;
mechanics earned from 12/- to 15/-.
House rent was very high, a four-
roomed cottage, without any pretentions
to appearance or accommodation, let
f° r x s° and even a year in
Melbourne.—(Westgarth.)
For several years after the fare from
Williamstown to Melbourne ranged
from 5/- to 10/-. There was also com-
munication with Liardit’s Beach (Sand-
ridge) by means of a small steamer, till
the Comet, in the end of 185 2, came from
The Early i ory of Williamstown•


Sydney and commenced running be-
tween Williamstovvn and Melbourne
twice daily, and afterwards commenced
running between Williamstown and
Sandridge, in conjunction with the
Hobson’s Bay railway, the first train
consisting of small open trucks and an
engine. But communication between
Williamstown and Melbourne direct
was maintained for years after Hobson’s
Bay railway was opened. In the first
number of Bradshaw’s, published May
1856, are the following advertise-
ments :

L* n those voyages from Sandridge to
Williamstown it was absolutely impos-
sible for even the captain to determine
within an hour or two when Williams-
town would be reached, for vessels had
to be called at on the way, by which
detentions were likely to occur, the
chief consolation received by the com-
plaining passengers being—“ Well, we’ll
make no call coming back.” ' The
Kangarooo supplanted the Comet , which
alter lying idle for a time was despatched
to New Zealand early in the sixties,
during the gold rush and foundered at
sea. The Gem relieved the Kangaroo
which is still used as a tug boat in the
ay, and it is high time the Gem gave
place to a couple of boats to run half
aourly trips. A trip an hour was very
well for 54, it is very slow for ’B9.
The first lighthouse at Williamstown

pointed tide surveyor at Williamstown,

, On May the 30th, it was ordered that
do vessel remain at the jetty of Mel-
s'
bourne longer than six days, and
that no one loiter after (lt
would not be amiss to revive this order,).
That no timber, &c., be left v ’. .iin 20 ft.
of the edge, and that for not more than
nine days. There was also an orde
that no wood be cut or lime burnt, the
penalty was 20/-. {lbid.) A good
many abided by the “ order” nof* to
burn lime, but nobody that could use
an axe, it wou’d appear, paid any atten
tion to the “order” not to cut wood,
further than to take precautions tha
they were not seen.
The following facts support the above
conclusion : —l. No firewood was seni:
to Williamstown. 2. There were no
gas or kerosene stoves in use at the
time, neither did the Willian»stownians
eat their food raw. 3. The growing
timber grew less and less till it vanished
entirely. The tonnage outwards in
1838 reached 17,000 tons, in 1839,
26,000.
The following were the vessels trading
between Hobart Town and Hobson’s
Bay : Siren , Domain, Tastfianian
Lass, Industry, Hetty (twice), Lady
Lranklin (twice), Adelaide (twice),
Blossom (twice), Yarra Yarra (once),
Charlotte (once), prior to 1840.
The first ship lost in Hobson’s Bay
was the Britannia from Launceston,
29th March, 1839. The sheep were
mostly saved. The first ship for
London was the Thomas Lauri, 400
bales of wool, value £6,000. The
first from London direct was the Bryan,
500 tons, 1839. —(Bonwick.)
The first vessel to open up direct
trade with the infant settlement on the
shores of Hobson’s Bay was the
Midlothian from London, arriving in
June 1839. At this time, however, the
second township in Victoria was cer-
tainly Williamstown, which even in 1837
could boast of ten houses, and it is said
to have had rather an attractive look,
its clustering cottages being bosomed*
prettily in the green forest and encircling
bush. 'I here on its wave-lapped pro-

A notable dwelling in the little cluster
was that of Captain Hugh M‘Lean, who
kept a boat with two men always in
the purpose of conveying
passengers across to the Sandridge or
Port Melbourne side of the Bay. I he
usual mode of journeying from Mel-
bourne to Williamstown in those times
was tocrossthe Yarra in a boat with a line
stretched across the river opposite the
Custom House, then to follow the sandy
track walled on either hand by the
dense tea tree scrub, and so to that
silent wilderness which is now Sandridge.
On the verge of that beach then lapped
by crystal waters the traveller had to
light a fire with the boughs and
branches of the ti-tree, and when the
smoke became visible across the blue
expanse in Williamstown Captain
McLean’s boat would come dancing
over the ripples with a couple of boat-
men to take him on board and land
him at the little port.
There was plenty for the ferry to do
for Melbourne with its 200 houses and
its 400 or 500 people—the metropolis of
a population of about 3-000 people, and
with fully half its traffic carried on
through Williamstown. A large num-
ber of the vessels which traded to Port
Phillip avoiding the necessity of cross-
ing the bar, and following the tedious
river windings that led to Melbourne;
so they anchored where the floating
dock is and near about. —(Southerland.)
At the close of 1839 there were 30
vessels in the aggregate arrived from
various British dominions. Ihe fat
stock of Australia Felix had in 1839
begun regularly to enter the Van
Dieman’s Land market, and in
the importation of both sheep and
cattle to Port Phillip ceased.
On Saturday, 23rd October, 1841, the
Sea-horse steamer from Sydney, having
on board his Excellency, accompanied
by his aide-de-camp and private secretary
arrived in Hobson’s Bay. The Go-
vernor landed at Williamstown at ten
o’clock, and examined the public budd-
ings and government works in and
around the place.
18423-4 were dreary for Williams-
town and the colony at large. Losses
in business from bad debts, together
with the depreciation of property, J
beggared many hitherto wealthy people, |
a perceptible gloom overspread the
population ; mutual credit and con-1
fidence were for a time nearly at an
end, and commercial operations were
restricted to a very narrow channel.
The banks and other monetary institu-
tions in Melbourne were the principal
sufferers, and for years after were en-,
gaged in an arduous struggle to extricate'
their capital from the scene of confusion
that prevailed around them. The fall
in the price of wool too which!
continued till the middle of 1843
was assigned as one of the chief (
causes of the wide-spread distress ; but ,
the fall in the price of Australian staple
commenced in 1837, and steadily
continued through all the extravagant
prosperity of the colonists. Speculation |
was no doubt the chief cause of the ,
commercial depression. The incessant!
commotion which a time of speculation ,
exhibits, combining with employments
of undoubted utility, bears a close re-.
semblance to historical fictions founded (
on facts— it is diffiult to separate the ,
fact from the fiction. Ihe illiterate in ,
reading such books may flatter
selves that they are learning history; (
and the novice in business-—and for.
that matter the veteran too who has (
“lost his head” by becoming dizzy m]
the vortex of Speculation —may hug,
the delusion of thinking that he is (
doing legitimate business. It is
species of buying or building castles in,
the air—which if not sold results in|
loss to the buyer or builder, and if sole j
in a loss to the purchaser. The rapid,
rise of value in the frequent change 01,
ownership of property in speculative
transactions is frequently imaginary
but the expenses of buying and selling t
are always real; lawyers, auctioneers,,

have to be paid; he too, whose*

exceedingly apt to increase his personal,
expenditure also: consequently when,

unremunerative all these expenses
diminish the capital of the speculator,
or of his creditors.
Governor Gibbs, in one of his
despatches, significantly intimates with
relation to the state of the times that
the country was strewn over with
empty champagne bottles. This wine
was largely consumed ; and for a long
period a “ champagne lunch” was
quite indispensable to an auction sale
of any pretentions. There is a well-
known story of two bullock drivers
who, at a country public house on their
way to town, called for a dozen of
champagne, which they first emptied
, into a bucket and then deliberately
drank off out of their tin pannikins.
So much for the extravagance of the
times, which had to be suddenly
curtailed.
The young colony was too vigorous
to be permanently crippled by these
: misadventures, disastrous as they un-
’ doubtedly were. The Insolvent Court
settled many otherwise hopeless claims.
’A Londoner who arrived in ’52 was
. surprised to see that gold and silver
coins were the only ones in common
: use; on asking a solicitor the reason he
1 replied, “ Oh, the copper currency is
’ exclusively confined to the payment
’ of dividends in the insolvent estates.”
r Colonists freed from the mill-stone of
’ debt started afresh. A series of good
I harvests gave the people heart; labor
= was in demand; and just then the
: discovery was made that sheep, which
J for some time past had been worth little
’more than the wool, had yet another
| value which was obtained by the melting
| pot: thenceforward boiling down was
regarded as a safety-valve against the
'recurrence of a similar commercial
e catastrophe. Wool too rose in value,
and prosperity once more smiled on
The people. Boiling down which

operative; for the immense quantities
II of double rose Cork butter imported in
e 1 853-4-5 became such a drug in the
market that although it sold retail in
’54 for 3s 6d a pound, in ’57 and
’SB many thousands of kegs were sold
by auction at a farthing a pound, re-
shipped to Liverpool, and converted
into anti-friction grease—in which guise
many a ton, no doubt, returned to
Hobson’s Bay.
In 1839 a boat jetty was completed,
but has been several times lengthened.
The oldest inhabitants state that in
these remote times, before the ap-
pearance of the first newspaper, the
publication of notices and advertise-
ments was accomplished by nailing
them to the trunk of a she-oak that
grew where the “fountain” now stands.
The Trade Circular was the first paper
published in Williamstown, and then
the Chronicle appeared in 1854, and
the Advertiser in 1874.
In 1840 Williamstown contained 50
buildings, including three public houses
(Woolpack, Albion and Ship), one
mercantile store (Langhorn Brothers),
and two small retail shops ; a small pier
for the accommodation of ship’s boats ;
and a recently-erected lighthouse for
the direction of vessels navigating the
bay at night. A well, which con-
tributed greatly to the comfort of the
inhabitants, was sunk by mutual sub-
scriptions. The office of the Harbor
Master (Capt. Lewis), the Boarding
and Customs officer, and the pilots of
the port and river, were stationed at
this town. A signal station was in the
course of formation, and it was con-
templated to appoint an assistant
magistrate for the due regulation of its
municipal economy. For ten years
Williamstown made but little progress ;
for in 1846 there were only 126 houses
(30 per cent, of which were empty),
with a population of 322 —172 males
and 150 females.
Williamstown was a very small place
when the gold fever attacked the
people in 1851. Then the men joined
the general rush to the diggings ; and
as the town was little, it did not take
long to empty —that is of men ; the
women —who were called “ grass
widows” —and children were for the

most part left behind. Some of the
few shopkeepers really did on that
occasion sell off at an alarming sacrifice;
mechanics dropped their tools as
though they were hot, and shouldered
their swags; the lawyers left their clients
to settle their own differences; doctors
deserted their patients —and the change
of treatment seemed to meet the re-
quirements of the sick, for several of
them improved so rapidly that they
were able to follow their medical
advisers, not with the intention of
consulting them further on the state of
their health, but as competitors in the
acquisition of wealth. So many young
fellows gave up book-keeping to go to
the diggings that some are of opinion
it gave origin to the saying, “ he has
forsaken the pen for the pick.” They
did not all get gold, but many of them
were soon satisfied either with the gold
they found or that there was too much
labor attached to the process of
separating the yellow metal from the
muddy matrix. The latter class soon
returned to their homes and resumed
their original callings ; and though this
is thirty-seven years ago there are many
in the town able to say, “ just my case.”
The rapid influx of shipping first
from the neighbouring colonies then
from Europe and America, with their
crowds of passengers, materially altered
the aspect of affairs in Williamstown.
Public works were soon commenced
which permanently improved the place,
and which will be dealt with in chrono-
logical order.
A store in Williamstown in the
digging days was very unlike one of the
shops in the “front” to-day. There were
no plate-glass fronts then, and for that
matter very few glass windows of any
kind. Neither would the quality of
the goods then procurable bear favour-
able comparison with those so tastily
displayed at the present time at the
shops in Nelson Place. What, how-
ever, the merchandise of yore lacked in
quality it made up for in variety. Larger
stores, with respect to what they had
on sale, were rough epitomes of a row
of modern places of business —a sort of
Mcßobert-cum- Rodger-cum- Blackett-]
cum-Craig rolled into one, and con-'
siderably soiled and crumpled in the.
process of rolling. A flagstaff wasi
deemed an essential adjunct to a store in (
those times, with a flaunting flag]
emblazoned with a kangaroo, emu, or.
other equally appropriate device ; for,
the Australian flag proper had not then,
been invented. Those stores were neither (
English, Scotch, nor Irish, but rather]
a combination of the three with a strong]
infusion of the Yankee. There were
picks and shovels, American axes, nestsi
of tubs and buckets with tin hoopsi
(made expressly for sale and not fon
use, since one week’s rust was sufficient'
to oxidate the whole of the metal used;

occasion in 1852 Williamstown was
without fresh water. In those days our
fellow townsman, Mr Peter Power,
was the possessor of a horse, dray and
barrel; he traversed the plains for a
distance of seven miles before he dis-
covered a supply of the precious fluid.
There were holes containing water
somewhat muddy, and others with
water as clear as cystal; Mr Power
chose the clear. When he got back a
score of women were waiting to fill
their kettles, and they all soon had
their tea made; but nobody could
drink it, for the water was strong, being
impregnated with alum ; potable water

The first vessel that took gold from
Hobson’s Bay was the Hondurus ,
which left on 29th August, 1851, for
London with eighteen ounces of gold ;
the second one —the Melbourne , which
sailed on 22nd December —took
54,000; while the £agle on 30th
August, 1852, took ounces.
Many were the attempts to get gold
without digging for it, or even taking a
journey to the gold fields. The follow-
ing episode is deemed relevant to the
subject, as one of the actors, though a
decidedly unwilling one, is an old and
respected townsman : —“ At an early
hour on the morning of 22 nd April,
1852, two boats with muffled oars, con-
taining twenty-two men with blackened
faces to prevent recognition, and fully
armed, proceeded from the beach at
Sandridge to the barque Nelson , which
was lying off the lighthouse at Williams-
town. The vessel had recently arrived
from Geelong, and was bound for Lon-
don. She had on board 23 packages
of gold, containing 8,183 ounces.
Notwithstanding the large amount of
treasure no watch was kept, so that the
robbers succeeded in boarding her and

securing two men and a boy, who were
in the forecastle before they could raise
any alarm. Having dispersed them-
selves over the vessel, some went aft
and seized the chief officer and a friend,
whb, together with the carpenter, were
sleeping in the cabin, whilst others em-
ployed themselves in throwing over-
lioard all the small arms within their
reach, as well as the swivel-gun mounted
on the poop deck. Mr Draper (now
Pilot Draper) -the chief officer, received
a slight wound on the thigh from a shot
fired by one of the robbers before they
succeeded in overpowering him, which
however, they soon did, and having
lashed their hands, the thieves com-
menced plundering the lazarette where
the gold was stored, and of the position
of which they appeared to be well ac-
quainted. Capt. Wright, the com-
mander of the vessel, was ashore, and
seven only of the crew remained on
board. The thieves having secured the
treasure of which they were in search,
deposited it in the boats; they then
took the precaution before quitting the
vessel of imprisoning all hands in the
lazarette, Where it is difficult to tell how
long they might have remained had
they not been released by a sea-
man who, in the confusion that ensued
in the early part of the fray, succeeded
in secreting himself, and who emerged
from his hiding place when well assured
of the departure of the assailants. As
soon as Mr Draper was released from
his confinement he proceeded to Wil-
liamstown and gave information to the
proper authorities of what had occurred.
The Harbor Master’s and water police
boats were immediately manned and
endeavoured to overtake the plunderers,
but the police could discover nothing
till daylight, when they found one of
the boats half-a-mile from the beach
towards - St. Kilda. They also dis-
covered what they took to be the
wheel tracks of the conveyance that
took away the booty ; another boat was
found on the beach of Williamstown
(3rd April, 1852.)” Mr Combie, in his
history of the colony says, “ No resis-
tance was attempted, and the boxes of
gold were handed over the side of thfj
ship into the boat, the villains remarl
ing that ‘ it is the best diggins we hav|
ever met with.’ ” The perpetrators <?
this daring act very nearly eluded th*
vigilance of the police ; they had landel
the booty on the beach, and a trader i 1
Melbourne went out with money, in hi
gig, and bought the gold at 30s a J
ounce, and had it secured early in th
morning of the occurrence. He wen*

prisoners confessing to the counsel wh'
defended them the manner in whic*
they got rid of the spoil; no criming
prosecution was ever instituted, as th
secret was divulged in confidence on th 1
principle of telling the lawyer the wholU
truth, letting him tell the lies afterward?
Four men named John Jones, Jamej
Morgan, James Duncan, and Johf
Roberts were indicted for the offenc
and found guilty after a lengthy trial.

a wise, brave, and praiseworthy resolu-
tion donned the jumper and laced-up

odorous of Aitkinson, and puffed their
cigars in a dainty fashion calculated to
reprove the vulgar, vigorous style of
fumography of the othdr passengers ;
but with all their nonchalance, they
did not appear at their ease, looking as

about a mile of the city its northern
bank was lined with an unbroken chain
of slaughter-houses and fellmongery
establishments, which filled the circu-
mambrint air with the most sickening
odours that were prevented from
stagnating by huge dropsical-looking
pigs that kept wallowing in the decom-
posing offal. Prodigous rats also
patronised that quarter seemingly di-
vested of that suspicious timorousness
which characterises their genus in most
other countries. When at our destina-
tion the boat was made fast to a
weather-worn stake, not improbably
the identical one which John Pasco
Fawkner drove into the virgin soil of
the Yarra bank to moor his litt\e
barque the Enterprise on Sunday, the
21st August, 1835. About two months
after the cession of the territory to
John Batman, whose police the
Sydney natives —informed Mr Fawkner
and his associates “that their master
was king of Port Phillip, and having
purchased the land thereabout warned
all trespassers to keep aloof.” We
managed to land somehow without
leaving our boots as hostages in the
mud, but it was a matter of impossi-
bility—they would have it —for the
three swell gentlemen to get ashore
without a gangway; however, as there
was no such article of nautical furniture
aboard the Flying Fish , they had no
alternative but to follow suit. When
they got on terra finna and stamped
the mud off their nice boots, one of
them, looking about with an air of
ineffable horror, drawlingly accosted a
bystander, “ Tom, do you desire a
job?” “What sort?” “Just to carry
a carpet bag r “ Will it want two to
carry it?’ “No!” “Then take it
yourself!” was the cool reply, which
ended the colloquy. (Kelly.)
A story is told regarding the state of
the streets in the early days, A pas-
senger meandering along the very in-
distinct outline of a footpath perceived
a hat a little to one side of his way
lying in the mud. On lifting up the
hat a head appeared beneath, and now
plainly emerged from the miry surface.
A helping hand was promptly tendered
but the offer was met by a shake of tb
head and intimation that more ai
sistance was indispensable, as there wa
a horse also in the case occupying
still lower stratum. Whenever th
occurred it must have been before th
birth of the writer of this essay, bi
she has frequently heard old resident
of Williamstown and Footscray warml
debating which was the muddier of tb
two. Both freely admitted that fc
pedestrians to lose their boots in tb
mud was an every-day occurrence i
wet weather. The chief contentio
appeared to be in which town could
person more easily get out ot his dept

of the Gem Pier, as it was absolutel
impracticable to go the whole distanc

forming the spring of the arch on one
side, my head firmly fixed in my hat,
which was still more firmly fixed in the
mud, on the other. With a violent
effort, possible only to well-developed
extensors and flexors, I extricated
myself and reached the solid ground.
I do not wish to imply that there was
any danger, for at no time was I out of
my depth, but it was decidedly un-
comfortable. Arrived at last at the
door of the Institute I felt for a scraper,
but that essential appendage to every
Williarnstown establishment was too
deeply embedded in mud for me to
reach. However, I stamped my feet
on the upper step till I freed myself
from the heaviest clumps of mud, and
entered the passage intending to make
myself presentable with the aid of the
door mat. The place usually occupied
by that adjunct to every well-regulated
establishment was usurped by what
appeared to be four feet by three of the
slimiest substance in creation
The foregoing may be an exaggeration,
but anything approaching such an ad-
venture in this town, thanks to
McAdam and asphaltum, is now abso-
lutely impossible.
The immense impetus given to mari-
time matters in Victoria, consequent
on the gold discoveries of 1851,
demonstrated the imperative necessity
of providing an authorised and reliable
source from which correct local time
could be obtained for ascertaining the
errors and rates of ships’ chronometers,
and a recognised establishment to
which masters of vessels could refer
with confidence for testing, adjusting,
or safe custody of their nautical instru-
ments generally. To meet these re-
quirements the Government of the day
decided on the establishment of an
Observatory at Williarnstown ; and on
July, 1853, appointed Mr R. L. J. Ellery
to organise and permanently superin-
tend it. Upon commencing his duties
that gentleman found that several pre-
liminary arrangements had been already
made; a “time ball” had been erected
on Gellibrand’s Point, some instru-
ments ordered from England, a site for
the Observatory selected, and a sum of
money (j£ 2800) placed on the supple-
mentary estimates for the erection of a
suitable building. Ml
A public time signal was commenced
in August, 1853, by dropping a ball on
the Williarnstown Flagstgti at one
o’clock local time every day. 1 his
signal used to be watched from the
Melbourne Flagstaff, about four and a
half miles direct distant, with the aid of
a telescope ; and a ball was dropped
there also as nearly as possible at the
same instant as that at Williarnstown
a precision sufficiently accurate for all
ordinary purposes. The observations
for obtaining true local time were at
first made with the sextant, artificial
horizon and chronometer; the geo-
graphical position assumed being that
given to Gellibrand’s Point by Capt.
Stokes of H.M. surveying ship Beagle ,
viz,, lat. 37°52'5 2 "> lon S- 9 h - 39 m - 425.
A 20-inch transit instrument and the
works of a good astronomical clock
were obtained, and mounted in a small
building erected for them. In June,
185 4, a second kind of time signal was
adopted; it consisted in eclipsing the
light of the lighthouse on Gellibrand
Point every night at two minutes to
eight, and suddenly exposing it at eight
o’clock; its re-appearance affording a
most precise and striking signal, which
could be observed from long distances
and from positions where the time-ball
was shut out by a crowd of masts. The
for the erection of an Observa-
tory voted by the Legislature early in
1854, for reasons never publicly stated,
was not expended and the vote lapsed.
At the close of 1854 the first line of
electric telegraph in Australia, from
Williarnstown to Melbourne, was com-
pleted, and the Williarnstown terminus
placed under the management of Mr
Ellery in connection with his astrono-
mical duties. The Observatory and
lines were connected by wire, and the
time-ball apparatus received from
England having been erected on
the tower of the Telegraph Office in
Melbourne, was dropped simul-

eously with that of Williamstown and
Geelong.
A small Observatory, consisting of
two chambers, was built contiguous to
the Telegraph Office, to which the
instruments were removed. The 25-
inch transit was replaced by one 45-inch
focus (by Trough ton and Simms),
which was mounted on stone piers in
the' new building. An altazimuth
instrument with 18-inch circles by the
same makers was also obtained about
this time, and placed in a revolving
chamber near the Observatory. The
site occupied by the Observatory was a
part of the low spit which terminates at
Gellibrand’s Point, and although low,
the transit room floor being only about
eleven feet above the level of the sea,
it was in the midst of an open space of
ground partially covered with trees,
partly surrounded by the water of the
harbor, and free from any other build-
ings, The work of the Observatory
until July, 1858, had been almost ex-
clusively confined to observations for
the regulation of time, observations of
the moon and moon-culminating stars,
for the determination of the longitude
and of zenith distance of known stars
with the altazimuth, with a view to de-
termination of latitude.
In 1858 the Government decided
upon adopting a comprehensive system
of survey of the lands for settlement,
involving the laying out of meridians
and parallels and the subdivision of the
geographical degree; such a survey
demanded a large amount of as-
tronomical work, and Mr Ellery was
appointed to undertake its direction,
which necessitated his relinquishing all
future charge of the Telegraph Depart-
ment, now rapidly expanding. The
instruments possessed by the Observa-
tory were quite inadequate to meet the
requirements arising out of the prosecu-
tion of such a survey, so the Legislature
shortly after voted a sum of money for
the purchase of a transit circle, zenith
sector, clock and other appliances,
which were at once ordered from Lon-
don. In August, 1859, a chronographic
apparatus was added to the appliances
of the establishment. In iB6O the
building was enlarged by the addition
of a commodious computing room and
a chamber for using a transit instru-
ment in the prime vertical. Another
chamber with heavy stone pieces for the
reception of the transit circle was
also made. The transit circle and its
collimators arrived in August, 1861,
and were at once mounted in their
places. A chronographic apparatus
by Siraens and Halske, of Berlin, an
Airy’s zenith sector, a 5-foot equitorial
of 4 inches aperture, and a sidereal
clock by Frodsham, were also obtained
during the next two years. The
equitorial was placed in a building
specially prepared for it a little to the
south of the main building, but within
the grounds, and consisted of a circular
chamber of ten feet diameter, sur-i
rounded by a revolving dome rolling
on eight cannon balls. The zenith,
sector was erected in the room origin-
ally occupied by the 45-inch transit on
a pier built for it upon the foundation
course of the old transit piers. The
available horizon on the meridian is
from about 48° north decimation to
30° polar distance below the pole south.;
The south pole star ( sigma octantis ) is
within 43' of the celestial pole, but
being only of the sixth magnitude is*
exceedingly difficult to find without
fixed instruments. The zodical light is
occasionally very bright in the evening,!
generally most brilliant on those nights
immediately preceding or following
conjunction of the moon. Although
the site occupied by the Observatory
was at first in many respects a good one,
being sufficiently distant from town to
secure ordinary quietude and freedom
from smoke and dust, and commanding
an open and extensive horizon, the
gradual encroachment of the town upon
the hitherto unoccupied land surround-j
ing the building, the construction of
line of railway having its terminus at
Gellibrand’s Point, and the subsequent
erection of large workshops, within 1,000
feet of the transit instrument, combined
to render the situation in all respects
unfitted for an Observatory, The
The Early History of Williamstown,


necessity therefore of selecting a more
appropriate site was urged upon the
Government. The Legislature voted
the requisite funds ; the erection of the
new Observatory was commenced in
1861 and completed early in 1863. In
June the Williamstown Observatory was
dismantled, and the whole of the in-
struments and appliances removed to
the new building, now known as the
Melbourne Observatory, with which
this essay is not concerned.
The roundabout routes of river or
rail by which communication is main-
tained between Melbourne and Wil-
liamstown are a most serious drawback
to the latter. These routes are, by
rail miles, by river, in the olden
times, nine, while the distance in a
straight line is but four miles, less than
half the longest. No other suburb is
so heavily handicapped. The grievous
burden has long been felt by the peo-
ple of this town, and strenuous efforts
were made by the Borough Council for
its removal. A commendable attempt
was the formation of a new road named
after its 'promoter —Clough’s Short
Road. But owing to the neglect of
that portion under the control of the
Sandridge Council it is a comparative
failure; as every attempt at co-opera-
tion with that borough will be. The
carriers are converts to the Italian pro-
verb, La pere lunga sirada h la pin
prossima a casa (the longest way round
is the shortest way hdme), for the drift
sand is allowed to lie so deep on the
metal road that the whee's rarely
touched the formed road; for all practi-
cal purposes the carters might as well
toil over the unformed sandy track,
consequently they prefer the longer
but harder road. Sandridge is too
jealous of Williamstown to help her in
any way. When a direct road is made
from Williamstown to Melbourne —
whether it be by rail, tram, or M‘Adam,
by draw-bridge or by tunnel —it will
not be with the assistance of the resi-
dents of Sandridge, through whose
land a portion of the road must pass
in spite of their most strenuous opposi-
tion. The Harbor Trust will favor
Sandridge. It is deemed good policy
to pit Sandridge against Williamstown
even at the cost of a new pier or two.
Sandridge is not feared, Williams-
own is.
Two hundred years ago it was the
custom for captains going long voy-
ages to take pilots with them. These
pilots were not quite so intimately
acquainted with the shape of the
places they visited as Mark Twain
tells us the Mississippi pilot had to be.
In course of time the captain and the
pilot were combined in one person.
Such was the state of affairs in the
early days of this colony. However,
as the place grew in importance, so also
grew up a pilot service, not indeed of
sailing masters, who went the whole
voyage in the vessel, but of sailors who
boarded ships inward bound/mtside the
Heads and brought .them up the Bay,
and who also took vessels outward
bound from their moorings down the
Bay and left them a mile or two outside
the Heads. This service was a small
affair until the year 1852, when the
large and sudden increase in the num-
ber of vessels arriving at the Heads
rendered necessary an increase in the
number of pilots. The Government of
the day advertised for competent men.
A staff of pilots was formed at a fixed
salary. This continued for about two
years, when the Government, to avoid
the loss entailed by the maintenance
of the service under salaries, abolished
the system and allowed the pilots to
carry on for their own profit, but at
their own risk.
In September, 1854, the Govern-
ment established the new service under
the management of the Pilot Board.
The .pilots purchased the schooner
Anonyma, and the cutter Corsair for
the service. In 1865 the Anonyma
was totally lost outside the Heads in a
heavy gale; the pilots and crew saving
their lives. The schooner Ptospetine
was purchased and altered at a cost of
about ,£3,000, to replace the Anonyma.
The pilots also ordered the schooner
Rip to be built for them. The total
cost of this vessel was £4,400. In
The Early History of Williamstoicn.


1874 the cutter Corsair , while beating
through the Heads in a gale of wind,
was driven upon Point Nepean, and
became a total wreck. No lives were
lost on this occasion. The schooner
yacht Mavis replaced the Corsair , also
at a cost of more than £4,000, About
1869 the ship Palm Tree ran into the
schooner Rip and damaged her to the
extent of £1,400. On July 15th,
1873, at nine o’clock in the morning,
the Rip , with Pilots Reid, Best,
M'Kenzie, O’Neil, and Caught, left her
mooring to take up her position on the
cruising ground. A strong south-west
gale was blowing, and the tide being
half ebb there was consequently a heavy
“ rip” on. The schooner was kept
dodging off and on till the tide should
ease; about eleven o’clock an attempt
was made to pass through the “ Rip.”
When nearly a mile out a heavy sea
struck the boat, throwing her on her
beam ends, carrying away the main
mast, and washing James Mar (seaman)
over with it. After being struck with
another sea she righted, when a sea
broke on board and swept the decks
clean. Shortly after a heavy sea broke
on board and carried Pilot M'Kenzie and
two seamen (Wells and Classon) over-
board. Wells had been severely wounded
before and was weak from loss of blood.
After a fearful struggle, with the boat
full of water, the remainder got inside the
Heads, and the life boat went to their
assistance. All the survivors were in-
jured more or less. When the Rip was
brought to Williamstown for repairs it
was visited by hundreds of people. All
the fittings were broken up into mere
chips as though they had been passed
through a cane crushing mill. Some
said that the tables, seats, bunks,
lockers, partitions, &c., must have been
chopped up with a tomahawk, and it
certainly seemed as though the timber
had been subjected to some such treat-
ment •, but who was to do it in the time ?
The boat was away from her moorings
but a few hours, during which interval
all on board had plenty to do without
chopping wood. We might have had a
fuller account of the disaster had one
of these sceptics been on board during
that trip. The general public subscribed
nearly £4OOO for the widows and
children of the deceased men.
The old Pilot Board ceased to exist
at the close of 1888. A Marine Board
has been established. One of the
early acts of the recently-appointed
Marine Board may be accepted as
indictaive of the desire to diminish the
expenses incurred by vessels frequent-
ing this port —by reducing what some
deem the heavy pilot dues —an action
that will be regretted by several, for
while benefiting the shipping interest
it is calculated to injure, though to a
smaller extent, the town, seeing how
liberal the pilots are in disbursing a
portion of their large earnings. Those
who wish the pilot dues to remain as
at present contend that the pay should
be good on account of the required
ability. Those who desire a reduc-
tion maintain that while the pay should
be good there is no necessity for it to
be enormous ; that there are hundreds
of able men working for half, and less
than half; that in fact the money
earned by the pilots closely approxi-
mates the salary of a County Court
judge. The writer of this essay has
simply to state facts, and does not per-
sume to express an opinion on the
question.
The Council of Williamstown was
incorporated on 12th March, 1856, and
in three years expended in public works
£26,528. The income during the
same period was ,£26,644 £5>3 22 °f
which was collected from rates. There
were then fifty-two streets in the town
measuring 15 miles 40 chains, and of
these 4 miles 15 chains were made.
The length of paths formed and metal-
led with pitchers was miles. The
valuation of the town property for as-
sessment was £69,366 1 os, and the
number of rateable properties, 1,542.

bourne and Williamstown railway
opened.

id of two stone piers and two
den wharfs, one of which formed
terminus of the Melbourne and
[iamstown railway, and was 1,200
: long by 58 feet in breadth, and
able of berthing the largest vessels
at. Up to 1852 Williamstown was
e more than a depot for government
;ers, whose avocations rendered it
r necessary place of abode; then
houses could be counted from the
>s in the Bay. But in ’59 there
e numerous stores, spacious hotels,
rches, chapels, villas, and town resi-
ces. There was a resident magistrate

aicipal council, &c. Court houses had

ire were then two branch banks,
bor, pilot and immigration offices,
toms house and post office, in a
ted building in Cole street, (Mr R.

sss the railway. There was a well-
It fort at Point Gellibrand, capable
nounting twelve heavy guns.

vessels over 600 or 700 tons when
naged under water, either had to
art to the expensive and precarious
de of heaving down first on one side

had to proceed to Sydney or India
the purpose of having these repairs

aller patent slip in course of erection
I private enterprise, calculated to
il up vessels of one thousand tons
1 under. This was first undertaken
Mr Isbister, and then by Mr Robert
ight. Mr Legg constructed a slip
posite the English church. The only
ating dock in Victoria was at Wil-
tnstown, with a, capacity of seven
hundred tons. The Government
Marine Board was situated between
Ann street wharf and the Old Pier (now
called the Gem Pier), It covers two
acres of ground ; contains commodious
workshops for boat builders, black-
smiths, and lampmakers, also sheds
where boats buoys and beacons required
for the government service throughout
the colony are built and repaired
repairs to the lighting apparatus of the
various lighthouses and lightships
throughout the colony effected; and
all marine stores deposited by the
different contractors, tested, assorted
and shipped hence as required by the
various harbors, lighthouses and marine
stations throughout Victoria. What
used to be done at the Marine Yard is
now performed at the Patent Slip Yard.
The places of public worship consisted
of two substantial stone edifices belong-
ing to the Wesleyans and the Roman
Catholics, two iron buildings the
property of the Episcopalians and
Congregationalists and a wooden build-
ing temporarily used by the Presby-
terians. The Episcopalians and Roman
Catholics erected ministers’ resi-
dences contiguous to their respective
churches, and the Presbyterians built
a brick manse on the Government
site where they originally contemplated
erecting a substantial church. There
were denominational schools attached
to the Presbyterian, Roman Catholic
and Episcopalian Churches. A
national school had recently been
opened, and there were various private
schools for boys and for girls. The
Bank of Australasia and the English,
Scottish, and Australian Bank, and four
insurance companies had branch
offices in the town. The first bank in
Williamstown was started in 1856, in
Thompson street —the building is now
the Court House hotel. The Bank of
Australasia first started about iB6O, in
an iron building, which is now the Lord
Clyde hotel. The only place of public
amusement was the Mechanics’ Insti-
tute, where lectures, concerts and
theatrical representations by amateurs
took place. The town covered an area

of four square miles, and consisted of
three divisions : Williamstown Proper,
South Williamstown, and New Town or
North Williamstown. Generally speak-
ing the town is well laid out. (Fairfax).
It would, however, have been a great
economy of space if every allotment
except the corner ones had been rec-
tangular instead of as at present rhom-
boidal. The Government is not to
blame for the allotments north of Fergu-
son street as the township proper did
not go further northward. North of
Ferguson street was sold in large lots
of 80 to 119 acres, and their length was
100 feet from high water mark to the
Melbourne road ; such blocks extended
from Ferguson street to near Stoney
creek.
On the 25th of January, 1865, the
Shenandoah , or Sea King as she was
originally called, arrived in Hobson’s
Bay. Her registered tonnage was 1200
and horse power 240, and she carried
eight heavy guns. Previous to her ar-
rival she had sunk or destroyed twelve
merchant ships, whose captains were on
board the Shenandoah , as prisoners of
war, and she also had on board all
these ships’ valuables, including chrono-
meters, &c. She remained in Hobson’s
Bay twenty-two days, and during this
period was visited by many thousands
of people. Captain Waddel said that
his ship needed repairs, so she was al-
lowed to go on the patent slip at Wil-
liamstown. The Graving Dock was
not then built, and while she was on
the slip a rumor gained currency that a
number of men from Melbourne had
joined her. Government sent down a
strong body of police to search the
vessel, but the Shenandoah's officers
would not allow the police to go aboard.
Acting under instructions from the
Chief Secretary, Mr McCulloch (now
Sir James), steps were taken to prevent
the ship being launched, and she was
kept on the stocks till the demands of
the police were complied with. Several
men who had joined were caught and
taken off the vessel, and the Govern-
ment gave orders for the vessel to be
floated on condition that she was to
leave the port within twenty-four hoi)
The Shenandoah was launched in |

In 1856 meetings were called in
plliamstown to form the place into a
unicipality under an act just passed,
■here was considerable opposition
jsed by those who objected to be
|xed, the good sense of the majority,
prevailed, and the munici-
ility was brought into existence in
arch, 1856. Seven councillors were
ected. The following are the names,
e order being in accordance with
eir positions on the poll Messrs
ewart, Mason, Armstrong, Verdon,
oxham, Maclean, and Langford. Mr
ason was elected first chairman of
e Council. Williamstown is now

11864, when the act provided for the
tcration of name of municipality to
at of city, town, or borough, accord-
g to income and population with
ne councillors with a mayor, a new
action took place which resulted in
e return of the following councillors :
essrs Mason, Courtis, McCallum,
|wer, Clough, Franklin, Bowman,
lonradi, and Call. Mr Inglis being
lairman of the Council, when the
teration took place, became first
ayor. When municipalities were
■fit formed, a conference of repre-
sentatives from all the districts was
inaugurated for the purpose of making
suggestions for the better working ot
the act. At the first meeting Williams-
town was honored by having its repre-
sentative, Mr Verdon, elected chairman;
that gentleman also represented the
colony as Agent-general in England.
Williamstown is indebted to Sir George
Verdon for the early laying on of the
Van Yean. A resolution was made in
the Legislative Assembly for the water
pipes to be extended to Williamstown,
but it was lost. As the law stood the
service of the Yan Yean was restricted
to Melbourne and suburbs. Sir
George Verdon, with the aid of Sir
Archibald Michie, who was then
Attorney-general, by including Wil-
liamstown in the suburban radius,
accomplished his end. The names
of Chairmen of the Council and
Mayors since the inauguration of the
municipality are : —Messrs Mason,
Stewart, Freyer, Inglis, Courtis, Bow-
man, Power, * Goble, Morgan (2),
Aitkens, Pearson, Knight, Stark,
Challis, Hopkins, Hick, and the
present occupant of the seat, Councillor
Craig.
The following is the list of names
of members who have represented
Williamstown in the Legislative Assem-
bly since we have enjoyed the privilege
of returning one : —Mr T. F. L. Foster,
who was made the scapegoat of the
Ballarat riots, and whose grandfather was
speaker in the Irish House of Com-
mons ; Captain Perry, who is also one
of the present candidates, 1859; Mr
(now Sir) George Verdon followed in
1861 ; Mr Mason, then the late Mr A.
T. Clark, and now Mr Mirams.
The Post-office clock of Melbourne,
which is a splendid piece of work, was
entirely made at the Williamstown rail-
way workshops, from designs by Mr
Ellery. Mr Houghton was then.super-
intendent of the works, and the special
undertaking was entrusted by Mr
Houghton chiefly to Mr Stinton, now
in a similar position to that then held
by Mr Houghton. The construction
of the clock was so exquisitely executed
The Early History of Williamstown^


that it may be reckoned among the few
best in the world, and its splendid per-
formance has testified through many
years to the good work in its construc-
tion.
At one time convicts (early in the
fifties) were employed in forming the
streets of Williamstown. For a short
period the prisoners of the SacKimento
were employed in the construction of
the Melbourne and Williamstown rail-
way, and subsequently with the prisoners
from the hulk Deborah , Success , and
Lysander at Gellibrand’s Point in quarry-
ing stone, building the breakwater jetty,
battery and other works in the locality.
The prisoners on board the President
were never sent on shore to labor, as they
were retained in separate confinement,
nor were those of the Success after
July, 1857* In the latter part of this
year all the hulk prisoners whom it was
deemed safe to keep at labor were
transferred from the hulks to Pentridge.
In December, 1858, female prisoners
who had been previously incarcerated
in altogether unsuitable buildings in
Melbourne, were transferred to the
Sacramento , which had been recently
vacated by the transfer of the men to
Pentridge.
Several serious attempts to escape
were made, none of which however
were successful. The first outbreak of
prisoners in September, 1853, had been
premeditated by them for some days
previously, and on the morning of the
attempt the gangs in the quarries were
noticed bending their irons with their
stone hammers to make them oval,
when by aid of a little grease or soap
they could slip them over their heels.
About fifteen got their irons off first,
and made a rush on the guards about
10 a.m. The guards, who were armed
with rifles, and were posted around the
quarries at from 50 to 80 yards dis-
tant, had been warned of the matter,
and ordered to fire low on any prisoners
passing the line, with the view rather of
disabling than killing them ; a volley
met the first rush at which several fell
all wounded in the legs. This checked
the attempt, but the outbreak was not
quelled till after several other F<
were fired and other prisoners wouF<

a The Williamstown Oas Company has
established some 25 years. At
|j )() first there was great difficulty in selling
shares. Gradually, however, they
r | t came into favor, and notwithstanding
‘the electric scare the shares have
become more and more
popular. The gas is supplied to the cus-
tomers at a lower rate than any other
suburb, while the original shareholders
receive 15 per cent, on their shares.
The second Gas Company established
in Williamstown have had several diffi-
culties to contend with. As popula-
tion increases, they too will probably be
as successful as the first. Good news
from home for gas consumers if not for
gas companies, is that water gas has
been manufactured by the Leeds Forge
Company, and the sale of the gas
amounts to per annum. The
gas can be manufactured at less than
4d a 1000 ; coal gas is never likely to be
made as cheaply as that, Water gas is
said to have two peculiarities—one,
that it is absolutely odourless; this at
first might seem to be an advantage,
but when coupled with its other pecu-
liarity—that is, a deadly poison—is at
best a questionable one.
The Williamstown Artillery Corps
was organized in 1857. The Williams-
town Rifle Corps and the Volunteer
Artillery in August, 1859. The Volun-
teers up to 1871 received no pay. The
Militia force of Williamstown consists
of the Naval Brigade, 192 strong, and
the Garrison Artillery, 100; 140 men
constitute the Permanent Force; they
are distributed over the Cerberus , tor-
pedo and gun boats.
There is a pretty racecourse two
miles from the town with a grand stand
facing the sea.
The Sailors’ Rest was established
about 15 years since for the convenience
and comfort of seamen in port. About
a year and a half ago a number of Wil-
liamstown ladies undertook to give con-
certs every Wednesday evening at the
Home, and now there are not many
Homes where better singing can be
heard, or a more enjoyable evening
spent than is thus periodically provided
for Jack Tar.

if the same course be pursued for
a few years, it will really be a credit to
the town.
In 1875 the Wilkinson Memorial Foun-
tain was erected by subscription. At
the opening ceremony an appropriate
speech was delivered in which a wish
was expressed that it might stand for
generations to afford a cooling draft to
the thirsty wayfarer as well as a
memento of the worthy pastor, Rev.
Geo. Wilkinson, in whose honor it was
erected. Five years ago attention was
called in the papers to its neglected
condition, again it is out of order ; three
of the four taps are broken. Alas !
how ephemeral is the esteem and
gratitude that barely survives a coat of
paint. Would it not be both more
economical anc appropriate to con-
struct monumental memorials of some
friable or rapidly disintegrating material
that would crumble as fast as our zeal
decays ? Then the uncared-for struc-
tures would not pain the sensitive by
at once betokening past regard and
present indifference. Every time I
pass the fountain (?) I deplore my own
apathy save these few easily written
words in keeping gieen the memory of
one whom I used to think I would put
myself to considerable inconvenience
to serve. Neglected monumental
memorials have on me a depressing
effect, and, like a child, I cannot re-
frain from giving utterance to my grief.
The Mechanics’ Institute is a large
blue stone building with a spacious hall
suitable for lectures, public meetings,
and theatrical performances. There

upwards of qooo volumes. The library

lect black letter tomes, nevertheless
many of the works on the shelves are very
old. The readers of the magazines and
the newest publications are supp Fed at
