LIFE HISTORY OF A SAVAGE.
By the Rev. Geo. Brown, D.D., Sydney.
(Read before the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science,
Monday, 10 th January, 1898.)
I purpose in this paper giving a brief outline of the everyday
life of a savage from his birth to his death. His life as compared
with the busy exciting life of a man in these colonies in this
present 19th century civilization may perhaps be thought of little
importance, but no type of human life can be considered unin-
teresting or uninstructive to the student of anthropological
science.
The life I am about to describe is that of a man born in a part
of the New Britain Group, situate in about A S. lat. and 153° E.
long. His parents were members of one branch of the great
Papuan family and had their home in the midst of a dense bush —
not far from the beach, however, for all the coast natives live in
dread of the bushmen. The village in which they lived was not
laid out in streets, nor were the houses built together on one site.
A New Britain village consists generally of a number of small
communities or families, their houses being built together in small
clusters and separated from those of other similar communities
by patches of uncleared forests through which run irregular and
very often muddy foot tracks, scooped out in some places by ease-
loving pigs into mud-holes in which they can wallow and enjoy
themselves during the heat of the day. These sites, however, are
kept scrupulously clean, and it is always easy to tell an old village
site by a circular mound in the bush caused by the accumulated
sweepings of dead leaves and rubbish.
The houses are all very small and very poorly constructed.
They are generally oblong in shape and very low. In olden days
there was often a rattle suspended in the doorway at night against
which anyone attempting to enter in the night would hit his head
and so arouse the inmates. This was done as some protection
against surprise and treachery. The furniture in the house in
which my friend’s parents lived was neither large nor varied. It
consisted of a few bamboos along one side, raised a little from the
ground so as to make a kind of bench or seat, a plank from some
old canoe, which served as a kind of bed, a fishing net, some spears,
and tomahawks, a few baskets of yams, green bananas and edible
nuts called taraap, and a few cocoanuts. There were also a few
water bottles and a basket or two containing lengths of native
money called diwara, beads, pipes, tobacco, net twine, betel pepper
33665 (11)


and areca nuts, and a gourd or bamboo box containing lime to
eat with the areca or betel nut. It might all be summed up as
follows: a man and woman, a house, a fire, a board or leaf to
sleep on, a few baskets of food and a few weapons. Outside these
clusters of houses, however, would be seen evidences of taste and
appreciation of the beautiful in the planting of dracoenas, crotons,
and coleus plants of the brightest colours.
In such a place and amid such conditions the man of whose
life I am to give a brief outline was born, and in order to make
my account more definite and clear than it would be if I dealt
with him simply as an imaginary being, 1 shall take the liberty of
naming him at once by the name which he will bear through life
so far as this account is concerned, though in doing so I am doing
what his own father and mother would not have done themselves,
as a man is rarely if ever known by the same name from child-
hood to old age. I shall call him Tepang, which literally means
“ my friend.”
HIS BIRTH AND BOYHOOD.
At his birth the father would have to clear out, but so far as I
know, there would be no particular ceremonies observed except
paying the women who came to nurse the mother. He would
get first a little of the expressed juice of the cocoanut to drink,
and would be clothed only in a warm banana leaf, and probably
carried for a day or so on the sheath of the cocoanut blossom.
They make no tine mats, and only small and very coarse pieces of
native cloth from the bark of the breadfruit where Tepang was
born, and so his dress was simply the sunshine in the beginning
and a certain quantity of ashes and dirt when he began to crawl
about.
As a boy he lived and acted much as other boys do in more
civilized communities. The games in which he and his comrades
played are many of them very like our own, together with some
others peculiar to them. He and his playmates often built houses
on the beach or away out in the shallow waters of the lagoon, and
got more pleasure from living and sleeping there than they did in
their own homes. Then there were often sham fights in which
reed spears were used in place of the more dangerous ones used by
the grown up men, and in these fights they acquired a skill in
throwing which was very useful to them in after life. In the
day there were fishing, boating, and bathing parties, and at night
there were songs and dancing, and in many other respects they
aped the doings of their seniors. Tepang would work only when
it pleased him to do so. If his father or mother told him to go
to the garden and he did not wish to do so, he simply ran away
to the beach or to the bush and came home when he pleased.
He got his share of the regular evening meal, but the most of his


food he picked up when and where he could. He was, however
not allowed to eat some things, notably the cuttle-fish, which they
say runs backwards, and so a boy eating that is sure to grow up
to be a coward.
HIS ENTRANCE INTO LIFE.
As Tepang grew up his parents were very properly anxious
that he should become a member of the secret societies, and so
steps were taken for his initiation. The first probably of these
societies into which he was admitted would be the Dukduk,
Many considerations no doubt influenced his parents to take this
step (1) The Society is a powerful one, and there is a certain
amount of prestige in belonging to it. (2) Many of their son’s
comrades were members of it, and Tepang would certainly make
trouble if his parents did not find the money for his entrance
fees. (3) He would certainly be fined sooner or later for some
real or imaginary breach of the Dukduk’s laws, and as they would
have to pay the tine it was cheaper to pay the fees. (4) There
was always a certain amount of plunder obtained by the Dukduk,
and they naturally wished for Tepang to have a share. The
Dukduk is a society of men whose principal object is to extort
money from everyone else who is not a member, and to terrify
women and those who are not initiated. They have a “ sacred ”
piece of land called the “ tareu ” in which their house or lodge-
room is placed. Here the dresses of the Dukduk are prepared,
and from this place the Dukduk go out whooping and dancing to
terrify or amuse the people. Here also the members congregate
all day long whilst Dukduk operations are in force, and gossip,
eat, and sleep to their heart’s content. No woman nor uninitiated
person dare go near this sacred enclosure. The Dukduk is
represented to the outside public by a figure dressed in a full leaf
girdle, composed of rings of leaves strung together extending
from the breast to below the knees. These when shaken as the
figure dances increase the awe with which Dukduk is regarded.
The upper part of the body is covered by a high conical mask
gaily ornamented, made of wicker work, and covered also with
leaves or cloth. This extends down over the shoulders and arms
and rests upon the leaf girdle, so that the whole of the man’s
body is covered with the exception of a part of his legs. He
often carries a spear or stick, and sometimes also a human skull
in his hands as he goes whooping and dancing along the paths.
Often two or three Dukduks emerge from the “tareu.” The
women and boys all hide as these figures go along. They are
supposed to believe that the Dukduk is a spirit from the bush,
and they very wisely pretend to do so. Some of these Dukduks
have only a short black mask instead of the gaily ornamented one.
These are the females who give birth to the Dukduk proper.


When Tepang first sought admission he became a “ tena-mana ”
or candidate, and certain fees were paid, then he and his fellow-
candidates were put through an elaborate system of fooling, and
had to suffer some actual pain in their supposed search for the
Dukduk. After passing through the preliminary fooling they
became “ tena-wanai ” or apprentices, and had a little more
insight given them, and then, after a while, they became “tena-
maul,” or fully accredited members, and learnt all the secrets.
These were principally how to prepare the dresses, what to say,
how to dance, and what were the restrictions as to food and
conduct whilst the mysteries were engaged in, and above all how
money was to be made and food procured from other people by
the fear inspired by the Dukduk. It must be said, however, that
this association had its own sphere of usefulness in a state of
society such as existed in Tepang’s birthplace, where there were
few chiefs of sufficient power to compel any obedience to law or
to enforce punishment against a transgression except by the aid
of such a society as the Dukduk.
As Tepang grew up and either found money himself or was
provided with it by his friends, he was initiated into other
societies, all more or less secret. In one he was taught how to
curse his enemies in the most telling manner \ in another, how to
prepare love philters for his own use, or for the use of those who
paid him for them; in another, he was shown the secrets of
“ Agagara ” or witchcraft, and taught how easy it was to make
a man sicken and die just as he pleased. He was taught how to
make new dances and how profitably he could sell them to other
towns. He also became a member of the Iniat Society, and after
the months which were passed in the ceremonies of his initiations
were completed he could never again eat pork, shark, dog, or
turtle, and he always had to have his food cooked in a separate
oven for fear of contamination from any of those forbidden
delicacies. From all which it will be seen that it is a great
mistake to imagine that a young man in Tepang’s position had no
duties or responsibilities such as we have here, that he had
nothing to do but eat, sleep, and be merry, or that he had no
taxes to pay or any public duties to perform.
HIS MARRIAGE.
It is, however, quite time that I said something about my friend’s
marriage. People in New Britain marry as they do in other
places but they are not “ given ” in marriage, for there is always
payment made and received. There is, indeed, a fine distinction
in their language with regard to the preposition used, as a man
marries “ with ” the woman, but the woman marries “to ” the
man. When Tepang, like other young men, thought it was


necessary for him to have a wife, he found himself at once involved
in a maze of long-established customs and usages, amid which it
was impossible for him to find his way alone, and so he had to
submit to the guidance of those who knew better than he did how
to act. He knew, of course, that he must select the lady from the
opposite class to his own. In his land, men and women, boys and
girls, cocoa-nuts, fishing stones, food-bearing trees, &c., are all
divided into two classes, one called Pikalaba, and the other
Maramara. No Pikalaba can marry one of the same class, and
Tepang being Pikalaba, could only marry a girl who was
Maramara. Marriage with a girl of his own class, though no
blood relative, would be considered incestuous, and would have
brought speedy punishment; in fact, the whole of the people
would have been horrified at such an event. When he fixed his
affections upon the girl he wanted for a wife, the first thing to do
was to find out whether the girl liked him or not, and this was
the first difficulty, for young men and young women do not mix
together as they do in other lands. When I asked him how he
found out whether the girl liked him or not without his having
asked her, he said very innocently, “ Oh, I saw it in her eye.”
He then told his relatives, and they agreed to buy the girl, for a
man never buys his own wife, though he has ultimately to pay for
her. When all was arranged, Tepang and his wife became
“ webat”—sweethearts or engaged. He then gave his betrothed
what is called a Ka-na-ongrat or betrothal basket, answering to our
engagement ring. In this basket he put some diwara, native money,
beads, tobacco, armlets, shells, cuscus, teeth, with other property.
He gave her this very quietly, or if too modest to do it himself
he got some girl friend to give it. The girl could not, however,
make use of any of the property in the basket until after their
marriage, as she had to take it all with her on her wedding day,
and show that she had taken all proper care of it. When it was
known that the girl had received Tepang’s ka-na-ongrat, no other
young man could seek her without causing a great quarrel. After
this, Tepang’s friends borrowed “ pupulu ” money from some chief
or “ pet-palig ” man of wealth, and on a certain day they divided
this out amongst the girl’s friends and relatives, whilst the friends
of the girl brought food. During this time Tepang was invisible.
He had cleared out of the village and hidden somewhere in the
bush, as he was not supposed to know what was being done. The
girl’s relatives who had got the money were not allowed, however,
to use it until all the ceremonies were complete. On a given day
all the friends of each party made a display of their diwara and
other property amid a great blowing of conch shells and shouting.
This was to show the young couple what wealthy relatives they
had. On another day all the diwara which had been given to the
girl’s relatives was brought back again, and each man who had


received any had to show it and then give back half of it to the
bridegroom. After this, there was other interchanges of food
between the relatives on either side, all regulated by strict rules,
each basket having its proper place in the display. After this,
the girl remained with her husband, but like a good girl she cried a
good deal, and made a pretence of running away. Then presents
were made to the young couple by their friends. The bride
received some diwara “that she might get more diwara,” some
pearl shells “ for knives with which to prepare the food,” leaf
dishes “ for plates for her husband’s food,” stones “ for the native
oven,” water bottles, bowls in which to prepare her puddings, a
broom “ with which she was to keep her house and grounds clean,”
and other articles too numerous to mention. Tepang received a
spear with which he was to protect his wife, and also a stick as
an emblem of his authority with which he was to thrash her in
case she failed in the discharge of her duties. After this a
chief, one of Tepang’s relatives, came on the scene, having a club
in one hand and a young cocoanut in the other. He first broke
the cocoanut, and poured the water over the heads of the bride
and bridegroom. Then he took his club and struck a banana
stem as many blows as he had killed enemies in fight. This was
to assure them of his protecting care over them. The final act
was that Tepang had to repay the money which was borrowed for
the purchase of his bride, with 10 per cent, added for interest,
and so he became a married man. He made a good husband so
far as he understood his duties. He cleared the ground for the
garden, and made the fences, but left most of the planting to be
done by his wife, and she had also to carry home the food whilst
he walked behind with his spear or tomahawk only. She had no
trouble about taking care of his clothes, simply because he never
wore any. His wife had all the cooking to attend to, though he
would occasionally help her, and would indeed cook for himself
rather than go without his supper, if the wife was unable to do
it. He was very fond of his children, and generally allowed
them to do as they pleased, as he himself had done when he was
a boy. The time allotted will not allow me to give all details of
Tepang’s every day life after this, and I can only briefly sketch
his social, political, and religious life.
SOCIAL LIFE.
In his social life he had many duties to perform, and many
engagements in which he had to take part. He had to take his
place in the great fishing and trading parties organised by his
people ; he had to give feasts, and to join in the feasts given by
others. When he was not engaged in the Dukduk ceremonies, or
in those of some other society, he had to practice the songs and


dances in which his village was engaged. As a man who knew
the different forms of witchcraft, his services were often secured
by some one who wished either to kill or to extort money from
someone else. To do this he would secure a piece of yam,
banana, areca nut, or anything indeed which had been touched
by the obnoxious party, or which formed any part of his body,
such as hah*, skin, blood, or indeed almost anything. Tepang
would then take this and bury it in a hole in the ground together
with small pieces of sharpened bamboo and poisonous plants.
He would then utter some incantation over the lot, and would
probably specify the particular manner in which he wished the
misfortunes to fall upon the man. Then he would cover all up,
and perhaps place some sacred stone of the Iniat Society upon it,
receive his fee, and go to his board bed with a clear conscience,
fully assured that so long as that spell was not removed its power
would be felt, and until that stone was removed the man affected
would be pressed down by disease, and nothing that he did
would prosper. Of course, it soon got known that the agagara
had been made, and if the unfortunate fellow concerned was
not sick he soon got sick from fear, and the consequence was
that he had to come and pay Tepang diwara in order that
the spell might be removed. This was one of the ways in
which my friend began to make his money, and develop into a
capitalist, for nearly every native believes when he is sick that
someone has bewitched him. Death, in the opinion of those
people, rarely, if ever, happens from what are called natural causes.
Tepang was also a doctor. In the course of his education he had
been taught the medicinal properties of many of the plants and
vines which grew in the bush, how to prepare them as medicine,
what quantities of each he might safely use, and above all the
proper prayers which were to be said if the remedy was to be
successful. He was very skilful in the preparation of decoctions
of leaves, over which certain prayers to the spirits of the dead
were uttered. The patient’s body was then carefully dusted with
lime. Then Tepang uttered more prayers over the medicine, which
the man at once drank, so that he might get the full benefit both
of the medicine and the prayers. The lime was then blown off
the body of the patient, taking (so Dr. Tepang informed them) a
good deal of the disease with it. When he got a patient with
plenty of money my friend would vary the latter part of the cure.
In order to drive the disease away, and also the evil spirit who
caused it, Tepang would prepare a steam bath by mixing in a
large bowl a lot of cocoanut juice, burnt cocoanut kernel, ginger
roots, and leaves of various plants and trees. The patient was
seated over this bowl and covered up with broad leaves. Then
hot stones were put into the mixture, some were also put under
his feet, and he had to hold two others in his hands, and so he


was thoroughly steamed. Afterwards the doctor (Tepang) had a
great feast prepared for the patient and his friends, for which the
patient had to pay liberally, in addition to the doctor’s fees. In
this way also my friend added to his wealth. In addition to these
professions, he was also a debt collector. Being a man of power,
and having plenty of money, he was often appealed to by those
who were unable to collect the debts due to them, or, what
amounted to the same thing, the amount which they considered
to be due. A. owes B. 10 fathoms of diwara, but refuses to pay,
or B. cannot wait longer for the money. He goes to Tepang and
presents him with 1 fathom, and then Tepang pays the 10
fathoms which A. owes, and A. in his turn has to give Tepang 11
fathoms, so that Tepang gets double commission, and nets a clear
20 per cent, on the transaction. In more serious matters Tepang
got still higher commission, as he incurred more risk, and might
have more difficulty in arranging the affair. A. commits adultery
with B.’s wife. This is a very serious matter, and B. and his
friends at once fight with more or less success. But B. has another
remedy, and he takes, say, 10 fathoms to Tepang, who at once
gives him 100 fathoms in return —that is, 10 fathoms for each
fathom given him—and then he demands from A. 120 or 150
fathoms in return, which A. must at once give, or be prepared to
fight the combined forces of Tepang and the aggrieved B. and his
family. In these and other similar transactions, such as providing
the money with which to purchase a wife for one of his friends,
advancing the cost of a canoe or house, etc., Tepang became a
comparatively wealthy man, and was always ready to lend on
good security, and at a good rate of interest. Strange as it may
appear, these people have words for getting goods on credit, for
borrowing, lending, pledging, redeeming, and also one for interest,
and Tepang regularly lent out money at rates never less
than 10 per cent. In this matter Tepang was very like some
people who are in a much higher stage of civilisation than
that to which he had attained ; but in another custom he was
very much at variance with them, for he was an undoubted
cannibal, and what is more, he saw no harm whatever in the
custom, but on the contrary he regarded it much as a religious
duty and at all events as being a very commendable act. The
principal motive which actuated Tepang in eating his enemy was
that of revenge and giving rest or satisfaction to the spirit of his
relative or friend who had been killed. Ido not think that the
desire in his case, at all events, was from a craving for animal
food or from the idea of acquiring, by eating his enemy, any part
of the valour or strength of the person eaten. When Tepang or
his friends captured or killed an enemy they bound him securely
and took him to their village and made all kinds of taunting
speeches to him. They showed him the house and grounds of the


man whose death they were revenging. “ Look (they would say)
you are the man who killed So and-So; see, there is his house,
these are his weapons ; these trees belonged to him ; this is his
garden; now we are going to eat you in payment for what you
or your people have done.” If the man were living he would
answer these taunts, either admitting them or denying them, and
saying who it was that had done the deed. Sometimes, in such a
case, some friend of his would produce a large quantity of diwara
and ransom him, but in most cases he was killed and eaten.
This illustrates the idea of revenge as the inducement of
cannibalism. The other idea is shown by another example. One
of Tepang’s relatives is killed, and, of course, there is no rest for
his spirit until proper satisfaction is given. His house is kept in
order, his spears are stuck in the ground in front of the house,
and his tomahawk is hung on the wall. A dead branch of a tree
is stuck in the ground in front and a small basket is hung upon it
in which Tepang and his friends put small pieces of food from
time to time. In course of time they either kill the man who
killed him or one from the same village, or failing that they buy
such a man or a piece of one from some other village. Then the
family of the murdered man assemble and each one eats a small
piece of him, another piece is put in the basket, which I have
mentioned as being hung near the dead relative’s house, and
another piece is flung in the direction of the village of the man
who killed him. The piece which is put in the basket of the dead
relative is to assure his spirit that his death is avenged and that
he may now go away in peace. Tepang and his friends then pull
up the spears, take down the tomahawk, uproot the dead branch,
let the house go to ruin and go to their ordinary business quite satis-
fled that they have done their duty. The skulls of these victims,
however, are often kept as trophies and may be seen stuck up on
poles, either in front of Tepang’s house or on the spot where his
relative was killed. In some places the jawbones are kept, and I
have seen in one house thirty-five of these relics hung up on the
battens of the house.
of tepang’s political life
I can say but little in this paper. As a man of influence he had
to take his part in all the deliberations regarding taboos, and help
to enforce the penalties which followed any breach of the laws.
This institution, however, is not so far reaching nor so frequently
used as it is in other groups. He had also to take his full share
of all the fighting, which is frequent enough to satisfy any man.
Tepang and his people were always at feud with neighbouring
towns and villages. Sometimes peace would be made, and there
would be a settling up of all the differences ; but this state never
lasted long, and some new cause of offence would revive all the old,
33665 (11)—B


bad feelings. When one town decided to fight again, they would
often send a notice to that effect, and the others would meet them
at the boundary between the two villages ; and Tepang, of course,
had to be present, for all must go.
He and his people fought with sling and stones, spears, and
tomahawks, and in later days with the white man’s musket. There
was never much execution done in these fights. If one man on
either side got speared, that was considered quite enough for that
day, and both sides would disperse. After this there was but
little to do except to guard against surprises, for the war assumed
a chronic state, and each side simply tried to surprise some unfor-
tunate individual when off his guard. Before Tepang went to any
of these fights he had to bathe and offer prayers to the spirits,
asking them to make the tomahawk sharp and the spear good.
When he got to the boundary he, as a man of knowledge, had to
taunt his adversaries with all the foul language he could hurl at
them, and as he knew a good deal of bad language he could do
this pretty effectively. Then he knew many poisonous plants, and
also a poison which he obtained from the sea, probably from some
sea anemone, and with these he anointed his spear, and also those
of his friends, to make them more deadly ; but as I have said, not
many people were killed in fair and open fight.
Peace-making, however, was a very complicated matter, and
many ceremonies were observed. When Tepang and his friends
desired to make peace with those with whom they were at enmity,
they first sent a draccena plant as a sign of their wish. If the
other chief was favourable he accepted the dracena and planted it
in his ground. Then he pulled up one from his own ground and
returned it by the messenger. After this, negotiations were
entered into and a day fixed for the settlement. On the appointed
day Tepang and his people assembled on one side of the appointed
place and the other chief and his party occupied a position opposite
to them. All were armed as if for fight, and at a given signal
they advanced, brandishing their spears and shouting defiance to
each other. Then they rushed madly against each other with
spears poised ; but as they met each man turned his spear aside and
turned his shoulder to his opponent, and they bumped together.
This was done several times, first one side and then the other
being the challenging party. After each bumping, small pieces
of diwara were interchanged. Then Tepang made a speech, in
which he laid all the blame of the wrongs which had been done
on some member of his village, and assured his opponents that the
evil was committed without his consent. The other chief replied
in a similar manner, laying all the blame on someone who was
dead. Then Tepang and his people tied a lot of money on a large
branch of a tree and cried out, “ This is for So-and-So,” mentioning
the name of someone of the opposite side whom they had killed.
As soon as the other side saw this they appeared to refuse it, and


advanced as if to fight, but finished, as usual, by bumping
shoulders together. They took the money and were carrying it
away, when Tepang and his friends pursued them as if to regain
their property. This, however, was oidy a pretence, and ended,
as usual, in the curious bumping ceremony. The other side then
brought payment for one of Tepang’s friends whom they had
killed, and the same scene was enacted; and so on alternately
until all the killed on both sides had been paid for. Then there
were large quantities of food brought by both parties, more sham
fights, and more bumping. The food was all mixed together, to
guard against any witchcraft and to show that no poison had
been put in. After this, Tepang and his friends rose, yelling and
shouting, and circled round the food, and the other side did the
same, and Tepang and his party finally sat down on the side
which had been previously occupied by the opposite party, whilst
they sat on the spot where Tepang and party had been, and so
peace was made. During these ceremonies there were also several
symbolic actions, such as darting a spear apparently at one of the
opposite party, but burying the point in the ground instead ; and
also when one man from either side advanced as if to tight, but
instead of hurling their spears, each man put his foot on his spear
and broke off’ the point by a sudden twist of the hand.
SICKNESS AND DEATH AND BURIAL.
As Tepang got old he was often sick, and at such times all the
spells which he had been accustomed to use to others were tried,
with varying success. Sometimes he was better, but as months
went on, both he and his friends saw that his strength was
declining. During all this time his friends were.very attentive
to him, for they never desert the sick.
At length, the old man felt that the end was not far away ;
that all spells had failed, and he must prepare to die. He then
told his friends what he thought and what he wished. He dis-
posed of part of his property, but the bulk he left to be divided
according to native custom. His friends then made a litter for
him, and on this the old man was taken to all the old familiar
places where his life had been lived, that he might see them again
for the last time. They took him to the tareu, and to the lodge-
room where he had been wont, year by year, to take part in the
Dukduk ceremonies; to the house where his canoes were and
where his nets were hung, which he would never use again ; to
the garden which he had fenced ; to the trees which he had
planted ; to the boundary where he had often fought; and to the
houses where his friends and relatives lived; and then, weary and
tired, they took him home to die ; and when he passed away,
they mourned for him with loud and bitter wailing, varied with
curses against those who had caused his death.


Tepang being a chief was not buried at sea as other and poorer
people were, A chair was made, called a koromia, and on this he
was seated. He was then bathed. After this he was decorated
with necklaces, wreaths of flowers, and feathers and decked out
in full war paint. Then they put a spear in his right hand, his
club was put over his shoulder, and some ginger plants in his
mouth, the mask of a warrior and a large cooked yam were put in
his hand. They gave him his weapons that he might fight his
way against any who tried to hinder him from going to the spirit
land, matana nion, whilst the food was for him to eat on his long
journey. There was, of course, the usual jumping-off place for all
spirits, but it was often difficult for them to get there. The
friends and relatives then brought coils of money (diwara), neck-
laces, ornaments, <kc., and placed them in front of the dead chief,
and before taking them away they broke off small portions on the
fire which was burning there. Tepang’s spirit was supposed to
take all this property (the spirit of it) to spirit land and so enter
there as a rich man. After this certain ceremonies were performed
to find out the name of the evil spirit who had caused the death,
and also to find out the man who had bewitched Tepang, and got
the evil spirit to compass his death. Tepang was then placed on
a platform, and, whilst the process of decay went on, the relatives
sat round, regardless of the stench, as they thought in so doing
they would get some of the dead chiefs courage and knowledge.
Some of them would even anoint their bodies with the dripping
from the platform for the same purpose. When the head became
detached it was carefully preserved by the nearest relative, whilst
the body was buried in a house at a very shallow depth. A fire
was made on the top of it, and the relatives slept in the house.
All the relatives blackened their faces for a long time, and after-
wards the skull was put on a platform and dances were held
round it for many nights. Up to this time Tepang’s spirit was
supposed to be somewhere about, but after this he was not to
trouble them any more. They had done all they could for him,
and as a properly-behaved spirit he should now keep to his own
place. Where that place was they did not know. The spirits of
common people were supposed to stay about the caves and holes
in the rocks and to eat rubbish, but those of men like Tepang,
who had been a warrior and, above all, a generous man, went to
a good place and were well fed. The only definite punishment I
ever heard of was in the case of a niggard, and the punishment of
such a man they told me was that the spirits took him and
bumped him against the big slab roots of the chestnut tree.
I have now given this short sketch of some of the incidents and
experiences in the life of my friend, but it is impossible to give
in the time allowed for this paper all the life history of a man
who lived as long as he did, and I can only hope that at some
future time I may be able to complete this very imperfect sketch.


NOTES OF A RECENT JOURNEY TO NEW GUINEA
AND NEW BRITAIN.
By the Rev. Geo. Brown, D.D., Sydney.
(Read before the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science,
Monday, 10 th January, 1898.)-
The visit of which I purpose giving a short account was begun
in May last and extended to the middle of September. The
course followed was from Sydney to Port Moresby in New Guinea,
thence to Samarai, the Engineer Group, the De Boyne Group, the
d’Entrecasteaux Group, the Trobriands Group, New Britain,
Duke of York, and New Ireland, I sailed from Sydney as far as
Samarai, in New Guinea, in the s.s. “Titus,” and from the r e
voyaged either in open boats or in a small 14-ton ketch until we
reached Cooktown on the return voyage.
During the period of my journey I saw a good deal of the
natives, and had also the advantage of constant intercourse with
the missionaries, and also with the Samoan, Fijian, and Tongan
teachers who are resident amongst them. Most of my informa-
tion as regards the habits and opinions of the New Guinea peoples
was obtained from the Revs. W. E. Bromilow and S. B. Fellows.
New Guinea and its inhabitants have been so often described
that it is not necessary to dwell at any length upon them. The
country presents the usual features of high mountainous land in
the tropics, whilst the people, who are members of the great
Papuan family, are in somewhat different stages of culture, from
he naked savages of the western portion to the more civilised
races who inhabit the south-eastern groups of islands and the ex-
treme east of the mainland.
The principal products of the islands are pearl-shell, beche de
mer, copra, and rubber. Gold also is found both on the mainland
and in the islands—from which latter the principal amount has
13


been obtained. There is little doubt, I think, that rubber will, at
no distant date, be the principal article of export. It is obtained
from large trees by boring, and also from several species of vines
—the latter being the best in quality.
I have visited New Guinea on three different occasions, and I
noticed very great changes in the social position of the people
which had taken place since my last visit in 1891, some six years
ago. The influence exerted by the Government and by the Mis-
sionaries was very apparent in the change which has taken place
among the people. I noticed particularly that the people travel
far more now than they did, because they can go in safety ; this
is of great benefit to the natives living on many of the islands as
they can now purchase food during the months of scarcity and
so they live better than they did previously. Another benefit is
that the coast line is becoming more settled. Formerly the bush
people were afraid to live there from fear of the large tribes living
on either side of the unoccupied district, whilst the people of those
districts, and those of the neighbouring islands, were afraid to
settle on them from fear of the bushmen. Now, large portions of
these coastal districts are being settled, and villages are being
established in districts which were quite unoccupied on my pre-
vious visits.
I was not able to make many notes in the Engineer and De
Boyne Groups, as my stay in those islands was very short. The
people in De Boyne Group (Panaieti) are great canoe builders,
and some of the finest canoes in south-eastern New Guinea are
built there.
At Dobu (Goulvain Island) in the d’Entrecasteaux Group ,1
made a longer stay and found that great changes had taken place
there since my last visit. The skulls of enemies, who had been
killed and eaten, which used to be placed in rows over the doors
of the houses had all disappeared. The dead, who were formerly
buried in the villages close to the houses, are now all buried in a
general cemetery at some distance from the villages and the social
position of the people is much improved.
KITE FISHING.
This mode of fishing is much practised here, and I was able to
get a specimen of the entire apparatus. The kite is made of
broad leaves kept extended and flat by means of pieces of light
wood. To the tail of the kite some cocoons or spider webs are
attached. The kite is flown from a canoe and the end of the kite
tail is kept just skimming the top of the water. The gar-fish bite
at the cocoon and are then unable to let it go. The fisherman at


once backs his canoe quietly, winding up the string as he does so,
until he gets the fish on board, when the kite is flown again. I
have not seen this mode adopted in any other group.
CIRCULATING ADORNMENTS.
At Dobu I saw in the possession of the Rev. W. E. Bromilow
some large armlets and a very valuable necklace. Similar ones
are in the possession of a number of chiefs who are members of a
circle, entry into which is gained by the possession of some large
and valuable armlet or “baggi.” These adornments then become
the property of the circle and are passed on from one to another
and go the round of every individual member of it. So far as I
could learn there is no specified time in which the article remains
in the possession of a chief. The man may perhaps wish to have
a change in the coveted article of which he is the temporary
possessor, and this, of course, will necessitate a change all round.
Mr. Bromilow is, so far as I know, the only European who has
been admitted to this circle, and he may probably give us some
idea of the meaning and use of the custom which 1 have never
before known in any of the Polynesian Groups.
BURYING CHILDREN ALIVE.
At the Mission Station, Dobu, there may be seen several bright
and happy children who were rescued from this horrible death.
The case of the oldest may be taken as typical of them all. His
father and mother were dead, and on the mother’s death, as there
was no one who would take care of the baby boy she had left,
they were preparing to follow out their usual custom, and the
child was actually put into the grave to be buried with his dead
mother when he was rescued by Mrs. Bromilow, and has since
grown to be a bright, intelligent lad. In the case of a girl child,
some one would probably have been found to take charge of it, as
girls are a source of income when they are sought in marriage;
but to the New Guinea mind boys are only a source of trouble,
and no profit can be gained for the trouble of rearing other
people’s children.
a mother’s opinion about the moon.
A Kiriwina mother always lifts up her child to the first full
moon after its birth. This is to make it grow fast, and that it
may talk soon. I could get no reason for this singular custom,
one which I have never before met with, and which is (so far as I
know) a new instance of moon worship.


children’s GAMES.
One of the most interesting sights which I saw at Dobu was a
game played by a number of girls. This game must usually, I
think, occupy two or three hours ; but on the particular occasion
it was a good deal abbreviated for my sake, but even then it
occupied a long time. The girls all sat in a circle and sang a few
words very sweetly. Then one, who was the leader, pretended to
strike each one with a knife in turn, and each girl said, as the
pretended stroke was given, “ That knife is blunt ! ” Then there
was the pretence made of sharpening the knife, accompanied with
a descriptive song. After this all the circle joined hands, finger
to finger, and a song was sung as each finger was loosened. All
this occupied a long time, as the song had to be sung over and
over again as each finger of every girl in the circle was loosened.
Then some went out who were supposed to be witches, seeking to
kill one of the others; and there was a lot of singing, gesture
language, and appropriate action until these witches were driven
away ; in fact, there was a regular scrimmage before this was
finally accomplished. After this all the girls stood closely locked
together to represent a bunch of bananas. One was snatched
away at a time by a witch. The owner of the “ bananas” walked
round, and, missing one, asked of the fool or silly person, who
was supposed to watch, “Who stole my banana?” The answer
was given in each case, “ I don’t know,” This went on till all
the “ bananas” (girls) were taken away. Then there was a great
disturbance. The witches were found, driven away, and the girls
rescued. Then there was a game illustrative of a wallaby hunt,
and it was very amusing to see the way some of the gir ls imitated
the hunted wallabies, skipping and jumping away from their
pursuers. All these were accompanied with descriptive songs,
which, unfortunately, 1 did not understand.
All the islands of the d’Entrecasteaux Group have abundant
evidence of volcanic action, but, as in New Britain, I found no
lava streams. All the ejected matter is pumice, of which, indeed,
most of the islands there consist. There are many boiling springs
in the group, some of which, on Dobu and on Fergusson Island,
we visited. We landed at Numanuma on the latter island, and
after an hour’s good walking in the hot sun we reached the
fumaroles. The first intimation of their proximity was a large
stream of boiling water flowing to the coast. There were many
boiling springs along its banks, some of them emitting only boiling
water and others boiling mud. Then, after receiving many
cautions from our guides to follow them closely in single file and
not to step out of the track, we went on to the Geysers. There
were several of them, and the sight was very interesting. A


description of one of them may be taken as typical of all. In the
rock or pumice formation there was one or more irregularly
shaped pits, but how deep these were it was impossible to say, as
no one could approach them near enough to see. From these pits
there was just a light steam escaping, and then in a few minutes
there was an explosion, accompanied by an eruption of boiling
water. The water was thrown to a height of about 20 or 30 feet.
After this subsided we could only hear the angry roar beneath ;
then perhaps a few small dashes of water would be ejected, and
then more roaring and trembling of the ground which was soon
followed by another violent outburst. I managed to get a few
photographs which give some faint idea of the appearance of the
place and of the Geysers in action. I noticed no sulphur deposits,
so that, in this respect, these fumaroles differ from those in
Seymour Bay, on the opposite side of the bay which I visited in
1890. The natives told us that some’Normanby natives would
not believe that the water was boiling, and so went to bathe in
one of the pools and were scalded to death. I think it is more
probable that they had incautiously ventured too near one of
them and the ground had given way under them, or that they
were overwhelmed by an unexpected eruption of water. They
told us also that one of their own Avomen who had quarrelled
with her husband once threw herself into one of the holes in her
anger and was never seen again. We experienced no earthquake
during our visit, and this, the people told us, was a very unusual
experience.
SIGNS OF MOURNING.
In addition to the universal sign of blacking the face or body,
I noticed several other signs Avhich, to me, were peculiar, and one
which I had not previously met Avith in any Papuan race, though
it is quite common amongst eastern Polynesian peoples. This
was the custom which I saw amongst the Goodenough people at
Bwaidoga, on that island, of amputating a joint or joints from
the fingers of relatives when any of their friends Avere sick. At a
village called lakalova we saw people whose hands had been thus
mutilated—one woman having one or two joints removed from
her first, third, and fourth fingers; many others, including mere
children, Avere thus disfigured. This is an interesting instance of
similarity amongst those whom some people think are essentially
different races. In the Engineer Group the women have black-
ened faces and bodies, and shoulder belts of the white CoAvrie
shells. At Fergusson Island the women wear white plaited
armlets, a broad belt of the same kind round the body, just above
the breasts, and a narrow one all of the same material crossed
round the neck. On Bobu they Avear a great bundle of small
cords suspended round the neck,


YAM FEAST AND SPIRIT WORSHIP.
When we reached the Trobriands Group the yearly Yam feasts
were being held, and every village had its yam houses filled with
the new crop, and feasts and dances were being held daily. On
these occasions there is a great display of native property. The
principal chief is kept for days almost without food, or only fed
with some particular article and some betel nut. On a stated
day he comes from his retirement and after certain ceremonies he
ties a piece of prepared fibre round the posts of the yam houses.
This makes them “ taboo,” and no one can touch them. Plat-
forms are then built and on these are displayed all kinds of
valuable property, such as armlets, native money, &c. Then for
many days the feasts and dances are held. When all is finished
the people assemble, shout, beat the posts of the houses, overturn
everything where a spirit may be hiding, and do all that they can
to drive them away, and then the feasts are over. The probable
explanation is that the spirits have been made wealthy for
another year. They have got the spirits of the yams, and so
have enough for their needs ; they have got the spirits of the
property, and so are made wealthy ; they have heard the songs
and seen the dances, and now they are not wanted to frighten or
disturb those who are living, and so they are driven away. It is
much the same idea as that of displaying property before a dead
man and putting a yam into his hand before he is buried, which
I have noted in another place.
POWER OF CHIEFS.
Unlike those in other places in New Guinea, the chiefs in the
Trobriand Group possess great power—as great indeed as that
exercised by eastern Polynesian chiefs in old days. When
Enamakala, the great chief of Kiriwina, comes from his house no
one dare walk about the village in an upright position. Every-
one either walks in an abject, stooping position, or in some cases
actually crawls on hands and knees, and no one speaks above a
whisper when he is talking. This man has thirty-one wives, each
one of whom has, by the aid of her relatives, to a yam-house
filled with food for him. Five of his wives have died, four com-
mitted suicide, and one he killed.
KIRIWINA VILLAGES.
Much of the land .in the Trobriands is comparatively open
country. This is due, I think, to some extent to the bush having


been cut down for their large yam gardens. The site of a village,
or an old village site may, however, always be known by a large
clump of fine fruit-bearing trees, in the midst of which the village
is situated. This is quite a distinctive feature of the Trobriands
villages.
NEW BRITAIN.
In this group when I landed there in 1875 there was not a
single white man resident there, and where the people then were
wild, naked savages I saw great changes, but I am not able now
to give any detailed account of them, and I must reserve this for
some other occasion. I was much impressed, however, with one
instance of the
FORMATION OF AN ISLAND.
On one of the points of Blanche Bay, three of the best-known
mountains in New Britain are situated. These are called the
“ Mother and Daughters.” The “ Mother” is 2,000 feet high ; the
others are a little lower, and not so regular in shape. They are
all certainly of volcanic origin, as is also the whole of the sur-
rounding district, which is composed entirely of decomposed
pumice.
In 1878, when I was resident in the group, an active volcano
broke out about halfway up the side of the Mother. It was a
grand and fearful sight. The column of fire, smoke, and ashes
was, to all appearance at least, as high again as the Mother,
thousands of tons of pumice were ejected, the sea being covered
for miles, and presenting the appearance of a great, sandy desert
with no water visible. The water in that large bay was boiling
hot, even to the very farthest point of the bay, and the whole
country was covered with ashes which killed most of the cocoanut-
trees and all the gardens of the people.
The bay is very deep, and is about 8 miles wide at the place
where the island of which lam writing was upheaved. I visited
the place a few days after the outburst, and while the volcano was
still in furious action. The natives told me that during the first
days large jets of steam had been observed coming out of the bay
in a direct line between the volcano and a village on the main-
land called Karavia, and that a new island had been found at
some little distance from that village. With some difficulty I got
a crew to take me to it, and found an island nearly 3 miles in
circumference and, in some parts, about 60 feet high. The island
I found was situate on a spot which I remembered as being a


comparatively shallow bank of reef in the bay, but over which I
had often sailed in my boat. It was quite hot, and as it was impos-
sible for anyone to walk on it without shoes, I had to land alone.
The steam was very dense, and I soon lost sight of the boat, as my
crew also did of me. Often I had to stop and wait for a puff of
wind before I could see whether I could step over some crevices
out of which the steam was hissing. I soon found that the centre
of the island was a crater of toiling water, near to which it was
not safe to venture. I managed to keep a zigzag course until my
course was stopped by a large stream of hot water running from
the crater to the bay. I often landed on the island afterwards
and noticed that the water remained hot for some years, but the
crater was gradually filled up by the subsiding pumice around it.
This island has been named Vulcan Island. I visited the same
island a few months ago, and these are some of the changes which
I noticed as having taken place during the eighteen years which
have elapsed since it was upheaved from the sea. It is now only
about 30 feet high, and that only at one end. This I attribute
to the consolidation of the ejected matter and to the wearing
away by wind and weather. These influences have also affected
its circumference, as I judged that is not now more than 2 miles
in circumference. A channel which former ly existed between the
new island and a small rocky islet has been filled up with the
material washed away from the shore of the new island. The
whole island is covered with scrub, and there are Casuarina trees
on it which have attained a height of 30 or 40 feet.
This account shows that the progress of disintegration and the
growth of vegetation consequent thereon are very rapid in these
tropical countries, and it will also show, 1 think, that, whilst
volcanic areas are areas of subsidence, they are areas of upheaval
also, and that to a much greater extent than is believed by many
in the present age.
So far as my experience in New Britain is concerned, I am
quite satisfied that the peculiar feature of the coral formations in
that group can only be accounted for by upheaval, and not, so far
as I have seen, by any process of subsidence, though I believe
that this will account for many other formations in other groups
in the Pacific.
