REMARKS ON THE PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE
OF THE AUSTRALIAN FLORA. By the Rev. W.
Woolls, Ph.D., F.L.S.
f |AHE primeval history of Australian Botany is necessarily
X associated with the adventurous navigators, who,
animated by the spirit of Vasco di Gama, traversed the
Indian Ocean and reached the North-western shores of New
Holland whereof Van Diemen?s Land?subsequently called
Tasmania, was then regarded as an integral portion. Such
a mistake may seem strange to the present generation, but
it held its ground until the year 1798, when Bass and
Flinders discovered that Van Dieman?s Land was separated
from the mainland by at least a hundred miles of sea. Portu-
guese and Dutch navigators had already become acquainted
with New Holland in their voyages to the East Indies, but as
these voyages were undertaken in the interests of commerce
and at a periodwhen systematic botany was only in its infancy,
they added but little to our knowledge of the Australian Flora.
It was not until the days of Dampier, who in 1699 visited the
Western Coast of Australia for the second time, that any
specimens of Australian plants were collected and taken to
Europe. To DampiE�- belongs the honour of having been
VjWOBfA JNBTfTtfTM THA* r �'VOTTO7f& A


the first to communicate any knowledge of such, plants to
the scientific world. His herbarium is still preserved at
Oxford and contains forty specimens, eighteen of which
are figured in his Voyage (vol. TIL, ed. 1709), though few of
them with the exception of Colutea Novce Hollandice (now
Clianthus Dampieri), can be identified. The distinguished
navigator Cook, was the next to render service to the cause
of Australian botany, for although the original intention of
his first expedition (1770) was to promote geographical and
astronomical research, Mr. (afterwards Sir Joseph) Banks
had sufficient influence with the (Government of the day to
connect the voyage with the pursuit of natural history. For
this purpose he determined to share the glory of the expedi-
tion and to furnish at his own expense the means of prose-
cuting his favourite study. He provided, therefore, the
apparatus conducive to that object, and engaged Dr.
Solander (a Swede by birth and a distinguished pupil of
Linnaeus) to accompany him, as well as two artists?one to
delineate views and figures, and the other to paint subjects
of natural history?with a secretary and four servants. ?No
pains,? says Baron Cuvier, ? were spared by the naturalist to
enrich his collection or to gratify his curiosity. Banks dis-
played an astonishing activity; fatigue did not depress him,
nor did danger deter him. He was always in advance; he
was referred to in time of difficulty.? Banks and Solander
collected specimens at Botany Bay, Endeavour River, and
other parts of the Australian coast, and added 1,000 species
to the few already known. On this subject, Sir Joseph?s
biographer remarks, ?It was long hoped that Banks and
Solander would give an account of their labours and of the
immense collections made during the expedition. Solander,
having devoted ten years to his part of the undertaking,
died in 1782.? In addition to their common journal, their
notes and all the designs made under their direction still
exist in the Banksian Library, now in the British Museum.
A series of engravings, which it was intended to increase to
2,000, had been commenced but from some cause or other
not very well explained nothing was published under the
auspices of the authors. Their labours, however, were not
lost to the scientific world, botanists being permitted to
consult the specimens which had been collected, whilst in
the course of a few years they received due recognition and
description from the greatest botanist of the age, R. Brown.
Menzies, in Vancouver?s expedition *of 1791, and Labillar-


diere in that, of D?Entrecasteaux in 1792, contributed
materially to the knowledge of the Australian Flora, and
Mr. John White, Surgeon-General, who arrived in the
colony of New South Wales in 1788 with the ?First Fleet,?
and resided there for seven years, sent to Europe specimens
which were described by Sir John Smith, and figured in the
appendix to White?s Voyage to New South Wales. It was in the
beginning of the present century, however, that the expedi-
tion of Flinders (1801-1803) gave additional and permanent
interest to the study of Australian botany, and introduced
to European notice some of the most remarkable features in
its species. Robert Brown, who has sometimes been
designated ? The Prince of Botanists,? and sometimes ? The
Father of Australian Botany,? accompanied Flinders as
naturalist and rendered imperishable service to the cause
of science by his observations. He had been induced by
Banks to give up his commission as ensign and surgeon for
the pursuit of botany, and the foresight of Sir Joseph Avas
fully realised in the singular ability of his illustrious proUge.
After having visited the southern coasts of the continent,
and examined the flora from Port Jackson to the Blue
Mountains, he returned to Europe spoliis orientis onustus ,
bringing with him some 4,000 species of plants, either wholly
new to science or only imperfectly known, but destined to
employ him for several years in determining their relative
position in the system of classification which experience had
taught him to adopt. In his celebrated Prodromus Novae
HoUandice (1810), he may be said to have laid the foundation
of Australian botany on a sure basis, and to have initiated
that mode of arranging orders and genera which, with some
modification, all subsequent botanists have been content to
follow. This great work was composed in the midst of
Banks?s collections, and so highly did Sir Joseph value his
services, that by his will (1820) he bequeathed to him an
annuity of �2OO, and also the use and enjoyment during his
life of the library, herbarium, manuscripts, drawings, &c.
He also bequeathed to F. Bauer (the eminent artist and
companion of Brown who had been in Sir Joseph's em-
ployment for thirty years) an annuity of �3OO on condition
of his continuing to delineate the flowers at Kew. Bauer?s
illustrations of Australian flowers have always been valued
for their elegance and accuracy, and being made under
the direction of BroWn exhibited the organic peculiarities
on which the great botanist based his system. Few men
a 2


have gained a more honourable reputation in the paths of
science than R. Brown, and his name will ever be associated
with the Flora of Australia in the appropriate terms by
which he designated many of its genera. Contemporaneously
with this distinguished man, George Caley was sent out to
New South Wales by Sir Joseph Banks, and resided in the
colony from 1800 to 1810. During that period he collected
400 specimens of plants, and advanced farther into the
interior than any previous explorer, having penetrated as
far as Caley?s Repulse (near the present Numantias) some
years before the Blue Mountains were crossed by Went-
worth, Blaxland, and Lawson. His correspondence with
Sir Joseph is preserved in the Brahourne Papers. It is
recorded of him that ?his primary duties in New South
Wales were the collecting of plants for his patron
and seeds for the garden at Kew; but so greatly did he
extend his field of action that the most splendid portion of
the Museum of the Linnean Society consists of quadrupeds,
birds, and reptiles, collected by his indefatigable energy.?
Brown named the genus Caleana after him ? as a skilled and
accurate botanist.?
The surveys of Admiral King in the intertropical and
western coasts of Australia between 1818 and 1822 did much
to promote the advancement of botanical knowledge. More-
over, and at the especial request of Sir Joseph Banks,
Allan Cunningham accompanied the expeditions and made
valuable collections of plants, especially on the North-
west shores of Australia. His remarks on these plants
appended to King?s voyages reveal a multitude of new forms
hitherto unknown to science. The interior of the colony
having been opened up by the passage over the Blue Moun-
tains in 1813, Cunningham was able to penetrate farther into
the interior than any of his predecessors, and whilst Oxley
was tracing the Lachlan and Macquarie Rivers, he traversed
1,200 miles and collected 450 species of plants. But Cunning-
ham was more than an accomplished botanist, and as an
enterprising explorer must ever rank amongst those who have
exerted themselves to extend the geographical knowledge
of the continent. His discoveries in the northern parts of
the colony, now part of Queensland, tended to facilitate com-
munication with what was then called ? the back country ?
and to prepare the way for profitable settlement. He was
not, however, fortunate in his relations with the Colonial
Government of the day, Governor MACQUARIE having failed


to render him that assistance which was necessary for the
furtherance of his pursuits and the development of Australia?s
resources. Nor was he more fortunate in the valuable speci-
mens forwarded to England, many of which were not utilised
until the publication of the Flora Austral! ensis. Mr. BENTHAM
in alluding to the matter remarks, ?the rich herbarium collected
at the public expense by the late A. Cunningham in his various
expeditions were stowed away, many of them for a quarter
to half a century, unarranged in their original parcels, with-
out any thought of providing the staff and funds necessary
to render them of use to scientific botanists.? When at
length these collections Avere examined, they were found
to be of the greatest importance in the preparation ot the
Flora, and Mr. Bentham acknowledged that, in their variety
and extent, they were second only to those of R. Brown.
Cunningham?s health had been impaired by his zeal in col-
lecting, especially in tropical climates where the thermometer
ranged from 105� to 115� in the shade, and although by
visiting New Zealand and parts of the Australian continent
in search of iicav plants he seemed for awhile to regain
somewhat of his former energy, his health gradually declined
and Avhen I saAv him about a year before his death ho
appeared to have become prematurely old. He died in
Sydney in 1839 at the age of 48, nearly twenty years before
his great predecessor R. Brown Avho had attained the
advanced age of 86. With the death of Cunningham, the
first period of botanical discovery in Australia may be said
to have closed, and for many years notwithstanding the
Amyages of navigators and the expeditions of explorers
little was done to place on any connected record the
valuable information which they had acquired respecting
Australian plants, or to arrange them in any systematic
form. Such plants were described in appendices to voyages
and travels not accessible to the general public, or noticed
only in papers read before learned societies, so that the
greatest uncertainty prevailed as to the number and dis-
tribution of species. Thus Brown?s great work of .1810, with
his subsequent additions, remained the oidy reliable standards
of Australian botany.
The arrival of Ferdinand von Mueller in Australia
formed a neAv era in the history of its flora, and the present
advancement of systematic botany in the Australian colonies
must be attributed principally to his exertions and to those
of the numerous amateurs and collectors whom he in-


spired by his writings and labours. Dr. von Mueller, now
Baron F. VON Mueller, commenced his career on Australian
territory in 1852, and first in South Australia, and subse-
quently in Victoria traversed not only all the settled dis-
tricts of those colonies, but also instituted many geographic
explorations in the Australian Alps, which at that time were
but little known. He likewise accompanied A. C. Gregory
during his expedition in tropical Australia, and at a later
period visited Western Australia and reported on its Forest
Vegetation. Like Cunningham, therefore, my eminent
friend whose career I have watched for many years, may be
regarded as an explorer, though from the time uf his landing in
Australia his main work has been the elaboration of its
flora. With this view he not only made large collec-
tions of specimens personally, but by means of agents, either
paid or unpaid, in the various Australian colonies, lie
amassed an herbarium unequalled in any part of the world
for the number and variety of its species. Having such
material at his disposal, he conceived the plan of publishing
in a connected form a description of all known Australian
plants. Such a work was certainly much needed. No such
work had been attempted since the days of Brown, and
although according to his computation, the number of
Australian plants was supposed to be about 7,000, many of
them were but little known, or only partially described in
the works of various authors. Whilst the Baron was con-
templating the preparation of such a publication, Mr.
BenthaM, the great botanist of the age, had also conceived a
similar idea, and was actually corresponding with the late
W. S. M.AOLEAY, F.R.S., on the subject. When the difficulties
of publishing the Flora in the colony were duly weighed?
especially those arising from want of access to typical
specimens, the notes and drawings of early botanists,
and the opinions of European scientists?it was agreed,
principally through the efforts of Mr. Macleay, that the work
should be published in England, and that Baron von Mueller
should assist in the preparation of the same. This great
undertaking was commenced in 1863, and the seventh
volume was finished in 1878, so that the Flora Australienai s
contains a full description of all Australian plants which
were known to the authors at the time of publication.
Since the completion of the Flora Australiensis new species
have been described by the Baron in his Fragmenta Fhyto-
graphiai Australia (of which eleven volumes have been

published), and in other works printed in Victoria; whilst
a list of Australian plants comprising the most recent dis-
coveries has been prepared by the Baron in his Census,
1889, Part L, Vasculares ; 7,814 species being admitted from
the Flora, and 1,025 being added by the author. Irrespec-
tive of introduced plants which now amount to nearly 200,
the number of species is probably 9,000, and these according
to the Baron?s Census, to which I am so much indebted, are
distributed in the following manner :
These numbers include the species common to the different
colonies, whilst of Australian plants common to other regions,
the following species are recorded :
The distribution of the species as enumerated by the
Baron is highly suggestive. In Western Australia where
purely Australian plants appear in their greatest profusion,
the numbers are proportionately great, and they represent
not only species but whole genera which are not repiesented
in other parts of Australia. It is difficult to explain the
cause of this phenomenon on the ground of soil or climate,
but it is probably due to changes which occurred at some
remote period when Australia instead of being one vast
continent consisted of several islands, or at all events,
portions of it were separated by water. As regards the
flora of Australia in general, Mr. Bentham was of opinion
that the great mass of purely Australian species must have
originated or been differentiated in Australia and never
spread far out of it, and that whilst the plants of Queens-
land and Northern Australia have an Asiatic character
those of Victoria and Tasmania, especially in the Alpine
regions, were connected through New Zealand with those of
the Southern end of South America.
The order Tremandreae, of which only seventeen species
are known (F v M), is exclusively Australian, and most of
these are Western plants. Goodenoviem, with 220 species
(F. v M.). is represented out of Australia by a solitary genus
(Scsevola), and though allied in some respects to other


orders, it is characterised by its singular indusium. The
Epacridese, of which 275 species are described (F v M), is
almost entirely Australian, and takes the place of Heath worts,
from which it is distinguished principally by the shape and
openings of the anthers. In the order Dilleniaceas, only two
species of Hibbertia are known out of Australia, whilst
Pachynema is limited to the N. and W. of the continent.
The curious order Stylidese is, with one exception, entirely
Australian and represented by 97 species (F. v M.), the
structure of the inflorescence being more analogous to that
of orchids than anything else in the vegetable kingdom.
The Proteacese are a large order in Australia (597 sp.
F. v M.) most of the genera not extending beyond it; and
the peculiar character of the species, differing as they do
widely from each other in appearance, soon attracted the
notice of the early settlers, and under the inappropriate
names of ? Native Tulip,? ? Wooden Pear,? ?Honeysuckle,?
? Beefwood,? ? Silky Oak,? &c., became known to the
colonists for the singularity of their flowers and fruit, or for
some property which distinguished the wood. The extent
and distribution of the order were but partially known
before the publication of the Flora, for many of the Northern
genera were not described in the days of Brown and Cunning-
ham. nor was it supposed that the species generally were of
any great utility.
In the extensive order of Leguminosas, comprising some
1,100 species (F. v M.), the genus Acacia, of which nearly
300 passed in review before Mr. Bentham, has recently
received good illustration in the figures published by Baron
von Mueller. The genus, though well marked is a difficult
one to arrange in sections, and therefore the labours of the
Baron in this direction will be appreciated by botanists as
affording characters for classification.
Of the Myrtacese, no genus has given more trouble to
botanists than that of Eucalyptus, and it may truly be said
that previous to the publication of the Flora, the system of
classification was not only unsatisfactory, but that even the
names of the commonest species were uncertain. The
labours of Bentham and Mueller have done much to correct
the errors of former botanists, and to suggest methods for
the better grouping of species ; but to the latter belongs
exclusively the merit of furnishing illustrations and descrip-
tions of the most remarkable species, and of making known
the uses of their wood, resin, bark, volatile oil, &c. In the


early part of the century only twelve species were recorded
by botanists, but now probably 150 have been found in
different parts of Australia, and of these 100 may be
recognized in the figures of the Baron?s Eucalyptographia.
Of Myoporinse the same author records seventy-six species,
chiefly Australian, and two genera exclusively so (Pholidia
and Eremophila). Here again the Baron has contributed to
a correct knowledge of Australian botany by his elegant
figures, seventy-four in number, including several species ot
Eremophila which are worthy of a place in any con-
servatory.
Though not principally Australian, the species of Salso-
lacese are highly important as furnishing forage plants to
sheep and cattle in dry seasons. Many of these the Baron
has also figured with a view of aiding pastoralists and
graziers in the identification of species, and of ascertaining
how far the prevalence of certain plants of the order may
enhance the value of runs. In the early days of the colony
Bauer?s drawings were very useful in making known some
of the beauties of the Flora, but these have been far sur-
passed in number and extent by the figures published by the
Baron, including not only Eucalypts, Acacias, Myoporinous
and Salsolaceous plants, but also many species of the Flora
generally which have economic or useful properties. The
extension of botanical knowledge has led to the discovery of
many plants remarkable not merely for ornamental purposes,
but for commercial and medicinal value.
The various kinds of Australian timber are now much
better known in Europe than before the publication of the
Flora, for they can be identified by their scientific names.
Formerly some of the best woods were transmitted to
England with nothing attached to them but popular names,
which, though understood in the districts from which they
were sent, were unintelligible to European purchasers.
The two great orders Leguminosse and Myrtacese furnish
specimens of wood not to be surpassed in strength and
durability. Castanospermum australe (A. Cunn.) is remarkable
for the large quantity of dark-coloured heartwood that it
produces, and BarMya Syringifolia (F. v M.) for its very
tough grain; whilst the genus Acacia affords numerous
species which can be utilised for the beauty and hardness of
their wood, the tanning properties of their bark and the
copiousness of their gums.
Amongst the Myrtacem the vast genus Eucalyptus is dis-


tinguished for the various kinds of wood which can be
applied to practical purposes, such as house-building,
fencing, railway sleepers, naves, felloes and spokes of wheels,
staves of casks, piles, handles, cabinet work, &c. Some of
the species yield valuable bark and resin, while others are
becoming favourite trees for plantations in different parts of
the world on account of their absorbing properties and the
influence which they exercise on the atmosphere. In the
same order also certain species of Melaleuca, Angophora ,
Tristania , Syncarpia and Eugenia are valued for their woods ;
but none are more highly esteemed than those of the
Meliaceai or Cedar family, of which the lied Cedar ( Cedrela
australis, F. v M.) is most admired and the most generally
used by cabinet-makers. Dgsoxylon and Flindersia of the
same family are utilised for similar purposes. Ceratopetalum
apetalum (Don) of the Saxifragese, Trochocarpa laurina
(11. Br.), and Monotoca elliptica (11. Br.) of the Epacridem,
and many other species allied to them are employed by
artisans. On the whole, now that the woods of Australia
are becoming better known, it is found that the unfavourable
reports furnished by the early colonists were formed from a
very limited knowledge of the Australian forests. The
progress which has been made in this respect is very evident
from a comparison of the woods collected by the late Sir
William Macarthur for the Universal Exhibition of 1867,
with the lists recently furnished (1888) by Mr. F. M. Bailey,
F.L.S. In the former, the Eucalypts and many others
appear chiefly with popular names, whilst in the latter they
are arranged according to their respective orders, genera,
and species as given in the Flora or in the Census of Baron
von Mueller.
Many species of Eucalyptus contain medicinal properties.
Gum kino has long been known to the scientific world, and
volatile oil distilled from gum leaves was used by the early
colonists. The aboriginal inhabitants were aware of the
therapeutic virtues of Eucalypt leaves and the efficacy of the
liquid kino exuding from Angophora, but it remained for
more recent times to discover the wonderful properties of
E. globulus (Labilh), and to secure for Folia Eucalypti, Oleum
Eucalypti, and Eucalyptol , a place in the Pharmacopeeia.
Many species of Acacia have astringent properties, and a
decoction of their bark is used in cases of diarrhoea and
dysentery, and also to make embrocations for the cure of
cutaneous disorders. Alstonia constricta (F. v M.j is used as


FAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE OF THE AUSTRALIAN FLORA,
a febrifuge by persons in the interior, and the so called
?Sassafras Tree/? Atherosperma moschaturn (Labilh), and
Doryphora Sassafras (Endl.) are employed medicinally as
tonic. The bark of Cedrela australis (F. v M.) has been
regarded as a substitute for Cinchona, and Chionanthus
picrophloia (F. v M.) used in fevers. Duhoisia sulphas, said to be
procured from the leaves of D. myoporoides (R. Br.), has been
introduced into the Pharmacopeia as a remedy for ophthalmia.
The intoxicating properties of this species were known to the
blacks, but Dr. Bancroft, an eminent physician of Brisbane,
was the first to set forth in an elaborate paper, read before the
Philosophical Society in 1872, the remarkable properties of
i). lloptcoodii (F. v M.), or ? Pituri ? of the blacks, which is
much more powerful in its effects on the human system,
Erythrcea australis (R. Br.), and Sehoea ovata (R. Br.), have
some of the properties of gentian, and Mentha satureoides
(R. Br.) is considered as tonic. Euphorbia pilulifera (Linn.)
has been found useful in certain stages of asthma, and
Myriogyne minuta (Less) as a popular remedy for ophthalmia.
Petalostigrna quadriloculare (F. v M.) has a bitter principle
resembling that of quinine, and Melaleuca genistifolia (Sm.)
yields an oil similar to cajeput. In the early days of the
colony the leaves of Leptospermum were used as an anti-
scorbutic, and those of Smilax glycyphylla (Sm.), the sar-
saparilla of the colonists, as- ? sweet tea.? It is to be
regretted that much of the knowledge possessed by the
blacks respecting the medicinal and other properties of
indigenous plants has perished with them in the colony of
New South Wales, but Mr. E. Palmer, M.P. of Queensland, has
collected some interesting information on this subject from
the blacks of Northern Queensland (see his Paper read
before the Royal Society of New South Wales, August, 1883).
Baron Mueller, amidst his multifarious engagements, has
devoted some attention to the same subject (see Documents
relating to the Intercolonial Exhibition, 1867), and Dr.
Bancroft has done much in reference to Duhoisia Hopwoodii
(F. v M.), and Xanihoxylum venejicum (Bailey).
The singularity and beauty of Australian plants soon
attracted the notice of the early voyagers and settlers, and
the seeds of many species found their way to European
conservatories. Dampier?s specimens were forgotten for a
while, but Bauer?s drawings (made under the auspices of Sir
Joseph Banks) and those in the appendix to White?s Voyage
to New South Wales, encouraged a taste for Australian species,


whilst the seeds and plants collected by Banks and Solander
during Cook?s voyage, were soon cultivated at Kew and
elsewhere in Europe. In looking over a list of Australian
plants as known in the last century, that is, twelve years
after the foundation of the colony of New South Wales, it will
be seen that the knowledge of the Flora was very limited.
Taking the four orders Leguminosee, Myrtacese, Proteacem,
and Epacrideas as illustrative of the fact, it will be found
that of the first 39, of the second 44, of the third 30, and of
the fourth 8 species only were then known in Europe, Many
of these were collected and forwarded under circumstances
of difficulty, for owing to the want of provisions in the early
days of the colony, the dangers arising from penetrating into
an unknown country, and the deficiency of proper material
for drying and preserving specimens, little idea can be formed
of the labours encountered by the earliest naturalists in
Australia. Moreover, the voyage to Europe in those days
occupied many months, numbers of plants perishing in trans-
mission, while seeds damaged by salt water or long keeping
were of course useless for the purposes of cultivation.
It may be interesting, as showing the limited knowledge
of Australian plants at the period indicated, to refer particu-
larly to the species described in the work of Willdenow
published between the years 1797 and 1810. Willdenow was
the great systematic botanist of his day, the follower of the
renowned Linnaeus, and the editor of his Species Plan-
tarum. His work, therefore, is
safely b6 quoted as showing how
ledge in reference to Australian
continental botanists before th
Frodromus. The species are ami:

When Willdenow?s list of Australian plants is compared
with the descriptions giY T en in the seven volumes of the
Flora Australiensis and the eleven volumes of Fragmenta by
Baron von Mueller, as well as with the Census of Australian
plants by the same author, some idea may be formed of the
wonderful progress which has been made in Australian
botany since the beginning of the century. From 1800 to
18 U), Caley continued the great work of collecting speci-
mens and of developing the rarities of a new Flora; but it
remained for Allan Cunningham to traverse parts of Australia
unknown to his predecessors and to transmit to Europe
seeds and plants not previously discovered. He was a man
of taste and energy, and from his arrival in 1816 to his death
in 1839, he exerted himself to promote the great object of
his mission, first as ? Botanical Collector to the Royal Garden
at Few,? and subsequently as Colonial Botanist and Director
of the Botanical Garden in Sydney. In these capacities he
did much to develop the resources of Australia, and as settle-
ments were being established in Western and Southern
Australia, as well as at Port Phillip (now Victoria), the extent
and variety of the Australian Flora became more and more
manifest through the labours of professional or amateur
botanists, and a new industry, viz., that of collecting seeds
for exportation to different parts of the Yvorld, was estab-
lished in the colony. Thus, in various ways, continual
additions were made to the knowledge of Australian plants ;
and as their floral beauties increased under the fostering
care of cultivation, they have obtained a favourable place in
the greenhouses and hot houses of Europe.
It is only of late, as already noticed, that the extent of
the Flora has been fully known, for until the publication of
Baron von Mueller?s Census, the number of species and their
respective distribution were matters of uncertainty. Now


the numbers, so far as species have yet been discovered,
are carefully estimated, and each plant is referred by
systematic arrangement to its proper genus with the date of
its discovery and its distribution in the Australian colonies.
All plants have their places in the economy of nature and
serve the purposes for which they were designed by a bene-
ficent Creator, but, in the eyes of men, some species are
more ornamental than others, better adapted for cultivation,
and whilst ? arrayed in robes of lovely hue ? indicate ? a
Father?s care ? even to those who do not study the mysteries
of organism or the symmetry of proportion. The order
Legurainosse with 1065, the Myrtacese with 663, the Proteaceas
with 597, the Composite with 380, the Epacridise with 275,
and the Orchideas with 271 species, afford numerous instances
of this kind. Amongst the Leguminosse, Australia is rich in
plants herbaceous, shrubby, or arborescent. Clianthus JJam-
pieri, the various species of Swainsonia, Crotalaria, Kennedy a,
Oxylohium , Indigofera , Cassia , and Bauhinia, are now reckoned
amongst garden plants, whilst the genus Acacia, affording in
itself examples of minute elegance or robust stature, is
adapted alike for the shubbery or the plantation. Of the
larger species of Leguminosee, Castanospermum australe,
Barklya syringifolia, Pithecololnurn pruinosvm, and Alhizzia
canescens are beautiful trees and capable of enduring a con-
siderable amount of variation in temperature. The Myrtaceac
also are of all sizes from the minute Ikeckia to the gigantic
Eucalypt. Western Australia abounds in elegant species of
Fringe Myrtles ( Darwinia , Verticordia , Calythrix , cfc.) , small
shrubs remarkable for their calyx adhering to the ovary and
breaking into fringes or extended into bristles. These are
much admired in cultivation. There may also be mentioned
as peculiar to the West, species of Eegelia and Beaufortia ,
whilst those of Callisternon, Melaleuca, and Leptospermum may
be found in varying proportions in Eastern and Western
Australia, enlivening the bush with their white, purple, or
crimson flowers. The large genus Eucalyptus has in the
Southern and Western Colonies some species distinguished
from others by their showy crimson flowers, E. f cifolia (F.
v M.), and E. calophylla (R. Br.) may be reckoned amongst
the marvellous beauties of the genus, whilst as Baron Mueller
observes, B. phcenicia (F. v M.) and E. rniniata (Cunn .) vie
with them in ornamental splendour. The species generally
are not very umbrageous, but E. rohusta (Sm.) and a few
others are exceptional in this respect, and E. glolndus (Labill.),


the far famed ?Blue Gum? of Tasmania, is remarkable for
the rapidity of its growth. Few trees in Eastern Australia
afford a more grateful shade than the gnarled and spreading
Angophora, the larger species of which may be termed
? Rain-trees ? on account of the drops of water which at
certain seasons fall from their leaves. Several species of
Eugenia (a genus also not extending to Western Australia)
are likely to be cultivated for the beauty of their foliage
and flowers, as well as for the flavour of their fruits.
The Proteacese furnish some of the most singular species
in the Vegetable Kingdom. The ?Wooden Pear? (Xylo-
melum pyriforme, Knight), the ?Native Tulip? ( Telopea
speciosissima, R. Br.), esteemed as the most splendid of
Australian flowers, and the peculiarity of Bryandra and
Banksia were looked upon as great novelties in the early days
of New South Wales, and figures of them were soon published
in Europe. In later days, Grevillea, Ilakea, and Steno-
carpus have each of them found a place in shrubberies, and
few gardens are destitute of the most noted species; whilst
Buckinghamia celsissima (F. v M.), and Darlmgia specta-
tissirna (F. v M.) ?some of ?the recent discoveries in
Northern Queensland ?are finding favour in southern culti-
vation so for as the climate permits. The great order of
the Composites, of which many species are inconspicuous
herbs or mere weeds, does not offer proportionally many
plants for cultivation, but a few of the ? everlasting ? kind
(such as Ilelipterum Manglesii (F v M), 11. roseum (Benth.),
Helichrysum eiatum , Cunn., and 11. bracteatum (Willd.), and
some of the Asters, including the ?Musk-tree,? A. argophyllus
(Labilh), and A. dentatus (Andr.), may be regarded as excep-
tional. Br achy come , Calotis, and Minuria comprise some
very pretty species which might be utilised for borders, and
Cassinia aurea (R. Br.), C. spectabilis (R. Br.), and Ilurnea
elegans (Sm.), are much larger plants and not unknown in
European collections. The Epacrids, which in Australia
take the place of Heaths, have attracted attention for the
last century, and under cultivation many species have im-
proved in appearance or have become double. The
following may be especially noticed: ?
Epacris longiflora (Cav.)
? impressa (Labill.)
? purpurascens (R. Br.)
? microphylla (R. Br.)
Styphelia adscendens (R. Br.)
? tubiflora (Sm,)
Styphelia triflora (Andr.)
Andersonia sprengelioides (R. Br.)
Sprengelia incarnata (Sm.)
Lysinema, Leucopogon, and Astrn-
loma in several species.


The larger or more shrubby species of Bichea and Draco-
phyllum are mostly Alpine plants, and have a monocotyledo-
nous aspect, some rising to the height of thirty or forty feet.
D. Fitzgeraldi (F. v M.), of Lord Howe?s Island, is perhaps
the most remarkable of the order, attaining a height of ninety
feet, and having leaves a foot or more in length. Paxton
speaks of the smaller Epacrids as ? very elegant greenhouse
plants,? and Sir W. Macarthur used to say that, if anyone
desired to see them in perfection, he must visit the European
c jnservatories. Australian orchids, though not to be compared
with those of the East and West Indies or the warmer parts
of America in point of numbers, variety, or brilliancy, yet
present on the whole many features of structural beauty and
organic peculiarity whereby they commend themselves to
the artist and the botanist. It is true that many of the
species are minute plants, terrestrial in habit, and appearing
only for a few short weeks in spring, but even these, when
viewed microscopically, give the scientist the means of
studying the various modes of fertilisation, the agencies
whereby nature secures the perpetuation of species, and the
links which seem to connect one form with another. The
late much lamented Mr. K. D. Fitzgerald, F.L.S., in his
splendid work on Australian Orchids , figured nearly two-
thirds of all known species some terrestrial, and some
epiphytal and although the majority may not interest the
casual observer the following must be regarded as worthy
of consideration for their size

~ grandijlora (Fitz.)

Many of the smaller species figured by Mr. Fitzgerald are
peculiar to Australia, but as here and there species occur
which are not limited to that continent, they form, as it were,
a connection between the botany of Australia and other
regions, which, at some remote period, were not separated
from it by the intervening ocean. All the species, however,
as yet figured, illustrate amply an interesting portion of the


flora, and will long continue as memorials of the author?s
artistic skill.
The Goodeniacese, Maloacese, and Liliacese, have numerous
representatives in most parts of Australia. The elegant
Leschenaultia splendens (Hook.), with its characteristic stigma,
the pretty and strongly scented Boronia serrulata (Sm.), and
B. megastigma (Nees), the gigantic Borganthes excelsa (Corr.j,
and the pure Crinum , the showy species of Hibiscus and
Gossypium ?all of these display the glory of their respective
orders. So also the rivers of the North are enhvened by
the variously coloured petals of Nymphcea gigantea (Hook.),
and the delicate tints of Nelurnhium speciosum (Willd.) ; whilst
the lofty conifers Araucaria Gunninghami (Ait.), and A. Bid-
willii (Hook.), and the palm-like tree ferns ( Alsopldla australis,
R. Hr., and A. excelsa, R. Br.), impart a semi-tropical character
to the regions in which they abound. Of the true palms,
Ptychosperma Gunninghami (Wend!.), and Livistona australis
(F. v M.) are rapidly disappearing in the settled districts;
but in unfrequented places in Northern Queensland, and also
at Lord Howe?s Island, several species of Ptychosperma and
Kentia still flourish in all their graceful beauty.
Great changes are going on in the Vegetable Kingdom
throughout the world, and though many of those changes
are not perceptible to the present generation, a reference to
past history will inform us that regions once covered with
forests have become desolate wildernesses, and unfruitful soil
has been made subservient to the purposes of cultivation,
and that species of plants which once flourished in some
particular country have long ceased to do so. What occurred
in geological periods, when, by the uplifting or depression of
the earth?s crust, the flora of many countries became
differentiated or made way for other forms, is going on
gradually still ; and it is certain that, in the course of genera-
tions to come, as the flora of Australia was very different in
ages past from what it uoav is, so a new order of plants may
arise and take the place of the great orders which at the
present period flourish on the continent. A reference to the
vegetable fossils which have been found in the auriferous
drifts of New South Wales and Victoria makes this supposi-
tion highly probable.
Without contemplating, however, those stupendous changes
which must have occurred since many genera, now called
exotic, connected the tertiary Flora of Australia with that of
northern and tropical America and Oceanica (Ettinghausen),


the experience of the past century affords some indication of
changes which may yet be realised. Since the British landed
on the shores of Australia m 1788, the work of destruction
has been going on amongst indigenous plants. That
destruction was, no doubt, in operation when as yet the white
man had not set his foot on the land, for the destroying
tempest, the ravages of insect pests, the periodical fires in
the bush and the alternation of flood and drought, had
exercised their influence on the vegetation independently of
the slow and imperceptible changes arising from climatic and
geologic considerations. With the advent, however, of the
white man in Australia a new era commenced in its Flora and
henceforth the process of cultivation, the introduction of
foreign plants, either accidentally or designedly, and in some
instances the wanton destruction of certain species, have all
combined to impart a novel character to the Flora of the
settled districts, and of initiating a mollified system of vege-
table growth whereby the old has sometimes made way for
the new, or the new and the old have become strangely
associated together.
When the first settlers landed at Port Jackson the native
forest appeared in its primeval grandeur, and numerous
species of shrubs and flowers greeted their wondering gaze
with novel forms of vegetation. This state of things did
not long continue. Large trees many probably the growth
of centuries fell before the workman?s axe for the purposes
of building, fencing, and burning; whilst the smaller plants
were soon cleared away as useless impediments in the way of
cultivation. In many countries there are wild fruits and
vegetables which can be utilised by the settler, dhis was
not the case with that part of Australia where Sydney now
stands, and therefore one of the earliest objects of the
colonists was to clear the ground for the cultivation of such
plants as were considered suitable for food. In doing this a
great destruction of native plants ensued, and now after the
lapse of a century it is impossible to find some of the plants
which Brown and the early botanists described as occurring
in the neighbourhood of Sydney, whilst streets of houses or
cultivated spots occupy the area where the towering Eucalypt,
the curious Protead, the lovely Epacrid, or the host of
delicate orchids, once reigned in undisturbed varieties. Ihe
introduction also of foreign plants has had a wonderful
influence in destroying the native vegetation, and as the
population spread further from the coast, the same result


occurred in a greater or less degree, so that in all the settled
districts the Flora began to assume a mixed character. Nor
has this arisen solely from the introduction of esculent
plants adapted to the soil and climate. Many species have
found their way over the ocean and established themselves
in an accidental manner, or as following the steps of civilised
man.
Wherever the land has been turned up the so-called couch
grass ( Cynodon dactylon Pers.) has taken the place of other
grasses, and from Port Jackson to the Blue Mountains it has
become very useful as fodder, though in gardens it is regarded
as a great nuisance. So also Brown?s Paspalum littorale
(referred to P. distichum, Linn.), which in the early days was
limited to the sea coast, now flourishes on the cultivated
flats of our Eastern Rivers; whilst Cyperus rotundus (Linn.),
which in the days of Caley (1810) was known only in the
Government garden at Parramatta, has become an intolerable
nuisance to many gardens in N.S. Wales. It is astonishing
to notice how various species of Rumex and Amarantus have
encroached on cultivated fields, and how in some instances
the native plants have been smothered by such Composites
as Wedelia hispida (Ktl), Aster dumosus (Willd.j, or different
species of Centaurea, Carduus Marionus (Linn.), Crypto-
stemina calendidaceum (R. Br.), and two species of Hypechceris.
In alluding to this subject the late Rev. J. E. Tenison-Woods,
F.L.S. (a learned man of varied scientific attainments),
remarks: ? The features of Australian Vegetation are also
being altered by introduced plants. Rubus rubiginosa , or
the Sweet Brier, has taken kindly to the arid western table-
land, and covers the ground for miles with a dense thicket,
which it is difficult to eradicate. It is worse than either
the thistle or burr ( Xanthium ). The sweet brier is an
equally troublesome pest in Tasmania. On the east side of
the range, Verbena Bonariensis and Asclepias curassarica?
both garden plants from America?are troublesome weeds.
We have also an unexplained spread of an indigenous
tropical plant ( Sida rhombifolia), which infests good soil to an
alarming extent. Every year also we have to chronicle the
spread of some common European weed which very easily
overcomes the native vegetation.?'' In some places Lantana
Camara (Linn.), and in others several species of Opientia are
detrimental to cultivation, whilst in gardens the ordinary
species of Euphorbia , Stellaria, Cerastium , Maloa, and Sisym-
brium, spring up in great abundance. Contemporaneously,


with the introduction of foreign plants, the gradual extinction
of native species has been accelerated by the increase of
sheep and cattle which feed on the more delicate plants, the
wanton destruction of floral beauties for flower shows and
decorative purposes, and the wholesale slaughter of Eucalypts
by ring-barking. Some years ago the Cabbage Palm and the
Tree Fern flourished in the vicinity of Sydney, and many
orchids which once sprang up where the city and its
suburbs have usurped the soil, have ceased to do so.
Change, therefore, is stamped on the Flora of Australia, and
though the change is more perceptible in the oldest of
the colonies than in those recently established, it is evident
that as the white man has extended his operations, so
in proportion native shrubs have become less frequent.
And this is quite independent of the fact that from some
cause or other whole forests of Eucalypts have perished.
Whether this has arisen from insects, opossums, flood and
drought, or from fungi, has not been clearly ascertained, but
such destruction must materially affect the Flora, even sup-
posing that when the causes of destruction have been
removed, the larger species spring up again. But perhaps in
process of time as the ? Select Plants ? recommended by Baron
Mueller for industrial purposes spread over the country,
it may be found that some species are likely to prove more
serviceable than the stunted kinds of Eucalypt which now
prevail in certain parts of the -country, and forests of new
and valuable trees may take the place of those which under
other conditions have long been cumberers of the ground.
And this leads to another matter of infinite importance to the
development of the coming Flora, viz., the extensive plant-
ing of forests under the direction of the respective Colonial
Governments. This subject has been ably explained in the
Baron?s Forest Resources of Western Australia , and if only a
small portion of the trees which he has suggested for cultiva-
tion in that part of Australia now become acclimatised, it is
evident that they will produce a great revolution in the
Flora, not merely affecting the general appearance of the
country, but ?as the rainfall of a country depends in a great
measure upon the abundance of its trees ? (Sinai and Palestine,
by the Rev. F. W. Holland), an increased moisture would
lead to the introduction of many smaller plants which need
shade and rain for their growth. Ancient Phoenicia, ?the
land of palms,? furnished it is said, an example of the
advantages arising from the existence of forests. Lying
b 2


under the shadow of Lebanon, it abounded in streams,
streamlets, and rivers; the last then navigable for some
distance from the sea, by reason of the greater flow of water
caused by the primeval forests which in those days clothed
the neighbouring mountains. The plantation of forests will
no doubt exercise an influence in many ways, and especially
in reference to the Flora; but probably the process of irriga-
tion, which in another half century will be carried on in the
arid and sterile regions of the West, is destined to produce
still greater changes. Irrigation was much practised by the
ancient nations, and the ruins of former works still exist in
parts of the East to testify to its utility. What was done in
Egypt, Persia, and India, may therefore be done in Australia,
and the means of subsistence for the population may be
indefinitely increased. It is calculated that the extent of
irrigated land in the Valley of the Po may be about 1,600,000
acres, and the increase of rental thus caused �830,000,
Such irrigation, not to speak of the immense advantages in
a commercial and financial point of view, must have had great
influence on the vegetation of Southern Europe, and it is not
too much to expect that a periodical watering of the land
and the formation of extensive lakes in the dry parts of
Australia would cause many an elegant shrub or useful
herbaceous plant to flourish where now only harsh and
unpalatable species occur.
Whilst dwelling on the Flora of the future it is only
reasonable to expect that the uses of many plants only par-
tially known will be more appreciated than they are at
present, and that many articles of vegetable origin, which
are now imported at considerable expense, will be found to
exist in Australia. This may be especially true of medicinal
plants. The country abounds in such species, and numerous
kinds, which hereafter may find a place in the Pharmacopoeia ,
are but imperfectly known by the settlers. The Medical
Botany of Australia affords a fine field for the inquiries of the
specialist, and so a similar region of investigation remains
for those whose tastes may lead them to the study of
Cryptogamic Botany. What Harvey has done for Austra-
lian Algm is a noble contribution to the knowledge of
Marine Beauties, and it is to be hoped, that in the botany of
the future, thousands of minute species in the lower king-
doms of Nature may find a local habitation and a name in
the Flora of Australia.
Other subjects in connection with the progress of botany


?such as the nomenclature of the Flora, the distinction
between species and variety, the simplification and division
of genera, and the rearrangement of natural orders?remain
yet to be considered. Any one who reads the preface to
Lindley?s work on the Vegetable Kingdom will see how
anxious the Professor was to improve the nomenclature of
botany and to suppress as far as practicable names of
unusual dimensions and difficult to pronounce. Though
something has already been done in this direction, it is still
desirable to effect further improvements, for such long words
as Ceratopetalmn apetnlum , Aphanopetalum resinosum, Amorpho-
phallus variabilis, Amorphospermurn antilogum , and Tabernce-
montana orientalis, show that notwithstanding the changes
effected by Bentham and Mueller, the nomenclature of
the Australian Flora needs reform. Words formed from
Latin or Greek, expressive of some feature peculiar to a
species, are certainly the most suitable for general use, and
are understood by the educated in all countries, but then
such words should be limited to a few syllables, and, if
possible, be euphonious. But long names, especially as
specific, are frequently complained of, and none more so than
those in honour of some great man. Much as many of the
Baron?s names may be admired for their elegance and
expressiveness, one can scarcely defend Kentia Belmoreana , K.
Canterbury ana, K. Wendlandiana , K. Forsleriana , or Euca-
lyptus Planchoniana, and F. Foelscheana, on the ground of
brevity or expressiveness. But the illustrious author of the
Prodromus was not altogether free from a similar charge,
though only to a limited extent, for in order to immoitalise
the names of those whom he delighted to honour we have
the genera Bellendema, Ft anklandia, Levenhookia, and Besch-
enaultia, names certainly derived from distinguished authors
and botanists, but not calculated to improve the nomencla-
ture of science. There may be exceptional cases, in which
men from the pre-eminent position they have held, seem
entitled to every distinction, but as a general rule the
naming of genera after some noble or learned person teaches
nothing bv which a genus is characterised, nor can it be done
on all occasions without making invidious distinctions. It
must be left, therefore, for botanists of the future to decide
whether it is better to make the Flora an instrument of
personal glorification, or to impress on genera such names as
may guide the student in his endeavour to trace out the
differences of natural objects. The multiplication of hard
b 3


words, whether of classic or of personal origin, is the source
of frequent complaint against botany, and needs reform, but
in correcting one error care must be taken not to fall into
another, for the adoption of popular names, such as some
persons suggest, would be of little service beyond an English-
speaking community, nor would they escape the charge of
leading to confusion in a country in which different districts
call the same thing by different names.
The distinction between species and varieties is a matter
of greater difficulty for the botanist of the future. In days
past, perhaps, botanists were too fond of increasing the
number of species, considering that every character in
species was fixed, and that every deviation from some
original type was to be regarded as distinct. Experience
has proved that certain species are subject to a vast amount
of variation; that surrounding circumstances (such as soil,
climate, and elevation above the sea-level) tend to perpetuate
such differences; and that cultivation in some instances
produces abnormal forms not simply in size and colour, but
in marked features. Such being the case, it happens that
what some botanists regard as species others describe as mere
varieties; and hence in comparing the Flora Australiensis
with Baron von Mueller?s Census of Australian Plants , it may
sometimes be found that there are differences of opinion as
to the specific value of certain plants, and that characters
once deemed essential are not regarded as uniformly per-
manent. Since the publication of Lyell on the Antiquity
of Man, and Darwin on the Origin of Species, naturalists
have modified their views on the subject of species, and
have differed considerably on the characters which constitute
such, and therefore it is not surprising that great men like
the late Mr. Bentham and Baron von Mueller should differ in
their estimate of species. One cause of difference is the
fact that the former had to form his conclusions almost
entirely from dried specimens, whilst the latter in many
instances had the opportunity of observing plants in their
native state, and of noticing peculiarities in individuals.
Without referring to such a protean genus as Eucalyptus or
that of Acacia, in which there seem to be connecting links
between some of the so-called species, several genera of the
Lcguminosse present great difficulties to the systematic
botanist, and future scientists must yet decide how far
apparent differences affect specific value. The same remark
applies to the Orchidese, an order comprising many minute


species, some of which approach very near to each other.
Great light has been thrown on this subject by the published
figures of Mr. R. D. Fitzgerald, F.L.S.; and as the various
kinds are cultivated with a view of ascertaining their
liability to divergence, some aid may be given to the dis-
covery of a method whereby the distinction between species
and varieties will be better understood. It would appear
that the alterations in species during many generations are
not such as some enthusiastic followers of Darwin have
supposed, for from fossil cereals and other plants discovered
in the Swiss Lake dwellings, there is evidence to prove that
many of the species are the same in character as those which
exist in Europe now. In Australia, the knowledge of such
matters is very limited, and a century has not yet elapsed
since Brown published the first systematic account of
Australian plants, but it may happen in the course of palm-
ontological discovery that the fossilised remains of plants in
particular strata will reveal the antiquity of the Australian
Flora, and show how far species may have become diff-
erentiated in the process of ages. On a subject so abstruse,
it may be useful to quote the opinion of one so eminent as
Sir J. D. Hooker. He contends that ? species are neither
visionary, nor even arbitrary creations of the naturalist, but
realities, though they may not remain true for ever. The
majority of them,? he remarks, ?are so far constant within
the range of our experience, and their forms and characters
so faithfully handed down through thousands of generations,
that they admit of being treated as if they were permanent
and immutable. But the range of our experience is so
limited that it will not account for a single fact in the
present geographical distribution or origin of any one species
of plant, nor for the amount of variation it has undergone,
nor will it indicate the time when it first appeared, nor the
form it had when created ? (Introductory essay on the Flora of
Australia), Since the publication of Sir J. D. Hooker?s
valuable essay, great progress has been made in scientific
inquiries, and it is not improbable that a careful examination
of species under cultivation and the study of embryonic
peculiarities in individuals may suggest that which is fixed
and permanent in plants, and that which is simply accidental
or contingent. Amongst European botanists this question
of species and variety has long been a perplexing one, and
it is striking to notice- that botanists of eminence cannot
agree together as to the number of species in particular genera.


In the botany of the future in Australia similar difficulties
may arise, indeed some have already arisen, but in a new
field of inquiry traditionary views and long established
errors have not the same influence as in old countries, nor
are botanists called to ascertain how far cultivation in ages
past may have led to abnormal development. The future
Flora of Australia therefore may not be so fraught with
perplexities of this kind as that of Europe, and those which
now create a difference of opinion amongst Australian
botanists may yield to the progress of science and give new
illustrations of the wisdom which characterises the great
Creator?s works.
There are also, with regard to genera, difficulties which
need reform, not merely in lessening the number but
in grouping the species of the larger ones. Though the term
genus is simply a common substantive name given to a
number of species which resemble each other, yet difference
of opinion may prevail as to the propriety of extending the
number of genera or of placing a species under a particular
genus. Baron von Mueller with a view of simplifying the
study of botany, and of assisting the memory by limiting the
number of names, prefers the formation of large genera with
appropriate subdivisions. Thus, for instance, in the great
order of Epracrids, he has amalgamated under Slyphelia
several of Brown?s genera, and in a similar manner he has
incorporated Pleurandra with Hihbertia. So likewise, in the
order Salsolacese, he has reduced several of the old genera to
Bassia, and in the Amarantacem Trichinium to Ptilotus. If in
the future a further amalgamation could be efiected, the
study of Australian botany would be facilitated by the
suppression of many long names (some genera including but
one or two species), and the retention only of those which
express the essential character of plants nearly allied. In
former times it was the fashion to make too many genera, and
Baron von Mueller?s admirable Census is a proot of what may
be done to lessen the number. Regarding his noble efforts
as an instalment of reform, the imagination looks forward to
a period when the Vegetable Kingdom, so far as genera and
species are concerned, may be considerably simplified, and
people may cease to think that botany is a science of
bewildering terms and hard names rather than the contem-
plation of characters impressed on the beauties of Nature by
the infinite skill of the Creator. It is said that a rose would
smell as sweet by any other name, and so it would: but then


there is something incongruous in fixing some name of little
meaning on any of Nature?s gems, or of subjecting them
arbitrarily to a generic association unsuitable to them.
And then again there is a difficuly to be overcome in the
formation of sub-genera, or the grouping of species in the
larger genera. From the days of Brown to those of
Bentham and von Mueller, this has been felt especially in
Eucalyptus and in a less degree in that of Acacia. Before
the conception of the cortical or anthereal systems, species
were thrown together without any suitable arrangement,
but in the Flora Australiensis and the Baron?s Census , the
latter system has rendered the grouping of species of
Eucalyptus possible. Still, however, there are objections to
both systems, for whilst the one is useful in the field and
the other in the cabinet, they are both liable to exceptional
anomalies and the inconsistency of placing in close prox-
imity to each other species which differ materially. Here
then is a problem yet to be solved. Whilst therefore thanking
those great men for what they have done to remove past
errors, to render the identification of many species an easy
task and to afford the means of grouping trees in some
respects similar, men of observation can regard the present
arrangement of the genus as only provisional and an
instalment towards better things to come. With regard to
the genus Acacia, in the describing of which Mr. Bentham ex-
perienced so much trouble, Baron von Mueller has furnished
a series of figures whereby the character of many species will
be clearly seen, and when his work is completed the
grouping of the species will be comparatively easy. As in
Eucalyptus, the flowers of very different trees or shrubs are
very similar, and Mr. Bentham when dealing with dried
specimens, remarked that he found ? species with the most
discrepant pods sometimes almost identical in foliage, and on
the other hand pods apparently identical sometimes belonging
to species widely different in foliage and even in flower.? In
Acacia therefore the grouping of the species must be regarded
as only provisionally settled until the pods of all the species
have been collected? and carefully examined, and a system
devised founded on the shape and nature ol the fruit.
The arrangement of the natural orders is the last difficulty
which I propose to consider?a difficulty rendered highly
perplexing by the fact that our most eminent botanists have
entertained different opinions on the Passing over
some of the minor differences, it may be sufficient to notice


that the main divergence in the two great works?the Flora
of Bentham and the Census of Mueller?is the position of the
Monochlarnydeas amongst the natural orders, for whilst the
former places them separately (Vols. Y. and YI. partly), the
latter distributes them amongst the petaliiferous orders.
His reasons for this departure are given in the preface of his
Census , in which he expresses his conviction ? that so long as
the Monochlarnydeas remain isolated and associated with
the Gymnospermeas, we must necessarily have an imperfect
natural system ? And then he adds, as showing the in-
consistency of the arrangement in the Flora, ?Even amongst
the Thalamifloras and Calycifloras represented in Australia,
we have already not less than fifty-eight genera which are
entirely apetalous, or contain species in which the corolla
remains undeveloped.?
The Monochlamydeae, as
one, viz.;
in the Flora are twenty-
given
1. Phytolaccaese.
2. Chenopodiaceae.
3. Amarantaceae.
4. Paronychiacese.
5. Polygon aceae.
6. Nyctagineae.
7. Myristiceae.
8. Moniniiaceae.
9. Laurineae.
12. Eleagnacese.
13. Nepenthaceie.
14. Euphorbiaceae.
15. Urticeae.
16. Casuarineae.
17. Piperacea;.
18. Aristolocliiaceoe.
19. Cupuliferae.
20. Santalaceae.
21. Balanophereae.
10. Proteaceae.
11. Thymeleae.
In order to meet the views of the Field Naturalist?s Club
in A ictoria, Baron von Mueller has published a System of
Victorian Plants according to the dichotomous method of
Lamarck, but this system was not chosen by the Baron at
his free will, nor is such an arrangement likely to prove
useful in the ultimate mode of settling the natural orders of
Australia. In the botany of the future, the alliances of
Nature will be preferred to the ingenious contrivances of art,
and therefore it may justly be presumed that no system
which is beset with the danger of leading astray through the
misunderstanding of any solitary characteristic, will obtain
adoption in the general Flora of the future. The Baron?s
work must have given him a vast amount of trouble, as it
was ? to be rendered alike available for elementary schools
and for high educational institutions; it was to serve the
amateur gatherer of plants in the field as well as the pro-
fessional investigator in the exercise of stern duties, and yet


PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE OF THE AUSTRALIAN FLORA. 29
such a work was to be inexpensive, concise, and reliable!?
There can be no doubt that the intentions of the author
have been highly appreciated his two volumes having* in a
great measure answered the purposes for which they were
designed, but after all it must be admitted (as the learned
author is fully aware) that in a small genus or order the
dichotomous splitting-up of characteristics is but of little
help (as one may just as easily look over short diagnoses)
whilst in a large genus or order the system is frequently
misleading. If headings are made in a large genus or order
and then the salient points are brought out clearly in a
brief diagnosis, a complex of characteristics (which we lose
sight of in the dichotomous method) is obtained whereby
not merely the name of the species is ascertained but a
clue given to the better understanding of its properties.
Since the gradual disuse of the Linnean system the arrange-
ment of the natural orders has been viewed differently by
authors of eminence, but all seem to bo now agreed in
following natural alliances as nearly possible and of
placing in close proximity those groups which are connected
with each other. The 'illustrious R. Brown, when laying
the foundation of Australian botany, was one of the first
to recognize the advantages of the Natural System;
but the Prodromus Nova 1 . Ilollanditx records only a limited
portion of the vegetation known in 1810. The labour
therefore of extending that work, of elaborating new
orders and describing genera and species according to the
additional light thrown upon them, devolved on the great
systematic botanists, Bentham and Mueller, and it must in
justice be added that they have proved themselves worthy
successors of the Father of Australian Botany.
At the present time about 9,000 species, exclusive of the
lower Cryptogams, have been subjected to scientific investiga-
tion. How many more are yet to be discovered, and what
influence they may have in the modifying or reconstruction
of the Flora are mere matters of speculation. New species
are being found occasionallyas travellers penetrate into remote
parts, but now that Australia has been traversed from one end
to the other, it is scarcely probable that many new types of
vegetation will be discovered on which additional orders or
genera may be established. It is to be hoped, however, that as
each succeeding species falls into its proper place in the sys-
tematic arrangement, the nomenclature of plants will be simpli-
fied, the specific distinctions better understood, the genera


lessened in number, judicious subdivisions and that to
crown all, the aspirations of Brown, Bentham, and von Mueller
will be consummated in a perfect disposition of the orders.
In New South Wales there are many reasons why such things
may be hoped for, because in that, the oldest of the Austra-
lian colonies, the Linnean Society of the colony has already
done so much for the furtherance of botanical science, and
yet promises to do more. The Society may feel a just pride
in referring to the labours of such men as the late Rev. J. E.
Tenison-Woods, Professor Stephens, Mr. C. S. Wilkinson,
F.G.S., and Sir William Macleay, who by their writings,
as recorded in the Transactions of the Society, have contri-
buted so much to the study of natural history, whilst it must
be mentioned that the munificent benefactions and endow-
ments of the last naturalist have not merely eventuated in
the establishment of the ?Linnean Society of Sydney? on a
form basis, but are designed to perpetuate for future genera-
tions the means of pursuing those researches with which the
name of M ACLEAY must ever be associated.

OBJECT PAPER.
Cj ]t Victoria Institute,
Ijjrilosopjmal Snribte of (ireat IJritam,
8, ADELPHI TERRACE, STRAND, LONDON, W.C
Correspondence (including communications from intending Members or
Associates, &c.) to be addressed only to ? The Secretary,?
THE PRIMARY OBJECTS.
THIS SOCIETY has been founded for the purpose of promoting the
following Objects, which will be admitted by all to be of high
importance both to Religion and Science ;
First.?To investigate fully and impartially the most important questions of
Philosophy and Science, but more especially those that bear upon the
great truths revealed in Holy Scripture.
Second. ?To associate Men of Science and Authors* who have already
been engaged in such investigations, and all others who may be interested
in them, in order to strengthen their efforts by association ; and by
bringing together the results of such labours, after full discussion, in the
printed Transactions of an Institution, to give greater force and influence
to proofs and arguments which might be little known, or even disregarded,
if put forward merely by individuals.
Third.? To consider the mutual bearings of the various scientific conclusions
arrived at in the several distinct branches into which Science is now
divided, in order to get rid of contradictions and conflicting hypotheses,
and thus promote the real advancement of true Science ; and to examine
and discuss all supposed scientific results with reference to final causes,
and the more comprehensive and fundamental principles of Philosophy
proper, based upon faith in the existence of one Eternal God, Who in His
wisdom created all things very good.
Special advantages are secured to Country and Colonial Members and Associates
in the Journal of Transactions.
THE JOURNAL OF TRANSACTIONS
Contains the Papers read at the Meetings and the Discussions thereon.
Before these are published in the Journal, both are finally submitted to their
Authors for any revision, and MS, comments and supplementary remarks are
added, which have been sent in by such British, American, and other Members
to whom, as being specially qualified to contribute information upon the respective
subjects, proof copies of the Papers had been submitted for consideration ?the
authors of Papers adding their final comments. These arrangements, which are
found to add greatly to the value of the Journal, are carried out with a view to
securing the special usefulness of the Journal to all, whether home or Non-resident
Members or Associates ; these thus find in the Journal much valuable matter, and
often much (contributed by men of learning in all parts of the world) in addition
to that which had come before those actually present at the Meetings. (The
Journal is sent post-free.)
* The Society now consists of 1,200 Subscribers (about one-third of whom are
Foreign Members); including Literary and Scientific Men and others favourable
to the Objects. (The present average annual increase is upwards of a hundred.)
