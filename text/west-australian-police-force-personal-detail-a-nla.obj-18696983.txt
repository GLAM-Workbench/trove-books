FOREWORD.
The faculty of being able to memorise essential details of the identification features
of another person should be of prime importance to every Police Officer, who would make
himself efficient in the elements of his chosen profession.
Not only should he train himself to memoriae essential detail on the occasion of a
casual meeting, or view, of another person, but he should be able to impart the detail to
others in such a fashion that they would be able to recognise the person so described, if
required.
It is essential also, in the business of the Police Force, in the prevention and
detection of crime, that officers will, by virtue of the knowledge contained herein, be able
to correctly interpret the descriptive matter given to them by members of the public who
supply descriptions of others, or from persons who are the victims of some unlawful event.
?
Although, in modern times, there are various aids provided to us, as members of the
Force, which assist us to establish positive identification of a person sought, either for
his own good or that of the community at large, it is noted that a large proportion of our
members tend to rely too much upon these aids, and thus allow their own natural functions,
of the power to observe and memorise detail in this respect, to lapse into disuse.
In this Manual is outlined numerous examples from actual photographs of where to look,
and what to search for, in assessing identification features cf sufficiently individual
value to enable a person to be readily recognised from a subsequent written, or verbal,
description.
To all members of the Force I would commend the study of the detail provided in this
Manual, and the use of its principles in their dally occupation.
I hope that, *ith its aid, we will all absorb, and use, even oorae araall part of the
detail provided, and thus enhance the all round efficiency of the Department in this
particular phase of our work.

PERSONAL DESCRIPTION.
The ability to memorise the facial and bodily features of another person is a facility
that every Polios Officer should possess* It is essential that he strives to perfect Maself
in the art of readily recognising the details of the human form* which will assist Mm in making
positive visual identification of Ms fellow men*
In addition, he should train Mas elf to speak in the same language on the subject as Ms
brother officers, and in such descriptive detail that they will readily gather a mental picture
of the person so described*
The descriptive material should be sufficiently vivid, so that when the recipient officer
subsequently sees the person described he will be able to definitely recogMse that person*
In tMs manual on the subject is given numerous examples of the differences wMoh mty be
sought for in the facial and bodily features of our fellow-men* By quiet and unobtrusive
observation of other people in public streets and veMoles, one can train oneself to observe the
identifying features such as are shown herein* A short period of practice will soon illustrate
how readily one can recognise the identifying detail, and in a very short time the recogMticn
faeility becomes automatic, until one finds that in only a short scrutiny a wealth of detail has
been observed*
As one's ability grows it will be realised how rare is the person who has a "normal* or
"medium" bodily construction in every detail* The outstanding detail becomes readily visible
to the trained man, whereas the untrained man fritters Ms time away in endeavouring to memorise
ooatparatively non-essential detail, which, when analysed, amounts to classification data only,
which would fit one in every few hundred persons* On the other hand, the descriptive data
aocumaulated by the trained person in shorter time, and with less effort, would apply to only
one person in many millions*
Every Police Officer should, therefore, endeavour to equip Mmself with tMs knowledge
and regard it as an essential element of Ms profession*
The second purpose of the manual is to assist members of the public to as accurately
as they are able, an offender who has committed an offence against them, or some other mert>er of
the oonmnmity* It is common knowledge to experienced Police Officers that the victims of a
criminal event are generally inarticulate when asked to describe the offenders* Therefore, it is
for the purpose of also assisting these unfortunate people that the illustrations are provided, so
that by pointing out the parts of the features or body, which resemble some detail they remeaber,
they may enable the investigators to gain a reasonably clear mental picture of the appearance of
the person, or persons, they are endeavouring to describe*




la ??? isting the victim, It is desirable that the officer taking the description take hla
through the manual stage by stage f and take a note of the code number of each identification
feature recognised* The resultant code numbers only nay then be sent to interested sections.
or individuals* in the force who nay see for themselves the appearance of the details the victim
has pointed out*
The method, if used intelligently 9 could save a considerable amount of the clerical work
normally Involved in writing out the description, which could be reduced to a simple formulae*
At this stage, we arrive at the third purpose of the manual 9 and that Is the use of the
code notations appearing alongside each illustration for the purpose of conveying descriptive
matter to Officers and Sections of the force* *
? Thus, the ordinary descriptive method nay be used as shown in illustration No* l t but it can
be supplemented by code references, from the manual, to any particular feature it was desired to
emphasise, in this fashion* ~
A man, D 2, Cl, B, �3, *l3, BU, Fl�, Hh, H25, Kit, Ll2, M 3, Ml 7, 013, X 3, Z52, deciphered would bes-
A nan, sft*9in*, thin build, light brown heir, blue eyes, wavy hair, centre part, square jaws,
straight nose with lump on tip, narrow lip borders, mouth slopes to right, short chin with long
dimple, scanty eyebrows, head to left, pidgecn toed*
It will be seen, therefore, that in any form of communication a considerable amount of time
and labour would be saved* The recipient officer, or section, could also examine their cm manual
and formulate their mental picture, or composite, from the nominated illustrations*
Accompanying each illustration, or series of illustrations, is brief data provided to guide
the examiner in the salient points relating to the respective illustrations.
The subject is not new and is based on the great work of Alphonse Bertillion from his
* Portrait Parle? or "Likeness in Words", and, althou&h tlss- original use for his system has been
superseded by the Fingerprint Identification System, as an ultimate positive method of establish-
ing human identity, a large proportion of his system is still invaluable in establishing identity
by "visual* means*




A number of items dealt vlth by Bertlllion have been omitted, new items have been
added, and the whole of tne revised and streamlined system is recommended to all Police
Officers for the purposes previously outlined, in order that when they gaze upon another
person they do so with "seeing eyes", or, when describing another, they are not inart-
iculate, but can give a "likeness in words" so vividly that the other person "sees" the
described person, also.
The first illustration shows a good method of covering the simple description of
a person.
By memorising the sequence, an officer may be sure that he will not miss any of
simpler salient features when noting a personal description,
A description, such as that illustrated, is all that can be hoped for where it has
to be noted hurriedly in moments of stress or from hysterical victims.
A Police Officer, however, should also train himself to readily recognise additional
finer detail in various aspects of the human frame, in order that he can add a wealth of
fine detail to the simple description, thus removing the description he gives from the
problematical level to the positive stage in future recognition.

AGE.
When a person appears to be of such an age that it
borders on the next division, a further sub-division
may be used, thus;-
Boy approaching youth, middle aged man approaching
old man, young man near youth, etc.
When the sub-divisions are used, the two code terms
are grouped together so that the examples above would
be: -
A to Al, A3 to Ak t A 2 to Al.
Take into account the viewpoint of the person
making a description; thus, a person of 30 years looks
quite old to a child.

When a person appears to he of such an age that it
borders on the next division, a further sub-division
may be used, thus:-
Very young girl near young girl, young woman
approaching middle age, old to very old woman.
When the sub-divisions are used, the two code terms
are grouped together so that the examples above would be:-
B to 81, B2 to 83, Bh to 85.
Due allowance should be made for the effects of
"moke up", if present, on a woman's appearance.

BUILD.
Persons with large protruding stomachs should, in
addition, be nominated thus:-
Corpulent - G5
Very corpulent - C 6
If it is considered that a person?s build falls between
any of the illustrated examples, then the two nearest
divisions may be grouped, thus:-
Medium to stout, or medium to thin build.
The code ratings would be grouped thus:-
G2 to C 3, or C 2 to Cl.

CARRIAGE.
In conjunction with build, a person?s carriage
should be noted. Thus, a person of any of the nomin-
ated builds may, in addition, be:-
Erect or stooped.
Therefore, a person maybe nominated as:-
Very thin erect or thin stooped, etc.

HEIGHT.
Using this table, one may expect to fine? a
person anywhere between the immediate divisions.
Thus, a short person may be expected to be found
between the "very short 11 and "medium" limits.
A useful tip in this respect is to ask a witness
to make a comparison with a person of known height,
when taking a description from him. By this method,
you will get his idea of height.
When a person is of such a height, that it
borders on the next division, a further useful sub-
division is to describe the height combined with the
next division, thus:-
"Short to very short","medium to tall", or
"medium to short", etc.

HAIR COLOUR.
Hair may be divided into four separate units, thus:- colour, type,
quantity and grooming.
Healing with colour, hair may be described as:-
Very fair - E
Fair - E1
Light brown - E2
Medium brown - E3
Dark brown - EU
Black - E5
Auburn - E6
White - E7
Where a person?s hair is, in addition, noticeably going grey, then the
following code reference may be added:- E8
When a complainant or informant cannot accurately describe a colour,
but can nominate that the hair was a light or dark colour, then the
following references may be used;-
Light coloured hair - E9
Dark coloured hair -El 0

HAIR TYPSS.
Straight hair is hair which has no wave.
Curly hair forms itself into large rings.
WaV y hair the hair has a series of pronounced curves, often
artificially produced.
Frizzy hair the hair is formed by a number of small rings on each hair,
the rings are smaller and less flexible than the rings of curly hair.
Woolly hair this is short hair which is entangled and thus forms tufts
like sheep's wool.
Wiry hair the hair has a series of ripples in each individual unit like
corrugated wire. This type is of a coarse nature, and the total eiiect is
a stiff unruly mop of hair, sometimes referred to as kinky hair.
Hair maybe coarse or fine, very short so that it bristles, or It maybe
worn short, long, or very long. in order to provide for these features, an
indicating symbol maybe added immediately after the code for the hair type.
The symbols to be used are:- Coarse - C Pine - P Very Short - IS
Short - 3 Long - L Very Long - VL. '????has straight, coarse hair, worn
very long, would be coded Ell. C.VL., or short, fine, wavy hair, -oulo be

HAIR QUANTITY.
In addition to the colour and type, the quantity of
hair shou?.d be noted and quoted* For example, a person
may have '?thick medium brown wavy hair* 1 , which, coded,
would bei-
El 6, E3, El 3.
Frontal baldness is where the lint, of insertion
of the hair is receding and the forehead appears
very high.
Tonsural baldness* There is an absence of the
hair on the top of the~skull.
Parietal There is a blending of the
Frontal with the Tonsural baldness. All the top of
the skull is bare.
Where a wig is worn, quote the fact and state
the colour, in using the code, a light brown wig
would be described:- K22.52.

Where an exaggerated or unusual method is used,
nominate it hy the name. Provision cannot he
made here to code the various styles of haircut,

INSERTION OF THE HAIR.
The outline of the frontal insertion of the hair
may he divided into three units, thus:-
Circular. The outline of the frontal insertion
describes a semi-circle.
Rectangular. The outline of the insertion of the
hair is straight as far as the beginnings of the
Parietals. The straight hair outline around the face
is sometimes referred to as being "square".
Pointed. The hair has receded on each s ide of the
front of the skull and left a pointed band of hair of
small length.

SKULL PROFILES.
The low skull; Small height between earhole and
top of skull.
The high skull: Great height between earhole and
top of skull.
Egg-shaped skull; Height of skull is great in com-
parison to width, usually known as "Egghead"?
Bladder-shaped skull: Forehead recedes and is excess-
ivly prolonged, back of the head protrudes and the
skull height is small.
Plat back of head: The back of the head is almost
vertical.
Barrel shaped head: The back of the head protrudes
extensively.
Proturberant back of head: The base of the back part
of the skull forms a ledge.
Keel-shaped head: Resembles a boat keel inverted.
To recognise the shape, a y \ individual should be faced.

FACE SHAPES.
Pyramid face. Pace reduces from a wide jaw width to a
narrow forehead; also known as a "Sugar Loaf Hwad".
Wedge shaped face. Reduces from a wide forehead to narrow
jaws, wedge shaped and reverse of the Pyramid face.
Diamond shaped face. Wide between the ears, narrow forehead
and jaws.
81-concave face. Hollow temples and hollow cheeks. A
cadaverous face.
Square face. The general shape of the face is decidedly square.
Note that it?s length is short. If this type of face is elong-
ated, then classify it as rectangular.
Round face. Paces of this type are generally small.
Rectangular face. An elongated square face.
Long face. Outstanding in it 1 s length with narrower jaws
than the rectangular face.

When a person is wearing a hat, it is obvious that the upper
portion of the face may not be dlsoernable. In order to provide
for this situation, the following provision is made :
Where the jaws only can be described, use examples Pl 6
and Pl7#
Square jaws# The angles of the lower jaws, estimated below the
ears, are Very square.
Narrow jaws. The angles of the lower jaws, estimated below the
ears, are very narrow.
Pull face, A plump face with firm flesh.
Bony face. A very thin face with all bony parts projecting.
Prominent cheek bones. The cheek bones are the bony projections
immediately beneath the eyes. They should be prominent to be
nominated,
Plabby face. Like the full face it is a plump face. The
difference, however, is noticeable in this respect. The skin
of the flabby face is pale and loose, also the skin tends to
hang in folds.

DISSYMETRY OF THE PACE
In a normal face, the eyea, the different elements of the
two ears, and the two angles of the lips are found in the same
respective horizontal plane# But, there are faces of which
one half, in a vertical sense, is greater than the other# The
result is that the eyea, the ears and the corners of the mouth
are not on the same horizontal plane, hut are on an angle,
either upwards or downwards#
Dlssyraetry of the face is more common than one would think,
and it is a distinctive feature, readily observed, if sought.
In the examples, the direction of sbpe has been given
according to the observer?s right or left, and not the right or
left of the parson observed#
p 27# Shows an example of diasyraetry of the jaw; note that
the remainder of the face is in correct alignment.
DISSYMBTRY IN FACIAL WIDTH.
Taking the nose line as the central point, one may,
by taking careful note, observe a distinct difference in the
width on one side of the f with the other.
Sometimes the difference is infinitesimal and for that
reason should not be seriously considered, but, if the difference
is pronounced, as in illustration P26, it should be noted#

THE FOREHEAD.
The forehead may he studied in four phases
(1 ) The inclination or slope.
(2) The height.
(3) The size.
(U) The peculiarities.
Here we deal with the Inclinstion.
There are four possible inclinations oi the forehead:-
Acutely receding. Sloping back at an acute and obvious angle
Receding. Not so pronounced.
Vertical* The forehead is straight.
Prominent or convex. The forehead juts forward and is
rounded in appearance.

describes a pronounced curved line. The general inclination
of the forehead is receding.
A frontal dimple. A very pronounced hollow in the middle of
the forehead. It will be readily recognised when seen because
of the distinctly hollowed appearance of the centre of the
forehead. Do not mistake the wrinkles between the eyebrows
for this effect. They play an important part in identification
and are dealt with separately at a later stage.

THE NOSE.
The nose plays an important part in the ident-
ification of a human face. It ia prominent, easily
aeton, and has a wide range of variation in different
individuals.
The nose ia divided into three porta - the root
the bridge (including the tip' and the taae.
The root. The root of the nose is a hollow which
exists, mor 1 or less accentuated, at the beginning of
the nose, between the eyes, under the baae of the
forehead.
Straight root. '.Then the hollow, where the root of
the nose occurs, is absent, it is referred to as a
straight root.
Shallow root. If the hollow is present but not
accentuated, it is a shallow root.
Deep Root. Referred to as such when the hollow
is deep and well defined.
The straight and deep n<- e roots are very dist-
inctive and easily recognised.

The bridge of the nose is the line of the profile
of the nose from its root to its tip. There are
three principal forms of the bridge of the nose -
concave, straight and convex. A variety of the
latter is the carved nose.
Concave. Bridge of the nose curved inwards.
Straight: A perfectly straight line.
Convex. Bridge of the nose curved outwards.
Curved. Very similar to the convex nose, except
that the bridge reaches the maximum height quickly
from the root of the nose, and from that point
describes a straight line to the tip, resulting^in
a decided curve appearing toward the upper portion
of the nose.
It is important that one becomes thoroughly
familiar with the basic bridge of the nose shapes,
as succeeding examples will illustrate.

Undulating Bridge of the nose, ?When a small hummock
appears on the bridge of the nose, then the bridge of the nose is
classified as undulating.
The undulation may be present on any of the three
principal types of bridge of the nose and provides a very useful
sub-division of nose types.

Incli nation of the base of the nose. Independant of the shape
of tS bridge of the nose, the base oFthe nose can vary in one of
three directions.
A concave, straight, or convex, nose may have a straight base,
or one with an upward, or one with a downward trend.
A feature of this nature is most important and should he
watched for. Admittedly, it is only a small detail, hut it is
most distinctive and easily recognised, as the illustrations
will show.

"S" - shaped bridge. Is an exaggerated concave nose
and the base of the nose has an upward thrust.
Lunr' on tip. The size of the lump on the tip varies.
It would be advisable to nominate whether the lump
was &mall or large.
When using the code for this peculiarity,
the size of the lump should immediately follow, thus:-
a large lump on the end of the nose would be cod-1 H. 25 Lj
a small lump H. 25 S.
Bj-lobed tin. The gristly part of the nostrils forms
clearly a projection, under the skin. The dimple
formed between these two projections seems to divide
the tip of the nose into two parts.
Pointed nose. The tip of the nose is very pointed.

Flattened bridge* A small flat platform appears
approximately in the centre of the nose.
Flattened tip. The flattening on the tip of the
nose has a triangular shape.
Thin bridge. The width is very small.
Broad bridge. The width across the bridge is
substantial.
Deflected bridge. The middle part of thebridge
only is deflected and may be turned to the right
or left. On noses of this type, the tip is always
in its correct alignment. It is the middle portion
of the bridge which is distorted.
Broken bridge. A deformity resulting from an
accident. The breaking is often accompanied by a
deflection of the bridge, whole or partial.
NOTE: The direction of the deflection
in the case of a deflected bridge of the nose, or the
direction of the deformity in the case of the broken
nose, may be indicated by adding the letter R, for
right, or L, for left to the existing code indicator.
Thus, a nose with a broken bridge inclined to the right
would be coded H. 33 R-
Deviating tip of nose. The tip of the nose does not
follow the direction of "he bridge of the nose, but
is twisted, or deviates, to the right or left. This
deviation is strongly, or sl-ghtly, pronounced, as
the illustrations show.
The degree of deviation may bo
indicated by using the addition, S for slight, or 0
for considerable, after the existing code indicator,
if required. Thus, slight deviation to the right
would be coded H.3U S.

Pimply nose. The tip, and generally also part of the bridge
of the nose, has a very decided colour, varying from red to
violet,
Visible partition. The part of the gristly area of the nose,
which separates the nostrils from one another, is called the
partition or sub-partition. If that partition goes much
beyond the lower edge of the nostrils and becomes, in consequence,
very visible, that peculiarity is called ??visible partition?.
Marginal nostrils. Each nostril is bordered by a little pad
surrounding entirely the nasal aperture.
3wolden nostrils. The nostrils have a swollen appearance.
The wings are thick and anpear to be glued to the uartition
of the nose.
Pinched nostrils. The wings are very close to the partition
without being thick.
Dilated nostrils. T v wings are widely spread from the
partition and they a r *e -'ften very thin.

In this section, we deal with the combined forehead and nose orofiles.
The continued or straight profile. In this profile the outline from the
Insertion of the hair to the end of the nose forms a single straight line
This is the Greek Profile,
Broken Profile. Forehead vertical, bridge of nose straight and generally
turned up at the base. The direction of the bridge of the nose, and that
of the forehead, forms a very decided angle. Root of the nose is small.
Parallel Profile. The inclination of the forehead is receding, root of
nose is deen, the bridge of the nose is straight. The line of the bridge
is parallel with the prolongation of the line of the orofile of the fore-
head but on a different level owing to the deep nose root.
Angular Profile. The direction of the forehead forms with tnat of the
bridge of the nose a well marked angle, but the root of the nose is deep.
This is the vital difference between the Angular and Broken Profiles.
Arched Profile. Forehead and bridge of nose are both convex. fj -he root
of the nose is of moderate depth and the base of the nose is
turned down.
Undulating Profile. The forehead is convex, and the bridge of the nose
concave. The root of the no^ 5 is deep.

Thickness of the lips is judged by the distance between
interior and exterior surface.
If the distance between the teeth and the outer edge of
the lips is great, then the lips are referred to as thick.
In reverse, if the distance between the teeth and the
outer edge of the lips is only small, then the lips are
referred to as thin.
The thickness o- the lips must not be confused with the
border of the lips.
The border refers to the visible red of the lips and
lips may be referred to as:- thin with small border;
thick with thin border on upper Ijp and wide border on
lower lip, etc.

SHAPE OP THE CHIN.
The examples are self explanatory.
It should be realised that the individual units of
chin variations may be used in combination; thus, the
terms, a short, wide, undulating chin (coded M 3, MB, Ml 2),
or a medium sized, pointed chin, of medium height,
(coded M7�M9, MU), may be described.

THE FORM OF THE LOWER PROTRUSION OF THE CHIN.
The lower protrusion of the chin is also known
as the "knoh".
If the protrusion is very small or does not exist it
is said to be a Plat chin.
If the protrusion is accentuated it is said to be a
Knob shaped chin.
The knob shaped chin must not be confused with the
protruding chin. In the case of the protruding chin
the higher protrusion is slightly accentuated and all
the bottom part of the jawbone protrudes; in the knob
shaped chin the general inclination of the chin can be
vertical, but the upper part of the chin is depressed
and the lower part protrudes in a very marked manner.
In coding the Knob shaped chin either Mlh or Mls
maybe used.

THE LONG DIMPLE.
Elongated from top to bottom of the lower part
of the chin; is not as outstanding in its clarity as

THE CLEFT CHIN.
A chin of this type is not unlike the.long
dimple. The difference is that it is deeper and
longer and appears to divide the chin into two parts.

ACCENTUATED UPPER DEPRESSION OF THE CHIN.
Above the lower part of the chin is found
sometimes a very decided depression which separates,
very abruptly, the upper part of the chin from the
lower part.
When the depression is very pronounced it should
be noted as an identification feature.

further sub-divisions of the nose-mouth profile.
The code references shown for the four immediate examples

WHOLE FACE PROFILES.
Some of the /hole Pace profiles ere very distinctive and easy to re-
cognise, the examples provided illustrate the easily recognised types.
It is considered to he more reliable to describe, or memorise, any
other whole profile, than these shown, by the individual description
of the forehead, the nose, and the mouth portions of the total profile.
Concave Profile. The forehead protrudes, the nose is recessed and
the chin protrudes.
Convex Profile. The forehead recedes distinctively, the nose is con-
the chin noticeably recedes, the whole outline semi-circular or
half moon shape.
Straight profile or Plat pace. The whole profile has the appearance,
independent 'o?f 'how the head is held, that a straight line may be drawn
from the top of the forehead to the base of the chin, without the nose
protruding unduly.
Pointed Profile. The forehead recedes and is in line with the nose,
the nose to the chin area recedes noticeably, the total outline gives
the profile that of an arrow head. The distinction between the Convex
and the Pointed Profile is in the fact that in the former the nose is
convex, whereas in the latter the nose is straight.

EYEBROWS:
The eyebrows play a very important role in the general-
expression of the face.
%
The internal extremity of the eyebrows is termed the
Head of the Eyebrow, and the external extremity the Tail of
the Eyebrow.
By the term eyebrows, we mean solely the hairy line and
not the bony arch with the hairy line.
The position of the eyebrows is divided into six units,
as follows:-
Senarated eyebrows. The distance between heads is

relatively yreat.
Aanroachinr eyebrows. The two heads of the eyebrows
- - ~ .wi X' . i. ?

Dow eyebrows. The distance from the middle of the eye-
brows to the centre of the eyeball is short; this posi-
tion of the eyebrows elves to the whole of the face a sad
expression.
Hin-h eyebrows. The distance fro 171 the middle of the eye-
brows to the?centre of the eyeball is great. T v -e high
eyebrows give to the face an expression of astonishment.

direction from? 1 ie root of the nose giving the impression
of a pair of spread wings.

THE EYELIDS.
Bertillion gives the following definition which is well worth
remembering in order that one may readily recognise the identifiable
features in the eyelid
"The eyelids are the two bands, in movable parte, which surround
the eyeball and which rejoin and are merged together on the two aides
of the iris to form the internal angle of the eye towards the bridge of
the nose, and the external angle of the eye on the opposite side. The
free edge of the upper eyelid and that of the lower eyelid are covered
with short but rather thick hairs; The eyelashes. These edges are called
the ciliary edges. To be able to give a description of the eyelids we must
study: (1) the size and degree of their opening, (2) the general direction
of that opening, (3) the shape of the upper eyelid, (k) their peculiari-
ties, among which we count also the shape of the lower eyelid.
The opening of the eyelids. The opening of the eyelids is examined
from the point of view of the horizontal size of the aperture, through which
we see the eyeball (the palpebral aperture), and from the point of view of the
vertical opening of that aperture, or in other words, from the point of view
of the degree of separation of the upper and lower eyelids in a state of re-
pose. The palpebral aperture changes its dimensions horizontally and verticallj
in different individuals. This makes people believe that the size of the eye
ball varies in different subjects. In reality the eyeballs are in all cases
perceptibly of the seme size. These are then the dimensions of the horizontal
and vertical dimensions of the pupil,otherwise called the horizontal and
vertical dimensions of?thr palpebral apertures, which make us say one eye is
large and another is small.?
The "horizontal opening of the aperture? varies as does the vertical
opening of the~~aper~6ure; both openings are absolutely Independant each
other.
The effect of this variation in individuals is to produce the round eyed
person as distinct from the person whose eyes appear to be long narrow slits,
and, of course, there are also the numerous variations which would occur as a
result of the combinations of the two aperture variations.
Page 118.




OPENING OF THE EYELIDS.
Possible variations of eye size due to
difference in horizontal opening are shown
in illustrations P to P2.
Possible variations of eye size due to
difference in the vertical opening are shown
in illustrations P3 to P5.
- V *
Persons with large vertical and large
horizontal openings would have a staring
Appearance, often referred to as being
"Popeyed".
The reverse is the person with the small
vertical and small horizontal opening giving
them a small round eyed appearance, often
referred to as being "Pig-eyed".

Mongolian race.
Downwards. The opening of the eyelid aperture slopes
downwards.
The normal illustrations are included for comparative
purposes only.
Odd combinations of the upward or downward slope of
eyelid aperture are shown in examples P9 to Pll; such
variety should be watched for#, because it does constitute
an outstanding identification feature.

FORM OF THE UPPER EYELID.
Bertillion's definition reads ; -
The upper eyelid extends from its free edge
furnished with eyelashes to the eyebrows. It can
be considered as composed of two superimposed bands.
The first is movable and with a free edge covered with
eye-lashes; the other is above the first and fixe^.
If the eye is open, the first band is tucked more or
less under the second fixed band.
The covered upper eyelid. The fixed band of the
eyelid entirely covers the movable part.
Uncovered upper eyelid. The movable part is
very visible. These eyes are often referred to as
the "hooded eyes".

PECULIARITIES OP THE EYELIDS.
Entire nrotrusion of the upper eyelid. The fixed part
of the upper eyelid forms a kind of swelling falling in
front. This protuberance hides, while the eye is wide
open, the movable port of the eyelid.
Withdrawn eyelids. The upper eyelid appears to be
withdrawn under the bony border of the orbit.
Roofed eyelids. The eyes of Chinese and Japanese show
this peculiarity. The eyelids instead of terminating sharply
at the internal point appear to form a half moon shaue.
External overhang of the upper eyelids.
portion of the top eyelid, on the external corners, overhangs
the lower portion of the top eyelid.
The overhang nay occur on one eye and not the other,
such an effect would be a very distinctive identification
feature. Examples PlB and Pl 9 show actual cases.

PECULIARITIES OF THE EYELIDS.
Depressed eyelids. The vertical opening of one eye
may be less than that of the other, giving one eye the
appearance of being smaller than the other. This
difference of opening is caused by an habitual lowering
of one or the other of the upper eyelids. See examples
P2O and P2l.
Padded eyelids. All the free border of the lower
eyelid is outlined by a light pad of skin about a
quarter of an inch in thickness.
Pouched lower eyelids. All the lower eyelid is puffed
up, it generally forms several concentric folds. This
type is usually referred to as having "bags under the eyes".
V/rinkled lower eyelids. The lower eyelid is covered
with numerous wrinkles.
Blear-eyed eyelids. The opening of the aperture is
very small on account of a chronic inflamation of the
eyelids. The borders of the eyelashes are inflamed and
very red.

THE EYEBALLS.
The eyeballs are situated in the bony hollow called
the orbit; normally only a very small part of the surface
of the eyeball is seen through the aperture of the eyelids.
As has been previously explained, the degree of the
horizontal, or vertical, opening of the palpebral aperture
makes the eyeball appear small or i
Actually, the variation of the size of the eyeball
is very minute, the smallest eyeball being only about a
2hth part of an inch less than the diameter of the largest
eyeball.
One other factory governing eyeball apnearance does 1
vary, however, and that is the position of the eyet "1 in
the orbit.

The edge of the bony cavity maybe independant

High or large orbits. The height of the bony cavity is
considerable. The edge of the bony cavity maybe
independant of the eyebrow hair line, hence this sub-
division.
Hollow orbits. The eyeball is relatively sunken, the
upper eyelid is very retiring. This peculiarity is
always found in aged or sickly persons.
Full orbits. The eyeball is more or less flush witli the
head, the upper eyelid protrudes.
NOTES. In hollow and full orbits is given another aspect
of sunken and protruding eyes respectively. The
appearance of the two aspects is so closely related and
difficult to differentiate r at no attempt should be made
to separate the two. It is better to think in terms
of sunken or protruding eyes, whichever is applicable,
and use the corresponding code references, i.e. from

ELEMENTS AND COLOUR.
The differ ant parts of the eye. The globe of the �ye f celled the eyeball, conelats
of the pupil f which forma a central black circle, and of a coloured band, called the
Iria. The healthy pupil ia alwaya black, both in the llghteat and darkest eyea.
The iria ia divided into two principal zones:
(1) The Halo around the pupil which covers about one third of the total of the iria*
.(2) The Periphery or the outer circumference of the iria adjoining the white of the eye.
Sometimes a third zone ia present, i.e. the Pupillary Zone. Thie ia a grey border about
a 2Uth part of an inch in width which borders the outline of the pupil; it ia usually found in
eyes of a clear ahade.
The more of leas yellow matter, which ia found in the great majority of eyea, ia called
the pigment of the eye. On the quantity of pigment, the general ahade of the eye depends.
Surrounding the iris ia the white of the eye or aclerotal which varies little in diff-
erent individuals. In children it appears slightly bluish; in adults slightly yellowish.
Sometimes the white of the eye appears red by the injection of blood. Finally, there ia the
lachrymal channel which has no descriptive value.
Our main concern ia a simple and accurate claaaification of the eye colour. There are,
however, a number of difficulties in securing this information. Therefore, it ia considered
better to record the general eye colour and adhere to simple colour descriptions when describ-
ing eye colour. When uncertainty occurs in providing an accurate colour description, a person
may be able to say that the eyea were a light dark colour. This information should not bo
ignored, because it does provide a sub-division of colour.

Different coloured eyes. The colouring of one eye differs
materially that of the other.
Dilated pupils. The pupils are noticeably large.
The example Rl2 indicates the normal size.
Cataract. The iris and the pupil are partly covered by
a greyish veil of skin* Nominate which eye by adding indicator
R for right and L for left to code reference. If in both eyes,
use indicator B. Thus, a cataract in both eyes would be
coded RI3B.
Missing eyes* Nominate which eye is missing and use add-
itional reference as described in cataract. If the addition
B is used, it will, in this instance, indicate a totally blind
person.
Glass eye. Nominate which eye and use additional refer-
ence, as explained in previous examples.

COMPLEXION.
The colour of the skin should be noted. Various human races
are distinctive by their skin colouring, apart from other features,
but even in the white races, distinctive variations occur and are
of assistance in sub-dividing individuals.
A person?s complexion may be described as ; -
White, pale or pallid : S
Florid or ruddy : S1 -
Tanned ? S2
Olive s S3
Sallow . S4
Yellow ? S5
Brown ? S6
Dark brown ? S7
Black : S8

THa! BjSARD.
The adornment of a beard is not indulged in extensively these
days. Provision, however, must be made for those who still favour
them,
A long full beard t T
A short full beard : T1
A large moustache ; T2
A short moustache : T3
Clean shaven : Tk
Habitually unshaven : T5
Where the beard or moustache is untidy or unkempt, the letter
U should be added after the appropriate code reference. Thus, a
long untidy full beard would be coded TU.

Like the hair of the head, the hairs of the beard may vary
from straight, wavy, curly or Woolley to very frizzy. The code
reference applied to the hair types, page 18, may be added to the
Beard reference, if required. Thus, a short full beard of
straight hair would be coded T1 Ell.
Whiskers� The beard of the cheeks near the ears is known as
the whiskers. In present day slang, these tufts of hair are
known as "sideboards".
Blue_fa�e. A man, even though freshly shaven, may, by virtue
of the dark hair base under his skin, have a constant "5 o'clock
shadow". Compare this face with Th.
The pencil moustache. Usually confined to a thin line of
hair and is seen in various lengths.
Chin beard. A beard on the chin, sometimes referred to as a
'goatee". Often accompanying the beard is a moustache and a "fly"
The fly is a small tuft of hair on the middle of the lower lip.
Soup strainer moustache. A moustache of this type droops over
the mouth, concealing it.
Collar-shaped beard. A beard which is confined to below the
lower Jaw.
NOTE ? The shade of the beard is th; same as that of the hair.
It must be noted, however, that the shade of colour of different
parts of the beard can vary. It should also be observed that the
quantity of hair in the beard varies between individuals, and on
the same person, on the different points of growth. Thus, a
person can possess a very thick moustache and a very scanty beard.

FOREHEAD WRINKLES.
In the U series, the subject of facial wrinkles is dealt
with in detail. These comparatively insignificant markings, can
be a very useful aid in establishing the identity of a person.
Long single wrinkle. The whole width of the forehead is crossed
by a single deep wrinkle.
Short single wrinkle. A single wrinkle is found in the middle
part of the forehead.
Double wrinkle. Two wrinkles, more or less parallel, cross
the forehead horizontally. The distance which separates the two
wrinkles is usually greater in the centre of the forehead than on
the sides.
NOTE. The foregoing wrinkles should only be noted if they
are clearly defined. Also, they should be present when the face
is in repose.
Many wrinkles. The whole of the forehead is covered with
numerous wrinkles, more or less horizontal.
No wrinkles. In some persons, forehead wrinkles are completely
absent, which fact, taking into account their age, is a distinctive
factor.
Undulating wrinkles. If the forehead wrinkles are not totally
horizontal, but are distinctly undulating, then the letter U should
be added after the appropriate Code Reference, as in the example
U2U. This applies where a Double Wrinkle nas a distinctive appearance,
due to its meanderings across the forehead.
The undulating effect must be distinctive and obvious before
being remarked upon.

TEMPORAL AND TRAGIAN WRINKLES.
Temporal wrinkles. Are fan-shaped wrinkles starting from
the corner of the eye (commonly called crow's feet).
Single Tragi an ?./r inkle. The tragian wrinkle is a long
wrinkle of about 1 to 1-j inches long, nearly parallel
to the shape of the tragus, from which it is about -g inch
distant. This wrinkle does not generally appear until
after the 35th year.
Norsk The tragus is a small win; of gristle which is a
part of the ear near the cheek, and alongside the e-r-hole,
so that a tragian wrinkle is one which is present on the
cheek alongside the tragus.
Double Tragian wrinkle. Self-exrlanator.y. See single

FACIAL WRINKLES.
Deep naso-labial wrinkles, or deep nose to corners of mouth
wrinkles, are defined as the two wrinkles which descend ob-
liquely from the sides of the nostrils towards the corners
of the mouth.
Cheek Wrinkles. The cheek wrinkle is found further back
on the cheek than the nose to corners of the mouth wrinkle;
it is parallel to the latter and descends to the chin.
The cheek wrinkle is rarely observed in young people.
The nose to mouth and the cheek wrinkles may appear as
one unit on a face, or may be seen in combination on the one
face, as per example and U37. Either code reference may
be used.
Under chin wrinkle. A deep wrinkle may appear under the
chin, accentuating the double chin appearance.
A cheek wrinkle may be seen in combination with the
under chin wrinkle, as per illustration in example U36.

Hollow cheeks. This feature should not be ignored;
at the same time it should not be confused with
accentuated cheek wrinkles.
It should be understood clearly that the
hollow in the cheek follows the jaw line, whereas
the cheek wrinkles run vertically down the face.
Cheek dimples. Should be watched for. They are
mere or leas pronounced on the faces on which they
occur, and are found generally about an inch behind
the corners of the mouth.
Vertical neck wrinkles, are a distinctive feature
and should be noted. They appear immediately
under the chin and descend vertically to the
breastbone. The appearance is suggestive of
a cord and they are sometimes referred to as
"neck cords". Ab seen in the examples, they may
consist of one or two single cords.

THE EAR.
The ear is the most significant element of the human figure. In fact, thanks
to its numerous depressions and elevations, it presents such a quantity of differ-
ent formations that it is almost impossible to find two persons with ears absolutely
identical in all their parts* Moreover, the shape of the ear does not change from
birth to death. The description of the ear of an individual taken at his birth, and
after his death, say at 60 years of age, will be identically the same. The skin
covering the cartilage of the external ear, and the size, will naturally be subject
to modifications, but the shape and the directions of the elements constituting the
ear, will remain unchanged during life. It is unnecessary to say that wounds can
modify certain parts, but, in this case, the modification accidentally produced is,
almost always, easily recognisable.
It is precisely this constancy in the shapes which gives the ear such a high
descriptive value. A Police Officer will, therefore, do well to study carefully
the ear of - individuals for whom he is looking. Ibis will at first be a little
difficult for him, since in ordinary life there is no part of the figure which
attracts so little attention as the ears.
Let us first stndy the different elements which comprise the visible portion
of the oar, otherwise the external ear. There are five elements;-
(1) The Border of the ear or the Helix. The helix is a kind of pad, which,
commencing from ihe centre of the ear, "borders the upper two-thirds of the ear and
finally blends with
(2) The Lobe. The lobe is a soft rounded eminence, forming the lower part of the
external ear*
(3) The Tragus* The tragus is a little grldtly projection of a triangular form
limiting, in front, the shell.
(M The Anti-Tragus* is found opposite the tragus, separated by the inter-
tr�glsn nbwnwiO. is generally a projection smaller than that of the tragus*
The anti?tragus presents much more variation than the tragus*
(*) The Anti-Helix. The anti-helix is found above the anti-tragus. It is called
in the portrait parle, for short, the fold. In its upper part the fold bifurcates
into two branches; the upper fold and the middle fold. The upper branch rejoins
the upper part of the helix, and the middle, the original part of the helix.
Page 172.




There are three farther depressions:-
The Boat-Shaped hollow. The heat-shaped hollow is the depression which
is s i'tua t"e3 Tie tween the Vac k part of the helix and the lower and upper part
of the anti-helix. It ends towards the lohe, sometimes in a point, hut often
blending into. it.
(2) The Digital Hollow is situated between the upper and middle branches of
the lts name comes from the habit many people have of often in-
troducing their fingers into it.
(3) The Shell. This is the deepest depression of the external ear, which is
bounded by the tragus, the anti-tragus, and the lower and middle
anti-helix, and the original part of the helix. It merges into and continues
in the auditory canal.
Page 17h.




GENERAL FORM OF THE EAR.
The ear conforms to one of four shapes.
Triangular. The lobe has a downward trend and the upper
border outline is straight.
Rectangular. The upper and back borders, also the lobe,
are fairly straight in their outline, giving the ear a square
appearance.
Oval. The common form of ear.
Round. Round ears are generally small.
THE BORDER OF THE BAR OH HELIX.
The helix is like a pad, which, commencing from the
centre, borders the upper part of the ear, and finally blends
with the lobe at the base of the ear.
The border is divided into three parts, i.e., Original,
Unner and Back Borders.
T.IE ORIGINAL BORDER.
The original border is the +-:-rm applied to the point
where the border originates. An identifiable variation in in~
dividual ears may occur at this point, as will be seen in the
illustrations, and may vary from none to a very large beginning
at the point of origin.

THE UPPER BORDER.
The diagram illustrates the extent of the upper border which
surrounds the upper portion of the ear.
The end of skin, which 'orms the border, varies in width in
different individuals; therefore, variations in the width of the
aad or hem from very small to very large may be observed.-

BACK BORDER (SIZE OP HEM).
The diagram illustrates the extent of the back border,
v/hich extends along the rear edge of the ear.
The pad of skin, v/hich forms the border, varies in width
in different individuals; therefore, variations in the width
of the pad or hem from very small to very large maybe observed.
V/herc the hem is very small, the Bo't shaped hollow may
not be very deep, resulting in all the respective area of the
err having a flat appearance.
In reverse, a very broad hem may cover, or nearly cover,
the Bo't �haped hollow, and may extend into the anti-helix
area.
BACK BORDER PECULIARITIES.
i-?- - - ? ?
The Darwinian Knot. A small gristly nodule or knot located
near the boundary of the upper and back borders. It is often
scarcely visible, but is easily recognisable to the touch.
The Darwinian Enlargement. A swelling situated about the
middle of the inside of the back border.
The Darwinian Protrusion. A small gristly protrusion,
pointed like the tooth of a saw, which is situated about the
middle of the inside of the back border.
-he Darwinian Pimple. A very pronounced gristly protrusion
situated on the outside edge the b -undary of the upper and
back borders. It is distinguishable from the Darwinian Knot
by its large size, round shape, aid also by the white and
pearly appearance of the skin which covers it. It is very
rare.
Blended Back Border. The back border and the lower fold of
the Anti-helix combine and form one unit, making the Boat
ohaued hollow aunear short in length, and the lobe of the ear
excessively elongated.

BACK BORDER PECULIARITIES.
Rumpled Border. All the border is rumpled and has a
corrugated appearance.
Indented Border. At the boundary of the upper and back
borders an indication appears in the hem of the border.
Scarred & Frozen Border. The border shows the result of
freezing, old wounds or chilblains. It may even be absent,
as the result of an amputation.
Use the Code Reference . Add the letter 3 for
scarred and A if the border has been amputated.
BACK BORDER (OPENING OF HEM).
Due to variation of the width of the border hem, the Boat
Shaped hollow width will be varied in different individuals.
Where the Boat Shaped opening is wide, it is referred to
as being open. When it is very narrow, it is referred to as
adhering, indicating thet the edge of the border hero and the
fold of the Anti-Helix appear to be joined together.

FORM OF THE LOBE.
Divided lobe. In this case, the boat-shaped hollow does not
end at the boundary of the back border with the lobe, but crosses
the surface of the lobe. When the hollow is pronounced, the
lobe is said to be divided.
Crossed lobe. The boat-shaped hollow crosses the lobe lightl.v,
but distinctly.
Medium crossed lobe. Where the boat-shaped hollow crosses to
'-?? bout the mid' le of the lobe, it is referred to as a medium cruising.

Split lobe. Females often pierce the lobe to Introduce
earrings. In talcing out the rings, they sometimes tear the
lobe vertically and the tear remains.
Pointed lobe. The lobe has a triangular form with a pro-
nounced peak.
Square lobe. The lobe is of decidedly square shape. These
lobes are fairly rare, and almost always are of a prominent anu
very thick pattern.
Oblique interior lobe. The lobe, instead of hanging vertic-
ally towards the bottom of the figure, is turned slightly in*
wards towards the skull.
Oblique exterior lobe. The direction of this lobe is turned
outwards from the skull.
Lobe twisted forward. The upper part of the lobe is turned
to the front, the lower part to the rear. The whole lobe has a
twisted appearance.
Hollow shaped lobe. An obvious hollow crossing nearly two
thirds of the height of the lobe.
Comma shaped lobe. Has a pronounced and elongated hollow
in the shape of a comma.
Oblinue bank wrinkle on lobe. A wrinkle commencing at the
boundary of the lobe with the Tragus and crossing the lobe at
an angle to the rear.
Islet lobe The lobe has a furrow running right through it;
the furrow divides in the centre of the lobe, leaving a promin-
ent islet present. This feature is exceedingly rare.
Hnlrv lobe. Generally in adults a fine down is present on^
the lobe. In some adults, the down develops into true hair, un

INCLINATION OF THE ANTI-TRAGUS.
The slope of the Anti-Tragus may vary
considerably in different in^v^ a �!* ne ?iy
slope may be to the rear or it may he nearly
vertical. Five sab-dlvlsions are provided,
as illustrated.
PROFILE OF THE ANTI--RAOUS.
The profile of the Anti-Tragus refers
in fao? tc Its shape, which may vary between
concavity and extreme convexity.
The concave Anti-Tragus is very rare.

PROFILE OF ANTITRAGUS




INVERSION OF THE ANTI-TRAGUS.
This sub-division is not recommended. It is considered
too fine a distinction to be readily seen.
The sub-division refers to the inward or outward inclin-
ation of the Anti-Tragus, and it is only included beoause it
may, in an isolated instance, appeal to some observer.
SIZE OF THE ANTI-TRAGUS.
The illustrations are self-explanatory and provide a good
example of the normal Anti-Tragus shape, except, of course, for
size variations.

PECULIARITIES OF THE ANTI -TRAGUS.
Anti-Tragus blended with the Helix. The Anti?Tragus sometimes blends, by
the aid of a supplementary furrow which crosses the shell, with the
original border (part of the Helix).
Pointed Tragus & Anti-Tragus. The peculiarity worthy of note, is that
both are pointed.
Post Anti-Tragian Incision# A very pronounced furrow is present which
separated tlie Anti-Tragus and the lobe from the back border and the lower
fold. The Anti-Tragus, in this instance, protrudes noticeably.
Broken at Anti-Tragus. The balance of the ear bends sharply outwards at
the Anti-Tragus. Such an ear would be more noticeable because of its
extreme protrusion.
Abrupt Boat Shaped Hollow Termination at Anti-Tragus. Usually the boat-
sHaped hollow merges into the boundary of the lobe. When the hollow term-
inates abruptly, it is, therefore, a noticeable peculiarity. This feature
is included under Anti-Tragus peculiarities, because it occurs in the
Anti-Tragian area.
PECULIARITIES OF THE TRAGUS.
Pointed Tragus. The free end of the Tragus is noticeably pointed.
Bifurcated Tragus. The free end of the Tragus is divided into two peaks.
MISCELLANEOUS PECULIARITIES OF THE BAR.
Narrow channel. The channel between the Tragus and Anti-Tragus may be
very narrow in an individual. This is a noticeable peculiarity.
Contiguous Furrows. Sometimes re Middle Fold and the Original Border,
both being obvious, run close, rd parallel, to one another. Such a
peculiarity is noted under this heading.
Separated Furrows. The situation explained in Contiguous Furrows is
similar, except that both units are widely separated.
Hairy Tragus & Anti-Tragus. Not illustrated. If reference to such a
feature is required, use the following code reference indicator;-

UPPER FOLD.
The upper fold can vary from none at all to a very prominent
Feature.
The illustration appearing over "Effaced" is an interesting
example of a readily Identifiable ear. There is sufficient space
available in the ear for the Upper Fold, and yet none is present.
This effect gives the upper rear portion of the ear a very flat
appearance.
LOWER FOLD.
The differences illustrated here relate to the position of
the lower fold should it be turned inwards in the ear (concavity),
or turned outwards (convexity), and by how much.
The sub-dividlon is not recommended, because it would be
difficult to observe, except in extreme instances.
It has only been include ? incase it appeals to some
observer.

PROTRUSION OP THE EAR,
The ear may protrude either wholly or in part from the head.
It is a very noticeable feature, and is easily recognised.
Ugper Protrusion. All the upper part of the ear stands out
from the skull.
Rear Protrusion. The rear portion of the ear stands out
from the skull.
Lower Protrusion. The lower portion of the ear stands out from
the skull.
Total Protrusion. All the ear stands out from the skull in an
obvious manner.
Glued Top. The upper part of the ear touches the skull;
the lower part is at the normal distance. This type of ear is very
rare.
NOTE. Ears broken at the Anti-Tragus protrude abnormally, also.
However, it is not a gradual protrusion, but more an abrupt protrusion
from the Anti?Tragus. An example of this type of ear appears under
Peculiarities of the Anti-Tragus. Code Reference
FURTHER MISCELLANEOUS PECULIARITIES OP THE BAR.
Straight shell. The ear has an elongated form.
Large shell. The distance between the Tragus and Anti-
Tragus is considerable.
Low shell. The distance between the middle fold and the
Anti-Tragus is small.
High shell. The distance between the middle fold and the
Anti-Tragus is considerable.
Vertical Insertion. The upper part of the ear leans towards the
face. The general direction of the ear is vertical.

Several branched. The upper fold divides twice instead of once.
Upper fold .joining the border. Instead of rising almost vertically,
the upper fold changes its direction abruptly and merges with the upper
border to the rear,
Hematome or "Cauliflower" ear. Usually found among boxers, profess-
ional wrestlers and gymnasts. All the upper part of the ear becomes a
shapeless swelling, as the result of continual injury.
Pushed back shell. All the shell appears to be pushed back in the
auditory canal.
Oblique insertion. The upper part has an obvious trend to the rear,
while the lower part protrudes in a forward direction.
The difference between this type and the pushed back shell can be
seen in the wider opening to the auditory canal of the oblique insertion
type.
Crossed shell. The original border crosses the shell and joins the
lower fold at the back of the anti-tragus.

VOICE AND LANGUAGE.
Before proceeding to the balance of the body, there are a few items
which should be pointed out as of value in Personal Identification, one of
which is the voice, thus: in a man, whether the voice is deep, piercing
or feminine: in a female, if the voice is masculine; the presence of a
llapT peculiarities of pronunciation; stuttering; beware of
criminals imitate stuttering to deceive their pursuers,

Nationality, Take note of the differences of accent. These would
have to be described in full, thus: American accent, Cockey accent, etc.
Page 20U.




THE LOOK.
Some people have a frank look and will look another straight
in the face; others have the reverse and will not look at the
person with whom they are conversing. One may expect to see people
whose eyes are constantly on the move, also those who blink fre-
quently", and, in reverse, those who don't, giving them a slow,* staring
appearance. Such detail should be observed and noted in a subsequent
description.

THE DRESS.
Habits of dress should be observed. The dress should be examined
to qee If rlean or dirty: whether the choice of colours is loud or
sub-dued; of good quality or not; whether a hat is habitually worn or
a tie or a coat; whether the clothes are worn in slovenly or neat manner.
All such details assist in the identification of an individual .

THE GESTURES.
The gesture is a voluntary of involuntary movement which we give
to our body. Gestures vary according to nationality and social position
of individuals. Frequent gesticulation with the hands is a typical habit
of the French and Italian races. The habit of an individual poking with
a finger at the person to whom he or she is talking should be noted, as
should the habit of winking to emphasise a point made.
GENERAL CARRIAGE.
V
One should note the general carriage of the individual; whether
they walk in a brisk decided manner and hold themselves erectly or whether
they shuffle along or walk slowly; or carry both hands in the pockets, or
only one, and note which hand it is.

Page 208.




SHOULDERS.
The breadth and carriage of the shoulders can
be of significance also, as these illustrations
show. It is possible to see a long neck in con-
junction with sloping shoulders or a short neck
and square shoulders.
An indication of this type is important,
since it can be recognised in an individual with
his back turned to the observer.
Use the combined shoulder and neck reference,
if necessary. Thus, the combined long neck and
sloping shoulder reference would be V 23.
Do not be misled, however, by the square
shoulders produced by a padded coat. The person
described to you may have been originally examined
in a shirt only.

THE FEET.
The position, in standing or walking, of the feet, if observed,
often provides an outstanding peculiarity which is distinctive.
The illustrations are self-descriptive.
The features described affect the outline of any subsequent
footprints.
Two good examples, not related to the present subject matter, of
an unconscious habit, are illustrated in the central illustrations.
It will bo noted that one man tucks his right index finger into the
palm of his hand, whereas the other holds it out stiffly.
Since practically all the inhabitants in this country wear foot
covering, it is not proposed to deal with missing toes. We are con-
cerned primarily with visible peculiarities.

A straight outline. A perfectly straight alignment
from shoulders to feet.
A wedge-shaped outline. Shoulders wide and body out-
line width reducing towards the feet,
A reverse wedge-shaped outline. Widely spread feet
and bodily width reducing towards the shoulders.

described toyou, may possibly be present, and should be noted in addition to

The fact that a person has an appendix operation s car is not one tenth as

FINAL REMARKS.
The purpose of the book has been to point out to you where to look, and
what to look for, on an individual for the purpose of identifying that person
again, either to yourself, or to another person, by a word picture, or ??Portrait
Parle' of the identifying detail that you have observed on a previous occasion,
A person?s skill in the art of recognition of other people by this method
can be increased by the constant practice of observing other oeople and noting
how different in appearance they all are. You can gain efficiency by utilising
the idle moment, when sitting in a bus or tram, or in the street. Observe your
fellow-men with "seeing eyes". Before long, you will find that you have gained
such a state of proficiency that in a quick glance you will automatically recog-
nise, and record, the essential positive identifying detail .n another person.
Such a facility should be an essential detail in every Police Officer?s
ability, and he should be able to converse with his fellow officers on the subject,
in such a manner that they will be able to conjure a mental picture of the person
who is being described to them from the detail given.
Remember, that a combination of ordinary Identifying features is the secret
of positive identification, and the greater number of features gathered, or ob-
served, the more certain becomes the identification.
Page 2 20.




For instance, assuming that one particular identifying feature
occurs once in every four persons, then a nan. 6ft. . with black hair.
and blue eyes, that is four details, will be round once in every 256
persons, �.
If, however, we are able to say that the man is middle aged. 6ft..
with black hair which has a circular insertion and is curly, a concave
nose with a straight base, a receding chin with a short~dlmple, a long
vertical central Inter-eyebrow wrinkle, and a wide mouth, then we have
described 12 details, ana, on the same formulae, we may expecttofind
that man only once in 16,777,216 persona.
Take a mental note of this fact, therefore, and learn to look at
another person with " seeing eyes?, and learn to describe what you have
seen in terms which provide a "picture portrait" of a person to others.
By so doing, you will become efficient in a subject which should be in-
cluded as an essential in every law enforcement officer's knowledge of
the elements of his profession.
