FOREWORD
On the occasion o\f the Confer-
ence of Communist and Workers?
Parties of Countries within the
Sphere of British Imperialism, the
London District Committee of the
Communist Party publishes this
brief record of the solidarity
of the progressive working people
of London with the peoples of
other lands oppressed by our com-
mon enemy, British Imperialism.
In so few pages we can only
give glimpses of the efforts of suc-
cessive generations who have built
up a great tradition which we Com-
munists are proud to help carry
forward.
Never was this solidarity more
needed than today, when the
peoples of the colonies and of
Britain have everything to gain
from fighting together in a common
alliance against the common enemy.
In the words of Harry Pollitt:
?The colonial peoples are fellow
fighters, who stand in the forefront
of the great battles against the com-
mon enemy. They serve the interests
of the British people no less than
their own.
?Their dauntless courage and
heroism, their sacrifice and deter-
mination put us all to shame. We
in Britain are in danger of losing
our national independence, while
the colonial people are fighting to
achieve it.
?It is only our common struggle
that can win a united victory on
the basis of national independence
and equal rights, and lead to a
new fraternal association when vic-
tory is won.?
JOHN MAHON
Secretary, London District
Communist Party


LONDON LABOUR
and
COLONIAL FREEDOM
THE BRITISH working class, ?the first-born sons of modern
industry?, to use the words of Marx, developed with the industrial
revolution of the second half of the eighteenth century. It was born
in the struggles of early trade unionism, meeting bitter opposition
from the rising capitalist class. Side by side with the movement of
the workers for better conditions grew up radical and democratic
organisations which sought to win political rights for the mass of the
people.
From their very beginnings these bodies demonstrated their solid-
arity with the forces of revolution abroad. When the people of France
in 1789 rose against the despotism by which the rule of the landed
aristocracy was maintained, their victory was welcomed by radicals
of all shades.
IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
The London Corresponding Society?the first rudimentary working-
class organisation?was formed to spread the ideals set forth in Tom
Paine?s Rights of Man and to win support for the French
Revolution. So strong was this movement that the reactionary Govern-
ment of Pitt rushed through legislation declaring the Corresponding
Society illegal, and brought its leaders to trial on charges of treason.
The London jury refused to convict them, but the repression con-
tinued and in 1799 the trade unions themselves were declared illegal.
In the twenty-five-year struggle against this piece of class legisla-
tion, the unions built up a tradition of militancy and gained invaluable
experience of the use made by the employing classes of the State
machine to maintain their domination.
As the working class developed in political consciousness, new
organisations came into being to win political power. During the fight
for the reform of Parliament, the London Working Men?s Association
was formed to secure political rights of the workers, and after the
failure to win working-class representation in 1832, it was this organisa-
tion which produced, in 1838, the People?s Charter.


The Charter became the rallying point for a great revolutionary
movement which, from the start, recognised that the struggle of the
working class was an international one. Thus Bronterre O?Brien, one
of the Chartist leaders, wrote in 1838:
?Ireland has no possible means of extricating herself from the
frightful state of destitution and bondage in which her oppressors
hold her, without the assistance of the men of Great Britain. . . .
Well then, seeing that the productive classes of the two Islands have
the same wants and the same enemies; why should they not look for-
ward to the same remedy, and make common cause against the-
common oppressor??
In 1846, Julian Harney, addressing the German Democratic Society
for the Education of the Working Mases, showed the need for an,
ever wider solidarity:
?The cause of the people in all countries is the same ?the cause of
labour, enslaved and plundered labour. . . . Working men of all
nations, are not your grievances, your wrongs, the same? Is not your
good cause, then, one and the same also? We may differ as to the
means or different means necessary, but the great end ?the veritable
emancipation of the human race ?must be the one aim and end of all.?
In 1848 the Society of Fraternal Democrats was set up to unite
the democrats from many countries then living in London. Many
active Chartists took part, prominent among them being Harney and
Ernest Jones.
MARX SPOKE
It was at a meeting of this Society, held in Drury Lane in November
1847, to commemorate the Polish Insurrection of 1831 against Russian
Tsarist oppression, that Karl Marx, speaking on behalf of the Belgian
democrats, expressed the common feeling towards the Chartists? cam-
paign. The democrats of Belgium, he said, felt that the Chartists of
England were the real democrats, and that the moment they carried
the six points of the Charter, the road to liberty would be opened to
the whole world:
?Effect this grand object, then, you working men of England, and
you will be hailed as the saviours of the whole human race."
The goal was not yet in si�ht, however; the Chartists failed in
their immediate objective, but they left behind a tradition of working-
class militancy and international solidarity which has persisted down
to our own time. The Fraternal Democrats proved the direct fore-
runners of the First International.
The hatred of London working men for the savage suppression of
the Continental revolutions was well demonstrated by the draymen of
Barclay Perkins? brewery when in 1850 they staged a warm reception;
for the Austrian butcher, Haynau.


Fresh from his atrocities against the Hungarian patriots, and parti-
cularly the flogging of women, Haynau had come on a visit to
London. But his reputation was well known among the London wor-
kers, and when they heard of his official visit to the brewery, the word
went round. On his appearance, he was attacked by the angry draymen
.and beaten and finally forced to take refuge in a dustbin!
. . Sun Never Sets, But Blood Never Dries?
One of the great Chartist leaders, Ernest Jones, continued to fight
for the workers? cause through the columns of the People s Paper;
it was he who, speaking of the British Empire, declared: ?On its
colonies the sun never sets, but the blood never dries??. He exposed
the oppression of India by the East India Company in partnership with
the British Government, and when the ?Mutiny? broke out in 1857
he urged the British people to support the Indian cause:
?We bespeak the sympathy of the English people for their Hindu
brethren. Their cause is yours?their success is, indirectly, yours as
well. The fearful atrocities committed have nothing to with the
g�eat cause at issue?that cause is just, it is holy, it is glorious.?
He protested violently against the bestial hysteria of the ruling class
and its press. The Times, in its ?wild, wanton and wicked demand
for native blood.?
In 1865 the brutalities of Governor Eyre of Jamaica in putting down
,a rising of plantation workers brought forth a petition to Parliament,
signed by leaders of London?s trade unions:
?Your petitioners as labourers look on the cause of the labourers
in Jamaica as their own ... we demand the exemplary punishment
of all who have been guilty of the barbarous and illegal acts in the
suppression of the insurrection.?
In the following year, when the great demonstration called by the
London Trades Council to demand reform of Parliament was met
with police violence, the Beehive in an editorial drew a parallel
between the methods of the ruling class in London and in the West
Indies, and pointed the moral that the London working class must
recognise its common interests with the subject peoples of the colonies.
This sentiment of international fraternity found its fullest expres-
sion in 1864 with the foundation of the Industrial Working Men?s
Association in London. It cannot! be stressed too strongly that in
this event the London working-class movement played a historic part
and in particular the London Trades Council, whose leaders formed
the greater part of the first Committee of the International. Marx,
in his inaugural address, laid stress on the need for common action:
?Past experience has shown how disregard of that bond of brother-
hood which ought to exist between the workmen of different countries.


and incite them to stand firmly by each other in all their struggles
for emancipation, will be chastised by the common discomfiture of
their incoherent efforts.?
THE IRISH STRUGGLE
International solidarity of the workers animated all the proceedings
of the International, indeed, and it supported strikers in many Euro-
pean countries and helped the Polish Democrats. But there was an
oppressed nation nearer home.
In the forefront of the struggle for emancipation were the people
of Ireland, and the International made clear the importance of the
Irish struggle to the English workers; in its resolution of 1869, drafted
by Marx, the General Council said:
?A people which enslaves others forges its own chains . . . the
essential preliminary condition of the emancipation of the English
working class is the turning of the present compulsory union, that
is slavery, of Ireland with England, into an equal and free union,
if that is possible, or into full separation, if this is inevitable.?
The International had come into existence during the great American
Civil War, and throughout supported the North against the ?oligarchy
of 300,000 slave-holders?.
LONDONERS HELP COMMUNARDS
During the heroic struggle of the first Workers? Government, the
Paris Commune of 1871, the London workers sent a medical detach-
ment which worked in the front rank of the Communards; and they
made a number of public protests against the ferocious massacres
and other repressive measures of the French capitalist class when the
Commune was defeated.
The great slump of the 1870s ushered in the age of modern imperial-
ism, as a result of intensified competition for markets, sources of
raw materials, and spheres for investment of surplus capital. From
this period, too, date the attempts of the imperialist bourgeoisie to
enlist the support of the working class for their predatory aims of
domination over less technically advanced countries.
Despite this, we find numerous working men?s political clubs peti-
tioning Parliament in 1874 against the invasion of Burma. As socialism
developed in the great labour struggles of the 1880s the more militant
leaders of the working class exposed the true nature of imperialist
aims.
William Morris, who had entered politics as an opponent of Dis-
raeli?s aggressive policy in the East, lived and worked in London during
the ?Bos and ?9os. He tore the veil of pious platitudes from the rapa-


cious warmongering of successive governments. In February 1885 he
contributed an article for the first number of Commonweal on
?Imperialism v Socialism?:
?Markets, markets, markets! Who shall deny that this is the drone-
bass ever welling up from beneath the shrill bawling of ?Pioneers
of civilisation?, ?restorers of order?, ?avengers of national honour?,
?purveyors of gospel light?. . . .?
In the following month the Socialist League issued a Manifesto on
the Sudan (signed among others by Eleanor Marx), which pinpoints
the motive forces of imperialism in the most direct way:
?A wicked and unjust war is now being waged by the ruling and
propertied classes of this country, with all the resources of civilisation
at their back, against an ill-armed and semi-barbarous people whose
only crime is that they have risen against a foreign oppression which
those classes themselves admit to have been infamous.?
?BLOODY SUNDAY?
Throughout the 1880s the London working class regarded the Irish
question as a matter of special concern, and carried on an uninter-
rupted campaign for the liberation of the Irish people by meetings
and demonstrations. In 1887 the Trades Union Congress had suspended
Standing Orders so as to pass a resolution condemning coercion in
Ireland; and on Sunday, November 13 the Metropolitan Radical
Federation called for a protest demonstration in Trafalgar Square.
Despite a police ban, thousands of London workers marched behind
their red banners and had to be forcibly prevented from reaching
the Square by 4,000 police and hundreds of troops. Three men were
killed, hundreds wounded and arrested on that memorable ?Bloody
Sunday?; the attitude of the bourgeoisie to this demonstration of
solidarity was well described by R. B. Cunninghame Graham, later
a Socialist, but then still a Liberal M.P., who went to support the
demonstration, and was assaulted by the police:
?The tops of the houses and hotels were crowded with well-dressed
women, who clapped their hands and cheered with delight when
some miserable and half-starved working man was knocked down
and trodden under foot."
Nor was the movement for solidarity a one-way affair. Two years
later, when the dockers of London were engaged in one of the greatest
labour struggles of modern times, thousands of pounds came in con-
tributions from Australia alone.
In 1890, May Day, the day of international working class solidarity,
was celebrated for the first time by Londoners marching behind their
Union banners. Morris, in his last article (published in the May Day
issue of Justice in 1896) wrote of the new phase of imperialism:


?Look how the whole capitalist world is stretching out long
arms towards the barbarous world and grabbing and clutching in
eager competition at countries whose inhabitants don?t want them;
nay, in many cases, they would rather die in battle, like the valiant
men they are, than have them. . . . And what is all this for? For
the spread of abstract ideas of civilisation, for pure benevolence, for
the honour and glory of conquest? Not at all. It is for the opening of
fresh markets to take in all the fresh profit-producing wealth which
is growing greater and greater every day; in other words, to make
fresh opportunities for waste, the waste of our labour and our lives.?
AGAINST THE BOER WAR
A few years later the imperialist ambitions of Chamberlain and
Rhodes had brought England into war with the Boer republics. The
middle-class ?socialists? of the Fabian Society played a full part in
the stream of aggressive jingoism which was poured out by the ruling
class, and published their views in Fabianism and the Empire.
Nevertheless, meetings of protest against the war, although con-
stantly broken up by paid hooligans andf misguided soldiers, were
organised by the S.D.F. and the Labour Party. Men like Harry Quelch,
who had been at the centre of the London labour movement since the
1889 Dock Strike, vigorously opposed the Fabians.
Theodore Rothstein in the summer of 1900 fought Hyndman's pro-
posal that the Social Democratic Federation should leave the anti-war
fight to the Radicals, as not of interest to Socialists. Rank-and-file
support ini the S.D.F. for the anti-imperialist fight was shown by the
election of Rothstein, at the top of the poll, for the Federation?s
executive.
At this time, too, the labour movement was actively campaigrling
against the continued oppression in India, which H. M. Hydman him-
self denounced in 1904 as ?the most criminal misrule that has ever
afflicted humanity?.
In the early years of the twentieth century, London lost for a
time the services of the great labour leader, Tom Mann. He went
to New Zealand in 1901 and was active in the labour movement
there and in Australia for the next eight years. On his way home to
England in 1910, Mann spent two months in South Africa, where
he fought against the prevailing tendency to sectionalism in the trade
unions.
In speeches at crowded meetings all over the Union, he insisted
on the need for unity on a class basis, regardless of colour; his fighting
spirit was to have a deep influence on W. L. Andrews, who was
later to lead the South African Communist Party; and it ensured, as
Andrews? biographer puts it, ?the most successful Labour Day ever?.
In 1914, after shootings and deportations had weakened the leadership


of the Rand miners, it was again Tom Mann who went out ?to
endeavour? as he put it, ?to weld working class forces together?.
TOM MANN IN SOUTH AFRICA
After the bloody terror which followed the General Strike of 1922,
Mann was again invited to South Africa, and at packed meetings
from the Cape to Pretoria he again helped to rally the workers? ranks.
Meanwhile the London Trades Council took the initiative in raising
funds for the famous food ship that the British workers sent to Dublin
in 1913 in support of the workers of that city, attacked by the
employers in a general lockout. The same year, it played an active
part in the campaign of protest against the shooting of South African
miners and the deportation of their leaders.
The fight for international solidarity during the First World War
was confined at first to the small Socialist groups which remained
loyal to the workers ?the left wing of the B.S.P. (which won a
majority by 1916), the pacifist section of the 1.L.P., the S.L.P. in
Scotland, etc.
Later the strike struggles launched by the revolutionary Shop
Stewards movement, in London, Sheffield, Manchester and Glasgow
strengthened the fight against the war.
But the real turning point came in November 1917, when the
Socialist Revolution in Russia changed the course of world history.
Not only did it open a new era in the struggle of the colonial and
dependent peoples, but in Britain support for the young Soviet Repub-
lic became the central political issue.
?HANDS OFF RUSSIA?
In the early spring of 1919 the National ?Hands Off Russia?
Committee was established, Tom Mann (now General Secretary of
the Engineers) and Alex. Gossip (Secretary of the National Furnishing
Trades Association) playing an active part, by the side of Gallacher
and many trade union leaders. This opened a great movement, which
won the majority of the working-clas movement against British inter-
vention.
Already in April, 1919 a joint conference of the Trades Union
Congress and Labour Party demanded the withdrawal of all British
troops from Russia. Many months of agitation followed, but the right-
wing trade union leaders took no action to force the Government
to obey. Then in the Spring of 1920 the Polish reactionaries (backed
by the British and French Governments) launched an unprovoked
attack on Soviet Russia.


Almost immediately (May 10, 1920) London dockers engaged in
loading munitions for Poland on a London freighter, the Jolly George ,
went on strike in response to Harry Pollitt?s ?Hands Off Russia?
campaign. This raised the whole campaign to a higher level; strike
action if war was restarted began to be freely discussed; and when in
August 1920, the British Government sent an ultimatum to Soviet
Russia, the entire British working class replied with the threat of
a General Strike.
?There was no war with Russia. The Lloyd George-Curzon partner-
ship had arrogantly cried ?Check!? to the advancing Red Army. ?Mate!?
riposted the united working class of Britain, turning the tables in one
move.
?The wielders of power had been met with power ?power ex-
pressing the will of the decisive majority of the working people in this
country, power based on the solid phalanx of 6j million trade
unionists, power residing not merely in a central directing body, but
in the network of local Councils of Action that had sprung up. 350
of them, covering every main centre of population.?
(Hutt ? -Post-War History of the British Working Class )
In the years following the First World War, the problems presented
by intensified colonial exploitation demanded action from the British
labour movement. British atrocities in India (notably the Amritsar
massacre in 1919) and in the suppression of the Egyptian National
Liberation movement, aroused vast protest campaigns, taken up both
by the Communist Party (founded in 1920) and the left-wing elements
of the Labour Party (George Lansbury and others). The Communist
Party actively promoted Britisb-Irish solidarity against the ?Black
and Tan? war of British Imperialism against the people of Ireland.
The Trades Union Congress, meeting at Scarborough in 1925,
adopted by 3,082,000 to 79,000 the following unequivocal resolution
in support of colonial liberation :
?This Trades Union Congress believes that the domination of non-
British peoples by the British Government is a form of capitalist
exploitation, having for its object the securing for British capitalists
(1) of cheap sources of raw materials; (2) the right to exploit cheap and
unorganised labour and to use the competition of that labour to
degrade the workers? standards in Great Britain.
?It declares its complete opposition to imperialism and resolves (1)
to support the workers in all parts of the British Empire in organising
trade unions and political parties in order to further their interests,
and (2) to support the right of all peoples in the British Empire to
self-determination including the right to choose complete separation
from the Empire.?


Only a small minority of the right-wing trade union leaders ventured
to oppose this resolution in open Congress; but they quietly sabo-
taged it from within the General Council in the months that followed.
It was on the initiative and under the direction of the Communist
Party that some of our finest trade unionists went out to the countries
of the Empire in the next few years, with the purpose of helping
actively in the building of a trade union and labour movement in
those countries.
MEERUT
One of the most outstanding examples of this fraternal assistance
was that provided by the work of George Allison from 1926 until
his imprisonment in the following year, and from then until 1929
by Ben Bradley, of the A.E.U. London District Committee, who
put his experience at the service of the Indian workers to such effect
that the year 1928 saw more activity than any previous year in
the history of the Indian labour movement.
In that year occurred the great strike of 150,000 Bombay textile
workers which lasted for six months. The disputed questions in this
strike were referred to committee but in March 1929, three days
before the committee?s findings were published, the entire executive
committee of the Girni Kamgar Union, including Bradley, were
arrested and sent to Meerut, a town at which they were not entitled
to trial by jury. There, for the first time, English workers stood in
dock side by side with their Indian comrades, charged character-
istically, with ?conspiring to deprive the King-Emperor of the sover-
eignty of India?.
After a trial lasting 3y years (and, continued under the second
Labour Government of 1929-31) the prisoners received heavy sen-
tences.
At once the Meerut Prisoners? Defence Committee came into exis-
tence in London to secure the victims? release and to raise funds
for their appeal to the High Court at Allahabad.
LEAGUE AGAINST IMPERIALISM
Subscriptions from working class organisations in England. South
Africa and Australia enabled the fund to be raised in six months
and, as a result of the great popular feeling stirred up by these
events, it was possible to get the sentences reduced. The solidarity
of English and colonial workers had again been strikingly demon-
strated.
In 1927, there had been established the League against Imperialism.
This organisation, under the able leadership of Reginald Bridgeman


and Percy Glading, helped to enlighten the Labour movement on
the colonial struggle. Deputations were organised from time to time
to the Colonial Secretary and India Office, expressing the support
of the London working class for the struggle for national liberation
of the colonial peoples. Annual Conferences were held in London
where representatives of the trade union movement, Labour Party,
Co-op. Guilds and the Communist Party discussed issues and prepared
for campaigns covering Africa, India, Ceylon, the West Indies, Burma,
Malaya and the Middle East countries.
The work of the League went on until 1938, bearing important fruit
in many directions, notably the sustained campaign for Indian
independence.
An illustrious part was played by the Indian M.P., Shapurji Sak-
latvala, who sat for the old working-class citadel of Battersea from
1922 (elected on the Labour Party ticket, though a known member
of the Communist Party) until 1929. In the variety of causes of the
exploited colonial peoples which he courageously championed in the
House of Commons ?the very heart of British imperialism???Sak?
became the acknowledged spokesman of all the oppressed peoples
of the British Empire.
In 1927 the Hands Off China movement had also been started in
support of the Chinese people against the intervention of British
imperialism. A widespread campaign was developed with the support
of trades councils throughout the Greater London area, in the
subsequent years.
During the 19305, despite the poverty and unemployment against
which the labour movement had to fight at home, the rising menace
of Fascism and war became a major concern of the London working
class.
On September 9, 1934, after many weeks of campaigning by the
Communist Party a giant demonstration of 150,000 Londoners in Hyde
Park drowned a proposed meeting of the Mosleyite Fascists and exposed
them as a gang of war-minded thugs, isolated from the people.
This event, and similar ones which followed, were highlights in a
long struggle against the Fascists in London and against the Italian
invasion of Ethiopia (1935).
THEY DIED FOR SPANISH FREEDOM
In 1936, after Republican Spain had been invaded by the Fascist
Powers, there were barricade battles against Fascists and police in the
East End of London, culminating in a great demonstration which
stopped an attempted Fascist march through East London.
While the British Government was participating in the farce of
?non-intervention? in Spain, 2,000 British lads between 1936 and 1938


went out to join the British Battalion of the International Brigade; and
just under 100 Londoners ?a fifth of the total British dead?were killed
in that battle for democracy.
The struggle against colonial oppression went on. From the House
of Commons there constantly came now the speeches of another
Communist M.P., William Gallacher, exposing the power of imperial-
ism and calling for British workers? solidarity with the peoples it
oppressed. A typical example was his speech on February 28. 1938,
on labour conditions in Trinidad:
??Representatives of oil and sugar can come here in all their glory.
dressed up and polished; while in Trinidad there is poverty, suffering,
malnutrition and,death. Yes, men, women and children are being done
to death so that they can pile up fortunes. ... I, like every other
Member on this side, am for the people of Trinidad, and anything we
can do to help them in whatever struggle they make to better their
conditions will be gladly done.?
When the Kayyur peasant leaders in India were held under death
sentence between 1938 and 1940, a campaign was launched by the
Colonial Information Bureau (London) and an appeal to raise funds
was signed by many Members of Parliament, including London M.P.s,
such as D. N. Pritt and R. W. Sorensen and trade union leaders,
J. H. Potts (N.U.R.), Harry Adams (A.U.8.T.W.), Alex Gossip
(N.A.F.T.A.). Over �l,OOO was raised.
Many British Communist and other workers served during the
Second World War in India, Burma and Malaya, bringing back a
new sense of the strength of the colonial peoples? fight and of its
importance for British labour. Among these must be mentioned Clive
Branson, a Londoner whose book, British Soldier in India, played a
valuable part in enlightening British progressives on this question.
Branson was killed in 1944.
POST-WAR STRUGGLES
Since the defeat of Nazi Germany and its allies, Fascist Italy
and Samurai Japan, in the Second World War, the struggle for colonial
liberation has reached unprecedented heights.
Successive British Governments, both Labour and Tory, have
plumbed the depths of atrociousness in their policy of repression and
plunder of the colonies, notably in Malaya since 1948 and in Kenya
since 1952. But in spite of ?Labour? imperialist propaganda among
the workers on a scale which would have made the pioneers of
British Socialism turn in their graves, could they but hear it, resistance
among British workers too has been growing.
A big impetus to this movement was given by increasing efforts
of the Communist Party to bring home to British workers that there
can be no freedom for them without freedom for the colonial peoples.


For example, by the historic conference in London in 1947, when
twenty-one delegates from the Communist Parties of eleven countries
oppressed by British imperialism met to exchange information and
experiences. Between 1945-50, the two Communist M.P.s, William
Gallacher and P. Piratin, consistently raised these issues in the House
of Commons.
But an increasing part is being played also by great numbers of rank-
and-file Labour Party members.
This has been especially true since Lyttelton threw off the mask
of constitutionalism in October 1952 to depose by force the demo-
cratically-elected government of British Guiana when it seemed likely
to threaten the super-profits of the British and American investors.
SUPPORT FOR JAGAN
The Prime Minister, Dr. Cheddi Jagan, was met by a great demon-
stration of sympathy at mass meetings which he addressed in London,
and local Labour Parties and trade union organisations throughout
the country followed London?s lead in expressing their support for
the Guianese people?s struggle for freedom.
Meanwhile, committees have come into existence in London to
further liberation of the colonial peoples: the Kenya Committee, for
example, was formed in April 1953 to assist in the fight against the
reign of terror which has been directed against the African people
of Kenya since August 1952; the Lee Tien Tai Committee, also set
up in 1953, has campaigned against the barbarous sentence passed on
a young Malayan girl accused of possessing arms; supported by 100
M.P.s, this body raised funds for her defence, with the result that
her sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.
The National Council for Civil Liberties has done valuable work
in defending democratic rights in the colonies. Great demonstrations
have been held against the war in Malaya, against the Gold Coast
shootings of 1948, against the Federation of Central Africa.
The tradition of international solidarity, then, is a living tradition,
and the London working class still retains that deep fraternal sym-
pathy with the colonial peoples which we have seen exemplified in
Harney and Ernest Jones, in William Morris and Tom Mann.
As the crisis of imperialism deepens, and as the British workers?
struggle develops, they will find the way, through all obstacles, to
unity and co-operation with the fight for national independence of
the colonial peoples.
The way ahead is well indicated by R. Palme Dutt in his recent
book on The Crisis of Britain, and the British Empire :
?The cause of the colonial peoples is today more than ever indis-
solubly linked with the cause of the working class and of socialism
in Britain. The fight for the ending of imperialism and for the defeat

of the multi-millionaire combines, which have their centre in Britain,
but extend their operations over the entire world, and especially
in the colonial empire, and which are the main basis of Toryism
and reaction in Britain, cannot be fought within the confines of
Britain alone. The victory of the British working class cannot be
won without allies, and the allies of the British working class and of
the entire British people against British imperialism are first and
foremost the colonial peoples.
?It is not only the liberation of the colonial peoples that is at stake.
It is the liberation of Britain!?
BRITISH ROAD TO SOCIALISM
This is the theme of the Communist Party?s programme The British
Road to Socialism, first published four years ago and sold up to date
in nearly 300,000 copies. ?The cause of Britain?s national indepen-
dence?, says our programme, ?is bound up with ensuring that all
nations in the present Empire also enjoy full national rights and
independence?. And here is its programme of fighting demands:
?All relations between the peoples of the present Empire which
are based on political, economic and military enslavement must be
ended, and replaced by relations based on full national independence
and equal rights. This requires the withdrawal of all armed forces
from the colonial and dependent territories and handing over of
sovereignty to Governments freely chosen by the peoples.
?Only by this means can Britain be assured of the normal, supplies
of the vital food and raw materials necessary for her economic life,


obtaining them in equal exchange for the products of British industry,
needed by those countries for their own economic development.
?This would provide the basis for a new, close, voluntary and
fraternal association of the British people and the liberated peoples
of the present Empire to promote mutually beneficial economic ex-
change and co-operation, and to defend in common their freedom
against American imperialist aggression.?
In London 90,000 copies of The British Road to Socialism have
been sold. This is a symbol of the new stage reached in the history
of the London workers' advance in the struggle for Socialism and
national independence in Britain, inextricably bound up for 200
years with the struggle for national independence of the peoples
fighting British colonial oppression.
