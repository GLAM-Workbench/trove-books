PREFACE.
The two following papers owe their origin to a request made last year,
by my friend Dr. Martin, President of the Medical Society, in the name
of that body, to read a paper on some professional subject: I consented
to do so, and read the first paper in November last before the Medical
Society. On its appearing in the Medical Journal for that month, the
public press of Melbourne commented so favourably that I was encour-
aged to write a second paper, which I read before the Medical Society
in February last. I have made some slight alterations to adapt them
for general readers. The tabular statistical portion was a task of such
difficulty that those not conversant with such matters can form no idea of
its difficulty in the absence of any publication bearing directly on the
subject. I considered these statistics necessary hi order to give weight
to my assertions, and to prove to others what I was convinced of myself.
These elaborate tables may not be very interesting to some readers, but
in a matter of such extreme interest and importance it was desirable to
afford the fullest proof when there was question of combating and
removing long existing errors and prejudices, especially when those
errors and prejudices were so ultimately connected with the finest
affections of humanity—maternal love. If any thing I have said in
these essays should hurt that- affection, I trust that my sincere desire to
save the objects of that love will he ample apology, and I claim that
same affection to plead my excuse.
I have studiously avoided venturing any directions as to the treat-
ment of infantile diseases, being satisfied that the best advice I could
give was to send early for the family medical attendant, as fiom long
experience I have arrived at the conclusion that delay in that respect
causes a loss of money and a loss of life; however, if the present
pamphlet should meet the approval of the public, I shall on a future
occasion address parents upon what to do, as well as upon what to avoid,
in respect of the Proper Management of Infancy.


EXCESSIVE MORTALITY OF INFANTS.
On the Mortality of Infante in Victoria, By Charles McCarthy,
M.D., L.F.P.S.G.
[Read before the Medical Society, November 2, 1864.]
Mr. President and Gentlemen,
This is a subject of vast practical importance. It has been ably
discussed by eminent members of the profession, and, I regret to
state, that the public have disregarded their warnings, and continue
to pay the penalty. It is true that sanitary laws and improvements
have been the consequences of these praiseworthy efforts of the
profession; but parents and guardians, and a large portion of the
public, seem as ignorant or as indifferent as they were nearly a
century ago. In fact, ignorance, prejudice, and obstinacy, are as
prevalent and obdurate now, in respect to the laws of health
generally, and especially as to the proper mode of infantile manage-
ment, as when our grandmothers threatened and actually put on the
hot fire-shovel the young “ fairy ” suffering from Tabes Mesenterica.
So far from generally profitting by, and being grateful for, the
advice given by medical men, it has become rather fashionable to
controvert medical opinions, and to boast of acting contrary thereto ;
and on this weakness of human nature, unprincipled men act and
have acted in all ages, whether as quacks or homoeopaths. Every
medical man, however, meets every day with happy exceptions in
persons who exhibit the most scrupulous attention to the advice
given them ; but these are not the people who give em-
ployment to the undertaker. Many years’ experience convinces
me that the members of the medical profession individually possess
hourly opportunities of imparting useful information to mothers of
families, and with an absolute certainty of greatly lessening the
bills of mortality. This interest shown always meets its reward ;
and if medical men used the sacred opportunities afforded them of
instructing heads of families in their duties to their children, they
would procure blessings to those unborn.
I have been struck with the lamentable loss of life among children
as shown by the bills of mortality ; and many years ago, I called
the attention of the public to the fact of our not having any monthly
abstracts of vital statistics published for general information in this
colony. Shortly after my letter appeared in The Argus, our weekly
abstract began to appear, and from these reports, and from my
connection with the General Cemetery, I have collected facts which


prove to me that the mortality of infants in this colony is truly
awful. An experience of twenty years, more than half of which I
have spent in Victoria, has convinced me, beyond a doubt, that it
would not take a great effort to reduce infantile mortality one-half.
I have considered this subject in every point of view, as to what has
been done, what can be done, and what remains to be done, and I
am fully satisfied that fifty per cent, are sacrificed.
It is no exaggeration to say that in no country in the world are so
many lives lost in war as are sacrificed by the ignorance, or pre-
judice, or indifference of parents. In this calculation I make due
allowance for poverty as a cause; but common sense, religion, and
experience, stamp it as blasphemy to attribute this awful sacrifice of
life to the dispensation of Providence. “It is,” to use the words of
Dr. Combe, “more humble and respectful in us to study what are
really the decrees of the Divine will, and endeavour to act in
accordance with them, as the surest way to obtain God’s blessing on
our efforts, than to shut our eyes to the means by which He acts and
manifests His will ; and, while paying Him a well-meant but blind
homage, to disregard or even run counter to His instructions, in the
vain hope that, in compassion for our weakness, He will alter the
order of nature in our favour.”
I shall endeavour to prove that more children die in Victoria, in
proportion to the population and to the general mortality , than in
Great Britain ; but I repeat that a very large proportion of the
infants who die in Europe could have been saved, and that nature
did not intend that so many should perish in their tender age, for
deaths occur precisely in proportion to the neglect of the means
calculated to preserve health and life.
It is true that there is no animal born so helpless, but at the same
time so well provided for, as man. But, if people do not apply the
proper means, it is their fault. I am sure that there is not one
present who has not been called to see a child dying, for the sole
purpose of granting a certificate and preventing a coroner’s inquest.
In looking at the American war, we are shocked at the waste of
human life; but I assert that more lives have been sacrificed in
Britain since the commencement of the war than have fallen in
America, The probability of this will appear in the sequel. In all
nations and in all ages it is accounted a great act to save human
life : this is the special mission of the medical man as the agent of
the Deity; and it is a species of temerity, often amounting to
grievous crime, for ignorance, pride, and prejudice, to mar the efforts
of the constituted agent, and by their endeavours to frustrate his
exertions to save life. I regret to be obliged to say that, in matters
medical, the most dangerous ignorance is that observed among some
wealthy and learned persons, because of the evil influence of the
example they show in their advocacy of quackery and homoeopathy.
Men who would not for the universe willingly cut the thread of life
one moment sooner than they thought Providence intended ; but
who, by countenancing such cheats, absolutely, and at least indirectly,
hinder the means intended to save life.


Before entering on my proof, I shall take the liberty of calling
your attention to one of the greatest causes of infant mortality: I
mean the practice of ignorant women, mothers, and grandmothers,
going their neighbours and giving advice, gratis and
unasked, whenever they hear of a sick child. I have, perhaps,
devoted more of my attention to diseases of children than to any
other part of my profession, and my experience and observation
have proved to me that the greatest obstacle to a child’s recovery is
the visits of these women ; hence, I always have better hopes of
recovery for the children of young mothers whose husbands forbid
the entry of these busybodies.
It is, in my opinion, of great importance to give the public facts
in figures, as being evidence of a tangible character. I shall
therefore quote from the English and other bills of mortality. We
find that in six years, in* England, 143,000 died under one month,
464,000 under one year ; and that in seven years there died in
England, 964,000, and in London, 139,000 under five years of age.
We find that about 26,000 died annually in London under fifteen
years of age, and in 1849 there died 30,000 under fifteen years of
age, the adult deaths being 37,000. In fact, it is found that two
children die for every old person above sixty. Again, it is known
that more deaths occur during the first month, than during the
succeeding twenty-three months. Also, that twenty-four per cent,
die during the first two years ; eleven per cent, die during the next
eight years, that is, thirty-five per cent, under ten years of age —
thus, more than one-third of all born in London die under ten years
of age ; and that nearly forty per cent, of all deaths in England are
under five years, and forty-six per cent, under fifteen years.
According to Dr. Combe, we find that between oue-half and one-
third die under five years ; that more than one-third of all deaths
in England and Wales is under two years of age ; that nearly
one-half of all male children born in towns die under five years ;
and that nearly one-half of all male deaths in Manchester, is of
those under three years • that in that town, one-fourth of the deaths
is of those under one year, one-third under two years, and more
than one-half under five years ; and that the average of the whole
of Europe is, that two out of every nine bom die within the first
year.
If we turn to Belgium we find that nearly one-fourth die within
the first year, and more than two out of every seven die within two
years, and that of male children born in towns, little more than
one-half are alive at the end of five years, and that one-tenth of all
infants born are cut off within the first month ! I shall advert to
this last fact when speaking of the causes of infant mortality. I
shall not trespass more on your attention with European statistics,
but now call your attention to the vital statistics of Victoria.
These I shall quote from two sources, namely, from the Registrar-
General’s report, and from the statistics of interments in the General
Cemetery. I regret that, though I can quote the English statistics
of 1863, I cannot give you later Victorian than 1862 ; but I can


give you the General Cemetery interments, to the Ist of July,
1864, completing eleven years.
I have no means of referring to the Old Cemetery, as the manner
in which it has been conducted, or rather neglected, is«a disgrace to
Melbourne, Trustees have been recently appointed, I trust that they
will improve matters.
In comparing the deaths under one and five years in Victoria with
England and Wales, and in Melbourne and suburbs with London,
respectively, we find the balance against us, It is the same if we
compare the deaths under one and five years to the whole population.
But in comparing the deaths under one and five years to the births,
the balance is slightly in our favour, except in comparing the deaths
under one to the births, as regards Melbourne and London. The
same holds when comparing deaths under five to those living under
five, Melbourne being more fatal than London; and in this last calcula-
tion worse still,if confined to Melbourne Proper,wdiere, instead of 7’9
per cent, for Melbourne and suburbs, it rises to 8 - 6 per cent. But in
comparing deaths at all ages with England and London, we find the
ratio in our favour ; but the object of this paper is to call attention
to the deaths under five years. The above will appear more clearly
given in a tabular form.
From Table No. 1, it evidently appears that though the general
mortality of Victoria and Melbourne is considerably lower than that
of England and London, respectively, it is not so in respect of
deaths under five years. Again, the proportion of children living
under one and five years to the whole population is very little higher
than in England ; it is true that the proportion of persons living
above sixty years in England is higher than obtains in Victoria, but
it is not those above sixty that make up the bills of mortality ; as
above stated, two infants die for every one above sixty. There is
one fact of great importance seen in this table, namely, that more
than half the deaths under five years occur in the four summer months.
The influence of the summer heat is not much observed in the deaths
of adults in Victoria. In England, it is the winter that is most
fatal to children. Tables 2 and 3, show the influence of the seasons
on mortality, both in Melbourne and through the colony, under and
over five years. These tables show not only that the summer months
are the most fatal, especially as to children, but that the months
succeeding summer are more fatal than those immediately preceding
summer, I will prove this also from the interments in the General
Cemetery.
Tables 4 and 5 show the mortality from sixteen diseases that cause
the greatest mortality at all ages, namely, 6,509 out of a total of
9,071 deaths caused by about 100 diseases (excluding 938 violent
deaths). Table the 6th shows the per centage of deaths of males and
females for each month at all ages. Scarlatina and diphtheria being
epidemics, are a kind of exception as to the fatality of the months ;
9 per cent, in the colony, and 5 per cent, in Melbourne were violent
deaths.

We find that the above sixteen diseases carried off above 71 per
cent, in the colony, and above 75 per cent, in Melbourne, and that
of these diseases 57 per cent, in the colony and 61 per cent, in
Melbourne, occurred in the six summer months. In Table No. 14,
will be seen the diseases that carry off children under one and five
years of age.
I shall now call your attention to the books of the Melbourne
General Cemetery, which are kept with extreme exactness, and there-
fore can be relied on, and extend over a period of eleven years.
As shown in Tables 6 and 7, there were 32,245 interments ;
12,370 under one year, 15,805 under two years, 18,229 under five
years ; that is above 38, 49, and 56 per cent, were under one, two, and
five years respectively—(those under five include those under one and
two in this calculation, but not in the tables) —and that of those
under one year there died in the four summer months 49 per cent,
of males and 50 per cent, of females, as seen in Table No. 10. The
larger per centage of deaths of female children as seen in Table
No. 7, is owing to the small proportion of female adults in the
colony. In comparing the deaths under one and five in Melbourne
and suburbs from the Registrar’s returns as shown in Table No. 1,
with the interments in the General Cemetery, we find the latter to
exceed the former ; this is probably owing to the fact that the
Cemetery returns include the still-born, which the Victorian and
English returns do not include (the still-born interments amounted
during the last ten months to 203, averaging 20 per month, there
might be a slight exaggeration here as the fees for such interments
are less than for those born alive.)
Tables 8 and 9 show the great mortality of infants, and its preva-
lence in the summer months. Table No. 10, shows the same.
No. 11, shows the per centage of interments in the different
months during eleven years at all ages.
For the purpose of generalizing tables Nos. 6 and 7, I may state
that the male to the female interments from 1853 to 1864 were as
58 78 to 4T22 ; and that the male to the female population of the
colony from 1853 to 1862, as an average was 62'64 to 37 36 ; and
in 1862 the male to the female population as 6082 to 3918, and
the deaths 58 - 53 to 41-47 ; and in Melbourne the deaths 56’52 to
43’48 of all ages. I fear that I have been tiresome in figures, but I
consider it a duty to the public on the part of those entrusted with
the management of public institutions, to publish from time to time
interesting facts connected with their management, and let others
draw conclusions from those facts according to their different views
of them. Hence I have given various tables to enable others to see
the subject in different points of view.
I shall now shortly enumerate the principal causes of infantile
mortality according to my experience ; I shall state them in the order
of their fatality.
Ist. Improper diet as to quantity ox quality, table 4 shows this,
inasmuch as error in diet is the most frequent cause of the most
fatal of these diseases.


2nd. Improper clothing, or setting at defiance the climate and the
seasons.
3rd. Impure air, especially in houses having water under the floor,
and saturated with night-soil, as a great part of Melbourne is. lam
persuaded that any language of mine could not exaggerate the extent
or virulence of this evil, especially in respect of infant mortality.
Patients under such circumstances often sink, notwithstanding the
most skilful and unremitting attention ; while others rapidly recover
on removal to higher or healthier localities without any treatment.
4th. Want of early or of sufficient medical attendance. I have
already alluded to that fruitful cause of Infant mortality, namely,
the meddling of ignorant women; and to what else can be attributed
that startling statement of Quetelet, that one-tenth of all children
die within the first month ! that four times as many die within the
first as within the second month, or even as die during the second
and third years, or from the age of seven to twenty-four years.
It is manifest that in the majority of such cases no medical man
had been in attendance at the birth ; for during the space of twenty
years I cannot remember six of the children of those whom I
attended dying in the first month. Plence I believe that it was
ignorant women who attended at such births, and put the extin-
guisher on those infants by exposing them to cold immediately
after birth, or by giving improper food as gruel, butter, &c. In
Melbourne, some time ago, I was considered very unreasonable by a
grandmother for finding fault with her for giving the new-born baby
“half-and-half,” ale and porter, a few hours after birth. Another
very common and grievous error is the habit of compressing the
child by bandaging it too tightly. I saw a double hernia in a male
child a fortnight old, lately, in consequence of this cause. I know
that some attribute this early mortality to the exposure of infants in
the absence of careful protection at church when baptized. Certainly
this matter requires more attention to comfort in some of our churches
than is at present paid, both as regards the mother and child. I
may lastly mention homoeopathy and quackery in general, as giving
employment to the undertaker.
1 believe that the above four divisions include almost all the princi-
pal causes of the great infantile mortality to which I have called
your attention, but the consideration of these causes I must defer to
a future occasion, as well as the comparison with the vital statistics
of the other Australian Colonies. I cannot conclude these remarks
without recording my testimony of the fact, that very much less
attention is paid to the welfare of children in Melbourne than in
Europe; that opinion I expressed eleven years ago to a medical
friend. Any person driving through Melbourne may observe it, if
in nothing else than the number of children with uncovered heads
exposed to the summer sun; not the least of the causes of infant
mortality.

My friend Doctor Fetherston of the Lying-in-Hospital, desirous of
corroborating my views as to improper feeding, on the same evening
produced the body of a child with ruptured stomach before the
Society ; his remarks on that occasion were so important, that I deem
it a public benefit to transcribe them here as published in the
Medical Journal for November,
Ruptured Stomach from improper feeding.
“ Dr. Fetherston, Eesident Surgeon of the Lying-in-Hospital,
exhibited the body of a female child, aged six weeks, presenting the
following morbid phenomena ; the liver and spleen were enormously
enlarged, the liver specially so, and it was gorged with bile. The
contiguous structures were infiltrated with effused bile, and the body
generally was jaundiced. The stomach was distended with sago,
and ruptured at its larger curviture, its contents escaping into the
peritoneal cavity. Its coats were soft and thin, breaking easily with
slight force. That part of the stomach which was in contact with
the liver, was deeply coloured with bile. The ductus communis
choledicus (the common gall duct) was compressed and closed. The
other organs of the body (with the exception of slight cerebral con-
gestion) were healthy, and there was no trace of peritoneal inflamma-
tion. The history of the case was as follows ; The child had been
born at the full time in the Lying-in-Hospital. Her mother was an
extremely intemperate woman, and as soon as she was discharged
from the Hospital, commenced drinking excessively. Four days
prior to the child’s death she had ceased to suckle it, and a neigh-
bour having undertaken to attend to it, gave it maizena and sago.
The child was excessively sick, and appeared to suffer pain ; the diet,
however, was continued, and a dose of castor oil was administered.
Death occurred suddenly, while the child was being placed on its
mother’s lap, and was stated to have been the immediate result of a
convulsive seizure.
“ Dr. Fetherston remarked that this was an extremely instructive
example of the lamentable results of the improper feeding of infants.
It was additionally interesting from the circumstance that the succes-
sion of the morbid influences could be distinctly traced. The exces-
sive quantity of alcohol taken into the system of the mother, and
transmitted in part through the breast into that of the child, had
manifestly caused the softening of the coats of the stomach, which
was therefore not only less capable of performing its proper functions
than it would have been in a normal state, but as the result showed
was rendered more liable to laceration from distention. There was
reason to believe, too, that gin or whiskey had been given directly as
a soporific. The condition of the liver was obviously caused by pres-
sure of the constantly distended stomach upon the gall-duct, the pro-
per elimination of its secretion having been arrested, and the jaundice
and biliary infiltration having followed as a matter of course.
“ The powers of the system being weakened by the large amount
of bile in the circulation, would probably account for death having
been the consequence of collapse, rather than of peritoneal inflamma-
tion.


“ It was much to be regretted that so much ignorance prevailed with
reference to the proper diet of infants. The object seemed to be to
gorge them without stint, with coarse indigestible matter, instead
of simply giving them cow’s milk, as the most rational substitute fur
the natural maternal aliment, and he believed this was only one of
many other cases in which death occurred, though perhaps not with
the same suddenness, from similar causes.”
On the Causes of the Excessive Infant Mortality. By Charles
McCarthy, M.D., L.F.P.S.G.
[Read before the Medical Society of Victoria, February 8, 1865.]
Mr. President and Gentlemen, —When I had the honour of
reading a paper on Infant Mortality before this Society last No-
vember, I intimated my intention to consider the causes of this
great mortality, and to refer to the statistics of the other Australian
colonies, I had not then seen the Queensland statistics, but on
subsequently perusing them I found a remarkable coincidence be-
tween my views, expressed in that essay, and the views of the
Registrar General of Queensland, Mr. Darvall. After calling atten-
tion to the unusually large mortality, particularly among children,
he says :
“ There is no doubt that many causes operate to produce this
large mortality, and that if the towns suffer, as I have no doubt
they do, from bad drainage, and from the decomposition of animal
and vegetable matter permitted to accumulate in them, the country
suffers fully as much from the prevalence of diseases peculiar to
newly-occupied and undrained districts ; and, in addition, from the
difficulty of obtaining medical assistance. However this may be,
it is certain that the mortality of the last four years exceeds the
average mortality of England \ and although the actual difference,
as shown by figures, is not great, we must not forget the very dif-
ferent position of the two countries as regards pauperism, and all
its attendant miseries of destitution, starvation, filthy, crowded, and
unwholesome dwellings, and consequent disease. If a fair deduc-
tion could be made from the deaths arising from this cause, happily
almost unknown in Queensland, it would make the difference in
the mortality of the two countries far greater.” He goes on to
sa y : “ Taking into consideration the salubrious climate of
Queensland, the small number of aged persons, the abundance of
wholesome food, the immunity from pauperism, the absence of large
overcrowded towns, ana of nearly all occupations injurious to health,
it seems clear that our rate of mortality is far greater than it should
be : we find that out of 1275 deaths only 5 died of old age, and
that the large proportion of 1270 died prematurely, or from causes
remediable to a greater or less extent.
“ Let us suppose that we possess the means and the knowledge, if
we employed them, of diminishing the above mortality by one-half,
here is at once a saving of 600 valuable lives in a single year. If it be
believed that this estimate of our powers of prevention or cure be too
great, although it would only restore the mortality of the colony to


its ratio of former years, we will, for the sake of argument, be
content with reducing the number of lives saved to 300, or even to
100. Even at this last minimum rate, how much suffering would
our small community be spared ! How many parents would not be
childless ! How many wives or children would still be supported
by the labours of their natural protectors, instead of being thrown
on the charity of relatives, or left as burdens on the public ! And,
lastly, how serious is the responsibility of the community, which
shuts its eyes and neglects to employ the remedial powers within its
reach ! If any accident involving loss of life occurs, what searching
inquiries are made ! —what public indignation is expressed, and even
punishments inflicted, if negligence or carelessness can be shown to
have occasioned it! And yet, each week sees quietly withdrawn
from our community a certain number, many of whose lives might
probably, by ordinary care and attention, be lengthened for years ;
and this quiet stream of death is permitted to flow on, unchecked,
almost unnoticed, until in a few months it has swept away far more
numerous victims than are sacrificed in the most frightful accidents
on land or sea.”
How applicable to Victoria is the greater part of these remarks !
He then shows that in three unions of London, in 1859, the average
ages at death were 2326, 27'48, and 29 - 60 years; while at Brisbane
it was only 13’01 years. And in two county unions of England,
namely, Wilts (an agricultural county), and the mining district of
Kendal, the average ages at death were 35 - 20 and 36 09 years. In
the country districts of Queensland it was only 18 90, and in the
whole colony 16 53 years!
In the following table, from Mr. Darvall, I will give the causes of
death in the order of the mortality for 1863, by which it will
be readily seen that children under five years make up the vast
majority :

From the above it will be seen that the most fatal diseases in
Queensland, with the exception of heart disease, dropsy, and acci-
dents, mark for their victims children under five years of age.
I shall give one other table from Mr. Darvall’s excellent report,
namely, the per centage of deaths under one year and five years,
compared to the total deaths :

From this we see that the per centage of deaths under one year and

From this we see that the per centage of deaths under one year and
five years, compared to the total deaths, is much higher in Queens-
land than in England, but higher in Victoria than in either, and far
too high in all, as stated in my former paper.
Having said thus much about Queensland, I now come to the
special object of this paper. I stated in my former essay that I
attributed the great mortality to the four principal causes enumerated
above. Twelve years’ experience of Melbourne practice has impressed
my mind with the conviction that the greatest cause of mortality is
improper feeding.
I have constructed Table No. 14, showing the mortality of
children under one year and five years, from the principal diseases
or causes of mortality in Victoria, and in Melbourne and suburbs,
in 1862, and in 1863 ; by which we find that five diseases constitute
one-half , and thirty diseases the greater part of the mortality in both
years. This table is of great importance ; for the most fatal of the
diseases standing at the top of this table originate in improper food.
This is the question of questions, upon which hangs life or death.
Thus, every medical man by daily experience knows, that the most
frequent cause of the following nineteen diseases, marked in the table
1,2, 3,4, 5,9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27,
will be found in improper diet ; nay, in many other diseases enumer-
ated in Table 14, improper diet will be found an indirect cause.
The disease marked 30 (sunstroke), I note for a negative purpose, to
show that too much stress is laid upon the sun’s influence. I intro-
duce 17, 28, 29—Suffocation, Burns, and Drowning—to prove what
I shall assert in the sequel, namely, that children in this colony are
too much neglected by their parents.

It is to the above nineteen -diseases that I desire to draw special
attention, as constituting three-fourths of all the causes of death in
the colony, and in Melbourne; thus the aggregate of these nineteen
amount to 2,551 under one year, and 3,806 under five years, in the

this would account for near 40 per cent, of all the deaths under 1 '
and 5 in the colony and in Melbourne.
I have thus designedly placed in the foreground public statistics,
in order to prevent my own convictions occupying the foundation of
my super-structure, so to speak. As this essay is entirely intended
for practical purposes, I shall now turn to the result of my own
experience, and state that previous to the cholera of 1848, I almost
invariably commenced the treatment of many of the diseases, noted
in Table 14, especially convulsions, diarrhoea, &c., with emetics, with
the best effect, so thoroughly convinced was I that irritation of the
stomach and bowels, caused by improper food, was the origin of the
mischief; every year’s experience since that time has confirmed me in
the correctness of that view, and I can now state that these remarks
apply far more to this colony than to Scotland, where I then
practised.
As stated in my former paper this great mortality commences
almost from birth, in other words the pitfalls and trap-doors in the
vision of Mirza, are presented to the infant from the moment of its
birth, and by none with more fatal effect than by mothers, and by
those women who have neither sense nor conscience. lam quite cer-
tain that the general public have not the faintest idea of the number
of children consigned to an early grave, by the unaccountable conduct
eases


of a large portion of our would-be female benefactors, who go about
destroying, (I would say murdering, but for the absence of malice),
their neighbours’ children. I believe that we shall not know till the
day of general judgment the amount of crime committed in this way,
and which actions are now set down for good works; I will even go
farther and deliberately state, that in my opinion a fearful responsi-
bility lies upon each medical man who neglects to reprimand these
busy bodies, and to warn ignorant confiding mothers against their
mischief. The first error I have to observe, is that of giving infants
a few hours old indigestible substances, but I do not agree with Dr.
Ellis and some others, who deny the necessity of giving children any
food till the mother can suckle it. Many mothers will scarcely have
any milk till the third or fourth day, very few for twenty-four hours,
and applying the child early will have no better effect in many cases
than the production of sore nipples. In my opinion the child ought
not to be put to the breast sooner than twelve or twenty-four hours
after birth, unless the milk be unmistakably present, which seldom is
the case; of course a child ought not to be fasting for twelve or
twenty-four hours, but nothing ought to be given but a little fresh
milk diluted with boiled water and a little refined sugar, every two
or three hours, if awake ; there is no necessity of awaking the baby
to feed it, hunger will do that, and an experienced mother will soon
distinguish between the cry of hunger, the cry of temper, and the
cry of pain
Adulterated milk is a frequent cause of the death of young chil-
dren. I have this week seen a baby who vomited every drop of
adulterated milk it took during twenty-four hours after its birth ;
but, on getting pure milk, the vomiting instantly ceased. Every
effort should be made to procure pure milk for children, and those
who adulterate it should be severely punished. The present police
crusade against goats in the suburbs is unwise, and the attention of
the authorities should rather be directed to dairies ; for it is well
known that, if cows get unwholesome fodder, in foul houses, and be
allowed to lie on filth, the milk will be poisonous to children.
The next error of vast importance and of frequent occurrence,
is putting the child too often to the breast; the reason is often
selfishness in the mother, merely to quiet the child when she knows
that it is not hungry; the result is vomiting, or purging, or skin
disease, with thirst which is taken for hunger. This is the greatest
cause of mortality within the first month ; for very few commit so
great an error as to spoon feed in the first month; however, the
medical man need not be surprised, for I have known even half-and-
half, gin, &c., to be given to babies a few hours old, and every medi-
cal man of much experience in diseases of children knows, that
mothers and nurses conceal from him what has been given ; and I
frequently find that it is after the third or fourth time that I put the
question, that I get an honest answer, which is generally given by the
father if present.
I think that every.third hour is abundantly sufficient for any child
to be applied to the breast, and not so often if the child sleep.


Generally speaking, I think the child ought to be allowed to fill its
stomach when at the breast, short of vomiting ; but, of course, not
reapplied for hours.
The next error which I observe, is the habit of laying the infant
on the mother’s knee, face downwards. This (she observes) fre-
quently stops its crying, from the fact that it compresses the child’s
flatulent abdomen, and perhaps disgorges its too full stomach.
There is also a bad habit of rocking the child backwards and for-
wards, with the hand pressed firmly against its stomach. The next
point is one of very serious import, that of spoon feeding. As a
general rule, this ought to be deferred as long as the mother’s health
will permit, and the supply of milk is ordinarily abundant.
The period of commencing spoon feeding, or rather bottle feeding,
is almost as important as the time of weaning. The common habit
is to lay the child on its back, and fill its stomach : this even an
adult cannot bear. In ordinary cases, with healthy mothers, the
nearer the child approaches seven months totally dependent on its
mother’s milk the better ; that is to say, the observance of this rale
would vastly lessen the mortality of infants. Ido not wish to be un-
derstood to say that every mother who gives a little food, besides her
breast milk, to a child after the third or fourth month, does wrong ;
but that it is, in general, dangerous to do so; and that anything
beyond fresh cow’s or goat’s milk ought not to be given, generally
speaking, till after nine months. Nay, 1 deliberately assert, that, if
children were entirely confined to milk, or milk diet, till the com-
pletion of two years, it would save 30 per cent, of those who are
daily consigned to the grave. Of course, this is not to be understood
to mean that I recommend this course, but only of two evils to
choose the less.
I disapprove of flesh meat being given before the age of eighteen
months, unless in the form of chicken tea, beef tea, or jelly. A
fertile source of diarrhoea and convulsions is the bad custom of
allowing children under three years of age to sit at the dinner-table.
Persons in Europe would scarcely believe that Melbourne parents
give their young children such dinners as I observe them to take,
viz., pork, green cabbage, rich soups, and broth and potatoes, and
even ale and porter. Fruit pies, puddings and tarts, are given
ad libitum. In fact, the common answer to your inquiries is, “We
give them whatever is going.”
Another principal cause of the great mortality of children is the
unrestricted use of fruit; that is, without regard to its quality or
quantity; allowing them to eat every part of it, skin, core, seeds,
(Sec., green, unripe, or spoiled. I am decidedly of opinion, from
observation, that fruit is more apt to disagree with the stomach here
than in the cold countries of Europe. In fact, the whole human
machine is “ alive,” so to speak, to every kind of impression.
Another very fatal cause is the attributing to the “teeth” diarrhoea
brought on by improper food. But 1 shall return to this when
speaking of want of early medical attendance. Another great error
is the habit of feeding children out of their regular meal times,


and enticing them to do so by spreading butter, sugar, treacle, or
jam on their bread, and actually awaking them from sleep to feed
them. Again, as to weaning, it occurs too suddenly. Children
invariably get too much food, and of too rich a description. This is
the great epoch of the five scourges of infancy, standing at the top
of Table 14., viz., Atrophy, Diarrhoea, Convulsions, Dysentery,
and Teething, These five make up half the whole mortality of
children, as shown by Table 15.
Neither time nor space will permit me to dwell longer on this the
most fatal cause of infant mortality. I must therefore conclude this
part by asserting, that children are not fed as plainly or as poorly as
they ought to be, and that the comfort and affluence of parents prove
the destruction of their offspring by feeding them too highly ; and,
finally, that all the endeavours of medical men to save the children
of this colony will be in vain until parents cease to cram their
children’s stomachs.
The second cause of mortality of infants is improper clothing ; or,
setting at defiance the climate and the seasons. Here, again, I must
begin at birth, and try to account for Quetelet’s statement, that one-
tenth of all children born die within the first month !
The first fault I observe, is, that of delaying the dressing of the
infant after birth. The second is the almost invariable habit of
compressing the child with tight bandages, so as to appear like a
tight bundle, making it almost impossible for a child to respire by
either chest or abdomen. I recently saw a double rupture in a child,
within the first fortnight from this cause. Next comes the cruel
habit of “ short-dress ” —short above as well as short below—this
has to do with diseases, Isos. 8, 10, 21, viz., Pneumonia, Bron-
chitis, Croup, and other diseases. There is one feature commendable,
however, in their dresses, which I heartily wish their mothers would
imitate, namely, that of supporting the whole of their inner clothing
with shoulder straps. The adoption of this practice would do away
with the excuse for the evil of stays, and all their consequences of
indigestion, palpitation, consumption, liver and bowel complaints,
piles, and miscarriages. ■ I cannot conclude this part without entering
my protest against what I conceive to be the ugliest form of dress
ever imported into this colony, I mean the “ knickerbocker.” If
fathers would but try them on themselves but for one day, while the
south wind from the Bay chilled them, I doubt not but that would
be sufficient'to stop this ugly mischievous fashion.
But it is said that children ought to be “ hardened.” One says,
see how healthy Mr. A.’s children are ; but he forgets that Mr. B.’s
children were lost by the experiment. I may say that the hardening
system is as old as Mr. Locke, who recommended children to wear
thin shoes, that the damp may penetrate, and so harden the child !
I do not advise overwhelming the child with clothing, but I certainly
recommend the body to be protected by light warm clothing, espe-
cially by inner flannels, to guard against the changes of temperature.
Leaving off flannels for a time is a dangerous practice.
We now come to 'the third cause, viz, Impure Air. Under this


head I shall note small crowded houses and sleeping apartments, the
practice of burying a child under bed-clothes, and the neglect of
cleanliness as well of the child and its clothes as of the dwelling
and its neighbourhood. This latter evil, on account of its subtlety,
is as imperceptible as a child’s growth, but as certain. The health
of a child is a much more delicate test of the impure state of the air
than the test of a chemist, but is rather two serious a one. I may
be allowed to observe, that the destructive influence of the im-
pure air of Melbourne and Collingwood, is not by any means con-
fined to children; I have found the most remarkable effects from the
removal of patients to the country even for a few days. I have made
very extensive inquiry into this question of the insalubrity of dwell-
ings in Melbourne and Collingwood, and the result was the discovery
of an amount of ill-health and air-poisoning for which I was quite
unprepared; families having constant medical attendance and large
mortality until they changed or drained their premises.
But how could it be otherwise when we find that very few water-
closets between Queen-street and Russell-street can be completely
emptied, the water instantly rushing in from the adjoining premises ;
in fact the whole of Melbourne is thoroughly saturated with the Yan
Yean and the contents of the water-closets, so that there is a constant
percolation going on, and an impure evaporation poisoning the atmo-
sphere ; the stench occasioned by the contents of cellars being poured
into the channels after midnight is excessively sickening. These
cellars are centres of contagion, and suffice to destroy the health of
the inmates, and if cholera visit Melbourne, it will assuredly attack
those who inhabit such houses. Children have no chance in such
places when the door and windows are shut at night.
The last cause of mortality to which I desire to call attention, is
want of early or of sufficient medical attendance, the consequences of
which are so obvious that they need not be detailed. It is a great
puzzle to me how the directions of old ignorant women, or of the
servant of some doctor, are scrupulouly followed, and the doctor’s
directions disregarded ; there may be something in the fact that the
one is less expensive than the other.
I cannot say what Dr. Ellis says of some parents in London, that
they consider it a positive relief to lose some of their children, but I
cannot account for the unaccountable omission, to give it no harsher
name, of many parents, in neglecting to send for medical assistance.
It is not always nor often that poverty can be alleged as an excuse ;
nay, many refuse to follow the medical man’s directions without the
least scruple of conscience, aye, and boast of having done so. Shall
we call it ignorance 1 Whatever it is, it is principally encouraged
by old women, by impostors, and quacks ; it is a matter above all
others calculated to try the temper of a medical man, and if he be a
batchelor, he is from this cause alone almost tempted to remain so. It
is true that the law requires a medical certificate of the cause of
death, but this does not cure the evil of neglect, the medical man in
many instances being sent for at the last moment to grant a certifi-
cate. It appeared lately, at a coroner’s inquest, that I was hurriedly


sent for some hours after the deatli of a baby to grant a certificate,
when an attempt was made to impose on me, under the impression
that the child was still in convulsions, after another medical man had
hours before pronounced it dead.
There is one evil in connection with this subject which I must
not neglect to notice, namely, the attributing of many complaints to
teething, especially diarrhoea, vomiting, and cholera. This terrible
prejudice destroys a large per centage of children. Thus, a diarrhoea
is allowed to continue unchecked for a week or a fortnight, then
vomiting occurs, or in other words cholera, and in a day or two after
the doctor is sent for, when the sunken eyes of the baby reveal the
whole history without a question being asked. Such mothers almost
invariably say that they thought it was the teeth —that some expe-
rienced person said, “ The purging ought not to be stopped.” This
and the refusal to allow the medical man to scarify the gums, are the
most general evidence of the most inveterate ignorance that the
medical man meets with; and next to improper feeding, the most
frequent cause of death. I have not seen three instances in twenty
years in which stopping purging early was detrimental.
Nor must I omit to notice another grievous’ cause of mischief,
namely, patent medicines, the existence of which is a disgrace to any
government. It is surprising to what an extent people will submit
to be humbugged in respect of these matters ; the public credulity is
astonishing ; hence all the new plans of imposition. I have thus
called attention to what I have met in daily practice during the last
twenty years; I have exaggerated nothing; but I have faithfully given
the result of my observations, and I shall be amply rewarded, if my
remarks should reach those whom they specially concern, and the
utmost of my desire would be attained if any remarks of mine would
have the effect of inducing my medical brethren to use their utmost
endeavours to remove the ignorance and prejudice to which I have
called attention, for what but the deepest ignorance and mismanage-
ment could cause such a sad state of things as is exhibited by the
. New Cemetery up to December last, 12,809 under one year, 16,320
under two years, 18,867 under five years, out of a total of 33,443
interments, from 1853 to December 31st, 1864; that is 56 per cent,
of the entire were of those under five years of age ; even from July
last to December there were buried in this “ Rama,” 432 under one
year, 515 under two years, 638 under five years, out of a total of
1,198 interments, or 53 percent, even in the healthy half year. This
is a sad testimony against ignorance and misguided affection; experi-
ence and common sense prove that this state of things is not inevit-
able ; you are well aware that a worse state of matters has been'
remedied by the interference and instrumentality of the medical
profession ; witness the reformation of foundling hospitals, the sani-
tary improvements of towns, and the various questions suggested by
vital statistics. I have blamed mothers, but I cannot free fathers from
blame as long as they permit children under three years of age to
sit with them at tho dinner table, I appeal to the experience of every
medical man in respect of what he observes daily in almost every


family, children eating all day, mothers cramming their children’s
stomachs with an ingenuity and industry worthy of a better cause ;
trying to discover how much their children could bear before arriving
at the stage of convulsions, dysentery, diarrhoea, vomit'ing, or sk n
disease, for one or other, and not rarely all these diseases combined
are present as a reward for, and a testimony to the parents’folly.
I trust that mothers will bear with me if I take the liberty of find-
ing fault with them for the last time; I do so for the welfare of those
whom they tenderly love ; I find more difficulty in expressing pro-
perly the caution I am about to give than anything connected with
my subject, inasmuch as ray motive may be questioned, but if my
speaking plainly may be the cause of saving one child to its mother,
it will outweigh any other consideration.
I allude to the evil caused by mothers and friends of sick children,
in receiving the anxious, scrupulous, and careful painstaking examina-
tion of their medical attendant, as a sign of inability or ignorance of the
case, and prefer the opinion of a medical man who pretends to see
and understand the case even before he touches the patient. Tnis
feeling does incalculable mischief, by, in a manner, compelling a
medical man as a matter of policy to pretend that he also can under-
stand the disease without much examination. Hear what Hr.
Marshall Hall, one of the most acute physicians of the present
century, says on this subject, in a small work called Eicpcedia , or
Letters to a Mother on the Watchful Care of her Infant.
He says : “ Choose such a physician as wfill listen to you —as will
think no communication from you unimportant. Instead of treating a
parent’s observations with supercilious contempt, the physician’s very
first question ought to be, ‘ What has occurred ? What have you
observed 1 ’ There is no royal road to the detection and distinction
of diseases Physicians th emselves, if they pretend to extraordinary
and intuitive knowledge of diseases, only deceive themselves and others,
and at best only half understand the case, if it be a little compli-
cated. Lord Eldon ‘doubted’ more than any man; be assured
that it would be better for their patients if some physicians followed ♦
his lordship’s example. An off-hand decision penetrates no deeper
than the surface. I am often surprised that intelligent parents should
be satisfied with such superficial, such careless inspection ot their
little infants.” I will mention only one disease which fully justifies
the above remarks, namely, the hydrencephalus of Gooch anc
Marshal Hall, as a specimen of that class, where a wrong or careless
diagnosis results in certain death, mistaking debility for disease of the
brain, or, what is more common, mistaking an oppressed stomach tor
inflammation of the brain.

In conclusion, I must state, that in these two essays I have freely,
perhaps too freely, given expression to convictions long formed in
my mind, the result of experience; and my apology for the earnest-
ness and freedom with which I have written, is, the ardour of a man
who is anxious to save life, and who addresses those who, he is
persuaded, can directly and indirectly save thousands of lives. I
have carefully avoided theories or modern philosophical views.
I have confined myself to facts of practical application, and about
which there can be no doubt, I have proved the awful mortality,
and I have shown its causes—l mean preventible causes. I have not
noticed that fearful cause noticed in the public press, namely, deaths
of children caused by drunken mothers overlaying them. (See Table
XIY., No, 17.) v
I must apologise for any repetitions or want of order, as I have,
amidst the hurry of business, written different portions at different
|; imes - was after the greater part was written that I got from my
f i lend Mr. Hay ter unpublished statistics specially prepared for me,
and which Mr. Archer allowed me to copy. My views were not
taken from the statistics, but the statistics confirmed my views.
These statistics are of great importance. I have marked them
under Tiible XVI., and as there is nothing like it published, I shall
give it in extenso. It points out the causes of death of all under
one year and under five years, in Melbourne and in the Colony, for
1802 and 1863, distinguishing male and female.
It bears out the statement made in my former paper from Quetelet
that there is a particular cause of mortality which attacks male chil-
dren, by preference, before and immediately after their birth. From
Table XVI. I have constructed Table XIV., which shows the prin-
cipal diseases that carry off infants, especially the diseases standing
at the top of that table. °
In conclusion ; as I have not undertaken to call attention to what
ought to be done, but to what ought to be avoided, I shall defer to a
uture occasion a third paper on the proper management of children.
As to the points alluded to in these papers, I am thoroughly con-
vinced that, if parents seriously consider the warnings I have given,
and not be offended by the style in which I have written, but accept


V
my liberty as the effusion of one who has observed for years the seeds
of death sown in the fairest soil of creation, and who. now, for the
first time, proclaims publicly what he has for years endeavoured in
his private practice to inculcate, that thousands of lives will be
saved, and parents saved the greatest privation on earth the loss
of their children.
WILSON AND MACKINNON, PRINTERS, COLLINS STREET EAST.


ON THE EXCESSIVE MORTALITY OF INFANTS
Read before the Medical Association of Victoria,
November 11th, 1870,
Br thk President, CHARLES McCAETHY, M.D., L.F.P.S.G.
About six years ago I read, before the Medical Society,
two papers on the excessive mortality of infants. These
papers, which were published, contain 17 statistical tables,
intended to prove the statements I made, and the views I
entertained, as to the causes of this mortality. I ma} r here
state that my opinions, as then expressed, have not since
altered in the slightest degree.
In the present paper, I have brought down the statistics
of the Melbourne General Cemetery from its opening, in
June, 1853, to June 30th, 1870, in four tables.
In this paper I shall confine myself to reflections arising
from these tables, and leave others to draw their own con-
clusions. It will be seen from the tables that the inter-
ments at all ages amount to 62,794 and that 19,798 of
that number were under one year, 25,452 under two years,
29,674 under five years, and 30,467 were under ten years !
—that is, that out of every hundred interments, were
under one year, 48 under two years, 66 under five years,
and nearly 60 under ten years, and this in one of the finest
climates in the world, and in the absence of poverty and
privation.
Could any person have imagined that more than half the
interments were of children who died before arriving at the
use of reason, and that only ten out of every 100 arrived at
the age of 60 ? But I shall confine my remarks to the case
of children, and I desire to make it known to the vast crowds
who visit the cemetery that more than one-half of those who
sleep in that sacred receptacle of the dead were under five
years of age, and that nearly one-half were under two years.
These reflections, though melancholy, are calculated to do
good. It is hard to believe that the Author of Nature in-
tended that 60 per cent of the human race should die before
arriving at the years of discretion. The causes of this
mortality I have stated in my former papers. I there also
called attention to the fatality in the summer months, and
beg now to remark that parents require then to be doubly


vigilant, seeing that 38 per cent, of the children dying under
two years die in the months of December, January, and
February, and, in my opinion, of curable and preventable
diseases. Medical men are always expected to give a sincere
and candid opinion, and it is for those whom it may con-
cern to profit by it. It rarely happens that ignorance
benefits individuals, families, or the general community;
certainly, in this matter, ignorance is not bliss, nor is it
folly to be wise. I have, in this paper, absolutely confined
myself to facts, and if any person should reply that other
cemeteries show the same percentage of infantile mortality,
I answer it ought not to be, nor am I aware that, in any
other cemetery in the world, does such a state of things
exist. It is, however, proper to remark that stillborn inter-
ments are included, amounting on an average to 200 per
annum.
Having, in my former papers, compared the death rate
here with that in England and Queensland, in respect of
the population, I have not entered on that subject in the
present paper, my object being to show the enormous loss
of children. I am convinced that the deaths are double
what they need be in this colony, and that the fault is not
in the climate, but in what I before pointed out.
Mr. Darvall, Registrar-General of Queensland, says, in
his Report of 1863 (see page 14), that the mortality of
Queensland is higher than that of England, and twice as
high as in former years; and believes that one-half the
deaths need not occur. I thoroughly agree with him, and
repeat that the fault is not in the climate, but in the four
following circumstances {see page 9): —
Ist. Improper diet, as to quantity and quality. As to
quantity, the children are perpetually eating; and, when
one year old, usually sit at the same table with their parents,
and partake of the same food and drink. As to unripe fruit,
there is no limit.
2nd. Unsuitable clothing, without regard to climate,
season, or changes in the weather.
3rd. Impure air, from bad ventilation, and absence of
drainage.
4th. A lamentable neglect of early or sufficient medical
attendance.
It will be observed that I do not notice poverty as a
cause; this has little to do with Victorian mortality,
unless in those instances of drunken mothers who in
various ways cut short the lives of their infants.
