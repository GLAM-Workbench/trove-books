This Society is
established on the tried and approved principle of Mutual Assurance.
The Funds are accumulated, under the immediate superintendance and control of the
policy-holders, for their exclusive benefit.
The profits are divided annually, and
applied
in reduction of future premiums.
At the Annual
General
Meeting, held on
the 9 th instant, an elaborate and highly
satisfactory report of the state of the Society?s affairs was submitted to the Members ;
whereupon it was
resolved
unanimously that
an allowance of 30 per cent, should be
made on the premiums payable on all policies on the participating scale, on which five
or more
yearly premiums had been previously made.
Credit is allowed for half the annual premium for the first five years.

FOR the INDIAN CLIMATE & the SUMMER SEASON.
Pears' famine transparent ~oap,
RECOMMENDED BY THE FACULTY.
THE MOST PERFECT CLEANSER AND EMOLIENT FOR THE SKIN.
iE S t a b H u r g .
I. filler the distinguished patronage of the Royal Family and Nohility,
T Hf. whole surface ot the body requiring the frequent application of Soap, it is most
important to secure that article tree trom deleterious matters, especially when required
tor the infant and the invalid. Soaps are generally selected on account of their
odoriferous qualities, irrespective of their purifying and soothing properties, and
consequently much mischief often arises without the real cause beino - suspected. The
odoriferous quality being most desirable, Mr. PEARS has the highest satisfaction in
announcing that he has succeeded in incorporating in his TRANSPARENT SOAP,
A most exquisite and durable Odour.
The surface of the skin ot persons of delicate constitution being the most subject to
injury from intense heat, severe cold, inclement winds, and other vicissitudes of the
weather peculiar to this climate, it is with unaffected satisfaction that the Proprietors
assure them that this preparation is quite free from irritating or acrimonious particles,
and may therefore be applied to the most tender skin with the happiest success ; indeed
infants of the weakest frame and earliest age may receive the application with the
greatest benefit; in which cases most of the leading Medical Men of the age have
recommended it.
I he great excellence of this Soap likewise is, that it may be used with equal pleasure
in hard or soft water, a circumstance which renders it extremely agreeable to
gentlemen of the navy, families travelling, or ladies, and families going to INDIA,
in a word, it is calculated for the ease, comfort, and satisfaction of every description of
persons, change of air or climate never in the least diminishing the invaluable pro-
perties it possesses, and which it retains for years and years; and it will be found the
most durable soap
M FOR ABLUTIONS OF THE BATH.
Sold in Square Cakes, price Is. and Is. fid. ; and large Squares perfumed with Otto
of Roses, price 2s. fid. each ; also Wash-balls, price 2s. fid. ; and non-angular Tablets,
price 2s. fid.
FOR SHAVING.
Gentlemen will find this Soap much superior to the Naples, or any cream or Soap
that is offered to the public, and far more pleasant and cleanly to use. Those persons
troubled with tender taces will find this a most desirable Soap, for it not only produces
a fine creamy lather that will not dry on the face, but leaves it comfortable and cool
after shaving.
Sold in Round Cakes, suitable for the shaving dish, price Is., Is. fid., and 2s. fid.
each. This is a most desirable article for Naval or Military Gentlemen, as it can
be used equally well wfith hot or cold water, and produces an instantaneous unctious and
consistent lather.
Pears?s Shaving Stick
saves much time and trouble to the shaver. ? It produces with hot or cold water, an in-
stantaneous, unctious, and consistent lather, which softens the beard, and thereby
renders the process of shaving more rapid, easy, and cleanly than the old mode of using
the brush and dish. PEARS?S SHAVING STICK is formed from his Transparent
Soap; its firm consistence makes it more durable than any other Soap. Prices of
Shaving Sticks in cases, I*. & Is. fid. each ; by post, 4d. extra. Larger Sticks, 2s. fid. each.
As a caution to the public Mr. Pears intimates, that wheresoever or by whomsoever
sold, it can never be genuine without the Inventor?s signature, A. PEARS, in his hand-
writing. To be had of most respectable Chemists and Perfumers.
Forwarded to all parts of the World, wholesale and retail, on the receipt of an order
made payable to Francis Pears.

as a valuable remedy for the removal of a multitude of com-
| plaints that appear to yield to nothing else. It has been for
many years prescribed by the most eminent of the Faculty as a
_i - restorative for impurity of the Blood, affections of the Liver,
Indigestion, Scorbutic and most Cutaneous Diseases, Chronic
Rheumatism, Loss of Flesh, and Constitutional Debility,

The following are a few of the numerous Testimonials in favour of Bridge?s Preparation :
? We have great pleasure in recommending Bridge?s Preparation to any persons
? who require a course ot Sarsaparilla.? ? Medical Review.
? A superior preparation that may always be relied on.? ? Sir Astley Cooper.
? We are
in every respect, satisfied with it.? ? Lancet.
? Bridge?s Sarsaparilla offers greater advantages to the consumer than any other
? Preparation, and
in consequence of its high state of concentration, it is unimpaired
? by age or climate. It will be found invaluable to those who have resided, or are
? about to reside, in tropical climates.? ? Morning Chronicle.
? Gentlemen, ?
Having had during the performance of my military medical duty,
t of Spain and the north coast of Africa, several opportunities of
? on the south coas
witnessing the beneficial effects arising from the use of Sarsaparilla in cases of
? Debility, Dispepsta, Attenuation of Body, and Nervousness, I very naturally formed
? a favourable opinion of the root. I have for many years devoted my professional
? attention
to cases ot Stammering and nervous Impediments of Speech, which in
general are accompanied with similar symptoms, blended with despondency and, in
? some instances, with hypochondriaism; and as Sir Astley Cooper recommended
? your Fluid Extract ? as a superior Preparation? of the root, together with the other
? ingredients ordered by the London College of Physicians, I have constantly recom-
? mended and invariably found your Preparation a powerful adjunct to my other treat-
? ment of those affections.
? Latterly, in consequence of much debility, &c., subsequent to Cholera, 1 have
? freely used your Preparation myself, with complete benefit and success.

THE OVERLAND MAIL TO INDIA.
THE ROUTE TO INDIA, via the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, was formerly accomplished under
great difficulties, attended by many serious delays. The trip to Alexandria could only be made in small, slow-
sailing merchant ships; the journey thence to Suez (or Cossier) was accomplished on donkeys or camels,
and the traveller was entirely dependent upon chance for a passage down the Red Sea to India. Many
attempts were made between 1823 and 1840, at the instance of the late Lieut. Waghorn, to establish a regular
line of communication, but nothing could be accomplished until the Peninsular Company (thenceforward ? The
Peninsular and Oriental Company?) took the matter in hand, at the earnest instigation of the late Lord
William Bentick and Captain James Barber, the East India Agent. The prospect of advantage from the
enterprise was not at first inviting. It was computed that at least nine vessels were requisite, ?the largest
of them of 600 tons burthen; ?that probably ten passengers would proceed by each opportunity, and that
a few boxes and bags would be found capable of holding all the correspondence between India and the mother
country. The cost of the nine vessels was estimated at Ik 200,000; the annual expense of their equipment,
fuel, &c., at �.123,000, while the returns could not amount to more than �.75,000. Yet, in the face of this
discouraging estimate (prepared for another Company which never came to maturity) the undertaking was
commenced, and so popular has the route become from the regularity, facility, and comparative economy
with which it is accomplished, that the Peninsular and Oriental Company is now one of the most
prosperous in Europe. It has twenty-three vessels, thirteen of which average 1800 tons burthen, and
500 horse power;?not less than one hundred ladies and gentlemen are accommodated on each voyage as
passengers ?while the mails consist of 200 boxes and bags, weighing about four tons. The public
advantages of the enterprise are unspeakable. Geographical distance has been annihilated?the time
occupied in the communication between England and India has been shortened by nearly three months,
the commercial relations of the two empires have been immensely multiplied, and the cause of good
government materially promoted.
We now proceed to offer a brief description of the various places that may be seen, or touched at, on
the voyage out, and of which representations are given in the Diorama. The first view is of


SOUTHAMPTON.
The Steamers for Alexandria, with the passengers to India, quit Southampton on the 20th of every
month. Each steamer averages 1600 tons burthen, with engines of 500 horse power. They are admirably
found in all respects, carry out from one hundred to one hundred and thirty passengers, and about tw
hundred bags of letters. Steaming down Southampton Water, a view is obtained of Calshot Castle, which
was built, in the reign of Henry the Eighth, of stone taken from Netley Abbey, and is now used as a
preventive station.






ISLE OF WIGHT.
Soon afterwards Cowes is seen, with the little fleet of yachts belonging to the Royal Yacht Squadron.
Perhaps there 1S not a spot in all England so calculated, by the simple beauty of its scenery, to convey
favourable and lasting impressions of the loveliness of our native country. No person exiling himself from
England, but must wish to return on recalling the charming scenery of the Isle of Wight.
OSBORNE.
Osborne-the residence of Her Majesty in the Isle of Wight-is one of the most prominent objects on
the Island. An excellent view of it is obtained, on a clear day, from the deck of the outward bound
steamer.


THE NEEDLES.
These rocks, originally five in number, constitute the last spot on the British shores vistble from - the
outward bound steamer. Only four of the Needles are now seen high above the water, and these are not of
great altitude; not one of them now bears the remotest resemblance to the implement of housewifery from
which they may have derived their title. The sea has done its work in altering the form and reducing the
dimensions of these singular rocks, which originally may have constituted the point of the Is e o ig it.






THE BAY OF BISCAY.
The skirts only of this Bay, so celebrated in Byron?s poetry for its ? sleepless? character, are
passed on the outward trip. The shores of the Bay are extremely uninviting, being of a rocky and
sandy character, with a hack-ground of rude unpicturesque hills.
THE BURLINGS, or BERLINGAS.
A small cluster of rocks on the Portuguese coast. They form a striking feature of the Landscape.
In their vicinity we fall in with a variety of Portuguese fishing and other boats. The fishermen and
mariners, with their swarthy complexions and the diversified colours of their costumes, lend an agreeable
and picturesque attraction to the scene, which is not a little heightened by the soft tints of the sky and the
mildness of the surrounding atmosphere.


CINTRA.
As we advance along the coast of Portugal the high ground of Cintra comes in view. The vessel,
however, does not approach sufficiently near to allow it to he seen to advantage. Cintra is in every respect the
most delightful spot in Europe. It contains every variety of the beautiful in nature and in art. Amidst rocks,
cataracts and precipices, palaces and gardens arise convents are erected on stupendous heights, which are
clothed with magnificent cork trees and mountain moss. Everywhere the green tints of the orange tree
greet the eye, diversified by the foliage of the pale willow and the rich vine. Cintra has a certain histo-
rical interest from the name given to the Convention signed by Sir Hew Dalrymple during the Peninsular
War. Napier, however, has endeavoured to dissipate the error prevailing on this head, by pointing out that
the Convention was signed thirty miles away from Cintra, and had not the remotest connection with the
village.

THE TAGUS.
The mouth of this noble river?the finest in Portugal, and on which the dirty capital, Lisbon, stands
?next comes in view. Numerous vessels, sailing under different flags, are seen entering the river; and
great varieties of boats ply at the mouth for fishing purposes, or the chances of employment.
The Tagus is in some parts of very great breadth ?not less than six miles from shore to shore. Two
hundred and fifty years ago the noblest fleets sailed upon its bosom, for Portugal then ranked foremost
among the great European maritime nations. Now-a-days the only large vessels seen there are the British
men of war and steamers, for the power and wealth of Portugal have declined to a point of insignificance.
The Tagus has acquired an historical interest from the operations of the Duke of Wellington and Lord
Beresford upon its banks.


CAPE TRAFALGAR.
The sight of this celebrated spot, the scene of Nelson?s greatest victory and glorious death, necessarily
awakens strong emotions in the bosoms of Englishmen. It was here that, on the morning of October the
21st, 1805, Nelson?s eager pursuit of the French and Spanish fleets, under Yilleneuve and Gravina, was
crowned with success. He had followed them from Toulon and Cadiz to the West Indies and back again,
and at length found them drawn up in a double line of battle off Cape Trafalgar. The attack was made
by the British fleet in two columns, Nelson leading the windward line in the Victory, and Admiral
Collingwood heading the leeward line. A battle ensued which lasted for three hours, the English obtaining
a decisive victory. Not less than nineteen French sail of the line, with Admiral Yilleneuve and two other
flag officers, were captured. The Spaniards fled, but were subsequently captured by Sir Richard Strachan.
This victory was dearly purchased. Lord Nelson was killed by a ball from the rifle of an American in the top
of one of the French men-of-war. The Admiral was distinguished by the stars and orders which he wore
during the action. His death plunged the country into great grief, and many honours were paid to his memory.

TARIFA.
Is a town which stands upon the southernmost point of the coast of Spain, near the entrance to the
Pillars of Hercules, as the Straits of Gibraltar were formerly called.
This striking point of land claims attention on the score of the military operations of which it was
the scene during the Peninsular War. The French, in great strength, made desperate efforts to obtain
possession of the place, hut they were defeated in every attempt by the gallant garrison, under the
command of General Skerrett. The 87th Royal Irish Fusileers distinguished themselves much in the
defence under their gallant commander Lord (then Sir Hugh) Gough.


GIBRALTAR.
This celebrated rock constitutes the first coaling place of the outward bound steamer. The scenery
which surrounds it is striking and picturesque. In front, upon a slight eminence, ? the Village of St.
? Roque, grins like a set of white teeth, with precipices for its jaw, and the celebrated cork wood for its
? moustaches.? Beyond, we behold the mountains of Grenada?to the right is a low sandy tract, the
neutral ground between the Spanish coast and the British fortress. An amphitheatre of finely undulated
hills, with Algesiras in their bosom, sweeps along the left. Numerous merchantmen and men of war lie in
the bay, which is otherwise studded with boats, crowded with Spanish, Gallican, and Genoese porters,
sailors, &c. Gibraltar possesses much historical interest. It was held by the Moors for seven centuries.
In 1462 it was captured by the Spaniards who, in their turn, relinquished it to the English in 1704, by
whom it has since been held as a valuable key to the Mediterranean. An endeavour was made to wrest it
from us by the French and Spaniards under Crillon, but General Elliott repulsed them.


iiflliin^




ALGIERS.
This city, with the adjacent coast, including Cape Caxines , where the French troops landed on their
first visit, eighteen years ago, is the only part of the coast of Africa visible from the steamer?s deck as she
stretches away to Malta. Algiers suggests associations as gratifying to English as to French pride. The
attack upon the forts and moles and vessels of the Dey, by the late Lord Exmouth, will be remembered as
one of the most brilliant achievements of the British Navy.
The place is now in possession of the French, who are making desperate efforts to colonise it. The
French, however, are not reputed to have much skill in the science of colonisation. They do not like to
make up their minds to a permanent residence at a distance from La belle France, and, therefore, neither
amalgamate with the natives, nor attempt to incorporate local with French usages and institutions.


PANTELARIA AND GALEITA.
These small islands in the Mediterranean lie directly in the outward course of the Steamer. The
former is remarkable for its fertility, its fruits and its wines. It is seventeen miles from Sicily, and
acknowledges the government of Malta, by whom it is used as a penal settlement. Galeita stands at the
entrance of the Bay of Tunis. It is celebrated in history as having been taken by the Emperor Charles V.,
when he attempted the siege of Tunis. It was afterwards held by the Christians for many years.
The sea in the vicinity of these islands is pleasantly enlivened by the numerous small Sicilian and
other vessels, which cross from different parts of Italy to Malta, the Coast of Barbary, &c.


?...1.1^^




MALTA.
Previous to arriving at this interesting stage of the voyage, the island of Gozo, which stands to the
north of Malta, is sighted. It offers nothing very striking in its external aspect. Reaching the harbour of
Valetta (Malta) we find it instinct with life. A hundred ships of all nations are here lying at anchor, from
the stately British man-of-war to the tiny speronaro, a species of small packet which comes from Sicily
freighted with fruit and vegetables, for Malta itself yields nothing but oranges and capers. Boats flit
continually about the harbour, going from ship to shore and shore to ship, or conveying people from one
part of the island to another. Steamers are seen leaving the harbour. Rocks covered with every species of
fortification, and tall handsome buildings, castles, hospitals and churches, rise above the harbour, and
almost confuse the traveller with their variety. Malta has, at different periods, been in the possession of
almost every nation under the sun. It was for many years in the hands of the Knights of St. John of
Jerusalem, called at one time the Knights of Rhodes, and afterwards of Malta. It was taken by the
British from the French (who dispossessed the Knights) in 1800, after a rigorous blockade of two years?
duration.


ALEXANDRIA.
The interest attaching to this port belongs exclusively to the past. Founded by Alexander the Great,
because of its capability of becoming the emporium of the trade of the East, it was for a long time the
centre of commerce, the abode of learning, the head-quarters of civilisation. The Septuagint here translated
into Greek the Hebrew version of the Scriptures; here St. Mark preached the Gospel; here Anthony lost
the world in the society of Cleopatra ; and here Sir Ralph Abercromby gained the splendid victories which
drove the French from Egypt. In later ages, sharing in the fluctuations to which the mightiest cities of the
earth have been exposed, Alexandria degenerated into a small fishing village ?the abode of pirates, the
haunt of freebooters. Mahomed Ali, the late Viceroy of Egypt, restored it to importance by re-opening
the Mahmoudie Canal which connected Alexandria with the Nile; and since the Peninsular and Oriental
Company have commenced running their steamers to Egypt, its consequence has still further increased. In
itself Alexandria has few attractions. The locality is low, level, and sandy. Excepting a large place or
quadrangle, in which are the dwellings of the various Consuls, the hotels, and the offices of the European
merchants, there is nothing in the town worthy of notice. Pompey?s pillar, which stands in the centre of
the square, is an importation. It was taken there by Pompeius, a prefect in the service of Adrian, and
from that prefect it is said to derive its name. Of the modern edifices in the quadrangle, the most remark-
able, the most beautiful, and, to Englishmen, the most interesting, is the Church. Notwithstanding,
however, the assistance of Mahomed Ali, who most munificently gave the site on which it stands, and the
efforts made for its completion, it still unhappily remains unfinished.






MAHMOUDIS CANAL.
This canal derives its name from the Sultan, Mahmoud, during whose reign it was re-opened. It had
become choked up under the Saracenic government. Mahomed Ali employed 250,000 persons to clear it
of the accumulated rubbish. They worked without implements and with food for a month only. Not less
than 20,000 fell victims to famine in the course of a few weeks. But the work was accomplished, and the
Nile led to Alexandria.
Proceeding from Alexandria up the canal before mentioned, the passengers, mails, and cargo of the
steamer are conveyed to Atfe, on the Nile, where they are transferred to steam-vessels constructed to convey
them to Cairo. Independent of historical --associations, and the fact of its being the source of the
agricultural wealth of Egypt, there is little upon the banks of the portion of the Nile traversed on the
Overland Route worthy of particular notice.


BOULAO
Is the port of Cairo. In the Diorama, the steamer is supposed to have arrived late at night. Camels,
donkeys, and omnibuses (for to the enterprise of the Peninsular and Oriental Company it is owing that
such things are now in use in Egypt) are waiting to receive the passengers and their baggage, and to
convey them to Cairo.
It is amusing to hear the donkey boys, dragomans (or interpreters), and porters roaring at the top of
their voices an offer of service. They have acquired a smattering of all the European languages, and invite
attention to their donkeys in French, Italian, and English. Since the vans or omnibusses came into use
their business has much declined.

CAIRO.
El Kahirah (or Cairo), the ? City of Victory,? lies at a distance of two miles from Boulac. Iheroad
thither is broad and sandy. It forms an avenue of olives and sycamores, terminating in an illusive picture,
composed of all the varieties of oriental architecture, intermingled with foliage of a diversified character.
The bold range of the Mokattan mountains skirts thecity, and altogether offers a charming spectacle. Cairo itself
is full of interest. No oriental town more completely realises the Ideas first generated by a perusal of the
Arabian Nights? Entertainments. The alleys, lanes, and bazaars ?for there is nothing in the town in the
shape of a wide street ?are filled with cloth, leather, hardware, and Kahoh shops ; barbers and oil-merchants,
tall camels, gorgeously trapped horses, donkeys, and the veiled beauties of the harem, jostle the foot pas-
senger at every step. The passengers arriving by the steamers from Cairo are here conveniently accom-
modated in spacious hotels, at the expense of the Peninsular and Oriental Company, and here they remain
until the semaphoric signals placed across the Desert to Suez, announce the arrival of the steamer which is
to carry them to India. Sometimes the steamer is three or four days after the usual time ; sometimes it
reaches Suez before the steamer from England has got to Alexandria. In the former case, time and oppoi-
tunity are afforded the passengers of visiting the Pyramids, the Petrified Forest, the Pachas Palace and
Gardens at Shouhra, the Egg-hatching Depot, and a variety of lesser objects of attraction. The baggage
of the passengers, together with the cargo for trading purposes having been forwarded, the passengers entei
the vans provided for their accommodation (each van holding six persons and drawn by foui swift horses),
and proceed on their journey at a rapid pace.


THE CEMETERY,
Almost the first object which attracts the notice of the traveller, as he emerges from the gate of Cairo
on his journey across the desert, is the Mussulman Cemetery. The Mussulmen, with greater consideration
for the health of the town than is evinced by nations of higher pretensions to civilisation, countenance
extra-mural interment.
The Cemetery of the Mussulmans is an object of serious interest from the respect invariably paid by
the Mahomedans to the dead, especially to those who are supposed, during their lives, to have practised the
virtues of charity and devotion. To such persons tombs are almost invariably erected, and to every one of
these little edifices some lonely Arab attaches himself, in many cases, perhaps, that he may subsist without
labour on the offerings of the pious, but often, it cannot be doubted, that he may do honour to the departed
saint. The greatest care is taken that the tombs be not defaced or injured, which accounts, in a great
degree, for the fine state of preservation in which many mausolea were found before the European visitor
began to evince his passion for carrying away precious reliques of his adventure.


1 1 l^fl




THE DEAD CAMEL.
This striking scene delineates an incident of frequent occurrence on the desert route. The camel
driver derived his subsistence by supplying water to the stations, for there are no springs or rivulets
in the Desert whence it can he drawn. The camel is supposed to have died on its way to the stations, and
the poor owner, lost in grief at the calamity, prostrates himself upon the body of the animal, deaf to the
consolations of an Arab friend who has just come up. The camel is an invaluable servant to the wanderers
of the desert. He is capable of carrying loads of one thousand to twelve hundred pounds weight for nine
days, without other food than the stray thorn, or a hall of paste provided by the owner. By an instinct of
nature he will drink water enough before his departure to last for several days, the water being preserved
pure in a cavity of the stomach, of which the camel has five, one more than the majority of ruminating
animals, who are supplied with four only.
As soon as a camel dies, the vultures of the desert, seeing the carcase afar off, assemble in its vicinity
and await, in hungry impatience, the departure of the desolate owner, that they may satiate their ravenous
appetite upon the animal?s remains.


THE CENTEAL STATION.
At intervals of eight or ten miles along the desert there are small buildings, used as post houses, where
relays of horses are kept for the vans. The central, or half-way station is the largest of the number. Here
a halt of three or four hours takes place, and the passengers by the vans are enabled to regale themselves on
a dinner or supper of roast fowls, ?the produce of the artificial egg-hatching system in vogue in Egypt
pigeons, mutton, pale-ale, wine, &c., at the cost of the Peninsular and Oriental Company. The halt at the
central station is the occasion of much mirth, as it brings together again all the passengers by the steamei
who have been temporarily separated into sections of half a dozen each. Sometimes an Arab Sheik and bis
followers arrive at the stations much about the same time with the vans, and afford those passengers who
can speak Arabic an opportunity of conversing with them upon local matters.






ARABS ON HORSEBACK.
A few hundred yards from the central station, a solitary Acacia tree stands in the middle of the dreary
plains, where no other trace of vegetation is to he seen. The tree is held in great veneration by the
Moslems. The pilgrims to Mecca, on returning to Cairo, generally suspend to its branches a piece of rag
torn from their clothes.
The group, and the two columns of cavalry seen crossing the desert, represent the Arabs in the
service of the Pacha. They make fine soldiers, hut are a brave and dissolute class, as ? rude and
? gross in manners as they are ferocious in character.? Issuing poor and friendless from their desert homes,
they feel that their sole dependence is upon the sword ; and, possessing indomitable valour, they consider as
their property whatever they can render themselves masters of by fraud or violence.
The horses on which these soldiers, and others in the Diorama are represented as being mounted, are,
for the most part, of the fine Nedj breed, some noble specimens of which are in the stables of the Pacha of
Egypt, Accustomed to traverse the deep sands, they are capable of accomplishing long journeys with a
speed that would surprise even the Englishman accustomed to the hunters and thorough-hreds of his own
country. It was not without reason that the Jockey Club of England declined to incur the responsibility
of accepting a challenge by the Pacha, to pit his horses against the best England could produce in a race
of ten or twelve miles over desert sand.


ENCAMPMENT BY NIGHT.
Of all the varieties of tent used by the Nomade tribes who inhabit the vast deserts and plains of
Persia, Arabia, and Asia Minor, there are none, perhaps, so rude and homely as those of the Bedouin Arabs.
They are usually composed of a species of felt, open in front and at the sides, and rarely contain those
divisions which, with other classes of Mahomedans, are held indispensable to the seclusion and accom-
modation of the female members of a wandering family.
The Arab is very hospitable. The stranger even is welcome to his tent, and secure from violence as
long as he remains its inmate. His security, however, often terminates with his temporary sojourn, for,
unless they should have eaten salt together, the host will not scruple to overtake and rob the traveller as he
journeys onward.
The Bedouins, though generally an untamed and untameable race, hold the Pacha of Egypt in awe,
and never venture to molest travellers passing through his territory.

WOMEN DRAWING WATER.
The group here depicted serves at once to convey an idea of the domestic occupations of the humbler
orders of females in Egypt, and to impart some notion of the grace and symmetry of their forms. The
water which they draw from the well, in the vicinity of Suez, is of a brackish kind, hut the inhabitants are
fain to be content with it as they are at too great a distance from the Nile or any other purer spring.
The well, in Egypt, is the grand gossipping place of the women. They set no value upon time, and are
consequently, never in a hurry. On their way, to and fro, they saunter along leisurely, with a dignified
indifference to everything in the world hut their own private affairs.
The vessels in which the water is conveyed are either of copper or brass, or earthenware, and they cor-
respond in form with those seen in the sculptures and bas-reliefs upon the ruins of ancient Egypt.
When we get to this well we are near our journey?s end. There a race takes place among the
omnihusses, the passengers, in their earnestness to get to Suez, generally urging the Arab drivers to use
their best speed, and promising hucksheesh, or presents, for priority.


JOSEPH?S WELL.
Joseph?s Well, or Yuzoof?s Well?or, according to some authorities, the Well of Moses ?is a fount of
extremely brackish water in the vicinity of Suez. It is a popular halting place for caravans of camels and
stray travellers, and, if it presents nothing more, offers to the eye of the observer many picturesque objects
in the costume of the natives, the beautiful form of their horses, the gaiety of their trappings, and so forth.
The ruined Mausoleum, in the vicinity of the well, is used as a sort of guard house by the soldiery
employed to see that the water is neither injured nor carried away in superfluous quantities. The well
is seen in the foregoing plate. The one facing the page represents the guard house.

DEPARTURE. FROM SUEZ.
At Suez the Passengers of the Overland Route again take ship. The embarkation is effected in boats
which carry them to the vessel in the roadstead. The house with the verandah, on the left, was at one
time the residence of Napoleon Buonaparte.


THE RED SEA WHERE THE ISRAELITES CROSSED.
A spot so celebrated in Sacred History as the portion of the Red Sea left dry by the miraculous
interposition of the Almighty, that his chosen children might escape the pursuit of Pharaoh and his host,
cannot fail to be regarded with thrilling interest. Attempts have been made by sceptical and profane writers
to show that the separation of the waters was the result of a tidal operation to which the Red Sea is liable.
These, however, have been demonstrated by innumerable writers and travellers to have been unsound
theories, which scarcely deserved credit even for ingenuity. Nothing but a miracle could have provided the
Israelites with a dry passage.
The name of the Red Sea is derived from the Greek translation of the Hebrew title ?the ? Sea of
? Edom ? ?Edom meaning indifferently ? Arabia,? or ? Bed.? The Greeks adopted the latter, and hence
the popular impression respecting the real origin of the term. The ? Weedy Sea? or " Sea of Weeds,? is
another name home by the Red Sea, and originating in the quantity of white coral growing upon its banks.
We are now at Suez ; the omnibuses are seen approaching the town; and the steamer, with her
steam up, awaits, in the offing, the signal of departure.

JEDDAH.
The Port of Jeddah, on the eastern shore of the Red Sea, is celebrated as the point of debarkation for
the thousands of pilgrims who resort thither from all parts of the east, for the purpose of proceeding to
Mecca and Medina. The birth place and the burial place of the founder of the Mahomedan religion are
regarded by the followers of the Prophet, as places of great sanctity. Mussulmans throughout India, Persia,
Affghanistan, and Tartary, invariably turn their faces to the west when performing their morning and
evening devotions ?because the sacred shrines lie in a westerly direction; and those who can either find
leisure or means endeavour, at some period of their lives, to make a pilgrimage to Mecca or Medina, or both,
and thereby earn the appellation of Hadjee, or pilgrim, which ensures them a certain degree of respect on
earth, and is supposed to carry with it an assurance of eternal beatitude.
The dirty habits of the Mussulmans and the crowded state of the vessels in which they obtain con-
veyance to Jeddah are sources of disease and great discomfort to those who navigate the ships, as well as
to the pilgrims themselves, hut the cupidity of the owners, and the fervent piety of the devotees, make them
alike indifferent to annoyance and suffering.


MOCHA.
Mocha, renowned in Europe as the port whence the finest Coffee is exported, formerly enjoyed con-
siderable celebrity in the East as the emporium of the trade of the Gulph of Arabia. Not a week passed
in which caravans did not arrive from Senna, Cairo, Mecca, and Alexandria, with dried fruits, drugs, coins,
cattle, and, in fact, all the produce of Arabia. It was governed by a Sheik, and, as its position gave it, in a
measure, the command of the commerce of the Eed Sea, it need not be wondered at that many tyrannies
and iniquities were practised upon all the Europeans who visited the port in the capacity of traders. The
early voyages and travels of adventurers to the far East are replete with anecdotes of the arbitrary conduct,
the oppressions, and spoliations of the governors of Mocha.






ADEN,
A port near the mouth of the Red Sea, now in the possession of the English, and admirably well
suited to the purpose of a coal depot. It formerly belonged to the Arabs, and was then very thinly populated,
but since it fell into our hands its commerce and population have vastly increased. There is an hotel upon
the shore of the little hay in which Aden stands. It is tenanted and conducted by some Parsees of Bombay,
(descendants of the ancient fire-worshippers of Persia,) who supply the passengers with a dinner of fried
fish ? a luxury even to the sumptuously regaled guest of the steamer?and provide donkeys for a ride to the
town and fortifications of Aden.
The view here given is that of the town of Aden itself, which is not seen from the deck of the steamer,
because the anchorage is in what is called Backbay, at some little distance from the town.


POINT DE GALLE, CEYLON.
A more beautiful and picturesque scene cannot be offered to the eye of the traveller, wearied with the
continued expanse of azure and ultra-marine. The island of Ceylon is one of the most favoured spots in
the East. Yielding abundance of coffee, cinnamon, and other spices, the air is perfumed with a delicious
fragrance, while the varied foliage of the fruit trees and gigantic oriental plants, imparts a rich green hue to
the surface of the land. The useful cocoa-nut tree and the bread-fruit tree grow here in perfection; the former
in thick groves, fringing the shores of Point de Galle. There is an old Dutch fort here, which stretches out
across the harbour, and would doubtless afford good protection if the place were attacked. The stay of the
steamer at Point de Galle affords time for a short ride into the interior to view the cinnamon gardens, always
objects of special interest. From Ceylon, when she has taken in her fuel, the steamer now proceeds to
Madras.






CALCUTTA.
This town, emphatically the ? City of Palaces,? hursts upon the view as you round a reach of the
river Hooghley, after passing through green and shady banks, on which stand a number of beautiful houses,
occupied by the principal inhabitants. A great portion of the glories of the architecture of Calcutta are
disclosed at once. There is the Government House, erected in the time of the Marquess Wellesley, the
Town Hall, the Supreme Court, the Ochterlony Monument, the principal Government Offices, and a number
of private edifices. The natives, in their variegated costumes (for some of which they are indebted only to
Dame Nature), the Europeans, with their palankeens and carriages, the Body Guard of the Governor-
General, the boats and pinnaces which ply upon the Hooghley, all combine to present a striking picture, and
to furnish at once a termination to the voyage, and a climax to the Diorama.

Has been established with an especial view to promote $
| good fellowship and brotherly feeling amongst all sections \
I of the Great English Family everywhere. The United \
I States, the British Empire the World over, and, if there
1 be any beside, ? the strangers scattered ? of the Anglo-
1 Saxon Race, all may here meet upon one common ground, $
| and co-operate for the social amelioration of every class |
| in their universal commonwealth. |
(Cjjt Itigln-laxntl is conducted entirely by
private Gentlemen, whose object is to serve the cause of |
rational and comprehensive philanthropy. Interfering in |
> no way with the many excellent Reviews or Political |
| Periodicals of our time, it occupies its own new and fair |
field. Leagued with no party, it is pledged only to j
1 maintain a charitable moderation in every minor matter, 1
\ and to hold inviolate the three great principles ?Glory to |
* God in the Highest, Peace on Earth, Good Will towards
Men.
The ANGLO-SAXON is published on the first Day of every Month,
\ Price 2s. 6c?. |

\ The first Volume is now ready, handsomely bound, price One Guinea.
? The Anglo-Saxon more than realises the expectations raised by its announcement
at the beginning of the year. It is now lying before us, and for beauty of typographical
execution and richness and tastefulness of illustration, stands wholly unrivalled among
Periodicals. The contents present a not unharmonious mixture of antiquarian lore
with modern topics; Essays on the great questions of the day, alternating with disqui-
s sitions on the ancient history and language of the Anglo-Saxon race. These are
relieved by poetic contributions of more than ordinary merit.? . . . ? The design
of this new Periodical is interesting and promising." ? John Bull.

? The Anglo-Saxon makes his appearance this month in high spirits, and with a
gallant and buoyant bearing worthy of his lineage. We are always glad to see his good-
humoured face; for albeit some little differences in detail may very likely arise between
us in matters political or polemic, they will but add a zest and racy flavour to our con-
fabulations ; for we like to hear his ringing and cheerful voice, assuring us that it is
no visionary or impossible thing to promote peace and goodwill upon this earth among
men of the same kindred, speaking a common tongue, and, ? with many dear recollec-
tions and holy ties, blending their thoughts and affections in harmony and oneness
that it is no delusion to cheer poor hearts, or shame dull spirits, with the cry of ? the
good days of old,? or ? the better times to come; ? or to recommend that Colonies
should be independent, ?not of the support, encouragement, and protection, ?but of
the over-government of the mother country. We are sorry we have not space left to go
through some of the topics which the Anglo-Saxon has presented this month to our
notice. All we can now add is, that his companionship is very pleasant, and his
effusions very attractive.? Morning Chronicle.
