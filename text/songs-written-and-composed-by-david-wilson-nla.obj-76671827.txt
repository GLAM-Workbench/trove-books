THE STREAM OF LIFE
* * tjfc** -


THE STREAM OF LIFE.
||P)o not speak of those that?s humble?
Life is like the running streams ;
You may some day fall or stumble
If you live beyond your means.
Future thoughts are bright and pleasant,
Long and peacefully we?ll wait ;
Happiness is seldom present,
Comes some time but often late.
Men will always fret and worry,
Battle hard while in the fray.
Every generation hurries
Cheats a wee bit every day.
Speak of pleasure not of sorrow,
In our graves we?ll soon decay ;
Death may come to us to-morrow,
Live in peace in every way.
Sometimes life is very dreary
When our health and strength are gone
Let us help the sick and weary,
Life is not so very long.
Work brings health : gold brings sorrow ;
Sin we must to gain our prey,
Pray at night then sin to-morrow,
On and on from day to day.
Life should never be forlorn,
Every one must have his day,
Each and all must have a thorn
Pierce his heart in every way.
Old and young must pull together
In this weary world of strife ;
Live with Christ in Heaven forever,
Lead a true and virtuous life.

GARDENIA


GARDENIA.
day I lost my pretty flower,
I?ve watched it?s bloom for many an hour
And kept it from the winter?s shower,
At last it went beyond my power,
When dead there seems to be no pain,
It dies to grow a pretty flower again.
The leaves were sparkling white with snow,
The sweetest flowers on earth must go,
For nature has ordained it so,
To die and live again to grow.
When dead there seems to be no pain,
It dies to grow a pretty flower again.
Just as the golden sun?s rays passed,
I saw its leaves were fading fast,
And then the flower dropped off at last,
Leaves one more memory of the past.
When dead there seems to be no pain,
It dies to grow a pretty flower again.
To he sung after the last verse
iMy toil and labours not in vain,
The clouds that sprinkle drops of rain,
The sun from Heaven will shine the same
To make that flower bloom forth again.

A WEE BIT O? SCOTCH LOVE.
�HE days and hours tak? lang to pass
When hadden o? the ploo, man,
If ye shude hae a bonny lass
An? want tae pree her moo, man ;
The watch comes out a hunder times,
Ye think it awfu? slow, man,
An? fain wid try an? gie?t a shuve
Tae try an' make it go, man.
At last he hears the Toon Hoose clock,
A-hammerin? a? its micht, man,
He slaps the horses richt an? left,
Ye ne?er saw sic a sicht, man ;
He gies them baith a rubbin? doon,
An? puits them in th? byre, man,
Then rinnin? hame wi? a? his micht
Ye?d think th? Toon?s on fire, man.
He sees her coinin? ower th? hill,
A wee afore her time, man,
His heart keeps dauddin? oot an? in,
He thocht she look?d sae fine, man ;
He tak?s her canny roond th? waist,
An? gi?es a wee bit squeeze, man,
She says, ? Ye mauna du?t agen/?
But didna look displeased, man.
They sat an? crack?t awa? a-while
Their heeds gye close th?gether, man
He?ll whisper in her lug at times,
While sittin? on th? heather, man ,
They think its time for walkin? hame
Afore it gets ower dark, man,
It tak?s twa ?ours tae walk a mile
An think that?s awfu? smart, man.

THE WEE WEE COUNTRY FARM.


THE WEE, WEE COUNTRY FARM
?fljjjHE bonnie birdies in th? spring,
They hop about th? leaves that hing ;
An? aye, 1 like tae hear them sing
Upon th? wee wee farm.
Th? birds whin seen in broad day-licht
Their breasts are unca red and bricht,
An? oh, they are a cheerfu? sicht
Upon th? wee, wee farm.
Chorus ?Then come awa? my bonnie lass,
iMy bonnie, bonnie Hieland lass,
Just come awa? my bonnie lass
An? dwell on a wee, wee farm.
Ye?ll see th? puir wee things at rest,
Their heeds close nestled on their breast,
They are sae happy and sae blest
Upon th? wee, wee farm.
They dinna look just a? th? same,
There?s some that looks tae be sae tame,
Tae shut thim up would be a shame,
Upon th? wee, wee farm.
Chorus ?Then come awa?, &c.
It ?s there ye?ll see th? real mag-pie,
They?ll scream awa? whin passin? by,
At fouer o?clock ye?ll hear them cry,
Upon th? wee, wee farm.
Th? hills ye see sae far awa?
Aye. look sae big and grand and braw,
An? whiles ye?ll see them white wi? snaw
Upon th? wee, wee farm.
Chorus ?Then come awa?, &c.

THE COUNTRY FIDDLER.
WEE bit laddie fewer year auld,
Str|u He?s dre?st aye naet an? fine,
A penny he gets ilka day,
Fir breed tae fill his wyme.
If he gets bawbees fir a lunch,
He?ll tie them in a cloot,
But disna let his mither ken,
Or guess what he?s aboot.
Aye day I saw him rinnin? hame,
Wi? something in a pock,
An? keepin? clear o? everything,
Fir fear he?d get it broke ;
He opened up the bag, an? takes
A fiddle an? a bow,
His mither thocht he was tae be
A fiddler like Neil Gow,
He tried th? G, D, A, and E,
But took it awfu? slow,
He cudna get the strings tae soond,
Nae rozzen on th? bow ;
He ran th? bow across th? strings,
An? scraped wi? a? his micht,
He scaer?d his mither oot tha hoose,
It gaed her sic? a fricht.
A fiddler cam? ta? teach th? lad,
Three nichts in ilka week
They played awa? for ?oors at times,
It made a body seek ;
Next week he tried tae play a wee,
Th? tune was tl Auld Lang Syne;
His mither keekin thro? a hole,
She thocht it soonded fine.
He grew to be a muckle chield,
A player he wis na? doot,
His mither hed an awfu? fecht,
Tae keep him in-a-boot,
He plays at balls an? parties noo,
The country folk, they say,
He beats th? fiddler roond aboot,
An? drunk maest every day.

THE OLD MAN?S LAMENT FOR HAME.


THE OLD MANS LAMENT FOR NAME
*s|f FRET an? sigh as time rolls by,
Tae wander through th? glen,
An? meet wi? onny my friends at hame
Or folk that I used tae ken ;
Th? hoose is sma? an? thatched wi? straw
Th? door ye canna see,
Wi? ivy growin? up the wa?,
It ? s there I?d like tae dee.
Th? banks are steep wi? burnie?s deep,
That drives th? miller?s wheel,
Th? fish that?s caught in them at times
Wud fill a muckle creel.
Th? sweet blue-bells an? bonnie dells,
Th? grand Argyleshire coo,
An? mony a braw young Hieland lass,
A man wid like tae woo.
Th? southern sky looks bricht an? high,
An bonnie blue th? sea,
A land o? wealth an? happiness,
But hame I?d like tae be,
I?m gettin? auld, my blud runs cauld,
I?ll soon be ca?d awa,
If I hid wings tae flee across,
I?d gie them a? a ca?.

JOCK IN THE HIELANT REGIMENT


JOCK IN THE HIELANT REGIMENT
a'?M sairgent in a Scotch brigade
? That stood afore th? King,
Th? girls vvud smile an? throw a kiss,
As we marched in a ring ;
I?d wink an? nod whin passin? by,
Tae in cade Mary McFee,
Thin after we?d been all dischairged,
She?d sit an? crack wid me.
Chorus ?My bonnie Mary McFee,
Your just th? lass for me ;
Whin drink is in, it makes me sing
Oh bonnie Mary McFee.
Your of th? Hieland stock,
An? just th? lass for Jock ;
Thin come awa my bonnie wee lass,
An? sit doon on my knee.
Whin paid th? tirst o? every month,
I?d treat my Mary dear,
An? if there?s onny money left,
I?ll spend it on a beer ;
Or if I?d meet th? Hieland lads,
We?ll soon get up th? steam.
An? drink awa till broad day-light,
A rowdy lot whin seen.
Chorus ?My bonnie Mary, &c.
I thocht I?d like tae have a change,
An? took anither route,
I met a fine big handsome lass,
Whin prowlin? roond about,
I kissed her lips an? thin her cheek,
Her nose an? thin her chin,
The taste is on my lips since thin,
Likeguid auld Holland gin.
Chorus ?My bonnie Mary, &c.

THE LAUGHING JACKASS.
year ninty-nine on the fourth of July,
A laughing jackass and his mate
flew near by.
They sat for some time on the limb of a tree,
As pretty a picture as you?d wish to see ;
They laugh?d, ha ha haw, while they sat in the
shade
And looked so contented not one being afraid.
Chorus
They laugh ha ha haw and they laugh?t ho ho
how,
And they ha ha ha, ha ha ha, ha ha ha, ha
ha ha, ho ho ho, ho ho ho, ho ho ho, ho
ho ho.
They laughed at the man as he turned up the
mound,
The way he?s perspiring while ploughing the
ground,
He?d rest for a time, wipe the sweat from his brow,
Then start his gray mare once again to the plow,
He saw them so happy, and here's what he said?
? You laugh there much longer I?ll shoot you both
dead.?
Chorus ?They laugh?t ha ha, &c.
They laugh?t ha ha haw while he?s off for his gun,
Then crawling up close, sheltered out from the sun ;
When he got within twenty yards of the tree,
And knelt down quite gently upon his right knee,
He fires at the birds with the greatest of care,
But being so excited he misses the pair.
Chorus ?They laugh?t ha ha, &c.

SUN AND SNOW.
/?I5 Y the look I?m told I?m ninety years old,
For the rest of my life I?m wanting a wife,
Gfs I?ve a neat little cot in a nice little spot,
Nowthen girls, you must not delay for one day ;
She must be genteel, and can cook a good meal,
To sing and be able to play,
To wash and to darn the holes in my socks,
And go to church every Sunday.
Chorus.
Now girls don?t lose the chance one day,
Get married now at once I say,
A few more years soon roll away,
Then down I?ll go below, hurray !
If you can get hold of the cash.
You?ll have plenty of boys on the mash ;
Then wed the young man you loved some
time ago,
And then you?ll be happy I know.
Now my hair is quite grey, still I?m happy and gay,
I?m healthy and strong, but it won?t last for long,
I?m the same every day, but I like my own way,
Now then girls you must not delay for one day ;
1 don?t want her tall, and 1 don't want her small,
Her height must be neat four feet three,
And don?t go out flirting about every night,
But keep in good friendship with me.
Chorus ?Now girls, &c.


THE WHITE LILY.


THE WHITE LILY.
f*
HE sweetest lilies ever grew
Up from a nasty pool ;
The water being so filthy too,
They looked there nice and cool.
They grew and flourished in the sun
With roots deep in the mud ;
And felt quite independent too,
Then springs a little bud.
The bud soon grew and opened wide
To show the lily white,
No artist could have painted such
A grand artistic sight.
At last it got so frail and weak,
They did not last lor long ;
To die and live in spring again,
That ends the lily song.

THE OLD MAN'S FAREWELL.


THE OLD MAN?S FAREWELL
ftMHEN Angels in the Heavens appeal
I hear a voice say, ? Come,?
The time for my departure ?s near,
My Saviour calls me home ;
The battle?s o?er, the race is run,
Then all my troubles cease,
I feel as if the prize were won,
So let me die in peace.
My sins I?ve cast away like dust,
That He may judge alone.
I kneel and pray to Him I trust,
On His Almighty Throne.
This world I leave without a tear,
My spirit will ascend,
And leave some friends I love sincere
Oh Lord on them descend.
I must obey my Lord?s command,
And soon will be on high,
To dwell in that celestial land
Away beyond the sky.
My three score years and ten are passed,
I feel that I must die ;
The day, the hour, has come at last,
Good bye, dear friends, good bye.
