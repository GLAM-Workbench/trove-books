THE COLONY OF TASMANIA,
The Island of Tasmania is situated at the extreme south of the continent of Australia, and is divided
from the main land by Bass’s Straits, 120 miles wide. It is 170 miles in extent from north to south and
about 160 miles from east to west, and is calculated to contain about 26,000 square miles, or an area of
17,778,000 acres, about 10,000,000 of which are still in the hands of the Government-
CLIMATE. One of the chief attractions of the Colony is the salubrity of its climate. The surface is diversified
by ranges of hills and valleys, with occasionally large plains well cultivated, which give it much the
appearance of the Old Country.
The population on the 31st December, 1882, was estimated to be 122,000. There are no natives in

Licenses for pastoral lands are issued at rates having regard to the class of the land and the number
of sheep and cattle which can be fed thereon, the rent being calculated on the carrying capacity of the land,
at the rate of from 4d. to Bd. per annum for each sheep, or 2s. to 4s. a head for cattle.
AGRICULTURE.
The climate of the colony is so temperate and equable, and the quality of the soil, almost throughout,
is so rich, that it produces almost any kind of vegetation. Although farming has of late years not been so
very remunerative, yet it is freely asserted that the large influx of population which is now taking place, in
connection with the important mineral resources of the colony, has already given a considerable impetus to
the farming industries,
and that it is likely to rapidly increase.

EDUCATION. The Board of Education has the management of the public schools and the distribution of the moneys
granted by the Legislature for educational purposes. It fixes the locale of schools, regulates the course of
instruction, the examination and classification of teachers, the issue of certificates of competency to teachers,
and the maximum fees to be charged by teachers. It also prescribes the functions and duties of local school
boards, and awards exhibitions from public to superior schools.
The attendance of children at school is compulsory under a fine of £2, unless it can be shown that the
child is being privately educated, or is prevented by sickness or other valid cause from being present. The
teaching is entirely unsectarian, but opportunities are given for religious instruction when desired.
The total expenditure on the public schools during 1881 amounted to £26,074, of which sum £19,648
was contributed by Government and £7,026 by the public in the shape of school fees.

LABOUR AND The °l Immigration report, dated Ist April, 1884, states: —
yya“There is a brisk demand for domestic servants, who immediately And suitable employment at
remunerative wages. The Schedule herewith given of the rates of wages now Current may be relied upon;
but at the present time there is no great requirement of skilled labour of any kind, since the dull season of
the year is upon us and winter approaching. Railway navvies and industrial labourers can, however, be sure
of obtaining constant work.
“AH the Immigrants hitherto arrived have found employment, with remunerative wages; and since
it is decided that only the very moderate number of 100 Immigrants per month shall, in future, be intro-
duced into the Colony, it is certain that they would be absorbed in the labour market without any derange-
ment of the current wages.
“ The Railways and Public Works authorised, and for which a sum of £BOO,OOO has been voted, will
be put under contract in about three months from the present time, and will find continuous employment fox-
most classes of labour.
