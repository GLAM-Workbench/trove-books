The First Boke
of
Fowle Ayres  
Australia, 1944




PRELUDE
Opposite Sydney school of Arts
assemble divers men of parts
within a cafe where they sit
baking by halves the pie of wit.
From time to time they crack a jest
but find its contents have gone west
occasionally they make a pun
merely to show it is not done.
For parodies they have no penchant,
their social satire is not trenchant;
their nine-months muse is up the pcle,
these literati on the dole.
NEO-WOWSERISM
"I have never done it since I was changed
(heard at a meeting of Buchmanites).
The dirtiness of wowsers' minds
entails the drawing of their blinds
but Buchmanites ope windows wide
so all the world can see inside.
Behind the shutters, since he must,
the wowser slakes his shameful lust'
a reverent world can see the sights
when Jesus rapes the Buchmanites.
HYMN
Lie down, lie down for Jesus,
ye ladies of the Cross:
lift up your torn chemises:
ye shall not suffer loss:
But rather shall ye profit,
upon each creaking bed:
when resurrected off it,
you'll  find that you wire dead. 


BALLADE OF LOST PHRASES
In what museum now abide
The pamphlets that we read of yore:
Where are the orators that cried
"We will not fight a bosses' war,
"The System's not worth fighting for,"
"To Hell with Jingo profiteer,
"The Empire's rotten to the core,"
--- Where are the phrases of yesteryear?
No longer can it he denied,
The Left Book Club's become a bore:
We're social patriots double-dyed.
And social fascists too, what's more.
We tolerate Sir Samuel Hoare!
Churchill now delights the ear.
And Beaverbrook is to the fore.
--- where are the phrases of yesteryear?
The Party Line from side to side
Zig-zagged till our eyes were sore;
Can it be the Marxists --- lied?
Peace to the shades of Inprecorr!
The left wing's moulting on our shore:
It will not fly again, I fear.
Freedom has become a whore.
--- Where are the phrases of yesteryear?
ENVOI
Comrades, we argued, fought and swore:
We might as well have stuck to beer.
The Japanese are in Johore
--- W  here are the phrases of yesteryear?
ON R--- B---
Intoxication, heavenly maid descend!
and light upon our once teetotal friend;
roll on, thou deep and dark red liquor, roll,
down R--- B---'s gullet into R--- B?'s soul.


FALL OF THE HOUSE  OF USHER'S:
a rondeau.
Say, Nelly, shall th' explosive bomb
shatter the drinker's full aplomb?
and loungers on the brassoed rail
consume a Molotov  cocktail?
The debauchees of gin and  lime,
committing an unheard-of crime,
forsake their drinks before it' s time,
enchanted by the siren's wait?
Ah,    Nelly, say!
Shall unctuous voice of Uncle Tom
broadcast how queens are parted from
their pathics and their pots of ale,
and buggers off to buggery sail
in punctuality sublime?
Ah, Nelly, say!
IN MEMORIAM: AUSTRALIA WORST
The Publicist no more can please
the ceremonious Japanese:
its meeting in the Adyar hall
became a most unseemly brawl,
and Stephensen was showered with bricks
- by patriotic Bolsheviks.

LAMPOON
Sober we wait in cafes for a sot
who wastes his wages on the daily pot,
who mocks our abject impecunious state
by telling us how he was drunk of late:
who boasts of his capacity, and then,
how he bought hinges five for other men.
In vain do we entreat, ye Bacchic powers!
He always comes to meet us after hours.


HOMAGE TO "PROLETARIAN" "WRITERS"
(Air: "Keep The Home Fires Burning ).
Let's be crafty-arty,
let's support the Party,
Party members fall in line with the bourgeois*;
keep the red flag flying,
all its past denying,
till we've won the war and lost our liberty.
Art is just a weapon
used to put the pep in , . ,
propaganda for the toil of lathe and plough;
Australian New Writing
helps the boys that s fighting _ n _
to keep the things away that we have got here no. .
Post-war Reconstriction
needs our robust fiction,
tales made up of Party slogans, Army slang:
freedom of the papers
ean't include the capers
cut by the "Century" of J. T. Lang.
The sickle and the hammer
make heartstirring drama,
with incidental music by Shostakovich:
« there's a silver lining
in our purses shining:
in the new world order Art will have its niche.
Come, then, sacred cattle.
fight God and Stalin's battle,
all the baddies are upon the other side;
purge from out our faction
individual action;
take the Trotskyists and Langists for a ride.
We shall wear Yes badges,
we shall all be cadgers,
work shall hold no terrors now for you and me.
At our lunch-hour meetings
send fraternal greetings
and your loan investments for the victory.


We shall eat "No" voters
like so many bloaters:
Lenin's indigestion powders ease your paint
little texts of Marx
keep girls out of parks,
save our gallant Allies from ill-gotten gain.
They'll regret the hour
they denied us power:
our pressgangs will be worse than Mr. Bellemore's: 
dirty fascist traitors
shall wear moleskin gaiters,
while we send their sons off to the New World Wars.
ON A YOUNG LADY
She took the course that Fate had dearly bidden:
Her name was Steed, and she was often ridden.
ROUND THE MARBLE ARSE
The Psalmist says: All flesh is grass:
And generally, I admit, that's true.
But I knew a man with a marble arse
Mottled with crimson, green, and blue.
Flesh and blood is weak and frail,
The lover soon becomes a crock:
This man was never known to ful,
For he was founded on a rock!
At death no monumental mason
Augmented the family's funeral bills:
They chiselled his arse off for a basin
And filled it with dancing daffodils.



MY HEART BELONGS TO DADDY
Jesus Christ:
If I weren't J. Christ
I'd feel enticed
To make some good woman a baddie,
I simply adore
A crack at a whore,
But my heart belongs to Daddy.
Mary Mcu/daleue:
You're Hominum Rex
But you've got sex
Just like any ordinary laddie -
Stick Kingdom Come
Right up your Bum.
Jesus Christ:
Ah, no! My heart belongs to Daddy.
Mary Maydaleue:
Well, if your heart belongs to Daddy,
Then tell Daddy to get stuffed as well.
Jesus Christ:
Oh I couldn't do that to my Daddy,
Though I'd like to, I'd like to Oh Hell!
You see, my Daddy's so old-fashioned,
He just wouldn't understand,
So when I feel impassioned,
I got to keep on using my hand!


DIEU ET SON DOIGT
All the saints in Kingdom Come
Sit around and scratch their hum
With their finger,
Hallelujah!
You may think that this is swell,
But I'd rather he in Hell
With my finger.
Hallelujah!
Ladies all, you must be gay,
Jesus Christ is on his way
With his finger,
Hallelujah!
Gentlemen and children too,
Jesus Christ is after you
With his finger,
Hallelujah!
HYMN TO THE SON
Gentle Jesus, meek and mild,
look upon your problem child:
when I lay me down to sleep
I count lovers now, not sheep.
Meek Messiah, calm and chaste
please forgive a lecher's haste;
little girls to you belong:
you are weak and they are strong.
Heed my exasperated sighs:
I can't control my writhing thighs
Now I lay me down to rest
sex jumps up and gets the best
of all my maidenly intent,
because I have to pay the rent.


AMICATORY EPIGRAMS
ON F. THONEMANN
Jove when his amorous freaks began
would turn a bull, not turn a man;
hut Thonemann, or void or full,
can turn his speech to amorous bull.
ON THE CHARMING DIS-GRACES
Dan Cupid's indiscriminate arrows
set gossipping his mother's sparrows;
Venus herself now whispers slyly,
referring  to the sisters Riley.

ON D. W.
Douglas of spidery wrists and shins
becomes a webster when he spins
Arachne's parlour to decoy
the fly of every passing boy.
ON A POEM OF      JAMES MCAULEY
("The yellow rose fades with the red," "your
beauty shall forsake you, dearest," "death not A-
pollo is young beauty's draper etc. etc.).
The bard with fascinated fright
treats topics lesser men think trite-
how dreadful death will drape his love
he roars like any sucking-dove.
A banal sentiment to be
forever brooding on, but he
with variant persistence vaunts it,
until one thinks he really wants it.


ON A PAINTER
Salaciously serene Dobell
took brushes and palette to Hell
and drew the damned with such success
the Sins went out of business.
ON BRENNAN
The moon of his poetic nightmare beams
on dissipated Chris alone in bed;
seductive Lilith slips into his head
and to his thirsty spirit brings wet dreams.
REPLY
A single bed, perhaps, and dreaming of a sprite;
I yet did raise a Forest on my night;
While you, wifh all your words that; burn
Needed a partner to engrave an Em.
CLERIHEWS
John Keats
used to sleep between the sheets.
The reason for this aberration
was that it facilitated masturbation.
Sir Francis Palgrave
should be fitted out with a very small grave;
since he at no stage made an apology
for compiling his anthology.
Sir Arthur Streeton
should have studied Mrs. Beeton.
Then he might have baked haricot beans
bettei than he half-baked Australian scenes.


NEW SONGS FOR OLD
Hark, hark, the clerk in Billingsgate swings,
and feeble gins arise
to warn their daughters of those things
that phallused flowers do prise,
do prise, do prise;
and winking merry bawds begin
to ope their golden thighs;
to every kind of pretty sin
my lady's heat gives rise;
gives rise, gives rise;
my lady's seat gives rise.
f
2.
Where the flea sucks there fuck I;
on a cowherd's balls I lie;
there I crouch when bowels do flie;
after coming wearily.
Wearily, wearily, shall I give » ow
under the bosom that hangs from the cow.
3.
Take, o take those hips away
that completely are outworn,
and those thighs that shake all day,
sights that do exceed the horn:
but my pisses bring me pain,
weals of love concealed in vain.

A VIRAGO AND GOOD EROS
♦
.Feel no more the heat of the son,
nor the curious vintner's pages;
thou thy worldly flask and tun
home hast ta'en and drunk thy wages:
golden lads and girls all must
as chimney-sweepers, come to thrust.
Bear no more the crown of the meat,
thou art past the tiring stroke.


share no more the clothing sheet;
to thee the need is in the poke:
accept his yearning physique, bust
shall hallow thus, and come untrussed.
Leer no more the frightening gash,
gnaw the baldheaded thunderbone;
fear the pander's sensual rash;
thou hast ravished boy and crone:
all lover's fun, all lover's trust,
confinements free from bum to bust.
No circumciser harm thee!
Nor no bitchcraft calm thee!
Most unpaid will snare thee,
stuffing, spill some near thee!
Riot consummation crave
and untrousered be thy knave.

'lt is not growing like a tree
in bulk, doth make men better be."
Ben Jonson.
Cling to me only with thy thighs
and I will wedge with mine,
or lever, miss, thy buttocks up
and while hot buck entwined;
the thrust that from the hole doth rise
doth ask a chink supine,
but nightly at love's hectic tup
I would with thee recline.
Thy vent creates a rosy sheath
not so much honouring thee,
as giving It a hope that there
it could not withered be;
but thou thereon didst only breathe
and sentst it back to me:
since when it grows and smells, I swear
not of itself but thee.


THE VIRGIN MARY BLUES
You Virgin Mary, way down in Galilee,
Done your man wrong, commit adultery,
Cause you can't lose
Dose mean ole Virgin Mary Blues.
Went to your man Joseph, told him Holy Ghost.
Joseph says, "Mary, that don' happen to most.
Dey shore don' choose
Dose mean ole Virgin Mary Blues.''
Joseph went to de lawyer Jehovah was his name
Says to dat lawyer, "Angel Gabriel much to blame.

Tell on mah man, Ah shore will run you out of town.

Joseph went fo* his shotgun, says "Ah'll shore take his life;
Whale Ah been workin', he done work on mah wife:
She lose
Dose mean ole Virgin Mary Blues."
Joseph went gunnin' fo' Gabriel, put him on de spot.
Found him in de speakeasy, mighty high an' hot.
Drownin' in booze

Let dat Angel habe it, filled him full ob lead.
Lor' did dose feathers fly, jes' lak' a feather-bed.
Shook off his shoes
Dose mean ole Virgin Mary Blues.

Turned de heat on Joseph, locked him in the calaboose.

You shore is to blame fo' yo' man fryin dere.
You'll neber lose
Dose mean ole Virgin Mary Blues, -
O what Ah mean is
Dose mean ole Virgin Mary Blueff:
ECCLESIASTICAL LIMERICKS
A deacon of Tartary-Crim,
Whose notions of fucking were grim,
Used to get lots of fun
Out of stuffing a nun
With the sign of the cross on her quim.
The Bishop of Alexandretta
Loved a girl and he couldn't  forget her.
So he thought he'd enshrine her
As the Holy Vagina
In the Church of the Sacred French Letter.
The aged Archbishop of Joppa
Said, "I think circumcision improper
If the organ is small,
But I don't mind at all
About cutting a slice off a whopper. 
CLERIHEW
Rah Fizelle
is not to he confused with Mr. McKell.
- One does modernist paintings;
the other political feintings.


ONCE A  JOLLY DEITY
(Air: "Waltzing Matilda ).
Once a jolly deity camped on Mount Sinai,
and he sang as broke the Ten Commandments
"You'll come a-transubstantiating with m .
a-transubstantiating; a-transubstantiating,
you'll came a-transubstanUatmg
and " betanti ating, Moses, with me",
Moses and Aaron and young Ele^ a J'
camp on the mountain, one two thiee
Eleazar and Aaron much prelerredtheGoldenCalf,
but Moses sang disdainfully, Jehovah
Dating Jehovah; dating Jehovah:
and km s»-S mounta,nslde '
"You'll come a-dating, Jehovah, with me .
Up strolled a damsel, come out of Nazareth
and round behind the burning bush,
"You'll come a-whoring, Jehovah, with m .
whoring Jehovah etc.
The Lord God Almighty called up Angel Gabriel,
pinched for committing adultery;
and he sang as he lay and dated I
"You'll go a-mollicking with Mary for me,
a-mollicking with Mary etc.
ON A PROFESSOR
Some say that Todd was made by God
But God made Todd in haste;
I think the bloke was just God s joke
—A joke in doubtful taste.


EPIGRAM
The Revolution, how betrayed?
By whom misled, by what dismayed?
What Stalin did and Trotsky said
Beguiles my sabbath ease in bed.
And while the bell from yonder steeple
Doles out opium to the people
'Tis only just that Marx should be
The opium of the bourgeoisie.
HELDENTRAUM 1941
When bombed in England bluff Bob Menzies
gave way to paranoiac frenzies;
and Willkie mid the ruins scenic
raved like a Tory schizophrenic;
the nightingale in Berkeley Square
was really Churchill singing there
epithalamiums to bless
the tryst of Hamilton and Hess,
while ARPies in the branches fluttered,
knowing which side their bread was buttered.
The ghost of Neville Chamberlain
meandered gampless in the rain
towards the Irish House of Commons
(wrecked by the recent British bombin's)
and meeting there Sir Earnest Bevin
who asked about the blitz on Heaven
replied that all God's angels don
their Right-eousness and Carry On;
and other news like this to gladden
the unbombed soul of Artie Fadden.
ON A LADY
Penelope of prudish mien
is fundamentally obscene,
but finds her husband's docile frie/ids
deficient both in means and ends.


SELENE ON LATMOS
Late through the suburbs wandered the blonde moon
With disenchanted gaze a little wild"
And lonely gentlemen most courteously
Saluted her. She only shook her head:
"Ah, not this evening, my dear' : and smiled
But at the silent house she paused and cast
Her brilliant nubile glance within in vain.
The unsleeping figure turned towards the wall
And did not hear the whisper through its pain.
—"Hermes' No. 3, 1038.
JUPITER ON GANYMEDE
Lite through the suburbs wandered the blond loon
with gin-enchanted gait, a little NN ilde;
and lonely gentlemen most courteously
saluted him. He turned his arse which said
"I'd one this evening, my dear": and smiled.
But at the public house he paused and cast
its brilliant nubile glance within in vain.
A female figure turned towards the wall
and did not hear it whisper through the pane.

LAMPOON
Not Looking-Glass Land's Anglo-Saxon Hare
Could strike such poses i' the angled air
As  ---  , who, with his  trouper's repertoire,
Can boast a wardrobeful of attitudes,
Who, if his gallery applaud for more,
Will rant them vast superior platitudes,
And autograph their arses at the door.
