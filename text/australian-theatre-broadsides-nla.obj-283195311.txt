SPECIAL NOTICE
16 North Terrace, Adelaide,
August 29th, 1895.
I have been using the “ Chateau Tanunda Brandy ” for a
considerable time, both in my house and in my professional
work. I have so high an opinion of its value, that I have urged
its introduction into the Adelaide Hospital and other institutions,
in lieu of other kinds at present in use. It is a pure spirit, dis-
tilled from grape juice only, of delicious flavor, and my
of it is due to my knowledge of its purity and of its special ex-“
cellence. I know of no brandy in the market that can equal itj

to the Occasion.
Quite recently an Irishman in Liverpool,
having only a penny, and feeling very
thirsty, was wondering how he would get
a drink. After a minute’s reflection he
entered a public-house with the intent of
asking for a pennyworth of beer. Just as
he went in a man called for a pint of beer,
and, having got it, was about drinking it,
when the Irishman stepped over to him
and said:
“ I’ll bet you a penny, sir, that I d put
that beer into my stomach without letting
it down my throat.”
“ All right ” said the other producing
his penny,
Pat took up the mug and drank the con-
tents at a draught. Then; pushing over
the bets, he said : “ I’ve lost, and you can
have my penny.”— Tit-Bits.

HEALTH NOTES.
The big hit made in the art world of women’s
attire has been the celebrated French PD.
Corsets, which have, since their first intro-
duction to not only Australia but the world at
large, sold enormously in every shop and store
wherever the requirements of the fair sex are
obtainable, by reason of the fact that they have
hit the taste of our sensible women. They
insure health by reason of their scientific
design, and present a stylish appearance by
reason of their faultlessly-artistic make. They
practically mould the form and strengthen the
idy, and, while being the acme of comfort, are
-y durable, r eca ining, in a marked i
*jieir perfect shape to the last.
A well-known lady authority ok alth
matters for women regards the French P.D.
Corset as the pinnacle of real reform in feminine
dress, and as a distinct contributory to an
improved state of health generally.
With the P.D. Corset is found a good figure
and perfectly natural breathing without tight
lacing, and this important point alone can be
described as nothing short of a boon to women
and a distinct advantage to the race.

A knight and a lady once met in a grms.
While each was in quest of a fugitive love;
A river ran mournfully murmuring by, «
And they wept in its waters for sympathy.
“ Oh, never was knight, such a sorrow that
bore,”
“Oh, never was maid so deserted before !"
“ From life and its woes let us instantly fly,
And jump in together for company !** s
They searched for an eddy that suited the
deed,
But here was a bramble, and there waa a
weed;
“ How tiresome it is,” said the pair with a
sigh.
So they sat down to rest them us
company. 3
They gazed on each other, the maid and
the knight ;
How fair was her form and how goodly hi*
height;
“ One mournful embrace,” sobbed the
youth, “ ere we die ! ”
So kissing and crying kept company.
“ Oh, had I but loved such an angel a*
you ! ”
“ Oh, had but my swain been a quarter at
true! ”
“To miss such perfection how blinded
was I; ”
Sure now they were excellent company.

Mr. Thos. Price, M.P.. of South Australia; told this story in a
lecture. During his trip to New Zealand, while the Duke and
Duchess of Cornwall were in that island, he was present when
the Royal party were watching from a bridge the diving of some
Maori boys after silver money, which was thrown into the
stream.
At length the Duchess turned to His Royal Highness and
said, “ Throw a shilling in yourself, George.”
The poor Prince, to the amusement of everybody near, said,
“ I haven’t got a penny, even.”
One of the bystanders, hearing the remark, offered die loan
of the sum, which was accepted and duly passed through the
water to become the property of a tawny juvenile. The lender
refused the tender of a shilling by one of the Royal suite in
payment, remarking that he had loaned the money to the Duke
and would look to His Royal Highness for its return.
In a few days he was the recipient of the customary Royal
" tip,” a pair of gold sleevelinks, and an autographed cabinet

"If I should tell all I know,” said the
detective, with a solemn shake of the head,
"it would create a sensation, and don’t
you forget it.” “If you would refrain from
telling what you don’t know,” returned the
sarcastic man, “it would create even a
greater sensation.”
Baron Dowse, when a counsel, was
asked by a judge: " For whom are you
concerned in this action, Mr. Dowse?”
“ I am concerned, my lord, for the plain-
tiff, but I am engaged for the defendant,”
was the reply of counsel.
"Is my new hat alright?”
“ Yes, dear; you look like a laundress carrying home her

Weeks: “ He’s a marble engraver, and his speciality la

“ Mr. Hall Caine should go for a holiday; he deserves one
and wants it badly,” writes a correspondent of the Free Lance.
"To run a novel like ‘The Eternal City,’ and a play as well, is
to over-strain a delicate I met him in town the
other day, and was struck by his wearied look. Of course, his
naturally ruddy complexion and auburn hair and beard give
him at first sight an air of unusual vigour. But his eyes are
sunken*’and have a sad expression, whilst the thinness of his
physical frame is apparent to a friendly eye. ‘ I feel really
tired for once in my life,’ said he to me in a cheerful tone, that
belied his appearance. © ‘ And the worst of it is I can’t rest just
now ; I have so many engagements to fulfil, a new novel on the
stocks, ray play to fill in, and other things. Besides, I never
really rest; I could not be happy if I did.’ A hard and

THE PROOF OF THE PUDDING IS IN THE EATING.
Now, mark this, Mary, if love’s flame*
Has vanished like a bursted bubble,
Yours is the fault, you are to blame ;
Your cookery has caused he trouble.’
*H)h7 George,’ said Mary, ‘ say not so,’
And here her voice began to soften,
*ls mine the fault? Well, well, you know
1 have tried hard, I have tried often.
* To make light cakes and bread and paste,
But trying always ends in failing,
Constant disaster, loss and waste
Prove all my efforts unavailing. ’
‘ The fault is yours, and yours alone,’
Said George, and here his voice grew louder,
* Nor can I such a fault condone,
You will not use WAUGH'S BAKING
POWDER.
* I’ll try it George ; I will, indeed,
Lest constant broils our hearts should sever.
She tried it, praying to succeed ;
Success at once crowned her endeavour.
No trouble now with cakes or bread.
No fear the pastry is not rising,
No longer sodden lumps of leads,
But viands light and appertising.
And no dark cloud of storm and strife
Now rises o’er the breakfast table.
Mary, a fond, a happy wife,
To cook to George’s taste Is able.
And George, so all his neighbours say,
Of his dear wife grows daily prouder ;
While both for ever bless the day
When first she used WAUGH’S BAKING

Mary’s Trials and Triumph.
Shame on you, George,’ thna spoke hk spouse,
And sad tears with her voiee were blended ;
* This is the way you keep your vows,
And thus your vaunted love has ended.
' Scarcely a year has passed away
Since these your vows of love were spoken,
But vows and promises, they say,
Are made, like piecrust, to be broken.
* Now not one word of love you give,
No smiles, no kisses, or caresses ;
And every weary day I live
Your coldness my poor heart oppresses.’
Mary,’ said George, ‘ yon need not soold;
Stay your reproaches for a season,
may, perhaps, be cross and cold,
But, wife, 1 have sufficient reason.
How do you think that I, whom you
With your vile cookery are killing.
Can smile and kiss, and bill and coo,
When pain through every nerve is thrilling!
Book at the pastry, cakes and bread
You place upon this breakfast table;
Say, to digest such lumps of lead
Is any human stomach able!
You quote a proverb to me, but
About your piecrust ’twas not spoken,
Yours might with axe or saw be out,
But could not, like a vow, be broken.

Be Wise and remember the
aphorism that * The road to a
man’s heart lies through his

imperil your husband’s affec-

Two East-enders were discussing the war news.
" I say, Bill, who’s this ’ere Warren ? ”
“ Why," said the other, “he was a copper once. Charlie
Warren, don’t you remember ? ”
The other reflected for a moment, then he said, medita-
tively:
“He never copped me. Which was his beat ? ”
“Were you really happier before you became civilised ?“
asked the white man.
“ Well,” answered the Pacific Islander, “ I must say i
didn’t have ail this worry about whether my trousers were
getting baggy at the knee.”

A quaint story of a master builder and a British workman is
told by a trade journal. Having heard that the men did not
start work at the proper time the employer thought be, would
drop down about 6.30 one morning and see. Going up die
yard he caught sight of a joiner standing smoking, with his kit
not even opened. Simply asking his name, which he found to
be Malcolm Campbell, he called him into the office, and,
handing him four days’ pay, ordered him to leave at once.
After seeing the man clear of the yard he went up to the
foreman and explained that he had made an example of
Malcolm Campbell by paying him off for not starting at the
proper hour. “ Great Scott, sir!” ejaculated the foreman,
“ that chap was only lookin’ for a job.” ■*’
