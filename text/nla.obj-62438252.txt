? It is necessary, and very interesting to observe, that Colonisation
has a tendency to increase employment for capital and labour at
borne.?When a Hampshire peasant emigrates to Australia, he
very likely enables an operative to live in Lancashire and Yorkshire.
Besides making food in the Colony for himself, he makes some
more to send home for the manufacturer, who, in his turn, makes
clothes or implements for the Colonist.?
EDWARD GIBBON WAKEFIELD.?
? There need be no hesitation in affirming that Colonisation in
the present state of the World, is the very best affair of business
in which the capital of an old and wealthy country can possibly
engage.

TRANSPLANTATION.
Foe a country so great as England is in power and influence
among other nations, the area of land within her own
boundary is small. This land, too, has already been absorbed
by a limited number of proprietors. Whether or not, as
many people think, any reforms in the political and social
system are possible, by which the accumulation and .reten-
tion of land in such few hands could be prevented, it is
not my intention to discuss. On this point one thing is
certain, that whether such changes in the laws of property
can, or cannot be made ?and whether, if they could, they
would be for the benefit of the nation at large, at all events
they will not be effected at present. Whatever the result of
any attempts at such alteration, it must, if ever, be the work
of years and years to accomplish.
Meanwhile we are surrounded by tremendous social diffi-
culties. Population is increasing rapidly, as indeed it ought
to do in every prosperous country. Unhappily pauperism,
too, is increasing quite as rapidly. Crime, the sure attendant
upon wholesale poverty, advances upon us with giant strides.
It even seriously threatens to overthrow the boasted standard
of advanced civilisation, viz., absolute security of person and
property.


A state of chronic misery appears to be the life portion of
large classes of the community. They drag on a wretched
existence of struggling alternation between the insufficient
earnings of occasional employment, and a degrading depend-
ance on the pittance of the Poor-house. Is this a necessary
condition for such multitudes of the wage paid class of the
people of England ? Is it an inevitable decree of Providence
that they should be reduced to a state of such destitution, as
to he a torment to themselves, as well as a burden to their
follow men ? Must we conclude that it is impossible for them,
instead of this life of moral and physical degradation, to
become the possessors of happy homes, which they may have
the power of obtaining by constant, steady, and honest
employment ?
I have said that England has comparatively a small area of
land within her own boundary ; but she has, also, vast tracts
of splendid land, still waste, and unoccupied, in almost every
part of the world. What, then, has this magnificent territory
been given to her for, but to people it ? God has said, ?be
fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.? Can we for
one moment doubt that this Divine Command has an especial
application to England in the present day ?
Taught by the fact, that the British nation possesses
millions of acres of waste land in her Colonies, is it not
abundantly clear to us, that it is our great mission to send out
our people to cultivate them, so that in our hands the Earth
may be replenished, and ? yield her increase.?
It is the strange and unaccountable neglect of our
opportunities for Colonising, which I firmly believe is
one of the most pregnant sources of the various social evils,
by which at home we are surrounded.
In the few words, which I am about to address to my


Countrymen on the subject of Emigration to the British
Colonies, I desire to appeal to their common sense to take
this matter into their most earnest consideration. Let them
view it calmly, and dispassionately, hut comprehensively.
Let them draw their conclusions on its great issues without
prejudice; and in a spirit of humanity, and sympathy with
suffering and destitution. I may also confidently appeal to
self-interest in its favour. While the greatness and glory of
our country would he increased by a thoroughly comprehen-
sive, and properly regulated system of National Emigration,
it would eventually result in a great saving to the tax-payers
themselves. It would relieve them from the cost of main-
taining a constantly increasing number of paupers at home,
and a reduction of their rates would follow.
Lord Overstone is a great authority with all capitalists.
In a recent debate in the House of Lords on the subject of
Emigration, his lordship said that the ? labour fund is our
? national capital, and that we must not part with any of it.?
So that, in fact, there is to be a sort of reservoir of surplus
labour always kept at hand in the country, to be ready for the
fluctuating needs of the capitalist, whenever he requires it.
In other words, this means that certain immense numbers of
artizans and labourers, out of work, as now, are either to be
maintained at the country?s expense, as paupers, or at their
own, in idleness, misery, and want, waiting until there is a
renewed demand for their services to compete with, and press
down the wages of others, who are employed. Against this
hard, this inhuman doctrine, I most earnestly protest. It
may seem correct, according to the harsh and cold ideas of
so called political economists, but it is not the principle to
find favour with human frames of flesh and blood, compelled
to experience the consequences of their cruel conclusions.


But these theorists treat the entire labour question just as
if there was only a certain definite quantity of it ?no more ?
no less, at all times to be found in the country. That it will
never be increased nor diminished. They talk, further, of the
danger of promoting Emigration, for fear of our sending away
? our best artizans.?
Even if this was true, it would but be encouraging a system,
which would at least be in accordance with the common
dictates of humanity. It is only suggested, that those who
cannot find employment at homo, and who desire to go
voluntarily, should be helped to emigrate. It would therefore
benefit the poor artizans themselves.
But are we not constantly adding to the number of our
? best artizans ? with each new generation of the population ;
and are not these ever pressing closely on the heels of the
former one ? Specious as it at first appears, this objection to
the Emigration of the Unemployed for fear of our losingwhat are
called ? our best artizans ? is as groundless as it is preten-
tiously and ignorantly put forward.
Now, let us notice for a moment such facts as these :
? 1868?Births in England and Wales 800,000, deaths 500,000,
increase 300,000. Average annual emigration 50,000. Increase to
population 250,000, equal to that of an ordinary English county, and
requiring 50,000 acres of good wheat land, well cultivated, to supply
these new mouths with bread. ? Times , March 29 ih, 1869.?
Again, let us observe, one of the natural consequences of
persisting in our present narrow and selfish system of keeping
a reserve of surplus labour always among us, which produces
such results as the following:?

Thus we are each year steadily increasing in the amount of
our pauper population. On the Ist of January last we
reached the startling total of 1,089,549. But these fearful
figures do not by any means exhibit a true picture of the
extent of suffering which is being endured by our wage paid
population. Behind this vast army of actual paupers thcie is
nmimkin o+ loocif on (hnma.l nnmbp.v. who. although they have
population. Behind this vast army of actual paupers theio is
probably at least an equal number, who, although they have
not yet swelled its ranks, are fast verging towards it, and who
are enduring in silence and despair an amount, of misery,
privation and want, which makes the philanthropist shudder.
Now I say, such facts as those, coupled with the fluctuations,
which will inevitably occur in the trade of a great commexcial
country, lead irresistibly to the conclusion, that England docs
require a periodical and systematic depletion of a portion of


her population. And do not her vast colonies, studding, as it
were, the whole earth?s surface, point out the exact oppor-
tunities she possesses of putting into practice that depletion
in a wise, sound, and judicious way ?
Emigiation is said to be <e an idea which can only be
? carne d out on a large scale, to be mutually beneficial to all
concerned ; and it also requires the greatest wisdom, discre-
tion, and sound judgment in its mode and manner of
application.? This is most true. It is this reason, therefore,
why I, and those who think with me, advocate its being taken
up by the State, in order that those sound principles,
vhich are necessary to prevent a good work becoming a great
evil, may be adopted by the Government, acting as the agents
for, and the representatives of, the will of the Nation.
I now come to the real difficulty which besets the whole
question. This is the suggestion of any plan by which, if
adopted by the Country, it ought to be carried out. If, how-
ever, the principle of a thing be correct, the fact of there being
any difficulties in the way, provided they are not insuperable,
cannot be any substantial reason against its adoption. They
aie, of course, sure to give the opportunity to unreasonable
and unscrupulous opponents to unite for the purpose of
endeavouring to defeat any, and every scheme which may be
proposed. But they must be grappled with,?and overcome.
That I am an ardent advocate for a thoroughly national
system of Emigration, in preference to all schemes of a more
private, and hence limited character, is simply because I con-
sider, that by the Nation alone it can be effectually and
successfully conducted.. lam far from wishing to underrate
the benevolent efforts of those individuals who charitably aid
in this good work. No doubt they do some, even much good,
to all who are the recipients of their bounty. But, after all,


their efforts are limited, isolated, and spasmodic. They arc
but as ? a drop in the ocean,? as compared with the great,
and comprehensive system which the Nation requires, in order
effectually to relieve it from its constantly increasing
pauperism, and to turn Emigration to profitable account, both
to the Mother Country and to the Colonies.*
In his admirable essay on ?State Emigration,? Mr. Jenkins
says, ? Emigration ought not to he regarded as a scheme for
a philanthropist, it should he the policy of statesmen, not
as a work of charity, but as the business of Government.?
The most formidable difficulty to the encouragement of any
great scheme of Emigration, in the eyes of the British tax-
pay ci, is the cardinal one of expense. Has this heavily
burdened personage ever reflected on the enormous amount he
is already paying, year after year, merely to continue and to
perpetuate pauperism ? Does he reflect that only one year?s
cost of the maintenance of a pauper is sufficient to transplant
him to the Colonies. That this sum would probably trans-
foim him from being an idler and a drone, into a worker and
a producer for the rest of his days ?
Verily, ?we strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.? Last
year we contrived, and without any very serious amount of
giumbling, to pay no less than �8,775,000 sterling for the
Abyssinian war. In round numbers we spent about nine
millions to free a few English captives from the hands of a
barbarous prince. Not one penny of that sum do wo ever
expect to be returned to us. Our only recompense is the
glatitude of some ten or twenty prisoners, and the conviction
that we have vindicated our national honour.
* I hope it will by no means be considered that I would for one moment desire
to advocate any system by which our Colonics would bo ?flooded? with what arc
called our 1 aupers. lam only endeavouring to show that thousands of our
surplus Population, who, if they could be now sent away, would make good
oiomsts, will become Paupers if wo retain them here much longer. Our actual
i aupers, of the real Pauper type, I consider we must continue to keep at home.


Oh ! what would not �9,000,000 spent in Emigration effect
for tens of thousands of our poor suffering Countrymen and
Countrywomen, who are enduring the captivity of a life of help-
less, hopeless misery, and degradation here, and transplanting
them to the new life and happy freedom of a real home in the
Colonies ? The money would he well and cheaply used, if it
were spent for such a purpose. It would redound to England s
honour and power as much as many Abyssinian Expeditions.
But, whereas, in the first case the money has been ail actually
spent, it by no means follows that this is necessary in the
case of funds devoted to Emigration. In spite of Lord
Granville?s recent assertion that ? any project for carrying it
?on by means of loans to intending Emigrants, will disappoint
? the expectations of those who set it on foot, I still maintain,
that by judicious arrangements made between the authorities
in this Country and the Colonies, almost every penny thus
advanced would eventually be repaid with good interest, into
the Imperial Exchequer.
The intending Emigrant need never touch a farthing of the
loan, which is to be advanced for his benefit. It would be
given to him in ? kind,? not in ? specie.? The land which is
presented to him would be chargeable with the entire sum
required, by way of mortgage. This land would become his
own as soon as he had cleared oft this charge upon it, accoid-
ing to certain stipulated conditions. A wise policy would
dictate that these should be made as easy to him as possible.
The more labour he bestows upon the land, the better would
the security become, and the more anxious would the energetic
settler be to clear off the charges upon it, so as to make it
absolutely his own.*
* It is, of course, entirely within the scope of this scheme, that it may he more
desirable not, at first, to put the Emigrant on the Land itself as a proprietor, but to
lot him gain experience bv working for a limited time for wages, before ho attempts
to acquire Land of his own. This is a matter of detail, and merely requires the


Thus I meet the great question of cost involved in a
thoroughly National system of Emigration.
If Government would propose, and Parliament would grant
�10,000,000, if necessary, to he devoted to this purpose, I
submit to the Public either of the following alternatives:
spend it all, as was done in the case of the Abyssinian War,
and it will be cheap to you, for you will save it eventually in
your poor rates; it will repay itself to you tenfold in your in-
creased trade, and the material-prosperity of your Countrymen
abroad. Or else, advance it, as is here suggested, by way of
loan, not actually to, but on account of, intending Emigrants
under proper arrangements, and it will return you every
farthing, principal and interest, in ten years, with all the other
advantages already mentioned besides.
I have boldly proposed a very large sum for Emigration,
I have done so, because, to be successful, it can only be con-
ducted on a large and imperial scale. This must necessarily
involve very considerable cost.
Emigration does not merely mean the bridging over the
space which divides England from her Colonies. It is not
simply a question of providing safe and proper ships, well
found in everything necessary for the comfort of the
Emigrants on the voyage, to carry them across the ocean.
This is by no means the only part, although of course an
indispensable one, of a well organised scheme. It means also
the securing to them the necessaries of life until they have
had time properly to establish themselves in their new home.
This is an essential and integral ingredient of a wise and
sound system of Emigration.
The President of the Poor Law Board, Mr. Goschen, not
adoption of such arrangements as would make it part of a complete, and carefully-
organised, system of Emigration, and need not in any way interfere with the great
principle to be followed, which is, to take the ? People? from where they are
redundant, at home, and plant them �n the Land, where they are wanted, in the
Colonies.


long ago, inquired of a deputation from the ? National Emigra-
tion Aid Society,? whether there was really any considerable
desire on the part of the people to emigrate. In spite of the
evident doubt, implied in putting the question, the answer to
the Right Hon. Gentleman was, that there certainly is. But
how can they go without means ? If, too, the whole question
was really understood by the Public, there would be ten times
more desire manifested to emigrate than there is. The true cause
for any apparent hesitation on the part of the poor to do so, simply
arises from their dread of being deceived, and their ignorance of
its real benefits to them. Hitherto they have been asked to ?take
?a leap in the dark.? At most, they are, perhaps provided with
passages to a new and unknown laud. On their arrival they
are put on shore to shift for themselves, feeling strange and
friendless, with no hand to help, advise, and care for them.
Is it therefore surprising, that multitudes who would make
excellent Colonists, fear to encounter such difficulties on their
first introduction to a new country ?
Let us take the case of transplanting a tree or shrub from
the forest to the garden. Are we content merely to arrange for
its safe conveyance from the one to the other ? Do we not
also carefully protect it, and attend to it, sheltering and
guarding it equally from sun, and wind, and cold, until it has
firmly taken root in its new soil ? Exactly so ought we to
care for, and attend to, the wants of a new settler in a Colony,
guiding, teaching, and helping him, until he also has taken
root there. Emigration in a word is Transplantation !
The illustration I have given of the Forest Tree suggests
also that probably many a wild denizen in the homo wilderness
may become cultivated and civilised by transplantation to
the Colonies, under the benign influences of opportunities
for the free and healthy development of energies, which
arc cramped, and crushed, and crippled here.


To carry out a scheme so broad and complete in its details,
requires a staff of thoroughly qualified Colonial, as well as
home agencies. Hence large funds arc necessary to develope
and maintain it.
Let us look at what European emigration has done, and is
doing for the United States of America.* Their Government
at least is fully alive to its importance, and is doing all it can
to encourage and promote it to their own vast waste lands.
It is one of the most important points in connection with
this subject, that we ought to use every exertion to turn
the valuable stream of our emigrating population from flow-
ing into a foreign country. Instead of allowing it to drift
away from us, owing to our carelessness, indifference, and
neglect, it is the duty of a paternal Government, by judicious
care and reasonable encouragement, to direct it towards our
own Colonies.f
I have now sketched the outline of a great work. I have
pointed out the idea of the principle to be followed. By a
Government in earnest, and a Nation persuaded of the
necessity of undertaking it, the details can be completed.
England ought to bo an active Colonising Country?Why is
she not? The State should take this grand task in hand?Why
does it hang back ? The noble secretary for the Colonies ?
Lord Granville ?in a recent letter, addressed to his Grace the
* Emigration to the United States. ?? Tlie United States Bureau of
Statistics reports that in 13 years, ending with 1868, over two millions and a half
of Europeans emigrated to that country, the greater number coming from the British
Isles, as is still the case. Great as is the German influx, it is surpassed by that of the
English-speaking population, which in this year, up to the month of June, exceeded
54,000 heads, while the German only reached 47,000.? ? Times , July 12th, 1869.
f I assume that there must be perfect harmony of action between the Home and
the Colonial Governments. Both the Mother Country and the Colonies must be
prompted by the broadest, and most liberal and enlightened, principles, in a matter
so vitally affecting their highest interests. They must work earnestly together for
the promotion of the one grand object, which, properly carried out, will be for their
mutual incalculable benefit and advantage.


Duke of Manchester, as President of the. National Emigration
Aid Society, says ? that he is fully alive to the advantages of
? well considered, and well conducted Emigration.? This is
indeed a most important admission on the part of the
Government. I ask no more than that his Lordship ? may
? take the whole subject of Emigration to the British Colonies
? into his immediate consideration, in order that some well
? considered scheme may be devised by her Majesty?s Govern-
? ment, in co-operation with the Colonial Governments, without
? delay.?
But. notwithstanding all their favourable expressions, wo
know fully well that the Government will not stir one step of
themselves in the matter. It requires to be strongly support-
ed by public opinion, and then they will take it up in earnest,
and it will be done.
What is wanted is, to organise a permanent system of
National Emigration. It must be conducted with Government
resources, on Government responsibility, and under Govern-
ment control. It is great enough to demand a special depart-
ment of the Executive, and a responsible Minister of the Crown
for its management.*
Such a system only, will fulfil the conditions of being one
of a wise, sound, and thoroughly comprehensive character.
When once they are made fully alive to its vital importance
to themselves, no other will satisfy the just wants and wishes
of the people. It will prove an inestimable blessing to
thousands of our suffering fellow-countrymen, whose wretched-
ness is deepening into despair. It will redound to the present
* This suggestion is made in order that equal dignity may be given to the
proposed Department, as it would be equal in importance to the other highest offices
of the State. Any apparent advantages resulting from the appointment, instead, of
a permanent Commissioner entirely unconnected with English Party Politics, would
be more than balanced by the greater dignity attaching to an office which would be
held by a Cabinet Minister, who must in the long run, though changing with Party,
really reflect the wishes of the Nation.


advantage, and future welfare of England. If will relieve her
of an immense amount of her distressed and unemployed
population, which is fast verging towards, though as yet not
actually engulfed in pauperism. It will help to rescue them
from a life of misery, to become happy and independent in
the various Colonies of the British Empire.
