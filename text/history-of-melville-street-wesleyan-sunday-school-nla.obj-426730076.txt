THE DIAMOND JUBILEE CELEBRATION.
SXJIsro.A.'Z- SEBYIOBS.
It is some years since the Melville-street
Wesleyan Church, Hobart, was so hand-
somely decorated as it is for the cele-
bration of the 75th, or diamond, anni-
versary of the Church’s Sunday-school,
which commenced on Sunday, May 10, 1896.
From the pretty little bower in the
vestibule to the most effective treatment
of the pulpit, and the organ front, nothing
could have been in better taste, or more
delightful to look upon. The work was
done by a number of willing hands under
the direction of Mr. W. M. Williams. The
three services yesterday were specially
identified with the anniversary, and the
church was crowded to the doors at each.
The Rev. F. J. Nance, M.A., preached
morning and evening, the congregation
including many people from other churches.
In the afternoon the children’s service
was held. Such a large assembly of Sunday-
school scholars presented an animating
appearance. There were present 330 scholars
belonging to Melville-street Sunday-school
alone, with 41 teachers, the superintendents
being Mr. W. F. Brownell and Mr. W. M.
Williams. (Mr. A. F. Strutt discharges the
duties of hon. sec,, and Mr. G. T. Taylor
those of hon. treasurer.) Added to these
came the scholars of other Methodist Sunday-
schools of the city, together with repre-
sentatives of other denominations, till the
whole interior of the church, including its
spacious galleries were crammed. The Rev.
S. Cuthbert conducted the service, which
was a most hearty one. His address was
based on the words—“ Know thou the God
of thy Fathers,” and was an ably thought-
out discourse. The Wesleyan Church prides
itself in being a singing church, and the
singing of the choir under the conductor-
ship of Mr.J, B. Overall was admirable. Old
hymn tunes were used, and they certainly
seemed to be much more appreciated than
new tunes are when got up for the occasion.
Mr. E. Turner very efficiently presided
at the organ.
TEA MEETING.
A tea and public meeting was held on
Monday evening. May 11, in the school-
room. About 300 persons sat down to tea.
The tables were laid out by the lady teachers
of the Sunday-school, and the decorations
of the room were executed by the Social
Committee of the Christian Endeavour
Society, who also presented the teachers
with buttonhole bouquets, and with sprays
of flowers.
Mr. W. F. Brownell, senior superinten-
dent of the Sunday-school, presided at the
public meeting. Amongst those on the platform
were the Revs. Wm. Shaw, S. Cuthbert, D.
B. Bridgwood, and S. Ironside, Wesleyan
ministers ; the Revs. R. A. Thompson and
I. Herford, Congregational ministers; Rev.
J. H. Dawe, Primitive Methodist minister;
Messrs. W. M. Williams, superintendent of
the Sunday-school ; G. T. Taylor, treasurer ;
E. Hawson, superintendent of the Davey-
street Wesleyan Sunday-school; G. W. Ife,
superintendent of the High-street Wesleyan
Sunday-school ; and A. B. Robinson, super-
intendent of the Union Chapel Sunday-
school.
Apologies for absence were announced
from the Rev. J. Cope, the Rev. Mr.
Rickard, the Rev. Mr. Moorhead, Mr. C. E,
Walch, Mr. White, Rev. J. W. Simmons,
Rev. G. W. Sharp, and the Rev. C. U.
Talbot. It was mentioned, however, that
the Revs. C. H. Talbot and G. W. Sharp
had been present at the tea meeting.
The Chairman, before reading the re-
port of the school for the past 75 years,
mentioned with pleasure that he was present
at the golden jubilee celebration of the
Sunday-school 25 years ago, and pre-
sented the jubilee report on that occasion.
The report which was read was of a historical
character, and frequently interrupted by ap-
plause.
REPORT.
75th Annual, or Diamond, Anniversary
Report of the Melville-street Wesleyan
Sabbath-school
If it were with no ordinary feelings of
interest the Jubilee Report of our Sabbath-
schools was presented in 1871, with how much
accentuated interest do we now submit our
report, after the lapse of another quarter of a
century, bringing us to the 75th, or Diamond,
Anniversary, an event we believe to be unique
in the Australian colonies. We think it
probable that one school at least in Sydney
may be as old, or even a little older, than
ours, but we have never heard of any
celebration in connection with the event. Bq
3.0-1* -n


that as it may, it is an event so rare, and the
interests involved are so great, that we think
it worthy of all the prominence we give it on
the present occasion. The report of 1871
necessarily contained the early history of our
schools, but as many items of interest have
since come to hand, it will be necessary, to
some extent at least, to review from the
earliest period, and present, as far as possible
within our necessarily brief limits, a con-
secutive his'ory.
It must be remembered that the period
from which our history dates was 16 or
17 years from the time when the first
attempt to colonise Van Diemen’s Land
began. It was in the month of Jane or
July, 1803, that Lieut. Bowen, with a small
party of soldiers and prisoners, arrived in the
Derwent in the colonial brig Lady Nelson.
They disembarked at Restdown or Risdon, as
it is now called. The prisoners sent were
some of the worst that Botany Bay could
produce. In January or February of 1804
the Ocean and Lady Nelson arrived, with
Colonel Collins and his party of prisoners
and others, from Port Phillip, where he
had failed to establish a penal settle-
ment. From this unpromising nucleus
of a population the colonisation of Van
Diemen’s Land took its rise. The interven-
ing 17 years was a dark period in the history
of our colony. The moral degradation of the
people is represented by historians as some-
thing most dep’orable. There were no Sab-
bath-schools or regular preaching places. It
is true that service was occasionally per-
formed under the verandah of Government
House (a wooden building in Barrack-square),
weather permitting, or in the King's store,
presumably by the Rev. Mr, Knopwood,
Colonial Chaplain, otherwise we should have
no record of anything like a regular religious
service or of a suitable place in which to hold
one. The Rev. B. Carvosso, Wesleyan
minister, arrived in his ship on the way to
Sydney in August, 1820; he was the first Wes-
leyan minister to deliver an open-air discourse
in Van Diemen’s Land. Standing upon the
steps of the Court-house, he commenced by
giving out one of Wesley’s hymns, his wife
leading off the singing. The text was from
Ephesians “ Wherefore he saith, awake
thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead,
and Christ shall give thee light.”
The first attempt to establish a Wesleyan
Church and Sabbath-school in Hobart was
made by Mr. Benjamin Nokes, of whose pre-
vious and subsequent history we have no
account. He says that, being affected by the
low moral condition of the people, and the
absence of the means ot grace, he went round
the town in October, 1820, to call upon per-
sons of his acquaintance, to induce them to
meet at his house in Collins-street for the
purpose of holding a prayer meeting. Eight
persons responded to his invitation. In the
following month (November) he obtained
permission of a Mr. Wallis, in Liverpool-
street, to meet in his house, but here they
were not permitted to worship peaceably,
being assailed by the mob with stones, bricks,
and other missiles.
A class was formed for Church member-
ship, and seven united themselves in Christian
fellowship. The congregation rapidly in-
creased, notwithstanding the persecution to
which they were subjected,and the room soon
became too small to accommodate all who
assembled.
In the year 1821 there were 14 Church
members, and the congregation numbered
100. A larger place was required, and this
was supplied by Mr. Donn, who kindly lent
his carpenter’s shop, situated in Argyle-
street, adjoining the Bird-in-hand Hotel.
Here, too, the worshippers were not per-
mitted to assemble in peace, being annoyed
by a noisy mob, who assailed them with
stones and other missiles. Such was the
violence it was thought the building would
be forced in. Things were becoming so
serious that Mr. Nokes had to toll the
disturbers that unless they desisted he would
appeal to His Honor Governor Sorell for
protection. This had the desired eff <ct, and
from this time they were not molested.
The number of members and hearers still
continued to increase. Mr. Donn yielded to
the request to enlarge his building so that it
would accommodate 300 people. It was then
decided to establish a Sunday-school, but no
books being available in Hobart Town appli-
cation was made to Sydney, when a collection
of hymn-books, spelling-books, and cate-
chisms were sent. So soon as these arrived
an advertisement was inserted in the
Hobart Town Gazette that a Sunday-school
would be opened on the 13th of May, 1821.
At the opening of the school there were 23
scholars, Mr. Robert Household and Mr.
John Hiddlestone being appointed superin-
tendents.
In August, 1821, the Buxton, Captain
Lusk, arrived, bringing the Revs. Messrs.
Leigh, Walker, and Horton, en route for New
Zealand, when it was determined that the
Rev. Wm. Horton should remain in Hobart
Town. During Mr. Horton’s time the chapel
in Melville-street was commenced, not com-
pleted until 1825. The pioneers were not
content with confining their operations to
one school or one locality; they were con-
stantly on the alert for new openings, and
endeavoured, as far as possible, to extend the
sphere of their operations. The first addi-
tional school opened was among the prisoners
in the penitentiary. The next was at Kanga-
roo Point. Unfortunately, the first minute
books cannot now be found, but there can
be no doubt the schools were regularly
supervised by the committee and teachers
meetings From the minutes of district meeting
held in Sydney (then the head of the circuit)
on December 2, 1822, it was reported that in
Hobart Town there were two schools : one in
Argyle-street with 50 scholars, and one at
Kangaroo Point with 10 We also know from
our own records that there was one in the
Penitentiary with an attendance of 23. From
the same report we learn that Hobart Town
is a growing, thriving town ; that there has
been a large influx of pious, respectable
people, emigrants, and they recommend that
two ministers should be stationed there. It
also speaks of the respect in which our church
and school work is held by His Honor the
Lieut.-Governor, the Penitentiary officers,
magistrates, and others. Also that the
Colonial Chaplain, Rev. R. Knopwood, who
at first exhibited hostility to our work, had

become friendly, ahd was now working
amicably with us. On May 6, 1823, we have
the first record of committee meeting, and it
may be interesting to know the names of
those who were present and took part in it.
The Rev. Wm. Horton, Mr. Hy. Hopkins,
Mr. John Hiddlestone, Captain Wm. Kneale,
Mr. Wm. Shoobridge, Mr. Emanuel Wellard,
Mr. Isaac Chapman, and Mr. Robt. House-
hold. Messrs. Hiddlestone and Household
were appointed joint superintendents, and
Rev. Wm. Horton treasurer.
The next meeting was held on October 2,
the Rev, Ralph Mansfield in the chair, he
having arrived to take the place of the Rev.
Wtn. Horton. At this meeting the name of
Mr. John Barrett appears as being present.
The committee not being satisfied with the
attendance, in December of 1823 organised a
canvass of the town for scholars, which re-
sulted in the addition of 39 to their roll. The
next item of interest we notice is that the
Lieut.-Governor, pleased with our work in
the Penitentiary, had voluntarily offered to
defray the expenses connected with the
school out of the Police Fund.
1824.—Early in this year our schools were
federated in a regular constitution, denomi-
nated “The Wesleyan Hobart Town
Sunday-school Union,” A complete code of
rules was drawn up, the particulars of which
are recorded in the minute-book. This con-
stitution, or union, embraced all the schools
then in existence, and all the schools subse-
quently formed, whether in town or country,
up to the year 1885.
We find at this early period the committee
were exact in maintaining discipline, and
various penal laws or rules were exacted for
maintaining order and regularity on the
part of both teachers and scholars, non-
attendance on the part of the latter
for more than four Sundays being
punished with expulsion. The anniversary
services were regularly held on Whitsunday,
and from the earliest period in our school
history the greatest enthusiasm was thrown
into these services, the most distinguished
ministers available being procured to preach
the sermons, and the best men, socially, to be
chairmen and speakers at the public meet-
ings. At the committee meeting held May 11,
1824, it was reported that Geo. Espie, Esq.,
had made a presentation'of a large and valu-
able collection of books.
In July, 1824, it was resolved to open a
school in Liverpool-street in the house of Mr,
McDougall. At this period there were five
schools under the care of the committee :
Argyle-street, Liverpool-street, Kangaroo
Point, Sandy Bay, and Penitentiary. It was
also resolved to open a school at O’Brien’s
Bridge under the charge of Mr John Barrett
and Mr. Skinner.
1825.—1 n March of this year the Liverpool-
street school had to be given up in conse-
quence of the room in which it was held be-
ing required by the owner. Another room
was immediately found in Harrington-
street close by. Into this the Liverpool-
street school was transferred. In the course
of a few months this school outgrew the
parent school in Argyle-street. In May of
this year the Rev. B. Carvosso arrived fn
succession to Rev. R. Mansfield. Mr.
Carvosso, from the commencement of . his
ministry, took a deep interest in the Sabbath-
schools, often taking scholars into the vestry
for the purpose of conversing with and
questioning them, he believing it to be of the
utmost importance to give his attention to
those families that were growing up in con-
nexion with the Church. At a meeting held
November 8, 1825, it was stated that the new
chapel in Melville-street (that is, the present
school, called the Mechanics’-institute) would
be ready for occupation during the present
month, when it was resolved to unite the
two town schools in one at the new chapel
on the following Sunday fortnight.
1826. —At a meeting held in March 14 of this
year the name of Mr. Thomas James Crouch
appears as being received as a teacher.
Special mention of his name is made here,
because of the many years of active and
honourable service he,"in subsequent years,
rendered our Sunday-school cause. We shall
probably have occasion to refer again to his
name at a later stage of the report.
In 1827 schools were commenced in Laun-
ceston and Green Ponds, books for which
were sent from the Hobart Town schools.
During this year the first Union meeting is
recorded, the Rev. Mr. McArthur, Presby-
terian minister, with his teachers and
scholars, joining our schools in a demonstra-
tion in the Domain, or Government paddock,
as it was then called.
1828.—1 t was in this year that Governor
Arthur, in recognition of the important ser-
vices rendered the colony by our church and
school operations, gave a grant of land, which
was subsequently sold and land purchased
with the proceeds in Melville-street, on which
our present church stands.
1829 and ’3o.—At this time Mr. S. B.
Dowsett was co-superintendent with Mr.
Hiddlestone.
1830. During this year the Rev. J.
Hutchinson arrived to take charge of the
circuit. Nothing of importance is recorded
except that the school, which had been closed
at Sandy Bay, was re-opened.
1831. —A room was rented near the corner
of Liverpool and Harrington streets, and a
school opened. During this year the Rev.
Nathaniel Turner arrived, and preached the
anniversary sermons. Mr. John Hiddlestone
is now mentioned as Superintendent of
Melville-street school in conjunction with
Mr. Thos. Jas. Crouch. Mr. Hy. Chapman
was requested to teach the children singing
for the coming anniversary, a duty he dis-
charged for a great many years.
1833. This year Alfred B. Biggs was
introduced to the school as a scholar by Field
and Hugh Barrett. Mr. Biggs at the present
time holds a responsible position in the Sav-
ings Bank in Launceston. Mr. Abraham Biggs,
father of the above, was an early worker in
the church and school. In June of this
year Mr. H. S. Hurst was appointed general
secretary. Mr. Richard Brown was ap-
pointed superintendent of Warwick-street
school, and Mr. D. McArthur secretary.
Mr. R. Brown was subsequently appointed to
other schools in the Union, and was for many
years one of the standard bearers of the
church,
1834. Mr. Wm. Gellibrand, who had taken


an active part in the establishment of our
schools, was asked to preside at the annual
meeting. During this year land was pur-
chased in High-street for a Sunday-school ;
amongst the trustees the names are found of
Wm. Gellibrand, J oseph Tice Gellibrand.Th os.
Horne, etc.; the latter subsequently became
one of the Judges of the Supreme Court.
Amongst the ministers this year appear the
names of the Rev. J. A. Manton and the
Rev. Wm. Butters, both of whom subse-
quently did effective work in connection with
our Church in Van Diemen’s Land and else-
where. At a committee meeting, held August
27, authority was given to select a room in
Macquarie or Davey streets in which to
establish a school. Nothing of special im-
portance is recorded during 1835, but schools
had been opened in Argyle-street, Patrick,
and Macquarie streets. In 1836 a school was
established at Roseneath. During this year a
missionary ship arrived from England with
several missionaries on board. It was re-
solved to hold the anniversary at Easter in-
stead of Whitsuntide, so as to get the new
arrivals to take the services. Amongst those
who arrived were the Rev. Mr. Draper, Rev.
J. McKinney, Rev. Mr. Burke, the Rev. Mr.
Lewis, the Rev. Mr. Spinney, etc.
1837. Mr. John Hiddlestone, who had
been superintendent for about 16 years,
complained of inability to continue the
work alone. Mr. Chas. Williams was ap-
pointed to assist him. During this year Mr.
and Mrs. William Witt were admitted as
teachers. Mr. Witt is still with us, and our
school records show that he has rendered im-
portant service. During this year also the
foundation-stone of the Centenary Church
was laid by Sir John Franklin, the builder
being Mr. H. Chapman. The church was
opened for worship in 1840.
1838. In this year the Rev. Mr. Long-
bottom and the Rev. Mr. Simpson preached
the anniversary sermons. The Rev. Wm.
Butters and the Rev. Mr. Sutch’s names are
also recorded as being present at a committee
meeting. In the year following, 1839, we
have the names of the Rev. John Egglestone,
the Rev. John Waterhouse, and the Rev.
Joseph Orton, all of whom took an active
part in promoting the success of our schools
and Church, their names being as familiar as
household words, even to the present day.
It was in this year the late Mr. Josias Hey-
ward joined our school as a teacher, and for
many years continued to do effective work as
a teacher and local preacher, and it is with
pleasure we here record the fact that his son,
the Rev. G. T, Heyward, takes a part in
celebrating this, the Diamond, Anniversary
of our school. This year Mr, Chas, Williams
was appointed second superintendent of
Melville-street, Mr. William Pratt superin-
tendent of Sandy Bay, Mr. Adkins superin-
tendent of High-street, Mr. Thos. Whitney
superintendent of Davey-street, and Mr.
Stebbings superintendent of the O’Brien’s
Bridge School.
1839. In April of this year Mr. Jesse
Pullen was appointed superintendent of
Brown’s River school, and Mr, Geo. Pullen
secretary. Mr. Jesse Pullen was for a long
series of years associated with our church
and school work. Mr. Geo. Pullen now
resides near Launceston. Mr. Pullen has
sent a very interesting paper on the early
work of our church and schools in Hobart
Town, which want of space alone prevents
us from publishing in this report. Mr.
Pullen became a scholar in the school in
1828. During this year Mr. W. Witt was
appointed superintendent of Melville-street
in conjunction with Mr. Hiddlestone, a post
he continued to fill for about five years.
Mr. R. Shoobridge took the charge of High-
street school. Tima does not permit to
refer in detail to the many honoured names
found in our school rolls, but we purpose
affixing an honour list of those who have been
connected with our school as an addenda
to this report. It may be well, however, to
mention the names of the various superin-
tendents, without whom this history would
hardly seem to be complete. The schools
continued to carry on their work with energy
and success.
IS4O.—Mr. Wm. Nichol, who had been
teacher in Melville-street. was appointed
joint superintendent with Mr. Whitney in
the Davey-street school. Mr. J. Hole was also
appointed to the High-street school in con-
junction with Mr. Shoobridge, Mr. W. F.
Jackson taking the charge of the O’Brien’s
Bridge school. This year Mr. Florence
Gardiner was received as a teacher in
Melville-street school. Mr. Richard Shoo-
bridge was appointed superintendent of
Harrington-stroet school. Mr. Shoobridge
during a long life devoted himself to our
church and schools. About this time Mr.
G. S. Crouch was brought by his father
(Mr. Thomas James Crouch) as a scholar
to Melville'street school, Mr, G. S. Crouch
is present with us at the Diamond Anniver-
sary celebration,
1841, —This year Mr. Thomas James Crouch
took charge of High-street, and Mr. William
Barnett was appointed secretary. Miss Julia
Burgess was received as a teacher in Mel-
ville-street. Mrs. H. S. Barrett, formerly
Miss Burgess, is with us at this Anniversary.
1843.—This year a school was opened at
Jerusalem by Mr. A. Biggs, school requisites
being supplied from the Hobart Town
committee. Mr. John Hiddlestone resigned
his position of superintendent, having dis-
charged the duties of this office since 1821,
a period of 23 years. Mr. Henry Dickenson
was appointed to the office vacated by Mr.
Hiddlestone. Mr. Dickenson continued in
charge of the school only one year, when he
left the colony; his place was supplied by Mr.
Henry Marsh, father of Mr. H. J. Marsh,
who is still with us.
1844.—0 n April 12 of that year, Mr. John
Harcourt was appointed general secretary, a
position he continued to fill for two years.
In 1847 Mr. W. F. Brownell was received as
a junior teacher in the north district school,
then held in Argyle-street. The Rev. John
Egglestone and the Rev. Jonathan Innes
now came into the circuit, relieving the
Rev. J. A. Manton on December 21, 1849.
The following record appears on the minute
book—“ Resolved that the following persons
be appointed teachers in the Melville-street
school: Samuel Marsh, Thomas Crisp, James
Crisp, Thomas Ball, Hugh Barrett, H. V.
Chapman, junr,, and Miss Frances Preston,”


1850-1852.
MR. ALEX. ERASER,
MR. Til OS. WHITNEY,
1852-1854.
MR. EL S. BARRETT,
1854-1871.


Mr. James Crisp subsequently became a
minister in our church; he is now stationed
at Coburg, in Victoria, and is on the list of
ex-vice presidents of the Victorian and Tas-
manian conference. After a lapse of three
years, in 1848 Mr. Dickenson returned to the
colony and was appointed co-superintendent
with Mr. Marsh, Mr. H. J. Marsh being ap-
pointed secretary. This arrangement lasted
only one year, when Mr. H. Marsh re-
tired, his place being supplied by Mr. A.
McDougall. In 1850 Mr, Alexander Fraser
and Mr. R. S. Waterhouse were appointed
superintendents; Mr. H. S. Barrett was
selected as superintendent of Davey-street
school, also elected general secretary, Mr.
S. B. Mather was i ppointed to the north
district school, with Mr. W. F. Brownell as
secretary, the Rev. ET. H. Gaud being at
this time minister in the circuit. The years
1851 and 1852 were trying times for our
schools, the diggings in Victoria having been
discovered the people flocked to that colony,
many of our teachers and others in our church
going there in search of gold. The effect of
this was immediately felt in the Harrington-
street school, which had to be closed for
want of teachers; the scholars, however, were
not lost, they being drafted to Melville-street
and High-street schools. Mr. John Rothwell
was the superintendent in charge of the
Harrington-street school at the time. In
1852 the Rev. T. B. Harris was in charge of
the circuit. Mr. Fraser resigned, and Mr.
1 hos. Whitney was appointed to the charge
of the boys’ school, Mr. R. S. Waterhouse re-
taining the girls. In 1853 the Rev, J.
A , Manton established a preparatory
class for the teachers, meeting them once a
week in the lower schoolroom; these were
well attended and proved a great help to
many who otherwise would have been less
perfectly fitted to engage in the work of
teaching. During the ministry of Mr.
Manton and the Rev. John Egglestone num-
bers of young people were brought into church
relationship, many of whom now, in the
winter of life in this and the adjoining
colonies, are still doing good service for the
Master.
In 1854 Mr. R. S. Waterhouse resigned the
superintendency of the school, Mr. Thomas
Whitney taking the sole charge, this position,
however, he resigned two months after. Mr.
H. S. Barrett was then appointed to be the
superintendent, the post vacated by him in
Davey-street being filled by the appointment
of Mr. R. S. Waterhouse.
1855.—The Rev. Matthew Andrew succeeded
Mr, Manton, a preacher of extraordinary
power ; many were brought in under his
ministry. Mr. Andrew remained only a
short time in the circuit, and he was suc-
ceeded by the Rev. John Cope, who had just
arrived from England, and took charge of the
circuit for one year. About this lime Mr.
H. 8. Barrett i esigned the post of general
secretary, and Mr. Josiah C. Pratt was ap-
pointed. Mr. Pratt’s father, the late Mr.
Wm. Pratt, was for many years a teacher in
the school.
In 1856 Mr. R. S. Waterhouse resigned the
charge of Davey-street school, his place
b eing supplied by Mr, F. Stanfield,
The Rev. Francis Tuckfield then came to
Hobart with the Rev. J. B. Smith, as second
preacher. These ministers remained in the
circuit until 1858, during which time the
schools made steady progress, but nothing of
note or change in the management of the
schools occurred. Early in 1858 the Rev.
John Cope returned to Hobart Town with
the Rev. W. D. Lelean as second preacher, and
these ministers were invited to preach the
anniversary sermons in April of that year.
Mr. Cope met the committee on May 4, and
urged the necessity of a regular and sys-
tematic course of instruction in our schools.
This resulted in the introduction of the
Memphris and Baker systems of lessons. Mr.
Cope also organised a special preparatory
meeting once a week for the teachers, over
which he presided, the good effects of which
were soon apparent. Mr. Cope and Mr.
Lelean continued in the circuit until March,
1861, when they were succeeded by the Rev.
P. W. Lowe and the Rev. Joseph Fillingham.
During this year the S.S. Committee re-
ceived a legacy of £lOO, left by the late John
Dunn, Esq , a gentleman who had been for
many years connected with our Church and
schools. The sum was lent to the trustees of
ihe Church at 6 per cent., and subse-
quently used in making the alterations in the
schoolroom in 1872. On April 21, 1862, Mr. F*
Stanfield was appointed general secretary vice
Mr. Josiah C. Pratt resigned. On January
3rd of this year Mr. W. F. Brownell was ap-
pointed superintendent of Harrington-street
school, taking the place of Mr W. W. White,
resigned. This school was in a moribund con-
dition at the time, and a sub-committee was
appointed to report upon it, and upon their
recommendation it was closed, Mr. Brownell
joining the Melville-street school as teacher.
1863. The Rev. Spencer Williams arrived
this year, joining the Rev. W. Lowe.
Shortly after the arrival of Rev. S. Williams
a mutual improvement class was inaugurated,
which developed into the Wesleyan Christian
Association, which soon acquired a roll of
150 members ; this association was presided
over by the Rev. S. Williams, who continued
to throw the greatest interest into it during
his ministerial residence here.
1864. During this year special services v ere
conducted by Mr. Williams, which resulted
in the addition of nearly 50 members being
added to the Church from the three schools
then in existence, Melville-street, Davey-
street, and High-street.
The Rev. J. Hutchison came to Hobart
this year in the place of Rev. W. Lowe.
1865. —From this period Mr. W. F. Brownell’s
name appears as general secretary. Mr. W.
Fordham was appointed to be superinten-
dent of Davey-street school in the place of
Mr. F. Stanfield resigned, he leaving Hobart
Town for Launceston. During this year Mr.
J. Blundstone was appointed school visitor, a
position he continued to fill for several years.
He subsequently was secretary to the school
for a considerable time. In these and other
depaitments of Church work he rendered
important services for a long series of years,
1866. The Rev. Nathaniel Bennett joined
the Rev. J. Hutchison, the Rev. S. Williams
having been three years in the circuit. At a
meeting of the committee, held on February
19, 1867, Mr. W. F. Brownell was appointed


superintendent of Melville-street school in
conjunction with Mr. H. S. Barrett. During
this year Rev. E, W. Nye came into the
Hobart Town circuit. The Rev. S. Ironside
also came to Hobart Town in 1867. During
this year Mr. Richard Smith was appointed
superintendent of Davey-street school in the
place of Mr. W. Fordham resigned, Mr.
Wm. Smith being school visitor. On Feb-
ruary 9 of this year Mr. W. F. Jackson was
appointed superintendent of High street
school in conjunction with Mr. S. B. Mather.
Mr. Jackson was for many years actively
engaged in Sabbath school and other benevo-
lent and philanthropic work, in which he
was ably assisted by his late wife, Mrs.
Margaret Jackson, who for many years
rendered most valuable services as a teacher
in the Melville-street and other schools.
Many of those now in connection with our
Church were led to decision for Christ by
Mrs. Jackson’s godly precepts and life. We
may also here mention that Mr. W. F,
Jackson, sen., though not connected with the
town schools, rendered most able services
from a very early period in our church
history as a superintendent, local preacher,
etc., in the O’Brien’s Bridge and other
country districts.
1868. At a committee meeting, held Sep-
tember 25, 1868, it was reported that the
Davey-street school had so increased in num-
bers that the schoolroom was quite inadequate
for teaching so many, urging the trustees to
take the matter into their serious consideration.
This led to a special meeting being called,
resulting in building the present church, Mr,
Thos. Jas. Crouch, jun.,of Melbourne, being
the architect. Mr. Crouch was formerly a
scholar in Melville-street school. At this
time the Rev. S. Ironside and Rev. Nathaniel
Bennett were the ministers in Hobart Town.
1869. —This year the Rev. Hans Mack
came to Hobart Town, and remained the
usual term of three years. On the 19th May
Mr. and Mrs. Reilly retired from school
work, on which occasion a cordial vote of
thanks was accorded them by the committee.
On Septembers, 1869, Mr. Edward Hawson
was appointed superintendent of Davey-
street school, supplying the place vacated by
Mr, R. Smith. Mr. Hawson still con-
tinues in the position assigned to him in 1869.
1870. In this year we find the name of the
Rev. Jas. Graham as one of the ministers,
1871. —This year our school minute-book
records the death of Mr. H. S. Barrett, one
of the superintendents of the Melville-street
school. He had been a severe sufferer for
many months previous to his death, and
passed away on January 26, having been
superintendent from April 21, 1854—a period
of 17 years. At a meeting of the committee,
held on August 3, it was resolved to erect a
tablet to the memory of Mr. Barrett in the
Melville-street Church ; the Rev. H. Mack,
with Messrs. C. D. Haywood, W. F. Jack-
son, and W, F. Brownell, being appointed
a sub-committee to carry out the project.
Arrangements were made early in this year
to celebrate the Jubilee, when a determined
effort was made to raise the sum of £3OO, in
order to improve the school premises, etc.
The Jubilee sermons were preached by Rev,
i\, Bennett on Easter Sunday.
On the following day there was a tea
meeting in the evening, after which a public
meeting was held in the church, presided
over by Rev. H. Mack, superintendent of
the circuit. On the platform there were
the Rev. N, Bennett, Rev. W. C. Robin-
son, Rev. J. W, Simmons, Rev. J. Lang-
ford, Messrs. L. Lodge, T. J. Crouch,
the Hon. W. L. Orowther and Mr. W.
F. Brownell, the general secretary. After the
reading of the report by the general secretary,
several resolutions were submitted and
spoken to by occupants of the platform,
the whole proceedings being characterised by
the greatest enthusiasm.
During the year the Rev. C. A. Ogilvie
came into the circuit as second minister.
1872. Early in this year the committee
received intimation that the Mechanics’-
institute, previously let on lease, had come
into the hands of the trustees. Correspondence
was opened up with the trustees to obtain
the use of the building for the Sabbath-
school ; possession, however, was not obtained
until a considerable time after. The Rev,
F. B. Stephenson came to Hobart Town
this year as Superintendent Minister.
1873. Negotiations still' proceeding in
reference to use of the Mechanics’-institute,
and the best way of effecting and carrying
out alterations. Mr, E. Hawson was
appointed assistant general secretary. In the
year 1874 the Rev. D. Parry joined the Rev.
F. B. Stephenson in the Hobart circuit.
During this year arrangements having been
made with the trustees, and very extensive
alterations effected in the Mechanics’-
institute, it was occupied by the Sunday-
school. and has ever since proved a great boon
both to teachers and scholars ; it is, however,
capable of considerable improvement in some
of the details necessary for carrying on
modern school work, and it is hoped
sufficient funds will be available after the
Diamond Anniversary to carry out what is
needed. In 1875 the Rev. J. Cowperthwaite
was associated with the Rev. J. White. In
1878 Mr. R. L. Hood and Mr. H. J. Brownell
were school secretaries. In 1879 and 1880, Rev.
J. Cope and Rev. B. Butchers were together
in the Hobart circuit. In 1879, Mr. Josias
Heyward was appointed superintendent of
the High-street school in conjunction with
Mr. S. B. Mather. Mr. W. T. Strutt was
appointed general visitor. On January 1,
1881, the name of the City of Hobart Town
was changed to Hobart.
In 1881 the Rev. S. T. Withington and
Rev. H. E. Merriman were associated minis-
ters in Hobart. During this year Mr. H. J.
Brownell resigned the post of secretary in
Melville-street school, his place being sup-
plied by Mr. C. H. Y. Marsh, in conjunction
with Mr. R. L. P. Hood. Mr. Brownell
resigned to accept an appointment under the
Conference as a candidate for the Wesleyan
ministry,
1882. —At a committee meeting, held April
19, 1882, suggestions were made in reference
to alterations and improvements in the
Melville - street schoolroom ; this led to
arrangements being made with the trustees
resulting in the improvements being effected.
Mr. Hood and Mr. 0. H. Y, Marsh were the
secretaries,

In 1883 and 1884 the Rev. H. Greenwood
and Rev. H. E. Merriraan appear together.
During this year Mr. S. B. , Mather resigned
the superintendency of High-street, after a
connection of 35 years. In the same year is
recorded the death of Mr. Josias Heyward,
another superintendent of High-street. Mr.
Heyward was a brother of the Rev. G. T.
Heyward. Mr. George W. Ife was appointed
superintendent of High-street school, and
still worthily occupies that position, taking
a deep interest in school work. Mr, W. F.
Brownell resigned the post of general
secretary of the schools, Mr. G. T. Taylor
being appointed to fill his place. Mr. Taylor
was also subsequently appointed treasurer of
the school, a position be still continues to
fill.
1885,—At a meeting of the committee, held
on March 11, 1885, it was resolved,—“ That
from and after this date each of our schools
shall manage their own financial affairs.”
In 1886, 1887, and 1888 the Revs. J. G.
Millard and D. Annear were together in
Hobart. In 1889, 1890, and 1891 the Revs.
S. T. Withingion, R. W. Thompson, and D,
Lindsay were stationed in Hobart. For
several months in 1891 Mr, W. F. Brownell
was absent from the colony in England;
during his absence Mr. W. M. Williams
acted as locum tenens, and on the return of
Mr. Brownell Mr. Williams was elected co-
superintendent of Melville-street, During
the year a Christian Endeavour Society was
established, under the presidency of Mr.
Williams, and this has been in active opera-
tion ever since, proving a blessing to the
school and church.
1892.—Thisyear Mr.C.F.Y.Marsh resigned,
and Mr, F. Tyson and Mr. Geo. W. Jeffery
were appointed secretaries. Later in the
year Mr. Tyson resigned, and Mr. A. F,
Strutt was appointed secretary, a position
he still continues to fill. Mr. Strutt is an
indefatigable worker, whose interest and
energy never flags. At a meeting of the
committee held this year it is recorded that
the late Mr. Thomas James Crouch had left
a legacy of £25 to the Melville-street school,
the interest on which was to be an annual
subscription, Mr. Crouch thus showing to
the last his deep interest in the school with
which he had been connected for so many
years, and perpetuating his name for all time.
In the years 1892, 1893, and 1894 the Rev.
J. H. Tuckfield and the Rev. D. B. Bridg-
wood were associated in the circuit work.
Mrs. Tuckfield also threw her energies into
church and school work ; in the latter she
was eminently successful, and many of the
elder scholars will not soon forget her kind
and sympathetic zeal.
In 1895 Conference appointed the Rev.
Win. Shaw and the Rev. Samuel Cuthbert
to the Hobart Circuit, where we find them,
on this, our Diamond, Anniversary year still
labouring for the Master, and we are pleased
to record taking a deep interest in the young
people of our Church and Sabbath-school.
During this year Mr. Stanley Genge was
appointed assistant secretary, .vhich position
ho now fills.
There are many still in our church who in
former days were connected with the school
as teachers and scholars whose names we
would like to give a place in this report,
notably Mr. W. T. Strutt, who at an early
period was a scholar iu Melville-street school,
and for many years has been a local preacher
in this city. Also Mr. C. D. Haywood, who
is still an officer in the church, and who
entered the school as a scholar in 1846;
afterwards appointed a teach ?r,filling every
class in succession up to the Bible class,
which he conducted with efficiency until
1886, when failing health caused him to retire
from the work. Mr. Haywood’s sympathies
are still warm towards the school. We
cannot refrain from mentioning the name
of Mr. A. H. Barnett, who for some years
was connected with the school as a teacher,
and relinquished it only on account of his
health failing. Mr. Barnett’s father (Mr.
Wm. Harnett) was for a long time connected
with Melville-street and other schools, and
his grandfather (Mr. Wm, Barnett, sen.) was
amongst the earliest workers whose names
are recorded in our books.
We would also record the fact that Mr.
Henry Turner was formerly a scholar in the
school, having graduated the lowest classes
and passed through the school as a scholar,
subsequently having filled, as teacher, every
class in the school, including the Bible class.
We have been favoured with many interest-
ing reminiscences of early days of our school
history which we would gladly include in the
report, but having already exceeded the
proposed limits of this report we must stay
our hand.
We have endeavoured as briefly as possible
to compile the history which gives the rise
and progress of the Wesleyan Sunday-school
cause in this colony during the period of 75
years, but who can estimate the amount
of good that has been accomplished
during that time, the hundreds or thousands
who have gone home to Heaven as the result
of the teaching in this Sabbath-school. Since
the commencement of this school generations
have passed away, and there is not one left
who formed a part of the 23 who attended
the school at its first opening in 1821. We
have Mr, B. Shoobridge, and Mr. Florence
Gardiner, now of St. Kilda, Melbourne,
who were very early scholars, but not
quite one of the first. We have
Mr. William Witt (whose hoary head
is a crown of glory to him); he did yeoman
service for our Church and schools in town
and country, but it was 1837 when he became
a teacher in the school. We have also Mr,
S. B. Mather, whose name is mentioned at a
very early period, and who, subsequently, for
35 years was a superintendent in the High-
street school. Mr. H. J. Marsh must also
have began early as a scholar in the school.
But not one is left who began with the
beginning, and it is estimated that not less
than 10,000 scholars have passed through our
schools. Some have gone as missionaries to
heathen lands carrying the blessings of the
gospel there. Many have become ministers
in connection with our church in these colonies
—some have become statesmen, members of
the learned professions, filling high social
positions, we may be assured the better fitted
for adorning those positions by their early
religious and moral training.
Since the commencement of our school

others have taken their rise from time to
time in connection with every Christian
church in the town. With these there has
been no rivalry. We have never sought to
trench upon the work and labour of others,
believing there is ample room for all, hence
the utmost good feeling and brotherhood has
always existed, and as one evidence of that
kindly feeling we meet together once a year
as the associated Sabbath-schools in the Mel-
ville-street school, where we unitedly worship
together, ministers being chosen indifferently
from diffc *ent denominations to give the
addresses.
We have not laboured this report with
statistics and figures which are sometimes
wearying, but it may be a matter of interest
to state that in 1821 there were 4 teachers
and 23 scholars. In 1846, after a lapse of 23
years, there were 16 teachers and 225
scholars on the hooks. In 1871, another 25
years, the jubilee year of our schools, 30
teachers and 324 scholars. At the present
time there are 41 teachers and officers and
425 scholars recorded on our books.
As our school has progressed from time to
time, it has been necessary to make enlarge-
ments and improvements to meet the growing
wants. Our school has now reached another of
those periods. With the present number of
our scholars increased room and other teach-
ing facilities are needed, notably a new
infant classroom, a boy’s clubroom and
gymnasium, also the means of separating the
classes, etc. Should the necessary funds be
forthcoming as the result ot this anniversary,
these things will be provided, and we shall
start upon the new era of our school better
equipped for carrying on the work. It is
hoped the liberality of our friends and old
scholars will furnish the necessary funds.
The retrospect is pleasing, profitable, and
should be stimulating. We have the future
before us. There is a great work to be done ;
the harvest is plentiful, the labourers com-
paratively few. It becomes us to buckle on
the armour afresh, to work with renewed
vigour and earnestness, so that the achieve-
ments in the time to come may be greater
than those in the past.
Mr. G. T. Taylor read the balance-sheet
for the last year, and said he was the next
in seniority in connection with the school to
the chairman, Mr. Brownell. He had seen all
the present teachers, except three,
and scholars enter the Sunday-school.
(Applause.) In looking over figures in old
balance-sheets he found that the amount
received at the anniversary celebration in
1836 was £4l. On the previous day the
amount collected was £lB. At the anniver-
sary in 1848 there was a debit balance of
£7l. He found that at that time some
people subscribed 4s. 4d. a year, which he had
thought was on the old Wesleyan principle
of a penny a week, but he now found that
4s. 4d. was the value of the dollar of the
period. He noticed also that in 1848 the
seamen of H.M.S. Driver subscribed 12s.
towards the school. In 1862 two ladies
collected between them £5O. Last year the
ladies collected only £l2. The income last
year was £72 Os. 5d., "and there was a
balance at the end of Decemb(r of £7 7s. Id.,
but there were liabilities, which left a
deficiency of £3 14s
[This amount has since been paid by
two Brothers who were formerly scholars of
the school.]
Mr. G. IS. Crouch said he regarded it as a
compliment to his deceased father, that
he was asked to stand on the platform
that evening. His father always took a
great interest in the Sunday-school, even as
against the trustees of the Church. He also
endeavoured to instil temperance principles
into the scholars, because he knew that the
drinkjng habits of society did a great deal to
destroy in after life the good seed which was
sown in the minds of boys in the Sunday-
school. He tried to forward the total abstin-
ence principle in the Sunday-schools, but
would not be allowed because, it was said, the
schools were for the teaching of religion not
total abstinence to children. But he had
read of a prison chaplain who declared that
all the prisoners with whom he had to deal
at a certain time and place had been Sunday-
school scholars, but were led away from
good in mature life by drink.
Alderman Hiddlestone, M.H.A,, men-
tioned that his uncle was the first superin-
tendent of the first Wesleyan Sunday-school
established in Hobart. (Applause.) Many
ot the names mentioned in the report read
by the chairman were as familiar to him as
his own. He regretted 40 years ago
he did not provide himself with facts and
figures concerning the foundation of Sunday-
schools, which would now be of great value
and interest. In 1857 he first came to this
colony, and joined bis uncle, whom be then
saw for the first time ; and it was worthy of
mention that while his uncle was the first
superintendent of the first Wesleyan
Sunday-school in Hobart, he (the speaker)
was the first superintendent of the first
Primitive Methodist Sunday-school in the
same city. (Applause.) His uncle and his
aunt took a profound interest in the estab-
lishment of Sunday - schools, and they
now all knew how the foundation had
been built upon. (Applause.) With re-
gard to temperance, he found, from some
old records, that its history in Hobart went
back to the year 1832, and he had in his
possession the names of the first members of
the first Temperance Society. He hoped
that the proceeds of the diamond celebra-
tion of Melville-street School would enable
its graduates to newly furnish the school ;
and he would like to say that he could
wish to see a separate room provided for
each class.
The Chairman mentioned that he was
born in the late Mr. Hiddlestone’s house in
Brisbane-street, and that he was nursed as
a baby by Mr. Crouch’s father. The late
Mr. Hiddlestone and the late Mr. Crouch
were his father’s friends. (Applause.)


Mr. G. W. Ife said he thoroughly believed
in the room system of Sunday-school teach-
ing. If the teaching was to be beneficial it
must be done in a room apart from other
teachers and scholars.
The Rev. R. A. Thompson, 8.A., on
behalf of the Hobart Ministers’ Association,
expressed hearty good wishes and congratu-
lations to the Melville-atreet school on the
occasion of its diamond jubilee. The wel-
fare of the Sunday-school was the welfare of
the Church. He was glad to know that they
had at the head of the Sunday-school men
who were “up to date,” and would not allow
things to retrograde. He counselled them
to keep up their standard of teaching, so
that when the centenary of the school came
to be celebrated the last quarter century
would be an improvement even on the first
three. He wished them a bright and pros-
perous new year of work. (Applause )
Mr. E. Hawson mentioned that he had
been superintendent of the Davey-street
school for 27 years, but what he had heard
in the history of the Sunday-school
cause in the report read by the chair-
man filled him with a desire to emulate the
work of the good men who had gone before
them. The names which he had heard that
evening would live in his memory. The
ship which was launched 75 years ago with
a crew of 23, had done a wonderful voyage
since then.
The Rev. S. Cuthbert said that the
report was exhaustive without being ex-
hausting. It was even entertaining. One
of the most interesting phases in that cele-
bration was the use of the old hymns sung
by the children on the previous day. He
wished the Melville-street school great pros-
perity in the future. (Applause.)
Mr. W. M. Williams exhibited an old
painting of the late Mr. Hiddlestone, and
requested those who might have them to
lend portraits of certain deceased superin-
tendents of the Sunday-school for reproduc-
tion in a diamond celebration memorial
volume. He also exhibited a curiosity in
the form of a Sunday-school prize given in
1829 to Miss Rebecca Smith, afterwards
Mrs. Rothwell, and who was the
mother of Mrs. Morris. He also showed
a “ plan” of teachers, dated 1824. He
might, he said, describe those things as
“ antiquities of the Wesleyans in Hobart.”
The report ought to have included the names
of some ladies who had promoted the
Sunday-school cause in the past. They had
heard that evening a great deal about the
past, but what about the future? They
should try to do better, and be worthier of
the men and women who had gone before
them. He hoped that when the centenary
of the school came to be celebrated it could
be said that the present teachers had done
their work faithfully and well. (Applause.)
The Rev. W. Shaw mentioned as a warning
to critics of preachers that according to an
old document which then lay Upon the table
a person in Hobart in 1821 was “ excluded
for criticising the brethren." (Laughter.)
Considering the superior advantages and
opportunities which they had to-day, they
ought to be much better than their fathers.
(Applause.)
The proceedings terminated with the
singing of the doxology and the pronouncing
of the benediction.
CONSECRATION MEETING.
A consecration meeting took place on
Wednesday, May 13th. It was conducted by
the Rev. W. Shaw, and addresses were also
delivered by the Rev. J. Cope, and Messrs.
W. M. Williams and W. F. Brownell,
superintendents of the Sunday-school. Many
old scholars spoke of the benefits derived by
them from the teaching in the school, and the
Christian Endeavour Society repeated their
pledge and sang a hymn.
RE UNION OF OLD SCHOLARS AND
TEACHERS.
In connection with the Diamond Jubilee of
the Melville-street Wesleyan Sunday-school,
a re-union of old scholars and teachers of the
school took place on Friday evening, May
15th, The room was elegantly and com-
fortably furnished for the occasion, and
the windows were tastefully draped with
the flags of. all nations. Three floral arches
decorated the front of the platform. Mr.
C. D. Haywood lent and hung the flags, and
Mr. W. M. Williams and the Sunshine
Committee of the Christian Endeavour
Society arranged the furnishing of the room.
The chairs were provided by Mr. Bridges, an
old scholar.
Amongst those present were Mr. David
Crisp, Mr. Alfred Crisp, M. H.A., the Hon.
W. H. Burgess, Mr. Ebenezer Shoobridge,
and Mr. H. J. Marsh, all old scholars of the
school; the Rev. W. Shaw and the Rev. S.
Cuthbert, now ministers of the church ; the
Rev. D. B. Bridgwood, Wesleyan Church,
New Town ; Rev. S. Ironside ; Mr. G. W.
Ife, superintendent of High-street Wesleyan
Sunday school, and Mr. E, Hawson, super-
intendent of the Davey - street Sunday-
school ; Mr. W. P. Brownell and Mr. W.
M. Williams, superintendents of Melville-
street school; Mr. G. T. Taylor, treasurer,
and Mr. A. F. Strutt, secretary. About
200 ladies and gentlemen formed the general
company,
Letters of apology for absence and con-
gratulation on the occasion were received
from Mr. G,. Pullen, of Launceston, who
sent some personal reminiscences of the
Melville-street school and a monetary con-
tribution ; Mr. Henry Hurst, Sheffield,
Tasmania, an old scholar and teacher ; Mr.
R. J. Willing, of Malvern, near Melbourne,
an old scholar, who mentioned that he was
now a grandfather (laughter) ; Mr. R,
Harvey, a former teacher, who offered his


gratuitous services as architect for any new
building which might be erected in connec-
tion with the school ; Mr. Arthur Morey, a
late teacher sendiog a contribution; the
Rev. A. White, of Latrobe; Mr. A. Biggs,
of Launceston, enclosing a cheque ; Mr. W.
Witt, and the Rev. J. Cope.
Mr. Brownell welcomed the guests to
the gathering, which he mentioned was com-
posed exclusively of present and past
teachers and old scholars. He said he first
attended the Melville-street school as a
scholar in 1846, in which year its Silver
Jubilee ought to have been celebrated, but
was not. In 1871 he was present at the
Golden Jubilee celebration, and now he was
taking part in the Diamond Jubilee ; but ha
hardly hoped to be present at the Centenary.
He mentioned that a memorial volume of
the Diamond Jubilee, containing portraits of
all the superintendents from the first ia 1821
up to the present, would be published and
sold for the benefit of the school.
Mr. W illiams stated, as au interesting
fact, that 16 of the present ministers of the
Australasian Conference were old scholars
of Melville-street Sunday-school. (Applause).
The school had been competing for a banner
from time to time with 40 or 50 other
schools, possessing about 600 scholars, but
had not been beaten by even the big schools
of Victoria. (Applause.)
The Rev. G. T. Heyward, of Launceston,
au old scholar, said he saw around him some
with whom he “played ” 40 years ago.
Some of them were ladies. (Laughter.) He
first attended the school in 1847, when Mr.
H. J. Marsh was the secretary, and he re-
lated some amusing reminiscences of his
scholarship.
Theßev. W. Shaw exhibited an advertise
ment of the anniversary of the school in 1829,
a book of hymns used on the occasion, and
the report for the same date. These, he
said, were very interesting to all who desired
to know something of the religious history
of Tasmania.
Mr. S. H. Burrows, Superintendent of
the New Town school, said he still retained
his first prizi obtained at the Melville-street
school in 1855, That school had done much
in moulding the character of politicians and
others in this colony. (Applause.)
During the evening, Mrs. Currell sang
“ He wipes the tear from every eye ; ” Miss
Williams, “The better land;” Mr. H.
Crisp, “ Out on the deep ; ” and Mr. Alfred
Pratt, “ Will he come.”
Refreshments were served at half-past 9,
and a very agreeable evening was spent
throughout.
SUNDAY SERVICES.
The services were continued on Sunday.
May 10th. The Rev. G. T. Heyward, of
Launceston, formerly an old scholar,
preached in the morning. In the after-
noon the prizes were presented to the
scholars by Rev. W. Shaw and Rev.
G. T. Heyward, on which occasion
short addresses were given by the above-
named minister, the Rev. S. Ironside, and
the superintendents of the school, Messrs.
W. F. Brownell and W. M. Williams. In
the evening the Rev. W. Shaw conducted
the service. Ihe attendance on each occa-
sion was very large. The children sang
heartily and sweetly the old hymns and
tunes chosen for the occasion.
SACRED CONCERT.
A sacred concert was given in the
church on Monday evening, May 18th,
and was largely attended. The instru-
mentalists were Messrs. G. H. Reilly, S.
T. Moore, and T. J. Haywood, and the
vocalists Misses Castles, Bond, Lloyd, M.
Hawkins, and M. and Mabel Brownell ;
Messrs. J. Dear, W, P. and A. S. Brownell,
and the choirs of Chalmers Presbyterian,
Davey-street and Memorial Congregational,
New Town and Melville-street Wesleyan
Churches. Probably the best item in the
solo vocal pieces was Mr. A. Spencer
Brownell’s rendering of Gounod’s “Naza-
reth,” which was made a great favourite all
over these colonies a few years ago by Mr.
Charles Santley. Mr. Brownell possesses a
fine bass voice, which did justice to the
splendid composition. The Misses Lloyd
sang the duet, “ And God shall wipe away
all tears,” with excellent expression, and in
artistic style. The best choruses were,
“ Rejoice with one accord,” by Spinney,”
and “ Lift up your heads,” by Hopkins.
The former was given by the Melville-street
choir, and the latter by the united choirs.
The accompaniments to the choruses were
played by Mr. E. W. Turner, the church
organist, who rendered valuable aid in this
respect. Mr. G. G, Meredith acted as con-
ductor of the united choirs. A collection
was made in aid of the special Sunday-
school fund. In announcing the collection
Mr, W. M. Williams suggested that a choir
association should be formed in Hobart. It
would be most desirable and beneficial, he
said, to have the members of the various
choirs meet periodically, as so many had
done that evening.
DIAMOND FAIR.
A fair in connection with the Diamond
Jubilee of the Melville-street Wesleyan
Sunday - school was opened on Wednes-
day, May 20bh, in the Mechanics’-hall,
Melville - street, by Dr, E. L. Crowther.
M. H.A., who was accompanied by Mrs.
Crowther. The hall was nicely decorated
with the flags of all nations by Mr. C. D.
Haywood, a former teacher, anJ was fitted
up with 10 stalls, which were designed and
arranged by Mr. J. Overell. A refreshment
stall was located at the further end of the
room, and a crinkled paper stall and a dolls’
stall stood in the centre. The other stalls

were fitted up on either side of the hall.

It is difficult now to introduce any novel
element into a fair or baziar, but the pro-
moters of the D amond Fair at Melville-
street have managed to do so. At the
crinkled paper stall one is astonished to find
the number of beautiful, and even useful,
things which can be produced from that
fragile material by ingmious and artistic
hands. Amongst the articles shown were
fl iwers, lampshades, 11 iwerpot covers, fi e
screens, windmills, and easels. At this s all
was also to be seen an elegant wooden flower
stand turned by one of the teachers.
The girls usually do all the work of
manufacture and sale at fairs and bazaars,
bu*, on this occasion, we find a stall pre-
sided over by boys—a decided novelty,
which is likely to be largely imitated else-
where, These young gentlemen had a large
collection of practically useful things, such as
dish mops, string hammocks, wood in bread
plates, stools, step-ladders—all, or most of
them, made by boy scholars of the Sunday-
school.
The produce stall contained a vast quan-
tity of undeniably useful goodi—with only
one drawback—that they were more perish-
able than stools aud step ladders. Ihese
goods included fresh meat, vegetables, fruit,
jams, sausages, and poultry.
The doll stall contained an infinite variety
of dolls, of all complexions and modes of
dressing.
The fancy stall displayed a large quantity
of the wares usually found in fancy goods
shops ; also some nice oil paintings.
The plain needlework stall would
probably do some of the largest business
among the people of practical mind. The
great variety of useful things, chiefly for
ladies and children, which were exhibited
were made at the weekly sewing meetings
of scholars and teachers. The articles did
credit to their skill and industry, and
would, no doubt, be quickly bought up.
The infant and toy stall contained, among
other things, a doll’s house, which was a
real work of art. It was complete in every
architectural detail, had a neat garden in
front, and was also elegantly furnished
within. The house was built in Hobart.
There was also a smaller house in this stall,
upon the fence of which was the significant
notice, ‘ For Sale.”
The lolly stall and the refreshment stall
were laden with tempting things.
In a marquee erected in front of the
church, Mr. J. Bidencope and Mr. A. P.
Walker held a show of 200 varieties of
splendid chrysanthemums, the very latest
that it was possible to exhibit.
On t,he arrival of Dr. and Mrs. Crowther,
the latter was presented with a beautiful
bouquet by Miss Lillie Williams, convener
of the Sunshine Comm’ttee of the Christian
Endeavour Society.
Mr. W. F Brownell, one of the superin-
tendents of the Sundiy-school, then intro-
duced Dr. Crowther to the large gathering of
ladies and gentlemen present. He men-
tioned that he knew Dr. Crowther’s father
and grandfather ; the former of whom took
a great interest in the Melville-street school,
and was present at the celebration of its
golden jubilee five and twenty years ago.
Dr. Crowther, when he was asked to open
the fair that day, at once assented in the
most kind and cheerful manner.
Dr. Crowther, M H.A., in declaring the
fair open, thanked those present for the
kind reception which they had given him.
When Mr. Brownell and Mr. Williams asked
him to be present on the occasion, he took
it as a great compliment. Twenty fine
years ago his father took an interest in a
somewhat similar event in connection with
that Sunday-school. But there were other
and more important reasons for his presence
there. It was with the teachers of schools
like that of Melville street, and with
the mothers of families, that rested
the answer to the question, were the chil-
dren of the colony to be taught religion or
not ? It was mainly due to the Sunday-
ischools that the children were being brought
up as well as they were, and it was most
creditable to the teachers that they devoted
their time, which was money, to the reli-
gious instruction of the little ones. At that
school they were teaching 400 oi 500 chil-
dren, and it was not too much to say that it
was one of the brightest spots in Tasmania.
Let them think what it meant in the future,
not only to those children, but to their
children, and to all whom they might have
the power to influence. Ihe teachers were
doing a noble work, and doing it well. It was
nowelear that in thi icolony there would be no
religion for the children except what was
taught them in the Sunday schools, whose
mission was therefore more significant than
ever,


Helping Hand Mission Band has given its
services at the fair, with pleasant effect.
The proceeds of the enterprise will be
devoted to the erection of an infants’ class-
room, a boys’ club-room, and various other
improvements.
The fair (continued on Thursday) has
been quite as successful as its promoters
anticipated, and the financial result will be
a substantial contribution to the building
fund of the new infant school and Boys’
Club which it is proposed to erect in
connection with the Melville-street Wes-
leyan Church. The day of opening being
a half-holiday with many business people,
the fair was especially well attended
by visitors on that day, the receipts for
which amounted to £54. After the open-
ing, a “ post office ” and a Punch and Judy
show were added to the fair, and proved
An anniversary like that of the
Melville-street Sunday-school is some-
thing for the Wesleyan body to be
proud of, an unbroken record of 75
years of work, which can but have had
its effect on the history of the nation,
one of those unwearying, yet almost
unrecognised labours of love that are
being persisted in throughout the com-
munity, the healthiest part of its life-
blood, by which the people have been
continuously kept in a sound state, or
raised from the poverty of moral degra-
dation to the dignity of better things.
In lands like these new ones, where
the condition of life is essentially one
of progress and change, it is something
to have agencies like these which
preserve an element of level exertion,
while at the same time they move up-
ward with the general advancement,
the best feature in this Christian work
of tuition being its thoroughness, and
the introduction of the family element
into the school life. Fine proof of this
is given in the report which was pre-
sented to the large gathering on Mon-
day evening. Family names which are
to be found in the early records of the
school are still represented in the
ranks of both teachers and taught,
a tangible evidence of the truth of the
old saying that example is better even
than precept, and that the carrying of
the church element into the home
circle has achieved the happiest results.
Wesleyans, as a class, seem to recognise
this in a marked degree. With many
of the followers of this vigorous branch
of religious thought the cry to the
Sub-Leader, taken from “The Mercury,” May 13th, 1896.
useful sources of revenue, a large number of
letters and telegrams pissing through the
former. Fees for mileage, in case of tele-
grams, might have still further increased
the income of the department, were it not
that, curiously enough, the persons to whom
the wires were addressed happened to be in
the room at the moment of their arrival. A
special effort was made last night to dis-
pose of the perishable goods in the fair, and
the unsold merchandise which would
“ keep ” was laid aside for use at a future
fair. Ihe precise site of the intended new
building has not yet been fixed upon, but of
course it will be within the present church
and school premises. The “ takings ”at
the fair on Thursday amounted to £3O,
which with sundry amounts not yet paid in
will bring the total receipts of the fair up to
about £lOO.
children is not “ go to Sunday-school,”
but “ come with us to Sunday-school,”
followed naturally by a feeling of com-
radeship and imitation which takes
away the narrowness of the weekly
duty, and ensures it a proper place in
the growing imaginations of those who
thus learn, corporately, but still many
of them at the father’s or mother’s knee,
the difference betweenright and wrong,
and the many other counsels which go
to make up the career of the most use-
ful citizens. The effect of Melville-
street teaching is seen on every hand,
and in all ranks of life, demonstrating
the vitality that has permeated the
course of lessons, as well as the un-
failing energy that has kept them going
for so many years, and it is an earnest
of a continuance of the line work till
those now in the classes unite, as
adults, to conduct the centenary of the
institution. Sunday - schools are a
necessity of the age. The State system
of education, admittedly a piece of
wise compromise, fails to deal with the
subjects taught in them, on account
principally of the differences existing
between the Churches themselves, and
the wisest course, although some do not
think so, is to accept loyally what the
State provides for the young, supple-
menting by voluntary effort the mental
fare provided in those points where
certain sections of the colonists think
it incomplete. This is the work the
Wesleyans take up with such marked
ability, and with such marked success,
and this is the standpoint of the pre-
sent week’s triumphant celebration.
