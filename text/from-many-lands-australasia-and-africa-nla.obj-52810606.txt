We will begin with Africa because it is
nearer to us, besides we ought to pay respect
to old age, and Africa has been far longer
known to the world than Australia and New
Zealand.
Africa is called the “dark continent” be-
cause many hundreds of thousands of square,
miles in the interior are still unexplored by
civilized man, otherwise it is exceptionally
bright and sunny,
This great Continent consists of no less

On the first page we have some pretty Algerian
children, and some quaint pottery from their country.
Algeria is in the north of Africa, and was once
inhabited by pirates, but it is now a province of
France. Algiers is the capital
and is a pleasant, interesting town.

all here, so let us turn and look at the pictures.

AUSTRALASIA.
Australasia is the name given to
the great island-continent of Australia,
(which with the island of Tasmania
constitutes the Commonwealth of Aus-
tralia) and the island of New Zealand
and many smaller islands. The total
extent of these dominions is 3,178,882 square
miles, with a population of 5,000,000.
The names of the states that form
the Commonwealth are New South Wales,

The chief inhabitants are of course
the colonists who are mostly descended from British fathers and
grandfathers. These children, of the Empire are a fine race both
physically and mentally, and are full of loyalty to their
King and the Mother Country, as England is called.
There are extensive mines of all sorts
of minerals in Australasia, including coal,
copper, silver and lead while rich gold
fields were discovered in 1851. Agriculture
is one of the chief industries,

tities are reared for the sake

England; and very good mutton it is.
