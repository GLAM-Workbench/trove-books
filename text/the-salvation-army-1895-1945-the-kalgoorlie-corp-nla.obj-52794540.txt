Extract from a Recent Message from
The General
The great end of all Salvation Army endeavours is the
right adjustment of human lives to the plan of God through the
Redeeming Grace of Christ.
We realise our only hope of permanently benefitting the
broken and desolate with whom we are dealing is to bring the
Divine Spirit to bear upon their needs—an essential principle
to the securement of abiding good, whether in the life of the
individual or in the vast populations of the whole earth.
George L. Garpenter.
General.


The
Jerritorial Leader's
Message
Kalgoorlie reaches an im-
portant milestone in its history
and it is an occasion for glorifying
God and acknowledging fine
service as we reflect upon these
fifty years.
I he conditions in which Christian witness in these days is
given may differ greatly from fifty years ago, but necessity. Was
never more urgent nor was the Everlasting Gospel more necess-
ary; and our rejoicings in the Golden Jubilee should be an
occasion of rededication to the high and holy purposes of Salva-
tion Army testimony and service.
We God for the pioneers and we remember affec-
tionately the Officers of the Corps through its life time of history,
and I urge the whole of the present soldiership, senior, youth
and young people, to consecrate themselves to greater achieve-
ments for the Kingdom and the
Salvation of Kalgoorlie.
Mrs. Dalziel joins me in
hearty congratulations and best
wishes.

Commissioner.


Greetings
Town Hall, Kalgoorlie
On this memorable occasion, the Jubilee of the Salvation
Army on the Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia, I would
like to express my appreciation of the work done by i;he various
officers during those fifty years ; and more particularly to those
officers who pioneered the work during those first difficult, though
wonderful years; and also to some of the members, not officers,
whose Christian work and example was an inspiration to all.
They served their day and generation m a manner that cannot be
paid for in gold.
May God’s blessing rest on their efforts and on the Salva-
tion Army to-day and all days.
R. Y. Moore,
Mayor of Kalgoorlie
Bishopbourne, Kalgoorlie
The Salvation Army in Kalgoorlie is celebrating its Golden
Jubilee. We are all familiar with it, for its excellent band con-
tinually advertises its presence, while its members are not afraid
to witness to their faith in public places. All men respect them
for their courage, and m their heart of hearts have a deep-seated
admiration for the Army’s constant efforts to reclaim and convert
the fallen and to care and provide for the destitute and the orphan.
May their Jubilee Celebrations be to them an inspiration
for renewed efforts m their work, and may God bless them in
the difficult days which he ahead of us all when hostilities cease.
Edward,
Bishop of Kalgoorlie
S.A. Headquarters, Perth
Goldfields Salvationists have set a standard of service for
God and Humanity which is second to none. The ultimate result
of fifty years of such service cannot be estimated.
My wife joins me m congratulating the Kalgoorlie Corps on
the past, and in prayer that the coming years may see even greater
things.

THE EARLY BEGINNINGS
The Kalgoorl le Corps was opened at the end of August,
1895, by two men—Pioneer Officers, Captain Albert McGill
and Lieutenant William Randall—who carried their swags from
Southern Cross. These courageous Soldiers of Christ faced with
the diggers all the hardships and privations, thirst, dust and heat
of those days, in order that they might establish the work of the
Salvation Army m Kalgoorlie. God was with them, they were
victorious.
Fevers and epidemics were frequent owing to the terrible
living conditions, but the Army continued faithfully. Lassie-
Officer Nursing Sisters—the first being Captain Hannah Miles,
affectionately known as “Paddy” Miles—were sent to help care
for the victims of disease. A wonderful work was done by these
splendid women.
During the first months most of the meetings were conducted
m the open air. The Austral Guards Band, which visited the
Corps in 1896, marched miles around the goldfields to play to
various groups, there being no means of gathering people into a
hall, and no Army Hall m which to gather them. However, very
early, land was cleared on the present site, and the present hall
erected on January 27, 1897. Memorial blocks marking the


opening of the hall were laid by Messrs. R. L. Hair and F. R.
Barlee. Commandant H. H. Booth performed the opening
ceremony.
The work progressed splendidly and from Kalgoorlie out-
posts and new corps were opened at Boulder, Menzies, Leonora,
Laverton and other places. Ten years after the opening, the
founder of the Salvation Army, General William Booth, visited
the city. No building was considered sufficiently large to accom-
modate the crowds desiring to hear this distinguished Leader.
The Tramway’s Carbarn was kindly placed at the Army’s dis-
posal, a platform erected, the pits cleared and covered, but even
then it was overcrowded.
The founder, whilst in Kalgoorlie, planted a Kurrajong
tree in front of the hall. This tree for some time in later years
appeared to be dead, but in 1940 it revived and the new shoot
is now becoming a good sized tree again as can be seen in the
photograph below.
It may be that many who
possessed the spirit of the pioneers in
earlier days have, with the passing of
years, lost somewhat of their spiritual
power and experience. May this
fubilee Year mean the revival of
such spiritual forces.

Let Us Sing
O BOUNDLESS Salvation! deep
ocean of love,
O fulness of mercy, Christ
brought from above,
The whole world redeeming, so
rich and so free,
Now flowing for all men —come,
roll over me!
The Founder’s Song
The tide is now flowing, I’m
touching the wave,
I hear the loud call of “The
Mighty to Save;”
My faith’s growing bolder —
delivered I’ll be!
I plunge ’neath the waters —they
roll over me.
And now Hallelujah! the rest of my days
Shall gladly be spent in promoting His praise
Who opened His bosom to pour out this sea
Of Boundless Salvation for you and for me!
—William Booth.

Taken during last year, this photograph shows Major Sexton and Adjutant Howard (whose term as Commanding
Officers for three years and eight months was the longest of any Corps Officers) with members of the band brought
into existence during the war. Also to be seen is the late Colour-Sergeant, Brother Samuel, an Indian convert who
stood well for God and the Army and passed to his Reward last November.

With every morning sacrifice.
People and realms of every

Dwell on His love with sweetest

And infant voices shall proclaim
Their young hosannas to His
name.
Blessings abound where’er He
reigns;
The prisoner leaps to lose his
chains;
The we ary find eternal rest;
And all the sons of want are blest.

“I am glad to send a message after fifty years of the Corps’
great work. 1 had the honour of being the first captain stationed
at Kalgoorlie, my lieutenant being Wm. Randall. We had a
small band of soldiers, all of whom were real pioneers for the
Army. Although the going was rough, we never regretted the
happy times we enjoyed through it all. I wish you abundant
success m your Anniversary and pray that God’s blessing may
rest on all connected with the Corps.”
Albert McGill,
Pioneer C. 0., 1895
“To present day comrades I say: ‘Stick to your knees, the
Bible never neglect, pass on its burning message. Your comrades
of the yesterdays fought a good fight and made history of which

greater victories.’ 1 wish you a soul-saving jubilee. God .Bless
you. ’ ’
E. M. Hasluck, Major (R.),
