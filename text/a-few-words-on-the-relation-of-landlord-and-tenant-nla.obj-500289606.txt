RELATION OF LANDLORD AND TENANT
IN IRELAND.
No one who looks at the piles of Bine Books npon
the state of Ireland can for a moment doubt that
Parliament has done its utmost to understand the
subject. It has also done its utmost to supply infor-
mation of a reliable kind by hearing all parties and
recording their views. In these ponderous volumes not
only every fact bearing upon the subject is doubtless
to be found, but also every opinion which is entitled
to the slightest weight. Upon the relation of landlord
and tenant, an important part of the whole question,
a Committee sat so recently as in the Session of 1865.
Upon that Committee there were several very able
men; still there is reason to fear that even in the
highest quarters unsound opinions are to be found.
For instance, one should have thought that if there
/was anything certain in Social Science it was the fact
that Ireland was over-peopled: over-peopled as an
agricultural country in the proportion of the cultivators
to the area under cultivation; over-peopled in a more
extended sense in the relation of population to capital.
Yet we find Mr. Gladstone (‘ Times,’ August 3rd, 1866)
expressing his anxiety to get rid of the “ frightful and
monstrous evil’ of emigration.” Such sentiments may
b 2


please; but it is not the interest of the tenant or
landlord to be led into error. If we find that there
are still three times as many persons to the square
mile engaged in agriculture, or depending upon it,
as in England, how can we doubt that the population
is redundant? When we compare the agricultural
capital of the two countries, how much stronger does
the contrast become! Under such circumstances, to
complain of emigration, and to endeavour to devise
some means which shall induce the peasant to struggle
against nature, to toil in improving barren surface,
where his earnings will be perhaps a few pence a day,
while he is within a short sail of a country where he
can earn five shillings, is surely sadly to mislead him.
Mr. Longfield says that the Irish peasant has every
legal inducement to exertion that the English peasant
has, but that he requires more; and therefore he
recommends Exceptional Legislation.* Has he the
same inducements? I think not. He has the same
inducement as far as the law goes, no doubt; but, with
a population on the land so dense, his inducement to
labour must be much less. There are no returns that
I know of which give accurately the ratio of population
to land in the agricultural districts of England and
Ireland. From the period when the subject was in-
quired into by Mr. Wilmot Horton’s Committee on
Emigration to the present time, there has been a
constant concurrence of opinion as to the fact that
Ireland was greatly over-peopled; and even at the
present time, when Emigration has afforded some relief,
there is no one conversant with the agricultural districts
of England and Ireland who is not aware that the

population of Ireland engaged in agriculture is much
more dense than that of England and Scotland. Any
Census giving the numbers per square mile must he
perfectly fallacious, as that includes the population of
the towns, who take no part in agriculture. I had
an opportunity of making inquiries in different places
in 1859, and was led to believe that the ratio in the
densely peopled districts was then about three and a
quarter to one ; * since that, emigration has made some
change. Many persons well aware of the figures seem
to think that Ireland nevertheless is not over-peopled;
that the land, if highly cultivated, could support a
larger population; and therefore they recommend ex-
ceptional legislation. But is it likely that an invasion
of the rights of property would attract the capital
necessary for improved cultivation ? is it not much
more likely it would drive away the capitalist ? They
see a dense population in the towns in England, but
they forget that it is not by cultivating the land that
they earn their support. They say, how can we tell
them that the population is redundant when the farmers
are complaining of the difficulty of obtaining labourers
in harvest time ? and we know that formerly a farmer
had only to hold up his hand, and he could command
as many labourers as he pleased. Emigration no doubt
* Lord Dufferin discusses the subject in his * Enquiry into the State of Ireland
in 1866,’ p. 55; butlhis data are insufficient for obtaining any very accurate
result. If we take, however, the proportion of one labourer to thirty acres as
the average he has obtained by examining certain farms in England and
Scotland, and then inquire what the relative numbers are in Ireland, in
districts similarly circumstanced, I think it will be found that my estimate is
not much in error. Wo must recollect, however, in making the comparison,
that the farms examined by Lord Dufferin represent districts highly cultivated,
"where the most labour is required, and the labourers are therefore the most
numerous, and we must compare them with districts in Ireland where the
labourers are numerous also. .


has produced the change. But was that redundance of-
labourers desirable ? Is it not far better that the
labourer should feel his improved position; that he
should demand and receive fairer wages; and is it not
certain that although the farmer may at first experience
some inconvenience, in the end he will be no loser?
In England labour is really not dearer than in Ireland,
though the wages are nearly double, because the labourer
does nearly twice as much,* and the Irish labourer is no
sooner in England than he does,English work, and
receives English wages. The Irish labourer at home
will also gradually acquire the habit of working more
diligently as wages increase, and the farmer will lose
nothing. Emigration is also improving the position of
the farming class in Ireland. When the corn-laws
were repealed, necessary as that measure was, the status
of the small farmer was very much changed for the
worse; he had no longer the prospect of very high
prices for pulling up leeway; corn grown abroad with
the aid of a finer climate was brought into competition
with him, just as fabrics made with the aid of machinery
had competed ruinously with the hand-loom weaver.
The situation of the small farmer and hand-loom weaver
were alike the subject of deep commiseration; and
various suggestions were made in the hope of affording
them relief. The hand-loom weaver, with the knowledge
acquired at Mechanics’ Institutes, was well aware that
nothing could be done; that he must either betake
himself to some other calling or emigrate. I was very
much struck with the intelligence and good feeling
displayed by the operatives before a Committee of the
House of Commons, to whom the subject was referred.
* This is a very common observation, and no doubt it is well founded.


Not so the small farmer in ignorance of principles, in
ignorance of effects; he threw all the blame at once upon
the institutions of the country, and the wealthier classes.
Many no doubt believed that some means might be
found out to enable the small Irish occupiers to compete
with the farmers on the continent. They said, we have
no faith in your theories; in Belgium there are small
farmers, and they flourish; they did not perceive that
there was no analogy between small farming in Belgium
and in Ireland. Even without going to Belgium in-
formation sufficient might have been obtained in books,
by which they could have set themselves right; but a
visit to Belgium would have at once dispelled the illusion.
In Belgium there is a fine climate for the growth of
cereals; the soil is usually a sandy loam, producing the
finest wheat crops. The country is rich in minerals.
There iron is raised in immense quantities and applied
to every useful purpose; there is a great manufactory
of artillery and small arms. More coal is raised there
than in all France, manufactures abound, there is
industry in every shape, besides there is a large foreign
commerce. What a contrast to Ireland where wheat
may be said to grow almost by sufferance in average
seasons, and to fail altogether in bad seasons ;* and yet
even in Belgium with all its advantages things do not
run quite smooth; there is much pauperism. A great
change has taken place recently in Ireland. Now, when
a farmer is beginning to fail, he puts together what he
can and emigrates. The landlord perhaps loses two
years’ rent, or more, but he is compensated in the comfort

the Rev. Humphrey Lloyd, D.D., Yice-Provost of Trinity College, Dublin,

and happiness resulting to all parties; the farm is
annexed to that of the adjoining tenant.
„ In emigrating, the tenant is under no compulsion*;
he finds he cannot get on, either owing to the smallness
of the farm and foreign competition, or to his want of
capital, or to one of the many causes which give rise to
failure in farming as in other business. Had he re-
mained in Ireland, just as is the case with the English
tenant under similar circumstances, he would have found
himself in the poor-house. In America he will probably
acquire an independence, if he makes his way to the
districts where land is at a nominal price, f As emi-
gration proceeds, the improvement is rapid : wages rise,
farms become larger, we feel we have more room, and
that we may look forward to a state of things when
larger farms may admit of better farm-buildings. As
labourers become scarce, the labourer is in request, the
employer has to seek him out: as tenants become scarce,
the landlord seeks out the tenant. This is a wholesome
state of things, at which we may hope before long to
arrive.
One.thing more emigration has effected. It has done
that which neither the Law nor the Police could do ; it
has put an end to agrarian crime, by relieving the
pressure in the agricultural districts, and by enticing
away the parties who had combined against the law.
People are no longer ready to contend for a miserable
piece of land, to quarrel about a dry bone, when they

enough to purchase one hundred acres of land in fee, and the necessary
stock.


see plenty of good land within their reach. In America
they probably in the end make good members of society.
In this respect there is a great difference between a new
and an old country : in a new country the dangerous
classes are eventually absorbed by the land, while in an
old country they must be kept down by force; and that
is a reason why a Democracy may succeed perfectly in
a new country, and totally fail in an old country.
Mr. Fawcett thus speaks of emigration in his essay
on the 1 British Labourer ’ * ; —“ From England and
“ Scotland during the last fifteen or twenty years there
“ has been a very large emigration, although the people
“ have not been compelled to leave these countries by
“ so sudden and awful a catastrophe, as that which
“ caused the Irish exodus. Our labourers did not emi-
“ grate in order to avert imminent starvation, hut they
“ left our shores with a view of improving their material
“ condition, by settling in countries where labour was
“ dear and land cheap. When we reflect on the pecu-
“ niary advantages which every emigrant may rea-
“ sonably expect to obtain, it seems surprising that our
u labourers have not left us in much greater numbers.
“ I have already endeavoured to show you that a large
“ proportion of our working population are in a state of
“ miserable poverty. The ordinary wages of our agri-
“ cultural labourers are not more than nine or ten
“ shillings a week; many of them live in dwellings
“ which do not deserve the name of human habitations.
“ It is scarcely possible for them to obtain the neces-
“ saries, much less any of the comforts, of life. They
“ cannot make any provision either for sickness or old

Professor of Political Economy at Cambridge, p. 209.


“ age, and when their strength is exhausted by the hard
“ toil which they have endured, they must bear the
“ humiliation of becoming Parish Paupers. It seems
“ wonderful that men who are in this condition do not
“ emigrate en masse; the United States, Australia, and
“ others of our Colonies would gladly purchase their
“ labour at four or five shillings a day; they would be
“ the citizens of a free Grovernment, and enjoy all the
“ rights which Englishmen possess; they would live in
“ a climate as healthy as our own, and they would join
“ nations which speak our language, which inherit our
“ instincts, and which honour our institutions. In fact,
“ those who live here in poverty without the slightest
“ hope of advancement might feel, when they had emi-
“ grated, that a career of affluence and honourable
“ social position was open both to them and their
“ children.”
Again he says :
“ The truth, therefore, becomes irresistibly brought
“ home to our minds, that if a man finds his labour is
“ not wanted in one country he ought not to stagnate
“ there in hopeless poverty; there is placed before him
“in other lands a great and glorious career: a great
“ career because he may become the progenitor of
“ mighty nations; a glorious career because he will
“ abundantly fulfil the behests of his Maker if he causes
“ the wilderness to become the home of civilized man.
“ This world was made for the occupation of the human
“ race, and it never could be intended that fertile soils
“ should grow nothing but rank and useless vegetation;
“ it never could be intended that rivers which might
“ stimulate the production of untold wealth should
“ always continue ’to flow through solitudes; it never
“ could be intended, we may unhesitatingly say, that


“ scenes should continue to be viewed by no human eye,
“ which are so beautiful, that their contemplation must
“ make man look from Nature up to Nature’s God.”*
Mr. Fawcett, in his ‘Political Economy,’ expresses
the same views.
It has been asked, Where emigration has already
effected so much, might not something be done to aid
it ? There are two objections; one is that there is
always much inconvenience in a transition state, and
that inconvenience would be increased by making the
transition more rapid. The other, that there would
be danger of interfering with self-supporting emigra-
tion, and so to a certain extent defeating our object.
It, however, may be aided by making the plain truth
known in all its details as widely as possible. Truth
may be sometimes unjDalatable, but it is always whole-
some. In this way perhaps something may be done to
counteract the efforts made, from mistaken views, to
retard emigration, by raising expectations of social and
political change.
There have been some real and many sentimental
grievances, but the excess of population, which, as long
as I can recollect, has been the real Irish grievance, may
perhaps have been first felt in the middle of last century.
I well recollect the glowing terms in which several old
people in our neighbourhood were wont to speak of the
plenty in their younger days; bread, meat, and the best
ale being the ordinary peasant’s fare. As the popula-
tion became more dense there was a gradual change for
the worse, and bread, meat and ale, gave place to the
potatoe. Going farther back, looking to old stewards’
books, I find the farms were then large, and each had

its dairy and brewhouse, and all the ordinary offices.
The farms are now small, and the old farm buildings
have disappeared. Now again the farms are gradually
becoming larger, and new farm buildings are rising up.
Why is this ? Simply because it was the practice then
to do that which is now so much recommended, —to make
long leases. English notions did not then prevail even
in the courts of law, and there seems to have been a
strong leaning against tenant restriction. In fact,
covenants in leases by various recorded decisions had
been rendered void practically. The tenant unrestricted
by covenants pulled down the farm buildings, and
divided the farm into small portions, which he suh-let
at a very much higher rent than he paid, and finally,
when the farm returned to the owner again, after two
or three generations, instead of one tenant there were
perhaps fifty; the original tenant having in fact ejected
himself. I find that the names even of the original
tenants have disappeared in almost every instance, and
the present occupiers have come no one knows from
whence; so that in fact a complete revolution in the
occupancy of land has taken place wherever there were
long leases. To make this clearer by an example, let us
take the case of the late Lord Palmerston’s estate in the
county of Sligo; the particulars are given in the evidence
of Mr. Kincaid before the Devon Commission, Part 1.,
p. 30. The estate was let about sixty years before the
Devon Commission was appointed, on leases for three
lives or thirty-one years, in some cases sixty-one years
in farms of about 230 acres each; these leases expired
in 1838, and during the continuance of these leases sub-
division had been carried so far that on some portions
of the estate the farms had dwindled into farms of less
than five acres, on others into farms of still smaller


dimensions. The late Lord Palmerston was an excellent
and most liberal landlord, and although he was prepared
to bear all expense, he would not force emigration; hut
endeavoured to make the best arrangement he could
for this excessive population. He squared the little
holdings, and to increase employment he laid out
15,000£. in constructing a harbour for fishing-boats.
About twenty years before the Commission met,-
Lord Palmerston gave fresh leases to many of the
occupying tenants to enable them to register ten-pound
freeholds; and under these leases further subdivision
took place, so that on one townland of 201 Irish acres
there were 135 tenants. It does not appear that any
farm was subdivided to make freeholders; but he simply
gave freehold leases, the subdivision having previously
taken place; and this, as far as I am aware of, was very
much the case throughout Ireland. Mr. Kincaid says
that there was no desire whatever for leases. When
the potatoe crop failed, being anxious to know the con-
dition of Lord Palmerston’s estate, I made inquiry and
found that it was costing double the rental to sustain
the population upon it for three months.
Though it was a well understood fact that all cove-
nants were nugatory, I thought it worth while for my
own satisfaction to single out a very strong case for
legal advice, it seemed to be so contrary to common sense
that plain words should be taken as meaning nothing.
There was a lease apparently drawn with great care to
prevent subdivision, ending with a sweeping covenant
against alienation. The tenants were still in the act
of subdividing the land, and the farm besides had been
alienated. This appeared to me to be an extreme case,
and the best counsel’s opinion was taken; but the


opinion was decisive that nothing could be done. Lord
Derby produced a similar lease in the House of Lords,
upon which he had taken counsel’s opinion, and with
the same result; so that it was quite clear that the
courts had been so hampered by previous decisions that
they could do nothing. Had the law been strong
enough to prevent subdivision we should early have
had a large emigration to America; the settlers would
have enjoyed all the advantages which Mr. Fawcett so
eloquently describes, and when the potatoe failed the
loss would not have fallen upon Ireland more heavily
than on other parts of the United Kingdom.
A few years ago, in visiting the Scilly Islands, I was
much struck with the comfort and industry which I saw
around me. On inquiry I found that the aspect of
things, and that not very long ago, had been widely
different. That the farmers there had been in the
habit of subdividing their farms as in Ireland, and that
there was a rapid approach to a state of pauperism.
When Mr. Smith became landlord he at once put an
end to the practice of subdividing, and he was enabled
to do so because the law was supreme there just as in
England. Of the rising generation some instead of
vegetating on the land became sailors, some emigrated,
while many became artificers, the principal trade being
ship-building. Even now in Ireland I regret to say
there is a strong tendency to revert to the ruinous
practice of subdividing the land where stringent
measures are not taken to prevent it.
If we have found that the agricultural districts in
England and Ireland differ much as to the density of
the population, they differ also as to the quality of the
farm-buildings, and that too where the proprietor is as


much an English as an Irish landlord. They differ
also as to the rent paid, which is about half that paid in
England.*
A great proportion of the tenements are too small
to command a good farm-house; they have merely
temporary thatched cottages, which were originally
erected by the tenants when the farm was subdivided
and are occasionally repaired by them. There are no
farm-buildings, properly so called : the mildness of the
climate admits of the cattle remaining out all winter,
and the little farmer is thus enabled to make shift
without farm-buildings. On such small farms, at the
usual rent, no expenditure on a substantial cottage or
farm-building is practicable; it is, therefore, perfectly
true that in the case of small farms the tenants provide
such accommodation as they possess. As emigration
proceeds, the farms increase in size; and at length
the question of farm-buildings arises. They are then
* T except part of Ulster, where, just as in the case of the West Eiding of
Yorkshire, the rent is high, and also the immediate vicinity of towns.
The following are the rents paid for arable land in certain parts of the King’s
County, which I was at once enabled to obtain from the books of my land-
agent :

This is in Irish acres, which, reduced to English statute acres in the proportion
of 196 :121 will be 11s. 1 hd. per acre. We must recollect in making the com-
parison that the English tenant pays the whole poor rate and tithe, while the
Irish tenant pays but half the poor rate, and is tithe free. For this difference
there should be a further correction.
This, I think, represents pretty fairly the rents paid by yearly tenants in
the Midland Counties. Of course where there are fine pasture lands, such as
those of Meath, the rent is much higher.


usually erected jointly by the landlord and tenant; the
landlord, perhaps, provides slates and timber, the tenant
mason-work; that arrangement seems best to suit the
tenant in his present circumstances. Sometimes they
are erected by the tenant secured by a lease. In any
case they are less commodious than they are usually in
England; partly because the farm is even now smaller,
and partly because the rent is so much lower. To lay
on a percentage for farm-buildings—in fact, to increase
the rent —would generally be unpopular, and would be
inconvenient to the tenant, at least at present.* The
value of land, no doubt, will rise; it is not in the nature
of things that so great a disparity in this respect be-
tween England and Ireland should long continue. As
land becomes more valuable, farm-buildings will be
provided everywhere. No farm unprovided with proper
buildings will then command a tenant; and there will
be no want of capital for the purpose, as is evident
from the purchases in the Landed Estates Court and
the large deposits in the banks.f The tenant will then
say to the landlord, If you do not provide farm-
buildings as good as the English tenant has I will not
take the farm; lam willing to pay a fair rent, and
lam entitled to suitable buildings. I believe that time
will soon come, unless progress is retarded by inju-
dicious legislation.
As to the great agricultural improvements, the prac-
tice in Ireland and in England is very much the same.
The great drainage operations in England are always
* I understand that upon the estate of Lord Digby, which is in this (the
King’s County), and about thirty miles east, the percentage system is working
very well, but the tenantry are in a more advanced state than here.

Tinder a private Act. In Ireland, of course, they might
he carried on in a similar way; hut Ireland' has this
advantage: that, under a recent Act, she escapes Par-
liamentary expenses, and, I believe, also has a better
safeguard against abuses ku the supervision of the
Board of Works than she would have from an inquiry
before a Parliamentary Committee. Both in England
and in Ireland these works are carried out by the land-
lord. Some years ago very large works in different
parts of Ireland were undertaken and completed by
the landlords, through the instrumentality of the Board
of Works, but in many cases on a scale too large to
be remunerative. The improvements under the Loan
Acts are carried out by the owners. As to the smaller
improvements, they are carried out, Ist. By the land-
lord, who charges a percentage; 2nd. By the landlord
and tenant jointly ; 3rd. By the tenant, under some
agreement. This is precisely the same as in England.
There is a farther method, peculiar to England. The
landlord takes the farm into his own hands, drains it,
and improves it, and then looks out for a tenant. In
some parts of England whole estates have been thus
improved. In Ireland such a mode of proceeding,
though often the only one practicable, would be ob-
jected to. There is one disadvantage which attends
tile-draining in Ireland, as compared to England,—that
the results of it are but half as valuable : the value of
land being but one-half, the value of improvements
effected upon it can only be one-half. This seems
to be but little understood; but it is a very serious
impediment to tile-draining in Ireland and to land-
improvements in general where they have been carried
out prematurely. Attempts have often been made to
evade the expense of tile-draining by employing broken
x c


stones; this seldom lasts, as the .marshy districts in
Ireland usually abound with the Gallinella feruginia ,
and they speedily fill up the interstices of the stones.
There is an improvement, however, which tenants
sometimes carry out without assistance. In gome dis-
tricts there is a considerable area of land covered with
a thin stratum of peat; if chalk-gravel can he obtained
on the spot, by chalking the moor two or three crops
may at once be obtained which pay the whole expense
and even more. This is very similar to the case which
formerly occurred in Yorkshire. The farmers, failing
in their attempts to make the Wolds productive, con-
sulted Mr. Johnson, the agricultural chemist of Durham.
He at once pointed out the cause and the remedy. He
said, The soil contains sulphate of iron, which makes
it barren; by chalking it you convert the sulphate of
iron into sulphate of lime—a powerful manure—and
you will at once obtain a crop of turnips. You can
do that once, but no more ; the sulphate of iron will he
exhausted. The experiment was perfectly successful;
hut the farmers found, as Johnson had predicted, that
it could not he repeated. Neither can it be where there
is a thin surface of peat. In both cases crops can after-
wards he raised, provided there is an ample supply of
manure.
Very wild expectations have been held as to the
future improvement of the Irish hogs, principally, how-
ever, I think, by people who do not know what a hog
is. Mr. Mill coolly talks about draining and cultivating
them.* The only way of improving a hog that I know
* “ The Redford level produced little or nothing until artificially drained.

“ besides fuel.”—Mill’s ‘ Principle's of Political Economy.’ People’s Edition,
p. 141: also p. 112.


of is by cutting it away, and the time for cutting away
the bogs will not arrive till the coal of England is
exhausted.
In some 'places small bogs have been cut away for
fuel: but except where they are in the immediate
vicinity of a town a paying improvement can rarely, I
think, be made; and I never encourage a tenant to
make a non-paying improvement,—it only produces
disappointment. If a man wishes to grow grapes to
make wine, I do not advise him to build hothouses for
the purpose, but to go to some climate where grapes
grow without glass.
In the poorer districts it is not by sinking capital in
doubtful improvements that progress can be made, but
by applying with energy a capital which at best is
quite insufficient for the proper cultivation of the soil.
The great improvement required is better cultivation of
the good land and better crops, and for that there must
be more manure and more stock. Throughout a con-
siderable part of Ireland the farming is as fine as in
England, and the crops arc as good; and as for the
worst districts, we may find a parallel in parts of the
highlands of Scotland and in some parts of Wales.
There are occasionally small improvements, which
yearly tenants make without notice; this, of course, is
quite irregular. It always, however, has been our
practice, and I believe it is the practice of all the land-
lords in the' neighbourhood, when a tenant leaves his
farm to have these improvements valued, and the
amount paid in full; as the good tenant rarely leaves
his farm, and the bad tenant does not improve, the cost
is but trifling. I believe this practice is very general
throughout Ireland. It appears to me to be desirable
that it should bo universal; but to make the claim legal
c 2


would' be simply to authorise a man to treat another
man’s property as if it was his own, which would not
he quite honest. The consent of the owner should in
every instance he obtained, and it is not likely to he
refused. Some people are surprised that agricultural
capital should not he more abundant in Ireland : I do
not participate in that feeling. There has long been
much agitation, and that is unfavourable to the accumu-
lation of capital.
The Irish population with all their good qualities are
not frugal and industrious; their superiors were not so.
They were hospitable, so that Irish hospitality became
a byeword, and, although that had its evils, still there
was something more amiable —perhaps more noble—•
than in its opposite. The peasantry copied their betters.
Their liberality to the poor was unbounded. The exer-
cise of these good qualities was not without its draw-
backs, and produced results economically unfortunate.
Still, while the population continued thin, things went
on smoothly. As the population became denser, diffi-
culties arose: two millions and a half of people,* for
whom there was no employment, had to be sustained.
At present things are steadily improving. As to
capital, not agricultural, there seems to be no deficiency
whatever. The landed proprietors are multiplying
rapidly under the sales in the Landed Estates Court,
where every person who can command a small sum
may, if he pleases, become a proprietor of land. If
there was a demand for still smaller portions of land,
* This is under the mark. Lord Dufferin says, “In fact it would be no
“ exaggeration to say, that at this moment there are in Ireland nearly 300,000
“ families, or 1,500,000 souls, dependent upon the land, but for the application
“of whose industry to the cultivation of the soil there is no legitimate
“opening.”—Lord Dufferin’s ‘Enquiry,’ p. 34.


no doubt persons would be found to purchase and re-sell
at a profit; but Ido not believe such investments can
answer. In England small proprietors have become
much less numerous, which is politically perhaps to be
regretted ; but in the nature of things it was inevitable,
as the money price of land can be employed so much
more profitably as farming capital; and, even politi-
cally, the wealthy farmer well supplies the place of the
small proprietor.
Many are dissatisfied that leases are not freely given
by Irish landlords. In the absence of a lease, the land-
lord’s honour is the tenant’s security for fair dealing;
and, throughout the greater part of the province of
Ulster, where the tenant by old customs dating many
generations ago * enjoy certain privileges, that security
has been found sufficient. An attempt was made in
1852,- upon imperfect information, to improve that
security; but it was soon found that the opposite effect
would be produced, and it fell to the ground.
There is no doubt a strong objection to make leases;
every one well recollects the -ruin brought upon estates
by the subdivision of land, which took place under
them. There is, perhaps, no one thing which injured
the agricultural districts so much as such leases: the
O
estate of Lord Palmerston, already referred to, is a
sample. In 1828 an Act was passed to prevent sub-
division : in 1832 that Act was virtually repealed, it
•was said, under pressure from Mr. O’Connell —that was
the year of the Reform. Another Act was passed in
1860, containing a clause against subdivision ; there is

still a strong feeling of doubt as to whether that would
be effectual. There is also another objection. In the
counties there is an occupation-franchise; in many the
occupiers have swamped the owners, and members have
been returned to Parliament unconnected by property
with the county. As they have no standing'in the
county they must rest their claims upon the promise of
political services, and could they but persuade the occu-
piers that the land having been once let to them, it
would be possible to procure a cunningly-devised Act
which would break through the contract, and give them
without purchase some of the privileges of owner, the
prospect would be very tempting, and a better election-
cry there could not be. Some, no doubt, rather scru-
pulous, would say that the proceeding would not be
honest; it would at once occur to them that it was like
the case of the man who had lent his horse to his friend
to ride, and the friend having cut off the mane and tail,
brought in a large bill for improvements, and upon the
strength of it demanded joint ownership. However,
such scruples are often 'easily reasoned away, when
clever men undertake the task. The members thus re-
turned for the counties would find many powerful
auxiliaries in the boroughs; to this body of some thirty
or forty members would be added such men as have
expressed strong opinions adverse to the rights of the
landed proprietor, whether English or Irish. They
fear lest this powerful body, watching their opportu-
nity, taking advantage of the exigencies of party, might
succeed in inflicting upon them some grievous wrong.
I have no such fear. Parliament would never pass
such a measure : • it would affect English property almost
as soon as Irish. No special pleading would succeed in


devising an excuse for treating property .as one thing
in Ireland, and another thing in England, Wales, and
Scotland.
It cannot, however, be said that such apprehensions
are unreasonable; and so long as they exist, many will
be reluctant to make leases. They think if they have
to contend for their rights, it will be better to do so
with their hands untied. This apprehension with some
goes even further, extending not merely to the leasing,
but even to the letting of land. Some people ask the
question, is it not much safer to farm the land our-
selves? And, in point of fact, a great many small
proprietors, just as in England, have long farmed their
own estates and with, I understand, a favourable pecu-
niary result. It is very desirable that the farmers
should calmly consider all this, and ask themselves
whether it is just to blame the landed proprietors,
who, under these circumstances, hesitate to let on lease;
and whether, if they were in their place, they would
not perhaps do the same. They should also consider
whether there is not some inconsistency, when the laws
relating to property in land are practically the same in.
England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, to ask Parlia-
ment to make them in Ireland different.
It is, of course, the anxious wish, as it is the interest,
of the landed proprietors that the tenant-farmers should
be prosperous and contented; and the question is
continually asked, can anything be done ? is there
any real grievance which can be redressed? I have
been told that the tenant-farmer, having largely in-
creased the value of his farm, might be turned out
and so robbed of the price of his improvements. When
I ask, Can you point out such a case ? telling them that,
if they can, I will do my best to find out some remedy,


they are unable to do so; no such case has been pointed
out to me; but they. say it might occur. My answer
to them is usually to this effect: Because such a thing
is possible, you should he on your guard. The farm
you occupy is the property of the owner, let to you to
farm in the usual way; and if you wish to do more you
should obtain his consent.* It is especially the interest
of i the tenant-farmer that there should be no retrograde
O
movement which would discourage the investment of
capital in land. His interest is to have a wealthy
proprietory, able and anxious to assist him in getting
forward; the slightest approach to.exceptional legisla-
tion would he a warning to the capitalist to keep off.
Capitalists do not like to invest where there are people
ready to assail their rights and keep them in hot water,
and that accounts for the singular fact that, of the
twenty-five millions which have passed through the
Landed Estates Court, nine-tenths was the property of
Irishmen. That fact appears to he the more extra-
ordinary when we recollect that the same sum invested
in the agricultural districts of England produces so
different a result. In Ireland, the same sum will
purchase more than three times the area of land of
equal quality; besides there is the probability that in
time the value will rise much. In the manufacturing
districts, large fortunes are made every year; and the
first wish of the manufacturer is to become a landed
* Ido not of course mean it to be inferred that because I have heard of no such
case, no such cases have occurred; far from it. All I mean to say is that I believe
such cases arc rare. Where there are so many landlords and so many tenants
often transacting business in a loose way it is probable that full justice has not
always been done. To form an opinion in any particular case it is of course
necessary to hear both sides, and to recollect that injustice and illiberality are
two different things. As to the future the remedy is obvious, to do nothing
without an agreement in writing.


proprietor. In England, they have often long to wait
and always to pay a very large price. Were they to
purchase in Ireland, with ample means for effecting im-
provements on the largest scale, and with the habits of
business so essential to industrial progress, the comforts
of the peasantry would rapidly increase, and the whole
aspect of the country would soon become completely
changed. Fenianism has also had a most discouraging
effect. It was long at work, but with the gigantic
power of England it was safe to do that, which no other
European Government would have ventured to do—to
leave it long unnoticed. It had full time to spread its
poison in all directions, and it was not inactive; many
were captivated with the expectations held out to them.
In every country there are people who have nothing
to lose and are anxious for any change; but I can
scarcely believe that any farmer who was able to pay
his way could have been so mad as to enter into
partnership, both as to person and property, with the.
desperadoes who were thrown upon the world penny-
less at the termination of the American struggle. We
may talk sentimentally about the Record, about the
ancient history of Ireland; it is easy by going back
far enough into the history of any country to find
excuses for doing wrong. We may read one side of Irish
history, we may call everywhere defence aggression,
but we shall be unable to dignify Fenianism, whether
it be in Ireland or Canada, into anything more noble
than a conspiracy to effect a wholesale robbery. That
there is any wide-spread feeling of hostility to England
on the part of the Irish settlers in America, I do not
believe. Everything I hear goes to contradict that
assertion; and when we recollect that these settlers
went forth as from other countries to improve their


condition, which they have succeeded effectually in
doing, it would he strange if such a feeling existed.*
I have endeavoured, for the information of the tenant-
farmers of Ireland, to explain as clearly as I could their
position with respect to their brethren of England
and Scotland. They have opportunities of making
inquiry themselves on the spot, and I hope they will
do so and take nothing for granted which they have
heard from others. I think they will find, contrary
perhaps to their expectations, that they have perfect
fair play, and that the rights of property are exercised
in Ireland less fully than in any other part of the
United Kingdom.
It only remains to inquire whether the relation of
landlord and tenant could be improved by any measure
not open to the very grave objection of being excep-
tional.
It was suggested in the Report of the Devon Com-
mission in 1845, that power might be advantageously
given to the owner of an entailed estate to execute
improvements, and charge upon the estate in the shape
of a terminable annuity the sum so expended; if he
lived long enough the charge would be wiped off,
if not the portion remaining due would fall upon his
successor; the Montgomery Act in Scotland f was cited
as a precedent. As that Act is still law in Scotland,
extending it to Ireland would not be exceptional legis-
lation. With • the experience of Scotland, where it
seems to have worked very well, I confess I do not
think there would be much risk of serious abuse, and

under tlie provisions of that Act a landed proprietor
would have all the facilities for making improvements
which could reasonably he afforded to him. It will
however naturally suggest itself to many, that it would
he a retrograde movement to give facilities for en-
cumbering, where the estates have so recently heen
disencumbered ; and that unpaying improvements might
be undertaken here, which with the Scotch commercial
habits would not be thought of. This is all true, still
upon the whole I think it would be better to act upon
the Scotch precedent; recollecting that should mischief
arise, it cannot reach beyond certain very narrow
limits.
It is admitted on all hands that where a tenant makes
a bond Jide improvement, with the expressed sanction of
the landlord, he should be secured against all loss, by
an equitable agreement. It is also admitted that, all
necessary legal facilities should be afforded for making
such agreements. In the case of a limited owner, how-
ever, a difficulty arises: the estate upon which the im-
provement is to be effected can only be made answerable
during the life of the limited owner, and should he die,
before the charge has been wiped off by efflux of time,
his successors might eject the tenant without paying the
portion of the charge still remaining due. This is
possible, though in the highest degree improbable, where
there was a formal agreement to produce. If, however,
it was thought expedient to guard against it completely,
it would only be necessary to make the next in entail
answerable by extending the principle of the Montgomery
Act to such cases, with proper securities against fraud.
That difficulty disposed of, if a form of agreement was
provided by the Act, and everything was made clear, I
feel confident that wherever there was a proper case,


agreements would be freely made. The Act of 18GO
did not fail owing to any opposition from landowners; *
in the great drainage improvements there has been no
backwardness on the part of the landowners to under-
take the necessary responsibilities, nor yet in the ope-
rations under the Loan Acts. All the landowner
requires is to see that he is secured from imposition. I
do not however, I must candidly confess, expect great
results from any invitation which legislation can offer
to tenants willing to make improvements. At present,
however, there seems to be a strong wish for such legis-
lation, and as I think we may proceed as I have in-
dicated without much risk, it seems to me to be better
that the experiment should be tried. When it is
thoroughly understood that a farm cannot be properly
worked without suitable capital, public opinion will take
another direction, and the tenant-farmer will no longer
wish to diminish his circulating capital by transforming
a portion of it into fixed capital. Even where he has
his whole capital available, it rarely amounts to that
which the English tenant-farmer considers the minimum
the farm can be worked with effectively. Now so little
is the necessity of capital understood, at least in some
parts of Ireland, that the eldest son often inherits a farm
without capital; the farm has been left to him, and the
capital to other members of the family. As a general
rule I think it is best that substantial improvements
should be carried out by the landowners ; either alone, as
in the case of great drainage operations, or assisted by
the labour of the tenant-farmers at such times as they
can most conveniently afford it.
The landowners of the present day are not like those

of a former generation ; they are usually frugal and in
easy circumstances with money at command. The
difficulty is, not to find capital but a good commercial
investment; and were it not for the difficulty of making
improvements, which really pay, the balances in the
joint-stock hanks would not now amount to seventeen
millions. As I have already explained, the tenant,
according to the usual understanding when he takes the
farm, keeps everything in repair, and that is one reason
why the rent is so low ; and as at present a per centage
for buildings to replace the thatched cottages would be
usually oppressive, there is not an opening in that direc-
tion for a paying investment.
I have already sufficiently explained the reason why
landlords are generally afraid to make leases. They are
afraid that the law does not afford sufficient security
against the recurrence of the abuses by which Ireland
was almost hopelessly pauperised. They are afraid also
of what I may shortly call thimblerig legislation.
The first objection is probably the more cogent, while
it can be the more easily met; an Act like that of 1826,
prohibiting sub-letting and alienating, without the con-
sent of the landlord regularly obtained, would do much,
provided there were ample means for carrying it out
with certainty and promptness. If all reasonable ap-
prehension was thus removed there would be the alter-
native of an agreement or a lease in all such cases
where the tenant had capital to spare after duly pro-
viding for the wants of the farm. Ido not see that
legislation can do much more.
It has recently been the fashion with those who call
themselves original thinkers, to say that Irishmen are
unlike Englishmen in their habits, tastes, and prejudices,


and should be treated differently. I have no faith in
such philosophy; I believe that with Irishmen and
Englishmen like cause will produce like effect; and that
before very long under equal laws we shall see the
agriculture of Ireland as prosperous as that of England,
holding, as I believe that of England now does, the first
place in the agriculture of the world.
The observations which I have so far ventured to
make have been purely of a practical character. lam
not ignorant of the fact that part of the same ground
has been travelled over by others, who have gone deep
into what they call theory; pluming themselves on the
originality and profoundness of their speculations. J.
confess I attach little importance to their views; deep
and original .thinking on such subjects has to my
humble capacity some features in common with dream-
ing, and is often as unsubstantial. Real advances in
social science, have generally been obtained by collect-
ing facts carefully, and reasoning upon them accurately.
Mr. Mill may, I think, be taken as a fair exponent of
the opinions of such persons. He is master of a lucid
style which makes his works popular, and he reasons
with great acuteness. He is the author of a masterly
treatise on logic; his reasoning, however, is not therefore
necessarily unassailable, and we may criticize it without
presumption. In logic we see a display of great
ingenuity, but in practice it has little power. The
learned Provost Murray, who was master of logic in
every form, in his beautiful manual which is still a
text-book in the University of Dublin, thus speaks
dbubtingly as to the utility of logic : ;
“ Utrum hoccce ars per se revera aliquem prsestet
“ usum quidam dubitavere ; quoniam vero in authormn


“ insigniorum scriptis srnpe occurrant termini logici, hos
“ terminos explicates habere, ideoque et ipsius artis partes
“ prascipuas, omnino necessarinm videtur.”
Mill lias also entered tire lists, and distinguished
himself in the fascinating pursuit of mental science, and
if he has followed an ignis fatuus, so have others, and
no harm has been done. If Brown has knocked down
Read, Sir William Hamilton knocked down Brown,
Mill knocked down Sir William Hamilton, and McCosh
knocked down Mill; no bones have been broken. Not
so in political economy, we there handle edged tools,
and if we are not careful we may do great mischief; if
we err and lead others into error, serious consequences
may follow. In reading Mr. Mill’s political economy
we must be especially on our guard. In political
economy we have little of the clearness and certainty of
the exact sciences; if, therefore, the writer has any
strong bias he may be led into wrong conclusions. Mr.
Mill, as we know, is a politician of what is called the
Radical school, strongly prejudiced against society as it
is, with perhaps a certain leaning towards socialistic
institutions, and with certain views which some may
consider revolutionary. To mix up such speculations in
a treatise on the principles of a science was injudicious,
especially in th q people’s edition.
The superficial reader, to the deep regret, no doubt, of
Mr. Mill, might thus easily be led into error : he would
naturally suppose from the place in which he found
them, that such speculations were impressed with the
stamp of genuine science. It is very much as if in a
treatise on applied mathematics we were to introduce
certain speculations about divers schemes for perpetual
motion ; or, perhaps, an essay on the overthrow of the
Newtonian philosophy. Mr. Mill, before he considers


the relation of landlord and tenant, very properly pre-
pares the way by explaining the nature of productive
and unproductive labour. He explains clearly how
labour with the head may often be more severe, and
much more productive than labour with the hands.
There is, however, a third description of labour to
which he does not allude —I mean that which is neither
productive nor unproductive, but destructive. When
the brain is employed to set man against man, class
against class, to produce a feeling of discontent which
leads to apathy and idleness, that labour is obviously
destructive. As an example of unproductive labour
Mr. Mill instances the clergy in general* : this is, I
think, a mistake. If a clergyman by his teaching
increases the industry, the frugality, and the morality
of the community, his labour must be productive.
We now come to a proposition of Mr. Mill which
requires to be carefully considered. If true it is one
which cannot fail to produce discontent amongst the
working classes in general, discontent directed against
landlords, manufacturers, merchants, fund-holders, and
in short against all who have incomes to spend. The
proposition is, “f Demand for commodities is not demand
“ for labour. The demand for commodities determines
“ in what particular branch of production the labour
“ and capital shall be employed; it determines the
“ direction of the labour, not the more or less of the
“ labour itself, or of the maintenance or payment of
“ the labour.” Again, “ This theorem that to purchase
* To a religions person the saving of a soul must appear a far more
important service than the saving of a life; but ho will not therefore call a
missionary or a clergyman productive labourers unless they teach, as the South
Sea missionaries have in some cases done, the arts of civilization in addition to
the doctrines of their religion.— ‘ Principles of Political Economy,’ p. 31.
f Mills’ ‘Political Economy. Fundamental Propositions on Capital.’


“ produce is not to employ labour, that the demand for
“ labour is constituted by the wages which precede the
“ production and not by the demand which may exist
“ for the commodities resulting from the production, is
“ a proposition which greatly needs all the illustration
u which it can receive.” Again, “ I conceive that a
“ person who buys commodities and consumes them
“ himself does no good to the labouring class, and that
“it is only by what he abstains from consuming and
“ expends in direct payment to labourers, in exchange
“ for labour, that he benefits the labouring classes, or
“ adds anything to the amount of their employment.” I
believe that this theorem, which crops up in various
places, is founded in error. The truth seems to be that
the capital of the manufacturer is required to commence
production, but that production cannot go on unless it
is replaced continually by the capital of the purchaser.
To make this quite clear let us consider the question in
its most elementary shape.
Case Ist. Suppose a man, who possesses twelve thou-
sand quarters of corn, employs with it men for twelve
months in digging pits and filling them up; at the
end of the year the labourers have had full employ-
ment for twelve months.
Case 2nd. Suppose the man expends the twelve
thousand quarters in employing men to make bricks, he
has the bricks, and the result to the labourer is the
same.
Case 3rd. Suppose, instead of employing the labourers
himself, he employs the brickmaker, undertaking to
purchase the bricks monthly. The brickmaker to begin
with must have one thousand quarters of corn, as his
capital, at the end of one month his corn is all eaten,
and the purchaser taking the finished bricks pays for
D


them with a thousand quarters of corn, and so the brick-
maker is enabled to proceed as before. At the end of
the year the purchaser has paid for the bricks twelve
thousand quarters of corn. The brickmaker has re-
ceived back his thousand quarters of corn, of course,
with interest for the year which the purchaser has pro-
vided, and the labourers have had as before twelve
thousand quarters : so that the capitalist has contributed
merely a temporary loan, while the purchaser has con-
tributed the whole corn consumed.
Yet Mr. Mill says that a man who purchases commo-
dities does no good to the labourers. This he endeavours
to make out by elaborate reasoning of a very subtle
character, which amounts however to this, that should
the brickmaker not secure a purchaser he will not make
the bricks, and the labourers, of course, will be thrown
out of employment; but having a thousand quarters of
corn he will go elsewhere and invest it in some other
manufacture, and so be able to employ the workmen:
but then the purchaser will be as necessary as before;
without him the capitalist may give his thousand
quarters of corn to the workmen to eat, and there is an
end of it; he will not be able to employ a man after-
wards. He has, however, another alternative; he may
take his thousand quarters of corn out of the country,
which is what happens every day, and the labourers
thus cease to be employed. I need hardly say that for
the bricks we may put goods of every kind throughout
the kingdom, and for the brickmaker, the capitalist
manufacturers, and for the labourers, the working-
classes in the widest sense; the purchaser will represent
all who spend. Mr. Mill says the spending class do not
benefit the working class; let them cease to spend, and
the capital which they continually replace will at once


leave the country, and the workpeople will be without
employment. Mill says that the capitalists and labourers,
failing demand, may work for themselves, till every
want of the labourer is supplied; will the capitalist
sacrifice his capital ? Mill has a very easy way of
ignoring the question of meurn and tuum. Finally he
winds up his argument by taking as a reductio ad
absurdam the case of the poor-law, and he says, “If it
“ be equally for the benefit of the labouring class
“ whether I consume my means in the form of things
“ purchased for my own use, or set aside a portion in
“ the shape of wages, or alms, for their direct consump-
“ tion, on what ground can the policy be justified of
“ taking any money from me to support paupers ? ”
The mistake here, I conceive, is in- assuming that
paupers are a part of the working classes. The whole
of this fallacy, as I conceive, runs through a considerable
portion of Mill’s work. I will not follow it up, however,
as I am not writing a treatise on political cconorhy; I
will only just guard myself from being supposed to
place productive and unproductive expenditure on the
same footing. The former has a tendency to increase
the wealth of the country ; the latter to keep things as
they are; but even in the latter case as many who
are engaged in providing the objects of unproductive
expenditure make fortunes, the wealth of the country
is somewhat increased.
Wo have hitherto spoken of the whole kingdom; if
we localise the question we shall be enabled to set it in
the clearest point of view. Let us take for example a
town, and let that town be Brighton. In Brighton
We have landed proprietors, manufacturers, fundholders,
capitalists, all living on their incomes: and we have the
working classes of every grade, from the common
d 2


labourer to the large shopkeeper. Suppose the people
of wealth not to spend, or, which is the same thing, to
leave the town; the squares and terraces would be
deserted, so would the houses in the streets occupied
by all who have independent incomes; the labourers,
artizans and shopkeepers would have the town to
themselves. According to Mr. Mill the labourers, arti-
zans and shopkeepers would lose nothing by the change
of circumstances. I apprehend that even their worthy
representative, who, in treating this subject, follows
Mr. Mill, would find it difficult to reason them out of
their senses.*
The fact is that the interests of the different classes
of society are not antagonistic, as some would have it
believed, but closely knitted together, protected by
great natural laws which we perhaps but imperfectly
see, working silently but surely where they are not
rudely interfered with by the hand of the despot, or the
still worse tyranny of unbridled democracy. When we
consider the great fact that the supplies of such a town
as London adjust themselves without any care on our
part, so that there is rarely too much or too little of any-
thing, and that without any help from the “ thinkers; ”
while all their schemes in the shape of Communism,
Owenism, Socialism, Fourierism have helplessly been
discarded: we ought to feel the full force of the truth
that man’s faculties are limited, and that presumption
and arrogance are not the characteristics of true philos-
ophy. It follows of course from Mr. Mill’s reasoning, if
correct, that absenteeism is no evil; it signifies nothing
whether a man spends his income at home or abroad.
* “A demand for commodities is not a demand for labour.”—‘Manual of
Political Economy,’ by Henry Fawcett, M.P., p. 24. (


In pure mathematics, in solving a problem, it is useful
to consider whether the result is probable. In applied
mathematics, it is still more necessary to appeal to com-
mon sense; how much more necessary is it, in political
economy where the reasoning is often loose and obscure ?
A learned philosopher wishing to determine trigono-
metrically the height of Nelson’s Pillar, having obtained
the necessary data with a tape and sextant, worked out
the problem, and found that the top of the Pillar was
ten feet below the surface of the ground : he was a wise
man, and not resting satisfied with the result he re-
turned to his figures, and found them wrong. Surely
when a conclusion so absurd is arrived at, as that money
expended in a town or country does it no good, it is
time to re-examine our premises. If,a man employs
his rent in kind, say a thousand quarters of corn, and
exchanges it for goods and services in England, Eng-
lishmen eat the corn; when he takes it abroad and
exchanges it for the goods and services of foreigners,
foreigners eat the corn, which is not quite the same
thing. If for corn we put money we have the same
result, but in a more complicated form.
From the question of absenteeism we pass to another
affecting the relation of landlord and tenant. I mean
the actual management of land, under our proprietory
system. The common expression that landlords con-
sume a definite proportion of the produce of their
estates conveys a very erroneous idea. What a land-
lord consumes, be his estate large or ‘ small, is very
much what other men consume; the word should be
distribute. Now, how does the owner of a large estate,
provided he is not an absentee, distribute the portion of
the produce which falls to his share ? Some part per-
haps goes to the support of the tradesmen, and labourers


who keep "up his house and park, and the steddings of
his tenant farmers; another part to his servants, and to
the staff which he employs to cultivate the home farm,
to the tradesmen who supply goods, to the collector of
rates and taxes, and to his various charitable contribu-
tions, public and private. As to the remainder, if he
sees no eligible investment upon his estates, he places it
in the funds, which is in fact lending it to the mer-
chants and manufacturers to be employed productively.
The landlord is thus the centre of a little community,
who have all that is necessary for their decent main-
tenance, and even if the landlord distributes injudiciously,
there are self-righting principles, which prevent things
from going very wrong, which restrain the perturbations
within certain fixed limits, and restore things again to
a normal state. Outside this circle are the tenant-
farmers, enjoying their own share, the remainder of the
produce, which they have raised by their capital and
industry : men of whom England may justly be proud.
Under this system the produce of the land is admittedly
greater than under any system yet tried.
Now Mr. Mill proposes, following in the steps of the
French Revolution,* to break up the large properties,
by enacting that no one should inherit more than a
sufficiency for a decent maintenance: he thus creates
many small landlords, men with leisure, to do what ? to
work? No. They can live without work, but with
leisure to meditate. “In an age like the present when
“ a general reconsideration of all first principles is felt
“to be inevitable.”! But what is to become of the
tenant-farmers, the pride of the nation, the men who
have made English agriculture what it is, the first in

the world; not by meditating, but by working hard ;
they are to be squeezed out , there is no room for them in
the new system. But Mr. Mill, naturally alarmed lest
the great manufacturers should take fright, seeing
their next neighbour’s house attacked, says to them,
you need not fear, you have a perfect right to do" what
you please with your own.
“ No man made the land,” and there is the great
distinction between the millowner and the landowner:
but will Mr. Mill tell us what man did make ? it is very
little use, till then, to tell us what man did not make.
We have always been taught that man made nothing,
not even one particle of matter ; and Mr. Mill has
recognised this fact in the beginning of his book,'*
though he seems now to overlook it.
But what has made the land valuable ? It is the
labour of man on it and around it. What is the value
of an acre of land now part of the Indian’s hunting-
field ? A sum inappreciable. And what is the value
of an acre in the city of London ? what is the value of
an acre of land in the centre of the town of Melbourne ?
and what was its value thirty years ago ? what has
made the difference ? The labour of man; and it is
simply the labour of man which has made the material
in the shape of a mill, and its contents, valuable. Land
has been made private property since the beginning of
civilization, it has been continually bought, sold, and
exchanged for property of every kind; and are we to
be told that property in land is. to be held less sacred
than property in mills and factories ? Land is the

“ produce one particle of matter. To weave broad-cloth is but to re-arrange in
“a peculiar manner the properties of wool.”


common inheritance of man, so is property of every kind
which the world contains.
But is it not solemn trifling to raise such questions ?
If, as Mr. Mill has said oracularly, the time has come
for the reconsideration of first principles, here we have
the first-fruits of that hopeful undertaking.
Since Mr. Mill tells us that he has submitted his
views on the subject of inheritance “ for the judgment of
thinkers,” and as I have not the honour of belonging to
that modest fraternity, I will make no further remarks.
As, however, Mr. Mill’s views respecting property
in land, and the rights of private property in general,
are not for the selected few, “ the thinkers,” but for the
masses, appearing as they do in the people’s edition of
his work, I may be permitted slightly to advert to them.
Mr. Mill says, “But it is not by comparison with the
“ present bad state of society that the claims of com-
“ munism can be estimated.” * From that and other
passages it is evident that Mr. Mill is much dissatisfied
with society as it exists. He further says : “Ho society
“ in which excentricity is a matter of reproach can be
“in a wholesome state.” I suppose he means that no
one should be reproached, however wild and extravagant
his views, however repugnant to all our notions of right
or wrong, however opposed to the institutions of civil-
ized society. “To judge of the final destination of
“ the institution of property, we must suppose every-
“ thing rectified, which causes the institution to work
“ in a manner opposed to that equitable principle, of
“ proportion between remuneration and exertion, on
“ which in every vindication of it that will bear the
“ light, it is assumed to be grounded.” y And again he
* Page 130,
f Page 128.


says, “ And the worst and most unjust arrangement
“ which could be made of these points, under a system
“ aiming at equality, would be so far short of the
“ inequality and injustice with which labour, not to
“ speak of remuneration, is now apportioned as to be
“ scarcely worth counting in the comparison.” * From
all this it appears that Mr. Mill evidently holds that
the right to private property at present rests on a
doubtful title. The highwayman may say to the
traveller, you cannot show me that the right to your
property rests upon “ that equitable principle of propor-
“ tion, between remuneration and exertion, upon which
“ every vindication of it which will bear the light is
“ assumed to be grounded.” You are rich and lam poor,
and things are most unequally and unjustly apportioned,
as Mr. Mill says: I must therefore have your purse.
I believe, however, that the right of man to that
which is his own rests upon a more solid basis than
any to be found in Mr. Mill’s work; it appears to
me to rest upon the principle of right and wrong
implanted in our nature, and to which expression is
given in the command, that thou shalt not steal. But
is there no danger in such discussions ? may not
men’s principles be gradually undermined by them ? if
we are told continually that “La propriety est le
vol,” may we not at length become in principle a
robber ?
Mr. Mill enters into copious details as to peasant
proprietors on the Continent. In a political or economic
point of view there can be no possible objection to
peasant proprietors; but from what I have heard, I
* -Page 128.


believe that the peasant proprietory system, from the
resistance it opposes to emigration, is in some districts
attended with the greatest evils. Whether, however, it
be good or bad, it cannot long continue in an old
country which is large, rich, and free; and for this
reason, that a peasant proprietor by selling his land,
and becoming a tenant-farmer, will quadruple his
income; and thus, as society progresses, the peasant
proprietor becomes gradually transformed into the
tenant-farmer; a change I think very much for the
better. Of course, the cultivation of the tenant pro-
prietor on the Continent varies much; it is best, where
a variety of little crops are raised; but in the case of
ordinary crops it seems to me to be very inferior to
English agriculture; and throughout the districts of
France, where the peasant proprietors abound, the
yield, I believe, is scarcely one half of that usual in
England. Mr. Mill speaks with great enthusiasm of
the wonders effected by peasant proprietors, and the
“ magic of property.” He quotes various authors, who,
with the exception of Young, appear to me to be
enthusiasts who only look to the bright side. Young’s
testimony, where favourable, applies to a very small
area, in which a kind of garden cultivation seems to
have been carried on; but it is to the Channel Islands
that Mr. Mill especially appeals for evidence. He says,
“ The evidence of the beneficial operation of peasant
“ properties is of so decisive a character that I cannot
“ help adding, to the numerous citations already made,
“ part of a description of the economical condition of
“ those islands, by a writer who combines personal
“ observation with an attentive study of the informa-
“ tion afforded by others, Mr. William Thornton, in


“ his ‘ Plea for Peasant Proprietors,’ &c. &c., a book,
“ which by the excellence both of its materials and of
“ its execution, deserves to be regarded as the standard
“ work on that side of the question.” *
Now the Channel Islands are within a stone’s throw,
and every one may go there and judge for himself; he
may there see, if it is to he seen at all, what the “ Magic
of Property, which turns sand into gold,” has effected.
I went there a few months ago, and traversed the Island
of Guernsey in all directions. I found the agriculture
reasonably good, where the soil was good; and the bad
land very much in a state of nature. This rather
surprised me, considering the high rent of land, four
pounds an acre; but I soon found the people had other
employment much more profitable than improving bad
land. Many were engaged in fishing for the London
market; others were quarrying stones for the London
streets ; the harbour of St. Sampson was full of shipping
waiting for a freight of stone ; others were engaged in
shipbuilding, and there were several fine ships on the
stocks; shipbuilders find it worth while to import
timber from England, labour is so much cheaper than
in the English ports. Others were collecting seaweed
for manure, for they say “ point de vraic, point de haut-
gard ” —“ no seaweed, no corn-yard.” In fact, manure
is the great want with the small farmers, and seaweed
supplies that. The outskirts of the town of St. Peter’s
Port and the neighbourhood about it, was studded with
villas, indicating incomes of perhaps a thousand a year :
they were the residences partly of the mercantile classes,
and partly of gentlemen with independent incomes, who
* Mill’s ‘ Principles of Political Economy,’ p. 107.


had made Guernsey their place of residence. A large
harbour was in progress of construction out of local
funds. Full of Mr. Mill’s book, and having a vivid
recollection of the many passages, in which he expatiates
on “ the Magic of Property turning sand into gold,” I
was puzzling myself to find out the modus operand! of
the process, which could produce such wealth as I saw
around St. Peter’s Port, quite like the neighbourhood
of a rich English town ; when, after asking I fear many
foolish questions, the fact came out that there was not
an estate in the island of above forty acres, there were
few above twenty, and the remainder ranged from
twenty to one. Of these little estates held by compli-
cated tenures, some were in fee, others paying high rents,
but it was quite clear that forty acres, however culti-
vated, would not support a St. Peter’s Port villa. It
was not from agriculture that the wealth came. The
peasantry are frugal, as all the French are, and they
are industrious ; how well could it be otherwise in the
midst of so much industry ? But if any one wishes to
see the peasant proprietor pur et simple , he has only
to go to Alderney; he will there perhaps see as much
industry, or rather as little, as in the wilds of Connaught.
He will see there the Guernsey farmer occupying and
tilling the land of the Alderney peasant proprietor;
and the Guernsey fisherman bringing his fish to the
shores of Alderney. Even with the help of the
Guernsey farmer they do not grow wheat sufficient for
their own consumption, and all their meat comes from
France. They seem to spend their time tending their
Alderney cows. Mow a word as to the statistics of
Guernsey. Mr. Mill says : “Of the efficiency and pro-
“ ductiveness of agriculture, on the small properties of


“ the Channel Islands, Mr. Thornton produces ample
“ evidence, the result of which he sums up as follows :
“ ‘Thus it appears that in the two principal Channel
“ Islands the agricultural population is in the one
“ twice, and in the other three times as dense as in
“ Britain; there being in the latter country only one
“ cultivator to twenty-two acres of cultivated land,
“ while in Jersey there is one to eleven, and in
“ Gruernsey one to seven acres. Yet the agriculture of
“ these islands maintains besides cultivators, non-agri-
“ cultural populations, respectively four and five times
“ as dense as that of Britain.’ ” *
Now the more I traversed the island backwards
and forwards, the more satisfied I felt that the pro-
duce could not sustain the population or anything like
it, and that the statement in the passage I have above
quoted, that “ the agriculture of the islands maintains,
“ besides cultivators, non-agricultural populations re-
“ spectively four and five times as dense as those of.
“ Britain,” was directly contrary to fact. He goes on
further to say: “This difference does not arise from any
“ superiority of soil or climate possessed by the Channel
“ Islands, for the former is naturally poor, and the
“ latter is not better than in the southern counties of
“ England. It is owing entirely to the assiduous care
“ of the farmers, and to the abundant use of manure.” f
The whole of this appearing to me to be a complete
misstatement, I inquired therefore whether there were
any published statistics, and was at length referred to
‘ Daily’s Agriculture of the Channel Islands,’ published
in Gruernsey. I subjoin the statistical returns for the two
islands:—

The Population of the Channel Islands, according to the Census of
1851, is as follows:

Of those the inhabitants of the
town parish of St. Peter’s Port,

17,043
Alderney 3,333

From these returns it will be perceived that Guernsey
with a population of 29,733 imports 34,330 quarters of
wheat, and exports none. Imports 1297 oxen, exports
41. Imports 4980 sheep, exports 40.
With these imports, Guernsey cannot stand much in
need of corn raised at home; and although the peasantry
require very little animal food, the wealthy inhabitants
of St. Peter’s Port and neighbourhood consume the
usual quantity. Therefore a supply of meat has to be
provided, in addition to the oxen and sheep imported,
and consequently meadow, clover, and turnips, are the


principal crops. In Jersey it is very much the same,
so soon are fables dissipated by a little statistics.
The peasant proprietor is often employed as a lever,
by those who seek to turn society npside down; we see
how weak that lever is when the truth is known.
Mr. Mill is so enamoured of peasant proprietors, that
he proposed to plant a pauper colony in England.'* His
plan was to take unenclosed common lands and divide
them into farms of five acres, and thus make so many
peasant proprietors : but the common lands are not the
best, and it is easy to see what condition these people
would be soon in. The project was not countenanced.
Mr. Mill now says: “ I have left the preceding
“ paragraphs as they were written, since they remained
“ true in principle though it is no longer urgent to
“ apply their specific recommendations to the present
“ state of this country. The extraordinary cheapening
“ of the means of transport, which is one of the great
“ scientific achievements of the age, and the knowledge
“ which nearly all classes of the people have now
“ acquired, or are in the way of acquiring, of the
“ condition of the labour market, have opened up a
“ spontaneous emigration from these islands to the new
“ countries, beyond the Ocean, which does not tend to
Ci diminish, but to increase.” f
Mr. Mill says in fact that his plan of treatment was
all right, but that things are now changed, and that
symptoms are no longer urgent.
lam afraid these reasons will not do; steam has made
the passage quicker, but not cheaper, and the emigrant’s
time is not of much value; as to the labour market, the
post is as before. This reminds me of the doctor whose
* Page 231.
f Page 232.


treatment consisted in starving and bleeding, which he
subsequently changed for food and stimulants; and
being asked for an explanation, said, “my practice
remains true in principle,” but the human constitution
is changed. The doctor’s treatment did not fail because
the human animal was difficult to kill: Mr. Mill’s
treatment has not failed, simply because it was not tried.
Not satisfied with prescribing for England, he very
generously prescribes for Ireland also, and a similar
remedy. He denounces, I think not very modestly, the
measures the government of the day had taken to meet
the difficulties of the Irish famine; a Poor Law and
temporary employment. It happens, however, that the
government were right, and Mr. Mill wrong. He says :
“ since these words were written events unforeseen by
“ any one have saved the English rulers of Ireland from
“ the embarrassments which would have been the just
“ penalty of their indifference and want of foresight.” *
Mr. Mill did not foresee them, and of course nobody
else ought to have done so; but it was otherwise. They
were very generally foreseen, and it was upon that
foreknowledge that the Government acted. There
had been long a self-supporting emigration, much
money was annually remitted to relatives, and it was
obvious that it only required time to allow the full
development of that system under increased pressure.
The efforts of Government were directed to gaining time
by giving employment on the roads; and so were those
of the landed proprietors, by undertaking drainage
works to the amount of several millions; by giving
employment on the land, usually unremunerative, and
by laying on the requisite poor-rate.
E

As to the famine itself, it was long foreseen as a not
improbable event by political economists and others.
I well recollect its being spoken of with dread by
Maltbus, Ricardo, Senior, and others; and Mr. McCul-
lagh,* in his Political Economy, gives a pretty distinct
intimation on the subject; but what could be done ?
Nothing would have been of the slightest avail but
forced emigration on the largest scale followed by con-
solidation of farms. Lord Palmerston would not permit
the experiment of forced emigration to he tried. | Lord
Leconfield, with the resources of a large English estate,
made the attempt. He was strong enough to overhear
opposition, and he had sufficient moral courage to withr
stand the obloquy to which he was subjected: he
succeeded. When the famine came, the people saw that
his tenants escaped without injury, and men’s minds
were changed.
I do not think it necessary to follow Mr. Mill into
further details; were Itodo so I could scarcely hope to
he accompanied by the reader. The practical part of
the subject, the more important by far, has been taken
first, and an attempt has been made to describe the
actual state of Ireland, viewed especially from the
midland counties. With every little change of longi-
tude and latitude, or of local circumstances, things some-
what change, just as in other parts of the United
Kingdom. It has been shown that the agricultural 'dis-
* After alluding to the partial failure of the potato crop in 1821, and the
danger of a recurrence of such a calamity in a more aggravated form, he says:
“ In a period of scarcity men cannot go from a low to a high level, they must
“ always go from a higher to a lower. But to the Irish this is impossible; they
“ have already reached the lowest point in the descending scale, and dearth is
“to them attended with all the horrors of famine.”—p. 349. (‘ The Principles
of Political Economy,’ by J. R. M c Cullagh, Esq. 1825.)
f Kincaid’s evidence, before quoted.


tricts of Ireland are still much more densely peopled
than the agricultural districts of England; and this
conclusion has been drawn, that till there has been
further emigration, we cannot hope that the peasantry
will he as happy and prosperous as we should wish
them to he. It has been also shown that till the farms
are of a sufficient size, no great improvement can take
place either in the farm buildings, or in the annual
return from the soil. Neither can the system become
general, under which the landlord provides the farm
buildings, and the tenant-farmer the circulating capital,
the working power being supplied by the tenant-
farmer’s family and the regular labourers. The change,
however, to this system must be gradual, and cannot he
brought about beneficially by violent means. I have
endeavoured to show that Ireland is progressing rapidly,
and that it would be unwise in obedience to a popular
cry, however originating, to take any measure attended
with the risk of retarding progress, or even perhaps of
producing a movement in the opposite direction. The
enlightened physician trusts very much to the opera-
tion of natural laws, benevolently designed to produce
action in the direction of health; so in social science,
the wise statesman, trusting to a similar agency, rejects
without hesitation the artificial contrivances of empiri-
cism. The recommendation of the Devon Commission,
in favour of the extension of the Montgomery Act to
Ireland, appeared to me to he attended with little risk,
and therefore I have ventured to support it; being the
law in Scotland, it could not be considered exceptional
legislation. With the. powers under that Act, there
would he no difficulty in enabling the landlord and
tenant to enter securely into agreement for making all
necessary improvements, and the difficulty as to leases
e 2


would be in a great measure removed by making sub-
division and alienation without the consent of the land-
lord impossible. When agitation has ceased to flourish
there will be an opening for the English manufacturer
with his skill and capital. Till now there has been
every effort to make England hated by the Irish
peasant. It was a difficult task as there was nothing
but strong language to work with ; t the more intelligent
of the peasantry could not but see that facts told a
different story. They were aware that the law of
landlord and tenant was the same, that the English
markets were open to them, that they had-access to the
same sources of employment as the English labourers,
that the sea which divides the two islands really but
unites them closer; still there can be no doubt that a
strong impression was made.
Passing from the practical to the theoretical view of
the question, and taking Mr. Mill as the able exponent
of extreme opinions, his reasoning has been examined
very briefly, but perhaps sufficiently. As to the rela-
tion of jjroducer and purchaser, it has been contended
that there is no reason why they should not be perfectly
good friends, with interests concurring; and as to the
relation of landlord and tenant, that any of the changes
proposed by Mr. Mill would be attended with mischief
to all parties. I have not blinked any question. As
to the arrangements made by Stein in Prussia about
feudal tenures, Mr. Mill only alluded to them, and I
only do the same. Stein operated upon feudal tenures,
and there is no material of the kind in these islands,
nor has there been for centuries. Neither have I said
anything especially as to the condition of the labourer,
because I fear that the co-operative system is Utopian,
and would fail in practice; and as to education, every


one is agreed as to the importance of it, that industrial
education especially which would secure the Dorset-
shire labourer a hearty welcome in the manufacturing
districts. I have questioned Mr. Mill’s opinions with
perfect freedom, some may -say perhaps with too little
ceremony ; if he had expressed himself with any degree
of reserve or diffidence, I should have felt under a
similar restraint; hut in speaking of governments, in
speaking of classes, in speaking of those who differ from
him, he speaks without constraint; he lays down his
opinions dogmatically, as if no one had a right to ques-
tion them, as if they were the sayings of a Superior
Spirit, whose mission was to set all things right.
