PLAIN & PRACTICAL LETTERS
WORKING PEOPLE,
CONCERNING
AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, AND CALIFORNIA,
And Shoiving the Best Country to which to Emigrate,
The writer of these notes desires to
place before the public, and especially
the working classes, some account of
the present state of the Colonies of
Australia and New Zealand, the Pacific
Islands and the State of California.
The aim and intention of these practi-
cal notes is to divert labour into the
most profitable channels ; to show which
country offers the greatest inducement
and the most profitable employment to
the mechanic, labourer, and, in a word,
to all who depend upon their own exer-


tions for a living. It is desired, too, to
show where the struggle for a living is
reduced to a minimum ; where you can
live in comfort, and place a better
future before your children than the
majority of persons can hope to do in
these islands.
NEW SOUTH WALES.
I went from London to New South
Wales, and I resided in that colony for
more than two years, during which time
I travelled over the greater part of the
colony. Sydney, the capital, is a large
and important city ; a lover of the
picturesque would consider much of it
beautiful, and it is amply supplied with
various places of amusement and abounds
in technical schools, libraries, and other
seats of learning. The parks, gardens
and swimming-baths are all within easy
reach of the city, the population of
which is now 332,709. The climate is
very fine, and food is abundant and
cheap ; clothing is about the same price
as in England, but house rent is much
higher. The rate of wages paid to skilled


workmen varies from eight to eleven
shillings per day, labourers receive seven
shillings per day, and the eight hours
system is the general rule throughout
the colony. Bricklayers and stonemasons
receive higher wages and generally fare
better than other tradesmen. Many
of the industries, however, are in a
depressed condition, especially the iron
foundries and coach and cabinet-making
trades ; the cabinet makers blame the
European furniture, and the American
carriages and buggies have left very little
work for the coach builder ; the ready-
ground colours, put up by American
firms for the use of carriage painters,
are quickly displacing the English dry
colours throughout Australia. Of course
it is not worth while now to tear a leaf
out of the American book. The wool
warehouses in Sydney are immense
structures; many of the importing ware-
houses in Pitt Street are large and
handsome buildings, and the streets and
wharves generally present a busy scene
of great activity, and are crowded with
well-dressed people. It must be con-
fessed, however, that there are many


idle men in the city, and the unemployed
are far too numerous. There is little or
no inducement for carpenters to go out.
The Government meet the unemployed in
a very liberal spirit, offering free railway
passes to all who can obtain employ-
ment in the country. There are, I think,
far too many young men in Sydney
without any particular calling, but were
they to take up some useful occupation,
or go up country, they would probably
get along better than they do hanging
about the streets of Sydney.
The northern part of the colony con-
tains the large and populous towns of
Newcastle, the seat of the great coal
industry, and Maitland. These are within
easy distance of Sydney, and are reached
at a trifling expense. From Maitland,
away up as far as the borders of Queens-
land, excepting the towns in close prox-
imity to the railway, the country is very
sparsely settled, and while the rich soil
and splendid climate of New South
Wales offer every inducement to the
farmer with a small capital, it gives very
poor encouragement to the man with
naught but his labour to sell. The


southern parts of the colony are princi-
pally devoted to sheep and cattle raising,
but there are the large and important
towns of Bathurst and Goulburn. The
Illawarra district contains, perhaps, some
of the best land in the colony; it is
mostly taken up by dairy farmers, the
milk and butter are sold in Sydney. The
chief towns of the Illawarra district are
built near the coast, and steamers call in
daily from Sydney. The colony generally
affords employment to any man willing to
take the first thing offering, but I think
that men going to the colony with a
little money, and able to do business
themselves, always succeed the best.
VICTORIA.
Melbourne is the capital, with a popu-
lation of nearly 400,000, including more
than one thousand Chinese; it is con-
sidered to be the finest city in Australia.
All the conveniences and requirements
necessary to a large city, including many
splendid gardens, and plenty of places of
amusement and instruction, are to be


found in every direction; the clothing
warehouses are immense establishments,
employing many hundreds of young
women, and employment is easily ob-
tained by tailors. Most working-men
wear tailor-made clothing, and the
people in general dress very well. The
iron foundries are very large, and the
carriage building trades are far ahead of
many other colonies; the vast wool
warehouses, breweries, and carrying
companies find employment for many
thousands of men. Some important
industries are also carried on in the sur-
rounding suburbs ; employment is easily
obtained by butchers, and by all trades
for serving the daily wants of the people.
General servants readily find situations at
good wages ; employment in all branches
is perhaps more readily obtained here than
in Sydney at the present time. Many
men indeed say that the wages are
higher, but as the majority of colonial
workmen are travellers, many of them
having the geography of Australia at
their finger ends, and as Melbourne is
within easy reach of Sydney for the
trifling sum of ten shillings, it may be


concluded that the wages are very much
the same in both cities.
Ballarat, with a population of 41,110,
is the largest inland town in the colony,
the railway and locomotive workshops
are the leading industries ; there are
many iron foundries and several agri-
cultural machine shops. Men engaged in
these industries find readier employment
than most other tradesmen ; of course
there are many other industries, more or
less extensive, in which employment can
be obtained, and then Ballarat is within
easy distance of Sandhurst or Geelong,
but neither of these towns has the
go-ahead character of Ballarat. Much
good wine is made in these districts, and
vegetable growing is an extensive busi-
ness in this colony, much of the produce
finding its way to the Sydney markets.
Most of the other towns are small and
offer little inducement to labour of any
kind; the great want is not so much
labour as men to settle and occupy the
vacant lands of the colony. The popu-
lation of Sandhurst is 36,570, and that of
Geelong 20,890.


SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Adelaide, the capital of South Aus-
tralia, has a population of 128,377, it
is within easy distance of Melbourne,
the fare by steamship is one pound.
The colony produces fruits and wine in
great abundance, and it is the principal
grain-growing colony of the Australian
group. The summer heat is rather
trying to new arrivals, but you soon
become acclimatised. The unemployed
in Adelaide and other parts of the colony
are far too numerous, however, and the
colony does not hold out sufficient
inducements for working men to under-
take so long a journey on the mere
chance of finding a suitable opening.
QUEENSLAND.
This is an immense colony, the popula-
tion over half a million; Brisbane, the
capital, has 73,000. It is an active business
centre, and there are plenty of places for
pleasure and recreation, the public gardens
are especially fine. The best chances
for working men, however, are in the


provincial towns, such as Rockhampton
and Maryborough. The thermometer here
runs up very high in the summer, and
the northern parts of the colony are
much too warm to be comfortable. The
stock-raising industry is very considerable,
many of the station holders own immense
tracts of country, requiring very little
manual labour. The passage from
Brisbane to Sydney costs thirty shillings.
One of the staple and progressive
industries of the colony is sugar-growing.
Conclusion.
To conclude, Australia is certainly a
grand and magnificent country, blessed
with boundless natural resources that
must eventually make it much more than
merely a pastoral country. The Trans-
continental railway will do a great deal
towards opening up the interior lands of
the country, and to prepare the way for
settlement. The splendid climate and
the abundant food supply are effective
barriers against want; of course there
are unemployed, certainly, but many of


these would not exchange places with
the employed in England, and the dis-
tressing sights one sees every day in
London are conspicuously absent in
Australia.
NEW ZEALAND.
I went from Tasmania to New Zealand,
in the Union Steamship Tarawera. The
passage usually occupies four days to the
Bluff Harbour ; from the Bluff to Inver-
cargill the distance is about eight miles
by rail. The reader is perhaps familiar
enough with the geography of New
Zealand to know that it is divided by
Cook’s Straits, the South Island being a
little larger than the North Island. The
winters in the extreme south are rather
severe, but in the north they are very
mild and agreeable. Invercargill is the
most important town in the Southland
district ; it is connected by rail with
Dunedin and Christchurch. The town
and surrounding country hold out fair
inducements to workmen and labourers,
the rate of wages paid to workmen varies
from eight to ten shillings per day, seven


shillings per day is the standard rate for
labourers. Employment is rather irregu-
lar and fitful, especially in the winter,
but a careful man can always save
sufficient money to keep him through
the winter. The climate is very healthy
and invigorating to English people, and
some of the finest scenery in the colony
is to be seen here. From Invercargill
to Dunedin is but a short distance, either
by rail or boat.
Dunedin is the largest town in the
South Island ; population 45,518; it is
the commercial centre for the Otago
district; many of the business warehouses
are very large. The streets are for the
most part very hilly, and generally bear
a name reminding one of Scotland. It
is the opinion of many of the inhabi-
tants that the city is ahead of present
requirements, and must consequently
go on at a steadier pace for some time
to come. The labour market is by no
means in a flourishing condition, employ-
ment being difficult to obtain in most
branches of trade. From Dunedin I
journeyed overland to Ashburton, the
largest provincial town in Canterbury


and had ample opportunities to note
the conditions of the labour market in
the several towns en route . I found that
these country districts gave very little
encouragement to the labourers, but held
out fair prospects to builders, blacksmiths
and wheelwrights; these trades ranking
first in most new countries. From
Ashburton to Christchurch is a distance
of about sixty miles by rail.
Christchurch, with 44,688 inhabitants,
is not quite so populous as Dunedin, but
it has the advantage in its natural
surroundings, the suburbs, parks and
gardens surpassing those of Dunedin.
Commercial depression, however, afflicts
all classes of the community, and many
recent arrivals from England find it
extremely difficult to obtain work of any
description.
Wellington, the capital (population
27,833), is reached by steamer from
Lyttleton, the port of Christchurch, in
sixteen hours; it has a spacious and safe
harbour, and the best wharf accommoda-
tion in the colony. Much of the land
upon which the city is built has been
reclaimed from the seashore; otherwise,


most parts of the town and suburbs are
very hilly. The Government Buildings
and the official residence of the Governor
are situated in the city. The iron foun-
dries, saw mills, and meat freezing works
are amongst the largest industries. Much
labour is also employed along the wharves,
as Wellington from its central position
commands most of the Inter-colonial and
Foreign Trade; the Coastal Trade with
Picton, Nelson and Napier is also very
large. The rate paid to wharf labourers
is one shilling per hour. The largest
inland town is Masterton, distant sixty
miles from Wellington, it contains about
ten hotels, several blacksmiths and wheel-
wrights’ shops, and other business houses
incidental to a flourishing up-country
town ; it is also a fine sheep district, and
much employment is given to Bush
Fellers in the surrounding neighbour-
hood. The Wellington district is very
prosperous, and there are not so many
unemployed as in other parts of the
colony. The rate of wages paid to skilled
workmen ranges from eight to ten
shillings per day of eight hours. House
rents are dearer than in any other part


of the colony, but provisions are much
the same price.
From Wellington, I went overland
to New Plymouth, passing through the
towns of Foxton, Wanganui and Hawera.
All these towns are very small, but are
contiguous to the best farming land in
the colony. Stock-raising and wheat-
growing are the chief industries, and the
exports of butter, especially from New
Plymouth to Australia, are very large.
These districts offer every inducement to
the farmer intending to take up land.
The soil is very rich and the climate is
delightful. The chances of obtaining
employment in any capacity are, however,
by no means encouraging, as most of
the business is done in a small way, and
generally upon the family principle.
From New Plymouth to Onehunga is
but a short distance by sea ; the passage
occupies about eight hours, omnibuses
and trains run from Onehunga to
Auckland. I resided in Auckland a con-
siderable time, it is the finest and most
populous city with 57,048 inhabitants
in the colony, having a good harbour,
and a splendid climate. The chief in-


dustries in the city are the several large
saw mills, iron foundries, and coach
factories, it is also the centre of the
Kauri gum trade. The Auckland pro-
vince holds out no inducement what-
ever to intending immigrants ; it is not
that the trade of the city and country
towns is in a bad way, but rather that
people have flocked there beyond any
reasonable requirements of the labour
market, thus producing a large body of
unemployed. In conclusion, I can only
say this, that I have travelled throughout
the colony, but am compelled to avoid
describing many of the smaller towns,
as to do so would take up an unreason-
able amount of space ; but I consider
that New Zealand offers good prospects
to energetic men who are able to do
business on their own account. For
those who go out in search of employ-
ment, they may be waiting months before
anything turns up.
I left Auckland, and drifted around
the South Pacific Islands, eventually
turning up in Samoa, where I found the
enterprising Germans bidding high for
commercial supremacy, but as Auckland


is geographically situated to command
the island trade, and as the Government
of New Zealand have subsidised the
steamship Janet Nicoll , to make monthly
calls at the various islands, I cannot
help thinking that if we show as much
enterprise as the Germans we shall still
continue to hold the balance of trade.
These islands offer good prospects to
traders and store-keepers; a young fellow
I knew opened a store in Samoa, and is
now building up a good trade.
THE SANDWICH ISLANDS.
These stud the north Pacific ; they
are seven in number, Hawaii being the
largest in the group ; the population of
the group numbers 88,000, and is made
up of Europeans, Natives, Chinese and
Japanese. The laws of the kingdom are
very equitable, and the taxes are very
light. The prevailing language here is
English, but United States gold and
Hawaiian silver dollars form the money
currency; the silver dollar bears the same
value as the American dollar. The


prosperity of the islands is dependent
upon sugar and bananas. The exports
of sugar exceed eight million dollars
annually.
Honolulu is the capital of the group
and the seat of Government. The city
is lighted by electricity, and there
are several very tine buildings in and
around the town. The palace of the
King and the Government buildings are
very tine structures, a band of musicians
entertain the citizens in the public
gardens three evenings each week.
The climate is one of the most delightful
in the world.
Tradesmen receive higher wages in
these islands than in any country of
which I know. The most important
industries in Honolulu are the planing
mills and iron foundries. The Honolulu
Iron Foundry finds employment for
more than one hundred workmen, and
there are plenty of other industries,
though, of course, on a smaller scale,
such for instance as cabinet-makers,
upholsterers, horse-shoers and general
blacksmiths. In a word, there are here
to be found all the various callings of


life, necessary in a mixed population
of 15,000. The rates of wages paid to
skilled workmen are from four to five
dollars per day of nine hours. The
bulk of the business is done by the
Americans and English ; a single man
can live very well in Honolulu for six
dollars per week.
HAWAII.
Hawaii is nearly two hundred miles
distant from Honolulu, the passage costs
four dollars. It is by far the more
extensive island, though not so populous
as Honolulu. The scenery here is of
the grandest description ; the beautiful
palm and cocoa-nut trees, snow-capped
mountains, and the largest active
volcano in the world, attract tourists
from the United States and other
countries. Captain Cook, the renowned
navigator, was killed on this island.
Most of the stores are situated in
Front Street, and much local and export
trade is done. The exports are very
large, as the sugar plantations and
cattle ranches are very important and


extensive. A fair opening exists for young
men who have no special calling, as the
planters and store-keepers employ much
intelligent labour, and pay well for it.
Men employed in the building trades do
well. The private houses are built of
wood, and the stores generally of brick
or stone. Blacksmiths are always in
demand and at good wages; in fact, it is
no uncommon occurrence to have to
send to San Francisco for them. Tailors
do well on these islands, especially in
Honolulu. I paid a Chinese tailor thirty
dollars for a suit of clothes, and when I
came to London an English tailor made
me a better suit for twelve dollars.
The trade is now falling very much into
the hands of the Chinese: most of the
restaurants throughout the islands are
run by the Chinese, and a most substan-
tial meal is to be obtained for 25 cents.
Honolulu, Hawaii, and Maui are the
largest and most important islands.
The others are small and insignificant,
and about as populous as a London
omnibus.
The journey from England to the
islands occupies about three weeks, and to


single men following the necessary call-
ings they offer every inducement. They
are not so far away as Australia is,
besides you can travel all over Australia
and you will not meet with anything like
sixteen shillings per day for skilled labour.
It is useless for labourers to go there, how-
ever, as Chinese do all the labouring work,
and only receive six dollars per week.
After a stay of nearly two years on the
islands, I left Honolulu for San Francisco.
The voyage is accomplished in six days
at a cost of twenty-five dollars.
SAN FRANCISCO.
The city of the Golden Gate is built
upon a sandy peninsula, but such is
the untiring energy of the people of
California, aided by their enormous
wealth, that they have transformed
what must once have been a dreary spot
into one of the finest modern cities of
the world. The business houses, shops
and hotels along Market Street are
immense structures; theatres, and all the
various places of amusement character-


istic of a wealthy city, are numerous
both in the city and the suburbs; nor is
it necessary for a mechanic to drown his
mental capacity in a pot of beer, as
reading-rooms, with newspapers in every
tongue, and libraries are accessible to
every one. Restaurants are numerous
and cheap; a first-class dinner, including
wine and fruit, is to be obtained for
twenty-five cents, and a very decent
meal is to be had for fifteen cents.
Cable trams circle the city in every
direction, and the long journey of seven
miles to Golden Gate Park only costs
five cents. The population of San
Francisco is truly cosmopolitan, and
numbers nearly 400,000, including
30,000 Chinese, who follow the various
callings of cigar-making, washing and
shoe-making, and although they compete
strongly for domestic situations, San
Francisco is still the best town going to
which all female servants can emigrate.
The rate of wages to domestic “ helps ”
is twenty-five dollars per month. San
Francisco is especially noted for gay
Sundays, excursionists go in crowds to
the various watering places ; theatres and


saloons are open as on week days, and
the churches of the various religions
denominations are well attended. The
citizens are orderly and civil, and
liberty has by no means run into license ;
savings banks are numerous, and de-
posits can be made from one to three
thousand dollars, The five-cent piece
is the lowest money tender in California,
but a glass of beer and a good lunch is
to be had for it in the city.
Numbered amongst the principal in-
dustries of San Francisco are the iron
foundries. The Union Iron Works are
the largest on the Pacific coast, and
employ more than one thousand men.
The saddlery, carriage, and car manufac-
tories are numerous, and employ much
well-paid labour, and the export trade to
China, Japan, and the Pacific islands is
large, and finds much employment for
clerks, warehousemen and others.
Labour employment offices are always
in want of men for the lumber mills,
ranches, railway works, and at harvest
time it is difficult to find sufficient men
for the country districts.
A case came under my notice last


summer in Contra Costa county, where
the thrashing machines had to be laid up
for several weeks for the want of men ;
and the advertisements in the city news-
papers prove that California is a good
field for every class of labour. Boiler-
makers and carpenters are always wanted,
and men are always wanted for the
various lumber mills and railway works
and in Washington Territory. This is
but a short distance from San Francisco,
and is a’ rapidly rising country capable of
absorbing all the unskilled labour in the
market of San Francisco. Across the
Bay of San Francisco small towns are
located in every direction. The lovely
towns of Alameda, Berkeley, Oakland,
San Rafael, San Leandro, and many
others in close proximity to San Fran-
cisco enjoy a genial climate tempered
by the cool breezes of the Pacific, The
annual range of the thermometer in
these favoured spots is from fifty degrees
to seventy degrees. Fruit-growing is
one of the main occupations, many of
the orchards are famed throughout the
State, and the annual yield of grapes is
very large.


Grain-growing and other farming
pursuits are followed to a considerable
extent. Oakland is by far the most
populous town, after San Francisco, with
40,000 inhabitants, and has many fine
business thoroughfares and an active
trade. Many San Francisco merchants
select Oakland as a place of residence,
induced, perhaps, by its genial climate
and pleasing surroundings. The Corpor-
ation allow the Railway Company to run
trains through the streets of the city, and
in consideration of this favour the resi-
dents are allowed to ride around the city
free of charge.
o
SACRAMENTO.
The capital of California has nearly
30,000 inhabitants. The Central Pacific
Railway Works are located there, and
give employment to over fifteen hundred
workmen ; many other industries are
carried on, but, of course, not to such an
extent. The fruit canneries, woollen
mills, planing mills, potteries, and buggy
factories employ a considerable amount


of labour; besides, the city is the centre
of a very large region, and the fruit
sent from Sacramento to the eastern
markets reaches enormous totals. The
distance from San Francisco to Sacramento
is eighty miles, and the passage by the
river boats costs one dollar and fifty
cents.
STOCKTON.
This town is fifty miles distant from
Sacramento, and has a population of
16,000 ; it is the centre of a large wheat
growing district, and the local manufac-
tories are considerable. The Harvester
Works, for • the manufacture of agri-
cultural machinery, are the largest in
California. The flour mills and paper
factories employ several hundred hands,
and the ranch owners around the district,
even as far down as Antioch in Contra
Costa county, employ all the farm hands
obtainable, especially is this the case at
harvest-time, when they find it most diffi-
cult to get help of any kind. The distance
from San Francisco to Stockton is ninety
miles, and the fare by the river steamers


is two dollars. Going by the boat you
have an opportunity of seeing the Great
San Joaquin Valley, and if it be summer-
time, the fruit orchards, and the miles
upon miles of waving corn will convince
anyone that a great future is before this
district. The inducements offered to
the farmer, fruit-grower and labourer
can hardly be overrated. Should the new
comer have a day to spare upon the river,
the San Joaquin will deliver up to the
rod and line fine carp and other fish
with a most extravagant quickness and
facility.
FRESNO COUNTY.
This county is within easy distance of
Stockton. It is one of the largest coun-
ties in the state of California. The area
is nearly 10,000 square miles ; popu-
lation not more than 20,000. Wheat,
oats, and barlej" are the chief productions,
but fruit-growing is an important business
and some of the vineyards are quite
extensive. The Barton vineyard comprises
500 acres in wine-grapes, and 40 acres
in raisins, and there are many others quite


as extensive. The county offers every
inducement to the fruit-grower, the
farmer and the labourer, but none what-
ever to the mechanic. Fresno city has
a population of 4,000 and will double
that number in a very short time.
SANTA CLARA COUNTY.
This is south of San Francisco, and
is most important both in population
and production. San Jose is the chief
town, distant from San Francisco forty-
six miles ; the population at the present
time is nearly 20,000. The manufac-
turing industries are not carried on to
any extent in San Jose. The county
is known far and wide for its fruit
orchards and its vineyards ; considerable
grain is raised in the county, but the
farmers are gradually going into the now
more profitable business of fruit-culture.
The climate is supposed to rival that of
Italy, and the Mount Hamilton Observa-
tory is worthy of note, it possesses the
largest telescope in the world.
The most important towns in Southern


California are Los Angelos and San
Diego.
LOS ANGELOS.
Ten years ago the population of the
last named city was not more than ten
thousand, at the present time it is a busy
city with 50,000 inhabitants, three daily
newspapers, and a flourishing trade. The
place is extending, and new buildings
are to be seen in every direction. Much
of the land in the county is sandy,
however, and not worth much for any
purposes of husbandry.
SAN DIEGO COUNTY.
This county is a little more south than
Los Angelos, and is near the borders of
Mexico. The area is 15,000 square miles,
but much of the land is worthless, a
great part of it being very sandy.
San Diego city boasts a good harbour
and ample wharf accommodation, the
population at the present time is nearly
17,000. The building trade is in a
flourishing condition, and the town was


rapidly building up when I was there ;
the famed Coronado Hotel is within this
vicinity.
There are numerous other Californian
towns which it is impossible for me to
describe without extending these notes
too far, but I hope that sufficient has
been said to prove that this State offers
every inducement to the working classes
who may emigrate thither.
NEW SOUTH WALES AND CALIFORNIA
COMPARED AS TO LABOUR MARKETS,
I select New South Wales because it
is one of the most prosperous colonies
in Australia, and also the oldest. The
area exceeds that of California, nor does
it give place to California in natural
resources or in climate, but when con-
sidered as a held for the tradesman, the
labourer, in short, for all who depend
upon their own labour, it most certainly
gives way, in my opinion, to California.
The manufactories of New South
Wales are to a great extent located in
England, the goods are simply discharged
c


upon the Circular Quay, Sydney, and
warehoused there. Whether this is to
the advantage of New South Wales is
not for me to determine, but that it is to
the disadvantage of the workmen in that
colony the large number of unemployed
and the crippled local industries suffi-
ciently testify ; whereas in California,
especially in San Francisco, and the large
manufacturing towns adjacent to it, the
local industries absorb and profitably
employ the greater part of the skilled
and unskilled labour upon the markets,
leaving very little for those great and
rising countries of Oregon and Wash-
ington territory.
Then capital is ever on the watch for a
safe investment, and quickly raises towns
from obscurity to prominence, as it has
done in Los Angelos, San Diego and
other places.
Moreover, I know of no country where
the farmer, the fruit-grower, and others
intending to settle upon the land can do
as well as they can in California.
I travelled throughout the Western
States, and passed through the great towns
of Denver, Kansas city and other centres


of population. While many of these cities
offer good inducement to working men,
I still consider California superior to any
of them, both in climate and as a labour
market.
I will conclude these stray notes by
saying that they were put together after
an experience of ten years, and an inti-
mate acquaintance with the working
people, in all the countries I have here
described.

[Note. —Ten hours constitute a day’s work in the majority
of trades. In some that number is reduced to nine, and in a
few to eight. Clerks work from 11 to 13 hours ; Butchers
average 14 hours per day. There is no apprentice system ;
boys get a low rate of wages while they are supposed to be
learning a particular trade or occupation, receiving “ journey-
men’s ” rates at the beginning of the fifth year. ]
