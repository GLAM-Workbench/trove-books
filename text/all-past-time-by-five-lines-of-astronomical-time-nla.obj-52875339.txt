As arrangements are being made for transferring the Offices from the Memorial
Hall to more central quarters in the City, it is desirable that all communications for the
present should be addressed to the Editor, at Wanstead, E,, where the work of the Obser-
vatory is carried on.
This Association consists of a large and increasing number of Chronologists, and others,
all of whom acknowledge one method in determining past time, viz., by the arbitrary but
sure rule of astronomical cycles and measurements ; in other words, by the movements of
the orbs of the solar system, which originate and control time. There can be no other
method for determining time correctly, hence Chronology, which, like Astronomy, has been
imperfect,’’is now systematised, and is rendered an “ exact science.” It is Astronomy prac-
tically applied and enlarged—applied by making that science subservient to measurements
of time instead of confining it to the less certain results of distance, and enlarged by cal-
culating and classifying all past eclipses and transits, the former being associated, as they
occur, with many great events of history, which render their periodical recurrence more
impressive, interesting, and useful to the intelligent mind.
The objects of the Association are: to authoritatively maintain and make known the
concensus of the science of time, thus definitely and correctly obtained; to remove the
ignorance which exists amongst mankind through an imperfect knowledge of the elemen-
tary character of time; and to systematise and simplify history, which through the absence
of scientific, data is misunderstood and sometimes doubted instead of being admired.
The work already achieved by scientific Chronology is a complete and absolute control
of every day since history began and time was instituted on the earth,-viz., from the
epoch known as Creation, or the re-fabrication of the globe and the formation of moral
man. ii The transactions of the Association, which are continually issued, show how conclu-
sively the definite character of that epoch has been obtained, and how perfectly*all astron-
omical phenomena proceed upon five lines of lunar, solar and planetary time, from the
first day of that period to the present time. Another great achievement of scientific Chron-
ology is, that by the classification and enumeration of eclipses and transits, they have
been reduced to a system of great practical utility as metrical indicators for proving the
whole or any fractional part of past time. This had long been wanted in order to settle
controversy. There is yet a third achievement, which is deserving of special notice, viz.,
the discovery of the beautiful and encouraging fact, that all Biblical history is astron-
omical, being unalterable lunar time, marked oil in knots of seven days, and hence all the
dales of Scripture fall with'precision on the lines of scientific time like the cogs of a wheel.
It thus becomes clear that the Book of Genesis, which gives us records of the earliest his-
tory of our race, is by its dates a marvellous compendium of the movements of planetary
orbs, and supplies that point of time which Chronologists and Astronomers had long been
desirous of obtaining, in order to verify all subsequent periods of history and celestial
phenomena. ,Too much cannot be said of this splendid discovery.
The membership of the Association is honorary and subscribing, the latter being an
annual subscription of half a guinea. Members receive the Transactions free, and are en-
titled to forward combi uni cations to be read at the ordinary meetings of the Association.
Subscriptions and donations are asked for, in order that the publications of the Association
may be ihore extensively circulated, for it is to be regretted that at present the British
Chronolotrical Association has no other source of income.

When there is a difference of a year between the beginning of the reign of a King, and that
given in some other page, it is because the dates at the .British Museum are not authenticated,
whilst those of the British Chronological and Astronomical Association arc obtained by
measurements.
The cut representing the configurations of Venus, page 140, has inadvertently got turned
round, and whilst at press an accident occurred to another cut, No. 8, on page 133, by which it

PREFACE.
Time is the amount of duration whilst some heavenly body, or the earth,
moves from one position to another. There can bo no other time than this
which alone is natural and scientific ; but notwithstanding the professions of
intelligence amongst mankind, there are now thirteen different systems of
time in uso in various parts of the world. Our English time is one of them,
hut they are all spurious and unfit for practical use, because they arc merely
legislative enactments. Hence no two men can agree concerning the amount
of time from one distant period of history to another, and what is worse, the
events of history, which should be known, are hidden from observation or
knowledge. It is owing to the use of unscientific methods of computing time
that none of the chiefs of astronomical observatories, nor even our own
Astronomers Royal, have ever published tables of eclipses of the sun or
moon, or transits of the planets Mercury and Venus. They cannot do so,
because their systems of time have no accord with planetary motion. For
example, the last legislative enactment of the British Parliament made
respecting time was so recent as 1752, a.d., when the year was ordered to
begin with January, the fourth month of the solar year, instead of the 21st
of March, the sixth month, as formerly. If our Astronomer Royal began to
construct lines of eclipses he could not go beyond 1752, because that year
Lad only nine months.
The purpose, therefore, of this book— All Past Time —is to explain what is
the Science of Time, and to show by measurements what is the true amount
of duration, or natural and scientific time from one period to another. As
such, this book is a standard work on Time, and is the only publication
which exists on the subject. It shows that history is now a science.
These methods and the astronomical line of time which the motions of the
heavenly bodies have produced, have now been published, in one form or
another, for fifteen years. During this period they have never been chal-
lenged. To do so would be equal to challenging the multiplication tables,
or denying our knowledge of all the astronomical phenomena which wo see
with our eyes. Time, like arithmetic, is'a fundamental science Wo can add
nothing to it nor diminish anything belonging to it. It is Chronological As-
tronomy, and like Nautical Astronomy is capable of great practical use by
measurements. The calculations made at our observatories are worthless
in respect to history, because English time is not natural or scientific. If
astronomy is not dealt with on natural and scientific lines, it is mere star-
gazing, and not worthy of the name of science.
The great drawback to the calculations used at the Greenwich Obser-
vatory is that the solar year does not begin where the sun begins it, namely,
when the sun is on the equinoctial colure, or autumnal equinox, on the 22nd-
23rd of ' September. Hence all the years at the Observatory overlap each
other and are worthless for measurement. Another drawback equally un-
scientific is that the standard of a year has been pulled about and altered
by legislative enactments, and, therefore, is inapplicable for measuring scien-
tific time.
For the same reason all other astronomical periods are thrown out of gear
and are rendered useless, whether they be solar cycles, the Metonio eyeffc,
eclipses, or transits. But the calculations at the Observatory are well made,
and if they wore properly based would be of service. As at present consti-
tuted, the Observatory is entirely a nautical institution, and has nothing to
do with the Science of Time,


It is not urged in this book that we must abandon our English system of
time. Wo could not well do this now, but whether a false and misleading
system will long survive in the presence of a correct one, experience must
determine. What is insisted on is, that for obtaining correct knowledge of
astronomy, geology, and history, we must use natural and scientific methods,
otherwise mankind must continue in confusion on these and many other
subjects.
Unfortunately, whilst there are professors of all other sciences at our
Universities, there are none of the Science of Time. A day of 24 hours is the
longest period in use which is natural time and planetary motion in England ;
all other periods of time are fictitious, and the cause of all the argument and
uncertainty amongst mankind. Months and years are not in their proper
form and position. Extravagant sums are annually voted from the public
purse for making observations and calculations, pertaining to celestial phe-
nomena, which practically—save for sailors—are not worth a straw. Perhaps
the only remedy for all this Egyptian darkness is, that either a new depart-
ment for notifying scientific time must be added to the Greenwich Obser-
vatory, or a separate institution—already formed by the British Chrono-
logical and Astronomical Association—must be moderately endowed. The
public could then have proper information, our scholastic institutions would
bo elevated, and disagreements about history, science and revelation would
be ended.
There is one great feature in this book which must bo mentioned. Tho
use of natural and scientific time enables us to deal correctly with history,
because no man can put into a given period of time any more years than it
contains. Now investigation shows that the line of time in tho Scriptures is
true planetary motion, therefore every event narrated in the Bible is capable
of being proved. Creation, for example, is found to be an astronomical date
of the highest character. This fact would have been known before, but
astronomy, by basing its calculations on fictitious years, was unable to make
the proper investigation. It is now certain that the epoch of creation, year
0 a.m., was a period when all the ten cycles of time started together. They
have never got together since then, and cannot do so, owing to their diver-
sified character and length. Nor could they have got all into one line, or
starting-post, as at Creation, without special arrangement. Creation was
evidently “ tho beginning ” of the motions of tho earth and the moon, and
investigation shows that from that point alt Biblical periods, years, and
dates proceed, travelling with undeviating precision side by side with all the
astronomical periods, so that every seventh year of Biblical time is tho
seventh year of all planetary motion.

FIRST LINE OF TIME.
The date of “the beginning; ” in Genesis i., and the subsequent dates of the Ante
ifflnvians are scientific time produced by planetary motion ami the rotation of the earth.
For this reason they are of the highest scientific character as statements of the amount
of duration, known as time, which elapses whilst any planetary body proceeds from one
place of its orbit to another. As records of motion, such scientific dates, like the
statements of latitudes and longitudes, cannot be disturbed, nor can they be made sub-
ject to the shifting cavils of unlearned men. Hence investigation shows that as there is
not a day, date of the month, year, or period in Scripture, which is not scientific, they
have all to bo accepted as trutn, the rejection of which would necessitate that the
heavens should fall and the wreck of worlds become an appalling fact.
There is no other book in the world than the Bible which contains scientific time, for
although the calculations of the Greenwich Observatory are correct in relation to the
Roman form of the year, yet such a year has no affinity with the true solar year, which
can only begin when the sun is on the equinoctial colure in September, producing equal
day and night over the world. The pagan Roman year by beginning the solar period
with the fourth month, January, is out of gear with eclipses and transits.. Fortius
reason no tables of these phenomena can be produced by our English year, nor by the
other 12 spurious systems of time observed by various nations of the world. Another great
drawback in respect to the use of unnatural years is, calculations of the motions of the
heaveuly bodies at the Greenwich Observatory are made from the point of the vernal
equinox in March, which is the beginning of another form of spurious years. These are
things which all true and scientific men have to deplore. Such mischief reduces the
science of astronomy to a system of star-gazing instead of making it one of practical use.
It also hides history and darkens our knowledge of “ the beginning,’’ Like a useless tree,
the Roman year is marked to fall—it must be rooted up if knowledge is to be power.
After these statements, which it has been necessary to make, we proceed by remarking
that the dates of the Antediluvians work on a Solar Cycle of seven luuar years, each
containing 354 days, and divided into 12 months alternately possessing 30 or 29 days.
This Cycle is self-constructive and lasts for ever, because it forms itself by the natural
use of weeks of 7 days. Hence the week of 7 days mentioned iu the first chapter of
Genesis must correctly produce all subsequent time for ever. It is the varying posi'ions
of the seven days, as dates of the month, which are exhausted in 7 years, so that the
following year must begin a new cycle by again beginning with the first day of the week,
Sunday. If the week could be broken the Solar Cycle would fall into pieces. There can
be no such thing as a Solar Cycle unless weeks be observed, neither can Eclipse or other
astronomical Cycles be worked out without it. But it is not only the cycle of all time,
it is also the first astronomical table. It supplies us with the dates and days of the week
on which eclipses and transits fall. Indeed, if men refused to observe weeks, and the
line of time was forgotten, the days of the week could be recovered by observing when
transits of the planets, or eclipses of the sun and moon occurred. These great Soutinels
of the Skies keep seven days with scientific accuracy, thundering out the seven days in-
scribed on the inspired page as they proceed through the ages, and writing the date of
the beginning on the walls of heaven. The First Line of Time thcietore began :
I. With Sunday as the Ist day of seven days. A Solar Cycle requires seven days, other-
wise eclipses could not be kept in their years.
11. When Sunday was the first day of the month. This can only occur in luuar years
after periods of 9 and 4 months—which are the periods of the nodes of the moon.
111. When Sunday was the first day of the year. This can only, occur once in seven
years and must be the Ist of a Solar Cycle-
IV. When the lunar and Solar years begin together on Sunday. This can only occur
once in 4543 years—the Great Septennial Astronomical Year, 7 times 049.
V. When the Ist solar eclipse (No. 1, Line I.) begins a team of 70 eclipses. This can
only take place once in 18 years, when beginning 649 with the 4th month.
VI. When the same eclipse No. 1. occurs on the Ist day of the 4th month. This must
be the beginning of a period of G 49 years.
VII. When the Metonic Cycle of 19 solar years began with the Antediluvian Solar

PATRIARCHS IN EGYPT. —From Father to Son.

The years when the Patriarchs were born who succeeded Jacob are not definitely given

Notice—The solar cycle being 7 years, it goes 236 times over to produce 1652, which
was a first year of the cycle because Creation year is 0. Hence the sth year was 1656,
a>.d contains the dates of the Flood produced by the motions of the earth and the moon.
Note Although Abraham was 75 in 2083, yet he began his 75th in 2082, and we have
to reckon from that year.
The above three simple tables were better known to Solomon than to us. We read
(1 Kings vi. 1) that he laid the foundation of the temple in the 480th year after exodus,
vis. 2993. It was 7 years in building and the dedication dates on the solar cycle are 3000.
The three tables succeed each other in years and give a line of time from father to son
for 2553 years. Table iii. means when Jacob was 80, Levi was born; when Levi was 44
Kohath was born, &c., up to the birth of Moses.


By the foregoing direct line from Father to Son during 2553 Years, Moses dying
that year, and by the “ 480 ” years, with 7 for building, we reach the dedication of the
temple in 3000, but I shall subsequently show, all the years and dates on the solar cycle
and by astronomical measurements, which are conclusive. Now Solomon, we are told,
reigned 40 years. As 2993 was his “ 4th,” he died at the end of 3029 which was table c
of the Ancient Hebrew Solar Cycle, and was succeeded by his son Kehoboham.
Eehoboham to the great Captivity in 340G£ was 377 years—important point.

Abijah 3 Jehoram... 8 I Joash ...40 Jotham 16 Manasseh 65 Jehoahaz i
Asa ...41 Ahaziah... 1 ) Amaziah29 | Ahaz ...16 Amon ... 2 Jehoiaohimll
Jehoiachim was succeeded by his son Jehoiachin, who reigned 3 months, and investiga-
tion shows that some of the kings reigned a few months short of the years assigned to
them. This will be subsequently dealt with. Zedekiah was raised to the throne by
Nebuchadnezzar when the Captivity began in 340GJ e, and reigned nearly 11 years, o 341 G
When we proceed, in the first instance, by reigns of kings whose exact periods are not
given in months short or over the years, it is necessary to keep correct by using some
near well-known definite point of time. Hence we take the great Captivity, which is
conclusively proved, chiefly by Ezekiel always dating from it. As his dates are always
found on the solar cycle, it is impossible to err in noticing e 3406 J where they begin.
INTERESTING EVENTS.
3416 o Jewish monarchy ended and temple burnt. The events were as follows: In the
9th year of Zedekiah, which ended on the middle of 3415, table n, on Sunday
the 10th day of the 4th civil month, which was the 10th sacred, Nebuchad-
nezzar pitched against Jerusalem. See 2 Kings xxv. 1, Jer. xxxix. 1, and
Ezekiel xxiv. 1. The seige lasted till nearly the end of the next year 3416,
table o, for on Friday, the 9th day of the 4th (10th civil) month, there was no
bread left, and all the Hebrew men of war fled in the night between the two
walls via the king’s garden. They ran across the plains towards Jericho, but
were overtaken by the Chaldasans and the King and his sons made prisoners.
The city was thus broken up and Zedekiah being taken before Nebuchadnezzar,
his sons were slain in his presence, after which his eyes were put out. In the
next month, which was 6th sacred, namely on Thursday, the 7th, the Babylo-
nian army began to burn the city. On Sunday, the 10th, the temple built
by Solomon, was in flames. The king’s house and all the great buildings
were consumed by fire, and the walls of the city were levelled to the ground.
These events should be followed on the solar cycle. They are all astron-
omical time, but if the foregoing years of the patriarchs had been recorded as
one less or more, these dates could not be proved by the solar cycle, nor by
the eclipses and transits.
For the sake of extreme accuracy of detail, I must state that the history
viewed upon the solar cycle—which is the proper course—shows that the year
3415 was the latter half of Zedekiah’s 9th and the first six months of his 10th.
In like manner, 3416 was last half of his 10th and first six months of his 11th.
In the next year, 3417, the eclipses were © No. 1 and © No. 2, in the be-
ginning of the 3rd and 10th lunar months, producing the dates of the week
as shown by the solar cycle and mentioned in recording the historical events.
There would also be a transit of Mercury in 3406 when Zedekiah ascended.
For the continuation of the First Line of Time the reader must turn to the several
books or scripture history in the parts of this work, such as Ezekiel, Ezra,
Zechariah, Haggai, Esther, and Nehemiah. In these books we have a con-
tinuation of accurate history, as will be seen by the use of the letters indi-
cating the table or year of the Solar Cycle. By noticing that the solar cycle
consitsof 15 years it must begin when the years alternately end with 2 and 7,
and also by affixing a letter to each year of the cycle, it is impossible to miss
any day of time.
The other books of scripture, as given in this work, also corroborate this
First Line of Time in the same way, so that we have proof after proof of the
accuracy of “ All Past Time.’’
8569 c The last Biblical date, and the Solar Cycle, brings the Frst Line of Time down to a
reference to the Intercalary Days of 3569, a.m., which was 427, b.o. and the

32nd year of Artaxerxes (see also “ Persian Kings.’’) Therefore from this
point of time we deal with uninspired testimony, but it is voluminous, as it is
supported by secular and monumental history; nevertheless the letter or table
of the Solar Cycle will always supply the correct year.
We have also the eclipses, records of which start from 8101 A. M., or 903
8.0. (old calculation) which was 101 years after Solomon dedicated the Tem-
ple, and this eclipse line is again corroborated by the transits of Venus and
Mercury.
Of all secular history we will take that of Rome as being most straight
forward and well adapted for the continuation of this First Line of Time, 'the
first y>'ar of Rome was 3240 A.M., lablej, and Jesus Christ was born in the
750th year of Rome, 3990 a.m. and also table j. We therefore for the sake of
brevity proceed as follows:
A.M. 80 -
3246 j First year of Rome completed (the foundation being in 749 b.o 760
3441 j One Hundred and ninety-fifth of Rome 655
3630 j Three Hundred and nintieth of Rome. 800
3831 j Five Hundred and eighty-fifth of Rome 165
3996 j Seven Hundred and fiftieth of Rome.

3998 I
3999 m
4000 n First Year of Christian Era completed commencing with the 4th month.
4001 0 Second
4002 a Third
CHRISTIAN ERA.
Now that we arrive at our own years all our difficulties commence, because our
years are unscientific and do not begin with the proper month, which accord-
ing to ancient history and astronomical science, should be at the end of Sep-
tember, a proper period for the introduction of man when the fruits of the
earth were ripe. The reader must give his careful attention in order that we
may land correct time upon our solar cycle. It will already be seen that we
are wrong in computation, thus 4002 is not our year 2, because we foolishly
began with 4000 instead of 4001, that is to say we commenced the Christian
Era in the last year or the third millennium, instead of the first of the fourth.
This blunder follows us through every year, so that 1878 a.d. is not 5878 a.m.
but 5877 was the first three months of our 1878 and 9 months of our 1879.
To land the Ancient Hebrew Solar Cycle on our Solar Cycle of 28 years, the
following table is constructed:—

CONTEMPORARY ANTEDILUVIAN PATRIARCHS.
The years are solar, 365 J days, and as they severally and unitedly agree astronomically
With Eclipse and Transit Measurements, as well as with the Solar Cycle, tested by the
Metonio Cycle, there is no possibility of doubting their accuracy.
Methuselah died within two months of the Flood. Enoch was translated 57 years
after Adam died. Noah was in the ark 365 days, which form a solar year. The Solar
Cycle proves that nine of the dates of the Flood period were seventh days, Saturdays,
thus verefying the three seventh days specially mentioned in Gen. viii. We have no
reason to suppose that all the antediluvians lived cathedral-like years. The long lives
of the patriarchs, in a direct line from Adam, were probably continued to show that man
was not created to die.
Much discussion has been raised by some writers about the date when the Lraelitea
left Egypt, but the above table supplies it, and also the end of the 40 years in the wild-
erness. We cannot have a more simple and correct method than a line of time from
father to son. The reader will see from this table nnd Historical Table 111., (“Patri-
archs in Egypt,”) that Moses died in the middle of 2553, viz., after the 40 years in the
wilderness. We are told in Scrinturc that ho was 80 at the exodus and 120 when he
died. We also read that Jacob lived 147 years, and entered Egypt when he was 130.
ANOTHER IMPORTANT DATE CLEARLY FIXED. .
If we know the end of a period, wo also know its beginning. Hence as we find that
the line of time from father to son continues from Creation to 2553, by the death of
Moses, we see that Creation was its beginning. Then in accordance with this, a glance
at the Solar Cycle shown us that the year began the Cycle, starling with Sunday, and
that Tuesday was the 15th of the 7th sacred mouth in the exodus mouth, 2513. 4.

SAMARITAN AND SEPTUAGINT ERRORS.
In addition to the Hebrew text of the births and lives of the Antediluvian Patriarchs
which is found in Genesis v. incur English Bibles, there are two others, viz,, the Sam-
aritan and Septuagint. All three are given below, but investigation shows that the
Septuagint and Samaritan are not worth a straw, as they are not astronomical and will
not work with eclipses or transits. Neither are their years subject to Solar Cycles, and
as to the Metonic Cycle, they have no possible agreement. But the Hebrew version
agrees with marvellous precision with all these scientific tests, so that men who have a
wholesale way of dealing with years without investigation should give some proof of
the possibility of their existence before expecting us to believe in their phantoms. The
years claimed for Egyptian and Chinese history before the Flood have had no existence.
If there had been one year less or more in any of the records of the births of the ten
patriarchs they could not be acceptable. The whole would have fallen.
The year 1307 which is the total of the Samaritan version falls on the 6th of the
Solar Cycle formed by the motions of the moon and the earth, so that it has not the
dates of Noah’s diary of the Flood on the seventh days. The Jews had always occasion
to complain of the perversion of the Scriptures by the Samaritans. Respecting the
year 2202, the total of the Septuagint list, it was never on the Antediluvian Solar Cycle.
The Cycle ceased at the end of 1721. But I marvel that Blair should have been carried
away by the Septuagint and without any investigation. Yet so long as universities
teach history without measurements, and have no Professors of the Science of Time, all
such folly will continue, and the knowledge taught there will not be power.
It is remarkable that the Ancient Hebrews in tne time of Abraham, and the Ante-
diluvians, understood the true length of the Solar year, as rather less than 365 i days,
when modern nations down to the 17th century of the Christian era, were ignorant of it.
The evection, wnich is the greatest irregularity of the motion of the moon, was under-
stood by men in patriaachal times, but was unknown amongst the Egyptians and Ho-
mans until the time of Ptolemy in the year 133 of our era.
o o
ADJUSTING THE ANTEDILUVIAN LUNI-SOLAR CYCLE WITH THE
SOLAR PERIOD.
TRUE REVELATION AND GOOD SCIENCE.
Several letters have reached me asking how the Antediluvians adjusted their Solar
Cycle to the solar period ? Ido not know. They could do in three ways, but we have
no means of knowing what plan they adopted. They seem however to have done the
work with great accuracy. They divided the lunar year into weeks and date?, and not
the solar period as we do- It is evident by their dates that they did not insert the ex-
tra or intercalary days till the seven lunar years were ended. We see this by the Flood
beginning on the “ 17th day of the 2nd month.’’ As the lunar yeer is 11 days shorter
than the solar, the latter would begin with the date just mentioned and end with the
27th uf the 2nd month” in the following lunar year, the 6th of the cycle. Noah was
evidently a solar year in the ark, and both the dates just mentioned were Saturdays, or
seventh days, as were also seven other dates of the Flood. But they cou'd not
have been seventh days if one of the lives of the patriarchs had been one year shorter
or longer. Here then we have a most marvellous record, hut one forsooth whi - h some 1
“ high critics ” have questioned ! Ido not find, in the whole range of history anything
so marvellously beautiful, so impressively accurate, or so majestically scientific.


HISTORICAL AND SCIENTIFIC SUMMARY OF ALL PAST YEARS
FROM CREATION.
The following is a clear summary of all years since time was instituted at Creation
period, down to end of 5876, A.M., which was Sept. 1878, a.d.: —
Past Years.
246 Antediluvian Solar Cycles of 7 years each, from year 0 to 1721,
inclusive. (See Antediluvian Solar Cycle and following page
of first years of each cycle). 1721
152 Ancient Hebrew Solar Cycles, of 15 years each, from 1722 to 4001
inclusive. (See Ancient Hebrew Solar Cycle and following
page of First Years of each cycle) 2280
125 Ancient Hebrew Solar Cycles of 15 years each, brought forward
from 4002 to 5876 inclusive. See First Line of Time showing
Ancient Hebrew Solar Cycle Sychronized 1875
Total, end of 5876
The foregoing summary is the production of historical records and dates. A solar
cycle cannot be broken by jumping oil one to another before one is complete, nor can
a year be broken. It must, both for the sake of seasons and dates, be completed before
another is begun.
The following are the chief reasons why wo cannot use the solar cycle of 28 years
belonging to the Christian Era: —In the first place, there is no succession, as our year
begins with January, the 4th month of the true year. To illustrate this great disad-
vantage, let it be supposed that a man is measuring a piece of timber, and after mark-
ing oft several feet he stops and begins somewhere farther on. This breach would
preclude him from giving the true length of the timber. In the second place we jumped
eleven days in the year of 1752, which was making another hole in our cycles of time. And
in the third place, we thrice omit a day in every 400 years. With chasms like these,
increasing as time goes on our solar cycle is a worthless thing for measurement.
Respecting the astronomical or scientific character of these 5876 years, the reader
must refer to eclipses, the lunar cycle, the transits of Mercury and the transits of Venus,
which poduce precisely the same number of years either taken in parts, that is from
period to period, or as a whole.
It is this extreme accuracy and minuteness of detail, obtained by solar cycles, that
excludes the requirement of such a crutch as the Julian Period. A good chronologist
never requires such support.
It is a great fact, and ought therefore to be stated, that no dates are scientific but
those found in the scriptures. They are all a simple succession in the chain of time from
“ the first day,” and no man can alter that succession. Every data in the Bible falls
upon the proper year of the solar cycle, and the correctness of the year is shown by
the fact that every Antediluvian solar cycle must have for its last figures 0,7, 4,
1,8, 5,2, 9,6, or 3, and every Ancient Hebrew Cycle 2or 7. By observing this we
could see in a moment if any year was erroneously on the cycle or wrongly dated.
IMPORTANT SUGGESTION TO ALL NATIONS.
The perfect succession of years from the point of time when history began shows the
preference which must be given to the use of the a.m. years as a true succession of
time. For this reason I hope that if the world reaches the conclusion of the present
century, men will consider themselves sufficiently advanced in intelligence as to abolish
the A.n. year, which is irregular, owing to proceeding from 3996, 4004 and 4000, and that
for the purposes of systematising both history and astronomical science, we shall
amend our present humiliating errors.
The subject commends itself to all nations. The present unscientific system is in-
creasing our difficulties as time rolls on, and therefore it is easy to see that there is a
time coming when the present mode of observing the years will be altered. I would sug-
gest that when the nineteenth century is completed mankind should take up the correct
system and true succession of years by starting what would be Wednesday, Jan. Ist,
1901, a.d., as still 1900, until we reach October, which historically and scientifically is
the first month of the true year. Then, on Wednesday, October Ist, start with the year
as 5900, A.M., and ever afterwards begin the year with that month. If this be done, all
eclipses and transits will “ strike” the years for us like the bell of a parish church clock
and we shall be restored to harmony with the movements of the orbs around us, for
which purpose we are told that their motions are designed.

DATES OF THE SABBATH DAYS DURING THE DELUGE',
1056 a M., or 2340 8.0.
By J- B. Dimblebt, Lecturer on Biblical Chronology, and the Discoverer of the form and
.length of the Ancient Year. Also Discoverer of the Antediluvian and Ancient Heb-
rew Solar Cycles, and first enumerator of all the Eclipses before Christ.
The lunar year 1650, (the flood year) began with the 3rd day of the week, (Tuesday) hence the 6th
of the month would be the first Sabbath Day, (Saturday) of that year. To prove this, see Ist month
of “Antediluvian Almanack for 165(5,” and compare it with the sth year of the “Solar Cycle of the
Antediluvians,” which was the flood year. The dates of this 6th year are the natural succession of
7tb days from the Ist year of the Cycle, in writing out which we unconsciously enumerate nine dates
of the flood derived from the 7th day in the Ist year, by regularly assigning £0 and 29 days alterna-
tely to the months. As the dates all come round again on the same day of the week after seven
years, 1650 must be the sth year of the Cycle, and the sth day of the month the Sabbath Day in a
direct line from the first Sabbath in Kden shown in Creation year,
References — a Genesis vii. 1 with 4; b vii. 11; c viii. 4; d viii. 3 (the 150 days after
40 of rain ending on the 190th day, of the flood, must fall on Sabbath Day, the 29th of
the Bth mouth) ; e viii. 6 (the second 40 days began viii. 5, viz :—22lst to 2tioth day of the
flood, immediately on their expiration the dove was sent out the first day, which unques-
tionably rose from the ark on the Sabbath Day); /viii. 10, the dove sent out the second
time; p viii. 12, dove sent out the third time; k viii. 13, New Year s Day (lunar) and
Sabbatii Day; i viii. 14, earth all dried, end of solar period of 365 days, and Noah leaves
the ark.
The above nine Sabbath Days come down in unbroken weeks from the creation of man
and the first Sabbath in Eden, the Ist day of that week being a triple alliance—the lunar
year of 854, the solar period of 305 days, and astronomical lunar cycle all starting
together 1656 solar years before the flood -a splendid and marvellous event and a great
scientific fact, verified by all the eclipses.
All the years of the Bible were of the above form, that is, lunar, and divided into
months and dates of the month in the same way as we divide our solar year of ?6'J days.
This will be seen by the following pages which are the twelve months of the year 1056 and
the two months of 1657—the flood period. When weeks of seven days are observed, but
not without, years form themselves into solar cycles. The Antediluvian cycle comprised
seven years, as seen on page 21, where the reader will find the flood year. 1656, as the
fifth year of .the cycle. This shows that the Antediluvians notified the seventh, or
Sabbath day, from Creation, because it is this continuance of dating the seventh days
that brings the dates of the month round again in seven years. Our solar cycle is 28
years, because we adopt one day every fourth year—leap vear—and thus 4 times 7 are
28. Example ;If a man was born on Sunday, the sth of May, 1850, he would be 28
years old on the same date of the month and same day of the week in 1878. On the 21st
page it will be seen that we get the year 1656, as the flood year, from Genesis v.
Beautiful, however, as the proof is of the truthfulness of the flood year and dates in the
following pages, and splendid also as showing that Creation year was 1,656 years pre-
viously, yet this is only one of five methods of proving the scientific and unalterable
character of Bible history. They are all magnificently proved by the succession of the
lines of eclipses and transits in their cycles.

THE FLOOD PERlOD—Concluded.
FIRST TWO MONTHS OF THE LUNAR YEAR 1057, A.M.
Period of the Flood concluded.
It will be seen by the figures on the right that Noah was in the ark the full solar
period of 365 days, and that the incidents of the flood occurred on nine sabbath days,
the lunar month having, as now, alternately 30 and 29 days.
It is interesting also to observe that as the dates of the flood are true solar time*
proved by the lunar cycle, as those of 1656, the years given us in Gen. v, as the births
of the patriarchs, coupled with the 600 years of Noah, amounting also to 1656 years,
are a marvellous record of historical accuracy, and not the “ poetry ” or the “ legendary
tales” which some rash and unscientific writers have recently called them.
As a chronologist, I feel a difficulty in finding words to express my admiration of the
original or antediluvian form of years. A lunar year cannot be played with as we play
with our solar year. It was formed by the phases of the moon, which, like a great
clock in the firmament registered, when new, the beginning, and when full, middle of a
month, and was beyond the reach of human power to alter a moment of time. It was
a Divine appointment when time was instituted in Eden, in breaking away from which
we have involved ourselves in a host of complications which must ever increase as
time goes on. The original, or antediluvian solar cycle of seven simple astronomical
years, is another feature of the lunar year which has the stamp of Divinity. Like the
number of the days of the lunar year, the solar cycle contained 354 sabbath days, and
when the intercalary days were added, the sabbath days were 365, like the number of
days in the solar year. The years of Enoch, 365, seem to proclaim the same grand
astronomical fact of which Noah’s detention in the ark was another symbol. As an
unalterable period of time, the lunar year continued in use from creation to the
destruction of Jerusalem, and, indeed, is now observed by the Jews, though they are
plainly wrong in the way in which they have twice sought to recover the true compu-
tation of yeais. In fact, as scientific men, we cannot get away from the first chapter
of Genesis. It bears the stamp and superscription of Deity, and as the beginning of
time it is a chain which no man can sever withont driving the spheres of heaven out
of their courses. As a chronologist and an astronomer, lam obliged to continue the
use of the lunar year. It is simple and makes half its own calculations. ' All the sab-
bath days of this work are the seventh days of the astronomical line from creation.

The first or creation year on this solar cycle
!• year 0, and the 2nd year, like t e second
hour of a clock, is 1 We court our age this
way as past time. But only the first seven
years of this cycle count as fix.
The seventh or sabbath days of the inter-
calary period would t e: —
7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 70 77.
The cycle is proved by the “selfsame day’*
of the week falling 12(' yeais back on ihe same
day the flood began. bee Geo. vii. 13. and
compare with the selfsame day in Ex. xit 41.

the second. To prevent this great dilemma,
tho nations using the lunar year employed ex-
tra days, culled “intercalary.” Seven times 11
are 77. The Antediluvians could use no less,
and their dates show tiiat they used them at
tho end of each 7th year, and thus began their
solar cycle as at creation. This would not dis-
turb the regular observance of the 7th, or sab-
bath day, because 77 days are just 11 weeks.
Now that they did this is evident from the fact
that the 133rd lunar year is the solar year also.
Tho moon is always now, on the same day after
19 solar years. This is known in astronomy as
the Metonic, or lunar cycle, and to apply it wo
must square 7 with 19. See following page.
It is certain, then, that by putting in the ex-
tra days at the end of the cycle, the lunar aud
solar years began together ; not exactly so, as
at the end of two cycles they have put in an
extra week, because 15 years require 171 inter-
calary days. This is a beautiful scientific test
of the precise solar length of the Antediluvian
years, an unquestionable demonstration of tho
true historical character of the book of Genesis,
and the Divine origin of time.
THE ANTEDILUVIAN SOLAR CYCLE. (Showing the Dates of all the Sabbath Days.)
year of each solar cycle, or seven years, we see
that 1652 was a first year ; therefore 1653 would
be a 2nd, 1654 a 3rd, 1655 a 4th, aud 1656 a sth.
The dates, then, of the sth year prove the flood
to have occurred in 1650. Now see Gen. v.: —
Seth was born when Adam was 130 years old,
Enos „ Seth „ 105 „
Cain an „ Enos ~ 90 ~
Mahaleel „ Cainan ~ 70 ~
Jared „ Mahaleel., 05 „
Enoch ~ Jared ~ 162 „
Methuselah „ Enoch „ 05 ~
Lamech ~ Methuselah 187 ~
Noah ~ Lamech ~ 182 ~
Gen. Tii.ll. Flood came when Noah was 000 ~
1650 or 2340 b. 0*
We here find that scripture history and science
agr.ee. But the most grand proof is, all the
eclipses we now see necessitate the occurrence
of the total eclipse No. 43, line xii., in 1656, a.m.,
which again requires No. 1 at Creation. (Bee
Antediluvian Eclipses and list of Astronomical
Years.) We can next apply a stern test to prove
these years were made up to solar periods. As
the lunar year is 11 days short of the solar, the
seasons would in 20 years be reversed aud the
dates of the 7th days of the first year get into
The -unalterable construction of this solar
syolo is seen as follows ; It is seven lunar ye irs
of 854 days each, or 12 revolutions of the moon.
As the moon completes a revolution round the
•arth in 29J days, the ancients alternately used
SO and 29 days for their months in order to
keep up with her movements, and thereby be-
gin each year, as well as every mouth, with a
Sew moon. If we therefore commence to put
on a piece of paper each 7th day we shall write
all the figures here printed. Thus the fourth
7th, or sabbath, day in the first month, is 28th.
As we have two days to spare, they make the
first sabbath of the second month to fall on the
6th of the month. When we have in this way
written seven years, we shall find that we can
write no more, bei-auso the dates come round
again. An eighth year would be like the first.
This is the meaning of a solar cycle. We shall
also find that wo have unconsciously written
nine of the scriptural dates of the Flood, viz.,
in the sth year and the first two months of the
6th year. The Flood, we are told in Gen. v.,
was in 1656, a.m. I.'-t us see if these dates were.

/JTABLE OF FIR3T YE ARS OF THE ANTEDILUVIAN (SOLAEJ CYCLE.'
Dating by this Cycle ceased at the end of 1721 AM.
The following are 7th years and therefore the Ist of each successive Cycle of Seven.
Each of the years enumerated below began on the Ist day of the week, Sunday
having their first Sabbath on the 7th day, Saturday. They are therefore all Table!
of the seven repeating years, or solar cycle, showing the dates of the Antediluvian
Sabbaths. Those marked • also commenced a sevenfold lunar cycle—a beautiful
scientific proof that the years were made solar. The lunar cycle being a measure of
19 years, to work it upon a scale of seven years, must be used sevenfold—7 times
19 are 133—hence the expiration of each 133 years reproducing the dates of creation
week and year, is an unquestionable demonstration that the shorter lunar years were
lengthened to the solar years by adding extra or intercalary days.
To find 1656, the flood year, it will be seen that 1652 was a first year on the solar
cycle, therefore table 2 is 1653, table 3 is 1654, table 4 is 1655, and table 5 is 1656.
It will be seen by the an-
nexed table of Sabbaths of
every seven years, which
form the solar cycle or re-
peating years of the ante-
diluvians, that when they
are backed np to the time of
creation, namely, 1656 years
| before the flood, that the
| first sabbath was the 7th
| day of the Ist month of the
first year! Hence it is plain
i that time was instituted in
| Eden, and that the date of
creation is an historical and
scientific fact.
It will be seen by the
solar cycle on the other page
that the dates of the deluge
al v ays came round again on
the same days of the week
when the year was the fifth
of the cycle, or sevenfold
series. Taking 1652, which
the annexed table of first
years supplies, the fifth of
the cycle is 1656 having the
same dates for Sabbaths as
those printed in black type
with scriptural references in
the explanation of the nine
Sabbaths in Noah’s diary of
the deluge. How beautiful
is this! It proves that the
dates of creation and the
deluge are historical facts
and the Bible the Log Book
of the World.
These seventh years were not originally written in the simple order as printed.
They were worked backwards from the flood. Having first found the true form
of the deluge year, the next step was to obtain the solar cycle by ascertaining how
many years elapsed before the dates repeated themselves on the same Sabbath days.
When this was done the years were backed in sevens, and it was found that they
exactly took in the 1656 years obtained in Genesis v., and began the first Sabbath in
Eden on the 7th day of the Ist month.
The lunar cycle being 19 solar years (a period of 235 lunations when the moon is
again new at the same time and place), we have a beautiful scientific proof that the
antediluvians carefully added the necessary extra intercalary days, otherwise it could
not fall on a first year. These are great scientific facts. What creation was this
work does not undertake to say, but it was the Divine institution of time and the
origin of man—Adam’s years are the progress of time.

THE LUNAR CYCLE.
THE SECOND LINE OF ASTRONOMICAL TIME. HISTORY SYSTEMISED.
A Lunar Cycle—sometimes called Metonic
Cycle in honour of Meton, its discoverer—is
a period of 19 tropical years, or 19 years, two
hours, and four minutes, when the same new
moon occurs. Thus if a man saw the moon
new, apparently resting on the top of a dis-
tant church spire, and the clock struck nine
m the evening, he might see the moon again
new 19 years afterwards, at four minutes
past eleven, and in the same position. The
period is a measure of time, 325 lunations,
which will guage all past time by measuring
it off as a man might measure off a firkin of
wine with a standard pint jug.
Apply this to the Antediluvian Solar Cycle
and it will show that every 133rd year was
the same as the Ist year, that is beginning
with Sunday and having Saturday on the
7th day of the month.
The process is fully explained in the page
Table of First Tears of each Antediluvian
Solar Cycle, showing that to square 7 with 19
we must take the Solar Cycle seven-fold.
Thus seven times 19 are 133. Every 133rd
year is in that page marked *, and it falls on
a first year. If it fell on any other year, it
would show that the patriarchs had not kept
correct time, or had not properly observed
the intercalary days.
The following is an astronomical method
for proving the year of the FLOOD:
Table 2 of Solar Cycle was year 1653
Hence table 3 was 1654, table 4 was 1655 and
table 5 was 1656, upon which we find the
dates of the Flood, in Gen. vii. and viii.; and
from chap. v. we find the Flood year was 1656.
The above is historical time, or years a.m.
They would be 1 less if we start year 0 as 1.
This Lunar Cycle proves all periods of his-
tory. It settles the doubts of men respecting
the length of the years of the patriarchs. Wo
find that they were solar, and that although
the ancients only divided the lunar year into
weeks and months, yet they observed the an-
nual revolution of the earth as a solar period,
the precise length of which they have known
and observed better than we have.
The 15 years of the Ancient Hebrew Solar
Cycle are also proved by the Lunar cycle,
and show us that there has not been a day
lost or added improperly since time began.
15 times 19 are 285, therefore every 285th
year is the first of the Solar Cycle, having
Saturday on the 7th of the month as at Crea-
tion. It works in this way down to the pre-
sent year, giving us a simple and unquestion-
able proof that unbroken weeks of seven
days have come down to us from Eden. It
could not be otherwise with lunar years which
no man can alter if he tried. The Lunar
Cycle is the natural production of lunar time.
We cannot fool and muddle about the lunar
year as we have done with the solar period.
It is the production of the motions of the
moon, and being sternly astronomical, we
cannot alter it nor the multiplication table.
The eclipses and transits would mock us if we
touch the Lunar Cycle, the Second Line of
Astronomical Time. Alas! they mock ns
now because we inherit pagan time. We as-
sign dates to them with which they have no
proper concurrence.
Any history to which the Lunar Cycle will
not apply must be rejected as spurious. That
of Babylon and also that of Assyria are good,
and have a close relationship to scripture;
but Chinese history is purely mythological
earlier than 1796, a.m., which was soon after
the dispersion from Babel.
Neither can any system of Chronology be
worth attention which is incompatible with
this and other systematic scientific measure-
ments. It is supreme folly to put 80 years
into a Lunar Cycle of 19 years, which must
be done if the hap-hazzard systems of Hales
and Deutch are followed. Of all the old
Chronologists Usher was the truest. His
line of history commences 4004, instead of
3996 b. 0., the true year of the nativity, as all
chronologists now admit. Allow Usher these
eight years and the length of his line is cor-
rect, but for want of a scientific system, he
could not adjust some of the Biblical dates.
The great advantage of the Lunar Cycle is that it absolutely determines the precise suc-
cession of years and days. For instance, the Ancient Hebrew Solar Cycle began with 1722,
hence every 285th year must be the same as the Ist as to the dates of the Sabbath Days.
If the historical dates showed that this was not so, it would be a sure proof of a departure
from a true consecutive record. « It will also be seen that the first year of the cycle always
alternately ends with 2or 7. Antediluvian time has this systematic precision by the Lunar
Cycle in lengths of 188 years. This is grand work! Instead of doubting we must admire!


HOW ANY MAN CAN PROVE THE DATE OF
CREATION AND THE FLOOD.
The annexed page (the Antediluvian Solar Cycle) has brought me hundreds of letter*
of congratulation. It gives, even to a child, the means of proving the historical record
of the creation of the present order of tilings of the world and the year of the Flood.
The simple way of doing this is as follows:
First reckon up the years of the world when each of the Patriarchs was horn, as given
us in Genesis v. The line is consecutive from father to son, and the years are tabulated
under the solar cycle, where they produce a total of 165 G as the Flood year.
Look next at the Antediluvian Solar Cycle, It contains seven years and cannot be
longer or shorter because seven years bring round the day of the week upon the same
date of the mouth. This is the meaning of a Solar Cycle, or cycle of days produced by
the sun. The figures are the dates of the seventh or Sabbath Days of each month, and
they could never alter. Thus the first month of the first year of each cycle had always
its Sabbath Days onjthe 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th of the month. Indeed every figure of
the Solar Cycle is the consecutive date of the seventh day. The years are lunar, and
therefore the months have alternately 30 and 29 days. This arrangement is now ob-
served by the Jews, Turks, and Chinese, and has the moon new on the Ist day of each
month, because the moon travels round the earth in 29J days, so that by borrowing the
half day from every other month, the moon was like a great clock in the sky—new at
the beginning and full in the middle of the month. A boy when blindfolded, and
bearing in mind that lunar months have alternately 30 and 29 days, could repeat all the
figures of the Solar Cycle, and he would unconsciously mention nine of the ten dates of
the Flood in the sth year of the cycle and the two first months of the 6th year. This
proves that the sth year was the Flood year.
We have next to see whether this sth year of the cycle ever became 1656. It did, and
the proof is as follows: As the Cycle is 7 years, 236 cycles are 1652. Therefore, the Ist
year of the cycle would be 1652, the 2nd 1653, the 3rd 1654, the 4th 1655, and the 6th
(the year we are looking for) would be 1656. In this sth year we have the Flood dates,
as shown in a previous page giving the dates of the Deluge. N.B. The reason why 1652
was a first year of the cycle, and not the last is, creation year is 0, as is the first of a life.
As we can now precisely determine the accuracy of the year of the Flood, we can
with the same astronomical precision fiud the the date or first day of creation. It is
manifest that this was Sunday, the Ist day of the week, the Ist day of the month, and
the Ist year of the Solar Cycle, or in other words, 1656 years before the Flood. We
cannot have one date without the other- It is the Solar Cycle which gives us the power
to determine both, and let it be remembered that the Lunar Cycle is a high scientific
way for showing that the Solar Cycle has been carried on correctly.
It is still more satisfactory to know that every day of the Solar Cycle is required
by the Eclipse Cycle, the working of which in its “ tell-tale,’’ or progressive character,
shows the necessary consecutive years, and like the two Transit Lines of time, supplies
the day of the week with which each year has begun. These are all explained.
From the epoch of Creation, to the end of September, 1883, A.D., was 5882 years. As
this is a period determined by Five Lines of Astronomical Time, we cannot alter it with-
out altering the motions and orbits of the planets. They are a clock whose wheels we
cannot reach. How precise and continuous are their splendid movements!
We must admit that one of the impressive and brilliant features of Creation is the
high scientific character of its date. We cannot suppose 'ihat the dale was given by
the writers merely to show that there was such a date. W, At did the Antediluvians, or
Moses who quotes from theii records, know about the transit* of Mercury? We must
accept the date as a reference to an event, in the same way as tie birth of a child. The
events are stated to be a reconstruction of the face of the world (This is the least con-
struction we can accept) and the introduction of intelligent an. moral man, because
the same writers who give ns the date inform ns that before Ao.'Ta “ there was not a
man to till the ground.” Some men say that Adam was the head of a new race. But
if the writers of Scripture are so marvellously correct with the date, ought we not to give
them credence for the facts which they supply ? Besides this it is evident that the date
has been carried on consecutively, and if the events were not correct it would not he pos-
sible to record anything which the early generations of men would know was act true.
Men°should beware of teaching what is speculative, because experience show* that as
true science advances, it has often destroyed theory and brought its advocates w> shame


fIOW THE LINE OP CONSECUTIVE SOLAR YEARS OBTAINED FROM THE
BIRTHS OF PATRIARCHS IS PROVED TO BE ASTRONOMICAL.
• The way of testing the scientific correctness of the foregoing tables is simple when
understood. It is as follows:
Ist. By the solar cycle. It will be seen by the foregoing table of the Antediluvian
Patriarchs that Methuseleh, who owing to his long life we may select as an example,
died in 1636, which was the flood year. We know this because we find, by compiling
from Gen. v., that he was born in 687*, and lived 969 years. We also find that as the
flood year was 1656, beginning on the 17th of the second lunar month (Gen. vii. 11), Me-
thnseleh must have died not many days before the flood. We should had no know-
ledge in what year the deluge came without first obtaining the year iu which this great
patriarch was born ; therefore as we can by several stern scientific methods prove the
year of the deluge, we at the same time prove beyond question the year when Methu-
seleh and the other patriarchs were born, especially when we cannot suppose that the
ancients knew anything about the transits of Mercury or Venus by which the accuracy
of the year is also determined. To prove, then, that Methuseleh was born in 637, and
died in 1656, we have only to look at the Antediluvian solar cycle for the latter year.
Thus there are seven years in the cycle. There cannot be more, because if we wrote out
an eighth year, it would be like the first. Seven years bring the dates round again on
the same days of the week. Divide 1656 by 7, and the product is 1652 with 4 over.
Hence the first year of the solar cycle was 1652, the second was 1653, the third 1654,
the fourth 1655, and the fifth 1656, or flood year. Now it will be found by reading
Gen. vii and viii., that the dates of the month used iu Noah’s diary of the deluge are in
the sth year of the cyclef. Therefore the solar cycle by its natural progression proves
that Methuseleh was born in 687, and also proves all the other records concerning the
patriarchs. The reader must boar iu mind that this is an astronomical proof, that is
the natural succession of days numbered by dates, and controlled by the observance of
weeks of seven days, without which no solar cycle can exist. It is also an astronomical
record of the motions of the moon, new on the first day of every month and year.
There are ten dates supplied in the diary of the flood, nine of which are Saturdays, or
tire old Sabbath days. This is plain because it will be seen that they are the natural
succession from the first figure 7on the cycle. This will be best understood by looking
at the “ Flood Period,” which is an Almanack of every day of the Flood Year. Bible
history is remarkable for showing that this distinction is given to spiritual events. It
should also be stated that as Noah was a solar year iu the ark, he entered it on the first
day of the solar year, which in the sth year of the cycle began on the 17th of the 2nd
month of the lunar year, and left on the last day of the same solar year.
2. The second proof that Methuseleh was born iu 657 is obtained by submitting that
year and the year of his death to the testing power of the Metonie, or Lunar Cycle. As
the lunar year has only 354 dsys, which is eleven short of the solar year, the Antedilu-
vians would have to use about 77 extra or intercalary days (7 times 11 are 77) at the
end of each solar cycle. This would bring the lunar year abreast with the solar year,
and every cycle would begin correctly as the first started. They, and all the ancients
using the lunar year had to adopt a course like this, otherwise the seasons would
get lar out of their place. Now the Metonie Cycle consists of 19 solar years, 2 hours
and 4 minutes. This is a perfect and unalterable period of time and can be applied to
the measurement of thousands of years. For instance, supposing a man looked through
a hole in a building on the Ist of January wheu the clock struck three in the morning.
* The year of the world in which each of the patriarchs was born, is easily obtained
by writing the age of their fathers when they had a son. Thus:
Seth was born when his father Adam ...was 130, which was year 130
Enos do. do. Seth ...was 105, do. 235
Cainan do. do. Enos ...was 90, do. 325
Mahalaleel do. do. Cainan ...was 70, do. 395
Jaied do. do. Mahalaleel was C 5, do. 400
Enoch do. do. Jared ...was 162, do. 622
Methuseleh do. do. Enoch ...was 65, do. 687
Lantech do. do. Methuseleh was 187, do. 874
Noah do. do. Lamelh ...was 182, do, 1056
Gen. vii. 11, Flood came when Noah...was 600, do. 1656
Total 1656, the flood year.
T The year 1652 would be the last of the solar cycle; but creation year was 0, and
the first cycle only counts as 6 years. A child is not 7 years old till in his Bth year.


and he saw the new moon apparently resting on the top of a church spire, if he looked
again through the same aperture 19 years afterwards, four minutes after the clock struck
five, he would see the moon new again, and in the same position, apparently on the
top of the spire. To apply this visible fact to the measurement of time is not difficult,
and it is absolutely reliable for its precision. Let it be used to show the accuracy of the
working of the solar cycle by determining what years began like creation year, with the
first Saturday on the 7lh of the month. To do this we square the 19 solar years of the
Metonic Cycle with the seven years of the Solar Cycle. Seven times 19 are 133, there-
fore every year after 133 will begin like creation year. (See page following Antediluvian
solar cycle of seven years, where this measurement is carried out).
8. The third proof that Methuseleh died in 1656, because he was bom in 687 and lived
969 years, is by the Eclipses. If we have not a year of eclipses for each of the 1656
years, that number of years never existed, or in other words Methuseleh did not live
the years stated. Now when we take 1656 years of eclipses in the Christian era, they
cover the same number of years of the Antediluvian period and work the solar cycle
by producing the nine flood dates in 1656. Besides this, the position of the pure lunar
year would not otherwise be where it is from the point of creation, if we do not
precisely allow these patriarchal years. They agree with the progress of the pure lunar
year and therefore no astronomer can reject them. This is deep, but very splendid.
It will be seen by the Eclipse Chronometer that the Maximum Cycle was completed by
the total solar eclipse on the 21st Dcmbr. 1843. The pure lunar year brought it
there and formed a junction with the solar year. Had there been an error of one year
in the record given us in Gen. T. of the births of the patriarchs, the eclipses would
show it, because they would not repeat their dates of occurrenee after 649 years, nor
preserve their companionship with the transits of Venus, or maintain the proper posi-
tion of the pure lunar year in its regular advance of the solar period.
4. The fourth scientific method of proving that Methuseleh died in 1656, after living
969 years, is by the transits of Mercury. If men fight against the years of scripture
history, they must fight against the transits also. There are 92 years between any
transit of the planet Mercury and its reoccurrence. For the sake of simplicity we may
use No. 1, as shown in the list of transits. It is easy to see with what day of the
week each of these 92 years began, and in this way on the Antediluvian solar cycle
they will prove the form of every year up to year 0, a.m. Worked in this way, we shall
find that the transit of Mercury on Saturday, the 9th of May, 1891, will also be Satur-
day, the 13thof the Bth month of the 2rd year of the Antediluvian Solar Cycle, 5888,
jl.m. which is 5889 astronomical. Transits have a compauiouship with eclipses, but
nothing so powerfully proves all past years and their natural succession than transits.
Unlike eclipses they are solar time and therefore more simple in their use for measuring
time. Whoever talks about ancient years, without noticing the testimony of transits
will place himself in a ludicrous position. Aguoslics, if they are willing to learn, may
obtain instruction from them. Their voice is louder than thunder.
5. The fifth proof of the years of the patriarchs is that we derive from the planet
Venus. They form a line of time independent of those of Mercury, but are worked in
a similar way. The reader can see the way they are used by consulting the tables.
I think that what I have stated will be sufficie.it to convince every intelligent man
that the records which we have of the patriarchs are correct, seeing that they bear the
test of scientific investigation. That test is simply this: Supposing I have a running
account at a bank, a clerk could tell me how that account stood. He would do so by
his knowledge of common ascertained facts. That is to say, having found that there
are 12 pennies in a shilling, and 20 shillings in a sovereign, he could add up all the items
of my account and supply the total. In like manner, when we have ascertained the
value of periods of time, we can supply a true total, or test the correctness of any total
we desire to investigate. We do this by our knowledge of common facts, such as the
following: There are 365 i days in a solar year; 18 years and 10 to 11 days in an eclipse
cycle; 19 years 2 hours, and 4 minutes in the Metonic cycle; 649 solar years in a great
astronomical year; 7 years in the Antediluvian, 15 in the Ancient Hebrew, and 28 in
our Solar Cjcle; 92 years in the transits of Mercury, 486 in those of Venus, Sc a., See. By
any of these well ascertained facts we can count up anything referring to time, and
the results obtained by one man will not differ from those found by any other person.
After these statements it will be seen and understood that it is within the power of
all men-to prove the scientific accuracy of the history given in the book of Genesis,

Periods of years formed by the consecutive reigns of tings of different nations afford
ready facilities for showing years of past time. They are also valuable for comparison,
as it frequently occurs in the pages of history that contemporary monarchs ate men-
tioned. For example, in 2 Kings xix., three kings are referred to, namely, Hezekiah of
Judea, Sennacherib of Assyria, and Tirharkah of Egypt.
The A.M. years afford facilities for addition, subtraction, cr divisions of periods. But
to find the 80. year, deduct the a.m. from 4004, and to get the correct year before
Christ deduct from 3996.

VALUABLE DISCOVERIES CONCERNING THEIR COMMENCEMENT.
A splendid discovery has been made by Mr. Theo. G. Pinches, the persevering and
ta'ented translator of cuneiforms at the British Museum, London, the result of which is,
we find that the first dynasty of the kings of Babylon began at the Dispersion, 100 years
after the Flood, which occurred in ICSG, a.m. The subject came to my notice in May,
1891. Whilst at the Museum, Mr. Pinches showed me a list of all the Dynasties of the
Kings of Babylon which he had recently translated from a tablet of unbaked clay, found
amongst many others brought to London from Babylon three years ago. It is partly
illegible, owing to age, but it supplies a confirmation of the beginning of the kingdom of
Babylon about 1770, a.m. We have now, therefore, three sources for this information;
1. from Scripture. 2. from the records of eclipses shown to Alexander the Great, when
he conqured Babylon in 3072, and 3. the tablet just mentioned.
Respecting tbe records of eclipses, Calisthenes, who was with Alexander, states that
they had been continued for 1903 years from the commencement of the kingdom. Sub-
tracting these 1903 years from 3073, we have 1770, the period of confusion of tongues.
The following is a copy of Mr. Pinches’s list, but I have changed his b-c- into a.m.
years by deducting them from 4001. They are now subject to all rules of arithmetic,
and indicate their consecutive order.
* There were three kings of similar name, but this could not be Khammuragas, the
Klamite, who reigned only 1C years. + The name is illegible, but it is probably the
king of Shmar (Babylonia) mentioned in Gen. xiv. 1. in 20.11. J This king was a con-
temporary with Ameuhotep 111., of Egypt, who reigned 2357 to 2393, and whose records
slate that a correspondence occurred respecting their giving each oilier their daughters in
marriage; the name is Kalamma Sin on the Egyptian records, but it is likely that he is
the same person, in which case we have another confirmation of the period when Amen-
hotcp XIL reigned, for it is disputed by “ genealogical *’ chronos. J Tour added by En.

* This was also the name of Ka-ra-mur-us (2360) who is mentioned in the records of
Assyria as warring with Assur.risisi. f This is the Merodach-haladan of Isaiah xxxix
1. and as his father only reigned a month, we see why he is particularized as “ the son
of Baladiu.” {He was placed on the throne by Sennacherib, who removed him three
years afterwards, and raised Assur-nadin-sumi. The records of Sennacherib slate this.
The fall of the kingdom of Babylon is, like that of the end of proud Assyria, a great
and impressive event in history. Many incidents of both kingdoms confirm Biblical
records, which although challenged by schemers, always come oil victorious when our
discoveries and knowledge increase. The statement in 2 Kings xxv. 27, is remarkable.
It gives the first year of Amil-Maruduk as 37 years after the captivity which began in
3406). Our knowlege is so perfect now on many of these points that the records of one
nation confirm those of another. But here I should like to say, that as the Jewish pun-
ishment clearly began in 34('6), and is to continue 2520 years, it ends in 5920 J. Hence,
as the Gentile times are to end 30 years previously, we must see important events
in 5896) (our 1803 at Easter). We have therefore a subject of great interest before us.
BABYLONIAN HISTORY CONTINUED.


KINGS OF ASSYRIA,
FOLLOWING AFTER THE FIRST SIX ROYAL CITIES.
Historical Table viii.
Like the history of Babylon, we have no record of Assyrian kings before the Flood ia
1636, and we see that as Assur left Babylon to found Nineveh (Gen. x. 11.) the former
city mast have been the seat of a kingdom more ancient than that of Nineveh. Berosus,
the ancient historian, assures us of this, and all records show that in its early existence
Assyria was much mixed up with the older kingdoms at Ur, Ereoh, Karrack, Lasar and
Akkad, mentioned in Genesis x. and in cuneiform tablets.
UK seems to have been one of the oldest royal cities; when population was yet small
Abraham left it on Tuesday, the 15th of the 7th month, 2082. This date is an astronomi-
cal record and produced the same day of the week, with the same date, at the end of 430
years. .As only 2082 J to 2513 J will do this, the date, or period, is absolutely sure. The
names of the kings were Urukh, Dungi (his son), Su-Agu, Amar-Agu, Ihit-Agu, ice,
Ur was 300 miles N. of Babylon, and near Ararat where the ark rested.
ERECH was another of the six early city-kingdoms, but was of short duration. One
of its kings, Kudar-lagamar, is mentioned in Gen. xiv. 1. where he is called Chardor-
laomar. His war was 2091. Another ruler was Kndur-Marbuk, who reigned 30 years.
Owing to its proximity to Babylon, 110 miles, S.E., Krcch may be called its sister-city.
Both Ur and Ereoh subsequently became subject to Karrak.
KARRAK lasted nearly 300 years. We have the following kings : Gamal-ninip (or
Adar) Limit-nana, Ismi-Dagon, and Gungunnuv.
LARSA, called El-Lassar in Gen. xiv) was contemporary with Karrak to some extent.
Kings . Nur-Rimmon, Gasin, Sin-Idina, Arioch, and Risa-Agu. Karrak, in its turn, had
to give way to Larsa where the great conqueror Khammuragas had his throne 16 years.
BABYLON, which seems to have suffered a drag, subsequently became a great city
and kingdom, surviving as it had preceded Assyria. In common with other king-
doms from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean, Babylon became tributary to Sargon,
of Akkad, and a few years after his death, to Khammuragas, an Elamite king of Larsa.
It is said that the latter fixed his throne in Babylon, but this may not be altogether
correct, because he and Sargon were great victors like Alexander the Great and Napoleon.
Babylon was 290 miles S. of Nineveh. Nimrod its founder flourished before the disper-
sion, and became renowned for first destroying the beasts of these well-watered plains.
AKKAD the last royal city, save Babylon, 100 miles N., is in Genesis x. 10, called
Accad, and was another city founded by Assur. It lasted three centuries and one of its
latest kings was Sargon who for his great success in subduing other princes, may be
styled an emperor. He subdued all Babylonia, about 2340, and thus became the dom-
inant Sovereign, placing all other kings under tribute. He re-built Akkad after it had
been pillaged, and reigned altogether 45 years. He was succeeded by his son, Naran-
Sin, but the empire soon fell to pieces, for alter the death of Sargon, the various tribu-
tary kings revolted. This was c bout 2350. It would appear that the tributary kings
had the help of Khammuragas (also known as Hammarabi) an Elamite king, but it was
only like jumping out of the frying-pan into the fire, for Khammuragas subjected them
to a more galling yoke about 2360. Sargon established a great library. He must not
be confounded with Sargon 11. in 3283. As Akkad was the last of the royal cities, and
Sargon almost its last monarch, we see when he reigned. The period is also confirmed
by the establishment of an “independent kingdom ” in Assyria, for soon after Akkad
we hear of Assyria.
ASSYRIAN KINGS.
2319 Ismi-Dagon reigned 30 years (Was perhaps the king in Karrak).
2349 Sarasi-Vul. 18 years king in Nineveh.
2367 Samsi-Vnl 11. or Samsi-Rimmon. He and Tritak reigned about 26 years.
Tritak who built a “ House of Salvation."
2393 Bel-kaphaphu established an “Independent Kingdom,” which was not under
tribute to Egyptian Pharaohs, Amenhotep 11.—2342 to 2349—had conquered
Nineveh and his two successors received tribute. Consult Kings of Egypt.
2413 Adasi was king. Length of his reign not stated.
2423 Bel-bani, his son, a great conqueror, was king 13 or 20 years.
2438 Assur-zakir-esir, “ Lord of Countries,” about 23.
2463 Ninip-tugal-assuri. How long unknown.
Four kings followed during 127 years, and Babylon was allied to Assyria by a
marriage of the daughter of Assur-üballit to the king of Babylon.
2590 Assur-üballit. In his reign an Egyptian king was unsuccessful in penetrating
eastward. Twenty years later Kara-hardas, son of the Assyrian princess just
named, took the Babylonian throne, but was slain and Naiz-bugas succeeded.


2GIO Bel-nirari began at Assur about this time. He was son of Assur-üballit and madi
his son Knri-galnzi king of Babylon after killing Nazi-bugas.
2G50 Budil succeeded his father 801-nirari, reigning 20 years. Miii-sipak k. at Babylon
2670 Vul-nirari I, also called Bammram-nirari began and reigned SO years.
2700 Shalmaneser I. reigned 29 years. He defeated the Egyptians,
2729 Tugulti-ninip, styled “King of Nations,” reigned 30years.
2759 Bel-kudur-uzur. Length of reign unknown, but apparently about 10.
2769 Ninip-pal-eser 20 years. [First 13 kings on this page synchronize with time ol
2789 Assur-dan 1., 30 years. Book of Judges and 20th Egyptian Dynasty,]
2819 Mutak-kil-nusku was king during nearly 20 years.
2839 Assur-rishi, son of preceding.
2869 Xugulti-pal-eser, or Tiglatb-pileser, 20 years. He was not the monarch mentioned
in the scriptures 400 years later. Sennacherib states that he was defeated by
the Babylonians 418 years before his own invasion of that country. This is an
important statement as it refutes what is said by Mr. Boscawin about Tiglath
Pileser I. reigning in 1684, a.m. (1120 b. 0.). Sennacherib began in 3293, after
the Ten Tribes of Israel were taken into captivity by his father, Sargon 11.
2889 Samsi-yul, brother of preceding, came to the throne, 9 years.
2898 Merodach-nadin-akhi, after whom the history is bnd, but we have Assnr-rabu-amot
defeated by Aram, king of Syria, which probably occasioned the breach.
3039 Assur-dan 11. began and reigned 33 years.
3072 Vul-niari 11. also called Eamman-nirari, his son, reigned 22 years, after which tha
history is again broken, but we hear of Simmas-sipak reigning 17 years and
Ulbar-surki-idini, 6 years, also some little kings; the century is not quite blank,
3094 Tugulti-ninip 11, reigned 6 years from this date.
A New Empire. OAn Eclipse identifies the year.
3101 Assur-bani-pal 1., also called Assur.natsir-apli, son of preceding king, began and
reigned 45 years. He instituted a new empire and we are indebted to him for
recording an eclipse of the sun which fixes the exact year of his accession. It
was © No. 70, Line xviii. It has also been calculated at the Observatory and
found to have occurred at the time I have given in July. 903, B.c. (3101, a.m.).
But 903 is practically useless inasmuch as it is only a proof of events and reigns
we know from 4004 back to 903, B.o. ; whereas 3100 proves events and reigns
previous to that year. This is what we most want to prove.
3144 Shalmaneser 11. his son, reigned 35 years. His deeds are recorded on the largo
black obelisk in the British Museum, on which he mentions the tribute paid to
him by Jehu, king of Israel. Jehu began to reign in 3120. J and died in 3148 J.
He was therefore a contemporary with Shalmaneser. See 2 Kings x. 36.
Shalmaneser tells us an eclipse of the sun occasioned a tumult in Nineveh and
caused his beginning to reign. No. 28, Line viii., Ist of 6th month, Easter.
3179 Samsi-vul, his son, reigned 13 years. He seems to be the monarch when Jonah
was in Nineveh. Maruduk-balat-su-ikbi was king of Babylon.
3192 Vul-nirari HI., also called Bamman-Nirari, reigned 9 years.
3221 Shalmaneser IX , his son, reigned 6 years.
3230 Assur-dan II . reigned 15 years. He speaks of an eclipse of the sun. A valuable
record was discovered by Sir. Henry Eawlinson in Nineveh of a notable eclipse
which Sir Goo. Airey and Mr. Hind agreed that it took place about mid-day in
that city on the 15th of June, 763 b.o. from 4004, which was 3241. It will be
seen on my tables Line xv., No. 57, Hebrew Bird’s Eye View, Ist of 6th month,
(June)- 'ibis calculation proves the accuracy of my tables, for the Triple
Eclipse Table, which gives the Ist year of the Bird’s Eye View diagram, shows
that Line I. was 3227, hence, counting downwards, Line xv. was 3241.
This king is styled “ Pul ” when Mehahem reigned in Israel. 2 Kings xv, 19.
NOTE.—We have another important statement, which like that of Sennach-
erib just given, tides us over a long period and also proves tables of history.
Herodotus, who was born in 3520, says the supremacy of Assyria over Babylon
lasted 620 years. This would be from Tugulti-ninip 1., who began to reign in
.2729, and for his conquest of Babylon, &c., was called “ King of nations,’’ to
the anarchy in Nineveh, in 3249.eBerosus, who flourished about 3744, says 526
■years. He probably reckoned np to Tiglath-pileser 11. who began in 3260.
We now come to tumultuous times when Nabonasser, king of Babylon, sub-
dued Assyria in 8257. The date was calculated by Ptolemy by the occurrence
of two total eclipses of the moon Q ® Line xiii. But the Assyrians recovered
.supremacy again till Napolasser in 33761.
ASSYEIAN HISTORY CONTINUED.


8245 Anarchy prevailed three years.
8248 Assur-uiuari 11. ascended, but was driven from the throne 9 years afterwards.
3257 The history indicates three years more of anarchy.
32G0 Tiglath-pileser 11. ascended 73G n.o. and reigned 18 years. He was also made king
of Babylon. See 2 Chronicles xxviii. 20. Ahaz ascended at Jerusalem in 8263.
His application to Tiglath-pileser, mentioned in 2 Kings xvi. 7. is in the records
of Assyria as having occurred in 3265.
8278 Shalmaneser IV. ascended and rcignod 5 years. He warred against Hoshea, king,
of Israel, called Husai in the Assyrian records. Sec 2 Kings xvii. 3. and xviii. 9.
8283 Sargon ascended and reigned 10 years. He carried the ten tribes of Israel into
exile in 3284 a.m., or 712 b.c., which was “ at the end of three years,” or inter-
calary period of the Ancient Hebrew Solar Cycle, table c. He thus completed
the work began by Shalmaneser, and alluding to both monarohs, the Biblical
record (2 Kings xviii. 10) says “ they’’ took Samaria. Two total lunar eclipses
occurred at Babylon in the previous year, 8283, or 713 n.o, (721 old computa-
tion). They are mentioned by Ptolemy, and were Q No\ 49 and 51 Line xiii
the Diagram of the Team of Eclipses. Monumental history records that Shal-
maneser died during the war in Syria, and that Sargon took the, Israelites into
captivity (the ten tribes, not those of Judah). Sibahe, or So, -was king of Egypt.
8293 Sennacherib ascended and reigned 24 years. 2 Kings xviii. 13. and Isaiah xxxvi, 1.
The 14th of Hezekiah at Jerusalem was 3293, tablet The destruction of the
army of Sennacherib was not much later.
8317 Esar-haddon ascended and reigutd 13 years. He sometimes resided at Babylon.
In 2 Kings xix., Sennacherib and Esar-haddon of Assyria, Hezekiah of Jerusa-
lem, and Tirharkah of Egypt, are all mentioned. See Egyptian history.
3330 Assur-bani-pal ascended as sole king, G 66 b.c., and reigned 41 years.
8371 Bcl-zakir-iskum, or Assur-ebil-ile, ascended and reigned 6 years. He perished in-
the flames of his palace, which he fired, when the Babylonians and their allies
entered Nineveh, and thus ended the great Assyrian Empire, as it now became
an adjunct of Babylon where Nabopolasser became king.
8377 End of the Assyrian Empire.
BABYLONIAN HISTORY.
8377 Nabopolassar, crowned king of Babylonia. He was formerly Governor-General at
Babylon, appointed by'the Assyrian monarch reigning at Nineveh.
8398 Nebuchadnezzar ascended at Babylon in the latter half of the year (Table J. of the
Ancient Hebrew Solar Cycle, 598 n. 0.) and reigned 44 years. In 340 G he de-
posed Jehoiachm, at Jerusalem, and carried him and many eminent Jews,
amongst whom were Daniel and Ezekiel, to Babylon. He also placed Zedekiah
on the throne at Jerusalem.
In 3415 he came up to Jerusalem with an army.
In 3416 his army broke up the holy city on the 9th of the 10th civil mouth-
(4th sacred), table o, and on Thursday, the 7th day of the next month, his army
began to burn the Jewish temple. See 2 Kings xxv. 1,9, and Exekiel xxiy. 1.
Zedekiah’s 9th year ended with the middle of 3415, which was the end of the
Hebrew sacred year, and thus Zedekiah’s 11th year fell on 341 G, that is after
the 6th civil month. The Jewish kingdom was thus ended and the second cap-
tivity began in 3416, or 580 8.c., table o. The 70 years commenced with the
7th civil month, Ist sacred, of 3406, which was 590 b.c-
-8443 Amil-Maruduk ascended at Babylon, and was the Evil-Mm-odach of scripture. He
reigned 2 years. “In the year he began to reign he lifted up the head of Je-
hoiachin, king of Judah,” who had been dethroned “37 years.” See 2 King*,
xxv. 27. As 3406 and 37 are 3443, this gives us the Ist year of Amil-Maruduk.
8446 Nergal-zar-;.zur, the Nergalsbarezar of Jeremiah, ascended after murdering his
predecessor. He reigned about 3 years.
8448 Another king was assassinated after a reign of nine months.
3450 Nabu-Imtik, or Nabonidus was made king. Length of reign unknown.
Bel-sar-uzur, the Belshazzar of Daniel, is suppo-ed to have been a grandson of
Nebuchadnezzar. His 3rd year is mentioned in Dan. viii. 1., but his length of
reign is not known.
8466 The Babylonian empire was conquered by the brave Cyrus, and Belshazzar slain
whilst teasting with his lords. The date is obtained by observing that 3408
was the Ist year of Cyrus, table g, See Ezra i. 1. and Dan. v 30, 31.
i.lt ABBITIIAN HISTURV.


I concluded my observations on the first six Royal Cities by stating that soon after
Akkad we hear of Assyria. We will now see when the Assyrian kings began and how
long their empire lasted. But we must first notice that there is an internal between
the rise of the empire, which was in 2076, and the reign of Isrni Dagon in 2319, with
whom the list of kings begins on the Ist page. This is owing to the transference of
power from one city, or small kingdom, to another; it seems, indeed, that the Assyrian
empire was first a confederation of kings in Elam and other places, and the record in
Genesis xiv. of the war between four of them and five tributary kings who had rebelled,
furnishes a good illustration of what existed and how the line began. Thus—
-2076 Kudar-lagamar (Chedor-laomer in scripture), at Elam. ’lhe length of his reign
is not known, but his 14th is mentioned. He reigned long, say 30 years.
2106 Kudar-Mabuk reigned 30 years,
2136 Eisu-Agu (or Eisu-Acu) his son, 10 years, was the last Elamite King.
2146 Unrecorded period of 173 years meets Ismi-Dagon in 2319. Perhaps it was the
period disturbed by the conquests of Khammuragas, who like Sargon 1., sub-
dued Babylon and all the kings from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean.
It is the overwhelming evidence in this chapter of Scripture, and the fact that Jose-
phus calls it a battle of the Assyrians, soon after they had become masters of all Asia,
that fixes the beginning of the empire 14 years previously. The battle was in 2091,
9 years after Abraham left Ur in 2032, one of the most-reliable dates we have.
Other evidence that the Assyrian empire began in 2076, is the state-
ment by Ctesius Cnidus, Diodorus Siculus, Eusebius, and others that the
empire lasted 1300 years. We know that it fell in 33701, under the sword
of Nabopolassar, when Bel-zakir-iskum perished in his'palace, which he
fired with his own hand when he saw the troops of Babylon and Media
enter the city of Nineveh. Deducting 1300 from 3376, we again have 2076
for the beginning of the empire. The same result is obtained by several
other means, as I shall proceed to show, arranging them in tabular form,
because it is important that we should understand this part of history.

The Grecian historians state that Belus enlarged Babylon, and that Niuus, his son,
was the first king of Nineveh ; but both these names seem to be inventions, a common
custom with the old Greek writers. Babylon seems to have been enlarged by building
walls when the Confederation power was developing, subsequently centered at Nineveh.
We have no kings of either Babylon or Assyria before the Flood or Dispi rsion, and
the small kingdoms of six Royal Cities are doubtless an example of the petty dynasties
existing in Egypt about the same time. Indeed Mizraim, the original name of Egypt,
was the uncle of Nimrod. (Compare Gen. xi. 6 and 11 with chapter 1. 11.)
* This was the Dispersion, soon after the Confusion of Tongues, which took place
about a century after the Flood. According to a calculation by Dr. Gyles Strauchus,
population beginning with 8 persons, could increase in 100 years to 32,768, without
twins or triplets which it is said were common in early times. But this rate was not
so rapi4,as that of the Isrcelites in Egypt.
REMARKS ON BABYLONIAN AND ASSYRIAN HISTORIES.


It will thus be seen that the line of time
which I give in this book is one determined
by astronomical data, and cannot be con-
troverted. It is indeed supported by five
astronomical lines and extends from Adam
to the present time. Nothing is left to in-
dividual judgment. It is that known as the
Hebrew version; but this is because it is
the only one which bears the test of the con-
trolling dates of astronomical cycles. As
such it must hold its place whatever else
may be stated concerning Chinese mytholo-
gy. It is very remarkable that where relia-
ble Chaldipan, Chinese, or Egyptian history
commences, it is close to the period known
as the Dispersion. Before this the tradition
of these nations states that they were gov-
erned by gods, which is a reference to the
patriarchs whose long lives and position
entitled them to be regarded as “Sons of
God.” My close and careful investigations
show me that prior to the dispersion there
is no history, monumental or otherwise, ex-
cept that obtained through the Hebrews.
The epoch of Menes, which commenced the
dynasties of Egypt, drawn up by Manetho,
the priest of Heliopolis, three centuries n.c.
began after the dispersion. Thus we have
The Scriptural account, about 1770, a.m.
Beginning of Chaldcean history 1770 „
Chinese history, the Hia ... 1796 „
Egyptian Epoch of Meno ... 1896 „
The Hebrew text gives us no precise date
for the Dispersion, but it is easy to see that
it was rather better than a century after the
Flood. The Babylonian cuneiform tablets
are copies of records made by the Accadians
who used the cuneiform system of writing
and built the great cities of Chaldaea men-
tioned in Gen. x. 10., as Accad, Ac.
I am therefore of opinion that as the
Chaldcean, Chinese, and Egyptian histories
commence with the Dispersion, the mytho-
logical references are fragmentary allusions
to the patriarchal period, which for its great
scientific character we are bound to accept.
Manetho states that the government of the
Egyptians was first by gods; the Chinese
state that they were ruled by gods and god-
descended men, and the system of time
they keep is lunar like that of the Antedilu-
vians, Chaldaeans, ancient Babylonians, and
Hebrews; and it is also plain that the great
Pyramid of Egypt was built by Cheops who
flourished 120 years after the Dispersion.

To show the progression of history, it is always best to give the a.m. year. The n.c. year
breaks the line of view. In the above outline the years are not always to be considered ns
correct, excepting such as are lettered from the solar cycle, for example, 1. e. g. n. &c. The
other years must be regarded as approximate. The outline cannot start earlier than the
Dispersion, because we have no secular history, verbal or monumental, prior to that period.
The greatest antiquities in the British Museum are Egyptian, but they arc all subsequent
to the Dispersion. By eclipses and ancient inscriptions, we shall obtain more reigns of
contemporary monarchs, with scripture, as we have several of Eyypt, Babylon, Ac,; we
shall then classify Manetho’s dynasties of Upper and Lower Egypt, now found to be not
iuctessive but contemporary, as are others of his lists.
HISTORY BYSTEMISED. THE LEADING POWERS.


CUNEIFORM INSCRIPTIONS OF THE UELUOB.
THE CHALDEAN RECORDS.
Mr. H. Rassam, the Assyrian explorer (as explained by himself to me) was fortunate
in discovering a large number of cuneiform tablets on which were written an account of
the Flood and which had formed part of the library of Assur-bani-pal 11. (called Sar-
danapulus by the old Greek writers) who reigned in Nineveh from 3330 to 3371. The
tablets were copies of others much older, evidently in the time of Sargon 1., who was a
great Elamite king, reigning about a quarter of a century before the Assyrian empire be-
gan in 2076. The older tablets were written in the Semitic-Babylonian language. By
this fact we know that they have come from the royal city of Erech, where we find other
inscriptions showing their connection with the descendents of Shem. 'We know also
that Sargon 1., who reigned at Akkad about 400 years after the Flood, subdued Erech
and probably brought the original tablets from thence to his own city, or made copies
from them in order to enrich his great library at Akkad (called Aocad iu Gen. x. 10).
The inscriptions of Sargou are in the same language. Thirteen centuries later these
same tablets appear to have been in the library of Assur-bani-pal 11., who had transla-
tions made from them, as is seen by the fact that each tablet written by the scribes of
Assur-bani-pal 11., have a “colophon,” at foot, stating that it is a copy of an original
document. It is also stated i i some places that the original is defective. The tablets of
Assur-bani-pal are now in the British Museum, those which were shown to me are much
broken in some places, and often defective in others, so that in translating them into
English, blanks are left. I give the translations. The figures refer to the lines.
The story shows by the introduction that some monarch, whom the late Mr. G. Smith
has called Izdubar, because the phonetic name cannot be understood), fell sick, and on
recovery went to see a patriarch named Sisit—the Xisthnrus of the Greeks, who was
saved by a ship during the deluge—who was supposed to have attained immortality.
This might be owing to the great age he had already lived. The purport of the visit of
Izdubar was to ascertain how Sisit became immortal, and to learn if he also could be-
come immortal, Sisit, in replying to questions, said
19. He spoke to me thus
21. make a great ship lor thee
22. I will destroy the sinners and life
23. Cause to go in the seed of life, all of it
to preserve them.
24. The ship which thou shalt make,
25. cubits shall be the length measure.
26 cubits its bread'b and height.
27. Into the deep launch it.
Hero 15 lines or more are lost.
79. I collected of the seed of life.
80.1 caused to go up into the ship, all my
male and female servants,
81. the beasts of the field, and the sons of
the family, 1 caused to go up.
82. A flood Shamas made, and
83. he spake, saying in the night, “I will
cause it to rain from heaven heavily;
84. enter the ship and shut thy door.”
85. A Flood he raised,
86. He spake, in the night
87. In the day I held hi s festival [Sabbath]
88. the day which he had appointed,
89.1 entered the ship and shut my door.
90. To guide the ship Buzur.-adir-abi, a pilot,
91. the palace I gave to his band,
92. The raging of a storm in the morning
93. arose, from the horizon extending.
94. Vul in the midst of it thundered.
101. The Flood reached to heaven.
102. The bright earth to a waste was turned,
103. the surface like it swept,
104. It destroyed all life on face of earth,
105. The tempest reached to heaven.
106. Brother saw not his brother, it did not
spare the people. In heaven
107. the gods feared the tempest and
103. sought refuge; they ascended to the
heaven of Ana.
Then follows more about the gods
in fear, and a speech by the great
goddess Ishtar, “ The world to sin
has turned.” The gods concerning
the spirits wept with her.
121. Six days and nights passed.
122. On the seventh day the storm calmed,
125. The sea he caused to dry.
127. The whole mankind who turned to sin
128. Like reeds their corpses floated,
129.1 opened the window and the light
broke in, over my refuge
130. it passed. I sat still and
131. Over my refuge came peace.
132. I was carried over the shore on the sea.
133. For 12 measures it rose over the land.
134. To the country of Nizir went the ship.
135. The mountain Nizir stopped the ship,
and to pass over it was no able,
138. For 6 days mountain Nizer tha same.
139. On the 7th day, in the course of it
140.1 sent forth a dove. It went, searched.
hut a resting place did not And.
141. It returned. I sent forth a swallow.
142. It left, a resting place it did not And,
It returned.
143.1 sent forth a raven. It left. Corpses
on the water it saw and did eat.
145. It wandered away and did not return.


147. I sent the animals forth to the four
winds. I poured out a libation.
14S. I built an altar on the mountain peak.
151. The gods collected.
152. Like birds over the sacrifice gathered.
153. From of old the great God in his course,
154. great brightness of Ann had created.
154. When the glory of these gods, as of
Ukni stone, on my countenance
155. I could not endure. I prayed that
150. for ever I might not endure it.
157. May the gods come to my altar,
158. May Bel not come to my altar,
159. For not considering, he made tempest
109. and my people consigned to the deep
101. in justice; also Bel in his course
102. saw the ship, and Bel went with anger
to the gods and spirits, saying:
103. “ Let not any come out alive; let not
a man be saved from the deep.”
164. Ninip said to the warrior Bel,
105. “Who then will he saved?”
137. Hea said to the warrior [Justice] Bel:
108. “Thou prince of the gods, warrior,
109. when angry a tempos c thou modest.
170. The doer of sin did his sin, the doer
of evil did his evil.
171. May the exalted not be broken, may
the captive not be delivered.
172. Instead of thee making a tempest, may
lions increase and men he reduced.
173. Instead of making a tempest, may leo-
pards increase and men be reduced.
174. Instead of tempest may famine happen
and the country be destroyed.
175. Instead of thee making a tempest may
pestilence rise and men be reduced.”
170. I did not peer into the wisdom of gods.
177. Reverent and attentive, a dream they
sent and wisdom of the gods I heard.
178. When his judgment was accomplished
Bel went up to the midst of the ship.
179. He took my hand and brought me out.
ISO. He caused my wife to bo brought out.
181. He purified the country. He establish-
a covenant and took the people.
The tablets then go on to say that Sisit
after this went to dwell in a remote place,
at the month of the rivers, and Izdubar is
informed that the life he seeks after he
shall gain. A scarlet cloth is to be placed
on bis head, such as Sisit had on his head
when he entered the ship. By the request
of the wife of Sisit, Izdubar is purified.
As we find records of Izdubar hunting and
wrestling with lions, he must be Nimrod.
The general facts of the cuneiform records, which seem to haye been written from
tradition, agree with those of Scripture, such as the cause of the deluge being a punish-
ment for the wickedness of the world, the universality of the Flood by the great height
of the waters and particularly by taking birds into the huge “palace,” collecting the
beasts of the field, sending out a dove and afterwards a raven, the oJlcring up of a sac-
rifice on leaving the ark and a covenant made by the Deity. The statement about
taking male and female servants into the ark .is considered by some men as reasonable,
in order to assist in attending to the animals. It is also regarded as aiding our ideas of
population, 100 years afterwards, when the confusion of tongues occurred. The absence
ol dates is a marked feature; but they would be lost by tradition. The records of Scrip-
ture are evidently from the diary of Noah when in the ark, and preserved in patriarchal
families The diary gives 10 dates, expressed or implied. They are all correct on the
solar cycle, both the days of the week and the dates of the months being seventh, or
Sabbath days, of the year ICSG, which Genesis v. supplies as the year of the Flood. I
know of no other records in the world which are so precise and astronomical as those of
the deluge, The seventh days are in unbroken succession from the first Sabbath in
Creation year, which begins the solar cycle. It is scientific aud imperishable history.
CUNEIFORM RECORDS OF CREATION.
The cuneiform records of Creation, found beneath the mounds and ruins of Nineveh,
by the late Mr. George Smith, the cost of whose explorations wt-re defrayed by the pro-
prietors of the London “ Daily Telegraph,” are of similar character to those of the
Deluge and are Copies of older tablets from Babylonia. They consist of a series from
Creation to some period after the fall of man. Linked with them he also found others
detailing the building of the Tower of Babel, the confusion of tongues, and Dispersion.
Ilis good fortune was further increased by discovering a tablet about the fallen angels
and the origin of evil. They seem to have originally been written about 300 years after
the Flood. The narrative of the period of Creation begins with a description of chaos
when monsters existed, presided over by a goddess. Creation was by stages, the gods
surveying the woik as it proceeded. The Divine work culminated in the creation of
man, who was made uptight, free from evil, and endowed with speech. These aneient
records from Babylonia, the source of early human society, are valuable to us. They
show us what was commonly believed. Man was created, not evolved, and he was en-
dowed with speech when he was formed. (See Smith’s ‘‘Chaldean Records of Creation.”!

KINGS OF EGYPT.

Compiled according to the latest monumental history of Egypt, and compared with
Biblical and Assyrian records.
Statements about the existence of Egyptian Dynasties before the dispersion in 1770,
a.m., made by men who shut their eyes against all astronomical phenomena, by which
lime is produced and measured, still remain without proof, whilst the evidence for
disprovingTsuch statements is continually increasing.


BIRD’S EYE VIEW OF EGYPTIAN DYNASTIES, upon an Astronomical Scale.
The year for the commencement of Dynsties is a.m. and sometimes approximate. The
figures in the Eclipse column are centuries. Indebtedness for the subjoined arrangement
of Dynasties is acknowledged to Brugsch, Bunsen, Wilkinson, Poole, and Rawlinson. The
cycle of the total lunar eclipse No. 8 9 (repeating its date), is 649 solar years.


EGYPTIAN HISTORY .
THE PHARAOHS OF SCRIPTURE, ETC.
This ancient name of Egypt was Mizraim.
(See Genesis x. 6 and 13, 1. 2; and 1 Chro-
nicles i. 8.) This Mizraim was one of the
sons of Ham, who at the dispersion occu-
pied North Africa. The Assyrians called
it Musr, and the Persians named it Mud-
raya. It was the Greeks who first called
it Egypt Mizraim is thought to be the
Hebrew plural of Mizr.
Great care has to be taken in drawing up
a line of consecutive history of Egypt as
the Egyptians omitted to distinguish the
sole, reign of a monarch from his joint reign
with others. A monarch might occupy the
throne 10 years in conjunction with his
father, 32 years alone, and 3 years with his
son. In an Egyptian royal list, this is the
case with Usertesen 1., yet he is credited
with 45 years.
Manetho, the priest of Heliopolis, who
drew up the Egyptian dynasties three cen-
turies 8.C., did not mark whether they were
contemporaneous or consecutive. Joint
reigns were also counted by him as if they
were successive, and we find him frequently
contradicted by monumental history. It is
also evident that there does not seem to
have been population sufficient to form
great nations before the 18th dynasty.
Brugsch says five of the early dynasties
were collateral, Bunsen says seven, and
Wilkinson an' 1 Stuart Poole twelve.
We find no monumental history of Egypt
prior to the dispersion, and the orientation
of the great pyramid shows that according
to the precession of the equinoxes, the
slant passage of the pyramid pointed to the
star a in the constellation Dragonis as the
pole star in the year 2000 A.H., which was
1996 B.c. This, therefore, must have been
about the time in which the pyramids were
built, about two centuries after the disper-
sion.
The best way to understand the first seven-
teen dynasties is to compare them with the
period of other ancient histories. Assyrian
history gives us nothing approximating to
nationality before 2304, and if we turn to
the fuller records of Biblical history, we
read of every little city having a king. The
reason of which is that after the flood go-
vernment would of necessity exist in cities
before population was large enough to form
nations. . It is fair, however, to expect that
Egypt, as a fertile country, independent of
rain, would draw men from Asia, and thus
obtain the means of constituting larger go-
vernments, and indeed building pyramids
of massive but plain proportions. Hut
the larger governments would not likely
extend beyond 200 miles, and thus in a
well-watered region, and its neighbour-
hood, there was proper room lor half-a-
dozen kings to reign contemporaneously.
When we come down to 2235, (18th dy-
nasty), things evidently took a wider shape.
According to Bunsen, the kingdom of
Menes was divided, one branch reigning in
Upper and the other in Lower Egypt. Each
came to an end about the same time and the
kingdom was re-united.
Manetho, the priest of Heliopolis, who
drew up the dynasties of Egypt, says that
the country was previously ruled by gods,
which was probably a mythological allusion
to the long lives of the patriarchs.
The dispersion was about 1766 a.m.

The first dynasty of Manetho ac-
cording to the Arminian version of
Eusebius, is very straightforward
It was all father and son, like that
of the Biblical patriarchs.
As this dynasty reaches the 12th,
of which there is monumental and
Scriptural history, it proves that
the intervening weie not in the im-
perial line, but branching, (see
Bird’s Eye View of Dynasties), and
accords with the statements of Bru-
gsch, Bunsen, Wilkinson, and Stuart
Poole, that there were several dynas-
ties existing at one time.


For DYNASTIES 11., 111., IV., V., VI.,
VII;, VIII., IX., X. and XI., see Bird’s
Eye View of Dynasties.
Rawlinson says that the 4th and sth
were certainly consecutive, and probably
the 6th followed the sth. The 7th, Bth,
9th, and 1 0th were collateral. Manetho
did not git e their names. The 14th is as
unknown as the 7th, Bth, 9th, and 10th.
Monuments confirm only six out of the first
fourteen dynasties.
THE PHARAOHS OF SOP.IPTURE.
Considerable excitement has arisen amongst
historians and Biblical students by the dis-
covery of the embalmed body of Eamses 11.,
the Pharaoli of Egypt in the time of Moses,
which was found with almost a score of other
embalmed kings and notables of ancient
Egypt, at Dayr-el-Bahiri, in a quarry on
the 10th July, 1881. The discovery can
only be equalled by that of the reading of
the cuneiform account of the Deluge by the
late Mr. George Smith, which led to many
very important results.
By the assistance of monumental history
recently obtained we have found not only
the name of the imperial Pharaoh of Moses,
but also those of the Exodus, the period
when Joseph was in Egypt, and the Pha-
raoh when Abraham was in that country.
The reader will obtain in the present article
the results which have been realised, which
it may be added have been secured by tabu-
lating the number of years reigned by the
respective Pharaohs of the 12th to the 19th
dynasties given by monumental records,
and controlled by the measurements of as-
tronomical lines of time. The first fact
which presents itself in connection with
the investigation is, that the Pharaoh of
Moses was one who reigned a long period,
because in Exod. ii. 15, Moses fled from the
face of Pharaoh and went to Midian, where
he remained 40 years. (Acts vii. 23, 30).
Almighty God then telling him that they
were dead who sought his life. To meet
these circumstances we have the reign of
Eamses 11., who was on the throne 68
years, having been called to reign con-
jointly with his father, Seti 1., when he
was but seven years old. Such united
reigns were customary with the Egyptians.
The next fact is, that Meneptah, the suc-
cessor of Ramses 11., was the Pharaoh of
the Exodus. He is spoken of as a man of
freat indecision of character, which per-
aps much explains his versatile dealings
with Moses concerning the Exodus. This
Exodus seems to have occurred at the close
of some wars which Meneptah had with re-
volted tribes, and lienee we may place the
departure of the Israelites in the middle of
his reign of eight years. From this point
we may begin.
Biblical history and astronomical mea-
surement give the third day of the week
(Tuesday), 15th of the 7th month (civil),
2515 a.m. for the Exodus It could be no
other date or day of the month, still less
any other year, as the natural results of the
solar cycle show. If then we take up the
line of kings of Egypt from this point—
putting the ascension of Meneptah as 2508,
we then arrive at a series of facts which
agree with Biblical history and illustrate
the Scriptural words, not only showing
that Meneptah was the Pharaoh of the Ex-
odus, and Ramses the Pharaoli of Moses,
but also that Thothmes I. was on the
throne when Joseph was sold into Egypt,
that Thothmes 11. was king when Joseph
was in prison, and that Thothmes HI. was
the Pharaoh who dreamed of the seven
years famine. and seven years of plenty.
The same tabular way of dealing with the
number of years required shows that User-
tesen 11., of the 12th dynasty, was king
when Abraham entered Egypt in the year
2804 a.m. during a severe famine of which
we have a monumental representation.
(Gen. xii. 10.) Thus one fact respecting
Ramses 11., the long reign of whom fils the
the Biblical record, enables us to reach
half-a-dozen others. We know that when
the new empire began with the 18th dynasty
that its most prominent feature was the ex-
pulsion of the Shepherds, or Hykshos, and
the union of all the kingdoms under the
sceptre of Aahmes I. also called Amosis.
The history of Joseph also fully shows that
“from one end of Egypt, even unto the
other,” that this was the political condition
of the country in his time, and in addition
to this we have definite expressions in the
Biblical records which settle the name of
the Royal dreamer. The reader will see by
the peculiar phrasiology of Genesis xli. 13,
that the Pharaoh to whom the butler was
speaking could not be the king who hanged
the baker. Addressing Pharaoh the buuer
says : “ Me he restored unto mine office, and
him he hanged.” This plainly shows that
these acts were those of the preceding king.
Secondly, when the reigns of the kings of
Egypt are tabulated from the Hebrew exo-
dus in 2513 —a date which for its astron-
omical importance no man can alter, and one
which Usher and all Biblical scholars agree
to hold—we find that Thothmes 111. was
the Pharaoh when Joseph was promoted.
He ascended the throne in 2289 and reigned
54 years. This is a long period and proves
that he could not have been the Pharaoh
referred to by the butler, as reigning when
Joseph was in prison.


Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and
blessed he seems to have been, not only
with a long reign, which was not the case
with his two predecessors or two successors,
but we are told by monumental history that
his reign was one of the most glorious
of Egyptian monarchs. Investigation shows
that Thothmes L, who reigned 10 years,
ascended in 2273, and Biblical history indi-
cates that Joseph was sold into Egypt in
2276, when he was 17 years old. Thothmes
IL would therefore become king in 2283.
As he reigned but 6 years, the surrounding
circumstances show that he was the mon-
arch who hanged the baker and restored
the butler. In his reign Joseph was in
prison, and thus when in 2289 the throne
became that of Thothmes lIL, the peculiar
words already referred to could be used by
the butler, who spoke to the king of another
Pharaoh who was designated by the third
personal pronoun “ he,” instead of thou.
In the next place it is evident from the
date of the dream, “ after two full years,”
(Gen. xli. 1.) that is a full lunar and full
solar year, or, more definitely the particu-
lar period when both years were full, that
the year was 2289. This chronological ex-
pression is found in other parts of scripture,
but never means 24 months. It refers to
the intercalary period and is used by St.
Luke (Acts xxiv, 27.) as the period of St.
Paul’s embarkation, but has erroneously
been translated as though the apostle was
kept two years in prison—a palpable con-
tradiction of his high calling.
There is yet another incident of import-
ance in connection with this interesting co-
incidence of Egyptian and Biblical history.
When Jacob was introduced by Joseph to
Pharaoh, the king said to him, “ How old
art thou ?’’ which are just such words as a
comparatively young sovereign would use,
who reigned 44 years after this interview.
To see the full force of all the evidence
of Thothmes 111. being the Pharaoh who
dreamed of the famine, we must remember
that he belonged to the glorious 18th dyn-
asty with which the new empire began,
the leading feature of which was, the Shep-
herd invaders had been expelled by its first
monarch Aahmes, known as Amosis I. Ho
captured their city, and the war with the
invaders, began by the last kings of the
17th dynasty, was concluded by him. All
the contemporary dynasties were ended by
Aahmes, for by marrying an Ethiopian
lady, he united all Egypt under one sceptre,
These were events which induced Manetho,
the historian, to begin his second volume
with the 18th dynasty, and it is evident by
the reading of the history of Joseph that
all Egypt was subject to one Pharaoh in
his time. He “bought all the land of
Egypt,’’ and “ as for the people, he removed
them to cities, from one end of the borders
of Egypt, even to the other end thereof.”
(Gen. xlvii. 20, 21). There was no Shep-
herd dynasty in his time, a fact which we
again see by his father and brethren having
to dwell apart from the Egyptians to whom
shepherds were an abomination.
But to make all these interesting discov-
eries plain, the following are extracts from
the tables of the reigns and dynasties com-
piled by the British Chronological Associa-
tion. The number of years reigned is from
monumental history, and the year of the
world is that consecutively obtained by the
Association.

Of the reign of this King we have a
monumental representation of the ar-
rival of 37 persons in Egypt, of the
Semitic race, during a famine. Their
visages and dress show them to bo
Hebrews, and probably Abraham and
his brother Lot with their “ men ser-
vants,” (Gen. xii. 10, 16) According
to Biblical history, Abraham “ went
down into Egypt’’ in 2083-4, thus in-
dicating that he visited Upper Egypt

reigned.

DYNASTIES XIII, XIV. XV, XVI,
and XVII.
Professor Rawlinson says the 13th, 14th,
15th and 16th are supposed to have reigned
contemporaneously in four places, the 13th
at Thebis, holding possession of middle and
upper Egypt, the I4that Xois in the centre
of the Delta, and the 15th and 16th, which
were Shepherds, in some portion of the
eastern districts, (See Bird’s Eye View of
Dynasties). To this may be added that the
17th was partly Shepherds and Theban,
reigning side by side, as Manetho admits.
But there appears about 75 years to be duo
to the 13th. Manetho’s list (Kenrick) puts
13th as 60 kings during 453 years, and 14th
as 76 kings for 184 years, evidently mean-
in consecutive tolals of all dynasties from
the beginning by Menes, In a similar
way he gives us 70 unnamed monarchs for
the Bth dynasty which did not last twelve
months. His method is often confusing.

EGYPTIAN HISTORY.


DYNASTY XVIII.
A.M. New Empire.
2235 Aahmes, also called Amosis 1., as-
cended in 1761, 8.C., and reigned 25
years. He completed the overthrow
of the Shepherds, and by marrying
an Ethiopian Queen, Nefertari, who
was of black but good features, he
united all Egypt under one sceptre.
2260 Amenhotep I, ascended and reigned 13
years conjointly with Nefertari, his
mother. Was also called Ser-ka-ra.
2273 Thothmes I. ascended, reigned 10 yrs.
2276, in this year Joseph was sold into
10 Egypt when 17 years old, 1720 8.0.

2289 2289 Thothmes 111. ascends, reigns 54
years. In his Ist he dreamed of
the famine, and raised Joseph to
dignity (Gen. xli. 46.)*
In these reigns, obtained from monumental
history, we have a splendid verification of the
true years, both of Biblical and Egyptian
events. The facts oT Dth fit admirably. Ac-
cording to the dream Pharaoh was to see both
the seven years of plenty and the famine, but
Thothmes 11. could not, as he reigned only 6
years. But he must have been the Pharaoh
spoken of as "he” by the butler when ad-
dressing Thothmes 111., who had no suc-
cessor until 64 years afterwards. As to the
Biblical years, it must not be forgotten that
they are proved by the solar cycle and are
astronomical, either in succession from the
Flood dates, or reversed from the Exodus.
2342 Amenhotep 11. ascends 1654 8.C., and
reigns 7 years,
2350 Thothmes IV. ascends; reigns 8 years.
2358 Amenhotep 111. ascended and reigned
36 years. During his reign a her-
esy arose ; probably after the death
of Joseph in 2369, soon after which
the sun was worshipped.

Egyptian history 2513
* The year 2289, at the beginning of which Thothmes 111. ascended, is also obtained
by noticing that the Exodus of the Israelites, after the sojourn of 430 years commencing
with Abraham, took place on Tuesday, the 15th of the 7th civil (or Ist sacred) month,
in 2513 ; and when Jacob entered Egypt, half of the 430 years was ended, viz., 215 years.
The sojourn began on “ the selfsame day” (See Ex. xii. 41, 51) that is on the same day
of the week and date of the month when Abraham left the city of Dr. As Moses, who
was a good chronologist, tells us the exodus was at “ the end of the 430 years,” it re-
quires the middle of 2082 to the middle of 2513, to cover 430 complete years, otherwise,
in common computation, 2082 and 340 would only be 2512. On looking at the Ancient
Hebrew Solar Cycle, for 2082, which was table a, it will be seen that the days of the
week had the same dates of the month as those of the year 2513, table I, thus producing
“ the selfsame day” which Moses so emphatically speaks of.

DYNASTY XX.
Monumental history is incomplete respecting
this dynasty. It lasted about 283 years and was
contemporary with the Judges of Hebrew history.
The reigns average 22 years.

Ancient Hebrew Solar Cycle, a splendid astronom-
ical line of time, show that the 20th and 21st dyn-

B.c. Thothmes 111., whose reign it speaks
of, ascended in 2289, a.m., which was 1707,
B.c. Such an error would not have been
made if the proper chronological methods
had been considered.

EGYPTIAN HISTORY.


Note A., Dynasty xvii.
All the difnculties of readers of Egyptian
history arise from the want of a knowledge
of the contemporary dynasties, the period
wr.an each be.,an, and the fact that the 18th
was the commencement of the new empire
in 2235 by uniting all Egypt under one
monarch. Down to the end of the 17th
dynasty several of them ran side by side,
»nd when we compare the histories of other
countries with the same periods, we see that
before population was large enough to be
united into nations, every city had a king.
All Chaldman history indicates this, as seen
by the scripture records several centuries
after Abraham. Head Joshua x. and notice
Judges i. 7.
Note 8., Dynasty xix.
By a monumental inscription, we find
that the first Shepherd dynasty began 400
years before some year of the reign of Bain-
eses 11. It is a great pity that the year of
the reign was not added, but it was proba-
bly Rameses’s 43rd, because it is not un-
likely that it was the great famine mention-
in Gen. xii. 10, as occurring in 2083, which
drove them into a laud independent of rain
and which, owing to its great population,
was, in some parts, well cultivated. The
Shepherds maintained their position for 152
years, viz., from 2083 to 2235, and this Mr.
George W. Smith, of the British Chrono-
logical Association, has pointed out as fully
agreeing with other incidents. It was in
2235 that the sword of Aahmes completed
the subjection of the Shepherd dynasty,
and the new empire began by all Egypt
being brought under one sceptre.
Note C., Dynasty xix.
We see again how monumental history
of Egypt agrees with Hebrew history by a
Pharaoh being 35 years on the throne after
Moses fled. This is a confirmation of two
Biblical statements : “ And it came to pass
in process of time the king of Egypt died,”
This decease is spoken of in reference to the
Pharaoh from whom Moses fled, aud after
Moses had been 40 years in Midian (Exodus
ii. 15 and 28) ; ‘‘The Lord said to Moses,
go return into Egypt, for all the men are
dead which sought thy life,” (Exod. iv. 19).
It is plain that both passages refer to one
king and that he reigned many years. When
we take this into consideration, and notice
that Raineses 11. was the predecessor of Men-
eptah, the exodus Pharaoh, we have the
chronology all settled by the exodus year
in scripture and verified by the solar cycle,
viz. 2513. We cannot alter the date of the
exodus year without greatly reducing the
length of the day and the periods of the
eelipses. Indeed no man would alter the
dates and years of the Bible if he under-
stood that all Biblical years having been
lunar and formed of weeks of seven days,
they were more astronomical than our own
and beyond the power of human alteration.
Note D., Dynasty xix.
As the exodus of the Israelites took place
in the reign of Meneptah, it is absolutely
certain that we can fix the true period of
his short reign of eight years. Allusion has
already been made to this in connection
with the ascension of Thotbmes 111., and
the year of the ascension of every Egyptian
king, corroborated by Assyrian aud Hebrew
history, requires the same period. To alter
the date of the exodus, Tuesday, 15th of the
7thcivil month, would not only deny all
the statements of Biblical history and the
record of Egyptian aud Assyrian monu-
ments, but also disarrange the solar system.
Note E.. Dynasty xxi.
We get the yeais reigned by Pintom 111.
from 1 Kings xi. 14-22. Hadad left Egypt
when he heard of David’s death in 2989.
The Pharaoh who treated him kindly would
not be the Pharaoh whose daughter Solo-
mon married (See ix. 16) in 2990, but Men-
kheper-ra, who from this record reigned, at
least 25 years. His son, Pintom 111. would
be the father of Solomon’s wife, and must
have reigned from 2992 to 3028—36 years—
because Shishak was king of Egypt in 3029.
See 1 Kings xi. 40- Mcn-khcper-ra seems
to have died soon after David.
Important Concluding Note.
Wherever there is an Egyptian event, or
the name of a Pharaoh, mentioned in the
Bible, the year A. M. can be found, first, be-
cause scripture history abounds with dates
of the month which with a solar cycle built
up, like our own, of weeks cf seven days,
supplies the year ; secondly, because all the
monumental history of Assyria, now very
extensive, confirms Hebrew history. As il-
lustrations of these advantages, 2 Kings xix.
contains the names of an Egyptian, Hebrew,
aud Assyrian King,, as contemporaries. It
is easy, therefore, to fix the period of the
Egpptian monarch. Again the Exodus was
on Tuesday', loth of 7th civil (Ist sacred)
month, and a glance at the solar cycle shows
that the date of the month fell on that Jay
of the week in 2513 a.m., the very year ob-
tained by other methods, and also the only
year which at “the end of the 430 years,”
produces “ the selfsame day” of the week
and date of the month. See 2052, and 2513,
tables a and I, of the Ancient Hebrew Solar
Cycle. As the Exodus took place in the
short reign ofMeneptah, itis not difficult to
determine the period when he reigned.
APPENDIX TO EGYPTIAN HISTORY.


WHEN WAS THE GREAT PYRAMID BUILT?
The best way for finding when the great Pyramid, at Gizeh, was built, is by the pre-
cession of the equinoxes. The pyramid is so built that its four sides face the four
quarters of the heavens—east, west, north and south—and the entrance is by a pas-
sage in the centre of the northern side, which first slants downwards and then upwards
to a chamber in the centre of the building. It would thus occur, that a person stand-
ing at the bottom of the slanting passage would look straight outwards to any star
situated on or near the north-pole of the heavens. Such a star would have no motion.
But all the other stars would wheel round it in circles, the diameter of which would be
according to their distance. At the present time, with ns, Polaris is situated close
to the northern point of the heavens, which is the result of the axis of the earth always
pointing to the north. This pole-star therefore is always seen in one place, like a nail
driven into the sky. But this northern point in the heavens has a slow motion per-
forming a circle. It is caused by what is known to astronomers as the precession of the
equinoxes, and was first noticed by a chart, or map, which Hipparcus made of all the
stars 120 years before Christ was born. By this chart, and others, compared with what
we now see, we get the amount of motion made by the precession of the equinoxes in a
century. It is 1 degree and 23 minutes, which involves a revolution in 23,773 years.
A degree is a line a little more than the diameter of the sun as we see him with the
naked eye. By this slow motion, we find that the star Draco, in the constellation of
the Dragon, was situated on the north-pole when the great pyramid was built. It
would be in the centre of the slanting passage in 1820 to 2170, a.m„ say 1069; allow 20
years for building, we have 1989, which was 333 years after the Blood. This agrees
with history for the dispersion, or confusion of tongues, was about 1770. It also agrees
with Cheops, who built the pyramid, being the 2nd king of the fourth dynasty, which
began about 1940. There were several dynasties existing at that time, just as we find
six kings reigning in six royal cities in Babylonia and near it, at the same period.
AN IMPORTANT POINT OF HISTORY—SIX KINGDOMS IN ASIA,
AND SIX IN EGYPT WERE CONTEMPORARY.
With such an example before us, as the almost simultaneous rise of six kingdoms
in the several royal cities of Babylon, Ur, Erech, Larsa, Karrak and Akkad, in Asia, it
is surprising that some writers err in regarding the first six kingdoms in Egypt as con-
secutive. There is nothing in history to warrant the conclusion that the early dynas-
ties of Egyptian kings were not existing together, and during the same period as those
in Asia. On the contrary, what testimony we have supports this view, whilst analogy
points to the conclusion that what existed in one country would, in the first centuries
following the Flood, take place in another. Writers ought to bear in mind that their
readers are intelligent and that the date of the Flood is clearly proved by astronomy.
HISTORY BUILT UP—JOSEPH, AMENHOTEP IV., OF EGYPT; KALAMA-SIN
OF BABYLON. AND JOSHUA OF ISRAEL.
In 1887, a poor Arab woman, looking for nitrate, found in the ruins of Tel-el-Amarna
several curious clay tablets covered with cuneiform characters. This led to a search, and
the result was 300 tablets were unearthed, some of which have been purchased for the
British Museum, whilst others have gone to Berlin. Investigation shows that they are
letters or despatches received by Amcnhotep 111 (Amenophis), the Bth Pharaoh of the
18th dynasty, who it will be seen by the list of kings, ended his reign of 36 years in 2393.
Fortunately one of these letters was from Kalama-Sin who became king of Babylon in
the same year. The two were therefore contemporaries. See Babylonian Kings. Egypt
had prospered during the time of Joseph, who died in the 12th year of Amenhotep lIL,
viz. in 2369, and the letter of Kalama-Sin asks that 3,000 talent? of gold might be sent
to him. Another despatch is from Abdi-tabu, of Jerusalem, before the Israelites had
conquered Palestine. It was addressed to Amenhotep iv., son of the previous Pharaoh,
who began to reign in 2963-4, stating that Egypt was beginning to lose her hold on
Palestine. The Canaanites and Hittites, it seems, were gaining strength by the gradual
formation of a powerful confederation of tribes which 150 years later (2553) formed the
foes of conquering Israel (Joshua xi. 3- and xii. 8). The cities of Debir and Lachish,
mentioned in the despatch, are those subsequently taken by Joshua (x. 3). We also find
that Amenhotep iy. by listening to his beautiful Asiatic wife, gave great offence to the
Egyptian priests bv introducing the worship of the solar disk, so that he was obliged to
leave the city; but he enlarged another, which ho called Knu-en-aten, and by which
this heretic Pharaoh was also known. Few discoveries are equal to these, because they
confirm the period in which Amenhotep iii. and iv. were on the throne (published in
“ All Past Time’ 1 10 years previously), and the change from the religion of Joseph.


HISTORY BUILT UP—EGYPTIAN DYNASTY XVIII. CONTINUED.
This interesting period of history is further fixed by the fact that Amenhotep 11. con-
quered Nineveh, and that his successors were lords of Syria and Palestine. The list of
“Kings of Assyria” show? that Samsi-Vul began to reign in Nineveh in 2349, which
was the last year of Amenhotep 11. by whom he was probably placed on the throne: but
owing to the subsequent decline of the power of Egypt, as stated by the tablets from
Tel-Amarna, the Assyrian king, Bel-kaphapu, began his reign in 2393 by establishing
an “ independent kingdom,” which would mean free from tribute to Egypt. This
might arise through the death of Amenhotep in the same year. Thus :
2342 Amenhotep 11., who reigned 7 years, conquered Nineveh.
2349 Thothmes IV. followed, reigning 8 years, beginning with Samsi-Vul, of Assyria.
2357 Amenhotep 111. in Egypt, 36 years—Contemporaries, Samsi Vul 11. and Tritak.
2393 Kalama-Sin, asks him for 3,000 talents of gold. See “Kings of Babylon.”
2393 Amenhotep 111. died. See “Kings of Egypt.”
2393 Amenhotep IV. began in Egypt, and is also known as Kheu-en-aten.
2393 Bel-kaphapu establishes an independent kingdom. See “Kings of Assyria.”
To this it may be added that if it be correct that Ismi-Dagon is the same person as
the king of Karrak (See Karrak) where some of the early kings of Assyria reigned, the
new Hue began with Samsi-Vul I. We may also remark that applications to Amenho-
tep 111. for gold by Kalama-Sin, of Babylon, Tushratta, king of Northern Mesopotamia,
and others, was owing to the fact that the kings of Egypt had, by their conquest of
Nubia at this period, obtained possession of the gold mines of that country.
All these incidents are of great interest and show me that we can, by monumental
inscriptions, fix the period when the last four Pharaohs of the 18th dynasty reigned.
This evidence is important because the names of the Pharaohs are not given in those
parts of Scripture referring to Abraham, Joseph, and Moses, or to the periods of the
oppression and exodus of the Israelites from Egypt. They are also important because
although the exodus in the year 2313| is well established by Biblical scholars, and was
confirmed by astronomical measurements, published in “All Past Time,” 1884, yet Mr.
Flinders Petrie, in his letter to me in Oct. 1892, insisted that Amenhotep IV. began to
reign in 2604, a.m. Miss Amelia Edwards also wrote to me and published a series of
letters in “Knowledge” stating that the Exodus was a century later than 2513, whilst
a third writer asserted that it was 2400. I mention these things to show that all our
discoveries confirm Scripture history. It is all planetary motion from the beginning,
so that it is never safe to depart from it.
THE SUBJUGATION OP PALESTINE BY JOSHUA.
Some of the Tel-Amarna records belong to a period 40 years after the exodus, viz.,
2553, when Joshua subdued Canaan. They are hasty despatches to the Pharaoh of
Egypt as the Lord Protector of Canaan, stating that the land is besieged by the ’Abiri
(Hebiri, sounded with a soft a, and meaning Heorews), and that the rulers fear the end
Behold, I say, that the laud of the king, my lord, is ruiued, as the ’Abiri chief is plun-
dering the entire country.
Another despatch states that some of the people are going over to the Hebrews, who
are making rapid conquests, owing to the Egyptian garrisons having been withdrawn.
This might be a result of the loss of the army in the Bed Sea. The despatch seems to
allude to the Gibeonites (Joshua ix. 3—15), who made peace with Joshua by dressing
themselves in old clothes and thus pretending that they had come from a far country.
The tablets contain the names of Japbia, king of Gezer, (In Joshua x. 3, he is king of
Lachisb, but he may have had authority over both cities). Japin, is mentioned as king
of Hazor, which is the some as Joshua xi. 1. The name of the king of Jerusalem is
doubtful. Major Conder thinks it is Adoni-zedec (Joshua x. 3),

REIGNS OF THE KINGS OF JUDAH.


Historical Table Y. continued,
a.m. Eeign Recorded
3030 Jeroboam, 1 Kings xiv. 20. Came from Egypt and events delayed the
establishment of his throne. The kings of Israel, it will be seen, had no
214 scruples about Sabbatic years, and the kingdom was brief and unhappy. 22
3051 J Nadab, 1 Kings, xv. 5, began early in 2nd of Asa of Judah, 3051, and was
l| assassinated in the 3rd, his reign was in 2 years, but was little over 1. 2
30524 Baasha began in 3rd of Asa, 1 Kings xv. 33. He was an idolater and given
234 to cruelties and abominations 24
3070 Klah began in the 2Gth of Asa, 1 Kings, xvi. 8, and was murdered whilst he
14 was drunk, by Zimri, captain of chariots. All his house were slain. ... 2
30774 Zimri, the assassin, only reigned 7 days, 1 Kings xvi. 15, when in his dis-
tress he set fire to the palace and perished amidst the flames.
4 Civil War for about 4 years followed—Omri and Tibni struggling to be king.
30814 Omri began to reign in the 31st of Asa, 1 Kings xvi. 23. The “12 years ”
5J are from rise of the turmoil (death of Basha) in 26th of Asa, to his 38th 6
Ahab, began in 38th of Asa, and Jehosbaphat began in 4th of Ahab, 1 Kings
214 xvi. 29 and xxii. 41. These records have to agree with time of reign. 22
31074 Ahaziab (not the king of Judah of same name) began in 17th of Jehosbaphat
half of which was 3107,1 Kings xxii. 51. He died in 3109, or just after. 2
4 He reigned with his father Ahab, who died a few mouths before him.
31084 Joram, son of Ahab, began in 18th of Jehosbaphat, and died same year as
114 Ahaziah of Judah, 3120. 2 Kings hi. 1. and ix. 23 —25, 12
31204 Jehu, 2 Kings ix. 6 and x. 36. God’s avenger of the wickedness of the
284 house of Ahab. His reign was on 29 years 29
31484 Jehoahaz began in the 23rd of Joash of Judah. 2 Kings xiii. 1. His sou
164 perhaps reigned in consort a short time 17
31644 Jehoash began to reign with his father in 37th of Joash of Judah, 3162),
164 2Kingsxiii.lO. Amaziah lived nearly 15 years after him, 2Ch. xxv.23 16
31814 Jeroboam 11, began to reign alone in the 15th of Amaziah, 2 Kings xv. 23,
he having been a partner with his father in 31684, and had reigned 27
years (which was his 16th alone) in 31954, the year when Gzziah,
414 who is also called Azariah, began. See 2 Kings xv. i. and margin ... 11
32224 Interregnum of 11 years followed, according to the next reign, but it is not
11 mentioned. It was some period of restlessness
32334 Zachariah began at the end of last half of 38th of Uzziah, 2 Kings xv. 8, and
4 reigned six months. This proves an interregnum. See margin. ... 4
(T Shallum began in first half of 39th of Uzziah, 2 Kings xv. 13. He reigned in
the intercalary month, a good method of stating time—a third year.
3234 Menahem, also began in 39th of Uzziah, the last half of which was in 3234.
10 2 Kings xv. 17. He killed Shallum and stripped the temple 10
3244 Pekahiah began in 50th of Uzziah, 2 Kings xv. 23. He was assassinated
2 by one of his Generals, Pekah, who then succeeded to the throne ... 2
3246 Pekah in 52nd of Uzziah, 2 Kings xv. 27. In his 2nd year Jotham of Judah
204 began. Pekah was killed by Hoshea, who raised a conspiracy 20
32664 Conspiracy and anarchy continued, during which the kingdom was reduced
84 till the 20th year from the time when Jotham began. See xv. 30. ...
32764 Hoshea took the throne in the 12th of Ahaz, 2 Kings xvii. 1- but his reign
was disastrous- In his 9th year Sargon, of Assyria, who succeeded
84 Shalmaneser IV, during the seige of Samaria, ended the kingdom. ...
3284 The City fell at the end of the year, which was a third on the solar cycle.
0 “At the end of three years they took it.” 2 Kings xviii. 10. This
does not mean that the siege lasted three years. The time was less
than two, as it began in Hezekiah’s 4th, some time after 32824- These
periods of three years have always been a pitfall to translators through-
out the Bible, but the revisers would not listen to offers of help.
THE TEN TRIBES WERE THEN CARRIED INTO CAPTIVITY.
The unhappy kingdom lasted 255 years, up to the end of 3254. and full of wickedness
and bloodshed, scarcely any of its kings can be said to have “ slept with his fathers.”

JEWISH KINGS AND CONTEMPORARY MONARCHS.
With the reigns of Jewish Kings are mentioned monarchs of Assyria Babylonia, and
Egypt, &c., as their contemporaries, such as the following. The statements are all
correct, as will be seen. Some Assyrian monuments also have records of Jewish kings.
The years of the reigns of the kings of Assyria, Babylonia and Egypt, are taken from
the Historical Tables of the countries named.
In 2Kingsxix. there are four kings mentioned, namely, Hezekiah of Judea, Tirhakah
of Egypt, Sennacherib and Eser-Haddon of Assyria.
In arranging the chronological order of the Jewish kings, the use of the solar cycle
is indispensable, because their years are strictly astronomical. The Biblical reference
to intercalary periods at the end of every three years, is of great value. They are a
marked feature in all Scripture, but unfortunately have all been misunderstood.
AN ALLEGED “WEAK POINT” BECOMES THE STRONGEST FORT.
Much amusement has been made by incompetent men respecting the reigns of Jewish
Kings, particularly the records of the Kings of Israel. But investigation shows that
men who have no knowledge of the Science of Time are incompetent judges. The years
of Hoshea and Hezekiah, instead of being “ a mass of contradiction,” are valuable tes-
timony of accuracy. Hezekiah’s reign began in the middle of the year and Hoshea in
the first quarter. They prove and tabulate as follows :
Here we see that the 4th of Hezekiah was the 7th of Hoshea, as stated in 2 Kings
xviii 9 and that the 6th of Hezekiah was the 9th of Hoshea, (verse 10) and that this was
a third year—the 3rd of the solar cycle—“ at the end of three years they took it,” (the
city of Samaria). Shalmaneser died during the siege and was succeeded by Sargon.
ANOTHER PROOF OF THE EXODUS YEAR.
In 1 Kings vi. 1, we read that the foundation of the Temple was laid by Solomon in
his fourth year (which just then began with the sacred year, viz., 2993fc), and that it
was 480 years after the departure of the Children of Israel from Egypt. This is a plain
reference to the Solar Cycle, as the year was the 12th on the cycle. Now 120 years will
always reproduce the same year of the cycle. So will three times 120, which are 360,
and four times 120 are “ 480.” The exodus year, 2513 was a 12th year, and what the
passage means is, that the foundation of the Temple was laid on the same year of the
Solar Cycle as that in which the exodus took place.
HOW TO FIND SABBATIC YEARS ON THE CYCLE.
When but one Sabbatic, or Seventh Year, is known, all the others can be easily found
by adding or deducting 105 years. Thus, the 3rd year of Saul, 2912 and 105 are 3017.
Both these years were Sabbatic, Seventh years of the Solar Cycle are always seventh of
the astronomical line of time by Eclipses, Transits, and the Metonic Cycle by dating
Creation year as 0. When a.m. years are not used, 1 must be added. This is a simple
but splendid way of proving all past time. The month in which the eclipse occurs next
to any seventh year, will also keep the line of time for 649 years. There is now no
possibility of erroneously enumerating all past years, except by the unlearned.

PERSIAN MONAECHS OF SCRIPTURE HISTORY,
Consecutively and accurately arranged.
The B.c. year is from 3996, the true one, not from the authorised Bible year 4004, A.H
To obtain the latter, add 8. It is time to abandon the old Bible years, which were calcu-
lated on the erroneous principle that our Lord was born in 4004.
tXhe 10th and 32nd years are proved by intercalary at o. See margin authorised version.
♦Darius the Mede of Daniel ix. X. is not Darius Hystaspes mentioned by Zechariah and
Haggai. He was probably Cyaxarea 11., or Astyages, hia son.


PERSIAN MONARCHS CONTINUED.
8579 Xerxes 11. was proclaimed king, but he only reigued 45 days.
3580 Sogdiamns followed and reigned six months.
3580 Ochus I. also called Darius Nothus, reigned 19 years. He gave permission to San-
ballat, the Horonite, to build a rival Jewish temple on Mount Gerizim, about
3584, which was probably finished in 3595. Sanballat might be 63 when Ochns
Nothus was cn the throne. The rival temple was for Manasses, son-in-law to
Sanballat. who was chased out of Jerusalem by Nehemiah. See Eollin’s
Ancient History and Nehemiah xiii. 28.
8599 Arsases, or Artaxerxes Memnon, was king 43 years.
3642 Ochus 11. reigned 23 years.
3665 Arses was nearly two years on the throne.
3666 Darius Condomanus, reigned 6 years, but soon after coming to the throne, was
badly defeated by the troops of Alexander the Great who began to reign in
Greece in the same year that Darius Condomanus began in Persia. There was
another battle, in 3672, when Alexander was again victorious and his van-
quished foe, the last of his line, died.
END OP THE MEDO-PER3IAN EMPIRE.
With Darius Condomanus the colossal and brilliant Persian Empire ended after lasting
200 years; but it was marked to fall, being the second of the four empires which we
find in the Book of Daniel were to continue 1260 years—from 3376 J to 4630 J. A more
impressive record of history, or a clearer demonstration of the hand of Deity in the
rise and fall of empires, cannot engage our attention. As a prophecy it ended centuries
after the canon of Scripture was closed, so that it cannot be challenged, neither can we
doubt, with such examples before us, that its counterpart—the second 1260 years—will
not also be fulfilled with the same majestic precision in 58904.
The date of the battle which finally laid the Persian empire in ashes is ratified by a
total eclipse of the moon which shrouded the heavens in darkness. The night before
the struggle was brilliant, but the troops of Alexander became discouraged by seeing
the moon obscured. Alexander was alarmed lest his soldiers should decline to fight
after such an omen. He had in his camp an Egyptian, who had been a priest, whom
he asked to speak to his troops because they knew that the Egyptians understood the
mystic movements of the heavens. This priest, instead of explaning the phenomenon,
made the superstition of the soldiers an advantage to Alexander by stating that in fact
the moon did withdraw her light, but it was in sorrow for the Persians, whose emblem
was the moon, whilst their’s (the troops of Alexander) was that of the sun. It was,
shouted the ex-priest, because the Persians were going to be dreadfully beaten that the
moon mourned. This statement revived the spirits of the warriors.
HOW THE ECLIPSE IS FOUND.—First look for the year of the battle, 3672, or
the nearest preceding year, in the Triple Eclipse Table. It is 3659. Next turn to the
Ancient Hebrew Bird’s Eye View of Eclipses, the first line of which is always the year
printed in the Triple Eclipse Table. Line L therefore contains the eclipses of 3659,
fust mentioned. Now by giving a line to each year, we arrive, by counting them down-
wards, at Line XIV. for 3672 when the battle was fought. We find in this Line 0 the
sign of a tolal eclipse of the moon in the middle of the second mouth, about end of Oct.
History says. “The engagement was fought in the month of October.” This was at that
time, the second month, owing to the intercalary year.
Of course, the eclipse tables also find the year, when it is not known.
NOTES—In the preceding page it must be understood that as the Hebrew years were
hastened by the sacred year beginning at Easter, the 7th of Artaxerxes was partly on
3543 and 3544. The page will also elucidate Ezra iv. 67, where Cambyses is called
Ahasuerus, and Smerdis (the usurper) is called Artaxerxes. These were titles like that
of Pharaoh for Egyptian kings.
Artaxerxes of Ezra vii. and by whose command the walls of Jerusalem were rebuilt,
as stated in Neh. ii- 1, was also known as Longiraanus, owing to his long hands. It
will be noticed that Xerxes I. was husband of Esther.


THE ROMAN EMPERORS
IN THE FIRST CENTURY.
It waa not until we obtained an accurate knowledge o£ the years reigned by Roman
Emperors that we found the true year of the birth of Jesus Christ, though since then
other confirmations have been secured.
In the following table I have not used a.d. years. They were not known till 523, and
were not nationally adopted till 1431. If accuracy be wanted it is best not to use them
but adhere to the natural a.m. years, particulary as they only are subject to astronomical
and all other measurements for proof.
The first year of Imperial Home began as a colossal Empire.
3970 Caesar Augustus Octavian was the first Roman Emperor. The senate confirmed
his titles in September. Ho reigned 41 years and died Aug. 16th or 19th,
which was near the end of 4010. Jerusalem came under Roman authority
in 3970 J, and when rebuilt, after its destruction by Titus, continued under
the same power till 4636 J. The whole period during which the holy city
was tributary to Rome thus lasted 666 years.
4011 Tiberius was recognized as Emperor in September. He reigned 23 years and died
March 16th, 4034. In St. Luke iii. 23, we read that our Lord was 30 years
of age in the 15th of Tiberius, which is mentioned in the Ist verse. Add 15
to 4011 and we have 4026, and when we deduct 30 from it, we find that
Jesus Christ was born in 3996. The 15th of Tiberius was nearly the whole cf
4026, and as the ministry of our Lord was 3J years, he was crucified at the
passover 4029£, namely, on Friday, the 15tu of the 7th month (Ist sacred).
This is said by all historians to have been in the Emperor’s 18th year.
4034 J Caligula was proclaimed on the 16th of March and reigned less than 4 years, as
he died on the 24th of Jan., which is the 4th month of the natural year.
4038 J Claudius began Jan. 24tb, 4038, and died October 13th, 4052. which was the Ist
month of the a.m. or natural year. Josephus says Claudius reigned 13 years
Bmo ths and 20 days. He is twice mentioned in the Book of Acts, namely,
xi. 28, his Ist year, and xviii, 2, stating that ho had commanded all Jews to
depart from Rome. He died shortly afterwards, and it is evident by the
Book of Acts that the expulsion—which is also mentioned by Suetonis, who
lived 50 years afterwards—was in 4051. Suetonis intimates that the expul-
sion was owing to tumults raised by Jews against Christians.
4052 Nero succeeded Oct. 13th, the beginning of the year, and reigned 13J years. He
was in Greece on a singing tour when St. Paul arrived in Rome in 40591,
and did not return, till much more than a year. In 4061 J St. Paul completed
two years residence waiting for Nero's opportunity, but was burnt out by
the great fire which consumed two-thirds of the city, in July, 4061 f. Nero
beheaded St. Paul on June 29th, 40G3J, and committed suicide, June 11, 4065.
40G5i Galba began as Emperor on June 11th, and reigned rather better than 7 months.
He was murdered during a conspiracy raised by Otho on Jon.' 4th, 4066.
4066 i Otho was proclaimed by the Guards, Jan. sth, and reigned three mouths and five
days. He died by his own hand after his troops were defeated by his rival.
406G£ Vitellius chosen by the army on the Rhine, defeated Otho and entered Roma as
Emperor in April. He was murdered, Dec. 3rd. Reigned 8 months, 5 days.
4067 J Vespasian was chosen by the army sent into Palestine, but was tardy in going up
to Rome, after learning the fate of his predecessors. But being called by
the senate, he left the command of the army to Titus, his son, and after more
delay at Alexandria, entered Rome. Titus began the siege of Jerusalem in
4069£, just 40 years after the prophecy of Jesus Christ. Jerusalem was
destroyed towards the end of the year, and Vespasian (who went to meet his
son) and Titus entered Rome in triumph. Vespasian reigned 10 years.
4077 J Titus succeeded his father and reigned 2j years, from June 23, 4077, to Sept. 18,
40S0. Both Titus and his father were good Emperors.
4080 Domitian received the purple about September 20, and reigned 15 years. At his
death St. John was liberated from Patmos where he received Revelations.
4095 Nerva began in Sept, and reigned 1 year, 4 months, and 9 days. He died on the
27th of January. He was an aged senator, but disgusted for his parsimony.
Trajan was proclaimed on Jan. 27th and reigned 19 years, 6 months and 15 days
He died Aug. 11th, 4115. This completes the Emperors of the Ist century


CONFIRMATIONS OF THE YEARS REIGNED,
If we can clearly fix the year and period of the year when one of the Roman Emperor*
began to reign, we can fix all of them.
We have good means for proving the year when Tiberius died. In Acts ix. 23. we
have a statement of the year when St. Paul was converted. The verse alludes to the
intercalary days which occurred at the end of every 3rd year in order to bring lunar
time up to solar. The solar cycle shows that the end of 4034 was an intercalary period.
St. Paul therefore became a Christian that year. He had been contending with the Jews
during a short period, and then escaped from violence, his friends letting him down by
the wall in a basket. This would be in the beginning of 4035. In 2 Cor. xi. 32, St. Paul
gives additional particulars of importance, as he mentions that “ In Damascus the Gov-
ernor under Aretas, the king, kept the city with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me, but
through a window, in a basket, I was let down by the wall and so escaped his hands.”
This Aretas was king of Arabia, and it seems strange that he was also king of Damascus,
the chief city of Syria, which belonged to the Romans. But Josephus says that Aretas
defeated the troops of Herod Antipas, upon which Tiberius—who was a friend of
Herod—ordered Vetellius, the Roman Governor of Syria, to collect troops and take Aretas
prisoner. But before the order could be executed Tiberius died. This sudden respite
gave Aretas opportunity to march on Damascus and reduce it to his possession. This
then was the period when St. Paul was in Damascus. Tiberius died March 16th. 4034 J.
We must allow some time for Aretas taking the city and his possession of it, before the
Romans expelled him after the affairs of the empire were settled. It seems clear that
St. Paul was converted late in 4034, before the intercalary days in September, and that
Tiberius died previously in the spring of the same year.
The Emperor Claudius began to reign Jan. 24th, 4038 J, and as a reward for the ser-
vices of Herod Agrippa 1., who had assisted him in becoming Emperor, he was made
king of Judea. Accordingly we see by Acts xii. 1, that in the following year, 4039,
he killed St. James with the sword, namely, at Easter. Herod, however, died two and
half years afterwards, during the games, Aug. 2nd, in celebration of the empire.
This same Claudius has the exact period of his reign confirmed by the historian Sueto-
nins who wrote the Life of Claudius 50 years after the Emperor died.
By the Book of Acts we have a confirmation of the years of Nero. St. Paul (Acts
xxviii. 30.) “dwelt two whole years in his own hired house” in Rome, from late in the
spring of 4059 J to the same period in 4061 J, and we find that it was during “more than
a year ” at that time that Nero, who had resolved on making a tour of his empire to
exhibit his abilities as a singer, was absent from Rome. When he returned he was much
engaged in his vocal and fiddling profession up to the great fire in the city, by which St.
Paul was burnt out in the beginning of summer 4061. These were parts of the 7th
and 9th years of Nero. St. Paul after visiting some near cities and wintering at Nico-
polis (Titus iii. 12) returned to Rome in 4063, but the Jews having thrown off the
Roman yoke, a bitter feeling prevailed against them in Rome, and St. Paul was be-
headed on June 29th, 4063 f. The Emperor committed suicide on June 11th, 4065 J.
I may here explain that what has fogged translators is the statement in Acta xxiv. 27,
which refers to the intercalary period at the end of 4058, meaning “ two full years,” as
often expressed—when a full lunar and solar year came together—and not a period of 24
months. St. Paul was never two years in prison. All the dates of the following chapter,
which I have tabulated elsewhere, also prove that St. Paul was sailing to Rome and
was shipwrecked at Malta next month.
DEATH OF AUGUSTUS PROVED BY AN ECLIPSE.
The proof of a year or date by an eclipse is a very simple process. We are informed
by history that there was an eclipse of the sun a few days after the death of Augustus,
the first emperor. He died on the 19th of Aug. 4010, the last month of the a.m. year.
Now all we have to do is to look for the year on the Triple Eclipse Table printed in the
section of “Eclipse Line of Time.” We there find that the nearest preceding year was
4002. The years of the Table are in series of IS from creation- This is because an
eclipse occurs again after 18 years. We next look at the Ancient Hebrew Bird’s Eye
View of Eclipses the beginning of which is always the years of the Triple Eclipse Table
Hence Line I. was 4002, just mentioned. By counting forward Line IX would be 4010
This would be the year when Augustus died because there was a total eclipse of sun on
the first of the last month of the year, that is, lunar time. It would be, by solar time,
nearly 30 days later, as the year was an intercalary one, shown at the end of the line.


ANCIENT HEBREW SOLAR CYCLE.
This Cycle of 15 years began with 1722, a.m., thus following the Antediluvian Cycle,
the last seven years form of which ended with 1721. We get this fact by the position of
the eclipses, for working which it was probably invented. In every respect the cycle is
of the best and highest astronomical character, and its working is as true now as it was
more than 4,000 years ago. It gives us the date and day of the week of all eclipses.
After the Flood in 1(556, all the dates of Scripture, together with their day of the
week, are found on this cycle, which seems also to have been in use amongst the
Chaldeans.
The a.m. years are obtained by substracting the n.c. years from 4004, Thus, 1491, B.c.
was the Exodus year, and when deducted from 4004 gives 2,513 for the a.m. year, which
in this case is correct.

Another selfsame day is found in Ezek. xl. 1-
In chap, xxxiii. 21, the prophet says the city wa,
smitten in the 12th year of the captivity, on the
sth day (Saturday) of 10th mouth. The first six
months of the captivity years fell on one civil
year, and the last six on the next one, as shown
on the list of Captivity Years; hence the 10th
sacred (4th civil) month fell upon table b. which
was 3418 a.m. Turning next to chop. xl. 1.. we
read that in the 25th year of the captivity, “in
ihe beginning of the year,’’ that is 3431. on the
10th day of the mouth (Ist civil) “ in the 14th
year after the city was smitten,” the hand of
the Lord was upon me. This was Saturday agaiu,
table o. Both were Sabbath days and scientific.
“ In the 3rd (9th civil) month,” Exod. xix. 1.
table 1., the Israelites entered the Wilderness of
Sinai on the same day, that is Ist of the month,
hence the “third day,” when the Law was given,
was Tuesday the 3rd day of the week. It was
also the 50th day (I’cntccost) after the Passover
in Egypt. Pentecost means 50th.
Our Lord was born at the end of the 3rd
month, in 399 G, table j, answering to our Deo.
The common Christian Era began with the
4th month of 4000, table n, which was year 1,
a.d. It ought to have started with 4001, then
4002 would have been our 2, and so on. Owing
to this blunder our years are 1 before a.m.
The Crucifixion was Friday, 15th of 7th civil
(Ist sacred) month, table m. 4029, or 30 a.d. The
passover was eaten on Thursday evening, 14th.
The IGth was Saturday, old Sabbath, and 17th,
(Sunday) was resurrection —first Lord’s Day.
The rich cluster of dates beginning Acts xx. 6.
are 4058, or 59 a.d. table 1. See Paul’s Journey.
Table k. 2nd of 7ih civil mouth (Ist sacred) is
the date of Luke vi. 1., and should have been
translated “2nd of Ist month.”

The years of the patriarchs fiom Noah to Abraham-
like those from Adam to Noah— are an accur-ite and most
splendid record of solar years. This is easily proved by
noticing that the lines of the eclipses they requite are not
broken by them. In this way science verifies each year.
The way by which we obtain the year 2082, when Abra*
ham left Ur (a f rst year of this cycle) is— 1
• Terah left the city of Ur with Abraham on 15th of 7th
month, 2082, table a, and died in Haran, 2083 Gen. xi. 31.
HOW THE CYCLE IS PROVED.
1. It is astronomical, being the movements of
the moon. 2. It is perpetual and as true to-day
as it was 4000 years ago, at Heber’s birth. 3. The
fifteen Songs of Degrees (Psalms cxx. to cxxxiv.
represent the 15 years of the solar cycle. 5. A
solar cycle of 15 years, but no other will produce
the Biblical dates and periods.
SELFSAME DATS.
Table a. was 2082, when Abraham left Ur, and
table 1. was 2513, when the exodus took place.
The 7th months are alike in their dates of Sab-
bath Days, therefore the 15th of both tvould pro-
duce “ the selfsame day” of the week (Tuesday)
and date of the month. We read in Numbers
xxxiii.3. that the Israelites left Egypt on the 15th
of the Ist sacred mouth (7th civil) thus showing
in Exod. xii. 41, what Moses meant by “the end
pf the 430 years” falling then on a selfsame day.
HOW TO FIND THE YEARS.
The year given in the margin of the Bible is
found by subtracting the n.o. year from 4004.
Thus 1491 from 4001 is 2513, a.m., the exodus.
The following were first years of this solar
cycle of the Ancient Hebrews, that is table a.
By knowing this any intervening year is found.
If therefore any year wanted is not in the list,
take the nearest preceding one; for example,
the Israelites marched out of Egypt in the 7th
civil month of 2513, as the nearest preceding
year in the list is 2502, and, of course, the first
on the cycle, we must count forward upon it
antil we arrive at 2513, which is table I.
Our 1879. ap. began on Table a, fithof 4th month, 5877.
The sol, cycle and eclipses prove US I yr. 9 rnntbs too fast.

EXPLANATION OF THE SOLAR CYCLE.—A solar cycle means the number of
years by which the same day of the week comes round again on the same date of the
month. The figures are Saturdays, the seventh days, in each of the 12 months of the
15 years. The Bible years were lunar, 354 days, and the months were always 30 or 29
days alternately. No man could alter this method, because the moon is 29J days in
going round the earth and it was necessary to have a new moon on the first day of every
month. But as the lunar year is 11 days shorter than the solar year, an extra mouth
of 34 days was used after every three years, so as to bring the two years together. Three
times 11 are 33, but the moon required one day more in three years. Each year has an
italic letter above it for the sake of identification. It will be seen in table a that the
first Sabbath Day (Saturday) tell on the 7th day of the month. The next Sabbath Days
were on the 14th 21st and 28th. As the first month had 30 days, there were two days
of the week to carry over into the second month. Therefore as 2 and 5 are 7, the first
Seventh Day of the second month fell on the sth of the month, the others on 12, 19, 20,
and so on throughout the cycle, which by being astronomical goes on for ever. Now as
this solar cycle started with 1722 a.m, the reader can find any subsequent year by add-
ing 15 to the Ist year a , till he reaches the year he wants, and should it be a year be-
tween 15, he must count the years one by one till he reaches the iuteivening year. All
the years of table a end with a figure 2or 7- The sacred year begins with the
7th month, because the Israelites came out of Egypt in that month, Hence the 7th civil
month is always the Ist sacred month, and the 3rd civil is the 9th sacred, and so on.

Sabbath on the 2nd of Ist month (sacred) There are many other dates and events in the Bible which can be ascertained by
this solar cycle and they enlarge our interest in the records. Creation and Flood dates belong to the Antediluvian Solar
Cycle and for their beautiful astronomical character are the best history in the world,
THE YEARS OF THE ANCIENT HEBREW SOLAR CYCLE.
As already explained in another section of All Past Time, there is a good method for
ensuring the identification of the years of this Cycle by bearing in mind the fact that
the first year, as time proceeds, must always end alternatively with a2or 7. Thus 2082
begins the cycle, and the next, 15 years later, starts with 2097. It should also be stated
that as it is the observance of weeks of seven days that forms a solar cycle by bringing
the days of the week ronnd again on the same dates of the month, every solar cycle
must consist of an even number of 7 years, such as 7, 14, 21, 28. The Antediluvian
cycle was 7 years, and the English is 28. But the Ancient Hebrew cycle is in this
respect not perfect. It is 15 years. It is in principle o.ie of 21 years, having 6 years
cut out, namely, the 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th and 14th.
The discovery of this fact is a memorable event in my investigation. It was fortunate,
I might say providential, that I made an error, which, had it not occurred, I fear that
the Ancient Hebrew Solar Cycle would have been yet unknown. I had written out the
15 years as a cycle, taking the date of the beginning and ending of the sojourn of 430
years as my example. After completing this, I was much gratified to find that these
15 years worked the Biblical dates. But one evening, as I was using the intercalary
months, I found that I had an error of a day at the foot of the 9th year. 1 then, with,
unspeakable grief, saw that my table of 15 years was no solar cycle. I went to bed
almost broken-hearted. During the night it occurred to me that as the table was per-
fect down to the end of the 9th year, I would continue it and see where it ended. I rosa
and found that the cycle completed itself in 21 years. But it would not work anyof
the drtes of Scripture which extended over 15 years. I soon afterwards found that the
cycle had, for some purpose, been amputated, the six years I have mentioned being left
out, and that to meet the 10th year, starting with the Sabbath Day on the Ist of the
month, 30 days instead of the usual 29 were given to the 12th month in the 9th year.
The reason for this clever manipulation subsequently appeared. It is in order to keep
up with the motion of the moon and work the cycle on the principle of 360 years. I
often rejoice that I made a little error which led to such a uselul discovery. By this
cycle of 15 years, the solar eclipses are on the Ist day of the month, and the moon is
full and eclipsed, when she is in her node, in the middle of the month.
Tlie days of the week do not fall on the same dates on different solar cycles.

THE MARCH OF THE CHILDREN OP ISRAEL FROM EGYPT.
DATE OF THE DELIVERY OF THE LAW, Ac.
Year 2513, a.m., Table U the 12th of the Ancient Solar Cycle, 1483 n.c.
Ist sacred, or 7th civil mouth. 2nd sacred, or Bth civil. 3rd sacred, or 9th civil.
* There are three very important dates on the 15th of this month, viz., the departure of
Abram from the City of Ur, in 2082, the march out of Egypt by the Israelites in 2513, and
the crucifixion of Jesus Christ in 4029. The first one is obtained by it being “ the selfsame
day ” of the week and date of the month as the date of the Exodus which formed “ the
end of the 430 years,’’ mentioned in Ex. xii. 41 and 61. The three dates are respectively
on tables a. U and m. on the Solar Cycle.
It is interesting also to notice that the journey of St. Paul in 4058, from Greece through
Macedonia to Palestine, occurred on this same 12th year and three month of the Cycle,
the numerous dates of which, as recorded by St Luke commencing Acts xx., are a conclu-
sive proof of the unalterable character of a Solar Cycle of Lunar Years.
The length and character of the Exodus year—an intercalary one—will be seen by look-
ing at Table I. the 12th of the Cycle which shows which months had alternately 30 days.
There are no definite means of knowing the day when the Israelites crossed the Eed Sea.
But it seems to have been about six days after commencing the march.
The quails sent “at even,” indicates that this supply was after sunset when the Sabbath
was over on the 17 th of the 2nd sacred month.
There is yet another point of interest connected with the exodus dates. From the exode
to the delivery of the law, and from the setting up of the tabernacle to the lifting up of
the cloud, were both fifty days.
The difference between the B.c. given above and that in the margin of the Bible is owing
to the latter being taken from 4004 as the year of the birth of our Lord, instead of 3996,
which all scholars now admit to be the true year. It is time the erroneous year should be
dropped, as it is often misleading.

YEARS OF THE CAPTIVITY.
The 8.0. is the true one, that is, from the Nativity in 399 G. That of the margin of the
Bible will be generally obtained by the addition of 8. It will be observed that the years
of the Captivity are on the sacred principle, beginning in tbe middle of the ordinary year,
with the 7th civil month. They are therefore half on one year and half on the next.
The particular years of the Captivity are fully proved by referring to Ezekiel’s dates.
The 70 years of Jewish Captivity, so minutely mentioned by Ezekiel, began wrth the
Ist sacred, which is the 7th civil, month of 3406, a.m., 590 b. 0., table e. of the Ancient
Hebrew Solar Cycle. Jehoiachin reigned three months of the same year in Jerusalem, in
the first three sacred months, on the completion of which Nebuchadnezzar came up against
Jerusalem and carried away the king and the principal men to Babylon. 2 Kings, xxiv. 8.
Nine years afterwards, on the 10th day (Sunday) of the 10th sacred month, 4th civil,
year 3415, the 9th of Zedekiah’s reign, table n, Nebuchadnezzar pitched against Jerusalem.
See 2 Kings xxv. 1, and Ezekiel xxiv. 1. Next year, 3416, table o, on the 9th day of the
4th sacred, 10th civil, month (Friday), the famine prevailed and there was no bread in the
city. King Zedekiah fled, but was captured and taken to Babylon. This was 18 months
after the siege began. On the 7th of the following month the House of the Lord was burnt.
But Jer. lii. 12. speaks cf the 10th day. He classes the kings’ house and other buildings
with the temple—three days’ work. The second temple was also burnt by Titus on the 10th.

THE BOOK OF JUDGES, &c.
The following is the chronological order of the Book of Judges. The first col. to the
right is the number of years mentioned in scripture, except where no Bible refer-
ence is given on the left. The col. on the extreme right is the year of the world from
Creation, which is simpler than giving the year before Christ, inasmuch as it shows an
unbroken and consecutive line of history; but the true n.c. year for any of the years
can be found by deducting 3996, which was the year when our Lord was bom. To
find the Biblical n.c. year, 4004 must be deducted. The sign © represents the eclipse
line of time, which is an unalterable factor and is the total eclipse of the sun Line i..
No. 1„ or the first eclipse in the chart of 18 years, the occurrence of which is regularly
noted in the “List of Astronomical Tears.”
Thus from the exodus in 2513, to the foundation of Solomon’s temple in 2993, are
the 480 years mentioned in 1 Kings vi. 1. “In the 480th year after the Children of
Israel were come out of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon, the House of the Lord
began to be built.” That the year 2513 and 2993 are correct, we hare a host of proofs,
but the Solar Cycle, which is astronomical time, determined also by eclipses ana tran-
sits, sets the question at rest. Table lof the Ancient Hebrew Solar Cycle gives Tuesday.
15th of Ist sacred (7th civil) month for the exodus, and Friday, 2nd of 2nd sacred
month, 2993, also table I, for laying the foundation of the temple. We cannot alter
these dates without displacing the orbs of the solar system.
The Book of Judges appears to be a straight-forward book ending with chapter xii,
the subsequent chapters belonging to another and earlier part of history. This chapter
xii. leaves us at 2883, as the above table and the scripture references show. All stu-
dents of the Bible allow 20 years, or rather more, for the period of Joshua’s rule. We
must therefore complete the interval of 27 years for which we have no direct scripture
reference, as indicated at the left side of the section. This we can do by dissecting
the period as related in other parts of the Bible. The reader must therefore notice sec-
tions B. C. E. used for this purpose.
* The conquest of Heshbon was in 2552, one year before entering the promised land,
therefore the 300 years end with 2852. See Numb. xxi. 25 and 32.

We are told that the building was finished

As Eli lived 98 years (I Sam. iv. 15), and

was no judge in Israel after the death of
Jair, in 2834, (up to which period the lino

began to take authority. It is evident
from Judges xv. 20 that Samson’s twenty
years were during the Philistine domina-
tion which rose with that of the Ammon-

THE EVERLASTING KINGDOM.
This splendid subject is connected with
the 450 years of the rule of Judges, but
owing to the obscurity of translations of
acts xiii and 2 Sam. vii., &c., it has not
re -eived the attention it deserves. There
is something very special in the message
which came to Nathan “that night,” after
he had been in conversation with David.
The king was told that the Lord would
establish his house and kingdom for ever!
This was in the year 2963 and it is a very
beautiful prophecy, the fulfilment being
found in Scripture, connected with the
end of the Jewish Times and Millennium.
The following are examples :
The end of the Jewish Times of 2320
years from the Captivity in 3406, is 6926.
The propheey of the Everlasting Kingdom
reaches this and is half way from erection.

We have by these beautiful examples
the revived Everlasting Kingdom (before
which the temple will be built with splen-
dour in Jerusalem), the end of the Jewish
Times and the Millennium. 5926 is 1928.
There are two or three other points of
interest connected with the Book of J udges.
Reference has been made in Section A. to
the 300 years alluded to by Jephlhah ia
Judges xi. 25. He is speaking of the con-
quest of Hesbon by Moses one year before
the Israelites crossed Jordan. The conquest
was therefore in 2552, and the 300 years
ended in 2852 which the solar cycle snows
was an intercalary year. Now the 4th verse
or margin, which is the Hebrew interpreta-
tion, alludes to the intercalary period, and
therefore enables us to put a finger upon the
800th year in the same way as systematic
chronology enabled us to ascertain what
was the 20th year of Artaxerxes respecting
which there used to be so much discussion.
Judges xvii to end of the book details
incidents at the close of chap. ii.
CROSSING JORDAN,
The importance of the period of the
Judges is seen hy the date of crossing the
Jordan in 2553, when Moses died, which
is the last year on Historical Table 111.
By referring to the .Solar Cycle of the
Ancient Hebrews it will be seen that 2553
was the 7th year, table g, of the cycle. In
Joshua iv. 19. we read that Jordan was
| crossed on the 10th day of the Ist (sacred)
month. As the 11th was Saturday, the
Israelites crossed on Friday so that their
first complete day in the Land of Rest was
the Day of Rest. All the figures of the
cycle are seventh days—Saturday.
Such dates, proved by the Solar Cycle,
are a confirmation of history. But Bibli-
cal dates are planetary motion, and are
also proved by all astronomical lines of
time, such as the Transits of the planet
Mercury and the Metonic Cycle. There
is no other history proved ia this way.
SEVENTV KINGS and THIRTY-TWO
KINGS IN ONE COUNTRY;
The Book of Judges, like other portion
of ancient history, throws immense lighten
the system of government before popula-
ion was large enough to form nations. In
this way we see in a moment how three or
four Egyptian dynasties existed at one
time. In Judges i. 7, we read of Adoni-
hezek having three-score and ten kings
gathering their meat under his table after
having been subdued by his superior arms.
In like manner Joshua slew thirty-two
kings (Joshua xii. 7—14) whose united ter-
ritory did not exceed that of Scotland. The
fact is, in that period of the world popula-
tion was so sparce—the flood having taken
place but 860 years previously—that gov-
ernment was often only of a tribal char-
acter. Every little city had a king. But
when population increased dominion was
naturally extended. With so many exam-
ples of petty dominion before us, it is mani-
fest folly to suppose that the early dynasties
of Egypt were consecutive. As I have
stated elsewhere, Brugsch says five of them
were collateral; Bunsen says seven, and
Wilkinson and another says twelve existed
at one time in various parts of the country.
It must he granted, however that owing to
independence of rain, Egypt would attract
population, but there is no evidence that
the country was united under one rule till
the empire began in 2235 by Aahmes, who
was also called Amosis I, the founder of the
18th dynasty, 41 years before Joseph was
sold into Egypt. It is always wise to com-
pare the history of one country with others.
THE BOOK OF JUDGES, &c.


BUN STANDING STILL.
Herodotus tells nr that the priests of
Egypt showed him a record of a Jong day.
This was probably the day in which the
sun “ stood still” in Joshua’s time. IVe
have another record of the same singular
phenomenon found in the Chinese writings,
which say that in the reign of Yeo, the sun
did not set for the space of ten days (prob-
ably ten hours as then understood). At all
events the reign of Yeo was contemporary
with the period when Joshua flourished.
We therefore seem to have three records of
this event first mentioned in Joshua x. 13.
A chronologist hopes that the same event
which we read as ‘‘written in the hook of
Jasher,” will he found, and thus become a
fourth, which itreally is, because Jasher did
not write the Book of Joshua. Some,
however do not regard Jasher as a man, bat
a collection of general and historical events
referred to by the Seventy translators in
the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus.
THE SABBATH DAY NOT OF
HEBREW ORIGIN.
As all the Antediluvian dates, and also
those during the time of the postdiluvian
patriarchs, form into solar cycles, we have
uncontrovertible evidence that weeks of
seven nays were observed from the first
seventh day mentioned in Gen. ii. Every
mau acquainted with scientific chronology
knows that there is no solar cycle without
weeks, and this is why our own dates come
round again by bringing the same day of
i he week upon the same date of the month
as at a known previous period, viz., after
38 years. That is to say, as Sunday was
the sth of Jan. in 1563, it must of necessity
fall on the same date in 1896. See the
Solar Cycle of the Christian Era. This fact
would occur after seven years, did we not
break the chain of dates every fourth year
by having a leap year, which lengthens our
solar cycle to 4 times 7. Now let the reader
look at the Antediluvian Solar Cycle where
he will find that the 17th day of the 2nd
month falls on the seventh day, Saturday,
in the sth year of that cycle. I'his we are
lold in Gen. vii. XI, was the date of the
Flood, and by compiling the births of the
patriarchs given in Gen. v. (See the table
given in the page of the cycle in question),
we learn that the year was 1656. Let the
reader work out the cycle by sevens and he
will find that the year No. 5, containing
the Flood dates, was 1058, hence we see that
weeks of seven days have been observed by
the Antediluvians from the first Sabbath of
year 0 to 1650. The table of first years of
cycle given in the following page will help
him to prove this, otherwise it is easily done
by dividing 1656 by 7, and, of course, allow-
ing the first year to be 0, as when we reckon
the first of our life. This however, is but
one method of proving the observance of
weeks of seven days by the Antediluvians.
The application of the Lunar Cycle is a
most powerful scientific test and is a tri-
umphant proof of the same fact. The
eclipse line of time is a third and the two
transit lines of Mercury and Venus are
others. So that he who says the Sabbath
is of Hebrew origin is a very ignorant man.
In like manner the emphatic expression of
Moses in Exodus xii. 41, relative to the end
of 430 years, could not fall on the same day
of the week and date of the month, before
the delivery of the Sabbath law without a
continued observance of weeks of seven
days. Indeed we have indubitable evidence
that the seventh day has never ceased to be
observed. Great scientific facts show us
that the Sabbath was kept 2-513 year* before
the law from Sinai, 1516 by the Jews from
thence to the resurrection of Christ in 4029,
and 1853 years in the Christian era up to
1883, when these lines were written. The
three periods may he thus represented:—
Before the law 2513
By Hebrews 1516
By Christians 1853
Total of years 5882
The Sabbath has thus been a Jewish insti-
tution for the shortest period 1
THE LONG LIVES OF THE
PATRIARCHS.
There are three or four great scientific
facts, which are irresistible to chronological
astronomers, respecting the long lives of
the antediluvian patriarchs, viz. unless the
precise periods of time he allowed for their
lives, as stated in the Hebrew chronology
of the Genesis, the ten dates of the flood
could not have occurred in 1656, the year
by Usher in Gen. v.; neither would it be
found possible to have eclipses and transits
at the times we now see them, or to have
the ancient records of eclipses. To doubt
the accuracy of chronological periods with-
out testing them by some reliable scientific
process, is possible, but it is now palpable
evidence of ignorance. Men must allow
the time claimed by Biblical history, viz.
3996 solar years before Christ, whatever
they please to think of the incidents re-
corded, though as dates are not mentioned
in a primary sense, and could not all be
correct if invented, it is hard to doubt the
events which dates are used to record. Mr,
Darwin may be regarded as an able man,
but he is now in the position of Tycho
Brahe in respect to modern astronomy.
ANCIENT ItECORDS CONFIRMED.


PEOPHETIC PERIOES.
There are eight important Prophetical Periods in the Old Testament, four of which
tare been fulfilled, as we now see, with most wonderful precision. They are :
I. —l2O years from the date of the announcement of the Flood to the
date of the day when it began 1530 to 1650
11. —430 years from the day of the week and date of the month when
Abraham left the City of Ur, to the selfsame day of the week and date of
the month when the Israelites marched out of Egypt 2082 to 2513
H 1.—472 years from the month Khan, in 3557, which was the 20th of
Artaxerxes, to the same month in 4020, when our Lord was crucified ... 3557 to 4029
IV. —7O years Captivity. The greater of the two periods 3406 to 3470
UIfFULFILLEP.
V. —2300 years to the Cleansing of the Sanctuary (Dan. viii. 14)
VI. —1260 days to the completion of the scattering of the power of the
holy people (Dan. xii. 7.)
V 11—1290 days (30 more) verse 11. ... ... ... ... ...
V 111.—1335 days (45 more) verse 12
The following are some details of each of tho eight periods, and now that we have
the means of accurately dealing with time and history by a system of measurements
which are also controlled and proved by astronomical cycles, we ought to give our
attention to these periods if we wish to have a correct view of their importance.
L—THE DELUGE.
120 Tears to the Flood in 1656.
Noah mentions in Gen. vii. 13. that the
flood came on the earth on “ the selfsame
day,” that is, he entered the ark on the
same day of the week and same date of the
mouth as occurred at some special previous
period. On looking at the Antediluvian
Solar Cycle, the sth of the 7 years, we see
that “ the 17th of the 2nd month,’’ when
he entered the ark, was Saturday, the old
Sabbath Day, in the year 1656, and that
the same date fell on the same day of the
week 120 years previously, viz., in 1536.*
Thus the remarkable period of waiting for
the repentance of the Antediluvians, men-
tioned in Gen. vi. 3, was completed to a day.
It is the Solar Cycle which brings round
the date of the month on the fame day of
the week, as is the case with ours, but with-
out the use of weeks of seven days no Solar
Cycle exists. I therefore look upon this
date of the Flood as the first proof that the
Sabbath Day was kept np from its institu-
tion in year 0. There are numerous proofs
of this character, and I would particularly
impress upon public writers, if they wish to
preserve the reputation of their names, not
to theorise with Scripture history. In how
many books have we been told that the
Sabbath Day was a Jewish institution ? In
how many volumes do we read of the flood
as having occurred at a period contradictory
to all proper investigation and Scripture
testimony. Such men might more to their
advantage be engaged in stone-breaking
tnan teaching the science of chronology, of
which they know nothing—not even so
much as a simple Solar Cycle I
The prophecy of a flood cannot be dis-
associated from the year 1656, because we
see (hat nine of the ten dates, expressed 01
implied, in the diary of Noah, aredatesof
that year and first two monlhs of the next.
As the dates are on the sth year of the
cycle, it is a simple process of multiplica-
tion to see if the repetition of the solar cycle
of seven years produces them for the fifth
year and whether it was 1656. This was
the first test which I made of (he accuracy
of a Biblical date, and when I saw how it
could be done, I began the investigation
with some hesitation, for fear I should de-
tect an error and thereby supply means for
rejecting the years given fortbe birth of all
the Antediluvian Patriarchs, and the un-
broken observance of the Seventh Day. In
fact I knew that the detection of an error, if
it existed, would destroy all Biblical chron-
ology My joy was great when when I saw
that the consecutive repetition of 236 cycles
made the Ist year of the cycle 1652. hence
the sth year of the same cycle was 1656, the
very year we obtain in Gen. V. when we add
the birth of the patriarchs to the 600th
year of Noah, when the Flood occurred.
This is most marvellous. More so when, as
I afterwards saw, that the same accuracy
was strictly supported by the Metouic, or
lunar cycle, by the eclipse and two transit
cycles. To these I invite the reader’s atten-
tion, and hero I wish also to state that I
have never found an error in Biblical years.
I am certain (hat if those men who doubt
Scripture Chronology would only invesii-
gate it by the light of advanced science,
they would endorse the whole of it. Let no
man make assertions he cannot prove. _
• There are other instances in Scripture History of this significant completion of periods of time.


lI.—THE SOJOURN.
“430 years” sojourn of the Children
of Israel. Exodus xii, 40. It informs us
that the sojourn of the children of Israel
was 430 years, and “at the end of 430
years, even the selfsame day it came to pass
that the hosts of the Lord went out from
the land of Egypt.”
The solar cycle of the Ancient Hebrews
shows us that the 15th of the 7th month,
was Tuesday, when the Israelites left
Egypt, in 2513, and the beginning of 430
years before that date was also Tuesday the
15th of the 7th month, in the year 2082.
As Abraham left the City Ur in this 2082,
the words of Moses plainly refer to these
two incidents forming the beginning and
the end of the “ sojourn.” The period was
thus completed to a day, called “ the self-
same day,” because it was the same date of
the month and the same day of the week.
This marvellous precision is still more
clear to us when we observe that to add 430
years to 2082 is 2512. But Moses says “ to
the end of 430 years.” Now as the 7th
month is the middle of 2082, that year is
only six months of the 430, and hence the
period of the sojourn must run to the mid-
dle of the next year 2513, to form the end
of 430 years. Otherwise the exodus would
have been in 2512. The fact is one year of
the 430 is but six months of 2082, and six
months of 2513. If the reader looks at the
solar cycle he will see this at a glance.
Table a. is 2082 and table I. is 2513. In
both these years Saturday, the Sabbath
Day, in the 7th month was 12th, therefore
Tuesday was 15th. Compare Exodus xii,
41,51, with Numbers xxxiii 3, and bear in
mind that the 7 th month was called the
Ist month after the exodus.
lII.—THE CRUCIFIXION, 4029.
This is the most important of all the
fulfilled periods.
It was not till the summer of 1883 that
the full meaning of this very impressive
prophecy was discovered, viz., by Dr. Alder
Smith, of Christ’s Hospital, London, to
whom the religious world will for ever be
indebted. He has certainly accomplished
in a few lines what eminent Divines have
been endeavouring during many centuries
to arrange, This eminent scholar found
that the years represented by days were
not solar, but lunar.
Dan. ix, 25-‘‘From the going forth of
the commandment to restore and to build
Jerusalem unto the Messiah, the Prince,
shall be seven weeks and three score and
two weeks.” (69 weeks)
“He shall confirm the covenant with
many for one week, and in the midst of
the week ho shall cause the sacrifice and
the oblation to cease.” (Midst of a week is
half a week.)
Result—The C9J- weeks of Daniel ix, are
486fc lunar years, which are equal to 472
solar years. The commandment went
forth in the middle of Nisan, the 7th civil
month, and Jesus Christ was crucified in.

store and build Jerusalem; —

472 the above solar years.

was our a.d., 30.
It will be seen by fhe Solar Cycle that
table m is 4029, and that it must be the cru-
cifixion year, because Friday is the 15th of
the 7th month, as shown by Saturday, the
old Sabbath Day, being the 16th. The
Passover was eaten “ in the 14th day of the
month, at even” (Numbers ix. 3.) and hence
our Lord partook of it on Thursday evening,
the 14th, being the night before his cruci-
fixion. I showed these facts to Dr. Alder
Smith, who, although ho had found that
472 solar years formed the period of Daniel’s
great prophecy, was at that time unac-
quainted with the power of solar cycles for
determining the day of the week on which
dates fall, and also the true year of any
event. 1 also showed him how the 20th
year of Artaxerxes was certainly 3557, by
consecutive counting from all other years
of Persian monarchs mentioned inScripture,
more particularly the fact that the margin
of Nehemiah xiii. 6. states that the 32nd
year of Artaxerxes was an intercalary one
having extra days added to it, as shown by
the words *• at the end of days,” the same
fact being also shown by the solar cycle,
(See table c, year 3569) and hence we hava
several proofs that table/, the 20th year,
was 3557.
The reader must look for himself at all
these interesting details.
THE PROPHETIC PERIODS—RESULT OF RECENT DISCOVERIES.


The foregoing shows ns that the half
week (or the 31 day-years) of the 70 weeks
mentioned in Daniel ix. 24, are yet in the
future, the present period being an inter-
val formed in the midst of the 70th week.
We also find, when compared with Sec-
tion 11., that:
1. AhiahamleftUron 15thof 7th mnth.
2. Israelites left Egypt 15th of 7th mnth.
3. Jesus was crucified 15th of 7thmnth.
Therefore every intelligent man, whether
Jew or Christian, must see that Jesus is
the Son of God, the date of his crucifixion
being allied to the call of Abraham and the
Exodus.
If the reader wishes to see more into the
value of Daniel’s 70 weeks, the following
proof will he interesting. I have shown j
that 69 weeks multiplied by 7 produce 483
days, called prophetic years. To prove .
them to be lunar we must multiply the
483 by 354, which is the number of days
in a lunar year. The product is 170,982
days, which turned into solar years of 365
days each, come to only 4681 years. This
is all we can make of them. Thus
3557, the 20th of Artaxerxes, Neh. ii. 1.
4681 solar years, as above,
40251 a.m.
31 the first half of the 70th week.
4029 a.u., Crucifixion.
Here we see that 468 J solar years con-
tain the 486 J lunar years on the previous
page, thus proving that the 69 weeks when
multiplied by 7 to obtain the number of
day-years (483) are lunar years. They are
also 26 eclipse cycles of 18 years.
It is interesting to notice that there was
another representation of the 69 weeks of
Daniel in the building of this second tem-
ple, which was finished in 3488. Ezr. vi. 15.
Thus, 3488 temple completed.
Add 69 weeks to represent years.
8557 the 20th of Artaxerxes when
he ordered the restoration

The following is the Inner and solar an-
alysis, and proves that the prophecy began
in 8557 and ended in 4029. With the half
week added they are 691 weeks and com-
prise 4861 lunar years, which are equal to
472 solar years:

Crucifixion—Seventy Weeks.
Certainly the best way of proving the
prophecy of the crucifixion is by using the
70 weeks of Daniel on the solar year prin-
ciple. It is short and simnle ;
3543 the 7th of Artaxerxes. Ezra vii. 7.
49 the 7 weeks, being 7 times 7.
434 the 62 weeks multiplied by 7.
4026 “ The time is fulfilled.” Mark i. 16.
3 J Half week confirming covenant by
the Lord’s 3J years’ ministry.
4029 J Messiah cut off, oblation ceased.
Respecting this 40291, the 15th of the Ist
sacred month was Friday. See Hebrew
Solar Cycle, table m , middle of the year,
which has Saturday for the 16th. On
“ the 14th at evening," the Jews are re-
peatedly told to eat the sacrificial lamb.
The 14th was Thursday. Let me also say
that the 16th of this Ist sacred month is
throughout Scripture a great date. On it
Abraham was going to offer up his only
son Isaac, the 430 years sojourn began by
Abraham leaving the city of Ur, and ended
on the same date (Numbers xxxiii. 3,) &c.
All this is majestic and imperishable.
IV.—THE CAPTIVITY.
The first ca ptivity period began in 3395
when Pharaoh Necho carried Jehoahaz cap-
tive to Egypt, as recorded in 2 Kings xxiii.
31 to 36, and ended in 3466. To add 70
to 3395 makes only 3465; but it began in
the middle of the year, and therefore runs
to the end of the first half of 3466, which
was the Ist of Darius the Mede. Accord-
ingly Daniel, who was carried captive with
others in a first deportation of Hebrews to
Babylon, by Nebuchadnezzar in 3398, seems
to have expected the fulfilment in the Ist
year of Darius, 3466, and prayed to God
(See Dan. ix. 2-)
The second, or greater period of the
captivity, began in 3406, which was 11 yrs.
after the first period commenced, viz. when
the second , deportation was effected Iw
Nebuchadnezzar (2 Kings xxiv. 8—16). It
ended in 3476, a period of 70 years. It is
easy to find each of these 70 years, because
Exekiel dates from them. See “ Years of.
the Captivity” in this book, and “Ezekiel’s
Dates,” and notice them on the Solar-
Cycle which proves them and shows the
day of the week.
THE PROPHETIC PERIODS—RESULT OF RECENT DISCOVERIES.


THE TEAR WHEN ABRAHAM WAS HORN.
It is important to know the year when Abraham, a prominent person in history, was
born, bnt we must not go for it to such a passage as Gen. xi. 6, because Abraham was the
youngest of Terah’s three sons. We must get Abraham’s age where it is definitely given,
viz., Gen. xii. 4. where we are told (hat “Abraham was 75 when he departed out of
Haran." This was where his father died in 20-3, the year after leaving Ur. We read
in Gen. xi. 32, that Terah liyed 205 years, so that we have simply to deduct 75 from
2083, and we have 2008, the year when Abraham was born, namely when Terah was 130.
This agrees with all other statements, such as Gen. xxi. 5, where we are told that Abra-
ham was 100 when Isaac was born. I have already stated that the date when Abraham
left Ur with his father is astronomical and of the highest scientific character, which no-
man can disturb without dislodging the earth and the moon from their orbits. The date
was Tuesday, 15th ot the 7th mouth, 2082, and from it to the end of 430 years, as stated
by Moses in Exod. xii. 41, was again Tuesday, 15th of the 7th month, 2513. See Hebrew
Solar Cycle, table a, which was 2082 J, and same month in table I, 2SI3J, Saturday
in both cases being the 12th of the 7th month, Tuesday was the 15th, the day when the
Israelites left Egypt (Numbers xxxiii. 3). It is gratifying that by the advancement of
our knowledge the sciences ore coming un to revelation. Yet there are some men left
who are in the rear with their methods of teaching history and astronomy.
FOUR PLANETS SEEN DURING A SOLAR ECLIPSE,
The total eclipse of the sun on Wednesday, the 18th of July, 1860, was remarkable,
owing to the opportunity which it afforded for seeing several stars of the Ist magnitude,
together with four planets, near the sun, all of which would have been invisible had
not the body of the moon entirely covered the great luminary of day. The annexed cut
illustrates what has just been said, giving the view as seen in North Spain, where the
eclipse was total at 14 o’clock (2 in the afternoon). The four planets are represented by
small plain discs, as seen through a telescope, and the stars are pointed as they appear
to the naked eye. The uppermost planet is Saturn, that under it is Mercury, Jupiter
is close to the sun and Venus below him. The top star to left, near Saturn, is Begulns,
a handsome star in the constellation of the Lion. That in the left corner below is
Alphord. The lowest star in the centre is Procyon, and the two on the right, near the
sun, are Castor and Pollux, belonging to the constellation of the twins (Gemini). The
classification of the solar eclipse known to astronomical chronologists for purposes of
measuring the lapse of time, is No. 69, Line xviii. See Bird’s Eye View of Eclipses of
English Years, July, the bottom line. It occurs every 18 years, and in the course of 649-
years, travels from one end of the line to the other. This explains how we know by the
position or date of an eclipse, what is the true year of the world when an eclipse occurs.
Thus it first took place in July, year 18, to which add 9 cycles of 619 years (its repeat-
ing date in July) 5841, Total number of years 5859, which was our 1860. This is mak-
ing astronomy useful, which is the special work of the British Chronological and Astron-
omical Association, and for which it is deservedly commended.


ALL PAST TIME.
“It would be difficult to explain in a boot,’’ said the late Lord Chelmsford, “what a
clock is and what is its practical use, unless numerous diagrams were employed. But
■when the knowledge is obtained—supposing it had not been received early in life—the
learner would smile at the simplicity of the construction, and be thankful all the days of
his life for the useful information he had obtained.” This is a good illustration of the
Eositiou of every person who has unfortunately no knowledge of time as pointed out day
y day by the revolving orbs of heaven, which are, by the precision of their movements,
the originators and umpires of the moments and numbers of years; and when, after a few
simple words of explanation, the learner comprehends the grand dial formed by tbe
mechanism of the skies; when, indeed, the thought flashes into his mind which gives him
the power to discern their common movements as he does the hands of a clock, and to
listen to the voice of their periodical phenomena, such as eclipses and transits, as the re-
peating chimes from the belfry of heaven, he will feel that he has acquired a vast amount
of practical information, that scales of ignorance fall from his eyes, and all history—
hitherto unsystemised, or perhaps regarded as doubtful—will be pourtrayed as pictures
before his admiring mind. He will regret that so much useful information has not been
taught when at college or school, and that after all he has learned, his education in com-
mon and practical things, has been without a basis and incomplete. It is to give that
information that the pages of this book have been written, the object of whiuh is to teach,
•even to ordinary minds, that all past time can be known by astronomical measurements or
periodical cycles. When these are pointed out—which are as simple as the dial of a parish
clock—the reader will find that the statement that “ this is an age of scepticism," is only
such because it is an age of ignorance—that the human mind having obtained an imper-
fect view of the domain of one or two of the higher sciences, has unnecessarily swerved
from the lines of history. This is a common mistake, but we now find by the higher
achievements of modern science, that what were supposed to he history’s weakest points,
have become its strongest forts. Chronology has been an imperfect science, as was
formerly the old system of astronomy, but it is now the most exact of all sciences, and
instead of being dependant upon individual judgment, it is systematised by measure-
ments as unalterable and arbitrary as the multiplication table. The result is the same
products are obtained by all men, and history his become a science. Astronomy has also
been largely benefited by this accession. It is now as much applicable to time as to ob-
jects of distance, and by tbe classification of eclipses and transits, —which could not have
been accomplished without the correct knowledge of time supplied by Chronology—its
domain has been extended 4,000 additional years
EXPLANATION.
There are three Solar Cycles in this book. No other has existed. They are—X. Antedi-
luvian, giving the years from oto the end of 1721, A.M. formed of seven years. 2. Ancient
Hebrew, from 1722 to tbe end of 3999, a.m, formed of 15 years. 3. Christian Era, from
4000 a.m., which we compute as 1 a.d., to present time, formed of 28 years. There is no
Solar Cycle without weeks of seven days, and their existence proves that unbroken weeks
have come down to ns from year 0. They are formed by the dates found in history, two
or three of which are quite sufficient to construct them by a natural enumeration of tbe
seventh days in each of the 12 months of the year. They are really clocks. A Cycle is a
wheel. Hence we speak of a “ bi-oyole,” a vehicle of two wheels. Applied to time, a
cycle is a complete revolution, when the point of commencement comes round again. It
is formed by the precise number of years which brings the same day of the week on the
same day of tbe Month. Hence it is not possible to write eight Antediluvian years, be-
cause the eighth year would be like the first, having the same dates of the month on the
same days of the week. Like the Ist year (See Antediluvian Solar Cycle) an Bth year
would be written 7,14, 21, 23, as the dates of the seventh, or Sabbath, days. It would be
the same with every month, and the whole seven years of tbe Solar Cycle. Hence we have
the evidence of arithmetical testimony that the Antediluvian Solar Cycle was a continued
■repetition of seven years, as ours is of 28 years. We obtain its commencement, Saturday,
«n tita 7ft of tbe Ist month, from Gen. ii. 2, 3. as the first seventh or Sabbath day.


These seven years as written are the dates of Sabbath or seven days consecutively pro-
duced by counting 7. Thus 7 must be followed by 14, and so on. To prove that all the
dates written for the 12 months of each year, are Sabbath Days, we have only to remem-
ber that there can be no more nor less than 354 days in lunar years, which was the
ancient year, because it is formed by the moon. As the moon revolves round the earth in
29£ days, the 12 months of the year must alternately possess 00 and 29 days in order to
keep up with her movements—l 2 lunations, or months (moon-eths), in a year. This is
a system now followed by the Jews, Turks, and Chinese, who use the original lunar year,
the months of which arc more astronomical than our pagan solar year, which, although a
perfect measure of time, can begin and end any where, and have months of irregular
length. The lunar year, and each month of the year, must begin with a new moon. If
•we, then, notice the alternate months of a lunar year,—always 30 or 29 days—we must
write the dates as given in the Solar Cycle. Thus 7, 14, 21, 28, for the first month. As
there are 30 days in that month, we have 2 loft; therefore, as 2 and 6 are seven, the first
Sabbath or seventh day of the second month fell on the sth (See the Antediluvian Cycle).
Then as this second month had the dates of the Sabbath as 5, 12, 19, 26, and con tamed
29 days, there are 3 days left. These 3 and 4 more make the first Sabbath of the third
month to fall on the 4th of that month, and so on to the end of the year and Cycle. As
the Cycle ends with 29, and there are no more days in the month, the point for beginning
another Solar Cycle of 7 years is reached. It will hence bo plain that as the years pro-
ceeded in sevens, and we have the dates of the Flood on the sth year of the Cycle, the yeax
of the Flood falls on IGSG, when taken in sevens and adding 5. This is the year supplied
in Gen. v., as shown at the foot of the Cycle. Of course the first year is reckoned 0.
The next thing to be noticed is that intercalary or extra days were required to make lunar
years, which are formed of 354 days, equal to 365, which is the length of solar years.
It is clear that this was always done by the Antediluvians by using 77 days at the end of
the Cycle—7 times 11 are 77—that is 11 weeks. The lunar year is 11 days short of the tolar.
This plan would not disturb the Sabbath day. When it did, a week would be taken, because
•we find Biblical time has all been made solar. The lunar year was divided by the ancients
into weeks and days, but not the solar, which was to them as a period; but if they had
omitted to bring up the shorter lunar year of 354 days by taking up 11 exrta to make it up
to BGS, the seasons of the year would have soon been reversed. That these extra days were
most carefully observed by the Antediluvians is proved by the application of the Lunar
Cycle hereafter explained, and that such intercalary days were used at the end of the Solar
Cycle of seven repeating years, is evident from the dates of the Flood. Noah went into
the ark on the Ist day of the solar period, which in the sth lunar year—the solar having
begun 11 days later in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and sth, —had got so late as to begin that sth year
on “ the 17th of the 2nd month." It is very interesting to observe this. We get a peep
into Antediluvian affairs. The time would doubtless be one of great festivity. It was also
a Sabbath day, and Noah left the ark at the end of the solar year. By using 77 extra
days at the end of the Cycle its dates wore never disturbed, and the lunar and solar years
began on the same day with the commencement of each solar cycle. In this way also the
dates of Creation were re-instated, viz., Sunday the first day, and Saturday the seventh.
That the dates of the Sabbath Days were always the same as those on the Solar Cycle—
indeed men canuot alter lunar years without moving the moon from her orbit—is proved
by the previous 120th year occurring on the “ selfsame day,” that is of the week and date
of the month, as Noah’s diary informs us (Gen. vii. 13.). These are all matters of history.
These explanations are applicable to the Ancient Hebrew Solar Cycle of 15 years, one
reason for the introduction of which was probably to keep the solar and lunar years more
closely together. It adjusts the two years at the end of each 'third year, by the use of 34
intercalary days. The third year is frequently referred to in scripture history.
Like the Line of History, all the Lines of Astronomical Time were formed by working
backwards from the present period. They could be obtained in no other way. Much could
be said of their power and companionship for proving that nothing can be added or taken
away from the years of history. F'or instance, if an eclipse takes place on May lOih, it
indicates that a certain number of years has occurred to bring it up to that date. But if
it occurred on 10th of June, we should know that 42 years had been omitted by history,
because the date would not coincide with the year. Again, we cannot run away with the
■eclipses without taking the transits with us. To add a month to an eclipse, we should
have to pu-h the earth forward in her orbit in order to reach the only place opposite to
the node of Venus where we can see her in transit, and Venus also would have to be
driven onward with an accelerated motion to reach her node. In fact we cannot take an
hour out of one of the Five Astronomical Lines of Time without disturbing every orb in
♦he universe. t* Before tbsse lines of time all history must bow and every man be dumb.


THE EARTH IS THE BEST PLANET.
Although we sometimes read about the “plurality of worlds,” and indulge in reflec-
tions on the inhabitants of other planets, yet it must be confessed that the telescope
does not find a better world than our own. Jupiter has five satellites to illuminate his
nocturnal heaven, and Saturn, in addition to his eight satellites, has three rings round
him; but these will scarcely compensate for the greater distance of these two planets
from the sun, which from Jupiter is 494,265,155 miles, and from Saturn 906,183,000,
whilst from the earth the sun is but 92,500,000. Under these circumstances the orb
of day will appear less than half the size he does to ns. But the great drawback in
the case of Jupiter is that he has no revolving seasons. His axis is perpendicular, and
therefore in respect to most of his surface, he is a flowerless and fruitless world. I
have heard Sir Robert Hall say that Jupiter has an upper sea. Saturn and Neptune
are too far off for ns to discover anything respecting their climate. The latter planet is
2,870 millions of miles from the sun, which to him must shine but as a star, giving but
little light or heat. What would a harvest be to the inhabitants of planets, when the
year of Jupiter is 12, of Saturn 29, end of Neptune 84 of ours, A failure of crops would
be death all round if their supplies were obtained by seasons produced like ours.
Then as to Mars, “ our neighbour,” of which so much has been written of late, there
appears to be nothing inviting. He is 50 millions of miles farther from the sun than
we are, and appears to be a cold world repeatedly covered with water—frozen up and
then inundated. His winter is twice the length of ours. Venus our “ sister ” planet,
is about 30 millions nearer to the sun than the earth. Like our moon, she does not
rotate on her axis in less time than she completes a revolution round her primary, and
therefore has no alternate night and day for labour and repose. Mercury is nearly 30
millions nearer to the sun than Venus, and though perhaps not “scorched i.” is en-
veloped in light and without seasons.
On our own fair world we can stand on some eminence from which miles of sur-
rounding country can be seen, and looking upon woods, forests, farmsteads, cornfields,
and gardens, as the sun shines upon them from the bine heavens above, we might sup-
pose that an angel would hover with delight above such a picturesque scene. But our
world will be yet more beautiful when vice and death are abolished.
NIMROD, THE HUNTER.
Nimrod was the son of Cush, whose father was Ham, the second son of Noah, and
brother of Shem. As Shem had a son (Arphaxed) born two years after the Flood, it is
right to think that Ham also began to have sons about the same time, in 1658. Thus,
Cush born in the year... 1658
After Cush was 20
Nimrod could be born in 1678 Though mentioned after his brothers, it seems to be
When Nimrod was 20 owing to the order of the narrative.
Nimrod was a hunter in 1693 and had 6 brothers and several cousins.
4 years more he would found Babylon, which at first
—— might be but an attractive homestead.
Fifty years after Flood 1702
68 years more Babylon was a populous city, attracting
—— residents like modern American cities.
Nimrod was 90 in ... 1770 Confusion of tongues.
2 years more.
First king in Babylon in 1772 was Sumu-abi, who was probably a son of Nimrod.
(See “ Kings of Babylon" from cuneiforms).
Nimrod would now be 92, if still alive, and during the above 68 years he founded
Erech, Accad, and Calneh, mentioned in Gen. x. 10, and also on cuneiform tablets dis-
covered in Babylonia. We know not in which of these places Nimrod ended his days;
but we have no evidence that other men than the patriarchs lived to a great age, indeed
the list of the 11 kings of the first dynasty of Babylon, obtained from a cuneiform tab-
let, shows that their lives were within the span of 120 years. The Biblical records are
confirmed by the first king beginning in 1772, and also by the record of 1903 years of
eclipses shown to Alexander the Great, when he conquered Babylon in 3672, which the
priests said were records from the commencement of the kingdom. The date of the
Dispersion after the Confusion of Tongues is now one of the best established facts of
history, viz. by Biblical records, astronomical phenomena, and cuneiform tablets.
The above Sumu-abi is the first man mentioned in profane history.


SABBATIC OR SEVENTH YEARS.
GREAT CHRONOLOGICAL TRIUMPHS.
CREATION YEAR ABSOLUTELY PROVED BY SEVENTH YEARS.
END OP ALL CONTROVERSY.
POWERFUL APPLICATION OP THE METONIO CYCLE.
<<Six years thou shall sow thy field, and six years thou shall prune thy vineyard, and
gather in the fruit thereof; but the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the
land, thou shall neither sow thy field nor prune thy vineyard.” Levit. xxv. 3,4.
The Hebrews divided the a.m. year straight from Creation in order to obtain their
seventh or Sabbatic years, and as we find that they were also the seventh years of all
the astronomical lines of time by planetary motion—whether from eclipses, transits,
solar cycles, and the Metonic cycle,—it is plain that the Biblical line of years is abso-
lutely correct, and we may remark that if the men who state that “ much of Scripture
history is legendary and its years and time erroneous,” would supply proofs of their
idle assertions, they might save their reputation and avoid ridicule.
Seventh years are obtained from four sources. 1. Biblical statements. 2. History of
the Maccabees, the dates of the months and days of the week being a continuation of
the Hebrew solar cycle. 3. The writings of Josephus. 4. By all the astronomical tables.
But there are really five of the latter and the testimony of each is independent.
HOW IS THE WOEK DOSE?
A simple tale is soon told. We could prove no seventh years unless the chain of time
by which they are produced starts from Creation year, as will be seen by the fact that
we can divide nothing unless we have a number greater than the divisor. The divisor
in the case in question is 7. But where is the number ? It is the number of years from
Creation in respect to Biblical seventh years, for example the year when the Israelites
left Egypt was 2513, and it was a Sabbatic year. Divide the number 2513 by 7 and
there is nothing over. This is the proof of Creation year, because we could not have
2513 without it. It is also the proof of the exodus year. It is more. This 2513 must
also be a seventh year from all subsequent seventh years, though they are recorded as such
nearly two thousand years afterwards. It must be more than all this. The year 2513
of Scripture must be 2513 of each of the astronomical lines of time and a seventh of all
of them. These arrange themselves into sevens, for not only can there be no so ar cycle
of the revolutions of the earth without seventh years, the eclipse cycle begins afresh after
seven cycles, each of 649 natural years, have transpired, each cycle beginning with
one of the days of the week consecutively, and therefore can be separately identified.
The subject in question is yet far from being exhausted. This 2513 must be from a
year which was marked by various physical evidences that its initial year was 1. It
must not start anywhere. It must be a year when the solar and lunar years began to.
gather. It must also be when the sun was on the equinoctial colnre, »o that the great
autumnal equinox was “ the fourth day” of the solar year, producing equal day and
night all over the world. It must be a year physically marked by the two nodes of the
moon being in the centre of that year. It must he a year when the positions of the
earth and the moon correspond in their respective orbits, otherwise the eclipses would
not take place at the dates we see them occur. All these astronomical and' geometrical
phenomena must characterise the first year of 2513, otherwise it could not bo a seventh
year from Creation or a seventh from all other Sabbatical years.
The following are seventh years recorded in history:—
2562 Year following Joshua’s division of laud. Joshua xxi. 43, 44,
2912 When Saul “ had reigned two years.” 1 Sam. xiii. 1.
3297 Sennacherib overthrown. 2 Kings xix. 29,
3416 Nebuchadnezzar burnt the city. Jer. xxxiv.
3522 “ The seventh year.” 1 Maccabees vi. 49, and 53.
3850 Simon slain. 1 Mao. xvi. 16. (Josephus).
3962 Siege of Jerusalem by Herod. (Do.)
The Metonic cycle, which for its importance was inscribed by the Grecians in let-
ters of gold, starts from Creation. It is a period of ig years, and as the Antediluvian
solar cycle is formed of 7 years, the two square in 133 years (7 times 19). This all-
powerful table is printed in “ All Past Time,” having a • against every 133rd year to
show that it is a 7th by the Metonic cycle from Creation, such year being of the same
form, that is, beginning with Sunday. Accordingly, we find that by the Metonic
Cycle, when the first seven lunar years of the Antediluvians are brought down by 133
years to Sunday, Sept. 20th, 1846, to Saturday, July 17th, 1852, both inclusive,
that the moon in this period was new on the same days of the week as in the first
seven years following Creation I When will men cease to slander Scripture ?
K


We hare thus seven references to Sabbatic years, and as some persons are unacquainted
with the determination of years by solar cycles, eclipses, and transits, they can use the
simple cycle of Sabbatic years, and obtain the same results.
1 particularly mention this because there is, or was, a very small section of chrono-
logists, so-called, who allege that Usher's chronology was erroneous, and that “ twe
gaps” in the history recorded in the Book of Judges had not been accounted for. One
of these gentlemen wrote to me saying he did not understand the application of
astronomy to years of history, but his investigations showed him that the years laid
down by the British Chronological and Astronomical Association were not correct. I,
and others, patiently examined his system, but always saw his errors, just as a banker
weighing his gold knows what number of sovereigns he has delivered for a cheque pre-
sented at his counter. To convince this querist, however, I worked out the above
simple Sabbatic cycle, which, without the use of astronomy, is conclusive to every
intelligent and humble mind.
It appears from the foregoing instances that the Sabbatic Cycle observed by the Jews
was the same as the Hebdomatic Cycle of seven years from Creation, and consequently
is a grand means of determining the first year of the world, though we have other un-
questionable means of knowing this, such as the Solar Cycle of the Antediluvian years,
which cannot be mistaken. It might be expected that as the Jews were commanded to
“remember the Sabbath Day,” so would the years of “Best” come from the same ex-
emplary principle.—
With all these means of determining the precise years of the world, no man can
question the accuracy of the computation without proclaiming his ignorance of common
things, as well as his want of understanding the transits of Mercury and Venus. I have
always marvelled that men, though learned on other subjects, and even eminent in some
of the sciences, should challenge the Biblical record of Creation, when they know
nothing about astronomical chronology. Ignorance is always the parent of error and
superstition, but it is remarkable that a man like Darwin should have propounded
theories which will not stand a moment before the facts obtained from a rigid scientific
investigation of time; and let it be observed, these investigations are as simple as they
are correct. All that has to done in proving years is to see how they divide by 7. They
should do this from Creation,

EZEKIEL’S DATES.
Ezekiel uses the Captivity years for his dates. They all commenced with the 7th civil
month of the common year, and therefore the captivity years were half on one civil year
and half on another. He begins with the sth year of the captivity which was the last six
months of table i and first six of table j of the Ancient Hebrew Solar Cycle. It is very
interesting to read the dates of Ezekiel in the Bible aud look at them on the Cycle, because
they prove the a.m. years; the cycle being formed of 15 years, must always begin its first
years (table a) alternately with a number ending with 2 or 7, for example 3402, 3417.
The 8.0. year given below is the correct one from 3996. The Bible margin is from 4004.
* The 890 days for Israel and the 40 for Judah (total 430, which amount to the same
number as years of the sojourn iu Egypt, a day representing a year,) Ezekiel It. 5,6, were
now accomplished, and the prophet was seated in his house. 8
+ Sunday because it was the “ same day” that “ the king of Babylon set himself against
Jerusalem.” (2 Kings xxv. 1. and Jer. lii. 4).
X Sabbath because the prophecy was a judgment pronounced on Pharaoh for his great
treachery towards Israel.
i The beginning of the year,” evidently refers to the first sacred month, 3430, table n,
and the reason why Thursday is the day is, because the angel had to perform secular work
by measuring the city, otherwise the vision would have been on Sabbath Day. By
the term “ selfsame day,” pointed allusion is made to the fact that the date of the
month was the same as when the city was smitten fourteen years ago, viz. on 10th of
the 4th sacred month, table 0., 3416.
It is interesting to notice the exaltation given to the Sabbath Day by the Divine com-
munications to Ezekiel when they concern Israel. The list compares well with the nine
dates of Noah on Sabbath Days in his diary of the Flood. We also see that the Solar Cycle
of the Ancient Hebrews was never broken up. as ours is. As such it is a valuable table of
history and astronomical science and ought to be in every school aud priuted iu the Bible.
THE SCIENTIFIC CHARACTERJ3 F EZEKIEL’S DATES.
1— There were in Ezekiel’s time—34lo to 3441—just 354 days in a lunar year, as now.
2 As a lunar year begins when the moon is new and an eclipse of the sun cannot taka
place unless the moon is new, or an eclipse of the moon except the moon be full, there was
precisely the same time between eclipses iu Ezekiel’s time as now.
3 Hence the moon and the earth had the same orbits as now, and accomplished their
revolutions in the same time; and as Ezekiel’s years were the same length as during the
Flood period and year 0, there has been no variation of the motions of the earth and the
moon since the institution of time at Creation period.
It is the “ selfsame” days of the week falling on the same dates of the month which
determine these grand facts, and thus although there are no eclipses mentioned in Biblical
history, yet the dates given supply us easily with them all, and when taken from the point
of time known as Creation, they fall correctly on every recorded eclipse and accurately
roach those we now witness. This is exceedingly interesting aud conclusively proves that
scripture history is astronomical time of unquestionable precision.

PROUD BABYLON FALLS.
THE SECOND TEMPLE IS BUILT AND PROPHECIES FULFILLED.
The history written in the Book of Ezra is a marvellous record of astronomical time
and possesses an imperishable interest all its own. Babylon—the haughty city built by
Nebuchadnezzar, whose troops held Assyria and all the world in subjection—fell before
the sword of Cyrus in 3466 J whilst Belshazzar, the king, was feasting with a thousand
of his lords and drinking wine out of the golden and silver vessels brought from Jeru-
salem. In that night, yea, “in the same hour," came forth a mysterious hand which
wrote upon the wall, “ Thy kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians.”
The Book of Ezra commences with the Ist year of Cyrus, 3468, which is a continua-
tion of 2nd Chron., and it was not till 75 years after the end of the first captivity in
that year, and the subsequent completion of the building of the second temple, that Ezra
followed those who had returned to Jerusalem in the Ist year of Cyrus. Ezra went up
in the 7th year of Artaxerxes, (3543 J) with some of the priests and singers, (vii. 6)
There were two captivities. The first began early in 3398, when Nebuchadnezzar car-
tied Daniel and his companions, and the costly vessels of the Temple to Babylon, and
the second began in 3406 J, eight years later, when he exported the youthful king Jehoi-
achin and all the chief people. Both captivities were 70 years, endiug in 3468 and 3476 J.
The following will show the consecutive order of the events referred to :

The 7th of Artaxerxes, 3543-4, is the starting point of Daniel’s 70 Weeks.
* The Jews had been waiting for the civil year. Temple finished 20 years afterwards.
EZRA’S FIRST SABBATH IN JERUSALEM.
+ On arriving at Jerusalem, Ezra and his company assembled three days afterwards,
with the resident Jews, in the new Temple on the 20th day of the 9lh month, which
the solar cycle shows was Saturday (Sabbath), but the gold and silver were not weighed
till the fourth day, as such work on the Sabbath would be a desecration.
J This date shows that the “52 days ” of building the walls began on Tuesday, the 4th
Of the sth Bacred month. We never find anything Eeceular done on the Sabbath.
AN IMPORTANT AND USEFUL DATE OVERLOOKED.
\ A splendid and valuable date. The margin is the best interpretation showing that
the 32nd year of Artaxerxes was an intercalary one, and therefore the 20th was also one
of the same character. Both were 3rd years,/and eon the solar cycle. This ends all
argument as to what year was the king’s 20th so that the method of proving the cruci-
fixion by Daniel’s 70 weeks is complete.

DATES OF ZECHARIAH AND HAGGAI.
The prophets Zechariah and Haggai with stirring words encouraged Zerubbahel and
the high priest, Jeshua, in building the second Temple.
DATES OF ESTHER.
The period of the book of Queen Esther was about 48 years after the end of the great
captivity and nearly 20 before Ezra went up to Jerusalem. All the Jews did not return
to their own country when the period of their captivity expired, which was 10 years
after the fall of Babylon, but their history in Persia was of a marked character.
A BRIGHT CONSTELLATION OF DATES.
* This date is remarkable for being the same sacred period, and just 472 solar years
before the birth of Christ in the year 3996, as Nehemiah’s commission in 3557 was 472
years before the crucifixion. Esther’s date of her exaltation has thus a connection :
1. with the offering up of Isaac.—2, with Daniel’s 70 weeks (3454, or part of 7th of Arta-
xerxes, and 472 reach the Lord’s baptism and commencement of his covenant with the
Jews in 4026). —3, with Nehemia’s commission, which is the lunar period.—and 4, with
the splendid date of Ezekiel iv. 5, 6. We have here again a galaxy of stars of the first
magnitude. But Chronological Astronomy, like Nautical Astronomy, is a system of
measurement and is rich in all such work, and teems with examples showing that
although the books of Scripture were written at periods far apart, yet, like the orbs of
heaven, they are members of the same firmament and have but one Author.
HOW A MALICIOUS DEVICE WAS OVERRULED.
1 The first decree (verse 12) was mede on the 13th day of the Ist month, 3529|, to
destroy the Jews, young and old, women and children, on the 13th day of the 12th
month, 3530 J, just one year afterwards—the period was thus the last half of the year
marked hon the solar cycle and the first half of i. The dates fit no other period.
According to the laws of the Medes and Persians the decree could not be withdrawn,
hut by singular circumstances, Esther, the beautiful Jewess, had become Queen, and
was in high favour with the king, who made a second and independent decree on the
23rd of the 3rd month—three months later—giving the Jews the opportunity to stand
up in defence of their own lives on the day in which they were to bo destroyed, and
also to slay all those who would assault them. Accordingly when the day arrived in
which both decrees could take effect, no man dared to touch the Jews, but owing to the
fear of what had befallen Hainan, whose tragic death they regarded as typical of their
own, they did not so much as breathe a word against the heaven-protected race ; and
so it proved, the impending sword fell upon them on the day when they expected to
see the Jews destroyed. With surpiising heroism, the Hebrews slew 5l!0 Persians in
their own city, and 75,000 others fell in the provinces. The event is unparalleled in
history and may yet be repeated within the life-span of present generations.

The dates in Acts show that the two years lived by St. Paul in his own hired house
in Rome were from 4059 J to 4061 J, therefore his epistles written there must be within
that period. He could not have a hearing before Nero owing to the Emperor's lengthy
absence on a musical tour round Greece and soon afterwards the great, fire occurred by
which the Apostle was burnt out. The short hearing stood adjourned for about a year
and St Paul wintered in Necapolis, (Titus iii. 12). When he returned the Jews had re-
volted and he suffered martyrdom through malice in June 40G3. As Babylon was not
then subject to Rome, Peter went there and from thence wrote his 2ud epistle, and in-
structed Mark in writing a gospel. 2 Peter iii. 15 alludes to St. Paul’s death (See Greek).
EXACT YEAR WHEN ALEXANDER ENTERED BABYLON.
We now obtain the exact year when Alexander the Great entered Babylon by the years
in the Books of Maccabees. The history in these bocks is of the same pure astronomical
character as that in the canon of Scripture, and dates from the Ancient Hebrew Solar
Cycle. The years are called “ Years of the Kingdom of Greece.’’ commencing with 3672
A.M., when Alexander finally subdued Darius Condomanus and entered Babylon.
The following is the proof. In 1 Mace. i. 10, “ the 137th year” is 3809, table cof the
Solar Cycle, and verse 20, “the 143rd year,” is 3815 f. which the cycle shows was an in-
tercalary year. This is confirmed by verse 29 which speaks of “ two full years.” This
is one of the ordinary intercalary expressions, meaning a full lunar and full solar year.
There are other proofs. In 1 Macc. vi. 20, we read of “ the 150th year.” Add this to
the above 3672 and the product is 3822, which is stated to have been a seventh or
Sabbatic Year. Divide 3822 by 7 and there is nothing oyer.
THE TIME WHEN HEROD THE GREAT DIED.
All argument respecting the time when Herod the Great died is settled by the eclipse
of the moon (in 3988), whica Josephus says occurred during the rage of Herod a few
weeks before he died. From the same historian we also learn that Herod was buried
about six or seven weeks before the Passover at the end of March. On looking at the
Triple Eclipse Table, we see that the nearest year to 3998 when the team of 70 eclipses
began was 3984, which would be Line I. Add 14 more lines or years, and we have Line
XV. for year 3998. Here on the Hebrew Bird’s Eye View of Eclipses we have the
total eclipse 9 of the moon in the middle of the second month (end of our November).
Hence Herod died about the end of January, the 4th month of 3998. Besides this, we
know that the infanta were slain by Herod in Bethlehem when our Lord, who was bom
in 89965, was 2 years old, nearly the end of December, Herod therefore must have
died about the cud of January, the 4th month of 3998.


INTERCALARY PERIODS OF
SCRIPTURE.
It will be E-een by the Ancient Hebrew Solar Cycle that the intercalary', or extra
34'days, occurred at the end of every third year. They are therefore often as
useful as an eclipse in determining the actual year when an event occurred.
The expressions used in referring to them in Scripture are “The end of days,”
after “ certain days,” “ after two full years.”


The intercalary, or extra days of scripture history, employed to lengthen the short
lunar years to the solar period of 3G5 days, were 77 days at the end of each solar cycle of
seren lunar years during the continuance of the Antediluvian cycle, as will be seen by
the fact that 7 times II are 77, the lunar year being 11 days shorter than the solar. But
when the Ancient Hebrew solar cycle of 15 years came into use in the time of Heber,
beginning with the year 1722, the intercalary,period comprised 34 days at the end of
each third year. As this cycle continued to the end of New Testament history and is a
splendid measure of astronomical time, it is allowed by chronologists to continue be-
cause it forms and continues the Anno Mundi years. That these intercalary periods
were always employed, and with remarkable scientific precision, is proved by the appli-
cation of the lunar cycle test. So that when some other adjustment was required by the
accumulation of fractional excess or loss or time, an extra week was taken or thrown off
at the end of the middle intercalary period (table i.) of the Ancient Hebrew Solar Cycle,
arising from the necessity of using there 35 instead of 34 days.
The modern Jews, owing to the loss of the Ancient Solar Cycle, and the subsequent
adoption of others, one after the other, have greatly erred by using their intercalary
days in the middle of the civil year, which is the end of their sacred year. That this is
an error is very plain from the reference to them in Jeremiah xxvii, also Elijah at the
brook. But modern Jews observe the same number of intercalary days after three years.
The phraseology of scriptural language, referring to intercalary periods, is varied, such
as “At the end of days.” “After two years fully expired.” “At the return of the year.”
“ When days were multiplied.” “In process of time, after the end of two years. ” But
the variations are often the result of ignorance of the chronological reference and have
in two instances led to amusing mistranslations, particulary concerning a supposed two
years’ imprisonment of St. Paul.
The occurrence of references to intercalary periods in scripture history are of great
value, and are sometimes as good as an eclipse. By them we obtain means for proving
exact years of events and the continued verification of the chain and system of time.
The following are examples, and classical readers should refer to the original text; —
THE DEATH OF ABEL.
Gen. iv. 8. intercalary days of year 125, a.m. or 3871 8.0., given us as the death of Abel.
The margin is the best and ought to form the English text. It would have done so
had the translators had the assistance of a scientific chronologist. By this date we
learn that Abel was slain at the end of the intercalary days, and as Seth was born in
the year 130, the preceding intercalary period, which the observance of the twelve
other dates of the Antediluvian age shows to have been placed at the end of each
7lh year, was necessarily 125. That this expression docs not refer to the end of the
year is plain because the word “ days,” and not year is mentioned either in the Greek
Septuagint or the Hebrew. Nor could it do so, as the year had expired ten weeks
previously, and there would be no fruits to form “ an offering unto the Lord” until “ the
end” of the intercalary “days.” The literal Hebrew denotes “And it was in the end
of days.” The Greek is equally clear “ And it came to pass in the days of the years’
and.” Neither is there any mention of week. It is a pure calendar expression like
our Whitsuntide, or, more correctly, Christmas. Therefore the suggestion that it de-
notes a Sabbath day is erroneous. Writers who have seized upon this passage with a
view of proving the observance of the Sabbath should have known that there are
actually thousands of indisputable evidences of the continued observance of the regular
seventh day without straining after this. For instance there is no such a thing as a
solar cycle unless unbroken weeks of seven days are kept. Dates cannot come round
again upon the same day of the week without keeping time in weeks, still more im-
possible would be the occurrence of “ selfsame days” occurring after long periods of
years. A man had better try to square 20 shillings to a pound, when his shillings are
composed sometimes of lid or 13d, as try to form a solar cycle having one week in a
10,000 years short of a day or longer. If two of the dates of the Antediluvian period
showed the existence of a solar cycle they would be sufficient to prove the continued
observance of weeks of seven days; but every date of the series proves it, and the years
obtained by the revolution of the cycle are ratified by the progression of eclipses. „ Oh!
how ignorant have men been about the science of chronology. The passage in ques-
tion is precisely the same as the allusion to another intercalary period when Elijah
was at the brook in 3098 (See 1 Kings xvii. 7.) For some reason, ever since Cain ob-
tained a repreive in the intercalary period toleration has been claimed, and judges did
not sit.
INTERCALARY PERIODS OF SCRIPTURE.


Gen. xxxviii, 12. Death of Judah’s wife in the intercalary days of 2294, on solar cycle
table c., being 1702 before Christ. Here again the margin is the proper reading, viz.
“When the days were multiplied,” that is by taking up intercalary days. There is
nothing in the margin to warrant the words supplied by translators, “ And in process
of time.” It is, as in several other places, an invention and hides the historical evi-
dence of the genuineness of scripture.
DATE OT PHABAOH’S DREAM,
Gen. xli. 1. This is the plain record of the date of Pharaoh’s dream in or just after the
intercalary days of 2288, table I. of the Ancient Hebrew Solar Cycle, which was 1708
before Christ who was born in 3995. The Greek Septuagint is, “It came to pass with-
in (or after) two years of days.” It is the same as Acts xxiv. 27. which most errone-
ously has led to the belief that Paul was imprisoned two years, though a Koman, with-
out having a hearing, The words by no means denotes the lapse of two years of time.
As the intercalary days were taken up at the end of each third year to bring the short
lunar years abreast with the solar period, the first of the triple series would run on
with the solar year, but the “ two” forming the second and third would increasingly
get behind and therefore require to be made “full’’ by adding or “ muti plying” days.
This seems to be the meaning of the chronological expression : or it may be taken as
referring to the time when there were “two full years” a full lunar and solar year.
Which ever way we take this peculiar expression, it only occurs at the intercalary
period. Fortunately for us, we now clearlyfind by Egyptian monumental bistory that
Thothmes 111. was the Pharaoh referred to (See Pharaohs of Scripture and Egyptian
Dynasties), and that he had just ascended the throne when he had this dream. The
meaning therefore of the words of the text is not that Joseph was two years in prison
after Thothmes 11. had hanged the baker, but that the date of the dream was the inter-
calary days of 2288, a. m. J oseph was apparently about a year in prison after the chief
butler was restored to favour by Thothmes 11. who had only a short reign of six years,
and it is evident that the Pharaoh addressed by the butler (Gen. xli, 13.) could not
be the monarch who hanged the baker. The royal dreamer reigned 34 years. It is
interesting to see how recently discovered monumental history confirms scripture, and
it is very gratifying that Biblical records enable us to thread together the Egyptian
Dynasties and assign to them their true place in history measured off by five astron-
omical lines of time. But 0 what rubbish has been used by theorising men in their
attempts to spoil the lines and records of antiquity!
ELIJAH AT THE BROOK.
1 Kings xvii. 7. Here we have an allusion to the intercalary days at the end of the
year 3098, A.M., which was 898 before Christ. The subject is Elijah at the Brook,
and the margin of the narrative is the correct reading. The Hebrew expression is
precisely the same as that recording the date of Cain slaying Abel, “at the end of
days.” Though the intercalary periods were not the same—that concerning Elijah
being the shorter number of days at the end of every third year of the Ancient Hebrew
Solar Cycle, (tablet.) and that referring to Abel being the 77 days at the end of the
Antediluvian Solar Cycle of seven years—yet there is no variation of phrasiology. By
references of this kind we have the splendid advantage of finding the true year. The
chronology shows us that Elijah was about six months at the brook Cherith, being
there fed by ravens, and when the water dried up in the intercalary days which fell
always in the hot season, (during Sept.) he went to dwell at the house of a widow at
Zarephta, and in the middle of the “third year” afterwards, presented himself to
Ahab, when fire came down from heaven and subsequently much rain. The duration
of the drought seems to have been the typical period of 1250 days.
I Citron, xx. 1. The siege of llabbah. “ The return of the year” is an allusion to the
expiration of the intercalary days of year 2909, table c. This will be obvious by com-
paring the passage with other events in 1. Kings xx. 22 and 26. See also 2 Sam. xi. 1.
These references to intercalary periods enable us to fix the true year of events.
1 Kings xx. 22 and 26. Syrians fighting against Ahab after the intercalary period at
end of year 3104, table c. This is a very clear reference.
2 Chron. xviii. 2. See margin. End of 3107, table /., and exactly three years after
the events of 1 Kings xx. 22, 26. Beautiful astronomical time. Jehosaphat’a affinity
with Ahab, by which we obtain the year of the death of the latter, early in 3108, and
this settles an event in As yrian history. 9
1 Bam. i. 20. Birth of Samuel in intercalary days at the end of year 2852. table f. He
died in the intercalary days of 2948. aged 95. See feast 1 Sam. xxy, 1, 2, Ac.
INTERCALARY PERIODS OB’ SCRIPTURE.


2 Chron. xxiv. 23. Joash spoiled by the Syrians in the intercalary days of the year
3164, table c. of the Ancient Hebrew Solar Cycle. The margin is the true Hebrew
reading.
2 Chron. xxi. 19. Infamous death of King Jehoram in the intercalary days at the end
of year 3119, table c. In this passage the intercalary period is clearly expressed.
Jer. xxviii. 3. Death of the false prophet Hananiah. By verse 1. of this chapter we
learn that the false prophecy was spoken in the sth sacred month (the 11th civil) of
the 4th year of Zcdikiah, viz., 3410, table i. and the time which this wicked prophet
set for the fulfilment of his words was the intercalary period of the same year, “ Within
two years of days,” as the margin states. That would be from the time be spoke in
the 11th civil month, rather less than three months. In the seventh month, which was
the first civil month of the year 3411, Jeremiah said to him “Thisyear thou shalt
die,’’ (i.c. this same sacred year). “So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in
the seventh month ” (Chap, xxviii. 17). He died within four months of the utterance
of his prophecy, and probably but a few days after Jeremiah delivered the warning.
The whole record is very valuable to chronologists, inasmuch as it proves that the in-
tercalary days were placed at the end of the civil year, and not at the termination of
the sacred year, where the Jews now place them, viz. at end of the 12th sacred
month.
Amos iv- 4. This is the last allusion in the Old Testament to intercalary days, viz. at
the end of the year 3218 table 1, “ The feast of ingathering ” of the fruits of the earth
was necessarily “at the end of the year,” as we read Ex. xxiii. 16. The end of the
Hebrew year, which is the true historical year, answers to our September. Grapes and
other fruit are then ripe and fit for gathering, but at no other season. A careful notice
of the intercalary periods about the end of our September, shows that there was a
special feast at the end of every third or intercalary year, and in the passage in ques-
tion (Amos iv. 4.) we have the words “ after three years,” and in the margin “ three
years of days,” or more correctly in English phrase, the days at the end of three
years. In Ex. xxx. 22. we also read of “ the feast of ingathering at the year’s end’ ’
with a marginal reading of “revolution of the year.’’ We have therefore in Amos iv.
4. another explicit statement respecting the period and season of the intercalary
days.
CONVEESIOH OF ST. PAUL.
Acts ix. 19. Conversion of St. Paul, just before or in the intercalary days at the end of
the year 4034, a.m., table c, which was three months before 36 a.d. began, reckoning
from 3996 when our Lord was born. We read that when St. Paul was baptised he “was
certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus.’’ Then we read, verse 23,
“And after that many days were fulfilled the Jews took counsel to kill him.” This is
a reference to the intercalary days, but not expressed in the same way as in the Old
Testament, because the Book of Acts was written not only for Jews but also Gentiles
who kept solar time according to the Roman year which we use. St. Luke begins his
history of St. Paul with the intercalary period of table o, the last year of the Ancient
Hebrew Solar Cycle, year 4031, and ends it on the same table, after a period of 30
years, viz. in 4061, a fact which partly explains his rather abrupt termination of the
Apostle’s ministry. St. Luke indeed was a good chronologist and his numerous
references to periods and dates of the Ancient Hebrew Solar Cycle are very interesting
and form a remarkable proof of the genuineness of his writings. But to see them
properly, his gospel and Book of Acts should be read in Greek. From the 20th chapter
of Acts to the end of the book, his dates are numerous and it is a great pity that our
translators have not understood them.
Acts xxv. i. begins the intercalary period at the end of 4058 table I. In these same days
St. Paul sailed in the ship in which he was wrecked. See table of his journey from
Greece through Macedonia to Palestine and continue by reading the notes in the fol-
lowing page. In the 7th verse of chap, xxvii. the ship was sailing slowly in the in-
tercalary days, and in the 10th verse there is a reference to the “ fast ’’ on the 10th of
the Ist civil month of the next year, which was the “ day of atonement” on the 10th
of the 7th sacred month, commanded to be obterved in Lev. xxiii. 27. 29. It is plain
by the mention of this fast on the 10th day of the first month of the new civil year, that
the intercalary days were just over. The period therefore during which St. Paul was
left bound in charge of the centurion, but having liberty, was about four months, not
“ two years,” which is merely a reference to the two years requiring intercalary days.
INTERCALARY PERIODS OF SCRIPTURE.


1. Maccabees i. 29. The dates Id the Books of Maccabees are from the Solar Cycle of the
Ancient Hebrews, and are therefore astronomical like those of the canon of Scripture.
The passage In question is a reference to the intercalary period of 3815, which was the
143rd year (verse 20) of Greece, The importance of the date is that it gives us the
year of the final victory of Alexander the Great over Darius Condimanus as 3672. By
deducting 143 from 3815 we have 3672. The solar cycle shows that 3815 was inter-
calary, table i. Having got this 143rd year on the solar cycle we have all the others,
such as the setting up of the abomination, and the 7th year of vi. 53.
DANIEL AND THE KING’S MEAT,
Dan. i. 5. This passage is one of the most ludicrous errors of our translators and its con-
tiuuance in all versions, as well as comments and pulpit allusions, shows what dark-
ness and error exist in the minds of professors in our colleges, when they know nothing
about the measurement of time by which history is placed on a natural and scientific
basis. The reference is to the 34 intercalary days at the end of three years, which at
this juncture was 3398, when Nebuchadnezzar began to reign, table I. This is plain
from ii. 1, but it would be manifest folly to place three growing lads (Daniel was 17)
under a dietary regimen extending over three years, in order to find out what flesh
they had gained. In the natural coarse of three years they would become bearded
men. It was a diet of one month at the end of three years to which they were put.
Exodus ii. 23. Here again the words, “in process of time,” are no part of the original.
The reading is, ‘After those many days, the king of Egypt died,” namely, Ramses 11.,
the great oppressor of the children of Israel. It is a similar phrase to that in Luke
ii. 1. and alludes to the intercalary period of 2507, which completed the 400 years
during which “ the seed’’ of Abraham were to be in subjection (See the words Gen. xv
13.) consequently the prophecy did not begin till Isaac was born in 2103. It has been
usual to consider these 400 years as the same “in round numbers,’’ as the period of
the sojourn, which was 430 years. But they are two distinct periods, each haying a
fulfilment remarkable for their precision. Loose expressions, such as round numbers,
have no place in the Bible 1 The 430 years of sojourn began with Abraham leaving
the city of Ur, on Tuesday, 15th of 7th civil month, 2082), and thus ended on the same
day of the week and tame date of the month, Tuesday, 15lh of the 7th civil month,
2513). See tables a and I. The 400 could not begin till Sarah had a son,
THE TEN TRIBES CARRIED AWAY.
2 Kings sviii. 10. This “ end of three years” was 3284, the 3rd of the solar cycle, which
was the usual intercalary year. The Assyrians were not three years besieging Samaria,
but it fell at the end of a triple set of years. Shalmaneser IV. began the siege, but
died before it ended, and was succeeded by Sargon IL Ptolemy toils us that there
were two total eclipses of the moon, seen in Babylon, during this time. These and a
transit of the planet Mercury in 3281, enable us to fix the year.
ANOTHER MISTRANSLATION.
Luke ix. 51. Translators and commentators have been much puzzled about this verse,
and for want of proper knowledge—which the revisors refused to accept—the passage
remains, to add to the list of mis-translation?, one of the greatest errors in the Revised
Version. It was not our Lord that was taken up, but the intercalary days at the end
of the year 4028, in order to lengthen lunar to solar time. See the Greek, which reads
“ And it came to pass, when the days were fully completed that were taken up, he set
his face steadfastly towards Jerusalem.” He was not crucified till six ai d half
months later, and after this it was 40 days before he ascended. X will fairly admit
that one word has been tampered with in the Greek, showing that the copyist has not
understood the passage, but it is of such a small character that it does not preclude the
meaning of the original text. Of course this passage is very useful inasmuch as it
proves that the year which followed was 4029 when out Lord was crucified. I mean
4029 from Creation, all the 7th years of which are also the 7th years of all planetary
motion, whether obtained by the transits of Mercury or Venus, or those derived from
the eclipse line of time with which mortal man cannot interfere.
There are a few other intercalary periods in Scripture, such as the death of Shimei, upon
whose guilty head the sword fell more swiftly than our translators have represented in
1 Kings ii. 36—46. The words, “at the end of three year?,’’ do not mean after three
years. They refer to the end of that year, 2990, when Solomon began to reign, and
which will be seen by table i, was the completion of a triple series of years.
Before leaving the intercalary subject, I should say that this period is represented
in Scripture by several different expressions; but this shows that when the Bible was
translated into Greek, the 70 translators were divided into companies sitting apart.
INTERCALARY PERIODS OF SCRIPTURE.


Gen. zzzi. 22. Jacob’s flight from Laban, intercalary days, 2264, table c. The weight of
evidence in proof of Jacob’s fleeing in the intercalary days is in the character of “the
third day.’’ That it was Sabbath day when Laban was informed of what had occur-
red appears from the following reasons. Ist that he pursued after Jacob seven days.
He would not journey on the Sabbath day. He was a worshipper of God. Hence
the 3rd day was the Sabbath day and the 3rd of the Ist month of the new civil year
as the solar cycle shows. 2nd. As Laban was at a distance (verse 19) shearing his sheep
it was when he returned for Sabbath ordinances and met with some of his servants
from the region where Jacob had been located, that he was told that Jacob had fled.
3rd. Unless there had been intercalary days the same week, Sabbath day would not
have fallen on the 3rd day. But beyond even these evidences we know that Jacob fled
at the end of the year 2264, which was an intercalary year. The “gods " which Rachael
carried off were probably image calendars.
Judges zix- i. Events connected with a civil war in Israel. The verse refers to the inter-
calary days at the end of the year 2597, table/! The “four whole months ’’ include
the first four months of 2598, table g. (see verse 2. and margin) In the 4th verse the
“ three days ” are the first three of the fifth civil month. The “ fourth day ’’ was 4th
of the month and also the fourth day of the week, Wednesday. Verse 8. mentions the
sth day, Thursday. The Levite would not tarry longer as he wished to be in the House
of the Lord on the 7th (Saturday.) The 6th day is mentioned in verse 27., and the
gathering together on the first Sabbath of the new civil year at Mizpeh, is the meaning
of the Ist verse of the next chapter. The two foregoing intercalary references are im-
portant in fixing events during the period of the Book of Judges.
Judges xi. 4. War between Ammonite and Israel in the intercalary days of 2852, table /.
The margin “after days,’’ bnt more correctly within days, is the intercalary ex-
pression.
I Samuel xxv. 2. Nabal’s feast. Intercalary days of 2949, table i. The servants of David
had rendered great service to the churlish Nabal whilst shearing his sheep and celebrat-
ing the “feast of ingathering at the end of the year,’’ after which David’s servants call-
ed upon Nabal on New Year’s Day for a sift (See verse 8). On the latter part of the
same day (verse 36) Nabal was drunk. The “ feast of ingathering ” was in accord-
ance with the Divine command. See Ex. zxxiv. 22. foryear's end or revolution of the
year (margin) showing that the year had turned, or “after three years ’’in Amos iv
4. Also Ex. zxiii. 16. where this feast is more expressly stated.
2. Samuel xiii. 23. Absalom’s feast, in the intercalary days of 2948, table I. Here is re-
corded the old intercalary expression “ two full years,’’ and in connection with sheep
shearing.
Nehemiah xiii. 6. Nehemiah obtained leave of Artaxerxes, King of Babylon, to return
to Jerusalem in the intercalary days at the end of 3569, table c. of the Ancient
Hebrew Solar Cycle. The marginal reference distinctly states that it was in the inter-
calary days, and it should be noticed that the settlement of the true year of this event
is one of great importance concerning the building of the walls of Jerusalem. It was
the “32nd year” of Artaxerxes Longimanus, as the verse states; consequently the
“20th year ” of this King, which is a point of great importance in connection with
chap. v. 14., must be the year 3557, table/, another intercalary year, indeed that from
which Daniel’s 69i weeks are dated. 69J weeks are 486 i lunar years, or 472 solar
years. Add 472 to 3557 and we have 4029, when Christ, was crucified.
BIRTH OF JESUS CHRIST.
Luke u. I. Refers to the beginning of a third year after the intercalary days of table i.
in year 3995., from which we learn that our Lord was born in the end of the 3rd month
of 3990, about our Dec. 25th.

INTERCALARY PERIODS. ST. PAUL’S SHIPWRECK.
The following is a continuation of the tables setting forth the history of St. Paul’s
journey from Greece through Macedonia to Palestine, given elsewhere.
« Year 4058, a m., table L, three last months and the intercalary days.
The intercalary days ended at a time answering to the middle of our October, because
the third lunar year would run out about the 12th of our September. The 10th of the
new year—day of atonement, or “fast,’’ referred to in Acts xxvii. 9. would be about 25th
of our October : rough weather when sailing became “ dangerous.”
It is evident from the allusion to the “3rd ” and “ 10th,” two Sabbath days in which
there would be no travelling in Palestine—that the time indicated was the intercalary
days, a fact which is again confirmed by a reference to the 10th day of the Ist month
of the new civil year—“ the Fast.” There are certainly two Sabbath days on the 3rd
ami 10th of the Ist month two years later, but the 10th in chap. xxv. 6. cannot also be
the 10th in chap, xxvii-9 ; Besides this Roman history will not allow us to travel so
fast by throwing the dates into year 4060, which was 65 years after the birth of Christ.
In addition to this, the reference to the two full years so common in scripture for the in-
tercalary period, and the use of the Greek word “ikanais ” and "ikanm*-” unquestion-
ably settle the point. The sense of the word being “ sufficient ’’ and “ complete,” as in
the passage “Whose shoes I am not sufficient or worthy to unloose” See Mark i. 7. and
(Greek.) There is sometimes great violence done to scripture when the sense, which is
the guide to the correct translation of words of more than one meaning, is misunderstood.
The Apostle appears to have been shipwrecked at Malta on Friday, the 24th of the Ist
civil month, table m. The 14th night, including the fast, was Thursday nighty the
23rd, see verses 27 and 33. He wintered three months on the island, and after sailing
again, touched at Syracuse and Rhegium, and landed at Puteoli about the 6th of the 6th
month, tarrying with the brethren till the 13th (xxviii. 14). He resumed his journey on
lard, reaching Rome towards the end of the following week, the 18th.


THE TRANSIT INSTRUMENT.
Chronologists who wish to obtain accurate time should use Latimer Clark’s Patent
IWraueit Instrument, which has been so modified and improved that any person may
now by a single observation obtain time to almost any degree of accuracy, a knowledge
of astronomy being in no way essential to those who may not have studied that science.
The instrument is easily fixed and by the aid of Tables which are published annu-
ally, giving the time of transit of about Twenty Stars for each evening of the year, all
calculation of any kind is rendered unnecessary. The instrument finds its own stars
and corrects its own errors.
The great price of Transit Instruments hitherto, the difficulty of using them, and
the necessity of troublesome calculations, have prevented them from in any way be-
coming popular, although they are a necessary adjunct to every observatory.
Mr Latimer Clark has for many years given groat attention to the subject, and has
at length been able to produce an instrument of great precision and of very high qual-
ity at a price less than one third of those usually sold, and containing improvements
which facilitate the use of the instrument by those who have no knowledge whatever of
the subject. The instruments which are manufactured by Hr. Alfred Frost, of 6, West-
minster Chambers, Victoria Street, London, and cost from £7 10s to £l3 13s, have been
so well spoken of by the highest authorities that we recommend our readers who desire
to obtain their time in the most scientific manner to obtain particulars of them.
As will he seen by the illustration, this elegant and interesting instrument consists
of a telescope fastened on a horizontal axis, the ends of which are towards the east and
west points of the horizon, consequently the observer looks direct to the meridian line
in the heavens, and sees the stars pass over it, thus giving him the exact moment of
true time by observations of the simplest yet highest scientific character Astronomers,
Chronologists, or indeed any person, can resort to this instrument to ascertain their ex-
act time, and thereby correct their clocks. Such observations are very interesting.

* There are few events of history, the date of which can now be more accurately deter-
mined than the birth of Jesus Christ. The reason of this is because we have several
good incidents to guide us, and also because we now have batter means for using them.
Hitherto, owing to our ignorance of the science of time, and the absence of methods for
making astronomy of practical service, the useful statements of history have tended to
lead us into error, and to create controversy, rather than to guide us to the realization of
accurate conclusions. Therefore in investigating the date of the birth of our Lord, we
may dismiss all prior conclusions and consider afresh the facts which history supplies.
All these will be found to accord with the history and traditions of Christianity.
Investigations show the date to be the night between Friday and Saturday, the 25th
and 26th of the 3rd month, 3996, a.m., which would be the old Sabbath Day, beginning
at sun-set on Friday evening and ending at the same time on Saturday evening. This
date synchronizes with our 25th of December, 4 years before 4000, or common account
called Anno Domini, as stated in the margin of Matt, ii, i„ and 8 years before 4004, or
the old date of the nativity erroneously adopted.
The first method used for obtaining the date is from the Gospels, to understand which
I will place before the reader the form of the two years 3995, in which John the Baptist
was born, and 3996, when the Lord was born. These two years can be seen on the solar
cycle of the Ancient Hebrews, they being the 9th and 10th of the cycle marked t and j.
Before pointing out St. Luke’s dates on the above two years, let me show that they
are 3996 and 3996. This will be done by stating a simple fact. As the cycle from
which they are taken consists of 15 years, the last figure of every first year of the cycle
will alternately be 7or 2. Thus, the first year of the cycle from which the above two
are taken was 3987 ;so that the 9th and 10th must be 3995 and 3996. Of course these
years are found on the cycle by other methods, one of which is the line of eclipses, but
the direction given is simple. I may further state that the figures in each of the months
are Saturdays, the seventh day, and that the months of the lunar, or Biblical year, were
always 30 or 29 days alternately. This was because the moon revolves round the earth
in 29J days. This half day was always borrowed for the preceding months, and so they
went on through the year, the first month having 30 days, the second 29, and so on. By
thus having the length of the month the same as the period of the moon, the moon was
like a clock, by being new at the beginning, of the months. No man therefore could
alter the dates of the month without disturbing the motions of the earth and moon.
We can now proceed. In Luke i. 5, we read that Zacharias, the father of John the
Baptist, was a priest of the order of Ahia. If we turn to 1 Chron. xxiv. 10 and 19, we
find that the course or order of Abia or Abija was the eighth. Each course officiated a
week in the temple, consequently, on the first Sabbath or week of the year, the first
course ministered and was relieved in the second week by the second course. Hence
*he eighth course, that of Abija, began with the 'eighth week of the year. Now if the
reader looks at the above year 3995, he will see that the Bth Sabbath of the year was
the 24th of the 2nd month. This was the day when the angel Gabriel appeared to
Zacharias when he was ministering in the temple. Subsequent parts of the gospel will
prove it. In the 10th verse we read of “ the whole multitude praying at the time of
incense.” Thus, as Bentley and others tell us, on no other day than the Sabbath can
the worshippers deserve such a definition. Besides this I find that great spiritual
events took place on the Sabbath Day, which was in agreement with the statement that
“God blessed (exalted) the seventh day and sanctified it.” (set it apart for religious
purposes), v Divine communications to the prophets and visions were on Sabbath Days,
DATE OP THE BIETH OP OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST.


Now, allowing nine months for natural gestation, John the Baptist would be bom
about the 25th of the 11th month (Sabbath Day, see the table of the year 3995). Not
later, for we are closely pressed by other facts mentioned by the Evangelists, starting'
with the birth of our Lord, and which must have their place in the interval between the
birth of John and that of Jesus Christ. Hence, when in verse 26th of Luke i. we read
of 6th month of Elizabeth’s time, and again in verse 36, that Gabriel told the Virgin
Mary that “this is the 6th month with her” (Elizabeth), it would be the Sabbath Day,
on 21th of 7th month, called Ist sacred month in Scripture. Ido not mean 6th month
completed, for it appears to have begun with Elizabeth but a few days. Here let me
also explain, by way of confirmation, that this Sabbath Day, the 24th of the Ist sacred
month (7th civil) which seems to have been the annunciation, is an important date of
Scripture. It was the same month, date of the mouth, day of the week, and same year
on the solar cycle (9th) that Gabriel appeared to Daniel in the year 3470. That is to
say, the same year came round again with every repetition of the cycle, (for the form and
dates of the years of the Bible are astronomical and cannot alter) until it was 3995. If
the reader turns to Dan. x. 4, he will read this date, and by the 2nd and 3rd verses he
will see that Daniel fasted “ three whole weeks,” namely from the 3rd to the 10th, from
thence to the 17th, and then to the 24th.
Now let me return from this digression—though the sublime event is wo. thy of it—
and proceed with the incidents of the nativity. It is well to observe that after the salu-
tation of Gabriel to Mary, who was told that the 6th mouth of Elizabeth’s time had come,
Mary went to reside with her cousin Elizabeth, and abode with her three months
(verse 66), before John the Baptist was born. By this statement we cannot consider
the salutation of Mary to be later than the 24th of the 7th civil month, nor, owing to
the period when the 6th month of Elizabeth began, can we assign an earlier date
for Gabriel’s appearance.
Here comes out the date of the birth of our Lord, namely, nine months after the 24th
of the 7th month 3995, which ended on the 23th of the 3rd mouth, 3996. This was our
25th of December. The proof of this is that the natural and Biblical solar year begins
with the 20th of Sept, three days before the autumnal equinox, so that the same period
in Dec. ends the 3rd montli of the year, and every solar year which is preceded by the
intercalary mouth of 34 days (See bottom of 3995) begins with the Hebrew lunar year.
In other words, as the intercalary month was required at the end of every three years
in order to make them equal to three solar, the lunar and solar years after this started
together. This is frequently alluded to in the Scriptures. Often as “ two full years,”
that is a full solar and lunar.* If we had no knowledge of the intercalary month at the
end of the year 3995, the words of St. Luke would have been of no use to u? in finding
the date of the nativity.
“THE TIME IS FULFILLED.”—Marki. 15.
There are other means for proving the date of the birth of David’s son and Lord than
those I have just given. As the years of the Chaldeans and Ancient Hebrews came
round again in 15 years with the same dates of the month for the Sabbath Days, they
also did so after 30 years, and as John the Baptist and our Lord, according to Hebrew
custom could not begin their mission until they were 30 years old, the foregoing table
would also be years 4025, when John began preaching in the wilderness, and 4026 when
Jesus Christ came preaching and saying “ the time is fulfilled.” Every good Greek
scholar understands this by the emphatic character of the words “ In those days came
John the Baptist.” lam sorry that in our New Testament justice has not been done
to the phenomenal character of these words and others which are “ coloured ” by their
association with intercalary periods. But what time was it that was fulfilled? It was
the time prophesied by Daniel. The solar cycle gives the year 3543-4 for the 7th of
Artaxerxes, to which when 49 years (seven weeks), and 434 (sixty-two weeks) are added,
we reach this 4026, when our Lord was baptized and began his ministry of 3J years.
Now as John the Baptist was not commissioned to recognize the Divinity of Jesus
till he saw the Holy Spirit descending upon him. which he did at the Lord’s baptism,
in 4026, “the 15th year of Tiberius,” (See Roman history in All Past Time), we have to
allow time for the incidents between the baptism and the passover in ihe middle of the
same year mentioned in John ii. 13. These are 40 days in the wilderness, the calling
of the disciples, the marriage in Cana of Galilee, and his preaching in Capernaum. For
these we must allow more than two mouths. We thus again arrive at the same period.
• Unfortunately these and other words referring to the intercalary period in the Bible, have proved a pitfall to our
translators in about roo instances. In Acts xxiv. 27. the words are translated as a period of 24 months, so that it is com*
mon to hear from the pulpit and to read in books, written by men from Universities (!) that St, Paul was two years in
prison, instead of a detention of three or four weeks. In Luke ix. 51, instead of taking up the intercalary days at the
end of 4028. the translators take the Lord up to heaven six months before crucifixion. In Daniel iwe have a youth of
17 fed three years on the king’s meat to see how he improved I It should be the days at the end of three years. When will
our Universities appoint Professors of the Science of Time,
u 2


Now as our Lord was born in the 3rd month of 3995 (our Dec.), he was 30 in 4026 at
the same period. In proof of this we know that his ministry lasted nearly years,
so that he was crucified at the passover, 4029 J, the middle of the natural year. We
have only to look at this year on the solar cycle, and we then see that it was the 13th
on the cycle, table m. The 7th mouth (called Ist sacred) has 16th day for Saturday,
the old Sabbath Day. Hence the 14th, when the supper is appointed to be eaten, was
Thursday, and the 15th was Friday—Good Friday. It will be seen that Friday could
not always fall on the 15th of the month. The date is a cardinal one in Scripture.
Abraham left Chaldea on the 15th of the 7th month, 2082,
Abraham was oifering up Isaac on 15th of the 7th month, 2132.
Israelites inarched out of Egypt on 15th of the 7th month, 2513.
Jesus Christ was Crucified on 15th of the 7th month, 4029.
This is conclusive. The reason why some men—and I doubt not good men—attempt
to show that the Lord was crucified on some other day is that they want to overturn
the Lord’s Day. But they never show what " the Lord’s Day ”in the New Testament
is if it is not the day of his resurrection, nor do they try to show us why the disciples
came together to break bread on “ the first day of the week,” or why it is so prominent.
BAPTISM TO PASSOVER—Ho “stood up to Read” o ' IGth of sth month.
s6tb of 3rd After h!s Baptism— on completing his 30th year—he was 40 days in the wilderness. These were the same-
days and dates as Mary’s purification, 30 years previously, ending on 7th of sth month—Thursday—one of the
days of fasting. This explains why Anna who set veil God at the fastings—2nd and sth days—was in the temple
9th of gth. Returned to Jerusalem. John having fulfilled his mission was now in prison. The Lord proceeded to his
home at Nazareth in Galilee) Matthew iv. 12, and Mark i. 14,
*6th of sth. The Lord was in the synagogue at Nazareth on the following Sabbath, where Luke informs us that he stood
month tip to read Isaiah 61, afterwards saying “ This day is this scripture fulfilled in your cars,” He at this time
announced himself to be the Messiah in accordance with the Divine testimony at his baptism. The date la
well fixed by the table at the end of Vander Hooght’s Hebrew Bible, where Isaiah 61 is section 50 for the Sab*
batical readings. One section was read each Sabbath. We see that by counting the Sabbaths from the be-
ginning of the sacred year with the 7th month (Ist sacred) in 3995, we reach the 50th on the 16th of the sth
month: This is a good confirmation of the chronology and settles the time of all the incidents in question:
X7tbto 23rd He called his disciples this week. Mark i. 16; Matthew iv. 18; John i 42 says same and adds that on the
3rd day (of the week) he with his disciples was at the marriage in Cana of Galilee As his mission had come,
and he was proclaimed as the Son of God, he said to his mother, “ What art thou now to me 1"
He then went down to Capernaum which he adopted as his future residence, and to which he returned
from ail his tours. It was 20 miles from Cana. The man possessed with an unclean spirit (Mark i. ai) in the
7th of 6th synagogue would be on 7th of 6th civil month. The Lora was three weeks at Capernaum at least, because
Luke (iv 31) says “he taught them on the Sabbath Days.'* Various miracles are recorded for this time.
iSt of 7th; Leaving Capernaum at the end of the 6th month, he was at Jerusalem in the early part of the 7th month,
which was passover month. He overthrew the tables of the money changers, and dro\ c the oxen away
15th of 7th; The Lord was at the Passover John ii. 23. As Jesus Christ wns crucified at the Passover 4029, there would
be four passovers from the commencement of his ministry early in 4026 ? the four are mentioned by St. John
in chapters ii 13 ; r. x; vi s; vi 4 and xi. 8
The total eclipse of the moon 9 mentioned by Josephus determines the period of the
birth of Christ. He tells us that daring the rage of Herod, (which seems to have been
a few weeks before he died) he put a priest to death, and “ that very night there was an
eclipse of the moon.” We also learn that a little later he shut up some eminent men in
the hippodrome, ordering them to be killed as soon as he died. He also slew his son.
Antipater. It is very probable that the children in Bethlehem were slain whilst Herod
was in this rage. Now we have good evidence that he died in the 4th month of 3998,
(about the end of our January). If we look at the Triple Eclipse Table we see that the
nearest year when No. 1 eclipse, the leader of the team of 70 began, was 3984. Add 14
and we have Line xv for 3998. Looking at the Bird’s Eye View of Eclipses in Natural
Years, we see a total Eclipse of the moon £ in the middle of the 2nd month (end of our
Nov.), so that the massacre of infants would be when our Lord was nearly 2 years old.
There are a few historical facts to notice. In “ Haydn’s Dates ”we read that ‘‘the
birth-day of Jesus Christ was kept on the 25th of Dec. in the year 98.” This was in the
life-time of St. John. Again, in the year 127, Telesphorus, the Bishop of Rome, speaks of
a feast on 25th Deo. because Christ was born on that date. In 284 we also read that
the nativity was celebrated on 25 th of Dec. Some men who oppose all this testimony of
history say the Lord could not be born at this time just because the shepherds were
watching over their flocks by night. The meu who lived in the years just quoted would
know these words more than we do. But Josephus says Bethlehem was a great place
for sheep, and that at the passover 250,000 were required. These could not be kept
in the back-yards of Bethlehem. Like our flocks, they would be folded in thousands
in the country and watched over, otherwise many might be destroyed or stolen.
Again as the enrolment would take place at the beginning of the Homan year on Ist
of January, would not Joseph and Mary arrive in Bethlehem a few days before it.
But beyond all these incidents of corroboration, there was a beautiful and significant
event in Jerusalem on the 25th of the 3rd month which would fix the date of the nativ-
ity in the minds of all the followers of the Lord. It was the Feast of Dedication (See
John x. 22) It was also called the “Feast of Lights,” because that night, every year,
all Jerusalem was illuminated as a sign of rejoicing. How appropriate was this also of
the nativity of Him who is “ the Light of the World!’’


THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM.
One of the interesting events connected with the birth of Jesus Christ was the Star
of Bethlehem recorded in Matt, ii- Many writers have attempted to account for this
beautiful and impressive object in the sky by referring it to some natural phenomenon of
the heavens, such as a conjunction of two planets, or a sudden appearance of a meteoric
luminary, but all these efforts have been ludicrous failures, for there can be no doubt
from the description by St. Matthew of its singular position and motion, as well as
its appearance at special times, that the star which induced the Magi, who were learned
men, to undertake a long and costly journey from Babylonia or northern Persia to Jeru-
salem, was a supernatural object. To illustrate the subject and the opinions of various
writers, the annexed diagrams are given.
Figure A. is a representation of the constellation of Cassiapea in which a brilliant
star hrs sometimes appeared after intervals of about 325 years. Such stars are believed
to be the result of meteoric combustion ; but as this luminary, known as “ Pilgrim,”
never moved from its relat ve position to others near it. having no change of place hut
that which is common to all celestial objects as they bodily travel from east to west, it
does not answer the description in the gospel. Neither could any others of its class.
Besides which “ Pilgrim” could not appear in or uear the nativity year.
Figure B. is an illustration of a conjunction of two planets—Venus and Jupiter—
■which some say the Star of Bethlehem may have been. Both these well-known planets
move in one direction, from left to right, but Jupiter has a slower motion, so that
Venus, (top left corner,) travelling at a quicker pace, gains upon him. Let the four
positions represent say a month. In the top row the two planets are pretty wide apart,
but a few nights afterwards they are seen as in the second row, Venus being nearer to
Jupiter and slightly below his line. A few nights still later their positions are in the
third row, and lastly they are close together, and are in conjunction, although Jupiter
may he more than 200 millions of miles beyond Venus. Now as the ancients would bo
as familiar with such a phenomenon as ourselves, it is uot reasonable to suppose that
the Magi, who were learned men, would come to Jerusalem because of a conjunction of
two well-known planets. Besides this there was no conjunction near that time.
Figure 0. contains a representation of what the Star of Bethlehem seems to have been
according to what is recorded in Matt. ii., namely, the plain disc at the top like a small
moon, or one of the superior planets seen through a telescope of low power. The splen-
did star-group on the left and right is a double view of the magnificent constellation of
Orion as explained under figure C. It is probable that owing to the Star of Bethlehem
not moving with the luminaries of the firmament, and not being on the star maps, one
of which was made by Hipparchus 150 years before Christ, that the Magi were impressed.
The time when they arrived in Jerusalem would be about 12 days after the nativity.
Now concerning this star we have to bear in mind that it was .-ecu to move, having a
sensible motion, for we read that as the Magi journeyed to Bethlehem, “the star which
they saw in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child
was.” It is to be hoped that the reader will not think that two planets in conjunction
could do this. But some men seem to think so. Yet there was a special star; for we
cannot think that St. Matthew, who had occupied a public position requiring education
and influence to obtain, would have beeu so simple as to write of an event as one which
“ troubled all Jerusalem,” he knowing that, when he wrote his book, there were many
men living in Jerusalem who saw the star, and thousands of men who could verify the
trouble of Herod and his courtiers. That, notwithstanding alt this, there was much
foolish prejudice, as it is plain there is now, is not a matter of surprise. The world has
never lacked its “ generation of vipers.”
There is reason to believe that of this star there was a prophecy which has not reached
ns through the Hebrew Scriptures, just as is the case concerning the prophecy by Enodh
about the Lord coming with ten thousands of his saints. The patriarchal church would
have many writings. All religious history before Moses seems to be brief extracts from
the sacred writings of the Patriarchal Church, taken to show the connection of the
Hebrews with Adam and the beginning.
Finally, let me say, that had the Science of Time been taught in onr universities, men
would not have doubted the date of the birth of the Son of God or the star which her-
alded the notable event, the knowledge of which, independent of history, has come
down to ns from generation to generation. But, unhappily, it is the same with these as
with others. Many of the great facts of Biblical history are accounted as “ legendary ”
rather than attested realities of Chronological Astronomy. But such is the unfathom-
able depths of darkness of the human mind, that men unblushingly presume to deny
what others by proper investigation find to be irresistible facts.

FIG C.
The top plain luminary in Figure C. is supposed to be the Star of Bethlehem, and the
central perpendicular line, close to it, divides two views of the constellation of Orion,
that to the right being the position of the constellation two hours afterwards, and lower
down. These two views of Orion are given because, like all the other stars, this con-
stellation would have a direct motion in consequence of rising in the east and setting in
the west, whilst the Star of Bethlehem, by being a near luminary, would remain station;
ary over Jerusalem. This would be the most attractive character of the strange and
wonderful star and could not fail to arouse the attention of the astronomers nr Magi,
and induce them to undertake a costly journey to Jerusalem.

DATES OF THE CRUCIFIXION AND RESURRECTION OF JESUS CHRIST,
ASCENSION AND PENTECOST DAYS.
By looking at the Solar Cycle of the Ancient Hebrews, 4029, which is the Crucifixion
year, marked tn, the reader will see that the following table consists of the Ist, 2nd, and
3rd sacred months, which start from the middle of the year. They will be recognized
by the figures, which are the Sabbath Days. Thus 291623 30 in Ist sacred month.
* Three or four passages state that the passover was to be eaten at even on the 14th.
Our Lord and his disciples obeyed the command, as Thursday the night before the cru-
cifixion was the 14th. The Israelites left Egypt on the 15th (Num. xxxiii. 3).
I place the third appearance of the risen Lord, as narrated in John xxi, on Sunday for
the following reasons.
1. In the old dispensation, all spiritual work, and particularly visions of the Divine
presence, or words of the Lord to the prophets, were on Saturday the Seventh day; but
commencing with the triumphant resurrection of Jesus Christ, such occurrences took
place on the Lord’s Day. The observance runs through the New Testament. 2. St. John
connects this appearance on the shore of the Sea of Tiberias with the two previous Sun-
days. 3. St. Peter after the removal of Jesus Christ, naturally thought of resuming his
old occupation, and hence after the Sabbath, which expired at the setting of the sun on
Saturday, he purposed to begin with the new week. He and other disciples who were
fishermen, had no idea of the work they had to do. The step was wrong and so they
“caught nothing.’’ 4. I see no reason why the Greek word proiat, translated morning,
should not imply the morning of the first. We have prota and other forms of the word
indicating the first or fore-part of a ship, &c. and there seems a natural use of the word
to translate it, morning of the first day of the week when Jesus stood on the shore.
The priority of this appearance of the Lord to that when 500 brethren were present, is
supported by Bede, who was born in 673. He gives a quotation from an ancient poet,
to the effect that when St. Peter followed the Lord he was instructed to tell all the dis-
ciples when they would see him. On hearing of this they assembled in large numbers.
St. Paul tells us (1 Cor. xv. 7). that after being seen by 500 brethren, the Lord showed
himself to James, and then to the apostles. We must not crowd these incidents too
much. The apostle to the Gentiles seems to have had the last three Lord’s days, before
the ascension, in his mind, and as it was Sunday when Peter saw the Lord, it was the
same day of the week when James saw him on a special occasion.
The crucifixion was at the beginning of 81. a.d. Our year then began on 21st March.
It was 1J years too fast, and when Parliament, in 1752, ordered the next year to begin
with January (which was going in the wrong direction), we got 1J before a.m.


It will be seen by this table of the “40 days” and the Pentecost on the 50th day,
that we have conclusive evidence that our Lord was crucified on a Friday. There are
however, a few persons who say that Wednesday was the day. In this case, as Mark
states that the Saviour rose on the first day of the week, he would have been in the
tomb five days! Luke xxiv states early on the first day of the week (Sunday) the se-
pulchre was visited by the women who were told by some angels that the Lord had
risen. The evangelist also tells ns that on “the same day” (verse 13), two disciples
were walking towards Emmaus when they were joined by the risen Lord who enquired
why they were so sad. They explained and added (21) “ this is the third day since
these things (the crucifixion) were done.” The other evangelists are equally plain.
But the nest way to disprove the statements of men who suppose the followers of
Christ have not piously preserved the day of the week when Christ was on the cross, is
the record in Acts i. where we read that the Lord was seen by the disciples during 40
days after his passion, and that on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost was given.
This was Sunday and it has since been observed as Whit-Snnday. Pentecost means
the 50th day, and it was observed by the Jews, as Josephus tells ns, as the anniversary
of the delivery of the Law on Sinai on the 50th day after the Israelites left Egypt on
the 15th of the Ist sacred month. But how could Pentecost fall on Sunday unless the
day of crucifixion was Friday and the 15th of the mouth? (See the table).
WHEN AND BY WHOM WAS THE SABBATH DAY CHANGED?
This question was asked by a correspondent, and the reply given was that it was
changed by the Lord himself in the year 4029, when he rose from the dead. As already
remarked, all great spiritual events took place on Saturday, the seventh day of the week,
before the resurrection of Christ, but on and after his victory over death and the grave,
they all occurred on Sunday. There seems great probability that the events on the six
Sundays, set out on the table of the Dates of the Crucifixion and Resurrection, are cor-
rect. We know that three of them are.


DATES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT.
ST. PAUL’S JOURNEYS, &c.


Matt; iii. 1. “In those days came John the Baptist preaching.” The words have no
connection with what precedes them, and are altogether indefinite without noticing
their special reference to the intercalary days to which they belong, when John was
30. The solar cycle is 15 years, so that two cycles are 30 years, thus having a repe-
tition of the same period of time. Hence “in those days.’’ Bat the words are
demonstrative, as in other parts of Scripture, showing that the period which had
now come round again was the intercalary days at the end of 4025, table i of the
solar cycle (our Sept.). Without admitting this, the strain of ambiguity is so great
as to mislead an ordinary English reader.
Mark i. 15. " The time is fulfilled.” The early part of 4026, j, when our Lord began
his ministry, he being about 30 years of age. The time fulfilled refers to Daniel’s 60
weeks (Dan. ix,) As 69 multiplied by 7 represents 483 years, they, when deducted
from 4026, leave 3543, which was most certainly the 7th of Artaxerxes mentioned in
Ezra vii. where we have also the full text of the king’s proclamation.
Luke ii. 11. This is the date when onr Saviour was born, in the night between Friday
and Saturday, the 25th-26th of the 3rd month, 3996, table j of the Ancient Hebrew
Solar Cycle. Hence he was born on the Sabbath Day which began at sun-set on Fri-
day evening. See “ Date of the Birth of our Lord Jesus Christ,”
Luke ii. 42. In the year 4008, table g, onr Lord was 12 years old- He was at the Pass-
over, in Jerusalem, which it will be seen by the solar cycle began that year on Ifrd-
nesday. as it was the 15th of the Ist sacred (7th civil) month. The 7 days of the
feast ended on the following Tuesday, the 21st, and next day, Wednesday, Joseph and
Mary were on their retnrn journey. They returned and in 3 days found Jesus in the
temple. This was Saturday, Sabbath Day, 25th of the month.
Luke iii. 1. The 15th year of Tiberius was 4026, j. See Boman Emperors.
Luke iv. 16- The Saviour stood up to read in the Synagogue at Nazareth on the 60th
Sabbath of the sacred year, which was the 16th of the 11th sacred (sth civil) month,
4026, J, Isaiah Ixi., which he read, is the 50th section in the table of Tan Hooten’s-
Hebrew Bible, one of which was read each Sabbath Day.
Luke vi. i. This was Sabbath Day on the 2nd of the Ist sacred month, 5)27, table k.
Look at the cycle. “ The second Sabbath after the first,” is not English.
Luke ix, 61. A very incorrect translation. The original states that when the days were
fully completed that were taken up, our Lord set his face steadfastly towards Jeru-
salem. The words refer to the “ days,” of the intercalary period at the end of 4028,
table I. of the Ancient Hebrew solar cycle, and not to Jesus Christ who was not taken
up till nearly nine months afterwards.
Luke xi. 1. The Greek text says “on the 9th,” which was, after sun-set, Thursday, the
Ist civil month of 4029, table m. For the meaning of this consult Levit. xxiii. 82.
Luke zxiv. 1. Sunday, the 17th of Ist sacred month, 4029}, m. See the Besurrection.
John ii. 1. This “ third day,” marriage in Cana, seems to have been Tuesday, the third
day of the week, Ist sacred month, 4026 J, j, which followed the temptation.
John ii. 13. The first of the four passovers during the ministry of Jesus Christ, 4026}
table j, Monday, the 15th of Ist sacred month. The second, 4027}, k. Saturday, chap,
y. 1. The third, 4028 J, I, was Tuesday, chap. vi. 4, The fourth, 4029}, m., was on
Friday (crucifixion day), chapter xii. 1.
Acts ii. 1. Pentecost, on Sunday, 7th of 9th civil month, table n>, the 60th day after the
crucifixion, 4029}. It is the anniversary of the giving of the Law. See Besurrection.
Acts ix. 23, Conversion of St. Paul, end of 4034, c. See Intercalary Periods.
Acts xx. 2,3, &o, St. Paul’s journey through Macedonia to Palestine. Consult printed
table of dates and places, 4058, U
Acts xxiv. 27- St. Paul was not two years in prison. The passage refers to the inter-
calary days at end of 4058, U when two full years—a solar and lunar—occurred.
Consult Intercalary Periods.
Acts xxviii- 30. St. Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house in Rome, from
4059} to 4061 J, tables m, n, o. of the solar cycle. The Apostle could not have a hear-
ing before Nero owing to the Emperor’s absence more than a year on a singing tour in.
Greece, and was subsequently burnt out by the great fire in 4061.

ST. PAUL'S JOURNEY FROM GREECE THROUGH MACEDONIA TO PALESTINE-
Year 4058, a.m., or 59, a.d., the 12th of the Solar Cycle,
being the 7th, Bth, and 9th civil, or Ist, 2nd and 3rd sacred months.
This is the same year of the Cycle as the Exodus. The a.d. year is from 4000, a.m.,
the commencement of the Christian Era, not the birth of Christ, 8996, which would be 62.
* Seven days’ of purification of the four men, Acts xxiv. 23 and 27.
St. Paul could not abide seven days at Troas and thou preach till midnight on the
First day of the week, ready to depart on the morrow, if the year was the 9th, 10th, 11th,
or 13th. The events will not fit such years, and it must be borne in mind that lunar years
being formed by the revolutions of the moon, over which there is no human control, the
months must alternately possess 80 or 29 days, thus giving perpetuity to' the Solar Cycle.
If the above events be placed on the 9th or 11th years of tho Cycle the end of seven days
from the arrival of St. Paul at Troas would require him to be preaching on Tuesday mid-
night, or if the 10th year, on Friday midnight.
A GREAT ERROR OF THE ENGLISH NEW TESTAMENT CORRECTED.
The next point in connection with the events of the dates belonging to Acts xs - xxiv. is
an important one in respect to our historical knowledge of St Paul’s travels. It wiU bo
seen that by xxiv. 22, 23, that Felix adjourned St. Paul’s case, and then, “after certain
days,” (24) probably to another court day, Felix came with Brasilia, his wife, who was a
Jewess, and sent for St. Paul in order to hear more of the Christian faith. This act was
repeated during the remaining three months of the year.
But in the 27 th verse we are told that “when two years were fulfilled,” Felix was suc-
ceeded by Festus. This must be an erroneous translation. It is worse, however, in the
authorised version, where it says, “But after two years.” What the original states is,
“When two years were completed,” that is, not two years from the adjournment of the
case, but when the period arrived in Jewish time requiring two lunar years to receive the
additional intercalary days. The Jewish years were triple in character, having 34 inter-
calary days at tire end of each 3rd year. During the first one lunar and solar time were
together, but lunar years having only 354 days, the 2nd year began 11 days before the solar,
and the 3rd year was 22 days in advance of the solar. Consequently at tho end of these
“ two years,” the intercalary days were required to prevent the next year from being 33,
but really 34 days, in advance. This is the moaning of Acts xxiv. 27.


Now for u»e proof. The next chapter telle us that “ after three days” Festus went op to
Jerusalem. If the reader looks at the ancient Hebrew Solar Cycle, he will see that the Brd
Intercalary day of this twelfth year we hare been speaking of, was Sabbath Hay. So that
as Festus would not travel in Judaea on the day of rest, he would wait till after the third
day, which St. Luke here particularises. Then again, in verse 6th, the next Sabbath Day
is spoken of, namely the 10th, and this clears up the jumble in the margin of the authorised
version. Festus seems again to have waited till the Sabbath was over before returning to
Caesarea. These two Sabbath Days, 3rd and 10th, could not be any other than those in the
intercalary days at the foot of the 12th year of the cycle. They could not be those in the
first month of the 15th year, because the 10th day was “ the Fast,” mentioned in xxvii. 9.
In addition to this we have evidence of the Apostle being at sea in the intercalary period.
The word ieanais in the 7th, and a repetition of it, the 9th verse, alludes to this particular
time, in the sense of great, adapted, sufficient. It is commonly used in a demonstrative
sense in connection with the intercalary period. It forms the date of St. Paul’s conversion
(Acts ix. 23.) and of St. Peter’s sojourn at Joppa (verse 43), both alluding to the intercalary
period of 4034, A.u., which was 35 a.d., the 3rd year on the Ancient Hebrew Cycle. It is
found in the same three senses, though not in relation to time, in Mark i. 7, Luke iiL 16,
2 Cor. ii. 6,16. Sec. I would therefore read “ And when we had sailed slowly in intercalary
days.” “When intercalary time was gone through (not spent) and the voyage was now
dangerous, because the Fast was now already gone by,” Sc c,
I have not space to enlarge on the subject here, but I do not like the English translation
of the last chapters of the Acts at all. Let it however be remarked that St. Luke finishes
the history of St. Paul where he began it, in the end of the 3rd year of the cycle—forming
Altogether 27 years, as is seen by the additional two whole years (xxviii. 30) —and this ex-
plains the somewhat abrupt termination of the narrative.
I do not mean to say that the Greek word ucavot always refers to intercalary days.
But it does when associated with that period. It is more than 30 years since my tutor
taught me to read Greek, but Parkhurst was my first guide to a knowledge of this important
word, and I would refer the reader to his copious citations.
Another Mistranslation.
In the authorised version, Luke vL 1. we read “On the second Sabbath after the first.’’
No one can understand what this means. But in the revised version, instead of properly
mending the Greek, SeuTepoTuTtp is ignored and the verse reads “a Sabbath” ! There is a
marginal note stating “ Many ancient authorities insert second-first,” Indeed I have never
seen any copies without the Greek words. But the fact is this verse gives us one of the
most definite dates of the history of our Lord's ministry. It reads “ The Sabbath on the 2nd
of the Ist month.” A glance at the Ancient Hebrew Solar Cycle shows that die Sab-
bath days of the first sacred (seventh civil) month, eleventh year of the cycle, fell on
the 2nd, 9th, 16th, 23rd, and 30th days. Why should the historical evidence of the ver-
actity of ancient writings be destroyed by mistranslations of this kind ? Before the revised
version was published an official letter was sent to the revisers mentioning the names of
two gentlemen who were able to assist them in the translation of chronological expressions,
but beyond a courteous acknowledgement of this letter, nothing more was heard of it. The
result of this indifference is in the hands of every intelligent reader, because just as the
simple use of the multiplication table in every school in England ensures the correct ad-
ding up of any amount of numbers, so does the application of a system of astronomical
measurement provide the accurate determination of periods of time all over the world.
I regret the necessity for speaking so plainly of a work to which I looked forward
with gladsome anticipations, but to be silent in noticing so much error, and to allow
‘ho New Testament to go down to posterity stripped of the great scientific testimonies
which no other historical work possesses, would, in my case, be unpardonable. There is
not a date or period of time in the Old or New Testament which is not in perfect accord
with the astronomical lines of scientific time derived from eclipses or the transits of the
planets, Mercury and Venus, or which is not also determined by the stem application of
the Metonic or' lunar cycle, and therefore to obliterate the testimony of authenticity in
the Scriptures, or to make them state what was never written, is to impugn their veracity
and allow cavillers to place them on an equality with spurious writings. The religion of
the Bible, it should also be stated, is the only one which has a genuine history and is
corroborated by the deductions of science, I therefore protest against the public reading
in churches of a version which has been sent to press regardless of its historical evidence.
The Bible is a far greater book than has been supposed. It teams with science, and
we ought not to allow sceptical men the opportunity of placing a finger upon its pages.


THE DEATH OF ABEL—At the end of Intercalary Days of Tear 125.
The Bible being the oldest writings in the world, we must use it to verify all the
years since time was instituted. The date given in the Scriptures for the death of
Abel is an interesting confirmation of the eleven w eeks of 77 intercalary or extra days
used by the antediluvians at the end of each seventh year for making the lunar and
solar year agair, Start together on the same day. We find the date of Abel’s death in
the following simple way: The margin reading of Gen. iv. 3. reads “ and at the end
of days” it came to pass, &o. The real literal Hebrew is “ and it was at the end of
days.” The meaning of this peculiar phrase is plain. It refers to the days at the
end of the solar cycle of seven years. To prove this we may turn to X Kings xvii 7,
where we have the same Hebrew expression in the margin used in connection with
a year (3095) which had intercalary, days, though they were in Elijah’s time less in
number, as will afterwards he explained in reference to Table i. (See Ancient Hebrew
•olar cycle); and it is worthy of notice that these intercalary days are on two or three
other occasions, when the year of the Hebrews fell on Table i, associated with sheep-
shearing and feasting. The churlish Nabal got drunk at this “ feast of ingathering ”
of the fruits when he also sheared his sheep at the end of days in the year 2945 (See
1 Sam. xxv. 86, and also compare 2 Sam. xiii. 23) There seems abundant evidence
that there was a great similarity between the patriarchal and Hebrew customs. But
beyond this fact, we may further observe that the fruits of the earth at none of the
end of the lunar years assigned by chronologists as the period when Cain slew Abel
could be ripe, seeing that the solar year was getting two to three months late. We see,
then, that these intercalary days, falling next in precedence to the birth of Seth in
the year 130, were those at the end of the year 125 The date of the sad catastrophe
would be in “ the end of the days,” probably the 77th —a great Sabbath Day—actually
ending the solar year, but before the sun was down the earth was reddened with
Abel’s blood.
The most interesting chronological point is the proof of the 77 intercalary days,
and I think that Lameoh’s words, associated with Cain’s great crime in the end of
these 77 days, have some historical connection with them, seeing that he expresses
their number in a proverbial sense—“ seventy and sevenfold.” Gen. iv. 24.
REMARKS CONCERNING TEARS
I use the chronology of our English Bible in this work, that is what is known as
the “ Hebrew text.” The “ Samaritan ” and “ Septuagint ” are not astronomical,
and therefore not worth a straw. Hales greatly erred by using them. This is a very
important statement, but no more than 865 days can be put into a year, or more than
7,15, or 23 years in a solar cycle, and 19 years in a lunar cycle. These are stem
astronomical facts which no man can alter, and all the dates of the Bible work
upon them preserving in the whole narratives the character of the Seventh Day,
HOW TO FIND ANT TEAR ON THE SOLAR CTCLEB.
In the present edition of the Bible (King James’s, 1879) the 8.0. year given in
the margin of the Old Testament is on the supposition that our Lord was bom in
4004, A.M., therefore to find the year of the world that year must be used instead
of 8996, which all chronologists now admit to be the correct one.
Example:—To obtain the year of the departure of the Israelites from Egypt, the
margin of the Bible at Exodus zii. gives 149 L Subtract this from 4004
1491
This is the Exodus year admitted by commentators 2513 AM.
To find this 2513 on the Ancient Hebrew Solar Cycle, look at the list of the first
years (that is those which always were table a) of the cycle. It will be seen that
the nearest preceding year is 2502—which commenced the cycle. Now count for-
ward and 2513 will be Table I. All the dates in the Bible are found in this way,
except a few marginal inaccuracies, which let ns hope the present revisers will rectify.
In noticing the dates in the Bible, the reader must bear in mind, what is stated
more than once in this work, that the months are always used by the Hebrews in
their sacred order. The 7th month being that in which the Israelites left Egypt, it
begins the sacred year, and is called the Ist month. By this way the I‘ith civil
is the 6th sacred, and the Ist civil the 7th sacred month, Example, Daniel’s vision
recorded in chapter x 4, Tablet, the 24th of the Ist month (sabbath day) being the
7th proper or civil month of the year.
For the New Testament dates, the Crucifixion was Table to, which is 4029, A.M.
or 30 A.D. Our Lord was crucified on Friday, 15th of Ist sacred or 7th civil month,
His body was in the tomb on the 16th (sabbath day) and the 17th —Sunday—was
the first Lord’s Day, his resurrection


DATE OF THE DEATH OF AARON.
To be bora on the Sabbath Day. or to be earned by angels to the place of the blessed
on that day was esteemed as a great honour by the Jews. Our Lord was bom on the
night of Friday, which after sun-set was the Sabbath, and St, Paul speaks of being cir-
■enmeised on the eighth day, thus showing that he was born on the day which God ex-
alted and blessed in Eden. Aaron had the honour of dying on the Sabbath Day. In
Numbers xxxiii. 38, we read that he died on Mount Hor, at the commandment of the
Lord, in the fortieth year, after the children of Israel were come out of the land of
Egypt, on the Ist day of the sth month (sacred). As the Biblical years were planetary
motion, running in unbroken weeks of seven days, we can soon find what was the day
of the week when, without suffering or weakness, this high priest of God, laid down his
body and his charge. The exodus was in the middle of 2513, so that the 40th year
would be from 2552 J to 2553 J. Looking at the solar cycle, we see that 2552 was sixth
year of the cycle, and the Ist of the oth sacred month was Sabbath Day. What a grand
and impressive procession in the sight of saints and angels. Perhaps not a tear was
shed, whilst every heart was sustained. It was not a procession from the cell to the
platform, made sad by the tolling bell; but one in which the departing figure was the
high-priest in his robes and with a mitre on his brow. We might ask, Were the trumpets
sounded, and were the singers there as the procession began at the door of the sanctnary,
witnessed this Sabbath morning by every eye ? Was “ sweet incense burnt,” and were
the standards of Beuben and Ephraim there to cheer the eyes of Aaron before he met
-the banners borne by the hosts of heaven ?
THEEE SYSTEMS OP ASTRONOMY,
THE THIRD BY MR. JAMES GILLESPIE, OF DUMFRIES.
Although there are three systems of Astronomy, none of them affect Astronomical
Chronology, which can be claimed by each. The first is that held at Observatories, viz.
that the earth is spherical, rotating on its axis, and travelling round a stationary sun in
-3651 days. The second is that of which the late Mr. John Hampden was the chief in
England. Mr. John Williams, 32, Bankside, London, S.E. is the Secretary, and the
publications of the Society maintain than the earth is not a globe, and that the sun
travels above it in a circular course. Mr. Albert Smith, 8.A., is the editor. The
third system of astronomy is taught by Mr. James Gillespie, of 105, St. Michael Street,
Dumfries, in Scotland. His book “ The Triumph of Philosophy, or the True System of
the Universe,” is published at 2s. 6d. and is profusely illustrated. Mr. Gillespie is a
gifted man and his book has won much attention. He teaches that the earth is a globe,
but immoveable. He says the sun apparently revolves above the earth in a path similar
to the figure 8. The neck of the figure forms the two equinoxes, and in this way by the
sun working down the figure, the vernal equinox occurs by the sun crossing the neck-
The autumnal equinox is caused by the sun returning and working upwards, re-crossing
-at the same point. Of course there is equal day and night on both occasions. Mr.
•Gillespie admits the rotatory motion of the earth, bat refuses to acknowledge that it is
a planet. He also cannot see how planetary motion can be subject to legislative years.
ERRORS OF DATING BY MODERN JEWS.
The Jews in London celebrated Monday, 11th of September, 1893, as the first day of
their new year, 6654. It was truly the commencement of a new lunar year, and the
moon was new: but there is nothing—either by history or astronomy—to show that it
was the beginning of 5654. Every method we know proves that nine days later, viz.,
the 20th of September was the beginning of 6892, a.m.. The position of the eclipse of
the sun, which travels through the solar year, by stages of 18 years, in 649 years, is
sufficient to prove this. We saw the sun eclipsed on the 16th of April —which is the
the 6th month of the natural year—in 6891 (1893); but if the year was only 5654. the
•eclipse would have occurred in the 12th month, six months previously. The Jews are
to be commended for using natural a.m. years, starting from September, as did all the
ancients, but this simple system ought to show them how to obtain a true enumeration
■of the years of the world. They lost their year after the destruction of Jerusalem by
the Romans. They adopted another about two centuries afterwards, but abandoned it
about 400 years ago for the very ludicrous system they now use.
B.C. YEARS AND HOW MADE A.M.
The b.o- year is made a.m. by deducting from 4004, but this will not work when
the years are connected with the birth of Christ, because he was born in 3996. Exam-
ple: 1491, b. 0., in the margin of Exodus xii., deducted from 4004, is 2513, the true
exodus year. ■* But many of the years in the margin of Scripture are not accurate.
Usher was a Biblical man of great genius, but his work, which otherwise would have
been all simple a.m. years, was spoilt by listening to Joseph Scaliger, and others.

The 12 lines in each year represent the 12 months respectively. This solar cycle would
go on repeating the date of the Lord’s day in 28 years for ever had our years not been on
the solar principle. Our dates change in three centenary years in every four. i

EXPLANATION OF THE ENGLISH SOLAR CYCLE.
A clock is a cycle of 12 hours, and a week is a cycle of seven days. By their natural
continuance neither the hours or the days get out of place. A Solar Cycle is formed of
the number of years which bring the days of the week round again so that thiy fall on
the same dates of the monih. Our English Solar Cycle does this in 28 years. It
would do so after 7 years, but as we alter the form of every 4th year by making it a
.leap year, we require 4 times 7 years to complete the cycle.
Christians began about 523 to compute years from the birth of Christ, which was in
3996, a.m., from creation ; but this era was not generally adopted till 1428, which was
a first year of our Solar Cycle of 28 years.
The figures, or dates of the mouth, on otir Solar Cycle are Sundays, not Saturdays, as
is the case with the Antediluvian and the Ancient Hebrew cycles. No other cycles
than these three have existed, because there can be no cycles without weeks of 7 days.
.1 have already stated, in other sections, that as the Antediluvian ycats and dates work
in Soiar Cycles from the beginning, weeks of 7 days have never been broken.
By an Act of Parliament we bury our history and years by foolishly breaking up our
Solar Cycle three times in the course of four centuries by omitting the observance of
the leap year. A Solar Cycle should never be broken. The last alteration of the form
of our English year was when, “ new style ” was adopted in 1752. The 3rd of Sept,
was ordered by Parliament to be the 14th, and it was also enacted that the following
year should begin with January Ist instead of March 21st as formerly. By this 1702
had only nine mouths ! But Parliament jumped in the wrong direction, for the breach
between our years and scientific time was made three mouths wider.

The above shows the position of our English twelve months on the natural a.si. year.
Our year covers nine months of one true year and three months of the next, and with
such a system of time when eclipses, transits, or other phenomena are recorded by the
Observatory in Oct. Nov. and Dec. they are out of gear with planetary motion because
they belong to another year. It is therefore impossible to arrange them into tables for
historical reference. The eclipses cannot be pulled from their natural years, but this is
done when they are placed on unscientific English years. Hence all the darkness and
disputes about time and events,
HOW TO FIND THE YEARS OP THE WORLD BY SOLAR CYCLES.
It is a simple process to find any year or the tolal number of the years of the world
by solar cycles. First notice the “ Table of Each First Year of the Antediluvian Solar
Cycle, which it will be seen is proved by the Metonic method and marked off (*) into
periods of 133 years which bring creation year round again. The Antediluvian method
of keeping time ceased at the end of 1721, when a cycle of 15 years (Hebrew) succeeded one
of 7 with 1722. This fact is proved by the dating and the position of eclipses on both
of them. But really this is no point of importance inasmuch as years are carried on by
transits and eclipses. Then the years on the Hebrew Solar Cycle also submit to the
Metonic test as marked (See the page “ How to Find the Years,” following the Cycle).
It may further be remarked that seventh years are another proof of correct succession,
and also the dates of Scripture by falling on the right day of the week. There is thus
no possibility of getting wrong, and no man ought to speak of years who is not able to
identify them on solar cycles and prove them also by astronomical tests. There would
be no disputes about years, or centuries, if men used proper methods.

WHY ASTRONOMY IS BELOW THE STANDARD OF REVELATION.
ERRORS OF TIME AT THE OBSERVATORY.
The Greenwich Observatory was established little less than 200 years ago for the pur-
pose of assisting navigation ; but it is a great error to suppose that it has anything to do
with the Science of Time. What it does is to give the positions of the heavenly bodies
and astronomical phenomena, during the Gregorian, or English year, and the precision
with which the work is done and its great utility to mariners, is deserving of our admir-
ation and praise. But as the English year is not natural—that is to say, is not the year
produced by planetary motion—it has no claim to rank as Scientific Time, and for this
reason it fails to provide tables of eclipses or transits. This is a humihati g fact, and
one much to be regretted, because it will be seen that the use of unnatural time plunges
all history in darkness. Time is the amount of measured duration whilst some heavenly
body proceeds from one place to another. There can be no other time than this. But
there are 13 spurious systems of time in use in various parts of the world, and that ob-
served at the Greenwich Observatory is the worst and most misleading of all of them,
because it is based on an unnatural solar year which has been altered and pulled about
by Acts of Parliament by which none of the planetary worlds are controlled. A cash-
book cannot be kept unless it is reckoned up by tables formed of the standard value of
the coins it represents, and which must never be altered. Nor can a Ready-Reckoner be
published from one farthing to £l,OOO if the standard of a shilling—4B farthings—be
altered; yet our Observatory uses a year the form of which has been thrice altered.
But time, like arithmetic, is a fundamental science. Nothing can be added to it, or
anything taken away. To alter time we must alter the laws of the universe. The fol-
lowing is a ludicrous example of legislative interference with the Science of Time, and
1 am indebted to the editor of the London “ Daily Telegraph ” for the long leader of
approval of my remarks on the subject: “In what is called the year 1752, our legisla-
ture enacted what is termed ‘new style,’ and ordered that the next year should begin
with the Ist of January instead of the 21st of March as formerly. Hence the year 1752
had only nine months ! Parliament jumped three mouths in advance of the moon, but
did not take the earth or the moon with them. What was worse, our legislators took
their jump in the wrong direction, because Parliament had already indulged in athletic
performances to such an extent that they had leaped 18 months in advance of eclipse
time, s The distance therefore between the earth and Parliament is now If years.” The
Observatory was standing when this last error was made, but it shows that an establish-
ment of this character can make no profession of dealing with Scientific Time. Another
erroneous practice at the Observatory is, it makes all its celestial measurements from the
point of Aries—the vernal equinox in March, which is the middle of the natural year—
so the annual calculations are in two years. But let it be understood that no fault can
be found with the accuracy of these calculations. It is the error on which they are
based which defeats their utility to mankind. Men seem to think they can begin years
where they please; but an institution which would profess to deal with the motions of
the planetary bodies cannot do so with a Japanese system of this kind. The great fact
is, unless we start with the point of time given in Genesis i. no table of eclipses can
be made. Begin there and the eclipses will always record the true year of the world.
Is such useful knowledge to be hidden '{ There is no great desire that our English year
should be set right. It is too late to do this now. But what is insisted on is that all cal-
culations pertaining to the sublime science of astronomy should have a correct basis.
Men could then run a simple line—aye, and without. mathematical science—from the
eclipses we now see to those recorded by the ancients, and from the present time to the
date of Creation, or any other subsequent event. We should prove all history, and
our Observatory would be doubled in its service to mankind by dealing with time as
well as navigation; but until this is dune, it cannot be regarded as an astronomical in-
stitution, and the post of “ Astronomer Royal" has a meaning which is not enviable.
I hope that these remarks will be received in a proper spirit. For some reasons I
regret to make them, but I have long ceased to wonder that great errors should exist
in our literature and museums—men born 300 years before their fathers—and that our
English Bible should be loaded with ludicrous translations whilst its historical events
are doubted rather than admired, by putting science behind a cloud. I say I have long
ceased to wonder at all this, when we have a misleading system of time at an institu-
tion like onr observatory extravagantly supported by the public purse, whilst useful
science is left without a shilling. • Can it be surprising that agnosticism and theosophy
should find ready soil wherein to flourish when, through the inability of old astronomy
to supply tables of astronomical phenomena, certain “ rain-makers ” assign fabulous
years to'periods of history which our young men after leaving college—and taking
degrees withal—are enable to disprove i If men set up their Dianas of science above
revelation, they must show that their images have a basis on which to stand.


“VOX DEI,”
OR
ECLIPSE LINE OF TIME.
THIRD LINE OF TIME.
As a Solar Eclipse moves through the year in stages of 10 to 11 days, in English
time, every 18 years; or of 1 month, in Ancient Hebrew time, every 54 years
(3,times 18), whenever it occurs we have an unquestionable evidence of the number of
the pastiyears of the world. This rate of motion, like the hand of a clock, brings
back to the date from which it started in 649 years, which is its date-
repeating cycle. We thus only deal with the first eclipse in following this motion
from Creation year, y'.z., from Friday, the Ist day of the 4th month, 0 a.m.

ALL PAST YEARS BY ECLIPSES.
By the recent great advancement of the science of astronomy we now have obtained
six lines of astronomical time, based upon natural and scientific years, by which all
past years are known and consecutively identified. One of these lines is the Eclipse
Cycle, The period between an eclipse and its re-occurrence is 6585 J days which with
the use of English years, amount to 18 years and 10 to 11 days. These extra days pro-
duce three eclipses in a month in the course of 54 years (3 times 18). But by the use of
natural years, beginning with the 20th of September, as did the Cualdean and Ancient
Hebrew years, the 6585 J days through intercalary periods, are 54 years and one month,
and as the years were Luni-Solar, arranged in triplets, the new moons were on or about
the Ist day of every mouth, as shown by the Solar Cycle in this book. Now as there
can be no solar eclipse unless the moon be new, we have, by the use of natural years, a
perfect measure of 54 years for proving all past years, and by which each intervening
year is identified by its own eclipses. Next comes a brilliant and marvellous success.
This month cf progression over 54 years carries an eclipse through the year after 12
periods of 54 years, so that an eclipse repeats its date after 649 years, viz. 648 years and
1 year for the 12 months of progression. Hence 649 years form the Eclipse Cycle.
Investigation shows, as will be hereafter seen, that the first solar eclipse took place on
Friday, the Ist day of the 4th month, in Creation year, 0 a.m. This is the beginning of
the Triple Eclipse Table of this book and the proof is that the eclipse No. 1., Line i.,
in its successive periods of 54 years picks up the ancient records and lands upon our
English line of time, in the same 4th mouth and on the same day of the week.
Creation year is identified by unique physical standards, hereafter explained ; but,
simply, it was when all the cycles of time and planetary motion started together. They
can never resume such positions, nor, owing to their variety and length, could they
have had them previously by natural means. Deducting Usher’s well-known error of
eight years, Creation was 3996 years before the birth of Christ. Oar 1894(t was 5892 J,
a.m. Solar Cycles, which are a record of every day that can occur, also determine this.
Hitherto it has not been possible to arrange eclipses into cycles, because the form of
our English year is not scientific. Therefore under the present circumstances, astron-
omy is divided into two sections—Nautical Astronomy and Chronological Astronomy.
The Greenwich Observatory was established by our Government for the purposes of
Nautical Astronomy and as its years are not those of planetary motion, but legislative,
any intelligent mind will at onoe see that they cannot be applicable for registering
natural phenomena. The disastrous result is, all history is thrown into confusion.
It is however much to be hoped that Government will make the Observatory more
useful by doubling its advantages, so that in addition to observations useful to masters
of ships, it may be employed for historical and higher scientific purposes. We are not
all sailors, and it is equally desirable that controversy should be settled about time as it
was in respect to localities at sea when latitudes and longitudes were introduced.

J. B. DIMBLEBY,


The value of all astronomical science is the accuracy of its calculations, but it Is
impossible to ensure accuracy when we use periods of time which have no natural and
scientific basis. The old school of astronomers to this day have not been able to make
a practical use of astronomy for all mankind, because their solar year, although correct
in length, is not the natural year produced by planetary motion. Hence no tables of
eclipses or transits can be provided for purposes of time or history by years overlapping
those produced by celestial phenomena. But when we use natural years a host of advan-
tages come to our hands. For example, we find that eclipses move in cycles of 649
years, as shown in the margin of this page, when, by having travelled through the year,
they repeat their dates. We also see that these cycles form another of seven,
a.m. and that each of them begins with one of the days of the week, so that in this
P 0 way the eclipses lay down all past years by a method that cannot be disturbed.
649 It is proper, therefore, before showing the number of all past years, that the
reader should first know what a solar year is. Its length, 365 i days, is well
Tk 649 known, but its form is not printed in books. According to the earliest his-
-649 tory. Genesis i., and all scientific investigation, the solar year begins on Sept.
2oth and thus the “ fourth day” was, as now, the autumnal equinox on the
W 1298 23rd, when we have equal day and night all oyer the world. This beginning of
649 the year was observed by the ancients during 3,000 years. There must be
two equinoxes in the year, six months apart. The vernal equinox, is March
Th 1947 22nd, the earth haying then travelled to the opposite side of her orbit round
649 the sun. So that unless we observe a year of this natural form, it cannot have
two equinoxes six months apart, marking off a whole revolution. This is not
M 2596 all. We could not always have 12 new moons in the year, the luuar and solar
649 year would not start together every 649 years, and we should be out of gear
with all planetary motion, including the transits of Mercury and Venus. The
a 3245 medley would be and—with our unscientific form of English year—it really is,
649 like a dozen musicians all playing different tunes. But when we make our
calculations with the use" of natural years, we preserve the uniformity of the
S 3894 clock-like motions of the heavens, and self-constructed tables are ready at our
649 bands, providing, like immovable longitudes, a scientific basis for all history.
Up to the present period men write articles in magazines about past time,
F 4543 which only show bow very ignorant and incapable they are of dealing with
649 the subject, aud what is worse, scientists often quarrel about centuries ! • The
—— British Museum has become a Barnum Show of Curiosities. Men walk about
Th 5192 the Assyrian and Egyptian galleries with gaping months wondering how some
649 ancient monarcbs were born more than a century before their fathers. The
up aud down process of n.o. and a.d. years (?), instead of the straight-forward
W 6841 a.m. year, makes ‘‘confusion worse confounded."
Advancing science has got rid of, all these encumbrances by the use of Chronological
Astronomy, which cannot accept any year without its known eclipses. The work is
superior to Nautical Astronomy by which we sail all over the world using measurements.
The eclipse period is 6585 J days, which are 18 solar years and 10 or 11 days with Eng.
lish years, but the period h just 18 years with Chaldean and Biblical time. The latter
is formed on a system of giving and taking by means of the 6 intercalary periods, one
at the end of every 3rd year. The solar eclipses thereby take place at the beginning and
lunar eclipses in the middle of the month. Instead therefore of eclipses moving through
the year in stages of about 10 days—and thus occurring three times in the month—they
took place three times at one date—say Ist of the 4th month—and then moved a whole >
month forward. They are so shown on the “Triple Eclipse Table,” and are brought from
Creation year down to those we now see without the loss of a day. Proof: the Solar
Cycles show that the first eclipse took place on Friday, the Ist day of the 4th month in
year 0, and coming forward to our time, it occurred again on Friday, Ist of 4th month,
£859, which was Friday, our Jan. 11th, 1861. The junction is complete and is also con-
clusively proved by the Metonic Cycle, transit tables, &c. &c.
FORM OP THE SOLAR YEAR.
Let the annexed circle represent the orhit of the
earth round the snn, completed in 365 i days, a solar
year. A straight line drawn through it must divide
it infotwo halves and the intersecting points must
form two equinoxes always separated by six months.
As the autumnal equinox starts with the Ist month,
(on the right) the vernal must end the sixth month,_
on March 21st. This is the natural year, ft is alsq
the Biblical and scientific year.


The following figures representing the Seasons, Equinoxes, and the positions of the
Sun on the Zodiac in the four quarters of the year, are more descriptive than those
published in other books, and will be easily understood.
At the autumnal equinox, Sept. 23,
(the middle figure of the annexed
triple diagram) the run is direct on
the equator, and the light is parallel
with the axis of the earth, conse-
quently there is equal day and night
all over the world. It is the same at
the vernal equinox about the 22nd of
March, when the earth is on the other
side of the snn. Then on the 21st of
June, (the top figure) the sun is 23J
degrees above the equator, and conse-
quently the northern part of the earth
has most light, and the south is dark
and cold. But on the 21st of Dec.
(represented by the lowest figure of
this triple diagram) the sun has got
to the same distance, 23J degrees,
below the equator, and now the south
has most light whilst the whole of the
arctic regions are in darkness. It is
easy to see that the year can only be-
gin when the srin is on the equinoctial
line, in his maximum position, and
not when he is so far from it. The
science of geometry also teaches this,
whilst everything pertaining to the
motions of the earth and the planets
require it. It is so with the eclipses.
Unless we start when the nodes of the
moon are in the centre of the solar
year, as in creation year, they cannot
be tabulated. Perfect physical ar-
rangements, in agreement with geo-
metrical and astronomical, data must
be regarded if our science is to be true.
Advancing science cannot be bound
to the errors of our predecessors.
It will be understood that the alter-
nate light in the north and south is
not produced by any alteration of the
position of the sun, but entirely by
the obliquity of the axis of the earth
when on opposite sides of the sun.
THE SEASONS.
The following diagram of the ecliptic, (left side) shows the earth on opposite sides
of the snn, which is always on a level with the earth’s centre (the dotted line) called the
ecliptic, but owing to the ob'iqnity of her axis, when on the sun’s left, the equator is be-
low the sun, and when the earth is on the opposite side, the equator is above the sun.
THE ZODIAC.
THE ECLIPTIC.
The result is what we all see. The sun has three places on the Zodiac as shown by
the diagam (bottom figure on the right). About 12 o’clock at noon. Dec. 21st, he is on
the lowest arc: at the two equinoxes in Sept, and March, he is on the middle arc, and
on the 21st'of June he is on the top, and makes a wider circuit of the heavens.


POSITIONS Ob’ THE EARTH AND MOON AT CREATION.
Creation year was phenomenal. It was distinctly marked bv the existence of geo-
metrical and astronomical standards by which it is well identified. Some of these have
already been alluded to, such as the beginning of the solar cycle that year with Sunday
as the first day of the week, the commencement of the .Vletonio cycle "by the Moon, the
starting together of the solar and lunar years, and the splendid positions of the nodes of
the moon in the centre of the solar year. To these must now be added the simulta-
neous and sublime parallel positions of the earth and the moon in their orbits, as shown
in the diagram on this page. Together they form the magnificent starting-post of time
recorded in Genesis i., 399 P, B.c. or 0, a.m., and more so if Mercury and Venus be added,
as they also had their orbits and positions in line with the earth at creation.
It will be seen by this diagram that neither the
orbit of the earth or the moon is a circle, but an
ellipse, but both are parallel in position. This
was the case at the beginning of year 0 a.m.,
otherwise the eclipses could not take place, or be
of the same character as those we now see. The
sun is on the equinoctial line producing equal day
and night, Sep. 23, the “fourth day” of every true
year, and no matter when we now observe the
longitude of the sun or moon, their positions can
be traced back to thos® la the diagram. For ex-
ample, after G 69 lunar years, when the earth is
at the autumnal equinox, as at creation, she
catches the moon in her syzygies, the earth hay-
ing.completed 649 revolutions (solar years). In
other words, the moon is there repeating with
the .earth the phenomena of creation, and three
months afterwards the moon is in.ier node. Nine such periods were completed, as
shown by the total solar eclipse, on,Wednesday, Ist day of the 4tb month, 5841, A.M.,
which was Wednesday night, invisible in London, Dec. 20-21, 1843, a.d. The proof :
5841 divided bv 9 goes 649 times,,,The latter is the eclipse cycle.
The longest tine ia each orbit is the line of apsides of the earth and the moon, and the
short one is the line of syzygies, when the sun, earth, and moon are in conjunction. The
sun is never in the centre of the earth’s orbit, but in the lower focus. This is also the
true position of the earth in respect to the moon’s more oval orbit. Here again, as in
the diagram, the earth and moon had similar positions and were at the point where their
motions began. This is particularly phenominal in the case of the orbit of the moon,
because it twists round in the course of about nine years. Its position at creation was
normal; but when the line of apsides takes the place of the syzygies. by lying, as it
were across the orbit of the earth, the position ia then said to be abnormal, or unnaturaL
The beautiful and normal position of the major axis of the moon’s orbit may therefore
be regarded as a third initial contrivance for geometrical and astronomical perfection.*
Another physical evidence is: The diameter of the earth is 26J miles longer at the
equator than that extending from the poles, so that by gravitation the sun hes a greater
pull on it. Hence we find the equator in its natural position “set” at the point of crea-
tion. like that of the planet Jupiter now; but with a continuance of this position there
could be no seasons.t To obtain seasons the axis of the earth must be oblique in order
that the sun may have angular distances from the equator in Deo. and June, accom-
plished by the annual revolution of the earth. But the greater attraction of the sun on
the equator would overcome this oblique position, therefore to neutralize this “ pull ”
the earth must have a rotatory motion, alternately producing day and night. The
cause of this motion is inexplicable, particularly as Venus, which is nearly as large as
our world, does not possess it. Should the rotatory motion cease, the axis of the earth
would swing back to their natural perpendicular position and we should have no more
“ harvest festivals.” We thus see that the rotatory motion began with the movement
for producing seasons which, as the diagram shows, was at the point of creation. To
these remarks we may add that geology, though yet an imperfect science, shows that at
no remote period, the arctic regions were covered with tropical plan s.
We therefore see that Creation, year 0 a.m., included an arrangement of nlanetary
bodies to accomplish the necessary and definite purposes we now have, and that it has
been our imperfect comprehensions of the sciences—and of time in particular—which
have led to supposed disruptions between science and the sublime facts of revelation, r-
• As the orbit of the moon (assumed to be closed for the purpose of easier comprehension) is tilted 5 degrees above the
ecliptic, and her nodes shift one degree westward every lunation, there could be no central solar eclipse till the end of three
months, Friday, ist of 4th month, when the earth had reached the lower end of her orbit, and the next eclipse when at
the top. in summer. The two nodes beautifully produced the eclipses in the centre of the true year—lll f 11111) f 11I—
f When the earth reaches the lower part ot her orbit on Dec. aist, the equator is 33} degrees below the sun, and when at
the top, the sun is the same distance above the equator. Hence the movement for obtaining these angular distances of the
great luminary of day from the equator must begin at the Creation. They could begin no where else for the seasons*

THE COMMON TEAM OF ECLIPSES OCCURRING EVERY 18 YEARS.
For many years astronomers hive known that all eclipses occur again after 18 years,
but it was unknown as to which was the first year of a series of 18. We were in the
position of an untutored African who had ascertained that there were seven days in a
week, but did not know which was its first day. The valuable and useful discovery of
the first year of the series of 18, was the work of Chronological Astronomy, as were also
the discovery of the first month of the solar year, and numerous other things which
have won great attention to this science. Having obtained a knowledge of the order of
the 18 years, we can give an unchanging number to each eclipse and supply the consecu-
tive years to the lines. We then follow No. 1, Line i, by its date through all past years.
We can do the same with all the other 69, and identify any ancient eclipse.
Eclipses: © Total Sun. * Partial Sun. £ Total Moon. ($ Partial Moon.
The XVHI lines represent 18 years, which numerically change as time rolls on. They
are however enumerated in this table by way of illustration, showing, on the left, the
first 18. The 70 eclipses which occur in 18 years move bodily through the year from
left to right as if they were painted on canvass, so that after 36 of these 18 years they
are all back again having the same positions and repeating their dates as in the first 18
years. The period of their progression is by stages of one month in 54 years (3 times 18)
when natural and scientific years are in use (that is Biblical); but with English years,
the eclipses are carried through the year in stages of 10 to 11 days more than 18 years
so that an eclipse will occur, as a rule, three times in one month, but each 18 years apart.
The 36 times 18 years are 648 years, bat with one year for progression, the period is 649
years, which is the cycle. They then start afresh. This should be understood, because
the date of any eclipse gives us all past time and the true year of the world.
The ecVp es do not leave their lines, nor do they get out of one team into another,
when natural years (commencing Sept. 20th) are used; but I regret to say that our
English form of year drags the eclipses far into other lines and partly ruptures the team,
by sometimes having the first eclipse in Line xviii. and vice versa. See diagrams.
In the Triple Eclipse Table it will be seen that No. 1 eclipse occurred in 1262, then
in 2524 (twice 1262), then thrice the period, 3786, and lastly four times, 5048. The
result of which is, this 1262 proves the first year and first eclipse! For confirmation of
this period of 1202, and accuracy of m> table of eclipses, see the German work “ Kaunon
der Finsternissen,’’ (Canon of Eclipses) and “The Life-History of a Solar Eclipse,”
by Mr. Maunder, of the Greenwich Observatory, printed in “ Knowledge,” Oct., 1893.
This 1262 is made up of the three great periods of 70, 850, aud 1260, by which the
“times ” of the world’s history is predicted in Scripture, and carried out by the events
of history we see accomplished and accomplishing. Thus, 70 times 18 are 1260. With
English years the eclipses occur after 18 years and 10 or XI days, and it is these which'
form the 2 years making 1260 into 1262, namely 720 days of twice 369.
By the use of these 18 years, which I have named the Historical Cycle, all history is
displayed as pictures before our eyes, and astronomy is made practically as useful to
us as it is to navigation. We double the utility of a sublime science and place all his-
tory on a scientific basis. Following the first eclipse from Creation (whatever that epoch
means), we pick up accurately its ancient records, finally landing it in our own times. In
fact every eclipse preserves its number, line, aud day of the week when it occurs.

TWO CONSECUTIVE TEAMS OF 70 ECLIPSES WITH ENGLISH YEARS
COMPARED SHOWING IDENTITY AND KEPETITION.
The following two teams, each in a period of 18 years, occurred as dated, and are the
Ist-and 2nd teams of the 10th Cycle consisting of 36 teams in 649 years. By this
arrangement it will be seen how the same eclipse repeats itself after 18 years and 10 or
11 days with the English form of the solar year. There are xviii Lines for the 18 years.
The Ist eclipse, dated Jan. Ist, toot place on the previous day, Doc. 31st, 1842, but it is
•brought forward a few hours, to show its proper line. All the others are correctly dated.
As the English form of the solar year overlaps the natural and scientific year three
months, the eclipses, to suit our fictitious dating, are dragged from the ends of the lines
and placed three months in another. This does not occur with Biblical and Chaldean
years. To see this, compare the Bird’s Eye Views of Eclipses. Transits and Eclipses
published in tables are the triumphs of Chronological Astronomy.

86 teams. The cycle is thus 649 years, when the eclipses are all back
again as above represented. They show ns all past years, and as there
are seven cycles, each having one of the days of the week, we cannot
mistake the numerical order of years from creation, because the above
team began the first 18 years, the solar eclipse © at the top is No, 1,
Lino 1., on the Ist day of 4tb mouth. With natural, or Biblical years,
eclipses never leave their lines- The years on the left arc the first of
the present triple team, beginning 5841. Proof; Multiply the cycle of
649 years by 9 (the number of past cycles) and the result is 6841, This
was opr 1843, Deo. 21st, the beginning of the 4th month, true solar time-

These are the 70 eclipses which constitute the Team. They all
occur in 18 solar years. As the years are lunar, but made solar by the
Intercalary month at the end of every 3rd year, the eclipses of the sun
take place at the beginning of a month, and those of the moon in the
middle of the month, (After occurring three times on the same date
daring ‘,4 years, which are 3 times 18, the eclipses move into the next
month and occur three times again in the same period, and so pass
through the year in 648 years. It is the intercalary month which is

EXAMPLE OF ECLIPSES MOVING THEODGH THE SOLAE TEAE.
The following table gives an example of the Central Solar Eclipse No I, Line I-, moving
through the solar year, owing to the 10 or 11 days beyond 18 years when the eclipse occurs.
I) will be seen that the progression of 10 days allows the eclipse, as a rule, to occur three
times in one month, and that as 12 times 0 are 360, it moves through (heyear of 365 days
in 651 years when it must repeat its date or nearly so. Eclipse* do not leave their hues.
The a.d. dates are extracts from “ L’Art de Verifier les Dates.” which gives the eclipses
as endorsed by the Observatory at Paris, and as France adopted the New Style of dating in
1582, the dates previous to that year are corrected 11 days to show the working of the cycle.
All the eclipses for the a.d. years are not given in the Bool; fijjm" which’the dates in the
column to the right are extracted.
The great value of this table of 651 years is its practical importance. It gives us a mea-
suring line, astronomically determined, which will carry ns back through all past time
more correctly than the mariner’s compass will lead us overthcr world. By its use we find
what were the eclipses of the first year, 0 a.m. (See“ Guage Proving All Past Time’’). It
•also shows us us the day of the week with which each year began, and thus ratifies the
■date of the first seventh day as Saturday, the seventh day of the first year and month.
Thus No. 1 occurred again on Jan 11, 1861, beginning another Cycle, and also in 1879.
The first column is the same as given in the List of “ Astronomical Tears.’ 1 The reason
tvhy the years are not always 18 years is because the solar year overlaps the lunar, and
therefore sometimes computes one more (19).
All the eclipses, as set out in the Bird’s Eye View of Eclipses, could be tabulated in the
above form by beginning them in the month which that Diagram places them, but more
particularly eclipses of the moon, because they do not vary like those of the sun, as seen by
.looking at Two Consecutive Teams Compared.
The astronomical years on the left are true time, and the right what we have erroneously made.

eclipses in the 3rd month. See 1st col. Triple Eclipse Table.
The month is the same for all the cols, across the table.
The numerals refer to the year of the Luni-Solar Cycle of
the Antediluvians, which by being the motions of the moon,
is best adapted for eclipse work. Thus, vi. in the top line
means the 6th year of the cycle. On referring to this cycle
it will be seen that the 1st day of the 4th month in the 6th
year was Thursday, as stated in the adjoining column.
We get the day of the week when the eclipse occurred by
this method. This is of service, because when an eclipse
is brought down to our time by the Triple Eclipse Table,
and we find that it occurs in the same period of the year,
and on the same day of the week, we have a good proof that
the line of years is correct from creation. For instance, the
eclipse in 5859, a.m. was on Friday, the 1st day of the 4th
month. This would be Friday, 11th of Jan. 1861. See the
almanack for that year recording the eclipse.
It will be seen, however, that 6877 has not the same day
of the week in onr 1879; but it has when the Antediluvian
Solar Cycle is corrected. The moon gets two days advance
towards the end of the Solar Cycle. This is explained in
“ Important Additions," and the following paragraphs, but
it is set right by the intercalary days.
The present cycle is given as far as it is going, and it is a
splendid proof of the accuracy of the working of the table
and the number of all past years. Of course the reader will
understand that there can be no eclipse of the sun without
the moon being new, and as she is new on or about the first
day of every month on the Biblical, or Ancient Hebrew
Solar Cycle, it is a manifest conclusion that the eclipse No.
1., Line I. comes down from Creation year in regular stages
of 18 years,—which are one cycle (15) and 3 years—moving
a month in 54 years, i. e. after three eclipses of 18 yrs. each.

ALL PAST TEARS OBTAINED BY ECLIPSES,
The following is the 9th, or last cycle, of the “ Triple Eclipse Table,” which is here
printed with additional explanations, since the other stereotyped pages were published.
The eclipse dealt with is No. 1. in Line I. of the “ Ancient Hebrew Birds’s Eye View
of a Team of 70 Eoiipses,” so that as they each occur again after 18 years, this total
solar eclipse © which occurred on Friday, the Ist day of the 4th month in Creation year,
0 a.jc., has re-occurred in every subsequent 18th year. It has, however, a progressive
movement of one month after 54 years (3 times 18 are 54), This movement carries it
through the year in monthly stages in the course of 648 years. Twelve movements of
64 years each are 648 years. Bat the 12 months progression cover another year and
thus makes the 648 into 649 years. This is the date-repeating cycle because it brings
this No. 1. eclipse back again to Friday, the Ist day of the 4th month where it started
in Creation year. If the reader comprehends these explanations, all will be clear.
As stated elsewhere in this book, no table of eclipses can be formed unless we start at
the point of time given us iu Genesis i., nor can the years of the world be tabulated
without beginning at the same place. This explains why every seventh year of all the
astronomical lines of time are also the Sabbatic years of Biblical history.
If our astronomy had not been below revelation, all this would have been known
years ago. Itevelation has not required to be raised up to science, bnt our science has
had to be improved so as to be elevated to the standard of revelation.
The 18 at the foot of the adjoining col. is to show that there are 18 years more in the
cycle than represented by the year 5823, which in fact is the beginning of the last 18.


IMPORTANT ADDITIONS.
The day of the week for an eclipse, No. 1, is right for all years of the Antediluvian
Solar Cycle i. ii. and iii., bat when the year is iv, one day more must be given; when
v. one and a half; when vi. two days must be added, and when vii, three. In other
■words, v. when printed Sunday, becomes Tuesday; vi. when Friday, becomes Monday.
These irregularities are known to mathematical astronomers as periodical disturb*
ances, called “the erection,” “variation,” and “annual equation,” by which the velocity
and longitude of the moon are affected. They have been a source of great trouble to all
mathematical calculations, when extended over several centuries, but as their amount
or value is known, allowance is made for them, but in bridging over difficulties of this
kind, experience shows that it is best to use the Metonic Cycle, because by it we can
bring any remote new moon, or eclipse, down to the same day of the week of our own
times. Reference is made to this in another part of “All Fast Time,” and I wish it
was better known to astronomers who seek accuracy.
The result of this is the eclipse of the third example, for 5877 our 1879, took place on
Tuesday. The Metonic Table places it there and it is so recorded in all almanacks. The
irregularity is really a confirmation of the Triple Table, but can form no part of it.
EXPLANATION OF THE TRIPLE ECLIPSE TABLE.
The Cycle Year is the year on the Antediluvian Luni-Solar Cycle of seven years, thus
i. is the first year and v. is the fifth, and so on. It is necessary to use this cycle because
it is purely a table of the motions of the moon for seven years not disturbed by inter-
calary days, and as such it is the best and most useful astronomical table in existence.
It was made solar by the clever Antediluvian patriarchs at the end of seven years, but
with such precision as not to disturb its form. It is also necessary to use it in order to
work the Metonic Cycle and the Cycles of Eclipses, Transits, &0., which move on the
basis of the line of seven days in Gen. i., producing time and planetary motion for ever.
The months in Section 1 are the same across the page. The 12 months are consecu-
tively stated, and the day mentioned is always the first day of the month. These days
have not the same dates on tbe Solar Cycles of the Ancient Hebrews or ours.
All the years stated are by the addition of 18—which is the precise period of the re-
occurrence of the same eclipse with ancient Hebrew time —and therefore there ate three
times 18, or 54 years in every three examples. The reason of this is, there can be no
eclipse unless the moon is new and thus the first day of every 18 th yean Another reason
is, on the Ancient Hebrew Solar Cycle an eclipse occurred thrice on one date, because it
could not move into the middle of a lunar year. We have three eclipses in same month.
© 595 There are 36 eclipses of No. 1 in each section, which at 18 years © 1262
595 each, are 648 years, but when the Ist month is reached, another year 1262
—. has to be computed by the 18 becoming 19. It is marked thus —, Tbe
©ll9O total number of each section is therefore 649. The consecutive order © 2524
595 of these mouths and years shows that no year can be omitted. Tbe 1262
ruling periods of the eclipse are 595 and 1262 years. For the first lam ■
©1785 to some extent indebted to Sir George Airy, who, when he was the © 3786
*594 Astronomer Royal, called my attention to some features in a French 1262
work, “ L’Art de Verifier les Dates par Eclipses.” For the 1262 period
©2379 I acknowledge the observations of Mr. Maunders, the first assistant at © 5048
695 the Greenwich Observatory, with whom I met on three occasions at 1262
supper in the AVest of London. He referred to aGerman work “Kannon
©2974 der Finsternissen,” (Canon of the Eclipses) in which 1262 is the lead- 6310
695 ing principle. The 18 years are formed of 223 lunations, known as —.
the “Saros” amongst the Babylonians and Egyptians. But it will
©3569 not work with years enacted by our Parliament for 1000 years without ©
695 re-adjustment after that period. There is, however, no trouble with it
in respect to natural or Biblical years. There are 70 Satii in 1260 years, or
©4164 which is a prophetical period. The 2 additional years, making 1260 © 1244
595 into 1262 are obtained by ennumeration, or twice using 19 years at 1262
tbe beginning of the let month. Otherwise it is 594 and 666, the 1262
©4759 latter being another period of Scripture. 1262
595 I have published another Eclipse Cycle—one of 651 years—but it is
to work both tbe solar eclipses Nos. 1 and 2, in Creation year and has © 5030
5354 been misunderstood. It was produced to work our spurious and broken 1262
595 English years, by carrying new moons through the month. There does
not seem to be any other way. Eclipses must go through our years so © 6292
long as the year begins with January. When will men be wise ? 18
* 1 year less because 2379 occurs before the new year. © 6310


DISTINCTION BETWEEN ECLIPSE PERIODS AND DATES.
No. 1. occurs 36 times in 648 years, to which 1 year is added for historical enumeration.
No. 1. occurs 34 times in 612 years, to which 1 year is added for do.
Total 70 times 1260 solar years and 2 added. 70 eclipses tabulate 1262 years.
Explanation—When an eclipse has run through the year in periods of just 18 years of
Biblical time (which is 18 years and 10 or 11 days of English time), its next occurrence
is 19 years after its first appearance in the cycle. That is to say, the 10 to 11 days over
the solar year, or month in the case of Biblical time, have accumulated into one year
during 12 months. There are nearly two of these accumulation periods in 70 occur-
ences of the same eclipse, so that the general period is just 18 solar years—l26o.
• The true practical period is 360 days, called a “ prophetic year. ” This will be further
seen by the fact that this is the standard for measuring a circle, either in astronomy
by dividing the heavens, or in navigation by dividing the surface of the globe. It is
thus the period of the eclipses. See the table of the Eclipse Chronometer, based on 360,
or the Triple Eclipse Table, based on 720, (twice 360) which produces all the table when,
the 1 year of progress is added.
The accuracy of the Triple Eclipse Table is seen by the fact that the length of the
cycle, 649 years, produces any eclipse on the same line in the next cycle. The
table, like those of the transits, is self-constructive, because transits also keep 7 days.
THE ORIGIN OF SCIENTIFIC TIME.
As a book of scientific precision, the Biblical standards of time are 7 days, 18, 70;
360, 1260 and 2520 years. These, with 354 days of the lunar year, are astronomical and
geometrical; and the ancient solar cycle and the Metonio cycle, together with all plan-
etary motion show that they were in the Bible before they were known by mankind.
The 360 years are a “time,” and “time (1), times (2), and half a time” are 1260, the
period during which the four universal empires of Babylonia, Medo-Persia, Greece,
and Rome continued. The “seven times’’ mentioned in Leviticus xxvi. 24 and 23. are
therefore 2520, (twice 1260, or seven times 360. What could Euclid, the father of
mathematics, who was not born till three centuries before Christ, have done without
this Biblical standard of 360 which begins in the first chapter of Genesis ? How is it
that the Metonio cycle, discovered in the 4th century before Christ and cut in letters
of solid gold by the ancient Grecians, starts with the “first day’’ in Genesis, bringing
the new moons at the beginning of the months of the first seven years down to the-
same days of the week in our own times? We can do any thing of an astronomical
or scientific character with Biblical periods. It was within the covers of the Bible
that I found all the eclipses and transits and their cycles, but they have not been pro-
duced to this day by any other means, and cannot be formed by any one of the dozen
pagan forms of years which have darkened the minds of men.
The Eclipse Cycles start afresh after seven cycles because the seven days are com-
pleted. Daniel’s 70 weeks and his 1260 years are eclipse periods.
HOW TO GET RID OF DARKNESS AND ERROR,
The following will show the progress of No. 1 eclipse, Line i. from the epoch of
Creation through all past years to its appearance before our own eyes. It will also-
illustrate the working of the Triple Eclipse Table and Team of 70 in Lines.

There are 18 years in each lor i, which represent a team having 70 eclipses. The
36 teams are two series of 18-year teams. These 36 form the cycle of 649 years. The
i represents the end of 3 teams, 54 years, when the extra 30 days are picked up which
mores the solar eclipse to the Ist day of the next month. The motion is simple like a.
clock and has this advantage—the position of the eclipse iu the year gives the number
of years from the epoch of Creation, Away goes the darkness of men’s minds!

THE NUMBER OFP DAYS IN THE ECLIPSE PERIOD.
As stated in all books of astronomy, the period between an eclipse and its re-occurrence
is 6585 days and 8 hours (one-third), which works as 18 solar years and 10 to 11 days.
The period manipulates with different years as follows:
English Time. Days. Lunar Time. Days.
18 solar years 365} days 6575 18 lunar years of 354 days 6372
10 days and one-third progression 7 months of 30 or 29 days 207

instead of the usual 29 days to the 12th month of the 9th
year of the Cycle }} do.
Producing the same total 6385}
In reference to the Ancient Hebrew Solar Cycle, I have previously explained that
all solar cycles must form in seven years, i.e. 7,14, 21, or 28, and for some time I was
troubled to find that all the dates and periods of Scripture worked on one of 15. I then
saw that I had accidentally made an error at the bottom of the 9th year, which does
not continue to the 10th year. But by working it out, I found that the Cycle was one of
21 years (3 times 7) and that 6 years had been amputated between the 9th and the 16th.
The error, though accidental, was very fortunate. Had I not made it, I could not have
gone on. The amputation cleverly secures some important astronomical advantages.
A MARVELLOUS AND BRILLIANT RESULT.
ANOTHER GREAT PROOF OF THE DATE OF CREATION.
By the use of the Metonic Cycle of 19 years, and the Antediluvian Solar Cycle of 7,
the two meet after 133 years and produce Creation year beginning with Sunday. We
Can thereby bring the form of Creation year and the days of the week when the moon
was new throughout seven years, down to our own times. The point of creation was
Sunday, 20th Sept, and the sun was on the equinoctial colure on the “ fourth day.” We
had both these facts in Sept. 1846, which was the first day of 5845, a.m. as worked down
in periods of 133 years. We thus find that the first seven Antediluvian lunar years
synchronize with our time from Sunday, Sept., 20th 1846, to Saturday, July 17tb, 1852,
both days inclusive, and the moon, we find by our almanacks, was new on the same days
of the week. The method of proving all this is as follows. Write on paper each montii
of the seven Antediluvian years from the Solar Cycle, day and date, and also the day
and date from our Almanacks, which must be placed opposite. Thus—
• 5 1 ... Sept. 20
M 2... 21
Tv 3 ... 22
W 4 ... 23
Tit 5 ... 24
F 6 ... 25
S 7 ... 26
The result is as follows
The Antediluvian months have alternately 30 and 29 days,' and
in our leap years, 1848 and 1852 give 29 days in February. The
table will prove each month by noticing the day of the week with
the date in the almanack corresponding with that of the Antedi-
luvian Cycle. At the beginning of each Antediluvian year add
from the Almanack the new moon, on the first day also, althougn
not in its place then, or as a luminary.
Using 1 day extra in the intercalary month (34) twice in 6 years, the Ancient Hebrew
Solar Cycle kept the moon at the beginning of all the months. In the last year the
moon was new early in the morning. The above is the illustration of the acceleration
of the moon’s motion referred to respecting the Triple Eclipse Table, but arising partly
from the secular diminution of the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit. We see how the
lunar year was floated on to keep up with the moon. The above proves all past years,
and the date of Creation, with which the Metonic Cycle, and indeed all cycles, begin.

The smallest circle represents the Period Cycle of 18 years and 10 days, when
any eclipse, say No. 1, again occurs. The middle circle is the Sectton or Cycle of 619
years, when the eclipse repeats its date. Its revolution is 36 times the small circle, or
twice 18 as in the annexed tabic. The largest circle represents the Maximum Cycle.
Its revolution is the 9 Sections or Cycles of 649 years— 6841, a.m., or Dec. 21, 1843. a.d.
SUMMARY AND PROOFS OF ACCURACY.
It will be seen that there are nine sections in the Triple Eclipse Table. There are 35
eclipse periods of 18 years in each section, which with 1 year for progress of the eclipse
through the year, make a total for the section or cycle of 649 years.
The last eclipse in the table is 5823, so that when its period of 18 years are fulfilled,
the year 6841 is reached, which is the length of the whole table —9 times 649 are 5841.
Now 5841 divided by 18 goes 324 times and 9 over. This is a grand proof, because
the length of each half section (shown in the subjoined table) is 324 J years. Thus 18
times 6 months are 9 years, which are produced by the month of progression in Ancient
Hebrew time, or the 10 days of English time. 36 times 10 days are 360, in either case.
The subjoined table is a proof of the working of the dates according to our English
time. The years and months would be the same it the table was constructed for Ancient
Hebrewtime, but the day would always be Ist of the month. It will be seen that there
would be 9 tables similar to this given, and that each would contain 649 years, and
begin with the Ist day of the 4th month, which all investigation shows was the date
of the first eclipse, year 0, on Friday. The 2 eclipses had 3 months each end of the year.
As all correct tables form themselves, it will be seen that the subjoined is but simple
addition by continually adding 18 years and 10,days, and also that the second column
is obtained by adding, in every case, 324fc years to the date of each eclipse in the first
col. It is thus time carried on by eclipses totalled in two ways. Again, the total of the
periods in the centre is also that of all the nine tables. 5841 years.
The above years are the same as in the Triple Kclipse Table, and the next section
will begin 649 4 1. 0 is the solar eclipse starting the cycles.


It will be seen by these pages how the first eclipse, No. 1, Line i., can be traced from
creation year to the present period in cycles of 649 years, and that its date on Friday,
the Ist day of the 4th month, shows that the year was one when the solar and lunar
years began together, as history states. Nothing, indeed is capable of greater proof
because we have other evidences of indisputable character, such as the natural succes-
sion of the solar cycles, the Metonic cycle, the life-history of eclipses and two transit
tables. It is also clear that we can identify each eclipse cycle by its day of the week,
whilst we must all admit that the date or monthly position of an eclipse indicates the
year of the cycle when it occurs. We can now proceed,
HOW TO FIND ANCIENT ECLIPSES BY THE CYCLES.
History states that the troops of Alexander the Great were alarmed by a total eclipse
of the moon 0 the night before the final battle when he defeated Darius Condimanus,
the last of the Persian monarchs, in 332, u.c. which deducted from 4004 is 3672.

By history we learn that Shalmaneser 11., (whose deeds recorded on a black obelisk

3284 was the 3rd year of the cycle, and this is the meaning of the verse.
I have a score or more of ancient eclipse records, but there is no trouble with any of
them, and I trust the reader will see that this system of dealing with eclipses is the
best. It is simplest and hrs the useful advantage of preserving the identity of all the
eclipses. Mathematical calculations are admirable for continued uniform motion, but
the movements of the moon are subject to increased velocities and disturbances, too
technical to bo explained here, so that when we cannot work with a motion “straight
off the reel,” but are hampered with what are known as “ the evection,’’ “ variation,”
and the “ annual equation,” outside computations haye to be adopted to rectify the
longitude of the moon, and numerous minor inequalities allowed for, all of which tend
to make mathematical calculations unreliable. Of course we are in all such cases
dependent upon the position of the line of apsides, the action of the tangential force,
and eccentricity of the orbit of the earth. But the Biblical form of the solar year ma-
jestically carries us over all these complications and brings eclipses more as events of
known conclusion and observation rather than of abstruse algebraic determinations in
the hands of a few. I might also add that the system here given can supply not only
the date of the month but also the day of the week for all eclipses past or to come.
The Ancient Hebrew and Chaldean Solar Cycle of 15 years—evidently amputated
from 21 for astronomical purposes—is annexed. It shows how the eclipses could occur
on the Ist day of every 18th year. The years are lunar (354 days) but made solar by
extra 34 days at the end of the 3rd year, of which there are 6 in 18 years.

TRACKING AFTER THE FIRST
ECLIPSE.
THUS FAR AND NO FARTHER.
The Date of Creation proved by the first Solar Eclipse, on Friday, the Ist day
of the 4th month, year 0 a.m.
In the latter part of 1883, a. 0., two gentlemen, residing far fiom each other, wrote
asking for the precise date of the first solar eclipse. The question was regarded as a
difficult one, though it was not considered as one which could never be answered. Ac-
cordingly after the subject had been entertained for about two months by occasional in-
vestigation, it tell to my lot to find out how the work was to be done. I felt sure that
the precise date could be obtained if we could find out how to do it. Ultimately, after
looking at the subject, and trying over several methods, a way was discovered for solving
the question. But much figuring was required to work out the details on the basis of
four methods, one of which was bound to be correct. The requisite calculations for
determine this point, and thereby fixing the actual day of the week and date of the
month when the first solar eclipse occurred, were undertaken by four gentlemen con
nected with the Chronological and Astronomical Association. The year had already
been determined and published in All Past Time. It was known that it was one of the
three solar eclipses of Line I. of the diagram of eclipses given as those of the Christian
era, and occurring in the year 1861, a.d., that year being the commencement of a series
of 651 years, when by the natural working of the cycle of the eclipses for 18 years and
11 days, they all begin again by repeating their dates. If the reader looks at the dia-
gram of eclipses in the Christian era, he will see Line I. as follows :
The dates of the eclipses in this Line L taken from the almanacks of 1861, are, ©
Total eclipse of the sun, January llth—l2th: ©July Bth, and © Deo. 31st. The
partial lunar eclipse O is Dec. 17th, but it forms no part of the present enquiry.
The result of all the calculations made by these four gentlemen was that the first
solar eclipse occurred on Friday, the Ist day of the 4th mouth. The successful calcu-
lator was Mr. Henry Sweeney, who worked out the figures according to the instructions
he received. When he handed these calculations to- me I was really overjoyed with the
result, because they not only proved the date, and day of the week, as I expected, but
also provided a most important and arbitrary factor for determining several interesting
things, viz:
1. It shows that the first year began with Sunday.
2. It proves that the first Sabbath was the 7th of the month, Saturday.
3. As the eclipse always occurred on Friday, as the ancients tell us, it shows the
week has never been broken, because it takes place now on Friday.
4. It supplies the number of Sabbaths since Creation to the present time.
6. It determines the number of all past years and the day of the week when each began.


The following is the manner in which the date of the first solar eclipse is determined
to have been on Friday the Ist day of the 4th month, in year 0, which was astronomical
year 1, because it is not past time, but present motion, which forms time, that we are
dealing with.
Figure 1.
Here we have three total eclipses of the sun, on January Mth, July Bth, and Deo-
81st. There can be no solar eclipse unless the moon is new. Hence the almanacks for
1861, a.d., from which this example is given state that the moon was new on three
dates of the above eclipses.
As the lunar year begins with a hew moon as shown in another part of this book, a
new moon must begin each lunar month, or the day before when the month is but 29
days, so that there are 12 new moons in the course of a lunar year, viz. on or just
before the Ist day of each lunar month.
This is shown also by the dates of the above eclipse. For instance Figure 1. is a
solar year of 365 days, and as eclipse C occurred on the last day of 1861, a.d., (31st
Dec.) the eclipse A could only take place on the 11th January, because when 11 days
are deducted from 365 of the solar year, there are 354 left, which is the length of the
lunar year.
Therefore the eclipses A and C are the beginning and ending of a lunar or Biblical
year, and prove the length of it. It is a valuable astronomical measurement, because no
man can alter it, and when used is applicable for many purposes. Our solar year of
365 i days is a correct period, but it is of no practical value, because, unlike the lunar
year, it has nothing to mark its beginning or end, and can therefore be started on any
day of the 365. We have begun it on three different dates, and for a long time we
began the solar year on March 21st.
Hence as the eclipses A and C are astronomical indications of the beginning and end
of the lunar year, it is not possible for men to alter the time when the lunar year begins,
nor lengthen or shorten it. The moon is 29J days going round the earth. The ancients
therefore constructed the length of the twelve months of the lunar year (which was the
only year they divided into months and dates) by giving them alternately 30 and 29
days. They borrowed the half day from every other 2nd month. Thus the twelve
months systematically and astronomically contained the following days;
30, 29, 30, 29, 30, 29, 30, 29, 80, 29, 30, 29.—Total 354.
The ancients never thought of altering the length of a lunar year. They could not do
so, any more than we can alter the length of an hour. So that when we also find how
|o determine the number of years between the eclipses, we can prove all past time.
The eclipse Bis in the middle of the lunar year. Thus in Figure 1. Atoß is 177
days, or from BtoC is 177 days. Twice 177 are 354. Thus 30, 29, 30, 29, 30,29. —
Total 177- We therefore see that eclipse Bis between 29th of 6th month and Ist of 7th
month of the lunar year. They divide the lunar year, like a two-foot rule, as follows :
Figure 2.
In point of fact although the two lines form the lunar year, one of them is the mea-
sure with which we have to deal, because it is the period which exists between two
eclipses. The line A cannot be shortened without B commencing earlier, which it can-
not do.
.Now the question arises, as we see that there are 177 days between these two eclipses,
and 354 inclusive ir. three eclipses, or the lunar year, have there always been 354 days
in the lunar year ? In other words has the moon always had the same orbit 1 This had
been doubted by some astronomers, because by their system of measurement the
eclipses were thought to be earlier than in ancient times. This doubt has however been
abandoned. Indeed it must, because it is evident by the ten dates of the flood given us
by Noah for the year 1656, a.m., that there were 354 days in the lunar year when he
lived. Sec (he Flood year 1656 which makes his dates fall on seventh days

Tho figures in this diagram represent the four satellites seen. That nearest Jupiter
is so small that it is only visible by the best three large telescopes. 1. is the first we
see nearest to Jupiter, and 4. is that which is most distant from him. Where the black
disc 0 occurs, it shows that the satellite whose numeral is next to Jupiter is eclipsed
by his extended shadow, or is occulted by being behind him. The sign © repre-
sents that the satellite is in transit, or crossing the disc of the planet, and rc-appears
at that aide where its figure is placed. A dot. indicates the place of a satellite and the

CONFIGURATIONS OF FOUR OF JUPITER'S SATELLITES
Seen by an Inverting Telescope, at 23h.—June, 1887 (5885, A.M.).
This diagram of four o£ the five satellites of Jupiter is printed to show the spiral
motion of the moon round the earth. For example, when we look at Jupiter through
a telescope we see four of his satellites day after day in positions as printed. They are
always in about the same straight line upon which they seem to move to and fro; but.
this is because we see their orbits edge way on, as they are all nearly on the same leveL
If we hold up a saucer nearly level with our eyes, having a fly walking on the edge of
it, the fly would seem to walk backwards and forwards on a straight line. Now by ob-
serving the distance of—say No. 4 satellite—from Jupiter in the centre of each line,
and following its position through all the month, we trace its spiral motion. This is-
because the satellite, whilst revolving round Jupiter is drawn after him as he moves in
his own orbit. It is the same with the moon, which is the satellite of the earth. A.
lunar Cycle must therefore be a record of this motion.
The object glass of a telescope clearly revealing the satellites of Jupiter, should not.
be less in size than a penny. The larger the better. Such telescopes can be bought,
second-hand for 7s, in London. Any person may thus nightly witness the sublime-
phenomena of these motions, watching them for seven days, as something akin to the
power manifested during the seven days of creation. Jupiter is almost 1400 times
larger than the earth, and thunders along in his journey round the sun at the rate of
28,000 miles an hour, carrying with him a family of satellites, one of which is about the
size of the earth. Large as is Jupiter, the giant-planet, his nearest moon sweeps
round him in 11 hours presenting all its phases.


TRANSITS.
FOURTH AND FIFTH LINES OF TIME.
8 Transits of Venus in 486 years.
15 Transits of Mercury in 92 years.
Unlike Eclipses, Transits are immovable phenomena, always occurring at the same
period of the year. They thus in a simple but powerful way control all past time.
Owing to the regularity of the changing nodes of the planets, Yenus and Mercury,
when in transit, neither of the lines of time which they produce can be disturbed.
They therefore show what amount of time is possible for the events of history and
what is impossible when more years are assigned to history than these lines will allow.
In a word, transits are the pillars of scientific time.


EXPLANATION OF TRANSITS.
A transit means a planet moving across the face of the sun, as shown by two examples in
figure 1., and as our earth is the third planet from the sun, round which all planets move in
circles, called their orbits, transits can only occur by Mercury and Venus, tbefirst and second
planets, when they come in a line with us, that is between the earth and the sun. On such
occasions, if they were near enough to us, or were as large as the sun, they would totally
eclipse that great luminary, instead of appearing like small black balls on the sun’s face or
disk. The earth moves in nearly a circle having the sun about 93,001,000 of miles from it
in the centre. Venus, which is nearly as large as the earth, revolves in a smaller circle,
about 68,000,000 of miles from the sun, and Mercury which is not half the size of our globe,
moves round the great central luminary at a distance from him of about 33,000,000 miles.
The stars, which are distant suns, and like him, shining by their own light, cannot make
transits. Their distance is so great that they appear to us about the size of planets, but they
twinkle, whilst the planets shine with a steady light, because it is reflected and derived
from the sun. Planets, also, when seen through a telescope, are round like the moon, but
stars have the same appearance when seen by the best glasses. Hence, in respect to plan-
ets, when they are seen sailing across the face of the sun, they are black, because their dark,
or night side is towards the earth. Transits will last six hours. When in the descending
node, the direction of the dotted path-line, Fig. 1., is downwards from left to right.
Figure 1.
Two Transits of Venus,
in ascending nodes.
Figure 2.
Showing the Earth opposite the ascending node
of Venus in Transit.
The two points of the orbit of Venus, when she is opposite the earth, are called her nodes,
in one of which she must be in order to be seen in transit. Figure 2 represents the orbits
of the Earth and Venus seen side way on. Jf is the Sun, ois Venus in her orbit (the
small circle), and Qis the Earth in her orbit (the larger circle). The orbit of Venus does
not cross or extend beyond that of the Earth, but is necessarily drawn so to show that it
it is not on the same level as that of the Earth. The upper end of the orbit of Venus is
higher, and the bottom end lower than the ecliptic, or level of the earth. Hence Venus can
only be seen to make a transit when the Earth is opposite to her nodes where she rises to
the level of the earth where she is placed in the figure, or descends below it. marked thus
The former is called her ascending, and the latter her descending node. The Earth is oppo-
site the ascending node about the 6th of Dec., and opposite the descending node • about
tbe 6th of June every year. But as Venus goes round the sun 13 times to the Earth 8, she
cannot always be in one of her nodes when the Girth passes them. This is the case once
after the eight years, but the variation is sufficient to place the two planets out of a direct
line in the 16 th year, and thus we have to wait 122 years to witness the third transit of a
team,*which we catch at the descending node. Having reached that position, the general
regularity of the 13 revolutions of Venus to eight of the Earth, gives us the opportunity of
seeing another after eight years in the same node, the fourth transit of the team. After
this the same slight irregularity requires us to wait 105 years, when we catch the fifth
transit of the team, and are back again opposite the ascending node. Thus the transits go
on until the team of eight transits is completed in 486 years, there being also always 48#
years between one transit and another of the same class.
Such is the beautiful science of Chronology, which is astronomy practically applied la
ttw accurate determination of all past time.


ALL THE TRANSITS OF VENUS.
THE FOURTH LINE OF TIME.
There are eight Transits of Venus in a Team. They occur in a period of 486 years,
11 ence it follows that there are 480 years between a transit of the same character and num-
tcr in each team produced by the following intervals namely:
In Astronomical Years: 8, 121, 8, 106, 8, 121, 8, 106—486.
In Anno Domini Years: 8, 122, 8, 105, 8, 122, 8, 105—486.
Transits work on the same principle as eclipses. There are 18 years during which a team
of eclipses occur, and therefore there are 18 years between an eclipse of the same char-
acter and number.
To reverse transits to the first after the Mosaic Creation, it is necessary to do so upon
astronomical years, first because there were no a.d. years before 4,000, and secondly owing
to the erroneous computation of the a.d. year which is one year and nine months in ad-
vance of the a.u. or historical year, and nine months in advance of the astronomical year.
The last three mouths of our year are the first three of the astronomical, because the
Christian year begins with January instead of in Sept., and this makes the Transits of the
ascending node of Venus to occur in the same astronomical year. The first astronomical
year, since time was instituted, was 0, a.m., because the latter is reckoned as time past.
The a.m. year of a transit is therefore always one year less than the astronomical. Without
this arrangement transits could not be correctly tabulated, because our Christian year is
one year and nine mouths in advance of true time, or a.m. year. Astronomical phenomena
are present occurrences of motion, but the age of the world and a man "is history, or past
time. The Biblical year, which is the a.h. year, and the astronomical, or scientific year,
both commence in September and on the same day. This is an important explanation, the
failure to comprehend which was the means of the edition of “All Past Time for 1880 ” be-
ing unfavourably reviewed by a publication of some astronomical character, but the title
of which it would now be cruel to mention.
This transit line of astronomical time is the same as that obtained from the eclipses, the
periodical difference of “ one year after,” or “ one year before,” is owing to lunar years
and the central solar eclipse No. 2. taking the place of No-1., as soon as it reaches January,
through the operation of the 10 or 11 days beyond 18 years. Or it may be explained by
stating that eclipses are lunar years and transits essentially solar years. This will be seen
by noticing in the “ Bird’s Eye View of the Eclipses in the Christian Era,” that the first
eclipse, in 1861, was No. 1. and occurred on the 11th of January, and the last one, No. 4,
took place on the 31st of Dec., embracing a period of 354 days, or lunar year. In the next
place it will be evident to the reader that in respect to transits, we cannot see them unless
the earth is in that particular part of her orbit opposite to the node of a planet in transit,
and that this part of the earth’s orbit can only be reached in a solar year, which means a
complete revolution of the earth in its orbit round the sun.
The practical value of the list of transit years is immense in proving the veracity of his-
torical statements. Observe: the transit of Venus on Dec. 6th, 1882, A.D., or 5882 astron-
omical year, requires that one should have occurred 5840 years previously, to which if we
add the 42 years, we have a year beginning with Sunday, the first day of the week and the
first year of the solar cycle ofseven years. Six times seven are 42. Here, then we have
scientific evidence of the date of the Mosaic Creation, and the first seventh day at the end
of that week, written on-the face of the sun. If this were not so, the transit of 1882 is not
a fact, but an optical delusion, and all our astronomical data speculations of the mind.
The transit of Venus in the astronomical year 42 must have occurred, otherwise those
seen during the last 300 years could not have taken place when they did, It absolutely
proves the date of the Mosaic Creation in the following way • When we look at the Antedi-
luvian Solar Cycle of seven years, we see that the astronomical year 42 was the 7th or last
year of the cycle—six times seven are 42—therefore the first year began with Sunday, the
Ist day of the week, and had Saturday on the 7th day of the first month, as the Biblical
history informs us. There are no means of resisting this conclusion because we cannot
alter the natural succession of seventh days without which a solar cycle does not exist.
To this 41st year add 64, that is 8 times 8, because Venus accomplishes 13 revolutions t«
our 8. We then have “ 105,” to which the first transit belongs.
The transit on Dec. sth, 1639. was the first one seen of Venus and was witnessed by •
young clergyman named Horrocks.

ALL THE TRANSITS OE VBNTTS.


HOW TO PROVE THAT THE EARTH IN JUNE IS ON THE OPPOSITE
SIDE OF HER ORBIT WHEN IN DECEMBER.
Figure 3. Transits of Venus, Ascending and Descending Nodes.
I have already shown by the two diagrams in this book (See Explanation of Transits),
how transits occur, hut there are several facts derived from phenomena of this
The illustration here given proves that the earth in June is on the opposite side of her
orbit she occupied six months previously, that is, in December. The representation of
two transits on the left are when Venus is in her ascending node. Node means the place
in her orbit when Venns rises or drops to out level with the Sun, called the ecliptic. This
can only occur twice in her revolution round the sun, because the orbit of Venus, com-
pared with our level, is tilted up at one end and consequently depressed at the other end.
(See figure 2). These two transits occurred on Dec. Bth, 1874, and Dec. 6th, 1882, being
Nos. 1 and 2of the 18th team of transits (8 in each) from Adam. The two transits on the-
right side of the figure being in the descending node, their direction is downwards.
They represent the two which took place on June sth, 1761, and June 3rd. 1769, being
respectively Nos. 7 and Bof the 12th team. All the transits seen in the ascending node-
occur in one or the other of the two positions shown in the figure, and the same remark
applies to those in the descending node. They are also consecutive, that is to say when
two take place in the ascending node, one on the top half of the sun’s disc and the
other on the lower half, they will be followed by two in the descending node. Venus is-
always in conjunction, i.e. in a line between the earth and the sun every 19 months, but
being mostly above or below our level, we do not see her in front of the sun.
If the earth did not move to the other side of her orbit in June, we could not see Venus
cross the face of the sun when in her descending node, she being then on the other side-
of the sun, nor would the direction of her motion be the same as when in her ascending
node—from left to right. The reader should notice this by looking at the figure.
If the earth were immoveable, and the sun travelled round it, the same results might
occur in respect to the direction of the motion of transits, but the movement of the sun
would be an annual one. We should also see 26 transits in eight years, that is 13 in each
node. Whereas we see only eight transits of Venus in the course of 486 years, because
she goes round the sun about 13 times whilst the earth going eight times round. This
is why, when we see a transit after a long period—los or 122 years—we are sure to see
another eight years afterwards. We do not quite catcb Venus in her node in our 16tn
year. It requires 416 years to catch the same transit; but in half that period, viz. 243-
years, we catch another in the ascending node after having seen two in the descending
node, the first of which takes place in 121 i years, or half the 243 years. This is why
Ohronologists, who go deeper into the study of transits aud eclipses than astronomers,,
found that 486 years, or 8 transits, complete a team, and produce the same transit.
Mr. Proctor, the editor of “Knowledge,” has asked me how any one can show time
measurements by transits, i. e. before they were seen. This is a singular question from
an evolutionist; but if he were a Chronologist he would never have asked it. Only a
man from the country, when in Cheapside, would ask the way to the Bank. There were
60 minutes in a period of time we call an hour, before clocks were invented, and we-can
multiply that period for proving any other. Therefore as we find that there are now 486
years in a team of transits, we can use it for proving other measures of time, before tran-
sits were seen, and if the product is the same, we have only done what is common in -
every twopenny Board School in the kingdom. But eclipses and solar cycles prove that -
the transits of Venus took place ."rein the beginning of tim“.


HOW TIME IS PROVED BY TRANSITS.
Transits cannot be correctly enumerated by any other than natural years, and for
this reason they have never been tabulated except in this work. This is a great pity,
because, as also in respect to eclipses, the sublime science of cstronomy has been con-
fined to star-gazing instead of being made practically useful to mankind. There are
eight transits of Venus in a team lasting 486 years. This is a useful line of measure-
ment and extinguishes men who talk about “ gaps ” in the line of time, or those mira-
cle workers who create years which they are unable to produce by any astronomical
motion. When the transits of Venus are tabulated, there will not only be 486 years in
the length of a team, there will also be the same number of years between any transit
and one opposite it in the adjoining column to the right or left. Any person can see
that a team cannot be broken, because the regularity of the nodes would be disturbed,
and as to the succession of the teams, it would not be possible to miss one or more, be-
cause it would have to be done designedly, and then such omissions would be detected,
in the very place where they occurred, because the line of years would not accord in
such places with that of the eclipses, or any other cycle of time. The Metonic cycle
would soon show up an error of any kind, even if it was but a day.

FIFTH LINE OF TIME.
TRANSITS OF MERCURY.
Mercury planet to the sun, is termed an*ihferior ( pianet (as is also Venus),
because its orbit, or path made in moving round the sun, is -within that of the earth.
This will be understood by stating that Mercury i£ about 37,000,000 miles from th&
Sun, Venus about 68,000,000 miles, whilst the distance of the earth (which is the third
planet) is about 94,420,000 miles from that luminary.- As these planets move round the
sun in these distances, the circle-like orbit of Mercury is the smallest. The orbit of
Venus is larger, and that of the earth the largest of the three, and thus Mercury and
Venus are called inferior planets because they make their revolutions round the sun in
orbits, or path-ways, within the orbit of the earth. The earth completes its revolution
in days, which form - our solar year, but MerCury is only 88 days in going round his-
orbit. Mercury is a small planet. It would take 17 globes like his to make the size
of our world, and he has a swifter motion—loo,ooo miles an hour.
Therefore as thersare only two planets (Mercury and Venus) situated within the orbit
of the earth, they are the only two which*can be seen in transitu. Transits of Venus are
the most serviceable to astronomers, because they determine distances ; but, owing to the
shorter intervals between the transits of Mercury and consequently their greater fre-
quency, they are most serviceable to chronologists in determining true time. F or instance
the first transit of Mercury since creation period, occurred in the second year (astronomi-
cal or Ist A.M. of the Antediluvian Solar Cycle) hence it gives us the first occurrence of that
cycle and a scientific determination of the point when time began, because when we re-
verse the transits of Mercury from those «we now see, we arrive upon the first seven years
of the Solar Cycle. This is a very.beautiful fact, and a very simple one. To put it in other
words, if we start with a transit of Mercury in its ascending node, in the Bth month of
the 2nd year (our May) of the Antediluvian Solar Cycle, we can follow all the rest ia
regular succession to those we now see. Hence every transit of Mercury writes the date
of Creation, or the Re-fahrication of the world, bn the face of the sun.
As history followed on the solar cycles shows with what day of the week each year has
begun, and as the simple counting of the succession of the solar cycles proves the number
of the years of the world, it is, after all, very simple work to prove anything by transits,
because if we were promised all the world we could not add a day to any period of time
determined by planetary motion, or take one from it. The results obtained by transits
are also derived by other means, such as eclipses, but transits being events occurring on
a scale of solar years, they are the moat simple and ready means for dealing with time.
Let the following illustration be taken. The reader has probably noticed that when he
has presented a cheque to a banker, the gold is not counted, but simply weighed, yet the
banking clerk knows that he has paid every farthing represented by the cheque. This is
because the weight of a single sovereign is known, and by a system understood at the
bank, the aggregate weight of any number of sovereigns is equally known. *5 Chrono-
logists who have an astronomical system—and they are not worthy of the name if they
have not —can deal with transits in the same way. We know, for instance, thatihere are

•92 solar years in a team or series of transits of Mercury, and that each team consists of
•16 transits. It is easy to observe from the solar cycle with what day of the week each
•of these 92 years began, and hence with what each team began; and then by a quick pro-
cess, we can see if the day of the week given in history fell on the date of the month
recorded. In this way it is found that the yearO A. M. did begin with Sunday and had
its first 7th of the month on Saturday. The human mind can do anything if it knows
how to do it. Thus in a school there is a system of arithmetic by a multiplication table,
by which it is known that as there are 20 shillings in a sovereign, there are 100 shillings
■in five sovereigns, and 1,000 shillings in fifty sovereigns. Hence if you are selling a man
a thousand yards of cloth at a shilling a yard and he gives you £SO, you are satisfied that
he has paid you for every yard.
The following tables prove that year 0 A.M, began with Sunday and that Saturday the
first Sabbath Day fell on the 7th of the first month. The year 1 A.M. was the 2nd year
of actual time, because thete could be no counting of a year past until one year was
complete. Hence the commencing year of the solar cycle is called 0, and the next year 1,
The first transit when reversed from those we now see falls upon this year 1, beginning
with Thursday, and as 92 years afterwards—the period of a team of 15 transits—is
• added to 1, the second team began in year 93, commencing with Monday, and so on.
The day of the week across the column are always the same, and are obtained from'
ithe solar cycles in their natural consecutive succession, that is the Antediluvian and the
Ancient Hebrew, both being unalterable, and the latter brought forward to present time.
■Our solar cycle, not being astronomical as to the proper beginning of the year, and being
also variable, is inapplicable for tabular measurements of this character.
.. Hence the transits of Mercury prove the date of Creation to be scientifically correct,
because the history of the events of the world, when placed together and added up, will
•come to 6889 years, when the tran it above referred to takes place. But the years of the
world are best determined by counting the solar cycles, which are the natural production
•of weeks of seven days combined with dates of the month. Therefore, when we come to
investigate history, whether by the' records of events—such as the births of the great
patriarchs, reigns of kings, or dates mentioned in history—we find that as a chain of
time it is capable of confirmation by the transits of Mercury. The same results are also
obtained by eclipses, the lunar cycle, and the transits of Venus. The more this is
thought of, the more splendid and interesting it will become. r
«The reader will understand that it is not essential to know that all the transits of Mer-
cury occurred in the years mentioned—though there is plenty of evidence that they did—
-all we require are well-known standards of measurement. Our present method of dividing
•days into 24 hours of 60 minutes each is applicable to all past time according to eclipses.
DATE OF CREATION PROVED BY TRANSITS OF MERCURY.


TRANSITS OF MERCURY.
Tkansits are valuable in determining time and distance. Those of Mercury are more ser-
viceable for time than are those of Venus, the latter, however, recover some importance by
bein" more applicable in determining distance, principally that of the sun. The great
value of tlie transits of Mercury arise from the fact that that planet being much less than
half the distance of the earth from the sun, accomplishes four revolutions round the central
luminary before the earth quite completes one, thereby producing a frequency of transits
wliich by reversing from the present time carry us back to the first twelve months of history
vhen time was first instituted, viz, :—year 1 A.M., or astronomical 2.
There are 15 transits of Mercury in a team. They occur in a period of 92 years. Hence
it follows that there must be 92 years between a transit of the same number and character
in each team produced by the following intervals :
In Astronomical years; 4,9, 4,9, 4,7, 9,4, 3,6, 4,7, 9, 4, 9. Total 92.
In Anno Domini years; 3, 10, 3, 10, 3,7, 10, 3,3, 7,3, 7, 10, 3, 10. Total 92.
It will thus be seen that they work on the same principle as eclipses. There are 18 years
during which a team of eclipses occur, and therefore there are 18 years between an eclipse of
the same character and number. The same simple but beautiful arrangement also occurs in
respect to the transits of Venus.
It is necessary here to observe that neither transits or eclipses can be enumerated and
classified on our solar Anno Domini years, because the latter have no existence prior to the
year 4000 A.M.. and are also imperfect in correct numeration. Neither can transits be com-
pared with eclipses when classified upon Anno Domini years, or serve as a starting point for
continued observation down to our own time. Endless perplexity arises when we deal with
astronomical phenomena upon Anno Domini years which begin with the fourth mouth of
the true scientific year, and consequently overlap each successive year more than three
months. The a. m. or Biblical year, would be more correct, as it starts with the same month
as the astronomical, but by being the enumeration of past time, it necessarily begins year 1
on the astromoraical year 2, and is always one short. The reader will thus see the indis-
pensable importance of the astronomical year, which simply means counting time by present
planetary motion, that is calling the first 12 mouths one year of motion, or beginning year
1 with the first day of time.
Figure 7.
Figure 8.
The beautiful aud always precise motions of the earth and Mercury are shown in the
above figure, No. 7. The large orbit represents the path of the earth round the sun, the
place of which is in the centre of the transverse line. The shaded orbit is that of Mer-
cury. It is smaller than that of the earth and not on the same level, as it is tilted up
seven degrees at the upper end. Both the earth and Mercury travel in the same direc-
tion, but Mercury completes his revolution in less than three mouths. The two small
■dark spheres are Mercury in his ascending and descending nodes, both of which are on
the level of the earth’s orbit, so that when he cuts through it, and the earth is in con-
junction, as represented by the two larger dark spheres, we see Mercury as a small black
ball sailing across the sun. With motion as this, who can deny Biblical history ? Only
the man who knows nothing about either.
As Mercury is a small planet, it cannot be seen in transit when looking through a
piece of smoked glass. A small telescope with an astronomical eye-piece of coloured
glass is necessary. Venus, a larger and nearer body, can be seen by the unassisted eye.
Figure 8 shows the pair of transits of Venus which we see eight years apart, occurring
after rather more than a century. Should Venus and the sun be simultaneously on the
line of nodes, Venus would travel across the sun’s centre, on the horizontal line, and
take eight hours to perform the passage, but the next transit, eight years afterwards,
might scarcely be on the sun.
It should be stated that figure 7 on this page, and also 2, representing Venus in
transit, are not correctly drawn. The upper end of the tilted orbit should have been on
the left side, because the direction of the motions of the planets is from right to left, so
that the ascending node is at the bottom of the figure. This error of the engraver, how-
ever, does not interfere with the explanation of the cause of transits, nor will it prevent
any person using the tables for obtaining the years of the world.

THE FIFTH LINE OF ASTRONOMICAL TIME.
mercury’s transits.
The following are the first transits in each team of 15, A team comprises 92 years. The
years in the list are astronomical. As our time is 1 year and 9 months in advance of
historical or a.m. time, a transit in May is 1 year earlier, and a transit in November is the
same year as almanack time.


Respecting the two tables of the transits of the planet Heronry, the top one contains
all the transits following each other in their teams, having 15 transits in each team, the
whole extending over 92 years. Thus the first team began in year 2 (reckoning Creation
year as 1). The second team therefore began in year 94, the 3rd in 186, and so on. The
transits in this way lay down the line of years for us. They are obtained by reversing
their present periods, for it would be impossible to alter their length five seconds.
The larger table consists of the font last teams fully tabulated in order to illustrate
the way in which they occur. The years with which they began are in the top table.
The transit in 1894. isNov. 10th, at 3.55 40 seconds. The time from Creation is 5894,
2nd month, astronomical solar year (the true year always begins on 20th Sept.) or 5893,
a.m. 2nd month, by counting Creation year as 0.
The Bible is by all these methods proved to be a magnificent book. It is the only
book in the world whose years aud months are strictly those of astronomical motion.
There are ten cycles of time and they all began together at Creation, 0 a-m., but they
have never been together since, and it would be impossible for them to get together at
the starting of Creation year by the present known motions of the earth and the moon,
because they all differ in length and character. We should have known this before, but
is astronomy was based on years made by Acts of Parliament, it was not able to make
the necessary investigation. Creation has been lost by the confusion of years which are
not natural or in accord with planetary motion. For the same reason the beginning and
end of the prophecies, and all events of Scripture have been hidden. They are based on
time produced by the motions of the heavenly bodies—not on fictitious, but scientific
time ordained by the laws of God. It is shown in “ All Past Time,” that no tables of
eclipses can be formed without starting from the point of Creation. Men who speak
lightly of the first chapter of Genesis do not know what they are talking about. ( The
man who hangs out his tongue in derision of the movements of the orbs of heaven re-
corded in this chapter, is now a great simpleton, for we see that as science advances it
comes nearer to revelation. All the motions known to us by the sublime science of
astronomy have had a beginning, and it would be destruction to allow such prodigious
motions to begin without control. Measurements show that they began at the epoch of
Creation, and there also we find all the features of a beginning. King David lived in a
period when men better understood the motions of the heavenly bodies than the men
of this generation, for ancient years were produced by solar and lunar motions, in direct
consecutive “line” from Creation, hence in Psalm xix. David speaks of “ their line.”
Their motions and positions were instituted as signs of “ seasons, aud days, and years,”
and the man who does not know “ their line,” is deficient in his education. In the
Bible we have a true line of natural years—a line of scientific time—the want of which
has prevented the construction of tables of transits and eclipses. But as Bible time is
found to be the time produced by astronomical motion, all such tables are formed. The
Scriptures have thus enlarged our knowledge of astronomy.
What is the result of this rich harvest of new scientific facts? We can obtain the
precise point of Creation, the Flood or any event of Biblical history. We can fix the
date and the end of prophecies and periods of time. Revelation is thus proved to be
superior to the formula of human science. Revelation has not to be lifted up to a level
with science, but science is being raised to the' higher platform of inspiration. The
ambassadors of religious truth can no longer be told that their teaching is “ tolerated
for the sake of children.” No; the first, the highest, and the chief seats belong to the
priesthood of God. To the church of God must now be said, in the language of Isaiah,
‘‘Arise, shine! for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.
Put on thy beautiful garments.” The church of Christ is clothed with strength. She
is “ terrible as an army with banners” to all sceptics. They are “ashes under her
feet.” She is breaking, as with a rod of iron, all the gilded lamps which have no oil—
theories are fallen, and the Dianas of science which have no basis fall before the ark
of God and his written word. This is true. It has been expected by those who have
faithfully held to the Divine records in a period of darkness and trial. Men now see
that they cannot get away from the first chapter of Genesis. It begins all time and sup-
plies the periods of all planetary motion. Without the Bible not one of them can be
tabulated, as is shown by the fact that notwithstanding great efforts, the work could
never be done. But it is effected with Biblical time, which is thus proved to be scien-
tific time —a continued chain from the “first day ”of Creation.
The transit of the planet Mercury, on the 10th of Nov., 1894, will he a proof of the
accuracy of the first chapter of Genesis, because the team would be broken if the first
team was not complete. Transits in the ascending node must always occur about 60
days after the equinox. This transit may be regarded as a signal gun fired in the
heavens indicating the accomplishment of the period when, as a small black ball, Mer-
cury will be seen by the telescope, should the weather be clear, sailing across the face
of the orb of day. It will be the finger of God writing the date of Creation on the face
of the sun and precisely at 3h. 55m. 40s.

NOTES OF INTEREST.
1. We stole a year by beginning the Chris-
tian era on the year 4000, and therefore 4001
was our year 2, instead of 1 a.d. We are
also 89 days in advance of another year,
owing to the changes we have introduced
in altering the form and beginning of our
years. The year 1880 is therefore properly
1878 until Sept. This is proved both by
the eclipses and solar cycles.
2. The lunar cycle proves that the mod-
em Jews err in the computation of years.
They lost their old documents soon after
the destruction of Jerusalem, and adopted
the Selucidaen era. This they again aban-
doned 400 years ago for that they now use.
3. It is certain, by the eclipses, that the
Ancient Hebrew Solar Cycle began with
1722, a.m. It must commence with a 15th
year when a 7th of the antediluvian, or ori-
ginal cycle ended its intercalary days. We
have three other 15th years of this class,
but I can obtain no testimony in their fa-
vour. It is satisfactory, however, that the
result would be the same, whichever of the
four years be taken. Both the lunar cy-
cle and the record of the lives of the patri-
archs in Gen. xi. again travelling side by
side as they do in relation to the flood year
and the golden record in Gen. v. Nothing
in all the world can excel the beautiful
affinity and perfect unity of testimony be-
tween high stem science and sacred history
in these two chapters.
4. There can be no solar cycle unless
weeks of seven days are observed. The
fact that the years of the antediluvians, the
postdiluvian patriarchs, and the ancient
Hebrews all work in solar cycles, is itself
absolute proof that weeks of seven days
have been observed from creation, whilst
the lunar cycle in connection with the dates
show that they have never been broken.
5. The two Biblical solar cycles being
composed of seventh days, and each begin-
ning with the sabbath on the 7th day, is the
simple, yet arbitrary succession of an as-
tronomical line of seventh days of the lunar
years. The intercalary days of the antedi-
luvians being just 11 weeks did not disturb
this rotation, whilst those of the Hebrews,
by being incorporated, could not do so.
6. The scriptural record of the flood, giv-
ing us the beginning and end of a full lunar
and solar year—one revolving in the other—
might be hung up in our museums as an an-
cient almanack and a curiosity of antiquity,
7. We can now assign a date to every day
that has occurred since creation, and give
it tha proper position in the week. >
48. As we are now acquainted with the
precise length of the solar year, we can find
the number of the 7th days from creation.
It is the same as the number of sabbath
days obtained from the solar cycles.
9. Our solar year was used in Borne before
Christ with an observance of a “ leap year, *
but the months were not divided in weeks.
10. As the dates in the Old and New Tes-
taments fall when the years possessed such
dates (for the dates of one year are not the
same ar another), each book of the scrip-
tures must belong to the years which they
claim to come from, whilst the naoratives
are often of a character that they could
not be recorded if untruthful.
11. Assyrian and ancient Egyptian dates
have no concurrence with Biblical and as-
tronomical time, and have no solar cycles.
12. Intercalary days are alluded to in the
Bible as “at the end of days,” in which
case the words ought to be in the text in-
stead of the margin, They are also some-
times expressed by “ after two full years,”
that is a full lunar and solar year, when
both ended by the use of intercalary days.
13. The application of the lunar cycle of
nineteen years to all time (See first years of
antediluvian solar cycle), is a sort of net or
guage. It is a most convincing fact to find
that this famous cycle when squared to tha
Biblical solar years always falls upon a year
that has the dates of a nineteenth.
14 The proper year of the lunar cycle
cannot be that given in some almanacks.
It must be taken from the exact starting
post of time at creation,
15. There is a very important place in the
Hebrew solar cycle, at table i. It is the mid-
dle intercalary period, and may be termed
the accommodation point. All the dates of
scripture history prove that the following
year began with Sabbath day on the Ist of
the month, but unless an extra day be given
to the 12th month, it would not do so. The
moon requires it once in 15 years. Thus,
12th month 2 9 10 23 30
Intercalary 7 14 21 28 So by
this arrangement the cycle could always be
adjusted to 15 solar years, accomplishing
what we fail to achieve—always having the
cycle new on the first day of the week.
16. The actual link of our time with the
Hebrew cycle requires several tables and
much explanation. It may here be ob-
served that history proves that Jews have
not excelled Christians fn reverencing a
7th day. It has been safe in the hands of
these two communities since the apostles.
17. Geology requires an antiquity prior to
the institution of time and the creation of
man; but I cannot allow this prehistoric
period to trench a single “ day” upon our
chronological history. It is a great fallacy
to talk about pre-historio man! HoW
could men have public records—which are
certainly history—stating that Adam was
the first man, if every generation knew they
were lies ? Could we say that Wesley, or
even St. Paul, was the first man?


18. That the figures on the Ancient He-
brew Solar Cycle were Sabbath days is seen
by hosts of dates. The first 3 years have
same figures as first 3 of Antediluvian cycle.
19. No eclipse is mentioned in Scripture,
but they are all obtained by starting from
the first day in Gen. i., and by no other way.
20. Julius Caesar abolished the lunar year
and its intercalary month and thus broke
the line—an eclipse on Ist day every 18 yrs.
except 3rd 18th, when it was 1 month more.
21. The correct year of the world can be
always obtained from Triple Eclipse Table.
22. There are imperfect comprehensions
of science as well as of religion. Joshua
commanding the sun to stand still is likely
to be soon one of the brightest evidences of
Scripture history. It could be effected by
two or three methods. One by moderating
the rotatory motion of the earth. An as-
tronomer tells us that when a gentleman
raises his hat on meeting a lady in the street
he travels 30 miles bareheaded. This is
owing to the great speed with which the
earth moves in space. Now reduce the di-
urnal motion one half, and the effect would
be that the length of day would be doubled,
48 instead of 24 hours. But the period of
Joshua only requires a reduction of l-3rd.
It would in effect be like an express train
slackening its speed whilst passing through
a station. As to the cause of the reduced
motion, wise men will not say a word until
they know how the motion is effected. Ve-
nus and Mercury do not rotate. To them
the sun stands still half their year.
23. A watch is an indicator of the motions
started in year 0 a.m., so that he who carries
a watch wears a memento of Creation.
24. No year is used in this book without
its eclipses. When men talk of years for
which no eclipses can be produced, the years
have not existed. Years must be delivered
as a banker does gold. He weighs it. We
supply eclipses producing the years.
25. The English Government offered a
reward of .£20,000 in 1784 to any person
who discovered how to obtain the longitude
of places at sea within 30 miles. Mr. Har-
rison won the money, and the result was
Capt. Cook was able to sail round the world.
But when astronomical measurements were
made applicable for determining time and
periods of history, with greater, and indeed
absolute precision, Mr. Gladstone refused a
grant of £l5O for the expenses, and to this
day not a shilling has been contributed from
any public source. The Eoyal Society re-
ceives yearly from Parliament £6OOO for sci-
entific research, but thrice refused a small
grant for construction of instruments. Why
are they afraid of uselul work ? It will live
when they and their ideas are buried.
26. The b.c. and a.d. years are dropping
out of use. They should never be employed
for history because their length is irregular.
Besides they are not capable of addition,
subtraction and division. Writers should
be ashamed of them if they want accuracy.
27. On the 180th degree of longitude, half
of the circumference of the globe—start-
ing from Greenwich east or west—there is
an arbitrary change or dropping of a day.
In crossing the Pacific ocean, you go to bed
On Saturday night and awake on Monday
morning. Sunday has dropped from the
calendar, for that week. This is because on
voyaging round the world a day is lost on
going west, and one added on passing east.
28. One of the five methods for proving
that the sun is 92,520,000 miles distant is
that the earth moves 68,000 miles an hour.
For instance, the diameter of the earth is
about 8,000 miles, so that she has only to
move about eight times her diameter to ac-
complish 68,000 miles in one hour. Just
imagine a horse only moving eight times
its length in an hour. It would not win
the “ IJerby.” A race-horse will move four
times its length, in two seconds, but this
would be impossible to an insect the 16th
of an inch in length. Again, 68,000 miles
an hour would be an awful speed for a bul-
let fired from a rifle; but let the big earth
be the bullet and the motion is slow,
29. For the purpose of celebrating the
crucifixion when the moon is about full,
and also observing it on Friday, the follow-
ing method was ordered by Constantine, the
emperor, at the Council of more than 300
bishops, at Nice, in the year 325: the first
Sunday after the pascal full moon, or in
other words, after the full moon which
happens on or after the 21st of March (the
vernal equinox), should be Easter Sunday,
so that the Friday previous be Good Fri-
day. Therefore to ascertain on what day
Easter will fall in any year, nothing more
is requisite than to find the moon’s age on
the 21st of March, which will show when
the next full moon will occur, and the Sun-
day following will be Easter Sunday. This
therefore cannot happen earlier than the
22nd of March, nor later than the 25th of
April. Easter Sunday regulates all other
moveable festivals. The solar date of Good
Friday is the 2nd of April, but its observ-
ance neither secures Friday nor full moon.
30. The 7 days in Gen. i. cannot be moved
from the first year, and hence they cannot
be regarded as great periods. Astronom-
ical phenomena will not allow them to be
placed in any other year. We should not
stumble at the rapidity of creative work.
All great work is rapid, and so is all great
motion. Watch the heavens to see this.

NOTES OP INTEREST.


CONFIGURATIONS AND DISTANCE OF VENUS SHOWING HEB
REVOLUTION ROUND THE SDN.
The annexed sketch will show why Venns is sometimes so bright in the east, and how
we see her at certain times in transit by passing between the earth and the sun. The
inner circle is the orbit of Venus, and the outer one that of the earth with the sun in the
centre of both. The earth is supposed to be at the point I. at the bottom of the figure,
in December, from which the dotted lines indicate the direction of sight. When Venus
is near the earth, in her inferior conjunction, she has her dark side towards us and is
invisible, except when in transit, moving like a small black ball across the sun. She is
then but twenty-six millions of miles distant from ns. When she has moved round to
the top or opposite side of her orbit, at a time when the earth is again at L, she is in
her superior conjunction and has her full face towards us, but looks much smaller, as
she is then 158,000,000 miles distant. Her appearance, as seen ‘through the telescope,
when near the earth, is that of a large crescent, shown on the lower right side of the
above sketch. When about half way round her orbit, providing the earth is again at L
in December, Venus shines like a half moon, the configuration of which is the reverse of
that when she is on the opposite side of her orbit. Then, when in the upper, or,
shoulder-like positions, she is seen still smaller, her gibbous appearance, when measured
is about two-thirds of her illuminated face, but very brilliant. I have been often much
interested in watching Venus when in the left shoulder, and have met with difficulty at
such times in securing an outline of her luminous contour, owing to her burnished and
glittering aspect when so near the sun. She is on these occasions invisible to the naked 1
eye, owing to the golden lustre of the great orb of day, just as he is dropping below the
horizon. Of course the phases of Venus, and apparent size, are reversed when the earth
is at 11. in June, and this fact shows that tbe earth travels round the sun.
As Venus moves in a smaller orbit, she travels 13 times round the sun whilst the earth
can only complete eight revolutions. This explains why, after seeing Venus in transit,
we catch her again in the same position eight years afterwards, but then, owing to the
slight difference of time, have to wait more than a century before the magnificent spec-
tacle is repeated. See Transits'of Venus, Men who work with genealogical chronology
can speak of “ gaps ” of time, or put any number of years into their periods, but astron-
omical chronologists cannot work such miracles.
As the greatest brilliancy of Venus is every eight years, her lignt is so great that it
casts a shadow. This is best observed when a piece of white paper is held just behind a
lead pencil, holding both in an upright position, and in a room on the opposite side
to the window. The proof is that when Venus has moved away, or the paper is not held
opposite the planet, there is no shadow. Time by a watch can also be seen.


CREATION AND GEOLOGY.
We have been in an unfortunate position in respect to Creation. We know
nothing about it. It was therefore a subject confined to the records of revelation.
But by the extension of astronomical research, made practical by the application of
the known periods of planetary motion on the basis of natural years, and by which
several tables of scientific time are produced, we are now able to reach and explore
the epoch of Creation mentioned in revelation and on the Cuneiform records of
earlyJßabylonian history. The result is an array of new scientific facts. How far
the Csesar of Science, equipped with new weapons, now smites certain hypothetical
conclusions of pre-historic authors for whose years—like those of some writers of
modern periods—no eclipses can be found, let the reader judge.


THE ARGUMENT,
I. Geologists have taken up a position, stating, in effect, that there was no Creation
at the time mentioned in revelation (year 0 a.m.), but that the world, and the
whole of the solar system with its motions, were in existence many thousands-
of years before that time, and that (as some men say) whatever exists is due to-
productive stages of evolution.
IL The reply is, we have now arrived at a period in which the advancement of science
and our ability to place all history on a scientific basis, compels us to admit
that the date of Creation given us in Genesis i. (year 0, A.M., 3996, the true n.c.)
is an astronomical fact of the highest scientific character. What prevented
astronomy from making this discovery before was, its calculations have been
based on Parliamentary instead of natural years, and thereby prevented the
necessary investigation. But now that planetary motion is used as the basis of
time, and the motions of the earth and moon are preserved in their lines of
natural years, all astronomical phenomena are traced back to year 0, a.m. where
they stop, all the eight or ten cycles of time and motion being together in a
line—a position which they have not since resumed, and which their character
also renders it impossible to have previously obtained.
It has been the imperfection of our knowledge which seemed to give rise to a conflict
between revelation and science. Ten years ago, neither the opening chapter of Genesis
nor the science of astronomy were understood. Wo were not aware, for instance, that
the “fourth day,” when the sun was “ set in the firmament.” was the autumnal equi-
nox, and that the sun is in that position on the fourth day of every solar year now, for
nothing in the whole domain of astronomical science is so precise as the period of the
revolution of the earth round the sun, marked by the return of the great orb of day to
the equinoctial colure in September. In the next place astronomy has not been purged
entirely from astrology. We yet begin years by legislative enactments from the founda-
tion of cities, the achievement of a victory, or the celebration of an anniversary, none of
which ate we able to prove by our 13 barbarous systems of time, any better than they
can lead us up to Creation. When will our public schools be swept of such encum-
brances which hide the great facts of history ? When we begin to use natural years,
produced by the laws of motion, we can follow all celestial phenomena and know where
we are, or how far we are precisely from one point of time to any other. We can then
put our finger on the “first day” in the same way as with our pencil we can point to
the first unit, in the multiplication table. We obtain by a natural and scientific process
the epoch of Creation—the true era before which all others are falling—because time,
like arithmetic, is a science to which nothing can be added or taken away. By these
means we found the starting-post of time when all the cycles stood abreast like horses
at the commencement of a race—a position which the eight or ten cycles have not since
resumed, and which, as already intimated, they could not previously have held, because
they could not exist. This, then, was the discovery of “ the beginning ” of planetary
law and motion, and the creation of the constitution of the world on which we live. We
were able to lay hold of it, because every 7th year is also the 7th year of the Bible.
We find by investigation that the first chapter of Genesis gives us a point of time
which is unique for being scientific time, that is to say, produced by the sun, the moon,
and the earth. Such an incident has not occurred since, neither is it recorded in any
other book. It was an epoch—the marvellous epoch—when (1.) the solar and lunar
years began together. (2.) When the solar and lunar cycles, now existing, commenced.
(3.) When the Metonic cycle started. (4.) When the sun was on the equinoctial colure
in Sepetmber, thus starting the year with the autumnal equinox, and accordingly, six
months later, the earth having got hall way round her orbit, she reached the vernal
equinox in March, and then was back again in Sept, at the point from which she started,
the natural year being formed by the equinoxes. (5) When the solar cycle started with
the first day of the week. (6.) When the eclipse date-repeating cycle of 649 years began.
(7,) When the common team of 70 eclipses began its recurring period of 18 years.
(8.) When the “life-history” of solar eclipses began to register periods of 1260-2 years.
(9.) When the line of apsides of the moon were normal in position and parallel to that of
the earth. (10.) When the nodes of the moon had the beautiful geometrical position of
being in the centre of that year, as shown by the two solar eclipses on the Ist days of
the 4th and the 10th months—a position indicating a beginning.
These are hard facts. They are facts of the highest scientific character against which
no geologist can lift a finger, and they show us that before men attack Creation they
ought first to know what it was.
CREATION AND GEOLOGY.


We should have known all this before had our astronomy been correctly constructed,
hnt as it was based on the form of years enacted by legislature, it could not furnish
tables of eclipses, or transits, or indeed of months and natural years. Our dilemma was
so great that we could not even carry our a.d. further back than 1752, when Parliament
made the last alteration in the form of the year by the adoption of the “ new style ” of
dating. When therefore geologists made claims for many thousands of “years,” before
the beginning, we could obtain no assistance from astronomy for making investigation.
It is true that in the midst of the conflict there was no harmony of views amongst
geologists. Indeed there was great contradiction. Claims were made for a “ glacial
period ” in one volume, and answered by another on “The Nightmare of the Ice Age.”
This is to be regretted, for both writers are men of eminence. A good book seems yet
to be wanted on geology, showing what has been the condition of things before years
and days, and seasons began, and when the earth, like Jupiter, had an upper sea.
But the conflict raised by geologists against revelation is not confined to the con-
dition of the mass of the shapeless earth in remote ages. It has trenched on the work
of Creation by importing the present motions of the earth and its physical constitution
into periods which geological research shows that they did not exist. It is this which
causes confusion. Of late years we have been told that there is no land which has not
at some time been the bottom of the sea, and that at no remote period *• the climate of
the north was equal to that of tropical regions. ” These are statements showing that
the present oblique position of the axis of the earth has not existed even in the latest
geological periods, for it is clear that seasons—alternate cold and heat—are produced b<
the tilt of the earth’s equator caused by the upper end of her axis always pointing tt
the north. The claims of geologists for years, and days, and seasons—which produce
the present higher constitution and superior plants and animals of the world, are
inconsistent. They are opposed to our knowledge of physical science.
Where do geologists get their “ years ” ? How do they obtain a rotating earth and
revolving seasons, without cycles of time ? It is like talking about a clock which has
no wheels. There could be duration before Creation, but we have clear and abounding
evidence that the present laws of motion had no existence. Geology will be better
understood when such nebula; as that of Andromeda and others are more known—the
“heaps of shingle,” as one of our scientists calls the rude and shapeless masses of
matter enwrapped in luminous gases.
Creation does not belong to remote origin. It was an arrangement—perhaps limited
to the solar system —when a new and superior order of things were made from those
which, in a rude form, had some pre-existence. We are told this in Genesis i., so that
whatever may have been the condition of things prior to the epoch of creation, they
were demolished by mighty forces and convulsions which displaced much of the strata
and rolled up others like a carpet. We have evidence of all this around us. It seems
to have been the preliminary stage of Creation.
The work of Creation would follow the upheaval of the strata, so that everything was
re-constructed during the six natural days of Creation. This period of re-fabrication
was particularly begun by the institution of the present laws of motion, by which the
round world, for the first time, began to rotate on its axis. We must believe this, be-
cause the cycles of time were not together on the seco. d day. They had accomplished
one day of the periods which we find that they possess, and we must bear in mind that
they were all abreast on the first day, and must have been so arranged, for there are no
natural means by which 10 cycles of varied character aud length could get into a line.
The earth also began to travel round the sun, having received an impulse of motion for
accomplishing an orbit in a period adapted to the new order of seed-bearing plant?, and
of such dimensions as would preserve it from the attractive “pull” of other celestial
bodies and yet so nicely adjusted as the velocity should not overcome the centripetal
force by which the sun has such a hold on the earth as to prevent it from flying off in a
straight line into boundless space. This impulse of motion, and its adapted force is
regarded as inexplicable. It could not be evolved. A diminution of the velocity would
be destruction. It could not begin when the earth was a shapeless mass, or smaller, or
of less density. But no matter what the condition of the earth was, we have to admit
a beginning of this inexplicable impulse of-motion. Some men leave it as a mystery.
Ido not, because I see when it began. The present laws of planetary motion—for the
planets all differ—could not exist before the necessary adjustments,- or when the planets
were shapeless masses entombed or conglobated in a nebula at rest, without magnetic or
gravitating disturbance. We can imagine no period for the beginning of motion but
that where we can trace it—Creation,
CREATION AND GEOLOGY.


What has greatly helpeJ ns in realising this fact is the discovery by our improved tel-
escopes that all the bodies of the solar system have not a rotating motion, and that some
of them have no seasons. Like our moon, the planets Mercury and Venus, and perhaps
others, do not turn on their axis, except once in the fall period of their revolution round
the sun—their year. The axis of the planet Jupiter is almost perpendicular, so that his
huge rotundity can have no seasons. One of the leading theories of evolutionists used to
be that the planets were the conglobated matter belonging to the sun, and that they
became spherical by the rotatory motion they received in common with all bodies con-
nected with the central mass, like eddies in water. But this theory has now to be given
up. The motions of the planets indicate a diversified origin. We know not where some
of them have come from. The moon is evidently an older world than the earth and is
not of the same physical or stratified constitution. There seems also to have been
modifications or degrees of force employed for establishing their velocities in proportion
to their distance from their primary, but not according to their density or size. For ex-
ample, Mercury is much more dense than the earth, and not half so far from the sun, yet
travels with nearly double the velocity; but Uranus is double the density of Saturn,
and nearly twice his distance from the sun, yet moves more slowly. There can be no
evolution in a reversed order like this. One more law of opposite character must be
mentioned. The satellites of Uranus move in an opposite direction to those of other
planets. We can therefore contend that motion is a selection of force suitable to the
position of each orb in order to preserve the whole of them from collision; for it must be
manifest that to have a number of large bodies in motion, without determining their
respective orbits by the adjustment of their velosity, would smash up the whole system
in less than twelye months. To avoid such an appaling catastrophe it is quiet as im-
portant to regulate them as we do our railway trains, particularly the smaller planets
which interlace each other’s orbits in probably a hundred places.
M. Piquot says we have no means for explaining the origin of motion and that Newton
refused to regard it in any other sense than the act of the Creator. This is a true re-
maik, but even if all planetary motion was of one character, just as we might suppose
all flowers to be white, there would still be difficulty in referring motion to evolution.
We can give to geology—undetermined and confused as yet its standards are—all that
it claims for duration; but it has had no days, seasons, or years of time, nor any plants
or animals belonging to the epoch of Creation. It is somewhat remarkable that the
early cuneiform records from Babylonia should state that prior to Creation there were
monsters in the chaotic age. This is not found in the writings of Moses, and whilst it
shows that the Chaldean records were written from traditions independent of the sources
from which the Biblical records were obtained, it amounts to_a confirmation of Creation
as a subsequent event to a remote and rude condition of the world.
There is, however, a difficulty in accepting geology as a science, because science is a
knowledge of the laws and constitution of things which now exist, and geology concerns
what preceded them during immeasurable ages. Therefore everything belonging to pre-
historic periods is irrelevant, and as the world is destined to receive, with us, a still higher
application of creative power, present sciences must in their turn pass into oblivion.
We have no conception of voluntary and immediate creation ; but we formerly had no
compehension of the transmission of words in a few moments to our antipodes by electric
currents, or transforming air into a liquid. We find that the Son of God performed crea-
tive work. He made the maimed whole. All the four evangelists tell us that he fed
6,000 persons with five barley loaves and two small fishes. We can only disbelieve this
by supposing that these four evangelists wore untruthful men, and that our present know-
ledge or science will never be surpassed by our successors.
EXAMPLE OP DATE BY METONIO CYCLE.
The astronomical character of the date of Creation is proved by the Metonio cycle,
amongst others, as follows: The Luni-solar cycle is 7 years. The Metonic cycle is 19.
As 7 times 19 are 133, every 133rd year has the same form as Creation year. Then by
bringing down years in series of 133, we have a repetition of the first seven lunar years
in our own time, namely, from Sunday, Sept. 20th, 1816, (which was Ist day of the Ist
month, 5810th solar year) to Saturday, July 17th, 1852, both days inclusive. The re-
sult is, the moon in this period was new on the same days of the week that she was new
in the first seven lunar years beginning with Creation. Any person can do this by
following the directions given in the Eclipse Section of All Past Time under the head-
ingg A Marvellous and Brilliant Kesult.” By this we must admit that only men whose
education stands on pagan astrology can doubt the sublime records of Creation, which
are incessantly proclaimed before our eyes by all the phenomena of the skies. Let us
hope that those who are responsible for the education of the young will see the mischief
of putting exploded systems of error in the place of revelation and science.
CREATION AND GEOLOGY.


CREATION AND EVOLUTION.—NEW SCIENCE.
Evolution is a theory and cannot survive the hard facts discovered by the Scieuoe of
Time. It is a fad destroyed by the physical facts we now find at the epoch of Creation
3)elonging to the constructive arrangements and laws which thfn f irmed and now govern
the constitution of the world. I have already stated that ho cycle of eclipses can be
formed without beginning at the first day in Genesis i„ and that at the epoch of Creation
ten cycles of time started together. Owing to their various lengths, and their physical
character, they have not resumed this unique position, nor could they get together prior
to Creation without prescribed arrangement. Indeed as cycles of time are the result of
planetary motion, it is a manifest conclusion that they could not begin before these
motions began, and that they did begin with year 0 a.m. we see by finding, them there
beginning all abreast from that point. With this new science, old astronomy without
measurements must be abandoned by men who wish to preserve their reputation.
It will readily be seen how we find these new scientific facts, because when we know
the periods of cstronomical phenomena, we can follow them back to Creation; but as-
tronomy has been unable to do this owing to ignorance of Scientific time.
The reply to evolutionists is: How did the Antediluvian Solar-Lunar Cycle, which
starts when Sunday was the Ist day of the month, begin when the solar and lunar years
were abreast on that day ? How also did this motion of the earth and the muon begin
with the autumnal equinox and the Metonic cycle ? Why did the “ life-history ”of a
solar eclipse, which is 1262 solar years, begin when the nodes of the moon were in the
centre of the year—the starting point of eclipses? How comes it that the moon was
placed in the maximum position of her orbit when the sun was set in his on the equi-
noctial colure ? Moreover, how did this occur when the line of the moon’s apsides was
in its normal position, parallel with the same line of the orbit of the earth ?
These questions are capable of being multiplied : but there are two others which ought
to he mentioned. The revolution of the perigee of the moon, like that of the node, is
not uniform. It is subject to increased, and at other times to a diminished velocity,
and as the earth is situated in the lower focus of the moon’s orbit, her accelerated mo-
tion, when nearest to ns, would in time cause her to be drawn towards the earth, so that
there would be an end to all sublunary things, evolution included; but after this accel-
eration has completed its cycle, it becomes regressive.
It the orbits of the earth and planets Were perfect circles, the perturbations arising
from the “ pull ” of other orbs, would cause a revolving body to be drawn towards the
sun, or travel further off, so that a collision would occur, or the regularity of the
seasons, in the case of the earth, would be affected. To avoid such catastrophies, the
planets describe elipses, or ovals, and the sun is placed in the lower foens, as will be
seen by the annexed illustration which represents the orbit of the earth. The 12 spaces
are the 12 months of the year, which are equal in volume, though not in length. They
are indeed so equal that if the diagram were drawn on metal, and each section cut out,
they would be found all of one weight. The over the widest sections in
winter (I.) and is then nearest to the sun, moving with increased velocity. In June the
earth (II.) travels slowest, and it is this varied motion which aids in preserving the
earth in her proper path. Evolution could not provide an arrangement of this kind.
The three foci are shown in the diagram, that in the middle being the orbit’s centre.
These remarks will show that men who hastily run off with the theory of evolution
have done so without scientific inquiry, and whilst challenging revelation have not been
aware of the guns which, by Creation, are arrayed against them.


DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE FIRST CHAPTER OF GENESIS ?
There are thousands of persons whose abilities do not enable them to understand the
first chapter of Genesis. Yet there is no book which contains so much deep science in
the same number of words. Of all the chapters in the Books of Scripture there is not
one to equal it tor its evidence of inspiration and Divine authorship. It is because this
chapter is so high above the ordinary standard of human intelligence, and contains great
scientific facts) that it is derided by the unlearned. If, a century ago, a man wrote in a
hook that a message could be sent seven times round the world in a second of time, or
even that it was possible to sit in a carriage and travel 75 miles an hour, such a book
would not have been understood. It would have been derided because the scientific
character of the statements were at that time neither known or understood. Only re-
cently all London was taken by surprise when a scientific lecturer, in a few moments
liquified some of the air we breathe, and then freezed it so that it was weighed in scales.
We had not previously known or understood anything like this. Men went home from
these demonstrations musing on the possibility of the existence of many great mysterious
things of which the human mind was yet ignorant. The first chapter of Genesis is full
of them. The four right angles of 90° (360) by which the circle of the heavens is divided
are first found there, also in Dan. vii. 25, as an eclipse “ time.”—3£ times are 1260.
It was recently stated by the writer of a letter in one of the London papers that the
first chapter of Genesis was legendary. In reply to inquiries no proof could be obtained
in support of the statement and it became a question whether this writer or the sacred
text was to be believed. He then fell back on the supposed impossibility of the patri-
archs living so long as Scripture recorded. He was now caught in the grip of the science
he professed to support. He was first reminded that man was not created to die, and
this was shown before the eyes of the world by the long lives of the line of patriarchs.
The proofs were given. The years of the patriarchs, it was shown, both in respect
to nativity and death, are marvellous records, inasmuch as they produce a line of time
always in accord with astronomical periods. They are an incomparable record, for,
notwithstanding their diversified character, if unitedly they had contained 48 days
more, the line of time would not have worked on any scientific basis.
Now for the proof. We will take the birth of Arphaxed in 1658, because it is well
proved by the Solar Cycle and is on the Eclipse Cycle. By referring to the Antedilu-
vian Patriarchs in the First Line of Time, it will be seen that the Flood year, both by
computation of the births of the patriarchs and the motions of the earth and moon, was
the year 1656. We read that Arphaxed was born “ two years after the Flood,” which
would be 1658. Now look at the Triple Eclipse Table, and in the 3rd col. it will be
found that this 1658 was a year when the first eclipse in Creation year re-occurred.
The columns are the date-repeating cycle of 649 years. In tho Ist cycle, or col., the
eclipse was in the year 360, in the 2nd col. (that is to say 649 years afterwards) it was
in 1009, and in the 3rd the eclipse took place in 1658, the year when Arphaxed was bom.
Proceeding onwards to the right, on the same line, we have 2307, 2956, 3005, 4254, 4903,-
and 5552. Now if the eclipse did not occur on the Ist day of the 10th month iu the last
mentioned year, the eclipses of the year 1594, a.d., could not take place in the months
and dates mentioned in our Almanacks.
Now when we register the birth of a child, the year is given, not to prove that such a
year had arrived, but that some particular child was born that year. Here, then we
see that from the epoch of Creation to the birth of Arphaxed, there were not more nor
less than 1658 years. It would be a fortunate affair if the birth of children, born in
England, could be proved in the same way, that is by Solar Cycles and Eclipses.
In what way, then, does the “ legendary tale ” come in ? On the line of presumptive
ignorance. It is the tail of a head which has other prominent appendages, and it is
unfortunate for these writers, that they often put their names to their letters.
The Creation in the first chapter of Genesis, as shown in other pages, is not only an
historical fact which all human records confirm ; it is also a sublime scientific statement
demonstrated by every period of planetary motion that is known. Had Drummond
known this he would have hesitated to challenge the initial chapter of revelation, for
he would have found that the works and the word of God are inseparable. It has been
the crude and baseless system of our astronomy which has left a field for weeds of error.
We now plough them up. Not one of them will have room to grow. What has been
wanted was better science and more of it. Science has been brought into disrepute by
theories of contradiction. Sir Wm. Thompson has shown that the theories of geology
are unscientific and impossible, and that the claims of geologists to knowledge of the-
physical grounds of their theories are presumptuous and inadmissible..

The author solicits assistance for publishing an “Historical Bible.” It is about 200
years since Archbishop Usher placed years in the margin of the Bible, and as he used
u.c. and ad. years, which are not actual time, his work is misleading. The Historical
Bible gives the years on the a.m. principle, that is consecutive from year one to the
end of Scripture. They are thereby capable of addition, subtraction or division, and
as all the Bible years commence on the 20th September, the sun being on the autumnal
equinox on the “ fourth day ” of every solar year, as it was at Creation (Gen. i. 19),
the Biblical years are scientific by commencing where the sun begins them. It is im-
possible to err in the computation of the number of years from the point of Creation
when we have this equinox to guide us—equal day and night all over the world—be-
cause the eclipses mark off the succession of years. This precise system corroborates
all Scripture history, and gives the opportunity of obtaining the day of the week when-
ever a date is mentioned. It is not intended, however, to alter the English text of
the Authorised edition. All corrections relating to time, or explanations of important
and beautiful events, will be given as footnotes and marginal references. It is a great
pity that notwithstanding the advance of science (which is doing good service to the
Bible), and the discoveries of ancient inscriptions in Egypt and Babylonia, that the
Scriptures have been allowed to remain 200 years without deriving any advantage
from them. This is no doubt owing to the fact that at our Universities there are no
Professors of the Science of Time: hence scepticism increases and triumphs.
The Historical Bible is ready for printing, but before going to press, it is necessary
that £5OO should be subscribed, which would be a very profitable investment.

From the Royal Society.
“ Burlington House, London, Jan. Hth, 1881.
“ Sir.—l am directed by the Royal Society to express their thanks for your ‘AU Past
Time and Classification of the Eclipses,’ and to assure you that the Society deeply appre-
ciates this mark of consideration. I have the-honour to be,
‘ Sir, your obedient servant,
To Mr. J. B. Dimbleby. T. H. HUXLEY, (LL.D, to., Secretary.”
From the Royal Historical Society.
“ The subject to which you have devoted your attention is a most important one, and
the Council of this Society much commend your indefatigable labours.
London, July 31st, 1880. CHARLES ROGERS, LL.D.’’
Secretary [at that date.]
From the British Chronological Association.
“ Time is planetary motion, and therefore Chronology to be reliable npist be based
upon astronomical measurements and controlled by cycles. Mr. Dimbleby’s ‘All Past
Time’ is strictly a work of this character. His two ancient Luui-Solar Cycles—the
Antediluvian and Ancient Hebrew—arc the evidence of testimony, mathematical and
astronomical, and cannot be erroneous ; and as the first calculator of all the eclipses (and
transits), which he has succeeded in classifying and enumerating, he has proved himself to
be an eminent Chronologist, and conferred upon the world a priceless treasure.”
Memorial Hall, London Street, E- EDWARD REGINALD WRAITH.
» Dec. 16th, 1880. Secretary [at that date.]
Encouraging letters have filso been received from eminent scientific men, bishops, and
public men, rejoicing in the achievement of this work.
“This is a utilitarian age. Speciality is the order of the day. All work is done in do*
partments, and all science is conducted in the same method. If we want the best inform-
ation about the constitution of the strata of the earth, we should not go to the Royal
Geographical Society, but to the Geological Society. In like manner, if we wanted to
obtain the best means for improving our understanding of Chronology, we should not go
to the Royal Astronomical Society, whose members are busy in ascertaining the parallaxei
of stars and investigating the recesses of the universe, but to the British Chronological
Association, where we should find men with all kinds of Cycles, not one of which is
probably to be found in an observatory, and where men are to be met with who were born
Ghrouologists and have a speciality for this particular department of science. With great
respect to our professors of Astronomy, and the brilliancy of their achievements, to go to
them on questions of years and time would be like taking a lady’s gold watch to an en-
gineer for repairs. Gifted as that engineer might be in his own great and useful depart-
ment of knowledge, he would be unable to accomplish the work we want or have the
requsite tools. This is a proper illustration, and the imperfect knowledge of Chronology
in the minds of mankind is a proof of the correctness of the statement. Happily for us,
men who are gifted in Chronology have in recent years been stimulated to bend their
minds to a more detailed study of this science, and have worked and thought out various
cycles of time on the stern principle of astronomical measurement. With these Chronolo-
gists can face a world of theorists. Such controlling cycles are like so many tools in the
hands of a skilled artisan, and by them Chronologists have obtained results which Astron-
omers could not supply. At all events they have not done so. Chronology is the science
which has pointed out the clock-like mechanism of the skies, detected the order of th#
eclipses, enumerated all the transits, and supplied mankind with practical and unerring
means for testing the periods of the history of the world. The result is Chronology, as an
• exact science,’ comes before mankind with a teeming harvest of new facts."
