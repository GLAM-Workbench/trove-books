PART I.
FLAGS USED IN THE DOMINIONS AND COLONIES.
1. The Royal Standard will be flown at Government House on the King’s
Birthday, and on the days of His Majesty’s Accession and Coronation.
2. The Union Flag, without the Badge of the Dominion or Colony, will be flown
at Government House from sunrise to sunset on other days.
3. The Union Flag, with the approved Badge of the Dominion or Colony
emblazoned in the centre thereof on a white shield surrounded by a green* garland, as
shown on plate No. 4, will be used by a Governor, or by a Lieutenant-Governor or
other Officer administering a Government, when embarked in a boat or other vessel.
4. The British Blue Ensign with the Badge of the Dominion or Colony em-
blazoned in the centre of the fly ( i.e ., in the centre of that part between the Union
Jack and the end of the Flag), and the pendant, as shown on plate No. 5, will be
flown by all armed vessels which belong to or are in the service of the Government
of a Dominion or Colony. Such vessels when not armed will fly a similar Blue Ensign
but no pendant.
5. All other vessels registered as belonging to His Majesty’s subjects in His
Majesty’s Dominions, Colonies or Dependencies will fly the Red Ensign without any
Badge, unless otherwise authorised by Warrant from His Majesty or from the
Admiralty. Such Warrants have been issued in the case of Canada, the Common-
wealth of Australia, and New Zealand. (For drawings of these Ensigns, see plates.)
Colonial Merchant vessels may carry distinguishing flags with the Badge of the
Dominion or Colony thereon, in addition to the Red Ensign, provided that such
flags do not infringe Section 73 (2) of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.
Note. —The white circles within which some of the Badges are shown on the
plates are not to appear on the Blue and Red Ensigns except where they are
necessary to display the designs of the Badges, e.y., where the Badge itself has a
border of the same colour as the Ensign.
* The garland consists, in the case of Canada of maple leaves [see plate B], in the case of New
Zealand of fern leaves [see plate 14], and in other cases of laurel leaves.

The practice has been in regard to the dimensions of Flags generally to make the
length twice the breadth at the head ; generally the proportions of the several warts
will be as follow :
Note (4). —A Flag of 10 Breadths measures 7 ft. 6 ins. in width by 15 ft. in length.
Note (B). —As the Breadths of the Red and Narrow White Stripes of the St. Patrick’s and
St. Andrew’s Crosses are together equal to the Broad White of the St. Andrew’s Cross, the centre
line of these three parts, which will be one edge of the Red Cross, should form a diagonal to the
Union Flag, observing that the Broad White should be on the upper part of the Cross in the quarters
at the Head of the Union Flag, and on the lower part of the Cross in the quarters at the Fly.
