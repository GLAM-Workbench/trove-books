INTRODUCTION.
The peculiar business of a Private Inquiry Office
is one which has been called into existence in
modern times, by the necessities of rapidly ex-
tending commerce, and the wonderful expansion of
population all over the globe. The business of
such an office is of so varied and peculiar a nature
that very few persons are aware of its extent, or of
the advantages which it is able to afford to persons
in need of information or advice. For the infor-
mation of such the following lines have been
written, but it must be borne in mind, that it is
impossible by any enumeration to do more than
convey a general idea of the business, which has
for its general objects the aim of furnishing infor-
mation to inquirers, of almost every nation ; and
of discharging commissions of almost every kind.
In a new country, such as Victoria or the ad-
jacent colonies, where a sparse population is
scattered over an immense territory, it often hap-
pens that persons get lost to their friends at home.
pens that persons get lost to their friends at home.


Wright and Co., 44 Little Collins Street West,
Discouraged by want of success, or ashamed of the
poverty which has constantly followed them, many
persons well connected at home have ceased to
maintain a correspondence with their friends ; and
often a parent?s heart is saddened with the re-
flection, that a well-remembered son or daughter is
practically dead to them, dead may be in sad
reality, or suffering from destitution, or disgraced.
In the agony of suspense, parents and relations
wish for certain information regarding the fate of
their friends, and to all such, the Private Inquiry
Office furnishes a suitable medium for making the
necessary researches.
For similar reasons, husbands and fathers who
have come out to the colonies in the hope of
succeeding in making a home for their families
have ceased correspondence. Hope long deferred
has at last sickened the heart, disappointment and
sorrow have done their work, and the man has felt
that it would be better for his family if he were
even dead ; under the influence of this natural but
mistaken notion he has buried himself in the bush,
and allowed his friends to suppose that he is gone,
forgetting the while, that in the heart of a loving
wife there is a power of endurance and hope which
cannot be destroyed. The Private Inquiry Office
furnishes an admirable means of ascertaining the
fate of friends, or making inquiries of a private
and delicate nature ; deserted or neglected wives


Melbourne , Victoria. Agents all parts of the World.
can thus communicate with their husbands without
any public scandal; children can be brought home
to anxious parents, and everything is done quietly
and with inviolable secrecy.
It often happens, too, in this age of travelling
and immigration, that persons are sought for to
whom property has been bequeathed in other lands,
large sums of money are left on the executors?
hands, a source of anxiety and annoyance, because
the heir cannot be traced or his identity established.
In all such cases, and where parties in the colony
wish to make inquiries regarding property else-
where, to which they may be entitled, the services
of a practised and energetic agent are invaluable.
It is an important part of his profession to search
out the lost, and discover the evidence necessary to
establish identity or to substantiate claims. An old
proverb affirms ?that practice makes perfect,? and
so it is that experience in this particular depart-
ment is the principal guarantee of ultimate success.
It will readily occur to every one that for a stranger
in the colony, or one not familiar with this class of
inquiries, it is a very hopeless attempt to try to
discover missing friends, but the experienced agent
has every advantage which the nature of the case
admits of. He has correspondents and agents,
trained to this class of pursuit, in every part of
the continent; the press is open to him as to others,
and he has access to all the information and assist-
ance which the public offices can supply.
In the Legal Department, the office undertakes
to serve legal documents of every description, with
certainty and promptitude ; to hunt up evidence ;


Wkight and Co., 44 Little Collins Street West,
to discover missing parties ; to conduct difficult or
delicate negotiations ; to borrow money, or to lend
it on good security ; and in every possible way to
prove a useful auxiliary to the legal profession.
Merchants and business men generally would
often find it greatly to their advantage to avail
themselves of the peculiar facilities for obtaining
information which are open to the Inquiry Agent
alone. Many thousands of pounds are annually
lost in this colony and elsewhere through the diffi-
culty which exists of acquiring reliable information
regarding business connection, and in almost all
such cases the losses may be avoided by seeking the
assistance of a practical Inquiry Agent.
During the time we have been established suffi-
cient cases have been entrusted to us to fill a large
volume, but to publish any of them would be a
serious breach of confidence.
We may mention that one of the Firm, Mr.
Wright, was formerly an officer of the Victorian
Detective Police.

This is to certify that Mr, J. T. Wright was engaged
for several months as messenger in the Insolvent Estate
of John Taylor, his (Mr. Wright?s) services having been
secured on account of suspicions that were entertained
by the Australian Joint-Stock Bank, that Taylor haid
illegally made away with valuable assets in fraud of
the Bank and other creditors. Taylor was indicted in
conjunction with one James Iron, for conspiracy to
defraud his creditors, and after considerable difficulty
the charge was brought home, and they, Taylor and
Iron, were both convicted. Mr. Wright behaved
throughout the business with coolness, judgment, and
fidelity, and I can recommend him for any affair re-
quiring those qualities.
