To the Members of the Ballarat
TEMPERANCE LE AGUE
WHO INTEND GIVING A CHARITABLE ENTERTAINMENT, FOR THE
PROVISION OF WINTER COMFORTS
FOR THE POOR CHINESE LEPERS,
WILLIAM STITT JENKINS
Of Geelong,
AFFECTIONATELY DEDICATES THIS PROLOGUE.
To-night—to-night come hither, great and small;
Come on, ye kindly souls, and fill the hall;
With one consent come—aid us all you can,
To cheer in his distress our brother man.
Who from the balmy shores of far Cathay
Has, to the golden regions, found his way;
And, by a dire disease sore stricken down,
Implores the help of our right noble town.
Poor John, from China, now lies “-welly bad;”
Hungry and cold is he, and poorly clad;
The wind and rain will pierce him to the bone, —
For he no shelter has, nor happy home:
Far, far away from his loved native shore,
Which he, perchance, (poor soul), will see no more;
He humbly bows him ’neath affliction’s rod.
And pleads for aid in the great name of God,
The Lord, the Great Creator, wise and good.
Who formed each tribe and nation of one blood,
A new commandment brought us from above—
That we in heart and soul each other love;
Nor e’er let clime or color brothers part,
But to our home, our country, and our heart.
Let all be welcome in their hour of need;
So shall we prove our friendship true indeed.
Ye who with love would hail your fellow man—
Ye who desire to help him all you can—
Ye who in paths of peace would set him right,
With one accord assemble here to night.
And cheer for Sergeant Lamer— honest, brave and true.
Who for poor John does all that man can do;
May length of days and happiness attend
On him, who oft lias proved the poor man’s friend.
