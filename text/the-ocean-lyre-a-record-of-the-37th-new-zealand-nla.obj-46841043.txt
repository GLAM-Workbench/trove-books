When Omer smote ’is bloomin’ lyre,
Ed ’card folks sing by land and sea ;
And what e thought ’e might require,
E went and took, the same as me.
They knew e stole, e knew they knowed ;
They didn’t stare or make a fuss,
But winked at ’Omer down the road,
And e winked back—the same as us. — KIPLING.
EDITORIAL.
In issuing this souvenir of the
deeds and misdeeds of the 37th
Artillery at sea, we venture to
think that not only the men of this
reinforcement, who have lived to-
gether, slept together, and worked
together for the best part of ten
months, but also their relatives and
friends, will see in the pages of this
souvenir a relic of the not alto-
gether unhappy days spent during
the course of their training and
“the trip across.”
Every publication has an indi-
viduality of its own. The atmo-
sphere of “The Ocean Lyre” is
distinctly Field Artillery, and
while the majority of artillerymen
can appreciate the matter within
its pages, it may prove a sealed
book to outsiders.
The “swank” of the N.Z.F.A.
has indeed some foundation and
fact. The boys, when in the public
eye, have an unmistakable convic-
tion that “the light, elastic step of
the Field Artillery can easily be
distinguished from the heavy tread
of other regiments.” And it is good
esprit-de-corps.
As the reinforcement will in all
probability be broken up when
they reach their destination, a final
roll call and photograph of the 37th
Artillery, together with a few anec-
dotes and sketches, seems to be a
fitting souvenir for the old “Rag-
time Army.”
The thanks of the boys are due
to our contributors, and also to our
artist friend, Private Toomer, of
the Medical Corps.
In parting we would say to the
37th Artillery: You will see many
strange sights, strange customs,
and will be subjected to many temp-
tations ; but, boys, play the game,
the clean game that you have played
uu till now, and always remember
that you were the old 37th, and
remember New Zealand.

THE HISTORY OF THE 37th N.Z. FIELD ARTILLERY.
An “Abstract and Brief Chronicle.”
This is a chronicle of small
things. There are no heroics in
our career. We have been com
demned to the humdrum work of
preparation, and shall never, as a
unit, undergo the supreme test of
our training in battle. It is one of
the tragedies of a Reinforcement
that, after months of comradeship
which has moulded us into a com-
plete unit, we must disintegrate and
lose our corporate identity in the
large unit which we go to reinforce.
This record is therefor© merely a
framework on which to hang a thou-
sand memories of good times
together, a reminder of a host of
minor incidents and persons which,
unimportant to the outside world,
are yet dear to the hearts of the
*7th Artillery.
A Reinforcement is born on
mobilisation, which in our case took
place on August 22, 1917, the Can-
terbury draft coming in first, then
Otago and Southland, Wellington,
Auckland, and Hawke’s Bay. ” We
were then known as the 33rd Rein-
forcement. At that time Lieut. H.
A. Swarbrick was 0.C., with Second
Lieut. B. J. Russell second in com-
mand, and an N.C.O. class consist-
ing of the following :—Q.M.iS. Ed-
monds, Sergts. O’Donoghue (acting
B. Barclay, Knights, and
Power; Corpls. Mclnnes, Fulton,
Scott, Bull, and Hebenton ; Bombs.
Gurney and Gillespie. The first
week was spent in outfitting, learn-
ing camp rules and routine, and
generally settling down to military
life, after which we commenced
work in earnest.


For the first three weeks this was
“ paddock ” work, squad drill, foot
drill, rifle exercises, and musketry
—a dreary time enough. The last
Friday of the three weeks was occu-
pied by a march to the rifle range
at Papawai Camp to fire our mus-
ketry course, a seven mile tramp
which we achieved in good time and
without a single casualty. We were
accompanied by the 36th officers and
N.C.O.’s class. Every member of
the draft passed the prescribed test.
The following day commenced our
real training as field artillerymen.
We were marched over to “ stables”
—what happy recollections does the
word evoke! —given a lecture! on
“Animal Management” by Capt.
Wilson, and turned in to groom,
water, and feed the horses. Next
week the draft was divided up into
runners, drivers, and staff, and
handed over to their respective
instructors for individual training,
Capt. Wilson and his staff taking
drivers, Sergt.-Major Ryan the
staff, and our own section com-
manders and N.C.O.’s the gunners.
After some preliminary training in
standing gun drill on the wagons,
we graduated on to the guns, and a
special snuad was selected for train-
ing on the 4.5 howitzer.
About this stage Corpls. Fulton
and Mclnnes were “boarded out”
as medically unfit, and Bomb. Bulli-
vant was transferred from the 32nd
to take over our howitzer squad.
Soon afterwards we lost Corpl. He-
benton through an attack of appen-
dicitis, and Gunner Hunter was
promoted bombardier and took over
the staff. Other promotions to bom-
bardiers were Gunners Barry.
Dickey, Elvidge, and Hawke and
Driver Rowlands. Bomb. Bullivant
became corporal, and then sergeant.
At intervals Gunners, Henderson,
Crimp, Crawford. Armstrong, and
Morrison, and Driver Best were
promoted bombardiers . Gunner
Simmonds was promoted bombar-
dier just prior to embarkation.
Bombs. Elvidge, Barry, Dickey, and
Hawke became corporals. Sergt.
Bullivant was boarded out, and
Corpl. Elvidge took his place as ser-
geant, Bomb. Crimp becoming cor-
poral. Sergt. O’Donoghue had been
promoted to battery sergeant-major
late in September. Shoeing-Smith
Wimsett became corporal shoeing
spiith Bomb. Hunter was pro-
moted to corporal just prior to em-
barkation.
Individual training continued
through September and October,
work on the guns and horses being
. varied with lectures, trench mor-
tars, bridge-building, pick and
shovel work, and route marches.
Battery training commenced in
November, when the first trek was
held at Pigeon Bush. In November,
owing to the shortening up of the
supply of reinforcements, our num-
ber was changed to 35th. In Novem-
ber Corpl. Bull was “boarded out”
and Bomb. Henderson was trans-
ferred out, owing to getting “leave
without pay.”
On December 18 we went on
Christmas Leave of three weeks on
full pay. Arriving back to camp on
January 9, we had the doubtful
honour of bringing in and reclaim-
ing the horses, which had been
turned out to graze during Christ-
mas leave, which we accomplished
with no more serious accidents than
a few jibs and bucks. A few weeks
later an outbreak of measles con-
fined nearly half the Battery to iso-
lation camp, and during their ab-
sence the Reinforcement had their
first “all night” trek, bivouacing
on Morrison’s Farm, near the Rua-
wahanga River. At this time we
lost Second Lieut. Russell, who
sailed with the 34ths, and, after
some delay, his place was taken by
Segpnd Lieut. Hutchinson. Corpl.
Scott was transferred out on ob-
taining leave without pay.
Battery training was now tjie
order of the daw, treks being held
two, or three times a week, and
“speeding up” of individual work
occupving the remaining davs. We
bad another “all night” trek, con-
cluding with reveille at 2.30 a.m.,
and a march back to camp in the
dark. Somewhere in March we were
honoured bv being detailed to give
an exhibition of field manoeuvres
for a moving picture. In January
we became 36th, and in February,
37th Reinforcement.
On March 8 we bad om “ shoot ”
firing three 18-pr. and one 4.5
howitzer series, Second Lieut.
Mitchell assisting the Battery as
section commander. Good shooting
wa« achieved by the 18-prs . the
howitzer series being spoiled by an
accident to the howitzer. Another
moving picture was taken of the
Battery trotting into action.


A few days after the shoot came
the Featherston Military Sports, at
which the Artillery easily secured
the points prize. Only two exclu-
sively artillery competitions were
put on, one for Section Gun Drill
and one for a Subsection Alarm.
The 37ths won both competitions,
easily outdistancing the other drafts
in speed and equalling them in drill
and smartness. In the first com-
petition Second Lieut. Hutchison
was section commander, with Sergts.
Knights and Elvidge as Nos. 1; in
the second, Sergt. Barclay was No.
1. This performance reflects great
credit on both teams, especially
when it is remembered that we had
to compete with a senior reinforce-
ment.
Two days later the Reinforcement
went on leave without pay for five
Weeks—all, that is, except thirty
unfortunates who were required for
guard duty at Ripa Island and in
Wellington—a monotonous duty and
a sore disappointment. On April
30 we returned to camp, spent a
furious four days preparing for em-
barkation, and entrained for Well-
ington on May 5. The transport
not being ready, we had four days’
leave in Wellington, and finally
sailed in the “Maunganui”
(H.M..N.Z.T: 103) on May 9.
SHIP’S SPORTS.
The monotony of the sight of the
never-ending sea was much relieved
by the weekly sports held each
Saturday.
Inter-Company Competitions
were arranged, the N.Z.F.A. Medi-
cal Corps and Flying Corps cadets
forming one company. Our com-
petitions were held in ideal weather,
the ball being set rolling with blind-
fold boxing, finally ending with A.
C. Sutherland winning, his mess-
room pal, Barry D. G., being run-
ner-up. Lazystick competitors now
taced the barrier; lead driver Bomb.
Rowlands hopped out early, but had
to go all the way to beat his wheel,
Jim McConnell.
Mockridge and Dan then entered
the four-foot arena, the big bird
finally outing the bantam. Great
amusement prevailed when Guthrie
and Murray, B P., hopped in the
ring; length of legs more than skill
won this contest. This competition
was not finished. Parsons, of the
Flying Corps, won the Artists’ Race,
but had to go “all out” to beat
our “ Encyclopaedia,” Dan. The
Potato Race was also unfinished,
Murray, A. Corp. Crimp, Parsons,
and Matheson being those left for
the final.
Most amusing was the Pillow
Fighting, Jack Ferrier finally win-
ning from Norman Barker after a
good even contest.
Dan and B. P. had a go, B. P.
finally beating him without a hit;
in fact, Dan blew himself off with
a mighty swipe- -that missed.
Four teams lined up for the Tug
of War. Left Section beat the
Right; Flying Corps beat the Medi-
cals ; and, finally, the Left Section.
The Ship’s Finals were held on
June 22, the Battery doing fairly
well, Corp. Dickey winning the
Boot and Puttee Race and A. Mur-
ray runner-up in the Potato Race.
BOXING.
The Ship’s Championships were
held in ideal conditions, Artillery
holding their own, B. P. Murray
winning the Heavies and Mock-
ridge runner-up in the Feathers.
Good fights were also put up by
Bramwell and Barry.
Our own Dick Mayze refereed all
fights, and his decisions were de-
liberate and never questioned.
PARS.
That Gordon Bramwell was the
best all-round boxer in the com-
petitions.
That Mock had a growth on his
chin long enough to earn his dis-
qualification.
That B. P. is a budding Jesse
Willard.
That the “Bagpiper” made
things hot for “Bernie.”
That Joe Armstrong and Allan
Holliss lost a lot of sweat “ swing-
ing it.”
That the defeat in the tug-of-war
was caused by “want of neglect”
on the part of the Nos. I.


Our O.C.
DON’T.
Think that the officers have no
hearts. The following touch of home
was overheard in the “ Canal ” :
Lieut. C. : “ What is that bell
ringing ? ’ ’
Capt. O. : “ The last tram for
Kelburn, Bill! ”
Worry the O.C. ; the sea sees to
that.
Believe the story that ‘ ‘ Beer-
pip ” saw a fight between a sea-ser-
pent and a submarine.
“ You know the nature of an
oath?” asked the O.C. at a court
martial. “Well, I ought to, sir,”
replied the driver. ‘‘ I belong to the
37th Artillery ! ”
Expect to see everything you have
written in the “Ocean Lyre,” as a
fair amount of copy has been
handed over to the “Ocean Atlan-
tic. ’ ’
Misunderstand the notice at the
foot of the companion-way:
“ Troops must not loiter here; only
officers.”
Wipe your hands on the mess
orderlies’ dish towels.
Ask the O.C. the difference
between an air vent and a coal
shoot.
VEGETABLE FATIGUE ABROAD.
A Personal Experience.
When the Artillery were Unit for
Duty, the B.S.M. found it neces-
sary to include the writer in the
above fatigue ’Tis a way he has !
There’s nothing anyone can say to
the contrary will convince the S.M.
that gunners are not meant for
fatigues, and, conversely, fatigues
for gunners. One may kick against
fatigues until one is blue in the
face; it is all in vain. The imper-
turbable face of the man with the
crown is ever unsympathetic where
the man in the ranks is concerned.
To resume my story. At first I
was of opinion my particular work
would be some such “ pet job’’ as
peeling “spuds”—and other fruit.
But any illusions I may have had
in this direction were soon dispelled.
To avoid misunderstanding at the
outset, let me inform my readers I
had been chosen for a fatigue all
right. There could be no doubt of
that. But the word vegetable must
have a very wide meaning. In fact,
even now I find myself turning over
the pages of a dictionary. But 1
have come to the conclusion the
dictionary is incomplete.
Well, our party was marched
down to the galley. My mate and
I were set in motion emptying half
a dozen scrap tins. Up companion-
ways we struggled. Our minds were
clouded with a doubt. Instinctively
we felt an aversion to vegetarians
and things vegetarian. Our first
task finished, we were requested to
empty ashes and clean out fires. I
do not think I should dwell on this
part of the vegetable fatigue.
At this stage we were beginning
to feel a bit “ fed up ” with the
war. Then, somehow, a broom each
was jnmhed into our hands and,
while one of those “cook’s
shadows ’ spilt cups of water about
the deck, we had to follow him up
and pretend to be scrubbing. Was
there no limit to indignities con-
fronting us ?
But the climax came when, with
a short, square-mouthed shovel, I
had to chase the water along the
deck, pick it up, and carefully place
it in a bucket.
And so ended the “Vegetable”
Fatigue! “ ’Nuff sed.”
PoNTY.


Dear Tamati, — How all you fellow
in Poneke getting on? Py corry it te
very long time since I leave there. We
leave Werrington that day I see you
last time. Next day when I wake up
in te morning I look out te window

fellow in my bunk. I tell him get out,
and he tell me go to hell. Then te
plurry big row happen. Anyway I
sleep on deck. A 1 te same. Next time
I go to bed very quick. That te good
way. What you think ? Py ( corry
Tamati when I want fe wash here I only
find te salt water. That game no good !
When I get te Old Country I have te
very big wash in te clean water. Some
time we have plenty fun on Saturday.
They have te Sport. Two fellow have
te boxing fight with te blindfole. They
hit te wrong way all te time. Then te
Corpiril he get in te way and one
fellow hit him a big crack. Then all te

long time. Any way all right now.
Don't you fellow worry about me. I
te soldier now. I go away fight for
King and Country. I think I te big
Rangatira. But some time I feel very
lonely. I go on deck in te night and
think of all you fellow far away in
Poneke. That make me very sad. But
me try and forget. Be back soon when
I smash all te German Kaisers. To-
day we have te alarm. That te time
when te bugle go very loud and all te
soldier run up on deck with te lifebelt.
That te practice when te submarine he

A LETTER.
I WONDER.
I wonder if the bits of boys they
Decorate with stripes
Can conjugate the verb “to obey,”
Every tense, by cripes!
I wonder if the Sergeant-Major
Really is a god ;
Otherwise his loud behaviour
Seems extremely odd.
I wonder if the junior Sub.
Dreams a day when he
Shall reprimand and even snub
The Adjutant—d.v.
But most I wonder if you wonder
What the gunner’s for;
Well, he’s the bloke who, while they
thunder,
Wins the bloody war.
Hornchurch.
I wonder if the senior Captain
Really made the earth,
And was wholly, solely wrapped in
Red tape at his birth.
I wonder if the rotund Major’s
Language is divine.
When our dressing is outrageous
In the battery’s line.
I wonder why a brevet Colonel
Always seems to think
That the discipline’s infernal—
'Till he’s had a drink !

LA TRINO.
(The Truth.)
That Gunner Moßobie has been
granted a commission in the Flying
orps —teaching semaphore.
That Toby Cameron intends living
under the Stars and Bars when he has
thrashed the Kaiser.
That our Mess-dis-orderlies should
he good debt collectors “ alter the
war.”
That the Battery Sergeant-Major is
a perfect organiser of Labour.
That Farrier-Corporal George Wim-
eett is some comic singer.
That the 37th had a comfortable
voyage —they brought their Holmes
with them.
That Captain G. is popular with the
boys; so much so, that they hope- to
have the pleasure of seeing him in
That the Editor would be glad if
the man who stole his shovel would call
“for the pick.”
That one of the finest exponents of
the English ornamental language is
Daly ; to be found at the Mess table.
That Driver Stewart is so enamoured
with his experiences at sea, that he is
seriously thanking of severing his rural
connection, and taking on a sea-faring
life for a crust.
That Gunners St. Clair and Holmes
accepted the Order of the Bath, not to
be free from parades, but because they
had the war at heart.
That since he joined the Army,
Driver IMcQuillan has learned nothing
he did not know before. He hasn’t
this on his own.
That a member of the Battery still
insists that the war will bei “ over on
Tuesday.”
That there was a break in the wires
between Dick Mockridge and the "tin
hats. ’ ’ Otherwise, a man with his kit-
bag branded 21st Rfts. would not be
hurried away with the 37ths.
That Fat Dan the soldier will soon
be broad enough to occupy the places
of 2,3, and 9 on the gun-limber.
That poor old “Joe” lost his locks,
his hoot, and his biscuits on board
That the enemy will have no com-
plaints to make about our Trench Mor-
tars : they are interesting, instructive,
and amusing.
That the following notice was taken
from the 37th Artillery mess-room:—
NOTICE.
I hereby offer one golden sovereign
for information leading to the detec-
tion of the rascal who hurled a piece
of butter with bread on it at my head
as I was seated in the mess-room, par-
taking of my evening meal. For the
detection of future offenders I offer
the following prices :
Cheese 15s.
Spoon full of jam 255.
Plate of porridge 40s.
Golden syrup on bread....£l (note, not
_ . , gold.)
Bread, without butter, syrup, or jam,
ss.
(iSigned) Dickey-bird', Cpl.
That although there are no horses
aboard the Maunganui, race meetings
are of frequent occurrence.
That the gunner or driver who cannot
procure the articles he requires for
Kit Inspection is not to be found in
the 37th Artillery.
That every time a mess orderly is
heard to swear one penny is collected
for a relief fund ; already the sum of 4d.
has been realised.
That a large number of the boys find
the sun very much to their liking—be-
hind the Dispensary.
That Guth and Ferry have decided
to have one at the first port, but “ it
must be a small one.”
That on coming aboard, each of the
37th Artillery was given a cake of
coal-tar soap, especially suited for
Salt Water ablutions. Some doubt
existed in the minds of the boys as to
whether this one cake was to last for
the whole of the voyage or for ever.
However, they were given to under-
stand that all that was necessary was
to show the Quartermaster the rem-
nant, when a fresh cake would be im-
mediately forthcoming. In cases
where none of the original piece re-
mained, it would be sufficient to show
one’s neck.
That iSootty still retains the dollar
that was paid to him at Norfolk.


That a curious complaint, thought to
have been brought aboard by the
Bath-room orderlies, spread with great
rapidity to the Ship’s Police and
Ship’s gunners, has, so far, completely
baffled the doctors. Most of the Artil-
lery are slightly affected.
That one sergeant at least did not
find Norfolk a dry town.
A heavy “Snow ” storm occurred in
the mess-room during the voyage.
Luckily he: did not have his bag of
bottles.
After fig-pudding, visits to the Dis-
pensary are as frequent as a C.B. man
chasing the bugle.
That Bombardier Joe has money to
lend at current rate of interest ; thanks
to the fleetness of Desert Gold and
Biplane.
That three Artillery sergeants, two.
days out from England, after pooling
their respective wealth, found they
had the sum of 2s. 7d. in English
money, 2 nickels, 1 dime, 3 cents, and
two canteen tickets—grand total,
3s. What on earth did they do
with their pay?
That the S.S. Corporal reported that
one gunner suffering from cold in the
head had to go to the ’Nihilation room.
That a gunner handed over to Scotty
his weekly donation—a quarter dollar.
The bag-piper looked at it sideways,
but after it was explained that its value
was Is. o£d., the smile that lit his face'
was good to see.
At Ocean View, watching the
bathers.
First Gunner: “Look! Is that a
shark out there? ”
Second Gunner: “Yes, that is Mr.
Strawberry, the lawyer, from New-
Zealand.”
“ Forty years on, when afar and
asunder,
Parted are those who are with us
to-day ;
When we look back and forgetfully
wonder,
What we were like in our work and
our play.”
Practically a year has now elapsed
since the venerable 37th N.Z.F.A.
sprang into existence. Our thoughts fly
back to that red-letter day, when home
and friends were left behind, and new
and sterner pursuits commenced at
Featherston. After the arrival at
Camp, one remembers the hurried pas-
sage through the “sausage machine,”
effecting the lightning transformation
from civy to soldier.
Then came W ORK in earnest. That
monotonous month of foot-drill and rifle
exercises. One soon grew accustomed
to keeping “heels together and in line.
. . .” It is certain that sections
14 to 20, F.A.T. received a thorough
thrashing. Aching limbs did not tend
to make us form very favourable im-
pressions of soldiering, and Bill Mas-
sey’s hobnails did not “ lighten” our
troubles. Soon, however, such mere
inconveniences were forgotten.
Fatigues were not looked upon in too.
favourable a light, and duty on the
vehicle, which everyone unanimously
declared should be “ rubber-tyred,”
was particularly disliked. Combatting
nauseating aromas was evidently un-
favoured by our dashing gunners.
Then came our work on the good old
18-pbunder. Very soon the intricacies
of gun drill were surmounted, and the
INTER NOS.
more practical part of our training en-
gaged upon. The memorable contests
in fire discipline never failed to elicit
keen interest and competition. That
oft-heard command, “Halt, Action
Front,” followed by an almost unin-
telligible repetition by the Nos. 1 ; the
excited roar, “Limber, drive on,” and
the trail would swing round; a momen-
tary lull, then, “No. . . . , ready to
open fire, sir.” Everyone will remem-
B. S.-M.
“You’re always laughing.”

ber the enthusiasm and good-natured
rivalry that existed between A and C
subs.
Following came our introduction to
the celebrated Captain Wilson, better
and more appropriately known as
“ Blazer.” His edifying lectures on
“Animal Management” and “Equita-
tion” are only too well remembered.
And how he loved to pose before the
feminine gender. Even now I can pic-
ture the “ Old Man,” astride his well-
groomed chestnut charger, riding down
the lines, one eye shut, but the other
orb, alert to discover the slightest
error. His tongue, too, was quite as
keen as his sight; it was, in fact, “ like
the burnished blade.” In the Bullring
we soon learned how thorough a master
he was of the most lurid epithets to
which the English language unfortu-
nately lends itself. How our sympathy
went out to our poor N.C.O.’s, who,
for “want of neglect,” were very, yes,
very often chided in the aforementioned
glowing vernacular. During an exas-
perating morning’s work, the irate old
chap would spitefully declare, “ Thank
God we have a Navy.” The name of
our rotund and' much-respected
mounted instructor, has been immor-
talised in that expressive ballad, “ No
more polishing harness,” etc.
At the memorable Military Tourna-
ment, one remembers with just pride
how nobly we proved our worth; how,
indeed, we proved ourselves the
“crack” battery. Even the senior
draft suffered defeat from our unspar-
ing hands, both in the section gun drill
and night alarm contests. As winners,
too, for outside events, the names of our
gunners were not among the missing.
As a side-line to our training came
that “ deadly and effective weapon ”
the 2-in. trench mortar, Mk 1 or 2, I
forget which. The redoubtable Tock
Emma Jimmy must have expended illi-
mitable energy, endeavouring to im-
press upon our feeble understanding
that his dearly-beloved weapon was
certainly “no fool of a contrivance.”
When the drill grew somewhat irksome
(it very often did), Mr. Faraday’s
gentle yet firm, “ Now, then, you
N.C.O.’s,” would set us to our tasks
with redoubled vim and energy.
But all such good times are over.
Now, as an erstwhile poet-laureate has
written, “We must take and work our
blooming guns.” Soon we will be
parted from old friends and associates.
However far apart our paths may lead,
nought can sever the friendships, nor
obliterate memories of our pleasant
days at Featherston. So 37ths, Kia Ora
and Cheero.
GEO. ELVIDGE.
FAREWELL, NEW ZEALAND.
Farewell, dear New Zealand, my
native land, good-bye;
Your well-loved shores I’m leaving,
the sea mists dim my eye ;
The verdant, fertile valleys, the dis-
tant mountains blue,
The spreading plain, with golden
grain, call me back to you ;
The reckless, roaring torrents, the
smiling placid streams,
Flit in grand procession thro’ the
mirror of my dreams.
The myst’ry of the bushlands, that
turns unrest to calm,
And fills the heart with longing to
learn the hidden charm.
Full many a day I’ve wandered and
walked where Nature led,
In silent contemplation of the feast
before me spread.
I bless the Great Creator for grace
to understand
And love the boundless treasures of
my dear native land.
But now with war-drums beating,
with measured tread and slow,
I leave you, O, my country, I leave
your shores and go.
I see the great battalions, as they
bear the battle’s brunt,
And batt’ry after batt’ry swing to
“action front.”
The fearless flying pilots that skim
the fringe of space,
Whirling to destruction with a
smile upon each face.
I see the stealthy squadrons o’er
darkened waters creep,
And engines grim and fearful flash-
ing thro’ the deep.
0 God, in Thy great purpose make
my duty plain,
And in my humble service, let it
be not in vain.
My comrades, 0, my comrades,
o’er flood and field and floe,
1 hear you ever calling—l lift my
Cross and go.
Farewell, dear New Zealand, my
native land, good-bye,
Your well-loved shores I’m leaving,
the sea mists dim my eye;
But with a glad awak’ning, when
wars and strife are o’er,
I’ll roam again your happy isles in
peace for evermore.

THE TRANSFORMER.
Could one have taken some few
months ago a bird’s-eye view of New
Zealand there would have been jeen
the members of our Battery at their
various occupations.
In this busy town we see a well-
dressed civilian hurrying to and
from his place of business; in this
lonely country district we see a soli-
tary farmer slowly follow.ng his
sluggish team. Far in the north
among the creaking pines me ring
of the bushman’s axe resounds
through the lonely forest. Here we
see the merry student as he care-
lessly wends his way ; there the clerk
or engineer. Each in his ov/n sphere
plays a part which forms a cog in
the mighty machinery of the uni-
verse.
Again we look.
Our Mr. Smith, armed with his
tin plate and mug, awaits his turn
to receive his due amount of Mas-
sey’s stew. lie is not the smart civi-
lian of a week ago. Where are his
white collar, his tan boots, his walk-
ing-stick.
Convicts ! you say. And yet, hid-
den beneath that denim garb beats
the same heart of the same man
who yesterday played his part in
another and different world.
To ask our dignified civilian to
wash his own clothes, to peel
potatoes, to scrub floors, to sweep
streets, would be to speak of the
ludicrous and impossible. But in
this new world he can accomplish
the impossible; his slightest task
accompanied always by a little
grousing, the privilege, it is said,
of every soldier.
See these men going on leave. See
them returning. -See them huddled
on a transport. To every circum-
stance they seem to adapt them-
selves.
Civilian—soldier. War, indeed,
is a wonderful transformer.

“THE PERFECT MAN”
There is a man who never drinks,
Nor smokes, nor chews, nor
swears,
Who never gambles, never flirts,
And shuns all sinful snares.—
He’s paralysed.
Tin re is a man who never does
Anything that is not right.
His wife can tell just where he is
At morning, noon, and night.- -
He’s dead.


GUNNERS AND DRIVERS.
To the Editor.
Sir, —Whenever two or three are
gathered together in the Artillery’s
name, there invariably ensues a
warm discussion as to the merits
and demerits of drivers and gunners
as a class.
It is only fair to state at the out-
set that the writer is neither. He
is only an N.C.O.
It is submitted by the gunner that
it is he who does “ all ” the work
of the battery; that he is capable
of doing, not only his own work,
but that of the driver also; while
it is equally the opinion of the
driver that he alone is the motive
power, the driving force, of the bat-
tery. He points out the gunner
behind his gun-shield is practically
immune from the dangers in the
field, to which the driver must be
exposed. He speaks of the un-
doubted bravery and heroism of the
drivers in bringing the guns into
action and taking the horses to the'
rear. The gunner caustically re-
marks of the safety of the horse-
lines, at the rear, and mentions the
fact that in man-handling the guns
he performs the work of horses. Thus
the discussion wages. Questions,
begging phrases, are not wanting,
for one side has been known to greet
a newcomer in such terms, ‘ ‘ Are
you a driver or merely a gunner? ”
I would be grateful to you, sir, if
you would settle this question of the
relative merits of gunners and
drivers.—Yours, etc., Baek.
The question is, we think, an
unfair one, and do not approve of
the gunner who pertinently asks,
“ Who is the man behind the gun ? ”
The dictum of so high an autho-
rity as “ Old Blazer,’’ of Feather-
ston, should be accepted as final:
that a gunner can be trained in two
weeks, but it takes two years to
train a driver. —Ed.
THE RABBIT ACT.
To the Editor.
Sir, —I crave space in your
journal to lay before your readers
the most serious and most important
question of the hour. I refer to the
New Zealand Rabbit Act. I shall
deal entirely with that side of this
burning problem which is the con-
cern of the 37th N.Z.F.A. It has
come to the ears of Lords Kelburn
and Hodgson that this “ ragtime
battery ’ ’ had the temerity and
tenacity to j)artake of rabbit a la
Maoriland on a recent evening with-
out first receiving the permission
and condescension of the aforemen-
tioned worthies. My desire is to
point out to you and your sub-
scribers that, while they may cast
reflections upon the “ thirty-
seventh ” individually and collect-
ively, all such innuendoes and
charges are absolutely false, untrue,
spiteful, despicable, and without
foundation.
My purpose, therefore, is to show
your readers that Lords Kelburn
and Hodgson, Duke of Waikato,
were entirely mistaken when they
declared that the rabbit a la Maori-
land was surreptitiously removed
from the pantry of the officers’ mess.
The truth is that Robert a Hunter,
John a Ferrier, Stanley (brother of
the discoverer), Frank a Taylor,
Masefield of “Gallipoli’' fame.
George a Dumper, and Morrison (ad-
viser to the Chinese

BATTERY MEETS TO DISCUSS A MAGAZINE.
A meeting of the 37th Artillery
was called on May 26 to decide
whether a magazine should be pub-
lished by the battery. The meeting
was extremely well attended, and
was most enthusiastic throughout.
Sergt. Knights briefly outlined
the reasons for which he had called
the meeting. He said that the rein-
forcement had been together an
unusually long time, with the
result that all the members of it
knew one another better than is the
case in most reinforcements. It
was felt generally that some sort of
souvenir of the battery would be
welcomed by all, and it seemed that
a magazine composed on the voyage
to England was the most suitable
form that such a souvenir could
Ragtime Sergeant.
take. A resolution favouring the
publication of such a magazine was
then put to the meeting and carried
unanimously.
It was also resolved that the
magazine should be in no way an-
tagonistic to any ship’s magazine
that might be started at a later
date, but that members of the rein-
forcement would do all in their
power to help on any such ship’s
magazine.
The meeting then proceeded to
the election of officers.
Gunner St. Clair was unani-
mously elected editor. The others
elected were:—
Sub-editor, Cpl. Crimp.
Treasurer, Sgt. Barclay.
Secretary, Gunner Maclean.
Publisher, Gunr. P. A. Holmes.
Committee Members: B. S. M.
O’Donoghue, Sergt. W. J. Knights.
Members of the meeting were
then invited to suggest titles for
the magazine. The title that met
with most approval was “The
Ocean Lyre,” and this was adopted.
The meeting then adjourned with
a vote of thanks to the chairman.
NO ESCAPE.
A private of the Medical Corps,
leaning over the rail, smoking the
pipe of peace, was tapped on the
shoulder and questioned hy Captain
; “Hey, you, where is your
life preserver?” The man dashed
into the dormitory (forgetting to re-
move his pipe), grasped his lifebelt,
and was in turn grabbed by one of
the ship’s police: “What’s your
name and number ? ” he said ; “ this
smoking in the dormitory must be
stopped.”

A MIGHTY CHIEFTAIN AND HIS PEOPLE.
“They that have ears: Let them
hear!
They that have eyes: Let them
see ! ’’
And it came to pass in the year
one thousand nine hundred and
seventeen A.D., King George the
Fifth being King of England and
the Earl of Liverpool being
Governor-General of New Zealand
and its dependencies, that a certain
ruler of the people, called William
Massey, the square dealer, com-
monly known as “Plain Bill,”
authorised his first lieutenant, who
was a man of craft and skill and
known as Jimmy Allen, to call
from the highways and byways,
from the North and the South,
from the East and the West, an
army of men to be trained in the
use of arms. And it was so.
A small portion of this army,
collected from divers parts of this
New Zealand, was named the 33rd ;
but as time went on this unit was
reorganised, and was called the 37th
Artillery.
Now, about this time there lived
a certain wise man called Swar-
brick, who earned a scanty living,
pleading and exhorting justice for
the people of the town in which he
lived ; but, hearing that his King
was in need of his services, he
promptly answered the call, and
was duly authorised to hold the
high and honourable position of
officer commanding 37th Artillery ;
and as a good ruler reigns over his
people, so did this wise man use
his physical appearance (for he
was a man of tall stature), com-
bined with his authority and his
everlasting smile, to instil into
those men entrusted to his care a
love for King and country—a know-
ledge of the great machinery of war,
and, above all, a rigid adherence to
that portion of military law called
Discipline, but the men being filled
with the learning of the time, and
being freeborn, this portion of the
law was not liked, and often it was
not obeyed; therefore the wise
ruler saith unto his band of war-
riors : “To them that shall not
listen to my commands, I shall pre-
pare for them fatigues, wdiich will
necessitate the forfeiture of that
most valued by the soldier—leave.
And it came to pass, when the trees
were leafless and the birds sang not,
and the sun appeared not in the
heavens, this mighty chief, after dis-
missing his lieutenants, foregathered
his faithful band, numbering five
score and eight, and sailed away
into the East. And after passing
many waters they came to a gap
between two worlds, and dissension
grew in their ranks. A new ruler,
with his henchmen had arisen and
rode roughshod over this wise chief.
But his judgment never wavered,
he commanded that a window in the
temple of the warriors be broken,
and it was so. When the sun was
high in the heavens, and every man
to his post, the first sight of land
filled the air with joy, for the day
had come when the islanders
would view the greatest works of
man, exceeding even the great towex-
of Babel.
And it came to pass that on the
morning of the day following the
hearts of this band of artillery were
turned to stone, and deep were the
curses thereof. Being envied by this
new ruler in high position on the
ship, he chose this day to settle his
accounts. This fated band was
marched as fatigues into the bowels
of the vessel, where the light of day
penetrated not. Thus the wonder-
ful sight was missed and the wrath
of the new ruler appeased.
And it came to pass that on other
occasions not here mentioned that
he did likewise; but this I have
written that you may believe, and,
believing, that you may be saved
further annoyances by the mention
of this Pharisee.
Days passed, and the good captain
(who was an islander) steered his
ship into a port after a perilous
journey, avoiding disaster by a
hairsbreadth. Now in this port were
gathered together men of all
nations, and the wise ruler again
spoke to the men under his charge:
“ I give you leave, but be wary lest
ye fall into the hands of robbers ;
be pure in mind and body, and im-
bibe not in the wine when it is red,
and this command again I give unto
you : Touch not strong drink, for
if ye do, all my counsels will be as
naught, and the punishment will be
severe if ye come back to me un-
clean.”
The wise ruler found that his com-
mands were unnecessary, that strong
drink in the port was unknown.


I say these things to you to show but as a good, wise, and learned
to you the necessity of having a leader, who, having been through
good leader who will treat you as the fires, has been weighed in the
men, not as those born out of due balance and not found wanting,
time, not as a man treats his dogs— D. A. N.
BUTCHER’S FATIGUE.
You are sleeping peacefully in
your bunk, dreaming blissfully of
a world “ where every prospect
pleases and only man is vile.”
Suddenly you receive a rude
shock, for out of the dim dark comes
the stern command, “ Turn out the
vegetable fatigue! ”
Out you turn. There’s no help
for it. Hastily dressing and pull-
ing on your own boots, or those be-
longing to someone else, you tumble
out to parade.
The B.S.M. is shouting some-
thing; it sounds uncommonly like,
“Hurry up there; you’re always
last!” You do not reply.
By this time someone is whisper-
ing in your ear, “I hear the
butcher’s fatigue is a good stunt.”
“ Go on,” you say, by way of show-
ing your ignorance. Thus encour-
aged, your informer continues:
“ Yes, the last one in the ratnks
usually strikes butcher’s fatigue.
How about giving it a go?”
Cautiously you manoeuvre till you
find yourself in the last four. Then
comes ; “ ’Shun ! Right turn ! Quick
march!” And, mirahile dictu,
your tip proves a winner. In due
course you find yourself “ told off ”
for the butcher’s party. You are
greeted with, “You boys have struck
the best job of the lot.” “You
don’t say,” you innocently reply.
“Who would have thought it?”
Then the flattered butcher resumes :
“ Yes, your work will finish in
about an hour’s time, and you will
then be off duty for the day.”
The butcher is as good as his
word. In due time you are told,
“ That will do.” Reaching for your
tunic, and incidentally palming a
slice of German sausage, you pre-
pare to depart. “Cheer oh,
butcher,” you say, and make for the
deck. There you seat yourself with
a copy of “ Punch ” and indulge in
the fragrance of a mild Havana,
every now and then lifting your
gaze to the beautiful blue of the
Pacific. You think of the other
members of the fatigue party less
fortunate than yourself, who are
probably doing some coal-heaving at
that moment. You picture them
smeared with dirt and dust. You
smile the smile of the “ shrewdy.”

THE KAISER AND THE DEVIL.
The Kaiser called the Devil up
On the telephone one day.
The girl at the Central listened
To what they had to say.
“ Hello ? ” she heard the Kaiser say,
“Is old man Satan home?
Just tell him it is Kaiser Bill
That want’s him on the ’phone.”
The Devil said “ Hello” to Bill,
And Bill said “How are you?
I’m running here a Hell on earth,
So tell me what to do.”
“ What can I do ? ” the Devil said,
“My dear old Kaiser Bill?
If there’s a thing that I can do
To help you, I sure will.”
The Kaiser said “ Now listen,
And I will try to tell
The way that I am running
On earth a modern Hell.
I’ve saved this for many years,
And I’ve started out to kill;
That it will he a modern job
You leave to Kaiser Bill.
My army went thro’ Belgium,
Shot women and children down ;
We blew up all her country
And tore up every town.
My Zepps. dropped bombs on cities,
Killing both old and young ;
And those the Zepplin’s didn’t get
Were taken out and hung.
I started out for Paris,
With the aid of poison gas;
The Belgians, damn them, stopped
us,
And would not let us pass.
My submarines are devils;
Why, you should see them fight,
They go sneaking thro’ the waters,
And will sink a ship on sight.
I was running things to suit me
Till a year or so ago
A man called Woodrow Wilson
Wrote me to go more slow.
He said to me, ‘ Dear William,
We don’t want to make you sore,
So be sure to tell your U-boats
To sink our ships no more.
We have told you for the last time,
So, dear Bill, it’s up to you;
And if you do not stop it,
You’li have to fight us, too.’
I did not listen to him,
And he’s coming after me,
With miles of Yankee soldiers,
From their homes across the sea.
That’s why I called you, Satan,
For I want advice from you,
I know that you can tell me
Just what I ought to do.”
“ My dear old Kaiser William,
There’s not much for me to tell,
For the Yanks will make it hotter
Than I can for you in Hell.
I’ve been a mean old Devil,
But not half as mean as you ;
And the minute that you get here
I will give my job to you.
I’ll be ready for your coming,
And I’ll keep the fires all bright,
And I’ll have your room all ready
When the Yanks begin to fight.
For the boys in blue will get you,
I have nothing more to tell;
So hang up the receiver,
And meet me here in Hell! ’ ’

REMINISCENCES OF NORFOLK.
The majority of us, no doubt,
carry many pleasant recollections of
our short but decidedly interesting
sojourn in the town of Norfolk,
State of Virginia, U.S.A. Every
member of the 37th Reinforcement
can truly testify to the hospitality
of its residents. It is true the dain-
tily-clad females, prim and pretty —
particularly prim—were rather dis-
appointing. Our infantry in their
“shorts” certainly tickled our
American sisters immensely.
The citizens were typical Yanks,
their chief characteristic being an
undeniable and unenviable fondness
for “hyperbolising.” The outstand-
ing industry appeared to be the
noble art of concocting delicious ices,
and ’tis certain one and all dis-
played a remarkable taste for this
commodity. It would be a task,
indeed, to estimate how much “ gut-
rot,” or, in other words, how many
ices per capita were devoured dur-
ing our short period there. I am
afraid their popular beverage,
“iced tea,” was not altogether re-
lished by our troops.
The various excursions by auto-
mobile or jitney to Ocean View,
that delightful seaside resort,
through Ghent, Norfolk’s charming
fenceless residential area, and to the
Army Depot and Naval Base, have
left indelible impressions on our
mind.
One reflects, too, with a smile, the
initiation into the American money
system. Those dollars and dimes
afforded us no small amount of
amusement. The fun derived from
a “ shoeshine ” by a gaping young
nigger, whose jaws certainly had
discovered the secret of perpetual
motion, was considered well worth
an outlay of five cents.
However, enough of the merits
and demerits of the city. I wish to
draw attention to a conversation
which took place between some of
our boys and one of those amiable
and pleasing Americans. From the
following you will gather how little
is known in the United States about
dear old New Zealand.
While walking adong the main
thoroughfare, Granby Street, a
Yank, immaculately attired,
stopped and inquired :
“ Say, what place do you hail
from, stranger?”
“From New Zealand” was, of
course, the prompt reply.
“New Zealand ! And where may
that be? Far from here?”
“ Oh, yes, a fair way.”
“Well, now, about how far?”
“ Something like 7,000 miles.”
“You’re a long way from home,
I guess. But, say, you speak good
English, anyhow.”
“ Sure ; we make a practice of it.”
“Where is your New Zealand
exactly ? Off the coast of Africa,
isn’t it ? ”
“New Zealand! I should say it
is right down south in the Pacific,
about 1,100 miles from Australia.”
“ Are you British troops, then ? ”
“We are. Have you never heard
of the New Zealanders and Aus-
tralians, the Anzacs on Gallipoli ? ”
“Well—no; but I guess you’re
a husky-looking crowd.”
“ Sure.”
“ You chaps that wear spurs are
officers, I guess ?’ ’
No reply. Then, hurriedly :
“Say, is Norfolk a big city?
What’s the population ? ”
“Well, now,” drawling, “just a
year ago it was only about 80,000;
now it has reached just on 250,000.
That’s some going, I guess. What
town are you from ? ”
“ Dunedin. Population 300,000.”
“ Some city, I suppose.”
“ Sure it is. Norfolk’s not in it.”
“No! Say, you can’t judge
America by this place. You know,
stranger, we’re the greatest nation
in the world, but this is the slowest
city in the States. Guess you should
see New Tork. Once you have seen
New York there’s nothing more on
this whole earth to see.”
“No! ”
“ Say, are you chaps coming or
going?”
“ We’re just on our way.”
“ Sure, I thought you hadn’t been
over there. You’re too fresh-look-
ing. Those Huns will take a lot of
beating, I guess, but we are going
to see you through all right. Aren’t
you frightened to go to the war?”
“Frightened! No, we’re used to
it. Gee ! we’ve been fighting all our
lives in New Zealand.”
Yes, we sure had some time in
Norfolk, I guess.

A GUNNER’S DREAM.
A certain gunner who walks and
talks in his sleep was repeating his
drill one night as he lay in his bunk
in the Tropics. The following is
an extract, taken in shorthand, by
one who overheard him :
“For gun-drill, Fall-in. 1.2.3.4.
5.6.7.8.9.10.”
Then he commenced detailing the
positions and duties in gun-drill
and hooking-in.
“ No. 1 doubles himself up on the
point of the pole, serves out flies,
and works for the other numbers
of the detachment. In case of a
miss-fire he crawls down the bore
and carefully extracts the fuse,
taking care that the other numbers
do not follow him.
“ No. 2 doubles up on the near
side of the off side of the
near horse, lets go his quick re-
lease, and passes it through the
front of his back, and makes it fast
to his crownpiece. He then takes
the shovel G. S. and digs himself in.
The Sergeant will do the rest.
“No. 3 takes the top off his acorn
and sees that his piston-rod is in
good working order, places his tele-
scope in the bore, and screws his
dial up till he can see the back of
his head, sets his eyes at zero, which
is below freezing point on his sight
clino and gives No. 1 due warning
when he is going off.
“No. 4 rides on the swingle-tree
of the firing battery wagon, opens
up the wagon with a fuse-key, sup-
plies himself with ammunition from
the horse lines, places two rounds in
the bore, driving them home by
means of the lanyard, and awaits
developments.
“ No. 5 provides himself with a
headstall and spanner 96, catches
the shells as they leave the muzzle,
setting the fuses at safety, replaces
them in the feed-box.
“No. 6 untangles the picquet-
rope, receives a kidney-link from
No. 1, strapping it on his left
breast, unhooks the fuse indicator
from its bracket to find fuse-keys
and safety clips that have been
lost.
“No. 7. His duties are of vital
importance to the gun team as
whole batteries have been blown to
pieces by a simple error of his. He
tests the sight by means of the
hammer-claw, Mark 2. He adjusts
the candle in the night-lamp and
elevates the depression range-finder
till it clears the horizontal plane.
“ Nos. 8,9, and 10. The fitter and
shoeing smith are spare parts, and
are used only when plenty of men
are available. They are sometimes
used instead of ammunition. And
” Then he awoke.
SOME WASH.
Many of the German prisoners
captured in the recent push were in
a shocking state. One man in par-
ticular was in such a filthy condi-
tion that an officer ordered that he
should be given a wash.
“ Vot? Go in der vater? ” cried
the man.
** Yes, take a bath, kamerad ! ”
said a Tommy. “You need it.
How long is it since you had a wash,
anyway ? ”
Consternation and amazement
mingled in his goggle eyes. “ I
never was taken prisoner before,”
he said.
JOKES?
A certain burly recruit was being
attested. On being asked by the
Sergeant-Major the usual question,
“ What religion ? ” the burly one
drew himself 'up proudly and
answered, “ Christian, Sir.”
The Artillery Q.M.S. is easily
the busiest man aboard the trans-
port. He can be seen at all hours
of the day, and sometimes at night,
with a book and pencil in his hand
—and a pack of cards in his pocket.
With great loss of life, many
years were occupied in the construc-
tion of that world’s triumph of engi-
neering skill, the Panama Canal.
It took two weeks for Gunner
Guthrie to do exactly the same work
—in plasticine. No lives were lost.


THE GUILELESS MAORI.
The following incident took
place in a certain King Country
township which was devastated
recently by bush fires. In this
particular township a certain
gentleman who kept a store was
said to have made quite a lot of
money by cheating the Maoris.
There was one Maori, by the
name of Rangi, who was very
fond of onions. He went into the
store and asked the price of them
The storekeeper, a wily Scot, by
the name of Maclean, better
known as “ Big Mac,’ replied
that they were l|d. per pound.
Rangi asked for 10 lbs., and then
inquired the cost. The store-
keeper, aware of the lack of the
Maori’s arithmetical knowledge,
replied, without the quiver of an
eyelash, 4s. 3d. This went on
for a considerable period, not
only with onions, but with other
purchases, until one day a
Pakeha friend told Rangi he was
being cheated, and advised him to
buy a ready-reckoner.
Rangi went to the store —the
only one in the township—and
asked Big Mac for a ready-
reckoner. As this was against his
interests, he immediately replied
that he did not stock them.
Rangi then decided to go to Wan-
ganui for the book, and set out
next day, taking with him his
vahine. Arriving at Wanganui,
he entered a bookseller’s and
said, “ I want te book what tell
you te price te onion.”
This rather puzzled the sales-
man, who could not think of any
book likely to fill the bill: but,
nothing daunted, he proceeded to
go through a long list of horticul-
tural works. Rangi said the book
in question was not among those
mentioned. The salesman then
went along the shelves calling out
the names of various books,
finally coming to a ready-
leckoner.
“ That te book: that te book;
te retty reck’nor,” cried Rangi,
exultantly. “ Py cripe, I tell Pi
Mac he te broomin’ cheat now.
How much ? ”
“ Two shillings,” replied the
salesman, and wrapped it up.
Rangi and his wahine visited
several other places of no interest
to the reader, and then started
back for the King Country, the
total expenses amounting to ,£ll.
Rangi, on his arrival at the town-
ship, hunted up his Paxeha
friend and asked him to find the
price of 10 lbs. oi his favourite
onions at Hd. Then the Maori
made straight for the store, with
his “ retty reck-nor ” in his poc-
ket, confident that he had Mac
“ by the wool,” and the following
ensued: —
Rangi: “ Py corry, this te fine
day.”
Mac: “Yes, it’s a fine day,
Rangi.”
Rangi: “Any good onion?”
Mac: “I have some splendid
onions just fresh in.”
Rangi: “ How much te onion?”
“ Hd. per pound.”
Rangi: “ Give me ten pound.”
The onions having been par-
celled up, Rangi inquired the
total cost, to which Mac replied
4s. 3d.
“Py corry, Mac, you te pig
cheat. Igo to Wanganui an’ py
te book what tell te price of te
onion. He tel la me te 10 lbs. cost
te one an’ tree.”
Mac asked to be shown the
book, which was handed to him.
Turning over the pages, he saw
that it was a ready-reckoner. He
turned to the front page, on
which was printed “ Copyright
1917.”
“ Rangi,” said Mac, “ you’ve
been swindled, vou’ve been
cheated. The book you got is last
year’s; it is no good. You should
have got this year’s.”
Rangi vowed vengeance on the
head of the Wanganui bookseller,
and muttered, ‘ Pv cripe, I break
that proomin’ bookman’s head—
te proomin’ cheat! ”


REVEILLE.
When in my narrow bunk I lie
At 6 a.m., and know that I
Ought really to be up and dressed,
My soul with sadness is oppressed.
I think as ’neath the clothes I stay,
“Good Lord! Here dawns another
day.
Reveille’s gone. I must awake ;
Another forty winks I’ll take.”
At 6.15 I rouse once more;
The S.M.’s shouting at the door;
“Arise and shine; you’re always
last! ”
(That is his usual form of blast.)
My boots and buttons I must shine,
My blankefs, too, must be in line.
I swear, and, pulling up the clothes,
I’m quickly in another doze.
But finally I leave my bed
And pour salt water on my head,
And quickly scrape a soapy face,
And cut, of course, a tender place.
No time have I to make my bunk,
Or clean my gear. I’m in a funk
That I’ll be crimed for being last
And have to chase the C.B. Blast
And all because I would repose
In bed to have another doze.
Alas! that getting up should be
So hard a thing for you and me.

C SECTION’S No. 1.
(In the Ring.)
Our Sergeant Knights is a sport
who Tights
With gloves and smiles galore.
The noble art he has deep at heart
As he spars about the floor.
The hair on his head is thin and
white,
His cheeks are all aglow;
His lightning left, or his dirty
right
Can strike quite a hefty blow.
He counters and ducks and steps
aside,
He hooks and breaks away.
If an opening shows, there’s a rain
of blows
On deck on a summer’s day.
He’s master of blocks and stops,
that’s plain;
His body blows are spry;
The footwork’s great —the punch
full of weight,
And causes many a sigh.
So hooray for Watty—he’s one of
the best,
We’re lucky to have such as he;
And when we part there’s a place
in my heart
For Watty and one-six-three.

APPRECIATION.
The Committee, on behalf of the

have at all times extended to them
during the voyage.

The BRoKENWINDoW:
Just a little broken window,
Broken faithfully and well;
And the O.C. knows the culprit,
But the O.C. must not tell.
Why the cause of his stern

Why not make the culprit pay ?
Perchance the O.C. is a “ Fuze-

And he knows the Fuse-key’s

ON THE VOYAGE.
Overheard by Ship’s Policeman
Ramsay, a portion of a conversa-
tion by two of the infantry on
the after-batch: —
First : “Seein’ as ’ow the time
seems to be all tangled up here,
wot time do Christmas fall on in
England this year, Bill?”
Second: “Let’s see, now,”
scratching his head, “ ’bout
August, I think.”
Officer (to ship’s guard); “Are
you thoroughly conversant with
your duties? ”
Guard (saluting): “ Yes, sir.”
Officer: “What would you do
on the outbreak of fire?”
Guard: “ Try to distinguish it,
sir.”
Officer; -“ Anything else? ”
Guard: “Yes, sir; slip up to
the officer on the bridge and tell
him —just quietly.”
SEEN AND HEARD.
Ship Poet: “This is the only
poem I’ve ever written.”
Editor of “ Lyre ” : “ Don’t be
downcast; no one is going to take
it away from you.”
Officer (to batman): “ Call mt
at five in the morning.”
“ Yes, sir; that’s, very early for
you to rise, sir.”
Officer: “ I don’t want to rise;
I just want to have the pleasure
of rolling over and going to sleep
again.”
Captain Chaplain: “ This is
your third time in clink. Are you
not ashamed to have your mates
see you here?”
Unabashed Prisoner: “Indeed
I am. The place is disgraceful.
The prison smells like a tap-room,
the cells are dark as caves, the
guard are not gentlemen, and the
table is not fit to sit at. Ashamed
to have my mates see me here ?
I am mortified every time I see
them; but what can I do ? ”
Seen in Ship’s Routine Orders,

ment have only two ! ”

Mike: “Oi did.”
Mrs. C.: “Oi don’t believe it.”
Mike: “Well, if yez think

One of the military “heads,”
hearing a corporal saying to his
men during a lecture, “Move fur-
ther along this way, please,” the
head stopped and asked the man
his rating.
“ A corporal, sir.”
“Well, you should know that a

HUTMATES.
Andrew, merry Andrew, his manly smiling phiz
Open as a shirt-front, as his one mostly is;
Loyal, true and careless, with qualities unguessed,
Tho’ in his sleep he talks a heap, I think I loved him best.
Dan, fat Dan the soldier, a pal o’ mine is he,
A fact upon a clothes-line he balances with glee;
Fathoms deep in learning, full as a brewer’s cask—
And anything you wish to know, well, you just simply ask.
There’s Mac and Gall and Dumper, three drivers bold and brave,
Who do their share, with utmost care, with many a narrow shave;
But some day when they’re wanted, X doubt not that you’ll find
My noisy friends the drivers have not been left behind.
And one there is, the Sergeant—ah, lucky boys were we!
He cut us diamonds from the rough and made us as you see;
Ready aye to blast us and damn us in the Bark,
But more ready still to help us or join us in a lark.
From far-off, dear Dunedin, from whence the best men hail,
G6od old Stan comes strolling, blythe as the nightingale;
Always bright and merry, an early riser he—
The best of all good fellows—a tiger for a spree.
There’s Harold, Arch, and Ernie, three pals both good and true,
Who make you take half their cake, and also share their stew;
Good the mates of Featherston—l know there’ll be a roar—
But best and finest of the lot, my mates of 164.
My friend, a sly old joker—old Percy Holmes, to wit—
Dearly loves an argument, who “growls” but does his bit;
1 know I must be careful, in either rhyme or prose.
Whate’er in jest I do or say, he’ll strenuously oppose.
And there's another Sergeant, our lanky roaring George,
Who laps up drill wiith ease and skill, and at us does
And rising meteoric, I further see him soar.
With all the best good wishes from his hut-mates, 164.
Old growly Bill the “ bomber ”—we used to think it fun
When Bill “went off” about our slackness round the gun;
But whether at the table, the stable, or parade.
He always towered above us and left us in the shade.
Then there’s Dick and Arthur, two drivers true and tried,
In matrimony seemed to be safe and surely tied.
But find them an the saddle, you’re safe to bet your head,
The tricks and ways of horses they know from A to Z.
There’s Fitter Ernie Williams, no Fitter fit as he—
The finest, fastest Fitter in the Artillery;
To see him fitted in his bed, you’d think he had a drop;
They say be fitted better in the fitter’s shop.
From sleepy, sunny Nelson, where water-melons grow,
Comes Brother Tommy Louison, who likes to brag and blow
Of peaches big as pumpkins, tells yarns both wade and tall,
But clean right thro’, and easily the whitest of us all.
There’s good old S.S. Winsett, across the straits he bore—
Cruised about among the huts, and berthed at 164;
Shoeing horses is his forte—l guess he’s shod a lot;
Shoes them right day or night, and “ shoos them on the trot.
McCracken and Mcßobie, a careless, precious pair;
One dark as a dago, the other Saxon fair.
In two more worthier artists—and this is Kindly said— >(
You couldn’t find their equal in the art of “ swinging lead.
But living in glass houses, one shouldn’t cast a stone.
For Alf s dark ways are hut a reflection of my own;
And this is writ mysterious, to show poetic play.
For Alt’s as light as midnight, and I’m as dark as day.
McCracken, big and hefty, but full! weight every pound
Just the sort of pal to have when you’re knocking round;
“ Know your mates,” said Colonel Smith, “together you will lie,
Work together, live together, and perhaps together die!
Seven months hard at Featherston, where thousands toed the line,
Through lanes of lurid language, thro’ rain, thro’ shade and shine ;
Blasted, damned at every turn, yet fit as Oxford crews;
Trained on stables, stones and stew, your mortal soul you lose.
So here’s to all New Zealanders that trained at Featherston,
The finest, best and bravest in any land—or none ;
Here’s a tear for those that fell—for those that s gone before—
And here is to my hut-mates, and good old 164.

THE RIDING SCHOOL.
On first entering camp one gets
some very vivid impressions of
what the so-called riding school is
like. Everywhere one turns one
hears the familiar cry, “ Wait
until you get into the riding
school.” After some time has
elapsed the eventful day arrives,
and over to the stables marches a
little squad of men. “Who ar3
these? ” asks a deep, gruff voice.
“ Specialists, sir,” answers the
corporal in charge, in a bold but
much assumed voice. “ A saddle
and bridle each,” roars the
same voice, which is well known
to all, and comes from one
commonly called “ Blazer.”
Then ensues an eager rush
for a saddle and bridle, a
race along the stables for a horse,
each man keen to get his mount
saddled first in what he considers
to be the correct military style.
Judging from the flow of lan-
guage, it is evidently not a, very
easy job. One by one, hot and
excited, the would-be horsemen
file out, and over to the riding
school. Here they line up and
a wait the coming of the notorious
Blazer, who, whip in hand, walks
slowly into the school, casting
sidelong glances over each saddle
and bridle, searching for some
trifling error. This inspection
over, and a few fitting remarks
made about saddling, etc., the
order comes, “ Stand to your
horses.” Every man springs to
attention at the side of his horse.
I hen, “ Without stirrups, pre-
pare to mount,” and finally
“ Mount.” Each of the nervous
riders makes vigorous attempts to
climb into his saddle. The unsuc-
cessful ones provoke some such
encouraging remarks as “ Climb
up ’is legs,” “ Get a step-ladder,”
“ Hold on to his tail ” etc. Thus
inspired, anew attempt is made,
and finally all are firmlv (?)
seated in the saddle. “ Walk
march,” is the next order, and
every horse, knowing the order so
well, at once starts off round the
school. Then comes “ Trot,’’ and,
like machinery, the horses in-
crease their pace, while the
“jockeys” are tossed about like
the proverbial sack of coals.
Comes the command, “ Quit your
stirrups,” and then the circus
commences. Soon many are un-
seated ; others of a sudden grow
very loving, with their arms
about the neck of their mount,
while Blazer encourages them
with the caustic remarks, “ Give
’im ’is ’ead,” “Stick to ’im,” etc.
If one watches closely one will
notice a semblance of a smile
cross the Old Man’s face. Those
unsaddled are up like a shot, and
mount once more, only, however,
to practise “nose dives” once
more, much to the amusement of
the bystanders. Undismayed, the
gallant equestrian once again
mounts, and, clinging for dear
life to the pommel, manages to
retain his seat until the trot is
over. The next order, “ Turn
your horses inwards,” and then
some exercises are attempted.
These over, the order comes
“ File out,” and a very weary and
dejected squad, with wan smiles
on their faces, and pains in un-
mentionable parts, wend their
weary way to the stables. So
ended the first lesson, after a most
strenuous and exciting morning
in the riding school.
’Tis understood that an artillery-
man is entitled to 11b. meat,
bread, 4oz. butter, etc., etc., per
diem. But there is no way of
checking these weights. In the case
of fish, however, the matter is more
satisfactory. Fish is placed on the
mess table accompanied by its own
scales.
A private strolling along the
deck, a cigarette in his mouth. An
officer passed. The infantryman for-
got to march at attention. “What
do you mean by slouching past me
in that fashion?’’ demanded the
irate officer. “Do yon know who I
am? lam Captain G.” The
private accepted his explanation.
