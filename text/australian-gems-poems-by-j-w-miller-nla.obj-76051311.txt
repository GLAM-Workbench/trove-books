AUSTRALIAN GEMS, BY J, W. MILLER
The Squatter?s Daughter;
THE OLD MAN STANDS AT BAY.
Corrindah Mall, the squatter?s home,
That night was bright and gay ;
Harry returned from distant lands,
To his father?s house that day,
And brought with him, as bosom friend,
A lord of high degree,
Who boasted of his Norman blood,
And ancient chivalry.
Proud of his race, delighted to trace
His line from the Conqueror down,
How in the field they never yet failed
Achieving a high renown.
All maidens shy should droop the eye,
And blush when he drew near;
For none in the land he thought could stand
The glance of a Yere de Vere.
In Cori?indah Hall, the squatter?s home,
Was gathered a brilliant crowd
To welcome Harry to his father?s house,
And also his friend Lord Claud.
Lord Claud looked round with his eye-glass,
And thus to himself haw-haw?d :
? What a treat for this vulgar mass
To look on a noble lord.?
The squatter?s daughter, Maud, was there?
A maiden frank and free?
Both tall and dark, with raven hair,
And aged just twenty-three.
No jeweU?d gems this maiden wore
To deck her person fair,
A crimson bloom of waratah,
Shown ?mid her glossy hair.


As she walked through her father?s hall,
Where all was bright and gay,
She had for all a winning smile,
And pleasant word to say ;
But when she met the haughty lord,
She still more haughty grew,
Like lightning from her clear dark eyes
The scornful flashes flew.
With one finger of her neat gloved hand
She touched his outstretched palm.
Her cold reception of his friend
Filled Harry with alarm.
? Will my fond dreams in coldness end ?
I loved him as a brother !
And thought my sister and my friend,
Were made but for each other ! ?
The dance and song went gaily on,
Then came the wonderous tales ;
How Claud de Vere shot grouse and deer
Beside the Prince of Wales.
The stately homes of England,
Her oaks and elms rare,
Her line of noble warriors,
And maidens good and fair.
Not like your stale Australian maids,
That wither in their teens,
But fresh and fair to a ripe age,
A galaxy of Queens,
Her ancient towers, her battle-fields,
Her ever-flowing streams,
Meandering through her meadows bright,
And beautiful as dreams.
But there?s no beauty in your land,
?Tis dry and tame to me ;
Black wattle ?faugh ! I cannot stand,
Nor yet your blue gum tree.
Your flowers ai?e all scentless,
Your rivers are but pools,
And Britons you all call ? new chums?
And, no doubt, take for fools.
And as for game, What have you got 1
There?s nothing here, I see,
But a pelican or wombat,
Or a scrub wallaby.


Then out spoke Maud, and thus did say :
? I see you?re not so slow?
If we Australians spoke like that
You all would call it ?blow.?
Your maiden?s may keep fresh and fair?
A hundred years or so?
Hut here we learn to live and work,
Not vegitate and grow !
There?s one strange thing I can?t make out
Nor ever understand,
Why you should leave that Paradise,
For this dull thirsty land.
If game you want, there?s plenty here,
With lyre birds and curlews,
There?s cockatoos and paraquets,
?Possums and kangaroos.
Now there?s the old man kangaroo,
That-haunts the river bend,
Full many a fierce hound he slew,
His own rights to defend.?
Haw-haw-haw, then laughed Lord Claud :
?Indeed it would be fine
To see at such ignoble sport
One of our ancient line.
It must be tame jack-rabbit sport
This hunting kangaroos,
It might be sport for hoiden maids,
Or jingling Jackaroos.
To one who in the east and west,
Rode down the fiery steed,
To put it at its level best,
It must be tame indeed.
I?ve tracked the tiger to his lair,
And slew the lion in his path;
I?ve grappled with the grizzly bear,
And braved the wild man in his wrath.
And elephants I too have slain
In many a tangled brake ;
I?ve brushed the cobra from my path,
And crushed the rattle-snake.
The scaly monsters of the deep
All learned to dread my gun ;
When on the prow I take my stand
Our pathway they all shun.


The alligator fell beneath
My rifle?s deadly aim ;
What sport could I expect to find
With your poor furry game.
? 0 ! What a Hector !? Maud then cried,
? If you came here to slay,
There?s danger hunting kangaroos
When the old man stands at bay.?
Next morn all mounted for the chase,
To hunt the kangaroo ;
Maud, riding in the pride of place,
O?er logs and fences flew.
Lord Claud, he was not far behind ;
His horse with powerful spring,
Was bearing him right to the front,
When Maud began to sing ;
? I?ll take Lord Claudie under my wing,
And see him safely through ;
I?ll hide him in a hollow tree
From the old man kangaroo.?
Lord Claud, he could not bear such chaff;
To treat her with disdain
He turned away off to the right,
And left the hunting train.
He swore an oath unto to himself,
An oath both deep and strong,
That with the Australian hoiden maids,
He would not linger long.
Two hounds had followed him thus far,
For well they knew the steed
As one that would be always in,
Or very near the lead.
Tally-ho! tally-ho! off they go,
They have the game in view,
Lord Claud looked through the bush and
The old man kangaroo.
The old man skipped along at ease,
And scarcely touched the ground,
As down a gentle slope he went,
Ten yards at every bound.
The old man still sailed gaily on,
And did not seem to mind;
The dogs were yelping at his tail,
And pressing close behind.


Lord Claud, to keep the game in view,
Rode furious and fast;
He found it was no fox-hunt pace;
But one that could not last.
The old man led them to the creek,
Down by a deep black pool,
He placed his back against a tree
And stood there firm and cool.
The dogs rushed in to seize his throat,
He squeezed them out of breath :
And ripping them from stem to stern,
He laid them stiff in death.
And now Lord Claud came riding up,
With many leaps and bounds,
But back he shrunk, almost aghast,
To see his mangled hounds.
He did not know which way to turn,
Nor the best game to play;
When at that moment Maud rode up
Upon her dapple-grey.
? What, ho ! my lord, can this be so,
Art paralyzed with fear ;
Where is the boasted Norman blood,
Of the noble Vere de Vere ?
This is no lion in the path,
That you so easily slew,
But a jack-rabbit stands at bay?
The old man kangaroo !?
To woman now the pride of place
The noble lord must yield,
The braggart in the hall becomes,
The craven in the field.
? Make way, make way, Lord Vere de Vere
Turn back your gallant steed,
When terror strikes the British peer,
Australian maids may lead.?
Her scornful words pierced to the quick?
His pride was deeply stung;
Scarce knowing what he said or did,
Off from his horse he sprung.
Whilst one hand grasped his hunting crop,
A hunting knife he drew,
And with an oath rushed madly on
The old man kangaroo.


The old man met him on the way,
With one tremendous bound,
And like a falling avalanche,
He crushed him to the ground.
Then snatching him from off" the ground,
With one terrific spring
Leaped far into the stagnant pool
And made the waters ring.
? O God !? cried Maud, ? what have I done
I drove him to his fate?
Now I must to his rescue run
Before it is too late.?
She urged her horse with whip and spur,
There was no time to think,
But rushing on at i-acing speed
Leaped from the dark pool?s brink.
With heavy-mounted hunting crop,
One well directed blow
Released Lord Claud from his death grip,
And laid the old man low.
Then swimming to the slippery bank,
She dragged him through the slime;
And precious were those moments that
Rushed down the track of time.
She pressed her hand upon his breast,
His crushed and mangled frame,
And soon found there a faint low pulse
That slowly went and came.
Alas ! How could she call for aid,
No bugle horn had she,
She put three fingers in her mouth
And whistled piercingly.
And through the forest glades it rang,
In echoes loud and shrill,
And soon an answering whistle?s heard,
Come from a distant hill.
She loosed his collar and his vest,
As he lay on the ground,
And when he drew a lengthening breath
Some consolation found.
Dingoes aroud began to prowl,
The tiger-snake close hissed,
She wiped the froth from mouth and eyes,
And his pale lips she kissed.


And when the crowd came rushing down,
They found the maiden fair,
With Lord Claud?s head laid in her lap,
Her hands twined in his hair.
They bore them to Corrindah Hall,
The humbled lord, and maid,
And from that hour you may be sure
They?d never more upbraid.
And need I tell, with tender care
She nursed him back to life,
And in one short revolving year
Became his loving wife.
And now she rules in lordly halls,
A coronet on her brow,
And statesmen, bards and warriors,
In homage lowly bow.
Tho? oft regaled sweet perfume,
And'decked witli diamond star,
She can?t forget the wattle?s bloom,
Nor glorious waratah ?
Co, ask her what?s her dearest wish
Since she began to roam ?
She?ll answer, ? Tis to see again
My bright Australian home ;
I?d tread Corrindah Vale once more,
Its forests glades alone,
And hear the jackass laugh at morn,
The magpies' evening song.
I?d wander where the satin bird
Still builds his mate a bower,
And pluck from highest mountain peaks
The everlasting flower,
I?d see the fern tree stems shoot up
Out of some rocky glen,
By streams where platypuses sport,
Safe from the eyes of men.
Where sassafras and currajong,
With musk tree in the shade,
And tender ferns of maiden hair,
Still deck the forest glade.
Ah yes ! I?d give this rich boudoir,
And all herein you see,
To romp once more, as in days of yore,
In the hollow red gum tree.?


The March of the Ironclads;
THE SINKING OF H.M.S. VICTORIA ,
On the 23 rd June, 1893, when the lives of Admiral Tryon and 379
of his Crew were lost .
Trafalgar ! 0 Trafalgar ! Where hast thy glory flown?
Our ships now spurn the master?s hand and make a course their
own !
Our ships that once were hearts of oak, have changed to ribs of
steel;
Yet still our gallant British tars their sense of duty feel.
Those leviathans of the deep, that through the billows glide,
O?erawe the nations of the east, with Britain?s naval pride.
Brave Admiral Tryon led his fleet as on the bridge he stood,
Far past the seven mystic mouths, where Nilus pours his flood.
Along the coast of Palestine majestically they sail,
By Carmel, where Elijah slew the prophets of false Baal,
By stubborn Acre, where they count the bones of millions slain,
For nations of the east and west strove hard that port to gain ;
For there the Crescent and the Cross waved o?er the field of death,
The Paynim and Crusader there in deadly conflict met.
Onward still, by ancient Tyre, that mistress of the wave,
Whence fathers of old Commerce the distant seas did brave.
On they sweep o?er the turquoise wave?Sidon is left behind
Those northern monsters of the deep need neither oars nor wind,
By Syria?s classic shore they move so stately and so free \
Then who would dare express a doubt, That Briton?s rule the sea !
Cedars of mighty Lebanon, a nodding welcome wave,
To greet those lions of the north, the bravest of the brave !
The key of eastern commerce now Beyrout itself is past,
And off fair Tripolis?s Bay they form in line at last.
O Tripolis ! O Tripolis ! out of thy gardens fair,
Hast e?er beheld a sight like this, so grand, so proud, so rare,
See floating on your ambient tide, those massive blocks of steel \
The power which drives them from within could make your
mountains reel,
For here you see the power and might of Britain on the main,
Tho? this is but the vanguard of her valiant martial train.


And now, the ? gridiron ? to form, they?re swinging into line :
See see now how they smoke and spout, see how their turrets
shine,
See how they eye each other now, those monsters of the deep.
Two take the bit in their own teeth and on destruction leap.
O ! powerless is the master?s hand to guide these monsters when
They feel that their commission is destruction to all men.
See?see two monsters leave the line, like lions in the tight,
They rush upon each other now with all their power and might.
? When Greek meets Greek,? I hear them say, ? Then comes the
tug-of-war.?
When Ironclad meets Ironclad, more dreadful is the jar !
From the Victoria's proud mast the Admiral?s pennant flew.
And from the bridge, with glass in hand, his fleet he did review.
Manoeuvring his ship about, to gain some fresh renown,
Like a mad bull at a red flag rushed on the Campcrdown ,
And struck Victoria on the beam a most territic blow.
Victoria to the bottom sinks, full eighty fathoms low.
Upon the bridge the Admiral stood?lie felt that all was lost.
?Though round him surged the foamy flood he would not quit his
post,
? Close the bulk-heads ! ? the Admiral roared. The starboard
watch obey.
Alas, too late ! The sea poured in, nought could resist its sway.
In \ ain they called the Admiral to leave the sinking ship.
? Save?save yourselves, my boys,? he cried, ? but this is my last
trip.
This is the home I must defend; my country placed me here ;
My duty tis to see the end, tho? it may be my bier !?
Her prow went down, and many drown beneath the raging flood ;
Her boats are smashed, and corpses gashed, the sea grew red
with blood ;
Her double-screw like lightning flew, when released from the
strain,
Turned tui tie and plunged head-long down to pave the gloomy
main,
When sank the gallant Admiral with his ill-fated barque,
Ihiee bundled British braves went down to Ijped the hungry
shark.
And sharks came out with gory snout, and hovered round the
wreck
Till nought was seen from stem to stern, from keel to upper-deck,
But heart?s blood of the true and brave,
That crimsoned o?er the tourquois wave.
No boreas from the icy north, nor white squall flecked the sky,


Calm as the smile of an eastern bride, the waves laughed dancing
bye,
0 ! Mediterranean waves may laugh, and wreath her shore with
smiles,
But waves of grief, with thundering dirge, break on the British
Isles.
Thence wafted over sea and land, where e?er her flag may wave,
Two hemispheres now mourn with thee, the loss of Briton s brave.
From British Queen to sailor?s lass,
The cup of grief around must pass,
And dim the eye of beauty.
One consolation we have still,
That every man with right good will
Hath nobly done his duty.
The Mornington Disaster;
THE WRECK OF THE PROCESS ,
By -which fifteen Footballers lost their lives .
?Twas on the twenty-first of May
The Process put to sea.
Her prow threw back the foamy spray
Which sparkled on her lea.
She lightly danced upon the wave,
Beneath the noon-day sun?
For freight she bore the strong and brave ?
The pride of Mornington.
She glided gently o?er the tide ;
The sun was bright and warm ;
Her mariner, both true and tried,
Had weather?d many a storm.
They went to battle for their side
Upon the football field,
They struggled hard but only tied,
For neither side would yield.


The time had come to cease their play,
They bid their friends adieu,
And down the pier they took their way
To cross the waters blue.
The sun sunk calmly to its rest,
And cast his latest ray
Across the gently swelling breast
Of sweet Port Phillip Bay.
Sweet peace stole over sea and land,
Hushed was the ocean?s roar,
The wavelets kissed the pebbly strand
Of Mordialloc?s shore.
And when at length their sails were bent
They gave one hearty cheer,
And many a farewell shout was sent
From Mordialloc Pier.
Their sails, swelled by the gentle breeze,
Which, bellied by the wind,
Soon wafted them across the seas,
And left the pier behind.
The belt of Orion gleamed afar,
The Southern Cross above ;
Venus shone out?Queen evening star
Of beauty and of love.
The boat flew on her sparkling way
With song and laugh and cheer,
For every heart was light and gay,
None felt a doubt or fear.
But, ah ! that song, that fatal song,
Rang out from stem to stern;
All joined the chorus loud and strong :
? The ship that won?t return.?
Azeral flaps his sable wing,
Angels of death draw near,
Alas ! ?tis their own dirge they sing?
Their boat becomes their bier, ?
A squall sprang out of the deep?ning gloom
And rushed o?er the tranquil sea,
And hurled them swift as the crash of doom
To a dark eternity.
Lights gleamed out from the casements high
Fond hearts at home still wait;
But the resistless wave swept by
And sealed the swimmer?s fate.


The Pelican Rock looked calmly on,
Till the work of death was done ;
Of that brave crew there?s left not one,
To greet the rising sun.
The ruthless sea hath claimed her dower,
Engulfed both sire and son ;
Left weeping many a wilted flower,
On the braes of Mornington.
A broken mast, a tattered sail,
Shows how the deed was done,
They?re all that?s left to tell the tale
To bereaved Mornington.
How vain alas ! your holy prayer,
Sad watchers by the sea.
Each hearth has got its vacant chair,
The Manse has gotten three.
Hark ! hark ! that cry of wild despair
That?s wafted o?er the sea,
The orphan?s tear, the widow?s prayer,
The young wife?s agony.
The grey-haired father mourns a son,
Of all he loved most dear ;
The mother prays God?s will be done,
And checks the falling tear,
And many a tearful eye will seek
For tidings on the shore ;
And roses fade on the maiden?s cheek
For loved ones now no more.
They?ll be mourning yet in Mornington
Many a weary year,
For the brave young lives whose sands were run
By Mordialloc Pier.
The Pelican Rock broods o?er the tide
And heeds not their distress,
But the hand of God alone can guide
Their soul to happiness.

Australia.
(Written for foundation Day , in Commemoration of the Landing
of Captain Cook)
Framed in a world of waters beyond the Indian seas ;
Beyond the fertile shore that?s fanned by Java?s spicy breeze,
Lay the maiden, fair Australia, still wrapped in slumbers deep,
And the red-gum eucalyptus o?er silent streams still weep.
Tho? the broad Pacific waters still lave her tranquil shore,
And the great Indian Ocean her bays and bights explore ;
Still, still, she sleeps her tranquil sleep, tho? old Time his cycles roll,
And the restless pulse of energy may throb from pole to pole.
When earth was young and beautiful, waved the magician?s wand,
Australia sank to sweet repose far from each troubled land.
Sleep on, sleep on, my fairest maid, and wake not to the world
Until the slaves and tyrants are back to perdition hurl?d,
Until a nation shall rise to rule the free and brave,
Whose Hag shall never float above the fetters of a slave.
And still she slept in blissful rest, secure from every ill,
Till roused by Britain from her sleep her destiny to fill.
The Awakening (1788).
Now Britannia?s voice is calling across the troubled main,
Awake ! awake ! my daughter fair, and slumber not again.
The enchanter?s spell is broken, our ships now rule the sea,
Our flag is proudly floating in the vanguard of the free.
Our gallant Cook is sailing o?er the billows of the deep
To awake your love by valleys from centuries of sleep.
Now, swiftly he?s approaching your long, long silent shore,
In his wake the tide of commerce and wealth shall quickly pour.
Thus sailed the bold Endeavour , a brave ship and gallant crew,
And soon they had fair Australia?that lovely land?in view,
That thro? centuries of darkness was wrapt in hazy gloom,
Till the down-trodden millions of the old lands cried for room.
Then Aurora?s rosy fingers, with the first flush of light,
Plucked the glittering star gems from the ebon brows of night,
And Phoebus rose exultingly to rule o?er sea and land,
And with bright lips so gallantly he kissed her golden strand.
Thus ?woke the blushing maiden from her long, long night?s repose,
And the veil was rent asunder, her beauties to disclose.
So came the gallant strangers in the noon of summer?s day,
Where first they landed on her shores they called it Botany Bay.
Australia rose to welcome them from the far British Isles,
And they forgot all troubles there when basking in her smiles.


The musk tree and wattle, with the glorious waratah,
Waved a welcome to the strangers who came o?er seas so far ;
And the stately eucalyptus which stood so grandly proud
Now skyward flings his branches high to sweep the passing cloud.
Then said the stranger?s chieftain, We will pull our boat ashore,
This fair land we?ll claim and conquer, and shed no human gore.
But up sprang a sable Hector, who, brandishing a spear,
Warned the bold invaders for some other land to steer.
Then up rose the white man?s chieftain, and fired the deadly gun .
Those imps of darkness must give place to children of the sun!
He hoisted then the British flag and Royal btandard there,
And claimed the mountains and the plains, the hills and valleys fair.
He claimed the sovereign right to rule o?er field, o?er flood, and fire
Australia was united thus to Britain?s broad Empire.

The Death of Gordon.
Weep, Britons, weep, and hang your heads for very shame,
Gordon is dead !?struck down in the ? blaze of his fame.?
Not fighting proudly in the van,
Returning blow for blow ;
By the assassin?s bloody knife
Our hero is laid low.
Weep, England, weep, and rend your hair,
Place ashes on your brow,
For oh ! how keenly must you feel
Disgraced and humbled now.
Thy vile procrastination
Whetted the assassin?s knife,
Thy vacillating treachery
Has cost us Gordon?s life.
Oh, England ! thus thy banner proud
Is draggled through the mire ;
Thy vaunted statesmen who hold sway
Have quenched thy patriot fire,
And kept thy honoured flag so closely furled
As called down the odium of the world.


Weep, Erin, weep more sadly still,
A noble soul hath fled,
So let thy harp with mournful song
Give honour to the dead.
And thou, oh, Scotia ! weep and wail
Thy son, so nobly brave,
Who in the Soudan?s thirsty land
Didst free the abject slave.
And thou, Australia, distant though
Thy hills and valleys be,
There is no heart but feels a throe
Of shame and agony,
That Britain could basely desert
The good, the wise, the brave,
Who battled long through want and woe
Her honour thus to save.
Oh, Gordon ! what a fate was thine,
Struggling with that bloody host;
And when thou thought that all was saved
To find that all was lost.
Was it thy fate by heaven decreed,
Or was it man?s neglect,
That caused the rulers of our land
Thy counsel to reject 1
And scorn thy prayer for instant aid
They could so easily give,
And save their country from shame,
And bid brave Gordon live.
What curse hath palsied thus the arm
Of Britain in her might,
That thou wert left to meet thy doom
In such unequal fight ?
The craven fear of doinï¿½ risdrt,
O o '
Lest it might turn out wrong?
A failing we would ne?er expect
To British hearts belong.
The aid at last they send, along
The slimy Nile slow crawls,
Instead of through the desert dash
To thy beleagured walls.
Lo ! by the classic Nile he stands,
Keeping the hordes at bay,
Still waiting for the promised aid
That slowly came that way.


Week after week went by, till month on month rolled
And yet the fiery fight seemed neither lost nor won.
Then rose the hope in every breast
That Wolseley yet might save ?
The gallant Gordon battling on,
The bravest of the brave.
Alas ! too late the mystic Nile?s
Blue and white waters meet,
And there he found a bloody grave
Who never yet knew defeat.
There is no grave more hallowed now
In all that classic land,
Tho? mighty pyramids may still
O?er ancient mummies stand.
Sad feelings for that fatal deed
Our memories green shall keep ;
The very Sphinx by ruined Thebes
O?er his sad fate may weep.
Oh ! flower of modern chivarly,
Beleagured in Khartoum,
O?er evei?y land in Christendom
Thy fate has cast a gloom.
For thou stood forth a beacon bright,
That all the world might see,
That in one heart there still survived
The purest chivalry.
For thou didst win immortal fame,
Not by the sword alone ;
In deeds of Christian charity
More brightly hast thou shone.
Thus, Gordon, may thy memory live,
Undimmed by time and rust,
When all Egyptian pyramids
Are crumbled into dust.
