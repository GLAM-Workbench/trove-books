HYMN —**I love to hear the Story”
I love to hear the story which angel
voices tell—
I’m glad my blessed Saviour was once
a child like me,
How once the King of Glory came down
on earth to dwell;
To show how pure and holy His little
ones might be:
I am both weak and sinful, but this I
surely know—
And if I try to follow His footsteps here
below.
The Lord came down to save me,
because He loved me so!
He never will forget me, because He
loves me so!
To sing His love and mercy, my
sweetest songs I’ll raise;
And though I cannot see Him, I
know He hears ray praise;
For He has kindly promised that I shall
surely go
To sing among His angels, because He
loves me so!

HYMN- —“Jesus loves me”
Jesus loves me. this I know,
For the Bible tells me so;
Little ones to Him belong;
They are weak, but He is strong.
Yes, Jesus loves me! Yes, Jesus loves
me!
Yes, Jesus loves me! The Bible tells me
so!
Jesus loves me! He who died
Heaven’s gate to open wide:
He will wash away my sin,
Let His little child come in.
Jesus loves me! Fie will stay
Ciose beside me all the way:
If I love Him, when I die
He will take me home on high.

ADDRESS ' Rev. J. H. DABB, 8.A., B.D
HYMN—“The fields are all white**
The fields are all white,
And the reapers are few;
We children are willing,
But what can we do
To work for Our Lord in His harvest?
Our hands are so small,
And our words are so weak,
We cannot teach others;
How, then, shall we seek
To work for Our Lord in His harvest?
We’ll work by our prayers,
By the offerings we bring,
By small self-denials;
The least little thing
May work for Our Lord in His harvest
Until, by and by,
As the years pass, at length
We, too, may be reapers.
And go forth in strength
To work for Our Lord in His harvest.
