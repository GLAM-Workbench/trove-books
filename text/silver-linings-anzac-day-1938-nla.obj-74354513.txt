An Appreciation.
TV TORE than any two other men Cec. Hartt and
Frank Dunne perpetuated the Digger tradition.
Mostly they did it with laughter, but proud tears
were shed over many a sketch of theirs. The
Digger they gave us was the one we were
or would like to have been.
They were more than good soldiers and white
men, this pair of fellow-artists. They were historians.
The history they wrote with brush and crayon is,
after Charlie Bean?s magnificent work in words, the
finest and truest monument to the Digger.
Cec and Frank have gone on to join the only
army that never grows smaller
But they have left us a key to memory that will
always, everywhere, open the book of Over There.
The Black and White work in ?Silver Linings?
will, we hope, be one of the keys to their memory.


THE AUSTRALIAN.
(A British Officer?s Opinion)
The skies that arched his land were blue,
His bush-horn winds were warm and sweet,
And yet from earliest hours he knew
The tides of victory and defeat;
From fierce floods thundering at his birth,
From red drought ra/vening while he played,
He learned to fear no foes on earth?
? The bravest thing God ever made ! ?
The bugles of the Motherland
Rang ceaselessly across the sea
To call him and his lean brown band
To shape Imperial destiny;
He went, by youth grave purpose witted,
The goal unknown, the cost unweighed,
The promise of his blood fulfilled ?
?The bravest thing God ever made ! ?
We know?it is our deathless pride! ?
The splendour of his first fierce blow;
How, reckless, glorious, undenied,
He stormed those steel-lined cliffs ?we know!
And none who saw him scale the height
Behind his reeking bayonet blade
Would rob him of his title-right?
? The bravest thing God ever made ! ?
Bravest, where half a world of men,
Are brave beyond all earths rewards,
So stoutly none shall charge again
Till the last treating of the swords;
Wounded or hale, won home from war,
Or yonder by the Lone Pine laid,
Give him his due for evermore?
? The bravest thing God ever made ! ?

THE ANZAC DAWN SERVICE.
The Anzac Dawn Service held at 4.30 a.m. each Anzac Day at the
Cenotaph in Martin Place, was originated in 1927 by the Australian Legion
of Ex-Service Clubs of N.S.W. The first occasion brought only a handful of
Diggers and a very simple service was conducted. It was brought into being
by The Legion for two principal reasons. Firstly to commemorate the actual
landing, for it was on April 25th, 1915, at 4.30 a.m., that the Australians
landed on Gallipoli and secondly, to enable the Citizens of Sydney to gather
and offer their tribute to the memory of those who landed and all who followed
them in the way of sacrifice during the Great War.
That the Public have appreciated the Service in the early hours of the
Anzac morn is borne out by the thousands that now attend each year. Last
year over 30,000 were present and it is expected that this year will see still
more.
One very beautiful and symbolical picture arises from the Service when
thousands of ex-service men without the accompaniment of bands move down
Martin Place. The only sound that is heard is that of marching feet, growing
louder and louder as the cavalcade approaches the Cenotaph. The Great
Canyon of Martin Place seems a vast open air cathedral. It is in fact as if
the vast army of those who have passed beyond are once more shoulder to
shoulder in sympathy and spirit with those who yet remain.
Thousands throughout the world will listen in to this ceremony and derive
inspiration from it. The Service is dedicated and expressed in the simple
but beautiful words as penned by His Excellency The Governor.
?At this hour, upon this day, Anzac received its baptism of fire and
became one of the immortal names in history. We who are gathered here
think of the Comrades who went out with us to the battlefields of the Great
War but did not return. We feel them still near us in the spirit. We wish
to be worthy of their sacrifice. Let us therefore once more dedicate ourselves
to the service of the ideals for which they died. As the dawn is even now
about to pierce the night so let their memory inspire us to work for the
coming of the new light into the dark places of the world.
?J. H. CASK.


Through the Dark Clouds Shining
Anzac Day ! What does it mean? In every State
of the Commonwealth there is diversity of opinion
as to its observance. There was no diversity in Aus-
tralia?s forces abroad.
There is not a Digger who does not appreciate
the solemnity of the Day. Anzac Day has not yet
been desecrated. It can be safely left to the sailor,
the soldier, and the airman who, having come
through carnage, should know to realise the com-
memorative significance of an historic date in our
national history. Their fallen comrades would be the
first to trust them to honor Anzac Day.
They would be the first to say ?Capture for ever
the Digger spirit. Treasure it. When the sacred rites
have been paid when the Last Post has sounded
?we will be with you.?
There is not one of them but would carry on the
grand refrain ?Turn the Dark Clouds Inside out . . .
Make this a day of national celebration . . . This is
our Day ... A day of re-union when we will be
remembered ... In spirit we will be with you again
in all your songs ... For us ?the clouds have rolled
by? . . . You must rejoice, for we, like you, helped
to build a nation.?
That was the keynote of the reply to a deputa-
tion in 1936 when Hugh Main (then N.S.W. Min-
ister for Agriculture) said, on behalf of the Govern-
ment, ?It is a day, we think, that must be kept up
in the form of rejoicing at the entry of Australia
into nationhood.?
If ?Silver Linings? helps in the retention of the
spirit which the Diggers themselves know will never
be lost, it will have served its purpose.

ANGELS OF WAR.
Today as we all sit together'
And drink toasts to cobbers ?gone west?
We?re inclined to forget
Those ?Angels of War ?
Who bravely stood up to the test.
When we talk of war horrors
Of gallant deeds done,
As we sit with our sweethearts or wives,
We?re inclined to forget
Those ?Angels of War ?
Who mended our war-broken lives.
With your wounds ?givin ? hell?
As you got to the base ,
Were you captain, cook, or ?the dag,?
Your plea , it was heard
an ?Angel of War?
As you muttered ?Fer Gawd?s sake, a fag ! ?
Today they are scattered ?
God only knows where;
Some of them still carry on.
But we shall remember
Those ?Angels of War ?
Those heroes of days that are gone.
So Diggers! Fill up your glasses
When this Anzac Day March is o?er
And drink this toast that I give you ?
To the Nurses , those ?Angels of War.?

DEFINITIONS.
Sometimes when alone
I sit and think
Of different things that are said
And the many meanings
f words that one hears
And it brings an idea into my -head.
So I?ve worked out a few definitions
I hope that you will agree
That these little words that I give
you
Mean as much to you as to me.
The first one I think of is ?Mother.?
A word that is dear to us all.
The first when we pray
And the last one we say
When our Maker makes His last call.
She's someone who has made us
Just what we should be;
Who tended our every need
And watched us grow to man?s estate
And taught us every deed.
And if by chance that training should
fail,
She?s the one that we look for, no
other.
She's ?just something apart from the
rest of the world,?
That's my definition of ? Mother.?
The next one I think of is ?Digger,?
A word that is often applied
To the men that made us a nation;
Men that fought for us and died.
They answered their country when
she called,
On Gallipoli, France and elsewhere;
They were promised the world when
they came back,
By those who were not there.
You can see them today by the dozen
Poor devils without even a bob.
They don?t want the world they were
promised;
They?d be satisfied with a job.
They?ve been badly let down by their
country;
And they?re fighting like hell to live,
And believe me, Friend, that is a sin
That not even God will forgive.
That these promises made were
broken
By these flagwaggers suave and
staid;
Doesn?t alter the fact that the Digger
Is the bravest thing God ever made.
I hope that you are no getting weary
But before I come to the end
I?ll give you the word that has
troubled me most,
And that is the word called ?Friend,?
I?ve tried for a definition
But no real one comes to my mind;
So I?ll give you one that was given
to me
And I hope that old Tom won?t mind.
Old Tom was my Lieutenant
A man we learned to adore;
He carried me in when wounded
And laid me down on the dugout
floor.
He was a man among men, was old
Tommy;
His dress was always neat.
I met him last week outside 2UE
Just a low-down bum in the street.
I took him along and we had a feed
I thought his hunger would never
end;
At last he sighed and said ?Gee, but
it?s good
To see you, Harry, my friend.
What I might have been and wasn?t
Won?t matter very much in the end;
But it?s bonser to see one of the boys
again,
And it had to be you, my friend!?
I said, ?Tell me,
Tom, what does
that word mean??
He said, ?Tell you,
why, I?ll even
shout
A friend is someone
who walks in the
door,
When the rest of
the world walks
out ! ?

WE?RE MILLIONAIRES TODAY
There is a wealth of silver, of copper, steel and gold,
A wealth of land for tillage but these alone are cold.
And man may own such treasures, ten times beyond his need
But Inching other riches he?ll still be poor indeed.
For there?s the wealth of spirit; the wealth of heart and mind;
The wealth of great good nature exalting all mankind.
And who seeks only treasures his grasping hands can clutch
To fill his purse and pocket must rob himself of much.
Oh, there?s the wealth of beauty, of field and stream and sky.
Of hours that bring no profit save charm to ear and eye;
In friends and love and laughter, we?re rich in every way
So fill your glass and drink to them we?re millionaires to-day !

We were out for a spell, and from our billets could
see the light railway crawling along laden with whizz-
bangs and Anzac wafers on its way to the Big Works.
Bluey, engaged in rubbing the knees of his strides with
a brick (he hoped to get a new pair from the Q.M. that
way), paused to remark : ?Blime, that thing always
reminds me of the Queensland railways.? There was
a frigid silence, and Bluey continued : ? ?Spose youse

are mentioned in the Bible ? ? No one ?bit.? Bluey
ruminated, ?Yairs, it?s dinkum, alright. Look up the

(Tune : ?When I Wore a Tulip, and You Wore a Rose?)
I met him in a dug-out in an old Belgian town.
His putties they were gone, his socks were hanging down,
He had lost his Webb equipment and his old Ross rifle, too;
He looked quite glum and blue as he turned and said :
I once had a tunic, a bright khaki tunic,
A present from Sir Sam Hughes,
How well I did bless it, how often I?ve cursed it
Many times while in the blues.
Old Sam made me cheery, old Fritz made me dreary,
With his whizz-bangs and shrapnel, too;
How I wish it was over and I was in Dover instead of in old Ypres
Way Down
Just try and picture me,
In Aussie o?er the sea,
That?s where I?d like to be.
All I can think of to-night
Are the fields of snowy white,
Freezing, snowing,
Machine guns going,
Berlin out of sight.
The Fritzies in the trench
Behind them leave a stench;
I?d like to see my wench ?
Not the one who parleys French;
She?ll be right there to greet me.
If she?s not too old she?ll meet me,
When I get back, when I get back
In nineteen thirty-three.
Way down in the old front line,
Oh, that will do for mine !
Amidst the rain and snow
Gone are the pomp and show.
All I can think of to-night
Is the parapet of white;
Bombs are dropping, shells are popping,
No relief in sight;
The rum we ought to get
Has not been sighted yet;
I?m sure we?ll get trench feet
With nothing hot to eat.
We?ve used the bombs they gave us,
And there?s no dug-out to save us.
Till we get back, till we get back
To our old estaminet.
In nineteen thirty-three.

The Correction
May, 1917. Beautiful weather. Order from hospital at Nor-
wich: ?Report to Queen Victoria Hospital, close to Buckingham
Palace.?
I landed there with kit and the best uniform available and
was issued with instructions and ward number. The next patient
happened to be a Cornstalk with similar kit.
?Strike me, Snow,? he said, ?What are you here for ? ?
?I?ve got to meet His Majesty and be decorated with the
Victoria Cross.?
?So have I,? said the Cornstalk. ?Well, what about hopping
out and seeing London tonight ? ?
We DID.
Next morning. The order .... not Howell and Kenny, but
Mr. Howell and Mr. Kenny will meet Sgt.-Major , Grenadier
Guards, at 9.30; parade ground above Hospital. Naturally, we
complied with the ?request.?
?Mr. Howell and Mr. Kenny,? said the Sgt.-Major, ?it is my
pleasurable duty to instruct you as to the correct manner to meet
His Majesty the King to receive your coveted decorations.?
The demonstration follows.
S.M.: ?You will be called to attention. The Guards Regiment
on duty today will present the Royal salute. His Majesty will take
the salute. When your name is called you will take two sharp
paces towards His Majesty .... ONE, TWO. You will salute.
You will then take another sharp step towards His Majesty.
To the first question His Majesty will ask you will
reply ?Yes? or ?No, your Majesty.? To subsequent questions your
answer will be ?Yes? or ?No, sir.? (Stand to attention, Mr. Kenny).
If possible, your reply to the last question will be ?Yes? or ?No,
your Majesty.? The obvious burden of the instructions is that
repetition is boring even to His Majesty.?
Cornstalk: ?Now listen, Sgt.-Major, Snow and I saw London
last night. Get us a reviver and we?ll carry through.?
S.M. (horror-struck): ? impossible.?
Cornstalk Bede; ?Well, if you don?t get us a pint of beer
I will ask the blithering King for one.?
S.M. (springing to attention and saluting, a ghastly shade
suffusing his florid complexion): ?His Majesty, sir, you mean.?
Anyhow, he proved a good sport. We got our pint but not
until after the first sit-down strike on record.
Bede was a Cornstalk once.

WHAT, AGAIN?
At times the construction of an order left its actual intention
open to doubt. Such an order was issued in France, which ran:
"Horses must not be tied up to trees, otherwise they will bark
and die." Another ran: ?Men parading before Senior Officers
must be properly dressed, wearing at least a belt."
* *
The subject was "Army rum,? and several opinions had been
given on the strength of S.R.D. and how it is tested, when a Digger
enlightened the company with the "dinkum oil."
"Don?t yer know ?ow they test it ? Well, it?s this way: They
gets a new-bom lamb, and with a camel-hair brush they puts a
drop o? rum on his tongue, and if he?ll fight a bulldog the rum is

Colonel Gets The Chits
WHEN WHISKY WAS 3/4
A BOTTLE IN FRANCE
It was St. Pat-
rick?s Day in
Bapaume, and
every decent
Irishman in a
Sydney battalion
was green with
envy thinking of
the high times
his compatriots
were having that
day in Balmain
and Balmoral.
In the cellar where the sergeants
were billeted, rats were doing their
preliminary canter before the real
night-time gallops began.
?How would a few pies and a bottle
of ?house? whisky go tonight?? asked
the platoon poltroon. You could have
cut the silence with a knife. But
suddenly ?Nobby? Clark, the S.M.,
got a brain-wave.
?Listen, Boydie,? said he, ?make
up for the time you?ve been loafing.?
(For six months I had been filling a
cushy job on Birdy?s staff, but then
the staff woke up and back to the
battalion it was).
?When you were with the Brass
Hats did you notice how they got
their whisky ??
I told ?Nobby? I knew to a nicety
Just how the real stuff was obtained,
and so it was resolved there and then
that I ?give it a go? in the morning.
The canteen which headquarters
used was at Albert, about 20 miles
away, but a Tommy lorry took me
there, I explained that I was Dicky
Bond, the famous Preston North End
footballer, that I was serving with
the ?Orsetralians,? and had been sent
to get some whisky for the Colonel.
It was just a shame. The lorry
crew not only made me welcome, they
wanted me to drive. They took me
Into the canteen at Albert, introduced
me, and told me that they would be
returning to Bapaume two hours
later.
I signed the name of the Colonel,
and left with a case of Scotch. Price
�2, which worked out at 3/4 a bottle.
Back at Bapaume with 11 bottles of
whisky I was king of the cellar
that night. We drank the stuff with-
out worrying about water, told lies,
and slept like tops.
During our hike one night, we
heard revelry at the officers? mess,
and suddenly a great burst of singing.
On making enquiry, we learned the
reason for this display of goodfellow-
ship. The officers, so the Adjutant
told us, were seeing the Colonel off.
?Good luck, sir,? said one voice,
?Nobody deserves promotion more
than you do.?
?Hear, hear,? came the chorus.
?Here?s to Brigadier .?
The sergeants gave him three silent
cheers. It was great news to them.
The Colonel was the best walker in
Europe and a tough man on anybody
who couldn?t keep up with him either
in a ?hop-over? or on a route march.
Next morning he was up bright
and early for Army headquarters.
As he entered the chateau where a
famous general was quartered, he
took the steps four at a time. No
doubt he was conjuring up visions of
what holes he would drill in the
Hindenburg line with 5000 men at
his command.
He was soon inside confronting a
man whose name was famous all
over the world.
There was no ?Good morning,
Colonel. Be seated.?
Just the reverse.
?Is your name ? ? roared
the general.
?Yes, sir,? was the reply.
?Then for heaven?s sake explain
these,? shouted the famous man, at
the same time pushing across the
table a spike containing scores of
chits, every one of which represented
a case of whisky, and bore his name.
For days afterwards, any man with
a Scotch name even was under sus-
picion, but nobody ?squeaked.?

WHAT ? NO POLISH ?
One winter night on the Somme an Australian fatigue party
was making heavy weather on a trip with supplies for the front
line. At last a Digger fell into a shell-hole full of slime. Just as
he climbed out and was rubbing the half-frozen slush out of his
eyes, a staff patrol arrived on the scene and asked the fatigue
party who they were. The sodden Digger replied: ?I?m U29, you
blighter.?
* * * *
?At any rate, there?s one advantage in having a wooden leg,?
said the Digger at Randwick Hospital.
?And. what?s that ?? asked the visitor.
?Well, you can keep your socks up with tacks instead of
having to buy suspenders.?
?Now, now, boy, give up wine, women and song.
?Sorry, old dear, haven?t shung a shong for years.

I?LL CONFESS!
Can?t get the old job, can?t get the new;
Can?t carry on like I used to do.
I look around me and daily I see
Hundreds and hundreds of fellows a lot worse off than me.
In King and George Streets, friends pass me by,
I?m absolutely stranded in this land;
Yet I confess I was contented more or less
When I was stony broke in No Man?s Land.
YOU REMEMBER THE REST

If you lose your honour, you lose much.

The Difference
It was during the Pozieres stunt,
and the Fritzies were coming into
our lines by the hundred. At the head
of one batch strode a German lieuten-
ant wearing an Iron Cross. Passing
a squad of Tommies one of them
stepped out and made a grab at the
decoration. Springing to attention
the Fritz saluted, and in faultless
English said, ?I thought the English-
man was a gentleman.? The Tommy
corporal let him go.
The same thing occurred when
passing a batch of our own boys
further back. Again the Hun was
allowed to pass unmolested.
All went well until we were going
through the cook lines, when a
cookie rushed out, made a grab, and
secured the souvenir.
Fritz, springing to attention,
saluted. ?I thought the Australians
were gentlemen.?
?Gentlemen be ; i? m only

Good-bye, old Germany, farewell to you;
You?ll have no Kaiser when we?re through with you;
You?ll have no army, no shot and shell ?
Good-bye to Kaiser Bill he?s going to .
Sing me to sleep where bullets fall, let me forget the war and all;

Sing me to sleep where shells explode, and sausage bombs are a-la-mode;
Over the trenches bodies you find ?stiff ?uns in front of you ?stiff ?us behind .
Chorus :
Far, far from Ypres I want to be, where German snipers cannot get me;
Think of me crouching where the shells shriek praying for sergeant to
sing me to sleep.
I want to go home, I want to go home,
I don?t want to go to the trenches no more
Where the Jack Johnsons they rush and they roar;
I want to go home, to Australia over the sea,

There?s a little wet home in the trench, that the rain storms continually
drench;
A dead cow close by, with her hooves in the sky, and she gives off a beautiful
stench;
Underneath us in place of a floor is a mess of cold mud and some straw,
And the ?Jack Johnsons" roar as they speed through the air.
O?er my little wet home in the trench.
There are snipers who keep o-n the go, so get your old napper down low;
And the star shells at night make a deuce of a light, which causes bad
language to flow.
We?ve bullyandbiscuitstochew it?s days since we tasted a stew;
But the shells dropping there make no place to compare

INITIATIVE
The Digger, on four days? leave in London, racked
his brains for a new excuse to secure an extension of
leave. All the old jokes about dying relatives, etc., had
been worked to death. With four hours to go and a
booze-inflated headpiece, the outlook was ?up to.? Pres-
ently an excited Digger hit a telegraph office, pushed
a few civvies aside, and reached for a telegraph form.
This is what he wired : ?On the track of a rich widow
?good prospects?please wire 48 hours? extension.?
His Company Commander read it out in the mess
the same day, and a vote was taken and Bill won hands
down. Bill?s wire still adorns one wall of the Comman-
dant?s office.

Dear Sirs,
I am not a nerve case by any manner of means. Serving in the Great
War in German West Africa, the Senussi Campaign and in France, comment
was made on several occasions on the steadiness of my nerves.
When I returned to Australia my nerves were not so good, but I estab-
lished a distinct success in business. Today I meet a fairly good punch from
the Income Tax Department, and to a great degree I credit my success to
FISHERS PHOSPHERINE.
I have for years taken four or five drops every morning in a glass of
cold or warm water, according to season, and often after a hard day I take
seven or eight drops in the evening. For me it does a perfect job of work.
As a first-class executive with big responsibilities I am expected to have
a ready store of ideas, and I have not so far failed although I am advancing
rapidly through the fifties. My FISHERS PHOSPHERINE treatment costs
me a little more than 2d. per week, as the advertisement reads, perhaps 6d.,
but I value it so highly that I always have a dozen bottles on hand in case
there should be a shortage. ?
Yours faithfully,

Ginger Knew
In 1915, when the Fourth Brigade
under General Monash, was camped
at Heliopolis, I was standing along-
side Ginger Reynolds, since killed.
?Show me your identification disc,?
said the General. ?Ain?t got one,?
said Ginger. ?Tut,tut, tut,? says the
General. ?Do you know that it is a
serious crime in the Army. Do you
know what your identification disc is
for?? ?Of course,? answered Ginger,
?when I get to the front and am stifl:
enough to get my bally head blown
off, they come along, pick up the
pieces, look at my identification disc,
and stop me blooming pay.?
A Better Chance
?Now then you tourists, what UmM J
about putting those pennies away and L/[ J\j
attending to the business of making '
the world safe,? shouted the sergeant.
?What?s doing?? asked Bluey.
?They?re calling for volunteers to
patrol Sniper?s Point. What nhnuf-g:
you four hopping in for your cut??
?Any extra rum issue attached to
it?? demanded Riverina Mick (ex-
shearers? cook).
?Rum,? roared the sergeant, ?Do
you blokes think spirits will win the
war??
?No,? said Nugget, ?but it might
get us a place.?
Hidden Treasure
A Brass-hat in France, a whale
on gas-helmet inspection, was on his
way to inspect a battalion of his com-
mand when he suddenly realised that
he had forgotten his own gas helmet,
and turning into some Tommy trans-
port lines, commandeered a satchel
from the first driver he saw.
Continuing his journey, he encoun-
tered a Digger who saluted and would
have passed, but was pulled up short
by, ?Hi, my man, where the blistering
blazes is your gas helmet??
?Forgot it,? replied the Digger.
?Forgot it, did you ? And I suppose
you?ve forgotten your blanky gas drill,
too. Here, take my satchel and let
me see how long it will take you to
put your mask on.?
The Digger obediently took the
satchel, slung it round his neck,
opened it smartly and drew forth?
a pair of dirty socks.

O.C. at Hurdcot was particular
when on parade that the troops were
properly dressed. One morning he
saw a Digger minus a chin strap and
roared, ?Where?s your chin strap??
Without a flicker of an eyelid back
came the answer: ?Well, it?s like this,
sir. I was out for a walk with me
tabby lars night down the village,
and her garter broke and I couldn?t
knock about with her with her stock-
ing hanging down, could I ? So I
took off the chin strap and fixed her
stocking up and then I forgot it, I
suppose she?s still wearing it.? The
excuse must have satisfied the cap-
tain, for he gave the Digger an order
on the Q.M. for a new chin strap.

ARE YOU AMONG THESE?
Remember the good old days when we set out overseas
and got to dear old Blighty? In London they said we held
the lamp-posts up, cos we leaned against them so much.
We had some good times?and then some of us cracked
up a bit. Indigestion causing other more serious complaints.
It knocked the devil out of some of our men. They came
home and by that time Indigestion, Ulcerated Stomach,
and even Duodenal Ulcer had got a hold. And then the
miracle ?lndigestion and all Stomach Complaints banished
the Hardy way. .

DEAR BILL : Ain?t this
We haven?t seen the Kaiser for a hell of a time,
We haven?t seen the Kaiser for a hell of a time,
We came to France to see what he was doing?
The A.I.F. will be the blighters ruin.
We haven?t seen the Kaiser for a hell of a time,
Perhaps he?s been blown up by a mine;
Let?s hope so?
He?s the leader of a whiz-bang crew and damn him,
He?s no cousin of mine.
?BLIME ! I AIN?T SEEN HIM YET ! ?
WHAT
Encamped in Egypt with
the Light Horse, word came
around that the adjutant
would inspect us the follow-
ing morning, and we were
told to have everything spick
and span.
On parade the adjutant
spotted a man with a snaffle
bit instead of a military bit.
?Sergeant! ?
?Yes, sir.?
A GIRL !
?What is this man doing
with a snaffle bit??
?I dunno, sir.?
Adjutant (to the man);
?Where is the regimental
bit??
?I just seen her going into
the officers? quarters, sir.?
The adjutant, to cover his
smile, continued the inspee-


What?s In
?Johnny? Walker was orderly ser-
geant of the day. He remembered the
fact at about three o?clock in the
morning, when he was in Cairo and
the regiment at Ma?adi. He was very
fuddled when a gharry deposited him
at the camp just before reveille was
sounded.
Out tumbled the sleepy regiment
for roll-call, and dressed anyhow for
?Stables.? They could hardly believe
their eyes when they saw their
orderly sergeant all complete with
polished leggings, bandolier, and
spurs shining. Pulling out his nominal
roll book, he swayed a bit, then mus-
tered up courage.
Name ?
?C Squadron? (hie) ?answer
your names. Walker!? No answer,
but a general laugh. ,
?Walker, answer your name !? By
this time the squadron was convulsed.
Just then an officer appeared.
? Walker, wher?sh that man
Walker? ?
?Sergeant Blank, escort Sergeant
Walker to his tent. He is under ar-
rest,? came a commanding voice. Poor
old Johnny, wherever you are now,
do you remember the day when you
called out your own name first, and
got no answer?
? MAFEECH ?
? FINIS ?

Smith?s^^Weekly
Founded by Joynton Smith The Public Guardian
IS READ BY MORE THAN 100,000
DIGGERS EVERY WEEK
It Has Fought for Returned Soldiers
Ever Since Its Foundation in 1919
IT is still rendering, and
will continue to
render, that service
which every Digger is
entitled to ask of it-
?Smith?s? knows what
Australia owes to the
Diggers?and the debt
has not yet been fully
paid. It never will have
been paid so long as a
as a
Digger is in want.
That ?Smith?s? efforts
have not been in vain is
proved by some of its
achievements. The most
outstanding successes
have been the results of
?Smith?s? advocate before
Tribunals. Increases in
pensions for the past
year have totalled ap-
proximately �6900. A
further 1211 ex-Diggers have been interviewed and over
4000 have been visited in hospitals.
In addition ?Smith?s? fought for and won the amendment
of the Australian Soldiers? Repatriation Act to provide that
every male member of the A.I.F. reaching the age of 60
years, and every female at 55 years, may receive a service
pension of 36/- a fortnight for the member, or �3 a fort-
night for a member and his wife, with 5/- a fortnight extra
for each child under 14 (up to four children).
IT?S YOUR PAPER, DIG!
It keeps you in touch with the mob!

THE OLD MAN?S LIVER
(AS SUNG BY DIGGERS' SONS I
(Air Old Man River)
The old man?s liver, the old man?s liver.
His face is spotty, he?s gone half dotty,
His legs are handy through drinking brandy too strong.
He don?t drink coffee, he don?t drink cocoa.
Through drinking metho he?s off his boko ?
The old man?s liver, it just keeps rolling along.
Through drinking wine and beer and stout
He?s lying in the gutter with his tongue stuck out,
Chest all bare?l declare ! Empty bottles everywhere.
But with modern science and institutions,
And good old Tooheys and good old Schumann?s,
The old man?s liver, it just keeps rolling along.
The End of
A Perfect Day
Bill had had a full issue and he wanted to be sociable with everybody.
He negotiated a perilous crossing of King Street safely, and fixed on a big
traffic policeman.
?Daysh, constable,? said Bill. ?Yoush know me doncher??
?No, I don?t know you, Digger,?
?But yoush musht know me.?
?No, I don?t.?
?I tell yer yoush musht know me.?
Once again the John Hop denied Bill?s acquaintance.
?Thash all rot, ?cos yoush knows me. Tell yer ?oa I am, conshtable.
I'msh (hie) end of a perfeck day.
??Here we are again,? with thoughts of ?The Long, Long Trail? to
