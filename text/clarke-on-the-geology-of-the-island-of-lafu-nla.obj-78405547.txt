the amount of elevation of the lowest visible coral rock at the level
of the sea must have attained at least 500 feet from a former level.
The general surface of Lafu is that of a table land with such
hollows and elevations as now mark the surface of a coral reef; and
as the soil upon it is thin and much intermixed with decomposing
fragments of calcareous matter, no great changes have modified its
superficial condition since it attained its present elevation.
Many localities in the Pacific exhibit the occurrence of rocks of
dead coral at considerable heights above the ocean, as is the case
in Java, Timor, &c. In those instances the immediate connection
with volcanic action points to a cause of elevation. In the case of
Lafu the elevation does not appear to be connected with visible vol-
canic force; but it is highly probable that it is merely the result of
the elevation of New Caledonia, which is composed of primary and
Silurian rocks, traversed by dikes and intrusive masses of basalt
and trap; and which is everywhere surrounded (for the space of
1000 miles in one direction) by fringing and barrier reefs, of which
the Loyalty and Britannia groups are elevated portions.
To connect these reefs with portions of the sea to the south-west-
ward, and with the coasts of Australia south of the great barrier
reefs, by the discovery of blocks of loose coral, upon the mountains
of the continent, is more perhaps than can legitimately be done ; but
it is worthy of mention, that fragments of coral, in all the characters
of structure, colour and decomposition similar to the Astraa of
Lafu, have been brought to me from the ranges at the head of the
river Boyne in the Darling Downs west of Moreton Bay, in lat. 26�
40' S. and long. 151� 42' E, full 700 or 800 miles from Lafu,
and at the height of not less than 2000 feet above the sea. Whether
these fragments are true drift like the pumice, which I have found
everywhere dispersed along the shores of Eastern Australia*, and
which occurs on the high ranges of Australia Felix, far to the south ;
or whether they have been dropped by the aborigines, who frequently
carry strange substances in their bags for many miles, there is no
ground to determine; but whilst the paucity of the fragments op-
poses, the size of them favours the idea, that by some physical cause
there have been left upon the soil blocks of this species, which in
all points resemble the masses on the summit of Lafu; and upon
the supposition that they were taken from the coast and carried in-
land, it is clear that the existence of the reef-making corals may be
traced further south on the coast of New South Wales than is com-
monly imagined. Nay, certain Astrsese and other corals abound in
Port Jackson.
In conclusion, I remark, that the occurrence of the genus Astrcea
in the harbour of Port Jackson proves, that corals of this description
can thrive in shallow water of a temperature below that of the reef-
studded ocean. The lower limit of sea temperature favourable to
the growth of corals has not been ascertained; but the occurrence
of Astraeas on the shores of Port Jackson, where the average tem-
perature of the water is between 60� and 70�, varying perhaps occa-

sionally beyond 70� from the access of the great current from the
north, shows that corals do not require the amount of temperature
supposed by some authors. M. Couthouy expresses this idea, that
? Astrseas especially seem, in exposed places washed by the coral
breakers (at a temperature not over 78�), to find their most con-
genial climate*:? and Mr. Dana has shown that some species
grow in a temperature of 66�f. As the average temperature of Port
Jackson is lower than this, it is certain that some corals exist in a
considerably cooler climate than others.

The following communications were read ;
1. On the Laws of Development of Existing Vegetation and the ap-
plication of these laws to certain Geological Problems. By John
Walton, Esq.
The author?s remarks are chiefly founded on the excentrical position
of the pith of exogenous trees, which he states are caused by unequal
heat afforded to the north and south side. Fie supposes that a north
and south line drawn through the central axis in a transverse section
of a tree will generally bisect the section, while an east and west line
divides it into two unequal parts; but that at the equator and poles
such section will be bisected by either line.
He then alludes to the prevailing wind as a disturbing cause, not
however obliterating the action of the sun, and concludes that con-
temporaneous plants, whether fossil or not, being in their upright
position with their roots downwards, and having lines of like deve-
lopment parallel to each other, have grown in the place where they
are found and are in their original position. He also concludes that
if the lines of development are not parallel in beds of different ages,
the line of action of the cause of that development has changed.
He considers that many important geological conclusions may be
deduced by applying these propositions.
The author next proceeds to the subject of internal heat, and con-
siders that since it would tend to produce an equality of develop-
ment, we may determine its former extent of action by examining
the trunks of exogenous trees.
Although at first he only applied this theory to exogenous vege-
tables, he afterwards considered that the central pith of Stigmaria
and some other fossil coal plants sufficiently answered the conditions
of the problem, and thence has satisfied himself, that although the
data are not yet sufficient to base a definite argument upon, still

these methods being communicated may suggest to others observa-
tions from which results of great interest may be derived.
A short additional paper was afterwards read from the same au-
thor, in which he stated, that after examining many exogenous trees
from Portland island, he is satisfied that the sun?s heat was as much
above the internal heat at the time of the deposit of the beds of
Portland oolite as it is now, the stems being similarly excentrical.
He also thinks that the small thickness of the rings of these trees
proves that the growth of vegetation was not formerly more rapid
than it is now.
In conclusion, the author directs attention to the importance of
accurately observing all instances of upright stems of trees that may
be discovered in situ.
2. Remarks on the Geology of the Island of Samos.
By Lieut. Spratt, R.N., F.G.S.
Plates 11. 111.
The island is divided into two equal parts by a high mountain run-
ning transversely across from the north to the south shore, and at-
taining a height of 4000 feet. The ancient as well as modern name
of this range is Ampeloni.
Besides Mount Ampeloni, there are two other conspicuous moun-
tains rising at the two extremes of the island. The western one,
Mount Kerki, is the highest point in the island and is 4000 feet
above the sea. The eastern mountain is the least in elevation of the
three, and does not exceed 1200 feet. Mounts Kerki and Ampeloni
are composed of a mass of crystalline limestone overlying mica
schists, but whether conformably I had no opportunity of observing;
neither can I speak of the amount and direction of the dip of these
older rocks; in Mount Kerki however the dip was considerable,
whilst in Ampeloni and the eastern mountain it is not great; in the
latter indeed the strata are nearly horizontal, so that the schistose
rocks do not appear at all.
These mountains are connected together by a series of flat-topped
hills and ridges from 400 to 800 feet in height. The deposits forming
these are all of freshwater origin, and appear by their fossils to be
identical with the lacustrine formations on the shores of the Gulf of
Smyrna and the island of Scio, which have been described on a
former occasion, and are supposed to be of eocene date.
The portion of the island of Samos described in this paper, the
only part I had an opportunity of examining closely, is the district
lying to the east of Ampeloni between Port Vathy on the north,
and the site of the ancient city of Samos on the south side of the
island.
The accompanying section is on a line between these points, where

the inclined strata represent the lacustrine deposits, consisting of
thick beds of a white compact limestone, not easily distinguished in
mineral character from some of the secondary limestones containing
Nummulites which occur in the southern part of Asia Minor.

The lower deposits of this formation are the most compact and
thick-bedded ; but the upper portion of the series is more thinly
stratified than the former, and occasionally interstratified with white
and grey marls. The thickness of the whole deposit exceeds 1000
feet; but as the formation upon which it reposes is nowhere visible,
its entire thickness is not seen.
Fossils occur in several localities, but not in any great abundance
or in a very good state of preservation, the cast only of the shells
remaining. Vegetable impressions are more abundant, and appear
to have been made of plants which grew at the bottom of the lake.
A species of reed often occurs in clusters like a number of cylindrical
pipes, the cavities formed by the imbedded reeds not having been
filled by calcareous matter after their decomposition. They are
nearly always found in a vertical position.
The localities at which I found these reeds are (1) the western
shore of Port Vathy; (2) cliffs at the ruins of the ancient city of
Samos ; and (3) on the summit of the ridge about two miles north-
east of the large village of Mitelinious, where also, besides the casts
of the reeds, there are abundant impressions of stems with leaves
attached.
The longest of these stems with attached leaves was 18 inches,
and the diameter of the reeds inch. Both kinds of vegetable
remains are fossilized in a vertical position, as if imbedded in the
deposited sediment whilst growing at the bottom of the lake. The
strata in which they are found are exceedingly hard, owing to the
presence of silex. With these plants I found a single specimen of a
Planorbis, which seems to be Planorhis rotundatus, very abundant
in the freshwater deposits in the Gulf of Smyrna. The other shells
are a Paludina and a Melania, both procured from the south face of
the hill upon which stands the Acropolis of the ancient city of
Samos. The Melania is also found on the hills bordering the west
shore of Port Vathy. From the promontory on the east side of the
ancient port I procured several specimens of Helix. They are asso-
ciated with casts of a Lymneus, identical with that found in the
lacustrine beds of the Gulf of Smyrna, and therefore identifying this
formation as a portion of the bed of the great eocene lake which
doubtless formerly extended over the area now occupied by the
iEgean Sea.
I have now to notice another formation of a subsequent date, but
whose origin is uncertain, from the absence of fossils by which to iden-
