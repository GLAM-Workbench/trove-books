THE COMMONWEALTH
ELECTION.
ELECTORS OF TASMANIA,
On the 3rd June, 1898, you declared by a four to one vote in favour of 66 The Federal Constitution M adopted
by the Melbourne Convention: on the 27th of this month you will be asked to ratify this decision at the Polls, and
prove to the w orld your abundant faith in the cause of Australian nationhood.
A our vote is required on the 27th instant to approve of some few Amendments in that Bill, w hich the popular
voice passed by an overwhelming* majority on the 3rd June, 1898. These Amendments have been adopted by your
brothers of New South Wales and South Australia: only three of them concern Tasmania in any way, and those
three are such as you may accept without demur. In the name of our common brotherhood I ask you to be one with
the electors of Australia who have led the way in this final Referendum. For the sake of that broader and loftier
national life that Federation will assure to us : for the sake of the general welfare w Inch will come with Federation
as the consequence of expanded and unshackled trade, and widened industrial development: for the sake of the
brotherly amity and national strength that will come of Australian union, I appeal to you to let your voice be heard
through the ballot-box on the 27th July, and, by voting* 44 aye” in sufficient numbers, to feel that you are of those who
may justly pride themselves as the builders of a Commonwealth that shall stand without shame side by side with the
Powers of the world.
Electors and brother Colonists, do not let apathy steal from you the opportunity of making* Tasmania’s voice
heard through these Southern lands in the epoch-making* Referendum of this month. See that your vote in this year
largely exceeds in number that of 1898, as do the votes taken in New South Wales and South Australia: see that
this cause, which is yours—the People’s cause —is carried to a glorious triumph on this coming 27th July.
Hobart 9 1 5th July , 1899.
