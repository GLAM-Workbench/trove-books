REPORT
OF THE
COMMITTEE APPOINTED TO SUPERINTEND
THE ERECTION OF
ST. ANDREW’S CHURCH, SYDNEY.
The Committee appointed at a Public Meeting in 1833, to
superintend the erection of St. Andrew’s Scots Church, having
effected that object, and by the liberal support of the public,
and aid from Government, having placed it upon a basis cal-
culated, they trust, to benefit their fellow Colonists, feel
much pleasure in presenting to those interested, a brief outline
of their proceedings, since the commencement of their labours.
In the month of October 1832, it was considered advisable,
by a considerable number of persons resident in the southern
parts of Sydney, to increase the facilities for attending Divine
Service, by the erection of a second Scots Church, the number
of Presbyterian families in that district having greatly increased,
from the time the Scots Church was founded in 1824, and that
Church being placed at a considerable distance. This was
the more easily effected at that time, as the Rev. John M'Gar-
vie, A.M., agreed to preach in a temporary place of worship,
until a suitable edifice could be erected. Divine service was
accordingly commenced in the Old Court House, on the 18th
November 1832, with the knowledge and concurrence of the
minister of the Scots Church, then resident in Sydney, and
the approval of the Government, and has been continued there,
and in St. Andrew’s Church ever since.
Early in the year 1833, application was made by memorial,
to His Excellency the Governor, for an allotment of Land, to
erect a Church, which was immediately complied with ; and
several eligible sites having been examined, the most suitable
was selected ; and in June of the same year permission was


granted for the occupation of the same. The requisite steps
were taken to carry into effect the object proposed ; and accord-
ingly on the 15th July, 1833, a public meeting was held, at
which the late Mr. Thomas Shepherd presided, and various
resolutions having been adopted, subscriptions were entered
into, to the amount of nearly £2OO. Your Committee were
then appointed to receive subscriptions, procure plans and
estimates, and make other arrangements, for erecting the
Church. Such was the liberality of the public, that in the
beginning of August, thereafter, the sum subscribed amounted
to £640. Your Committee then considered it advisable to
ascertain, whether the Government would grant an equal
amount to the subscriptions paid up, no precedent existing at
that time, for such procedure in regard to Scots Churches. A
Sub-Committee, consisting of Mr. Thomas Shepherd, Dr.
Wallace, Thomas Barker, Esq., and the Rev. John M’Garvie,
were appointed to wait upon His Excellency the Governor, to
state the progress already made, and to request that His Excel-
lency would be pleased to p'ace in the Estimates for 1834, an
equal sum to that furnished by the subscribers. The Deputa-
tion were favourably received, and were highly gratified by
the interview with His Excellency; and agreeably to that
ready attention to the public welfare which has characterised
His Excellency’s administration—a prompt assurance of sup-
port was given, as far as His Excellency was enabled to com-
ply with the request of the Committee. On the first oppor-
tunity after the meeting of the Legislative Council, the sum of
five hundred pounds was voted for St. Andrew’s Church, which
was received early in 1835.
Previous to the receipt of this sum from Government,contracts
had been entered into for building the Church, conformable to
plans and specifications furnished by Edward Hallen, Esq., who
gratuitously and generously offered to superintend the progress
of the work; and whose ability and attention greatly assistedyour
Committee in their duties. Every arrangement having been
previously made, the foundation stone was laid by the Hon.
Colonel Snodgrass, C.B. & M.C., to whose exertions on their
behalf, on this and many other occasions, the Presbyterian
community are deeply indebted. The walls were erected in a
very short period, and the building roofed in.
In the mean time, your Committee and the acting Trustees
continued to solicit their friends and the public for additional
subscriptions in which they were remarkably successful—they
collected to the amount of £282, and trusting to the general


principle adopted by the Government, that an equal sum would
be granted from the Colonial Revenue, your Committee made a
second successful application for that amount. This aid gave
an impulse to the work, and the edifice was finished with
Gothic ceiling, windows, gallery, and pulpit to correspond,
about the beginning of September. The lamented decease of
one of their number, Mr. Thomas Shepherd, on the 30th of
August, whose exertions had been most unceasing, and most
successful, was severely felt as a loss to the Committee, and
to the public at large.
On Sunday, the 13th September 1835, Divine service was
performed in the Church for the first time, to a numerous and
respectable congregation, by the Rev. John M'Garvie, A. M.,
from 2nd Samuel, vii. 29, “ therefore now let it please thee to
bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever
before thee.” The field of usefulness opened up by the addi-
tion of a Church of the Presbyterian communion established
in the southern part of Sydney, was calculated to awaken the
most gratifying conceptions; every accession of this kind to
Colonial establishments, affording a powerful incentive and
means to disseminate truth, religion, and virtue.
The.cost of the building having much exceeded the original
estimates, which did not include the gallery, pulpit, and Gothic
finish of the ceiling, it was found, in July 1836, that about
£6OO was still due to the Treasurer, The friends of the un-
dertaking, therefore, made a third successful appeal to the
public, and to the Colonial Government, and the sum of £3OO
voted by the Council for the present year, has placed the Trea-
surer’s accounts in the state they now present this day.
The brief outline thus given, will, it is hoped, prove satis-
factory ; and the Committee will now proceed to state a few
circumstances incidentally connected with their proceedings.
A collection was made in Church on the first Sunday of 1836,
for enclosing the ground to prevent injury to the building.
The sura of £27 14s. was paid into the Treasurer’s hands for
that object, but owing to a contemplated alteration in the align-
ment of the street in front of the Church —the operations re-
cently carried on in Kent-street, and principally in expectation
of getting a corner of the Old Burial Ground, to make square
the piece of ground on which the Church stands, and for which
application has been made—for these reasons your Committee
have not been able to erect a wall or fence as intended. This
object however, is still kept in view, as well as a renewal of
the application for the ground in question, and in the mean


time, the Treasurer has given credit for that sum in the general
account.
Your Committee have now nearly succeeded in completing
the duly assigned them, and they find, that from the liberal
encouragement afforded by the public, aided by similar sums
from Government, the balance in their favour this day is
£ll 14s. lid. They are emboldened, therefore, to call the at-
tention of this meeting to the next important part of their duty,
for the discharge of which they were appointed, viz : —the
building of a dwelling house, for the minister of the Church,
and a public school on the vacant ground adjoining the Church,
drawings and estimates for which, are now submitted for your
approval. For these plans, specifications, &c., we are indebted
to the spontaneous and gratuitous attention of Mr. Hume, a
member of this congregation, on whose skill and accuracy your
Committee can fully rely. He informs us, that the dwelling-
house will cost £6OO, one half of which the Presbytery can
procure from the Government, should an equal amount be pro-
vided by the public. This small sum required from the con-
gregation, it is to be hoped, will be obtained without difficulty.
Your Committee have to lament the manner in which your
esteemed minister has been situated in this respect, calling
more imperatively on the congregation, now to provide a
suitable dwelling, which independent of that circumstance,
is calculated to give a permanent status and finish to the
Church, besides affording facilities to persons having occasion
to visit the minister.
With respect to one school-house for boys, and another for
girls, an application has been made by the Presbytery to the
Legislative Council, for a requisite sum for this purpose, on
the same terms on which similar sums have been granted to
the Episcopalian and Roman Catholic communities. Pend-
ing this application, the Committee do not think it advis-
able to recommend that any further proceedings be adopted,
till an answer has been returned from the Government.
The state of the Burial Ground in Sydney, is such as to de-
mand immediate attention. Trustees for the ground were
named in April 1836, by wder of Government; but it appears
expedient that the Presbytery should again petition His Ex-
cellency for an allowance of money for that purpose. Burial
Grounds are peculiarly objects of public care; and the claim
to have this ground enclosed at the expense of the Government
is the more reasonable, that one side line will also enclose (he
government ground attached to the House of Correction, and


the Benevolent Aslyum, a second side will be a fence to a pub-
lic road, and the third side will equally enclose part of the
Roman Catholic burying-ground. This, as well as the school-
house, however, should remain as it stands, till the reply has
been received by the Presbytery, from the Government.
Your Committee having thus discharged the greater part of
the duty entrusted to them by the congregation of St. Andrew’s
Church, with the exception of a house for the minister, and
the schools ; and the distinct assurance having been given by
Government, that aid will be granted to an equal amount with
that subscribed, they hope that the obvious utility of these
erections, will induce the public to extend the requisite aid by
the supply of funds, and your Committee will continue as they
have done, to exert all their influence and efforts to complete
these works on which a large portion of the spiritual welfare
of future generations will depend. The diffusion of knowledge
and truth, religion and virtue, peace on earth, and good will
to men, should be objects of solicitude with society at large.—
While other communions are laudably emulous of the character
they support, founded on this basis, the members of our Church
cannot be supposed to be insensible to the high station their
country and church maintain in every quarter of the world, for
intelligence and virtue. It is to be hoped that the day is not
distant when more numerous churches, and more easy facilities
for attending Divine Service, will raise the character of the
Colony we inhabit, and render it like the mother country for
religion, the admiration and delight of the world—the strong
hold of Christian privileges, the foster-parent of religious
purity.
