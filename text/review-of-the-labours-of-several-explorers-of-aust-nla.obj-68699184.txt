REVIEW
OF THE LABORS OP SEVERAL
EXPLORERS OF AUSTRALIA
Now that the centre of Australia has at length been reached, and the
Continent itself crossed from shore to shore, it may not be without
interest if we view the several labors of our explorers in this field. I
piopose, therefore, to trace the progress of Australian discovery from
its first small beginnings. I propose to follow the white man from his
snuill village on Port Jackson to his rich settlement along the borders
of the great Interior. We shall accompany the adventurous pioneer
into that great Interior itself. Here we shall be able to place a
loui ishmg colony, mapped, surveyed, and partitioned out into its
several districts and townships; there the mere fragments of a river or
mountain range; often we shall be obliged to leave an absolute blank
Nor shall we have to revert to any very distant period. It is not quite
. ty years since the inhabitants of one small village discovered a rift
in the mountain range which confined them to the shores of Port
Jackson. Thence we shall trace the tide of settlement, and the ex-
plorers who led it. We shall find them again and again repulsed but
again and again returning to the charge. We shall behold them now
retreating from their lines, and now breaking through to rich territories
winch lie beyond. Now we shall abandon the search as worthless, and
anon we shall be led through waving pastures and by the banks of
deep and clear waters. We shall turn aside from the hot blast of the
desert and find the cool breezes of the south sighing around us. For
a moment, too, we shall behold the curtain raised on the awful Interior
and then dropped for years. For a moment we shall gaze on those*
vast ruins of nature lifeless among the tropics, blasted amid perpetual
sunshine; and then all is Conjecture.
The name Australia, now universally adopted to designate the whole Island Conti
nent, was suggested by the gallant, unfortunate and ill-requited Flinders, in his account
previous to the voyage of Captain Cook. ?
the Dutch, who first explored the whole Northern Coast, called it New Holland ? and
Captam Cook, after sailing round the South-East Coast, gave it the name of New South
Wales, from its supposed resemblance to that part of Great Britain.
Victoria was named by Captain Phillip, the first Governor of New South Wales after

All that was known of it in Europe a few years ago was that it produced very fine
wool and, under the generally applied term of Botany Bay, it was considered rather an
ehgible residence for ladies and gentlemen who quitted their country ? for their countrv?s
good. Even the settlers on the spot were, for many long years, but little better
informed ol the actual condition, not only of the interior, but also of the coast It is
but as yesterday in the records of Time, that South Australia was colonized, hr Act of
Parliament, and the Primitive huts of Batman and Fawkner were first erected on the
banks of the Yana. from time to time a few intrepid men, quitting the settlement at
Port Jackson, endeavoured .to ascertain the nature of the unexplored country beyond


the coast districts. But their efforts were repeatedly frustrated. Sometimes their
travels ended iu vast spreading marshes, and sometimes in sterile and waterless plains.
More than one brave explorer returned disheartened from the borders of apparently
interminable deserts, and some have perished in unknown wilds?victims to their love
of science, and the spirit of adventure. It is not a little singular that both on the eastern
and southern shores of Australia, Frenchmen have disputed with our countrymen tor
the honour of discovery, and the cpnsequent right of possession. -Thus, when
Governor Phillip sailed from Botuay Bay in search of a more eligible site for the settle-
ment, the famous navigator, La Perouse, sailed in, and landing on the shore, claimed the
territory in the name of the French nation. And in 1802 our own Flinders, and he
French Captain Baudin, almost simultaneously discovered the Port Phillip and tl
coast of South Australia. That Flinders was first there is now no doubt, but Baudin
(having been allowed to inspect Flinders? charts), gave the name of Richelieu to Cape
Otwav ?re-named the Gulfs of Spencer and St. Vincent as Bonaparte and Josephin
Gulfs, and conferred on the land lying between these points the title of Terre Napoleon.
And when Flinders put into tire Port of Mauritius, on his homeward voyage, he was
detained a prisoner of war for seven years, whilst the French Government published an
account of Baudin?s voyage, and laid claim, by virtue of his pretended discoveries, to the
entire southern coast of Australia. _ , . 1(11 � . orl Mr
The first attempt to explore the interior of Australia was made in 1817, when Mr.
Oxley, the Surveyor-General, started from Sydney with the view of penetrating the
unknown regions to the westward. Striking the Lachlan River, he followed its winding
course through an arid country until it emptied its waters into an immense swamp. In
the following year he traced the Macquarie in like manner, until he was checked by higli
reeds, covering an extensive plain, amidst which the channel of the river was lost.
Another river (the Oastlereagh) was traced into a similar morass; and the inference
drawn?not unreasonably?by Mr. Oxley, was that the united waters of these and other
streams terminated iu an inland sea. or basin, whilst the country South of the parallel
of 34� and west of 147 i � ? was declared to be ?uninhabited, and useless for all the
purposes of civilized men.? It was not until 1824 that any further attempt was made
to explore the southern portion of Australia. In that year two squatters when in search
of a run (Messrs. Hume and Hovel) discovered the Upper Murray, and travelled through
a magnificent open country, until they finally arrived at the shores of Port Philip,
somewhere in the neighbourhood of the present site of Geelong. In 18-8, an expedi-
tion was fitted out by the Government of New South Wales, and its conduct was happily
intrusted to a gentleman who stands in the front rank of our explorers?the gallant
Captain Sturt. Sturt first endeavoured to follow the downward course of the Macquarie,
but ere Ion" he encountered beds of monstrous reeds, and swamps of apparently bound-
less extent,�in which the channel of the river was lost. Foiled in this direction he
turned to the N.W., and discovered a large river, to which he gave the name of Darling,
and after other attempts to penetrate the increasing mystery of the interior, he returned
to Sydney in doubt whether the waters of this river made their way to the southern
coast, or were ultimately exhausted in feeding a succession of swamps; or whe ner
finally they fell into a Mediterranean sea still to be discovered. To solve the interesting
problem thus propounded, another expedition was fitted out, and in November, 18-.,
Sturt again set forth, and from this date may be said to commence the history ot the
Australian Colonies. On this occasion he resolved to trace the Murrumbidgee down-
wards from its sources. Putting together a whale-boat, which they had biought with
them, and constructing a smaller boat from the trees of the forest, Sturt and his com-
panions embarked upon the waters of the Murrumbidgee, and suffered themselves to be
borne by the rapid current down its hitherto unexplored course. Ihe boats were
allowed to drift along at pleasure, and such was the force with which we had been shot
out of the Murrumbidgee, that we were carried nearly to the bank opposite its embou-
chure, whilst we continue to gaze in silent astonishment on the capacious channel we
had entered.* The river thus discovered was the Murray, the course of which Sturt
? Sturt?s Vol. 1.


successfully followed to Encounter Bay. And then came the perils of the return voyage.
The swift current of the river, which had befriended them in their downward progress
was now a formidable obstacle. The banks were lined with hostile savages, who
showered their spears upon the white intruders whenever an opportunity offered. Their
only remaining provisions were a little tea and some flour, and of the latter only twelve
ounces per diem tor each man?s allowance. Becoming faint with shartened allowance,
the limbs of the sturdy explorers waxed weaker and weaker. Their sunken glassy eye
and listless expression told the tale of hunger; but there was no reproach for their
leader, so tender was their regard that even in the selfishness of starvation the men
agreed not to touch the last remaining luxury?six (6) pounds of sugar?that was to be
the portion for their kind captain.
After a weary progress of eight weeks, the entire party ?utterly worn out and ex-
hausted their last ounce of flour consumed, and their limbs so swollen that they
could scarcely bear the body?s burden ?arrived at Pondebadgery, on the upper Murrum-
bidgee, where they found assistance and supplies of provisions awaiting them. ?It is
impossible, ? says the gallant Napier, and every generous mind must endorse the senti-
ment, ?It is impossible to read the account of Captain Sturt?s expedition down the
Murray without feeling much admiration for our countryman and his companions, who,
casting themselves upon a great river, with little besides their courage to sustain their
efforts, allowed the stream to bear them, reckless and resolved, into the heart of the
desert; an intrepid enterprise ! nnanimated by the glory of battle, yet accompanied by
the hardships of a campaign?without splendour, and without reward.?
In 1836, another baud of explorers, under Major?afterwards Sir?Thomas Mitchell,
passed the Murray, and traversed the principal part of Victoria. Crossing the Gram-
pians, he came upon the Glenelg, and subsequently upon the Wannon. Thence his
course led him towards Portland Bay. A broken tobacco pipe lying in his path naturally
arrested his attention, and shortly after the blue smoke curling from some huts upon the
sea shore announced the presence of civilized humanity. As he approached these, his
career was nearly cut short, for the Messrs. Henty, who had there founded a whaling
station, quickly loaded a four-pounder, and were on the point of firing into the approach-
mg party when it was discovered that the supposed bushrangers were the Surveyor-
General of New South Wales and his men. On his return to Sydney, he emphatically
declared it to be one of the finest and most favoured countries under heaven?fit for
eventually becoming one of the greatest nations of the earth ; ? and in his honest
enthusiasm he bestowed upon the district, thus richly endowed by nature, the eupho-
nious appellation of Australia Felix?the Happy Southern Land.*
About the same time the province of South Australia was founded by English
settlers, and the city of Adelaide was called into existence upon the banks of the
Torrens. Amongst the residents of the latter colony were two gentlemen whose names
are inseperabiy associated with the progress of Australian discovery?l refer to Sturt
and Eyre. In the year 1839. the latter gentleman attempted to penetrate into the interior ?
from Mount Arden, at the head of Spencer?s Gulf, but baffled by the difficulties which
he encountered in the basin of Lake Torrens, he proceeded to Port Lincoln, and thence
skirting the south coast, reached Fowler?s Bay at the western boundary of the province.
? He then, ? says Sturt, ? determined on one of those bold movements which characterise
all his enterprises; and leaving the coast struck away to the N.E. for Mount Arden,
along the Gawler Ranges ; but the prospect from the summit of that rugged line of hills
threw darkness only on the view he obtained of the distant interior, and he returned to
Adelaide, without having penetrated further north than 29 � 30', notwithstanding the
unconquerable perseverance and energy be had displayed.? In the following year the
enterprising colonists determined on sending forth another expedition. This party
consisted of six Europeans and two native boys (of whom more hereafter); and the
command was entrusted to Eyre, who had volunteered for the post. Again starting from
Mount Arden, Eyre sought to discover a habitable country on the eastern shores of the
western arm of Lake Torrens; but his exeitions were unsuccessful.
* For this discovery he received his knighthood.


The appearances observed by Mr. Eyre on the present occasion at four different
points on its western arm, together with some researches of Capt. Sturt, on its supposed
eastern arm, on an exploring expedition, to which -we shall presently come, are the
principal grounds for this view of the Torrens basin. More recently, however, it has
been ascertained that what was known as Lake Torrens, is not one, but several takes?
in fact, a semicircular chain of lakes, or mud holes?and that, more curiously still, a
portion of its western arm is the terminus of a river, which takes its rise on the east
coast of the Continent, some 1500 miles distant. At present, however, we have to follow
the strange adventures of Mr. Eyre. Abandoning Lake Torrens, he threw himself
entirely upon Flinders? Eange, hoping that the slopes of its hills would furnish suffi-
cient water to his party in their progress northward. But hill after hill grew smaller
and less frequent, and gradually the country settled down into a desolate level. One
peak still rose from the plain, and from this, named by him Mount Hopeless, he
determined to take a last observation. Without water or food for the horses, and through
a low sandy country, his party bore down on Mount Hopeless, and ascended to its
summit, ? and cheerless and hopeless indeed,? he writes, ? was the prospect before us.?
As he had feared, all trace of Flinders? Eange now ceased, and before him lay a wide
desolate level, interrupted only by the ridge forming the shore of the still more gloomy
lake. This ridge of the lake, which, at each point of previous observations, had been
bending round from west to east, now appeared on his right hand. Supposing, there-
fore, that his only means of escape from this apparently uninterrupted semicircular
basin was by descending to either of its southern extremities; he returned to the head
of Spencer?s Gulf where a narrow isthmus separates the waters of the gulf from Lake
Torrens, and crossed into the Port Lincoln district, intending to resume his northern
course when sufficiently clear of the lake. Eepeated attempts, however, proved the
impracticability of forcing a passage northward from this portion of the coast. At every
point, when advancing a few miles inland, impenetrable scrub, and a total absence of
water and food for the cattle drove the expedition back. Nor did it appear an easier
task to advance along the coast itself. Leaving the main portion of his men at Powder?s
Bay, Mr. Eyre made three several attempts to round the Great Bight, hoping that, after
passing that portion of the coast, the country would be found to open more favourably
inland ; but, after encountering great hardships, and the loss of several of his horses, he
rounded the Great Bight only to behold the same impenetrable country. The objects
proposed for the Northern Exploration Expedition seemed therefore impossible of
attainment; and Mr. Eyre, on his return to Fowler?s Bay, sent the men composing it
back to Adelaide. Mr. Eyre himself we have now to follow through a feat the most
wonderful in the whole annals of exploration. We have already mentioned that the
rich pastures of King George?s Sound and Swan Eiver bad been the subject of discussion
in Adelaide. They lay at the extremity of the South Coast; but was it likely that they
were confined to the extremity of the South Coast? Was it likely that a coast district,
1500 miles long, was absolutely barren ? An explorer would be certain to meet good
intermediate districts, and' good intermediate districts would bring the whole of the
North-West Coast within reach of the Adelaide fiockowners. The northern route had
been adopted at Mr. Eyre?s own request, enforced by his own experience in the Port
Lincoln district. His present excursion to the head of the Great Bight proved the
difficulties of a western route along the coast to be far greater than he had stated to
the Exploration Committee in Adelaide; but Mr. Eyre now determined to take up the
western route, and so force a passage to King George?s Sound. The South Coast, from
Fowler?s Bay to King George?s Sound, lay as Captain Flinders had sketched it from his
ship. Indeed, down to the present time, Mr. Eyre himself is the solitary white man
who has trod its desolate wilds. From the summit of the cliffs, which had frowned
down on the topmasts of H.M.S. Investigator, stretched inland a table-land without rise
or fall, until a dense and impenetrable skirting of scrub hid it from sight. This table
land Mr. Eyre had now ascertained to he an unbroken sheet of limestone. At the
bottom of the cliffs the action of the current had hollowed out immense caverns, and
occasionally huge portions of the rock became detached and tumbled into the ocean,
showing by the rapidity with which they were engulfed the hopelessness of finding any


path by the margin of the sea. Inland, the country seemed equally unpromising, and
the only portion capable of sustaining animal existence was a narrow slip extending
along the edge of the table land; overlooking the sea. Here the action of the wind bad
collected some scattered heaps of sand, on which grew a few tufts of sour grass and
salsolaceous herbs. But already, from Fowler?s Bay to the head of the Great Bight,
neither lake, pond, nor stream had been discovered; and we may now say that from
Fowler?s Bay to King George?s Sound, a distance of upwards 1500 miles, no vestige of a
water-course, nor any surface lake, or pond, was met. During the day, a strong wind
blows from the interior, sometimes scorching in its heat, and loaded with fine sand.
Towards evening this is met by a chilling breeze, coming up from the great Southern
Ocean; and doubtless to the action of these two winds is to be attributed the deposition
of sand on the limestone surface along the edge of this exposed table land. Occasionally,
at intervals of 150 and 200 miles, the sand had been formed into a cluster of hills, and
on digging down to the limestone at these places, a little brackish water was found to
ooze out between the sand and the rock. Strange as it may seem, this was the only
water at all approaching fresh which could be discovered along the whole course of this
terrible journey.
In undertalcing this most forbidding task, Mr. Eyre had determined to risk the life
of no European save himself. The men composing the North Exploring Expedition
had, therefore, been sent back to Adelaide; but the overseer of the party, a servant
long in the employment of Mr. Eyre, and a man of great energy and courage,
refused to leave his master, and Mr. Eyre at length consented to accept his assistance.
In addition, he retained two aboriginal young men, who had been some time in his
service on his farm, and a third aboriginal, named Wylie, a native of King George?s
Sound, who had lately arrived in Adelaide in a vessel which had touched there.
With these Mr. Eyre commenced making some necessary preparations, and giving Ids
horses rest before finally leaving Fowler?s Bay. He had informed the Governor by
letter of the resolution which he had formed; but, in addition, the officers and men
of the disbanded expedition made known, on their return to Adelaide, the great
difficulties which Mr. Eyre had already experienced in his several efforts to round the
Great Bight, and the singularly unpromising nature of the country beyond its head.
From these it appeared that Mr. Eyre was advancing on certain destruction, and a
Government sloop was immediately despatched to Fowler?s Bay with a strong recom-
mendation from the Governor to return, accompanied by an official approval of his
conduct as leader of the late Northern Exploring Expedition. But Mr. Eyre?s
resolution was not to be changed, and the sloop returned to Adelaide without him.
?We were now 7 alone,? he writes, ? myself, my overseer, and the three native boys,
with a fearful task before us. The bridge w 7 as broken down behind us, and we must
succeed in reaching King George?s Sound, or perish. No middle course remained.?
Having constructed bags to hold water, and giving the cattle sufficient rest, Mr. Eyre
commenced his remarkable journey. His stock of provisions then consisted of some
sheep remaining over from the disbanded expedition, and a few bags of flour. The
head of the Great Bight was again rounded, and the same forbidding nature of country
was found to extend along its western arm, the only vegetation being a few scattered
tufts of grass, and the only water being procured from beneath the sand hills,
occurring at intervals of 100 and 200 miles.
That man or beast should travel through a succession of such intervals, extending
over upwards of 1500 miles, is indeed wonderful, and I believe wholly without
parallel. Sometimes a group of sand hills occurred at the end of one or two day?s
march ; more frequently scarcely a blade of grass, and not a drop of water, was met
for a whole week, and human endurance, taxed beyond what it might be believed
possible for human endurance to sustain, was no longer supported by the hope that
another group was yet in advance, or that retreat was possible. Mr Eyre?s progress
during one of these long intervals between water and water may be thus sketched?
After a halt of three or four days at one of these groups of sand hills to recruit, the
horses were again loaded for a fresh start, the bags were filled with water, and the
sheep were let out of their pen. For two or three days the horses were able to carr


the few hags of flour, water, and other necessary baggage. On the fourth day their
strength began to fail, and it became necessary to lighten their loads, the rejected
articles being left on the way-side. On the fifth and sixth days, the horses became
totally exhausted, and no exertions could force them to proceed further. Leaving
them also stretched on the way-side, Mr. Eyre and his men, with the empty water
bags, hurried forward until the next group of sand hills appeared above the horizon.
Arriving at these, they immediately proceeded to scoop out a well, considerable labor
and delay being occasioned by the repeated falling in of the sand. Beaching the
surface of the lime stone, they quenched their thirst, and took a few hours? rest,
while the water-bags were filling. The whole party then shouldered the bags, and
proceeded back to the horses ; and these they generally succeeded in bringing on by
easy stages to the sand hills, though occasionally they found one of the wretched
and worn out animals in its last struggles. Having brought everything living to the
water, the most laborious task yet remained. Their provisions and few indispensable
articles were still strewed along their track; and, while the horses were taking some
rest, it was necessary to go back and collect them, Mr. Eyre and his men carrying
them on their backs a distance of sometimes forty or fifty miles. In addition to
these immense labours, a further task devolved on Mr. Eyre and the overseer. The
horses, though found unable to endure the same privation as the men, were never-
theless essential to the preservation of the party. Notwithstanding their fatigue,
the want of water made them restless during the night, and, when not closely
watched, they seized every opportunity to return to the last watering place?the
scattered position of the few tufts of herbage rendered it impossible to tether them.
Nor could so important a task be safely entrusted to the two aborigines. Mr. Eyre
and the overseer therefore agreed to divide each night between them, so as by strict
watch to ensure the possession of the horses in the morning. In this manner Mr.
Eyre and his small party had toiled on for two months, and had now accomplished
more than half their journey, when an appalling act of treachery plunged him in
fresh difficulties, and seemed to render his ultimate escape hopeless. In the midst
of one of these long stages between water and water, they had encamped for the
night, and Mr. Eyre had taken the first watch over the horses. It was approaching
towards midnight, when Mr. Eyre?s watch would expire, and he would be relieved by
the overseer. The horses in their restlessness had led him some distance from the
camp, when the report of a gun interrupted the sighing of the breeze over these
desolate wilds. Startled by so unusual an occurrence, Mr. Eyre immediately hastened
back to the camp. I met the King George?s Sound native, Wylie, running towards
me, and in great alarm, crying ? Oh, massa, oh, massa ! come here ; ? but could gain
no information from him as to what had occurred. Upon reaching the encampment,
which I did in about five minutes after the shot was fired, I was horror struck to
find my poor overseer weltering in his blood, and in the last agonies of death.
Glancing hastily round the camp, I found it deserted by the two younger native
boys, whilst the scattered fragments of our baggage, which 1 left carefully piled up
under the oilskin, lay thrown about in wild disorder, and at once revealed the cause
of the harrowing scene before me. Upon raising the body of my faithful but ill-
fated follower, I found that he was beyond all human aid. He had been shot through
the left breast with a ball. The last convulsions of death were upon him, and he
expired almost immediately after our arrival. The frightful, the appalling truth now
burst upon me, that I was alone in the desert. He who had faithfully served me
for many years, who had followed my fortunes in adversity and in prosperity, who
had accompanied me in all my wanderings, and whose att chment to me had been
his sole inducement to remain with me in this last and, to him alis, fatal journey,
was now no more. For an instant I was almost tempted to wish that it had been
my own fate instead of his. The horrors of my situation glared upon me with such
startling reality as, for a i ins ant, almost to paralyse the mind. At the dead hour
of night, in the wildest and most inhospitable wa to of Australia, with a fierce wind
racing in unison with the scene of violence before me, I was left with a single native,
whose fidelity I could not rely upon, and who, for ought I knew, m ght be in league


with the other two, who, perhaps, were even now lurking about -with a view of taking
away my own life, as they had done that of the overseer. Three days had passed
away since we left the last water, and it was very doubtful when we might find any
more. Six hundred miles miles of country had to be traversed before I could hope
to obtain the slightest aid or assistance of any kind, whilst I knew not that a single
drop of water or an ounce of flour had been left by these murderers frem a stock that
had previously been so small.
Their small store of flour had indeed been the incentive to this horrible deed.
The two natives had taken with them all the flour and water they could carry, and
the double-barrelled guns of Mr. Eyre and the overseer, leaving behind them only a
brace of pistols and a rifle, which had a ball fast in the breech, and was useless for
the time. The encampment showed that they had laid their plan for murdering the
overseer over-night; but, as the country round is entirely destitute of food, it is
most probable that they perished as soon as their stock of flour was exhausted.
After obtaining possession, continues Mr. Eyre, of all the remaining arms, useless as
they were at the moment, with some ammunition, I made no examination then, but
hurried away from the fearful scene, accompanied by the King George?s Sound
native, to search for the horses, knowing that if they got away now no chance what-
ever would remain of saving our lives. Already the wretched animals had wandered
to a considerable distance, and although the night was moonlight, yet the belts of
scrub intersecting the plains were so numerous and dense that for a long time we
could not find them. Having succeeded in doing so at last, Wylie and I remained
with them watching during the remainder of the night; but they were very
restless, and gave us a deal of trouble. With an aching heart, and in most painful
reflection, I passed this dreadful night, every moment appearing to be protracted to
an hour, and it seemed as if the day-light would never appear. About midnight the
wind ceased, and it became bitterly cold and frcsty. I had nothing on but a shirt
and a pair of trowsers, and suffered most acutely from the cold. To mental anguish
was now added intense boddy pain. Suffering and distress had well nigh overwhelmed
me, and life seemed hardly worth the effort necessary to prolong it. Ages can never
efface the horrors of this single night, nor would the wealth of the woild ever tempt
me to go through similar ones again.* With daylight Mr. Eyre and Wylie prepared
to hasten from this dreadful scene. There was not sufficient sand on the surface of
the lime stone to bury the body of the overseer, and nothing remained but to wrap
his blanket around it. The sheep had all been consumed, or perished on the journey.
Forty pounds of flour was now their only stock of provisions, and, abandoning every-
thing else save his charts and papers. Mr. Eyre hurried from the spot with his
solitary attendant Wylie. The two natives again appeared before starting, and made
efforts to gain over Wylie, but they could not be induced to speak to Mr. Eyre, and
after a short time they disappeared in the desert.
The two travellers were now obliged to live chiefly on their horses, curing the flesh
in the sun, and carrying on a sufficient quantity for some days? consumption. They
were enabled to gain access to the sea shore, where they occasionally caught a
stingray fish. At length, when human nature threatened to sink under such long
continued fatigue and exposure, and to reach the settlement at King George?s Sound,
now close at hand, appeared beyond their strength, a whaling barque was sighted off
the coast. Here is an interposition of a Kind Providence ! On perceiving their
signals, the commander, Captain Rossitor, of the French whaling ship Mississippi,
sent off a boat for them, hospitab y entertained them as long as they chose to remain
on board, and when they girded up their loins to depart, he clothed them anew and
supplied them with provisions of every description that the stores of his vessel could
supply. Three weeks after quitting this marine Samaritan, Eyre reached the town-
ship of Albany, Kirg George?s Sound, July, 1841, after an absence of over twelve
months from Adelaide ?an eventful year indeed to him. This immense journey
places beyond question the astonishing fact that a sea-board 1500 miles long, from
* Eyer, Yol. 11.


Spencer Gulf to King George?s Sound, does not add one drop of water to the
ocean. How the drainage of the immense district to the north of this coast is con-
ducted, remains as jet unknown. . ri , .
Passing over many min or expeditions! have now to take up the narrative of Captain
Sturt?s exploration of the great central desert; ?a narrative of surpassing interes ,
the incidents of which are so well and graphically told, that one lingers over the oo ,
enchained by a fascination which few romancists have succeeded in exciting in eir
readers. In the month of August, 1844, after a repose of more than 14 years Sturt
again entered upon the field of discovery. His party numbered 15, officers and men,
and 2 natives, with 11 horses, 30 bullocks, 200 sheep, and 6 dogs. He was also pro-
vided with drays and a boat, which he fondly hoped to launch on the waters of that
inland sea, which was still believed to exist in the interior. The expedition, starting
from Adelaide, made for the Murray, and followed that river to the junction ol the
Darling. Proceeding along the banks of the latter stream till he arrived at a chain
of water-holes called Laidley?s Ponds, to a depot near the Mount Poole Ranges, ever-
more to be known as the ? Depot Prison.? Sturt and his men removed on the -7
of January, 1845. The two native guides, indeed, quitted their white friends when
the expedition started from Laidley?s Ponds, fearing to proceed further into a coun ly
where they fully expected that all would perish. But the hearts of the traveller s
were of sterner stuff; and, indeed, in the terrible journey before them no small de-
gree of heroism was necessary to carry them on. Plunging boldly into those awtu
solitudes, which even the savage instinctively dreaded to approach, Sturt and his
comrades strove to solve the great mystery of Central Australia. There in t a
solitary glen-?remote from civilization, and apart from all human aid, those brave
men were imprisoned until the 17th of July following a period of nearly six mont is.
Everywhere around them lay the impenetrable desert. To the east and to the west,
to the north and to the south, they turned alike in vain. Every attempt to escape
was unsuccessful, for in every direction their progress was checked by that most in-
surmountable of all barriers ?the entire absence of water. ?It was not, however,
says Sturt, ? until after we had run down every creek in our neighborhood, and had
traversed the country in every direction, that the truth flashed across my mind, and
it became evident to me, that we were locked up in the desolate and heated region,
into which we had penetrated, as effectually as if we had been wintered at the pole.
It was long, indeed, ere I could bring myself to believe that so great a misfortune
had overtaken us, but so it was?Providence had, in its all-wise purposes, guided us
to the only spot, in that wide-spread desert, where our wants could have been per-
manently supplied; but had there stayed our further progress into a region that
almost appeared to be forbidden ground.? (Yol. 1. pp 264-5 ) The heat during
their detention at this depot was terrible. The thermometer sometimes rose to 157
in the sun, and the mean for the months of December, January, and February was
101 �, 104 � , and 101 respectively, in the shade. Under its effects every screw was
drawn from the boxes ; and the horn bandies of their instruments, as well as their
combs, were split into fine laminae. The lead dropped out of pencils ; the signal-
rockets were entirely spoiled. Their hair, and the wool on the sheep, ceased to grow,
and their nails became as brittle as glass. The flour lost more than eight per cent,
of its original weight, and the other provisions in a still greater proportion. ihe
bran in which the bacon had been packed was perfectly saturated, and weighed
almost as much as the meat. The wax candles were only preserved by being buried;
a bottle of citric acid became fluid; and it was difficult to write or draw, so rapidly
did the fluid dry in the pens and brushes. (Pp. 305-6.) The result ot ail this, and
of the constant exertion to which Sturt and his officers subjected themselves, was an
attack of scurvy, from which, however, the men?who with characteristic consider-
ation had been less exposed and better fed?were entirely exempt. The moment of
their liberation at length arrived; but a sad incident had yet to be recorded ere they
finally quitted the depot. Mr. Poole died, and was buried under a tree near the
depot ? ? his initials and the year are cut in it above his grave, and he now sleeps in
the lonely desert.? Pushing on through a barren and dreary region, they at length


came to a box-forest, and began to hope that a compensating change was at hand.
But suddenly a wall of sand, such as they had not before seen, arose before them,
and for twenty miles they toiled ? over as distressing a country as can well be
imagined,? the sand ridges becoming even more steep and rugged, and only ceasing
for a while in the vicinity of dry salt lagoons, to commence again beyond them. ?It
is a remarkable fact,? Sturt writes, ? that here, on the northern side of the desert,
and after an open space of more than fifty miles, the same ridges should occur, run-
ning in parallel lines, at the same angle as before, into the veiy heart of the interior,
as if they absolutely were never to terminate. * * * It struck
me then, and calmer reflection confirms the impression, that the whole of the low
interior I had traversed was formerly a sea-bed, since raised from its sub-marine
position, by natural though hidden causes.? Undeterred by the aspect of the Sandy
Desert, Sturt pushed on, and in a box-tree forest was saluted by the notes of a host
of birds, cockatoos, parrots, pigeons, and crows. Following up a creek to the north-
ward he discovered a magnificent channel, exceeding two hundred yards in width,
with banks from fifteen to eighteen feet high, and having many splendid sheets of
water. This was afterwards named Cooper?s Creek, in honor of Judge Cooper, of
South Australia. On the 19th January, 1846, the gallant wanderer and his brave
companions returned to the abodes of civilized man, having been 19 months in the
Wild Bush.
That eminent Explorer, who revealed one colony and discovered the most impor-
tant rivers of two others, has exhibited that fearlessness of danger, that love of
enterprise, and that benevolence of disposition which has no less endeared him to
the savage men of the forest than to his own admiring countrymen. Few men, in
their passage through life, have enjoyed more real happiness. To the pleasures of a
widely spread and affectionate friendship, he added the charms of one of the most
joyous homes ; and I think you will all unite with me in wishing the Worthy Veteran
may long live toen joy the pension awarded him by the colonists of South Australia.
Omitting the expeditions of Messrs. Caley, Lawson, Blaxland, Grey, Cunningham,
Gregory, poor Kennedy, Goyder. Babbage, and others, I have now to take ip the
trave's of that enthusiastic martyr to science, whose fate is involved in a mystery
apparently more unfathomable than that of the desert itself. I refer to Dr. Ludwig
Leichhardt. Accompanied by six Europeans?one of them a lad on y sixteen years
of age?an American negro, and two aborigines. Leichhardt started from Brisbane
in August 1844. The avowed object of this expedition was to discover an overland
route to Port Essington, where the British Government had formed a settlement,
which was shortly afterwards abandoned with even less reason than induced its for-
mation. In this object Leichhardt was entirely successful. Keeping near the coast
line, he travelled for the most part through a well-grassed and plentifully watered
country, discovering in his progress many fine rivers, as the Mackenzie, the Burdekiu
the Lynd, the Gilbert, and others. Near the Gulf of Carpentaria, one of the party, a
Mr. Gilbert was killed. This is the one tragic incident of the journey ; but for which
theaccountof tbeexplorationwouldread more Lkethatof a naturalist?s pleasant ramble
in the bush, than the relation of an enterprise of great pith and moment?which it un-
doubtedly was. The seashore was reached in July, 1845, and the party followed round
the head of the Gulf and across Arnheim?s Land to Port Essington, which they reached
on the following December, having been sixteen months in the wild bush. A vessel
happening to touch at the port shortly after, Leichhardt and his brave companions
availed themselves of the opportunity of returning to Sydney in her. But there is a
restlessness of nature inherent in your true traveller, which ever impels him to seek
for new discoveries. Accordingly, in 1848, Leichhardt again started into the wilder-
ness, intent on exploring the interior of Australia, across which he hoped to force a
passage to the western or north-western coast. The time which he calculated as
necessary for the performance of this journey was two years and a half; but fourteen
years have passed away, yet the traveller has not reappeared, neither has any certain
vestige of him ever been discovered. The sandy ramparts of the desert have long
closed around him, his men his mules, his horses, his goats, and his oxen. We can no


longer doubt that they have all perished in the remote wilderness, the sad victims of
a fate which frail humanity shudders to contemplate ; ?their last sufferings unwit-
nessed, and their dying groans unheard, save by the eye and the ear of Omniscience,
and in all probability their bones now lie bleaching in some howling and untenanted
waste. .
I will now, for a few brief moments, invite your attention to a most brilliant
enterprise connected with Australian exploration. Amongst the companions of Sturt
in his memorable attempt to cross the desert of Central Australia, there was one who
has since then equalled his former leader in daring, and who, with a larger measure of
success, has traversed this great island from the southern to the northern shore. I
refer to John M?Douall Stuart, whose valuable discoveries and recent exploits have
inseparably linked his name with those of the Sturts and Livingstones, and Denhams
of modern times?men to whom the world owes no slight meed of gratitude. In
1858-9 Stuart explored and opened up for settlement a fine and generally well-grassed
country, situated to the W. and N.W. of the settled districts of South Australia. In
March, 1860, when about a month from Chambers?s Station, and just beyond the
borders of South Australia, he observed a remarkable hill, ? having the appearance
of a locomotive engine with its funnel,? and forcing his way over high red sandhills,
covered with tall spinifex, through which the horses could scarcely pass, he approached
this freak of nature, and found it to be a pillar of sandstone, 105 feet high, 20 feet
wide, and ten feet thick, and standing on a hill upwards of 100 feet in height. This
he named Chambers? Pillar, in honor of his warm friend, and the promoter of all his
expeditions. Shortly after he crossed the MacDonnell Ranges, and on the 22nd of
April he found himself in the centre of the continent?in long. 133� 30? and lat.
24 �. About 2i miles from this point a mountain described by himself as being
? as high as Mount Serle, if not higher,? was named by him ?Central Mount Stuart.?
Climbing to its summit, he built thereon a cone of stones, and ? in the centre of the
cone (he says) I placed a pole, with the British flag nailed to it.? This same flag had
been wrought by the fair fingers of a lady (of whom I only know that her name is
Esther), for the very purpose to which the gallant traveller now devoted it, with as
much honest pride (we may be sure) as ever conquering hero felt when his flag was
hoisted at the enemy?s mast head. ?At the top of the cone,? continues Stuart, ? I
placed a small bottle, in which is a slip of paper stating by whom it was raised. We
(Kekwick and himself) then gave three cheers for the flag ! ? What a picture is here
presented to us ! Two lonely white men, on a hill, in the vast wilderness of central
Australia, saluting, with a genuine British ?Hip! hip! hurrah!? their national
banner, planted there, for the first time, by their own brave hands. In after times
the artistic delineation of this event will fitly take its place in the same gallery with
those of the greatest geographical discoveries. Every colonist is aware of his recent
successful exploits ; having done more than any Explorer living.
I will conclude by stating that the labor and patience required, and the difficulties
which the first settlers encountered, must have been incalculable. But their success
has been complete ; it is the very triumph of human skill and industry over nature
herself. The corn-field and the orchard have supplanted the wild grass, and the
bush; flourishing towns stand on the then wilds of the forest; the lowing of herds
has succeeded the wild whoop of the savage, and the stillness of our once desert
shores is now broken by the sound of the bugle and the busy hum of commerce?by
the enterprising sons of that Little Island, far away in the North Sea, which we
proudly call our home.


KING?S NARRATIVE.
Mr. Burke, Mr. Wills, and I, reached the dep6t at Cooper?s Creek, on April 21st,
about half-past seven in the evening, with two camels?all that remained of the six Mr.
Burke took with him. All the provisions we then had consisted of a pound and a half
of dried meat. We found the party had gone the same day, and looking about for any
mark they might have left, found the tree with DIG, April, 21. Mr. Wills said the
party had left for the Darling. We dug, and found the plant of stores. Mr. Burke took
the papers out of the bottle, and then asked each of us whether we were able to proceed
up the creek in pursuit of the party. We said not; and be then said he thought it his
duty to ask us, but that he himself was unable to do so, but that he had decided upon
trying to make Mount Hopeless, as he had been assured by the committee in Melbourne
that there was a cattle station within 150 miles of Cooper?s Creek. Mr. Wills was not
inclined to follow this plan, but wished to go down our old track, but at last gave in to
Mr. Burke s wishes. I also wished to go down our old track. We remained four or
five days to recruit, making preparations to go down the creek by stages of four or five
miles a day, and Mr. Burke placed a paper in the plant, stating? what were our plans.
T ravelling down the creek, we got some fish from the natives, and, some distance down,
one of the camels (Landa) got bogged, and although we remained there that day and
part of the next trying to dig him out, we found our strength insufficient to do so. The
evening of the second day, we shot him as he lay, and, having cut off as much meat as
we could, we lived on it while we stayed to dry the remainder. Throwing all the least
necessary things away, w r e made one load for the remaining camel (Rajah), and each of
us carried a swag of about 251b. We were then tracing down the branches of the creek
running S, but found that they ran out into earthy plains. We had understood that the
creek along Gregory?s track was continuous; and finding that all these creeks ran out
into plains, Mr. Burke returned, our camel being completely knocked up. We then
intended to give the camel a spell for a few days, and to make a new attempt to push
forty or fifty miles to the south, in the hope of striking the creek. During the time that
the camel was being rested, Mr. Burke and Mr. Wills went in search of the natives, to
endeavour to find out how the nardoo grew. Having found their camp, they obtained as
much nordoo cake and fish as they could eat, but could not explain that they wished to
be shown how to find the seed themselves. They returned on the third day, bringing
some fish and nardoo cake with them. On the following day the camel Rajah seemed
very ill, and I told Mr. Burke I thought he could not linger more than four days; and,
as on the same evening the poor brute was on the point of dying, Mr. Burke ordered him
to be shot. I did so, and we cut him up with two broken knives and a lancet. We
cured the meat, and planted it; Mr. Burke then made another attempt to find the
nardoo, taking me with him. We went down the creek, expecting to find the natives at
the camp where they had last been seen, hut found that they had left; and not knowing
whether they had gone up or down the creek, we slept in their gunyahs that night, and
on the following morning returned to Mr. Wills. The next day Mr. Burke and I started
up the creek, but could see nothing of them, and were three days away, when we returned
and remained three days in the camp with Mr. Wills. We then made a plant of all the
articles we could not carry with us, leaving 51b of rice and a quantity of meat, and then
followed up the creek to where there were some good native huts. We remained at that
place a few days, but finding that our provisions were beginning to run short, Mr. Burke
said that we ought to do something, and that if we did not find the nardoo, we should
starve, and that he intended to save a little dried meat and riee to carry us to
Mount Hopeless. The three of us then came to the conclusiou that it would be better
to make a second attempt to reach Mount Hopeless, as we were then as strong as we
were likely to be, our daily allowance being reduced. Mr. Burke asked each of
us whether we were willing to make another attempt to reach the South Australian
settlements, and we decided on going. We took with us what remained of the
provisions we had planted?two and a-half pounds of oatmeal, a small quantity
of flour, and the dried meat ?this with the powder and shot, and other small
articles, made up our swags to 301b. each, and Mr. Burke carried one billy of water, and


I another. We had not gone far before we came on a flat, where I saw a plant growing
which I took to be clover, and, on looking closer, saw the seed, and called out that I
had found the nardoo. They were very glad when I found it. We travelled three days
and struck a watercourse coming south from Cooper?s Creek. We traced this, as it
branched out and reformed on the plains, until we lost it in the flat country. Sandhills
were in front of us, for which we made, and travelled all day, but found no water. We
were all greatly fatigued, as our rations now consisted of only one small johnny cake
and three sticks of dried meat daily. We camped that evening about four o?clock,
intending to push next day until two o?clock p.m., and then, should we not find water,
to return. We travelled and found no water, and the three of us sat down and rested
for an hour, and then turned back. We all felt satisfied that, had there been a few days?
rain, we could have got through. We were then, according to Mr. Wills?s calculation
forty-five miles from the creek. We travelled on the day we turned back very late, and
the following reached the nearest water at the creek. We gathered some nardoo, and
boiled the seeds, as we were unable to pound them. The following day we reached the
main creek; and knowing where there was a good water hole and native gunyahs, we
went there, intending to save what remained of our flour and dried meat for the purpose
of making another attempt to reach Mount Hopeless. On the following day, Mr. Wilis
and I went out to gather nardoo, of which we obtained a supply sufficient for three days;
and finding a pounding-stone at the gunyahs, Mr. Burke and I pounded the seed, which
was such slow work that we were compelled to use half flour and half nardoo. Mr.
Burke and Mr. Wills then went down the creek for the remainder of the dried meat
which we had planted, and we had now all our things with us, gathering nardoo, and
living the best way we could. Mr. Burke requested Mr. Wills to go up the creek as far
as the depot, and to place a note in the plant there, stating that we were then living on
the creek, the former note having stated that we were on our road to South Australia.
He also was to bury there the field-books of the journey to the Gulf. Before starting he
got 81b. of flour and 41b. of pounded nardoo, and about a pound of meat, as he expected
to be absent about eight days. During his absence I gathered nardoo and pounded it,
as Mr. Burke wished to lay in a supply in case of rain.
A few days after Mr. Wills left, some natives came down the creek to fish at some
water-holes near our camp. They were very civil to us at first, and offered us some fish;
on the second day they came again to fish, and Mr. Burke took down two bags, which
they filled for him; on the third day they gave us one bag of fish, and afterwards all
came to our camp. We used to keep our ammunition ana other articles in one gunyah,
and all three of us lived together in another. One of the natives took an oil-cloth out of
this gunyah, and Mr. Burke, seeing him running away with it, followed him with his
revolver, and tired over his head, and upon this the native dropped the oilcloth. While
he was away the other blacks invited me to a water-hole to eat fish, but I declined to do
so, as Mr. Burke was away, and a number of natives were about who would have taken
all our things. When I refused, one took his boomerang and laid it on my shoulder,
and then told nib, by signs, that if I called out for Mr. Burke, as I was doing, that he
would strike me. Upon this I got them all in front of the gunyah and fired a revolver
over their heads, but they did not seem at all afraid, until I got out the gun, when they
all ran away. Mr. Burke, hearing the report, came back, and we saw no more of them
until late that night, when they came with some cooked fish, and called out ? white
fellow.? Mr. Burke went out with his revolver, and found a whole tribe coming down,
all painted, and with fish in small netscarried by two men. Mr. Burke went to meet
them, and they wished to surround him, but he knocked as many of the nets of fish
out of their hands as he could, and shouted out to me to fire. I did so, and they ran
off. We collected five small nets of cooked fish. The reason he would not accept the
fish from them was, that he was afraid of being too friendly lest they should be always
at our camp. We then lived on fish until Mr. Wills returned. He told us that he had
met the natives soon after leaving us, and that they were very kind to him, and had
given him plenty to eat both on going up and returning. He seemed to consider that
he should have little difficulty in living with them, and as their camp was close to ours,
he returned to them the same day, and found them very hospitable and friendly, keeping


him with them two days, They then made signs to him to be off. He came to us and
narrated what had happened, but went back to them the following day, when they gave
him his breakfast, and made signs for him to go away. He pretended not to understand
them, and would not go, upon which they made signs that they were going up the creed
and that he had better go down. They packed up, and left the camp, giving Mr. Wills
a little nardoo to take to us.
During his absence, while Mr. Burke was cooking some fish, during a strong wind,
the flames caught the gunyah, and burned so rapidly that we were unable, not only to
put it out, but to save any of our things, excepting one revolver and a gun. Mr. Wills
being returned, it was decided to go up the creek and live with the natives, if possible,
as Mr. Wills thought we should have little difficulty in obtaining provisions from them
if we camped on the opposite side of the creek to them. He said he knew where they
had gone, and so we packed up and started. Coming to the gunyahs, where we expected
to have found them, we were disappointed, and seeing a nardoo field close by, halted,
intending to make it our camp. For some time we were employed gathering nardoo,
and laying up a supply. Mr. Wills and I used to collect and carry home a bag each
day, and Mr. Burke generally pounded sufficient for our dinner during our absence, but
Mr. Wills found himself getting very weak and was shortly unable to go out to gather
nardoo as before, nor even strong enough to pound it, so that in a few days he became
almost helpless. I still continued gathering; and Mr. Burke now also began to feel
very weak, and said he could be of very little use in pounding. I had now to gather
and pound for all three of us. I continued to do this for a few davs, but finding my
strength rapidly failing, my legs being very weak and painful, I was unable to go out fox-
several days, and we were compelled to consume six days? stock which we had laid by.
Mr. Burke now proposed that I should gather as much as possible in three days, and
that with this supply we should go in search of the natives?a plan which had been
urged upon us by Mr. Wills as the only chance of saving him and ourselves as well, as
he clearly saw that I was no longer able to collect sufficient for our wants. Having
collected the seed, as proposed, and having pounded sufficient to last Mr. Wills for eight
days, and two days for ourselves, we placed water and firewood within his reach, and
started. Before leaving him, however, Mr. Burke asked him whether he still wished it,
as under no other circumstances would he leave him; Mr. Wills again said that he
looked upon it as our only chance. He then gave Mr. Burke a letter and his watch for his
father, and we buried the remainder of the field-books near the gunyah. Mr. Wills then
said that, in case of my surviving Mr. Burke, he hoped that I would carry out his last
wish in giving the watch and letter to his father.
In travelling the first day, Mr. Burke seemed very weak, and complained of great pain
in his legs and back. On the second day he seemed to be better, and said that he
thought he was getting stronger, but, on starting, did not go two miles before he said he
could go no further. I persisted on his trying to go on, and managed to get him along
sevex-al times, until I saw that he was almost knocked up, when he said he could not
carry his swag, and threw all he had away. I also reduced mine, taking nothing but a
gun some powder and shot, and a small pouch and some matches. On starting again,
we did not go far before Mr. Burke said we should halt for the night, but, as the place
was close to a large sheet of water, and exposed to the wind, I prevailed on him to go a
little further, to the next reach of water, where we camped. We searched about, and
found a few small patches of nardoo, which I collected and pounded, and, with a crow
which I shot, made a good evenings? meal. From the time we halted Mi-. Burke seemed
to be getting worse, although he ate his supper. He said he felt convinced he could not
last many hours, and gave me his watch, which he said belonged to the committee, and
a pocket-book to give to Sir William Stawell, and in xvhich he wrote some notes. He
then said to me, ? I hope you will remain with me here till I am quite dead; it is a
comfort to know that some one is by; but when I am dying, it is my wish that you
should place the pistol in my right hand, and that you leave me unburied as I lie.?
That night he spoke very little, and the following morning I found him speechles, or
nearly so; and about eight o?clock he expired. I remained fora few hours there, but as I
saw there was no use in remaining longer, I went up the creek in search of the natives.


I felt very lonely, and at night usually slept in deserted wurleys, belonging to the natives.
Two days after leaving the spot where Mr. Burke died, I found some gunyahs, where
the natives had deposited a bag of nardoo, sufficient to last me a fortnight, and three
bundles containidg various articles. I also shot a crow that evening, but was in great
dread that the natives would come and deprive me of the nardoo.
I remained there two days, to recover my strength, and then returned to Mr. Wills. I
took back three crows; but found him Iving dead in his gunyah, and the natives had
been there and taken away some of his clothes. I buried the corpse with sand,
and remained there some days; but finding that my stock of nardoo was running short,
and being unable to gather it, I tracked the natives who had been at the camp by their
footprints in the sand, and went some distance down the creek, shooting crows and
hawks, on the road. The natives, hearing the report of the gun, came to meet me, and
took me with them to their camp, giving me nardoo and fish. They took the birds I
had shot and cooked them for me, and afterwards showed me a gunyah, where I was to
sleep with three of the single men. The following morning they commenced talking to
me, and putting one finger on the ground, and covering it with sand, at the same time
pointing up the creek, saying. ? Wbitefellow,? which I understood to mean that one
white man was dead. From this I knew that they were the tribe who had taken Mr.
Wills?s clothes. They asked me where the third white man was, and I also made the
si<m of putting two fingers on the ground and covering them with sand, at the same time
pointing up the creek. They appeared to feel great compassion for me when they
understood that I was alone on the creek, and gave me plenty to eat. After being four
days with them, I saw they were becoming tired of me, and they made signs that they
were <ming up the creek, and that I had better go downwards ; but I pretended not to
understand them. The same day they shifted camp, and I followed them; and, on
reaching their camp, I shot some crows, which pleased them so much that they made
me a breakwind in the centre of their camp, and came and sat round me until such time
as the crows were cooked, when they assisted me to eat them. The same day, one of
the women, to whom I had given part of a crow, came and gave me a ball of nardoo,
saving that she would give me more only she had such a sore arm that she was unable
to "pound. She showed me a sore on her arm, and the thought struck me that I would
boil some water in the billy and wash her arm with a sponge- During the operation the
whole tribe sat round, and were muttering one to another. Her husband sat down by
her side, and she was crying all the time. After I had washed it, I touched it with
some nitrate of silver, when she began to yell and ran off, crying out, ?Mokow!
mokow ! ? (Fire! fire!) From this time she and her husbsnd used to give me a small
quantity of nardoo both night and morning, and whenever the tribe were about going on
a fishing excursion, he used to give me notice to go with them. They also used to assist
me in making a gourley, or breakwind, whenever they shifted camp. I generally shot a
crow of a hawk, and gave it to them in return for these little services. _ Every four or
five days the tribe would surround me, and ask whether I intended Agoing up or down
the creek; at last I made them understand that if they went up I should go up the creek,
and if they went down I should also go down, and from this time they seemed to look
upon me as one of themselves, and supplied me with fish and nardoo regularly. They
were anxious, however, to know where Mr. Burke lay; and one day when we were
fishing in the waterholes close by I took them to the spot. On seeing the remains the
whole party wept bitterly, and covered them with bushes. After this they were much
kinder to me than before; and I always told them that the white men would be here
before two moons; and in the evenings, when they came with nardoo and fish, they
used to talk about the ? whitefellows ? coming, at the same time pointing to the moon.
I also told them they would receive many presents, and they constantly asked me for
tomahawks, called by them ? Bomayko.? From this time to when the relief party
aiT i ve( j a period of about a month ?they treated me with uniform kindness, and looked
upon me as one of themselves. The day on which I was released, one of the tribe who had
been fishing came and told me that the whitefellows were coming, and the whole of the
tribe who were then in camp sallied out in every direction to meet the party, while the
man who had brought the news took me across the creek, where I shortly saw the party
coming down.
