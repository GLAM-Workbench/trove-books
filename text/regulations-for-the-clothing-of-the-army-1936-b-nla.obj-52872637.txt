REGULATIONS FOR THE CLOTHING
OF THE ARMY
These regulations are Issued for the guidance of all
concerned. They will be interpreted reasonably and
with due regard to the public service. Any local
Instructions that may be issued will be guided and
directed by the spirit and intention of these regulations.
No attempt has been made to legislate for exceptional
cases, or for special circumstances, which will be dealt
with intelligently on their merits as they arise.
GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
1. All articles of clothing and necessaries used by a soldier
will be obtained from the R.A.O.C. unless otherwise provided
for in these regulations: they are classified under three
headings, viz :
Personal Clothing (Scales 1 to 8).
Necessaries (Scale 9).
Public Clothing (Unit—Scales 1 to 7, 10 to 12).
(Station —Scales 13 and 14).
Personal clothing comprises such uniform articles as service
dress caps, jackets and trousers, ankle boots, etc. This
clothing is normally struck off charge on issue and is regarded
as personal to the man, although he has no absolute right of
property therein ( see Chapter III).
Necessaries comprise such incidental articles as drawers,
shirts, brushes, etc. These articles are also normally struck
off charge on issue and regarded as personal to the man ( see
Chapter IV).
Public clothing consists of all other clothing, and on issue
is retained on ledger charge. It is sub-divided into :
(a) Unit public clothing, which is held on unit’s ledger
charge and is issued either generally for retention


during the term of the man’s service ( e.g. great-
coats), or to certain personnel only for special
purposes (e.g. motor cyclists’ clothing).
(b) Station public clothing, which comprises articles held
on charge by the officer i/c barracks and issued on
inventory for the use of specific services, articles
held on armament charge by officers i/c armament
sub-districts, and also articles held on " articles-
in-use ” charge in ordnance depots.
2. Articles which are issued in more than one size aie
described as follows :
(a) Stock size garments, boots, etc.—those made to
standard ranges of sizes (see App. 6).
i>) Special size garments, boots, etc. —those made to
measurements shown on special size roll (A.F.
H 1119) to fit men of peculiar build who cannot be
fitted from stock sizes.


CHAPTER I
DUTIES OF OFFICERS, CONDUCT OF CORRE-
SPONDENCE, ETC.
3. G.Os.C.-in-C. are responsible that the units in their
commands maintain the authorized quantities of clothing and
necessaries, and that the clothing records and books are
properly posted up. Any delay in supply will be reported
to the War Office. G.Os.C.-in-C. are also responsible for the
efficient custody and turnover of the clothing and necessaries
stored for reservists.
4. In cases of urgency local purchases of articles of authorized
scale and pattern required for the troops but not available
in store, e.g. plain clothes for men due for discharge or transfer
to the Army Reserve or, at stations abroad, boots and shoes
of abnormal dimensions, may be sanctioned by G.Os.C.-in-C.
up to a limit of £5. The prices paid should ordinarily not
exceed those laid down in the current Vocabulary of Clothing
and Necessaries and the articles will be examined and brought
to account as laid down in para. 385.
5. At stations abroad, in cases of urgent necessity, G.Os.C.
will provide for the requirements of the public service and
immediately report their action to the Under-Secretary of
State (M.G.0.7), The War Office.
6. A C.O. is responsible that the clothing and necessaries of
the soldiers under his command are serviceable and complete
to scale, and that all clothing and boots are carefully fitted in
the presence of the O.C. company, etc. It is of the utmost
importance to ensure that each soldier is at all times in posses-
sion of clothing, boots and necessaries in sufficiently good
condition to stand three months’ wear under service conditions.
A C.O. is also responsible that a sufficient stock of clothing
and necessaries is maintained in his unit’s store to meet three
months’ requirements (except as otherwise provided for on
change of station, etc.), and that this quantity is not exceeded;
also that this stock is properly cared for, and that articles
unlikely to be required are not retained. He will be responsible
for any deficiencies and for any loss arising from neglect of
these regulations.
7. Alterations, either for experiment or any other purpose,
of articles of clothing and necessaries involving any departure
13


from the sealed patterns are strictly forbidden without the
previous sanction of the War Office. The only alterations
allowed in articles which are issued by the R.A.O.C. are those
which are authorized in Chapter XIV to ensure a correct fit.
8. Soldiers will not be allowed to purchase articles of
personal clothing or necessaries from tradesmen, and will
not be required to obtain articles which are not sanctioned
by these regulations. In certain circumstances, as detailed in
Appendix 8, non-regulation articles may be provided subject
to no expense being incurred by army funds.
9. W.Os., N.C.Os. and men are forbidden to wear uniform
other than that of the pattern authorized for their substantive
rank or appointment. The wearing of unauthorized titles,
boots, caps, plaited lines, etc., by all ranks, is forbidden, as is
brown kid gloves by W.Os. Class 11, N.C.Os. and men.
Personnel holding acting, temporary or local rank may wear
the appropriate rank badges.
10. A return will be furnished by C.Os. to the D.A.D.O.S.
on 31st March each year, and more often, if necessary, of any
articles of clothing in store that are not likely to be wanted
for issue within 12 months, stating their sizes, when and in
what circumstances they were indented for, and whether they
are fit for issue as new. The D.A.D.O.S. will arrange as far
as possible for the transfer of the surplus articles of clothing
to other units in his area. If there is no outlet in the area for
the surplus articles, the D.A.D.O.S. will refer the question of
their disposal to the D.D.O.S.
Surplus articles will not be returned to the R.A.O.C. without
authority having been previously obtained from D.A.D.O.S.
as laid down in E.R., Part 1. Packages will be plainly
marked to facilitate identification and vouchers in triplicate
will be forwarded to the consignee the same day that the
articles are despatched.
11. All clothing returned to R.A.O.C. or transferred to other
units must, unless otherwise authorized, be of stock sizes,
not improperly altered or regimentally marked, free from
moth, and thoroughly fit for re-issue. The cost of carriage
will be charged against the C.O. for any articles that on
receipt are found not to conform to this standard.
12. On a change of command a regimental board will be
assembled (unless dispensed with under para. 373) to take stock
of the clothing and necessaries and to verify the ledger balances.
Both the incoming and outgoing C.Os., or their representatives,
will be present, and will sign the proceedings, which will be
certified as laid down in para. 373, and forwarded with the


regimental clothing ledger on transmission of the latter for
audit. When the officer taking over command does not arrive
until after the departure of the outgoing C. 0., the regimental
board will be assembled before the departure of the outgoing
officer, and the senior officer remaining with the unit will take
over and be responsible for the clothing and necessaries until
they are handed over by him to the officer taking over
command.
13. When a board is assembled under paras. 12, 100 or
207, the convening officer may, at his discretion, detail as a
member a W.O. or senior N.C.O. who is not directly concerned
with the accounting for, or the charge of, the articles on which
the report is required.
14. Where a difference of opinion exists between C.Os., On a
change of command or on the occasion of any transfer of
clothing or necessaries, as to the condition, quantity or
description of the articles to be transferred, application will
be made to the G.0.C.-in-C., by either of the officers between
whom the difference exists, for the assembly of a board to
consider and report on the matter.
15. C.Os. will bring to the notice of the G.0.C.-in-C. any
undue delay in the supply of clothing and necessaries. Com-
plaints as to the quality, cut or workmanship of clothing will
also be submitted to the G.0.C.-in-C., who, if he considers
a complaint well founded, will, after consulting other units
wearing similar articles, refer the matter to the War Office.
Submissions to the G.0.C.-in.C. will be accompanied by the
remarks of the D.A.D.O.S.
16. C.Os. are responsible for complying with the instructions
laid down in Appendix 14 as to the storage, inspection and
turnover of reservists’ kits, and the instructions laid down in
Appendix 15 for the issue of clothing and necessaries on
mobilization and on active service.
17. When units move from one home station to another,
C.Os. will carry out the instructions in Appendix 3.
18. Quarter-masters are responsible to their C.Os. for the
care and custody of all unissued articles. C.Os. will control
and supervise the duties with which quarter-masters are
charged, and will not, in any circumstances, permit them to
have direct dealings with soldiers respecting clothing or
necessaries.
19. Os.C. companies will indent on the prescribed A.Fs.
{see Appendix 1) for all articles of clothing and necessaries
required from the quarter-master’s store. Clothing and
15


necessaries will be issued by quarter-masters of units to Os.C.
companies and not direct to soldiers.
20. In no circumstances will articles of a new pattern be
taken into wear while stocks of obsolescent patterns are held
in store. Articles issued from store will be taken from the
oldest held on charge.
21. Correspondence relating to the supply of clothing or
necessaries, except as provided for in K.R., will be addressed
to the D.A.D.O.S. of the area, who will, if necessary, refer
the matter to the G.0.C.-in-C. or, if the question is of a
technical nature, to the C.1.5.C., Didcot.
22. No claim will be admitted for any clothing, necessaries,
or allowances, etc., relating to any period more than 12
months antecedent to the date of the claim, except in such
exceptional circumstances as may be approved by the Army
Council, or by an officer duly authorized by them.


CHAPTER II
INITIAL OUTFITS FOR RECRUITS
23. Until finally accepted by a regiment or corps, a recruit
will receive only such articles of personal clothing or necessaries
as are absolutely essential; articles so issued will be retained
on public charge and will not be regarded as a personal issue
to the recruit until he has been finally accepted (see para.' 25).
If the recruit is rejected, all articles which have been issued
will be withdrawn with the exception of a toothbrush and
razor blade, which may be retained by the man. Articles
withdrawn will be cleaned, washed or sterilized, as necessary,
at the public expense and held for re-issue to other recruits
awaiting acceptance. The circumstances of the issue of the
articles will fie shown on the vouchers striking off toothbrushes
and razor blades and also in support of charges for cleaning,
washing or sterilization of other articles issued under this
paragraph. When a recruit is sent to a unit or depot pending
final acceptance, any articles in his possession will be vouchered
in the normal manner, the clothing transfer statement (A.F.
H 1157) showing whether the articles were new or part worn
when issued.
24. A supply of greatcoats which have been condemned as
unserviceable will be allowed for each general recruiting
station for recruits proceeding to other stations. Condemned
greatcoats received with recruits will, if suitable, be retained
for issue to recruits enlisted for other corps, or forwarded
for further use to the nearest recruiting officer requiring them.
When unfit for further use by recruits, they will be disposed
of as laid down in Chapter VI. In the event of condemned
greatcoats not being available, greatcoats oi» the verge of
condemnation will be supplied.
25. When a recruit has been finally accepted, the O.C.
company will indent on the quarter-master for an initial
outfit of clothing and necessaries to complete to the appropriate
scales except for any articles withheld under paras. 26 and 36.
All personal clothing and necessaries included in the initial
outfit will be new and will be issued to the recruit free. Any
new articles that may have been issued under para. 23 will
be retained by the recruit as part of his initial outfit and finally
struck off ledger charge; part-worn articles so issued will be
withdrawn and dealt with as laid down in para. 23 for rejected


recruits, new articles being issued in replacement. New articles
of public clothing, however, will not be issued if part-worn
articles are available.
26. Recruits enlisted at stations abroad, other than in
India, for immediate transfer to the home establishment,
will, before embarkation, receive only such articles of personal
clothing and necessaries as are absolutely necessary, regard
being paid to the season of the year in which the recruit
embarks. The balance of articles required to complete to
the home scale will be issued free on the recruit’s arrival at
the home station, articles in possession which are surplus to
the home scale being withdrawn and disposed of to the best
advantage, the proceeds of sale being credited to the public.
27. The clothing of boys enlisted in India for immediate
transfer to the home establishment will be completed free
to the home scale on arrival, except that flannel drawers
and jerseys will be regarded as interchangeable with woollen
drawers and jerseys, pullover, respectively. . Articles of
clothing and necessaries in possession which are surplus to
the home scale (other than vests) will be withdrawn and
disposed of to the best advantage, the proceeds of sale being
credited to the public.
28. Boys enlisted at home stations to fill vacancies in units
serving abroad will, unless sent for training to the R.M.
School of Music, be supplied only with such articles of home
pattern as are necessary pending embarkation. The boys
will be credited with the value of any articles of home pattern
personal clothing withheld, and on embarkation will be dealt
with under Chapter IX.
29. Boys enlisted in the R.A. for training as artificers at
the Military College of Science will be clothed under Scale 5, and
any clothing allowance issued will be at dismounted rates
until they join the ranks on attaining 18 years of age.
30. Recruit# enlisted in the transport branch of the R.A.S.C.
will be clothed under Scale 5, men subsequently posted to the
animal transport branch being dealt with under paras. 179
and 180.
31. Prefects of the Duke of York’s Royal Military School
who enlist in the Regular Army will be treated for the purposes
of clothing as though they had been transferred from another
unit of the Regular Army, and will be dealt with under
paras. 179 and 180. (See also para. 129.)
•
32. Reservists who re-enlist, or rejoin from the Army
Reserve, and soldiers who re-enlist with a definite break in
their colour service, will be treated as recruits.
18


On extension of service or re-engagement, or on re-enlistment
when the service is continuous, or on transfer from the Royal
Marines, no free issues of clothing or necessaries will be made.
(See also para. 183.)
33. A free initial issue of regimental pattern buttons will
be made for each service dress jacket issued free to recruits
on enlistment, the buttons, Royal Arms, already on the jacket
being removed before issue and accounted for as laid down in
Appendix 2, para. 13. (See also para. 319.)
34. When considered desirable by Os.C. infantry depots,
one pair of boots issued to infantry recruits may be bobbed
at the public expense. The hobs (18 to 22 for each boot
according to the size of the boot) will be obtained from the
R.A.O.C. Charges for this service will be made on the A.F.
H 1179 on which the boots are struck off charge.
35. Overall clothing will be issued to recruits on enlistment
in accordance with Scale 8. In the case of men enlisted as
clerks into the R. Signals and R.A.S.C., any overalls required
during their recruit training will be issued as station public
clothing by the O.C. depot from the stocks specially authorized
to be held for the purpose.
36. Only such articles of the authorized scales of personal
and public clothing as the C.O. may consider necessary for
drill, parades, duties, and for walking out, will be issued to
recruits during the first three months of their service and the
remainder, subject to para. 275, on completion of three
months’ service. In units in receipt of full dress the full
dress head-dress will not be worn by a recruit for the first
three months.
37. A gymnastic kit consisting of two vests and one pair
of shorts will be issued free to each recruit for wear at physical
training, etc. The kits will be provided by C.Os. under regi-
mental arrangements and will not be accounted for in the
clothing ledger. The actual cost of the kit, not exceeding the
sum laid down in Army Orders, will be allowed to the unit
for each recruit to whom a free kit is supplied. The amount
recoverable from the public will be charged in the company
account, supported by a certificate, to be rendered to the
regimental paymaster monthly with A.F. H 1179, showing
the number of recruits to whom a free kit has been supplied
during the month.
38. In cases where it is considered necessary to issue a
second full dress tunic to a recruit of the Brigade of Guards
who has completed six months’ service but who has not
attained the first anniversary of his enlistment, the value of


the tunic so issued will not be charged to the man’s account
until the month in which clothing allowance becomes admis-
sible (except that, in the case of a recruit who is transferred
to another regiment, or is discharged or deserts before being
credited with the first issue of clothing allowance, the value
will be charged to his account prior to his transfer or discharge
or at the date of desertion). The rate charged for a tunic
issued under this paragraph will be the vocabulary rate in
force at the date on which the tunic is issued.
39. Public clothing, except jack spurs, in possession of
recruits on completion of training at a depot will be retained
in wear on posting to the service unit, provided that the articles
are in a thoroughly serviceable condition ; otherwise they
will be brought back to the depot by the conducting party.
Any expense for conveyance of such clothing will be charged
as directed in Allowance Regulations. Jack spurs will be
retained at the depot.


CHAPTER III
PERSONAL CLOTHING
{Scales 1 to 8)
40. After completion of the initial issue on enlistment,
issues of personal clothing will only be made on payment,
except as provided elsewhere in these regulations. Local
provision, subject to paras. 4 and 5, is forbidden except under
special War Office authority.
41. All new articles of personal clothing issued on payment
(including articles obtained by local purchase or made up
locally —see paras. 4,5, and 43) will be obtained from regi-
mental store and will be charged for at the vocabulary rate in
force at the date of the company indent.
42. A soldier has no absolute right of property in his personal
clothing, and such clothing will not be disposed of except as
laid down in these regulations.
43. At stations abroad, service dress or khaki drill garments
of special size or of the pattern authorized for W.Os., Class I,
may be obtained under local arrangements, provided that the
cost of materials, which must be supplied by the R.A.0.C.,
together with the local rate for making up, is not more than
25 per cent, in excess of the vocabulary rate for such garments.
44. The issue of clothing from store must not be other than
that authorized for the rank or appointment held by the
soldier who requires the articles.
45. Buttons, Royal Arms, will be removed from service
dress jackets before issue on payment from regimental store to
W.Os., Class 11, N.C.Os. and men, and accounted for as laid
down in Appendix 2, para. 13, unless they are actually
required by the soldier {see para. 33).
46. When a soldier has grown out of a garment and the
G.0.C.-in-C. is satisfied that the issue of a new garment has
become necessary solely from this cause, and that due allowance
was made, when fitting, as laid down in Appendix 7, the
unexpired wear value of the garment requiring replacement
will be assessed by the O.C. company, and will be credited
to the soldier, the new article required being issued on pay-
ment. The garment outgrown will be sold for the benefit of
the public.


47. If, before new articles in possession of a soldier have
been worn, any alteration takes place in his rank or appoint-
ment, or he is ordered to another station which involves a
change of uniform, the unworn articles (even if they have been
fitted and marked) may be returned to regimental store for
re-issue, and the value credited to the soldier, such credit
being supported by a reference to the voucher by which the
articles are again brought on ledger charge. Specially made
garments, or articles trimmed with gold lace, will be dealt
with at once as directed in para. 354.
48. When an article of personal clothing has become pre-
maturely unserviceable owing, in the opinion of the C. 0., to
inferior material or workmanship, the matter will be promptly
submitted to the G.0.C.-in-C., who, if he concurs in this
opinion, may authorize replacement by a new article to be
issued on payment at a reduced rate. This rate should be
assessed according to the estimated reduction in the normal
life of the unserviceable article. In doubtful cases the article
may be submitted with a report in quadruplicate to the
C.1.5.C., Didcot, for special examination before replacement is
approved. Articles so replaced will be disposed of to the
contractor for condemned clothing, the proceeds being credited
to the public.
Ankle boots will not be dealt with under this paragraph if
they have been in possession of the soldier for more than
three months, unless the circumstances are abnormal.
49. A soldier on promotion or reduction will be dealt with
as follows: —
(а) The alterations necessary in his uniform will be
effected at the public expense, provided that the
cost, including labour and any necessary chevrons
or badges, does not exceed half the value of the
new garment. If the cost is estimated to exceed
this, half the value of a new garment will be credited
to the soldier.
(б) Should the soldier prefer purchase of a new garment
to conversion of the one in his possession, the
amount for which the latter could have been
converted, but not exceeding half the value of the
new garment, may be credited to him, but the cost
of conversion will not be admissible when the gar-
ments differ only in quality of material.
(c) In other cases, when new articles are necessarily
required owing to difference of pattern or scale,
half their value will be credited, unless the
22


difference is due merely to change of station. In
the case of the Household Cavalry, on the promotion
of a soldier to a rank for which a different pattern
aiguillette is authorized, a credit of the full value
of the new pattern aiguillette will be made.
[d] Appointments to acting or temporary ranks will not,
for clothing purposes, be regarded as promotion,
except in respect of the issue of rank badges
[see para. 50).
[e) In the case of the Household Cavalry and Foot Guards,
a cap badge will be issued free on the promotion of
a soldier to a rank for which a different pattern
badge is authorized.
(/) A W. 0., Class I, promoted to that rank whilst serving
in India and subsequently posted to the Imperial
Establishment will be dealt with as provided in
para. 213 A.
50. One set of chevrons or badges of rank (other than
metal) required on appointment to lance rank, on promotion,
reduction, transfer, etc., will, when no other alterations
in pattern of clothing are necessary, be issued free for each
full dress tunic, service dress and khaki drill jacket included
in the scale. Two sets of metal badges for wear with service
dress and khaki drill clothing will be supplied free on appoint-
ment or promotion only.
51. A free initial issue of one set of good conduct badges
and badges denoting special qualifications ( e.g . skill-at-arms
and signalling badges) for each full dress tunic, service dress
and khaki drill jacket included in the scale will be made to
men on their becoming entitled to wear such badges under the
appropriate training manuals.
A free issue as personal clothing of two signal armlets will
be made on appointment to linemen and despatch riders of H.
Signals, to Signal N.C.Os., and to men of all arms employed as
despatch riders.
62. No soldier will be permitted to dispose of any article
of personal clothing without the written consent of the O.C.
company. When articles in possession of soldiers are no
longer required for wear, or for repairs, etc., they may, with
the written consent and under the direction of the O.C.
company, be sold or disposed of by gift to other soldiers in
the unit for their personal use, the proceeds of sale being
credited to the owner’s pay account. All such transactions,
whether by auction or otherwise, will be entered in A.B. 339,
and initialled by the O.C. company approving the sale or


purchase. Each entry will give the name of the buyer and
seller, and the price paid. Cash payments will be allowed
between soldiers not paid on a company pay list, and entries
in A.B. 339 will not in such cases be necessary.
53. Garments issued from regimental store will be complete
with embroidered (but not metal) badges and chevrons as
authorized in Appendix 5, unless such badges and chevrons
already in possession are in good condition, in which case they
will be transferred to the new garment. No addition to the
vocabulary rate for the garment will be made in respect of
such badges, etc., with which the garment is completed.
54. All issues of badges and chevrons other than those
provided for in paras. 50, 51 and 53 will be charged for at
vocabulary rates.
55. Articles no longer required which are not disposed of-
under para. 52 will be handed over to the quarter-master
by the O.C. company (who will obtain a receipt for them) for
disposal as in Chapter VI. Such clothing will be thoroughly
examined and the pockets emptied before disposal. Badges
and buttons will be previously removed and retained by the
wearers, care being taken not to mutilate the garments.
56. At the time the clothing is handed in by the soldier for
disposal, the O.C. company will pay to the soldier its worn-out
value as laid down in para. 57, for which purpose he may use
public money in his possession. Until the value of the
clothing is received from the contractor, the money advanced
for this purpose may be shown in the balance sheet at Form 5
of the company account as “ Cash due from contractor for
condemned clothing ”.
57. Payments to the men in respect of complete articles
handed into regimental store for disposal will not be in excess
of the amounts to be received from the contractor for con-
demned clothing ; on no account will any charge in respect of
the disposal of personal clothing or necessaries be allowed to
fall on public funds, except as provided in para. 110. Articles
not complete will only be paid for at rag value. In assessing
amounts payable to men in respect of personal clothing or
necessaries disposed of as rags, the value of the articles will
be based on the weights of the smallest sizes of worn articles,
any surplus cash that may accrue on this account being
credited to regimental funds. At home stations, the rates for
condemned and worn-out clothing and necessaries (including
rags) which are published periodically by Army Council
Instruction will be taken as a guide in assessing amounts
payable to the men. The value of personal clothing and


necessaries received from the contractor will be distributed
under regimental arrangements to Os.C. companies, who will
keep an account of the receipt and disposal of the sums so
received.
58. Part-worn personal clothing of fion-efiective soldiers
may be sold in the unit at not less than the rates for worn-out
clothing or disposed of as laid down in para. 55, the proceeds
being dealt with as directed in para. 262 and Chapter XII.
59, Except as directed in Chapter VI, clothing will not
be sold to any civilian other than the recognized contractor
for condemned clothing, and it will be explained to the men
that contract rates only will be paid. A list of the prices
payable for worn-out clothing either as complete garments
or as rags will be hung up in barrack rooms.


CHAPTER IV
NECESSARIES
(Scale 9)
60. After completion of the initial issue on enlistment,
issues of necessaries will only be made on payment, except
as provided elsewhere in these regulations.
61. Necessaries for issue on payment will be supplied from
public store and will be charged for at the vocabulary rates in
force at the date of the company indent; local provision,
subject to paras. 4 and 5, is forbidden, except under special
War Office authority.
62. Regimental institutes may obtain from the quarter-
master’s stores a supply of necessaries for sale to soldiers only
(see Appendix 1, para. 4). Necessaries purchased by soldiers
from regimental institutes will be paid for in rash at
current vocabulary rates. Marking will be carried out under
regimental arrangements.
63. Except as provided in para. 62, necessaries will be
issued to soldiers in the presence of an officer ; any objections
to articles must be made before they are taken away from
the place of issue.
64. Necessaries required by small detachments at home or
abroad will, whenever possible, be obtained by the O.C. detach-
ment on payment from a unit at the same station.
65. Necessaries no longer required by the soldier may, if
he so desires, be disposed of under paras. 52, 55 and 56.
66. The identity discs included in Appendix 14 will be
issued on mobilization only. They will be stored, ready
marked and complete with the necessary cord, by the O.C.
unit in which the soldier is serving, and will be transferred
with him on his proceeding to another station either at home
or abroad (including India). On the soldier’s transfer to the
Army Reserve, the discs, complete with the necessary cord,
will be passed by the O.C. unit to the officer i/c records for
action as directed in Mobilization Regulations. Discs will
not be brought on charge in the regimental clothing ledgers,
and those of non-effectives will be destroyed. The No. 1
disc (green) will, when in wear, be suspended round the neck
beneath the uniform by 32 inches of cord, and the No. 2


disc (red) will hang below the No. 1, the two being joined by
6 inches of cord.
67. Identity discs for serving officers and members of
Q.A.I.M.N.S. will not be issued until mobilization, but will
be marked and held in store by units in peace. On change of
unit or station, the identity discs will accompany the duplicate
record of service (A.F. B 199 A).
In the case of officers of the Regular Army Reserve of
Officers, the discs will be held in peace unmarked at the place
of joining.
68. The Os.C. Netley and Millbank Hospitals and the
A.D.M.S., Woolwich, will satisfy themselves that all men
from abroad on leaving hospital are in possession of at least
one jersey, pullover, one shirt, angola, drab, one pair of woollen
or cotton drawers, and one pair of socks. Any of these
articles not in possession of the men will be issued from a
stock specially held for this purpose.
In the case of men invalided from Aden, Bermuda, Ceylon,
Jamaica, Mauritius and Singapore, a jersey, pullover, and,
in the case of dismounted men, a pair of woollen drawers,
will be issued free, provided that no free issue of these articles
had been made under para. 242. Such issues will be supported
by a certificate issue voucher, which, in the case of men
found unfit for further service, will be attached to A.F. H 1157,
as a voucher to the clothing ledger.
In all other cases, issues under this paragraph will be on
payment, credit being given in the account of the R.P.
concerned.
69. The necessaries of soldiers discharged on conviction of
felony will be sold, and the proceeds will be dealt with in
accordance with the regulations made under the Regijnental
Debts Act.


CHAPTER V
PUBLIC CLOTHING
(a) Unit Public Clothing
(Scales I to 7 and 10 to 12)
70. After completion of initial issues, unit public clothing
normally will only be replaced after condemnation by a regi-
mental board of survey (see para. 100). New articles will
not be issued if serviceable part-worn articles of suitable sizes
are available.
Deficiencies and damages will be dealt with under Chapter
XVI.
71. Articles in possession of soldiers will be kept clean and
in repair at their expense, except as otherwise provided for
in these regulations, and C.Os. will see that all repairs are
carried out without delay.
72. Articles of public clothing withdrawn from soldiers
(including non-effectives and the permanent staff of the
Territorial Army and Supplementary Reserve) must therefore
be in good condition. Cleaning and repair of such articles
will not be carried out at public expense unless (a) necessitated
by circumstances outside the soldiers’ control, or (b) required
on hygienic grounds to make the articles fit for re-issue.
Such articles will be re-issued at the first opportunity; if
there ig no outlet, they will be dealt with as in para. 10. The
soldier will also be charged with the value of articles which,
through circumstances within his control, are deficient or are
prematurely unserviceable (see also para. 341).
73. Public clothing issued from store will be supplied
complete with the authorized embroidered badges and
chevrons.
Badges and chevrons required on appointment or promotion
will be issued free. Any badges or chevrons obtained otherwise
will be charged for at vocabulary rates.
74. To avoid undue deterioration of serviceable cloaks,
greatcoats and capes, C.Os. will retain such numbers of those
condemned as they may consider necessary for wear on fatigues,
etc., and for second coats for drivers of mechanical vehicles,
and for tank and dragon crews, as laid down in Scale 10A.


The numbers so retained will be shown on the proceedings of
the board of survey which condemns them, and be entered
separately in the ledger.
If sufficient greatcoats for issue under Scale 10A are not
available from normal condemnations within the units con-
cerned, application should be made to D.A.D.0.5., who will
arrange for any greatcoats condemned by other units to be
transferred to meet such requirements instead of being
disposed of to the contractor for worn-out clothing.
75. Condemned greatcoats will be supplied for soldiers of
unsound mind at Netley, whenever the O.C. Royal Victoria
Hospital considers them necessary.
76. Articles outgrown by the wearers may be exchanged
for others of suitable sizes, those withdrawn being taken into
store for re-issue as required. Greatcoats taken by apprentice
tradesmen on posting to a service unit which are subsequently
withdrawn because outgrown will be returned for further
wear to the establishment from which the men were posted,
unless they can be utilized within the unit.
77. Metal helmets and bearskin caps will not be allowed in
excess of the establishment of a unit.
78. Full dress public clothing issued to units other than
Household Cavalry, Foot Guards, R.A. Bands, Aldershot and
Woolwich, and R.E. Band, will be worn only on those
occasions when the band parades without troops, e.g. playing
out, playing at mess, beating retreat, etc. Such clothing is
not authorized for stations abroad; before departure overseas
this clothing will be withdrawn and dealt with under instruc-
tions to be obtained from the C. 0.0., Woolwich Arsenal,
through the D.A.D.O.S.
79. Capes, cloaks, gauntlets and metal helmets and com-
ponents in possession of soldiers of the Household Cavalry,
aiguillettes for lance-corporals held as public clothing under
Scale 10, and busbies, bearskin caps and components, and
purses and belts, in possession of other soldiers, will be cleaned
and kept in repair at the public expense, provided that the
damage or deterioration is due to fair wear and tear.
80. Leather pantaloons and jack boots supplied to the
Household Cavalry will, after inspection by the C.I.S.C. as
to material and workmanship, be subject to inspection by the
C.O. as regards fitting. In the event of the fitting not being
satisfactory, the boots and pantaloons will be removed from
the regiments by, and at the expense of, the contractors and


will be replaced by fresh supplies to be delivered to the C.I.S.C.
Articles approved will be stamped by the C.I.S.C. (F.D.) with
the W|D mark, and by the regiment with the name of the
regiment and a consecutive number.
81. In February and September, the pantaloons and boots
will be inspected by Os.C. squadrons, and any requiring repair
or renewal will be brought before a regimental board of
survey, assisted by a representative of the C.I.S.C. The
report of the board will be forwarded to the C. 0.0., Woolwich,
with a statement of the probable cost of repair, and with an
indent for the replacement of articles condemned as unservice-
able. When approval has been given, the repairs will be
carried out. Condemned articles will, after replacement, be
disposed of as unserviceable, except that a stock of 20 pairs
of each may be kept in hand for the use of recruits, and
repaired at the public expense.
82. In September, all state clothing issued under Scale 11
will be inspected by a representative of the C.1.5.C., and
any repairs or replacements will be carried out. Articles
no longer required will be disposed of under instructions from
D.D.0.5., Woolwich, except that unserviceable kettledrum and
trumpet banners may be retained by the unit.
83. Repairs or replacements authorized at the periodical
inspections referred to in paras. 81 and 82 will be charged
against the public unless due to wilful damage or neglect,
when the cost will be recovered from the individual responsible.
Small intermediate repairs to the articles referred to in
paras. 80 and 82 will be carried out at the public expense,
at the discretion of the C. 0., provided that the damage is
due to fair wear and tear, and the charge will be included in
the pay list supported by the tradesman’s receipted bill and
the C.O’s. certificate that the repairs have been duly executed.
84. Colours, cases and belts of Foot Guards will be replaced
every 15 years (all battalions of a regiment at the same
time).
Colours, guidons, standards, etc., of other units which have
been in use the prescribed period (see Scale 12) will not neces-
sarily be replaced. When repair or replacement is eventually
considered necessary, the articles will be examined by a board
of survey, and, if repairable, the repairs will be carried out
regimentally and charged to the public, unless the cost is
estimated to exceed when authority must be obtained
from the C. 0.0., Didcot, before the expenditure is incurred.
Indents for new articles to replace those condemned by


the board will be forwarded to the C. 0.0., Didcot, accom-
panied by a copy of the proceedings of the board ; they will
show the appropriate date on which the new colours, etc.,
are to be presented. When the articles have not lasted the
prescribed period, a report of the circumstances in which
they became prematurely unserviceable will be forwarded
with the indents.
85. Drawings for colours, guidons and standards will be
furnished by the Inspector of Regimental Colours, who will
be the sole authority on all details appertaining to these
articles. The material, colour and dimensions of colours,
guidons and standards are shown in Appendix 9.
86. Arrangements will be made for new colours, guidons and
standards to be presented as soon as possible after receipt.
Old standards, guidons or colours remain the property of the
State after replacement, and should be deposited in some
church or other public building; they will not be otherwise
disposed of without War Office sanction, and in no circum-
stances will these articles be sold or allowed to pass into the
possession of any individual. G.Os.C.-in-C. will ensure that
proposals for the disposal of old colours, etc., are submitted
by the C.O. for the approval of the War Office; the date the
articles were actually laid up will subsequently be reported to
the War Office. Unserviceable belts for standards, guidons
or colours may, if desired, be retained by the unit, and struck
off charge on replacement.
87. Drum-majors’ staves and belts will not be replaced until
condemned as unserviceable by a board of survey; the
unserviceable articles may be retained and struck off ledger
charge on replacement; otherwise they will be returned to
the C. 0.0., Woolwich. They will not be disposed of outside
the unit. Indents will include the bag for the staff and cases
for the belt or staff if these are required.
88. Regimental animal transport drivers, men under
training as such, and N.C.Os. i/c thereof of dismounted
units, and grooms to mounted officers in dismounted units
for whom riding horses are allowed on the establishment, will
be clothed on the scale laid down for their respective services
and in addition will, on appointment, receive a free issue as
public clothing of the articles authorized by Scale 10A. These
men will continue to draw the rates of clothing allowance laid
down for their respective arms of the service. The additional
articles 'issued will be returned to store on conclusion of the


period of training or of employment as driver or groom
and will be dealt with as laid down in para. 72.
89. On a soldier’s death, the value of public clothing found
to be deficient or damaged, either wilfully or through careless-
ness, will not be charged on A.F. P 1954, unless the deficiency
or damage was discovered on his admission into hospital,
and there has been no settlement of accounts between his
admission and his death. If the death did not take place in
hospital, no charge will be made unless such deficiency or
damage was discovered immediately after death. Any entry
in A.F. P 1954, on account of deficient or damaged clothing,
will be supported by a certificate to the above effect, signed
by the O.C. company.
( b) Station Public Clothing
{Scales 13 and 14)
90. Articles of station public clothing will be issued as
laid down in Scales 13 and 14, or as may be otherwise
authorized, and will be held “ on inventory ”, as ‘‘ articles in
use ”, or on “ armament charge ”.
91. Arrangements for washing and repair of articles of
station public clothing will be made by the officer in whose
charge the articles are held, except that repairs to prison
clothing will be carried out as laid down in para. 257. Materials
for repair will be provided by the clothing depot supplying
the area. Condemned garments returned to store will be
utilized for repairs as far as possible, and the certificate of the
accounting officer that the garments have been expended in
repairs will be attached as a voucher to the account in which
the articles are struck off charge. When the washing and
repairing are performed under a contract, no materials for
repair will be issued.
92. Temporary issues of waterproof clothing to military
personnel for whom such clothing is not authorized under
Scales 10 and 13 may be authorized by the G.0.C.-in-C. to
meet temporary needs of an exceptional nature (see R.A.0.5.,
Part I, 1929, para. 537, regarding the record of such issues).
93. The following typical examples are considered to justify
such temporary issues :
(a) Men working in appreciable depth of water, e.g.
launching kapok bridges, cleaning out ditches.


(b) Signal personnel carrying out urgent repairs to wires
and cables in exposed places in inclement weather
(but only in such exceptional circumstances).
Such issues will not, however, be authorized solely on
account of the fact that the duties include an unusual amount
of outdoor work, since the greatcoat (or ground sheet) normally
gives sufficient protection in such cases. The following are
typical cases in which such issues will not be authorized • —-
Musketry range personnel.
Camp personnel.
Port or shipping personnel.
Orderly serjeant or corporal.
94. Permanent issues of waterproof clothing to military
personnel for whom such clothing is not authorized under
Scales 10 and 13 will in no circumstances be authorized without
prior War Office approval.
95. Magazine clothing will be issued only for use in such
bmldmgs as are under “ magazine conditions ”. Such issues
will be made as laid down in E.R., Part 2, in the case of R.A.
magazines and laboratories ; in all other cases, the issue will
be as required, normally consisting of a jacket, a pair of
trousers and a cap for each man, together with boots, shoes
etc., as necessary.
96. When an article other than magazine clothing issued
as station public clothing is lost, made away with or damaged
the rules for assessing charges laid down in paras. 341 or
342 will be followed.
97. Deficiencies of magazine clothing will be dealt with in
accordance with the rules laid down for equipment in E.R as
far as they are applicable. ' *
(c) Special Issues of Public Clothing
98. Special issues of public clothing for individual units
or establishments are not laid down in these regulations, but
are notified direct to the command or establishment con-
cerned.
99. A Consolidated Statement of Special Clothing Issues ”
showing all such authorized issues (including issues to civilian
employees under para. 307) which are not authorized by these
or other regulations (other than temporary issues of waterproof
clothing authorized by G.Os.C.-in-C. under paras. 92 and 308)
will be rendered every five years on the Ist March by each
command to the War Office (M.G.O. 76) for approval if still
considered necessary by the G.0.C.-in-C. The statement
2 (1175)


will be in triplicate and will show the following particulars in
tabular form ;
Col. I.'—Unit or establishment.
„ 2.—ltem.
„ 3. —Numbers held.
„ 4.—Personnel for which held.
„ 5.-—Purpose for which required.
~ 6.—Held as unit or station public clothing.
„ 7. —War Office authority (if any).
8.—Remarks.


CHAPTER VI
CONDEMNATION AND DISPOSAL OF UN-
SERVICEABLE CLOTHING AND NECESSARIES
(a) Condemnation
100. When articles of unit public clothing are reported as
unserviceable, they will be examined by a board of survey.
If considered fit for further wear, they will be repaired at
the expense of the soldier, except as otherwise provided
for in these regulations. If condemned, they will be replaced
at the public expense, provided that in the opinion of the board
the unserviceability is due to normal wear and tear ; otherwise
the case will be dealt with in accordance with Chapter XVI.
101. Greatcoats will not be condemned as unserviceable
unless:—
(a) the collar, pocket flaps or front edges are worn
threadbare, and expenditure on a new collar or
pocket flaps is not considered an economical
proposition ;
{b) the cuffs are worn through ;
(c) the button-holes are past repair;
(d) the stains are so bad that in the opinion of a firm of
cleaners, which should be obtained in writing,
cleaning would be of no use.
Unserviceability owing to staining should not normally
be considered as having been caused by fair wear, and the
soldier must be held liable for the damage unless he can show
that it was due to wear under service conditions or by circum-
stances outside his control.
The board of survey will certify on A.F. H 1155 that the
provisions of this paragraph have been complied with.
102. All textile articles of condemned unit public clothing
(other than oilskin clothing) will be graded by the board either
as garments or rags; condemned greatcoats issued under
Scale 10A, will, however, be graded as rags. Articles graded
as rags, together with any textile articles not included in the
condemned clothing contract, whether complete garments or
not, will be reduced to rags in the presence of the board. The


number of articles and the resulting weight of rags will be
entered on A.F. H 1155, a reference to this form being given on
the transfer voucher (A.F. G 1049) by which the garments are
written off charge and- brought on as rags in Section IV of the
clothing ledger. Condemned oilskin clothing will be destroyed
in the presence of the board. The proceedings of the board
will then be forwarded in duplicate to the D.A.D.O.S. for
scrutiny, and further action regarding disposal will not be
taken by the unit until one copy is returned countersigned
by the D.A.D.O.S. On receipt of this copy, unserviceable
garments will be marked as directed in Appendix 10 in the
presence of an officer, and a certificate that this has been done
will be annexed to the A.F. H 1155. Should it appear that
excessive or undue condemnation of public clothing has taken
place, the D.A.D.O.S. will arrange to inspect the unserviceable
garments before returning one copy of A.F. H 1155 to the unit,
and, if excessive or undue condemnations are confirmed, the
matter will be brought to the notice of the G.0.C.-in-C. for
a decision concerning the continuation in wear of those items
which are considered to have further life.
103. When a board of survey cannot be assembled owing
to sufficient officers or W.Os. not being available, the duties of
the board will be carried out by the O.C. unit, who will attach
to the proceedings a statement showing the circumstances
in which the board could not be held.
104. Unserviceable articles of station public clothing issued
on inventory will be dealt with as laid down in Regulations
for Supply, Transport and Barrack Services. Unserviceable
articles held on armament charge will be returned to the
R.A.O.C.
(b) Disposal—General
105. All public and personal clothing will be disposed of
to the contractor for condemned clothing, except as otherwise
directed in this chapter.
106. The proceeds of sale of all public clothing will be
credited to army funds. The proceeds of sale of personal
clothing and necessaries will be dealt with as laid down in
paras. 56 and 57.
107. All buttons and badges will be removed from garments
before disposal, care being taken not to mutilate the garment.
108. When full dress head-dresses are condemned as
unserviceable, the metal ornaments will be removed and
retained for re-issue.


109. C.Os. will ensure that condemned public clothing and
worn out personal Clothing and necessaries are sorted into
(a) garments and (6) rags, before despatch to the contractor,
and that they are charged to him accordingly. A “ garment ”
is one that is whole and reasonably clean but which has
become threadbare and worn to such an extent as to be
unserviceable for use in the Army. No deliberate mutilation
should have taken place. Anything below this standard
Should be classified as rags. In no case, unless provided
for in the contract, will gold lace, braid, etc., which forms
part of the authorized garniture be removed from garments.
Boots and shoes will be tied together in pairs. Articles
obtained from private sources must not be included.
110. Condemned clothing or necessaries classified as rags
which may be required by units, etc., for cleaning purposes
will be retained in diminution of quantities of rags allowed
by other regulations. In the case of personal clothing and
necessaries so retained, the credits to the soldiers, assessed as
in para. 57, will be admitted as a charge against the public.
111. Any condemned unit public clothing, except bearskin
caps, required for regimental tailors shops for repairs will be
retained and struck off charge on the certificate of the C.O.
when the garments have been expended in repairs, reference
being given to the report of the board of survey by which the
articles were condemned. Any such articles required by
civilian tradesmen for repairs will be dealt with as laid down
in para. 317.
Small pieces of old bearskin suitable for petty repairs of
bearskin caps will be supplied on indent, if available.
112. The entries in the clothing account striking con-
demned public clothing off chargfe will be supported by a copy
of A.F. H 1172, and also by the receipt of the contractor, when
the stores are sold, and by a certified explanatory statement,
when they are otherwise disposed of. A copy of the report
of the board which condemned the stores will also be attached.
113. Except as otherwise directed in this chapter, officers,
W.Os., N.C.Os. and men are forbidden to have any trans-
actions with the contractor, nor will they be permitted to act
as his agent or representative.
Disposal—Home Stations
114. Except as otherwise directed in this chapter, all
condemned public clothing and worn-out personal clothing
and necessaries for the disposal of which there is a contract
will be handed over to the authorized contractor under the


following arrangements, the complete garments and rags
being shown separately :
(а) A list of the public clothing available for removal,
duly completed with rates and amounts, will be
prepared ki triplicate on A.F. H 1172; one copy
of the A.F. H 1172, together with a list of the
personal clothing and necessaries available for
removal, will be sent to the contractor. The
remaining two copies of the A.F. H 1172 will be
forwarded to the command paymaster, who, on
receipt from the contractor of the amount due,
will return one copy to the unit to support the
write-off in the clothing account.
(б) On receipt from the command paymaster of the A.F.
H 1172 showing that payment for the public
clothing has been made and on receipt from the
contractor of the amount due for personal clothing
and necessaries, the C.O. will arrange with the
contractor for the removal of the articles. An
officer of the unit (not the quarter-master) will
be detailed to witness their delivery to the
contractor.
115. Clothing and necessaries for disposal will normally be
notified to the contractor at intervals not exceeding three
months, but in the event of a unit being about to leave a
station, or in other special circumstances, the contractor may
be called upon to remove the articles at any time. The
articles will, as a rule, be removed by the contractor or his
agent within three weeks of the C.O’s. notification. Should
a case arise where neither the contractor nor his agent can
attend, the articles may be forwarded to him, carriage forward,
at his risk, provided that payment has been made.
116. Articles not covered by the condemned clothing
contract will normally be disposed of by local arrangement to
the best advantage, except that all public or personal clothing
and necessaries graded as rags, whether the garments are
included in the contract or not, will, subject to para. 110, be
disposed of as rags under the contract.
Condemned full dress head-dresses (other than forage caps)
will be returned to the C. 0.0., Woolwich.
Disposal—Stations Abroad
117. Condemned public clothing will be handed in to the
R.A.O.C. for disposal as follows ;


(a) To be sold locally if the sum obtainable is not less
than home contract rates minus the cost of labour
and conveyance home.
(b) To be consigned to the C. 0.0., Didcot, provided that
the value at home contract rates, less the cost of
labour and conveyance home, appreciably exceeds
the sum obtainable locally.
(c) Failing alternatives (a) and (6), either to be disposed
of locally for what it will fetch or to be destroyed
locally on the certificate of the 0.0. that it could
not otherwise be dealt with.
118. O.Os. concerned will be held responsible that no
unremunerative consignments are forwarded for disposal at
home under (b) of para. 117. In assessing the value of a
consignment at home contract rates, articles not fit for
disposal as garments will be valued at the rag rate applicable
at home stations.
119. Personal clothing and necessaries for disposal at
stations abroad will be sold locally under regimental arrange-
ments or by command contract, payments to the men being
assessed as provided in para. 57 (see also para. 120).
120. In making arrangements for local disposal, one of the
conditions of sale will be that the purchaser shall not, either
directly or indirectly, dispose of any frocks, jackets or head-
dresses as garments, unless they have first been so altered
that they cannot be recognized as having been used as a
uniform of the Regular Army.


CHAPTER VII
CLOTHING AND KIT ALLOWANCES
{a) General Instructions
121. Clothing and kit allowances are credited to the soldier
for the maintenance of the articles included in the regulation
scales of clothing and necessaries, and also for expenses on
washing, haircutting, etc.
The allowances will be expended on renewals, repairs, etc.,
as considered requisite by the O.C. company.
Kit allowance only is credited during the first year of.
service of soldiers, other than native soldiers of local forces,
subject to the exceptions stated in later paragraphs. Clothing
allowance is credited after the soldier has completed 12 months’
service.
122. Clothing or kit allowance, at the rates published in
Army Orders from time to time for the arm of the service
and the station at which the man is serving, is, except as
otherwise provided, credited monthly to the soldier’s account.
For clothing and kit allowance purposes, each month will be
regarded as consisting of 30 days,
123. If the allowance has been exhausted, any further ex-
penditure on account of clothing, necessaries, haircutting or
washing will be met from the soldier’s pay.
124. The O.C. company may, at his discretion, cause any
portion of the balance of allowance to be retained in the
soldier’s account to meet probable requirements on promotion,
transfer, etc. In the case of a soldier under orders to proceed
from one station to another, the O.C. company will arrange,
as far as possible, for a sufficient balance of the allowance to be
kept to the man’s credit to cover the cost of any additional
clothing required at the new station.
125. After provision has been made as in para. 124, any
balance of allowance may be included in the current cash pay-
ment to the soldier. The allowance credited in respect of
the current month, however, will not in any circumstances
be issued before the last day of that month.
126. In the case of a man proceeding overseas from a home
station who has been debited with the cost of clothing required
for the new station under para. 227, cash issues and allotments
of pay, if any, will not be reduced by reason of such debit


until a further three months’ clothing allowance has been
credited ; or, in the case of a man embarking before becoming
entitled to his first allowance, until he has been credited with
clothing allowance for three months.
127. When a soldier is admitted to a military hospital, his
account will be debited with a charge of 6 d. for the washing
of under-clothing, etc. This amount will be credited to the
public.
128. On extension of service or re-engagement, or on
re-enlistment when the service is continuous, clothing allow-'
ance, if otherwise admissible, will continue to be credited.
When there is a distinct break in colour service, however, and
also when a man rejoins from the Army Reserve, he will be
dealt with as a recruit, the " date of enlistment " for clothing
and kit allowance purposes being that on which he rejoined
the colours.
129. In the case of prefects of the Duke of York’s Royal
Military School enlisted direct into the Regular Army, the
“ date of enlistment ” for clothing and kit allowance purposes
will be the date of the first issue of clothing and necessaries
as laid down in para. 302.
In the case of transfers from the Royal Marines, the " date
of enlistment ” for clothing and kit allowance purposes will
be the date of enlistment in the Royal Marines.
130. A soldier while undergoing training at the R.M.A. or
R.M.C. with a view to promotion to commissioned rank will
not receive kit or clothing allowances.
131. On mobilization and active service, the allowances will
be dealt with as laid down in Appendix 15.
132. Clothing allowance for civilian employees is dealt with
in Chapter XIII.
(6) Kit Allowance (for soldiers in their first year of service,
except native soldiers of local forces)
133. The first credit of one month’s kit allowance will be
made in the soldier’s account, subject to para. 135, for the
month in which he completes three months’ service. There-
after the allowance will normally be credited monthly until
completion of 12 months’ service, when a final credit of one
month’s allowance will be made, in addition to the first issue
of clothing allowance credited under para. 141.
134. In addition to the normal monthly credit, a special
credit equal to two months’ allowance will, subject to para. 135,
be made in the account for the month in which six months’
service is completed.


135. No credits of the allowance, under paras. 133 and 134,
will be made after the date on which a man’s discharge has
been approved, except that, in the case of a man who has
completed 12 months’ service and whose discharge is approved
before the last day of the month m which such completion
occurs, the credit of kit allowance for that month will be
allowed in the non-effective account. .
136. For a man who deserts in his first 12 months of ser-
vice, the credit of kit allowance for the month in which deser-
tion takes place (including, where applicable, the special credit
under para. 134) will be deducted from his account.
137. A rejoined deserter who had not completed 12 months
service before desertion will be dealt with as follows
la) If desertion occurred before Ist May, 1929, application
for instructions regarding the credit of kit
allowance will be made to the Under-Secretary
of State (M.G.O.F. (b)), The War Office, accom-
panied by full details of service.
lb) If the desertion occurred on or after Ist May, 1929,
kit allowance will not be credited after the man
rejoins until a number of complete calendar
months have been served equivalent to the number
served before desertion. Where the special credit
referred to in para. 134 had not been made before
desertion, it may be given in the month in which
the man completes six months’ service subsequent
to rejoining. In no circumstances will such special
credit be given more than once. The final credit
of kit allowance will be given in the account for
the month in which the man completes 12 months
service subsequent to rejoining.
137 A. A man convicted of fraudulent enlistment who, at
the date of conviction, had not completed 12 months service
on his latest attestation will be dealt with as follows:
■ (a) If the service on the previous attestation exceeds 12
months, no further credits of kit allowance will be
. made.
lb) If less than 12 months had been served on his pre-
vious attestation, kit allowance will not be
admissible until a number of complete calendar
months have been served on his latest attestation
equivalent to the number served before fraudulent
enlistment.


138. No deduction will be made in respect of any kit
allowance already credited between the date of fraudulent
enlistment and the date of conviction.
139. In the case of men transferred from Imperial to Indian
stations who, on the day preceding date of embarkation, have
more than three months' and less than 12 months’ service,
one-thirtieth of the monthly rate of kit allowance will be
credited to the men’s accounts by the Imperial paymaster in
respect of each day in the month of embarkation which
precedes the date of embarkation. In addition, men who
complete six months’ service in the month of, but before,
embarkation will be credited, before embarkation, with the
special credit referred to in para. 134.
140. Men transferred from India with more than three and
less than 12 months’ service will be dealt with for kit allowance
on the lines of paras. 152 and 153. The special credit referred
to in para. 134 will not be credited by the Imperial paymaster
to a man who is an Indian liability at the time of completion
of six months’ service.
(c) Clothing Allowance (for soldiers who have completed
12 months’ service)
141. The first credit of clothing allowance will normally
be made in the account for the month in which the first
anniversary of the soldier’s enlistment occurs. This first credit
will consist of the monthly rate reduced by one-thirtieth in
respect of each day of that month which precedes the day of the
first anniversary of the soldier’s enlistment. Thereafter the
allowance will normally be credited monthly to the soldier’s
account (see para. 122). In units where full dress clothing is
worn as personal clothing, the full dress rate of allowance will
not be credited until the month in which the first anniversary
of the initial issue of the full dress clothing occurs.
142. Except as provided in paras. 141, 151 and 152,
new rates of allowance necessitated by promotion, transfer
or change of station, etc. , will apply to the whole of the
month in which such changes are notified in orders. Appoint-
ments to acting or temporary ranks will not be regarded as
promotion for clothing allowance purposes.
143. On discharge or transfer to the Army Reserve, men
who enlisted on or after Ist January, 1922, will be credited
with one-thirtieth of the monthly rate for each day of service
during the month in which their discharge or transfer to the
Army Reserve takes place, subject, if necessary, to the deduc-
tion referred to in para. 145. A man discharged on the last


day of any month (including February) will be credited with
the full monthly allowance, subject to para. 145.
144. A man who is discharged before the last day of the
month in which he has completed one year’s service will be
credited with one-thirtieth of the monthly rate in respect
of each day during which he remains with the colours, from
and including the day of the first anniversary of his enlistment.
145. In cases where a soldier is absent without leave, deserts
or is sent to prison, a deduction of one-thirtieth of the monthly
rate of allowance will be made from the month’s allowance in
respect of each day of absence from duty during that month,
except as provided in paras. 147 and 163. When a man is
absent from duty through such causes for the whole of any
month (including February), the total amount credited for
that month will be deducted. The deductions authorized
by this paragraph will not be made from men in custody await-
ing trial, from men in detention (except as in para. 148) or
from invalids on board ship who wear their uniform clothing
during the period of a voyage from one station to another.
The words “ absent ” and “ absence ’’ as used in this para-
graph will be applied in accordance with the terms of the Pay
Warrant, 1931, Articles 928 and 929.
A similar deduction will be made in respect of each day
spent in a civil or military hospital, excluding the day of ad-
mission but including the day of discharge, except in the case
of men admitted to hospital for the purpose of blood trans-
fusion to other military patients.
146. Men in civil or military hospitals from whom a deduc-
tion is made under para. 145 will be credited at the end of the
month with a special grant of \d. for each day for which a
deduction is made, to cover incidental expenses, e.g. haircutting
and wear and tear of such items of clothing, etc., as are taken
into hospital for their personal use.
147. Native soldiers of local forces, while in hospital, will not
be subject to deductions under para. 145 or be eligible for
the special grant authorized by para. 146.
148. In the case of a soldier undergoing detention whose
discharge from the Army has been approved, or is being
applied for, or about whose retention in the service there is any
uncertainty, the allowance will be deducted from the date of
committal. In the event of a man being held to serve, the
allowance so deducted will be credited to his account.
149. A rejoined deserter who had completed 12 months'
service before desertion will be credited with clothing allow-
ance, if otherwise eligible, from the date of rejoining.


150. A man convicted of fraudulent enlistment who, at
the date of conviction, had completed 12 months’ service
on his latest attestation will, if otherwise eligible, continue
to be credited with clothing allowance without any adjustment.
151. In the case of men posted from Imperial" to Indian
stations, one-thirtieth of the monthly rate of allowance will be
credited by the Imperial paymaster in respect of each day in
the month of embarkation which precedes the date of em-
barkation, subject to paras. 133 and 145.
152. Men posted from Indian to Imperial stations will be
credited by the Indian paymaster, before embarkation, with
the allowance for the voyage period, in accordance with the
standard voyage periods notified to all paymasters; no ad-
justment will be made in respect of under or over issues of
allowance on account of differences between the standard and
actual voyage periods.
153. After disembarkation from India, clothing allowance
will be credited as laid down in Appendix 13.
154. In the case of men arriving from India for discharge
or transfer to the Army Reserve whose transfer statements of
account show that clothing allowance due ftom Indian funds
has not been credited, the R.P. should credit, at Indian rates,
the allowance due, and recover from the Indian paymaster
the amount so credited.
155. Men arriving at home stations for courses of instruction
from overseas, except India, will, subject to para. 157, be
treated for clothing allowance purposes as if posted to the
home establishment.
156. Men home on furlough will continue to be credited
with the overseas rate of allowance, except that, if they are
permitted to attend courses of instruction during such fur-
lough, the allowance due for the period of such courses will be
credited at home rates.
157. Men and boys of the Royal Malta Artillery on courses
of instruction in England will be credited with clothing
allowance at the rate laid down for dismounted services
at home stations.
158. Soldiers lent for colonial employment will be credited
with clothing allowance from army funds up to (and including)
the day preceding embarkation. On their return from
colonial employment, the allowance will be credited from (and
including) the date of their rejoining the British service for


duty. In the case of men rejoining from employment in
Tropical Africa, Palestine, Transjordania or Iraq (except with
Iraq Levies), a special grant consisting of three months’
allowance at home rates and the value of a kit of necessaries
will also be credited to the men’s accounts. Such grants
will be charged in the pay list under the heading “ Crown
Agents for the Colonies, Misc.” (see also Appendix 16).
(i d) Additional Instructions applicable only to soldiers who
enlisted before Is# January, 1922.
159. The clothing quarters referred to herein begin on
Ist January, Ist April, Is# July and Is# October.
160. Os.C. companies will furnish to the R.P. not later than
10 days before the beginning of each clothing quarter a list of
soldiers enlisted before Is# January, 1922, who are due or
probably due for discharge or transfer to the Army Reserve
during the ensuing clothing quarter, showing the dates or probable
dates of termination of their colour service.
. 161. Such men will not be entitled to any allowance for the
quarter in which their discharge or transfer to the Army Reserve
is expected to take place. An exception will, however, he made
in- the case of men who enlisted on the first day of a clothing
quarter and who are due for discharge or transfer to the Army
Reserve on the last day of a quarter: such men will be credited
with the allowance during the clothing quarter on the last day
of which their discharge or transfer to the Army Reserve takes
place (see para. 163).
162. If the discharge or transfer to the Army Reserve is post-
poned beyond the clothing quarter in which it was due, the
allowance will then be credited up to the last day of the quarter
preceding the quarter in which the discharge or transfer to the
Army Reserve actually takes place (see para. 163).
163. The one-thirtieth deductions and special daily rates
under paras. 145 and 146 will not apply during the quarter
in which the men’s discharge or transfer to the Army Reserve is
effected, except in the case of men who under paras. 161,162 and
164 are credited with the full allowance for the quarter, when such
allowance will be treated as an issue in arrear of three separate
monthly allowances, and any deductions or special credits due
in accordance with paras. 145 and 146 will be made on a monthly
basis.
164. Men who are discharged or transferred to the Army
Reserve during a clothing quarter on the first day of which such
discharge or transfer to the Army Reserve was not foreseen will

home paymaster.


CHAPTER VIII
POSTINGS, ATTACHMENTS AND TRANSFERS
166. When a soldier is to be posted, attached or transferred
to another unit, the unit public clothing in his possession
will be inspected and any necessary repairs or replacements
carried out. Articles to be taken to the new unit will be
shown on a clothing and equipment transfer statement on
A.F. H 1157. A.F. G 1033 will be prepared from the A.F.
H 1157. When two or more men proceed to join the same
unit, a separate A.F. H 1157 will be prepared for each man,
but a consolidated abstract on A.F. G 1033, together with a
nominal roll of the personnel to whom the voucher refers, will
be prepared. The A.F. H 1157 will be signed by the soldier as
an acknowledgment that the articles shown thereon are in
his possession at the time of leaving the unit.
167. In the case of recruits who have not received a complete
outfit of personal clothing and necessaries, and men for
discharge who are not entitled to the proceeds of sale of their
personal clothing [see para. 274), such items as have been
issued will also be shown on A.F. H 1157.
168. The A.F. H 1157 and A.F. G 1033 will be disposed of
as under: —
[а) Men proceeding from a unit at home to ci unit at home
or abroad— The forms will be sent to the O.C. the
unit to which the man proceeds. In the case of
soldiers proceeding to the R.A. at stations abroad,
when the batteries which the men will join are
not known, the forms will be sent to the O.C. the
brigade to which the men are posted, and this
officer will obtain receipts and references to their
clothing account from the batteries to which the
men are allotted, and will attach them to one
copy of the A.F. G 1033, which will be returned
to the O.C. the home unit to support the issue in
his account.
(б) Men sent home from stations abroad. —The forms will
accompany the man’s documents and will be
addressed as in K.R., 1935, para. 1202. The
officer to whom the documents are addressed will
be responsible for forwarding A.F. H 1157 and
A.F. G 1033 to the O.C. the unit or establishment
concerned.


169. On arrival at the new unit, the articles in the man’s
possession will immediately be compared with those shown on
A.F. H 1157. The unit public clothing will be entered in the
clothing ledger from the A.F. G 1033, one copy of which will be
signed and returned to the man’s former unit. If no A.F.
G 1033 is received, the public clothing will be brought on
charge at once by a certificate voucher.
170. Unit public clothing in possession of details left
behind in hospital, etc., on embarkation of their units to or
from stations abroad will, before the embarkation of the unit,
be vouchered to the unit to which the details are attached.
171. The unit public clothing in possession of men proceed-
ing on courses of instruction, vocational training, or other
temporary duty will be dealt with as follows :
From home stations. —lf the period of duty is unlikely to
exceed three months, the clothing will remain on charge of
their own units ; for longer periods it will be vouchered to the
establishments, etc., to which the men proceed.
From stations abroad. —The clothing will be vouchered to
the unit to which the men proceed, irrespective of the period
of duty.
172. Soldiers attached for duty to another unit will continue
to be clothed on the scale applicable to their own unit, and not
on the scale laid down for the unit to which they are attached.
Clothing required for such men will normally be indented and
accounted for by the unit to which they are attached for pay.
The indents for clothing for these men will show clearly the
unit to which they belong. N.C.Os. appointed as temporary
assistant warders in detention barracks abroad will be clothed
by the commandant of the detention barracks.
173. When in exceptional cases issues are made to soldiers
who are not on the pay roll of the unit which issues the clothing,
separate A.Fs. H 1181 will be prepared, in duplicate, by the
issuing unit, for each other unit concerned and sent to the
R.Ps. of such units.
174. Articles of full dress unit public clothing will be
withdrawn from soldiers posted or attached to the permanent
staff of a Territorial Army unit, before they leave their units,
except that in the case of Foot Guards blue-grey greatcoats
will be continued in wear.
175. The full dress unit public clothing in possession of
students proceeding to the Royal Military School of Music
for training as bandmasters will be withdrawn before they
leave their units. On completion of the probationary period,


greatcoats, dismounted, will be exchanged for greatcoats,
mounted, and each student will receive a free issue as personal
clothing of one forage cap and badge, one cloth frock and one
pair of tweed trousers. A second frock and a second pair of
trousers will only be issued on repayment.
176. Soldiers attending other courses of instruction at the
Royal Military School of Music will take with them all personal
and unit public clothing in their possession, except knee boots
and jack spurs, which will be withdrawn before they leave their
unit. Any renewal of clothing will be obtained by the com-
mandant. The exchange of outgrown unit public clothing
will, when possible, be effected direct with the unit to which
the wearers belong. When the unit cannot supply the articles,
they will be indented for from the clothing depot supplying
the area, and the part-worn public clothing outgrown will be.
returned to the unit. Cloth pantaloons will not be worn at the
school.
177. Stocks of cotton gymnasium vests will be held at the
Army School of Physical Training and in commands and
districts concerned, for issue on repayment to men on physical
training courses.
Men who enlisted before Ist September, 1927, will receive
an initial free issue of two vests on first attending a pre-
liminary course in physical training before joining the Army
School of Physical Training for training as instructors. No
free issues will be made to men undergoing vocational training
as physical training instructors.
178. In the case of men on the Indian establishment under-
going courses of instruction at home stations, any articles of
unit public clothing that are absolutely necessary will be
issued, all such issues being recorded on their clothing transfer
statements, and also on A.F. H 1107, when rendered in
accordance with para. 210.
179. Men posted or transferred to another unit or corps in
which the uniform is of the same pattern as that of their old
unit will take all their personal and unit public clothing with
them. Otherwise they will only take such articles of their
personal and unit public clothing as can be worn in their new
unit or corps, and any other articles in their possession
required for the journey ; articles not taken will be stored for
three months by the original unit.
If a man is sent back to his original unit within three
months, he will take back the clothing which he brought with
him and articles stored will be re-issued. Personal clothing
special to the unit to which he had been transferred will be


dealt wit h as directed in paras. 52 and 55 and unit public
store^ s P ecia l to that unit will be returned to regimental
If the man is still serving in his new unit at the end of three
months, personal clothing not required and articles of personal
clothing stored by the old unit will be disposed of as directed
in paras. 52 and 55 and the proceeds credited to the man.
serviceable unit public clothing not required will be returned
to the man s original unit or to the depot of that unit.

transferred to another unit or corps, or posted from dis-
mounted to mounted duties within the unit, will be dealt with
as follows ;
(а) Men transferred for public reasons.
, W Articles of personal clothing which can be converted to
the pattern worn in the new unit, etc., may be altered at the
public expense, when the estimated cost of alteration (including
labour and any necessary chevrons or badges) does not
exceed the vocabulary rate for a new garment. If the cost
is estimated to exceed this rate, the value of a new garment
will be credited to the soldier’s account.
(ii) The value of any other article of personal clothing
and necessaries (other than overall clothing and woollen
drawers) required owing to difference of pattern or scale will be
credited to the soldier’s account.
(б) Men transferred at their own request.
(i) Articles of personal clothing in possession which can be
converted may be altered at the public expense, when the
estimated cost of alteration (including labour and any necessary
chevrons or badges) does not exceed half the value of a new
garment. If the cost is estimated to exceed this value
half value of a new garment will be credited to the soldier’s
account.
(ii) Half value of any other article of personal clothing
and necessaries (other than overall clothing and woollen
drawers) required owing to difference in pattern or scale will be
credited to the soldier's account.
Should the soldier prefer purchase of a new garment to
conversion of the one in possession under (a) or (b) above, the
estimated cost of conversion (not exceeding new value in the
case of (a) and half value in the case of (b)) may be credited
to his account.
A man sent back within three months to the unit from which
he was transferred will not be entitled to any further credit
under this paragraph, nor will a man re-transferred at any


time for misconduct be entitled to credit in respect of
necessaries.
The cost of alterations or the credits referred to at (a) and
(6) above will not be allowed in cases where the difference in
pattern or scale is due merely to change of station.
The value of all articles issued from store on transfer as
above will be charged against the man’s account.
When a different pattern of overall clothing is included in the
new scale, the overall clothing in possession will be continued
in wear until unserviceable, when the correct pattern will be
issued on payment.
181. Men transferred from mounted to dismounted services
will not receive any credit on account of woollen drawers ;
the cotton drawers in possession need not be replaced until
worn out.
182. Serjeants or lance-serjeants posted to machine-gun
squadrons or companies may be credited with the value of one
suit of overalls, provided that they were appointed lance-serjeants
before May, 1928. A similar credit may be allowed for
N.C.Os. posted as serjeants or lance-serjeant instructors to the
permanent staff of mechanized T.A. units where appointment to
lance-serjeant was before April, 1930. Credits under this
paragraph will be supported by the certificate of the O.C. unit
that no previous credit under this heading had been made.
183. Transfers from the Royal Marines will be dealt with
for clothing and necessaries under the conditions of paras. 179
and 180 ( see also para. 129), and soldiers transferred to the
R.A.F. under para. 179.
184. Probationers for the R.A.S.C., R.A.M.C., R.A.0.C.,
R.A.P.C., C.M.P., M.P.S.C., and Physical Training Staff,
and soldiers on probation under K.R., 1935, para. 314 (iii),
will retain all the clothing in their possession and will continue
to wear it until their final disposal is decided on, when they
will be dealt with under paras. 179 to 181.
185. The clothing of personnel proceeding to the R.A.F.
on attachment will be completed to scale before the men leave
their army unit, and their greatcoats will be struck off charge
by certificate voucher. The cost of any authorized free
issues made to the men, together with the cost of any new
greatcoats specially issued to enable the men to proceed, will
be charged in the paymaster’s account to " Air Ministry,
Miscellaneous Services ".
While serving with the R.A.F., such men will continue to

taking him to a military prison, and will be dealt with under
paras. 273, 274 and 277. Ankle boots or highland shoes,
overall clothing and all necessaries in possession will be left at
the prison. Such necessaries as are not required for use will be
stored at the prison for re-issue to the man on release.
255. A suit of plain clothes will be provided by the O.C.
the man’s unit, or the unit to which he may be attached at
the time of imprisonment, for each soldier taken to a military
prison, and will be handed over by the escort to the prison
authorities, a receipt being obtained for it. The value of the
plain clothes will be charged against the man’s account.

pair of ankle boots or highland shoes, the necessaries which
he has in use and those stored for him. His overall clothing
will be retained at the prison for further use.

fair and reasonable, and that the work has been satisfactorily
performed.

brought back from the prison by the military escort; if a
military escort is not provided, the articles will be sent to the

of the prison. The clothing will be taken into store by the
unit providing the escort or the unit to which it is sent, and
dealt with under Chapter XII, except that the necessaries
will be sold, the proceeds being dealt with in accordance with
the regulations made under the Regimental Debts Act. No

his public and personal clothing will be retained, and subse-
quently, when he is due for release, it will be sent to the
prison. In this case, the suit of plain clothes will be returned
to the unit by the prison authorities and will again be brought
on charge, the value being credited to the man’s account.
260. Men arriving from stations abroad for penal servitude or
imprisonment. —Men arriving from stations abroad (including

Dorchester or Winchester prisons, and the O.C. Depot,
Dorsetshire Regiment, or the O.C. Rifle Depot, respectively,
are responsible for carrying out the instructions in paras. 258
and 259. In the case of men committed to a prison other
than Dorchester or Winchester, the O.C. the unit to which the
men are attached is responsible for carrying out the provisions
of these two paragraphs.

(For instructions regarding clothing allowance, see paras.
136, 137, 149 and 150.)
(a) Desertion
261. Unit public clothing left behind by a deserter will
be taken into store. Public clothing deficient on desertion
will be struck off charge,'but will not be included in the monthly
return of clothing lost (A.F. P 1954) until the man is placed,
under stoppages on rejoining (see K.R.). A duplicate (signed
by the C. 0.) of the declaration of the court of inquiry recording
the circumstances connected with the soldier’s absence, and the
deficiency in his clothing and necessaries, will accompany
the account in which the articles of unit public clothing are
struck off charge.
262. The personal clothing and necessaries left behind by a
deserter will be retained in store for six months for re-issue in
the event of his rejoining. After six months they will be
available for issue to any rejoined deserter under the terms
of para. 263, but should there be no such outlet for all or any
of the articles, the C.O. will use his discretion as to their
disposal. When articles are disposed of, the assessed value of
issues to rejoined deserters, or the proceeds of sale as shown on
A.F. O 1622, will be credited as follows :
{a) When the man was entitled to clothing allowance
before desertion—to his non-effective account.
(6) When the man was not entitled to clothing allowance
before desertion —to the public in the case of
personal clothing and to the man’s non-effective
account in the case of necessaries.
263. On rejoining, articles left behind by a deserter which
may be still retained in store under para. 262 will be returned
to him. A service dress or khaki drill suit, cap, puttees, one
pair of boots or Highland shoes, and at stations abroad a
helmet, together with any essential necessaries, will also be
issued, unless such articles are already in his possession.
Part-worn articles will be issued if in store, or if readily ob-
tainable from another unit at the same station or from any
soldier who has permission to sell them ; in the latter case.


the value of the articles, as assessed by the C. 0., will be paid,
and the amount charged against the public, supported by the
receipt.
No further issues of clothing and necessaries will be made
to a rejoined deserter until after his case has been decided,
when, if sentenced to detention, he will be dealt with in
accordance with Chapter X subject to para. 264, and, if sen-
tenced to be discharged, under Chapter XII.
264. If retained in the service, any additional persona]
clothing required to complete to the authorized scale will be
issued to the soldier free of charge, except where he was
entitled to clothing allowance before desertion, when his
account will be charged with the value of all articles issued
to him since rejoining other than any that had been left
behind by him on desertion.
The kit of necessaries will be completed to scale at the
soldier’s expense, except that, when a recruit deserted before
receiving a complete Outfit of necessaries, articles not issued
before his desertion will be supplied free.
265. A rejoined deserter will only be placed under stoppages
in respect of the deficiency of or damage to public clothing
consequent on his desertion when he is actually so sentenced
on a charge under the Army Act, Section 24 (2), or by the
award of his C.O. in the event of his trial for desertion being
dispensed with by a competent military authority. He will
not be charged for public clothing fit for wear which is in his
possession when he rejoins ; any such articles will be taken on
charge by certificate receipt voucher.
266. Men who desert in India and are apprehended at
Imperial stations will be dealt with in accordance with these
regulations. All free issues from Imperial stocks of clothing
and necessaries and all credits of clothing allowance to such
men will be chargeable against the Government of India, and
will be adjusted through the paymaster’s accounts. Re-
coveries from such men on account of issues on payment from
Imperial stocks will be credited to army funds.
ip) Fraudulent or Improper Enlistment
267. Soldiers who fraudulently enlist will only be placed
under stoppages in respect of deficiency of or damage to public
clothing * or to make good the value (at the vocabulary rate in
force at the date of fraudulent enlistment) of each free kit
* Assessed as in para. 341.


of necessaries obtained by them on each occasion of fraudulent
enlistment, when they are actually so sentenced on a charge
under Section 24 (2) or Section 13 of the Army Act respect-
ively, or (in the event of their trial being dispensed with by
a competent military authority) by the award of the C.O.
or competent authority.
268. In the case of a man who deserted before fraudulent
enlistment, any personal clothing left behind on desertion
and not already disposed of under para. 262 will be sold and
the proceeds credited to the public, together with the part-
worn value of any articles deficient at the time of desertion,
which will be charged against the man’s account. Any sums
credited to the man’s non-effective account under para. 262
in respect of personal clothing left behind on desertion will
also be credited to the public. If the man is sent back to his
former unit, he will pay for any personal clothing and neces-
saries that he may require for service in that unit, other than
articles required to complete his original initial issue. Personal
clothing and necessaries which will be of use to him in the unit
to which he is relegated will be sent with him ; new articles
not required will be taken into store and the remainder will
be sold, the proceeds, together with the vocabulary value of
new articles taken into store, being credited to his account.
269. A recruit who, before receiving any necessaries, fraudu-
lently enlists and is retained to serve in the new unit will not pay
for the necessaries obtained on such fraudulent enlistment. If
sent back to the unit which he left, he will take with him articles
included in the scale for that unit, and will have his kit of
necessaries completed to the proper scale at the public expense.
Necessaries not required in the unit to which he is returned
will be taken into store, if new, or, if used, will be sold
to the best advantage and the proceeds credited to the public.
270. A soldier convicted of fraudulent enlistment in other
of His Majesty’s forces and relegated to his army unit will be
dealt with in accordance with paras. 267 and 268, the value of
the necessaries obtained by such fraudulent enlistment being
credited to army funds on recovery.
271. Men of the Army Reserve who, after improperly re-
enlisting and being convicted of making a false answer on
attestation, are re-transferred to the Army Reserve, will be
treated under the rules laid down for discharged men in Chap-
ter XII. They will be placed under stoppages in respect of :
(a) the assessed value of the pair of boots or shoes retained
by them {see para. 274) ;


(b) the value of the necessaries obtained by them if so
sentenced by court-martial within three months
of the date of improper enlistment, or if relegated
to the Army Reserve without trial within three
months of the date of improper enlistment;
(c) the value of any plain clothes issued by the unit
under para. 283 ;
{d) any other sums due to the public on account of
clothing and necessaries.
Sums so recovered will be entered on A.F. P 1954, for the
month in which the man is convicted or relegated to the Army
Reserve.
272. If the man is sentenced to a period of detention or
imprisonment before being relegated, the commandant of the
detention barracks or governor of the prison will include in
the report of the advances of subsistence money the value of
any plain clothes bought locally, quoting the authority for
the purchase.

men concerned at the time of handing in, subject to the same
conditions as laid down for soldiers in para. 57.
299. All articles of personal clothing will, however, be
withdrawn from :—■

para. 341, and the cost of repairing damaged articles, will be
charged against the employee unless the deficiency or damage
is due to circumstances beyond his control.

will receive clothing and necessaries, and will draw clothing
and kit allowances, as laid down for enlisted boys of dismounted
services, except that overall clothing will not be issued. The

allowance laid down for their rank at home stations, and will
provide themselves with all necessary personal clothing at their
own expense.
305. Uniform clothing for certain locally employed civilians
at stations abroad is provided and maintained under local
arrangements, the total expenditure in any one year on local
85


purchases and issues from store being limited to the sums
authorized from time to time in Army Orders. All charges
against army votes in respect of these services must be
supported by evidence of expenditure by the officer under
whom the employees are serving. In no circumstances will
cash grants be made to the men concerned. Unexpended
balances will not be carried forward from one year to another.
306. Clothing, or materials for making up, required for the
purposes of para. 305 may be obtained from the R.A.O.C. or
purchased locally. In the case of issues from store, the value
will be assessed at the vocabulary rates current at the time
of issue, the additional rate referred to in para. 339 being added
to the vocabulary rate. No expenditure will be admitted
against the public in respect of boots, shoes or underclothing,
nor on account of personal clothing of employees referred to in
para. 304.
(c) Protective Clothing
307. (i) For certain classes of work, standard scales of pro-
tective clothing are given in Scale 20, showing the articles
authorized for each man when actually employed on the class
of work specified. The total numbers of articles to be issued
will be authorized by the G.0.C.-in-C., as considered necessary
under these standard scales; the numbers to be so authorized
will not exceed those required for the maximum number of
men likely to be employed at any one time on the class of
work specified, except that an additional 50 per cent, may be
authorized to allow for washing (where applicable) and a further
10 per cent, for sizing purposes.
(ii) In other cases civilian employees are expected to pro-
vide their own waterproof and other protective clothing
(except that authorized in Scales 15 to 19) for work which is
included in the normal duties of their grade, and issues
of such clothing at the public expense will not be made without
War Office authority (except as in para. 307 (i) and 308 (see
also para. 99)) ; applications for such authority will be restricted
to exceptional cases which come within the following
categories :
(а) When the provision of articles of protective clothing,
etc., is a statutory obligation of employers.
(б) When it is essential or desirable in the public interest,
apart from any statutory obligation, to provide
protection from personal injury or danger.
(c) When employees are called upon to perform work
which is more dirty or destructive to their clothing
than work on which employees of the same grade
86


are ordinarily employed. (Protective clothing will
not be issuable merely because the work is of a
dirty nature —the usual duties of some grades
normally involve dirty work—but the circum-
stances must be exceptional, involving special
damage to clothing clearly abnormal in the grade
as a grade).
(d) When employees are required to undertake special
duties, i.e. duties not performed in the ordinary
course of their employment, which involve un-
usually prolonged and continuous exposure to wet
weather, etc., or working in water of appreciable
depth.
(iii) In no circumstances will protective clothing be issued
when full compensation is already made either by the of
extra wages or by the issue of a rate of wages specially increased
on that account.
308. Subject to para. 307, the G.O.C. district or station may
in exceptional circumstances authorize the temporary issue
(see R.A.0.5., Part 1, 1929, para. 537) of waterproof clothing
for civilian employees to meet temporary services only.
309. Protective clothing authorized for civilian employees
will be indented for from the clothing depot supplying the
area, and will be accounted for under the regulations relating
to the service concerned. In the case of stations abroad, the
price at which articles can be provided locally will be shown on
the indent.
87


CHAPTER XIV
ISSUE, FITTING, REPAIR AND MARKING OF
CLOTHING, ETC.
(a) Issue, Fitting and Repair
310. Each man requiring clothing, etc., will be paraded at
the quarter-master’s store and, when possible, stock size
articles to fit the man will be issued in the presence of the O.C.
company. Tables showing the stock sizes to fit men of
normal measurements are given in Appendix 6. (For full
dress garments, similar information can be obtained from
copies of the actual specifications, which will be issued to all
concerned on application to the Inspector of Full Dress,
Woolwich.)
In cases where men cannot be fitted from stock sizes,
indents for special size garments will be submitted in accord-
ance with paras. 351 to 355.
311. When the articles have been issued, the men will be
inspected by the O.C. company, who will see that the boots
and clothing are properly fitted in accordance with the
instructions contained in Appendix 7 ; if he considers that
any garment needs alteration, he will cause particulars to be
recorded on an “ alteration sheet ”, which will be carefully
preserved. He will subsequently ascertain that such altera-
tions have been carried out, and will parade the men for the
final approval of the C.O.
Cloaks and greatcoats of stock sizes will not be altered,
except as authorized in para. 312.
312. In greatcoats of W.Os., N.C.Os. and men author-
ized to carry a sword, a vertical sword slit 4 inches
long will be made at the left side, the top of the slit being
2 inches from the side seam. The opening will be jetted with
self material and felled on to the lining of the mounted great-
coat, and on to the forepart of the dismounted greatcoat; a
piece of self cloth will be sewn at the back of the slit so as to
cover it by 3or 4 inches. The cost of this service will be
borne by the public.
313. The fitting and repair of clothing in the Household
Cavalry, in the Foot Guards and in kilted regiments will be
carried out in the regimental tailor’s shop. Tools for such
88


shops (see Scale 10K), and materials and sewings required
for repairs will be obtained from the clothing depot supplying
the area, and will be held on clothing ledger charge. Care
will be taken to avoid the accumulation of excessive stocks.
Sewings may be provided locally at the discretion of the
C.O. Tools will be replaced at the public expense when worn
out through fair wear and tear.
314. Material expended in the regimental tailor’s shop will be
written off monthly by certificate voucher on A.F. P 1925,
supported by a statement showing the amounts charged for
repairs during the month. The materials should be kept
outside the control of the shop, to which not more than one
week’s supplies for current work should be given out at a
time. All surplus materials will be delivered to the quarter-
master or other accounting officer, who will bring them on
charge in the same manner as other receipts. Tailors’
cuttings accumulated by units will be disposed of as rags,
direct to the contractor for condemned clothing, the proceeds
being credited to the public.
315. Soldiers employed in these shops will not receive in
respect of any work carried out by them any further sums over
and above the appropriate rates of pay laid down in the
Pay Warrant. The numbers of men authorized to be employed
as serjeant tailors and tailors are laid down in regimental
establishments. Military labour only will be allowed in units
having a serjeant tailor, except in special circumstances,
when prior War Office sanction will be obtained.
316. The fitting and repair of clothing in units other.than
Household Cavalry, Foot Guards and kilted regiments, and
repairs to boots and shoes (see Appendix 12) in all units, will
be carried out under local contract. Tenders will be invited
by units in all cases before such contracts are placed. The
tenders will be forwarded to command headquarters for
approval of acceptance of the tender recommended by the
unit. Before such approval is given, the rates quoted will be
compared with the existing rates already in operation in other
units in the area. The lowest tender will, as a rule, be accepted,
but the G.0.C.-in-C. must be satisfied that the tenderer is fit
to hold the contract, that the prices quoted are not unreason-
able and that the contract represents in all respects the most
suitable and advantageous manner of providing for the service.
Contracts will in no case be made for a longer period than
two years and will be terminated on the move of a unit to a
new station. An extension of a contract may be arranged only
in cases where units are due to proceed to another station
89


within a period of 12 months from the date of termination of a
contract.
317. Government material for the purpose of repairs and
alterations only may be issued to civilian contractors on
prepayment at the rates quoted in the repair contract. If
issue of condemned articles is made in lieu, the contract rates
for condemned clothing will be charged.
The prices shown in the contract will remain in force during
the currency of the contract, irrespective of any variations
in vocabulary prices of the materials concerned. Where
vocabulary prices show a substantial variation, the officer
responsible for the contract will use his discretion as to
terminating the contract and arranging a fresh one at the
amended prices.
Materials supplied under this paragraph and cash receipts in
respect thereof will be accounted for by the units concerned.
318. In no circumstances will government material be
supplied to civilian contractors or military tailors for the
purpose of enabling them to make up clothing for sale, except
in cases specially authorized by the War Office.
319. The cost of the initial fitting of new articles of personal
clothing, other than overall clothing (including the cost of
any necessary alterations, and of the sewing on of authorized
badges and chevrons) will be borne by the public. In the case
of fitting performed under local contract, the cost will be
charged on the voucher on which the garment is issued ( e.g.
A.F. H 1179 or H 1181) supported by a certificate that the
fitting has been carried out to the satisfaction of the C.O.
Only one fitting charge will be admissible in respect of each
garment. No charges for removing buttons, or for affixing
collar badges, regimental buttons and metal shoulder titles
will be borne by the public. The total charges for each
company, etc., will be claimed at Form 3 of the company
account, a reference to the period of the account in which the
charge will be found being inserted on the relevant issue
voucher.
The cost of fitting articles of full dress unit public clothing
issued under Scales 3 to 6 (including the fixing of metal badges
and titles) will also be borne by the public. Expenditure on
fitting other articles of public clothing will not be incurred
without the prior authority of the D.A.D.O.S.
320. In the Household Cavalry, Foot Guards and kilted
regiments, the amounts to be recovered from officers and
soldiers on account of work performed in the regimental tailor’s
90


shop will be approved by the C.O. and will be assessed on the
basis of the actual value of the materials used, plus the cost of
labour, with an additional overhead charge of 10 per cent.
321. The officer i/c the regimental tailor’s shop will prepare
weekly lists in triplicate showing the rank, name and corps of
officers for whom work has been performed in the shop and
the charges to be recovered from each. One copy will be
forwarded to the P.R.1., who will collect the money from the
officers concerned, and pay it to the command paymaster for
credit to the public ; the second copy will be sent to the
command paymaster, who will insert a reference to cash credit
and return the list to the unit to support the monthly voucher
by which the material is written off charge in the clothing
account; the third copy will be filed as a record.
322. The officer i/c the regimental tailor’s shop will prepare
monthly lists in duplicate of the work performed for W.Os.,
N.C.Os. and men showing the army number, rank, name and
unit of each individual and the amounts to be recovered from
each. Both copies will be forwarded by the O.C. company
to the R.P., with the company account. One copy will be
returned, duly certified, to the officer i/c the shop to support
the monthly voucher by which the tailor’s material is struck
off charge in the clothing ledger.
323. Charges for the repair of clothing in units other than
the Household Cavalry, Foot Guards and kilted regiments,
and charges for the repair of boots and shoes in all units, will be
made in accordance with the approved local contract rates
for the unit, and will be recovered from the soldier through the
pay and mess rolls and paid to the contractor by the C.O.
324. Ornaments and chains will be fitted to full dress head-
dresses by the armourer or under regimental arrangements,
but no allowance for the work will be granted ; ornaments
for caps will be attached by the men themselves. Swan-neck
spurs will be fitted to boots by the armourer or unit artificer,
without extra pay.
Instructions for the repair of colours, etc., are contained in
Chapter V.
(6) Marking
325. All clothing and necessaries, except station public
clothing and articles issued for trial purposes, must be marked
as directed in Appendix 10.
326. Tools and stamps as detailed in E.R., and marking
ink or paint, will be obtained free on indent from the
R.A.O.C.
91


327. Station public clothing issued “ on inventory ” will not
be specially marked, the W.D. mark being already on such
articles. The W.D. marking will be renewed whenever it
becomes indistinct.
328. When an article is re-issued or disposed of to another
soldier, a line will be drawn through the old army number and
the new number substituted.
329. When a soldier is transferred to another regiment or
corps, the public clothing transferred, as well as his personal
clothing and necessaries, will be re-marked, a line being drawn
through the initials of the old corps, and those of the new
one substituted.
330. No charge will be allowed for marking or re-marking.


CHAPTER XV
PAYMENT ISSUES
331. Articles or material of officers’ quality or pattern
cannot be supplied from public store, but materials and
articles of clothing and necessaries of army pattern may be
issued on payment to officers, provided that the quantities
asked for are not excessive and can be spared. Such issues
will, as a rule, be obtained through a unit; when they are
obtained direct from the clothing depot supplying the area,
prepayment will be required.
332. Public clothing will not be issued on payment except
when specially authorized by the War Office. All clothing so
sold will be specially marked as laid down in Appendix 10.
333. Personal clothing and necessaries required for the
Survey Battalion, R.E., will be issued in bulk on repayment
in accordance with the authorized scale.
334. Civilians employed in military prisons and detention
barracks as night watchmen, gatekeepers and cooks will
purchase from army store such articles of uniform of the
M.P.S.C. pattern as are specially authorized for them.
335. Discharged soldiers’ suits and greatcoats may be
issued on payment, at the discretion of the C. 0., to soldiers
allowed to wear plain clothes.
336. Clothing and necessaries in store at a R.A.O.C. depot
abroad may be supplied on repayment to European civilians
permanently employed by the W.D., but such issues will only
be made in reasonable quantities, and when the D.A.D.O.S.
is satisfied that suitable articles cannot be obtained from
civilian sources at the station.
337. Materials required for the use of families, either of
officers, of soldiers or of European civilian employees, will
only be supplied at stations abroad where materials suitable
for use cannot otherwise be obtained, and provided that the
quantities asked for are not excessive, and are required for
family use only. It will be explained on the indents why the
materials are demanded and the number of families for which
they are required. Such materials will only be issued at home
stations in exceptional circumstances, which will be explained
93


on the indent. Issues under this paragraph will only be made
if surplus to normal requirements at the station.
338. Clothing may, with the approval of the superior
authority, he issued on repayment to Colonial Governments,
subject to the conditions governing such issues laid down in
R.A.0.5., Part I.
Such issues will be subject to a charge of 7 per cent, over
vocabulary prices as well as to the additional rate referred to
in para. 339.
339. In the case of issues on repayment of clothing, neces-
saries or materials from store at stations abroad, an additional
rate, which will be communicated from time to time to the
stations concerned, will be added to the rate given in the
Vocabulary of Clothing and Necessaries. This additional rate
will not be charged to soldiers or to civilian employees under
the clothing allowance system in respect of repayment issues of
personal clothing and necessaries included in their authorized
scales.
94


CHAPTER XVI
LOSSES AND DAMAGES
340. Losses of and damages to clothing and necessaries
held on charge of units, other than the articles referred to
in para. 341, will be dealt with as laid down in K.R. All
reports to the G.0.C.-in-C. of such loss, damage, etc., will be
sent to the D.A.D.0.5., and will be accompanied by A.F.
G 998 in duplicate. The procedure outlined in E.R., Part 1,
will be followed as far as applicable.
341. Articles of public clothing issued to soldiers which are
lost or wilfully made away with by them, or prematurely
worn out through carelessness or neglect, will be replaced from
store by new or part-worn articles, and the soldier will be
placed under stoppages to make good the value of the lost
or wom-out articles (see also para. 89). The sum to be
recovered from the soldier will be 75 per cent, of the vocabulary
rate (plus the extra percentage to cover cost of freight at
stations abroad) unless it is established by evidence that the
actual value * at the time of the loss is greater or less, in which
case the actual value will be charged. In no case will less
than the wom-out value be charged. In the case of second
greatcoats (part-worn) issued under Scales 2, 4 and 18, the
vocabulary rate ” will be taken as half the value of a new
greatcoat.
342. When a C.O. is satisfied that the loss of or damage to
public clothing issued to individual soldiers is due to circum-
stances beyond a soldier’s control, and not to theft or malicious
damage, or to wear and tear consequent on inclement weather or
attendances at manoeuvres and camps, or to other con-
tingencies that come within the duty of a soldier, he may
authorize replacement or repairs, as the case may be, to the
extent of 3s. 6 d. for each article, but not exceeding £2 for the
unit on any occasion. If the cost exceeds this sum, the matter
will be submitted to the G.0.C.-in-C., to be dealt with as laid
down in K.R.
Actual value ” means the value to the W.D., and not the
disposal value. It will be determined by assessing the article at some
definite proportion of its vocabulary price, with the addition abroad of the
same proportion of the full extra charge for freight and transport.
95


343. Loss by theft of, or malicious damage to, public
clothing issued to a soldier will not be admitted as a charge
against the public, unless some person is convicted of the
offence.
344. Should any deficient article of public clothing for
which a charge has been made be subsequently recovered, a
refund of the amount so charged will be made, if authorized
by the G.0.C.-in-C. The refund will be supported by a
reference to the cash credit, and to the voucher and account
by which the returned article has been brought on charge.
345. Compensation for loss of, or damage to, articles of
personal clothing and necessaries in the possession of soldiers
will be dealt with under the provisions of Allowance Regula-
tions, Section XV. Any compensation awarded under those
regulations will be credited to the man’s account, which will
be charged with the value of any articles issued in replacement.
346. In the case of soldiers attached to the R.A.F. or of
airmen attached to army establishments, the cost of replace-
ments or repairs properly chargeable against the public will be
borne by the Department responsible for the individual’s pay.
96


CHAPTER XVII
INDENTS
347. Regimental indents for quantities estimated to be
required for the maintenance of three months’ stock of clothing
and necessaries [see para. 6) will be rendered monthly by
units on A.F. G 997 to the D.A.D.0.5., except that in the
case of units warned to proceed to another station, the
quantities will be limited to the requirements up to the date
of departure.
Intermediate indents will be avoided as much as possible
but, when rendered, they will be clearly described as such at
the head of the form, to distinguish them from the normal
monthly indents. A separate memorandum explaining the
necessity for their submission will accompany them.
348. In no circumstances will an indent be submitted foi
articles of a later pattern until stocks of the older pattern
are nearly exhausted (see para. 20). Care will be taken to
avoid accumulation of stocks of articles not likely to be
required (see paras. 6 and 10).
349. Indents will be completed in all details, and the
Instructions to the Vocabulary will be followed. Separate
sheets will be rendered for each vocabulary section concerned
mid a separate line will be used for each size of each article,
.tractions will be avoided as much as possible.
350. Normal monthly indents will not be accompanied by
covering letters, except when it is desired to make an explana-
tion or special remarks.
• 51 V In the r case of s P ecial size garments, a separate indent
m duplicate, for each type of garment required, accompanied
ky s P ecia l size rolls (A.Fs. H 1119) in duplicate for each man
will be submitted to the C. 0.0., Didcot, or C. 0.0., Woolwich
at least five weeks before the garments are required, a triplicate
copy of the indent being sent to the D.A.D.O.S. The require-
ments of more than one man may be shown on the same
indent, provided that all require the identical type of garments.
Any peculiarity in shape or build will Be carefully described on
A.Fs. H 1119.
In exceptional circumstances, when garments are required
in less than five weeks, the indent will be marked “ Urgent ”
4 (1175)


and the latest date by which delivery is required will be
shown.
352. The following certificate will be added to all indents
for special size garments :
“ Certified that the nearest stock size garments have been
tried on by the men concerned and that it is not practicable
for such garments to be altered to fit them
353. Hasteners (A.F. G 1063) for articles for which indents
have already been forwarded will be submitted to the
D.A.D.0.5., a separate sheet being used for each vocabulary
section. In the case of special size garments due from Didcot,
the hastener will be sent direct to C. 0.0., Didcot, and will
quote the control number and date previously notified by
post-card.
354. Indents for full dress garments of special sizes for issue
as public clothing to bandsmen, etc., will show the latest date
by which the supply is required, and will be rendered only
in time to admit of the issue when due. Indents for such
garments will not be submitted if the unit is within three
months of proceeding abroad, nor for men in the last three
months of their service. If the garments cannot, owing to
casualty or other circumstances, be taken into wear, a report
will at once be made to the D.A.D.0.5., who will ascertain
(see para. 10) whether the garments can be utilized by other
units in the area, with or without alteration, and report the
result with the particulars and estimated cost of any proposed
alterations to the D.D.0.5., who will issue the necessary
instructions for disposal.
355. Indents for boots and shoes of special size required at
home stations for men who, owing to abnormal foot measure-
ments, cannot be fitted from stock sizes will be submitted
direct to the C. 0.0., Didcot, a copy being sent to the
D.A.D.O.S. The indent will be accompanied by the measure-
ments and draft outlines of the men’s feet (see Appendix 7, b).
At stations abroad, such boots and shoes will be provided as
economically as possible by local purchase.
356. Indents for puttees, extra long (136 in.), will only be
submitted for men with abnormal length of leg or size of calf
for whom the ordinary puttees are too short.
357. Indents for clothing for drafts proceeding abroad will
be prepared as soon as orders are received for the preparation
of the drafts. The indents will show the latest date by which
supply is required, in order to ensure the necessary fitting and
marking before embarkation. Changes in numbers and sizes


arising after submission of the indents will be promptly-
notified to. the clothing depot supplying the area.
In the case of personnel proceeding to the Sudan, Indian
pattern helmets will be issued in lieu of the universal pattern,
and indents will indicate this requirement.
358. Company indents on A.Fs. H 1179, H 1179 a, H 1181
and H 1162 will be prepared and forwarded to the quarter-
master as directed in Appendix 1.
359. Clothing and necessaries for hospitals (including
station veterinary hospitals) will be supplied in the proportions
laid down in the Barrack and Hospital Schedules, except in the
case of the Royal Victoria Hospital, Netley, and Royal
Herbert Hospital, Woolwich, for which articles will be supplied
on the scales specially authorized.
360. Indents for clothing and necessaries for barracks,
hospitals, detention barracks and military prisons will be’
rendered by officers i/c barracks in accordance with the
instructions laid down in the Regulations for Supply
Transport and Barrack Services.
361 . Field dressings for instructional purposes, as prescribed
in K.R., will be obtained by units at home from the clothing
depot supplying the area, up to a maximum not exceeding 10
per cent, annually of peace establishment. At stations abroad,
units will obtain such field dressings from the R.A.O.C. at
the station. Dressings for instructional purposes need not be
brought on charge.


CHAPTER XVIII
CARRIAGE, RECEIPT, AND RETURN OF
STORES AND DISPOSAL OF EMPTIES
362. Instructions regarding the carriage, receipt and return
of stores are contained in E.R., Part 1, 1932, Chapter 11,
Section B, and Regulations for Supply, Transport and
Barrack Services.
363. When in special cases it is considered that articles are
liable to deteriorate after unpacking, the C.O. or other
responsible officer will cause the packages to be sealed, and
will use his discretion as to when they shall be opened. He
will sign and return the receipt voucher for the articles sent,
noting thereon that the packages have not been opened.
When the contents are ultimately required, the packages will
be opened in the presence of two officers. Any discrepancies
then discovered will be adjusted and investigated as laid down
in E.R., Part 1.
364. Articles damaged in transit will be dealt with in
accordance with E.R., Part 1.
365. Articles which have been exposed to infection will not
be sent to a clothing depot without thorough disinfection, and
the special authority of the officer in charge. The consignor
will in such cases certify on the vouchers that the articles
have been disinfected, as prescribed by regulations.
366. At stations in Great Britain, empty packing cases and
canvas wrappers received from the clothing depot will be
disposed of as follows :
(а) Cases not considered worth the cost of return will be
broken up and used as kindling wood under
instructions from the nearest officer i/c barracks,
whose receipt on A.F. G 1033 will be annexed to
the clothing account in which they are struck
off charge.
(б) Cases and wrappers in a serviceable condition will,
if their gross weight is not less than 1 cwt.,
be returned to the clothing depot supplying the
area, either direct or through the nearest 0.0., as
may be desirable on the ground of the cost of
carriage, under instructions from the local trans-
port officer. When transferred to the R.A.0.C.,


they will be taken on charge by the 0.0. Return
labels are enclosed in all packages sent out.
Wrappers and small cases will be enclosed in larger
cases, but all paper and string will be removed.
(i c) When the gross weight is less than 1 cwt., empty
packages and wrappers will be handed over to,
and taken on charge by, the nearest 0.0. for
disposal, the usual vouchers being passed.
367. Abroad, in Northern Ireland, and in the case of detach-
ments in Great Britain where there is insufficient storage
accommodation, empty packages will be handed over for dis-
posal as often as convenient to the R.A.0.C., or, if there is no
R.A.O.C. depot at the station, to the officer i/c barracks.
368. A sufficient stock of empty packing cases will be
retained by units for requirements on change of station.
369. The cases or packing materials for articles which have
been manufactured at detention barracks will be shown on
the inspection note, and struck off charge by detention barracks
on receipt of the duplicate reporting the result of the inspection
of the stores. A.F. G 1033 will not be required.


CHAPTER XIX
STOCKTAKING BOARDS
371. A regimental stocktaking board will be held
immediately before the account is sent for audit to verify the
“ remain ” of clothing and necessaries in store, as shown in
the ledgers (see para. 383), and to report on the numbers of
the articles. Unopened packages will be carefully examined
by the board to ascertain whether they have been tampered
with.
372. The C.O. may order a stocktaking board to be held on
the clothing and necessaries whenever he considers it desirable
to verify his charge. The report of these intermediate boards
will not be sent to the army auditor of the command or the
Under-Secretary of State, The War Office, unless the C.O.
desires to draw attention to any particular point.
373. On a change of command, the stocktaking board
referred to in para. 12 will normally be held, and the following
certificate signed by the incoming and outgoing officers,
except as laid down in the last sentence of para. 12 :
“ We certify, in accordance with para. 12 of Clothing
Regulations, 1936, that on the transfer of the clothing and
necessaries of the (a) on the (6) the whole has been
inspected by us and has been found to be properly appro-
priated, and in good condition, and to agree, in the quantities
and numbers of the several articles actually in possession,
with the balance shown in the clothing ledger, except the
items shown on the accompanying statement (c).
President
Members
Officer handing over charge.
Officer taking over charge.
(«) Here insert the unit. (6) Here insert the date.
(c) This statement should include the articles of public clothing in
possession of W.Os., N.C.Os. and men temporarily detached.”
The stocktaking board may be dispensed with if the officer
taking over charge considers it unnecessary, but he will then
be held fully responsible for the correctness of the clothing,


etc., taken over by him and will himself sign the form of
certificate shown above. Failure to sign such certificate will
not in any way relieve him of liability. The certificate will
accompany the clothing ledger when rendered for audit.
374. On a change of quarter-master, a stocktaking board
may be dispensed with by the C. 0., but a certificate should
be obtained from the incoming quarter-master that the stock
was in agreement with the ledger balance.
375. The board will count all articles in store, and will
compare the result with the “ remain ” in the ledgers, and
report any surplus or deficiency. It is necessary that the
whole board should count all the articles, so that each member,
if called upon to give evidence on oath, may be able to confirm,
from his own knowledge, the statements contained in the
proceedings of the board of survey.
376. Surplus articles in stock will at once be brought on
charge. A separate report regarding damaged or deficient
articles will be made by the president to the convening officer,
who will inform the G.0.C.-in-C., in order that he may take
steps under K.R. to decide on whom the value of the loss
or damage shall fall. The decision of the G.0.C.-in-C. will be
annexed to A.F. H 1164, or H 1164 a, when forwarded to the
army auditor or to the Under-Secretary of State, The War
Office. The absence of such report will not, however, relieve
the C.O. and the quarter-master from responsibility.
377. In small units, if there is a difficulty in assembling a
stocktaking board, the instructions contained in this chapter
will be carried out by the C. 0., whose certificate, on A.F.
H 1164 or H 1164 a, will be sufficient.
378. The report of the stocktaking board, or certificate
in lieu, will be forwarded under separate cover to the army
auditor of the command, or to the Under-Secretary of State
(F. 7), The War Office, at the same time as the clothing ledger
is sent for audit.

383. The ledgers will be balanced for comparison with the
stock remaining in store when the account is required for
audit, on change of command, on change of quarter-master,
and whenever the C.O. considers it desirable to have the stock
verified by a board (see Chapter XIX). Except in cases
of an urgent nature, no issues will be made on the days on
which the ledgers are balanced and the stock counted.
384. Charges sanctioned by regulation may be paid on the
authority of the C.O. without pre-audit. Charges for repairs
authorized under paras. 342 and 364 will be supported by the
report of the board of survey, and the authority for the execu-
tion of the repairs.
385. Bills for articles provided locally under special authority
will be accompanied by a copy of the authority and the C.O’s.

account in which they are brought on charge and the number
of the voucher will also be stated on the bill,

of units will be made by officers deputed for the purpose by
the Under-Secretary of State, The War Office. C.Os. will

APPENDIX 1
COMPANY INDENTS FOR CLOTHING AND
NECESSARIES AND STOPPAGES FOR LOSS
OF PUBLIC CLOTHING
(Referred to in paras. 19 and 353)
For units having Quarter-masters
1. Indents for free issues of personal clothing and necessaries
(A.F. H 1179 for recruits and A.F. H 1179 a for other soldiers)
will be rendered monthly in duplicate by companies to the
quarter-master for the articles actually required ; articles not
required until after three months’ service —see para. 36—will
be included in the indent for the month in which the articles
are required. An explanation of the reason for free issues
to soldiers other than recruits will be given on A.F. H 1 179 a.
After the issues have been made, the quarter-master will
prepare a consolidated A.F. H 1179 (or A.F. H 1179 a)
showing the total number of each article issued and will obtain
thereon the signature of the O.C. company in acknowledgment
of the receipt of the articles. This form will be retained by the
quarter-master.
On the 27th day of the month the quarter-master, after
posting the issues in the clothing ledger, will insert on the
top of the indent the relevant issue voucher number, and
send both copies to the company. When the certificates and
receipts have been signed, the O.C. company will forward one
copy to the R.P., to examine and retain as a voucher to the
company account. The second copy will be retained by the O.C.
company and preserved in a guard book. In this copy only
will the soldier sign for the receipt of the articles. The date
of receipt will also be inserted.
2. Indents for personal clothing and necessaries on payment
(A.F. H 1181) will be rendered monthly by companies to
quarter-masters, who will enter the current prices of the
articles indented for and the amounts due from each man.
After the issues have been made, the quarter-master will enter
on a copy of A.F. H 1181 the total number of each article
issued, and will obtain the signature of the O.C. company on
the form in acknowledgment of receipt of the articles. This
copy will be retained by the quarter-master, On the 21st


day of the month the quarter-master will complete the
original indent, and, after posting the issues in the clothing
ledger, will insert the relevant issue voucher number at the
top of the form and will return it to the company. The
soldier will sign on the form for the receipt of the articles
and will also insert the date of issue.
This form, together with A.F. H 1181 a showing the total
number of each article sold, their value and the total amount
to be recovered from the company, will be forwarded as early
as possible, and in no case later than the 23rd day of the
month, to the R.P. for pre-audit. A.F. H 1181 will be re-
turned by the paymaster within three days to the O.C. com-
pany, who will charge the amounts against the men in the
pay list, and credit the total to the public in the company
account. This form will be rendered with the company
account, and will be certified and returned by the paymaster
to the company commander, for preservation in a guard book,
after the company account has been audited. A.F. H 1181 a
will be retained by the paymaster as a voucher to the company
account.
3. If it is necessary to issue any articles before the indent
is closed, the quarter-master will obtain a temporary receipt
for them on A.F. G 1033. When the indent has been com-
pleted and the certificates signed, these temporary receipts will
be given up and destroyed.
4. Necessaries required by regimental institutes for sale
to soldiers will be indented for in bulk on A.F. P 1925, in
quadruplicate by the committee of management from the
quarter-master. At the end of each month, the quarter-master,
after posting the issues in the clothing ledger and inserting on
the forms the number of the issue voucher to the clothing
account, will forward the original and duplicate copies, with
demand slip (A.F. P 1921) affixed, to the committee of manage-
ment, and the triplicate copy to the C.P. When payment
has been received, the C.P. will endorse the duplicate copy
with a reference to the account in which credit has been given
to the public and return it to the unit. The triplicate copy
will be retained by the C.P. to support his account.
5. Indents for public clothing on A.F. H 1152 will be sent in
duplicate to the quarter-master whenever necessary. On
the 27th of the month, that officer will forward the form to
the O.C. company for completion and signature. One copy
will be sent to the R.P. for examination and retention as a
voucher to the company account. The other copy will be
retained by the company officer.


6. Indents from companies detached from headquarters will
be forwarded as directed in the preceding paragraphs. The
clothing and necessaries indented for will be despatched by the
quarter-master as soon as possible after the articles have been
marked. The O.C. company will make his own arrangements
for fitting the personal clothing or, if the company is at a con-
venient distance from headquarters, the tailor may be sent with
the clothing, and he will bring back any articles that require
alterations.
7. A return by companies will be prepared in duplicate on
A.F. P 1954, showing the names of soldiers placed under
stoppages for public clothing during the month, and the
amounts recoverable. Nil returns will not be required. The
A.F. P 1954, after being priced by the quarter-master, will
be forwarded to the R.P. for pre-audit at the same time as
A.F. H 1181 (see para. 2). One copy will be returned within
three days to the company commander to charge the amount
against the soldier in the pay list and credit it to the public
in the company account. This copy will be rendered to the
R.P. with the company account, and, after it has been enfaced
to the effect that credit has been given to the public, will
be returned to the company commander for retention. The
other copy, similarly enfaced in regard to the cash credit refer-
ence, will be retained by the paymaster as a voucher to the
company account.
For units not having Quarter-masters
8. In units not having quarter-masters, the foregoing in-
structions will be carried out by the O.C. unit, but the copy of
the indent referred to in paras. 1 and 2, prepared by the
quarter-master, will not be required.

RECEIPTS
ISSUES
* Articles issued to companies and struck off charge on the issue side
of Section 111 will be brought on charge as in wear on the receipt side of
Section IV.


3. In units of more than one company, the entries on
A.Fs. H 1179, H 1179 a, H 1181 and H 1152 will be posted
from the company indents and not from the consolidated
vouchers.
4. Officers will take care that the ledgers and vouchers are
not ticked or altered with coloured pencil or coloured ink,
that no correspondence is carried on upon them and that no
erasures are made. No entries in black lead pencil will be
shown either in the ledgers or on the vouchers. Any necessary
corrections will be made in black ink, and will be duly initialled,
in the case of vouchers by the person who signs the vouchers,
and in the case of ledgers by the responsible accounting
officer, but the original entries should remain legible.
5. The ledgers and other records will be posted daily, as the
transactions occur. Every entry will be supported by a
voucher, or by a reference to a corresponding entry in another
section of the ledger, and the number of the voucher will
always be quoted. In cases where it is necessary to put up
blank vouchers to account for missing numbers, a brief
explanation of the circumstances, signed by an officer, will be
given on the blank vouchers. The addition of letters or sub-
numbers to the numbers of vouchers is prohibited.
6. All articles received will be at once brought on charge in
the clothing ledger, irrespective of the year for which they
may have been demanded, or in which they are intended to be
used.
7. All baling material and packages (except used tin cases,
which may be destroyed) received with clothing and neces-
saries will be brought on charge in the ledger. The canvas
in the wrappers of bales will be computed at three yards per
bale for home stations and six yards for abroad, except in the
case of small bales of mobilization clothing, which will be com-
puted at one yard each for jackets, pantaloons and trousers,
and two yards for greatcoats.
8. Tools for marking will be accounted for in the equipment
ledger.
9. The second greatcoats (part worn) issued under Scales
2, 5 and 18, or as may be specially authorized, will be
accounted for separately from other coats. Greatcoats will
only be “ written down ” for wear as “ second ” coats on the
authority of a Board (see R.A.0.5., Part I), and A.F. H 1155
will be suitably amended in such cases.
10. Working and waterproof clothing in use at the School of
Military Engineering and the Artillery Schools will be shown


in a separate ledger, which will be forwarded for audit annually
to the army auditor of the command.
11. Public clothing issued or transferred to the Survey
Battalion, R.E., will be brought on charge at the headquarters
at Southampton.
12. Working clothing supplied for use in electric light duties
will be accounted for in the general clothing ledger (A.B. 284
or 285).
13. Badges, buttons, chevrons, footstraps, shoulder straps
and titles, when'supplied apart from the garments, will be
brought on charge separately in the columns provided for the
purpose. Buttons, Royal Arms, removed from service dress
jackets before issue will be brought on charge by a certificate
receipt voucher, a reference to the receipt vouchers being
given on the vouchers on which the jackets are struck off
charge.
Full dress head-dresses for all ranks will be shown in one
column.
14. Colour badges, crowns, footstraps, shoulder straps and
similar articles, which are not shown separately in the company
indents, will be entered in the ledger as issued for the corre-
sponding number of garments for which they are necessary.
The articles composing a kit of necessaries for the various
services will be entered in the ledger for each kit shown as
issued in the company indents.
15. The entries striking off charge unserviceable articles,
or showing when disposed of, will be supported by the docu-
ments mentioned in Chapter VI.
16. A separate account will be kept of leather pantaloons
and jack boots in the Household Cavalry. The account will
show the date and cost of all repairs. This account will be
subsidiary to the clothing ledger (which will show the articles
in bulk only), and will be inspected by the board of survey
referred to in para. 81 of these regulations when inquiring into
repairs or renewals.
17. Tunics issued to recruits of the Brigade of Guards under
the conditions of para. 38 of these regulations will be transferred
from Section I to Section IV of the clothing ledger, the transfer
being supported by a separate A.F. H 1152, enfaced “ Per-
sonal clothing issued under para. 38, Clothing Regulations,
1936 ”, When the debit against the man’s account becomes
due, the tunic will be written off in Section IV, supported
by a separate A.F. H 1181, headed “Section IV—Tunics
issued under para. 38, Clothing Regulations, 1936 ”.


18. la units having quarter-masters, a ledger (A.B. 165)
will be kept in which will be recorded the public clothing in
possession of companies or detachments. This book is the
quarter-master’s record of articles issued to and received
from companies.
19. The receipt side of A.B. 165 will start with the total
number of each article in possession of the company. The
postings on the receipt side will be made—
(a) from the company indent on A.F. H 1152 ;
(&) from an abstract of the clothing transfer statements
received for men posted from other units (A.F.
G 1033) or from a certificate receipt voucher if no
A.F. G 1033 is received.
The postings on the issue side will be made—
(a) from the company issue voucher (A.F. G 1033) for
articles returned to store ;
(b) from an abstract of the clothing transfer statements
sent for men posted to other units (A.F. G 1033) ;
(c) from A.Fs. B 115 and P 1954 for losses, etc.
20. A.Fs. B 292 or 293, showing the public clothing in
possession of squadrons, companies or detachments, will be
rendered quarterly to the'O.C. unit, who will compare the
numbers shown in the returns with those in A.B. 165.
21. When a unit proceeds to India, the clothing ledger will
be closed and forwarded for audit as directed in para. 26 of
this appendix. Application will be made to the army auditor
for any special instructions.
22. Clothing ledgers will be balanced, for comparison with
the stock remaining in store, on the occasions mentioned in
para. 383 of these regulations.
23. Before the ledger is closed, the balance of packages in
each section will be transferred to Section IV.
24. The ledger will be balanced by bringing the total issues
in each section to the receipts side and deducting them from
the total receipts ; the “ remain ” will be the numbers for
which the accountant is responsible. Immediately under this
“remain" will be inserted the numbers in store as actually
counted by the stocktaking board and recorded in its report
and, in the case of Section IV, the numbers actually in wear
determined in accordance with para. 28 of this appendix.
The difference between the "remain” and the actual stock
(including issues not posted and, in the case of Section IV, the


numbers actually in wear) will be shown as “ surplus ” or
“ deficient ”, as the case may be.
25. The numbers in store, as certified by the stocktaking
board, and the numbers actually in wear, as shown in the
statement referred to in para. 28 of this appendix, will be
carried forward to the next account.
26. The clothing ledger will remain open and in use until
called for by the army auditor or War Office (F. 7) for audit.
When so called for, the ledger will be balanced and closed ;
stock will be taken and a new ledger will be opened, with the
figures referred to in para. 25. After audit, the ledger will be
returned to the unit for retention, but the vouchers, etc., will
be retained by the army auditor or the War Office (F. 7).
27. When the clothing ledger is forwarded for audit, it will
be accompanied by all vouchers and bills for articles received
or purchased, and all vouchers for articles struck off charge
(except when the original has been sent to the paymaster),
together with the documents referred to in para. 261 of these
regulations and para. 28 of this Appendix, and para. 21 of
Appendix 11.
28. A statement showing the public clothing in wear will be
attached to the report of the stocktaking board, with a cer-
tificate that the numbers shown are (in the case of units of
more than one company) a correct total of the balances in
possession of each company as shown in A.B. 165, or that
(in units of one company only) they have been verified by
comparison with the numbers actually in wear.
29. A.B. 165 will be balanced on the same date and in the
same manner as the general ledger. The “ remain ”in posses-
sion of each company will be carried to a recapitulation, and
the total numbers of each article will be compared with the
"remain” shown in Section IV of the general ledger, with
which they should correspond.
30. Any amendment of the opening balance of the new ledger
rendered necessary by the audit of the old one will be carried
out by means of certificate vouchers, and not by alteration of
the original figures.
31. A list of the articles taken on Imperial charge in accord-
ance with para. 221 of these regulations by units returning
from India will be attached as an opening voucher to the
clothing ledger.


32. In cases where a separate ledger is maintained for
mobilization equipment, the stocks of clothing and neces-
saries held for reservists will be accounted for ip A.B. 239 b
(Infy.) or .A.B. 164 a (Cav.). See E.R., Part I, 1932, Appendix I,
para. 2.
In other cases, clothing and necessaries held for reservists
will be accounted for in A.B. 284 a, which will be kept in
original only as a continuous account. This account will be
balanced and rendered for audit at the same time as the
ordinary peace clothing ledger, the “ remain ” at the end of
each period being shown immediately below the last trans-
action on each folio. After audit, the ledger will be returned
to the unit, and will be continued in use until completely
filled.

on account of their number, be suspended from the bar so as
to be fully seen, they will overlap.
Medals awarded by the Royal Humane Society or by the'
Royal National Lifeboat Institution will, when authorized,
be worn in a corresponding position on the right breast.
2. The ribbons worn with the medals will be 1 inch in
length, unless the possession of clasps necessitates their being
longer. When two or more medals are worn, they will be so
arranged that the lower edges are in line. The length of all

any clasps, is the longest.
3. When ribbons are worn without medals, the ribbons will

APPENDIX 7
INSTRUCTIONS FOR FITTING GARMENTS
{Referred to in Chapter XIV.)
A.—Clothing.
1. Jackets of all descriptions will be fitted loosely over a
jersey, pullover, so as to admit of extra clothing being
worn in cold weather and to allow for possible shrinkage of
material. In fitting recruits and men returning from abroad,
full allowance for future development should be made. In
fitting khaki drill clothing, the jacket should be 1 inch longer
than usual in the length of the sleeves and back, and the
trousers should be 1 inch longer than usual in the length of
leg, to allow for shrinkage. These allowances must not be
disregarded by the alteration of new khaki drill garments to
the usual length of sleeve, etc., since the garments will shrink
to this extent when washed. Overall clothing will not be
altered.
2. Pantaloons, when fitted, will be tight below the knee,
easy over the knee-cap and loose round the thigh.
3. Cloaks and greatcoats for trained soldiers will be fitted
over the jacket; the bottoms of the back of the garments
should be the following distances from the ground :
Cloak ... ... ... ... ... ... 9£ inches.
Greatcoat, blue grey ... ... ... 13J ~
~ dismounted ... ... ... 16J „
(If the man is not wearing boots, the above distances should
be reduced by inches in each case.)
Recruits and growing lads will be fitted with cloaks or
greatcoats of the next higher group of sizes, e.g. dismounted
men whose heights are 5 feet 5 inches or 5 feet 6 inches will
receive greatcoats sized for men of 5 feet 7 inches and 5 feet
8 inches, to allow for subsequent growth in height and bulk.
B.—Boots and Shoes
4. The proper fitting of boots and shoes, on which the march-
ing of an army depends, is a matter of the first importance,


The best test for the correct fitting of a boot or shoe is whether
it is comfortable or not, and this consideration should outweigh
any other.
Ankle boots stamped with the date “ 1932 ” and onwards
5. Size (fir length). —The size of the boots required should be
ascertained by the use of the stick, size, direct measurement.
When being measured, the. man should wear army socks and
should stand with the bulk of his weight on the foot which
is being measured. Should the sliding arm of the measure-
ment stick not rest exactly on a division, the next larger size
should be taken.
Fitting (or width). —Army boots are made in three fittings—
small, medium and large. The soldier should be allowed
to choose, from the three fittings for his particular size, the
one which is the most comfortable to wear.
6. For guidance in doubtful cases, however, the following
notes are given :
(i) Instep. —lf a boot is loose over the instep, the wearer’s
foot may work to and fro in the boot as he marches,
and cause a sore heel. On the other hand, tight
lacing, in an effort to make the boot close in front,
will result in discomfort. The boot, when first worn,
should not quite meet in front when laced up.
(ii) Tread. —lf the boot is squeezed between the thumb and
forefinger across the toe joint, there should be no
appreciable looseness.
7. Should it be impossible to fit a man comfortably from
any fitting of the size which, according to his length measure-
ments, he ought to take, he may be tried with a size smaller
or larger, but in this case particular care should be taken to
see that there is neither undue tightness nor undue play.
8. In no circumstances should a man be allowed to take a
boot more than one size removed from his proper size. Such a
case should be met by an indent for a boot made to special
measurements, in which case the measurements, as shown in
the diagram overleaf, are required in addition to the size, and a
draft outline of each foot, taken under the conditions mentioned


in para. 5. It is essential, however, that these measurements
be taken by a shoemaker.
Highland shoes and pre- 1932 ankle boots
9. The above instructions will be followed. The man’s size
will be taken from the stick, size, direct measurement, and the
most comfortable fitting will be determined by trial of the
boots or shoes. If the size shown on the measuring stick is
not comfortable, the man should be given an opportunity of
trying the next larger size.
Shoes, canvas
10. Shoes, canvas, are supplied in one fitting only. The size
to be demanded should correspond with the size of the ankle
boot.
Boots, Wellington, and boots, sea.
11. If these boots are required to be specially made, the
calf measurements and the height of leg must be given in
addition to the ordinary measurements.

APPENDIX 11
CARE, PRESERVATION AND CLEANING OF
CLOTHING, ETC., AND TREATMENT OF
INFECTED CLOTHING
A.— Care and Preservation
( a) Clothing and Necessaries in Store
1. All clothing and necessaries will be kept in dry, well-
aired storehouses or rooms, and protected against damage by
rats and mice.
2. The following precautions should be taken to prevent
damage by moth :
Articles liable to damage. —These consist of articles made
from the hair of animals, i.e. woollen or felt goods, bristle
brushes, fur, horsehair, etc.
Articles made from vegetable fibres, such as linen or cotton
goods, fibre brushes, etc., are immune.
Protection. —Nothing is so efficacious as a complete and
intact covering of ordinary brown paper, but it must be devoid
of holes and tears, and folded over where the ends join ; moths
are unable to penetrate such paper, but, if there is any hole,
however small, they will probably discover it and deposit
their eggs on the materials underneath.
A sprinkling of naphthalene is also useful, as moths dislike
the odour. It is unnecessary, however, to smother articles
in naphthalene.
Moths dislike light and heat, and prefer cool, dark places.
Cure. —If the articles affected are few, it is sufficient to hang
them up in the sun and to brush them vigorously with a stiff
brush, as the larvae adhere tenaciously to the material on which
they live.
As moths in the egg or larval stage are difficult to detect,
the above precautions should be taken if any doubt exists as
to whether articles are infested.
If a building is infested by moths, application should be
made to "the medical authorities, with a view to its fumigation
after the removal of its contents for treatment.
3. Naphthalene for the preservation of clothing and neces-
saries in store will be supplied by the R.A.O.C. on indent as
follows:


For each unit holding f2O lb. annually for regiments, bat-
stocks of clothing and talions or regimental depots, 5 lb.
necessaries I annually for other units.
Double the above quantities will be drawn by units at
stations abroad.
An additional allowance, as laid down in Appendix 14, is
authorized for the preservation of reservists’ clothing.
4. In the tropics, where white ant and " woolly bear ” are
prevalent, clothing should be stacked on iron plates or girders
resting on iron blocks 12 to 18 inches in height, and the blocks
kept freshly coated with tar.
At stations abroad, field dressings will be kept in tin-lined
cases.
5. Buttons on scarlet frocks and tunics in store will be kept
covered with ordinary tissue paper to prevent the scarlet cloth
being stained, care being taken to keep the tissue paper from
contact with any gold lace embroidery.
6. Oilskin clothing and sou'wester hats in store will be
hung up in a cool, dry storehouse, exposed to a current of air.
If folded or packed one on the other, these garments are
liable to become “ tacky ” and to stick together.
7. Articles of clothing containing rubber will be stored in a
cool, dark place, having, if possible, an even temperature.
8. Boots and shoes, half soles, bends, lifts, tip fillings, belts
and other leather will be kept in a cool, well-aired room, at
an even temperature. Dust absorbs the greases and dressings
used in the leather, starving or hardening it, and heat causes
the leather to dry out, lose weight and become denatured.
These articles, whether in packing cases or not, must not be
placed near any heating apparatus.
9. Boots and shoes with uppers of chrome leather do not
require to be dubbed, neither is there any need to open
cases for inspection unless they have been subject to con-
ditions conducive to the growth of moulds. Chrome leather
is liable to “ spue ’’ in storage, becoming covered with a white
film resembling mould, but instead of possessing the musty
odour characteristic of moulds, it has a “ soap-like ” smell.
Mould should be removed with a greasy brush, but spue need
not be removed as it does no harm and will cease to exude
when the boots are taken into wear.
(6) Colours, etc.. State Clothing, etc.. Gold and Silver Lace or
Embroidery.
10. Colours, standards, guidons, drum-major’s belts, drum
and trumpet banners, state clothing, and all articles with lace.


embroidery, etc., containing gold or silver, will be kept in store
completely wrapped in “ Paper brown tissue gold lace ”
(obtainable from the Stationery Office in 18 in. by 22 in.
sheets) in air-tight chests. After use, these articles should be
carefully brushed with a clean, soft brush, completely covered
with the brown tissue paper referred to above and replaced
in the cases and chests provided for them, or in air-tight
chests. Care should be taken to ensure that the paper used is
thoroughly dry, and that the cases and chests are stored in a
dry place.
11. Gold and silver lace, etc., should never be placed in
contact with commercial brown or white tissue papers, which
may contain reactive sulphur compounds.
B.— Cleaning and Removing Stains from Garments
{a) General Instructions
12. No expense for the provision of any materials for clean-
ing, etc., or for the labour involved will be allowed as a charge
against the public, except for new garments, etc., found to be
stained on receipt, and the articles mentioned in para. 79,
when the cost will be charged against the public.
13. Garments and caps which have become dirty or soiled
in store or in wear should be well brushed and then cleaned
with a stiff nail-brush dipped in hot water in which yellow soap
has been dissolved.
For stains caused by solids or liquids which have contained
sugar, e.g. tea or coffee, a little methylated spirit should be
rubbed lightly over the garment or stained parts with a clean
brush.
{b) Scarlet Clothing
14. (i) It is essential to remember that scarlet cloth, either
as a garment or as a trimming, requires special treatment.
Salts of sorrel or oxalic acid should never be used on scarlet
clothing.
(ii) Button or hook stains. —Rub dry pipe-clay over the
stained part and brush with a clean hard brush.
(iii) Oil and grease stains. —-First place a piece of white
blotting paper underneath the stain, after removing the lining
if possible. Then rub the stain lightly towards the centre with
a piece of scarlet or white cloth or a clean brush, saturated
with trichlorethylene spirit. If the stain still persists, let
the spirit run over and off the stain and then rub lightly as
above. Do not rub in continuously as excessive rubbing
tends to remove the dye.
If necessary, repeat the treatment when dry.


(iv) Gummy or sticky stains, i.e. caused by sugar, jam, etc.
These should be first washed with warm water (in no instance
should hot water be used). Afterwards, when thoroughly
dry, treat as above.
(v) Pressing. —A garment which has been cleaned thoroughly
will, after being hung to dry in the open air, have a rough
appearance ; it should then be pressed with a warm iron and
a dry press cloth. A very hot iron or damp press cloth must
not be used, as these have the effect of darkening the scarlet
shade.
(c) Blue Clothing
15. Oil or grease stains may be treated in a similar manner
with trichlorethylene spirit or with a weak solution of
ammonia. In no case should ammonia be applied to scarlet
or delicate shades.
(d) Khaki Clothing
16. Any of the above methods can be applied.
17. Soiled leather strappings of pantaloons can be cleaned
with a weak solution of ammonia, which should be placed in a
saucer and applied with a clean brush or cloth. If ammonia
is not available, petrol may be used.
Soda should never be used.
N.B. —Trichlorethylene must be stored in the dark and,
when in use, should not be exposed to direct sunlight. Not
more than is required for immediate use should be withdrawn
at one time. If a pungent odour develops, shake vigorously
with chalk (carbonate of lime) until the normal odour is
restored, and filter before use. Windows of rooms in which
the cleaning is carried out will be opened to ensure good
ventilation ; men using trichlorethylene should not be allowed
to smoke.
C.—Washing Flannels and Woollens
18. Flannel shirts, worsted socks, woollen drawers, etc.,
should be washed in lukewarm water and never in boiling or
hot water, as this shrinks the material. A tablespoonful of
ammonia added to every two gallons of water will remove
grease and perspiration stains.
Good quality yellow soap only should be used and, after
washing, the garments should be well rinsed in clean tepid
water and stretched by hand before drying.
Washing powders should not be used.


D.—Treatment of Clothing Infested with Vermin,
etc.
19. Articles not liable to be damaged by steam will be dis-
infested in a steam disinfector of any authorized pattern, the
instructions appropriate to each type of machine being strictly
observed.
20. Articles liable to be damaged by steam will be disin-
fested in a hot-air disinfector. For complete disinfestation
every part of each article must be exposed to a temperature
of 70° C. (158° F.) for 30 minutes.
21. Clothing or necessaries which may have been exposed to
infectious disease will be dealt with as directed in the Regula-
tions for the Medical Services of the Army. If the articles are
destroyed, the authority of the G.0.C.-in-C. or of the medical
officer, as the case may be, will be attached to the account, in
support of any credit to the soldier in respect of the value *
of the personal clothing and necessaries destroyed, and the
striking off charge of public clothing replaced.
22. Clothing and necessaries worn or used by a soldier
attending animals suffering from contagious disease will not
be destroyed without the special authority in writing of the
0.C., supported by a veterinary certificate.
If they are ordered to be destroyed, the procedure will be
as in para. 21.
APPENDIX 12
INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE REPAIR OF BOOTS
AND SHOES IN WEAR
{-Referred to in para. 316)
1. Ankle boots and Highland shoes are constructed with two
soles :
(а) The under sole, which is riveted to the upper.
(б) The outer sole, which is stitched and screwed to the
.under sole.
2. Wear can be stayed in its earlier stages by the prompt
replacement of worn or missing heel and toe tips. In no
circumstances should boots or shoes be dried before a fire or
* Assessed under Allowance Regulations, para. 740.


placed near a radiator or cooking range, as this will result in
permanent injury to them. They can be effectively dried by
being stuffed with crumpled newspaper and placed in a current
of air.
3. Outer soles should be replaced as soon as worn through,
so as to preserve the under-sole from damage. Soles cracked
through boots and shoes being placed close to fires or stoves
should be replaced immediately.
4. Particular care should be taken to repair without delay
any break in the upper or the upper seams.
5. All repairs to leather boots and shoes (other than jack
boots and magazine boots and shoes) will conform to the
following specification, copies of which will be supplied to the
contractors carrying out repairs.
Specification for the Repair of Boots and Shoes
(a) Worn or faulty heel tips, tip fillings and lifts will be

will be signed by the man as a receipt for the articles. Sizes
of articles will not be inserted on this form.
5. The numbers of kits to be held by each unit are as
follows ;
(i) Cavalry regiments at home. —6oo (except cap badges and
titles *) to be handed over on change of station to the
incoming cavalry regiment.
(ii) Regimental depots and units with over 500 reservists on
the books. —The nearest 50 above or below the
actual number of reservists ; this figure will only be
adjusted when the total number of reservists rises
or falls by a complete 50 from the number of kits
already held.f
(iii) Units with less than 500 reservists on the books. —The
nearest 25 above or below the actual number of
reservists ; this figure will only be adjusted when

7. Sizeable articles will be held on a fixed percentage of
stock sizes to be based on anticipated requirements and peace
experience (not on the actual measurements of individual
reservists) ; the percentage of each size may be varied slightly
to admit of storage in complete bales, etc., as laid down in
para. 9, due regard being paid to the additional 10 per cent,
of certain articles authorized in para. 6.
" Special size ” articles will not be held, and will not be
obtained until mobilization (see para. 4, Appendix 15). In the
case of the Foot Guards, however, such articles may be held for
men over 6 feet 2 inches in height.
8. Clothing and necessaries held for reservists will not be
marked until after issue.
Method of Storage
9. The whole of the clothing and necessaries will normally
be issued and stored in bulk in the full size bales or cases
received from the clothing depots (except that bales and cases
of “ mixed contents ” may be broken down if this is considered
more convenient, and the items stacked in the same racks or
bays as other similar items).
Smaller bales containing numbers as shown below will,
however, be specially issued (if specified on the indent) to
meet the requirements of units whose turnover of any par-
ticular article or size is not large enough for the issue of full
size bales :
* In the case of greatcoats, jackets, pantaloons and trousers, each bale
will contain garments of one size and description, except that sizes for men
of 5 feet 11 inches and upwards will, if convenient, be packed together
in bales of ten.


Other articles will similarly be specially issued in cases or
bales packed with smaller quantities, when the full size bale is
too large.
10. The bales and cases will be stored so that the marking
showing the description, size, number of articles and date of
packing is clearly visible.
Turnover
11. A record of the dates marked on bales, packages, etc.,
held for reservists will be kept in S.O. 136.
12. Turnover will, as far as possible, be carried out by units
as a routine matter by replacing complete bales or packages
held for reservists by bales, etc., of similar articles bearing
later dates of packing received in satisfaction of normal
indents to meet peace requirements. Articles will not be
used for normal issues until similar articles have been received
to replace them.
13. The dates of packing marked on all bales and packages
to be issued by the C. 0.0., Didcot, during the ensuing half-
year are published in Army Council Instructions every six
months. On receipt of this information, units will submit to
the D.A.D.O.S. a return on A.F. H 1178 showing particulars
of all bales, etc., of earlier dates of packing held for reservists.
The D.A.D.O.S. will then arrange turnover as far as possible.
14. Units will enter in the Turnover Book (A.B. 333) any
items that are considered to have deteriorated or that
require to be specially turned over, irrespective of the date
shown on the package. This army book will be examined
quarterly by the D.A.D.O.S. and will be produced at all
inspections of reservists’ kits.
15. When D.A.Ds.O.S. are unable to effect turnover in the
normal manner, they will bring to the notice of the C. 0.0.,
Didcot, any items stored for reservists that have been packed
for more than 5 years (3 years in the case of canvas shoes), or
that for any other reason require to be turned over specially ;
full details and dates will be given in such cases.
16. In the case of units stationed in the Aldershot Command,
the instructions in paras. 11 to 14 will be modified as may be
ordered locally.
Care and Preservation
17. In order to ensure that articles held for reservists are
kept in good condition, the following instructions will be
observed :


(a) Cases or bales of boots will be opened at least once every
12 months, and the boots treated as laid down in
para. 9 of Appendix 11.
\b) Knives, forks and spurs will be wiped with an oiled
rag once a year, or more frequently if necessary.
Spur straps will be greased once a year with melted
dubbin.
(c) Articles found to be defective at the periodical examina-
tion will be exchanged.
18. An annual allowance of 3 lb. of dubbin and, if certified
on the indent to be necessary, 1 lb. of naphthalene for every
100 kits will be issued by the R.A.O.C. for the preservation of
reservists’ boots, clothing and necessaries.
Inspection
19. Reservists’ kits stores will be inspected by the D. A.D.O.S.
annually and by the A.D.O.S. as considered necessary. The
results of the inspections will be reported on A.F. G 1097 to
the headquarters of the command, but will not be transmitted
to the War Office unless desired by the G.0.C.-in-C.
APPENDIX 15
INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING THE ISSUE OF
CLOTHING AND NECESSARIES ON MOBILI-
ZATION AND ON RECEIPT OF ORDERS FOR
ACTIVE SERVICE
[Referred to in para. 16)
A.-— Action to be Taken on Mobilization
(See also Mobilization Regulations)
Clothing and Necessaries for Serving Soldiers
1. Articles of clothing and necessaries in possession of
serving soldiers will be maintained on the appropriate peace
scale (modified as may be specially ordered) until the receipt
of orders to proceed on active service.
2. From the date of mobilization, the issue and wear-
ing of full dress clothing will be discontinued, except as
specially authorized by the War Office.


3. Helmets, bearskin caps and feather bonnets in possession
of the Household Cavalry and Foot Guards will be returned
to the C. 0.0., Woolwich.
Clothing and Necessaries for Reservists
4. Reservists’ kits will be issued to reservists on mobiliza-
tion ; any additional articles required (including " special
size ” articles) will be obtained from unit’s three months’
peace stock, or by exchanges with neighbouring units, or
by indent from the clothing depot supplying the area. If
necessary, special size boots may be purchased locally at a
price not exceeding the vocabulary rate.
The kits will be maintained by the men on the scales laid
down in Appendix 14, or on a modified scale as may be specially
ordered.
Chevrons, badges and titles issued with the garments will
be put on under regimental arrangements as soon as possible
after issue.
5. Reservists will make their own arrangements for the
disposal of their civilian clothes.
Clothing and Necessaries for the Territorial Army
6. Initial issues of clothing and necessaries to men of the
T.A. to complete them to the scale authorized for regular
soldiers of the same arm of the service will be made as laid down
in T.A. Regulations.
7. Replacements of all clothing and necessaries will be dealt
with in accordance with the system in force in the Regular
Army (see Chapters II to V), except that, in the case of serving
personnel called up on embodiment, articles of personal cloth-
ing, drawers and jerseys, pullover, will be repaired or replaced
free when necessary through fair wear and tear, and no cloth-
ing allowance will be drawn —see also para. 14 of this appendix.
Fitting and Marking
8. Service dress clothing will be fitted loosely, as explained
in Appendix 7 ; fitting with the exactitude usual in peace
will not be necessary. Alterations on mobilization will be
restricted to work which is indispensable to obtain a tolerable
fit, and for which time permits. No charges in respect of
fitting will be made against the soldier.
9. As far as time permits, clothing and necessaries will be
marked only with the army number of the soldier and the


initials of the regiment or corps ; no marking which refers to
the battalion, etc., will be made.
Identity Discs
10. Identity discs held for serving soldiers and reservists
as directed in para. 66 of these regulations will be issued to
the former by their C.Os. on mobilization and to the latter
at the place of joining.
The discs held for officers under para. 67 of these regulations
will also be issued.
Issues to Officers, etc.
11. Officers may obtain, on prepayment, from regimental
store any articles of clothing and necessaries of army pattern,
provided that the quantities are not excessive and are re-
quired as articles of clothing to be maintained by an officer
for military purposes. Articles of pattern special to officers
cannot be supplied.
12. An armlet, Geneva cross, for each medical officer, and
for each nurse, and a field dressing for each officer, will be
issued free on mobilization.
Standards, Guidon, Colours, Drum-Major’s Staff
and Belt
13. On mobilization, the O.C. unit will arrange for the safe
custody of the standards, guidon or colours, and for the
despatch of the drum-major’s staff and belt to the depot.
Clothing Allowance
14. Clothing and kit allowances will be admissible under
the conditions of Chapter VII for all soldiers (except serving
T.A. personnel called up on embodiment, see para. 7 of this
appendix) up to the date of orders to proceed on active
service.
Kit allowance only will be admissible for serving T.A.
personnel called up on embodiment, during their first year of
embodied service, up to the date of orders to proceed on
active service ; this allowance will be issued under the con-
ditions laid down for recruits of the Regular Army, the date of
embodiment being regarded for this purpose as the date of
enlistment. In the case of personnel who have not been
ordered on active service during their first year’s embodied


service, a special allowance, which will be notified by Army
Order, will be admissible on completion of one year’s embodied
service, up to the date of orders to proceed on active service.
The issue of this allowance will be subject to the same regu-
lations as govern the issue of clothing allowance to the Regular
Army, but personal clothing, drawers and jerseys, pullover,
of such personnel will continue to be repaired or replaced free
when necessary through fair wear and tear.
No allowance in respect of clothing or kit will be issued to
any personnel for any day subsequent to the date of orders to
proceed on active service.
Clothing Accounts
15. Personal and public clothing will continue to be accounted
for in accordance with the instructions laid down in Appendix 2
up to the date of orders to proceed on active service.
16. In the case of reservists rejoining on mobilization, the
personal clothing and necessaries issued will be struck off
charge in bulk, supported by the A.F. G 1091 signed by each
man.
B.— Action to be taken on Receipt of Orders to
proceed on Active Service
(See also Mobilization Regulations)
17. On receipt of orders to proceed on active service,
kits of clothing and necessaries in possession of all soldiers
will be completed, where necessary, to the active service scale
laid down in para. 18 below. Articles included in this scale
which are within the peace scale referred to in paras. 1 and 4
of this appendix will be carefully inspected to ensure their
serviceability for three months’ wear under active service
conditions, and any replacements of unserviceable articles
will be charged to the soldiers’ accounts, except in the case of
personal clothing (including drawers and jersey, pullover) for
serving T.A. personnel called up on embodiment.
