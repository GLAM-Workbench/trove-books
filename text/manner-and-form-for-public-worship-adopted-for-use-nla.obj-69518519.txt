EXTRACTS
FROM THE
REGULATIONS OF THE ROYAL
AUSTRALIAN NAVY.
Divine Service is to be performed every Sunday
according to the manner and forms adopted for the
Royal Australian Navy ; if the duties of the Ship
and state of the weather do not absolutely prevent it,
a sermon is to be preached, unless otherwise directed
by the Senior Officer present. The Captain and all
Officers and Men not on duty are expected to attend
this service, unless permission to be absent has been
formally obtained on the ground of religious scruples.
On every week day after morning quarters or
divisions, short prayers from the same order of
service are to be read.
When no Chaplain is on board, the best arrange-
ments practicable are to be made to give effect to
these instructions as to Divine Service and Morning
Prayers.

ROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY.
ORDER OF MORNING SERVICE.
A Hymn may he sung, and one or more of the following passages
of Scripture shall he read :
HEAR, 0 Israel; the Lord our God is one Lord :
and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all
thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy
might. Deut. vi. 4.
To the Lord our God belong mercies and for-
givenesses, though we have rebelled against him :
neither have we obeyed the voice of the Lord our
God, to walk in his laws which he set before us,
Daniel ix. 9, 10.
I will arise, and go to my father, and will say
unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and
before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy
son. St. Imke xv. 18, 19.
Enter not into judgment with thy servant, 0 Lord ;
for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.
Psalm cxliii. 2.
God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must
worship in spirit and truth. St. John iv, 24.
If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves,
and the truth is not in us : but if we confess our sins,
he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to
cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 1 John i. 8, 9.


Then the Chaplain shall say —
mHE Scripture moveth us in sundry places to
JL acknowledge and confess our manifold sins and
wickedness, and that we should not dissemble nor
cloke them before the face of Almighty God our
heavenly Father ; but confess them with an humble,
lowly, penitent, and obedient heart, to the end that
we may obtain forgiveness of the same, by his infinite
goodness and mercy. And although we ought at all
times humbly to acknowledge our sins before God,
yet ought we most chiefly so to do, when we assemble
and meet together to render thanks for the great
benefits that we have received at his hands, to set
forth his most worthy praise, to hear his most holy
Word, and to ask those things which are requisite and
necessary as well for the body as the soul. Wherefore
I pray and beseech you to accompany me with a
pure heart and humble voice, unto the throne of the
heavenly grace, saying after me :
A general Confession to he said by all after the Chaplain, all
kneeling.
ALMIGHTY and most merciful Father ; We have
erred, and strayed from thy ways like lost sheep.
We have followed too much the devices and desires of
our own hearts. We have offended against thy holy


laws. We have left undone those things which we
ought to have done ; And we have done those things
which we ought not to have done ; And there is no
health in us. But thou, 0 Lord, have mercy upon
us, miserable offenders. Spare thou them, 0 God,
which confess their faults. Restore thou them that
are penitent ; According to thy promises declared
unto mankind in Christ Jesu our Lord. And grant,
0 most merciful Father, for his sake ; That we may
hereafter live a godly, righteous, and sober life, To
the glory of thy holy Name. Amen.
The Chaplain shall then stand and say, all still kneeling—
-OGOD, whose nature and property is ever to have
mercy and to forgive, receive our humble
petitions ; and though we be tied and bound with the
chain of our sins, yet let the pitifulness of thy great
mercy loose us; for the honour of Jesus Christ, our
Mediator and Advocate. Amen.
Then the Chaplain shall kneel, and say the Lord's Prayer, all
repeating it with him.
OUR Father, which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy
Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done
in earth, As it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily
bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive


them that trespass against us. And lead us not into
temptation ; But deliver us from evil: For thine is
the kingdom, The power, and the glory, For ever and
ever. Amen.
If Then likewise he shall say,
0 Lord, open thou our lips.
Answer. And our mouth shall shew forth thy
praise.
Chaplain. 0 God, make speed to save us.
Answer. 0 Lord, make haste to help us.
Here all standing up, the Chaplain shall say —
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son : and to the
Holy Ghost;
. . • “1
Ansiver. As it was in the beginning, is now, and
ever shall be : world without end. Amen.

that hath made us and not we ourselves * we

Then shall he sung or said the Creed following, all standing
as before .
I BELIEVE in one God the Father Almighty, Maker
of heaven and earth, And of all things visible and
invisible :
And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son
of God, Begotten of his Father before all worlds, God
of God, Light of Light, Very God of very God Be-
gotten, not made, Being of one substance with the
Father ; By whom all things were made, Who for us


men, and for our salvation came down from heaven,
And was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin
Mary, And was made man, And was crucified also for
us under Pontius Pilate. He suffered and was
buried, And the third day he rose again according to
the Scriptures, And ascended into heaven, And sitteth
on the right hand of the Father. And he shall come
again with glory to judge both the quick and the
dead : Whose kingdom shall have no end.
And I believe in the Holy Ghost, The Lord and
Giver of life, Who proceedeth from the Father and
the Son, Who with the Father and the Son together
is worshipped and glorified, Who spake by the
Prophets, And I believe one Catholick and Aposto-
lick Church. I acknowledge one Baptism for the
remission of sins. And I look for the Resurrection of
the dead, And the life of the world to come. Amen.
Then shall the following 'prayer he offered by the Chaplain :
ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, who art King of
Kings and Lord of Lords, the only Ruler of
Princes, we beseech thee of thy goodness to save and
protect our Sovereign Lord, King George, our gracious
Queen Mary, Alexandra the Queen Mother, Edward
Prince of Wales, and all the Royal Family, and to
establish the throne of our Empire in righteousness
and peace. We beseech thee to bless the Common-
wealth and People of Australia, the Governor-


General and the Governors of the States, the Houses
of Parliament, and all who hear public office in this
land, granting unto them heavenly wisdom for the
discharge of their duties, and for the maintenance of
thy true religion and virtue.
We beseech thee also to bless the Universal Church.
Replenish it with thy Holy Spirit. Unite it in love
of thy truth, in obedience to thy law, in care for the
poor, the sorrowful and the oppressed, and in the
evangelization of all nations.
May it please -thee to bless all who engage in the
defence of our Empire, our Navy, and our Army.
Grant them grace to serve with faithfulness and
cheerfulness, and protect them by thy mighty power.
These and all other mercies we humbly beg in the
name of Jesus Christ, our only Mediator and Ad-
vocate. Amen.
Then shall a Hymn or Anthem he sung .
The Chaplain shall then offer the following Prayers :—
OTHOU who rulest the waves of the sea, and hast
ordained it to be a highway for the nations,
Preserve in thy gracious keeping all those who journey
thereon.
Be mindful of us in toil or danger. Shield us in
peril; warn and defend us in moments of temptation ;
heal us in sickness ; and guard our lives from sin and


shame. Unto thy fatherly protection we commend
our dear ones at home ; unite us day by day in thy
Eternal Love ; so that at the last we may enter into
thine abiding peace and rest; through Jesus Christ
our Lord. Amen.
OGOD, the Creator and Preserver of all mankind,
we humbly beseech thee for all sorts and
conditions of men ; that thou wouldest be pleased to
make thy ways known unto them, thy saving health
unto all nations. We commend to thy fatherly
goodness all those who are any ways afflicted or
distressed in mind, body, or estate ; that it may
please thee to comfort and relieve them, according
to their several necessities, giving them patience
under their sufferings, and a happy issue out of all
their afflictions. And this we beg for Jesus Christ,
his sake. Amen.
ALMIGHTY God Who hast given us grace at this
time with one accord to make our common
supplications unto thee; and dost promise, that
when two or three are gathered together in thy Name
thou wilt grant their requests; Fulfil now, 0 Lord,
the desires and petitions of thy servants, as may be
most expedient for them ; granting us in this world
knowledge of thy truth, and in the world to come
life everlasting. Amen.

hast given us in our Saviour Jesus Christ, Amen.

THE PSALMS OF DAVID.
PSALM I. Beatus vir, qui non dbiit.
'• m/.T)LESSED is the man that hath not walked in the
X) counsel of the ungodly * nor stood in the | way
of | sinners : and hath not sat in the | seat | of
the I scornful.
F. 2 But his delight is in the law |of the | Lord : and
in his law will he exercise him- | -self | day and |
night.
3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the |
water | side : that will bring forth his | fruit in |
due I season.
4 His leaf also | shall not | wither : and look, what-
soever he | doeth | it shall | prosper.
5 As for the ungodly, it is not | so with | them : but
they are like the chaff * which the wind scattereth
away from the | face | of the | earth.
6 Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stand |
in the | judgment ; neither the sinners in the
congre- | -gation | of the | righteous.
2nd 7 But the Lord knoweth the way | of the | righteous :
part. and the way of the un- | -godly | shall | perish.
PSALM VIII. Domine Dominus nosier.
f /A LORD our Governour * how excellent is thy
U Name in | all the | world : thou that hast set
thy 1 glory . a- | -bove the | heavens.


2 Out of the mouth of very babes and sucklings hast
thou ordained strength * because |of thine |
enemies : that thou mightest still the | enemy |
and . the a- | -venger.
3 For I will consider thy heavens * even the works (
of thy ( fingers : the moon and the stars (
which thou | hast or- | -dained.
4 What is man, that thou art ( mindful . of | him :
and the son of man | that thou | visitest | him ?
5 Thou madest him lower | than the | angels : to
crown ( him with | glory . and | worship.
0 1 hou makest him to have dominion of the works I
of thy ( hands : and thou hast put all things in
sub- | -jection | under , his | feet;
7 All | sheep and | oxen : yea and the I beasts I of
the | field ;
8 The fowls of the air, and the fishes 1 of the I sea:
and whatsoever walketh through the | paths
of the | seas.
9 0 | Lord our | Governour ; how excellent is thy
Name in [ all the ( world !
PSALM XIX. Codi enarrant.
rPHE heavens declare the | glory . of | God : and
X the firmament | sheweth . his | handy- | -work.
2 One day | telleth . an- | -other : and one night |
certi- | -fieth . an- | -other.
3 There is neither ( speech nor | language : but
their J voices . are | heard a- ) -mong them.


4 Their sound is gone out into 1 all ] lands ; and their
words into the I ends I of the | world.
5 In them hath he set a tabernacle | for the | sun :
which cometh forth as a bridegroom out of his
chamber * and rejoiceth as a | giant . to | run
his I course.
6 It goeth forth from the uttermost part of the
heaven * and runneth about unto the end of |
it | a- | -gain : and there is nothing hid | from
the I heat there- I -of.
7 The law of the Lord is an undefiled law, con- ]
-verting . the | soul : the testimony of the Lord
is sure * and giveth ) wisdom | unto . the |
simple.
8 The statutes of the Lord are right and re- | -joice
the | heart : the commandment of the Lord is
pure * and giveth | light | unto . the | eyes.
2nd 9 The fear of the Lord is clean and en- | -dureth .
fart. f or | ever . judgments of the Lord are true,
and | righteous | alto- [ -gether.
10 More to be desired are they than gold * yea
than | much fine | gold : sweeter also than |
honey | and the | honeycomb.
11 Moreover, by them is thy | servant | taught : and
in keeping of them | there is [ great re- | -ward.
mp 12 Who can tell how | oft . he of- | -fendeth : 0
cleanse thou me ( from my ) secret j faults.


13 Keep tliy servant also from presumptuous sins *
lest they get the dominion | over | me : so shall
I be undefiled, and innocent | from the | great
of- I -fence.
14 Let the words of my mouth * and the meditation |
of my | heart : be alway ac- | -ceptable | in
thy | sight,
15 0| | Lord : my ( strength and ]my re- |
-deemer.
PSALM XX. Exaudiat te Dominus.
m f mHE Lord hear thee in the ] day of | trouble : the
X Name of the ] God of | Jacob . de- | -fend thee ;
2 Send thee help | from the | sanctuary : and |
strengthen . thee | out of | Sion ;
3 Remember [ all thy | offerings : and ac- | -cept
thy | burnt | sacrifice ;
4 Grant thee thy | heart’s de- | -sire : and ful- [ -fil |
all thy | mind.
5 We will rejoice in thy salvation * and triumph in
the Name of the I Lord our I God : the Lord
per- | -form all | thy pe- | -titions.
6 Now know I that the Lord helpeth his Anointed *
and will hear him from his | holy | heaven :
even with the wholesome | strength of | his
right | hand.
7 Some put their trust in chariots and [ some in |
horses : but we will remember the Name | of
the I Lord our I God.


8 They are brought j down and \ fallen : but we are
risen . and | stand ] upright.
9 Save, Lord, and hear us 0 | King of 1 heaven
when we | call up- | -on | thee.
PSALM XXIII. Dominus regit me.
rnp mHE Lord 1 is my j Shepherd : therefore | can I |
X lack j nothing.
2 He shall feed me in a \ green \ pasture : and lead
me forth be- | -side the [ waters . of | comfort.
3*He shall con- | -vert my | soul : and bring me
forth in the paths of righteousness \ for his [
Name’s | sake.
4 Yea though I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death * I will \ fear no | evil : for
thou art with me * thy rod and thy | staff |
comfort 1 me.
5 Thou shalt prepare a table before me * against
them that | trouble | me : thou hast anointed
my head with oil, and my | cup | shall be | full.
6 But thy loving-kindness and mercy* shall follow
me all the days [ of my | life : and I will dwell
in the house I of the | Lord for | ever.
PSALM XXIV. Domini est terra.
f mHE earth is the Lord’s * and all that | therein |
is; the compass of the world, and | they that |
dwell there- | -in.


2 For he hath founded it up- | -on the J seas ;
and prepared ( it up- | -on the | floods.
3 Who shall ascend into the hill I of the I Lord :
or who shall rise up | in his | holy | place ?
4 Even he that hath clean hands and a | pure (
heart : and that hath not lift up his mind unto
vanity * nor sworn |to de- | -ceive his I
neighbour.
5 He shall receive the blessing | from the | Lord
and righteousness from the ( God of | his sal-
tation.
6 This is the generation of | them that | seek him :
even of them that ( seek thy | face 0 | Jacob.
7 Lift up your heads 0 ye gates * and be ye lift up
ye ever- | -lasting | doors ; and the King of j
glory | shall come | in.
8 Who is the | King of | glory : it is the Lord strong
and mighty * even the | Lord | mighty .in |

PSALM XXV. Ad te, Domine, levavi.
UNTO thee 0 Lord will I lift up my soul *my
God I have put my ( trust in | thee : 0 let me


not be confounded * neither let mine enemies
triumph | over | me.
2 For all they that hope in thee shall | not . he a- |
shamed : but such as transgress without a
cause | shall be | put . to con- | -fusion.
3 Shew me thy | ways 0 | Lord : and | teach | me

5 Call to remembrance, 0 Lord thy | tender I
mercies : and thy loving-kindnesses * which j
have been I ever . of I old.
6 0 remember not the sins and offences | of my |
youth ; but according to thy mercy think thou
upon me 0 | Lord | for thy | goodness,
7 Gracious and righteous | is the | Lord : therefore
will he teach | sinners ] in the | way.
8 Them that are meek shall he | guide in | judg-
ment : and such as are gentle | them . shall he |
learn his | way.
9 All the paths of the Lord are | mercy . and |
truth : unto such as keep his | covenant | and

10 For thy Name’s ( sake 0 | Lord : be merciful unto

20 Let perfectness and righteous dealing | wait up- |
-on me : for my | hope hath ] been in | thee.
21 Deliver Israel | 0 God: out of | all | his | troubles.
PSALM XXVII. Dominus illuminate.
THE Lord is my light and my salvation * whom
then | shall I | fear : the Lord is the strength of
my life * of whom then | shall I | be a- | -fraid ?
2 When the wicked * even my enemies and my
foes * came upon me to eat | up my | flesh ;
they 1 stumbled | and [ fell.


3 Though, an host of men were laid against me * yet
shall not my heart | be a- | -fraid : and though
there rose up war against me * yet will I | put
my | trust in | him.
4 One thing have I desired of the Lord which I ) will
re- 1 -quire : even that I may dwell in the house
of the Lord all the days of my life * to behold
the fair beauty of the Lord ) and to | visit .
his | temple.
5 For in the time of trouble, he shall hide me in bis |
taber- ) -nacle : yea in the secret place of his
dwelling shall he hide me * and set me up up- |
-on a | rock of | stone.
6 And now shall he lift | up mine | head : above
mine ) enemies | round a- ] -bout me.
7 Therefore will I offer in his dwelling, an oblation
with 1 great ] gladness : I will sing and speak |
praises ( unto . the | Lord.
8 Hearken unto my voice 0 Lord * when I cry )
unto I thee : have mercy up- 1 -on me | and j
hear me.
9 My heart hath talked of thee * Seek [ ye my |
face : Thy | face Lord [ will I | seek.
10 0 hide not thou thy | face | from me : nor cast thy
servant a- | -way | in dis- | -pleasure.
11 Thou hast [ been my | succour : leave me not,
neither forsake me 0 j God of | my sal- 1 -vation,
12 When my father and my | mother . for- ] -sake
me : the Lord j taketh | me | up.


13 Teach me thy | way 0 ( Lord : and lead me in the
right way be- | -cause of [ mine | enemies.
14: Deliver me not over into the will | of mine [
adversaries : for there are false witnesses risen
up against me, and | such as | speak | wrong.

PSALM XXIX. Afferte Domino.
BRING unto the Lord 0 ye mighty * bring young
rams | unto . the | Lord : ascribe unto the
Lord | worship | and | strength.
2 Give the Lord the honour due I unto . his I
Name : worship the ) Lord with | holy

3 It is the Lord that com- | mandeth . the |
waters : it is the glorious | God that | maketh .
the I thunder.
4 It is the Lord that ruleth the sea * the voice of the
Lord is mighty in ] oper- | -ation : the voice of
the Lord | is a | glorious | voice.
5 The voice of the Lord | breaketh . the | cedar-
trees : yea the Lord | breaketh . the | cedars .
of I Libanus.


6 He maketh them also to skip | like a | calf
Libanus also and Sirion, | like a | young
unicorn.
7 The voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire *
the voice of the Lord | shaketh . the [ wilder-
ness : yea, the Lord shaketh the | wilder- | -ness
of I Cades,
8 The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to bring
forth young * and discovereth the | thick |
bushes : in his temple doth every man | speak J
of his I honour.
9 The Lord sitteth a- | -bove the | water-fiood : and
the Lord re- | -maineth . a ( King for | ever.
10 The Lord shall give strength | unto . his | people :
the Lord shall give his | people . the | blessing .

PSALM XXX. Exaltaho te , Domine.
F.mf T WILL magnify thee 0 Lord * for thou hast ( set
X me lup : and not made my foes to I triumph I
me j up : and not made my foes to | triumph
over I me.
F. 2 0 Lord my God, I cried | unto ( thee : and | thou
hast | healed | me.
3 Thou, Lord, hast brought my soul | out of | hell:
thou hast kept my life from them that go |
down ( to the | pit.
4 Sing praises unto the Lord 0 ye | saints of | his :
and give thanks unto him * for a re- |
-raembrance I of his I holiness.


5 For his wrath endureth but the twinkling of an
eye * and in his | pleasure . is | life : heaviness
may endure for a night * but joy | cometh | in
the | morning.
6 And in my prosperity I said * I shall never | be
re- | moved: thou, Lord, of thy goodness hast j
made my | hill so | strong,
p 7 Thou didst turn thy | face | from me : and | I |
was | troubled.
8 Then cried I unto ] thee 0 | Lord : and gat me
to my j Lord right | humbly.
9 What profit is there | in my | blood ; when I go
down | to the | pit ?
10 Shall the dust give thanks | unto | thee ; or shall
it de- | -dare thy | truth ?
11 Hear, 0 Lord and have | mercy . up- | -on me
Lord be ( thou | my | helper.
mf 12 Thou hast turned my heaviness | into | joy :
thou has put off my sackcloth and ] girded |
me with | gladness.

thanks | unto ( thee for | ever.
PSALM XXXII. Beati, quorum.
F. mpT)LESSED is he whose unrighteousness j is for-
X) -given : and whose | sin |is | covered.


2 Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord im- (
-puteth .no | sin : and in whose | spirit .
there | is no j guile,
3 For while I | held my | tongue : my bones
consumed away | through my | daily . com- |
-plaining.
4 For thy hand is heavy upon me | day and |
night : and my moisture is | like the [ drought
in | summer.
5 I will acknowledge my sin [ unto | thee : and mine
unrighteousness ( have I | not | hid.
6 I said, I will confess my sins | unto . the | Lord :
and so thou forgavest the I wickedness lof
my | sin.
7 For this shall every one that is godly make his
prayer unto thee *in a time when thou |
mayest . be | found : but in the great water-
floods | they shall | not come | nigh him.
8 Thou art a place to hide me in * thou shalt
preserve |me from | trouble : thou shalt
compass me about with | songs |of de-
liverance.
9 I will inform thee, and teach thee in the way
wherein _ thou shalt | go : and I will | guide
thee | with mine | eye,
10 Be ye not like to horse and mule * which have
no | under- | -standing : whose mouths must
be held with bit and bridle | lest they | fall
up- | -on thee.


11 Great plagues remain 1 for . the un- | -godly :
but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord *
mercy embraceth | him on \ every j side.
12 Be glad 0 ye righteous * and rejoice \ in the |
Lord : and be joyful all ye ] that are \ true of j
heart.
PSALM XXXIII. Exultate, justi.
"O EJOICE in the Lord | 0 ye | righteous ; for it
JAj becometh well the | just |tobe | thankful.
2 Praise the | Lord with | harp : sing praises unto
him with the lute * and instru- | -ment of |
ten j strings.
3 Sing unto the Lord a | new | song : sing praises
lustily unto him | with a | good | courage.
4 For the word of the | Lord is | true : and | all
his I works are I faithful.
5 He loveth righteous- | -ness and ] judgment: the
earth is full of the ] goodness | of the | Lord.
6 By the word of the Lord were the | heavens |
made : and all the hosts of them by the )
breath I of his I mouth.
7 He gathereth the waters of the sea together * as
it were up- | -on an | heap : and layeth up the |
deep as | in a | treasure-house,
8 Let all the earth I fear the I Lord : stand in dwe
of him * all ye that | dwell | in the [ world.
9 For he spake, and | it was | done : he com-
manded, I and it 1 stood | fast.


10 The Lord bringeth the counsel of the | heathen .
to | nought : and maketh the devices of the
people to be of none effect * and casteth | out
the | counsels . of 1 princes.
11 The counsel of the Lord shall en- | -dure for |
ever : and the thoughts of his heart from
gener- | -ation . to | gener- | -ation.
12 Blessed are the people, whose God is the | Lord
Je- 1 -hovah : and blessed are the folk that he
hath chosen to him to | be j his in- | -heritance.
13 The Lord looked down from heaven * and beheld
all the children . of | men ; from the habitation
of his dwelling *he considereth all them
that I dwell I on the | earth.
14 He fashioneth all the | hearts of | them : and
under- I -standeth I all their | works.
15 There is no king that can be saved by the
multitude | of an ] host : neither is any mighty
man de- | -livered . by ( much | strength.
16 A horse is counted but a vain thing 1 to save a |
man : neither shall he deliver any man ] by his j
great | strength.
17 Behold the eye of the Lord is upon | them that |
fear him : and upon them that put their )
trust | in his | mercy.
18 To deliver their | soul from | death : and to feed
them I in the I time of I dearth.

21 Let thy merciful kindness 0 Lord | be up- | -on

PSALM XXXIV. Benedicam Domino.
mf T WILL alway give thanks | unto . the | Lord :
1 his praise shall I ever .be|in my | mouth.
2 My soul shall make her boast | in the | Lord : the
humble shall hear there- | -of | and be | glad.
3 0 praise the | Lord with | me : and let us
magni- ( -fy his | Name to- | -gether,
4 I sought the Lord [ and he ) heard me : yea, he
delivered me | out of | all my | fear,
5 They had an eye unto him | and were | lightened :
and their | faces . were ) not a- ( -shamed.
6 Lo the poor crieth, and the Lord | heareth [ him :
yea, and saveth him | out of | all his ( troubles.
7 The angel of the Lord tarrieth round about | them
that | fear him : and | —de- | -livereth J them.
8 0 taste and see how gracious the | Lord | is :
blessed is the | man that | trusteth . in | him.
9 0 fear the Lord, ye that ( are his | saints : for they
that | fear him | lack | nothing.
10 The lions do lack and | suffer | hunger : but they
who seek the Lord, shall want no manner of (
thing | that is | good.


11 Come, ye children, and hearken ( unto | me
I will teach you the | fear | of the | Lord.
12 What man is he that | lusteth . to | live : and
would 1 fain | see good | days ?
13 Keep thy | tongue from ( evil ; and thy lips |
that they | speak no j guile.
14 Eschew evil and | do | good : seek | peace | and
en- I -sue it.
15 The eyes of the Lord are | over . the ( righteous :
and his ears are | open | unto . their | prayers.
16 The countenance of the Lord is against them
that | do | evil: to root out the remembrance [
of them i from the I earth.
17 The righteous cry, and the Lord | heareth | them :
and delivereth them | out of | all their |
troubles.
18 The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a |
contrite | heart ; and will save such as | be . of
an | humble | spirit.
19 Great are the troubles | of the | righteous : but
the Lord de- I -livereth . him I out of I all.
20 He keepeth [ all his | bones : so that not | one of
them is I broken.
21 But misfortune shall slay ( the un- | -godly : and
they that hate the | righteous | shall be |
desolate.
22 The Lord delivereth the souls | of his | servants :
and all they that put their trust in | him shall |
not be I destitute.


PSALM XXXIX. Dixi, custodiam.
I SAID, I will take heed | to my | ways : that I
of- | -fend not | in my | tongue.
2 I will keep my mouth as it were | with a | bridle :
while the un- | -godly . is | in my | sight.
3 I held my tongue and | spake | nothing : I kept
silence, yea, even from good words * but it was
pain and ] grief to | me.
4 My heart was hot within me * and while I was
thus musing the | fire [ kindled : and at the
last I | spake | with my | tongue ;
5 Lord, let me knoAV mine end * and the number |
of my 1 days : that I may be certified how j
long I j have to | live.
6 Behold, thou hast made my days as it were a |
span 1 long ; and mine age is even as nothing in
respect of thee * and verily, every man living
is | alto- | -gether | vanity.
7 For man walketh in a vain shadow * and dis-
quieteth him- | -self in [ vain ; he heapeth up
riches, and cannot tell | who shall [ gather |
them.
8 And now, Lord what | is my | hope : truly my |
hope is | even . in | thee.
9 Deliver me from all I mine of- | -fences : and
make me not a re- | -buke | unto . the | foolish.
10 I became dumb, and opened \ not |my | mouth
for | it was | thy ] doing.


Take thy plague a- | -way | from me : I am
even consumed by the means | of thy | heavy |
hand.
When thou with rebukes dost chasten man for
sin * thou makest his beauty to consume away *
like as it were a moth j fretting . a 1 gar-
ment ; every man | therefore ) is but j vanity.
Hear my prayer 0 Lord * and with thine ears
con- j -sider .my | calling : hold not thy |
peace | at my | tears.
For I am a | stranger . with ] thee : and a
sojourner, as | all my | fathers | were.
0 spare me a little * that I may re- | -cover .
my | strength : before I go hence, and |be
no more seen.
PSALM XL. Expectans expectavi .
m{ | WAITED patiently | for the | Lord : and he
1 inclined unto |me and | heard my | calling.
2 He brought me also out of the horrible pit * out
of the ( mire and | clay : and set my feet
upon the rock, and ) ordered [my ( goings.
3 And he hath put a new song | in my | mouth :
even a thanks- ( -giving | unto . our | God.
4 Many shall | see it . and j fear : and shall put
their I trust | in the | Lord.
5 Blessed is the man that hath set his hope | in
the | Lord : and turned not unto the proud *
and to such as | go a- | -bout with | lies.


6 0 Lord my God, great are the wondrous works
which thou hast done * like as be also thy
thoughts which | are to | us-ward : and yet
there is no man that ordereth | them | unto |
thee.
7 If I should declare them and | speak of | them :
they should be more than I am ] able |to
ex- | -press.
8 Sacrifice and meat-offering thou \ wouldest | not:
but mine | ears | hast thou | opened.
9 Burnt-offerings and sacrifice for sin * hast thou
not re- | -quired : then j said I | Lo I | come,
10 In the volume of the book it is written of me *
that I should fulfil thy will | 0 my | God :
I am content to do it * yea thy law \ is with- \
-in my | heart.
11 I have declared thy righteousness in the great |
congre- ) -gation : 10, I will not refrain my
lips 0 | Lord and | that thou j knowest.
12 I have not hid thy righteousness with- | -in my |
heart: my talk hath been of thy truth | and of [
thy sal- ( -vation.
2nd 13 J have not kept back thy loving | mercy . and |
part. truth : from the | great | congre- j -gation.
mp 14 Withdraw not thou thy mercy from | me 0 j
Lord : let thy loving-kindness and thy truth (
al- | -way pre- | -serve me.


15 For innumerable troubles are come about me *
my sins have taken suck hold upon me * that
I am not able to | look | up : yea they are more
in number than the hairs of my head * and
my | heart hath | failed | me.
16 0 Lord, let it be thy pleasure to de- | -liver | me :
make | haste 0 \ Lord to j help me.
17 Let them be ashamed and confounded together *
that seek after my soul ( to de- | -stroy it:
let them be driven backward * and put to re- |
-buke that I wish me I evil.
18 Let them be desolate, and re- ( -warded . with
shame ; that say unto me, Fie up- | -on thee
fie up- | -on thee.
19 Let all those that seek thee be joyful and | glad
in | thee ; and let such as love thy salvation
say alway The | Lord | be [ praised.
20 As for me I am | poor and 1 needy : but the j
Lord I careth I for me.
21 Thou art my helper \ and re- | -deemer : make
no long | tarrying | 0 my | God.
PSALM XLI. Beatus qui intelligit.
mpT)LESSED is he that considereth the | poor and j
Jj needy : the Lord shall deliver him )in the J
time of I trouble.


2 The Lord preserve him,, and keep him alive *
that he may be blessed up- | -on | earth:
and deliver not thou him unto the | will | of
his | enemies.
3 The Lord comfort him, when he lieth sick up —
-on his | bed : make thou all his | bed | in his |
sickness.
4 I said, Lord, be merciful | unto | me : heal my
soul, for I have | sinned . a- | -gainst thee.
5 Mine enemies speak | evil | of me : When shall
he die j and his | name | perish ?
6 And if he come to see me he | speaketh | vanity :
and his heart conceiveth falsehood within
himself * and when he cometh | forth he [
telleth | it.
7 All mine enemies whisper to- | -gether .a- (
gainst me : even against me do | they im- j
-agine . this | evil.
8 Let the sentence of guiltiness pro- ( -ceed a- |
-gainst him : and now that he lieth | let him .
rise | up no | more.
o Yea, even mine own familiar friend | whom I j
trusted : who did also eat of my bread, hath |
laid great [ wait for | me.
10 But be thou merciful unto | me 0 | Lord : raise
thou me up again | and I | shall re- | -ward
them.


11 By this I know thou | favourest |me : that
mine enemy | doth not | triumph . a | -gainst
me.
12 And when I am in my health * thou up- | -boldest
me : and shalt set me be- | -fore th} 7 ( face
for I ever.

without end. I A- I -men.
PSALM XLII. Quemadmodum.
mf T IKE as the hart de- ( -sireth . the ( waterbrooks :
1 1 so longeth my soul | after | thee 0 | God.
2 My soul is athirst for God * yea, even for the
living | God ; when shall I come to appear
be- | -fore the | presence . of | God ?
3 My tears have been my meat | day and ) night:
while they daily say unto me | Where is |
now thy | God ?
4 Now when I think thereupon * I pour out my
heart |by my- | -self: for I went with the
multitude * and brought them forth ( into ,
the | house of | God;
2nd 5J n the voice of praise and | thanks- | -giving:
part among ( such as | keep | holyday.
6 Why art thou so full of heaviness | 0 my ( soul;
and why art thou so dis- | -quiet- | -ed with- (
in me ?
7 Put thy | trust in | God : for I will yet give him
thanks for the | help ( of his | countenance.


8 My God, my soul is ( vexed . with- | -in me :
therefore will I remember thee concerning the
land of Jordan * and the | little ( hill of |
Hermon.
9 One deep calleth another * because of the noise |
of the | water-pipes : all thy waves and storms
are | gone over | me.
10 The Lord hath granted his loving-kindness | in
the | daytime : and in the night-season did
I sing of him * and made my prayer unto the |
God | of my | life.
11 I will say unto the God of my strength *Why
hast thou for- | -gotton | me : why go I thus
heavily * while the ( ene- . -my op- ( -presseth |
me ?
12 Mv bones are smitten asunder I as . with a

cast me I in the | teeth ;

Where | —is | now thy | God ?
14 Why art thou so vexed |omy | soul: and why
art thou so dis- ( -quiet- | -ed with- | -in me ?

4 The rivers of the flood thereof, shall make glad

5 God is in the midst of her * therefore shall she
not | be re- | -moved : God shall | help her .

9 He maketh wars to cease in I all the I world :

3 For 10, the kings ( of the | earth ; are gathered

4 They marvelled to | see such | things : they were

5 Fear came there upon ( them and | sorrow ; as

6 Thou shalt break the ships | of the | sea : through

XT goodness : according to the multitude of thy

3 For I ac- | -knowledge . my | faults ; and my !
sin is I ever . be- I -fore me.
4 Against thee only have I sinned * and done this
evil |in thy | sight: that thou mightest be
justified in thy saying and | clear when | thou
art | judged.
5 Behold I was ( shapen . in | wickedness : and in
sin hath my ( mother . con- | -ceived I me.
6 But 10, thou requirest truth in the | inward | parts:
and shalt make me to under- | -stand | wisdom
secretly.
7 Thou shalt purge me with hyssop * and I ( shall
be ( clean : thou shalt wash me * and I j shall
be I whiter , than 1 snow.


8 Thou shalt make me hear of | joy and | gladness :
that the bones which thou hast | broken | may

14 Deliver me from blood-guiltiness 0 God * thou
that art the God | of my | health ; and my

give it | thee : but thou delightest not in j
burnt- | -offerings.
17 The sacrifice of God is a | troubled | spirit: a

not de- j -spise.
18 0 be favourable and gracious | unto | Sion :

4 For thy loving-kindness is better than the | life

7 Have I not remembered thee | in my | bed : and

court * and shall he satisfied with the pleasure
of thy house * even | of thy | holy | temple.
5 Thou shalt shew us wonderful things in thy

thou that art the hope of all the ends of the

broad I sea.
6 Who in his strength setteth | fast the | mountains:
and is | girded . a- ( -bout with | power.

people.


8 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts of the
earth * shall be afraid ( at thy | tokens : thou
that makest the outgoings of the morning and |
evening . to ( praise | thee.
9 Thou visitest the earth and ( blessest | it: thou (
makest • it | very | plenteous.
10 The river of God is | full of | water : thou pre-
parest their corn * for so thou pro- | -videst (
for the ( earth.
11 Thou waterest her furrows * thou sendest rain
into the little ( valleys . there- | -of ; thou
makest it soft with the drops of rain and |
blessest . the I increase I of it.
12 Thou crownest the year ( with thy | goodness
and thy | clouds | drop | fatness.
13 They shall drop upon the dwellings | of the |
wilderness : and the little hills shall re- | -joice
on | every | side.
14 The folds shall be | full of | sheep : the valleys
also shall stand so thick with corn that | they
shall | laugh and ( sing.

PSALM LXX. Deus in adjutorium.
p TT ASTE thee 0 God to de- | -liver | me : make
XT haste to j help |me 0 | Lord.
2 Let them be ashamed and confounded, that seek |
after . my [ soul: let them be turned backward *
and put to con- | -fusion . that | wish me | evil.
3 Let them for their reward be soon | brought to |
shame : that cry | over . me | There | there.
4 But let all those that seek thee be joyful and |
glad in | thee : and let all such as delight in thy
salvation say alway, The | Lord | be | praised.
5 As for me, lam poor | and in | misery: haste thee |

PSALM LXXIII. Quam bonus Israel!
mprnRULY God is loving | unto j Israel : even unto
1 such as ( are .of a | clean ( heart.
2 Nevertheless, my feet were | almost ( gone : my (
treadings . had | well-nigh | slipt.
3 And why *1 was grieved [ at the | wicked : I do
also see the un- | -godly .in | such pros- |
perity.
4 For they are in no ( peril . of ( death : but are [
lusty | and | strong.
5 They come in no misfortune like | other ( folk:
neither are they | plagued . like ( other | men.
6 And this is the cause that they are so ( holden .
with | pride : and | over- ( -whelmed . with |
cruelty.
7 Their eyes | swell with | fatness : and they do f
even ( what they | lust.
8 They corrupt other * and speak of ( wicked |
blasphemy ; their talking is a- | -gainst the f
most | High.
9 For they stretch forth their mouth | unto , the |
heaven ; and their tongue I goeth I through
the I world.
10 Therefore fall the people ( unto | them : and
thereout suck | they no | small ad- | -vantage.
11 Tush, say they * how should ( God per- | -ceive
it : is there knowledge | in the ( most | High ?


Lo, these are the ungodly, these prosper in the
world * and these have riches | in pos- |
session : and I said, Then have I cleansed my
heart in vain, and ) washed . mine ] hands in |
innocency.
All the day long have | I been ) punished : and |
chastened \ every | morning.
Yea, and I had almost said | even . as | they :
but 10, then I should have condemned the
gener- [ -ation | of thy | children.
Then thought I to under- | -stand 1 this : but it |
was too | hard for | me,
Until I went into the sanctu- | -ary .of
God : then understood I the ) end of ] these |
men I
Namely, how thou dost set them in 1 slippery |
places : and castest them down | and de- |
strovest | them. .
Oh, how suddenly do 1 they con- 1 -sume : perish
and 1 come . to a j fearful j end.
Yea, even like as a dream [ when_ one a-
-waketh : so shalt thou make their image to )
vanish j out . of the [ city. .
Thus my | heart was ] grieved : and it went |
even | through my | reins.
So foolish was j I and 1 ignorant : even as it ]
were a | beast be- | -fore thee.
Nevertheless lam j alway . by | thee : for thou
hast holden me | by my | right | hand.


23 Thou shall guide me | with thy | counsel : and
after that | re- | -ceive | me with | glory.
24 Whom have I in | heaven . but | thee : and there
is none upon earth that I desire in com- |
pari- | -son of | thee.
25 My flesh and my | heart | faileth : hut God is the
strength of my heart | and my ( portion . for |
ever.
26 For 10, they that forsake | thee shall | perish
thou hast destroyed all them that commit
fomi- | -cation . a- ( -gainst thee.
27 But it is good for me to hold me fast by God * to
put my trust in the | Lord | God : and to speak
of all thy works in the gates |of the |
daughter . of | Sion.
PSALM LXXXV, Benedixisti, Domine.
mp T ORD, thou art become gracious | unto . thy
J J land : thou hast turned away the cap- | -tivi-
ty of | Jacob.
2 Thou hast forgiven the offence | of thy | people :
and I covered I all their I sins.
3 Thou hast taken away all | thy dis- | -pleasure :
and turned thyself from thy | wrathful (
indig- | -nation.
4 Turn us then 0 | God our | Saviour : and let
thine ( anger | cease J from us.


5 Wilt thou be displeased at | us for | ever . and
wilt thou stretch out thy wrath from on
sener- 1 -ation | to an- j -other ?
6 Wilt thou not turn again, and 1 quicken | us : that
thy people | may re- 1 -joice m | thee .
7 Shew us thy ) mercy .0 1 Lord : and 1 gran i |
* thv sal- 1 -vation. ,
8 I will hearken what the Lord God will say con-
cerning I me : for he shall speak peace unto his
people and to his saints * that they | turn 1
9 Fo^ 0 his salvation is nigh | them that [ fear him :
that glory may 1 dwell ) in our | land.
10 Mercy and truth are 1 met to- | -gether: righteous-

1] Truth shall flourish ] out . of the 1 earth . an

12 Lord shall shew J loving- 1 -kindness
and our j land shall | give her j increase.
13 Righteousness shall 1 go be- | - ore him : and he
shall direct his | going 1 m the 1 way.
PSALM LXXXVI. Indina, Domine.
BOW down thine ear 0 1 Lord and 1 hear me . for
I am 1 poor I and in j misery.
2 Preserve thou my soul, for 1 I am | ho y :
God, save thy servant that j putteth . his j
trust in ) thee.


3 Be merciful unto (me 0 | Lord : for 1 will |
call | daily up- ( -on thee.
4 Comfort the soul j of thy ( servant: for unto thee
0 Lord do 1 | lift | up my | soul.
5 For thou, Lord art | good and | gracious ; and of
great mercy unto all | them that | call up- | -on
thee.
6 Give ear, Lord ( unto . my | prayer : and ponder
the voice | of my | humble . de- | -sires.
7 In the time of my trouble I will | call up- . -on |
thee : for | thou | hearest | me.
8 Among the gods there is none like unto ( thee 0 (
Lord : there is not one that can (do as |
thou | doest.
9 All nations whom thou hast made * shall come
and worship | thee 0 ( Lord : and shall |
glori- | -fy thy ( Name.
10 For thou art great, and doest ( wondrous |
things : thou | —art ( God a- | -lone.
11 Teach me thy way 0 Lord * and I will walk | in
thy | truth : 0 knit my heart unto thee, that |
I may | fear thy -( Name.
12 I will thank thee 0 Lord my God with ( all my |
heart ; and will praise thy ( Name for | ever- (
more.
13 For great is thy | mercy ( toward me : and thou
hast delivered my soul ( from the | nether-
most | hell.


14 0 God, the proud are | risen . a- j -gainst me :
and the congregations of naughty men have
sought after my soul * and have not set | thee
be- | -fore their | eyes.
15 But thou 0 Lord, art full of com- 1 -passion .
and | mercy ; long-suffering | plenteous . m )
goodness . and | truth.
16 0 turn thee then unto me, and have | mercy .
up- j -on me : give thy strength unto thy
servant * and help the | son |of thine |
handmaid.
17 Shew some token upon me for good * that they
who hate me may see it and 1 be a- ] -shamed :
because thou Lord hast holpen | me and |
comforted | me.
PSALM XC. Domine, refugium.
I' ORD thou hast | been our | refuge : from one
Ji gener- | -ation |to an- | -other.
2 Before the mountains were brought forth * or
ever the earth and the | world were | made .
thou art God from everlasting and | world
■ with- j -out | end.
3 Thou turnest man | to de- | -struction : again
thou sayest, Come a- | -gain ye | children . of \
men. .
4 For a thousand years in thy sight | are but . as
yesterday i seeing that is past as a | watch |
in the | night.


5 As soon as thou scatterest them * they are even |
as a | sleep : and fade away | suddenly | like
the | grass.
6 In the morning it is green and | groweth | up ;
but in the evening it is cut down | dried | up
and I withered.
7 For we consume away in | thy dis- | -pleasure :
and are afraid at thy | wrathful [ indig- | nation.
8 Thou hast set our mis- | -deeds be- | -fore thee :
and our secret sins in the | light | of thy |
countenance.
• 9 For when thou art angry, all our | days are |
gone : we bring our years to an end * as it
were a I tale I that is I told.
10 The days of our age are three-score years and
ten * and though men be so strong that they
come to | four-score | years: yet is their strength
then but labour and sorrow * so soon passeth
it a- | -way and | we are | gone.
11 But who regarde th the power ( of thy ( wrath
for even thereafter as a man feareth | so is
thy dis- | -pleasure.
12 So teach us to ( number . our | days : that we
may apply our | hearts | unto | wisdom.
15 Turn thee again, 0 Lord | at the | last : and be (
gracious | unto . thy | servants.


14 0 satisfy us with thy mercy and 1 that j soon ;
so shall we rejoice and be glad all the | days |
of our | life. .
15 Comfort us again * now after the time that thou
hast | plagued j us : and for the years wherein 1
we have | suffered . ad- | -versity.
16 Shew thy \ servants . thy j work : and their (
children | thy | glory.
17 And the glorious Majesty of the Lord our God |
be up- j -on us : prosper thou the work of our

work.
PSALM XCI. Qui habitat.
WHOSO dwelleth under the defence of the | most j

the Al- | -mighty.
2 I will say unto the Lord * Thou are my hope J

3 For he shall deliver thee from the snare 1 of the |

4 He shall defend thee under his wings * and thou
shalt be safe | under . his [ feathers : his faith-

5 Thou shalt not be afraid for any | terror . by j

6 lor the pestilence that ( walketh . in ( darkness ;
nor for the sickness that de- | -stroyeth |in

7 A thousand shall fail beside thee * and ten

not come ( nigh ( thee.
8 Yea, Avith thine eyes shalt ( thou be- ( -hold : and

9 For thou Lord | art my | hope : thou hast set

10 There shall no evil happen | unto | thee : neither

11 For he shall give his angels charge | over | thee : to

12 They shall bear thee | in their I hands : that thou
hurt not thy ( foot a- | -gainst a | stone.
13 Thou shalt go upon the | lion and | adder ; the
young lion and the dragon shalt thou j tread |

14 Because he hath set his love upon me * therefore
will I de- | -liver ( him : I will set him up *
because | he hath | known my ( Name.

for me : I cannot at- I -tain I unto I it.

7 If I climb up into heaven | thou art | there : if I
go down to hell —thou art | there | also.
8 If I take the wings | of the | morning : and remain

PSALM 23.
rpHE Lord’s my shepherd, I’ll not want,
1 He makes me down to lie
In pastures green : He leadeth me
The quiet waters by.
My soul He doth restore again ;
And me to walk doth make
Within the paths of righteousness,
Ev’n for His own Name’s sake.
Yea, though I walk in death’s dark vale,
Yet will I fear none ill:
For Thou art with me ; and Thy rod
And staff me comfort still.
My table thou hast furnished
In presence of my foes ;
My head Thou dost with oil anoint,
And my cup overflows.
Goodness and mercy all my life
Shall surely follow me :
And in God’s house for evermore
My dwelling-place shall be.


PSALM 61 1-4.8.
OGOD, give ear unto my cry ;
Unto my pray’r attend
From th’ utmost corner of the land
My cry to Thee I’ll send.
What time my heart is overwhelm’d
And in perplexity,
Do Thou me lead unto the Rock
That higher is than I.
For Thou hast for my refuge been
A shelter by Thy pow’r;
And for defence against my foes
Thou hast been a strong tow’r.
Within Thy tabernacle I
For ever will abide ;
And under covert of Thy wings
With confidence me hide.
And so will I perpetually
Sing praise unto Thy Name ;
That having made my vows, I may
Each day perform the same.
PSALM 103 8-13.
THE Lord our God is merciful,
And He is gracious,
Long-suffering, and slow to wrath,
In mercy plenteous.


He will not chide continually,
Nor keep His anger still.
With us He dealt not as we sinn’d,
Nor did requite our ill.
For as the heaven in its height
The earth surmounteth far ;
So great to those that do Him fear
His tender mercies are :
As far as east is distant from
The west, so far hath He
From us removed, in his love,
All our iniquity.
Such pity as a father hath
Unto his children dear ;
Like pity shews the Lord to such
As worship Him in fear.
PSALM 121.
I TO the hills will lift mine eyes,
From whence doth come mine aid.
My safety cometh from the Lord
Who heav’n and earth hath made.
Thy foot He’ll not let slide, nor will
He slumber that thee keeps.
Behold, He that keeps Israel,
He slumbers not, nor sleeps.


The Lord thee keeps, the Lord thy shade
On thy right hand doth stay ;
The moon by night thee shall not smite :
Nor yet the sun by day.
The Lord shall keep thy soul; He shall
Preserve thee from all ill,
Henceforth thy going out and in
God keep for ever will.


HYMNS.

AWAKE, my soul, and with, the sun
Thy daily stage of duty run ;
Shake off dull sloth, and joyful rise
To pay thy morning sacrifice.
Thy precious time mis-spent, redeem ;
Each present day thy last esteem ;
Improve thy talent with due care ;
For the great day thyself prepare.
In conversation be sincere ;
Keep conscience as the noon-tide clear
Think how all-seeing God thy ways
And all thy secret thoughts surveys.
By influence of the light divine,
Let thy own light to others shine ;
Reflect all heaven’s propitious rays,
In ardent love and cheerful praise.
Wake, and lift up thyself, my heart
And with the Angels bear thy part,
Who all night long unwearied sing
High praise to the eternal King. Amen.


CHRIST, Whose glory fills the skies,
Christ, the true, the only Light,
Sun of Righteousness, arise,
Triumph o’er the shades of night;
Day-spring from on high, be near ;
Day-star, in my heart appear.
Dark and cheerless is the morn
Unaccompanied by Thee ;
Joyless is the day’s return
Till Thy mercy’s beams I see :
Till they inward light impart,
Glad my eyes and warm my heart.
Visit, then, this soul of mine,
Pierce the gloom of sin and grief;
Fill me, Radiancy Divine,
Scatter all my unbelief ;
More and more Thyself display,
Shining to the perfect day. Amen.

IVTEW every morning is the love
_IM Our wakening and uprising prove ;
Through sleep and darkness safely brought,
Restored to life, and power, and thought.


2 New mercies, each returning day,
Hover around us while we pray;
New perils past, new sins forgiven,
New thoughts of God, new hopes of heaven
3 If on our daily course our mind
Be set to hallow all we find,
New treasures still, of countless price,
God will provide for sacrifice.
4 Old friends, old scenes, will lovelier be,
As more of heaven in each we see ;
Some softening gleam of love and prayer
Shall dawn on every cross and care.
5 The trivial round, the common task,
Will furnish all we ought to ask,
Room to deny ourselves, a road
To bring us daily nearer God.
6 Only, 0 Lord, in Thy dear love,
Fit us for perfect rest above
And help us, this and every day,
To live more nearly as we pray. Amen.

ODAY of rest and gladness
0 day of joy and light,
0 balm of care and sadness,
Most beautiful, most bright


On thee the high and lowly,
Through ages joined in tune,

2 On thee, at the Creation,
The light first had its birth ;
On thee, for our salvation,
Christ rose from depths of earth
On thee, our Lord victorious
The Spirit sent from heaven ;
And thus on thee most glorious
A triple light was given,
3 To-day on weary nations
The heavenly Manna falls ;
To holy convocations
The silver trumpet calls ;
Where Gospel-light is glowing
With pure and radiant beams ;
And living water flowing
With soul-refreshing streams.
4 New graces ever gaining
From this our day of rest,
We reach the Rest remaining
To spirits of the Blest.
To Holy Ghost be praises,
To Father and to Son ;
The Church her voice upraises
To Thee, blest Three in One, Amen


[L.M.]
OLord, how joyful ’tis to see
The brethren join in love to Thee !
On Thee alone their heart relies,
Their only strength Thy grace supplies.
2 Now sweet within Thy holy place
With one accord to sing Thy grace,
Besieging Thine attentive ear
With all the force of fervent prayer.
3 0 may we love the House of God,
Of peace and joy the blest abode ;
0 may no angry strife destroy
That sacred peace, that holy-joy.
i The world without may rage, but we
Will only cling more close to Thee,
With hearts to Thee more wholly given,
More wean’d from earth, more fix’d on Heav’n.
5 Lord, shower upon us from above
The sacred gift of mutual love ;
Each other’s wants may we supply.
And reign together in the sky.
6 Praise God, from whom all blessings flow,
Praise Him, all creatures here below,
Praise Him above, Angelic host,
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen.

3 Teach me to live, that I may dread
The grave as little as my bed ;
Teach me to die, that so I may
Rise glorious at the awful day.
4 Oh may my soul on Thee repose ;
And may sweet sleep mine eyelids close, —
Sleep, that shall me more vigorous make
To serve my God when I awake.
5 When in the night I sleepless lie,
My soul with heavenly thoughts supply ;
Let no ill dreams disturb"my rest,
No powers of darkness me molest.
6 Praise God, from Whom all blessings flow ;
Praise Him, all creatures here below ;
Praise Him above, Angelic Host;
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, Amen,

ABIDE with me ; fast falls the eventide ;
The darkness deepens; Lord, with me
abide ;
When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, 0 abide with me.
2 Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day ;
Earth’s joys grow dim, its glories pass away
Change and decay in all around I see;
0 Thou, Who changest not, abide with me.
3 I need Thy presence every passing hour;
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter’s
power ?
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be ?
Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with
4. I fear no foe with Thee at hand to bless;
Ills have no weight and tears no bitterness ;
Where is death’s sting ? Where Grave thy
victory ?
I triumph still if Thou abide with me.
5 Hold Thou Thy Cross before my closing eyes ;
Shine through the gloom and point me to the
skies;
Heaven’s morning breaks, and earth’s vain
shadows flee ;
In life, in death, 0 Lord, abide with me. Amen.


[L.M.]
SUN of my soul, Thou Saviour dear,
It is not night if Thou be near :
0 may no earth-born cloud arise
To hide Thee from Thy servant’s eyes.
2 When the soft dews of kindly sleep
My wearied eyelids gently steep,
Be my last thought, how sweet to rest
For ever on my Saviour’s breast.
3 Abide with me from morn till eve,
For without Thee I cannot live ;
Abide with me when night is nigh
For without Thee I dare not die.
4 If some poor wand’ring child of Thine
Have spurn’d to-day the voice Divine,
Now, Lord, the gracious work begin ;
Let him no more lie down in sin.
5 Watch by the sick; enrich the poor
With blessings from Thy boundless store
Be every mourner’s sleep to-night
Like infant’s slumbers, pure and light.
6 Come near and bless us when we wake,
Ere through the world our way we take ;
Till in the ocean of Thy love
We lose ourselves in Heav’n above. Amen.


SWEET Saviour, bless us ere we go ;
Thy Word into our minds instil,
And make our lukewarm hearts to glow
With lowly love and fervent will.
Through life’s long day and death’s dark night,
0 gentle Jesus, be our light.
2 The day is done, its hours have run,
And Thou hast taken count of all,
The scanty triumphs grace hath won,
The broken vow, the frequent fall.
Through life’s long day and death’s dark night,
0 gentle Jesus, be our Light.
3 Grant us, dear Lord, from evil ways
True absolution and release ;
And bless us, more than in past days,
With purity and inward peace.
Through life’s long day and death’s dark night,
0 gentle Jesus, be our Light.
4 Do more than pardon ; give us joy.
Sweet fear, and sober liberty,
And simple hearts without alloy
That only long to be like Thee,
Through life’s long day and death’s dark night,
0 gentle Jesus, be our Light.


5 For all we love, the poor, the sad,
The sinful, unto Thee we call;
0 let Thy mercy make us glad :
Thou art our Jesus, and our All.
Through life’s long day and death’s dark night,
0 gentle Jesus, be out Light. Amen.
[6.6.6.6.8.5.
HUSH’D was the evening hymn,
The temple courts were dark
The lamp was burning dim
Before the sacred ark;
When suddenly a Voice Divine
Rang through the silence of the shrine.
The old man meek and mild,
The priest of Israel, slept
His watch the Temple child
The little Levite kept;
And what from Eli’s sense was sealed,
The Lord to Hannah’s son reveal’d.
Oh ! give me Samuel’s ear,
The open ear, 0 Lord,
Alive and quick to hear
Each whisper of Thy word ;
Like him to answer at Thy call,
And to obey Thee first of all.


4 Oh ! give me Samuel’s heart
A lowly heart, that waits
Where in Thy Thou art.
Or watches at Thy gates,
By day and night a heart that still
Moves at the breathing of Thy will.
*
5 Oh ! give me Samuel’s mind,
A sweet unmurmuring faith,
Obedient and resign’d
To Thee in life and death ;
That I may read with child-like eyes
Truths that are hidden from the wise. Amen.
[C.M.]
HARK, the glad sound ! the Saviour comes,
The Saviour promised long :
Let every heart prepare a throne,
And every voice a song.
2 He comes, the prisoners to release,
In Satan’s bondage held ;
The gates of brass before Him burst,
The iron fetters yield.
3 He comes, from thickest films of vice
To clear the mental ray,
And on the eyeballs of the blind
To pour celestial day.


4 He comes, the broken heart to bind,
The bleeding soul to cure ;
And with the treasures of His grace
To bless the humble poor.
5 Our glad hosannas, Prince of peace,
Thy welcome shall proclaim ;
And Heaven’s eternal arches ring
With Thy beloved Name. Amen.
[L.M.]
ON Jordan’s bank the Baptist’s cry
Announces that the Lord is nigh ;
Awake and hearken ; for he brings
Glad tidings of the King of kings.
2 Then cleansed be every breast from sin,
And furnished for so great a Guest;
Yea, let us each our heart prepare
For Christ to come and enter there.
3 For Thou art our Salvation, Lord,
Our Refuge and our great Reward ;
Without Thy grace our souls must fade,
And wither like a flower decayed.
4 Stretch forth Thine hand to heal our sore,
And make us rise to fall no more ;
Once more upon Thy people shine,
And fill the world with love divine. Amen.


[8.7.5.7.4.7.]
LO ! He com.es with clouds descending,
Once for favoured sinners slain ;
Thousand thousand Saints attending
Swell the triumph of His train :
Alleluia !
God appears on earth to reign.
2 Every eye shall now behold Him,
Robed in dreadful majesty ;
Those who set at nought and sold Him,
Pierced and nailed Him to the Tree, '
Deeply wailing
Shall the true Messiah see.
3 The dear tokens of His Passion
Still His dazzling Body bears ;
Cause of endless exultation
To his ransomed worshippers ;
With what rapture
Gaze we on those glorious scars.
4 Yea, Amen, let all adore Thee
High on Thine eternal throne ;
Saviour, take the power and glory,
Claim the kingdom for Thine own *
Alleluia !
Thou shalt reign and Thou alone. Amen.


[8.7.5.7.8.8.7.]
aREAT God, what do I see and hear ?
The end of things created ;
The Judge of mankind doth appear,
On clouds of glory seated;
The trumpet sounds, the graves restore
The dead which they contained before ;
Prepare, my soul, to meet Him.
2 The dead in Christ shall first arise
At the last trumpet’s sounding ;
Caught up to meet Him in the skies,
With joy their Lord surrounding.
No gloomy fears their souls dismay,
His Presence sheds eternal day
On those prepared to meet Him.
3 But sinners, filled with guilty fears,
Behold His wrath prevailing,
For they shall rise, and find their tears
And sighs are unavailing.
The day of grace is past and gone ;
Trembling they stand before the throne,
All unprepared to meet Him.
4 Great God, what do I see and hear ?
The end of things created ;
The Judge of mankind doth appear,
On clouds of glory seated :


Beneath His Cross I view the day
When heaven and earth shall pass away,
And thus prepare to meet Him. Amen.
[8.7.]
HARK, a thrilling voice is sounding :
“ Christ is nigh,” it seems to say ;
“ Cast away the dreams of darkness,
0 ye children of the day ! ”
Startled at the solemn warning,
Let the earth-bound soul arise :
Christ, her Sun, all sloth dispelling,
Shines upon the morning sides.
3 Lo ! the Lamb so long-expected
Comes with pardon down from heaven ;
Let us all, with tears of sorrow,
Pray that we may be forgiven;
4 So when next He comes with glory,
Wrapping all the earth in fear,
May He then as our Defender
On the clouds of heaven appear.
5 Honour, glory, virtue, merit,
To the Father and the Son,
With the Co-eternal Spirit,
While eternal ages run. Amen.


[C.M.J
WHILE shepherds watched their flocks by
night,
All seated on the ground,
The Angel of the Lord came down,
And glory shone around.
2 “ Fear not,” said he,—for mighty dread
Had seized their troubled mind, —
“ Glad tidings of great joy I bring
To you and all mankind.
3 “ To you, in David’s town this day,
Is born, of David’s line,
A Saviour, Who is Christ the Lord,
And this shall be the sign :
4 “ The heavenly Babe you there shall find
To human view displayed,
All meanly wrapt in swathing bands,
And in a manger laid.”
5 Thus spake the Seraph, and forthwith
Appeared a shining throng
Of Angels, praising God, and thus
Addressed their joyful song :
6 “ All glory be to God on high,
And to the earth be peace :
Good-will henceforth, from heaven to men,
Begin and neyer cease.” Amen.


[p. M.]
ONCE in royal David’s city
Stood a lowly cattle shed,
Where a Mother laid her Baby
In a manger for his bed ;
Mary was that Mother mild,
Jesus Christ her little Child.
2 He came down to earth from Heaven
’'Vho is God and Lord of all,
And His shelter was a stable,
And his cradle was a stall;
With the poor and mean and lowly,
Lived on earth our Saviour Holy.
3 And, through His wondrous Childhood,
He would honour and obey,
Love and watch the lowly Maiden,
In whose gentle arms he lay ;
Christian children all must be
Mild, obedient, good as He.
4 For He is our childhood’s pattern,
Day by day like us He grew,
He was little, weak, and helpless,
Tears and smiles like us He knew ;
And He feeleth for our sadness,
And He shareth in our gladness,


5, And our eyes at last shall see Him,
Through His own redeeming love,
For that child so dear and gentle
Is our Lord in Heav’n above ;
And He leads His children on
To the place where He is gone.
6 Not in that poor lowly stable,
With the oxen standing by,
We shall see Him ; but in Heaven,
Set at God’s right hand on high ;
When like stars his children crown’d
All in white shall wait around. Amen.
HARK ! the herald Angels sing,
“ Glory to the new-born King.
Peace on earth, and mercy mild,
God and sinners reconciled ! ”
Joyful, all ye nations, rise,
Join the triumph of the sides ;
With the Angelic Host proclaim
“ Christ is born in Bethlehem.”
Hark ! the herald Angels sing,
Glory to the new-born King.
2 Christ, by highest heaven adored ;
Christ, the Everlasting Lord,
Late in time behold Him come,
Offspring of a Virgin’s womb.


Veiled in flesh the Godhead see ;
Hail the Incarnate Deity !
Pleased as Man with men to dwell,
Jesus, our Immanuel.
Hark ! the herald Angels sing,
Glory to the new-born King.
Hail the heaven-born Prince of Peace !
Hail the Sun of Righteousness !
Light and life to all He brings,
Risen with healing in His wings.
Mild He lays His glory by,
Born that man no more may die,
Born to raise the sons of earth,
Born to give them second birth.
Hark ! the herald Angels sing,
Glory to the new-born King. Amen.
[lrregular.]
OCOME, ail ye faithful,
Joyful and triumphant,
0 come ye, 0 come ye to Bethlehem ;
Come and behold Him
Born the King of Angels ;
0 come, let us adore Him,
0 come, let us adore Him,
0 come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord.


2 God of God,
Light of Light,
Lo ! He abhors not the Virgin’s womb ;
Very God,
Begotten, not created;
0 come, let us adore Him,
0 come, let us adore Him,
0 come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord,
3 Sing, choirs of Angels,
Sing in exultation,
Sing, all ye citizens of heaven above :
“ Glory to God
In the highest; ”
0 come, let us adore Him,
0 come, let us adore Him,
0 come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord.
4 Yea, Lord, we greet Thee,
Born this happy morning ;
Jesu, to Thee be glory given ;
Word of the Father,
Now in flesh appearing ;
0 come, let us adore Him,
0 come, let us adore Him,
0 come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord.
Amen.


FOE, Thy mercy and Thy grace,
Constant through another year,
Hear our song of thankfulness,
Jesu, our Kedeemer, hear.
2 Lo ! our sins on Thee we cast —
Thee, our perfect Sacrifice, —
And, forgetting all the past,
Press towards our glorious prize.
3 Dark the future ; let Thy light
Guide us, Bright and Morning Star ;
Fierce our foes and hard the fight;
Arm us, Saviour, for the war.
4 In our weakness and distress,
Eock of strength, be Thou our Stay ;
In the pathless wilderness
Be our true and living Way.
5 Who of us death’s awful road
In the coming year shall tread,
With Thy rod and staff, 0 God,
Comfort Thou his dying bed.
6 Keep us faithful, keep us pure ;
Keep us evermore Thine own :
Help, 0 help us to endure ;
Fit us for the promised crown. Amen.


AS with gladness men of old
Did the guiding star behold ;
As with joy they hailed its light,
Leading onward, beaming bright;
So, most gracious God, may we
Evermore be led to Thee.
2 As with joyful steps they sped
To that lowly manger bed
There to bend the knee before
Him Whom heaven and earth adore ;
So may we, with willing feet
Ever seek Thy Mercy-seat.
3 As they offered gifts most rare
At that manger rude and bare ;
So may we, with holy joy,
Pure, and free from sin’s alloy,
All our costliest treasures bring,
Christ, to Thee, our heavenly King.
4 Holy Jesu, every day
Keep us in the narrow way ;
And, when earthly things are past,
Bring our ransomed souls at last
Where they need no star to guide,
Where no clouds Thy glory hide.


In the heavenly country bright
Need they no created light;
Thou its Light, its Joy, its Crown,
Thou its Sun, which goes not down ;
There for ever may we sing
Alleluias to our King. Amen.
[O.M.]
THE people that in darkness sat
A glorious light have seen ;
The Light has shined on them who long
In shades of death have been.
To hail Thee, Sun of Righteousness,
The gathering nations come ;
They joy as when the reapers bear
Their harvest treasures home.
For Thou their burden dost remove,
And break the tyrant’s rod,
As in the day when Midian fell
Before the sword of God.
For unto us a Child is born,
To us a Son is given,
And on His shoulder ever rests
All power in earth and heaven.
His Name shall be the Prince of Peace,
The Everlasting Lord,
The Wonderful, the Counsellor,
The God by all adored.


6 His righteous government and power
Shall over all extend ;
On judgment and on justice based,
His reign shall have no end.
7 Lord Jesu, reign in us, we pray,
And make us Thine alone,
Who with the Father ever art
And Holy Spirit One. Amen.
17.7-7.5.]
RACIOUS Spirit, Holy Ghost,
IT Taught by Thee, we covet most
Of Thy gifts at Pentecost
Holy, heavenly love.
2 Faith, that mountains could remove,
Tongues of earth or heaven above,
Knowledge, all things, empty prove
Without heavenly love.
3 Though I as a martyr bleed,
Give my goods the poor to feed,
All is vain, if love I need ;
Therefore, give me love.
4 Love is kind, and suffers long ;
Love is meek, and thinks no wrong;
Love than death itself more strong;
Therefore, give us love.


' 5 Prophecy will fade away,
Melting in the light of day ;
Love will ever with us stay ;
Therefore, give us love.
6 Faith will vanish into sight;
Hope be emptied in delight;
Love in heaven will shine more bright;
Therefore, give us love.
7 Faith and Hope and Love we see
Joining hand in hand agree ;
But the greatest of the three,
And the best, is Love. Amen.
[C.M.]
COME, Holy Ghost, our souls inspire,
And lighten with celestial fire ;
Thou the anointing Spirit art,
Who dost Thy sevenfold gifts impart:
2 Thy blessed unction from above
Is comfort, life, and fire of love ;
Enable with perpetual light
The dulness of our blinded sight;
3 Anoint and cheer our soiled face
With the abundance of Thy grace ;
K°ep far our foes, give peace at home ;
Where Thou art Guide no ill can come.


4 Teach us to know the Father, Son,
And Thee, of Both, to be but One ;
That through the ages all along
This may be our endless song,
Praise to Thy eternal merit,
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, Amen.
[6.5.]
CHRISTIAN, dost thou see them
On the holy ground,
How the troops of Midian
Prowl and prowl around ?
Christian, up and smite them,
Counting gain but loss ;
Smite them by the merit
Of the holy Cross.
2 Christian, dost thou feel them,
How they work within,
Striving, tempting, luring,
Goading into sin ?
Christian, never tremble;
Never be down-cast;
Smite them by the virtue
Of the Lenten fast.
3 Christian, dost thou hear them,
How they speak thee fair ?
“ Always fast and vigil ?
Always watch and prayer ? ”


Christian, answer boldly,
“ While I breathe I pray : ”
Peace shall follow battle,
Night shall end in day.
4 “Well I know thy trouble,
0 My servant true ;
Thou art very weary,—
I was weary too ;
But that toil shall make thee
Some day all Mine own,
And the end of sorrow
Shall be near My Throne.”
Amen.
[c.M.'
OGod, unseen yet ever near,
Thy Presence may we feel;
And, thus inspired with holy fear,
Before Thy table kneel.
2 Here may thy faithful people know
The blessings of Thy love,
The streams that through the desert flow
The manna from above.
3 We come, obedient to Thy Word,
To feast on heavenly Food ;
Our meat the body of the Lord
Our drink His precious Blood.


4 Thus may we all Thy Word obey.
For we, 0 God, are Thine ;
And go rejoicing on our way.
Renew’d with strength Divine. Amen.
[L.M.]
OCOME and mourn with me awhile ;
0 come ye to the Saviour’s side ;
0 come, together let us mourn ;
Jesus, our Lord, is crucified.
2 Have we no tears to shed for Him,
While soldiers scoff and Jews deride ?
Ah, look how patiently He hangs ;
Jesus, our Lord, is crucified.
3 Seven times He spake—seven words of love ;
And all three hours His silence cried
For mercy on the souls of men :
Jesus, our Lord, is crucified.
4 A broken heart, a fount of tears,
Ask, and they will not be denied;
A broken heart love’s cradle is ;
Jesus, our Lord, is crucified.
5 0 Love of God ! 0 sin of man !
In this dread act your strength is tried ;
And victory remains with love,
For He, our Love, is crucified. Amen.


[C.M.]
THERE is a green hill far away,
Without a city wall,
Where the dear Lord was crucified,
Who died to save us all.
2 We may not know, we cannot tell
What pains he had to bear,
But we believe it was for us
He hung and suffer’d there.
3 He died that we might be forgiven,
He died to make us good,
That we might go at last to Heav’n,
Saved by His precious blood.
4 There was no other good enough
To pay the price of sin,
He only could unlock the gate
Of Heav’n, and let us in.
5 Oh, dearly, dearly has He loved,
And we must love Him too,
And trust in His redeeming Blood,
And try His works to do. Amen.
LORD, in this Thy mercy’s day,
Ere it wholly pass away,
On our knees we fall and pray.


2 Holy Jesu, grant us tears,
Fill us with heart-searching fears,
Ere that awful doom appears.
3 Lord, on us Thy Spirit pour,
Kneeling lowly S,t Thy door,
Ere it close for evermore.
4 By Thy night of agony,
By Thy supplicating cry,
By Thy willingness to die,
5 By Thy tears of bitter woe
For Jerusalem below,
Let us not Thy love forego.
6 Grant us ’neath Thy wings a place,
Lest we lose this day of grace,
Lest we never see Thy face. Amen,
ALL glory, laud, and honour
To Thee, Redeemer, King ;
To Whom the lips of children
Made sweet Hosannas ring.
2 Thou art the King of Israel,
Thou David’s royal Son,
Who in the Lord’s Name comest,
The King and blessed One.
All glory, &c.


The company of Angels
Are praising Thee on high,
And mortal men and all things
Created make reply.
All glory, &c.
The people of the Hebrews
With palms before Thee went,
Our praise and prayer and anthems
Before Thee we present.
All glory, &c.
To Thee before Thy Passion
They raised their hymns of praise.
To Thee in glory reigning
Our melody we raise.
All glory, &c.
Thou didst accept their praises ;
Accept the prayers we bring ;
Who in all good delightest,
Thou good and gracious King.
All glory, praise, and honour
To Thee, Redeemer, King ;
To Whom the lips of children
Made sweet Hosannas ring. Amen.
SWEET the moments, rich in blessing,
Which before the ‘Cross we spend ;
Life, and health, and peace possessing
From the sinner’s dying Friend.


Best we here, for ever viewing
Mercy’s streams in streams of Blood ;
Precious drops, our souls bedewing,
Plead and claim our peace with God*
Truly blessed is the station,
Low before His Cross to lie,
While we see Divine compassion
Beaming in His languid eye.
Lord, in ceaseless contemplation
Fix our hearts and eyes on Thee,
Till we taste Thy whole salvation
And unveiled Thy glories see.
For Thy sorrows we adore Thee —
For the grief that wrought our peace —
Gracious Saviour, we implore Thee,
In our hearts Thy love increase.
Unto Thee, the world’s salvation,
Father, Spirit, unto Thee,
Low we bow in adoration,
Ever-blessed One in Three. Amen.
[C.M.]
ALL ye who seek for sure relief
In trouble and.distress,
Whatever sorrow vex the mind,
Or guilt the soul oppress :


2 Jesus, Who gave Himself for you
Upon the Cross to die,
Opens to you His sacred heart;
Oh, to that heart draw nigh.
3 Ye hear how kindly He invites ;
Ye hear His words so blest;
“ All ye that labour, come to Me,
And I will give you rest. ”
4 What meeker than the Saviour’s heart ?
As on the Cross He lay,
It did His murderers forgive,
And for their pardon pray.
5 0 heart! Thou Joy of Saints on high,
Thou Hope of sinners here,
Attracted by those loving words
To Thee I lift my prayer.
6 Wash Thou my Wounds in that dear Blood,
Which forth from Thee doth flow ;
New grace, new hope inspire ; a new
And better heart bestow. Amen,

Sinless in the sinner’s stead ;

Now He lives no more to die.

Man to God hath reconciled ;
Whilst in strange and awful strife
Met together Death and Life :

Haste with joy your vows to pay ;

Now he lives no more to die.

Now the first-bom from the dead,

HAIL to the Lord’s Anointed,
Great David’s greater Son !
Hail, in the time appointed,
His reign on earth begun !
He comes to break oppression,
To set the captive free ;
To take away transgression
And rule in equity.
2 He comes with succour speedy
To those who suffer wrong;
To help the poor and needy,
And bid the weak be strong;
To give them songs for sighing,
Their darkness turn to light,
Whose souls, condemned and dying,
Were precious in His sight.
C.2671. E


3 He shall come down like showers
Upon the fruitful earth ;
And love, joy, hope, like flowers,
Spring in His path to birth ;
Before Him, on the mountains,
Shall peace, the herald, go ;
And righteousness, in fountains,
From hill to valley flow.
4 Kings shall fall down before Him,
And gold and incense bring ;
All nations shall adore Him,
His praise all people sing;
For He shall have dominion
O’er river, sea, and shore,
Far as the eagle’s pinion
Or dove’s light wing can soar.
5 For Him shall prayer unceasing
And daily vows ascend ;
His Kingdom still increasing,
A Kingdom without end :
The mountain-dews shall nourish
A seed in weakness sown,
Whose fruit shall spread and flourish,
And shake like Lebanon.
6 O’er every foe victorious,
He on His throne shall rest,
From age to age more glorious,
All-blessing and all-blest;


The tide of time shall never
His covenant remove ;
His Name shall stand for ever,
That name to us is—Love. Amen.

He rises glorious from the dead ;
All glory to our risen Head !
Alleluia !
4 Lord, by the stripes which wounded Thee,
From Death’s dread sting Thy servants free,
That we may live and sing to Thee
Alleluia ! Amen!


HAIL the day that sees Him rise
Glorious to His native skies !

Re-ascends His native heaven.

Lift your heads, eternal gates ;
Wide unfold the radiant scene ;
Take the King of Glory in !
3 Him though highest heaven receives,
Still He loves the earth He leaves;
Though returning to His throne,
Still He calls mankind His own.
4 See ! He lifts His hands above,
See ! He shows the prints of love,
Hark ! the gracious lips bestow
Blessings on His Church below.
5 Still for us He intercedes ;
His prevailing Death He pleads ;
Near Himself prepares our place,
Harbinger of human race.
6 Lord, though parted from our sight,
High above yon azure height,
Grant our hearts may thither rise,
Following Thee beyond the skies.


7 There we shall with Thee remain,
Partners of Thy endless reign ;
There Thy face unclouded see,
Find our heaven of heavens in Thee. Amen.
HE is gone—A cloud of light
Has received Him from our sight;
High in heaven, where eye of men,
Follows not, nor Angel’s ken ;
Through the veils of time and space,
Passed into the Holiest place ;
All the toil, the sorrow done,
All the battle fought and won.
2 He is gone—Towards their goal
World and Church must onward roll ;
Far behind we leave the past;
Forward are our glances cast:
Still His words before us range
Through the ages as they change :
Wheresoe’er the truth shall lead,
He will give whate’er we need.
3 He is gone—But we once more
Shall behold Him as before ;
In the heaven of heavens the same,
As on earth He went and came.


In the many mansions there
Place for us He will prepare :
In that world unseen, unknown,
He and we may yet be one.
4 He is gone —But not in vain
Wait until He comes again :
He is risen, He is not here,
Far above this earthly sphere ;
Evermore in heart and mind
There our peace in Him we find
To our own eternal Friend,
Thitherward let us ascend. Amen.
[C.M.J
WHEN God of old came down from Heaven,
In power and wrath He came ;
Before His feet the clouds were riven,
Half darkness and half flame :
2 But when He came the second time,
He came in power and love ;
Softer than gale at morning prime
Hovered His Holy Dove.
3 The fires that rushed on Sinai down,
In sudden torrents dread,
Now gently light, a glorious crown,
On every sainted head.


4 And as on Israel’s awe-struck ear
The voice exceeding loud,
The trump, that Angels quake to hear,
Thrilled from the deep, dark cloud ;
5 So, when the Spirit of our God
Came down His flock to find,
A voice from heaven was heard abroad,
A rushing mighty wind.
6 It fills the Church of God ; it fills
The sinful world around ;
Only in stubborn hearts and wills
No place for it is found.
7 Come, Lord, come Wisdom, Love, and Power,
Open our ears to hear ;
Let us not miss the accepted hour ;
Save, Lord, by love or fear. Amen.
[11.12.12.10.]
HOLY, Holy, Holy ! Lord God Almighty !
Early in the morning our song shall rise
to Thee ;
Holy, Holy, Holy ! Merciful and Mighty !
God in Three Persons, blessed Trinity !
2 Holy, Holy, Holy ! All the Saints adore Thee,
Casting down their golden crowns around the
glassy sea ;


Cherubim and Seraphim falling down before
Thee,
Which wert, and art, and evermore shalt be.
3 Holy, Holy, Holy ! Though the darkness hide
Thee,
Though the eye of sinful man Thy glory may
not see,
Only Thou art holy, there is none beside Thee
Perfect in power, in love, and purity.
4 Holy, Holy, Holy ! Lord God Almighty !
All Thy works shall praise Thy Name in earth
and sky and sea.
Holy, Holy, Holy ! Merciful and Mighty !
God in Three Persons, blessed Trinity !
Amen.
[7.7.75.]
THREE in One, and One in Three,
Ruler of the earth and sea,
Hear us, while we lift to Thee
Holy chant and psalm.
2 Light of lights ! with morning shine
Lift on us Thy Light Divine ;
And let charity benign
Breathe on us her balm.


3 Light of lights ! when falls the even,
Let it close on sin forgiven ;
Foxd us in the peace of Heav’n ;
Shed a holy calm.
4 Three in One and One in Three,
Dimly here we worship Thee
With the Saints hereafter we
Hope to bear the palm. Amen.
[8.7.]
BRIGHT the vision that delighted
Once the sight of Judah’s seer;
Sweet the countless tongues united
To entrance the prophet’s ear.
2 Round the Lord in glory seated
Cherubim and Seraphim
Filled His temple, and repeated
Each to each the alternate hymn \
3 “ Thy glory fills the heaven ;
Earth is with its fulness stored ;
Unto Thee be glory given,
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord.”
4 Heaven is still with glory ringing,
Earth takes up the Angels’ cry,
Holy, Holy, Holy,”—singing,
“ Lord of Hosts, The Lord Most High.”


5 With His Seraph train before Him,
With His holy Church below,
Thus unite we to adore Him,
Bid we thus our anthem flow;
6 “ Lord, Thy glory fills the heaven;
Earth is with its fulness stored ;
Unto Thee be glory given,
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord.” Amen.
[10.10.10.4]
FOR all the Saints who from their labours rest,
Who Thee by faith before the world confest,
Thy Name, 0 Jesu, be for ever blest,
Alleluia !
2 Thou wast their Rock, their Fortress and their
Might;
Thou, Lord, their Captain in the well-fought
fight; . . ,
Thou in the darkness drear their one true Light.
Alleluia !
3 0 may Thy soldiers, faithful, true, and bold,
Fight as the Saints who nobly fought of old,
And win, with them, the victor’s crown of gold.
Alleluia !


4 0 blest communion ! Fellowship divine !
We feebly struggle ; they in glory shine ;
Yet all are one in Thee, for all are Thine.
Alleluia !
5 And when the strife is fierce, the warfare long,
Steals on the ear the distant triumph song,
And hearts are brave again, and arms are strong .
Alleluia !
6 The golden evening brightens in the west;
Soon, soon, to faithful warriors cometh rest;
Sweet is the calm of Paradise the blest.
Alleluia !
7 But lo ! there breaks a yet more glorious day ;
The Saints triumphant rise in bright array;
The King of Glory passes on His way.
Alleluia !
8 From earth’s wide bounds, from ocean’s farthest
coast,
Through gates of pearl streams in the countless
host,
Singing to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost —
Alleluia! Amen.

OGOD of love, 0 King of peace,
Make wars throughout the world to cease ;
The wrath of sinful man restrain ;
Give peace, 0 God, give peace again.


2 Remember, Lord, Thy works of old,
The wonders that our fathers told ;
Remember not our sin’s dark stain ;
Give peace, 0 God, give peace again.
3 Whom shall we trust but Thee, 0 Lord ?
Where rest but on Thy faithful word ?
None ever called on Thee in vain ;
Give peace, 0 God, give peace again.
4 Where Saints and Angels dwell above,
All hearts are knit in holy love ;
Oh, bind us in that heavenly chain ;
Give peace, 0 God, give peace again. Amen.
[6.7.6.7.6.6.6.6.]
IyTOW thank we all our God,
1M With heart, and hands, and voices,
Who wondrous things hath done,
In Whom His world rejoices ;
Who from our mother’s arms
Hath blessed us on our way
With countless gifts of love,
And still is ours to-day.
2 0 may this bounteous God
Through all our life be near us,
With ever-joyful hearts
And blessed peace to cheer us ;


And keep us in His grace,
And guide us when perplexed,
And free us from all ills
In this world and the next.
3 All praise and thanks to God
The Father now be given,
The Son, and Him Who reigns
With Them in highest heaven,
The One Eternal God,
Whom earth and heaven adore ;
For thus it was, is now,
And shall be evermore. Amen.
JESUS calls us ; o’er the tumult
Of our life’s wild, restless sea
Day by day His sweet voice soundeth.
Saying “ Christian, follow Me ; ”
2 As of old Saint Andrew heard it
By the Galilean lake,
Turned from home and toil and kindred,
Leaving all for His dear sake.
3 Jesus calls us from the worship
Of the vain world’s golden store,
From each idol that would keep us,
Saying “ Christian, love Me more.”


4 In our joys and in our sorrows,
Days of toil and hours of ease,
Still He calls, in cares and pleasures,
That we love Him more than these.
5 Jesus calls us : by Thy mercies,
Saviour make us hear Thy call,
Give our hearts to Thine obedience,
Serve and love Thee best of all. Amen.
ON the waters dark and drear,
Jesus, Saviour, Thou art near ;
With our ship where’er it roam,
As with loving friends at home.
2 Thou hast walked the heaving wave ;
Thou art mighty still to save ;
With one gentle word of peace
Thou canst bid the tempest cease.
3 Safely from the boisterous main
Bring us back to port again ;
In our haven we shall be,
Jesu, if we have but Thee.
4 Only by Thy power and love
Bit us for the port above ;
Still the deadly storm within,
Gusts of passion, waves of sin.


5 So when breaks the glorious dawn
Of the Resurrection morn,
When the night of toil is o’er,
We shall see Thee on the shore.
6 Holy Father, Holy Son,
Holy Spirit, Three in One ;
Praise unending unto Thee
Now and evermore shall be. Amen.
[S.M.]
WE give Thee but Thine own,
Whate’er the gift may be :
All that we have is Thine alone,
A trust, 0 Lord, from Thee.
2 May we Thy bounties thus
As stewards true receive,
And gladly, as Thou blessest us,
To Thee our first-fruits give.
3 Oh ! hearts are bruised and dead ;
And homes are bare and cold ;
And lambs for whom the Shepherd bled
Are straying from the fold.
4 To comfort and to bless,
To find a balm for woe,
To tend the lone and fatherless,
Is Angels’ work below.


5 The captive to release,
To God the lost to bring,
To teach the way of life and peace —
It is a Christ-like thing.
6 And we believe Thy word,
Though dim our faith may be ;
Whate’er for Thine we do, 0 Lord,
We do it unto Thee. Amen.
[8.5.8.3 J
HOLY Father, in Thy mercy
Hear our anxious prayer,
Keep our loved ones, now far absent,
’Neath Thy care.
2 Jesus, Saviour, let Thy presence
Be their light and guide ;
Keep, Oh keep them, in their weaknes*,
At Thy side.
3 When in sorrow, when in danger,
When in loneliness,
In Thy love look down and comfort
Their distress.
4 May the joy of Thy salvation
Be their strength and stay ;
May they love and may they praise Thee
Day by day.


5 Holy Spirit, let Thy teaching
Sanctify their life ;
Send Thy grace, that they may conquer
In the strife.
6 Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
God the One in Three,
Bless them, guide them, save them, keep them
Near to Thee. Amen.

ALMIGHTY Father, hear our cry,
As o’er the trackless deep we roam ;
Be Thou our haven always nigh,
On homeless waters Thou our home.
2 0 Jesus, Saviour, at Whose voice
The tempest sank to perfect rest,
Bid Thou the fearful heart rejoice,
And cleanse and calm the troubled breast.
3 0 Holy Ghost, beneath Whose power
The ocean woke to life and light,
Command Thy blessing in this hour,
Thy fostering warmth, Thy quickening might!
4 Great God, Triune Jehovah, Thee
We love, we worship, we adore ;
Our Refuge on time’s changeful sea,
Our Joy on heaven’s eternal shore. Amen.

To sing with heart and voice,
God save the King.
5 Far from the Empire’s heart,
Make us a worthy part;

Keep us for ever Thine,
Our land Thy southern shrine,
And in Thy grace divine ;

ALL hail the power of Jesu’s Name !
Let Angels prostrate fall;
Bring forth the royal diadem
To crown Him Lord of all.


2 Crown Him, ye martyrs of your God
Who from His Altar call;
Praise Him Whose blood-stained path ye trod
And crown Him Lord of all.
3 Ye seed of Israel’s chosen race,
Ye ransomed of the fall,
Hail Him Who saves you by His grace,
And crown Him Lord of all.
4 Hail Him, ye heirs of David’s line,

The wormwood and the gall;
Go ! spread your trophies at His feet,
And crown Him Lord of all.
6 Let every tribe and every tongue
Before Him prostrate fall,
Join in the universal song
And crown Him Lord of all. Amen.

TIIHE Sou of God goes forth to war,

His blood-red banner streams afar;
Who follows in His train ?


2 Who best can drink his cup of woe,
Triumphant over pain;
Who patient bears his cross below,
*
He follows in His train.
3 The Martyr first, whose eagle eye
Could pierce beyond the grave ;
Who saw his Master in the sky,
And called on Him to save.
4 Like Him, with pardon on his tongue,
In midst of mortal pain,
He prayed for them that did the wrong;
Who follows in his train ?
5 A glorious band, the chosen few,
On whom the Spirit came ;
Twelve valiant Saints, their hope they knew,
And mocked the cross and flame.
6 They met the tyrant’s brandished steel,
The lion’s gory mane ;
They bowed their necks the death to feel;
Who follows in their train ?
7 A noble army, men and boys,
The matron and the maid,
Around the Saviour’s throne rejoice,
In robes of light arrayed.


8 They climbed the steep ascent of heaven
Through peril, toil, and pain :
0 God, to us may grace be given
To follow in their train. Amen.

ALL people that on earth do dwell,
Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice
Him serve with fear, His praise forth tell,
Come ye before Him, and rejoice.
The Lord, ye know, is God indeed ;
Without our aid He did us make ;
We are His folk, He doth us feed ;
And for His sheep He doth us take.
0 enter then His gates with praise,
Approach with joy His courts unto ;
Praise, laud, and bless His Name always,
For it is seemly so to do.
For why ? the Lord our God is good ;
His mercy is for ever sure ;
His truth at all times firmly stood,
And shall from age to age endure. Amen.

ART thou weary, art thou languid,
Art thou sore distrest ?
“ Come to Me ” —saith One —“ and coming,
Be at rest! ”


2 Hath He marks to lead me to Him,
If He be my Guide ?
In His feet and hands are wound-prints,
And His side.
3 Is there diadem, as Monarch,
That His brow adorns ?
Yea, a crown, in very surety,
But of thorns.
4 If I find Him, if I follow,
What His guerdon here ?
Many a sorrow, many a labour,
Many a tear.
5 If I still hold closely to Him,
What hath He at last ?
Sorrow vanquished, labour ended,
Jordan past.
6 If I ask Him to receive me,
Will He say me nay ?
Not till earth, and not till heaven
Pass away.
7 Finding, following, keeping, struggling,
Is He sure to bless ?
Angels, Martyrs, Prophets, Virgins,
Answer, “ Yes ! ” Amen.

Lean, and His mercy will provide ;
Lean, and the trusting soul shall prove
Christ is its life, and Christ its love.

He changeth not, and thou art dear;
Only believe, and thou shalt see
That Christ is all in all to thee. Amen.

“ TjlOR ever with the Lord !”
JC Amen, so let it be ;
Life from the dead is in that word,
’Tis immortality.
Here in the body pent,
Absent from Him I roam,
Yet nightly pitch my moving tent
A day’s march nearer home.
2 My Father’s house on high,
Home of my soul, how near
At times to faith’s foreseeing eye
The golden gates appear !
Ah ! then my spirit faints
To reach the land I love,
The bright inheritance of Saints,
Jerusalem above.


3 “ For ever with the Lord !”
Father, if ’tis Thy will,
The promise of that faithful word
E’en here to me fulfil;
Be Thou at my right hand,
Then can I never fail;
Uphold Thou me, and I shall stand ;
Fight, and I must prevail.
4 So, when my latest breath
Shall rend the veil in twain,
By death I shall escape from death,
And life eternal gain.
Knowing as I am known,
How shall I love that word,
And oft repeat before the throne,
“ For ever with the Lord !” Amen.

LORIOUS things of Thee are spoken,
VJT Zion, city of our God ;
He, Whose word cannot be broken,
Formed thee for His own abode :
On the Rock of Ages founded,
What can shake thy sure repose ?
With salvation’s walls surrounded,
Thou mayest smile at all thy foes.


2 See, the streams of living waters
Springing from eternal love,
Well supply thy sons and daughters,
And all fear of want remove.
Who can faint when such a river,
Ever flows their thirst to assuage ?
Grace which, like the Lord the Giver,
Never fails from age to age.
3 Round each habitation hovering,
See the cloud and fire appear,
For a glory and a covering,
Showing that the Lord is near.
Thus they march, the pillar leading,
Light by night, and shade by day,
Daily on the manna feeding,
Which He gives them when they pray.
4 Saviour, if of Zion’s city
I through grace a member am.
Let the world deride or pity,
I will glory in Thy name ;
Fading is the worldling’s pleasure,
All its boasted pomp and show ;
Solid joys and lasting treasure,
None but Zion’s children know. Amen.


[O.M, j
JESU, the very thought of Thee
With sweetness fills the breast;
But sweeter far Thy face to see,
And in Thy Presence rest.
2 No voice can sing, no heart can frame,
Nor can the memory find,
A sweeter sound than Jesu’s Name
The Saviour of mankind.
3 0 Hope of every contrite heart,
0 Joy of all the meek,
To those who ask how kind Thou art,
How good to those who seek.
4 But what to those who find ? Ah ! this
Nor tongue nor pen can show ;
The love of Jesus, what it is
None but His loved ones know.
5 Jesu, our only Joy be Thou,
As Thou our Prize wilt be ;
In Thee be all our glory now.
And through eternity. Amen.
G1 OD of mercy, God of grace,
IT Show the brightness of Thy face ;


Shine upon us, Saviour, shine,
Fill Thy Church with light divine ;
And Thy saving health extend
Unto earth’s remotest end.
2 Let the people praise Thee, Lord ;
Be by all that live adored ;
Let the nations shout and sing
Glory to their Saviour King ;
At Thy feet their tribute pay,
And Thy holy will obey.
3 Let the people praise Thee, Lord ;
Earth shall then her fruits afford ;
God to man His blessing give,
Man to God devoted live ;
All below and all above,
One in joy, and light, and love. Amen.
HARK, my soul! it is the Lord ;
’Tis thy Saviour, hear His word ;
Jesus speaks, and speaks to thee,
“ Say, poor sinner, lovest thou me ?
2 “ I delivered thee when bound,
And, when wounded, healed thy wound;
Sought thee wandering, set thee right,
Turned thy darkness into light.


3 “ Can a woman’s tender care
Cease towards the child she bare ?
Yes, she may forgetful be,
Yet will I remember thee.
4 “ Mine is an unchanging love,
Higher than the heights above,
Deeper than the depths beneath,
Free and faithful, strong as death.
5 “ Thou shalt see My glory soon,
When the work of grace is done ;
Partner of My throne shalt be ;
Say, poor sinner, lovest thou Me ? ”
6 Lord, it is my chief complaint
That my love is weak and faint;
Yet I love Thee, and adore ;
Oh for grace to love Thee more. Amen.
[C.M.]
HOW sweet the Name of Jesus sounds
In a believer’s ear !
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,
And drives away his fear.
2 It makes the wounded spirit whole,
And calms the troubled breast;
’Tis manna to the hungry soul,
And to the weary rest.


3 Dear Name ! the rock on which I build,
My shield and hiding place,
My never-failing treasury, filled
With boundless stores of grace.
4 Jesus ! my Shepherd, Brother, Friend,
My Prophet, Priest, and King,
My Lord, my Life, my Way, my End,
Accept the praise I bring.
5 Weak is the effort of my heart,
And cold my warmest thought;
But when I see Thee as Thou art,
I’ll praise Thee as I ought.
6 Till then I would Thy love proclaim
With every fleeting breath ;
And may the music of Thy Name
Refresh my soul in death. Amen.
TT7HEN the dark waves round us roll,
VV And we look in vain for aid,
Speak, Lord, to the trembling soul,—
“Itis I; be not afraid.”
2 When we dimly trace Thy form
In mysterious clouds arrayed,
Be the echo of the storm, —
“Jtis I; be not afraid.”


3 When our brightest hopes depart,
When our fairest visions fade,
Whisper to the fainting heart, —
“Itis I; be not afraid.”
4 When we weep beside the bier
Where some well-loved form is laid,
0 may then the mourner hear, —
“Itis I; be not afraid.”
5 When with wearing hopeless pain
Sinks the spirit sore dismayed,
Breathe thou then the comfort-strain, —
“Itis I; be not afraid.”
6 When we feel the end is near,
Passing into death’s dark shade,
May the voice be strong and clear, —
“Itis I; be not afraid.” Amen.

mAKE up the cross, the Saviour said
1 If thou wouldst My disciple be ;
Deny thyself, the world forsake,
And humbly follow after Me.
2 Take up thy cross ; let not its weight
Fill thy weak spirit with alarm ;
His strength shall bear thy spirit up,
And brace thy heart, and nerve thine arm


Take up thy cross, nor heed the shame,
Nor let thy foolish pride rebel;
Thy Lord for thee the Cross endured,
To save thy soul from death and hell.
Take up thy cross then in His strength,
And calmly every danger brave ;
’Twill guide thee to a better home,
And lead to victory o’er the grave.
Take up thy cross, and follow Christ,
Nor think till death to lay it down ;
For only he who bears the cross
May hope to wear the glorious crown.
To Thee, Great Lord, the One in Three,
All praise for evermore ascend ;
0 grant us in our Home to see
The heavenly life that knows no end. Amen,

5 When in grief we languish,
He will dry the tear,

Soothes with succour near.

6 In the solemn hour of dying,
In the awful judgment day,
May our souls, on Thee relying,
Find Thee still our rock and stay :
By Thy mercy,
Oh deliver'us, good Lord. Amen.
JESUS shall reign where’er the sun
Does his successive journeys run ;
His kingdom stretch from shore to shore
Till moons shall wax and wane no more.
2 To Him shall endless prayer be made,
And princes throng to crown His head ;
His Name like sweet perfume shall rise
With every morning sacrifice.
3 People and realms of every tongue
Dwell on His love with sweetest song ;
And infant voices shall proclaim
Their early blessings on His Name.
4 Blessings abound where’er He reigns ;
The prisoner leaps to loose his chains ;
The weary find eternal rest,
And all the sons of want are blest.
5 Let every creature rise and bring
Peculiar honours to our King ;
Angels descend with songs again,
And earth repeat the long Amen. Amen.


[8.7.1
LEAD us, heavenly Father, lead us
O’er the world’s tempestuous sea ;
Guard us, guide us, keep us, feed us,
For we have no help but Thee ;
Yet possessing every blessing,
If our God our Father be.
2 Saviour, breathe forgiveness o’er us,
All our weakness Thou dost know ;
Thou didst tread this earth before us,
Thou didst feel its keenest woe :
Lone and dreary, faint and weary,
Through the desert Thou didst go
3 Spirit of our God, descending,
Fill our hearts with heavenly joy,
Love with every passion blending,
Pleasure that can never cloy.
Thus provided, pardoned, guided,
Nothing can our peace destroy. Amen.
[C.M.]
LORD, as to Thy dear Cross we flee,
And plead to be forgiven,
So let Thy life our pattern be,
And form our souls for heaven.


2 Help us, through good report and ill,
Our daily cross to bear ;
Like Thee, to do our Father’s will,
Our brethren’s griefs to share.
3 Let grace our selfishness expel,
Our earthliness refine ;
And kindness in our bosoms dwell,
As free and true as Thine.
4 If joy shall at Thy bidding fly,
And grief’s dark day come on,
We in our turn would meekly cry,
“ Father, Thy will be done.”
5 Kept peaceful in the midst of strife,
Forgiving and forgiven,
Oh may we lead the pilgrim’s life,
And follow Thee to heaven. Amen.
[C.M.]
lORD, when we bend before Thy throne,
J And our confessions pour,
Teach us to feel the sins we own,
And hate what we deplore.
2 Our broken spirits pitying see ;
True penitence impart;
Then let a kindling glance from The«
Beam hope upon the heart.


3 When our responsive tongues essay
Their grateful hymns to raise,
Grant that our souls may join the lay
And mount to Thee in praise.
4 When we disclose our wants in prayer,
May we our wills resign,
And not a thought our bosom share
That is not wholly Thine.

5 Let faith each meek petition fill,
And waft it to the skies ;
And teach our hearts ’tis goodness still
That grants it. or denies. Amen.
[11.11.11.6.]
LORD of our life, and God of our salvation,
Star of our night, and Hope of every nation
Hear and receive Thy Church’s supplication,
Lord God Almighty.
2 See round Thine ark the hungry billows curling,
See how Thy foes their banners are unfurling;
Lord, while their darts envenomed they are
hurling,
Thou canst preserve us.
3 Lord, Thou canst help when earthly armour
faileth,
Lord, Thou canst save when deadly sin assaileth,
Lord, o’er Thy Rock nor death nor hell prevaileth,
Grant us Thy peace, Lord.


4 Peace in our hearts, our evil thoughts assuaging,
Peace in Thy Church, where brothers are engaging
Peace when the world its busy war is waging,
Calm Thy foes raging.
5 Grant us Thy help till backward they are driven,
Grant them Thy truth, that they may be for-
given,
Grant peace on earth, and, after we have striven,
Peace in Thy heaven. Amen.

OGOD of Jacob, by Whose hand
Thy people still are fed ;
Who through this weary pilgrimage
Hast all our fathers led ;
2 Our vows, our prayers we now present
Before Thy throne of grace ;
God of our fathers, be the God
Of their succeeding race.
3 Through each perplexing path of life
Our wandering footsteps guide ;
Give us each day our daily bread,
And raiment fit provide.
4 0 spread Thy covering wings around,
Till all our wanderings cease,
And at our Father’s loved abode
Our feet arrive in peace. Amen.


[C.M.]
OGOD, our Help in ages past,
Our Hope for years to come,
Our Shelter from the stormy blast,
And our eternal Home ;
2 Under the shadow of Thy throne
Thy Saints have dwelt secure r
Sufficient is Thine arm alone,
And our defence is sure.
3 Before the hills in order stood.
Or earth received her frame.
From everlasting Thou art God,
To endless years the same.
4 A thousand ages in Thy sight
Are like an evening gone,
Short as the watch that ends the night
Before the rising sun.
5 Time, like an ever-rolling stream,
Bears all its sons away ;
They fly, forgotten, as a dream
Dies at the opening day.
6 0 God, our Help in ages past,
Our Hope for years to come,
Be Thou our Guard while troubles last,
And our eternal Home. Amen.

0 HAPPY band of pilgrims,
If onward ye will tread
With Jesus as your Fellow
To Jesus as your Head !
Oh, happy, if ye labour
As Jesus did for men :
Oh, happy, if ye hunger
As Jesus hungered then !
2 The Faith by which ye see Him,
The Hope in which ye yearn,
The Love that through all trouble*
To Him alone will turn, —
What are they but His heralds
To lead you to His sight ?
What are they save the effluence
Of uncreated Light ?
3 The trials that beset you,
The sorrows ye endure.
The manifold temptations
That death alone can cure, —
What are they but His jewels
Of right celestial worth ?
What are they but the ladder
Set up to heaven on earth ?


4 The Cross that Jesus carried,
He carried as your due ;
The Crown that Jesus weareth,
He weareth it for you.
0 happy band of pilgrims,
Look upward to the skies,
Where such a light affliction
Shall win you such a prize ! Amen.
[l.m.]
OLOVE, how deep ! how broad ! how high !
It fills the heart with ecstasy
That God, the Son of God, should take
Our mortal form for mortals’ sake.
2 He sent no Angel to our race,
Of higher or of lower place,
But wore the robe of human frame,
And He Himself to this world came.
3 Nor willed He only to appear,
His pleasure was to tarry here ;
And God-and-Man with man would be
The space of thirty years and three.
4 For us baptised, for us He bore
His holy fast hungered sore ;
For us temptation sharp He knew,
For us the tempter overthrew.


5 For us He preaches and He prays,
Would do all things, would try all ways,
By words and signs and actions thus
Still seeking not Himself but us.
6 For us to wicked men betrayed,
Scourged, mocked, in purple robe arrayed,
For us He bore the Cross’s death ;
For us at length gave up His breath.
7 For us He rose from death again,
For us He went on high to reign,
For us He sent His Spirit here
To guide, to strengthen, and to cheer.
8 To Him Whose boundless love has won
Salvation for us through His Son,
To Glod the Father, glory be
Both now and through eternity. Amen.
[8.8.6.]
OLORD, how happy should we be
If we could cast our care on Thee,
If we from self could rest;
And feel at heart that One above
In perfect wisdom, perfect love,
Is working for the best.
2 How far from this our daily life,
How oft disturbed by anxious strife,
sudden wild alarms ;


Oh, could we but relinquish all
Our earthly props, and simply fall
On Thy almighty arms !
3 Could we but kneel and cast our load,
E’en while we pray, upon our God ;
Then rise with lightened cheer,
Sure that the Father, Who is nigh
To still the famished raven’s crv,
Will hear in that we fear.
4 We cannot trust Him as we should ;
So chafes frail nature’s restless mood
To cast its peace away ;
Yet birds and flowerets round us preach,
All, all the present evil teach
Sufficient for the day.
5 Lord, make these faithless hearts of ours
Such lessons learn from birds and flowers
Make them from self to cease,
Leave all things tn a Father’s will,
And taste, before Him lying still,
E’en in affliction, peace. Amen.
OFT in danger, oft in woe,
Onward, Christians, onward go,
Fight the fight, maintain the strife,
Strengthened with the Bread of Life.


Onward, Christians, onward go,
Join the war and face the foe ;
Faint not! Much doth yet remain,
Dreary is the long campaign.
Shrink not, Christians ! Will ye yield ?
Will ye quit the painful field ?
Will ye flee in danger’s hour ?
Know ye not your Captain’s power ?
Let your drooping hearts be glad ;
March, in heavenly armour clad ;
Fight, nor think the battle long ;
Victory soon shall tune your song.
Let not sorrow dim your eye ;
Soon shall every tear be dry :
Let not woe your course impede ;
Great your strength, if great your need.
Onward then to battle move ;
More than conquerors ye shall prove ;
Though opposed by many a foe,
Christian soldiers, onward go. Amen.
[8.8.8.6.]
JUST as I am, without one plea
But that Thy Blood was shed for me,
And that Thou bidd’st me come to Thee,
0 Lamb of God, I come !


2 Just as I am, and waiting not
To rid my soul of one dark blot,
To Thee, Whose Blood can cleanse each spot,
0 Lamb of God, I come !
3 Just as I am, though tossed about
With many a conflict, many a doubt,
Fightings and fears within, without,
0 Lamb of God, I come !
4 Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind,
Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
Yea, all I need, in Thee to find,
0 Lamb of God, I come !
5 Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve,
Because Thy promise I believe,
0 Lamb of God, I come !
6 Just as I am, Thy love unknown
Has broken every barrier down ;
Now, to be Thine, yea, Thine alone,
0 Lamb of God, I come !
[C.M.]
Ohelp us, Lord ; each hour of need
Thy heavenly succour give :
Help us in thought, and word, and deed,
Each hour on earth we live.


2 0 help us when our spirits bleed
With contrite anguish sore ;
And when our hearts are cold and dead,
0 help us, Lord, the more.
3 0 help us through the prayer of faith
More firmly to believe ;
For still the more the servant hath,
The more shall he receive.
4 0 help us, Saviour, from on high :
We know no help but Thee ;
0 help us so to live and die
As Thine in heaven to be. Amen.
[5.5.5.5.6.5.6.5.]
0 worship the King
All glorious above,
0 gratefully sing
His power and His love,
Our Shield and Defender,
The Ancient of days,
Pavilioned in splendour,
And girded with praise !
2 0 tell of His might,
0 sing of His grace,
Whose robe is the light,
Whose canopy space.


His chariots of wrath
The deep thunder-clouds form,
And dark is His path
On the wings of the storm.
The earth with its store
Of wonders untold,
Almighty, Thy power
Hath founded of old,
Hath stablished it fast
By a changeless decree,
And round it hath cast,
Like a mantle, the sea.
Thy bountiful care
What tongue can recite ?
It breathes in the air ;
It shines in the light;
It streams from the hills ;
It descends to the plain;
And sweetly distils
In the dew and the rain
Frail children of dust,
And feeble as frail,
In Thee do we trust,
Nor find Thee to fail;
Thy mercies how tender,
How firm to the end !
Our Maker, Defender,
Redeemer, and Friend!


6 0 measureless Might!
Ineffable Love!
While Angels delight
To hymn Thee above,
The humbler creation,
Though feeble their lays,
With true adoration
Shall lisp to Thy praise. Amen.
[5.6.8.4
OUR blest Redeemer, ere He breathed
His tender last farewell,
A Guide, a Comforter bequeathed
With us to dwell.
2 He came sweet influence to impart,
A gracious, willing Guest,
While He can find one humble heart
Wherein to rest.
3 And His that gentle voice we hear,
Soft as the breath of even,
That checks each fault, that calms each fear,
And speaks of heaven.
4 And every virtue we possess,
And every victory won,
And every thought of holiness,
Are His alone.


5 Spirit of purity and grace,
Our weakness, pitying, see ;
Oh, make our hearts Thy dwelling-place.
And worthy Thee. Amen,
ROCK of ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee ;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy riven side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure,
Cleanse me from its guilt and power.
2 Not the labours of my hands
Can fulfil Thy law’s demands ;
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears for ever flow,
All for sin could not atone ;
Thou must save, and Thou alone.
3 Nothing in my hand I bring,
Simply to Thy Cross I cling ;
Naked, come to Thee for dress ;
Helpless, look to Thee for grace ;
Foul, I to the Fountain fly—
Wash me, Saviour, or I die !


4 While I draw this fleeting breath,
When my eyes are closed in death,
When I soar to worlds unknown,
See Thee on Thy judgment-throne,
Rock of ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee ! Amen.
[O.M.]
SHEPHERD Divine, our wants relieve
In this our evil day ;
To all Thy tempted followers give
The power to watch and pray.
2 Long as our fiery trials last,
Long as the cross we bear,
Oh let our souls on Thee be cast
In never-ceasing prayer.
3 The Spirit of interceding grace
Give us in faith to claim ;
To wrestle till we see Thy face,
And know Thy hidden Name.
4 Till Thou Thy perfect love impart,
Till Thou Thyself bestow,
Be this the cry of every heart,
“ I will not let Thee go.”
5 I will not let Thee go, unless
Thou tell Thy Name to me ;
With all Thy great Salvation bless,
And make me all like Thee,


6 Then let me on the mountain top
Behold Thy open face ;
Where faith in sight is swallowed up,
And prayer in endless praise. Amen.
[C.M.]
THROUGH all the changing scenes of life,
In trouble and in joy,
The praises of my God shall still
My heart and tongue employ.
0 magnify the Lord with me,
With me exalt His Name ;
When in distress to Him I called,
He to my rescue came.
The hosts of God encamp around
The dwellings of the just;
Deliverance He affords to all
Who on His succour trust.
0 make but trial of His love,
Experience will decide
How blest are they, and only they,
Who in His truth confide.
Fear Him, ye Saints, and you will then
Have nothing else to fear;
Make you His service your delight,
He’ll make your wants His care.


6 To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
The God Whom we adore,
Be glory, as it was, is now,
And shall be evermore. Amen.
[L.M.]
WHEN I survey the wondrous Cross
On which the Prince of Glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.
Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
Save in the cross of Christ my God;
All the vain things that charm me most
I sacrifice them to His Blood.
See ! from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingling down ;
Did e’er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown ?
Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were an offering far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all. Amen.
[C.M.]
WHEN wounded sore the stricken soul
Lies bleeding and unbound,
One only hand, a pierced hand,
Can salve the sinner’s wound.


2 When sorrow swells the laden breast,
And tears of anguish flow,
One only heart, a broken heart,
Can feel the sinner’s woe.
3 When penitence has wept in vain
Over some foul dark spot,
One only stream, a stream of Blood,
Can wash away the blot.
4 ’Tis Jesus’ Blood that washes white,
His hand that brings relief,
His heart that’s touched with all our joys,
And feeleth for our grief.
5 Lift up Thy bleeding hand, 0 Lord,
Unseal that cleansing Tide ;
We have no shelter from our sin
But in Thy wounded side. Amen.
14HY way, not mine, 0 Lord,
However dark it be ;
Lead me by Thine own hand,
Choose out the path for me.
2 Smooth let it be or rough,
It will be still the best;
Winding or straight, it leads
Bight onward to Thy rest,


3 I dare not choose my lot;
I would not if I might;
Choose Thou for me, my God,
So shall I walk aright.
4 The kingdom that I seek
Is Thine; so let the way
That leads to it be Thine,
Else I must surely stray,
5 Take Thou my cup, and it
With joy or sorrow fill,
As best to Thee may seem ;
Choose Thou my good and ill.
6 Choose Thou for me my friends,
My sickness or my health ;
Choose Thou my cares for me,
My poverty or wealth.
7 Not mine, not mine, the choice.
In things or great or small;
Be Thou my Guide, my Strength,
My Wisdom, and my AIL Amen.
[10.4.10.4.10.10.]
LEAD, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom
Lead Thou me on ;
The night is dark, and I am far from home ;
Lead thou me on.
Keep Thou my feet; Ido not ask to see
The distant scene ; one for me.


2 I was not ever thus, nor prayed that Thou
Shouldst lead me on ;
I loved to choose and see my path ; but now
Lead Thou me on.
I loved the garish day, and, spite of fears,
Pride ruled my will: remember not past years.
3 So long Thy power hath blest me, sure it still
Will lead me on
O er moor and fen, o’er crag and torrent, till
The night is gone,
And with the morn those Angel faces smile
Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile.
Amen.
[S.M.]
Soldiers of Christ, arise,
And put your armour on,
Strong in the strength which God supplies
Through His eternal Son :
Strong in the Lord of Hosts,
And in His mighty power ;
Who in the strength of Jesus trusts
Is more than conqueror.
Stand, then, in His great might,
With all His strength endued ;
And take, to arm you for the fight,
The panoply of God.


4 From strength to strength go on,
Wrestle, and fight, and pray,
Tread all the powers of darkness down,
And win the well-fought day ;
5 That, having all things done,
And all your conflicts past,
Ye may o’ercome through Christ alone,
And victor stand at last. Amen.
[D.O.M.
I HEARD the voice of Jesus say,
“ Come unto me and rest;
Lay down, thou weary one, lay down
Thy head upon My breast.”
I came to Jesus as I was,
Weary, and worn, and sad;
I found in Him a resting-place,
And He has made me glad.
2 I heard the voice of Jesus say,
“ Behold, I freely give
The living water ; thirsty one,
Stoop down, and drink, and live.”
I came to Jesus, and I drank
Of that life-giving stream ;
My thirst was quenched, my soul revived,
And now I live in Him.


3 1 heard the voice of Jesus say,
“ I am this dark world’s Light;
Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise,
And all thy day be bright.”
I looked to Jesus, and I found
In Him my Star, my Sun ;
And in that Light of life I’ll walk
Till travelling days are done.
Amen.
(6.6.4.]
rPHOU, Whose Almighty word
X Chaos and darkness heard,
And took their flight,
Hear us, we humbly pray,
And where the Gospel-day
Sheds not its glorious ray
Let there be light.
2 Thou, Who didst come to bring,
On Thy redeeming wing,
Healing and sight;
Health to the sick in mind,
Sight to the inly blind,
Oh, now to all mankind
Let there be light.
3 Spirit of truth and love.
Life-giving, holy Dove,
Speed forth Thy flight;


Move on the waters’ face,
Bearing the lamp of grace,
And in earth’s darkest place
Let there be light.
4 Blessed and Holy Three,
Glorious Trinity,
Wisdom, Love, Might;
Boundless as ocean’s tide
Rolling in fullest pride,
Through the world, far and wide,
Let there be light. Amen.
[6.4.G.4.6.6.4.]
VT BARER, my God, to Thee,
IM Nearer to Thee ;
E’en though it be a cross
That raiseth me,
Still all my song would be—
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee.
2 Though like the wanderer,
The sun gone down,
Darkness be over me —
My rest a stone ;
Yet in my dreams I’d be
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee.


3 Then let the way appear
Steps unto heaven,
All that Thou sendest me
In mercy given;
Angels to beckon me
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee,
4 Then, with my waking thoughts
Bright with Thy praise,
Out of my stony griefs
Beth-el I’ll raise ;
So by my woes to be
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee.
5 Or if on joyful wing
Cleaving the sky,
Sun, moon, and stars forgot,
Upwards I fly,
Still all my song shall be,
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee. Amen.
[L.M.]
TmiERE high the heavenly temple stands,
t tine house of God not made with hands
A great High-priest our nature wears,
The Guardian of mankind appears*


He Who for men their Surety stood,
And poured on earth His precious Blood,
Pursues in heaven His mighty plan,
The Saviour and the Friend of man.
Though now ascended up on high,
He bends on earth a brother’s eye ;
Partaker of the human name,
He knows the frailty of our frame.
Our Fellow-sufferer yet retains
A fellow-feeling of our pains ;
And still remembers in the sides
His tears, His agonies, and cries.
In every pang that rends the heart
The Man of Sorrows had a part;
He sympathises with our grief,
And to the sufferer sends relief.
With boldness, therefore, at the throne,
Let us make all our sorrows known,
And ask the aid of heavenly power
To help us in the evil hour. Amen.
STAND up !—stand up for Jesus !
Ye soldiers of the Cross ;
Lift high His royal banner,
It must not suffer loss.


From victory unto victory
His army shall He lead,
Till every foe is vanquish’d,
And Christ is Lord indeed.
2 Stand up ! —stand up for Jesus !
The solemn watchword hear ;
If while ye sleep He suffers,
Away with shame and fear ;
Where’er ye meet with evil,
Within you or without,
Charge for the God of battles,
And put the foe to rout.
3 Stand up ! —stand up for Jesus !
The trumpet call obey ;
Forth to the mighty conflict
In this His glorious day.
Ye that are men now serve Him
Against unnumber’d foes ;
Let courage rise with danger
And strength to strength oppose.
4 Stand up ! —stand up for Jesus !
Stand in His strength alone ;
The arm of flesh will fail you,
Ye dare not trust your own.
Put on the Gospel armour,
Each piece put on with prayer ;
When duty calls or danger,
Be never wanting there.
C.2671. G


5 Stand up ! —stand up for Jesus !
The strife will not be long ;
This day the noise of battle,
The next the victor’s song.
To him that overcometh,
A crown of life shall be ;
lie with the King of Glory
Shall reign eternally. Amen.
[C.M. ]
HOW bright these glorious spirits shine !
Whence all their white array ?
How came they to the blissful seats
Of everlasting day ?
2 Lo ! these are they, from sufferings great,
Who came to realms of light;
And in the Blood of Christ have washed
Those robes which shine so bright.
3 Now with triumphal palms they stand
Before the throne on high,
And serve the God they love amidst
The glories of the sky.
4 His presence fills each heart with joy,
Tunes every mouth to sing ;
By day, by night, the sacred courts
With glad Hosannas ring.


Hunger and thirst are felt no more,
Nor sun with scorching ray ;
God is their Sun, Whose cheering beams
Diffuse eternal day.
The Lamb, Which dwells amidst the throne,
Shall o’er them still preside,
Feed them with nourishment Divine,
And all their footsteps guide.
In pastures green He’ll lead His flock,
Where living streams appear ;
And God the Lord from every eye
Shall wipe off every tear. Amen.
BRIEF life is here our portion;
Brief sorrow, short-lived care;
The life that knows no ending,
The tearless life, is there.
0 happy retribution !
Short toil, eternal rest;
For mortals and for sinners
A mansion with the blest!
And now we fight the battle,
But then shall wear the crown
Of full and everlasting
And passionless renown ;


4 And now we watch and struggle,
And now we live in hope,
And Sion in her anguish
With Babylon must cope ;
5 But He, Whom now we trust in,
Shall then be seen and known ;
And they that know and see Him
Shall have Him for their own.
6 The morning shall awaken,
The shadows shall decay,
And each true-hearted servant
Shall shine as doth the day.
7 There God, our King and Portion,
In fullness of His grace,
Shall we behold for ever,
And worship face to face.
8 0 sweet and blessed country,
The home of God’s elect!
0 sweet and blessed country
That eager hearts expect!
9 Jesu, in mercy bring us
To that dear land of rest;
Who art, with God the Father
And Spirit, ever Blest, Amen.


[S.M.D.]
A FEW more years shall roll,
A few more seasons come,
And we shall be with those that rest
Asleep within the tomb :
Then, 0 my Lord, prepare
My soul for that great day;
0 wash me in Thy precious blood,
And take my sins away.
2 A few more suns shall set
O’er these dark hills of time,
And we shall be where suns are not,
A far serener clime ;
Then, 0 ray Lord, prepare
My soul for that bright day ;
0 wash me in Thy precious Blood,
And take my sins away.
3 A few more storms shall beat
On this wild rocky shore,
And we shall be where tempests cease,
And surges swell no more :
Then, 0 my Lord, prepare
My soul for that calm day ;
0 wash me in Thy precious Blood,
And take my sins away.


4 A few more struggles here,
A few more partings o’er,
A few more toils, a few more tears,
And we shall weep no more :
Then, 0 my Lord, prepare
My soul for that blest day ;
0 wash me in Thy precious Blood,
And take ray sins away.
5 ’Tis but a little while
And He shall come again,
Who died that we might live, Who lives
That we with Him may reign :
Then, 0 my Lord, prepare
My soul for that glad day;
0 wash me in Thy precious Blood,
And take my sins away. Amen.

DAYS and moments quickly flying
Blend the living with the dead ;

Will have sped their rapid flight:

Oh, that while we can we might!


Jesu, Infinite Kedeemer,

SOULS of men ! why will ye scatter
Like a crowd of frightened sheep ?
Foolish hearts ! why will ye wander
From a love so true and deep ?
Was there ever kindest shepherd
Half so gentle, half so sweet
As the Saviour Who would have us
Come and gather round His Feet ?
It is God : His love looks mighty,
But is mightier than it seems :
’Tis our Father ; and His fondness
GoevS far out beyond our dreams.


There’s a wideness in God’s mere),
Like the wideness of the sea :
There’s a kindness in His justice
Which is more than liberty.
There is no place where earth’s sorrows
Are more felt than up in Heaven ;
There is no place where earth’s failings
Have such kindly judgment given.
There is welcome for the sinner,
And more graces for the good ;
There is mercy with the Saviour ;
There is healing in His Blood.
There is Grace enough for thousands
Of new worlds as great as this ;
There is room for fresh creations
In that upper Home of bliss.
For the Love of God is broader
Than the measures of man’s mind :
And the Heart of the Eternal
Is most wonderfully kind.
•/
There is plentiful redemption
In the Blood that has been shed ;
There is joy for all the members,
In the sorrows of The Head.


10 Pining souls ! come nearer Jesus,
And, 0 come not doubting thus,
But with faith that trusts more bravely
His great tenderness for us.
11 If our love were but more simple,
We should take Him at His Word ;
And our lives would be all sunshine
In the sweetness of our Lord. Amen
[8.7.J
COURAGE, brother ! do not stumble,
Though thy path be dark as night;
There’s a star to guide the humble :
Trust in God, and do the right.
Let the road be rough and dreary,
And its end far out of sight,
Foot it bravely ; strong or weary,
Trust in God, and do the right.
2 Perish policy and cunning,
Perish all that fears the light!
Whether losing, whether winning,
Trust in God and do the right.
Trust no party, sect, or faction ;
Trust no leaders in the fight;
But in every word and action
Trust in God and do the right.
C. 2671, h


3 Trust no lovely forms of passion—
Fiends may look like angels bright;
Trust no custom, school, or fashion ;
Trust in God, and do the right.
Some will hate thee, some will love thee,
Some will flatter, some will slight;
Cease from man and look above thee :
Trust in God, and do the right.
4 Simple rule, and safest guiding,
Inward peace, and inward might,
Star upon our path abiding,—
Trust in God and do the right.
Courage, brother ! do not stumble,
Though thy path be dark as night;
There’s a star to guide the humble :
Trust in God, and do the right.
CONQUERING kings their titles take
From the foes they captive make :
Jesus, by a nobler deed,
From the thousands he hath freed,
2 Yes : none other name is given
Unto mortals under heaven,
Which can make the dead arise,
And exalt them to the skies.


3 That which Christ so hardly wrought,
That which He so dearly bought,
That salvation, brethren, say,
Shall we madly cast away ?
4 Rather gladly for that Name
Bear the cross, endure the shame ;
Joyfully for Him to die
Is not death but victory.
5 Jesu, Who dost condescend
To be called the sinner’s Friend,
Hear us, as to Thee we pray,
Glorying in Thy Name to-day.
6 Glory to the Father be,
Glory, Holy Son, to Thee,
Glory to the Holy Ghost,
From the Saints and Angel-host. Amen.
[P.M.]
HARK ! hark, my soul! Angelic songs are
swelling
0 er earth’s green fields, and ocean’s wave-beat
shore:


How sweet the truth those blessed strains are
telling
Of that new life when sin shall be no more.
Angels of Jesus, Angels of light,
Singing to welcome the pilgrims of the night!
Onward we go, for still we hear them singing,
“ Come, weary souls, for Jesus bids you come” :
And through the dark its echoes sweetly ring-
mg,
The music of the Gospel leads us home.
Angels of Jesus, Angels of light,
Singing to welcome the pilgrims of the night!
Far, far away, like bells at evening pealing,
The voice of Jesus sounds o’er land and sea,
And laden souls, by thousands meekly stealing,
Kind Shepherd, turn their weary steps to Thee,
Angels of Jesus, Angels of light,
Singing to welcome the pilgrims of the night!
Rest comes at length ; though life be long and
dreary,
The day must dawn, and darksome night be
past;
Faith’s journey ends in welcome to the weary,
And Heav’n, the heart’s true home, will come
at last.
Angels of Jesus, Angels of light,
Singing to welcome the pilgrims of the night!


Angels ! sing on, your faithful watches keeping,
Sing us sweet fragments of the songs above ;
Till morning’s joy shall end the night of weeping,
And life’s long shadows break in cloudless love,
Angels of Jesus, Angels of light,
Singing to welcome the pilgrims of the night.
Amen.
JERUSALEM the golden,
With milk and honey blest,
Beneath thy contemplation
Sink heart and voice opprest.
I know not, oh, I know not
What joys await us there,
What radiancy of glory,
What bliss beyond compare.
2 They stand, those halls of Sion,
All jubilant with song,
And bright with many an Angel,
And all the Martyr throng ;
The Prince is ever in them,
The daylight is serene,
The pastures of the blessed
Are deck’d in glorious sheen.
3 There is the throne of David ;
And there, from care released,
The shout of them that triumph,
The song of them that feast;


And they, who with their Leader
Have conquer’d in the fight,
For ever and for ever
Are clad in robes of white.
4 0 sweet and blessed country,
The home of God’s elect!
0 sweet and blessed country
That eager hearts expect!
Jesu, in mercy bring us
To that dear land of rest;
Who art, with God the Father
And Spirit, ever Blest. Amen.
[0.m.d.1
THE roseate hues of early dawn,
The brightness of the day,
The crimson of the sunset sky,
How fast they fade away !
Oh, for the pearly gates of Heav’n,
Oh, for toe golden floor,
Oh, for the Sun of righteousness
That setteth nevermore !
2 The highest hopes we cherish here,
How fast they tire and faint;
How many a spot defiles the robe
That wraps an earthly saint!


Oh, for a heart that never sins,
Oh, for a soul wash’d white,
Oh, for a voice to praise our King,
Nor weary day or night!
Here faith is ours, and heavenly hope,
And grace to lead us higher ;
But there are perfectness and peace,
Beyond our best desire.
Oh, by Thy love and anguish, Lord,
And by Thy life laid down,
Grant that we fall not from Thy grace,
Nor cast away our crown. Amen.
[8.6.5.6.6.6.6.6.]
0 PARADISE ! 0 Paradise !
Who doth not crave for rest ?
Who would not seek the happy land
Where they that loved are blest;
Where loyal hearts and true
Stand ever in the ligat,
All rapture through and through,
In God’s most holv sight ?
•/ o
0 Paradise ! 0 Paradise !
The world is growing old ;
Who would not be at rest and free
Where love is never cold ;


Where loyal hearts and true
Stand ever in the light,
All rapture through and through,
In God’s most holy sight ?
3 0 Paradise ! 0 Paradise !
’Tis weary waiting here,
I long to be where Jesus is,
To feel, to see Him near ;
Where loyal hearts and true
Stand ever in the light,
All rapture through and through,
In God’s most holy sight.
4 0 Paradise ! 0 Paradise !
I want to sin no more,
I want to be as pure on earth
As on thy spotless shore ;
Where loyal hearts and true
Stand ever in the light,
All rapture through and through,
In God’s most holy sight.
5 0 Paradise ! 0 Paradise !
I greatly long to see
The special place my dearest Lord
In love prepares for me ;
Where loyal hearts and true
Stand ever in the light,
All rapture through and through.
In God’s most holy sight.


6 Lord Jesu, King of Paradise,
0 keep me in Thy love,
And guide me to that happy land
Of perfect rest above ;
Where loyal hearts and true
Stand ever in the light,
All rapture through and through,
In God’s most holy sight. Amen
WE love the place, 0 God,
Wherein Thine honour dwells ;
The joy of Thine abode
All earthly joy excels.
2 It is the house of prayer,
Wherein Thy servants meet;
And Thou, 0 Lord, art there
Thy chosen flock to greet.
3 We love the sacred Font:
For there the Holy Dove
To pour is ever wont
His blessing from above.
4 We love Thine Altar, Lord ;
Oh, what on earth so dear ?
For there, in faith adored,
We find Thy Presence near.


5 We love the Word of life,
The word that tells of peace,
Of comfort in the strife,
And joys that never cease.
6 We love to sing below
For mercies freely given ;
But, oh, we long to know
The triumph-song of heaven
7 Lord Jesus, give us grace
On earth to love Thee more
In Heav’n to see Thy Face,
And with Thy saints adore. Amen.
[c.m.]
AS pants the hart for cooling streams
When heated in the chase,
So longs my soul, 0 God, for Thee,
And Thy refreshing grace.
2 For Thee my God, the living God,
My thirsty soul doth pine :
0 when shall I behold Thy Face,
Thou Majesty Divine ?
3 Why restless, why cast down, my soul ?
Hope still, and thou shalt sing
The praise of Him Who is thy God,
Thy health’s eternal Spring.


4 To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost
The God Whom we adore,
Be glory, as it was, is now,
And shall be evermore. Amen.
[S.M. ]
BLESS’D are the pure in heart,
For they shall see our God ;
The secret of the Lord is theirs.
Their soul is Christ’s abode.
The Lord, Who left the heavens
Our life and peace to bring,
To dwell in lowliness with men,
Their Pattern and their King ;
Still to the lowly soul
He doth himself impart,
And for His dwelling and His Throne
Chooseth the pure in heart.
Lord, we Thy Presence seek ;
May ours this blessing be ;
Give us a pure and lowly heart,
A temple meet for Thee. Amen.
[8.8.8.4>J
MY God, my Father, while I stray,
Far from my home, on life’s rough way,
0 teach me from my heart to say,
“ Thy will be done.”


Though dark my path, and sad my lot,
Let me be still and murmur not,
Or breathe the prayer divinely taught,
“ Thy Will be done.”
What though in lonely grief I sigh
For friends beloved no longer nigh,
Submissive would I still reply,
“ Thy Will be done.”
If Thou shouldst call me to resign
What most I prize, it ne’er was mine ;
I only yield Thee what is Thine ;
“ Thy Will be done.”
Let but my fainting heart be blest
With Thy sweet Spirit for its guest,
My God, to Thee I leave the rest;
“ Thy Will be done.”
Renew my will from day to day,
Blend it with Thine, and take away
All that now makes it hard to say,
“ Thy Will be done.” Amen.
[7.7. 7.3.]
CHRISTIAN ! seek not yet repose,”
Hear thy guardian Aaigel say ;
Thou art in the midst of foes;
“ Watch and pray.”


2 Principalities and powers,
Mustering their unseen array,
Wait for thy unguarded hours :
“ Watch and pray.”
3 Gird thy heavenly armour on,
Wear it ever night and day ;
Ambush’d lies the evil one ;
“ Watch and pray.”
4 Hear the victors who o’ercarne ;
Still thev mark each warrior’s wav ;
•/
All with one sweet voice exclaim,
“ Watch and pray.”
5 Hear, above all, hear thy Lord,
Him thou lovest to obey ;
Hide within thy heart His Word,
“ Watch and pray.”
6 Watch, as if on that alone
Hung the issue of the day ;
Pray, that help may be sent down :
“ Watch and pray.” Amen.
[s.M.]
FAR from my heavenly home,
Far from my Father’s breast,
Fainting I cry, “ Blest Spirit, come,
And speed me to my rest.”


2 My spirit homeward turns,
And fain would thither flee ;
My heart, 0 Sion, droops and yearns,
When I remember thee.
3 To thee, to thee I press,
A dark and toilsome road ;
When shall I pass the wilderness,
And reach the Saints’ abode ?
4 God of my life, be near ;
On Thee my hopes I cast;
0 guide me through the desert here,
And bring me home at last. Amen.
[8.7.]
PEAISE the Lord ! ye heav’ns, adore Him,
Praise Him, Angels, in the height;
Sun and moon, rejoice before Him,
Praise Him, all ye stars and light:
Praise the Lord ! for He hath spoken,
Worlds His mighty voice obey’d ;
Laws, which never shall be broken,
For their guidance He hath made.
2 Praise the Lord ! for He is glorious;
Never shall His promise fail;
God hath made His Saints victorious,
Sin and death shall not prevail.


Praise the God of our salvation;
Hosts on high, His power proclaim ;
Heav’n and earth, and all creation,
Laud and magnify His Name ! Amen.
PRAISE, my soul, the King of Heaven,
To His feet thy tribute bring;
Ransom’d, heal’d, restored, forgiven,
Evermore His praises sing ;
Alleluia ! Alleluia !
Praise the everlasting King.
Praise Him for His grace and favour
To our fathers in distress ;
Praise Him still the same as ever.
Slow to chide, and swift to bless;
Alleluia ! Alleluia !
Glorious in His faithfulness.
Father-like, He tends and spares us,
Well our feeble frame He knows;
In His hands He gently bears us,
Rescues us from all our foes;
Alleluia ! Alleluia !
Widely yet His mercy flows.


4 Angels in the height, adore Him ;
Ye behold Him face to face ;
Saints triumphant, bow before Him,
Gather’d in from every race ;
Alleluia ! Alleluia !
Praise with us the God of grace. Amen.
WHEN morning gilds the skies,
My heart awaking cries,
May Jesus Christ be praised :
Alike at work and prayer
To Jesus I repair ;
May Jesus Christ be praised.
2 My tongue shall never tire
Of chanting with the choir,
May Jesus Christ be praised :
This song of sacred joy,
It never seems to cloy,
May Jesus Christ be praised.
3 When sleep her balm denies,
My silent spirit sighs,
May Jesus Christ be praised :
When evil thoughts molest,
With this I shield my breast,
May Jesus Christ be praised.


4 Does sadness fill my mind ?
A solace here I find,
May Jesus Christ be praised ;
Or fades my earthly bliss ?
My comfort still is this,
May Jesus Christ be praised.
5 The night becomes as day,
When from the heart we say,
May Jesus Christ be praised :
The powers of darkness fear,
When this sweet chant they hear,
May Jesus Christ be praised.
6 In Heav’n’s eternal bliss
The lovliest strain is this,
May Jesus Christ be praised :
Let earth, and sea, and sky
From depth to height reply,
May Jesus Christ be praised.
7 Be this, while life is mine,
My canticle Divine,
May Jesus Christ be praised :
Be this the eternal song
Through ages all along,
May Jesus Christ be praised. Amen.


[7.6.]
Greenland’s icy mountains,
X From India’s coral strand,
Wnere Afric’s sunny fountains
Roll down their golden sand,
From many an ancient river,
From many a palmy plain,
They call us to deliver
Their land from error’s chain.
2 What though the spicy breezes
Blow soft o’er Ceylon’s isle,
Though every prospect pleases
And only man is vile,
In vain with lavish kindness
The gifts of God are strown.
The heathen in his blindness
Bows down to wood and stone.
3 Can we, whose souls are lighted
With wisdom from on high,
Can we to men benighted
The lamp of life deny ?
Salvation ! Oh, Salvation !
The joyful sound proclaim,
Till each remotest nation
Has learn’d Messiah’s name.


4 Waft, waft, ye winds, His story,
And you, ye waters, roll,
Till, like a sea of glory,
It spreads from pole to pole ;
Till o’er our ransom’d nature
The Lamb for sinners slain,
Redeemer, King, Creator,
In bliss returns to reign. Amen.
[c.M. 1
/H OD moves in a mysterious way
VJ His wonders to perform ;
He plants His footsteps in the sea,
And rides upon the storm.
2 Deep in unfathomable mines
Of never-failing skill
He treasures up His bright designs,
And works His sovereign Will.
3 Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take ;
The clouds ye so much dread
Are big with mercy, and shall break
In blessings on your head.
4 Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,
But trust Him for His grace ;
Behind a frowning providence
He hides a smiling face.


5 Blind unbelief is sure to err,
And scan his work in vain ;
God is His own interpreter,
And He will make it plain. Amen.

WE plough the fields, and scatter
The good seed on the land,
But it is fed and water’d
By God’s Almighty Hand ;
He sends the snow in winter,
The warmth to swell the grain,
The breezes, and the sunshine,
And soft refreshing rain.
All good gifts around us
Are sent from Heav’n above,
Then thank the Lord, 0 thank the Lord,
For all His love.
He only is the Maker
Of all things near and far ;
He paints the wayside flower,
He lights the evening star ;
The winds and waves obey Him,
By Him the birds are fed ;
Much more to us, His children,
He gives our daily bread.


All good gifts around us
Are sent from Heav’n above,
Then thank the Lord, 0 thank the Lord,
For all His love.
We thank Thee then, 0 Father.
For all things bright and good,
The seed-time and the harvest,
Our life, our health, our food ;
Accept the gifts we offer
For all Thy love imparts,
And, what Thou most desirest,
Our bumble, thankful hearts.
All good gifts around us
Are sent from Heav’n above,
Then thank the Lord, 0 thank the Lord,
For all His love. Amen.
LOVE Divine, all loves excelling,
Joy of Heav’n, to earth come down,
Fix in us Thy humble dwelling,
All Thy faithful mercies crown.
Jesu, Thou art all compassion,
Pure unbounded love Thou art;
Visit us with Thy salvation,
Enter every trembling heart.


3 Come, Almighty to deliver,
Let us all Thy grace receive ;
Suddenly return, and never,
Never more Thy temples leave.
4 Thee we would be always blessing,
Serve Thee as Thy Hosts above ;
Pray, and praise Thee, without ceasing,
Glory in Thy perfect love.
5 Finish then Thy new creation,
Pure and spotless let us be,
Let us see Thy great salvation
Perfectly restored in Thee.
6 Changed from glory into glory,
Till in Heav’n we take our place,
Till we cast our crowns before Thee,
Lost in wonder, love, and praise. Amen.
[P.K.]
rPHE Voice of God’s Creation found me
JL Perplex’d midst hope and fear,
For though His sunshine flash’d around me,
His storms at times drew near :
And I said—
Oh ! that I knew where He adideth !
For doubts beset our lot,
And lo ! His glorious face He hideth,
And men perceive it not!


The voice of God’s Protection told me
He loveth all He made ;
I seem’d to feel His arms enfold me,
And yet was half afraid :
And I said —■
Oh ! that I knew where I might find Him !
His eye would guide me right:
He leaveth countless tracks behind Him,
Yet passeth out of sight.
The Voice of Conscience sounded nearer,
It stirr'd my inmost breast;
But though its tones were firmer, clearer,
’Twas not the voice of rest:
And I said —
Oh ! that I knew if He forgiveth !
My soul is faint within,
Because in grievous fear it liveth
Of wages due to sir.
It was the Voice of Revelation
That met my utmost need ;
The wondrous message of salvation
Was joy and peace indeed :
And I said —
Oh ! how I love the sacred pages
From which such tidings flow,
As monarchs, patriarchs, poets, sages,
Have long’d in vain to know !


5 For now is life a lucid storv,
%/ '
And death a rest in Him,
And all is bathed in light and glory
That once was dark or dim :
And I said —
0 Thou Who dost my soul deliver,
And all its hopes uplift;
Give me a tongue to praise the giver,
A heart to prize the gift. Amen.
ETERNAL Father ! strong to save,
I Whose arm doth bind the restless wave
Who bidd’st the mighty ocean deep
Its own appointed limits keep :
Oh, hear us when we cry to Thee
For those in peril on the sea.
2 0 Saviour ! Whose almighty word
The winds and waves submissive heard,
Who walkedst on the foaming deep,
And calm amid its rage didst sleep :
Oh, hear us when we cry to Thee
For those in peril on the sea.
3 0 Sacred Spirit! Who didst brood
Upon the chaos dark and rude,
Who bad’st its angry tumult cease,
And gavest light and life and peace :
Oh, hear us wlmn we cry to Thee
For those in peril on the sea.


4 0 Trinity of love and power !
Our brethren shield in danger’s hour ;
From rock and tempest, fire and foe,
Protect them wheresoe’er they go ;
And ever let there rise to Thee
Glad hymns of praise from land and sea.
Amen.
