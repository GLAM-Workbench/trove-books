Unfrniiuttion
The writer is induced to give to the public some views on the
Land Question, ?his former effort,* in print, having met with
indications of approval from some who have done him the honor
to peruse it.
It is of the highest importance that, at this particular period
of our history, the subject relating to the Land Laws should be
very generally considered and understood.
Although a very humble promoter of the purpose this work
is designed to aid in effecting, the author begs to assure his
readers that he has a strong desire to see established a free and
liberal measure for the disposal of the ? waste lands? of this
colony; that greater encouragement and facilities may be
given for the more certainly profitable application of industry
and capital, and more powerful attraction offered to the free
immigrant and his family, possessing only a small amount of
means, as well for the especial reward of honest labour, which,
we are told, ? guided by education and the light of Christian
precepts and example, is to work out man?s political redemption*
complete liberty, and independence ?to improve his judgment,
his habits, tastes, and manners, and, at the same time, help to
remove him from those temptations which cause him to de-
generate ?which warp his reason, endanger his liberties, and
render him an easy prey to the vain, selfish, and avaricious
designs of others.

Published anonymously, under the signature of ? Nemo.?


As one of the public, the writer desires to acknowledge the
valuable efforts made by the Melbourne Press and its contri-
butors to expose the present land system, and to establish a
more just one; also, the efforts made by various individual
writers who have published books on the subject; and the
author desires to make particular reference to those members of
the Chamber of Commerce from whom emanated the plan pro-
posed and adopted, in the report of the proceedings of that
Chamber for the year ending March, 1855. He makes marked
reference to the suggestions made by those gentlemen, because, in
the first place, he believes they have not had sufficient publicity,
and being the recommendations of a body of men whose avoca-
tions and commercial experience qualify them to arrive at
conclusions more likely to be practicable and just, for few
possess that interest in land which would cause them to take a
selfish or prejudiced view; and, secondly, they appear to be the only
individuals who have, in number, made it their business to meet
together for the very purpose of applying themselves to the
consideration and discussion of the subject, calmly and carefully,
with the desire to serve the general good of the colony, and in
such a manner enabling them to propose some well digested
plan, having additional claim to public notice on account of its
similarity to those liberal measures, which experience has proved
to have resulted in so much good for the United States and
North America, attracting as they do increasing additions of
free immigrants and capital to those shores; obviating the
necessity of pauper institutions as in England, which, from
various causes, has added twenty thousand able-bodied men
during the past year to the lists for parish relief.
The author has thought fit to re-publish at the end of this
book the plan alluded to, proposed by a Committee of the
Chamber of Commerce, suggesting, as the report expressed it?
? The best means of promoting agriculture and the settlement
of the waste lands of the colony.? Not that the writer gives in
his adhesion to the whole of the scheme, exceptions to which are
taken and referred to.


A brief reference will bo made to the evils of the present
system for the disposal of the public lands?how it fosters
speculation and monopoly?fetters and obstructs labour, and
causes a waste of time, industry, and money. How it induces
a misapplication of industry and capital ?causes them to leave
the country ?staggers enterprise ?discourages free immigration,
and by assisting to the continuance of Government immigration,
which it is no longer desirable to uphold, excepting in respect
to females, greatly increases the price of the passage-money of
the free immigrant?is injurious in a political point of view to
the interests of free institutions and a representative system of
Government, and how the system tends surely to retard the pro-
gress of the colony, if not impoverish it.
An attempt will be made to point out the advantages likely
to arise by the adoption of a new plan. The benefits it will
give to the agriculturalist and cultivator of the soil. How it
will prevent his industry and capital going from him to the
advantage and profit of the landlord. How it will prevent the
necessity of applying his industry and capital on soil owned by
another, which, when by a bad season, or other reverse in
fortune occurs, causes the owner of the soil to reap the whole
and only advantages in the shape of improvements, &c., which
the money and industry of the agriculturalist tenant has
supplied.
Allusions will be made to the advantages which a new system
will give to the agriculturalist in enabling him to become the
proprietor of the land which is improved by his industry, and
thereby, any efforts or measures of enterprise he may adopt,
he will have additional stimulus and encouragement to pro-
secute, in consequence of securing to himself and family the full
benefit of them.
Some of the evil effects, disappointment, waste of time, &c.?
occasioned by the system of ? sales by auction? of Government,
land, will be pointed out. The advantages to be derived by a
? free selection of land? ?how it will tend to economize labour.


prevent disappointment, and waste of industry and capital, and
add immensely to the wealth of the colony. How monopoly
and misapplication of money and speculation will be prevented
by the ? conditions? proposed to be applied?such as cultivation
which must be complied with in order to secure to the culti-
vator of the soil a properity in it.
A short reference will be made to the operation of the Land
Question on Free Immigration on the principle of free trade.
An attempt will be made to show the connexion a proper settle-
ment of the Land Question has with the establishment of local
representative institutions to promote local government and
improvements, such as roads, bridges, reservoirs, fences, &c.,
under the direction of properly elected boards of management
or district courts. Also the influence a proper land system will
have in directly promoting and encouraging the formation of
railways by private enterprise ; by creating a local interest to
assist in subscribing the capital and creating public companies
for the purpose, A system of carrying forward these under-
takings which has proved to be the most expeditious, econo-
mical, and profitable. And the encouragement that will be
given for this purpose, for the investment of those large
deposits now lying in the banks bearing no interest?the pro-
perty of a resident proprietary, miners and others, not in trade
And how, under a proper finance scheme, this may be facilitated,
obviating the necessity for recourse to foreign loans, and securing
the expenditure and re-circulation in the colony of the profits
on these undertakings instead of handing vast sums of money
over to an absentee proprietary to be spent out of the colony.
The perusal of this book will suggest to the minds of many
of its readers other benefits and other advantages likely to arise
out of the establishment of a new land law. In like manner
many more and serious disadvantages coming within the know-
ledge of those who read this will occur to them as springing
from the present objectionable system for the disposal of the
lands.


The author desires to arrest the attention of all who wish to
see the people of this colony prosperous and happy, as he firmly
believes that upon the proper and just settlement of the land
question depends the welfare and progress of Victoria, and the
permanent enjoyment of the national, religious, and political
liberties of its people. Upon the just and equitable arrange-
ment of this question greatly depends whether this colony shall
possess and continue to hold in its entirety and fullest integrity,
a truly representative system of government untrammelled and
unfettered, and all the benefits and blessings derivable there-
from, or, on the contrary, whether this colony shall be con-
trolled and held by a monied oligarchy or landocracy, acting in
compact with some future government leagued against the
liberties of the people and the advancement of the colony,
instituting measures full of selfishness, monopoly, strife, calcu-
lated to set class against class, fruitful of animosities, causing
the rich to become richer and the poor poorer.
Not only is every one in this colony deeply interested that the
settlement of this question should give greater and increased
facilities to industry?but British hearths and British homes,
British manufactures and British shipping, and all British
interests are affected by this question, and are concerned that it
should be so adjusted as to provide a better home for the
thousands who are at present ekeing out a precarious and a
miserable existence here at this time, as well as in older
countries.
A measure is sought be instituted which will best carry out
the spirit of free trade, and give increased encouragement to
industry in all its branches, to free immigration, commerce, and
shipping interests?to English manufacturers and all peaceful
and useful enterprise, and help to smother those elements so
destructive of prosperity and progress, w r hich in the shape of
narrow-minded and grasping selfishness, and all its attendant
withering and blighting influences are too surely gaining a
footing amonst us.


In so short a work as the present it would be impossible to
do full justice to any one of the matters having a connexion
with the right settlement of this important subject, A cursory
glance only at some of the questions bearing upon it is
attempted. It is not pretended that any arguments herein
advanced are new or original. If the author takes credit for
any novelty it is for the suggestion to establish the issue of
Government notes upon a specie deposit, bearing interest, in
company with other measures tending to indicate a policy
desirable to be pursued for the government of the colony, and
believed to be acceptable and beneficial to the great body of the
people.


CHAPTER I.
THE CONNEXION WHICH A RIGHT SETTLEMENT OF THE LAND
QUESTION HAS WITH THE COMPLETE POLITICAL REPRESENTA-
TION OF THE PEOPLE CONSIDERED.
The present pernicious plan for the sale and disposal of the
waste lands, was the offspring of a non-representative and irres-
ponsible system of Government, which when spoken of in
reference to the wants of this colony was bad, because based on
a wrong principle ?not founded in truth and justice ; a system
by which the wishes of a majority of the people, those whose
interests were controlled by the said law, were neither fully
represented or considered.
How few of the colonists had any voice in the construction
of the land law. How few also had any voice in the making of
the New Constitution Act. Especial reference to this fact is
made,? in order to illustrate the argument, and to show the
danger of neglecting to organise a government upon a right
principle, when the opportunity of doing so is afforded : most
nearly approximating, as far as the present imperfect state of
humanity will admit, to a spirit of justice. And how fraught
with mischief to the interests, liberties, and peace of a commu-
nity are laws likely to be, flowing from an unsound system, as
instanced in the construction of the Houses of Legislature,
under the provisions of the said New Constitution Act, by
which the industry and learning necessary to fit a man for the
duties of a legislator, and to acquire a knowledge of the science
of government and politics, and to become conversant with the
examples which history affords, are altogether set at nought
and regarded as useless (as qualifications) in comparison with
the accidental, or otherwise, possession of land of a certain
value.


How few of the colonists had any voice in the construction of
the land laws, which like a great many other laws that have
come into existence, under similar circumstances (a wrong
system) have proved to be obstructive to industry, prosperity,
and progress, originating selfishness, and avarice, and strifes,
jealousies and discontent, setting class against class?prolific of
preferences and monopolies, alike injurious to the peace,
harmony, and goodwill of a community.
Hence the necessity for a truly representative system of
government, in its fullest integrity. And to enjoy the blessings
derivable from such a system, we see the immense importance
of every man taking a warm interest in the election of those
delegated to make laws. Hence the reason that he should not
be fettered in his choice by absurd and unjust restrictions, (such
as a property qualification imposes) ; and whilst invested with
the just and proper liberty of his birthright, which a right to
\ote gives him, how obvious it is that this great privilege and
responsibility should be exercised faithfully and honestly, with
regard alike to private and public duty.
And here we may remark, that the evils so often pointed out
by the enemies to representative systems of government, as
occurring in California, and the United States, are not so much
traceable to the system, as to the neglect of their public duties
on the part of a respectable and intelligent portion of the people
in those communities.
It has been said that good government consists in procuring
? the greatest happiness for the greatest number.?
Under a completely representative system of Government, it
is the majority of a community which governs and are respon-
sible for the laws and systems by which the interests of the
general community are controlled.
It cannot be said that the community and its interests are
completely or equitably represented, under the provisions of
our New Constitution Act. Therefore it is to be feared that
the parties elected under it will not, or cannot, carry out the


views and wishes of the majority of the community in reference
to the land question and all other interests. ?Justice and
fairness cannot be obtained from what does not spring from
those sources,? or is not constructed upon those prin-
ciples. It wants not a philosopher to show that the pro-
visions of the said ?Act,? and the arrangement of the
electoral districts under it, and the methods adopted for their
representation are not based_on just and equitable foundations,
or upon such a system of fair representation as to lead to the
expectation that a Government formed of its materials will work
harmoniously or successfully. And bearing in mind that one
of the principal objects which the Imperial Government had in
view in granting to this colony a New Constitution, was to give
the people the power and privilege of making a law to control
and deal with the waste lands of the colony, we see how
necessary it is that to secure an equitable adjustment of the
question a full and fair representation of the people should first
be established.
Amongst other anomalies we find the following to exist upon
which the fabrics of our Houses of Legislature are raised.
There are twelve districts, having 4,439 voters, which send
collectively 15 members to the Legislative Assembly ; or, so to
speak, every 246 voters in these 12 districts send 1 member to
Parliament.
On examining further we find?there are other 14 districts,
containing 30,185, sending 23 members to Parliament, that is
only one member for every 1,300 voters.
If comparison between the number of members' and the
population in each district were made, the difference would
appear still more remarkable and irreconcileable with a spirit of
fairness.
The leading interest in the latter named (14 districts) is the
digging interest.
The object intended by referring to these eccentricities is to
show that in some districts certain interests and branches of


industry are too largely and unfairly represented, as compared
with the other. And in those districts where the greater
number of labourers and industrious individuals are gathered,
the representation they have is disproportionate, unfair, and
insufficient. And as in seeking a proper adjustment of the land
question, it is of vital importance to the interest of labour and
industry, and therefore to the community at large that it
should be settled on just and sure foundations, calculated to
open up the avenues to industry, and increase the facilities for
its application, there is reason to draw the attention of the
public to whatever positive obstructions may exist, to prevent
a ? consummation so devoutly to be ?wished.?
We have said it does not require great sagacity to trace what
is likely to be the result of a system of government presenting
for its base the materials which possess elements so irrecon-
cilable with the word representative?in fact, so thoroughly
non-iepresentative, as those in the 12 and 14 districts
spoken of. The presence of these inconsistencies may be
likened to a piece of eccentric action in machinery, which
is more complicated and difficult to keep in working con-
dition and effective order than a piece of simple machinery
having a direct action, moving harmoniously, and from a proper
centre. And yet, we find those parties in existence who are
disposed to try the eccentric and difficult, and characterise the
efforts of those who wish to make the political machinery simple
and less complicated, and more nearly equitable and just, as
theoretical. It is to be feared that the theoretical will be too
surely illustrated in the fruitless attempt to make the new con-
stitution work before removing from it the existing absurdities,
incongruities, and elements of injustice. We may point to
what is passing at Sydney at the present time as an example of
what is likely to occur here. This book is not intended to treat
of or to be an essay upon the science of government. We
cannot expect a better government, or a better form of
government, than our intelligence and attention to public


duties warrant us to hope for. If we are by any reason not
deserving of the benefits derivable from good government and
good laws, it may be safely affirmed that we shall not enjoy
those benefits. Experience teaches, if indeed no better autho-
rity for the truth were in existence, that nations, like indi-
viduals, ? reap what they sow, and that ? grapes cannot be
gathered of thorns,? or ? figs of thistles.? The use of these
allegories are intended to point out the necessity there is for a
community, especially a community standing in the position
occupied by the present one at this time, to pay careful and
particular attention to the political matters just now being
brought into action to control its destinies. To take care, if
our institutions are to be representative, that they shall be so,
and that they shall not be a sham representation. The prin-
ciple introduced is that the majority are to govern ; let all,
then, be represented without fear or favor, and then shall we
correctly ascertain the opinions and wishes of the majority. If
they be avaricious and ? the worshippers of mammon,? or ? the
idolaters of the God of rosy wine,? the community will have to
submit to the consequences j but let it not suffer the danger
from the consequences by mere neglect, and from no other
cause of desert. Under the present Act the possession of
wealth, of broad acres, is the only qualification considered
worthy of notice as a passport to the responsibilities of a
legislator. Intelligence, enterprise, and every other endowment
of the mind, excepting the one gratified organ of ? acqusitive-
ness? have been considered too unimportant to deserve notice
by the framers of our new Constitution Act, to qualify a man
for the office of legislator. It does not want a philosopher to
trace the evils likely to be brought upon a nation by the
existence of anomalies of this kind. Instead of a representative
system of government, as we suppose ourselves to be about to
enjoy, there are elements which lead to the inference that it
may turn out the despotism of a monied oligarchy, or body of
privileged monopolists acting under the support of and in com-


bination and concert with a not over-scrupulous executive,
supported by a venal press, and an army of individuals within
the range of official patronage, all wrought upon by the tempta-
tion to hold place and power to grasp at pelf. These remarks
are not intended at all to apply to the present members of
government, but to a state of things likely to arise at some
future but not distant period, if the colonists neglect attention
to their public duties.
This diversion from the subject intended to be treated of?
this allusion to the Government?is only meant to indicate how
far proper legislation upon the Land Question, to as to give satis-
faction to the majority, hinges and depends upon the proper re-
presentation of the community at large; so as to secure, in
dealing with that question, the nice point to be aimed at,
which whilst it provides security for the savings from industry
i.e. capital and property?and removes all obstacles in the way
of the application .of labor, does not give preferences, induce-
ments to idle speculation, or foster and encourage avarice and
monopoly.
Any law which encourages the indulgence of avaricious pro-
pensities, is opposed to the welfare of a nation. It is main-
tained that the present mode of disposing of the Crown Lands
does this, and at the same time opposes the free application of
industry and capital. In making the recourse to labor simple
and easy, there is a very benevolent end in view ; encourage-
ment to industry and its pleasures is given, and the recourse to
vice and its evils lessened. By the passing of measures which
lead in this way to civilization and virtue, more is done for the
good of mankind, than all the doctrinal preaching can do, and
the duty and effect of promoting the former on the part of
our legislators, should not be compromised by any assistance
from the public purse of State-aid, for the promulgation of re-
ligious beliefs and creeds; although it is not in the least in-
tended to disparage here the efforts of those engaged for such
purposes.


This part of the subject bears on the question of Property
Qualification. Is the public so lost to what a daily experience
teaches us I ?is the undivided attention which a man must ap-
ply for a series of years, in order to hoard money, calculated to
imbue him with knowledge and benevolent views which it is
necessary he should possess, in order to legislate successfully for
a country 1 The public must recollect that there is no analogy
between the dispositions, in a general way, of people of property
here and people of property at home. In England it has des-
cended from father to son, and to acquire the possession of it
men are not so much subject to the temptation which causes
the best part of human nature to become spoilt and degene-
rate, and the despotic, the vain, or the tyrannical to be upper-
most.
Let us hear what has been said on the subject by one famous
English author : ?? Riches are certainly no proof of merit; nay,
they are often, if not most commonly, acquired by persons of
sordid minds and mean talents : nor do they give any intrinsic
worth to the possessor, but on the contrary tend to pervert his
understanding, and render his morals more depraved.?
To the credit of a great many in our new Houses of Legis-
lature, these remarks cannot be applied, for they are ready to seize
the first opportunity of ridding our Act of Constitution of all
absurdities, and do not believe that those accidentally enriched,
or enriched by usury, peculation, jobbery, and different species
of fraud and extortion, are more estimable than the most vir-
tuous and illustrious members of the community.


CHAPTER 11.
SOME OF THE EVILS OF THE PRESENT SYSTEM FOR THE DIS-
POSAL OF THE PUBLIC LANDS CONSIDERED, AND REMEDIES
PROPOSED,
To deal with the subject of the Land Laws aright, requires
that we should approach the consideration of it with calm and
unbiassed minds, and a singleness of purpose. All well-wishers
for the general welfare of the people of this colony, should dis-
pel prejudiced, narrow and selfish motives, whilst they pass un
der review the very many interests which are likely to be
affected by the settlement of the Land Question. There is no
aspect in which it can be viewed by a reflective mind, without
its suggesting very serious results, for weal or for woe, to the
people of this colony, as well as to British interests, and the in-
terests of a great section of the human race.
Let us enquire what has been the result of the system hither-
to adopted for the sale of the Waste Lands of the colony. And
first, let us ask what quantity of land has been ? alienated ?
from the Crown under the present system; how much of this
has been cultivated; how much remains idle, or held useless on
speculation. Next, let us enquire to what purposes the money
has been devoted which has been paid to purchase this land.
Let us ascertain whether a great part of it could not (for the
welfare of the colony) have been applied to a better use to a
purpose more likely to add to the stability and reproductive
wealth of the community : and probably if we can answer some
of these and other questions correctly, and draw proper conclu-
sions therefrom, we shall be led to a clearer means of ascertain-
ing, bearing in mind the altered circumstances of the colony, the
advantage or disadvantage of upholding the present system for


the disposal of the lands ; not losing sight of the fact that the
gold discovery has taken place since the present system was
established; not forgetting that the majority of the people of
this colony have been drawn here by the discovery of gold, and
that it is now an ascertained fact that the industry (in the
aggregate) so applied to find gold, is poorly rewarded ?is the
poorest and least remunerative pursuit to which the labour of a
nation can be turned, causing an immense waste both of labour
and capital; subjecting us to be the unconscious instruments
for enriching the people of other countries, rather than the
country in which we live. Not losing sight then of these cir-
cumstances, and the fact that a vast number of people at
present upon the gold fields, would, if opportunities offered,
gladly apply their industry and the capital they possess, to the
cultivation of the soil, and the production of those commodities
such as flour, cheese, butter, beer, wine, &c., which now are so
largely imported, and thus enable them to enjoy more of the
amenities of civilized life, and drag out a less precarious, less
anxious and uncertain existence. And here we are reminded
that there is a moral, and a social, as well as material aspect to
this question, which cannot be separated from it, whilst con-
sidering the well-being of families and homes, and a rising
generation, together with that of the community at large. Of
the land already sold, under the present system (without having
any reliable statistical data to refer to) it is supposed that not
more than l-30th part is cultivated f if that, the rest is held
unprofitable and useless; giving the purchasers no interest or
return for their money so invested.* Two mischievous conse-
quences have been the result of this; in the first place, one pro-
fitable use of the land so sold has been uselessly interfered with,
one source of wealth to the colony has been fruitlessly disturbed.
* The following extract is from the Argus, December 4th, an article which
has appeared since this book was written.?? From returns lately published, it ap-
pears that out of more than two millions of acres sold in this colony little more
than 100,000 were last year under cultivation! The quantity of land sold during
the last three years having been about 1,500,000 acres!?


The pastoral interest is here referred to. The second mis-
chievous result has been the extraction from industry and the
colony of the immense sums of money that have gone to pay
for this land so remaining uncultivated, which has been pur-
chased on speculation, and remaining useless, much of this
money has gone clean out of the colony to enrich foreign ship-
ping houses, and the parties acting under a Government Immi-
gration Board. The land is in the same state it was before the
money was supplied to pay for it; the money has gone to bring
out Government immigrants, who for the most part have found
their way to the gold-fields, and the free emigrant?s passage has
been increased by means of the competition so created, some say
to the extent of fifty per cent. The money required to assist
industry in the cultivation of the soil, has been abstracted from
the country; labor is driven to find the means of support and a
precarious existence at the gold-fields, and the inhabitants still
have to rely in a great degree upon other countries for their
edibles and drinkable commodities, which would not now be the
case had a different system for the disposal of the lands pre-
vailed. The sold but uncultivated land is for the most part of
the best description, some of it from its quality and richness,
others from being in the convenient vicinity of inhabited parts ;
yet for the most part the holders of it can neither sell it, nor
lease or let it, on terms at the same time profitable to them-
selves and those who take it. Few are able to buy because of
the price demanded, and because of the uncertain and unsettled
state of the land laws few will take leases because they wish
not to give the advantage of their industry and money to en-
hance the value of another?s property. Here then is a damaging
obstacle to the foundation and progress of a nation?s wealth
agriculture, and the establishment of a free and independent
yeomanry.
A great cry has been raised of ? Unlock the Lands,? and those
who used to make the most noise about it, now advocate a con-
tinuance of the present system. Does the present plan of


selling the lands tend to ? unlock? them 1 We have said that
29-30ths of the land sold under the present system is still un-
cultivated : for what purpose then has it been bought 1 If the
system under which it has been sold is a sound and good system,
would it not be advantageous to part with the remainder of the
unsold to any body of capitalists upon the same terms, and at
once create a grand body of land monopolists ?a landocracy?
and still close and lock up the lands from industry more firmly 1 ?
For we have only to refer to the report of the land sales, and
we shall find upon looking down the lists of purchasers, that at
every sale two or three, and sometimes fewer, buyers take the
majority of the lots, or the bulk of the land offered for sale.
Is it supposed that those parties buy to cultivate I ?does not
our knowledge of facts contradict that conclusion ? For what
purpose, then, do they buy 1 Is it not to monopolise?to raise
the price of land ?is it not to gratify a spirit of avarice ? And
the money so laid out, instead of being made use of to assist
industry in the cultivation of the land, goes to create a positive
obstacle and difficulty to the application of industry. Is this
not an evil?a great curse in a young country 1 The misdi-
rection and misapplication of industry?in any community such
a thing is immensely injurious?but in a young community, in
a small and infantine nation, how much more injurious, and
how soon the effects come to be seriously felt. The present
system, then, we see occasions monopoly, stimulates specula-
tion in land, makes no provision for its cultivation, tends to
abstract the money required to assist in doing so, fetters and
obstructs industry, gives no facilities for the promotion of local
improvements?such as roads, bridges, &c. ?and lessens the
chance of providing the means from which the taxes for the
support of the government of a country should spring?that is,
from property, accumulated wealth, the savings of industry.
In other new countries, where the condition and circumstances
of the population are something similar to those of the people
of this country, provisions are made to enforce tire cultivation


of the soil, to prevent monopoly and the wrong application of
capital; and land cannot be held useless to the prevention
of others from cultivating it. And in this colony a similar
rule is already applied to land in reference to one branch of
industry?that of mining for gold. If a digger takes a
? claim? and neglects to work it, he is not allowed to hold it
useless, and prevent another from working it ; in other words,
he cannot monopolise, he cannot hold to the detriment and
prevention of the application of another?s labor and enterprise.
Our digging population, then, have been already schooled and
educated by this means to a proper respect for the value and
claims of labor, and the justice of not permitting a spirit of
monopoly to obstruct it. The argument, that because a man
buys land and pays the government for it, he ought to be at
liberty to do as he pleases with it, and to hold it in a profitless
and uncultivated state if he please, is not a sound argument?
nor is it just; for besides the injury such a power if exercised
does to the community, it places the holder of the soil in a
preferable position to the rest of the community. For the fact
must not be lost sight of, that the gold digger, indirectly, pays a
much larger amount to the government for the land he makes
use of, than does the man who purchases at the upset price per
acre. The tax on the industry (i. e., the capital) of the gold
digger by payment of the export duty on gold and the license
fee is quite equivalent to the price paid for agricultural land ;
but the digger?s property in the soil ceases so soon as he fails to
make use of it.
This is necessary and useful. For it must not be forgotten,
that industry has its claims as well as its responsibilities ; and
any law which interferes to prevent, fetter, or obstruct in-
dustry, is bad?is suicidal to the interests of a nation : for no
wealth can be created without industry. The owners of capital
also, have their responsibilities, and their privileges must not
be exercised in such a way as to make the claims of industry
secondary to the security of capital. There is danger that the


latter will take place where there is an absence of benevolent
enterprise in the owners of capital, and where the responsi-
bility and privilege of making laws is confided entirely to such
a class of individuals. There is danger that the selfish
element will prevail to cause the introduction of impolitic laws,
calculated rather to foster and encourage avarice than to
promote industry and enterprise; and the importance and
value of industry will become a secondary consideration, and
made to subserve the interests of capital and avarice. If such
prevail, the elements of true conservatism are not cherished, a
country becomes impoverished, the peace and harmony of a
community are perilled, and the security and stability of pro-
perty, government, and institutions is lessened. Credit, faith,
and confidence are shaken ; a contempt and disaffection for the
laws is engendered ; jealousies of one class towards another are
exercised; and the reverse of good will and good feeling of man
towards his fellow man prevails.
Not least among the evils that have been created by the
present land system is the encouragement that has been given
to the land-jobber and speculator. Is it not true that in con-
sequence of the difficulty of obtaining land very many have
been driven to invest their money and industry in the erection
of buildings in townships and on country plots, and have
suffered utter ruin by building upon leasehold property bearing
enormous rentals, and that land-jobbers and speculators have
had an undue share of the wealth and industry of others to
enrich themselves ? Is it not true that large plots of land have
obtained a fictitious and artificial value because a system
prevailed which virtually closed the land to the possessor of
small means, and has either driven him to occupy leasehold
farms or leasehold building-plots, and made his industry the
slave of another?s purpose 1 Is it not true that unwholesome
trade competition in towns has arisen from the fact of the
expense and difficulty occasioned by the present land laws!
That much of what is consumed might have been produced in


the colony, and helped to enrich it if a freer system had pre-
vailed? Is it not true that many agriculturists have been
forced to expend their industry and capital on unproductive
soil, or soil that required no little outlay in manures, inconve-
niently situated, too, without easy access to a market, whilst,
at the same time, rich virgin soil remained idle, and much that
in many districts could be cultivated with least expense and
most piofit, lies untouched, either held by the land jobber or
the Government. Is it not true, that many a gold digger who,
with his mates, has saved, after a year or two?s hard toil, a
small amount of money, sufficient, under a different system
(with associated labour, similar to that applied on the diggings)
to work a farm, has been prevented doing so by the obstacles
thrown in his way ; that after selecting land suitable for the
purpose, and waiting with great loss of time and expense for an
auction sale, he has been there outbid by the land speculator,
and the land he sought to cultivate has remained useless ?
Again, have cases like this occurred :?An agriculturist with
his wife and family, recently arrived in the colony, having
perhaps �3OO, full of hope, vigor, and energy, travels over the
country in search of suitable land to settle upon. Having
found this, and making up his mind to the purchase, he makes
a request to the Survey Office that the land may be put up for
sale. This done, by some means his opinion of the land and
its value becomes known to the outside speculator, his judg-
ment and knowledge, unconsciously to himself, furnish cheap
information to his cost; and, after much toil and patience,
waiting, perhaps, months, he attends the land sale to see the
man with superior means step in and reap the advantage his
own knowledge, enterprise, and experience, should have entitled
him to. Thus, with impoverished means and disappointed
hopes, he is obliged to turn himself to gold-digging, a pursuit
in no way congenial to his tastes, his habits, or his finances,
and in every respect opposed to the interests of his wife
and children. What, then, has become of the energy, the
vigour, the knowledge, the industry, the bright hopes ?


What wonder, that disappointed, ruined, and betrayed, the
unhappy man seeks oblivion from his blasted hopes in the wine
cup ? What wonder that orphan asylums spring up around us
to shelter those who ought to be happy amongst the warm
affections of the domestic hearth, instead of being the pining,
blighted inmates of public institutions 1 Man ! come and see
what?
?Man can make of man.?
Is it not true that the expenses of labour and carriage, of the
first cost of fencing and clearing, of erecting suitable dwellings
for a family and the purposes of a farm, are such that farming
is wholy unprofitable at present, with the exception of very rich
and selected spots within a convenient distance to market, by
easy carriage roads 1
Is it not true that nine-tenths of those farmers holding farms
at a rental, are unable to pay their rent, and in consequence,
the profits of their industry in the shape of improvements to
the land, such as building, clearing and fencing, &c., are reaped
by the freeholder 1 A discouraging result, opposed to the pro-
verb of the wiseman ?? He that laboureth, laboureth for him-
self ; for his mouth craveth it of him.?
Refer again to more of the evils of the system of Sales by
Auction of Government Land. Shall we speak of the opportu-
nity it gives an auctioneer to favour a friend, or punish an
enemy. How by the spasmodic fall, or suspension of the
hammer this can be arranged. Shall we speak of the method
sometimes adopted to induce the biddings. How auctioneers
have held out the prospect of proposed intended improvements
to localities, in the shape of piers, bridges, roads, &c. Shall
we speak of the inconvenience of being obliged to attend a sale
at a set time, the many delays, objections and disappointments
this system occasions, that press particularly hard upon those
seeking to purchase country and agricultural lots, and the
necessity that such people should be able to go to a district
survey office, and procure what they want any day it suits


them, during office hours. The advantages of the establishment
of district offices for such a purpose are sufficiently obvious.
Another evil is manifest, arising from the present system*
which has not been noticed ; it is this?those who have pur-
chased land for the mere purpose of speculation, have a direct
temptation and interest in obstructing the establishment of
Local Boards to provide roads and other improvements, &c.
And we have instances before us which practically illustrate the
truth of this assertion. .A reference to what has been going on
in the district of Boorondara, with the object of preventing, in
that district, the formation of a Local Board. So we see that
the men of enterprise and industry who cultivate the land, and
by the proper application of whose capital, labour and ingenuity
a nation is supported, are, in their efforts to supply the means
for the construction of Roads, &c., upon which more expedi-
tiously and economically to convey their produce to a market?
stoutly opposed by parties holding land uncultivated, and for
mere speculative purposes. Is not this then another cause for
altering the mode of disposing of the soil ? Is it advisable to
encourage the purchase of land, without first instituting condi-
tions to oblige its cultivation when purchased ; either by laying
a tax on land uncultivated, or otherwise 1
The useless expenditure of the cost of surveying the land now
open for selection is another evil which the present system has
occasioned. Nor is this all; for by the very act of keeping this
land open for selection so uselessly, a feeling of distrust and
unnecessary fear of being about to be disloged by the Govern-
ment has been excited in the minds of the squatter; an
appearance of wishing to disturb and needlesly tamper with
his interest and holding has been shown; a mischievous inter-
ference tending to lessen the value of his interest and his feeling
of security, and to paralyse all efforts of enterprise. All this
has been done under the present system without bringing about
any corresponding advantage. In fact, a measure engendering
ill-feeling ;?full of ?make-believe,? ?but ?a delusion and a
snare.?


If it is a good principle to extract as much money as possible
from persons desirous of cultivating land ?before allowing them
the chance of doing so?then the present method of selling it
is well adapted to the purpose. The plan, however, has stimu-
lated injurious speculation ?has caused loss and ruin to many
hundreds, it fails to prevent monopoly ; has been very success-
ful in retarding agriculture, and prolonging the period during
which the colony is to be dependent upon other countries for
edible commodities.
Have people come out here, a distance of sixteen thousand
miles, left the amenities of civilized life, left many an anxious
aching heart in the fatherland, to become, what 1 The slaves of
the avarice and selfishness of others j and to help to uphold a
law which causes, or leads to this state of things. What man,
who under the establishment of a new land law of the nature
herein proposed, would be enabled to raise his humble home-
stead, bring out his wife, family, and female friends , what man
with the hope of such a climax would support the present
system which adds to his difficult, changing, and precarious
means of existence, and too often
Gives the uncertain portion he has won
With ruthless toil, and many a wretch undone
To those who mock him ?
This fact must not be lost sight of?that to the present
land laws is mainly attributable the misapplication and
misdirection of industry and capital which has caused excessive
useless importations, ruinous competition in trade, ruinous
building speculations, the unhealthy crowding of population in
towns, and the commercial panics, insolvencies which have been
experienced, energies, industry, and opportunities wasted,
demoralization and poverty generated, driving people from the
colony in disgust, sending the profits on industry, the profits on
accumulated deposits of the diggers, and a vast deal of money
in a variety of other ways out of the country to support absentee
proprietors, or to purchase edible commodities at a much more
expensive rate than that at which they could be produced here
from the soil.


CHAPTER 111.
WHO ARE THE PARTIES OPPOSED TO A CHANGE OF THE PRESENT
LAND LAW ? AND THE REASONS THEY URGE FOR A CONTINUANCE
OF THE SYSTEM CONSIDERED.
The greatest opposers to a change in the land laws are those
who have become purchasers under the present system ; but is
not their position akin to that of the dog in the manger 1 For
the most part, as far as agriculture is concerned, they can make
no use of the land themselves, they can neither occupy or
cultivate it, neither will they sell it to the agriculturalist upon
such terms as would make it advantageous to him to purchase )
but resort to artifice in order to induce others to waste their
energies, industry, and capital on their otherwise unprofitable
investments.
Let us inquire with what justice and reason the present
landowners oppose a change. Who are they 1 How came they
possessed of the means whereby they have purchased the land 1
Have they not, either as land jobbers, squatters, the conductors
of unduly protected trades, government contractors, or by some
of the monopolies or preferences which have existed in the
colony under irresponsible government, become accidentally
possessed of an undue share of the profits of others industry.
Are they not a class for the most part who have possessed a
superior share of the advantages to be derived from the soil, the
trade, and the industry of the colony 1 Though should their
savings be from superior industry, ingenuity, intellect, or virtue,
no man could carp at the success attending them. But we ask
what they have done as a body to induce the rest of humanity,
more particularly the industrial classes, to uphold their interests
by maintaining the present land laws to the manifest injury of


their fellow colonista and to the detriment of British interests
and British commerce.
The reasons they urge to uphold the present system are
akin to those made use of by the opposers to the repeal of the
corn laws in England. A small minority (no doubt) were
seriously injured by the change in that law \ the writer amongst
that number ; but there is a rule which must be observed in
such cases. The interests of the few must give way where the
welfare of the many requires it. The squatting interest has
been obliged to succomb to this rule. It may be asked,
touching on this point, why impose in a new country conditions
upon the agriculturist which have not been imposed upon the
squatter ? What is the secret of the squatters? success ] Has
it not been partly owing to the easy access to the land and the
opportunity of exercising free selection 1 Had half of the
difficulties been imposed upon the squatter which now stand in
the way of the agriculturist, his industry and enterprise must
have been thrown away. Has the agriculturist the opportunity
of selecting 640 acres of the richest land of a ? run ? at a price
which protects him from the competition of others 1 We do
not wish to see the squatter deprived of this privilege, on the
contrary would give him such a holding of his ? run, and of
such a nature, as would induce him to employ more labor,
invest more capital, and make greater endeavors to improve his
holding, always with this proviso, that it is done in such a way
that he shall pay a fair and equitable value for his privileges,
and not be placed in a favored or invidious position in reference
to the rest of the community; a position which no right
minded man of independent feeling desires to have; also
always with this proviso that he bear his fair share of the
burdens of the country in proportion to the privilege he enjoys,
and that the terms upon which he shall be suffered to occupy
for pastoral purposes shall not present difficulties to the land
being occupied for agricultural or other purposes.
We have said, that the objections urged to an alteration and


improvement in the land laws by those who possess uncultivated
land, are similar or at least are prompted by similar fears to
those entertained by the objectors to a repeal of the corn laws
in England. The writer recollects a friend of his, an agri-
culturist, asserting that he would not hold the land he cultivated
if given him rent free, to be obliged to continue the cultivation,
in case of a free trade in corn being established : the said farmer
has however continued to cultivate and occupy the very farm
ever since with as much if not more profit than he realized
before the repeal of the corn laws.
Those who have purchased land under the present land laws
assert that it would be unjust to them and injure the value of
their investments if a change in the law and a freer and more
generous law was established. If there was really any truth or
ground for their fears, it would not he a sufficient argument to
prevent a change, whilst it can be shown, that the interests of
the majority of the community are injured by maintaining the
present system. But they, like most people who are ruled in
their judgment by the narrowing influences on the mind of
mere selfish considerations do not see far enough ? a-field ?to
enable them to arrive at the more probable result which the
change sought to be established would occasion to their
interests. They do not see that under the new order of things
free immigration would receive an immense stimulus?that
instead of capital now remaining idle or leaving the country
encouragement for the employment of it hero would be given,
gi eater confidence and faith would be created, that with a
strong and good Government established under responsible
institutions and the fullest representation of the people ?not only
would people of an intelligent and respectable class flow here in
great numbers bringing capital with them, but those who are
here at present, but are discouraged, disgusted, and disheartened,
and only waiting the opportunity to get away?would an im-
proved condition in prospect under the new measures sought
to be introduced, immediately alter their intentions, and with


new views and feelings have a warm and powerful interest
excited to induce them to rally around the institutions of the
country and encourage their friends ?at home in England or
elsewhere to come out here and join them, and as fast as the
soil under the new regulations came to be taken up or
cultivated, and the pastoral runs were occupied, an additional
value would be given to the holdings of the present owners of
purchased land as being required for grazing purposes besides
the superior value it may already possess from most of it being
in the more immediate proximity to the sea board towns and
inhabited parts.
And we would ask are the three hundred thousand souls
(300,000) who have come to this country since the discovery of
the gold fields?for the most part free emigrants?are they to
be shut out from the advantages to be derived from the soil,
the enjoyment of which for merely a nominal consideration has
enabled those who have occupied it to become so rich, and
supplied them with the means (cheap labor included under a
system of Government emigration) of paying for the land which
has been purchased by them from the Government.
The land thus purchased for the most part is held by those
who have acquired the means by the enjoyment of the privileges
referred to and the small consideration they have paid for it has
directly gone to serve their purpose by bringing out cheap labor
for their use under the regulations of a Government immi-
gration board.
Under these circumstances then, and seeing the advantages
which the present owners of land have for the most part
enjoyed to enable them to become possessed of what they are?
shall that great number of free immigrants who have arrived
out here so recently, whose capital and industry have gone to
enrich so much more the holders of these advantages. We ask
shall they quietly submit to forego the enjoyment of some of the
benefits sought to be secured for the farmer and cultivator of
the soil?which has been so long and so liberally permitted to
the squatter and occupiers of pastoral runs ?


It will be quite in place if we consider here how the changes
proposed will affect the interests of the present agriculturists.
It is only fair to them that the positions they hold and the
effect the change in the land law proposed is likely to have upon
their interests should be considered. One effect of the change
will be to bring into existence a system of cultivation by
partnership and associated labor, similar to what is customary
upon the diggings. Industry applied in this way is most
effective and most valuable and can compete with anything. A
very great stimulus would be given to immigation, and as a
sequence greatly increase demand for farm produce ; at least it
is fair to judge that for many years the supply will not more
than keep pace with the demand. The law of demand and
supply, as in the case with all other productions would however
regulate the application of industry and capital to agricultural
pursuits.
For those who are at present cultivating at very great risk and
expense, cither on account of the poverty of the land or its
inconvenient position to a market, it will be better for them to
forego and vacate such present holdings, and use their knowledge
in selecting more likely spots. Thus the present farmer would
not be put at disadvantage with the new comer. He, with the
rest would have a fair chance of making the most of his
industry and capital, and of applying both to the best ad-
vantage.
Some few might at first be losers, but by far the greater
majority would be the gainers, and the necessity would be
obviated thereby of disturbing the principle of free trade, which
we hazard the opinion cannot be retained without impoverishing
this colony unless agriculture and industry receive the
encouragement and advantages to be secured by the new scheme
proposed for the disposal of the land.
If it be admitted that losses may be sustained by some of
those who, under the mischievous influence of the present
system for the sale of land, have been tempted to purchase for


mere speculative motives ; and the argument is used that in
consideration for those an alteration should not be made, at the
same time the fact is overlooked that the injury (perhaps ima-
ginary only) likely to occur in the one case is far outweighed by
the immense injustice and mischief done to the whole body of
the community by the continuance of the present system.
Further, if arguments against alterations and reformations?
of the kind just alluded to are suffered to prevail?no progress
or improvement of any kind could take place. Such reasoning
partakes of the character of the old narrow-minded spirit of
obstructiveness similar to what has always existed and been
exerted to prevent reformation and progress. The spirit was
present when in England ? Trusts? for the formation of turn-
pike roads were introduced. When Canals were first thought
of, the mean spirit was there to oppose; and when railways
were first introduced they, in their turn, had to bear the com-
bined opposition of those who were interested in maintaining
the ancient modes of conveyance.
No improvement is ever introduced without at first appearing
to, or actually causing, some loss to a section of the com-
munity ; but experience proves the anticipations of evil from
changes are ofttimes exaggerated or imaginary. It is this
ever-present spirit of mutability in human affairs, this desire
for change and improvement, which is, after all, the truly
conservative element, and helps to put mankind ? on their
metal,? and to keep alive and in healthful exercise all those
faculties of the mind and body which it has pleased the
Almighty to endow us with. Better to encourage industry and
enterprise, and free people from the temptation of idle habits
and vice by allowing the land to be taken up and cultivated?
free-gratis ?than to continue the present system ; for, after the
soil is cultivated, those who thus apply their industry are in a
position to contibute to the general revenue ?they are kept out
of temptation, their industry is not wasted, and the country is
enriched and not impoverished.


Here, we are blessed by Providence with the possession of a
fine soil and country, capable of supplying all our wants, and
supporting many millions- of people ; of supplying in the shape
of fruits, vegetables, preserves, poultry, &c., &c., a variety and
description of edible and drinkable commodities, and of a
character and quality far more conducive to health and pro-
longation of life?because fresh and produced from the soil and
climate in which we live ?and far preferable to the inferior
imported commodities which we are obliged to exist upon in
consequence of the present land law. Yet, in the midst of
nature s bountiful gifts, true to his selfish character, man insti-
tutes all kinds of impediments to prevent the full advantage
and happiness derivable from these opportunities being taken.
As a conciliatory measure, and in fairness to those who have
purchased land under the present system, the ? conditions?
proposed to be applied by the new law, which will compel the
purchaser of land to cultivate in order to permit him to hold
and occupy, ought not to be made to apply to those parties
holding land purchased under the present system, or, at least,
for Some years to come.
It may be advisable, also, in addition to the fixed price to be
paid for the land by the new law proposed, which is the method
of payment advocated in this book, that there shall be imposed
a small annual tax or rent of, say sixpence per acre. And, as a
conciliatory measure, this tax might not be made to apply to
land already ? alienated? from the crown under the present
system for the sale of government lands, for at least some years
to come?say ten years.


CHAPTER IV.
SOME OF THE LEADING PROVISIONS TO FORM PART OF A PROPOSED
NEW LAND LAW CONSIDERED.
The abolition of the plan of ? sales by auction ? and the
adoption of one giving ? power to select? are two of the leading
measures proposed to form part of a new land law.
The opportunity to ? select land ? at a ? fixed price ? and on
settled, understood, and definite terms and conditions ?similar
to the plan followed by the Americans?secures the immense
advantage of bringing the most suitable land into cultivation
first, without permitting or creating monopolies or preferences,
every man is served in his turn upon the principle of ? First
come, first served,? a plan extending to the agriculturist some
of the privileges and benefits which has caused the squatter so
much to flourish and thrive.
Next we come to the price to be paid for the land, which
should be a ? fixed ? one and determined only by the amount of
money necessary to defray the expense of surveying and perhaps
for constructing main lines of roads, and the requirements of
Government for the support of survey offices. If practicable*
the price should not exceed five shillings per acre. Let the
localities bear the expense necessary for making the local roads,
ways, bridges, &c. Better that local boards or district courts
properly elected should do this as they would best know their
own wants, and supply them in the cheapest and most ex-
peditious manner. Better that they should find the
additional money by contributing to local rates necessary to
enable them to make the roads and other local improvements as
fast as their means will admit of and their necessities require.


This, too, is carrying out the spirit of representative institutions
and binds communities together in one common interest.
Next, the conditions, or provisions, to prevent monopoly and
land being taken up on speculation, without its being culti-
vated. To make cultivation the necessary condition of being
able to hold and to possess a legal claim or title is sufficient to
put a stop to idle speculations in the cultivation of the soil by
those without the means necessary for cultivation, and is also a
preventative to industry being wasted and turned from its proper
channel. The condition is sufficient also for the security of both
capital and industry, and gives to judgment and experience
the advantages due to them in the selection of suitable spots.
The establishment of district survey offices under the surveil-
lance and control of proper elected local boards, is part of the
plan proposed. The whole under the supervision of one Go-
vernment board or head department; the members of such
board being properly elected by the Legislative Assembly.
In speaking of what ought to be the upset price of land,
many will say, ? surely if the land is not worth 20s. per acre, it
is worth nothing.? Some again make use of the argument, that
the land is easily cleared, and not heavily timbered, and that
this must enhance its value. But most of the reasons given for
fixing the value of the waste lands are fallacious and unsound.
There are several reasons why the land is of less value here,
and should be disposed of on easier terms than it is in the Cana-
das and the United States.
In the first place, the expense of coming to it is much greater,
it costs considerably more for a man to bring his wife and
family from Europe to this Colony, than he would have to pay
if he proceeded to North America. In the next place, after
arriving here, from the absence of navigable rivers, lakes, &c.,
the expense of taking a family, along with the necessary require-
ments of a home, and agricultural implements, &c., up the
country make the cost of settling much greater than in other
countries.


Then, again, there is an absence of Rivers, Navigable streams,
roads, and bridges for the economical conveyance of produce to
market. Then there is the increased price for labor as com-
pared with what is the case in other new countries. The
timber for the most part is useless, excepting as firewood,
whereas in other countries it can be floated down streams and
sold for building and other purposes, and will in some degree
pay the cost of clearing the land.
Then there is the cost of supplying the local appliances, such
as fences, reservoirs for water, for domestic and farm purposes.
In fact, if all the drawbacks to the value of the land?
climate, hot winds, &c., are set against the advantages, the
former will far outweigh the latter, and present sufficient
reasons for making the cost of surveying, <fec., the basis for
establishing an upset price.
Moreover, if the land is worth twenty shillings per acre, that
price should be made the basis for the rent charge to be paid
by the Squatter for his holding, and taking ten years? purchase
to be the value of a freehold in the colony, his rent should be
two shillings per acre, per annum.
The real value of land can only be estimated by what it can
be made to produce by the proper application of industry and
capital. The very system hitherto adopted here of assisted
immigration to bring labor to the land, confutes the argument
that the land is worth the present upset price, for we find that
the price paid has not been solely for the land, inasmuch as a
great portion of the money has been applied to pay for the
expense of bringing labor to the land, so that the real case
stands thus ?if (say for the sake of argument) one-third of the
fund from the sale of land has been applied to assist immi-
gration, then for every fourteen shillings spent in the purchase of
land, seven shillings has been spent to bring labour to it, to make
it worth the fourteen shillings. The present value placed on land
is artificial, occasioned by the present plan of selling it, when a
majority of the inhabitants are agreed as to what the price


shall be then the value will be conventional. It can hardly be
expected that a majority of an intelligent community will be
found willing, so to speak, to ?tie their own hands? and
consent to create such difficulties to the application of industry
on the soil as shall cause its own impoverishment, but should a
majority be found foolish enough to do this, the effect would be
to cause the dissatisfied minority to seek shelter in a neighbour-
ing colony.
There are some who urge that a great price for the land
should be maintained, in order to meet the requirements of the
State and the Civil List. They are poor political economists
who reason this way. First, it should be shown that the
expenses of the State and Civil List are necessary ; and then a
plan of supporting them should not be applied which cripples
and fetters industry, and prevents the production of wealth
necessary to meet the expenses required for the support of the
State and Civil List.
In reference to the plan alluded to, put forth by the com-
mittee of the Chamber of Commerce, ? for the disposal and
settlement of Crown lands,? the writer takes exception to the
method of payment for the land by instalments. Deferred
payments it is thought will be found to be impolitic and
injurious ; likely to incur future differences between settlers and
the Government, and stimulate injuriously a present rush on
the land of parties not having sufficient means to continue to
cultivate, and thereby cause them to jeopardize theirmoneyand
labour ; for unless they continued to cultivate under the pro-
visions of the plan proposed, they would not be permitted to
hold and keep out another who could cultivate, but the land
could be resold by the Government.
The writer also takes exception to that part of the ? plan ?
which suggests that ? the pettier shall be entitled to all minerals
on or under the surface.?
It is not desirable to grant this, or if so, conditionally,
viz. :?That in case land in private occupation shall be


ascertained to contain gold and silver, and a petition signed by-
say a majority of the adult male population of the district, with
the signatures duly attested by two magistrates, setting forth
the desire of the inhabitants of such district that such land in
private occupation containing precious metals should be re-
possessed by the Government for mining purposes. Then a jury
should be called to assess the value of the land and the im-
provements thereon, and upon the payment to the occupant of
the same, the Government shall have the power to re-possess
itself for the benefit of the general community for mining
purposes.
The interests and welfare of every one in the colony require
that agriculture should prosper and flourish. This is necessary
to the encouragement of free emigration, of British industry,
manufactures, commerce, and shipping. Agriculture cannot
prosper sufficiently under the present system of controlling the
sale of the waste lands of the colony. ISTor is it agriculture
alone that is impeded; but horticulture, the culture of the vine,
and the thousands of industrial pursuits and employments for
capital which are called into existence by the free progress of
that branch of industry. The necessity, then, for a speedy and
complete change is shown, and if all concede the im-
portance of its requirements let them do what they can to
promote it.
?For sure it is of vanities most vain
To toil for what we here most certain may obtain.?
Under the regulations of the proposed new land law, the land
would be taken up as fast as required for agricultural and other
purposes ?those parts best adapted first, in a similar manner to
that which led to the gradual occupation of the country for
pastoral runs and squatting purposes. This plan, besides
instituting a steady system of settling and occupying the
country, and of soon rendering the colony independent of other
countries for all edible and most drinkable commodities, also
presents this advantage, it will not needlessly and vexatiously


unsettle or displace the squatter or his interest. His ? runs ?
would only be broken in upon as fast as the gradual increase in
population took place and the necessities of the country and
agriculture required, which branch of industry must take the
lead and be considered of higher importance than grazing and
cattle ? runs,? as offering superior opportunities of employing
and sustaining greater numbers of people, and by the appliances
and machinery required for it?bringing into exercise those
higher faculties of the mind?the ingenious and inventive ?
necessary to prevent man from degenerating.
Reflection points to this, that as society is at present con-
stituted in this colony and its necessities require, the cultivation
of the soil in a moral, social, monetary, and every other aspect,
has at this time greater claims on our consideration than any
other interest, and whilst doing full justice to this question, with
proper care no other branch of industry or interest need be
made to suffer or be injured.
The plan, then, of ? free selection ? controlled by the
conditions to be complied with of cultivating, &c., secures the
safe investment of money, prevents a waste of labour and
economises and makes the most of it, prevents idle speculalion
and monopoly, gives an immense impetus to a variety of
industrial pursuits, to free immigration; is not only a saving
but a great source of wealth in many ways, besides keeping
capital in the country and encouraging the return of much
money here along with a constant and increased stream of free
immigrants; assisting to secure the realization of the scriptural
prophecy of the ? turning of swords into plough shares, and
spears into pruning hooks,? making the ? wilderness to blossom
as the rose,? instead of ? the thorn,? giving the fig tree, and in
place of ? the bramble the myrtle,? permitting every man to
? sit under his own vine and his own fig tree, none daring to
make him afraid,? causing the certain blessings of peace and
plenty to flow in upon us.
The effect of a land system, in connection with other mea-


sures of the nature advocated in this work, will be best illustra-
ted by comparing the case of a person just arrived in this
colony, and seeking land to settle upon, under the advantages
of the system herein proposed, with the case of a person seeking
also to do so under the present system. The smaller amount
of money required in the former case ?the great saving of time,
and therefore expense, by the facilities of going to a district
survey office, and at once paying for and securing as much land
as he would require ; after having made up his mind in which
locality he would prefer settling. And the absence altogether
of irritating obstacles which are presented in the latter case
make the advantages to be secured by the former supposed
case sufficiently obvious.
Let it be admitted that any man, having a wife and family,
and possessed of, from �2OO to �SOO, and some knowledge of
agriculture, and a willingness and ability to apply as much
labour as are necessary for the pursuit of gold digging, ought,
by the proper application of that industry and capital, by part-
nership, and associated labour, or otherwise to a position to
cultivate so much land as shall enable him to support himself
and family comfortably. A free emigrant, or any other person,
possessing the amount of means, &c., spoken of, certainly should,
in a new country, be able to do this, and more. It is not
assumed that every agriculturalist is to be what is termed a
? gentleman farmer,? as in England. In the matter of fencing
in land, it is not supposed that the present method, and useless
expenditure should be adhered to; for under proper local regu-
lations, fifty and more farms might be included in one fence?
the real object of fencing is to keep out cattle. In England
those who use the common lands are responsible for keeping the
cattle off the cultivated land. Supposing the principle to apply
here also, they would have a direct interest in contributing to
local rates for the supply of fencing, which would, under such a
system, be much more economically arranged, where desired,


at the same time not prevent any person from fencing, at his
own cost, the whole of his fields, if he pleases.
If a man?s means are lessened and exhausted by an exorbitant
price to be first paid for the land he desires to cultivate how is he
to commence to apply his industry ? Is it better that a man
should be crippled in his means in order that a Government
may hold funds to hand over for local improvements, roads, &c.,
at some future indefinite date, or perhaps not at all; or is it
better that a man should get upon the land to cultivate and
improve it, for the smallest sum practicable, and have the bene-
fit of the use of the money which otherwise would have been
paid to the government? That he should have the use of
nearly all his money for the first year or two, during which his
greatest difficulties and greatest expenses occur is best. Under
this system is he not able to commence with smaller means;
and will he not the sooner be able to contribute liberally to
local rates for the supply of roads and improvements required ;
and will he not be able the sooner to pay taxes and contribute
to the general revenue, for education and other purposes, if
required ? Is it not better that the money to be contributed
to the general Government for the purpose of main lines of
road, &c., should rather follow his occupation and cultivation of
the soil than precede it ? By this method does he not gain a
greater chance to cultivate successfully ; and is not the country
the sooner made rich ? And does it not give him a direct
interest to subscribe, if he be able, to the capital necessary for
promoting a railway passing the neighbourhood of his farm 1
Some, who by various good fortune, from one cause or another,
or by the favoured use of the lands, and privileges enjoyed
under the squatting system, and pre-emptive right to pick and
purchase, have (to use a humble phrase) succeeded in ? feather-
ing their nests,? may not see so keenly the necessity and
desirability of instituting a system for the encouragement of
free immigrants, as herein advocated ; but those who have not
yet met with that amount of success, and those who have not


yet enjoyed any of the immunities and privileges by which the
others have succeeded in ? making matters so comfortable??see
the necessity for a change, and demand to have some encourage-
ment to make themselves a home in this colony. They may
look in vain for the privileges and advantages to an extent
which those who have occupied the length and breadth of the
land have enjoyed, particularly since the discovery of gold ;
but they have a right to expect greater facilities for the appli-
cation of their industry upon the waste lands of the colony, and
to urge the establishment of a system which encourages and
assists to the use of the land ; but will not suffer, so to speak,
the abuse of it.
The struggle of the people of Canada to obtain a favorable
settlement of the land question in that colony was so strongly
opposed that the peace of the colony was well nigh disturbed,
before the monopolist party would yield, and then a very great
mischief had been consented to, by the permission given to a
company in England to buy up three million acres ! at a price
something under two shillings and sixpence per acre. The evil
of allowing the purchase of land for mere speculative purposes
has been well illustrated in this instance.
And here it may be remarked, that in all the great British
colonies the government has succeeded in establishing or per-
mitting some great mistake in reference to land in the shape of
creating a grand monopoly. In Canada, New Zealand, New
South Wales, South Australia, and in this colony, in all of
which cases the effect is either directly or indirectly to enrich
an absentee proprietary residing in England at the expense of
the colonists.
In Canada, the company resell the land at from ten shillings
per acre upwards, and allow the purchase money to be paid by
yearly instalments, extending over ten years. The money for
this purpose leaves the colony as the payment goes to an
absentee proprietary, so that for many years this extensive


district will suffer a drain of the circulating medium and exist
under a system of indirect bondage or serfdom.
This system of credit also encouraged many to purchase land
without having the means to continue to cultivate, and helped
to attract them from pursuits in which, perhaps, the reward for
their industry would be more certain. At the same time the
interest of the company is well secured, for if the instalments
are not paid up, the land again reverts to the company, and it
receives the sole advantages of whatever improvements have
been made. If this land had been disposed of under the
system advocated by this work, none of the evils complained of
would have arisen, and the money which now leaves those
districts to its impoverishment, to pay up the yearly instal-
ments, might have been applied, under the control of district
courts (the members of which elected by the residents), to
provide local improvements, such as roads, &c., and give em-
ployment to the inhabitants in those periods of the year when
labour is not so much required on the farms?a system causing
the profits to recirculate in the neighbourhood for its own
improvement.
How to deal with the Squatting Question, how to deal
with the ? runs ? now solely occupied for pastoral purposes, is
a subject which may be expected to be spoken of in this book.
The late Report issued by the Commission appointed to inquire
into the subject of Squatters? Rights, and the famous despatch of
the Duke of Newcastle, have for ever settled and answered in
the negative, the claims set up by the Squatters for Leases and
for Compensation.
It has been said that occupation of the land for pastoral
purposes should not be permitted to hinder in the least degree
the occupation of the land for purposes of cultivation. This is
admitted on all hands. And whilst a fair value should be paid
by the Squatter for the privileges he enjoys (and in estimating
this the increased value given to stock in consequence of the


discovery of gold should be borne in mind) * at the same time
it is proper that the pastoral interest should not be foolishly
and needlessly disturbed whilst anything like a monopoly or
preference should be removed.
A plan something similar to that now in practice in South
Australia; but modified and improved would meet the case.
The plan of dividing the counties into ? hundreds ; ? and
as soon as any land is sold the hundred is ?pro-
claimed ; ? and every person residing in such ? proclaimed ?
district is permitted to turn out cattle, or sheep, �feo., to graze
or depasture upon the uncultivated land upon payment of so
much per head as commonage fees. And as soon as there is a
sufficient number of resident proprietors of cultivated land
every ? hundred ? so ?proclaimed? is in a position to come
under the control of a properly elected district court or board of
management elected by the inhabitants to collect and disburse
local rates, and manage local improvements, roads, bridges, &c.,
and to collect commonage fees.
Under a system similar to this, the control of the-waste lands
for pastoral purposes would gradually come under the district
court, and until a district is ? proclaimed ? as a ? hundred,? and
contains a district court, or, that is to say, comes to be re-
cognised as containing a sufficient number of inhabitants and
land in cultivation ; the control of the squatters? ? runs ? would
remain under the central government as at present.
In order to facilitate the best adjustment of the question as
* The following piece of information has been published during the printing of
this book, the substance of which, as bearing upon the value of squatting stations
and the disproportionate and inadequate payment made by the squatters for the
privileges they enjoy?as compared with the price demanded by the Government
for land for agricultural purposes ?is worthy of remark and particular notice.
?Mr. Eichie?s station (Aringa), containing 12,000 acres, has been rented by
Mr. Eobertson, for seven years, at an annual rent of 3s. per acre. Its contiguity
to Belfast cannot affect its value as a cattle station, and people will think that if
Mr. Eobertson can pay 3s. per acre, the squatters generally might pay 6d. per
acre or even more.?
Question suggested. ?If the squatters are permitted the exclusive occupancy of
their stations at 2d. per acre, whilst the value is so much more (as proved by the
exercise of their pre-emptive right and the purchase by them of 640 acres of their
runs at �1 per acre), what will be the extent of their indebtedness to the commu-
nity at the end of the term for which they are permitted to occupy ?


respects this part of it, much good might be effected by taking
evidence of the working of the system in South Australia; and
parties residing there might be invited to state their experience
of the matter. So that whatever in reference to commonage
and pastoral runs is suitable and proper to adopt may be
applied here, and whatever in their measures is objectionable
might be rejected.
One objection to the system in force in South Australia, is
this : Right of Commonage is given to the holders of land, in
proportion to the quantities of land individually held and
purchased. This presents an amount of preference and favorit-
ism. The objection will be somewhat removed however, if the
provisions for cultivation are applied here. In that case it may
be fair to grant the right of commonage on the principle
alluded to?for it will then be in proportion to the amount of
land held in cultivation, and not of land purchased.
It is not possible, in this short space, to go more fully into
this part of the subject. Sufficient mention perhaps is made,
to convey what is intended as that part of a New Law, which is
to regulate the use and occupation of those lands?unsold for
grazing and squatting purposes. And it is only that part of
the plan adopted in South Australia?referring to land not
occupied for cultivation?that it is here suggested, as being (if
modified and improved) applicable together with the other plans
for sale and cultivation, herein proposed.
One omission was made in that part of the subjeet, (Chapter
II.) treating of the evils of the present Land Law. It has
been said, that ? it causes capital and money to leave the
colony, and find their way to countries which will yield a better
return.?
It is easy to show how the present law causes money to flow
out of the colony. It is ascertained that out of upwards of
2,000,000 acres of land sold, only 100,000 acres, or thereabouts
?are under cultivation.
If the inference is drawn that the remainder is bought for


squatting purposes ?and if such be correct ?it is at once a
strong argument that the squatters do not pay nearly the rent-
value of their ? runs.?
But if the more probable conclusion is made, namely, that the
great portion of the two million acres sold but remaining
uncultivated, is held on speculation, and is the property of an
absentee proprietary; then we see that every �1 which is paid
for this land finds its way out of the colony, and goes into the
pockets of these absentee proprietors. And we then see how
much in this way alone, the system causes capital to flow out
of the colony. And that it is not for the benefit of those who
have to get a living by their industry here?that the present
system is upheld ' } but for the profit of these speculators and
absentees.
The present system for the sale of land, shows this result.
That the portion of land sold, but remaining uncultivated, is
over two million acres.
That the squatting interest has been disturbed to the extent
of the two millions of acres sold, but uncultivated, .without any
commensurate advantage to the public.
If therefore the squatters, as a body oppose a change in the
land law, it at once proves them to be insincere in their pro-
fessions. And the public have grounds for concluding, that
they are the chief speculators in land, and have been enabled
to purchase the two million acres which remain uncultivated
out of the profits obtained by the privileges they enjoy. For
if the system for the sale of land advocated in this book was in
force, the squatters would only have been disturbed to the
extent of the requirements of the colony for cultivated land,
instead of to the extent of two million acres as the portion
sold and held on speculation uncultivated.
These facts shew that the squatter, if sincere, has a deep
interest with the rest of the community, in supporting the
measure advocated in this work.
The arguments in this book are deduced from the following
premises.


That all legislation should be consistent with?and based
upon the principles of the religion which we profess, i.e. Chris-
tianity.
That where the great majority of the community are
controlled in their actions by the principles of their religion,
the power of self-control is sufficiently possessed, and the
elements of intelligence and voluntary industry are present,
and form a guarantee that a representative system of govern-
ment is suitable to such a community.
That all mankind have similar dispositions and propensities,
with this difference only, that in some they exist stronger than
in others, and circumstances have called them into more active
existence in some than in others. That all are subject to the
temptation to misuse or abuse their faculties, by circumstances,
some to a greater degree than others.
That useful occupation and employment, i.e. industry, is one
safeguard against the temptation spoken of.
That the proper use and exercise of the mental and physical
faculties, is what is described by the word virtue, and brings
the highest attainable degree of happiness in this world.
That any human law or action which renders employment
difficult to obtain?or, in other words, which discourages,
obstructs, or fetters industry?is subversive of human happiness,
because it promotes the temptation to evil spoken of.
That amongst other dispositions and propensities, there is in
human nature a desire to possess power. That the misuse or
abuse of this leads to selfishness and acts of tyranny and
cruelty.
That the history of the world shews, that those who have
obtained a monopoly of wealth, have been able to seize upon
power, and that the wrong exercise of it?has created diffi-
culties for the peaceful and industrious?and directly or by
indirect means been the fruitful cause of much misery in the
world.
Thence it follows, that it is unsafe for society to permit a


system of legislation which will lead to a monopoly of wealth,
and therefore it is unsafe to delegate exclusively the power of
making laws, or of giving a veto to them?to those only who
possess property. It is also unsafe to give to those who
possess property a preference?in the election of those delegated
to make laws.
A recent article in the ? London Economist? contains the
following. Referring to legislation in England :
? A great improvement has been made in legislation and
in administering the government, which has not been without
effect on the public morals. It may be supposed that credit is
given to the police and to penal laws, for the additional security
which they are in no wise instrumental in effecting. Our
improved commercial legislation, has tended to enrich the
country, to increase the employment and rewards of industry,
to ensure more regular supplies of food, to remove many causes
of ill-will and discontent; it has lessened the temptation to
steal and the disposition to thwart the law, and has been more
influential in lessening the offences, than all the efforts directly
made to attain the object.?
Cannot the people of Victoria profit by the lesson these facts
teach 1


CHAPTER V.
OUR LANDS. HOW TO GET AT THEM. A LEAGUE PROPOSED.
How very many people there are in this colony who are
dragging out a precarious and miserable existence either on the
diggings, or in trade, or who no sooner than they have gained
by their industry or good fortune a few hundred pounds,
either by mining or in trade, are, from the shifting and unstable
nature of things here, forced to employ it in some new pursuit
or fresh situation either in town or on the diggings and ever
losing their money and wasting their industry. It is to such
persons having families and a small amount of money to whom,
amongst others, an easy access to the land for purposes of culti-
vation will be a great boon. To all such the lines of the poet
are particularly applicable?inviting them to support a league.
? Come ye who still the cumbrous load of life
Push hard up hill, hut as the farthest steep
You trust to reach and put an end to strife,
Down thunders hack the stone with mighty sweep
And hurls your labours to the valley deep
For ever vain?
Your cares and toils.?
A very great deal of the uncertainty and instability attending
our pursuits and the results of our industry may be traced to
bad legislation, and to an absence of the quality of statesmen in
those who make the laws.
How to get at our lands is the question ; and to suggest a plan
by which we may secure improvement in the laws which control
the application of industry and capital so that we may
encourage the right application of these by the establishment of
a generous land law.
For the purpose of supplying ? the means to the end,? many
who read this will see the importance and justice of extending
the franchise, instituting manhood suffrage, the more equitable
division of electoral districts, and abolishing the property
qualification clauses, &c.


The justice of and necessity for these alterations, as well as
others in our Act of Constitution, ought not to be under-rated j
but we cannot lose sight of the fact that it is not every person
who has studied the science of politics and government, few
have paid that attention to these subjects sufficient to enable
them (in following up the relation between cause and effect) to
trace the need for the right settlement of those political
questions so as to make it visible how much the proper solution
of the land question ?so devoutly to be wished ? may hinge
upon the correct arrangement of those measures.
But a great majority of the community are agreed that ?it is
time a better and more generous land law was established, and how
to obtain the end in view is then the question.
To the merchant, to the trader, to the farmer, to the miner,
to the mechanic, to the labourer, to the supporter of the ? eight
hours? ? system ; indeed to all, for all are directly or indirectly
interested in the right adjustment of the land question, it is
proposed that they should form and support a league, having
for its object the diffusion of information upon the subject of the
lands and the promotion of the election of men to fill the Houses
of Legislature who will, without doubt favour the passing of a
liberal and improved land law, and every other measure tending
to that purpose.
Shall this be done 1 or shall we ;
? Be like the hog that hath
A pearl at his desire,
But takes more pleasure at the trough
And wallowing in the mire.?
All great reforms have been secured by leagues and com-
binations.
?Would you then learn to dissipate the band
Of those huge threatening difficulties dire
That in the weak man?s way like lions stand ?
His soul appal, and damp his rising fire P
Eesolve, resolve, and to be men aspire.
Exert that nobest privilege alone ?
Here to mankind indulged?control desire;
Let godlike reason from her sovereign throne _
Speak the commanding word, ? I will,-? and it is done.
No good for humanity (of a benevolent design) was ever


secured without some struggle?without some self sacrifice?
but the advantages felt, when the end is obtained, more than
repay a temporary loss.
Magna Charta, or the ? Bill of Rights,? so often referred to,
was gained by a strenuous and determined struggle, and the
combination of men leagued together to demand that which a
sense of justice urged them to seek. In more modern times we
have the abolition of the slave trade?the passing of the
Catholic Emancipation Bill ?the Reform Bill, and, last, the
Repeal of the Corn Laws ?all brought about by the powerful
agency of leagues or combinations. The opposers of those
measures had (some of them) selfish and prejudiced motives to
urge them to the course they took?in like manner there are to
be found those who, for no better reasons, are opposed to a
change in the land law.
All, then, who see the benefits to be derived by a liberal
land law are urged to assist in forming and supporting a league,
as being the most likely means of obtaining the object sought.


All hail to the barons of old *
Who so manfully fought for their right;
Hurrah for the spirits so bold
Who grappled with darkness and might.
Fight on worthy sons of such sires
For your liberties struggle?aye die ;
Nor let power extinguish the fires
That brighten your thorny way.
Shall you in this wide golden land
Reap the woes of slavery born ;
Or mournfully turn from the strand
Where liberty?s tree is uptorn ?
Must Britons desert the bright flag
That should only wave o?er the free;
Or starve where the yellow ear?d corn,
The vine, and the fig cultured be ?
No, give us the lands that lie waste,
And our neat little homesteads shall rise
Then to labour we?ll joyfully haste
While our merry songs ring to the skies.
* The barons who, in King John?s time, forced Idm to sign the Magna Charta
and thus laid the foundation of liberty in England.


It is proper to state that the idea of giving circulation to the
annexed Eeport of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce,
containing the following Land Scheme, which originated with
a Select Committee of that Chamber, is quite voluntary on the
part of the author of this book ; for he has not been urged or
solicited to do so by any member of that Chamber. It should
also be stated that it is to a few members only of that Chamber
that the public are indebted for the following plan.
Report of the Special Committee of the Melbourne Chamber op Com-
merce on ? the best means of promoting Agriculture and the Settlement
of the Waste Lands of the Colony.?
Your committee disclaim all political feeling in this momentous ques-
tion; they have endeavoured in all their suggestions to provide for the
general welfare of the colony, irrespective of all class interests ; and in laying
before the Chamber the result of their labours, your committee wish it to be
understood that in making the following remarks on the Land Question they
are not wedded to any particular system : if a more practicable and equally
comprehensive mode can be suggested, they are prepared to support it.
Your committee having duly considered the subject, and availed them-
selves of all the documentary and other evidence they could procure, as well
as information furnished by several members of the Chamber, practically
acquainted with what has been done in other countries, have agreed in the
following Report, which they now with confidence submit to this special
meeting of the Chamber for its approval and adoption :
1. Your committee cannot but express their decided conviction, that
the present Crown Land Regulations of the colony are radically defective,
and have tended to produce and aggravate much of the depression under
which the colonists are now suffering.
2. Your committee consider, that it is only by a complete change in
these regulations?their thorough revision and modelling?that the colony
can gradually be restored to a state of permanent prosperity.
3. Your committee declare, without fear of contradiction, that the sale
of Land in Victoria has failed to provide food for its population. Out of
62,800,000 of acres, the estimated area of the colony, about 1,400,000 acres
have been sold up to the present time ; the remainder is held almost entirely
by 800 individuals, under the annual licenses of occupation for pastoral
purposes. Had proper care been taken when selling the above Lands to
secure their improvement and cultivation by the purchasers, it would have
provided food for all the present population of the colony ; but as there is no
such condition involved in the terms upon which the Land has been alienated
from the Crown, it is the opinion of your committee?although, in the
absence of all reliable statistics, they have no positive evidence?that not
one-tenth part of the land sold, is actually under cultivation with crops suit-
able for the food of man.
4. Your committee consider that the aspect of the Land Question has
been entirely altered by the sudden and large increase of the population of
the colony, an increase unparalleled in any country, except California. On
the 31st December, 1850, about four or five months after gold was produced
in quantity, the whole colony contained about 88,000 souls ? and on the 31st
December, 1854, it may safely be estimated at 320,000 ; shewing an increase
in three years of 232,000. It is most desirable that a sufficiency of Land


should be sold, and not only sold, but cultivated, to provide food and employ-
ment for this large increase in the population, and render us in this respect
independent of the neighbouring colonies and of foreign countries.
5. Your committee report that the effect of the large increase in the
population, combined with the large production of gold, and the want of any
provision to insure the cultivation of the land?has been to diminish the
resources of the colonists, and impoverish the colony generally, by causing
an yearly importation of breadstuffs and vegetable productions to the
amount of two millions, all of which we have to pay to the neighboring
colonies, to Chili, the United States, and the mother country.
6. Your committee, while deploring a state of things so prejudicial to
the welfare of the colony, express their conviction that the evil will be ag-
gravated year by year, as population increases, if an effort be not at once
made to change our Land System, and suit it to the wants and desires of
the colonists.
7. Your committee are of opinion that the system in operation at the
present time for the disposal of Crown Lands, is the worst that could be
adopted in a country like Victoria. In a new country, land should be ob-
tainable by actual settlers at a low rate. The experience of Canada and the
United States, ?countries settled and improved by Englishmen and their
descendents, proves that the greater the inducements offered to emigrants,
in enabling them to settle on small sections of land, and in the terms of
payment, the more the country advances in prosperity and wealth. Cali-
fornia, one of the States of the Union, presents so strong an analogy to
Victoria, ?in the small number of inhabitants piior to the discovery of
gold ; in the rapid increase of population, and enhancement of the price of
labor and of food, ?that we cannot do better, while considering this great
question, than keep it constantly before us. But all analogy ceases when
we come to the land question. Owing to the freedom from .artificial re-
strictions and impediments, California, within six years, has become an ex-
porting country. We have good soil, abundance of it, a fine climate, and
an energetic population ; let us remove the barriers which prevent us from
free access to our lands, and in a few years we shall do as California has
done.
8. It is the opinion of your committee, that the policy of Government
in the sale of Crown lands has injured the colony, and impoverished its in-
habitants. Had our Crown lands been surveyed and offered for selection,
at a low fixed price, to actual settlers, the land would have been cultivated,
and an immense amount of capital retained in the colony ; all of which has
been either swallowed up in the purchase of land at a high price, or paid to
other countries to provide us with food. The following shows the quantity
of land sold and the price paid for it at different dates :
Ist July to 31st December, 1855, ?sold, 145,000 acres, for �838,557,
or nearly �6 per acre.
Ist January to 30th June, 1854, ?sold, 213,270 acres, for �810,789,
or nearly �4 per acre.
This money has been employed in making roads and bridges, and partly
in bringing out emigrants ; but your committee think that the extraction of
�1,600,000 from the pockets of the colonists in twelve months, has im-
poverished them and absorbed a great part of the capital that would, with
land at a cheap rate, and thereby entailing loss on themselves and their
connections ; also to the number who have come out to Victoria, and re-
turned to the old country, or re-emigrated to the neighboring colonies, in
consequence of the want of suitable employment.
9. Your committee have to report that the present system has had the
effect of causing Government and the land speculators to combine against


the interests of the great body of the colonists. By the 11th section of 5
and 6 Victoria, the Land Sales Act, the Governor is empowered to raise the
upset price one-tenth part of any country land offered for sale ; but at a
late Government land sale the proportions were almost reversed?about one-
tenth was put up at �1 per acre, and nine-tenths above that rate. Besides
this in general, all lots at �1 per acre are too large for the small farmer, but
are eagerly purchased by speculators and capitalists; and whenever a work-
ing man, the most valuable kind of settler, attempts to purchase a lot of
eighty to a hundred acres at a Government sale he is exposed to the compe-
tition of parties who never intend to occupy or cultivate the land.
10. To remedy this state of things, your committee, after due considera-
tion, have to submit to the Chamber the following outline of a plan, similar,
in many respects, to that which has attracted such an extensive emigration
to Canada and the United States, altered, in a slight degree, to suit the
circumstances and wants of colony of Victoria. It has been your committee?s
wish and endeavour, to provide a remedy for the present state of things, to
avoid any partiality to a particular class, and to have our land system
established on a firm and permanent basis.
11. In recommending their plan to the Chamber, the committee have
refrained from alluding to vested interests, or to any claims which may
exist upon the Crown lands of the colony, for two reasons: firstly, it does
not come within the scope of their duty ; and secondly, they consider the
interest of the great mass of the people to be permanent, and that any
impediment in the way can be equitably arranged.
12. Your committee recommend to the Chamber the following system, as
one which has been tried and found successful in Canada and the United
States, and has furnished a home to thousands of our countrymen, and
which has tended year by year to increase the prosperity of those countries: ?
Plan for the Disposal and Settlement op Crown Lands.
1. The Colony fof Victoria, so far as practicable, to be surveyed and sub-
divided into townships and sections, of about six miles square, or a
superficial area of 36 square miles.
2. That roads be laid out at proper intervals in every township.
3. That every township be laid out in sections of one square mile, or 640
acres sub-divided into 8 or 16 sub-sections or lots, 80 or 40 acres
respectively.
4. That Government reserve for sale all land ascertained to be mineral,
also such lands as may be necessary for Government purposes, such
as military stations, and other public buildings.
5. That Government land offices be established in different parts of the
colony, where all information shall be provided to the intending
settler, in relation to all lands offered for sale in the neighbouring
townships, its location, description of soil, adaptation to agricultural
or grazing purposes, its facilities for irrigation, &c. Also that detailed
plans of the surveys be kept in these offices, showing the reserved lots,
those sold, and what remain unsold.
6. That any subject of Great Britain, or any foreigner who may declare
his intention of being naturalised, be entitled to select and enter
upon any quantity of such unsold Land, say from 40 to 640 acres, at
the fixed price of five shillings per acre, on the following conditions ;
1. That he forthwith commence the improvement of the same by fencing,
erecting a habitation, and cultivating; and your committee would
recommend that any foreigner becoming a purchaser should be thereby
entitled to his letters of naturalisation and enjoy all the rights and
privileges of a British subject.
2. That within one year he pay one-half of the purchase-money, or 2s. 6d.
per acre.


3. That within two years he pay the balance of 2s. 6d. per acre.
4. That Government shall, thereupon, give him a clear title to said land,
subject to his own use and disposal forever,'^at?a fixed charge of one
pound for each title.
5. That from the day of entering on the land, the settler should be entitled
to all minerals on or under the surface.
6. In case such purchaser fail in any of the before mentioned conditions,
he shall lose any improvements he may have made, and his land shall
be open to selection and purchase the same as if it had never been
occupied.
7. All real estate in every township shall be subject to taxation for the
following purposes, such taxation to be imposed by the inhabitants of
each township respectively :?The cost of government of such town-
ships, including police courts, jails, etc. ; also for making and keeping
in repair all township roads ; also for the support of public schools,
and for the maintenance of the poor, and for any other improvement
that tlje inhabitants of such township may deem necessary for its
advancement or protection.
8. That any township be empowered to borrow money for public works or
improvements, duly providing for the interest and repayment of prin-
cipal of its loans, by taxation on all the property of the township.
13. Your committee feel that the Chamber will look to it for the reasons
which have induced it to recommend the foregoing, to its adoption. Your
committee think that the stimulus of cheap Land, which is now annually
draining Europe to the amount of nearly 400,000 persons who all settle in
the United States and Canada, has been the main source of the prosperity of
those countries. We are at a much greater distance from the mother country
and from Europe, but your committee is satisfied that were it once known
that in Victoria, under the British flag, a home was offered to all the world,
combining the advantages of moderate price, easy terms of payment and
local self-government, we should induce an amount of immigration, of which,
at present, we have no conception.
14. Your committee venture to express their conviction, that were the
Crown Lands of this Colony thrown open on the above terms, the general
Government would be at once freed from a position which at present embar-
rasses it much, viz., the providing of magistrates, police, forage, etc., for all
parts of the country. By giving the Colonists local self-government, your
committee believe that the people would be more contented and happy, and
would provide adequately for their own wants.
15. Your committee would likewise remark on the impolicy and injustice
of the emigration system at present in force. It is most expensive, and
provides us with the worst class of immigrants. The sending money home
for such a purpose, has tended to raise the passage-money of the immigrant
who comes here at his own cost, at least 60 per cent. Besides, we furnish
Government immigrants with employment on their arrival, and board and
lodging till they get it; wdiile we tax the industrious and valuable class of
free immigrants, and leave them entirely to their own resources.
16. Your committee do not hesitate to condemn this vicious system, and
to recommend its abandonment. They are satisfied that we shall get suffi-
cient immigrants of a superior class, by opening up our lands at a low price ;
and that we are only draining the colony of its resources by remitting over
half-a-million annually to bring out an inferior class of settlers.
17. Your committee are decided that the present system of auction sale
of Crown Lands is most impolitic, and is rapidly diminishing the capital of
the colony. The farmer requires capital quite as much as the merchant. In
a new country he incurs heavy expense in preparing his land for crop, and
has to wait for that crop before any return can be received for his outlay ;
and if he has to laf out all his capital, as at present, to buy a piece of land,
he has none left for improvements.


18. Your committee would briefly allude to the importance of opening
up the country by a general system of railways ; they would merely express
their conviction that nothing would tend more, in conjunction with the sale
of Land at a low price, to develop the resources of this fine country, and to
render it great and permanently prosperous.
19 Your committee find that the present Land System is producing the
same effect as the English Corn Laws ; capital and men are fast leaving the
colony, and finding their way to countries which will yield a better return ;
the price of food is kept at an artificial rate, while the wages of labour are
falling day by day. To throw open the lands we should at once require rail-
ways and labourers, capital will find that it can be profitably employed, and
the price of labour will not fall materially, even should the expense of living
be much reduced.
20. Your committee would point out the great benefit of District Land
Offices, in affording reliable information to the settler, in the immediate
neighbourhood of the Land he wishes to purchase, and securing him thereby
from being deceived by Land Jobbers or Speculators. ?
21. It is clearly for the interest of the Government that the Colony
should be settled as soon as possible, and by people who will not only pur-
chase, but occupy and improve the Land. Our general revenue is raised by
a tax on the consumption of spirits, wines, beer, tobacco, sugar, tea, and
coffee ; and surely everything that adds to the number of producers, will
increase the number of consumers also, and the more will Government get
in the shape of taxation.
22. Your committee cannot think that the occupiers of pastoral lands
would be prejudiced by any measure that will increase the number of con-
sumers of beef, mutton, and wool; they know how much their interests were
improved by the rush of population following the discovery of the gold-fields,
and thereby can estimate the value of a continued increase of colonists.
23. Your committee consider it imperative on the Government to do all
in its power to avert a famine. With a large population dependent almost
entirely on foreign countries for breadstuff?s, we are liable at any moment to
feel the effects of a bad crop in the neighbouring colonies. We possess a
soil capable of producing everything required by man, and it behoves the
Government to place no stumbling block in the way of opening the lands.
Were we to be thrown on our own resources, owing to short imports of food,
or a bad crop, in the other Australian colonies, your committee believe that
the whole country would be thrown into anarchy and confusion.
_ 24. In concluding their report, your committee have to mention that
their wish has been to recommend the introduction of a system of land sales,
based upon the broad principles of social and political economy. They feel
satisfied it will recommend itself to the Chamber and to the community at
large. It has been their wish and endeavour to avoid anything of a political
nature, and to free the question from any allusion to existing interests,
whether of occupiers or purchasers of land, under the present regulations.
Your committee are convinced that once the great question of really and
truly settling the Grown Lands is brought fairly before the public, the settle-
ment of vested interests will be a matter easily arranged.
25. Your committee would sum up their report in a few words ;
Ist. It condemns the sale of land by unction, and consequent com-
petition.
2nd. It points out the evil effects of a high price for land.
3rd. It shows that at present no provision is made for cultivation
or improvement.
4th. It shows that capital is fast leaving the colony, and that the
colonists are impoverished by their means being spent on
land and on the importation of food. .


sth. It recommends an entire change of system :
Land at a low price, and easy terms of payment, with the view of
attracting and retaining capital in the colony.
Provision for cultivation and improvement of the land.
Local Government and taxation for all roads, etc.
District land offices, to afford information to purchasers.
By abandoning Government immigration, it destroys the compe-
tition which has increased the free immigrant?s passage-
money at least fifty per cent.
