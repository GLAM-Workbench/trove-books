COLLECTION
OIST BEHALF OF THE
SYNOD FUND
Appointed to be made in the beginning of March.
The object of this Fund is to provide for the payment of
all the expenses incurred by the Synod which are not met
by the ?Church Extension? and Sustentation? Funds.
The stipends of Ministers not in settled charges are paid
from the former, and of those in settled charges from the
latter.
This Fund provides for the expense incurred in printing
the Report of its Annual Meeting, as well as all other docu-
ments issued by the authority of the Synod. It is very
desirable that all the members of the Church should be made
aware of the subjects that engage the attention of their
Ministers and Elders in Synod assembled, and also of the
decisions arrived at respecting them. Our people will be
led to take a deeper interest in the prosperity of the Church;
and, it is hoped, to pray that the blessed influences of the
Holy Spirit may be bestowed upon their Ministers and
Elders, that those decisions may be given and those measures
adopted which will best promote the cause of Christ, The
circulation of the Annual Report will do much to secure
this end.
It provides for the payment of travelling expenses,
especially of those Ministers who live at great distances
from Sydney, and who cannot, therefore, attend the meet-
ings of Church Courts without heavy expense.
The salaries of the officials of the Synod are also paid
from this Fund.
All these objects, though inferior in importance to the
Sustentation Fund, are necessary in their own place, and
cannot be overlooked without serious injury to the Church.
It is earnestly hoped that all our people will contribute to
this Fund as God has prospered them.
