Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom
Lead Thou me on.
The night is dark, and I am far from home:
Lead Thou me on.
Keep Thou my feet; I do not ask to see
The distant scene; one step enough for me.
I was not ever thus, nor pray’d that Thou
Shouldst lead me on;
I loved to choose and see my path; but now
Lead Thou me on.
I loved the garish day, and spite of fears
Pride ruled my will; remember not past years.
So long Thy power hath blest me, sure it still
Will lead me on
O’er moor and fen, o’er crag and torrent, till
The night is gone.
And with the morn those angel faces smile
Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile.
Amen.

Psalm XX33111
The Lord is my shepherd: therefore can I lack nothing.
He shall feed me in a green pasture: and lead me forth beside the
waters of comfort.
He shall convert my soul: and bring me forth in the paths of
righteousness for His name’s sake.
Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil: for Thou art with me Thy rod and Thy staff comfort
me.
Thou shall prepare a table before me against them that trouble
me: Thou hast anointed my head with oil and my cup shall be full.
But Thy loving-kindness and mercy shall follow me all the days
of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.
Gloria.

3fi}mn
Ten thousand times ten thousand,
In sparkling raiment bright.
The armies of the ransom’d saints
Throng up the steeps of light:
Tis finish’d, all is finish’d.
Their fight with death and sin:
Fling open wide the golden gates,
And let the victors in.
Oh then what raptured greetings
On Canaan’s happy shore.
What knitting sever’d friendships up
Where partings are no more!
Then eyes with joy shall sparkle
That brimm’d with tears of late;
Orphans no longer fatherless.
Nor widows desolate.
Bring near Thy great salvation,
Thou Lamb for sinners slain.
Fill up the roll of Thine elect.
Then take Thy power and reign:
Appear, Desire of nations.
Thine exiles long for home;
Show in the heavens Thy promised sign:
Thou Prince and Saviour, come.
Amen
