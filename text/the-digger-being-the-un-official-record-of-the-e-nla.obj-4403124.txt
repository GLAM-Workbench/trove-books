1 I 'HE task of collecting material
and putting it into form
for publication has been no light
one, for the whole work had to
be completed in the time between
the date of departure from our
first port of call and that of
arrival at our second halt.
Owing to the continued spell
of rough weather after leaving
the dear old shores of Maoriland,
nothing was done at all in con-
nection with our magazine before
touching at a port. The men
were gradually finding their sea-
legs and getting accustomed to
ship routine. Thoughts could
with difficulty be turned to any-
thing pertaining to literary work,
and, besides, had the attempt
been made the Editor is certain
that the magazine would have
been a treatise on the evils of a
sea life as told by one who had
never been to sea The sufferers
from mal-de-mer were in the
majority for our first few days
out, and as it is certain that
those who contributed to the
magazine had their hours of woe
it was deemed wise to make no
move until the feel of good old
mother earth had put all once
more on their feet.
EDITORIAL.
The work is not intended to
be of any literary eminence.
Rather is it the simple expres-
sion of the plain soldier doing
his best to chronicle those things
which may interest the " dear
ones" left behind, and to add
another magazine to the list of
those already published by out-
going Reinforcements. We hope
it may hold a worthy place
among those already compiled.
It was realised that in four-
teen days very little could be
done in turning out a magazine
complete and finished in every
degree. To unearth talent where
it was least expected. To search
for the one who had ability, and
yet knew not his ability was the
task of those responsible for the
production.
Fortune favours the bold, for
in our attempt to unearth talent
we came across Private Harding,
our artist. We had an idea of
his ability, but did not know his
full worth. Words will not do
justice to his work, and any suc-
cess the magazine may achieve
we can without hesitation ascribe
to a great extent to him. He
laboured long and untiringly for
the short time we had at our
disposal. His pictures speak
volumes, and words are inade-
quate to express the ideas which
he so easily conveys in lines.
The spirit of strive-to-do-one's-
best has been the salient feature
in the training of the 41st Re-
inforcement. No better phrase
than " Totis viribus " (with one's
whole strength and might) will
do to describe the manner in
which the Reinforcement mobil-
ised—trained—embarked for the
front. The majority of the men
are married, and leave behind
wife, family and home—the dear-
est a man can part with, —but
Duty called. However, those re-
maining behind made the realest,
greatest sacrifice. All felt their
sorrow at leaving, but as is
characteristic with the New
Zealander the men did not carry
their hearts on their sleeve.
They did not show in their de-
meanour what they were feeling,
and so with true colonial spirit
were soon taking their places
among their fellows, entering into
work and play with them and
carrying out the daily routine.
Our little magazine is compiled
with the idea of conveying to
those dearest to us a slight idea
of our daily routine—our work
and our play on board.


Our Title.
One ot the many questions which
call for solution at the hands of any
Committee which is organising a Re-
inforcement Magazine is " What shall
we call it?" And it often requires
much hard thinking to supply an
answer. Our case was no exception
to the rule, and the Committee had
considerable difficulty in arriving at
a decision. We wanted the title to
be short and striking, to be original
and, if possible, to have a special
significance for our Reinforcement; As
many reinforcement magazines had
preceded ours, to get something en-
tirely new was not easy. Suggestions
were called for from the men and a
prize offered for the best one received.
The titles suggested were many and
varied, but for the most part did not
disclose a very great degree of ori-
ginality or a very acute appreciation
of the functions of our magazine,
judging by the names put forward it
might have been a Comic Cuts, a
Latin Treatise, a Ladies; journal, or
a Nautical Journal. Alliteration was
a strong point with some, and ac-
counted for such efforts as p an f;
port Trifles," "Neptune
" Sea Stunts," and 1 Tales of a lub.
The name of our good ship gave rise
to the suggestions " Ulimarover, an
" uifmaroarer." Our country pf
origin was not forgotten, and we re-
ceived such suggestions as the
Hope of the Antipodes and Mas-
sey's Guide." Aspirants for the hon-
our of making the lucky hit foundla
fertile source of inspiration in the
fact that ours was the first Reinforce-
ment of married men to sail. we
had suggested to ' X attar s
Turn," " Dear Old Dad, ta
Missing Link " (this wa^ a .^ c °PP a "
by the drawing of a _ kiddie), a:nd
"The Turn of the 'lied. Other
miscellaneous suggestions were " the
Fortyfirstograph," "The Message,
" The Diehards," " Tit-bits, Fond
Memories," " Ocean Idylls, In-
dex " " Pitchings and Tossmgs and
" The Digger's Realm." Objections
could be raised to nearly all these
titles, and by a process of elimina-
tion we cut the possibilities down to
six :_« The Turn of the Tied, The
Wake," " Chips from the Log," " J he
Warrior," " Keahauteo (going
ahead) and " The Digger." The last
of these found most favour and was
finally decided upon. It was short
and distinctive, and we thought not
without point. We are going forth to
do battle not as hardened warriors
or making any pretentions to mill-
tary genius. We know little of the
art of the war, but we are determined
to " slog in " and do our bit, and
make that bit as big as possible. If
" stickability " is going to win the
war, we hope to be able to lend a
hand. do not look for spectacular
jobs, but nuite realise that much of
our work will be of a very hum-drum
nature. We will be quite content to
be persevering " diggers." Further,
the word " digger " has lately come
to be a term of common use among
our New Zealand soldiers and those
who meet with them in the training
camps and at the Front. The New
Zealander is the " Digger " as the
Australian is the " Ossie." Both
these names will no'doubt find a place
in the dictionaries of a later age, and
we are doing a little to perpetuate a
name of which the new Zealander
has every reason to be proud.
Write and tell me what you're doing,
What's the latest gossip brewing-
Kind of clothes you're going to wear,
Tell me how you fix your hair.
Anything at all will do,
So long it brings me word of you.
"Us," or the 41st Rein-
forcement.
During the last week in May began
the mobilisation of this Reinforcement.
They were a fine body of men, perhaps
on the average some years older than
the few preceding drafts, all sober-
minded, deep-thinking men who
realised that duty called, and that
each must put forth all his energy to
become fit and be able to his
place in the ranks.
it was an obvious fact that right
from the very start each one had
made up his mind to work hard. The
significance of the old motto, " Per
Augusta ad Augusta," I could not
help feeling during the first few weeks
after the recruits' entry into camp.
There was first of all the equipping
and then the dozen other things at-
tendant on mobilisation. All was
carried through in the best of spirits,
even though the rain did its very ut-
most in good old Trentham style to
dampen everybody's ardour.
The 41st Reinforcement was made
up of seven large companies officered
by three and four officers per company.
Shortly after all the equipping was
completed, a move was made to Tau-
herenikau, where just over three weeks
were spent learning the elements of
squad drill, physical drill and mus-
ketry. The training was necessarily
rushed because it was realised that the
reinforcement would get only a very
short period in the New Zealand
camps.
In spite of this the comments passed
by the training staff were all that
could be desired and every officer and
N.C.O. in the Reinforcement recog-
nised how much easier his work was
made by the spirit with which all
entered into the new routine. It must
be mentioned that the majority of the
men had never received any previous
military training unless it was in the
old Volunteer days. A sprinkling,
too, were South African veterans, but
the entirely new drill levelled up the
differences, and all were recruits.
Tauherenikau was left in the rain,
but no one minded, because the anti-
cipation of Trentham and final leave
immediately after arrival made even
the most stoical feel like the school-
boy whose exuberant spirits cause him
to throw up his hat and shout joy-
ously as he finishes with school and
departs for his vacation.
Final leave extended over a fort-
night, and with very few exceptions
all were back in camp at its terinina-
tion. Good-byes had been said ; how
sad they were the individuals them-
selves know, for were not all leaving
wives and homes behind? The majority
who knew 110 such ties —the younger
men of the Reinforcement who knew
they were embarking on a mighty
adventure —felt just as keenly that
home had been left. But that stoical
exterior and the absence of any sign
of emotion was most noticeable as our
troopship pulled out from the wharf.
Lumps in the throat must have been
swallowed, but there was nothing to
show that a boatload of men was not
merely leaving on a week-end jaunt.
Prior to embarkation the Reinforce-
ment was divided into two drafts,
" E," " F," "G" Companies of the
41st and ''l) " 40 being named the
41st draft and " A," " B," " C,"
" D " of the original 41st becoming
42nds. The departure of the latter
was to be shortly after ours, and even
now 1 expect they are ploughing
through those rough seas which we so
lately have come through.
We have been most unfortunate up
till the last few'days in the constant
tossing we have experienced. Al-
though at no time has it been so rough
that the decks have been awash, yet
flie green and bluey-lead billows have
curled their foaming crests untiringly.
In spite of the many the first few
days of tossing laid low, the spirit of
all has been maintained, and every-
thing augurs well for the name and
reputation of the New Zealand troops
being ably upheld by the 41sts.
Private X had got into a bad habit
of slackness in the morning. 011 sev-
eral occasions the Orderly Corpora 1,
whose duty is to see that all are out
reported him to his O.C. " This is
a serious case," said the Officer.
"What have you got to say?" "I
shall say nothing if you don't, sir,"
Private X replied innocently. " Have
you ever been up before me since you
came aboard?" " Dunno, sir, what
time do you mostly get up? "

Our Day.
Reveille! The dawn of day for
the Soldier—in camp, on troopship,
behind the line.
Does ever a sleepy voice mutter
epithets at the clarion note ? I fear
that even a Soldier is not always
ready to spring from his bunk or
hammock with that alacrity with
which one imagines everything done
in the army.
However, all finally manage to drag
themselves out of their hammocks —
some impelled by the " Here! get
out yer " given , in the Corporal's most
severe gutturals, others more or less
of their own accord. Then begins the
rolling of blankets and hammocks and
the hurried dressing. A short half
hour is allowed for dormitories to be
cleared of their sleepy occupants. A I!
repair to the decks ready for the
morning's medicine given in small but
sweet parcels of " Arms bend," "Heels
raise," and other exercises known by
no other name to the soldier than
"Physical jerks." Deck space does
not allow of the playing of " Tiggy
touchwood " as depicted by our Artist
on another page; nor does the gentle
motion of our good ship allow of our
showing our graceful attitudes to the
best advantage in " Leg raise"—
that balance exercise that gives to the
onlooker the idea that he is watching
a stork nonchalantly dreaming away
his minutes in repose.
At length the air is pierced by
" Come to the cook-house call," which
only serves to sharpen the appetite
fast developing under the doses of
"Jerks." For this call is only for
the mess-orderlies who are performing
their arduous duties throughout the
voyage. They are the privileged
beings who are allowed below when
all others must be enjoying the sea
breezes or the howling winds on deck.
The term mess orderly does nqt indi
cate that the soldier is not the most
methodical and orderly of mortals,
even with his meals. It is a term of
the Army, and the mess-orderly is one
of the most popular among his' fellows
if he performs his task well. For is
not the feeding time the enjoyable
time in the day's routine ?
After breakfast is the time on ship
when the soldier makes himself spick
and span—not that I wish to give the
impression he does not wash before
breakfast; but he- has not the oppor-
tunity perhaps to shave before the
meal.
Fresh water—yes! to shave with,
but the brinv ocean affords the only
means of removing the grime that re-
sults from the day's work. While
talking of washing, there appears in
Routine Orders at intervals through-
out the voyage the notification that
fresh water will be issued to troops
to the amount of half a bucket per
man with which to cleanse himself.
The duty of the officer at such time is
to see that the men perform the ab-
lutions. I wonder if the gentleman is
armed with a scrubbing brush in case
of emergency. At 7.30 a.m. we hear
the loud ringing of a bell. I have
heard the enquiry if this is the Offi-
cers' Reveille, but am assured it is
only meant as a warning for them:
to prepare for breakfast.
At 9.30 a.m. starts the real work
of the day. By this time all men
must be on parade, and squad drill,
musketry, lectures and physical drill
are attempted. I say attempted,
because there are real difficulties. Deck
space is limited, the position of the
boat is nine minutes out of ten at
varying angles from the perpendicu
lar; the wind blows the voice of the
N.C.O. to sea; and with a suddenness
to startle one the spray comes up to
pay his compliments.
CAPT. SHORT, O.C. Ship.
However, good work is done and
the men's time occupied as fully as
possible.
10 a.m. is the time the guard is
mounted. There are some dozen or
more posts at which sentries are sta-
tioned, there to fulfil their onerous
duties.
At noon again the men gather at
the tables for lunch, and at 5 p.m.
have dinner. For some reason there
is a. bigger rush in response to the
" Pick-em-up" bugle call than there
is to tumble out of hammocks at "Re-
veille."
'Until 2 p.m. the men enjoy a quiet
siesta. The various attitudes adopted
in the snug corners of the boat indi-
cate that there is some comfort even
when the deck performs the work of
the cushion.
The bugle disturbs the dream of the
smokers at 2 p.m., when the afternoon
routine begins. The first lesson in
semaphore signalling is given to the
men, boat drill and alarms are prac-
tised, and more physical drill gives
the incentive for dinner.
Darkness envelops the ship soon
after sunset. Then we glide silently
through the waters with no lights to
send out their gleams across the wide
expanse of heaving sea. Even smok-
ing on the open decks is not permit-
ted, and to strike a match in any
place which is exposed to the outsiae
world constitutes a crime.
The evenings pass quickly. The
men congregate round the" piano.
The Long, Long Trail" and other
equally well-known songs are taken up
in chorus. Gramophones emit their
gurgles, and card games are respon-
sible for small knots of silent players.
A few assemble in the stern of the
ship in twos and threes, there to be
alone to talk over what has been and
what may be, or to soliloquise as the
screw churns up the phosphorescent
depths.
Then sounds the " First Post," the
warning that bed-time is approaching,
followed by "Last Post" at 9 p.m.,
and then "Lights Out," when all
should be settled down in their ham-
mocks rocked gently by the movement
of our good ship as she plows her
way towards the goal for which we, in
our daily routine, are preparing.
H.
Taumarunui Jack.
When Taumarunui Jack appeared on
the train carrying the Auckland por-
tion of the 41st to camp, none enquired
too closely how he came to board the
train. The Auckland boys were free
from any suspicion of " dognapping."
lor had not "Mud" after passing
Parnell bridge held forth as follows :
Boys, we go to camp with a good
name; let us keep it," for which he
was cheered to the echo. Jack's ad-
vent excited admiration. At each
station " Tiny," his new master, gain
ed affection by copious supplies of ham
sandwiches.
ln camp Jack took to the new life.
Each night at the Y.M.C.A. he held
levee, laughing as only a collie dog
can laugh with the merry throng,
raising his paw for a shake to all ad-
mirers irrespective of rank. Jack was
a democrat.
The greater freedom of Tauhereni-
kau, coupled with the bad companion-
ship of a fox terrier, almost cost Jack
his life, but threatened dogs live long.
He was the pride of all route marches
—leading "F" Company like a
haughty S.M.
One day he disappeared. " Some-
one had called, and Jack went back
to civilian life. Once more he drives
a " Cocky's " sheep, and the '4lst
mourn the loss of their mascot.


Gifts.
The distribution of gifts was made
by a committee representing all units
on board. Our first week on the water
was very rough, and the. majority of
the men had not found their sea legs,
and so gladly welcomed the dainties
which had been sent aboard by their
friends. Their parcels filled three
large baggage rooms, so that the task
of distnouting them was by no means
an easy one.
There were several unclaimed par-
cels, and these the Committee decided
to hand over to O.C. Companies, who
distributed them among the men as
they thought fit. .
After ail parcels addressed to indi-
viduals were handed out we were able
to deal with the numerous cases of
odfts which had been donated by vari-
ous Patriotic Societies. Mrs. Luke
and the Lady Liverpool Fund Com-
mittee gave us four cases of cake which
we kept in reserve, until the men had
consumed their own supplies. On the
.second Sunday out arrangements were
made with the Quartermasters of each
Company to draw a supply for their
Company so that every man on board
received a fair share of cake. There
were 110 complaints when the Orderly
Officer inspected the meal that day. By
this time the men were looking for
games, and we were able to meet the
demand with a case of games which
had been forwarded by the Women s
Patriotic League, Auckland.
Our next task was the distribution
of literature which was received from
the following : The Manawatu Patri-
otic Society; St. John Ambulance
Association, Auckland; Auckland Pat-
riotic League; Soldiers' Club; Wo-
men's Provincial Patriotic League,
Auckland; Mrs. Eckford; C. S.
Fraser. .
I am sure the supply received will
easily meet the demands for the whole
vovage.
The Otago and Southland Women s
Patriotic League, and the Women's
Patriotic Committee, New Plymouth,
forwarded cases of gifts for men from
those districts. Lists of names were
called for and the gifts were dealt
out accordingly, any surplus number
going to men from Canterbury and
Wellington Districts. Besides the
above there were cases of gifts ad-
dressed to the Y.M.C.A. Secretary,
the Chaplain, and the Principal Me-
dical Officer, to whojn we handed them
in bulk for their personal attention.
Could the kind people who sent the
comforts for the boys have seen how
highly their gifts were appreciated,
they would' feel fully rewarded for
their efforts.
Ladies all, we thank you
Heard at the canteen on a stormy
day :
"Feel like a drink, Cobber?"
"No ! feel like a corpse."
About "E 41."
The Day we embarked with the 4ists,
'Twas a Saturday afternoon;
Cur loved ones were there to bid us
farewell,
For, many, the time came too soon.
We anchored that night well out in
the Stream,
Next morn at break of day
The anchor was weighed, and our
ship set sail
For a land that was far away.
For a time all went well, till the
heavy swell,
And the wind which became rather
breezy,
Caused the ship to roll, and pretty
well all
Of the men became rather uneasy.
But in a few days when they go their
" sea legs "
The men were pulled up with a jerk,
They found that instead of gazing
around,
They were expected to do some
work.
W.'3 ■ "c "> smooth, the men
simply love
To indulge in the games provided,
But when it is rough they soon/ cry
" Enough,"
All their dash has completely sub-
sided.
Poor wee Sergeant Mac's been a week
on his back,
To be up again he's very happy,
And now once again he's in charge ot
his men,
For he's a most popular chappie.
Our Lieutenant Dower tried all in his
power
With the gloves to create a diver-
sion,
Though the men gamely sparred, suc-
cess it was marred
By the rise and fall of the ocean.
At physical jerks we're becoming ex-
perts,
Though at times the deck's a bit
greasy.
And when the ship dives, the men
slide for their lives,
The order is given " Stand Easy."
Our Sergeant-Major's a cunning old
stager,
On tug-of-war he would go banker,
When nobody's looking, he's quietly
hooking
His end of the rope round the
anchor.
When Hearing first port, the ship's
G.C. thought
The men needed a wash in fresh
water,
Two quarts and a pan were issued
each man,
And the bath we received was a
snorter.
The men were so pleased, some officefs
seized
The chance to obtain a snapshot
Of men in the nude, some thought it
was rude,
While others said " Well, that's
red hot."
K Company's O.C. is as pleased as
can be,
At the conduct his men have shown,
While at the first port he believes that
he ought
To have them christened " Gil-
lingham's Own."
Yet while coming on board, but, of
course, " Mum's " the word,
I've been told 'twas a Cambridge
Rooster,
Much to his chagrin, very nearly fell
in,
But still he crows just like he used
to.
And our Corporal McDonnough's a
regular stunner,
While ashore he would have a good
time,
When last he was seen he was with his
dear Queenie,
He paraded next morning at nine.
And now I have come to my very last
verse,
And told you the things I have seen,
I am handing this in to the censor in
hope
'Twill appear in the ship's maga-
zine.
W.E.C.
Over the Counter.
Jerry was one of the best and most
consistent of the Canteen's Customers,
but invariably called to make his pur-
chases after regular hours.
He had the usual excuses—"he was
mess orderly," "had been on guard,"
or " wished some refreshment for a
sick mate," until one night he strolled
along 15 minutes after closing time.
His luck was out, for the " head
serang" was in the Store counting up
the " daily loot." Jerry was up
against it this time ! Surely his old
gags were "washed out."
He had never struck the " boss" be
lore, and he was startled somewhat
when he heard, "Well, what do you
want? You know the Canteen Hours.
Why don't you come in time ?"
But Jerry was equal to the occasion
and in injured tones told of his good
intentions to be early.
" Never having been to the Canteen
before, sir, I lost my way and couldn't
find the place."
Not knowing Jerry's almost daily
visits there, the Officer allowed him
to purchase his " Tobac" with the
advice to be early in future.
The injured and ready excuse was
so full of Mer(r)it that the Officer
failed to "Jerry" to it.

The Vicissitudes of an
Anzac.
It might have been in the air that
night, the ozone might have been
pregnant with memories and hopes,
but we were in a reflective mood as
the frail hues of evening left us gazing
down the trail of churned foam astern.
We tried to live again the past few
months of our existence, those be-
wildering months wherein we donned
khaki, and which had seen the change
from our civilian duties to crossing the
seas, an active participant in this
world war, and we strove to under-
stand the emotions and impressions it
had left us.
The first night aboard flashed clear-
ly back, when we lay in the harbour,
our washing keel lapped by the out-
going tide. Over the water, quiet and
darkness reigned ; around lay the city,
our capital, a vast curving shore of
blazing lights, fading away to the
lamp-lit hills on whose slopes the
friendly gleam of homes awoke the
craving of our hearts.
In the early dawn our engines
started and their throbbing filled us
with a thrill of expectancy. This was
a most definite step in our new life;
henceforth we must live with new
aspirations, changed contentments, and
induce a fresh patience to meet those
inevitable moments of the "blues."
We must cultivate, in addition to the
good fellowship which in practice is
instinctive, good feeling and gener-
osity to each other, and an exterior im-
pervious to " blasts " and petty
troubles.
That evening, as the last of our
land faded behind a solemnity of grey
clouds, we saw Mt. Egmont, her lofty
crags serenely set above the low-skied
East. We wondered what it all
meant. We knew what the past held,
and curiously thought what our future
would give in place. Breathlessly we
recalled those halcyon days while we
slept and war prepared. For those in
city pent it was town comfort, the
circle of friends, the recreations and
oft week-end drives in the country.
For many of us it was a peaceful
rural day, divine reward for labour
nobly given. There was the crisp
morning when "we led, astride our
favourite mount, our dogs afield.
These things filled in the metre of our
days. But now the boat churned
steadily ahead, altering our concep-
tions with every mile; the strain of
intangible bonds gently eased, from
sighs and retrospection we turned to
look ahead.
The fallacy of soldiering, that'of a
distinct sacrificial duty, to be borne
with ameliorating praise and high
idealism, was exposed; a sturdier,
truer view loomed up. The old happy
yet unbroadened idea died in the last
mile; the facts catch. We are getting
down to real values.
The piping times of peace no longer
seem ours by natural right; they are
ours only on strength of assertion.
Nationality is only worth its intrinsic
strength.
And so the individual culture, con-
stitution and liberty of our race rests
primarily on the ability to prove its
claims to self-reliance.
When we understood that the very
foundations of these were threatened
we awoke from the lethargy of pros-
perity and contentment and shed some
of the British apathy, common to the
last century of our history. The
changed psychological view perverts
the whole world of things, our troop-
ship no longer carries us speedily,
relentlessly away, but lazily strolls the
ocean, heaving over billows with a
singularly detached air, disdaining to
share our petty haste.
Long has the Cause called, long has
the battle raged, alternating over the
ruined homes of France and Belgium.
We realise that it is up to us to do
"our bit." No fanciful victory nor
superhuman valour is our obsession.
"Our bit" will be no more than a
moderate " stunt " when unleashed
against the Hun, to do no more than
a thousand determined men can do in
the modern theatre of war.
Onwards our ship steams, bearing its
unit of fighters, of common aims and
determination, in whose mind the
voyage of Troopship 108 will leave a
poignant memory.
S. P.
England.
England by Evil hated long,
England the triumph of my song!
Behold thy sturdy Warriors rise,
For love of England never dies.
They fight and reckon not the cost,
For God receives what we have lost.
Each crimson drop of precious blood
Goes up an offering unto God.
In thy true breast our noblest dust,
In thy good name our faith and trust
Thy warrior son who takes his sleep
Soft cradled in the mighty deep.
He whom we mourn. Lord of Khar-
toum.
0 vast his grave and grand his doom.
The gentle waves that lap our shore
Shall speak of him for evermore.
And foremost in the march of time
Floats England's flag in every clime.
The day that brings our England's
fall
Shall see for earth the end of all.

Canteen.
Our canteen opened on our first day
at sea, and judging by enquiries dur-
ing the whole of the morning as to
whether pork pies, Scotch mixtures,
fancy brands of cigarettes and other
things were in stock, one might have
been excused uttering awful swears—
for there were cases to be found in
the hold—these to bring on deck and
open —and some sort of order to be
evolved from what reminded one of
the first day in a. new house when the
furniture cart lias emptied its con
tents pell-mell into two rooms.
Suffice to say that the newly-made
counter hands dispensed cigarettes, bis-
cuits, lollies and other things which
our soldier men desired eariy in the
afternoon.
The value of the canteen stocks at
the beginning of the voyage was
£1,359 lis, lOd. Business was carried
on for an hour after breakfast, for the
period between morning and afternoon
parades, and from 5 p.m. till 7 p.m.
each evening.
The average dailv sales amounted
to £32, mqst of which was spent in
fresh fruit (while it lasted), biscuits,
lollies, tobacco, tinned fruit, cordials,
etc. On our best day our sales
amounted to £53 10s.
At the first, port of call £5B was ex-
pended, chiefly in fruit, and this lasted
to within a few days of our arrival
at our second port. Everything was
sold at a small fraction above cost
price, and to quote the price of one
item, cigarettes, 20 for 6d., will serve
to show that the soldier paid the
minimum price for his wants.
The canteen serves to fill many a
little gap in the needs of the soldier
while he is at sea, and a word of
praise must be given to the salesmen
who in all weathers kept their sea legs
and "carried on." They sacrificed a
good deal of their own time in the
working of the canteen and did all in
their power always to oblige the boys.
41st Hymn of Hate
My Sundays are duffless,
My Mondays are washless,
My Tuesdays are meatless,
I'm getting more eatless
Each day.
My home it is heatless,
My bed it is sheetless,
They're all sent to the
Y.M.C.A.
The bar-rooms treatless,
My coffee is sWeetless,
Each day I get poorer
And wiser.
My stockings are feetless,
My trousers are seatless,
By gosh, but I do hate
The Kaiser.


' i
In Appreciation of the
N.C.O.
All society is divided into at least
three classes, the high, the middle,
and the low, and this applies to the
Army as to any other body. Indeed
the lines of demarcation are even
more pronounced there than with other
sections of the community, and there
are laws, written and unwritten, gov-
erning these distinctions which are as
unalterable as the laws of the Medes
and Persians. In the first place we
have the commissioned officers, who
sit in high places, and, like Dives of
old, dine sumptuously every day; the
under stratum is composed of the
men, full Privates, with all the rights
and privileges of that rank; whilst
between the two, and occupying an
unenviable position between the upper
and the nether mill-stones are the non-
commissioned officers. One who is
to be accepted as a competent au-
thority has remarked that the back-
bone of the Army is the non-commis-
sioned man, and the truth of this is
borne out by numberless instances
where the fresh young subaltern with
his first command and a weight of
purely theoretical knowledge has had
to lean and lean heavily on the worldly
wisdom, practical experience and
ability to handle men possessed by
his company sergeant-major and pla-
toon sergeants. There is nothing
spectacular about the N.C. 0. At a
march past of troops he does not oc-
cupy the proud position at the head of
the column, nor is he at a review
stationed in front of the Company,
the cynosure of all eyes. Except for
the stripes on his arm and a more
soldierlv set of the shoulders he is not
to be distinguished from the men, and
is overlooked by the uninitiated, but
the N. 0.0. has the gratification of
knowing that the Officers depend upon
him. and the grim satisfaction aroused
by the fact that he is anything but
a negligible quantity to the mpn. Tt.
is not the bestarred young Darling o"f
the Oods—or more appropriately of
the Flappers—who is to be commended
for the even fours of the column as it
swings nast, but the N.C.0.. who
with his unwearving "Left, Right,
Left.- Left.—Left," on many parades
has imbued the men with some of hi.s
own soldierlv spirit. From the time
the raw and uncouth recruit arrives
in camn he is the particular care of
the N.C.0., and that care follows him
through his training up to the time
when, as the finished product of the
parade ground, he first goes into
action. There in the stress of the
fight he hears the well-known voice, of
his Platoon Sergeant, sounding no
different from what it did
on parade, steadying the line and by
force of personality encouraging his
men to endure the strain, until finally
by word and example he lifts them
through the charge that wins the day.
No one but the sergeant himself can
properly gauge the amount of time,
thought and perseverance required to
make a civilian a soldier, yet the
N.C.O. spares none of these. With-
out thought of reward, but because of
his own soldierly spirit and desire to
see his men well turned out, he gives
the best that is in him, and the well-
deserved reputation of the British and
Colonial soldiers proves how good that
best is. Although in some instances
the men consider the name of their
platoon sergeant " Anathema Marana-
tha," this is not the general rule, and
underlying the grumbling at his strict-
ness is a- deep-rooted respect for the
sergeant, born of the knowledge that
he understands his work and is com-
petent to give orders. Off the parade
ground the sei'geant is a very human
individual with a sound knowledge of
the inherent fitness of things and a
Ood-i'iven sense of humour which
Capt. Prictok, Ship's' Adj. & Q.M
helps him to bear with the peculiari-
ties of the slow-witted recruits. Off
parade also he stands " in loco paren-
tis " to his men and is a fountain of
knowledge concerning all matters con-
nected with the Army. He gives good
paternal advice when advice is needed,
and is ready at all times to help any
of his men either in the adjusting of
that Satanic invention—the Mills
Webb Equipment—or the folding of a
military overcoat in the correct man-
ner. It would be unfair to belittle
the ability of the officer above or of
the man below, but the longer one is
attached to the Army the more one is
convinced that the Army without the
N.C.O. would be as invertebrate as a
jelly fish. Finally, to quote the
authority before mentioned :
" Let us now praise noble men
From whose bays we borrow,
They who put aside to-day
All the joys of their to-day
And with toil of their to-day
Bought for us to-morrow."
Camouflage
There is little in life which has not
been changed, even revolutionised, by
war conditions. Our habits of living,
our mode of thought, and our whole
outlook on life have felt the imprint
, of this world conflict. Even our na-
tional vocabulary has not escaped. Dur-
ing these years of war there have
crept into use quite a number of
words which previously were unknown
to us. Contact with our Allies has
been one reason for the adoption of:
these new words, and another reason
has been the necessity of finding names
for the many inventions and devices
which the war has given birth to.
One word which has come into being
so far as our language is concerned as
a result of both these causes is the
word "Camouflage." This is the
name we give to any device which
, serves to disguise the nature and pur-
pose of anything which it is possible
that the enemy may set about investi-
gating. We camouflage our ships by
causing them to present such a variety
and irregularity of colour as to give
the most wily submarine food for
thought. We camouflage our guns by
means of trees and other natural ob-
jects which tend to make their em-
placements indistinguishable from the
country around. We camouflage our
trenches, too, by many devices the
object of which is to obliterate thein
from the eagle eyes of enemy planes.
And so the principal of camouflage is
carried out wherever possible.
But it is not of these more obvious
modes of camouflage that we wish to
speak. Though the name be new and
born of the war, the device itself is
old. Have you ever thought how
much camouflage there is about our
everyday life ? There is an old adage
which warns us against judging by
appearances ! And why ? Because too
often what is apparent on the surface
is merely a disguise, consciously or un-
consciously assumed, to hide the deeper
realities. We cannot get away from
camouflage. It is woman's great ally.
Let her imagine ever so slight a flaw
in her share of Nature's gifts and she
immediately takes refuge in camou-
flage. She paints, powders, or visits
her dressmaker in her endeavour to
secure a suitable camouflage. Many
are the camouflaging devices which
she brings to bear upon the opposite
sex to work her way with them.
Sometimes she is coy, sometimes hy-
sterical, then deucedly obstinate, then
loving and repentant, until at last she
is so perfectly unnatural that the
enemy is decidedly puzzled and finally
withdraws from the field—another
victim of camouflage.
But it is in affairs of the heart that
we camouflage most. The English
race is notoriously reticent about its
deeper feelings, and hides them under
a veneer of convention and respecta-
bility which it is often difficult, if
not impossible, to penetrate. If we


. ,, I.,., yy,
]
'i<s0 am **i-. al.
ys
are happy, we allow only a considered
portion of that happiness to escape to
the surface; if .we are miserable, ,we en-
deavour to hide the fact by a. camou-
flage of smiles and cheerfulness; if
we love, we are careful that the fact
is not manifested in outward action :
if we . are poor, we try to assume an
appearance of having plenty; if we
are rich, we make no boast about it,
but. leave it to the curious and the
gossipers to assess our capital and in-
income. Thus do convention and our
innate national reserve form one huge
camouflage over our inner thoughts and
intentions.
And how well camouflaged we sol-
diers are! They call us " Camou-
flaged Civilians," but we do not resent
the title. At heart we , are . still civi-
lians. Our khaki is but a temporary
garb necessitated by present condi
tions, and as soon as the necessity has
gone we shall be happy to lay it aside
and live once more our natural lives.
We do not grumble or complain, we
do our present job with all our might,
for we realise that duty demands that
all our energies he concentrated on the
speedy ending of the unnatural con-
flict. We suffer our military camou-
flage, only as a means to this great
end. Our feelings, too, are camou-
flaged. We hide our thoughts about
tbe war under a camouflage of silence.
Though the war is close to the heart
of all of us, we rarely talk about it.
We are in the business to do. and talk-
ing doesn't heln matters. We rarely
discuss the war at all. There is prob-
ably no place in the wide world where
the war is mentioned less than where
trooos congregate, whether it be in
camp or on troopsh'p. War news con-
cerns us but little. We have had
hardly a word of war news for a
month now—but we scarcely miss it.
Rut this indifference is only a camou-
flage. The war really means more
to us than we can tell. We have em-
barked on an enterprise which our
honour and pledged word demand we.
shall not quit before we have achieved
what we set out to accomplish, and
our hearts are in the business. Then
the end of the war will mean for all
of us the liuking-up of innumerable
ties of love and friendship which for
the time have been oruellv and re-
lentlessly broken. This again makes
the war a burning question to us.
Still, as I said, we don't discuss it,
because discussion brings us no nearer
the end. May the . time soon come
when the bells of peace shall call us
to cast off this camouflage of life and
thought, and allow us to be our nat-
ural selves once more. . .
A soldier ,on a. troopship, writing to
his " girl " on a moonlight night, said :
"Here's a beautiful moonlight night
and a. ship full of soldiers- going to
was.te,";
The Chronicle of the
Forty-Firsts.
Ye Great War having now lasted close
on the space of four years a message
from our Lord the National Govern-
ment of the land of New Zealand
came unto the men of the 41st draft
of antipodean warriors saying : " Be-
hold, we shall gather you together
into an encampment at the place which
is called Trentham. Here shall ye
form fours, slope ' hipe,' and assault
bags with your bayonets until such
time as ye are fit and made fat on the
free food which we shall give ye."
Then it came to pass that our Lord
did say to his faithful servant the
Camp Commandant of Trentham :
" Give command unto the men of the
41st that they take ship and sail unto
the land where are done the mighty
deeds, of valour."
LIEUT. HARPER. Editor.
And, lo ! it came to pass that a ser-
vant of the Lord's servant spake unto
the 41st men assembled, saying:
" These are the commandments which
my Lord giveth thee and which ye
shall obey. Ye shall pack both your
camp kits and your sea kits and go
down to the village of Wellington,
which is by the sea-coast. Ye must
keep within the barrier, lest ye be
carried away with the sorrows of de-
parture and the girl with the glad eye.
Ye shall not give yourselves over to
the temptations of the wine-iar, for
I say unto you he who boozeth much
shall surely lose the use of his legs
or of his head or of both.
" Again I say unto ye, be strong of
will and do not make thyself cheap
unto- the strange women of the places
ye visit. If a girl maketh the right
eye glad, thou shalt smile back and
say ' How are you?' but if she
winketh the left eye, pass her by, even
though she say pretty things to thee.
She shall surely dance with thee and
sit upon thy knee and do many things
which the servant of the Lord warneth
thee of. Thou shalt do battle in the
distant land against the mighty hosts
of the Huns who seek to despoil all
places of the earth. Ye shall use the
rifle and the bayonet and the bomb
also freely. I beseech each of you
hold not the bomb a long space in thy
hand lest thou lose thy hand and cause
a great mess in the place where thou
hast stood."
So it came to pass that on a frosty
Saturday morning the 41st arose be-
fore cock-crow and. according to the
commandment, wended their way to
the side of the mighty ship which, was
to bear them to the promised land of
the Hun. On the morrow as the sun
rose the great ship sailed and left far
behind the land yclept "God's own
country." and. lo! the waters were on
the right and the left and on everv
side, arid there was not any roughness
on its surface.
Then the dav gave way to darkness,
and most of the Warriors arose, and
a mighty rush was mad p to the side of
the ship, for the shin did heave, and
those within her did heave within
themselves, and many cried to the
fishes below. " 800-ah," "800-ab."
arid the sound came from the port and
from the starboard. On the morrow
the deck was strewed with warriors
who were not cheerful, and who could
not eat the food that was offered them.
Then the fronhet which sailed in
the ship spake unto the men. givng
them many commandments and said :
" t! ve break these laws which T -rive
thee ye shall surelv taste of the hor-
rors of Clink and run whenever ve
hear the sound of the trumpet. But.
if ve keen the Commandments ve
sh°U be fed. year, three timec daily,
and when the snn goeth down ve
shall sleep in the hammocks, which
swing above the mess tables."
" Again I sav to you ve shell pot
kw■ t,l pnwfdes to thv women-folk, nor
the kinsmen, except T the Bronhet
shall read what ve have written. V{s
must not write the name of the shin.
P"r complain of the food, nor sneak
of thv Officers " Then the men mur-
mured much, for ell the words they
contd write were " How are ym I "
And it came to pass that, the ship
came to the land of the Ossies, and
the men of the 41st were glad and
sang,, arid did hakas and cake-walks,
yea even did throw hand springs. But
soon a sadness came upovi many, for
the Scribes of the land brought word
that the Bubs, were closed.
Now when the men of the 41sts had
become weary with merry-making they
came back to the wharf. And I heard
a voice in the darkness cry, "Stand
still, that man": yet, another cried.
"Not a move there." And as I
walked, the road came up to meet my
foot, and T stepped high; and some

there were who did the goose step
after the manner of the Huns. About
the hour of midnight the men did go
aboard the ship, and as the sun rose
we left the land and sailed the seas
for many days.
A MESSER,
The "Ulimaroa" and a little
Cornflour.
What is a good sea-boat ? That is
a question !
I used to labour under the delusion
(before I met the " Ulimaroa ") that
it was a boat which rode steadily
through rough seas, but since I have
been informed with great assurance
that the " Ulimaroa" is a good sea
boat, I find that I was wrong in my
diagnosis, for steadiness is not her
strong point—it is a quality in her
hardly visible to the naked eye.
It is agility evidently that makes a
good sea-boat, for that certainly is.
her strong point. For agility she licks
every boat I ever knew clean out of
sight. She has such a variety of
gymnastics, too —on no two consecu-
tive days does she travel in the same
way !
On day number one she rolls gently
to and fro—an empty barrel isn't in
it with her for rolling. Dignity as
befits all ranks is impossible when
neighbours are flung into each others'
arms, or one's meal tries to sit in one's
lap. The breath is held at times,
wondering if our good boat is over for
good, but she decides to try sinking on
her other side, and a neighbour re-
turns the compliment by sitting sud-
denly on top of the erstwhile culprit.
Next day, number two, she is un-
able to decide whether to take to the
air or to the bottom of the sea, when
things are not much more pleasant for
her unfortunate passengers.
But day number three beats pre-
vious records, for she combines rolling
and pitching into a heavenly circular
movement that is evidently most
soothing to all but those with ostrich-
like stomachs, for all retire to bed and
sleep.
Then last in the repertoire is a
jumping-on-an-even-keel movement,
after which she comes down again
with a bang and shakes herself like a
wet hen.
Should any one fail fully to appre-
ciate the "Ulimaroa," let them (try
to) make blanc-mange in an enamel
basin on a primus lamp on one of: the
rolling days.
One starts gaily off with visions of
grateful patients eating delicious
blanc-mange for lunch. Armed with
condensed milk, cornflour and uten-
sils, one scorns the Sergeant's offers of
assistance.
The primus is anchored safely—not
so the basin, unfortunately, which
promptly does its best to slide off. So
one requisitions another assistant to
hold it while the milk boils and one
measures out the cornflour. All goes
well for a few minutes, but then,
Whoop! Gently she rolls and some-
one else is needed to hold on to the
milk. The Sergeant-Major arriving to
watch operations, is therefore requi-
sitioned: hut, despite his efforts, he
burns hi.s fingers and the floor gets
a taste of milk. That does not help
any, for row S.-M. finds things slip-
rery at both ends, and the dish
doesn't get any cooler to hold.
At last the milk boils, in goes the
cornflour, and one stirs as vigorously
as one can with one hand, while assist-
ing in the holding on process, trying
at the same time to put not more than
half over the S.-M., who is on the
lower side.
Things get more and more exciting,
the rolling increases, S.-M.'s feet
threaten to desert him, and finally the
saucepan burns and a hot seasick-
feeling crowd gives up in disgust, vow-
ing that, if the patients can't eat the
blanc-mange without grumbling, they
aren't really very ill.
A SISTER.
Our First Concert.
Unfortunately, it is necessary to
make apologies regarding this, our
first concert aboard. The clerk of the
weather has been none too favourable
to us, so, after several postponements,
we at last " put it on " in spite of
him. The eventful day, August 15th,
saw a large and appreciative audience
assemble round No. 2 Hold, and, to
satisfy all tastes, a varied programme
of good talent was produced. No 2
Hold is not the best place in the
world in which to hold concerts, and
it is still more unfavourable when
lighting restrictions are rigidly en-
forced. However, the best was made
of a "bad job," and a good concert
resulted.
L./Cpl. Moody "broke the ice"
with a spirited pianoforte solo,
"Grande Valse." Those who know
Moody will say that he is always up
to form, and he was certainly at his
best for our first. A further word of
praise is due to him for acting as ac-
companist, this onerous duty being
performed efficiently and weli.
Sergt. Carson, of " H" Coy., has
a fine voice, and he used it to full
advantage in his rendering of
"Thora." We wish to hear more of
the Sergeant, and shall certainly use
him at future concerts.
Breaking off now to something of.
lighter strain, I wish to make refer-
ence to Lieut. Harper and Pte. Lynch.
The former gave us a characteristic
rendering from " Ginger Mick " —a
piece entitled "War." Given in its
true style, it was good to hear, and
it is no wonder that we called for
more.
Lynch appealed to the humorous
side by giving a parody on the "Vil-
lage Blacksmith."
For a more serious type of recita-
tion, Sgt.-Major Paterson, of "H "
Coy., rendered " The Man from
Snowy River."
Pte. Roddin is a talented imitator
and impersonator. He favoured the
audience with an imitation of the
various sounds attached to a journey
into the country, introducing such
things as the barking of dogs, result-
ing in the inevitable dog fight; the
bleating of sheep ; neighing of horses,
etc.—altogether 'a very welcome de-
parture when one is very much on the
briny.
It is to be hoped that by the time
our next concert takes place there
will be some improvement in weather
conditions, so that more enjoyable
evenings both to performers and
audiences will result. Our orchestra
and quartette party have yet to make
their appearance. Needless to say, we
are all looking forward to their ad-
vent.
Second Concert.
This was held on Saturday, 24th
August. Like its forerunner, it was
well patronised, and a good pro-
gramme presented to an appreciative
audience.
The chief feature of the concert was
the appearance of the ship's orchestra,
consisting of three violins, two
clarionets, a trombone, and piano.
Later we hope to add to the combina-
tion so as to bring our strength up
to ten players. Even as the orchestra
is now constituted, it is to be con-
gratulated on the skill and ability dis-
played in its rendering of the various
orchestral items of the programme.
Amongst the other performers, Pte.
Webb, of "F " Coy., was particularly
prominent. Dressed in stage attire,
he gave us a character impersonation,
entitled "A Voyage of Disaster."
Webb has a happy knack of appealing
to his audience, and this, together
with his fine interpretation, made his
contribution undoubtedly good.
The ship's Padre "came to light"
with some interesting matter in con-
nection with four short essays. One
these, entitled " The Army Nurse,"
called for a good deal of m'erriment,
particularly as we have a party of the
N.Z.A.N.S. aboard with us. This
essay is reproduced elsewhere in this
issue.
The concert was appreciated more
than the previous one, for it was held
m daylight. The weather conditions
were much more favourable and the
programme rendered was even a bet-
ter one than at the previous concert.

" Man proposes and —and so it
is with all forms of entertainment on
board ship.
It was intended to hold our first
Sports Meeting on the afternoon of
Saturday, 17th August, but Father
Neptune had placed the wild waters
in such an uproar that a postponement
was unavoidable. The following Thurs-
day afternoon was then chosen for the
eventful day, and this time kind for-
tune smiled more favourably on us.
The programme for the meeting was
as follows :
1. Physical Drill. Teams of 10 men
'and 1 N.C.O.
2. Tug-of-war. Teams of 5 men and
a coach.
3. Obstacle race. .
4. Spar Boxing.
5. Cock-fighting.
6. Quoit throwing.
As at a previous meeting in camp
at Tauherenikau, championship points
were alloted to the winners of the
various events and were as follows :
Physical drill 10, 7, 5, 3; Tug-of-
war 7, ,4; for the Obstacle race, Cock-
fighting, Spar boxing and Quoit throw-
ing, 5 points were given for first and 3
for second.
The sports which were commenced
in the forecastle head could not all be
run off on Thursday, and the following
Saturday afternoon was taken for the
completion of the programme. The
Physical Drill competition called forth
6 teams all evenly matched. Judging
f)sm the excellent display all the
teams must have put in much time in
training. No one was surprised when
after all the teams had gone'through
the judges found it necessary to recall
two teams, G1 and El. These two
then contested for the first place, - G1
being placed Ist with 28 points and
El second, with 27 points. The points
as awarded by the Judge—Captain
Short—may be of interest :
Team. Total points.

The tug-of-war was the next item.
Instead of the straight pull the rope
was put through a block and both
teams faced the same way. This did
away with any advantage one team
might gain over the other by the move-
ment of the ship. F Coy's first team
and G Coy's second team were the
first contestants : a very even pull re-
sulted. F Coy. gained the decision
after a 14-minute pull. The next
teams, E2 and HI, had a splendid
tussle for 18 minutes. After 10 min-
utes it looked as if HI would win, but
their opponents made a great effort,
and gradually worked the rope
through. The other two pulls also
proved exciting. El defeated F2,
and G1 defeated H2. This left Fl,
E2, El and G1 in the semi-final. The
quoit throwing competition was next
on the boards, but for some reason
none of the competitors showed
marked skill. Pte. Callinan of H
Cov. was first, and Pte. Roddin of
G Coy. was second. A start was then
made with spar boxing. A spar was
suspended about 4ft. above the deck,
noon which two competitors had to
sit. Each man then tried to dislodge
the other by assaulting each other with
pillows. Supporters of the Darwinian
theory must have been mightily
pleased with the display. Some of the
competitors showed more than ordinary
skill in clinging to the spar after losing
their equilibrium. Out, of 28 com-
petitors the final was fought out be-
tween two representatives of F Coy.,
Corpl. Corby and Pte. McGuire. The
latter showed more of the tree-climb-
ing tendency than Corbv, and received
the 5 points for the Company. The
remaining events were left over for
the Saturday afternoon. F and G
Companies each gained 13 points, E
9, and H 7.
The competitions were renewed the
following Saturday afternoon (August
24th) on the boat deck. A start was
made with the semi-final of the tug-
of-war, the first pair matched
being F 1 and E2. The length
of pull had been considerably
shortened after our last experi-
ence, and this no doubt account-
ed for the short time occupied
in Saturday s contests. F 1 very
quickly brought their weight to bear—
their coach being of invaluable assist-
ance. G 1 had a popular win over
E l after an even pull. The final was
. over ""til after the obstacle race.
Ibis provided 35 competitors, and
was run off in heats. The competi-
tors were required to lie "on the
back down" with unlaced shoes at
their heads. On the word "Go"
they had to put on and lace up their
shoes, crawl under a cargo net spread
taut over the deck, run round to the
starboard iside, get into sacks, and
finish as in a sack race. Much amuse-
ment was caused by the antics of the
competitors m negotiating the cargo
net. Many got their heads through
the meshes and struggled in
vain to free themselves. Perhaps
tne most comical incident was when
an over-ardent athlete who had un-
fortunately got his braces tangled in
the ropes valiantly endeavoured to
drag after him cargo net, deck fittings
and boat deck—attached to the back of
his trousers. The final provided a
good race. Pte. Underwood, of G
Coy received a round of applause as
he breasted the tape. Pte. Picton,
ot E Coy., was second. The final of
the tug-of-war caused a general buzz
ot excitement, which grew into hoarse
cheers and husky words of encourage-
ment as the contestants struggled with
the rope. This again gave place to a
prolonged burst of cheering on the
part of the members of F Coy. as
their team took charge and after a good
pull landed the seven points. An ex-
perienced coach is an invaluable aid to
a team, and F Coy. had this advan-
tage.
, 13 , °/ the cock-fighting
brought forward, two trussed-up com-
petitors. On the word " go" they
moved into the centre of their 10-ft
ring and tried to push each other out!
I his competition broug l l forward 30
competitors and some very comical
combats were witnessed. The final
was contested by Pte. Picton and Pte.
Candy, both of E Coy. The points
now stood with G Coy. 22 and F Coy.
20, so that had F Coy's representative
got in the final his company would
win the Championship points, even if
E Coy. were first and second they
could not beat G Coy. Unfortunately
for F, Parsons found his opponent,
Picton, too strong, and with his exit
from the ring in the semi-final F Coy's
last hope had gone. Candy eventu-
ally won the competition.
The company championship results
were
C Cov 22 points.
® Coy 20 points.

Boxing.
Notice of a boxing tournament was
put through routine orders shortly
after the first announcement of the
sports. Owing to the postponement
of the sports, combined with the after-
effects of vaccination, it was impos-
sible to carry out the tournament be-
fore the publication of the magazine.
This is to be regretted, but the tourna-
ment will be held on the first oppor-
tunity after leaving our second port.
Sunday at Sea.
We have had Church Services each
Sunday, but how different they are
from the services in our own parishes
in beloved N.Z. ! Some troops, while
in the army, have been to " church "
more than ever they did in New
Zealand before joining up; while
others, again, miss the familiar forms
of service, with their rhythm and ap-
pointments. But for all that, we en-
joy the Church Parades; they are help-
ful and just what we need. Each
Sunday morning there is an early Cele-
bration of Holy Communion; at 10
o'clock we have Church Parade, which
is held on the open deck. Our Padre,
who has completed four years' Active
Service, uses a Form of Service which
is based on past experience in the
field, and in it the C. of E. form of
service is adopted with simple rubrics
for the use of those who are not
familiar with the Prayer Book, while,
at the same time, adhering to the
forms the C. of E. communicant knows
so well. The hymns are well known,
and all join in heartily; the Padre's
"talks" are brief and to the point.
The whole service lasts only half an
hour, but we enjoy it. A second Cele-
bration is held immediately after-
wards.
In the afternoon we have a Class of
Instruction, and are having a course
on Church History which is very in-
teresting. And of our evening service,
who shall rightly describe it! Im-
mediately after tea, we gather round
the piano on the deck, and, led off
by the Padre, we choose and sing our
own familiar hymns. It is something
to remember to hear hundreds of our
men lustily singing the old familiar
hvmns, and they bring back memories
of happy Sunday evenings at home.
Then we have a prayer for our loved
ones so far away; and, as the day-
light fades away so that we cannot
see the words in the books, we close
by singing, "Abide with me." We
have sung about eighteen hymns, and
this seems to form a fitting close to
aftother happy day.
On Sunday, August 4th, we had a
special form of service for the fourth
anniversary of our entrance into the
war. This form was based on the
service that would be used in West-
minster Abbey. The troops were per-
mitted to keep their copy of the Ser-
vise Booklet as a souvenir, and several
copies have been sent back to N.Z.
We also received bv wireless the fol-
lowing message from Mr. Lloyd
George :
A Message to all from the Prime
Minister of England.
" The Message which I send to the
people of the British Empire on the
THE PADRE (REV. BUSH-KING.)
4th anniversary of their entry into
the war for no selfish ends. We are
in it to recover Freedom for the Na-
tions which have been brutally at-
tacked and despoiled, an'u to prove
that no people, however powerful, can
surrender itself to the lawless ambi-
tions of Militarism, therewith meeting
Retribution, swift, certain and dis-
astrous at the hands of the Free Na-
tions of the World. To stop short of
victory or this cause would compro-
mise the future of Mankind.
" I say ' Hold Fast,' for the pros-
pects of victory have never been so
bright as they are to-day. Six months
ago the ruler of Germany deliberately
rejected the iust and reasonable settle-
ment proposed by the Allies, throw-
ing aside the mask of moderation.
They partitioned Russia, enslaved Rou-
mania, and attempted to seize supreme
power by overthrowing the Allies in
a final desperate attempt. Thanks
to the invincible bravery of the Allied
Armies, it is now evident to all that
the dream of Universal Conquest for
the sake of which they wanted to pro-
long the War can never be fulfilled ;
but the battle is not yet won; the
great autocracy of Prussia will still
endeavour by violence and guile to
avoid defeat, and so give Militarism a
new lease of life. We can never seek
to escape the horrors of War for our-
selves by laying them up for our chil-
dren. Having set our hands to the
task we must see it through till a just
and lasting settlement is achieved. In
no other way can we secure a World
set free from war. 4 Hold Fast.'"
A Reverie.
I have been standing on the prome-
nade deck, watching the black water
swirl by, and admiring the wonderful
enects caused by the play of phos-
phorescent light in the water. And
as I look behind us, and note the
trail of smoke which points to, what
is for most of us, the land of our
birth and upbringing, many thoughts
pass through my mind.
We are now some time embarked
upon our journey to —well, we do not
know our present destination —but ul-
timatelv to take part in that colossal
struggle which is at present working-
such great changes in the map of Eu-
rope. We have, among our number,
men of all ages, classes and ranks;
the first portion of the married men,
some of whom have volunteered be-
fore their time came; the young far-
mer, just getting a start in the
world ; the professional man who has
left a good practice; and the young-
clerk, who ha.s left his immediate
prospects of a career behind him, just
when he was preparing for " the place
higher UP." And as I stand think-
ing, my mind asks for the reason of
these happenings.
The reason will be found in the his-
tory of England, and in the love of
honour and fair play which is the
chief characteristic of the British peo-
ples. Would we, who call ourselves
Britons, be such, if we stood by while
the small nations of Europe were op-
pressed, and the greedy hand of Ger-
many still retained its grasp on Bel-
gium and France?
Would we be Britons if we, by our
neglect, made it possible for England,
and perhaps her fair Colonies, to be
overrun by the hordes of the Hun in
such a manner as befell our gallant
Ally Belgium ?
No ! To my mind the reason is clear
and sufficient. We are going to fight
as our predecessors have don'e, not
only for the peace and safety of the
small countries and dominions, but
for the peace of the entire world.

" Orright."
" Wonder what's on this morning ?"
" Vaccination."
" Does it hurt much?"
" No, mon garcon, not at the time.
It's later on that you begin to feel it."
" Well, I hope he gets it over quick,
anyhow."
Enter Sergeant. " Now then, what's
all the talk about? WHAT ! Still in
bed? No cheek!! Corporal, take
this man's name. Extra fatigue for
you, my lad. You people in the

" What did you do in the Great
War, Bill?"
OAPT. LYONS, O,C. Submarine Guard.
" Mess orderly, my boy."
Enter Orderly Officer : " Any
complaints, men?"
" Yessir, it's the tea."
" Tea, I'll taste it."
(Takes mug and dips in dixie.)
" Very nice tea."
" If you please, Sir, that is the
hot water we're going to wash up
with."
Orderly Officer : " I'll enquire into
it."
Mess Orderly : " Now, you chaps,
this isn't a ' meals at -all hours
show.' No after-dinner speeches;
when you're finished, git."
F OUR — Dormitory.
" Who's pinched my hammock? By
Jove, if I find the beggar who's stolen
it, I'll screw his neck."

Enter Acting Orderly Sergeant.
" Here, cut out the talk over there.
If there's any talking to be done,
I'll do it. Right, listen.

Lady Liverpool Fund and NZ.
Branch of the British Bed Cross.—
The Branches of these Societies have
shown their generosity to us by send-
ing boxes of comforts and extras, and
we have had these at mess : cakes,
milk, jam, honey and fish. These
extras, added to the ship's rations,
have made our Sunday teas " worth
while,", and we tender our sincere
thanks to those who provided them.
We appreciate the generosity and
thought-fulness -shown."
The Q.M.S. Point of View.
In the circumstances of a long sea
voyage there are influences that tend
to prevent one taking things very
seriously. Many a man makes up his
mind to devote enforced leisure to
study or somj. solid reading; few find
it possible to persevere. To the great
majority there conies a feeling of
lassitude, of unreality, almost dream-
like, in which concentration of thought
requires a stupendous effort.
The principal exception to this gen-
eral rule is in the matter of meals,
which three times a day becomes the
most important object of life on board,
with mess orderlies for the nonce the
most important members of the com-
munity. With nearly a thousand men
to be fed in very cramped quarters it
is !by no means easy so to arranga
things that every man shall get his
due ration, and that there shall be no
undue delay.
On the Ulimaroa" all food for
the troops is cooked in one small gal-
ley, whence it is taken by fatigue
parties to the two pantries on the
mess deck for distribution to the
orderlies. Half-an-hour after reveille,
when the hammocks that swung over-
head have been packed away, order-
lies lay the tables for breakfast —and
often re-lay them when an extra lurch
of the vessel sends plates, mugs,
dishes, etc., clattering to port or star-
board. Dixies are taken to the pan-
tries for coffee or tea to be made in
them; bread is brought from the
bakery and distributed to the various
tables; butter, jam, and tea or coffee
are drawn from the pantries. By
this time the rosies containing stew or

dink.... How did you jet out?" I'll tell you" the measles " and BROKE OUT '!
sausages have arrived from .the galley,
and the orderlies—one from each
table—line up with their tin dishes.
As soon as they are all served, " Pick
'em up" is sounded, and down the
companionways troop the .men, who
have been acquiring an appetite in
physical training. About a dozen are
accommodated at each table, and every
man has his allotted place.
When the meal is over, the order-
lies set to work again—washing-up,
scrubbing the tables, forms and floor,
cleaning dixies, polishing cutlery, and
generally making everything spick and
span for "ship's inspection" at 10.30
a.m. Plates, pannikins, dishes, knives,
forks and spoons are displayed on the
tables with an eye to effect and a deal
of ingenuity. There is a strong feel-
ing of emulation as to which table
can make the best show, and con-
sidering the difficulties and the limited
facilities, the results attained are
really surprising.
And surface glitter is by no means
sufficient. When the bugler sounds
" Gee " on the approach of the ship's
captain, accompanied by the Quarter-
master, the Orderly Officer, etc., it is
seen at once that this inspection is no
mere matter of form. Armed with
an electric torch, the " Old Man"
flashes a white light into dark corners,
on the inside of dishes and mugs, even
between the. prongs of the forks,
and, reinforcing sight by touch, passes
a finger around the inside of a dixy
or the rim of a pannikin.
Inspection over, the mess orderies
are free until 11.30, when the earlier
routine is followed for mid-day lunch,
and the "dry rations" are. supple-
mented by milk pudding, stewed fruit,
or "duff." Dinner is at five o'clock,
and comprises meat and vegetables,
bread, butter, jam, and of course, tea.
After every meal utensils, tables, etc.,
are thoroughly cleaned. To any
housewife familiar with providing
even for a large family, it must seem
surprising that meals for over 900 men
can be cooked in a galley not as large
as most domestic kitchens, so it may
be pointed out that potatoes are peeled
and other vegetables prepared by
fatigue parties on the. hatchway out-
side.
In view of the difficulties under
which the work is carried on, com-
plaints are comparatively rare.
"Grousing" is a jealously guarded
privilege, and cannot always be taken
seriously. One morning a sweet-
toothed individual complained that
there was not enough sugar in his
stewed figs! Another indignantly
handed to the Orderly Officer some
apple rings that had been found in
the curry. Improvements are con-
stantly being made, however, and it
is hoped that others will be effected
shortly. Generally speaking, the
men accept with understanding the.
necessary inconveniences of transport
life, and are not slow to see the hu-
morous side of things.
And the saving grace of humour —
more necessary to-day than ever —is
not absent even in these strenuous
times, though occasionally one is
doubtful whether or not it is the un-
conscious variety. For instance, in
the " Manual of Military Cooking and
Dietary," dated 1917, there is a para-
graph headed " Sauces : What to serve
with meat and poultry." The direc-
tions that follow include.: " With
grilled steak, serve mushroom or to-
mato sauce; with roast turkey, apple
sauce or piquant sauce; with pork
cutlets, mustard sauce; with roast
chicken, bread sauce or brown gravy;
with boiled chicken, chestnut or egg
sauce; with roast goose, apple sauce,"
and so on. And the paragraph con-
cludes : " Trained cooks invariably
keep by them the ingredients to make
these sauces." As it is distinctly
stated that the Manual "is only in-
tended for service use," may one hope
that "trained cooks" will be engaged
for transports in future? Then,
perhaps, complaints will cease from
troubling'! and the grumbler be con-
tent.
Just to prevent disappointment,
however, it may be as well to point
out that at present the civilian's share
of the roast beef of Old England is
strictly limited to 12 ounces per week,
and that even a soldier has meat on
his menu only three days out of seven.
A. R, T.
Our Library.
As is well known, New Zealand's
Army is as democratic in character as
any present-day force, and this is
brought to one's notice most forcibly
in the various demands for books at
the Y.M.C.A. Library on board.
One expects, and rightly so, that the
average soldier wishes for nothing more
than a light novel or magazine to pass
away the wearisome hours after drill,
but often the librarian is dumbfounded
by some intellectual-looking person in
khaki who strolls in and in the most
casual manner asks for a copy of Kant
or Homer's Iliad or a Chinese Gram-
mar, or possibly some technical book on
thermostatics or ferro-concrete which
would be quite in place in some large
city library, but obviously rather too
much to expect in a modest 4 ft. x 2 ft.
library such as we have on board.
Others again, noticing the Y.M.C.A.
gifts which include those much disputed
instruments, the "Kazoos," seem sur-
prised when they find that by some
oversight a full brass band was omitted.
Returning to the literary side of the
library, we notice that the class of
literature read by men going to the
front is generally of a higher standard
than that read by men returning. This
is probably due to the unsettled, rest-
less condition of the returning men,
which makes it difficult to settle down
to a good solid book. We have gener-
ally found that magazines or very short
novels are much more in demand on
the home voyage.
Although, as has been indicated above,
the librarian has not been able to meet
all the demands made upon him, it is
pleasing to be able to chronicle the fact
that the library is exceedingly well
patronised, which goes to show that
the efforts of the Y.M.C.A. to collect
books, etc., is not labour in vain.

The Nurse.
A SHORT ESSAY.
The nurse is a noble creature. There
are long nurses and there are short
nurses. The long nurses do not have
to eat so much, because, their food
"goes further." Red is a danger
signal, but read on a nurse is NOT
a sign of danger. The Matron is the
nurses' Sergeant-Major, but she never
tells the nurses to "carry on." That's
all I know about nurses.

The Red Cross Bloke.
Not a blinkin' rap do we care for the
chap
With the Red Cross sign on his
leave.
Till we get to the front on the " stand-
to " stunt,
An' a farewell bomb when you
leave,
'Midst that flyin' death you hold your
breath,
An' life seems suddenly dear,
While the Red Cross chap is out of
the scrap
In the safest part at the rear.
It don't seem fair for him to be there,
While we face the poison an' smoke,
And check the Huns with red-hot
guns
An' cheer, an' curse, an' choke;
But many a lad feels thunderin' glad
When night lends a shelt'rin'
cloak,
To be overhauled by the chap he's
called
The bloomin' Red Cross bloke.
My own turn came—it's part of the
game—
In a scrap we had before Loos,
When the blinkin' Huns tried to
pinch the guns
Of the Fifteenth—never mind whose,
they'd tried an' tried, an' you bet
they'd died,
While we lost many a chum,
Till the word came through, " Now,
lads, stand to,"
An' the next was, " Here they
come!"
We charged an' yelled, an' the line
was held,
But I can't remember the rest.
I<"or the earth spun round an' I hit
the ground
With daylight inside -my chest.
When next I awoke a Red Cross bloke
Was crossing that zone of death,
An' I watched him come through the
shrapnel hum —
Just watched—an' held my breath,
Till he reached my side, with a 1 crawl
an' glide,
An' I blessed his crimson crest,
For he made me snug with a comfv
plug
On the painful hole in my chest.
1 hen away he crept, an' I must have
slept.
For when I awoke with the pain
I was back at the base, as a hospi-
tal case,
An' was booked through to Blighty
again.
We landed all right on a wet, stormy
night,
But what did I care for the rain,
When a Red Cross bloke fixed me
up with a smoke
An' a crib on the Red Cross train.
So that's how I'm here feelin' shaky
an' queer,
In this clinkin' Red Cross bed,
With a Red Cross nurse, when I'm
feelin' worse,
To lay cool things on my .head.
An' all of it seems to be part of my
dreams,
Yet I know that it's not been a
hoax,
For there's thousands to-day who are
ready to say
" Thank God for the Red Cross
blokes."

Sea-sickness.
You are lying on a lee portion of
the deck. Around you a score or more
of comrades in misfortune have
thrown themselves : a twisted,
broken-spirited mass of humanity, ly-
ing in all manners of postures. You
are cold, wet and miserable. You. be-
lieve and know that if there is any
deserving case for the hospital, you
are the one. To your comrades'
groans and complaints you turn a
deaf ear. You glare furiously at the
healthy brutes who time and again
pass between and over you, and you
get a feeling of resentment when your
platoon officer humorously enquires if
you think you are going to die. You
feel you would like to exchange places,
and repeat the question. You are
envious of every living creature that
walks the deck, without quite under-
standing why you feel you have a per-
sonal grievance against everybody from
Kaiser Bill to the steersman of the
ship, and then—oblivion.
The Reticent New
Zealander.
The average New Zealander is very
reticent, and gives little or no demon-
stration of his feelings, and does not
discuss even those things which lie
nearest his interest and well-being.
As a soldier, he accepts what is
done for him largely as a matter of
course. For instance, he accepts the
social provisions made for him as a
right and not as a privilege. He
lopks upon the Regimental Institute
as a right, little thinking that these
are" provided for him by the gener-
osity of those who have his interests
at heart, and by courtesy of the Mili-
tary Authorities; so that instead of
these being a part of his equipment
and training, they are privileges to be
enjoyed and for which he might show
some gratitude.
There is no soldier in the field who
has so much money and time spent
upon his recreation and amusement
and improvement as the N.Z. soldier.
The N.Z.E.F. carries more Chaplains,
S.A. Workers and Y.M.C.A. Secre-
taries than any other force in the
field. But again, there is no soldier
who shows less outward appreciation
than the. N.Z. soldier. Or, again, take
troops on, the march. How jolly and
cheerful the English, Scottish or Irish
troops are on the inarch! , If they
have no hand music, they whistle or
sing, and the singing of these troops
is something to remember. Who ever
saw any of these troops marching along
with the same solemnity as the N.Z.
soldier ? In this note we do not wish
to find fault, we simply tabulate a
fact, hoping to find some solution.
When the N.Z. troops are on the
march in either N.Z. or England or
France, there is very little demon-
stration amongst them, and any effort
to raise a song generally falls " flat,"
after a few minutes of spasmodic effort
by odd sections in the column. This
is quite noticeable when we get abroad
and note the demonstration made by
other troops. We also learn that the,
American troops maintain this tradi-
tion, and only a few days ago we read
in the papers of the wonderful effect
their singing " Onward, Christian Sol-
diers " had on the crowds which lined
the streets of New York.
While recording this peculiar psycho-
logical fact in the New Zealander, we


wonder why. At conferences amongst
the N.Z. troops in convalescent depots
we have discussed this subject, and
asked for some explanation, but it
seems that no one knows " Why?" So
far as his finer feelings are concerned,
his hopes and aspirations, his desires
and religious feelings, he keeps these
entirely under control, so that those
who have his best interests at heart
do not get to find out just what he is
thinking, or the effect of their efforts.
I remember attending a lecture given
by an English lady to some N.Z.
troops in France. The ,hall was
crowded, and the men gave the closest
attention to the lecture. They became
so absorbed in the lecture and showed
such close attention that the lecturer
became unnerved and left the stage
in tears. She marvelled at their rapt
attention, and remarked that they
listened with their eyes as well as
with their ears, and this was more
than she could endure. This unde-
monstrative trait in the New Zealander
makes it a real pleasure to lecture to
him, but on the other hand it
makes the task of the entertainer or
lecturer a very difficult one, because
he does not know whether he has suc-
ceeded in his efforts or not; he can
only guess so by their rapt attention.
To repeat, this trait is peculiar to the
New Zealander, and one of those
things which distinguish him from
the troops from other countries. He
is undemonstrative alike in his friend-
ships and companionships, and gives
little or no indication as to whether
he has any friendships or whether they
are of any real value to him or not.
We think that this trait of reticence
is one of the things which have made
him so "likeable" to the people of
other countries; one of those things
by which he has won his way into
the esteem of the citizens in other
parts of our Empire. But we are not
quite sure that such reticence is good
for our own beloved country. Pro-
bably it is due to this fact, this lack
of self-expression, that we have no
literature of great merit in N.Z.
The Four G's.
At intervals during the day the bugler
gives lip to his bugle and breaks the
calm serenity with four dismal notes
—four G's. No one pays any atten-
tion to the call, with the exception of
an N.C.O. and half a dozen stalwart
warriors armed with that most deadly
of weapons—the broom. They come
together—then disperse, to bring havoc
to stray apple peels and accumulated
litter that gets in remote places. In
short the four G's—" Sweepers "—re-
store our decks to tidiness and order.
A Transport Hospital:
Its Use and Abuse.
Having become aware that the
Great European War was still in pro
gress by the fact of being called up
in a recent ballot, I finu myself a
member of a long-suffering arm of
the service, viz., Medical Corps, due
to the following reasons :
Being a slaugnterman by profession,
and a conscientious objector by per-
suasion, I have the most profound
distaste for the destruction of life,
and the above fact being duly stated
to a sympathetic Military Service
Board, 1 was promptly marked down
as a promising recruit for the " Lin-
seed Lancers."
After a more or less efficient train-
ing at various cook's fatigues in which
I got in some good practice bandag-
ing a leaking dixie, I finally took up
my abode on Transport 108, and was
told off for hospital duties.
Making a brief survey of some 31
beds,* this looked like being a soft job,
but the vision of leisured ease was
only too soon, alas ! woefully shattered
by Sergt. John Bunny, who, in a
short address of some two million
words, detailed several immediate du-
ties ranging from brass polishing to
the preparation of chicken broth
(without chicken) for the consumption
of patients.
For the first day all was calm and
bright, a slight swell on the water
evidently being caused by the move-
ments of innumerable fish underneath
the surface, but the following morn-
ing the scene was entirely changed;
the ship was executing a lively ma-
zurka in two-four time, and patients
were rolling into the hospital in four-
eight time, or some multiple of same.
Now was the chance for the train-
ing to show itself, and it was speedily
found that there was no necessity to
turn up the page in the training man-
ual dealing with emetics, but rather
the one on the subject of improvisa-
tion as applied to containers for the
reception of deleterious undigested
organic matter. Next a most ela-
borate meal was prepared by " Old
Steak-a-de-Oyst " of Italian restaurant
fame, consisting of burnt porridge,
hard potatoes, and partially cooked
fatty beef of doubtful antiquity, this
being considered to be of high calorific
value to exhausted patients.
Strange as it may seem to one not
conversant with the nursing of the
sick, this diet was rejected by every
patient, and an attempt to work it off
on the ship's cat signally failed. A
council of war was then held and re-
source was had to page 361 in the
Training Manual where a fluid diet
of low specific gravity was advised for
sea-sick patients.
In order to counteract any tendency
to reverse peristaltic contractions of
the stomachic cardiac muscles with
consequent regurgitation of the fluid
up the aesophagus, the following nou-
rishing diet was prepared :
Boiling water, 2 gallons; salt, 3
tablespoonfuls; pepper, 2 tablespoon-
fuls; Bovril, teaspoonful.
Result—a most stimulating and tasty
diet, which it was impossible for one
to be boisterously sick upon.
After a day or two, thanks to the
splendid system of dieting and care-
ful nursing and to a smaller extent
to the splendid inherited constitution
of the patient, a marked improvement
was observed on every hand, and it
was deemed advisable to start fat-
tening up the patients. This was done
as follows : The number of beds was
counted, multiplied by three and the
square root extracted—result being
number of light diets required for one
day. This number was entered on
Army Form F.O. 10.001, and after
various signatures and counter-signa-
tures, was presented to the ship's
steward, who handed out a micro-
scopic amount of fish, no doubt being
under the impression that a magician
with marvellous creative ability was
attached to the Medical Corps for
duty. This idea, I might add, was
quite an erroneous one. However,
with these " five loaves and two small
fishes " a well-known biblical incident
was once more repeated, and after the
repast two orderlies were told off with
baskets to go round and gather up the
fragments so that none be wasted, and
the increased rotundity of the said
orderlies testified to their gathering up
abilities, it being noted after this in-
cident that the patients transferred
their wristlet watches to beneath their
pillows.
Of course if a patient comes along
who is obviously not strong enough
for hospital treatment, he is given a
ticket for medicine by the acting
Saw-bones, and numbered, anything
from 1 to 12. For the benefit of the
uninitiated it might be mentioned that
medicine is kept ready prepared in
numbered bottles and information has
been received from a reliable source
—to wit, the Dispenser's Bottle-
washer —that should a patient come
down for a mixture from, say, bottle
No. 10, and this bottle is in need of
replenishment, any inconvenience or
delay is avoided by mixing up a magic
potion from bottles 6 ana 4, or from
any other bottles making up the
required number 10.
It is eloquent, testimony to the
efficiency of this method when, we ob-
serve that there have not yet been any
deaths on board.
Thanks to the efforts of the
Y.M.C.A. Secretary, the convalescent
were well looked after. On one occa-
sion particularly, several cases of
apples were received from this source
and were promptely sampled by
N.C.O. in charge of hospital soup
kitchen, for the presence of Codlin

Moth —by the supreme test of taste,
and with such laborious thoroughness
that scarcely any apples remained for
the patients.
With much regret I have to con-
clude this small treatise as our ver-
bose oracle is sending out S.O.S.
signals for all hands to assemble in
order to have the Ship's Standing
Orders read over to them for the
twenty-ninth time.
IODOFORM.
Pay Books.
A paybook is something distinctly
individual. It reflects to a large ex-
tent the character of the owner. Many
times I have been amused when some
"digger" has been asked to produce
his paybook. He fumbles through one
pocket, sometimes two. Many and
various are the things this pocket may
contain, and the soldier is very fre-
quently like the small boy with his
one trouser pocket which becomes the
receptacle for a conglomerate accumu-
lation.
Some paybooks act as pocket wallets.
They contain the sacred love letters
from the. girl whose boy is in khaki.
They also hold the odd pound notes
for a few days after pay parade. They
become the photo albums and some-
times hold all the other most sacred
documents a man possesses.
The paybook is often carried in the
left breast pocket. This may account
for the assortment that the paybook
holds.
Some paybooks are a joy to the pay
clerk, others are a nightmare. Absence
without leave causes a forfeiture of
pay and so adds to the complexity of
the entry. A pay clerk's brain soon
becomes a mass of complexities. This
no doubt accounts for his unquench-
able thirst—at least that is the un-
happy state of affairs on a troopship
—for the pay office removed from its
commodious office amidships to a
" posse " forward and across the pas-
sage from the canteen.
Allotments, too, are the source of
interest. Every soldier must take an
allotment and to none other than his
wife, or, if unmarried, to his mother,
father, brother, or sister. With the
41sts it is mostly to the wife. A
study of christian names as I write
up the new paybooks makes me pon-
der. I picture to myself what this
chap's wife looks like—whether she
can cook (and wouldn't I give lots to
have one little scone as it comes hot
from the oven), or how she dresses,
entertains, plays the piano, rocks the
cradle.
Then a deficiency in kit or other
forfeitures entailed by a soldier's
naughtiness (I use this word because
when once a soldier, a man becomes
boyish again in many ways), cause the
entry in the paybook to assume a
complex nature.
I live my life aboard among pay-
books—paybooks ever dance before me
waking and sleeping. Every man has
received a new paybook on the boat
and this has cost the maternal Govern-
ment the sum of per book.
We pay clerks have written up the
whole of the books during the voyage.
Do you wonder then that we welcomed
the removal of our quarters to a posi-
tion near the canteen?
Victory.
Comrades, for us the die is cast.
We will arise and strike for good.
We feel the stirring of the blood,
An echo of the distant past.
And, not unmoved, we hear the call.
And pray for strength to stand the
test,
Believing—leave to God the rest,
And triumph even as we fall.
The warrior rests beyond the sun,
The lives of men on earth are free,
The shout of joy shall rise to thee,
The reign of love and peace begun.
We play our little part and go.
Thy servants, Lord, ,do not complain
Of Death and wounds; a little pain,
If we can raise what is so low.
For peace, so long our honoured
guest,
Hath soared away on snowy wing,
And Death,, instead of Love, is king,
And war hath broken on our rest.
O, shall we be of lesser faith
Than those who bore the fight so long ;
Whose lips have sung the battle song.
Who chant of Victory in Death.
So we who come from far away,
With knowledge in our breast and
brow,
That though our lives be broken now,
Death then becomes eternal day.
A peace will come unknown before;
One great glad shout ascends the
skies,
For Mars is down, no more to rise,
And Death the reaper reaps no more.

From the Sockburn Flying School.
We're in the air, without a care,
Don't worry —that's our rule;

The Sergeants' Mess.
We had heard great accounts of the
excellence of a Sergeants'-Mess aboard
ship, but experience at our first few
meals caused us to believe that we had
been grievously misled.
But order quickly appeared out of
chaos; waiters were manufactured in
a few hours, mess equipment was ob-
tained, the genial Captain Prictor
chipped in and helped to obtain greater
comfort, and soon all was running
smoothly, with "no complaints."
The Mess-Room is quite large enough
to seat everybody—that is, if only half
go in at a time. During the first ten
days of the voyage it was particularly
noticeable that there was plenty of
room, some of the fellows having head-
aches, and, also, not caring to spoil
their new shoes by walking on the wet
decks from their bunks to the Mess-
Room.
Eventually, however, the expressions
on the various faces became less un-
certain, and the knives and forks were
plied mterrily despite the pitchings and
tossings.
A Mess Fund having been estab-
lished, much good cheer was purchased
at the first port of call, and although
some loss of dignity resulted when one
member of the Mess carried a kerosene
tin full of eggs along the main street
in the, evening, he stuck to his task
manfully despite all the rude, and
frequently embarrassing, remarks, pas-
sed by persons of the baser sort, and
the eggs were greatly appreciated dur-
ing the following week.
The evenings in the Mess are par-
ticularly pleasant, the Debating So-
ciety which meets there doing its best
to encourage and answer questions.
The following extracts from the dia-
logues which take place will serve to
show that the proceedings are intricate
and mysterious to the ignorant out-
sider :—" You can't do that." " See
you." " What've you got?" "Three
dogs." "All pink." "Full." " Un-
natural's right."
And thus the evenings bowl merrily
along.
A merry lot, the Sergeants, and all
quite convinced that they bear heavy
burdens of responsibility. But this
does not appear to affect their appe-
tites.
The success of the mess is largely
due to the efforts of the genial Presi-
dent, Sergeant Harris, who with his
well-known delicate, yet firm, touch
keeps everything running smoothly.

" Physical Jerks " on a
Transport.
The name " Physical Jerks " is one
given in camp to Physical Drill, and
one can, now, only conclude that the
soldier who coined the term must, at
some time in his career, have taken
part in the drill at sea.
The exercises are most certainly
"jerks" when performed 011 the neav-
ing deck of a transport. The com-
mand "Fall in" is, in a number of
cases, merely a signal for some poor
unfortunates to do a variety of glides
—not always in the desired direction.
The command " Shun " is followed by
all manner of twisting and wriggling
in order to attain a position somewhat
approaching a correct military stan-
dard. This position finally attained,
the exercises are commenced. The In-
structor gives a sharp command and
promptly grabs the nearest fixture,
while the class, after a convulsive
effort, puts the order into effect in a
way that would make the green band
on the cap of the Chief Instructor at
Trentham turn a sickly yellow.
The men thoroughly enjoy the work,
and it is really their only means of
keeping fit. Only a few of the exer-
cises are really possible on' ordinary
occasions, although there have been
some days when the sea was a flat
calm on which almost all except the
balance exercises are capable of quite
decent performance. Other days when
the sea is lumpy the instructor is left
with the whole parade area to himself,
while his class slides giddily and un-
gracefully to the nearest permanent
object—in fact half the exercise is con-
tained in trying to keep upright long
enough and to do enough of the exer-
cise ordered to enable the instructor to
Hatter himself that his class is actu-
ally trying to carry out his com-
mands.
Yes, the man who named it " Physi-
cal Jerks " either had the foresight of
a genius or had prior experience.

We have a Sergeant called Revell,
And for drill he's a regular devil,
If bath parade you drop,
Then your leave he will stop,
That is the way he gets level.
We've a Sergeant who's name starts
with Mac,
Of fatigues he's no end of a stack,
And fellows who stroll
Down No. 2 " Glory Hole,"
Very quickly have Mac on their
track.
We've a Sub, whose name we won't
mention,
Although it would cause no dissension.
When he wants you to hear,
Says, " You people in rear,
Come here : Set? Now pay attention."
V. H. Sanson, our gallant Comman
der,
To fashion is e'er known to pander'.
When the Orders say " Shorts,"
Then in them he disports,
And out on parade does meander.
Bill Stocks, 23's chief prize-fighter,
Is sure he has never been lighter,
For he takes a good fill
Of the physical drill,
And says "I have never felt
brighter."
We've an excellent Corporal named
Sim,
An example of vigour and vim,
A New Zealander bold,
But it's whispered, I'm told,
It's the " Stars " and " Stripes "
troubling him.
Brother Duffy our prize gormandiser,
Is really an awful surpriser,
For breakfast he'll bowl
Through five eggs and a roll,
And then say " Pray, where is my
kai, Sir?"
" S.M." D. of " F " Company fame,
Is up to all parts of the game.
He is never afraid
If you're late on parade,
To say, " Corporal, take that man's
name."

" H " Company.
H Company was originally D Com-
pany of the Fortieths, but as only four
companies of that reinforcement were
set down to sail, D Company was left,
becoming on July 12th, H 41. The
draft, which consisted almost entirely
of Auckland men, came into Tren-
tham on May 3rd, and r while in
Canvas Camp Heretaunga were singu-
larly fortunate as regards weather.
The good weather conditions enabled
the officers and non-commissioned
officers, under supervision of the camp
staff, to start the men off with a good
elementary training.
To make room for an in-coming
draft, the Fortieths removed to
Featherston, where the men enjoyed
the added comforts of living in hut-
ments, and where training, more or
less interrupted by broken weather,
was continued. Then came a fort-
night of final leave, doubly enjoyable
because of glorious weather. Almost
immediately on return from leave, the
Company went back by rail to Tren-
tham, where training, and in particu-
lar, musketry, was continued.
In the Fortieth Reinforcement
sports, although a good team of sprin-
ters and distance men had been got
together, and would have taken a lot
of" beating, the only items contested
were the cross-country run and the
physical drill contest. In the run we
not only supplied the first man home,
but also the first officer—our then
O.C.
Again, in the physical drill com-
petition, our team was first by a fair
margin of points.
A gloom was cast over the Company
by the death of our cheery little
Bugler Dash. His comrades sent a
wreath and subscribed an amount to
have erected a suitable memorial.
Just prior to embarkation the then
0.C., Mr. Forgie, was told he was not
to sail with his Company. Needless
to say he was disappointed, and his
disappointment was shared by all who
were under his command. The com-
mand then devolved' on Mr. Haydon,
and his efficiency in that capacity
leaves little to be desired. Here we
may say that the Company has the
distinction of being officered by re-
turned soldiers, men who have the
actual experience of a battlefield to
guide them, both in dealing with and
instructing men. Mr. Haydon is an
officer who, with the 0.M.R., saw ser-
vice in Gallipoli and subsequently
with the Infantry on the Western
Front.
Mr. Street also has seen service on
two fronts. He went to Gallipoli
with the main body, then to France,
afterwards studied at Cambridge, anil
earned his commission. It is good
to see his genial countenance poking
round corners to look after the well-
being of his men.
The efficiency of the company was
due in no small measure to the fact
that the non-commissioned officers
were, with few exceptions, experi-
enced. Nearly all had assisted in
the training of some previous rein-
forcement, and had been all along re-
cognised as a strong combination, par-
ticularly Platoon Sergeants Harris,
Brown, Carline and Wilson, with Com-
pany Sergeant-Major Paterson ever
alert to see that N.C.O.'s and men
are doing their job.
Then, too, we have R.S.M. Farrell
attached, and ready to lend a hand
when opportunity offers, while Quar-
termaster Poynter watches that short-
ages in equipment are rectified.
Of Sports connected with the Camp,
we had boxing winners in Privates
Porteous and Gillam, small but good
exponents of the gentle art.
Then, too, as members of the Trent-
ham Camp teams, Sergeant Martin kept
up the Company's honour on the
Hockey field, while C.S.M. Paterson
did likewise in the Rugby game.
Of the rest of the Company we have
good musical talent in Sergt. Carson,
Lance-Corn]. Woolley, Privates o'-
Donnell, Cannell, and Cottell.
Then again we have as sources of
geniality, Foley's cheerful smile and
Bennett's Burley presence. There
are others quite as worthy of note,
so taken all in all. we have a Com-
pany full of vitality, which we hope"
when the time comes will give a good
account of itself.

H.M.N.
" Don'ts " for Officers and
N.C.O.'s.
Don't talk shop at mess; it annoys
your neighbour and does not
impress anyone.
~ allow the men to wear bala-
clavas on parade— you do not
have to pay for the hats that
are lost overboard.
" fail to thoroughly inspect all
the mess tables and gear —-
the inspection of the food
supplied need be only a
secondary consideration.
" imagine that you are the only
man on the boat—some other
fool might have the same idea
of himself, and a clash would
be inevitable.
~ take any notice if the men sug-
gest that the cooking condi-
tions are somewhat unclean—
it is a soldier's privilege to
grouse, and there is never
anything in his complaint.
The Critics.
[Though we showed due regard
to the feelings of those who con-
tributed to our little magazine, a great
deal of merciless cutting was needed.
Verses of all kinds—of every metre,
known and unknown —were submitted.
Themes for verses were even more
varied. Every little incident, whether
sentimental, serious, humorous, pa-
thetic or burlesque, ga'e birth to
ideas expressed in verse. There were
sheaves of it—a harvest to make one
glad when one realised that an en-
thusiastic spirit prompted much of it.
But all are not born poets, and those
whose first attempts were made on our
troopship we hope will blossom forth
subsequently with more success—with
ardour not dampened at their initial
failure to capture space for their
attempts.—Ed.]

SOME, OF OUR HONE-SICK POETS AT WORK
The Censor.
jjWe generally think of him as
singular, but latest advices indicate
that there be many, and even aboard
a 'troopship quite a bevy. He is not
so dreadful when one remembers that
the contents ef one's letters "are not
made public property, but treated as
sacred between the sender and re-
ceiver. To the Censor, as he reads,
nothing is of interest except the name
of the ship and any particulars re-
garding troops on board, ports of call
and the route taken. He simply spots
oujt the forbidden ' topics and lets all
else go. The precaution of censoring
is \ necessary not only, for the safety
of j those aboard the ship, but also
for ttye' safety of subsequent*' drafts,
for there'ate a thousand and one: ways
in wlpcji infqrmsttion innocently trans-
mitted, may r£ach the enemy in
transit. ; v -
I 3 ;
To the Censor what matters it how
you spell-r-whether you spell " censor "
" denser," or " news " " nuse." Of
course, if you spell badly,, the Censor
may fancy you are sending a message
in code and the word be blotted out.
Again, your grammar and ybur con-
structibn of sentences are passed over
by the ".Soldier's Despair." Even
slang, when that slang is within the
vocabulary of the Censor, goes.
:
Don't then make it an excuse for
not; writing that we have in our midst
" a] person unknown, mysterious, un-
fathomable. who knows no rules, save
those which his own moods or eccen-
tricities dictate," who is at one and
the same time " an ardent reader,
the delight of the War Office, the
despair of the soldier, civilian, and
journalist."
In conclusion,- there are heaps of
things to write with which the Censor
does not concern himself, so steer clear
of forbidden topics and all will- be
well.
God bless the Censor—perhaps!
The Soldier
The soldier is wot . they puts into
khaki. Sometime 'e is put into shocks
and then 'e is a soldier-boy. There
is big .soldiers and there is little sol-
diers. - The big soldiers is wot they
calls " tin-ats." The little soldiers
'ave to salute the big Soldiers. Some
soldiers'is fat and some is small. Ask
the military police on board. Soldiers
is wot they cleans the ship with and
peels potatoes. Soldiers don't wasii
often, and wen they does they parades
with a ' pannakin. The officers is
armed with a scrubbin' brush. These
soldiers is like babies, 'cause they 'ave
rock-a-byes. Other soldiers 'ave a
game wot they call "swinging the
lead." Wish I wos one of them sol-
diers. This* IJlimaroller is like a ?00,
'cause some of the soldiers is like
dogs, they growl at everything. Others
is like parrots 'cause they swear, and
others is like cats 'cause they stop cut
all. nite, or would if they could. Sol-
diers is not afraid of big guns or long
bav'nets arf so much as the M.O.'s
little needle wot makes the arm sore.
, Soldiers is wot women marry and Gets
their allotments. That's all I know
about soldiers.
Bugs !
Bugs ! Bugs ! Yes, 1 mean BUGS ! ! !
How insignificant that word seemed
to me when I was safe on dear old
Terra Firma ... But now . . how
the very thought of it haunts me, and
yet fills me with both hatred and ad-
miration.
With hatred when I think of the
restless nights L have spent, tossing
in my bunk as my tiny aggressors
have waged unmerciful war against
me and destroyed the very best blood
in my veins.
I hate them also as I remember the
many carefully planned offensives that
I have unsuccessfully launched against
them. How, in the dead of night
when all was quiet, and the bugs were
out in their thousands, I have sud-
denly sprung up from my feigned
slumbers and searched my blankets as
with the eyes of a hawk, only to be
disappointed by a fruitless search.
The bugs had successfully evacuated
every time ! ! !
T admire them when I think of their
unequalled valour, and if Victoria
Crosses could be won by bugs, every
one of them would be a proud pos-
sessor of one.
How the tiny heroes attack odds a
thousand to one without flinching !
They advance' in open or massed for-
mation -according to their objective,
or carry out an orderly retirement if
compelled.
Surelv then, their 4 organisation is
marvellous, and their discipline an
excellent example to the 41sts, their
present foes.
Can you wonder, then, why hatred
and admiration are mingled when I
hear anybody mention the word
"bugs." * E. W. M.

"Uncle's" Day Ashore.
It was our first leave ashore and
every man was looking forward to a
day on terra firma, (I use this phrase
to contrast our ten days of tossing.)
None had greater expectations of a
"big time" than "Tiny Willie." For
Tiny was lucky—he had his real live
Uncle on board with him —and Uncle
had done the trip before. He knew the
ropes.
Leave was promised from noon. Full
instructions were given about where and
when not to go. The "pubs" were
closed so that a thirst could only be
slaked in lemonade. All were impa-
tiently awaiting noon, and then came
a further two hours' delay, because one
of the " pub-keepers" had lost the key
of the bar and was unable to close until
a new one was procured. The minutes
passed—then 2 p.m. The barges drew
alongside to take the bovs ashore.
Tiny looked his very best in his
" Massey's," and wore a proud smile as
he glanced up fondly at the kind face
of "Uncle." Tiny was genuinely proud
of Uncle, for had he not ten years be-
fore "walked" himself into third place
at the Olympic Games at the Franco-
British Exhibition? Once ashore Uncle
took charge of his party, and while the
O.C. was wiping his glasses comman-
deered a motor-car and was off to see
the "Swans." "The port is noted for
its Swans," Uncle said. The best known
of these are the "River Swan and
" Swan" beer.
Off went the merry party. "Go any-
where at all," they told the driver, and
the wicked man drove through well-
paved avenues, taking the best route to
display the landscape, and their breath
was held in admiration —a stretch of
water, low hills, the gum tree resplen-
dent, a host of little wild flowers gaily
colouring the earth. Delicate perfume
tickled the nostrils, and they were ob-
livious of their whereabouts. Suddenly
they turned, and lo! they were in the
streets of a town —to them the Forbid-
den City. Annoyance was depicted on
their faces. Uncle threatened to lynch
the chauffeur, whom he characterised
as a double "Kur" unless he imme-
diately turned back again. On second
thoughts they resolved to treat the
situation in a philosophical vein. To
overcome the depression, therefore, they
decided to repair to the Garden of Eden
and partake of some "forbidden fruit."
They were dry—very dry—and some-
one mentioned swans —and swans* —long
ones. Many long-necked beauties dis-
appeared, and then a sad discovery was
made —Uncle was not present. No one
had seen him go. Had he taken to the
hills or to the river? Tiny suggested
hunting the fish shops. Uncle was very
fond of fish. Then the thoughts of the
"Red Caps" haunted the party. What
if poor Uncle, "reared on " prime Tar-
anaki meat, milk and honey, had been
caught by the Military Police and
ushered into a place of safety? A visit
to the police station brought no news:
surely Uncle must have deserted.
Time was going—all must be on the
wharf at 9 p.m.—dare they go without
Uncle? In desperation Tiny discarded
his N.Z. hat badge to replace it with
a horse-shoe, the emblem of good-luck.
Two hours had been spent in the search
and they must make for port, for the
clock hands were approaching perilously
near the hour which would mark the
close of the day's freedom. Full of
anxiety, they walked on to the wharf,
and there, as large as life, stood Uncle
with " arms bend" and right foot " for-
ward place," sharing with a friend a
helping of fish and chips designed for
supper aboard.
Uncle's face betrayed not a vestige
of his straying, nor has it since been
ascertained where he spent the hours
which were spent searching for him.
Tiny more than ever believes in the
luck ,of horse-shoes, and vows he will
keep a tight rein on Uncle at the next
port.
J.
Our First Port of Call.
Who shall sum up all the pleasure
we had? After eleven days' pitching
and tossing in rough seas and under
stormy skies, we were positively "land-
hungry." When word was passed
round that we would make port, on the
morrow, visions of hot, fresh-water
baths, ham and eggs, fruit, and " shore-
tea " with heaps of sugar, floated before
us. Oh! what a time we anticipated!
And the beer we were going to drink!
And the realisation? It is all now a
pleasant memory. Our first port of call
was in Australia, and echoes of good
reports of the hospitality and generosity
of the Australian people towards New
Zealanders caused us to look forward
to a happy time. Nor were we disap-
pointed. On disembarkation we were
granted seven hours' leave, and al-
though the citizens were in the midst of
welcoming homo some of their own
troops just arrived from the front, yet
they made time and room in their hos-
pitality for us from N.Z. The various
Institutes were kept busy right up to
the time of our embarkation,
providing for our needs. The
Army and Navy (C. of E.) and
the Y.M.C.A. were fully patronised
and the workers made us feel welcome.
Thev provided refreshments, baths, bil-
liard tables and writing material free
of charge. Some of the citizens enter-
tained our troops in their own homes,
and when the time came for us to
embark, very few returned to the ship
without bulky parcels of fruit and cakes
—enough to last many days. And the
beer? "Nothing doing." Hotels
shut! ! ! And to complete a pleasant
day, Plis Worship the Mayor sent, us,
through our Officer Commanding, the
following message:
" T wish to convey to you, on
behalf of the citizens, my apprecia-
tion of the splendid behaviour of
the Troops of "your Reinforcement
during their stay ashore. By their
good conduct they have worthily
upheld the traditions of such con-
duct which previous reinforcements
from New Zealand have made. On
behalf of myself and the citizens of
Fremantle, I wish you Bon Voyage
and Good Luck."
To the citizens of this port we tender
our best thanks.
A Lament.
The tent is my dwelling place; I
cannot sleep;
It maketh me to lie down on hard
boards;
It leadeth me beside the waters of
discomfort;
It maketh me bad-tempered; it
leadeth me to the excessive use
of much bad language, yea,
though I wear warm pyjamas to
induce a good night's rest, I
cannot sleep, for the frost is
with me; the wind doth whistle
through my tent boards and
discomfort me;
T prepareth my dinner before me in
the presence of my tent mates;
the wind cometh and annointeth
my legs with hot liquid, for
my cup runneth over.
Surely rheumatism and lunacy will
follow me all the days of my
life; and I shall dwell in the
house of the insane for ever.
The Bath Parade.
The powers that be kindly furnished
a dip.
So we'd look and feel sweet when we
stepped off the ship.
To each grimy digger a half bucketful
To wash him and scrub him from toes
to tne skull.
Alack ! and alas ! when I came for my
scrub,
The jolly old ship gave a heave, and
the rub
Was, I slipped quite away out of reach
or control
Of the precious few cupfuls I had in
my bowl.
The bowl overturned, too; my mates
shook with mirth,
But that had to serve me from N.Z.
to Perth.
It's wonderful how much we value
fresh water,
When there's never too much, and sup-
lies may run shorter.
S.
The Homing Pigeon.
We are carrying with us a consign-
ment of homing pigeons—one of the
first consignments to be sent to the
Motherland from New Zealand. The
birds are all highly bred, and their
use for despatch work, etc., is invalu-
able.
How He Felt.
A certain young private in "G,"
Three days after we put to sea,
When asked "Are. you well?"
Replied, "This is H 1,
And for life I don't care a D ! "

A Trip to the Forbidden
City.
The words of our worthy O.C. were
drumming in our ears as we left the
ship to scramble up the wharves of
the Sunny Port. His words were em-
phatic, his manner more so : YOU
MUST REMEMBER YCU ARE
NEW ZEALANDERS ....
A hospital ship was also in port,
and hotels were closed. " They won't
get home till morning " jaunt was
toned down to what appeared to be,
on first thoughts, a walk up town and
a few rides on the broad-beamed,
squat and ugly tramcars. Fortunately,
' or otherwise, our worthy O.C. had
made a grievous miscalculation. He
forgot that in these degenerate days
soldiers are peculiar bipeds, and the
spirit of Eve, added to the guile of
the Heathen Chinee, brings forth a
mixture of curiosity and temptation
that even Bret Harte did not allow
for. It happened that when a spick-
and-span 7-seater Cadillac drew up,
and the driver thereof unburdened
, his mind on the question of the slack-
ness of trade we gave a practical view
of our sympathy and engaged him on
the spot. We never expected our
genial friend would deliberately and
against our wish and against the
orders of our officers, take us to the
City of Forbidden Fruit. Soon our
car leaped along a wide high road,
with a glorious vista ahead, hill top-
ping hill in endless length. On
either side of the road a picturesque
profusion of trees, shrubs, flowers and
palm, a splash of Crimson Coral
flower, Purple Glory peas, spiniflax
and meadow sweet. Houses were
planted here and there, adding inter-
est to the scene. Suddenly our car
bumped and swaved and left the high
road, careering down a side road, un-
til with a sudden creaking and grind-
ing of brakes, our Cadillac stopped
in front of a large brick building, and
within fifty yards of a cliff with a
glorious view of the sea below.
The balmy day, the exhilarating
rush through the air, made our throats
seem to have even a more salty flav-
our than when we were tossing on the
waves. Our innocent looks, added to
much persuasion, resulted in the ap-
pearance of six sparkling bottles.
Our spirits wanted no reviving, the
salty flavour was gone. We sped on
again. Soon we reached the city
itself, and swinging round a busy
corner dashed pell-mell into a group
of well-known Non-Coms. What a
yell of mutual recognition ! Then past
the Legislative Council Buildings,
back through the Park, travelling
over macadamised roads that led to
the port of call.
Thdh came the dash over the Bridge
and through the military picquet—-
the gauntlet run in safety. Truly a
day of days, a day in a lifetime.
Only in the last phase, when our
worthy O.C. expresses his pleasure at
seeing us so orderly and promptlv
at the rendezvous, one feels the twinge
of a guilty conscience.
R.W.P.
T'Erenikau.
'['here's a spot that has taken my
fancy,
A Maoriland soldiers' drill camp :
It's riot that it's grand, or over much
pretty —
In winter it sometimes gets damp.
And yet, when our own reinforcement
did come and we a few weeks
there did train,
The keen frosty air and the sunshine
did put some glad thoughts in
my brain.
" Class, ta ! Knees bend." " Heels
raise."
" Around that lone tree double."
" Take that smile off your dial or
yourself you will get into
trouble !"
We'd a bonnie wee band, Private 0.
took a hand,
And couldn't they play in good style;
Their inspiriting strains: made us
swing through the lanes
On the route marches mile upon mile
Not least of our pleasures we owed
to those treasures—the girls from
town they were dear.
They sang and they charmed us ; they
smiled—it ajarmed us to think
we should lose them a year.
You'll go with your mate to the can-
teen at eight, and then off to
bunk feeling warm;
While the stars twinkled bright o'er
the tents of a night,
And you'd know you were doing no
harm.
S.
They Say.
That to see ourselves as others see
us we must watch the 8 p.m. rush for
the scrap-tin.
That what might have been had we
only known. The permanent cook-
house fatigue at morning tea.
That a sturdy Napier member of
the Submarine Guard has already mis-
taken whales for submarines.
If you should lose your sea kit—
Seek it.
That the rumour spread last night
that the redoubtable Bill Stocks was
seen to shave. To save the credulence
of our readers we would fain insert a
photo of " Bill," but the negative
positively refused.
That Pvte. B is not colour-blind
was evinced by the fact that he was
heard at a recent early morning
parade to remark approvingly of the
O.C.'s suspenders.

tremely unfortunate that we cannot,
even if we would or were allowed to,
embrace all our opportunities."
Captain Wyllie (ship's master) :
" In the multitude of words there
wanteth not sin, but he that re-
straineth his lips is wise."

2nd Lieut. Haydon " Believe one

what the vintners buy, one half so
precious as the goods they sell."
The Chief Steward :—" What I
have I hold."
Tommy's Lass.
'Tain't so much the partin'
When the troops is startin'
Sets you chokin' like a snivellin' pup.
Kissin' you can stand
And the way she 'olds yer 'and :
'Tisn't that :
It's something in 'er smile as breaks
yer up.
'Tain't the rain a-droppin',
Ceaseless without stoppin',
Gives a feller queer internal pains,
Though it's mighty dampin'
This foreign mud we're trampin' :
'Tisn't that :
It's thinkin' of them muddy Cam-
bridge lanes.
'Tain't the shells a-flyin'
Makes yer scared o' dyin',
Guess yer aiu't that crawlin' kind o'
cur,
'Tisn't that you're funkin'
Foreign soil to bunk in :
'Tisn't that :
It's lyin' there so long, so far from
'er.

The Bath Parade.
Why bath! the shivering soldier cried,
While gazing on his still uncleans-ed
hide,
Why bath?
To call this thing a." bath "is stiff,
It's nothing but a - myth;
Why bath ?
Note to our Readers.—The Editor regrets that
owing to the short time available for the printing of
the Magazine, photographs of G Company,, the
N.C.O.'s, and others illustrating sports, training and
routine on board, and also photos of the ship's officers,
were unavoidably omitted.
