SOME PROBLEMS OF EMPIRE.
The Hon. GEORGE E. FOSTER.
The opening meeting of the session was held on Tuesday, November 12, 1912.
Earl Grey, G.C.8., G.C.M.G., G.C.V.0., President of the Institute, presided, and in
opening the proceedings, said that at the first meeting of a new session it was
customary for the chairman to say something about the position of the Institute. It
was the ambition of the Council to make the Institute an ever-increasingly power-
ful instrument for welding together the component parts of the Empire in close and
indissoluble union. The interest which was taken all round the world in the Empire,
in every question which made for the increased strength and efficiency of the British
Crown, provided them with an opportunity which it would be most unpatriotic on
their part if they did not take advantage of. Since the last general meeting in
June they had elected 1,159 Fellows, and of that large number 463 came from
Canada, and ninety from Rhodesia. The fact that forty of the comparatively
small white population of Northern Rhodesia had applied to be enrolled as Fellows
of the Royal Colonial Institute, justified them in believing that only a little effort
was required to enable them to ensure an increase in the number of Fellows
from the present number of 7,000 to a much higher figure. Personally he should be
deeply disappointed if, by the end of the year, they did not bring up the number of
the Fellowship to 8,000, and, before the end of 1913, to 10,000; and he was con-
vinced that with the necessary organisation it would be possible to obtain, within the
next few years, 100,000 Fellows and Associates contributing a minimum of �1 each per
annum to the revenue of the Institute.
The fact that no fewer than forty Fellows had been recruited from Northern
Rhodesia, mainly through the energy of one Fellow, Lieut.-Colonel A. St. Hill Gibbons,
should be an encouragement to all other Fellows to follow his example. Looking to
the increase in their Fellowship from Northern Rhodesia, he begged them to remember
that Englishmen who devoted themselves to developing a Greater Britain on the
fringes of the Empire did not hesitate to face the risks of privation, disease, and death,
and further, when appealed to, did not grudge to contribute from out of their slender
resources one guinea per annum to a fund to be used for Imperial purposes.
The work of the Institute was thoroughly Imperial and should be supported by
every one who had the well-being of the Empire at heart.
There were few men, if any, who had a more intimate knowledge of the require-
ments of the Empire and who could so eloquently give expression to them as Mr.
Foster, and he had now great pleasure in calling upon him to give his address on ? Some
Problems of Empire.?


The Hon. George E. Foster (Minister of Trade and Commerce, Canada): Ido not
come before you with any paper or lecture. I come simply to have a brief talk,
suggestive mainly. It will not be philosophy in tabloids or statistics in columns, but
may perhaps serve to stir up your minds by way of remembrance and remind you
that in other spheres and climes there are a very respectable number of people who
subscribe to the principles of this Institute and are trying to work them out in practice.
There are people living to-day who think that this great British Empire of ours has
been a gigantic experiment ?an experiment which had its origin not in design but
rather in chance and circumstance and necessity. There may be a good many who
think even now that the Empire is still somewhat of an experiment. With reference
to that experiment there is one essential thing which, if it be present, may make it a
success in the future, and which has made it the success it has been in the years past,
and that is the unswerving loyalty of all parts of the Empire one to the other and
wise direction in administration. It is fitting in this home of the United Empire,
that a few words should be said by way of encouragement, tracing a little the path
already trodden, and suggesting, it may be, something for the path that remains to
be traversed.
What is an Imperialist ?
I belong to the somewhat large family of Imperialists. We have been defined
in a hundred different ways, and sometimes defined pretty well out of existence.
Well, as I look at Imperialism, I should define an Imperialist to be a man who
devoutly wishes that the Empire experiment be a success, and who works along the
lines of loyalty and wise direction in order to make it a success. If that is to be an
Imperialist that is what I am and what I think a great many people in this wide
Empire of ours are. Sometimes we are defined as Jingoes, but the Imperialist is not
by any means a Jingo. The Imperialist is an ardent believer in peace, and is firmly
of the opinion that for an enduring and secure peace there is no better guarantee
than an Empire like ours?filled up, made strong, and kept loyal. Sometimes
it is said the Imperialist is a dreamer and idealist. I do not wish to deny that
suggestion. The world would not have made much progress if there had not been,
in every age, dreamers and idealists; but the Imperialist, if a dreamer and idealist,
is practical withal, and I think the practical dreamer and idealist is the hope of this
or any other country. But they say ? You have been at it for many years, and what
have you accomplished ? ? That is just the point I wish you to think over with
me to-night.
Go back to the beginnings of our Empire and trace it towards the present time.
You will find there have been two sets of forces at work, the first making for division ?
centrifugal so to speak ?the second making for unity, centripetal in tendency.
Forces that have Worked Against Unity.
I would first briefly indicate some of the principal of those dividing forces which
have operated in the past history of the Empire and which I maintain are constantly
declining forces.
One of the first was the vast and wide dispersion of what constituted the Empire.
Every sea and clime possessed some portion larger or smaller of the disconnected


Empire under Britain?s flag. That dispersion had in itself elements of danger, of
weakness, of division, and of unrest. How is it to-day ? Do you not believe with me
that instead of being any longer a force for division it is rapidly assuming the position
of a tremendous force in favour of strength and union ? And this for several reasons :
first, because ultimately it is going to give you a united Empire, with its centre in
these northern seas, but buttressed by strong parts of the Empire in every ocean of
the world; secondly, the very fact of the dispersion of our territories in this Empire
is working out in another and very different way from what was thought. By the
dispersion of your Empire territory you get all climes and products. Put your Empire
all in one zone, and you have but a modified and restricted range of products. Now
the sun in every part of the world kisses British Empire lands, evokes British Empire
products, gives place for every wish and desire for habitation. Therefore you have
again, in this very dispersion of our territory, an element of abiding and continuous
strength.
Another of the disuniting forces may have been the lack and slowness of communi-
cation. Our forefathers, long years ago, if they saw a ship from the Mother Country
once a year, had their hearts gladdened and their hopes strengthened. There was in
that farness and distance an element of danger and disunion. But every century that
has passed has reduced it. To-day communications are regular and frequent, whilst
our great cities?Capetown, Sydney, Melbourne, Vancouver, Ottawa?sit down any
hour of the day and talk with the centre of London. Communications therefore
have improved to such an extent that I think I am correct in saying that, in this
respect, there is a great decline in the possibility of consequent disruption for this
cause.
Another element of weakness was the sparse British population. It was sparse
at first. The few people flung into far-distant lands, right up against a rude and
unconquered nature, against tribes of people who were unknown and hostile to them,
had a constant struggle for existence, and there would have been little wonder if,
in case after case, they had succumbed. Has not that danger decreased ? Population
is flowing in, constantly increasing, and to-day, 15,000,000 of people?white people?
greet you from the oversea Dominions alone?a sturdy, British stock, but only
the nucleus of millions more that are to be. Thus this also is a declining force.
There was also a lack of capital and labour. That has been, in the course of many
long years, remedied in a large degree, and in the most developed of the oversea
Possessions capital is flowing in?capital is being manufactured, so to speak, in the
progress and wealth-production of these countries ; labour is going in, and so, to-day,
your steamers for Australasia and Canada are taxed to carry not only men ?more
men offering than the steamers can accommodate ?but capital as well, and skilled
labour also from this great centre of capital and labour.
One other disuniting force was the lack of sympathy and interest in the Mother-
land itself. It is a harsh thing to say, but I take it as being absolutely the fact that,
of all the discouragements the early struggling settlers in these wide-flung parts of
the Empire had to meet and suffer, the worst was that, in the midst of their struggles
and sacrifices and deprivations, amidst the stern and rugged life they had to lead,
they found sometimes but scant sympathy and interest in the Motherland itself.
Now I take it that that was not a lack of sympathy and interest in the great heart
of the Motherland itself. It was the doctrine of some politicians and some schools
of thought, and did not at all represent the heart of the Empire. But what came to
these outside strugglers ? The note that sounded in their ears was ?We who have


planted you and watched your struggles, if we have directed our eyes at all to you,
think it better that the painter were cut and you were let go.? This has entirely
vanished. Show me to-day the public man on a public platform in this whole Empire
that would offer a note so pessimistic and discouraging. Thus have I enumerated
the chief, great, disuniting forces under the stress of which our Empire has struggled
upward for hundreds of years. They have either altogether vanished, or they have
declined to a degree which robs them for the future of the force they had in the past.
The Forces that Make for Union.
Now consider with me the other set of forces ?forces which in the past and to-day
ar6 making for union, and are joining in strong-set bonds the different parts of the
Empire.
One of the primal and enduring bonds is blood and race. The descendants of
British parents, in whatever parts of these islands, were proud of their blood and of
the stock from which they sprang. They kept and held to that, and that held them
together in many a discouraging hour.
Then there are the ties of tradition and literature, both strong and never once
loosening their hold. I wish I had time to speak of them and the part they have played
in our development ?the fine and subtle cement of thought and sentiment firmly
linking people sundered in so many other respects. These ties have held from the
earliest times. To-day they exercise as much power in the outward direction as in
any previous time, and now, back from the far-off Dominions, are coming return
contributions with similar effect and power.
Then there is the tie of common institutions. It is not necessary for me to speak
of them ?how the British out-goer has held to them ?how he has treasured them ?
how he has reproduced them in his own community and in his own nation. They
have held against the assaults of ruder life, against the assaults of foreign example,
and to-day, in all parts of the Empire, we are bound and welded together in a common
love and practice of British institutions.
The army and the navy have always been a great binding force of the dispersed
people of this Empire, a force which has been vital in keeping together its various out-
lying parts. It is so to-day, but in a greater and more intimate sense. The army
and the navy to-day are composed not simply of the British soldier and the British
sailor. They have in them representatives of every part of the British Empire working
together. It is our navy and our army ?we who come from the oversea Dominions
so claim it. We have not done all we should have done to support it, but we have
always respected it. We have always relied upon it. Our sons have fought in your
army and your navy, and to-day the keels of oversea Dominion ships float side
by side in British waters with those of the old Mother Country, and as years go by
their numbers will increase?our navy will be truly Imperial. It will have in it
representatives from every part of the British Dominions. We have gone further
than theory, and our soldiers have marched side by side with British soldiers, when
the Empire was in peril and her fortunes were challenged. We know what took
place in the Boer war ; we know what would take place in any other war in which
the stability and permanence of the Empire were threatened.
Another great bond of union has been the King and the Constitution. And would
it be out of the way for me, as an overseas representative, to say that the King and
Constitution are ours as well as yours ?that in both we have vital interest just as


you have ??and when you here, as the predominant partner, have anything to do with
the King and the Constitution, remember that you hold a trust from the oversea
Dominions, for you are dealing with a priceless heritage shared by other parts of the
Empire.
Something else has happened in a new way to bind the Empire together.
Gradually the spirit of holding on, linking hands, and keeping together, grew up
into an impulse that went further than the individual and the provincial, and not
many years ago we saw the working out of that impulse in federations or unions
of contiguous parts of the Empire?into new and young nationalities, as we like to
call them. That was an entirely new development and one of the most powerful up
to that time.
The Birth of a Nation.
I think that we in Canada have in one respect an advantage that you in Great
Britain never had. You who are present can never say that you were at the birth
and participated in the early growth of a new nation. You are the heirs of an old and
long-formed nation. But many of us in Canada have witnessed the birth and assisted
in the early building of a new nation, a phenomenon of entrancing and tremendous
interest. In 1864-5, when the federation of the different provinces of Canada was
mooted, I was a boy just entering college, I was a New Brunswicker. Novat Scotia
existed, Quebec existed, Ontario existed; there was an indefinite notion that Britain
had territory west of Ontario, and some stray information came to us that there
was such a province as British Columbia on the Pacific Coast. All I knew about was
New Brunswick, and all I cared about was New Brunswick. Others were cousins
more or less removed, but national life for me there was none. I was limited to
the boundary of my little province and I could throw a stone almost from one side to
the other. What was true in my case was absolutely true in the case of every
one in the scattered provinces. There was no soul, no national life, no national
objective, no national ideal, no national impulse. I pass over the intervening years,
and present to you the Dominion of Canada of to-day, where a new nation has been
born, and a new great force developed for the Empire of the world, instinct with
national life and Imperial spirit. Thereupon hope lights up the distant hills, and
men's hearts burn within them ; doubt has vanished, confidence holds the helm, and
the future gleams strong and bright in the distance. I have lived the life and felt its
thrill and seen the splendid transformation, and I shall never cease to be thankful
therefor. Out of separation and weakness there has been evolved a mighty entity,
vitalised with national spirit, national ideal, and national impulse. There you have
an immense territory of contiguous separated portions of the British Empire of the
former days, welded into one strong nationality, with a life of its own. What has
happened ? Progress almost immeasurable has taken place, which never would and
never could have taken place if there had not been a union of ideals, a fusion
of effort, and an impulse that came from the new-growing national life. Similar
unions have taken place also in Australia, and in South Africa, and those two parts
of the Empire are working out on the same lines, and feeling the same impulse as
Canada. When people tell you that you have been long at work and nothing much
has happened, point out that, if nothing else. It is one of the most real and hopeful
signs that the grand, Imperial experiment will be thoroughly successful. At two
periods in the history of this British Empire many prophets arose. The first period
coincided with the grant of responsible government to the provinces. Then the burden


of their prophecy was: ? Your Empire will break into pieces ; your distant Possessions
will not remain true to you.? That has been falsified. When later these provinces
federated, the prophets again stood up and said : ? Ah, what we told you is coming,
but in a different way. They have not broken away previously, but now they are
making nations out of themselves and they will assuredly sever their connection
with the Old Country.? Again the prophets prophesied without any basis : for if
there is one thing more marked than another, it is the seeming paradox that, just
as soon as, and in proportion as, we became nationalised in parts we became the
more strongly imperialised as a whole. To-day in Canada we are taunted with being
more loyal than subjects of the King in the British Islands. I am not saying
whether we are or not ?I am not making that claim ; but this lam saying that
we are more Imperial than we were before the federation of Canada and the
establishment of our new national life.
The Feeling of Interdependence.
Since those federation times ?Lord Grey knows as well as I, for he has had the
experience?what has been the dominant feeling ? This a spirit and sense of inter-
dependence and mutual helpfulness between these oversea federated Dominions
with each other and with the Empire itself. Their attention was not monopolised
by the new creation ; they were not filled up with the idea that now they were young
nationalities they must think only of themselves. But in proportion as they grew
in nationhood, they grew in the practical feeling of interdependence one upon the
other, and Dominion called to Dominion, and each called to the Motherland : ?Is
there anything in which we may be helpful to each other ? Anything in which we
can co-operate and encourage each other ? ? And the history of Canada and the
other Dominions is a series of evolutions of helpful, co-operative, and co-ordinating
work between these oversea Dominions and the Motherland and with the other
oversea Dominions. To-day we have postal and cable and steamship communications,
subsidised and supported by different parts of the Empire. We have the growing
assimilation of our laws?commercial and other ?doing away with hindrances between
the trade and communication of the Mother Country and the Dominions. To make
a long story short, we have done many things; not the least is that instead of jealously
claiming all the trade we possibly could get, and to our own advantage, these
oversea Dominions have given to each other, and have given to the Motherland,
preferential treatment. You may like it or not. You may say that it conflicts
with your theories or not. We gave it to you. You accepted it with a fairly smiling
countenance, and to-day it is operative. We gave to the Mother Country better
commercial treatment than we give to any stranger country. We give to other of
the Dominions better treatment than we give to those who do not belong to our sister-
hood. That is something in the way of binding and bringing together, and showing
that because we have become young nations, we have not become utterly selfish.
And with nothing even a little like boasting, let me say that the Dominion of Canada,
when the West India Islands fell upon hard times, held out the hand as best we could
and gave to those Islands for fifteen years the advantage of a 33J per cent, preference
in our markets, and we did not ask and did not expect any return. Seed sown on
the waters sometimes brings forth bread, and after these fifteen years, under better
and more favourable circumstances, we have just concluded, and in the course of a few
weeks will put into operation, a mutual preference trade agreement between the main


part of the West India Islands and the Dominion of Canada. Note also the frequent
conferences we have had to smooth away differences and secure mutual advantages.
Here to-day, sitting in this city, is a Eoyal Imperial Commission, which never could
have been if we had not had these federations in the outside Dominions ; and this body
is at work to-day, trying to find out what is inside all this great Empire, and how it
may be best developed for the good and strength of the whole Empire. Again,
there has developed in these later years the Imperial Conference, in which the Premiers
of the different Dominions and of the Mother Country meet together every four years,
take note of the situation, and discuss questions of mutual interest, and pursue plans
for mutual improvement. Over and above that, there has been this latest- of all
developments ?the invitation from the Imperial Defence Committee to the Premiers
of the outside Dominions to enter with them into the Arcana of the Empire, and
there to learn the conditions and circumstances of foreign policy and foreign
defence. All this it seems to me may well be treasured up by the Imperialist of
to-day, as irrevocable and irrefragible proof of the great steps forward to an ulti-
mately completely united Empire. Nor has the forward movement been by any
means stopped.
An Imperial Consciousness Needed.
It is absolutely impossible, to my mind, for this Empire movement to stop now
that the course has been so well laid and the impetus given. It would require more
force to stop the tendency towards complete union than it did at the first to part
the impetus.
But we need still more, and one thing imperatively needed is the development of
an Imperial consciousness. Our national consciousness is well developed?that of
the Irishman for his native Ireland, the Scotchman for the land of his birth, the Welsh-
man and the Englishman for theirs. The Imperial consciousness is not so keen and so
strong and not so easily perfected. It is a more difficult process, and takes more time.
The Scotchman is born and brought up in Scotland, and in the process he incorporates
into his physical, his mental, and his spiritual being the subtle influences that make
him a Scotchman till the day of his death. It is a great mistake to think that love of
country is all spiritual. From the moment a boy commences to observe he assimilates
the features and peculiarities of his environment. I do not know the process, but
by some strange chemistry the boy, as he grows up and observes the outlines of land-
scape and the tints of the sky, listens to the songs of the brooks, sees Nature?s changes
of dress and colour season by season, and listens to the notes of native songsters,
has all this photographed in his inner and spiritual being, and he is made his
country?s man by the very fact this process goes on. Add to that, literature, song,
story, art, politics, social life?common joys and sorrows even?each adds its
indelible imprint to make the national man. But even the Scotchman cannot be born
and brought up both in Scotland and Australia ; consequently it is difficult for him
to be so thoroughly Australian as Scotchman; and the same takes place all through.
What I want to point out is that the wide dispersion of this Empire of ours makes
it more difficult to cultivate an Imperial consciousness than it is to cultivate a
national consciousness ; but the Imperial consciousness is just as necessary for
the final success of the Imperial state as the national consciousness is for the national
state. And we are growing ; the process is naturally and necessarily slower, but
it is streaming into our minds, our constitution, our life. Science, in its later appli-
cations, has brought the Empire more close than Scotland used to be even to


Scotchmen, and so we are being gradually enabled more and more to visualise the
conditions and to feel the impulses of life throughout the whole Empire, to incorporate
them into our constitution and growth, to spiritualise and idealise them. Any man
who has lived and thought for the last twenty-five years can see the growth of this
Imperial consciousness?almost its birth. In a word, the Empire must find its soul,
and then organise to ensure its salvation. When we fully realise that this Empire
is no longer an abstraction, but a real, splendid entity with living ideals and soulful
purpose and tendency, then we shall organise, and then we shall save the Empire.
The Forces that Help.
Do you not see the almost numberless and the absolutely invincible elements at
work to-day to develop that Imperial consciousness ? Every man who travels from this
country into one of the oversea Dominions is contributing his share. Every telegram
that flashes news of the outside parts to you and to us in the outside Dominions from
you is doing its share. Every man and, woman who, at the fireside or in the school,
in magazine or newspaper, on the platform or in the pulpit, teaches what is the
breadth and greatness and significance of this Empire, is doing his part; and the
multiplied societies and associations whose names are so many that I cannot enumerate
them, the legislators in our halls, and the merchants in their offices, are all helping
towards a wide Imperial consciousness and working towards an organised plan for the
realisation of the ideal which springs therefrom. As we gain that Imperial conscious-
ness, we shall take an Imperial view of certain things to which we have been rather
directing ourselves from the smaller national or sectional side. We must reverse that
operation?not to the abandonment of the latter, but to the inclusion of the Imperial
side as well.
Empire View of Migration.
One of the questions we ought to view from the Imperial side is the movement
of population. Within the Empire, containing 400,000,000 of people, there are only
65,000,000 of the white race, 45,000,000 here and the rest in the outside Dominions. If
this Empire is to remain a British Empire and its civilisation to remain British, the
British stock must be increased rather than diminished, because other stock is flowing
into the vacant spaces of the Empire. You have an idea that the United States, for
example, is absorbing a lot of people from outside and that to assimilate them is a
great task. But the United States has 90,000,000 of people. It receives for assimi-
lation 1,000,000 yearly. It has 92 people to mother and father each new-comer.
Take Canada. This year Canada will perhaps find 500,000 people coming in from
abroad. Our population is only 8,000,000. Canada therefore has only 16 people to
father and assimilate each new-comer. The problem, I say, is to keep the British stock
dominant. You can do it only in two ways?by assimilation, or by actual injection
of new British stock. lam not going to put theories before you ? but what is the
condition in this country ? Until comparatively recently, nobody thought about
emigration at all. The out-goer went, as and whither he pleased, and in the century
that has just passed many many millions of good British stock have filtered out from this
country?not to the waste places and vacant spaces of British Possessions, but to alien
and foreign countries. If that blood had been directed into the veins of our oversea
Possessions, what a different aspect they would have presented to-day. The current
is changing somewhat, but not because of united consultation and plan, and scientific
endeavour ; but while forty per cent, of British stock, leaving this country, fail to come
into British Dominions, things are not as they ought to be and might be. Great Britain


may say, ? Do not drain my people away from me,? and the oversea Dominions
may say, <� We want as many.as we can get of the right kind. Thereby arises a
possible clash. But there are some illuminating features.
You have in this Old Country small spaces and dense populations: we have large
spaces and small populations. There is demand and supply. You have in this
country a surplus of womanhood, amounting to one million and more : we have in
the oversea Dominions a lack of womanhood ?a lack which all deplore. Here then
are millions of your population, taking year upon year, in regard to whom some
adjustment might be made which would fill the great want for womanhood that we
experience in the outside Dominions, and would open a career and prospect for
women who, in this country, do not seem to have such openings.
In this country you have tens of thousands of children ?orphan children, deserted
children, children worse than orphans, who have to be taken away from their sur-
roundings for their salvation. These count up into thousands and tens of thousands.
The oversea Dominions cry for these children, and cannot get the number they want.
There, again, is a ground upon which a desirable adjustment might take place.
You have in this country unemployed employables. In so far as you cannot find
employment for them, let them go to the oversea Dominions with your blessing, and,
if necessary, with your help. Remember, a man is not lost because he migrates from
London to Canada or Australia ; he is still building up your Empire there, for which
you give him no chance here. There is therefore a large margin for adjustment in
this class.
Going further, there is a mass of people who are not fit for employment as they
stand, but hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of whom could be adapted by a little
care and treatment, and translated to new conditions, where hope would enter their
hearts and an outlook be given them. To my mind, here is a class of population in
regard to which the oversea Dominions and the Mother Country might well join hands,
and finances too. A man out of work is in absolute peril ] his fibre weakens as he
knocks at every door and can find no work to do. Pick up the man before he loses
heart, and if you have not a place for him here, help him to some place in the Empire.
Let me pay my tribute to the unselfish, untiring, and philanthropic efforts of many
of?your societies of men and women in this country, who give themselves infinite trouble
and take the most sympathetic pains to save those who would otherwise be lost. They
have challenged my admiration, in proportion as I have become more aware of the
work they have done and are doing. lam not here to give advice to you, but I would
remind you that men and women are not chattels. You cannot dispose of them as you
would a shock of wheat, or a barrel of apples ; they will go if they want to go, and
can get money to go. Britain has to revise something in this country, I think. She
must pay a better wage for competent persons and open up conditions which will
give hope of future betterment to those who are now shut out, and if she does not do
that she must expect to lose sons and daughters ?but to lose them, if proper action
is taken, thank Heaven ! to other parts of the Empire where they will not be lost
as elements of strength and permanence in our civilisation.
Empire View of Trade.
I think also that we should take an Imperial view of trade and production. lam
not touching party policies. lam dealing simply with principles. I have not time to
go into this argument, but I want to give you my thought in an illustration. Here is
the British individual trader. Here is part of the British Empire?Canada which we


will personify as the National trader, and here is another personification of the Imperial
trader. Watch certain operations. We have grown to deify trade and commerce in
abstract and concrete, and we set up these deities in the market place. Shall I startle
you if I make the statement that trade and commerce never have and never will create
one single atom of wealth ? They are simply the middlemen who interchange products
and grow rich on the tolls they take therefrom. That is not to say they are not neces-
sary and do not fit absolutely well into the economy of things. But what I want to
call attention to is that trade and commerce are not the main things. Production is
the main*thing. Now for my illustration. Your British trader takes his British ship,
he goes to the Argentine Republic, he buys a load of wheat, he takes that wheat to
Germany, sells it and buys from Germany a load of manufactured goods, and takes
that load back to the Argentine. He has had two good trades, and made his money.
He does not care about the country of origin and production : he is in for interchange,
and his position is perfectly logical. Now take the Dominion of Canada as a National
trader. She takes a cargo of her wheat, and sends it down to the United States,
sells it there, buys a return cargo of fruit, brings it up into the North-West, and sells it
there. Canada has thus the advantage and profit of one production, the United
States has the other. But Canada does another thing. She takes a cargo of wheat
and butter from the Middle North-West over to British Columbia, sells it there, buys in
British Columbia fruit and lumber, brings it back and sells it to the men of the Middle
North-West. Do you see the difference ? There, Canada has the advantage of two
productions. It means that the British Columbia fruit and lumber industry is vastly
impelled and helped, and that the grain and butter producing industries of the middle
parts of the North-West are also helped in the same transaction. Canada, if she could,
would like to conduct all her interchanges between parts of her own territory. But
climate, soil, and geographical position make that impossible. But the Empire, within
its vast bounds, can raise nearly every product the Empire needs. She has every
soil and climate, every kind of production; and, to the largest extent, Empire trade, if
rightly organised, can find its own double production for nineteen-twentieths of all
it will use. It is production and development that bring into relief the wonderful
possibilities of Empire trade, as I believe coming years will see it. Can we not raise
the foods the Empire needs within the bounds of the Empire ? Last year �68,000,000
were paid to foreign countries for cotton imported into this country. Think what
that means. It means that �68,000,000 go into foreign countries, developing a vast
industry, building homes, providing labour, capital, wealth, and everything that is
necessary to build up that country. If it were possible to raise this cotton within
the bounds of the British Empire, how far would that �68,000,000 go towards
fertilising and developing the waste places of this Empire ? Last year �37,000,000
were paid for meat. Cannot the Empire furnish the means of supplying its own
meat ? Somewhere about �56,000,000 were paid for foods of the sorts our Empire
produces, and �58,000,000 for wheat and its flour. If it is possible, and in so far as
it is possible, to have these and other needed products raised in our own Empire,
to supply our own needs, it would revolutionise settlement and development, and
wealth-production, and consequent progress in civilisation and advancement.
Empire Organisation.
And now one last word to leave with you. It is simply this ?Organisation.
Organisation is what has made Canada what she has become. It is what is making
Australia what she is becoming. Organisation?other things being equal?brings


success, as lack of it brings failure. Organisation, from the Empire point of view, is
then, it seems to me, one of the essentials for our future success. lam not following
out the argument in suggesting what can be done. When men really want to do a
thing in business, what is the process ? They come together, talk over the matter,
put plans before one another, analyse, and discuss, and by and by find a proper
plan, and then go on to carry it out. It is the only way in which this Empire will
ever be organised. It is when all parts get sufficiently interested, and come together
in some capacity for consultation and for decision, that you will have a proper Empire
organisation. I myself do not believe we shall ever have a perfect organisation
until we possess in this Empire some deliberative, directive body, which represents
and typifies all parts of the Dominions. Nor am I disappointed because it has not
come yet, nor hopeless because it will not come to-morrow nor the next day. Years
in the life of a nation or Empire count very little, but that it will come I am certain,
and the sooner it comes, supervening upon proper consultation, the better for the
Empire. If it would be a gain to the people of the outside Dominions?and who
doubts it ? ?to have the counsel and work of your seasoned able men in this part
of the Empire, would it be altogether a disadvantage to you if you were to call
in men from the oversea Dominions, and mingle your counsels with theirs for the
general good of the Empire ? This Empire of ours ?do you ever try to visualise it ?
Have you considered its vast area, its large population, its almost innumerable pro-
ductions, its magnificent figures of interchange, and its equipment of forces as they
stand to-day ? Let memory work backwards. It was not always thus. There
has been a splendid growth. Let imagination work. forwards. Think what it may
be fifty, a hundred, a thousand years from now; and as the splendid vision grows
it unfolds an ideal such as no people, from the earliest dawn of time, have beheld?
the ideal of a great, multiplied, and extended British Civilisation, which we, here, and
men abroad may unite in declaring to be one of the most beneficent instrumentalities
ever given to the world. What it is now, what it may be in a hundred years
and more from now, if we do our duty and rise to our responsibilities, the pen of no
writer and the tongue of no speaker can avail to predict.
The Chairman said he would not be fulfilling properly the duties appertaining to
the Chair if he did not convey to Mr. Foster at once, on behalf of all present, an
expression of their profound and grateful thanks to him for the inspiring address to
which it had been their privilege to listen. He doubted if there had ever been pre-
sented from that platform a more able statement as to the laws which regulated the
growth of Imperial evolution.
Hon. A. L. Sifton (Prime Minister of Alberta) proposed a vote of thanks to the
Chairman, and, alluding to Mr. Foster, said he had anticipated great pleasure in
listening to the address of a man whose reputation as an orator had spread throughout
the Dominion and had now become Empire wide, and he had not been disappointed.
