MOUNT TORRENS
Situated 30 miles by road from Adelaide in the valley of
the Angas Creek, a tributary to the Torrens, nestles the town-
ship of Mount Torrens, one of the early settled districts of the
State of South Australia. In the early history of the State
a special survey in the sources and tributaries of the Torrens
was made, and it was thought that the tributary leading up the
valley from the Torrens was really the source of the Torrens,
and the mount was given the name Mount Torrens. Later it
was decided that the source of the Torrens was in the Mount
Pleasant district. The height above sea level of Mount
Torrens at the Trigonometrical Station is 1918 feet. The first
land allotted in the locality of the township of Mount Torrens
was Section 6507, to James Bowman, of Huddlesfield, England,
in 1841. The same year Section 6508 was granted to Richard
Henry Hartley, of Halifax, and Section 6509, 6519, and 6520
were allotted to the South Australian Company.
The first settlers came to the locality in 1841, 95 years ago,
but the township survey was not made until 1853. James
Dunn, of Mount Barker, took up Section 6504 in May, 1842,
and the South Australian Company were allotted Section 6500,
6501, 6502, and 6503, in October of the same year. George
Dunn, of Mount Torrens, took up Section 6505 and 6506 in
January, 1846, and in 1853 he subdivided portion of Section
6506 and created the township of Mount Torrens, a plan of
which was deposited in the General Registry Office. Some of
the early purchasers of township lots from George Dunn were
John Pargher, May, 1853, lot 25; William Simmons, November,
1853, lot 1; Edward Prescott, November, 1853, lot 9; -®neas
M. Allen, November, 1853, lot 8; Francis H. Paulding, George
Brunskill, and George Muller, lots 2 and 3: Richard Gillard,
May, 1854, lot 6; John Phillips, February, 1855, lot 4; Thomas
Hector, May, 1854, lot 7; William Teague, May, 1855, lot 5;
Trustees Bible Christians, October, 1855, lots 17 and 18; John
Pargher, January, 1855, lot 13; Benjamin Walker, February, 1854,
part lots 20 and 23; Benjamin Walker, 1857, part lot 24; Hilarius
Carl Hick, April, 1857, lots 11 and 12; John Sherry Bennett,
April, 1857, lot 10; Joseph P. James, April, 1858, part lot 22;
John Sherry Bennett, December, 1859, lot 16.
In 1860, Section 6507 was conveyed from James Bowman to
Thomas Inglis, who In 1861 brought the section under the Real
Property Act and subdivided it, the survey being made by C. B.
Young and A. A. Light in April, 1861, and 1863. This survey
formed Mount Torrens East. Those taking up lots were Eliza
Fenix, Edward Prescott, James Henry Crowe, George Sayer,
George Dunn, junr., Johann Conrad Kleinitz, John Westmore-
land, Benjamin Walker, and William Thomas Lane.
The first postmaster, as far as known, was Benjamin Walker,
who conducted a general store in the premises now occupied
by Mr. R. J. Hicks, in 1853. He later built the store now
occupied by Mr. W. E. Woods, and sold the business to Captain
J. H. Crowe, who also took over the post office. Since J. H.
Crowe, the post office has been held by W. Atkinson, Miss King,


First Evangelical Trinity Church, built in 1872. It was also used as a school.


R. Whitbread, J. W. Parsons. Mrs. R. Mullins, and the present
postmaster, W. E. Woods, who took over in August, 1924.
The first school was opened in the Bible Christian Chapel
by a Mr. Broad, in 1854. The first appointment of a teacher
by the Central Board of Education was made in 1859, when Mr.
Edward Starkey Tuck was appointed head teacher. In a report
issued in 1860, it was stated;—“This school continues to main-
tain its condition as to numbers and efficiency, but suffers at
present from being held in a chapel. The erection of a school
house is in contemplation. Valuable assistance is rendered by
Mrs. Tuck.” The average attendance in 1860 was 47. A
school building was erected during the year 1861, and was
vested in the district council for public school purposes under
the control of the Board of Education. In the year 1876
the school building was transferred to the Council of Education.
In 1877 the Gumeracha Board of Advice was formed, consisting
of P. Hannaford, M.P. (chairman), Wm. Lillecrapp, H. A. Giles,
and O. Philp, and the Mount Torrens school was under the
control of this body. In 1880, the school was transferred to
the Mount Pleasant Board of Advice, consisting of Henry
Dutton (chairman), G. B. Sketheway, and Frank Thompson.
A Commonwealth record was established by Mr. Edward Starkey
Tuck and Miss Sophia M. Tuck, inasmuch that they had charge
as head teachers of the Mount Torrens school for 52 years;
Mr. Tuck, from 1860 to 1877, and his daughter. Miss S. M. Tuck,
from 1877 to 1912. Other teachers who have had charge
of the Mount Torrens school are Miss C. A. Chesterman, Miss
McNeil, Miss Lundberg, P. iD. Kuss, E. O’Sullivan, F. Page,
C. Wright, C. H. Nitschke, H. Harvey, H. L. Townsend, N. L.
Haines, Robert Hamilton, and A. Hermes.
Among scholars of the Mount Torrens school who did par-
ticularly well and of whom the school is proud, are Hermann
Brauer, Professor of Languages, Wisconsin University, U.S.A.;
Marie Tuck, artist, Paris; Dr. Don Sumner, Rhodes Scholar;
Sydney Lang, 8.A., Cambridge; Nelly H. Woods, Master ;of
Arts and Tate Medallist: Joyce Sumner, Elder Scholarship.
Five scholars of the Mount Torrens school went abroad to com-
plete their studies: —Misses Marie and Francis Tuck, Sydiley
Lang, Don Sumner, and Joyce Sumner, who is at present study-
ing in England. Nelly H. Wood had a brilliant career at
the Adelaide University, and after obtaining her Master of Arts
degree, continued research work in geology for which she 'wtas
awarded the Tate medal. She is now the wife of Dr. Wallis
V. Ludbrook, of Canberra, and is continuing her research work
at Canberra.
The education of the children of the early settlers was
further catered for when a school and teachers’ residence was
built by the Lutheran settlers at Springhead, one and a hglf
miles south of Mount Torrens, in the year 1856, the first teacher
being Mr. Hammer. Other teachers having charge of the
school were J. M. R. Ey (later Pastor Ey), A. Andrae, W.
Strempel, B. D. Lange, Miss A. E. Longer, F. Semlin, J. H.
Leptin, C. Kuchel, F. Wotzke, G. Menzel, O. Heubner, and
the present teacher, R. T. Schueller. For some years the
South Australian Government paid the congregation a school
subsidy to assist in the upkeep of the school. The examining

inspector of the South Australian Education Department ill
ISO!) was Edward Dewhurst, whose report stated that he was
pleased with the progress of the school under Mr. Strempel’s
instruction. The school was open continuously from 1856 to
1917, when by Act of Parliament all Lutheran schools were
closed. The school was re-opened on January 27, 1931, Mr.
lloy T. Schueller being installed as head teacher.
In the year 1854, the Bible Christians built the first church
in Mount Torrens, in which regular services were held until
1888, when the present structure was erected, due to the efforts
of the Rev. W. H. Cann, who was then stationed at Mount
Torrens. The foundation stone was laid by Sir Samuel J.
Way in 1888, and the church was opened free of debt. The
laud on which the church was erected was presented by the
late Mr. E. S. Tuck. The first minister appointed in 1858 was
the Rev. J. Ridclift. Those who have had charge since were
Rev. J. Foster, Rev. J. Rock, Rev. M. Mason, Rev. W. W. Finch,
Rev. W. Richards (on two occasions), Rev. J. Kelly, Rev. J.
Pearce, Rev. R. Lang (on two occasions), Rev. G. Varley,
Rev. W. H. Cann, Rev. J. H. Ashton (on two occasions). Rev.
T. M. Flood, Rev. T. Theobald, Rev. E. Arnold, Rev. F. H. Close,
Rev. H. C. Hill, Rev. F. Davis, Rev. W. S. Station, Rev. D. Dick-
son, Rev. J. W. Barrett, Rev. L. G. Hunt, Rev. F. Timberlake,
and the present minister, Rev. M. C. Morris. In the year 1900
the Bible Christian Church was merged into the Methodist
Union. In 1909 a new manse was erected adjoining the site
on which the first church and manse were built.
In 1856, Lutherans residing in the district organized a
congregation to-day known as the Evangelical Lutheran Trinity
Church, at Springhead, Mount Torrens. Divine service was
held in the school room, which was near the site of the first
church built in 1872. The present church and school was
built in 1909. The first pastor was the Rev. G. D. FMtzsche,
of Lobethal, Those who have had charge of the circuit since
are Pastor C. Hellmuth, Pastor L. F. E. Krause, Pastor J. M. R.
Ey, Pastor E. Kriewaldt, Pastor E. J. A. Schulz and Pastor
T. W. Lutze, who is at present officiating.
Church of England. On September 12, 1859, at a meeting
of those interested, it was decided to erect a church. Mr.
G. Dunn, senr., gave half an acre of land and a donation of
£2O. Mr. E. Prescott was appointed secretary. Work was
immediately commenced and on December 17, 1859, the founda-
tion stone of the church was laid. The church was opened
on Sunday, October 22, 1860, by the Bishop. The first appoint-
ment of a minister to service Mount Torrens and Mount Pleasant
occurred in 1861, when the Rev. J. A. Boake was appointed.
Those who have had charge since are Rev. W. A. Clayfield,
Rev. R. W. Fljolden, Rev. G. E. Gibbs, Rev. J. Wayland, Rev.
R. A. Adams, Rev. G. Selves, Rev. F. W. Wilkinson, Rev. R. H.
Adams, Rev. R. Campbell, and the Rev. Philpotts, who at
present has charge.
The flour mill, which is one of the oldest landmarks,
was built in 1853 by Edward Prescott, and was later taken
over by Messrs. Dube and Hillmann, who sold to Benjamin
Walker, who, after working the mill for some years, decided to
build and open a flourmill at Mannum. The late Richard


The present Evangelical Lutheran Church built in 1909 and the school, built in 1889.


Townsend, of Mount, Torrens, had charge of erecting the plant.
Later Mr. Townsend purchased the Mount Torrens mill from
Mr. Walker and carried on the milling business at Mount
Torrens for many years. When he retired from business his
sons, D. and J. Townsend, carried on. Later, J. Townsend with-
drew from the firm and until the mill was closed the late Mr.
Dick Townsend was the proprietor. The mill and building
were bought by the Adelaide Milk Supply Co-op., Ltd., who are
carrying on a large milk and cheese depot and factory.
The first liquor licence was granted to Mr. George Dunn,
and the licensed premises were situated on Dunn’s Farm. Mr.
Dunn then built the first hotel on the position on which the
present hotel stands. Later another hotel was built and kept
by Mr. J. Bond, situated at the northern end of the township,
the premises now being owned by Mr. G. Klose.
Mount Torrens was on the route traversed by the bullock
teams carting ore from the Reedy Creek mine, near Palmer,
to the smelters at Glen Osmond. There was then an hotel
about every four miles along the route. The first mail
service to Mount Torrens was carried on horseback from Wood-
side. The main road to Mount Torrens was then past the
farm now owned by Mr. B. B. Wilhelm, Carting of produce
to the city was then done by bullock teams; a fast team of
bullocks could possibly do the trip to Adelaide in 12 hours.
The Vine Inn, Glen Osmond, was usually the end of the day’s
journey. Into Adelaide and unload the next morning, load
up in the afternoon, and get back to the Vine Inn to be ready for
a start over the hill the next morning, arriving back at Mount
Torrens at the end of the third day if the weather was
favourable and roads were not boggy. If business had to be
done in a hurry, settlers walked to the city to save time.
In the sixties the new road survey and the macadamized
road came through and a coach service was established, Mount
Torrens being the terminus of the Eagle on the Hill-Stirling-
Woodside route, and the journey to Adelaide was reduced to
about a five-hour one. Many are the stories told of the coach-
ing days and the wonderful drivers. The coach service was
continued until 1918, when on the 16th September the railway
line was opened. The travelling public are now catered
for by a rail bus, and a road motor service dally, and the journey
to Adelaide reduced to about one and a half hours.
Gold was discovered in the district in the sixties at the
foot of the north-western slopes of the mount. Quite a number
of good alluvial finds were made and a number of prospectors did
very well. A stir was caused when at about the same period a
rich outcrop of reef was discovered where the Government
cyanide works are now situated. The reef was heavily studded
with gold, wonderful specimens being taken out, and it was
generally thought that a real Bonanza had been struck. But
on sinking, the quality of the ore failed to hold and gradually
petered out and became low grade ore. A number of gold-
bearing reefs have been discovered and worked, but nothing of
outstanding quality has yet been discovered, but among old
prospectors of the district it has always been thought that a
rich deposit is awaiting discovery.
During the early years of the settlement wheat growing
was the chief industry. The soil returned wonderful crops

without any assistance: was hand reaped and threshed. A
common return was 10 bushels to the acre. As time went
on much of the land was let so back to wattle growing. Some
of the best wattle bark in the State was grown at Mount Torrens,
and for many years hundreds of tons per annum was stripped
in the district. The first bark mill at Mount Torrens was
erected and worked by Mr. C. Stoeckel, and later Messrs. John
Reid & Sons, of Hindmarsh, erected a bark mill and ground
the bark bought at Mount Torrens. Messrs. T. Paltridge
and Sons, of Mount Barker, were also large buyers of bark
here. The wattle growing industry gradually gave way to
clearing and top dressing for pastures, dairying now being
carried on extensively in the district. In the district there are
also many well-known Merino flocks, noted for their high quality
wool. Among the quality wool growers over a period of many
years are E. A. Herrmann, “Dilford Vale”; W. Ft. C. Herrmann
and Co., “Rondenella”; T. J. Hannam, “Murray View”; T. A.
Herrmann, “Marmora’ 1 ; A. B. Herrmann, “Lilydale”; A. L.
Herrmann, “Thorindale.”
During the Great War many fine efforts were made by the
residents of Mount Torrens and locality in raising funds for
the many war appeals. The high water mark was reached and
records were broken when at a one-day effort the sum of £690
was collected. Those who enlisted from Mount Torrens to
serve abroad were Nurse C. Hicks, Soldiers L. G. Bennett,
E. P. Boelke, L. Bailey, E. Clark, H. Fountain, F. H. Hicks,
W. Hicks, H. L. House, E. H. House, P. Ruth, N. Ruth, E. Ross,
V. Robinson, T. Stanbury, P. Turner, R. Turner, W. R. Wood,
G. P. J. Wood, and S. A. D. Wood. Those who lost their lives
were L. G. Bennett, P. H. Hicks. V. Robinson, R. Turner, and
W. R. Wood.
In 1920, It was felt that something should be done in the
matter of the erection of a public hall. Arranging of public
meetings and concerts had always been handicapped by the
fact that no public building was available. A good response
to the appeal was received at a public meeting held that year,
and it was decided to undertake the erection of a hall. The
Tuck family very generously gave the land on which the hall Is
built. It was decided to build it as a memorial to the soldiers
and call it the Mount Torrens Soldiers’ Memorial Hall. The
foundation stone was laid by Sir J. Lancelot Stirling in 1922,
and the hall opened in 1923.
As the years went on the lack of a public park and recrea-
tion ground was felt. The different sports clubs were forced
to get the use of grounds from private owners. In 1936,
Mr. H. James offered a piece of land to the people of the
district, if they care to buy it, for a recreation park. At a
public meeting a good response was received to an appeal
made tor the purchase of the ground, and over £IOO was
promised at that meeting. A committee was formed, and
it was decided to purchase the ground. It was decided that
the name of the park be the Mount Torrens Centenary Recreation
Park. It is ideally situated; it has been fenced, a new cricket
pitch laid down, and many trees planted, and it is hoped that
from year to year improvements and tree planting can be
carried out and an ideal and picturesque park and sports ground
established,
