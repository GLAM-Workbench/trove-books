TO THE PROPRIETORS OE EAST INDIA STOCK.
Ladles and Gentlemen,
I BEG leave most respectfully to offer myselt to
your notice, as a Candidate for a Seat in the Direction of youi
Affairs, and to solicit the honour of your support.
An experience of upwards of twenty years in the Hon. Company s
Sea Service, during the latter part of which I commanded one of your
regular China Ships, has afforded me an opportunity of acquiring, in
addition to nautical information, a practical knowledge of the trade
with India and China, and of your shipping interests generally.
The circumstance, also, of there being at present no nautical Di-
rector in the Committee of Shipping, induces me to hope that my ser- “
vices might be rendered useful: and should Ibe placed in the honour-
able station to which I aspire, my whole time and best exertions shall
toe zealously devoted to the performance of my duties.
I have the ho.iour to be. Ladies and Gentlemen,
Your most obedient Servant.

JOHN WILSON, Secretary.
COUNTY of ELGIN, SCOTLAND—In a
MEETING of the Freeholders, Commissioners of Supply, and
Heritors of the County of Elgin, called for the purpose of taking into
consideration the measure of Reform proposed to Parliament by his
Majesty’s Ministers as soon as the details of the Bill are befoie the
country; present —
Sir Archibald Dunbar, of Norlhfield, Bart.
Sir William G. G. Camming, Bart., of Ally re and Gordons] on
Major Charles Lennox Cutmning Bruce, of Roseble and Kinnaird.
Colonel Hay, of Westertown
Colonel Brander, of Pitgaveny
Peter Brown, Esq. of Dunkinty
John Gordon Peterkin, Esq. of Grange
Norman M 4 Leod, Esq. of Dalvey
Mfgor James Grant Younger, of Tannarchy, Ac. Ac. Ac.,
Sir ARCHIBALD DUNBAR, Bart, was unanimously called to the
Chair.
Major Charles Lennox Camming Bruce, of Roseisle and Kinnaird,
then proposed the following Resolutions, which being duly seconded
by Colonel Alexander Hay, of Westertown, were put from the Chair,
and carried unanimously, viz.:
Resolved, I. That while certain alterations in the state of the
representation, and of the qualification carrying the elective fran-
chise, are expedient, in consequence of the altered circumstances of
some parts of the empire, and to remedy the defects which time has
brought about, it is the opinion of this county that the changes pro-
posed in the Bill now before Parliament are much too extensive to be
adopted with safety to the existing Institutions of the country.
3. That as regards the representation of the Royal Burghs, while
the system of the self-elected Councils calls for correction, the altera-
tion proposed involves the virtual disfranchisement of all the smaller
Towns in Scotland.
3. That, in the representation of Counties, the effect of the low fate
at which it is proposed to fix the qualification, would be to prostrate
the landed interest beneath the proprietor of the villages; while the
attaching the right of voting to leases of 502. rent would be in the
highest degree prejudicial to the agriculture of the country, subver-
sive of the independence of the tenantry, and destructive of those
kindly feelings which do and ought to exist between the tenants and
landlords of Scotland.
4. That in the proposed union of Counties, as that of Nairn with
Elgin, the rights of some are unnecessarily confounded, while those of
others are virtually abolished.
5. That an Address to the King, and Petitions to both Houses of the
Legislature, be presented,praying that the Bill now before Parliament
may not pass into a law.
6. That bis Grace the Duke of Gordon be requested to present the
Address to the King, and Petition to the House of Lords; and the Peti-
tion to the House of Commons be forwarded to the Hon. Colonel
Grant for presentation.
7. That the foregoing Resolutions be published in the Elgin Courier,
the Inverness and Aberdeen Journals, Edinburgh Courant, and Lon-
don Courier.
On the motion of Colonel Hay, seconded by Major Camming Bruce,
the unanimous thanks of the Meeting were voted to Sir Archibald
Dunbar for his conduct in the Chair.
Mr. Gordon Peterkin, of Grange, seconded by Sir Archibald Dunbar,
proposed that the thanks of the Meeting he offered to Major Gumming
Bruce, for the trouble he had taken in preparing the Resolutions,
which was unanimously agreed to.

URGESS’S ANCHOVIES—
Warehouse, No. 107, Strand, corner of the Savoy steps.—JOHN
BURGESS and SON being apprised of the numerous endeavours
made by many persons to impose a spurious Article for their make,
feel it incumbent upon them to request the attention of the Public, in
purchasing what they conceive to be the original, to observe the name
and the address correspond with the above. The general appearance
of the spurious descriptions will deceive the unguarded, and for their
detection, B. and SON submit the following Cautions—some are in
appearance, at first sight, 44 The Genuine,” but without any name ami
address—name 44 Burgess’s Essence of [Anchovies” —others 44 Burgis’s,”
and many more without address. —JOHN BURGESS and SON having
been many years honoured with such distinguished approbation, feel
every sentiment of respect towards the Public, and earnestly solicit
them to inspect the Labels previous to purchasing what they conceive
to be of their make, which they hope will prevent many disappoint-
ments.—BUßGESS’S NEW SAUCE, for general purposes, having
given such great satisfaction, continues to be prepared by them, and
is recommended as a must useful and convenient Sauce—will keen
good in all climates.—Warehouse, 107, Strand, corner of the Savoy

OR~ COUGHS.—PECTORAL
OF COLTSFOOT The herb Coltsfoot has long been distin-
guished for its excellent properties in the cure of Coughs, and other
Pulmonary Complaints; and this essence has, in the course of a long
practice, been found the most safe and effectual remedy for Coughs,
and all Disorders of the Lungs. It gently opens the Breast, and im-
mediately gives liberty of breathing, without any danger of taking
cold,and thus it affords great relief in Asthmatic Complaints. It
allays the tickling which provokes frequent coughing, cleanses the
small glands, relaxes the fibres, and thereby enlarges (he cavities of
the vessels. Thus it will prevent Consumptions, if taken before the
Lungs are ulcerated. It softens husky and dry Coughs, and heals
rawness and soreness of the Chest.—The Pectora' Essence is prepared
by James Ryan, Surgeon, in Bristol; and sold in Bottles at 2s. 9d. and
Ss. fid. each, by F. Newbery and Sons, 45, St. Paul’s Church Yard ; J.
Sanger, 150, Oxford-street, London; W. Pegg, Sun Fire-office, 29,

OYAL PORTABLE FfITeR^(TEORGE
ROBINS, PATENTEE.—This unique and much eulogized
Invention, which has met with the warmest approbation from the fir-.t
medical and chymicai authorities of this country and the Continent,
will be found rapidly to purify and render of Crystalline brilliancy
the most turgid, fetid, and disgusting liquid supplied to the inhabit-
ants of the metropolis, and many of the provincial cities and towns,
under the denomination of water; depriving it of every noxious in-
gredient, render! g it alike destitute of taste and smell, by absorbing
those minute animalcuhe, decomposed vegetable particles, metallic
and earthy substances, which water, even in its purest stale, previous
to its subjection to the Royal Filter, is found to contain; and which,
according to the opinion of numerous physicians and surgeons, are the
Incipient causes of a vast variety of complaints, among which stand
most prominent. Bile, Calculous Diseases, Complaints of the Stomach,
Spasmodic Affections, &c. Ac.; and it is an acknowledged fact,
founded upon accurate observation, that families using the Royal
Filler nre rarely subject to illness.

and rendering crystal the worst water, may be obtained at the follow-
ing prices, handsomely ornamented:—

44 We have ourselves reaped no inconsiderable pleasure trom a pe-

and spirited ; its views are, in general, sound and impartial; and the
materials ably and lucidly condensed. It. is written as it ought to he—
not for a party, but for the people, and, as such, we trust it wil! be
appreciated.”- New Monthly Magazine.

SATURDAY EVENING, APRIL 2.
There is still reason to believe that the news of the entry
of the Austrians into Bologna was premature, and even if it
has now taken place, nothing but a determination on the
part of Austria to provoke hostilities from France, will pre-
vent an accommodation between the two countries. The
French Cabinet are said to entertain no very strong feelings
on the subject of the Austrian occupation of Bologna, except
as regards the national honour; for it. can easily be con-
ceived that the safety of France is not at all menaced by such
a movement, as it would be in Turin and Piedmont. On the
other hand, the Austrians can have no motive for occupying
Bologna, unless they are disposed to encourage the tyranny
of the Papal Government against the inhabitants of that State
—a motive which we can hardly suspect them to entertain.
There can be no dishonour, therefore, in retractation on their
part, and we sincerely trust that the difference may end in the
joint determination of France and Austria to compel the Pope
to shew more liberality to the Bolognese than they have lately
experienced. The Papal Government ought to concede some-
thing to the spirit of the times. Cardinal Gonzalvi would
do so if he were living, and the Pope cannot expect to main-
tain his temporal power by means which, even in the last cen-
tury, were found too odious for the Bolognese to submit 10.
The French will do themselves great honour by an interference
which is calculated to produce so favourable a result, and we
cannot believe that the Emperor of Austria will be so un-
wise and ungenerous as to quarrel with France merely be-
cause she objects to a principle of intervention which has for
its object the maintenance of despotism in countries with
which he has no direct and positive connection.
We have received German Papers to the 21st ult- They
do not contain any notice of the intention of the Austrians to
occupy Bologna. We subjoin a few extracts: —
“ VIENNA, March 19.
“ Reports have been received from General Baron Frimont, by
which we learn that Parma was occupied, on the 13th, by the
Imperial troops. The brigade of Major-General Straboosky had
moved from Piacenza for this purpose, and the Commander-in-
Chief had ordered Colonel Baron d’Aspte to support the move-
ments of Major-General Strabooeky, by advancing from Modena
by way of Rizzio. Baron d’Aspre executed this movement with
such promptness and decision that he tvas already at the gates of
Parma at five o’clock in the morning of the 13th ; and the ap-
pearance of his first patrol of hussars having thrown the cowardly
revolutionary government into the greatest consternation, and
caused the National Guard to disband itself, the Colonel took
possession of the city without any resistance whatever; and the
brigade of General Straboosky arrived in the course of the day.
“ With respect to what took place in Parma during the last
few days, before the entrance of the Imperial troops, we learn
that already, on the 9th, the Provisional Government in that city
gave public notice that it had dissolved itself. The greatest
alarm and confusion prevailed in the city ; the members of the
dissolved rebel Government attempted to take flight, hut the
two carriages in which they rode were stopped by the populace
and brought hack to the palace of the Government, amidst cries
of * Death to the traitors ! Death to the wretches who abandon
us in the moment of danger!’
•* At the same time some hundred young men, who thought
themselves most implicated in consequence of the part they had
taken in the revolution, had precipitately left the city, intending
to take the road to Bologna. After some parleying, the members
of the Provisional Government, who were trembling for their
lives, were released on promising to resume their functions, and
messengers were dispatched after the young men, to persuade
them to return to Parma: they were already six Italian miles
from the city, and were with much entreaty induced to come
back. On the 10th and 11th confusion and anarchy were at the
height: the city gates were shut, by no means for the pur-
pose of defending it, but merely to make it more easy for the
leaders of the revolution to collect all the horses for their flight.
“ SWITZERLAND, March 19.
*• The General-in-Chief, by a circular of the sth instant, has
called on the cantons speedily to organise two-thirds contingent,
that is to say, the first half of the Landwehr, conformably to the
resolutions lately adopted by the Diet.
41 Several Frenchmen of the Carlist party have lately remitted
considerable sums to Geneva, announcing their intention of
coming themselves to settle there.
“ MUNICH, March 21.
“ According to the report made on the 17th by Count d’Arman-
sperg, the Minister of Finance, to the Chamber of Deputies, re-
specting the Sinking Fund, the debts of the State will he dimi-
nished by five millions of florins, and the interest by half a
million between this time and the end of the second financial
period.
*• A certain number of men, of every regiment now absent on
leave, are called to their colours for the usual exercise. The
new recruits are to be immediately exercised.

“ CITY, Twelve o’Clock.
“ The Consol Market is a little higher to-day than on
Thursday, in consequence of the prices from France, received
yesterday, shewing a slight improvement. Tire opening price
this morning was 77f, and some business was afterwards done
at 771 s j they have, however, since then declined a little, and
are now quoted at 7711.
“ Some doubts appear to be entertained here of the Aus-
trians having entered Bologna, although the Paris Letters of
Wednesday do not seem to participate in that feeling.
“ The following is an extract of a letter from the Agent of
Lloyd’s, at Rio, dated Jan. 24 :
“ * His Majesty’s ship Lightning sailed to-day for Cape Frio,
with a diving bell, to endeavour to recover part of the dollars on
board the Thetis frigate, of which there are pretty good hopes.’
“ In consequence of this letter, several policies have been
written this morning at Lloyd’s, at 7.5 per cent, premium.

Court of Chancery.—After the Lord Chancellor had
delivered several j udgments this morning, William Brougham,
Esq. (the Lord Chancellor’s brother) who has been recently
appointed a Master in Chancery, was introduced to his
Lordship with the usual formalities, and sworn into office.
This morning, precisely at nine o’clock, the remains of the
Earl of Coventry were removed from his late mansion, at
the corner of Engine-street, Piccadilly, for interment in the
family vault at Croome, in Worcestershire.
The French Ambassador, accompanied by M. Perrier, who
has recently arrived in town from Paris, visited Earl Grey
yesterday at the Treasury, and had a long conference with his
Lordship.
It appears, fr»m a parliamentary return, that the net amount
of malt drawback paid on proof spirits in Scotland, during
the last year (under the 6th George IV. cap. 58.), was
334,446/. 14s. Bd.; in Ireland, 7,328/. 19s. 2Jd. The number
of Imperial gallons on which it was paid in Scotland was
6,021,556; and in Ireland, 127,248. The total net amount
of malt drawback, paid up to the slh of January, 1831 (under
the Acts 1 and 2 Geo. IV. cap. 82., 4 Geo. IV. cap. 94, and
6 Geo. IV. cap. 58), was—in Scotland, 1,896,502/.; and in
Ireland, 40,835/.
The Marquis Camden stated in the House of Lords on
Monday, that “ A great portion of the inhabitants of Kent
were not in favour of the reform bill.” Before we accuse the
Noble Marquis offalsehood,we would ask him what he means
by the term “ a great portion ?” If he means one in five
hundred or a thousand, we will grant that he is right. —Kent

Prince Talleyrand and Prince Esterhazy have had several
interviews lately, relative to the reported entry of the Austrians
in Bologna. On Thursday they were in conference for a very

lo show the Austrian Cabinet, as well as the French, its true
interests. —Court Journal.
We are glad to state, upon good authority, that it is the in-
tention of the British and French Cabinets lo pro'est against
the proposed dismemberment of Poland, by the Emperor of
Russia. We believe we may venture to add, that British in-
fluence will be used to obtain for the Poles the constitution
which was promised by the Emperor Alexander, and in ex-
pectation of which Lord Castiereagh consented to the ar-
rangements respecting Poland, which were made by the Con-
gress at Vienna.— lbid.
On Wednesday night, or rather on Thursday morning,
when the House had been nearly “ left to Rickman and to
Lee”—and to the Speaker—a new writ was ordered for
Malton, in the room of the liberal ex-Attorney-General, Sir
James Scarlett, who, having sighed again “ to take office
under the Crown,” has accepted the Stewardship of his Ma-
jesty’s “ Chillern Hundreds,” the salary of the just steward
of such place being 365. 6d. per annum ! The electors, it is
said, intend to vote the rigid defender and honest adminis-
trator of ex-officios, and the upholder of rotten boroughs,
their “ thanks” and “ a thousand tears.” —Morning Herald.
A correspondent informs us that the Marquis of Cleveland
has subscribed 300/. for the relief of the distressed miners in
Teesdale, a western district of the county of Durham, in
addition to the large sum of 1,200/. appropriated by his

district into Cumberland; thus affording employment to
those who are able and willing to work, and improving the
communication of the country at one and the same time.—

A seizure of thirty tubs of contraband spirits was made,
on Saturday noon last, near the North Shore Battery, at the
mouth of Sandwich Haven, by the officers of the customs.
They were s»en floating in the bay, and were no doubt washed
up by the strong sea then running. The blockade men and
officers were that morning removed, pursuant to the new
regulations for guarding the coast, and the stations were
completely deserted.— Kentish Gazette.
Three lurce covered waggons arrived in this town a few

Between four and five o’clock on Thursday morning some
thieves entered the house of Mr. Tucker, pastry-cook and con "

with pastry, jellies, &c. On leaving the house they made some
noise which awoke Mrs. Tucker, and on looking out at the window
she saw two men staggering about as if intoxicated, and thinking
the noise proceeded from them, she went to bed again and heard
no more. „ . _ , „ ,

TO THE EDITOR OF THE COURIER.
Brighton, April 1, 1831.
Sir—Y’ou are probably aware that various attempts have been
made by persons of some intluence to mislead the mind of the
Sovereign upon the subject of the Reform Bill. I may mention as
a specimen of the sort of interference to which I allude, one cir-
cumstance, which, though it sufficiently shows how little the
persons in question are acquainted with the character of our kind
hearted Monarch, also proves to what artifices certain parties
are forced to resort. An attempt has been made to induce his
Majesty to believe that the reform bill, by introducing a demo-
cratical system, would tend to deprive the King of his just rights,
and detract from the dignity and splendour of his throne. I need
not say how utterly this supposition is destitute of foundation.
The absurdity refutes itself; hut absurdity is no palliation for
wickedness; and, although convinced that all such attempts to
defeat the bill will be futile, X think it right to bring it under your
notice, as the Editor of a Paper which has always supported the
just rights of both King and people, in order that, through you,
the public may he made acquainted with it.
I am, Sir, your obedient servant, R. G.
[We are very much obliged to our correspondent R. G.
for his letter, but we think it was hardly necessary to allude
seriously to the pitiful attempt in question. There is nothing
in the Reform Bill which is calculated to lower, but much lo
raise, the dignity of the Throne; and it manifests sad ignorance
of the character of the British nation to suppose that it would
refuse to give the King what he is willing to receive, after his
magnanimous refusal to receive what it was willing to
give. The monarchical principle in this country is too strong
for any well-founded apprehension to be entertained that a
system of representation which would give the people a more
direct voice in the Legislature, would have the effect of
lowering the Crown in their estimation, and of diminishing
the small (for it is small, considering the extent of our popu-
lation and resources) amount allowed for the support of the
Royal Dignity. If any reasonable fear could be entertained
on this subject, it would be that the people, with the pride
natural to the inhabitants of a rich country, and in their
anxiety to show their respect for the Sovereign, would be for
giving too much. It is perfectly absurd to imagine that
they would attempt to reduce the revenue of the Crown in
any reign; and, so far as the present Sovereign is concerned,
we are quite sure, to use a homely phrase, that if he could
eat pearls and drink melted diamonds, the people would be
rather pleased than displeased to pay for them.]
POSITION OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY IN POLAND.
A correct idea is not generally entertained of the situation of
this army. The plan of the Russian Commander has signally
failed. He had reckoned on the continuance of the ice during
the months of February and March, and thought therefore that
he could easily transport his army and its immense materiel
over the Vistula and Bug, and traverse the marshes with the
same facility. The sudden thaw has destroyed these expecta-
tions; and the determined resistance of a handful of brave
men has placed the Russian army, surrounded as it is by
swamps and marshes, in the most difficult situation ima-
ginable. After the brilliant actions in the end of February,
the Polish army repassed the Vistula, whilst the enemy was
unable to offer any interruption to this movement, notwith-
standing the immense numerical superiority of the Russians.
In fact, General Diebitsch was unable to manoeuvre in such
marshy ground, broken up by the melting of the snow, the
columns of an army harrassed by fatigue the men, and particu-
larly the horses of which, were without sufficient food for some
days. It is now admitted on all hands, that the Russians are
suffering from the scarcity of provision. If the theatre of
the war were Bavaria, Wurlemberg, or Saxony, which are
fertile countries, intersected by good roads, where constant
communication might be kept up, the belligerents could
effect their movements sure of being followed by their con-
voys, and to find, in other respects, from the resources of the
country itself, subsistence for their men and horses. It is
quite different, however, in Poland, and particularly on the
right bank of the Vistula, where there are immense marshes
and lakes. The following table represents, in Polish
miles, each about two-thirds of a hector, the extent of
the lakes and marshes;—The Palatinate of Augustow, by
which the Russian army entered Poland, contains 28,530
acres of lakes, rnd 71,340 of marshes. The Palatinate
of Plock, in which the army is now manoeuvring, has
1,680 acres 'of lakes and 20,550 of marshes. The Pala-
tinate of Warsaw, in which the battles of February were
fought, contains 2,280 acres of lakes and 8,550 of marshes.
The Palatinates of Augustow, Plock, and Podlachia, oc-
cupied by the Russian army, are thus the least fertile and
most thinly inhabited, owing certainly to the marshy and
watery nature of the soil. The same remark applies to the
small portion of the Palatinate of Warsaw, which is
situate on the right bank of the Vistula, and which
extends to the Bug. The Russian army has, it would
appear from this, taken up its position at a dis-
tance of sixty or eighty leagues from Bialystock and
Grodno, in which its principal magazines are, and in a coun-
try where you may travel four or five leagues without meeting
even a miserable village—without passable roads—surrounded
by marshes, and in the midst of a hostile population. Suppos-
ing that it had formed intermediate depots of provisions and
forage, stationed at only five days’ journey from the
army, let us calculate the enormous materiel neces-
sary for bringing the daily subsistence to the troops.
The total force consists, it is said, of 200,000 men, includ-
ing over 20,000 cavalry. The consumption of each man
being estimated at two pounds weight daily, in corn or other
substances, and a half pound being allowed for the quarter
of a pint of spirits, without which the Russian soldier cannot
fight, it follows that the total weight of provisions for one day,
for 200,000 men, is 3,000 quintals, and for five days 25,000
quintals, the transport of which would require 1,250 wag-
gons or carriages, drawn by four horses each. The same
number of carriages must regularly return empty, so that in
fact 2,500 carriages and 10,000 horses would be necessary
for the conveyance of the supplies. The procuring
of forage for the horses is still more embarrassing.—
Independently of the 20,000 cavalry horses and the waggon
horses, there are at least 5,000 artillery horses for a park of
400 guiis and 400 carriages, and above 5,000 horses for the
staff officers of the regiments. Fifteen thousand horses are
necessary for drawing from four to five thousand carriages,
containing the daily forage, making a total of 50,000
horses. Each horse consumes at least 18 pounds Weight
daily in hay and oats ; that is 9,000 quintals in each day.
and 45,000 quintals in five days. It would require 2,250
carriages to bring that weight of forage from the nearest
depot, whilst <he same number of carriages would be on their
way back empty, making altogether four thousand five hun-
dred carriages necessary for this second service. It may
well be conceived what confusion would have been occa-
sioned, even during the frost, by the constant passage of
7,000 carriages through the bad roads, on the right bank of
the Vistula, to secure from day to day the very existence of
the army, which was represented as so formidable; but since
the thaw these roads must be actually impassable, and the
Russians must be reduced lo starvation. Their present po-
sition, therefore, is not tenable, and any reinforcement of
troops will only increase their distress. Should General
Diebitsch effect immediately the crossing of the Vistula,
near Plock, as some imagine he wishes to do, he
will find on the left bank of the river a sandy coun-
try and a more fertile soil; but the Polish army will doubt-
less take advantage of it, and organise on that account a
more formidable resistance, as the nature of the country
will leave them free to make their manoeuvres, whilst the
Russians cannot attempt the passage of the river except at
evident disadvantage. —Le Temps.
We lament that we have to record another instance of that
diabolical spirit which how infests this country, and which we
had hoped was disappearing from amongst us. On Wednesday
morning, about half-past four o’clock, the barn of the Rev. J. H.
Groome, at Earl-soham Rectory, was discovered to be on fire,
and before any assistance could be given, the entire building was
in flames, and by six o’clock not a vestige of the barn remained
standing. We grieve to add, that a poor cow and calf perished
in the flames, whilst two other cows were saved with great dif-
ficulty, and not without being severely burned. The barn con-
tained a quantity of straw, together with a cart and a few farm-
ing implements, which form the loss sustained on this melancholy
occasion. The property, we hear, was insured in the Equitable
Office at Norwich. We have not heard that the remotest sus-
picion rests upon any individual.— lpswich Paper,

RIOTOUS PROCEEDINGS IN EDINBURGH.
( From the Scotsman .)
There was a strong desire on the part of the inhabitants of
Edinburgh, to testify their joy by a general illumination, should
the vote of the Commons issue in favour of Lord John Russell’s
bill of reform. When the news of its success did arrive on
Friday afternoon, several houses were illuminated a few hours
after the arrival of the mail, hut as some time for preparation is
requisite in every case where a public demonstration is to be
made, Monday evening began to talked of as the most
convenient for a general illumination. The majority of the
Magistrates, as we stated before, being inimical to the
reform hill, it was not to he expected that any official
’ notice w r ould he given of the intended rejoicings. A
great number of the “ sovereign people,” however, repaired
to their tallow-chandlers and tinsmiths; while others, with a
conscientious regard for 44 the powers that be,” which is not to
he discommended, hesitated to sound the note of preparation, in
the hope that some recommendation would ultimately emanate
from the authorities. The indecision and vacillation of the Ma-
gistrates who assembled was more ridiculous than many will
believe. After a good deal of discussion, it was decided by a
majority that printed notices should be circulated, dissuading;
from any illumination. These notices were partly printed oft’,
when the pressman got orders to stop. Another meeting of the
gentlemen had subsequently taken place, and one or two persons
high in authority voting in favour ot the rejoicings being allowed
to proceed, it was ultimately agreed to print hills recommending
that the illumination should be general.
In place of a bold-typed magisterial proclamation, the petty
sheet was no bigger than the small handbills announcing a sate
of furniture 4i by warrant of the sheriff,” and before a naif of
these notices were posted the city was in a blaze. The backward
denizens, who had waited on this order in council, and who, of
course, had no oil in theii lamps in proper time, were now in a
plight really deplorable. Cups filled with salt, bored potatoes,
clay, nails, and other temporary apparatus, had all to be used as
candlesticks after their kind; nevertheless, to the credit of the
citizens, although a paucity of lights in several real “ reform
windows” was the consequence of the above neglect of the autho-
rities, the illumination, by eight o’clock, gave ample evidence of
the universal and splendid triumph of liberal feeling in the city
of Edinburgh.
The emblematical figures and transparencies, from want of time,
were of course not so numerous as we have seen on former occa-
sions ; but still a great many very appropriate devices were dis-
played, and were examined and remarked upon with much satis-
faction by the assembled thousands who thronged every principal
street in the city.
We are sorry at having to announce, that when the evening
was somewhat advanced, a number of blackguard boys, joined by
some ignorant fellows more advanced in years, broke in upon the
harmony of the evening by smashing a number of the windows
where no lights were exhibited. Most of the rioters were ex-
cited with whisky, and of course their depredations were as indis-
criminate as destructive, for some windows were broken in which
lights were burning. The police, assisted by the High Constables,
captured a few of the ringleaders, but not till a good deal
of damage was done by the reckless young rascals who created
the disturbance. It was a general belief that no misdemeanour
would be committed on this occasion; but the hesitation and
indecision of the Magistrates up to the eleventh hour, coupled
with the late vote of the county against reform, and the still
more aggravated insults offered to the people of Scotland else-
where, by certain political bipeds who disgrace the name of
Legislators,—all tended to awaken feelings of disgust which the
respectable inhabitants would disdain to vent in outrage,
but which it might almost have been expected, the less-infoimed
would take the first opportunity to avenge. On the
whole, the damage done is not, under all the circum-
stances, so very overwhelming, for the City Member’s sine-
cure for one year would more than repair all the mischief done.
The streets were literally crowded with both beauty and fashion,
all interested, while themselves were interesting, in the scene ;
and of course there can be no lack of respectable witnesses to tell
to succeeding generations the happiness and splendour that en-
veloped Edinburgh, on the occasion of the British people becom-
ing once more a free nation.
There is no doubt that a mere handful of ragged boys did nearly
all the mischief. In Great King-street, after the smashing of the
vyindows was just begun, three private gentlemen assailed the
rioters, and dispersed them, and saved all the rest of the street.
A very small extra force, we believe, would have crushed them.
We understand it was the natural son of an M.P., an opponent
to reform, who headed and urged on the young blackguards in
their depredations on Monday evening. He was convicted be-
fore the sitting Magistrate, and fined 10/. besides finding sureties,
to keep the peace.
The following is an abridgment of the account given of these
disturbances by the Edinburgh Evening Courant :
An illumination took place on Monday night, in consequence
of the success of the Reform Bill, which we regret to state,
was accompanied by the grossest scenes of outrage. Many of
the best friends of the measure were ot opinion, that in its pre-
sent stage, any demonstration of joy by illumination was un-
called for and premature, while the anti-reformers were natu-
rally averse to an expression of satisfaction under any circum-
stances. There was, in consequence, considerable hesitation
and doubt, and in the forenoon the Magistrates had printed si
notice judiciously advising the inhabitants to defer any illumi-
nation until the passing of the bill. But this notice, we under-
stand, was not issued. In the meantime, many among the more
zealous friends of the measure were still determined to illumi-
nate, and began to make preparations by cleaning their windows,
&c.; and in consequence a notice was issued in the afternoon
from the Sheriff and Magistrates, intimating to the inhabitants,
that as a great number had determined to illuminate, it would he
advisable, in order to preserve the peace of the city, that the
illumination should he general. As far as we can judge, the
inhabitants, generally speaking, were indisposed for any marked
expression of theirjfeelings, from an idea that it was premature,
and that the passing of the bill through the Lower House was
the proper time for such a general demonstration of joy. They
were still farther perplexed by the vacillating resolutions of
the Magistrates ; and, in consequence, many houses in the
New Town were not lighted. cases, however, the
order of the Magistrates was obeyed, and there was a ge-
neral, though far from such a brilliant display of lights as would
have been exhibited if earlier notice had been given, and if the
measure had been finally passed into a law. In the Old Town,
there was a greater appearance of preparation, and of sponta-
neous zeal; every window, and all the humblest dwellings, were
fully lighted up.
Very early in the evening the mob began to manifest symp-
toms of riot; and a crowd of blackguards collected, who were in-
tent on mischief, and determined, as usual, to wreak their ven-
geance on the non-illuminated houses. Having collected stones
at the Calton Hill, they entered the Canongate, and broke the
windows of every *m-illuminated house as they passed along.
They afterwards received a large accession of boys and lads, a
great proportion consisting of bakers, glaziers, and others of the
working classes, and proceeded along the principal streets of the
New Town, pouring vollies of stones into every house that was
not lighted, into many warehouses, into house.-, many of them un-
tenanted, though they were protected by torch-bearers, from
whom they w'rested their torches, and bore them about the streets
openly, and in triumph. Another hand collected between nine
and ten o’clock at the Royal Institution, the windows of which
they destroyed, and proceeded with loud shouts, breaking the
windows as they went along ; and, contrary to all former prece-
dent, attacking the torch-hearers who stood as a protection be-
fore many houses. The dilapidated state of numerous elegant
mansions throughout the New Town, on Tuesday morning, bore
testimony to the outrages of the previous night.
From sixteen to twenty persons were apprehended in the course
of the evening by the police. Seven of them were fined from
51. to 10/. ; two were dismissed for want of evidence ; the others
are to undergo examination.
Dundee was generally illuminated on Monday evening ; but a
scuffle took place between the police and a party of the inhabit-
ants who were dragging up an old boat they had procured from
a ship-master, for the purpose of making a bonfire at the Cross.
The police, thinking the boat had been surreptitiously carried
away, interfered, and from twenty to thirty of the inhabitants
were taken prisoners and lodged in the police office, from which,
we understand, after examination, the greater part of them were
released that night. On Tuesday evening the police office was
beset by the populace, broken into, the prisoners released, and
the books and whole of the interior furnishings burned. No
lives were lost, and no farther injury, we understand, was
sustained. On Wednesday morning all was as quiet as if nothing
of the kind had occurred. Caledonian Mercury . In reference
to these proceedings, the Glasgow Chronicle says, “ We hiar
that the guard of the Perth mail mentions that the mob
in Dundee had, on Monday night, proceeded to the most
violent extremities—having set fire to the police-office, which, it
is said, was burned down, and the whole of the police books
destroyed. A dispatch was sent, off to Perth for military, but
they could not be procured, and it was found necessary to send
to Edinburgh for a party of horsemen. A report is prevalent in
toVn that there have been serious disturbances in Ayr, and that
the Provost had been very severely handled.”
There was a splendid illumination at Glasgow on Monday
evening, in consequence of the second reading of the reform bill.
There w T ere also illuminations in many other towns in Scotland
the same evening.


FASHION AND VARIETIES.
Windsor, April 1. —Their Majesties and Household attended
Divine Service in the Grand Music Room, which was fitted up
for the occasion : after service was performed by the Bishop of
Chichester, their Majesties, Princess Augusta, and the Landgra-
vine, received the Sacrament. At three o’clock this afternoon
the King took a carriage airing, accompanied by the Landgravine
and Princess Augusta, proceeding by Peascod-street towards
Winkfield, and returning by King’s-road. Prince George, Mr.
W r ood, Lady Freemantle, Sir A. D’Este, Miss Wilson, Miss
Bagot, Sir A. Barnard, and remainder of the suite, left at the
same time on horseback. Her Majesty did not ride out this
afternoon, but attended divine service at St. George’s Chapel,
which was performed by the Honourable and Reverend C. H.
Oust, the canon in residence. The Bishop of Chichester remains
at the Castle and will perform divine service on Sunday next,
when their Majesties and the Princesses again intend receiving
the Sacrament. We hear it is the intention of their Majesties to
issue cards for a grand ball, which is intended to take place in
the new ball-room, Windsor Castle, on the 24th of October next.
Upwards of 1,000 invitations are to be given. Prince George
gives a Fete Champetre to all the Eton gentlemen, in the Little
Park below the New Terrace, in the early part of the summer.
The fete is intended to be on the most magnificent scale.
It is hardly necessary to say, that the reports which have been
current about the King’s health were unfounded. His Majesty
has merely had a slight attack of abdominal irritation, requiring
neither confinement nor particular treatment. It would have
been surprising indeed, if, during the late severe weather, the
King had been the only person of his age to escape inconvenience.

A Bushel of Good Fellows.— The Editor of the New York
paper, in a recent excursion from the city, skimmed over the
east river in a steam-boat, belonging to one Mr. Peck, landed
on the w'harf of another Mr. Peck, hired a barouche of a third
Mr. Peck, and dined at the hotel of a fourth Mr. Peck.— Boston

There is to be no Easter ball this year. Three years ago it w r as
determined by the Chief Magistrate, in consequence of the very
great nuisance occasioned by the crowding of “ all sorts” toge-
ther, and the sharp contests for refreshments, to afford a prece-
dent for a total extinction of the City Easter ball. The present
Lord Mayor is determined to follow' the example, but has been
much beset by applicants for tickets, it being generally, but erro-
neously, supposed that the immense influx of evening City visi-
tors would be agreeable to the distinguished guests who are to
dine with his Lordship.
Arabian Tradition. —The Ashahir-Ras (the presumed an-
cestors of the Russians) had a well which furnished them w’ith
w-ater sufficient to irrigate their ground, and a just King w’hom
they deeply regretted after his death. After some time, the
devil appeared to them in the shape of the defunct King, and
said to them, ** lam not dead, but I absented myself from you
to witness your grief.” At this they were exceedingly delighted.
He then ordered them to interpose a veil betw'een the people and
himself, and pretended that he should never die. The greater
part of them believed and worshipped him. God sent a pro-
phet to announce to them, that it was the devil w'ho w r as
talking to them from behind the veil, and to turn them from his
W’orship. He ordered them to adore the only God, who had no
associate. They reproached the prophet, killed him, and threw’
Jiim into the well. Immediately, the w'ater disappeared, drought
prevailed, the trees dried up, the fruits fell to the ground, the
•country became a desert, and the inhabitants w r ere changed into
wild beasts.— Hammer's Russian Origines.
Paganini still continues his astonishing performances in Palis,
where his last concert produced nearly 23,000 francs. It w*as
really ludicrous, on that occasion, at the conclusion of his piece,
to see his audience all standing, themselves being perfectly un-
aware that they had changed their position; it was an involun-
tary homage to his pow’ers, w'hich had “ lapped them in Elysium.”
The enthusiastic French declare that they are perfectly uncon-
scious of their actions during his spirit-stirring passages.
Population of Rome. —The Diario di Roma has published the
following statement of the population of Rome, during the tw'elve
months which elapsed between Easter, 1829, and Easter, 1830:
Parish churches, 54; Families, 34,805; Bishops, 30; Priests*
1,455 ; Monks and Friars, 1,986 ; Nuns, 1,385; Seminarists and
560 ; Heretics, Turks, and Infidels, exclusively of
Jews, 266 ; Prepared for the Sacrament, 107,433 ; Not prepared
for the Sacrament, 39,852 ; Marriages, 1,068 ; Male baptisms
"2,339, female baptisms 2,351—t0tal baptisms, 4,690; Male deaths
female deaths 2,113 —total deaths, 4.995 ; Males of all
ages, 77,475; Females of all ages, 69,810; Total population,
147,385. From this table, compared with those of preceding
years, it appears that in Rome, in the year 1830, the population
bad increased by 2,744 souls; the births, in proportion to the
whole population were, 1 to about 31 4-10ths : the deaths, 1 to
about 29 5-10ths ; the births of males and the births of females
nearly equal ; the births in proportion to the deaths, 1 to 6 6-
lOths ; the marriages in proportion to the births, 1 to 4 4-10ths ;
the average number of births amounted to 391 a month, or 13 a
day; the average number of deaths amounted to 416 a month,
or 14 a day.
When Fuseli tendered himself for the office of Keeper of the
Royal Academy, Northcote and Opie voted against him ; but
being conscience-stricken, not only on account of his abilities,
but from having received favours at his hands, they considered it
right to call upon him the next day after the election, to explain
their motives. After having heard them, and their explanation,
they in some degree blamed each other ; he answered in his
usual sarcastic manner, “ lam sorry you have taken this trouble,
because I shall lose my character in the neighbourhood. When
you entered my house, the one must have been taken for a little
Jew creditor, and the other for a bum-bailiff : so good morning.’*
At the commencement of the seventeenth century the taste of i
the Dutch for tulips became an actual passion, and accordingly
these flow'ers reached an extravagant price. The tulip called 1
Vive le Roi w'as estimated at 250 louis; that styled VAmhal ]
Lieskens w'as worth 440 louis ; and the Semper Augustus w’as
valued at 550 louis. In 1637 a collection of tulips sold for <
90,000 louis. The tulip most in esteem was the Semper Augustus. '
One w*as sold for 1,300 louis, and three bulbous roots of that '
•particular flower were disposed of for 1,000 louis each. This 1
traffic in tulips acquired such activity, became so extravagant ]
and general, that the Government was obliged to interfere for :
the purpose of arresting the folly, and it gave a terrible blow to J
the speculations in tulips, by an ordinance w'hich declared in-
valid all contracts relative to these flow'ers. The price fell in- !
stantly.— Courrier des Electeurs.
Empirics.— Were W'e to judge by what we see and hear, by the c
number of the empirics with which we are infested, by the 1
silence of the law on the offences they commit, and by the very *
general encouragement which they obtain from our enlightened
countrymen, one would imagine that medicine was nothing better *
than a game of chances, which every fool may gain at, and that S
physicians are little better than useless encumbrances, which I
merit neither protection nor reward.— Westminster Review for
April . J *

Liberty and Equality. —The Duke of Saxe-Weimar, travell-

Talma.—l once heard Talma, in a moment of anger and indig-
nation—l mean in real life—utter three words, which, if so given
on the stage, would have electrified the audience ; for, as it was,
they shook the nerves of a gens d’arme. I was going with him
to the Theatre Francais, to see him act Falkland (Sir Edward
Mortimer ). The shortest cut into the theatre was by the public
entrance; so he made his way through the crowd (I following
him) till he reached the door. As the doors were not yet open
to the public, the centinel on duty, not knowing the tragedian,
advanced with the usual word of order, “ Ne passe pas !” at the
same time barring the way with his carbine. Talma, indignant
at the interruption, fell back one step, drew himself up to his
extremist height, stiuck his breast six or seven times in rapid
succession, and, his eyes flashing fue, thundered out, “ Je suis
Talma!” with a long continued emphasis on the last syllable.
The centinel literally let his piece fall from his hands, drew back
to the very wall, and we passed on.—“ After-Dinner Chat.”—

The Revolted Cities of Italy. —Parma, one of the revolted
cities of Italy, covers a considerable area, its walls being be-
tween three and four miles in circumference, and contains a
population amounting to between 30,000 and 35,000 souls.
Almost every other building is a church; but of these
churches, though all are rich within, few* are finished without—a
fact of common occurrence in Italy. The miserable little shops,,
the silent streets of Parma, shew no traces of its ancient com-
merce, when its market supplied wool to Europe. Now it ex-
hibits only a hopeless indolence and a torpid inactivity. A little
raw silk, and the cheese which is found so much better every
where than in the district whence it takes its name, form the
whole exports of the Parmesan states; and the only visible
symptoms of internal trade are festoons of macaroni, and the
swinging pewter basin which vibrates over the barber's shop. The
barber of Italian towns is still a character, and differs little from the
important personage who,in remoter times, gave heroes to comedy,
and intriguants to novels. His shop alone is secure of custom,
where all must shave sometimes, and where no one shaves him-
self. While the barber’s shop is the emporium of news and the
mart of trade in the morning, the cafe, after the church, seemed
to be, in Parma, the principal place of resort to persons of all
ranks. These cafes, modelled upon the French, and about as
splendid as such festive rendezvous are in a third-rate provincial
town in France, are still the gayest things in Parma. In an attic
apartment of the Farnese palace, the traveller is shown the
splendid Parisian wardrobe of the ex-empress of France. Mas-
sive toilet-tables of or-molu; a beautifully sculptured mirror;
the cot of the young “ King of Rome,” of mother-
of-pearl inlaid with gold ; vases and basins of solid
silvei, washed with gold : these and other articles of
imperial luxury, the memorials of fallen greatness, together
with Napoleon’s travelling bedstead, and various other things
belonging to him, are here fondly or ostentatiously preserved by
the present sovereign of Parma. Her Majesty (for she still re-
tains that high style) resides principally at her country villa at
Colorno, ten miles north of Parma, visiting the capital only during
the carnival. She is said to be much beloved by her subjects.—
Modena, ano‘her of the lately revolutionised cities, which has
been much embellished within the last fifty years, has a very hand-
some and cleanly appearance, together with an air of gaiety and
i veliness, which bespeaks it to be the residence of a court. The
recent improvements (chiefly in the Strada Maestra) have di-
vided it into the new and the old city. The ducal library, well
known under the name of the Biblioteca Estense, contains sixty
thousand volumes, and is esteemed highly valuable. It was
formed of the Ferrara library, to which great additions have been
made ; and two of the most eminent literati which Italy has pro-
duced in modern times, have successively filled the office of
librarian here—Muratori, born at Vignola in this duchy, at the
beginning of the last century, and Tiraboschi, a native of Ber-
gamo, about 1780. The picture gallery, though despoiled of some
of its most celebrated pictures, is still one of the finest collec-
tions in Italy. Bologna has been always of a strangely republi-
can cast, and worn its papal chains with a good deal of scorn : it
has prospered accordingly. On approaching the city, the country
gradually improves, and becomes better wooded. The extreme
fertility of the rich plain in whicli it stands is indicated by the
heaviness of the grain, the height and vigour of the full-eared
maize, and the incomparably fine growth of the hemp. In the
neatness of the cottages, the careful husbandry, and the general
appearance of the population, there are also signs of a greater
degre t e of prosperity than in almost any other part of Italy. The
Bolognese has always been the most flourishing of the four
papal legations; owing, Bishop Burnet tells us, to its peculiar
constitution. “ For Bologna,” he says, “ delivered itself to the
popedom upon a capitulation, by which there are many privileges
reserved to it. Crimes, there, are only punished in the persons
of those who commit them ; but there are no confiscations of
estates; and though the authority in criminal matters belong to
the pope, and is managed by a legate and his officers, yet, the
civil government, the magistracy, and the powers of judicature
in civil matters, are entirely in the hands of the state.
By this regulation it is, that, as the riches of Bo-
logna amaze a stranger, it being neither a navigable
river, nor the centre of a sovereignty where a court is kept;
m, the Pope draw's much more (in tuxes) from this place of li-
berty than from those whose authority is unlimited and absolute,
but that are almost quite abandoned.” Another favourable cir-
cumstance is, that the sale of the monastic property during the
occupation of the French has greatly multiplied the number of
the smaller landed proprietors, and raised up a thriving agricul-
tural population. In one respect, however, that revolution has
'ed to disastrous results. It has afforded opportunity and pre-
text to the restored government for depriving the Bolognese ol
most of their ancient privileges. By a papal rescript, dated July 6,
1816, the popular magistracy and tribunals, the ancient faculties,
the government of the militia, the right of coining money, and
the right of popular election, wmre cancelled and annulled ; and
Bologna is now subject to the same laws and regulations as the
rest of the states of the church. Bologna is picturesquely situ-
ated at the base of the Appennines; the lleno passes through
the city, and the Savena washes its walls. It is sur-
rounded with a high brick wall, about six (Italian) miles in cir-
cuit, and contains a population of between 60,000 and 70,000
souls. On approaching the city, its curious leaning tow'ers and
high antique* spires, with the singular arcade leading up to the
church of the Madonna di San Luca, perched on a steep hill over-
hanging the Reno, have a singular and striking effect. Though one
of the oldest cities in Italy, it is one of the best preserved, and has
a venerable appearance, without being ruinous. Its streets are lined
with arcades, affording a covered footway on each side, as at
Padua and Modena. If less elegant in appearance than the latter
city, it has nothing of the monotonous, sombre character of the
former. Its fine lofty arcades are supported on well-proportioned
columns, and the architecture is in better taste, more finished,
and on a larger scale. The city abounds with large churches and
handsome palaces; and if these are not distinguished by any very
striking architectural excellence, the general style is good, and
the effect pleasing.
Admiral Benbow— Scarcely had he returned from hisjservice in
Carthagena, when the prospect of war with France determined the
English Ministers to dispatch a stronger force to the West Indies.
They advised the King to send Benbow’ once more ; but to this
his Majesty objected, considering it ungenerous to so zealous an
officer, to give him no respite, while others lay idle on shore.
This service, how'ever, being relished by none of those to whom
the command was successively offered and declined, the King,
half offended with his Ministers, turned merrily round upon
them, and, alluding to the foppery of dress and manners exhibited
by some of the naval officers of that day, said, “ Well, then, ]
see we must spare our beaux, and send honest Benbow.” Being
summoned to the royal presence, the King asked if he were
willing to return to the West Indies ; graciously observing, that
he should forfeit none of his favour if he declined to go. Benbow',
though not insensible of his Sovereign’s considerate regard for
JPIJK replied, “ No, sire, I do not understand such compliments.
When your Majesty wants my services, 1 have no right to
choose. I am ready to sail immediately to any quarter of the
world to w'hich your Majesty maybe pleased to send me.”
Having thus accepted the command, and relieved the embarrass-
ment of the King’s Ministers, the Vice-Admiral hoisted his flag,
in August 1701, and on the 24th (w r e quote from the narrative of
a person on board the Breda), a light breeze carried him once
more within hail of the sternmost ship of the enemy, upon which
he fired a broadside of double and round below, and of partridge
aloft, w'hich was returned. At three in the morning the Admiral’s
right leg was knocked to pieces by a chain-shot and he was
carried below'. While the surgeon w T as at work with him, one
of his lieutenants endeavoured to console him; upon which
Benbow replied, “ I am sorry for it too ; but I would rather have
lost both my legs than have seen this dishonour brought on the
English nation. And hear me, should another shot, deprive me
of life, behave like men, and fight it out while the ship can
swim.” He immediately ordered his cradle on the quarter-deck,
and thus continued the fight till daybreak, when their antagonist
ship exhibited terrible proofs of the effect of their fire. The
enemy, seeing Benbow' still deserted, bore down in a body be-
tween her and the Breda, firing all their broadsides into her, and
towing oft their disabled ship, which he was in no condition to
prevent, though he follow’ed them still with all the sail he could
carry, enforcing the battle-signal, w'hich was alw'ays out, by
firmir shot at his own treacherous deserters.—(Extracted from a
Work, recently published.)

t 11E Lottery in France. —The first lotteries were introduced <
in Paris in 1640, by a man named Chuyes, a native of Lyons, a ’
goldbeater. This Chuyes, who was famous for his long travels j
* and his extraordinary intelligence, published 1 little book enti-
tied “ The Guide to the Streets of Paris, arranged alphabetically.”
At the period of the introduction of lotteries in France they were
in great vogue in Italy, Holland, and at Grand Cairo. Originally
the lottery was a mode by which old wares, and articles that
remained unsold in the ships, were got rid of; these were
mixed up with pieces of gold, silver, and jewels, all which
were divided into several lots, and therefore it was that the
Italians styled it lottaria and lotteria. Chuyes wished to call it
» by the same name, but his associates, among whom was M, de
Vaugelas, opposed him. Vaugelas conducted the speculation, and
, hoped to make sufficient by it to pay his debts. He desired tc
give all possible eclat to it, and to announce it by the imposing
name Blanque Roy ale. Alter much solicitations and intrigue, he
established his lottery under authority from the King in 1644.
l But numerous complaints, the fickleness of our tastes, a voyage
to the Indies, undertaken rather hastily by Cieur Chuyes,
the death of M. de Vaugelas, followed by a blockade
( and disturbances in Paris, caused the suspension of this
establishment, which indeed was about to be abolished, il
the pressing exertions of M. and Madame de Scudery had not
procured the transfer of it to Sieurs Carton and Boulanger, upon
an understanding that they were to have a share in the profits.
The new comers, more enterprising perhaps than their prede-
cessors, made no difficulty about calling it by the name of lottery ,
and that word became a very passion. These schemers supplied
themselves with articles of property of every description. It ap-
pears from one inventory that they had 23 lots—lo grand ones,
and 13 minor ones. The lowest was estimated at 15,000 francs,
and the most valuable was worth 276,000 francs. They bud, be-
sides, four libraries, tapestry of the most rare description, anc.
an infinite variety of the most precious articles. Sauval says that
they had, among other things, a prodigious quantity of agates,
rubies, emeralds, diamonds, and paintings by Leonard du Vinci,
Titian, Poussin, See. All these riches were exposed in a magnificent
hotel at the end of the street de Bethesey, and commonly called
the Hotel d’Anjou. The proprietors kept an open table, and al.
the usual means were adopted to attract people ; nevertheless,
after all their efforts, they only obtained a profit of 30,000 livres.

Good Italian Pronunciation. — I will venture to affirm that,
on this side the Alps, there is no country in Europe whose na-
tives have so little to learn, or to unlearn, in acquiring a good
Italian pronunciation, as the English. We have neither the gqttu-
rals of the German and Spaniard, nor the mute vowels and nasal
n’s of the French, to get rid of ; there is scarcely a sound in the
Italian language which we are not in the daily habit of uttering,
and nearly our whole task would be confined to the learning oi
certain conventional alphabetical symbols, which represent one
sound in English, and another in Italian. Away, then, with
the jargonal pretence that English singers cannot acquire a
good and pure Italian pronunciation ; make it worth their while,
open the stage-doors of the King’s Theatre to the native artist,
and you will soon find talent more than enough. —Correspondent

VAN DIEMEN’S LAND.
At a time when the views of so many are turned towards the
colonies with intentions of emigrating, we have great pleasure in
laying before our readers one of the correctest accounts of thekhow-
ledge and experience of a settler in Van Diemen’s Land, that has
yet oeen laid before the public ;
January 1, 1830.
We arrived at Hobart Town the last week in November, after
a voyage rather long ; but not altogether unpleasant. We were
obliged to remain on board rather more than a week, not being
able to obtain any lodging ; these, as well as every other neces-
saries, being rare and extremely dear to strangers ; for instance,
beer is Is. per quart, mutton 5d., and beef Bd. per lb., when the
sheep is not more than at the rate of Id. per lb. After endea-
vouring, in vain, to dispose of what merchandize I brought, (the
prices, even at retail, being no more than 1 gave, in some in-
stances not so much,) I resolved on keeping them all, and serving
them out to my servants when they wanted clothing, or ex-
changing the things of a different description with the
farmers for corn or cattle, and set out on an expe-
dition to discover a situation fit to take as my grant.
1 was allowed 2560 acres, the largest quantity given
to any settler. I travelled altogether above 350 miles, as
far as 40 miles to westward of Launceston, -where I was stopped
by the rise of a river, it having rained almost every day 1 was
out —so that I could tell of narrow escapes in swimming my
aorse—of thunder and lightning in a trackless plain—of savages,
and many other disagreeables which I leave for a better oppor-
tunity, being just in the midst of bustle, as you will hear pre-
sently—even at that distance I could find nothing suitable. Mr.
Ball’s grant (800 acres), and a reserve, if he receives more re-
mittances from England, was not more distant than the other
side of the river (which 1 could not pass) ; it is said to be very
;oou soil: but the country is wet and cold in winter, and subject
to summer frosts ; the two former qualities 1 can vouch for,
having ridden ten miles above my horse’s fetlocks in water ; be-
sides this, the distance is such, that a cart cannot carry produce
and return from the nearest town under four days, there being
no symptom of a road for nearly twenty miles, so the carriage
■roukl cost as much as the corn would produce, and there is not
any market whatever for dairy produce, although butter is so dear,
for no one but a stranger will buy. I was so much annoyed, that
1 most certainly would have returned to England, if I had been
ible to have lived there. In this predicament, after having spent
above 750/. of my capital, I met with a gentleman, Mr. Thomas,
the Colonial Treasurer, who wished to exchange a grant he has
near (that is, within twenty miles of) Launceston, on the high
road to Hobart Town, of 2,100 acres, for a nomination to a grant
near his own residence, not otherwise of much value, for which
exchange, besides the difference in acres, I have paid 150/. 1
had much difficulty in being allowed to exchange,—before settling,
the land-board refused it, but the Governor writing to them that
1 intended to become a bona fide settler, I got permission, and
immediately, on the 28th of December, started in four carts,
drawn by four and six bullocks each, with an awning over one
for the family. In this way we made 80 miles a day, pitching
>ur tent in the middle of the day, and again at night, to boil our
dinner and.supper, and to sleep under, dividing our party into
of every two hours. We arrived last night at our farm,
which has a most pleasant appearance; it is bounded by the
jouth Esk River for four miles and a quarter, which, however,
aow and then overflows about 700 acres of the best land, and will
lo so until I shall have money enough to embank it.
We left there our free servant men and our sons, John and
Lewis, under tents, and proceeded to Mr. Hobbes’, whose land-
less to us has been most extraordinary and never-to-be-forgotten,
lie has a most valuable estate, for which he gave 1,100/., and could
iow get 3,500/. William has got a place in the Attorney-General’s
office, of 120/. per annum, but I doubt if he is altogether capable
of it, but a good character and decent behaviour, in this coun-
try, make up for many deficiencies in a young man. The
Governor has behaved very civilly; he desires me to say to
\lr. Marshall, that he should always be most happy to hear
rom him ; and, in consequence of his letter, be should be glad
to do me any service, but as I said I did not intend to
apply for any place, 1 have not done so, either for myself or
son, though a place is asked for by almost every one who has
the smallest recommendation, and as they are very numerous it
is seldom long before they get something, which something, how-
ever small, is very valuable in a place where 1 believe every one is
ibliged to layout every farthing he can raise, and more, to bring his
land into profit. The rate ofinterest on landed security is 15, some-
times 20, on every other 25 and 30 ; 1 could send home, clear ten
percent., on as certain security as any in England, if any one
wished to place money in that way. lam very sorry that I
brought out merchandize, and that 1 brought out female servants ;
they become more saucy and lazy than the prisoners, and yon
cannot punish them—besides the free cost (at least 20/ per an-
num), more than the prisoners, which I shall feel most severely.
1 do not wish any who may read this to consider my present opi-
nion of value, because the trouble, expense, and vexation of the
voyage, and other difficulties, may have prejudiced me ; but 1
just now think that it is beneficial only as a lottery might be, and
requires a much greater capital than I’bave, at least 1800/. be-
yond the expense of the voyage. If I had not met with this
chance in Mr. Thomas’s wish to concentrate his property, I must
have gone into a dreary desert, where produce would be scarce
of any use for the term of my life, and where society could not
be ever hoped for, nor medical assistance in sickness. The
settlers in my neighbourhood have requested me to become a
Magistrate, which I should like very well, but cannot afford
time. As I find military title the chief source of distinction, 1
call myself Captain, to which I have a title, having been re-
turned by the Secretary at War to the Land Board as a half-pay
Captiin, by exchange with Captain Walker—so direct to me
Captain.
P.S. Medical men make at present immense profits, but they
arrive closely, and there are some hopes that a man may soon
wish to recover, for at present he may as well die at once as to
have a Doctor’ bill to discharge.
Henrietta Plains, April 10, 1830.
I am now situated about 20 miles from Launceston, in the high
road to Hobart Town. My place is bounded on front, for 4J
miles, by the South Esk ; it runs back three miles to very high
ind barren hills; has on one side for a neighbour, a Mr. Gibson,
formerly a convict, since condemned to be hanged as a bush-
ranger, but reprieved, now a man of great extent of property,
visited by the Governor and wife, and is generally esteemed
to be a good sort of man. On the other side a Mr. Wedge, al-
ways a farmer, a good plain man, very poor, with 11 children,
his wife and five of them not having yet joined him. About 800
acres of this is marsh, of very excellent quality, but being sub-
ject to the overflowing of the South Esk, a most troublesome ! i
river, so low in dry weather that your cattle are always crossing i (
it, and so rauchraised by every rain of a few days’ duration as ■ *
to mount eight feet above its banks. About 200 acres of this I
marsh is higher than the rest, and would be most excellent '
arable ground, the soil being so rich as never to require manure, j •
The fencing would cost 200/. if banked properly. The remainder c
can only be used (except about forty acres in front of the house), ! *
where I began ploughing yesterday, as summer pasture (seven
months), unless I went to the expense of about 600/., of making a *
bank as well as a fence all round it ; it would then feed some j c
bundredsof bullocks and thousands of sheep, all the year, with the N
issistance of the remaining 1,200 of wood, which is of rather poor -
quality in general, but interspersed with rich patches, so that al- c
together I have a promising estate, if I had sufficient capital to 1
enclose it properly. The wood or forest is in great part ?
watta, of which more grows here, and of greater size than usual', P
which, besides its instrinsic value, is in general a sign of good
land. The bark I could strip on this place would fetch many
• thousands if in England, and many hundreds here—but I fear I
> shall not have money to spare to hire carts, and pay for stripping
it. My present stock consists of 16 bullocks, 7 cows, and 7
calves /altogether do not give a pail of milk) ; one mare, 3 pigs,
F dogs, for which I have to pay a tax of 50s. ; 400 sheep on thirds;
100 lambs of my own (common sort to kill) ; an I 60 Saxon
bred ewes and their lambs, which I have given 75/. for—but
are not yet delivered. I could have kept 1,000 more very
easily, which would be lent to me by any one for payment
yearly ot 40 lambs for 100 ewes. This would in the course of a
year amply supply me with mutton ; but an inconsiderate pro-
mise I made to the person of whom 1 had the place, prevents
me : he said, I do not know what I shall do with my sheep till I
have fixed on your grant. And 1 told him he might keep them
line or ten months on my ground, as I should not have many my-
self : to my surprise I found about 3,000 sheep on the premises,
mough to devour the whole estate. I sent oft’ 1,000, but did not
• ike to break my promise, so I kept the rest, and, in consequence,
diall have to buy for two years to come instead of one. I
pitched my tent on the Ist of January, and sent my wife, ser-
vant maids, and little children on to Launceston. It took some
time, a month at least, to get up my heavy baggage (by sea) ;
md the carpenter and sawyer lent me by Government: and just
is 1 was ready to begin work in earnest, I was seized with a vio-
ent sore throat and fever, and could not get out of bed for above
three weeks, so thatjhe inner wall of my house commenced on
:he 2d of March only, and it is now within a week or so of being
covered in, but little or nothing done to the inside. I have built
it ot Pise or rammed earth, to which I have added (I hope an
improvement) strong wooden pillars, sunk in the ground to keep
die walls upright and square (having no mason or architects but
the common labourers and myself.) It will be a better house for
comfort, and at less expense, than most in the Colony. And if
I had lived in a hut instead of it, the filth and dirt, the waste
and breakage occasioned by all things being huddled together,
would have (indeed they have already) spoilt as much as the
house cost. It is 42 feet by 18 feet; a parlour on each side (one
if which will at present be used as a kitchen till I can finish my
ouilding); a lobby, staircase, and store room in the centre ; a
louble chimney in each parlour, so that the kitchen, when built,
■vill be at the back of one, and the wash-house at the back of the
other ; the man servant’s room in the centre. This will be a
shed only, or a shilling as it is called here ; there will be a
gallery in front, and two at the sides—one for a dairy, and the
other tor serving out rations : the expense will be about 150/. in
all, including the price of nails, tools, and other articles for that
purpose brought from England. I said that this would be a good
place, with sufficient capital to cultivate it properly: 1,000/. in
your stiong box, after building your house, would do—and
would ensure a repayment of the capital in three years—but with
less you must have very uphill and uncertain work. I had as
near as possible about 2,000/., including every kind of property,
on leaving Kingsbridge ; the delay and expense there, the heavy
passage-money and expenses at Hobart Town, the removal
of my baggage to my farm, &c., have been beyond what you can
imagine : and I have, for the good of those who may think of
emigrating with a large family, sent a general statement of my
expenses to this date, which I believe to be correct: fencingjhe
land is the most necessary expense, and very expensive it is—
not less than five shillings per sixteen fod. If you only fence
your corn, you lose all your cattle—and until you have sown with
English grass seeds, which cannot be done but in small quan-
tities, and when done will not support sheep in such flocks as to
pay or even support your family, you must have a very large
run. 1 have a week at a time bunting for mine when I
wanted them particularly to bring home wood for the sawyers, or
to fetch corn from the mill. The articles you bring from Eng-
land are of use as far as this, to prevent your buying at an
enormous price, &c., to exchange now and then with a neigh-
bour, at very good profit, for cattle—but if you want the money
for them as merchandize they do not answer, so many of your
things not suiting, as to destroy the small profit on those that do
—for instance, of 1,500 cwt. of nails which I brought out, not one
half will sell at all—but I found them of great use on my build-
ing ; and if I did not want money for other purposes, 1 should be
a loser even by them—the same by other things—so many lost*
so many spoiled. 1 bad, I think, better have brought out money „
51y servants have, with the exception of Stancombe, been very
ungrateful /one of the female servants has left me, and I shall
most probably lose about 25/. by her—the other will only stay till
she can get married, which will be shortly, and you must not
dare speak to her or she threatens to go immediately. They have
both been wasteful, exorbitant, and extravagant bejond con-
ception, and it is no use to attempt to keep them against their
will; they spoil every thing, and when reproved, say, well, if you
can find better, lam ready to go. My carpenter that I took
almost from starvation, finding, or imagining that he could do
better, is looking out. for another place, in the hope that bp
also will be able to get off and cheat me of about 60/., which
he cost me to get him here: this I must resist, and shall
send him to gaol unless he gets some one to advance tb«
money for him, but for the women I could not find the
heart to reduce to poverty and disgrace. I had rather lose the
money —so I have told them, tha~ though 1 consider then* very
wicked and ungrateful, I should not injure them, but that t
never wished to see their faces again, unless they should he
real distress, when my house would be open to them, and that J
should not require any money from them till they were in a situ*
ation to pay. I must, however, except Stancombe, who works
as hard as a slave, and is neverdiscontented. He begs you to say
to his friends, that he is in good health ; but, as he has no more
time than myself, and cannot write quite so fast, he roast give
up the idea at present.

• HARMEII AND another v. westmacott and wipe.
Lhis case, which was an application by the assignees of Ri-
chard Downing Richards, late editor and proprietor of the Age
Sunday newspaper for an injunction to restrain the defendant.
Mr. Westmacott and his wife (otherwise Ann Durham) from
taking any part in the management of that Journal, and for the
appointment of a receiver and manager pending the suit in equity
was argued at length on a former day.
The Loud Chancellor, after going through all the facts of the
case, as already reported, and reviewing the conduct of Richards,
observed, that in no instance bad he treated any part of the con-,
cern as his own property after the sale to the defendant, if,
therefore, Richards had so far coincided in the sale, could his
assignees be placed in a better position 1 His Lordship was of
opinion they could not, and that was a sufficient reason for re -
fusing the application.
Counsel on the part of the defendants applied for costs.
The Lord Chancellor —l cannot allow costs, for there are
many things in the transaction which are not at all satisfactory.
It was ultimately agreed that the costs of the application should
he costs in die cause.

WESTMINSTER SESSIONS.— (Thu Day.)
At the Westminster Sessions this morning seven young lads
the eldest of whom did not appear to be more than twelve years
of age, were indicted for stealing several different articles of
trilling value. Most of them were stolen from the shop windows
where they were exposed forsale. CharlesJohnsonwoa convicted of
stealing a handkerchief, the property of a gentleman named
Grove. He had been tried three times before for a similar of-
fence, and acquitted, since October last. The Court sentenced
him to six months’ imprisonment, and to be twice whipped.
Two men, named Wescott and Jones, were indicted for fraudu-
lently obtaining 3s. 2d. from a gentleman named Sparks by ear-
; ■ ing a parcel, purporting to come from the White Horse, Fetter-
lane, to him, and charging 3s. 2d. thereon as porterage.
Mr. Sparks stated, that on the Ist of March, the prisoner Jones
brought a parcel to him, and stating that it came from the White
Horse, Fetter-lane, and that the charge for porterage was 3s. 2d.
he produced a ticket, and witness paid him the money. Front
some suspicion witness had, the parcel was immediately opened,,
and was found to contain a piece of old carpetting and a piece
of old oil cloth. The prisoner was pursued, and was taken into
custody in company with the other man. The parcel was di-
rected to a gentleman named Fell, who lodged in witness’s house.
The porter at the York Hotel stated, that from inquiries he
had made at the White Horse Cellar, he had discovered that the
tickets found upon the prisoners were complete forgeries, printed
for the purpose, and that during the winter they had been de-
frauded no less than sixty times in a similar manner at their
hotel.
The prisoners were found guilty.
The Chairman said it was a very serious offence, and t, en
tenced them to be transported beyond the seas for thq » ‘
seven years. " 1

A novel scene was presented in the great room of the Anctif n
Mart, on Thursday evening, arising out of the sale of a freehold
estate in Jamaica, and one hundred and ninety negroes. When
the property was submitted, in the usual way, two persors of
respectable appearance protested against file sale, and denounced
it as irreligious, unjust, and illegal, on the ground that negroes
could not and ought not to be bought and sold, and that whoever
should become purchaser, would have a curse upon his head.
Mr. George Robins, the auctioneer, good-humouredly bore their
continued interruption for some time, but so pertinacious was
their opposition to the sale, that it was hinted to them that legal
measures might be resorted to against them for depreciating the
property. This caution, however, had no effect, both continuing
to the end of the sale in affirming that the Divine vengeance
would infallibly fp.ll on the head of the buyer,


I The county of Clare is certairly in an uncomfortable state; but
there is no truth in the statement which is going the round of the
tapers, that additional troops are on their march. There is a
military force already in that county adequate to all exigencies ;
and we trust that no further instances will occur ofpusillanimous
surrender of arms by the gentry to the midnight disturbers of the
peace. The stout formers act otherwise.— Dublin Paper.
In Barren, the fences dividing the different farms have been
completely levelled ; and cattle stray promiscuously over the
country. The peasantry declare they will not allow any cattle to
leave Clare for the next Ballinasloe fair. They say they will eat
them themselves sooner than they shall be sold for the benefit of
those who are living out of the country, whilst they are starving
at home.— Limerick Evening Post.
In our paper of yesterday we mentioned a rumour, that two
regiments, the 76th and 9S2d, were under immediate orders to
proceed to Clare. We have since learned that both these corps
had actually received such an order on Tuesday evening ; but it
was countermanded yesterday morning, as far as regarded the
92d. The 76th hourly expect the route. We have learned that
an application was made on Tuesday afternoon, to the Directors
of the Grand CanaTCompany, to ascertain whether boats could

Distress of the Irish Poor. — Although we have had occasion
often to deplore the calamitous condition of the poor of this coun-
try; yet we have been in some degree consoled by witnessing the
instances of charitable interference which such an unhappy state
of tilings calls forth ; and the pleasing duty now devolves on us of
noticing the praiseworthy promptitude with which the Irish Go-
vernment have hastened to relieve the suiferers. They have
freighted from Guernsey four vessels of potatoes, two of which,
Colonel Connolly, with a munificent liberality which reflects
credit on him, and proves him to be a gentleman actuated by
true Christian benevolence and active charity, has purchased at
his own expense, to distribute amongst the poor of Killibegs.
The other two are destined for Westport.— Dublin Paper.
Pour Scotch regiments of militia are to come over to Ireland,
so soon as sufficiently advanced in discipline, and many of the
reserves will be moved to the opposite side of the water. —

Outrages in Kilkenny On Monday last, in the middle of
the day, an outrage was committed on a process-server of the
name of Edward Wall, who lives at Ballyraggett, in this county;
on that day Wall proceeded to the lands of Connahy, near the
above place, for the purpose of serving tithe processes at the
suit of the Rev. Doctor Butler, of Burnchureh, and, after having
delivered 11 of them, a young girl whom he met, cried out to
him, “ run away with your life, or you’U be murdered-” On.
looking about Wall observed an immense number of persons 1
coming towards him, upon which he instantly ran off, hut was
overtaken by 50 of them at Fox-cover, near Ballyraggett. They
there took from his person 42 processes, and the originals of
those he had previously served, and then dragged him in the
most violent manner across the country back to Connahy, where
they made him go to each house at which he had delivered a
process, and after rubbing it with soap, compelled him, on pain
of death, to swallow it. Two of the party then dug a grave, in
which they placed briers and furze-hushes, and threatened to
bury Wall and burn his body therein, if he did not swear never
again to serve a tithe process. They produced a book and swore
him to that effect, and told him “if he ever infringed on that
oath they knew where he lived, and that he might judge- his
doom.” After this some of the party laid hold of him and
dragged him to Oldtown, near Ballyraggett, where he had served
another process in the morning, on a person of the name of
Martin Shea; this they also procured, and made him swallow.
The mob now increased to between 200 and 300 persons, and we
understand Wall’s life would have fallen a sacrifice to the ven-
geance ofhis merciless assailants but for the interference of Shea.
A report prevailed in Ballyragget on Wednesday that Wall
was again going out to serve tithe processes, under protection of
the police, and the intelligence spread like wildfire through the
country. The most savage yells were heard in every direction,
and multitudes of men, women, and children, assembled on the
top of the several hills in that neighbourhood ; some well-dis-
posed persons, who wished not to join'in the business, were
forced from their work, and compelled to accompany them. As
goon as they ascertained that the report was without foundation,
these lawless assemblages thought proper to separate, and retire
to their respective homes.— Kilkenny Moderator.
On Tuesday a very violent attack was made on James Joyce,
a churchwarden for the parish of Knocktopher. He had been
serving summonses for church tax, and when passing near the
gate at Vicarsfield, the residence of the Rev. Dr. Hamilton, he
was seized on by several persons, mostly women, or men dressed
in women’s clothes, and dragged about and abused in the most
indecent manner, until at length he was enabled to escape into
Knocktopher.— lhid.
A driver on the estate of the Hon. C. B. Clarke, Wandesford,
was attacked and beaten near Castlecomer, on Wednesday last.

On Thursday night last a large barn and cow-house, at Kil-
derry, the property of Michael Ryan, were entirely burned to
the ground by some nocturnal miscreants. Kilderry is within
three miles of this city, and in the barony of Gowran.— lbid.
Galway. —The system of lawless combination is, unfortunately,
beginning to extend itself to our county. We noticed, hereto-
fore, apian pursued by the peasantry, peacefully indeed, still
dangerous—namely, fixing on grou ids a certain price, and forming
among themselves a resolution not to extend their biddings.
This is still acted on, and generally without violence— that is,
where others observe the rules; but those who violate them, or
strangers interfering, are visited with vengeance. At Gurty-
madden, a Mr. Ajax Clarke took land at five guineas per acre ;
the legislators decreed four pounds sufficient; besides, he was
an intruder, living in Longhrea. Notice to quit was instantly
served ; being unnoticed, his herd was visited—and, finally, poor
Ajax was forced to fly before the Trojans; having, besides, the
sad reflection thst he must pay the landlord for ground he dares
not sow. At Ballygreeve, near Ballinakill, notice was served on
Mr. Macklin that he should set his grounds at least one-third
beneath the rate usually given. In many other places, gemote
and unconnected, the same system has been adopted.— Western
Argus.
Roscommon. —Ten acres of wheat, the property of Sir John
Burke, of Marble hill, M.P., are said to have been dug up on
Saturday night last by some of our Parliamentary men in this
quarter. Mr. Killikelly, of Oatfield, is reported” to have been
plundered of his arms. Three houses in the parish of Moore,
hear Ballinasloe, in the county of Roscommon, were burnt by
the Rockites on Monday last.— lbid.
On Thursday night last, a school-house, which had been
erected by the Reverend Mr. Armstrong, Vicar of Kiltome, in
the county of Roscommon, was set on fire by some incendiaries,
and burned to the ground. A few nights previously a party of
Rockites visited the residence of the Reverend Gentleman, and,
after committing various depredations, took with them two four-
years-old sheep. The state of that part of the county, Ros-
common, is represented to he in open rebellion, and, unless the
Government have recourse to strong measures to check its pro-
gress, the lives of the gentry and clergy will be placed ia immi-
nent peril.— lbid,
LIVERPOOL. —Thursday.
(From the Second Editioti of the Liverpool Advertiser.)
A numerous and most respectable meeting of the friends of
William Ewart, Esq., was held this day, in the large room of
the King’s Arms Hotel, for the purpose of addressing him on the
late decision of the Parliamentary Committee. The room was
crowded in every part, and the warmest sympathy appeared to be
felt for the late Member for Liverpool.
James Buancker, Esq., was called to the chair by acclama-
tion, and, on presenting himself to the meeting, the applause
was loud and long continued. “ Gentlemen,” said Mr.
Brancker, “ whatever we may think of those who have stood
forward the hold and undisguised opponents of Mr. Ewart on the
late Parliamentary investigation, however we lament their suc-
cess, we must at least applaud.their sincerity ; but what can we
think of those who, afraid to show themselves in the blush of
day. skulk behind the curtain, and move the wires that regulate
the machinery 1” (Hear, hear.) Mr. Brancker then read the
following address ■ —
That this meeting laments the result of the late proceedings
before a Committee of the House of Commons.
That having the greatest confidence in the conduct and prin-
ciples of William Ewart, Esq., they pledge themselves to use
every legal constitutional effort to restore him to the eminent
post he so honourably and so satisfactorily filled, as their late
Representative in Parliament, whenever the Honourable House
may decide to issue a writ.
That a copy of these resolutions he communicated to William
Ewart, Esq., by the chairman, and published in each of the
Liverpool newspapeis.
The Rev. W. Shepherd seconded the address. He (Mr.
Shepherd) had seen much of Mr. Ewart since lus election ; their
acquaintance had ripened into friendship, for he had found him
talented, honourable, and trustworthy, and every way fitted to
be the organ of Liverpool in Parliament. (Cheers.) He had
come back earlier than they could wish. (A laugh.) The report
of the Committee, however, fixed no stigma upon him—he had
come forth pure from the ordeal. For this fact he had the high
testimony of the Lord Chancellor, who, in the House of Peers,
declared that the innocent had been made the victim—(Cheers )
that Mr. Ewart had been punished for the fault of others. They
had cheered him (Mr. Shepherd) when he said that Mr. Ewart
was not the first Member returned by certain means ; and their
cheers told him that what he had said was correct; hut a Mr.
Thomas Gladstone would make the public believe that Mr. Ewart
was the first who had bribed. (It is false,) He hoped the as-
sembly he had the honour to stand before would redress Mr.
Ewart’s wrongs ; and, although this might he the last time ho
could address the burgesses of Liverpool—for their franchises
were in danger—still, wherever the power of return might lay, he
trusted Mr. Ewart, would he placed in that proud position which
he would adorn by his talents, and not disgrace by his public
services. Mr. Shepherd Was loudly cheered at the conclusion
of his speech.
Several other Gentlemen addressed the meeting, and Mr.
Currie then proposed that thanks should he given to the Chair-
man for his able conduct in the Chair, which passed unanimously ;
after which three cheers were given for Mr. Ewart, and the
meeting separated.
On Friday evening last, a brush-maker of this town, named
Bishop Relphs, dropped down suddenly in the street: he rose up
on his legs, and again fell, and although he was promptly at-
tended to, life became extinct in the coitrse of a few minutes.
Verdict of the Coroner’s Inquest—“ Died by the visitation of
God.” — Nottingham Journal.
LENT ASSIZES.
At York, on Thursday, Charles and James Briggs were con-
victed of attacking and maliciously wounding William Legall,
on the King’s highway, with intent to murder him, or do him
some grievous bodily harm. It appeared that the prosecutor was
returning on horseback, on the night of the 9th of January, from
Doncaster to Hatfield, when he was knocked off his horse by
Charles Briggs, with a hedge stake, and beaten and kicked by
both prisoners. The prosecutor was so much weakened by the
injuries he received that he was obliged to creep part of the way
home. He had attended on Saturday week previous to give evi-
dence against a brother of the prisoners before the Magistrates at
Doncaster, and this, it was supposed, led to the attack on him.
—On the same day, Joseph Bottom, a very stupid looking youth,
was tried for forcibly entering the dwelling-house of Thomas
Longbottom, at Thornhilledge, and stealing a goose pie and a
piece of cake and butter. The prosecutor returned home from
chapel on Sunday evening, the 19th of December last, and
hearing some noise in the house, he seized his gun, and
called upon the intruder, whoever he was, to show himself.
The person advanced, and he cocked his gnn and fired. In the
next moment the prisoner stood before him, and said, “ Well,
Tommy, thou’st done for me.” He then turned round and made
a jump, like a Harlequin, to get through the window he had come
in, at, but deponent caught him by the foot, and held him. The
prisoner had taken the pie, the cake, and the butter, from the
pantry, and placed them on the table in the parlour, as if for the
purpose of regaling himself. Prosecutor examined the house,
and he believed “ the lad had made urter nought else but sum-
mit t’ eat.” He was sure it was the prisoner, for he examined
his wounds in the gaol, and saw where he had “ shooit him right
thro’the thoomb and the theagh!;.” When the prisoner was
called upon for his defence he said that he and his father had been
n long time out of work, and they were very poor; and, on Sun-
day evening, being at the chapel, and seeing the prosecutor come
in; “ summat struck him, as he war vera hungory, and had
nought that day but pint o’ beer, that, if he war to go to Measter
Lqngbottom’s hoose, he might get summat to eat.” The prose-
cutor was recalled by his Lordship, and asked if he kept any
money in his house 1 He replied, “ Yees, we wur seldom
wi’out a hit o’ summat down.” The prisoner was found guilty,
and the Judge said he would not pass a heavy sentence on him.
—Thomas Gregg, the fellow who gave false evidence against
Richard Needham, on a charge of setting fire to some stables,
was tried and convicted, on Wednesday, of having stolen twenty
one sheep, the property of William Faint, at Kepwith. The
Judge told him that tne offence of cattle stealing had become
so; common of late in Yorkshire as to make a severe example ne-
cessary.
William Andrews, aged 19, and Joseph Easton, aged 21, were
indicted at the Kingston assizes, for breaking and entering the
dwelling-house of George Michael Wilson, in Kennington, on
thp night of the 27th December, and stealing therein diamonds
and jewellery to the value of 5001.; and Charlotte Deans was
i barged with receiving the same property, knowing it to have
been stolen. Ann Barrow, an approver, stated, that she resided
in, the same house with the prisoners Easton and Deans, who
lived together as man and wife. Early in the morning of the 29th
Dec., Easton came home ; witness was then in bed with Deans.
.Easton was much flurried when he entered the room and whispered
something to Deans: she heard him distinctly say something
about a “ crack” (burglary) in Kennington-lane. On the fol-
lowing and subsequent days witness accompanied Deans to pawn
vdrious articles of jewellery.—Upwards of 20 pawnbrokers pro-
duced various articles belonging to the prosecutor, which had
been pawned by the prisoner Deans and her companion Barrow.
Several articles pawned by the prisoner Andrews were also pro-
duced and identified as the prosecutor’s property. All the pri-
soners were found Guilty. Deans was sentenced to be trans-
ported for fourteen years. Sentence was not passed upon the
male prisoners.
At the Taunton Assizes, on Thursday, John Baker Gould was
found guilty of having sacrilegiously stolen a silver tankard and
a silver cup from the parish church of Dulverton, the property
of the parishioners. The prisoner was arrested in Exeter by a
silversmith, to whom he had offered for sale parts of the plate as
old silver. He was sentenced to seven years’ transportation.—
Thomas Searle, aged 49, was charged with maliciously cutting
mid wounding Elizabeth Searle, his daughter, with intent to
murder her, or do her some grievous bodily harm. The little girl,
who is only twelve years old, stated that she had four sisters and
three brothers. She and her sister Hannah used to sleep with
tfleir lather, and they did so on the night of the 23d of September
last. Her father awoke her, and told her that he should-be ob-
liged to kill her, as the Holy Ghost had told him to do so ; and
be said that his watch, which the child heard, was the death-tick
for him and for her. He told her not to go to sleep, as he should
be obliged to kill her. She told him that she was sleepy; and he
replied that she should sleep all day the next day. She then said,
“ Father, you won’t kill me.” He replied, “ Yes, my dear, X
am obliged.” He then kicked against the bed, and told hei
that it was the devil who was coming up stairs to till
her, and he asked her if she should like to go to Heaven.
She replied, “ Yes, father, if it pleases God to take
me and you too.” The prisoner then got out of bed,
and she went to sleep. When she awoke again her
father was sitting at the side of the bed, with his
trousers and waistcoat on, looking very wild, and making
mouths. He pulled the bed-clothes, and then went out of the
room, and returned in five minutes. He then said, “ You told
me in the night, my dear, that you should like to go to Heaven ;
and should you V’ Witness said yes, if it pleased God to take
her. He asked her then to let him put his hand under her head.
He did so. He then pulled up her chin, and cut her throat. It
bled dreadfully. She screamed out, and her eldest sister came
up, and she, Elizabeth, did not see what she did, her father was
trying so hard to kill her. The poor child was here so overcome
by her feelings that she fainted, and was carried out of Court.
The wound was five inches long, but not very deep. The pri-
soner was acquitted on the ground of insanity, and was detained
until his Majesty's pleasure should be known respecting him.
—At the same Assizes an indictment was laid against Mr.
Dunn, a brewer residing in the parish of Walcot, Bath, for
libel on Mr. Howe, a church-warden of the same parish. The
libel was in the form of a letter, addressed to the Very Rev.
Archdeacon Moysey, the rector of the parish of Walcot, and was
in the following words :—“ Oct. 12, 1830. —Sir, As I have been
informed that you are going to bring one criminal before the
public, I hope you will bring two more : one for seducing two
sisters, the daughters of a once respectable farmer atLansdowne,
which brought them to poverty, misery, and affliction. After in-
vestigation you will be expected to give your opinion in the pub-
lic papers, which will oblige yours, obediently, A Parishioner.”
An attempt was made to prove that this letter was in the de-
fendant’s handwriting, but the evidence wholly failed in bringing
it home to him. The Jury returned a verdict for the defendant.
On Thursday, at the Chester A ssizes, an action of trespass was
tried, in which Whitby, a tenant of Sir Thomas Stanley, was
plaintiff’, and Stewart and Howorth, both residing in Liverpool,
were the defendants. The trespass complained of consisted in
the defendants going on the lands of the plaintiff', after notice,
to kill game. The Jury found for the plaintiff—Damages, Is.
—T here was a similar action by another tenant of Sir T. Stanley
against the same defendants, in which a like verdict was returned.
Wm. Foggan, aged 52, and Wm. Douglas Wallace, aged 26,
were indicted for having forged a bill of exchange for the sum of
29 1. 14s. at Stockport. On the 29th of September, in the even-
ing, the prisoner Foggan went into the shop of Messrs. Leake
and Marsh, of Stockport, and purchased some articles; and upon
being shown some woollen cloth, he said he would fetch a friend
who was a better judge of woollens than himself. He went out,
and in a few minutes returned with the prisoner Wallace, whom
lie called “ Doctor.” He then purchased cloth for a suit of
clothes for each, and got an invoice for the whole of his pur-
chases, which amounted to Hi. 75., in payment of which he ten-
dered the bill of exchange. After some inquiries had been made,
suspicion was excited, and the prisoners were given into cus-
tody. The Jury returned a verdict of Guilty of the uttering as
against the prisoner Foggan, and Not Guilty as to Wallace.
— De Hay t’. Foster.— This was an action of slander. The
plaintiff is a teacher of the French language at Macclesfield, and
the defendant the occupier of some lands near that town, bor-
dering upon Mr. Ryle’s park. On Sunday, the 17th of Oc-
tober, the plaintiff’ went out, as he said, se promener stir les
gazons fleuris —to take the air in the fields—and he happened
inadvertently to go over a hedge into the lands in the occu-
pation of the defendant. The defendant rode up, and rather
bluntly told the plaintiff to get out of his land, adding, “ if
you don’t get out quickly I’ll horsewhip you.” The plaintiff’,
not much relishing this John Bullish admonition, re-
plied, “ I challenge you to do it, you coward.” The
defendant rejoined, 1 ’ You are a d d thief, and i
will have you (before the magistrates to-morrow;” and these
were the slanderous words for which the action was brought.
Chief Justice T’indal told the Jury that the merely calling a man
“ a thief” was not of itself actionable, unless there were accom-
panying circumstances to show that the crime of felony was meant
to be imputed. The Jury immediately found for the defendant.
Threatening Letters.— The Middlesex Grand Jury have re-
turned a true bill against a gentleman of some property, named
Martin French, for the alleged offence of sending an anonymous
letter to Mr. Trotter, the brother-in-law of Air. Sinclair, of
Drury-lane Theatre, containing a threat that the writer would
cause him to be assassinated by shooting him with a pistol. Be-
sides the letter which is the subject of this indictment, both Mr.
I Sinclair and Mr. Trotter have been pestered with numerous
| others, the authors of which are unknown, hut all of which con-
tain threats of destroying one or both of those gentlemen, and of
setting fire to their joint property, the Tivoli Tea-gardens, at
Margate. The whole contents of these letters are written in
capital letters. They are evidently in a disguised hand, and
abound with mis-spellings ; hut many of them are such as an
ignorant man would not he likely to fall into, being capricious,
and not according to the pronunciation of the words. Another
peculiarity, and which more than any other seems to show they
are not the production of such a person, is, that the capital" V”
is repeatedly used instead of the “ U.” The tops, bottoms, and
margins of the letters, are ornamented with coffins, gibbets, and
a variety of other hieroglyphics, apparently intended to represent
the destruction of property by fire. The letters are addressed in
•the common writing style; the address runs thus—“ Mr. Sin-
clare, Box-offis. Drury-lane Theatur.”
On Saturday se’nnight, as Ann Winslade, a young woman of
Thurloxton, was walking through Burlinch, in the parish of West
Monkton, near Taunton, an adder stung her leg so severely, thal
before she could reach home the limb had swollen to double its
usual size, causing most intense pain. Medical assistance was
speedily called in, but it was not till Saturday that the symptoms
took a change for the better, and that a prospect of her recovery
presented itself. Sweet oil, it cannot be too generally known, is
the best application to the bite of venomous reptiles.
DANGEROUS NAVIGATION OF STEAM-BOATS.
On Thursday evening an application was made to Captain
Richbell, the silting magistrate at the Thames Police-office, for
a warrant against the master of the Earl of Liverpool steam ves-
sel, which runs between London and Calais, for going beyond
the legal speed of five miles per hour between London Bridge
and Limehouse reach.
It appeared from the statements of George Cradock and James
Haynes, watermen of Globe-stairs, Rotherhithe, and William
Thomas, in the employ of Messrs. Beech and Hibbert, coal
merchants, Chelsea, that about one o’clock that afternoon, the
Earl of Liverpool steam packet came up the river at the rapid
rate of upwards of eleven knots per hour, causing such a heavy
swell that the craft and boats were tossed about as in a rough
sea. Cradock and Haynes were in their wherries off the above
stairs as the steamer passed, and the boat of the latter was
turned completely over, and fell upon him. After receiving a
a good ducking, he with much difficulty scrambled out of the
water, narrowly escaping being drowned. Cradock’s boat was
also capsized by the heavy swell, and he was thrown out of it
into the river, and tossed to and fro against the other boats, until
quite exhausted. Some other watermen picked him up, and car-
ried him home. Haynes’s wherry was broken to pieces, and that
belonging to Cradock was stove, and sustained considerable
damage. A skiff belonging to Thomas, which he had recently
borrowed, his own being under repair, was turned bottom up-
wards, and so much injured, that it was rendered quite useless.
Thomas also experienced some personal injury. The watermen
declared that the velocity of the steamer surpassed any thing
they ever before witnessed, and had any boats been upon that
part of the river at the time, they must inevitably have been
swamped, and the persons in them drowned. Their means of
livelihood were now gone, in consequence of the injury done to
their boats.
Captain Richbell mentioned, that a few days since a large
barge, laden with 120 quarters of oats, was sunk near that office,
in consequence of the rapid rate at which a steamer passed it, and
the swell caused thereby. The men in the barge were immersed
in the stream, and narrowly escaped a watery grave. The boats
belonging to that establishment had also been injured and tossed
about by the illegal navigation of the steam-packets.
'i'he applicants not being able to prove that the master of the
Earl of Liverpool was a freeman of the Waterman’s Company, the
worthy Magistrate said he could only grant a warrant as for ? n
assault on one of the watermen, who was nearly drowned, nd
this he could do on the same principle of law by which the dr ver
of a vehicle is answerable for injuring another on the read,
through careless or furious driving.
A warrant was then granted.
A meeting of the creditors of Prior, late of the firm of Meux
and Co., brewers, was held a few days since at the Bankrupts’
Court. The chief assignee, Mr. Young, presided, and stated
that he had to make a communication from Meux and Co., who
had made a proposition that they would pay over to the creditors
a sum of 5,041/. Bs. 4d. in full satisfaction of all claims. Mr.
Morecock (an assignee) spoke against agreeing to the proposi-
tion. He had heard that in the first four years of the copartner-
ship of Meux and Co. in which Prior was connected, the profits
of the concern were not less than 61,000/., and that Prior’s share
would be 8,700/. That amount had been drawn down by Prior to
.>,OOO/. since the accounts of the firm were made out, Prior having
received a salary of 1,000/. a year, besides his share of profits.
Prior was to have brought a sum of money into the concern,
which he had not done up to the time fc heabsconded. He thought
that as in general breweries had latterly worked to a profit, the
creditors ought to have a better knowledge of the actual state
of the accounts between Prior and the firm of Meux and Co. A
lengthened discussion took place upon the question, and ulti-
mately the proposition was negatived. It was said that the total
claims against the bankrupt amount to more than 27,000/.
The Speculation in Tallow.— The injurious effects of the
extensive speculative transactions which have for some time
past been going on in Russian tallow are beginning to be felt by
those who entered into such business in favour of a fall in prices.
Two failures have occurred in consequence of the late advance
in prices, occasioned by the monopoly, by one or two great
liouses, of a large portion of the stock of tallow in the port of
London—the parties who have failed not. being able to obtain
tallow, which they had contracted to deliver, and not having
sufficient means to pay the difference in point of the value of the
article when the contract was made and the present high quota-
tion tallow bears—viz., from 475. 6d. to 475. 9d. per cwt. The
stock of tallow in this country is large compared to that in the
port of London at the corresponding period of last year. The
Hock now is about 43,500 casks ; last year, at this period, it was
only 24,500 casks. By the mercantile accounts received from St.
Petersburg, to the 16th of last month, it appears that great activity
prevailed there in the tallow trade. Since last post there had
been purchased 15,000 poods, and the total quantity already
bought for shipment to this country, as soon as the navigation
opens, was 30,000 casks. The price of tallow at St. Petersburg,
on the 15th ult., was 101 rubles per pood. It was expected that
the supply of tallow during the present year would be about
150,000 casks. The exchange upon London was 10|d. At the
dose of the last shipping season about 4,500 casks of tallow re-
named over.— Morning Paper.
Mr. William Harrop, of Wath-upon-Dearne, died a few days
igo from a fungus in the eye. It covered the greatest part of one
side of the face, depressing the eye-lid below the nose, and bled
t various times most profusely. It resembled in its appearance
a cluster of grapes, and when extirpated after death (by Mts.
lunop’s permission,) it weighed about a pound and a half.—
Doncaster Gazette.
On Thursday an inquest was held at St. Luke’s Hospital, on
he body of James Green, who came by his death under the fol-
lowing circumstances It appeared that the deceased was placed
vith seven other men in the same ward ; they had separate cribs,
and were under the care of two keepers, who had received orders
to fasten the men by one arm and one leg at night to their cribs.
On Tuesday night two of the men, named Barrett and Chapman,
ippearing to be very quiet, the keepers did not fasten them to their
ribs, and they were allowed free access to all parts of the ward.
In the morning the deceased, who had been fastened to his crib,
was found quite dead, with several wounds and bruises on his
bead and body, and Barrett was in his (deceased’s) crib. The
nedical gentlemen who had examined the body were of opinion
chat the deceased had died by suffocation. The Jury passed a
severe censure on the keepers for not securing the men to their
beds at night, and returned a verdict, “ That the deceased came
to his death by suffocation and personal violence, inflicted on him
by some person in the ward (supposed to he Barrett), but who
was in such a state of mind at the time as not to be capable of
knowing what he was doing.”
Yesterday evening a young woman threw herself out of a
wherry into the river, near Blackfriars-hridge. She was rescued
md taken to the Guy Earl of Warwick, the receiving-house of
he Royal Humane Society. Mr. Rose, one of the medical as-
sistants' of that establishment, and Mr. Westropp, the secretary
of the Institution, attended, and in four hours they had the sa-
tisfaction of restoring the woman to hei husband and family.
The Late Mysterious Affair near Oakham. —About a month
ago there appeared a paragraph in the Stamford Champion and
the News, stating that “ an old woman named Levison, who lately
lied at Braunston, near Oakham, made confession on her death
bed to the minister, that she, along with her then master, one
Smith, had been concerned in the bloody and cruel murder of a
beast-jobber, a stranger, who had come to her master’s residence
to receive money ; that she held his head whilst Smith heat out
bis brains with a coal-hammer.” Mr. W. Hinds, late a school-
uaster at Boston, having, about thirty years since, lost a cousin,
lamed Samuel Johnson, who disappeared in a very mysterious
nanner, seeing the above paragraph, immediately wrote to the
'.Minister of Braunston, for further information relative to the
murder, and that gentleman very politely answered his inquiries.
The result is, that Mr. Hinds has ascertained that the person
dms murdered was the identical beast-jobber, Johnson, who left
Trieston about Christmas, 1801, with considerable property,
and a quantity of cattle to sell at Smithfield-market, which it
low appears he sold ; and on his return called at Oakham to
neet Smith and a man named Hackett, to receive money for
beasts sold to them at Lammas previously. Hackett settled
vith him, hut Smith failed to come, and in consequence Johnson
went to Owston-lodge (about two or three miles from Oakham),
Smith's house, for the money, hut he never returned from
thence. Smith and the woman lately dead—whose name the
minister says is Leavi—robbed and cruelly murdered Johnson,
md buried his body in the stack-yard. Smith, who had pre-
viously been in indifferent circumstances, launched out into
business for some years, hut after a time he failed and died a
»auper, and was buried at the . expense of the parish. Smith
used annually to erect haystacks upon the place where Jie had
buried his murdered victim. On Smith leaving the place about
!i2 years ago, some men who were digging for gravel found the
bones of poor Johnson, and they were collected and interred in
Tnossington church-yard, about two miles from Owston Wood-
iodge, where they were found. Johnson was a man ot good cha-
racter, and had been intrusted with much cattle by many respect*
ible graziers round the neighbourhood of Freiston and Boston,
i t'is supposed that he had about him property to the amount of
1,600/. or 1,800/. The inhuman murderer Smith has been dead
five years last January, and his accomplice died only a few weeks
ago. Johnson’s uncle, who resided at Freiston, had made him-
mlf responsible to several graziers for the amount intrusted to
bis nephew, of whose integrity he had such an opinion, that he
laid 900/. to the graziers. ‘ Two letters, purporting to be written
!jy the deceased, but which at the time were generally believed to
be forgeries, were received by his friends at Freiston, stating
that he had hired himself to a butcher at Epping. It is supposed
these letters were written by the murderer for the purpose of
)iverting the attention of the deceased’s friends. Ihe above
iarrative proves that murder, although long hid, is generally dis-
covered, and brought to light; and though, in this instance, the
jjuilty parties escaped human justice, yet we find that a retri-
butive Providence visited one with all the miseries of poverty in
bis old age, and the other with all the horrors of a death-bed
repentance, , . .
On Friday last, Thomas Slaughter, aged only 18, underwent the
Ijist awful penalty of the law, at the drop over the front of the
county gaol at Worcester. He was convicted at the last Assizes
df setting fire to a large wheat rick, belonging to his mistress,
Mrs. Tomlinson, of Elmley Lovett.— Worcester Journal.
L pon the news of the second reading of the Reform Bill reach
mg Lyme, the bells rang, and persons in different parts of the
town began firing. A band paraded the streets at night; fire-
works were thrown up, &c. A large party assembled at the
three Cups Hotel, where a requisition was drawn up to the
Mayor, calling upon him to sanction a meeting for proposing

An inquest was held, yesterday evening, on the remains of a
young man named Robert Wright, who, it appeared, had fallen
from a vessel lying in the river, off Mill-stairs, and was drowned.
Verdict —Accidental death. The family of the deceased are
persons possessing considerable property in Yorkshire.
On Thursday evening an inquest was held at the Middlesex
Hospital, on the body of James Wines, aged seven years. The
deceased, on Wednesday afternoon, was crossing the load in
Oxford-street, when the the splinter-bar of a carriage which was
driving by, struck him and knocked him down, on which both the
wheels went over his body. He was conveyed to the Middlesex
Hospital, where die lingered for two hours and then died. The
arriage belonged to Mrs. Polhill, of Cavendish-square. There
was no blame attached to the coachman.—Verdict, “ Accidental
death.” ‘ _
The adjourned inquest on the body ot George Askey, a child
three years old, who was supposed to have died in consequence
>f eating laurel-leaf, was resumed on Monday. Several witnesses
were called and examined ; but their evidence went no further
than to prove that the deceased and his brother had eaten some-
thing green on the road-side, mistaking it for sorrel. Mr. Sigston,
surgeon, who opened the body, said the poison taken into the
stomach was a vegetable one, as the stomach was only slightly in-
flamed ; whereas a mineral poison would have occasioned a much
greater degree of irritation. The Jury returned a verdict to the
effect that .the deceased “ Died by means of having swallowed a
vegetable poison, but of what nature, or where obtained, did not
appear.” The other child is not out of danger.— Leeds Paper.
On Thursday, Joseph Taylor and John Bishop were charged at

Gardner, from St. Bartholomew's hospital. Mrs. Gardner, of
I)orset-street, Salisbury-square, stated that the deceased was her
father-in-law, who had been ailing some time, and her husband
had in a great measure supported him. On the 18th ult. she
made him some sago, gave him some wine, and also a shilling to
pay for a bed that night. On the following day the prisoners
•ame to her, and Taylor said he had met the old man, and if she
would give him a shilling, and had no objection to the thing, he
would take him to St. Bartholomew’s hospital and get him in as
i casualty. She readily agreed to this, and on the following day
Taylor called again, and said the old man had been received.
Last Monday he came to her again, and said her father-in-law
lied of mortification on the Thursday preceding; and, on account
of the state of the corpse, had been already interred in the hos-
pital ground that morning. She went to the hospital next morn-
ing to make inquiries, when she found that the deceased had been
removed by Taylor ; and upon finding him and the other man to-
gether on Wednesday afternoon, they were taken into custody
ior stealing the body! Every exertion had been used to recover
the corpse without success. The prisoners were remanded, to
rive them an opportunity of proving, if they could, that they had
buried the body. A stranger in the justice-room said they were
resurrection men. . . , . .
Yesterday being Good Friday, the. various Catholic chapels m
the metropolis observed the day with all their peculiar devotional
ceremonies. At the Bavarian Ambassador’s chapel, the Duke of
Norfolk and many other persons of distinction were present.

that the article is one of universal consumption, and on the quality of
which so much comfort and real economy must necessarily depend, it
is presumed that few improvements of greater general utility have
been introduced for some time. The new Machinery is responsible

To those. who are at all interested in the inquiry respecting the
state of religion on the Continent, this volume will prove of remark-
able interest; hut it is also equally valuable, if not more so, as a col-
lection of excellent discourses, full of striking and impressive views of
religious truth, and furnishing the renders of Sermons with an addition
to their collection which will be of real use to them, as being wholly

FRENCH PAPERS
( From the Messager des Chambres, dated April 5.)
PARIS, April 4.
The corps of the Austrian army which at this moment invades
La Romagna consists of 15,000 or 18,(XX) men.
Baron Frimont, Commander-in-Chief in the Kingdom of Lom-
bardy and Venice, announced, in a Proclamation of the 19th of
March, that he entered the Roman States on the formal applica-
tion made by the Pope to the Emperor.
On the 21st the Austrians were at the gates of Bologna, which
they entered on the 23d. Cardinal Appozoni, the Papal Legate,
took possession of the Civil Government. His first act was to have
Te Deum performed in honour of the victory gained over the
liberty and independence of Italy. 'l’he Austrians have,not
stopped at Bologna ; their army has continued its march in three
columns. Rimini and Forli were already occupied on the 24th,
and the plan of the invading army is to go straight to Ancona and
Rome, but without any intention of entering the capital.
The Italian patriots, who had scarcely time to organize them-
selves, are every where driven back, almost without resistance.
A certain number will maintain their ground as partisans in the
Apennines ; the remainder will take refuge in Ancona. In pro-
portion as the Pontifical authority is restored, all the patriots
that can be seized are thrown into prison, as well as all the ad-
herents of the new ideas.
The Ministry has told us that it required explanations respect-
ing this movement of the Austrians, executed without our Ca-
binet having received any previous notice. We do not clearly
see what explanations the Austrian Cabinet can give, except the
application made by the Pope for assistance.
We are equally unable to see what our Cabinet could have to
object to, since it has in a great measure abandoned the doctrine
of non-intervention, such as it w r as at first understood. Shall w r e
summon the Austrians to evacuate La Romagna 'I It would be
rash to affirm this ; and on the other hand, it is doubtful whe-
ther a great Power like Austria would choose to comply with the
summons.
There will not be a war, and, what proves that peace will be
maintained is, that notwithstanding the march of the Austrians
quite through Romagna, which march was very well known at
Paris yesterday, the Monileur of this morning announces that/
nothing is changed since the pacific declaration made from the
Tribune by the Minister, and there has only been occasion for
explanations which require answers and replies.
ROME, March 22.
The insurgents have collected their forces at Rimini, where
they are preparing to oppose the Austrians if they advance into
the interior. They will resist, in the same manner as the Poles
who have disputed with the Russians every foot of their free
territory.
A French frigate and a brig have been cruising for these two
days off Civita Vecchia. This is a mark of attention on the part
of the French Government: the Court of Rome takes exclu
sively to itself, and probably with reason, the honour of the
presence of these vessels, which it considers as a compliment
t > the Holy See, and a proof ofthe wise precaution of the French
Government, when it feared that Gregory XVI. might be obliged
to quit Rome.
TOULON, March 24.
Large magazines are forming in Toulon and the environs, of
flour, wheat, biscuits, forage, oats, &c. The troops that are to
form the corps that is to be stationed on the frontiers of Pied-
mont have been for some days on the march : they will be can-
toned for the present in the communes of the department of the
Var. Independently of the six batteries of artillery which are
preparing here, others are expected from the interior, so that
there will be 100 piecesof cannon, with all the necessary materiel.
(From the Constitutionnel.)
PARIS, April 4.
The Polish Mercury publishes the following letter sent from
Warsaw, dated the 27th of October, 1830, from the Grand Duke
(’onstantine to the Count Alopens, the Russian Minister at; Ber-
lin : —“ I learn with the greatest pleasure that all the necessary
measures have been taken in the States of his Prussian Majesty,
to defeat all the projects of disturbers. Your communications
relative to the Grand Duchy of Posen, appear to me to be
the result of an imagination sometimes operated upon by fear,
sometimes by personal motives. X think we ought not to fall
from one extreme to another, and hitherto I have seen no well-
grounded cause for alarm. It is true that for a long time past
many individuals, imbued with ideas of an unquiet and exag-
gerated patriotism, desire to distinguish themselves among their
compatriots ; but they are known to me, and I have, as you
must remember, already made them known to you. Still this is
far from resembling the Sicilian Vespers. An active surveillance
on the part of the Government will be sufficient to repress the
disorders of these disturbers. As to what has been told you with
regard to the Poles residing at Paris, I have had for eight years
past information as to their conduct, and I am in a condition to
watch all their movements. We are entirely tranquil here, and
nothing induces me to think that we ought to fear any disastrous
event. The system of active surveillance which I have esta-
blished here, enables me to be aware of every thing.”
MILAN, March 28,
On the 25th, two Hungarian regiments, 1,200 horse, and 16
pieces of cannon, pushed on from Forli to St. Angelo, and drove
oat the patriots who had assembled there/ On the same day they
advanced towards Urbino. Another column ofB,ooo men, passing
by Lonzone and Fojano, advanced upon Floransuola. General
Frimont endeavoured to prevent the union of the patriot
forces which directed themselves towards Recanoti, Camerino,
and Tolentino; but up to this moment it seems to be impossible
that the Generals Zucchi and Grabinski should not have prevented
the intention of the Austrian G eneral. The representatives of
the free cities are installed in the city of Ancona, and having re-
ceived from General Frimont and Cardinal Opizzoni the order to
submit, and to unite with them in the endeavour to re-establish
the legitimate Government of the Holy Father, have replied.
“ When justice is overpowered by force we will submit ourselves
prisoners.” It bas been asserted that some exalted patriots
wished to put a price on the head of General Frimont,
but that the President Nicini protested against it, and com-
municated to the Austrian General that his life was menaced,
and that he must put himself upon his guard. On the
23d, during the night, about three hundred patriots were
-encountered upon the limits of Lucca; some shots passed be-
tween them and the soldiers of the State, and they then retired
into the mountains. We are assured that they had with them
two small pieces of artillery. On the side of Ferrara there are
two guerilla parties, which much annoy the Austrian transports
when they are not accompanied by an imposing force. On the
24th, at a little distance from Ferrara, three forage carts were
surprised, and the men of the escort made prisoners.
We are informed from Rome, that the English Cardinal Weld
has been of important assistance to the Papal Government during
the late events. His Excellency has borrowed for the Roman
Treasury 500,000 Roman crowns. This fund has furnished to
Cardinal Bernetti the means of counter-revolutionising the in-
surgent States, and of preventing the insurrection both in Rome
and in the Camarca.
Troops arrive every day at Venice from Trieste and Zara.
Since the 15th of March, more than 20,000 men have passed
through there to Trent and Belluno. These forces do liot appear
destined for Central Italy, but for the Alps, and perhaps for tho
approaching occupation of Piedmont, which for some days past
has been spoken of as a settled measure between the Cabinets of
Austria and Turin.
PARIS, April 5.
(From Le Temps of Tuesday.)
On the 30th of March, the King of Sardinia was somewhat
better, but his situation was, nevertheless, alarming.
( From the National of Tuesday.)
General Bacheler, commander of the nineteenth military divi-
sion, has sent in his resignation to the Minister of War.
( From GalignanVs Messenger of Tuesday .)
Orders are said to have been transmitted to Toulon for fitting-
out divers gun-boats and brigs stationed in that port. These
vessels, to the number of eight or ten, are to sail as soon as
possible, and cruise off the coasts of Italy and Spain, ia order to
observe the movements which are taking place in those countries.
The rise in the Funds yesterday seems to be entirely owing to
financial causes. It was stated on ’Change that the Minister of
the Finances, on learning the bad effect produced on the public-
credit by the announcement of three successive loans, is dis-
posed to treat with an English Company for the negotiation of a
considerable sum in Treasury Bills, at a long date, which would!
supersede the necessity of effecting the loan announced for tbe
19th ult. We give this without vouching for its truth .—Journal
du Commerce,
“ The following report,” says the Courrier Francais, “ was
current yesterday upon the state of diplomatic negotiations : It
is said, that upon the question of the intervention of Austria in*
the Duchy of Parma and Placentia, England, without
fully concurring in the pretensions of the Cabinet of Vienna, has
declared that it cannot give rise to opposition by arms on the
part of France. The French Cabinet admits this doctrine.
to the question of Romagna, it is stated that the notq 0 f
France, which is couched in firm and precise terms, was con-
certed verbally with the English Ambassador. M. Perrier jun.
was charged to carry it to London. It was affirmed that intelli-
gence was received of the full and unreserved adhesion of Eng-
land, who admits the right of France to declare w? ar i u case Austria
should not evacuate Romagna, A Conk-ess is tn moot at
Rome for the solution of all the question's.”
The A ugsburg Gazette has the follor/ing extract of a letter from
Hamburg, dated March 25 Car military authorities are very
active in organising and completing the federal contingent, as bv
an order received from th'e Diet these tioops are to be on the
frontiers of Luxemburg by the end of April. The belief is an
approaching and probably wide-spreading war, and is gaining
ground, and has already exerted some influence on several ar-
ticles of commerce. Private letters from Sweden state that the
Kraperor of Russia has applied to the Government of that king-
dom to supply him with 10,000 auxiliary troops, as promised by
the Holy Alliance. A report was current on the 18th at Stock-
holm that a French and English fleet would appear in the Baltic
in the beginning of the summer.”
CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES, April 4.
The Chamber commenced the preparatory discussion of the
project of law concerning the extraordinary taxes called for by
the Minister of Finances.
M. Salterte rose to oppose the granting ofthe vote of credit
and stated that the patriotism ofthe Chamber had been put to a
grave trial. The dema.d of new taxes was, he understood, to be
followed by other demands of the same kind, which the close of
the Session—believed to be impending—would preclude the
Chamber from examining with the attention they deserved. He
then adverted to the modification introduced in the electoral
law'by the Chamber of Peers, and commented at considerab'e
length on the internal and external policy of the Cabinet. He
next alluded to M. Casimir Perrier’s first declaration to the
Chamber, which he remarked was more pacific in its tendency

urged by that gentleman’s agents not to tender their votes, and
assured that all their expenses would be paid, they on
exercising their franchise to make assurance doubly sure. This

Yesterday the subscribers to, and the friends of, the Licensed
Victuallers' Asylum, dined together at the London Tavern,
Bishopsgate-street; and on this occasion the Duke of Sussex
(who laid the foundation stone of the Asylum, and who presided
two years ago) again took the chair. The Duke, in giving the
first toast, spoke to the following effect: —“ Gentlemen, you will
easily anticipate the toast lam going to propose. Thank God !
in this country we can do nothing without a King ; and thank
God ! (added the Duke most earnestly) with such a King as we
have, we can do every thing. [The tremendous and hearty ap-
plause that burst forth on the delivery of this sentence defies
adequate description.] Silence being restored, the Duke pro-
ceeded—“ I will not dilate upon the subject of the toast—it is
unnecessary ; because I see how anxious you are to do honour
to it. ( Loud cries of Bravo, and exclamations of We have come
to plain good English at last.) I will give you, gentlemen,
• King William the Fourth, and God bless him !’ ” —a toast pro-
nounced with impressive feeling by his Royal Highness. It was
honoured with loud bursts of applause. In speaking of reform,
in the course of the evening, his Royal Highness took occasion
to declare, that “ the Crown was for reform ,; that the Govern-
ment was unanimous for reform; and that the two being sup-
sported by all England, reform must be carried. Time would
undeceive the public respecting various mis-statements, and
reason would in time-come to the aid of those who were preju-
diced. At all events, there could be no question that those who
depended on misleading the public would ultimately find out
their error.”
The meeting of Lambeth Parish which was adjourned on
Tuesday evening was resumed yesterday morning, and occupied
nearly the whole day. Regarding the county rate, Mr. Fall
complained of its oppressive influence on this parish, owing to
the whole of the parish being assessed at 30 per cent, higher
than the rack-rent, which took from the pockets of the inhabit-
ants 6,000/. more than they ought to pay. He recommended an
immediate resort to the Court of King’s Bench for redress. Mr.
Roffey, one of the churchwardens, said the subject had engrossed
considerable attention, and was now under consideration. A
motion was made by Mr. Fall and carried, that all superannuated
allowances and pensions be referred to a committee to inquire
into the merits of the parties, and to report thereon at a future
vestry t Two of these pensions were to two superannuated
beadles, of 50/. each, one of them having only served the parish
five or six years, and the other eight years. A Mr. Hatton very
violently opposed all pensions of every kind, and declared, that
while one was paid he would pay no poor’s rates, and he defied
■ any Magistrate to grant a warrant against him for non-payment.
Yesterday, pursuant to a requisition from Mr. Wilton, the
' -solicitor of Mr. Chambers, a meeting was held at the Freema-
son’s Tavern, of persons having claims on the estate of Messrs.
■ Chambers. The meeting was very thinly attended. Mr. Wilton
stated, that he had called the meeting without the authority of
■ Mr. Chambers, but with a view of‘ coming to an arrangement
with the creditors, to which he was sure he should obtain the
assent of Mr. Chambers. He then laid before them his proposi-
tion, which was r that out of the 209,000/., the estimated assets
■ of the property, a dividend should be made to the creditors of
10s. in the pound, and that the settlement of all matters between
Mr. Chambers, the creditors, and the assignees, should be re-
ferred to, an arbitration. A long discussion ensued, which led to
nothing, and finally the meeting adjourned, sirie die, without com-
ing to any decision on the subject.
• On Tuesday afternoon, as a fine boy, aged ten years, son of a
Mr. .Tasking, carpenter, of Brook-street, New'-road, was playing
with a ball in William-street, he by accident threw it over the
fence of Mr. Mead’s carriage repository, and having climbed
over to get it was attacked by several Newfoundland dogs, kept
for the protection of the premises. Mr. Mead was immediately
applied to, when his son, the only person who can manage them,
came to his assistance, and succeeded in pulling them oft'. The
poor boy presented a most shocking spectacle, his clothes being
completely torn oft' him, and his whole frame presenting one
mass of blood and mutilation. He was instantly conveyed to the
surgery of Mr. Alfred Elkins, of No. 25, Osnaburg-street, who
promptly afforded him every requisite assistance ; but, such were
the.number and natureof he had received, that it
occupied nearly two hours in merely dressing th£m.' There were,
besides innumerable other injuries, six extebmve incisions on
the back part of the head, all of which penetrated to the bone of
the skull; one of the ears was also bitten, and only hung by a
small portion of skin. The child was conveyed home to his
afflicted parents, without the slightest hopes of his recovery.
An inquest was taken at Wortham on Wednesday last, before
Chailes Gross,.Gent., on the body of Henry Hayward, a little
boy aged four years, who it appeared died from taking arsenic.—
From ih e deposition of the boy’s aunt, it appeared that at Mi-
chaelmas iJSt she mixed some arsenic with treacle, in a pot,
for the purpose of killing mice : that on Saturday last she, think-
ing that there was no more arsenic in the pot, but dirt only at
the bottom, placed the pot on the table in the keeping-room, and
there left it for an hour ; on her return the deceased, his bro-
ther Joseph, and an infant, were very sick : on inquiring of their
sister Mary Anne, she said that her sister Ann, about seven
years old, had tasted part of the contents of the pot, and given
some to the deceased. All the children were very sick, and
Henry died on Sunday. Suspicion being excited, this witness
Was strictly questioned as to the time the father of the children
was at home, to which she replied—“ He was not in the house
from Saturday morning before I brought down the pot, till Sun-
day morning.” Mr. Jeoffry Pearl, surgeon, ot Diss, considered
the taking of arsenic to have been the cause ot the child’s death.

LENT ASSIZES,
At the Chester Assizes on Monday, Gilbert Higgott (previ-
ously convicted at these Assizes on a similar indictment) was
j charged under the 52d George 111., that he, being a person em-
ployed under the General Post-office, did, on the Ist day of May
flast, feloniously secrete and embezzle a letter intrusted to his
custody, as Deputy-Postmaster, at Tarporley. The trial lasted
1 several hours : the facts of the case are shortly these:—Mr.
| Joseph Wood, a shopkeeper, residing at Rush ton, about two
1 miles from Tarporley, said he brought a letter ready written to’
| the Post-office, at Tarpoley, on Saturday, the Ist of May, and'
1 there saw the prisoner, in whose presence he enclosed a 10/.
' . Bank of England note in the letter addressed to Mr. Wolstencroft,
of Manchester, sealed it with a wafer, and immediately delivered
1 it into the hands of the prisoner. The prisoner said, “ You are
sending some one a valuable letter, and you do that which every
man ought to do—you show me the contents, and I am responsi-
ble for it ;” whereas in point of fact he was not responsible. In
a few days afterwards Mr. Wood received two letters from Mr.
Wolstencroft, complaining of the non-arrival of the expected
remittance. He communicated the contents of these two letters
to the prisoner, who replied, he could not account for it, other-
wise than that the letter had beenmis-sent some where, in which
case it would get to the Dead-letter-office, and that he would
make application on the subject to that office, which, however,
lie never did. Some days afterwards he told Mr. Wood if he
would promise to return the money if the letter should arrive at its
destination, he ( prisoner) would ad vancehim the 10/.out of hi s own
pocket, appointing the following Friday for Mr. Wood to call for
that purpose. Mr. Wood did not come until the Saturday, when
prisoner gave him 4/., saying that was all the money he then had;
and remarked that it was very hard that he (prisoner) should
have to pay this money, owing to his having omitted to enter the
letter as “ a cash letter.” In the course of a few days afterwards Mr,
Wood called on the prisoner, by appointment, and received 3/i
more ; and in about a month afterwards the prisoner sent the
remaining 3 L to Mr. Wood’s house. The jury returned a verdict
of Guilty, but recommended him to mercy. The Chief Justice
ordered sentence of death to be recorded against the prisoner,
but intimated that he might expect the royal clemency would be
interposed to save his life.
At the Gloucester Assizes, on Tuesday, Onesiphorus Bowyer
and Charles Harper were indicted under the act of the 7th and
Bth Geo. IV. c. 30, s. 10, for damaging, so as to render
a boat, the property of W. Fitzharding Berkeley, Esq. James
Barrett said he was employed by Colonel Berkeley to watch
some land near the Severn, which was the resort of wild fowl.
At nine o’clock on the morning of the 29th of January, he saw-
five men in a boat coming near the place where he was watching.
He called out to them to keep off. They went down the river,
and on landing, took some sticks from a gate and the fences, and
carried them into the boat. The prisoners and a man named
Legge, afterwards went to a boat belonging to Colonel Berkeley,
on the shore, and began to pound it. The boat was quite sound
before this, but on the witness’s going to examine it after the
prisoners had Been there, he found a large hole in the bottom of
two feet and a half long. An objection was taken on the part of
the prisoners, that the act in question applied to a ship or vessel,
and not to a mere pleasure boat. Mr. Justice Patteson observed,
that it was important, with a view to other cases, to ascertain
whether the words “ ship” or “ vessel” applied to a boat of this
description, and therefore he would, in the event of a conviction,
save the point for the opinion of the Judges. The Jury found a
verdict of not guilty.
At the conclusion of their labours on Monday, the Grand Jury,
at the Gloucester assizes, delivered a presentment to Mr. Justice
Patteson, stating their opinion that a great many of the offences
which had come before them had arisen from the number of beer-
shops which had been opened in the country under the late act
of Parliament, and which they had no doubt tended very much to
the increase of crime, from the facilities they afforded to idle and
ill-disposed persons to meet together; and they trusted his
Lordship would make such a representation in the proper quarter
ns would lead to some regulation being adopted with respect to
them.
The Learned Judge said, he perfectly concurred in the opinion
of the Grand Jury. He had come to the same conclusion from
what he had seen on the Special Commission, and he w r ould take
care that their presentment should be laid before his Majesty’s
Government.
DREADFUL SCENE aTSTAMFORD.
(From the Stamford Champion of Tuesday.)
A circumstance has just taken place in our peaceful borough of
the most painful nature, but w’hich our duty, as public journalists,
compels us to detail. A man of the name of Jackson occupied a
house on the waste, which had been erected by Mr. Francis
Butt. He had, it appears, been served with notice to quit, and
was in arrear of rent. As this man had voted at the last election
against the nominees of the Marquis of Exeter, it w r as generally
stated, and he himself professed to believe, that he was to be
turned out for so doing. This, how T ever, his landlord distinctly
denies. On his non-payment of rent and refusal to quit, Clarke,
the sheriff’s officer, and an assistant, were sent to distrain his
goods. His wife applied to Mr. Beasley, and Mr. Beasley
agreed to advance the money on goods to that amount being left
in his custody, to be redeemed when convenient. While these
matters w T ere going on the husband had come home, and being
infuriated at the presence of the officer’s assistant, he forcibly
turned him out of the house, and thrust his warrant into the fire.
Afterwards, it appears. that the unfortunate man, in his wrath or
revenge, proceeded to break up the doors, and otherwise damage
the premises. Mr. Butt having been intormed of this, obtained
from the magistrates another warrant against him, which was
intrusted to Blades and Stimson, the constables, to execute.
Having this warrant, Blades saw the man, and directed him
to attend at the Tow r n-hall last Thursday, at a particular
hour. He did so attend, accompanied by his wife, but there
were neither accuser, magistrates, constables, nor any other
person to receive him. After waiting some time, he walked
away. On Saturday Blades met him, and asked him why
lie had not attended the hall at the time specified. He replied
that he had. Blades then took him before the Mayor, at his
Worship’s private residence, w T ho questioned him as to his con-
duct, to which questions it is said he returned insolent answers.
His Worship ordered him to be taken to the watchhouse, and to
be brought up to the hall on Monday. He replied, that as he
lived in the town, and they knew where to find him, he would
not goto the watchhouse to be detained all Sunday and two
nights. The Mayor was inflexible, and ordered Blades and
Stimson to take him to the watchhouse. The party with their
prisoner then went out, and it appears James Askew, eldest son
of the Mayor, armed himself with a formidable baton, having a
brass ferrule at the end, and accompanied them. When at the
corner of the High-street, the prisoner made an attempt to run
off towards his own house ; the constables followed, and young
Askew first came up with him, and seized him by the neck. The
prisoner, to disengage himself from the gripe, violently kicked
arid plunged, and then James Askew, as it is stated by an eye-
witness, struck at him with the heavy brass end of the baton, on
the back part of the head, inflicting a very large wound, and
penetrating through the skull. The man dropped, and his blood
flowed in torrents around. Young Askew and the rest dragged
. him bleeding in this state to the watchhouse, a distance of about
400 yards. When in the watchhouse he was insensible and in
strong convulsions—six men could scarcely hold him. In this
state it was proposed to leave him, when Mr. Beasley, who was
parochial constable, serving in his own right for that evening, ip-
• sisted upon his being taken to his house in the fly, which was
done on the certificate of Mr. Burdett, the surgeon, who, with
Mr. Marveilleux, and Mr. Whitby, had been called in to attend
him. These gentlemen caused his head to be shaved, bandaged
the wound, and bled him very copiously. During the whole of
the night and most of Sunday he continued insensible ; in the
evening he was somewhat better, and could reply to questions,
and on Monday he remained in the same state.
While bleeding and insensible in the watchhouse his wife
rushed in, and her cries were heart-rending. “He is murdered
—»he is murdered—what shall Ido for my children?” were her
chief exclamations. These cries were followed by demands that
“ the murderer” should be taken into custody. A crowd Was
soon collected, who besieged the Mayor’s door, and demanded
that James Askew should be given up to them. Mr. Richardson,
of the Crown and Woolpack, obtained admission, with Redd,
the town sergeant, and on stating the object of their visit, and
the dangerous condition of the wounded man, the Mayor asked
whether bail could not be taken for his son. Mr. Reed declared
it could not. His then said, “ Well, we must obey
the laws—there is Iny son, take him.” James Askew then sdr-
rendered himself, and was let out (to avoid the enraged popu-
lace) by the-back way, in the custody of the town sergeant, who
conducted him to his own house.
These are, we believe, the simple facts. If the man dies,
which is not at all unlikely, from the nature of the wound, young
Askew will be placed in a peculiar situation.
On the 23d of December last, Mr. James Weston, constable,
of Downham Market, in Norfolk, was shot by a man named
Robert Chapman, blacksmith, of Wimbortham, a village near
Downham: the murderer absconded, and could not be heard of
for a long time ; handsome rewards were offered for his appre-
hension, but without effect: it now appears that he had con-
cealed himself in the neighbourhood of Boston. A true bill was
found against him at the last Norwich assizes, and a Judge’s
warrant issued for his apprehension ; the exertions to discover
his retreat were renewed, and he was in consequence traced by
Mr. Streeton, an active constable of Boston, to the neighbour-
hood. Mr. Johnson, gaoler, of Swaffham, accompanied by two
constables of this town, proceeded together on Thursday las*;,jin
a chaise, to the North Forty-Foot Bank, about five miles from
Boston, having received information that they would find the
wretched offender there. He was discovered digging in a gar-
den, and, being informed that they had come to apprehend him,
he stoutly resisted, and, lifting up his spade, threatened to mur-
ler them if they did not desist; being a powerful and muscular
nan he caused great difficulty, but was at length handcuffed, and
conveyed in the chaise to Boston, from whence he was, on Friday,
taken to Lynn, to be examined by the Magistrates there.— Boston
Gazette.
On Thursday morning last a serious accident happened to the
Union coach, on her way from Newcastle to Edinburgh, as she
was crossing Morpeth-bridge. When coming down to the north
end of it, one of the horses rode restive ; and the drag not being-
on, and the coach very heavily laden with passengers and lug-
gage, it overturned with a fearful crash, when two of the pas-
sengers and the guard were much hurt. One of the passengers,
Mr. Lawson, of the Leazes-crescent, Newcastle, (late of the
Old Moor, near Morpeth), was so much bruised internally that
he expired on Sunday evening. A deep sympathy is felt in Mor-
peth for his melancholy death, as he was well known and uni-
versally esteemed.- Mr. Robson, horse-dealer, of Whickham,
Had his shoulder put out, and some other of the passengers were
more or less injured.— Caledonian Mercury,
POLICE.
MARLBO ROUGH-STREET.—A middle-aged female, named
Elizabeth Frith, who has been some days in custody, charged
with a series of frauds and robberies on her master, Sir George
Tuthill, was yesterday brought up for final examination.
It appeared by the evidence of Mrs. Walker, the housekeeper
in Sir George Tuthill’s establishment, that the prisoner had been
engaged there for the last four years, in the capacity of cook. It
was her business to pay the weekly bills of the tradesmen, and
the money was given to her by witness every week, and she (the
prisoner) was supposed to have always paid it over immediately
to the tradesmen, a£ she regularly submitted their respective
mimes to the witness, signed in the account books. A few days
ago, however, Sir George Tuthill received an application from
one of the tradesmen for payment of an accumulated account of
some months standing, and on an inquiry being then instituted,
it was discovered that not one of the tradesmen had been paid
for the same length of time.
The prisoner having declined saying any thing in her defence,
she was fully committed for trial.
MARYLEBONE.— EIiza Hicks, a married woman, about 30
years of age, was charged with attempting to destroy herself the
preceding evening.
A respectable-looking woman, who gave her name Mary Da-
niels, stated that on her return from Kentish-town, about seven
o’clock on Tuesday evening, when she got as far as the Elephant
end Castle, in the Pancras-road, she saw the prisoner, who ap-
peared in a state bordering on insanity, endeavour to throw her-
self oyer some palings which fence a deep marshy ditch by the
road side. In this attempt she was prevented by a young man,
who was afterwards stated to be her brother, and who dragged
her into the field, where, after beating her severely, he left her.
The unfortunate creature then used every endeavour to beat her
brains out, seeking every precipitous spot she could, and throw-
ing herself down head-foremost, until at length some humane
persons seized her, and brought her into the public-house.
Mr. Rawlinson asked her why she acted in this manner? to
which she replied, that she had parted from her husband for
several years, and supported herself by servitude. She had been
for some time out of place, and, being obliged to subsist upon her
friends, they at length grew tired of her, and, an altercation
having taken place, she tried to destroy herself. She added that
her father lived in Wilstead-street, and that, if she were set at
liberty, she would return to him, as she was confident he would
receive her.
Mrs. Daniels said that the prisoner expressed her determina-
tion to destroy herself, even after she was in custody.
Mr. Rawlinson asked Mrs. Daniels if she considered the
prisoner to be sober at the time ?
Mrs. Daniels said she considered her to be perfectly sober.
Mr. Rawlinson did not think it prudent, after so determined
an attempt at self-destruction, to suffer her on her own assurance
to go at large, and accordingly ordered her to be taken to the
workhouse of St. Pancras.
QUEEN-SQUARE.— Henry Bullard, of Sloane -square, and j
Henry Shelton, of Doyley-street, Chelsea, keepers of new beer
shops, were fined 40s. each, on informations preferred by John-
son, for selling after 10 o’clock at night,
HATTON-GARDEN.—Yesterday, W. Cole and Thomas Ire-
land, alias Harjpur, were charged on suspicion of having been
concerned in illicit distillation, at No. 2, Merlin’s-place, Spa-
fields. In each of the two cellars of the house was discovered
the necessary apparatus for distillation, together with 100 gallons
of low wine in a large cask, 12 gallons of strong spirits in other
vessels, and 300 gallons of molasses in 9 wash vats. Ireland was
convicted in the mitigated penalty of SOT, and in default of pay-
ment hard labour in the House of Correction. The other prisoner
was discharged.
THAMES OFFlCE.—Yesterday John Whewetl, a tall ruf-
fianly-looking fellow, in the employ of Mr. Fernee, green grocer
and carrier, in Shadwell, was charged under the following cir-
cumstances :
It appeared from the evidence of Captain Gaytor, master of a
collier, that on the previous afternoon he was passing down the
Cannon-street-road, when he observed the prisoner cruelly beat-
ing a horse, both on the fore and hind legs, because it was unable
to extricate a van, heavily laden, from the kennel or low part of
the road. Fie requested the prisoner to put his shoulder to the
wheel, and offered to assist, but he refused, and the poor animal
being unable to move the load, he flogged it in the most barbarous
manner, under the flank, until the horse fell from weakness on its
knees. Witness remonstrated with him, but to no purpose ; he
was assailed with a volley of the lowest abuse, and the defendant
seized him by the collar, shook him violently, and thep knocked
him down. On recovering his legs, he saw the defendant beating
the horse on the head until he was nearly exhausted with his
own savage exertions. He again remonstrated with him, when
{lie prisoner exclaimed, “ What the hell is it to you?” and felled
him to the ground by a heavy blow in the face, and attempted to
drive over him, and after he had been repeatedly struck about the
head and face, some persons passing saved him from farther
violence.
Several persons who witnessed the defendant’s conduct, cor-
roborated Captain Gaytor’s testimony.
The prisoner in defence said, that the animal wanted coaxing
and beating to make it draw, but he was too fond of it to beat it
unnecessarily.
The prisoner’s master said, he never knew him to beat the
mare before.
The Magistrates, after observing that the interference of Capt.
(i ay tor was highly praiseworthy, and that it was the bounden
duty of an Englishman when he saw humanity outraged to inter-
pose, convicted the prisoner in the highest penalty, 51.
WORSHIP-STREET. —A young man, who gave his name
r Newport, yesterday stated at this office, that bis father,
who was eighty-three years of age, and resided with him at
Vo. 1, Saxon Cottage, Mare-street, Hackney, had left home on
Saturday last, at twelve o’clock in the day, for the purpose of
taking, as they considered, his usual walk, but had never since
returned. He was well dressed, rather tall, stout made, and had
on at the time a blue coat, light waistcoat, and black breeches.
Applicant said he strongly suspected that his father had been
waylaid and robbed, or detained by some persons for the purpose
of obtaining a reward.
Mr. Benett, the Sitting Magistrate, ordered the officers to
render the applicant all their assistance to find the old gentleman.
For some time past, very considerable depredations have been
committed on the Gas Company at Hammersmith, by being
robbed of a considerable quantity of coals; but in what manner
t hey were stolen, it appeared quite impossible to ascertain. In-
formation was forwarded to Mr. Inspector Grensall, belonging to
the Q division, stationed at Hammersmith, of the circumstance,
who immediately commenced a very strict look-out for the detec-
tion of the robbers. On Monday night he succeeded in capturing
two large fishing-boats close to the Suspension Bridge, loaded
with coals, which had been stolen out of several barges lying off
the Company’s Gas Works, and belonging to the Company ; the
fishing-boats were on shore, with two men belonging to them
lying on some sacks, awaiting the return of the tide, which in
less than another half-hour would have enabled the robbers to
!»ave effected their escape with their valuable cargo.
On Tuesday afternoon a man, who gave his name as Hans
Hope, and travelling from Bristol, was discovered lying at the
floor of a house, at Turnham-green, in a most wretched state,
and apparently dying. He stated that for the last five days he
had subsisted on bread alore, and was quite exhausted. He was
conveyed to Chiswick workhouse, where every assistance was
afforded him ; but he died the same evening.
On Tuesday night, between the hours of seven and eight
o’clock, an extensive robbery was committed on the premises of
Ur. Peppitt, a livery-stable-keeper, residing at No. 35, Little
Church-street, Lisson-grove. It appears that Mr. P. and his
family were from home at the time the robbery was committed,
and the robbers must have watched them out, and immediately
afterwards entered the premises by means of a skeleton key. The
whole of the drawers were ransacked, and wearing apparel of
various description stolen, to the amount of upwards of 20/., be-
sides plate and other property to the further amount of 50/. In-
formation was immediately sent to the various Inspectors of the
Metropolitan police, in the vicinity where the robbery was com-
mitted.
About five o’clock on Tuesday afternoon, a middle-aged female,
respectably dressed, hired a boat, and desired the waterman to
row up the river. On their arrival at Westminster, she suddenly
threw herself into the water, but the man, fortunately, caught her
clothes, and landed her in safety, and she was restored to her
friends, who were sent for. About the same time a man jumped
from Waterloo-bridge, and was also saved.
Yesterday evening an inquest was held at the Black Horse Ta-
vern, Kingsland Road, on the body of Thomas Baynes, aged 40.
The deceased, who was deaf and dumb, was the son of an old
gentleman residing at Walworth; he and three other sons were
all born deaf and dumb, but the daughters were free from any
such affliction. The sons were all educated at the Deaf and
Dumb Asylum, and evinced considerable talent, and conveyed
their ideas and answers by writing. The deceased was formerly
a seal stone engraver, but latterly turned his mind to painting.
! t appeared that he had withdrawn himself from the family for
ibout six months, and on Saturday bis body was found in the
Kegent’s Canal, with a piece of paper in his pocket, on which
his father’s address was written. As there was no evidence of
his insanity, the Jury returned a verdict of “ Found Drowned.”
Yesterday an inquest was held at the Elephant and Castle,
Pancras, on the body of a female infant, which was found on
Sunday morning last in Georgiana-street, Gordon-square, New-
road. The body was in an advanced stage of decomposition when
found ; but the medical gentlemen were of opinion that it had
been born alive. A verdict of murdered by some person unknown
was returned.
Bourrienne’s Life of Napoleon. — The best edition of this
famous work that has yet appeared was published last week in
three portable volumes by Messrs. Colburn and Bentley. Inde-
pendently of the numerous graphic embellishments, the addition
jf notes from Buonaparte’s own dictations and from the writings
of those persons who were actually concerned in the great events
which marked the life of the ex-Emperor, must confer an unri-
valled value on the new edition. Envious historians have been
jealous of the commanding character of Bourrienne’s Memoir, and
have endeavoured to impugn a few of his statements; but a
similar injustice was attempted to be perpetrated in Boswell’s
Life of Johnson by contemporaries, who were angry merely be-
cause their opportunities of knowing Johnson’s real character
were much less favourable than those of Boswell. Time, how-
ever, has vindicated the work of Boswell, and time will assuredly
confirm the high opinion now generally entertained of Bourrienne’s
l ife of Napoleon.
Wedded Life in the Upper Ranks. —The novel under this
attractive title, though it is in some respects the very antipodes
of Mrs. H. More’s “ Ccelebs in search of a Wife,” is admitted to
he the most favourite book among lady-readers, of any published
since “ Coelebs.” The noble autheress has manifested much
tact in her management of so delicate a subject.
VAN DIEMEN’S LAND.
The following is the conclusion of the letter from a settler h-
serted in our paper of Saturday
The consumption of eatables in my house, and the expense of
clothes, will appear by a copy of my regulations for servants
(convicts); the others require more, not being satisfied
without wine and mutton chops for breakfast and tea. Of their
arrogance, I cannot give you a better idea than this anecdote
of Olive, who was next to starving ; and Ann, who enjoyed the
noble income of four shillings and sixpence per week in Eng-
land : —Mr. Hobbes very kindly took them (as our servants) into
his house, and treated them as well as he. lives himself, or as he
treated us. One day, the flour not coming from the mill in
time, there was only for their breakfast boiled potatoes, milk,
tea, sugar, and a cold roastleg of mutton ; they positively refused
to sit down to this, though they knew that I was a guest only,
and paid nothing ; the convict servants, following the example,
did thefsarne; so much for the hard lives that servants lead. But,
my regulations
Work—Sun-rise to sun-set, but not more than 10 hours any
day, and less, of course, in winter; to begin at sun-rise and end
at sun-set, because it is too hot in the middle of the day. To
leave on Saturdays at two o’clock, to prepare and wash for
Sundays.
Provisions— 1J lb. flesh, lb, flour, and 2 lb. meal, daily for
each.
Ind ulgences—l lb. sugar, 2£ ounces tea, and 1 lb. soap fox-
five, each weekly. Tobacco not given but as a reward, but I
always give it on Saturdays, about an ounce to each.
Clothing—2 suits of good slop clothing ; 4 shirts, check ;
3 pair strong boots, 15s. per pair ; 1 hat, and a cap, yearly ;
bedding, not to he considered their own, a bag full of wool, 2
blankets, 1 sheet, and 1 rug.
A plate, a spoon, a knife and fork each : a frying-pan, tea-
kettle and boiler, and some razors, &c.; buckets, See.
Order—The overseer to be obeyed as myself; if he acts a»
iiiey may think improperly, to complain to me always perso-
nally, not by message. To attend prayei-s at my tent once every
Sunday, One by rotation to act as orderly on Saturdays and
Sundays, to assist in any thing that may occur.
They seem perfectly satisfied at present (but it is early times),
behave much better, and work more willingly than those that
are paid (Stancombe always excepted, who, however, is only a
workman, being too soft for an overseer). Now, calculating-
four servants, two sawyers, one carpenter, one shoemaker, and
one milkman (the ladies not choosing to milk), in all eight con-
victs, in my own family, who now use more in proportion (though
at first not half so much), twelve to twenty, will make 30 meat, 30
flour daily, near 11,000 pounds of each yearly, of which I must
buy every bit till next harvest; and then mutton, 11,000 pounds
lor two years to come ; and 1,000 lbs. ofsugar, 1501bs of tea, and
about 50lbs. of tobacco, and 200 lbs. of soap, and then add wine,
clothing, bedding, &cc. &c.„and you will find that a man cannot
live for nothing here at first; but once raise the flour and meal,
tne rest will be easily paid for. It is for this that I am so anx-
ious to enclose my property, which I cannot hope to do with my
own force, under several years, but, by hiring fencers, in less
than one. A little more money, also, would enable me to hire
carts to bring in bark to Launceston, where it sells for 31. 3s.
per ton, not paid under six months by the merchants, of
which 2/. 2s. Od. would be clear gain ; and I could easily
send every year one hundred and fifty tons, one ton being
i cart load; but I cannot deprive myself of the money necessary
to buy meat, bread, &c. I have said nothing as yet of my fa-
mily, who are all with me, William not liking the place I had
procured forhim. We are all well and hearty, but the little one
i s afflicted with a species of ringworm, which seems to annoy all
children here (a doctor would gain a fortune by a remedy for it.)
We all, except Maria, arise at sun-rise, and work till dark, and
then go to bed, to repeat the same next day. We sleep in a hut
of split wood, the crevices partly stopped with wool, and partlys
covered with thatch; our kitchen is another hut of turf ; our
parlour is the marquee tent, in which we also lodge strangers, of
whom not a few pass, and, though I hope I feel as much as an-
other inclined to hospitality, I find them a great annoyance. 1
must get somebody to set up an inn at my place. The Governor
has been very polite to me, and has appointed me Magistrate for
the territory ; —equal to a justice of peace in England—a trouble
and expense. I have declined to act until my house is finished,

And perhaps about 20/. more. I have about 300/. worth of pro-
perty which I cannot do without, or make any thing of. I have
made something by sale or exchange of clothes &c. for cattle, but
the most profitable things were lace and ribbons, and some caps
my wife made on board.
I have no time, except Sundays, to write, and then all my
servants wanting holidays, I am obliged to keep guard and watch.
Above 1,300/. was expended before I reached my farm; near
200/. in purchase and expenses ; and I must reserve a large sum
to buy provisions for the year to come, which will prevent me
from fencing or improving my ground, or cutting bark for many
years, unless I can borrow 200/. or 300/., which I could repay
doubly in two or three years. I could at any time have 1,200/.
tor the place; I will engage it, and my stock, for repayment.
The money should be sent to me as soon as possible. I would
then contract for carts and men to assist in barking, and I could
with ease procure this year 150 tons, which in England would
clear 600/. I think, perhaps, Mr. Robertson, 30, Crutched Friars,
would take the bark of me.
On Monday forenoon, a man of the name of SuthdHand, a
publican in Milne-square, was found behind a hedge at the bot-
tom of the Easter Road to Leith, with his throat cut. There is
something remarkable in this suicide: —The deceased W’as, we
understand, an Ordnance pensioner, and had been at Leith for
his quarter’s payment, which was found on his person. When
he left home —only a few hours before he was found dead—there
Was nothing unusual in his manner; nor can any cause be as-
signed for this fatal act. A penknife was found beside the
corpse. —Edinburgh Paper.
A most distressing accident occurred on Friday last, on the
Cheshire shore. Mr. Williams, of this town, indigo-broker,
having spent the afternoon on the other side of the river, was
hurrying down the slip at Woodside-ferry, to reach the steam-
vessel, which was on the point of starting for Liverpool. By
some accident the unfortunate gentleman fell over the side of
the slip, and, the tide being out at the time, his head pitched
with violence against a rock. He was immediately raised and
conveyed to the ferry-house. The injury he had received was,
however, fatal, and he expired in about an hour after the melan-
choly accident occurred. —Liverpool Albion.
The Author of the King’s Secret. —The prevalent rumour
that The King’s Secret is from the pen of Mr. Power, the cele-
brated Irish Comedian and author of the popular novel of The
Lost Heir, appears to be confirmed by the Literary Gazette of
Saturday last. “ Mr. Power,” observes the Editor, “is assuredly
making himself as high and popular a in Literature as upon
the stage. The interest of this work is as well sustained as its
mystery, and the story is as original as it is interesting. We hold
The King’s Secret,” continues the Editor, “to be among the
very best of our historic fictions.”

than his last, and adjured him, before he entertained the hope of
compelling Europe to disarm, to weigh well the value, and con-
vince himself of the sincerity, of diplomatic assurances. M.
Sa’verte then recommended strongly an alliance between France
and England, for securing the liberty of Europe, and the execu-
tion of which he deemed perfectly practicable. He afterwards
challenged the Ministry to declare if the necessary changes haa
been made in the diplomatic agents of France. “ For instance,”
said he, “ who is our Consul in Edinburgh, the most important
for us at the present time 1” With respect to the fear of an ex-
plosion in the western departments (La Vendee), M. Salverte
supposed that the danger from that quarter was not imminent, as
the Government had thought proper to remove Gen. Lamarque
from that command. “ Nevertheless,” said he, “ I can assure
the Ministry that the Carlists of La Vendee are not idle. At
Vitre an Association has been lately formed (not a patriotic one
of course), and its contributions are not twenty-five centimes per
month, as those of the National Association, but eight per cent,
on the amount of the direct taxes paid by the members. I vouch
for the accuracy of this statement, for I have received it from our
colleague, M. Bertrois.” M. Salverte concluded by again deny-
ing the expediency of granting the vote of credit called for, and
voted against it.
Admiral De Rigxy, Minister of the Marine, at this moment
took the oath and his seat.
M. C. Dupix expressed his astonishment at hearing many
Honourable Members urging the Government to use largely its
privilege of dismissing public officers from their employments;
and said that, after such a revolution as the last, it could not be
required that no one should be allowed to fill public offices who
had shown marks of attachment to the Government which had
legally existed under that Charter, which had not been annulled
but only improved. As long as they continued faithful to their
several duties, not only should they be retained in their appoint-
ments, but their past actions and their past opinions should be
forgotten.
General Lamarque said every day justifies our fears and anti-
cipations for the future. The danger approaches, and every
moment of delay but renders it more imminent. I shall first
allude to the protocol of the 28th of February, a document worthy
of the best days of the Holy Alliance. That document leaves
Belgium at the disposal of Holland. Belgium is sacrificed—she
is punished for having imitated our example. It is sought to
drive her to despair—to ruin her by intestine division—in order
that, when a prey to anarchy, she may more easily be placed at
the disposal of England. The Honourable Deputy then drew a
picture of the present state of Europe. A Ministry equilihriste,
he continued, was desirous of conciliating the revolution with
the doctrines of the restoration; and, anointing the rights of the
nation with the oil of the holy ampulla, has sent to England an
Ambassador who has assisted at the downfall of ten Govern-
ments, and was the living representative of the Holy Alliance;
while it has dispatched to Russia a former Ambassador of Charles
X. who after complimenting the conqueror of the Balkan, may
shortly perhaps do as much for the conqueror of Warsaw. (Mur-
murs.) At this moment we have neither frigate nor vessel of war,
sloop nor in the Tagus. Is a fear then entertained that the
view of the tri-coloured flag would occasion sickness to the good
Pon Miguel? (Murmurs.) No; France will never yield. Let
the signal be given, and from Dunkirk to Bayonne will resound
those words which, in rushing to combat, the Polish soldier re-
feats “Oh my country, you shall never be without defenders!”
shall vote for the grants asked when the Minister for Foreign
Affairs shall have replied to the questions : —Does the French
Government consent that Luxembourg shall be detached from
Belgium, and that, it shall pass under the domination of the Con-
federation of the Rhine, that is to say, under that of Prussia and
.Austria? Will it suffer that. Belgium should, in fact, return to
the Dutch yoke, in permitting the Prince of Orange to occupy a
throne that France thought proper to refuse? In submlting our-
selves to the shameful conditions imposed on us by the Congress
of Vienna, will it at least exact that the 4th Article of the Treaty
of the 3d of May, 1815, which assu’es to heroic Poland national
institutions, be executed? Are we to permit, in contradiction to
our policy at all times, that Austria should in reality become the
richer of all Italy ? .
M. Mauguin said, the Government entertains hopes of peace,
and yet demands extraordinary grants. Now, I believe in war,
and therefore shall support the demand. The question is not
within our decision—we have not the command of peace or war.
War is brought upon us; you see, Gentlemen (continued M.
jVlauguin), these Powers were preparing for war, while they were
gi viiig assurances of peace. But they reckoned without the Poles,
and the defeat of the Russians disconcerted all their plans. From
that moment their protestations of peace were redoubled. The
Honourable Member then went into an examination of the diplo-
macy of France and her neighbours ; and in conclusion said, let
the Powers be called upon to explain, and let us know positively
whether we are to reckon upon peace or war.”
The Minister for Foreign Affairs said—Gentlemen, if the
several Members who have successively addressed the Chamber
are to be believed, France is surrounded by enemies, ready to
unite all their efforts, and attack her in concert; and of allies she
is totally destitute. All Governments whose principles are dif-
ferent from those which form the basis of our social state are
Waitin'*' for an opportunity—a signal—to launch all their
conjoint forces against us. The secret has been revealed by a
Ukase commanding an extraordinary levy of 150,000 men, in
which war is proclaimed aloud. This Ukase is no secret; it
may be read bv all the world in the German Journals. But,
Gentlemen, this Ukase, so confidently invoked, is apocryphal,
and I possess the genuine document, which 1 shall have the
honour to lay before the Chamber to-morrow, and which foes
not contain one single word of war, but, on the contrary, gives
fresh assurances of peace. Let us appeal to facts. What has
the protocol of the 20th of January established ? It proclaims
Belgium independent, and prescribes to Holland to return
within the limits she possessed in 1790, when she was called the
Republic of the United Provinces. All that composed the king-
dom of the Netherlands will form part of Belgium, except Lux-
embourg. But Luxembourg is spoken of, Th© negotiations en-
gaged in on that subject yet impose on me some reserve. How-
ever let us examine it. ( Expressions of curiosity and interest ).
A preat part of the province of Luxembourg took part in the
Belgian insurrection; the city of Luxembourg took none;
it is occupied by a federal garrison of 3,000 Prussians, and
2 ‘>oo Belgian subjects of the King of Holland. Ihe question
of property is resolved by positive titles. You ought, were
it necessary, to declare war against a I the Powers. Mar
against all—such is the conclusion of the Honourable Mem-
bers Whom I oppose, Even when peace is mentioned, we are
asked for war, and it is war that we refuse. (Loud cheers.)
m v honourable adversaries will, doubtlessly,acknowledge with me,
that the real bond of nations is now in the community ot the
principle that governs them. Turn your eyes around : by what
Governments are we surrounded ? xs pot Switzerland free
and independent I Look at Baden, Witemheig, Electoral
Hesse and Saxony. All those Powers, which compose the
Germanic Confederation, excepting Prussia and Austria, are
now governed by constitutions, the principles of which accord
with those of our political organization. These are the nations
that we ought to hail as our natural allies. Count them, and you
will see that we have now more real allies than we ever before
possessed. The two Hon. Deputies to whom lam now replying
have talked of negotiations which, before the insurrection of W ar-
saw were opened betweenßussiaand Poland, the object of which
was’to induce the Polish army to march against France. I conf.ss
f pannot comprehend how negotiations are conducted between a
Sovereign who commands, and subjects who obey. This ap-
uears m© aa entire, new principle in politics. But it has been
said other’ facts speak plainer still. \on are perhaps ignorant
that Baron Strogonoff, Major-General in the Russian army,
was some time ago at Berlin commissioned to stipulate a
passage for the Russian troops through the Prussian territories.
Th»re happened to be another personage at Berlm-.-ao otherthan
Field Marshal Diebitscb himself-and it was to him that these
negotiations, if any such there were, must have been intrusted :
and I am happy in being able to declare to you what must, alter
all have been the result of these deep negotiations. Prussia,
firmly determined to act upon principles that would ultimately
tend to preserve peace, has displayed both wisdom and modera-
tion, and. presented to all other nations m example of policy
which tends to preserve the repose and harmony of States from
every attack. (Hear.) But Austria, they add-for they must
run through all the States of Europe, and in these excursions, so
often repeated, 1 do not recollect that they have produced any
new idea, but have merely re-produced arguments which had
been before refuted-(“True, true ’ from the Centre)—hut
Austria 1 see with what indefatigable vigour she pursues her
warlike preparations. Ambassadors, to whom the King has been
pleased to grant his confidence, have been mentioned. It has
been asked whether he who has the honour to represent the King
of the French at London grounds his policy upon principles in
conformity to the interests and dignity of France, and upon
respect for the liberties of nations and the independence of states’
Xt is sufficient for me to r©nfi nd him of the career of that able
Diplomatist, who, at Vienna, after all our disasters, succeeded
J l /-. including a treaty, the stipulations of which aggrandised the
fm-mer territory of 'France ; and who, in 1815, preferred the
resignation' of his high functions to the disgrace of signing a
tre’-tv of dire ful memory. A to his Majesty s Ambassador in
Rnlsi. if there is any man truly worthy of representing Franci
im 1 W King ft is Duke de Mortemart. (Cheers.) I shall
conclude wdtb mt> worts more. You have never desire,
peace—neither in the men.’h of August, nor in the month of De-
S,l , nor in the month of 1’ arch. W e however have always
hoped that we might be able to pi¥*erve this great blessing fo.
our country, and we will use all our efforts to maintain it still,
(This speech was followed by loud and repeated cheers.)
Nothing further of interest took place during this sitting.

DUTCH PAPERS.
THE HAGUE, April 2.
SECOND CHAMBER OF THE STATES GENERAL.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed the Chamber in a
discourse of which the following is the substance :
The Minister of Finance having, in the course of the week,
stated the sum requisite for the public expenditure, and the
means of providing for it, the Chamber has to complete informa-
tion on the subject, especially the reasons which call for such
expenses for the army, and the defence of the frontier fortresses.
His Excellency had, two months ago, expressed his hopes of a
favourable result of the negotiations with the five Great Powers ;
those hopes have been fulfilled by the Protocols Nos. 11 and 12,
which regulate, in an equitable manner, the chief points of the
separation of the two divisions of the kingdom, viz. the demarc-
ation of the frontier, and the share to be borne by each in the debt.
The King intimated his assent to these terms, and reasonably ex-
pected that every thing would soon be arranged. He observed,
that farther armaments in Belgium were now without an object,
and that they should cease, in order that the armaments on our
side might also be put an end to.
Contrary to expectation, no progress w r as made since the be-
ginning of the year : all those successively invested with power
in Belgium, even the present Regent, have shown no disposition
to execute the Protocols, but on the contrary. The Powers re-
presented in the Congress of London were treated in a manner
that could not be expected in civilised Europe even in the midst
of war. Our territory is continually violated by Belgian marau-
ders, w r ho make individuals residing near the frontiers feel all
the hardships of war. Ihe communication with Maestricht is
in some degree open, but the Belgian troops have by no means
retired to the positions which they occupied before the 21st of
November, 1830; nay, the Belgians have gone further, and pub-
licly propose to renew hostilities with us. The Regent has
sworn to a Constitution which is at variance with the rights of
Holland, and with the Protocols of the Five Powers, and in his
installation issued a Proclamation which shows a manifest disre-
gard to all that has been done.
His Excellency submits to the Chambers the documents which
show the course of affairs, and prove his Majesty’s earnest wish
to arrive at some final settlement, that he may alleviate the bur-
dens which press so heavily on Holland. However, his Majesty
had no choice but to provide for the security of the frontiers, and
to deprive the insurgents even of the notion that they might at-
tack us. Half measures would not do. It was necessary to
extend the measures of defence to all the points threatened, to
the whole of the line of our fortresses. For what would have
happened had those lawless bands penetrated into the heart of
our country ! Would they not have caused us injuries far greater
than the burdens which we now have to bear ! His Majesty
deeply regrets having had no other choice. The present aspect
of the citizens and inhabitants of some States baffles the calcula-
tions of politicians, and has great influence on the question of
peace or war. The dissolution of society, the overthrow of le-
gitimate authority, are no longer rare occurrences. Agitators
aiming at their own aggrandizement, find, in their incessant at-
tempts, short-sighted nations ready to throw away the good which
the laws ensure for a sudden change, by which they think to
obtain continual amelioration. Among those nations Belgium
has the first rank. Its dangerous neighbourhood obliges us to
provide for the defence of our southern frontiers, against a licen-
tious populace, as we defend our western frontier from the fury
of the ocean. Perhaps, however, the hour is not distant when
the Powers may think of opposing with vigour the unjust preten-
sions of the Belgians. At all events, the Government of Hol-
land must not cense for a moment to take all measures required
to maintain the honour, the independence, the inviolability of
our territory, and its financial interests.

THURSDAY E YEN I DIG, APRIL 7.
The Messager des Chambres , dated yesterday, and the
other French Papers of Tuesday, arrived this morning. We
have given some extracts from those of Monday in another
column, and also an account of an interesting discussion in
the Chamber of Deputies. The latest extracts, which w e
subjoin, represent the news from Lithuania to be favourable to
the Poles, and are interesting, if not important. The French
Funds, as will be seen, have a little recovered from the shock
given to them by the news respecting Italy, and the conse-
quent warlike aspect of affairs.
(From the Messager des Chambres dated yesterday.)
“ Several letters from the frontiers of Poland state that the
Sultan has declared war against Russia, and that the manifesto
has already reached Vienna.
“ It is generally believed that the mission of the eldest son of
M. Casimir Perrier to London has for object to assure the Eng-
lish Government that France places entire confidence in the
justice of Great Britain, and that France will only take up arras,
if forced to do so, in defence of her dignity and her national ho-
nour, and not for the purpose of aggrandizement.
“ A letter from Florence, dated March 24, says, * Sixteen hun-
dred Austrians have just passed through this city, on their way
■o Rome. Tuscany begins to he in an agitated state, from the
arrival of troops, and it is probable that in the struggle which is
about to take place, that country will not preserve the tranquillity
which it has hitherto enjoyed.
“ A letter from Bayonne, dated March 30, says, ‘The arrests
continue at Madrid. More than 40 of the heads of the principal
families of this capital have been put on trial before Military
Commissions. The insurrection at Valencia has been put
down. Several persons of distinction were also arrested in that
city, as well as at Bilboa, Vittoria, and Saragossa. It is reported
that 2,000 prisoners in the Tsla de Leon have been shot. Torrijos
lias now 1,800 men with him, and not 3,000 as was before stated.
He is opposed by such considerable forces, that all resistance
would be ineffectual, whatever may he his efforts and his
. outage. It now appears certain that on all points where at-
tempts were made to raise the Constitutional banner, the discon-
tented patriots have found a population at least indifferent, and
roops faithful to King Ferdinand, so that for the present their
hopes are entirely destroyed.’
(From GalignanVs Messenger.)
“ PARIS, April 5.
“ The renunciation of the military cartel, says the National,
oncluded in 1827, between France and Bavaria, took place on
he part of France on the 20th of February. This renuncia-
:ion is founded upon the political principle established by the
present French Government, not to give up to foreign Govern-
ments any fugitive whatever, and, consequently, not to deliver up
my deserter when he has once touched the French soil. Allsimi-
ur cartels concluded during the restoration have likewise been
mnulled.
“A Frankfort Journal says :—‘The warlike preparations that
\ustria has been making for three months are well known.
Prussia does not remain behind hand. One hundred and twenty
heusand men are stationed between Erfurth and the frontiers of
Belgium. The eighth corps is close to that frontier; the seventh
etween Zuliers, \Vesel, and Coblentz ; the fourth in Westpha-
l a ; and the third in Thuringia.’
“ The following from Cracow is dated March 20 : —‘ It is
rumoured that Polish Deputies sent to the Russian head-quarters
have been received there, and have opened negotiations. This
circumstance, if it be confirmed, would he a good omen, for
hitherto Marshal Diebitsch has refused all kind of negotiation,
all eging the commands of the Emperor, wffio requires blind sub-
mi sion. General Chlopicki is better. There have been no
IVe h operations of war, but the Russians have still to struggle
against had weather, sc rcity, diseases, and the partial insurrec-
ti< ns of the peasants in the Palatinates of Lublin and Augustowo.’
• • Extract of a letter of the 29th ult., from Milan ‘ The bat-
talion of Students, kno;yp by the name of la Pallade, has had a
murderous encounter with the Austrians between Forli and Ri-
mini. The Germans did not expect to meet with so powerful a
r si-stance in that quarter, and were completely defeated. The
| patriots lost about 150 men, but they carried away a great many
arms, and three pieces of cannon. General Frimont. hearing
that the patriots will not always be disposed to retreat, has given
orders, it is said, for 12,090 more Austrians to enter the Roman
States from Verona. The vexations exercised upon strangers
become daily more annoying. It is probable, that when the
States of the Pope are again placed under the yoke, all foreigners
established here will he expelled.’
“ The Journal du Commerce gives the following extract of a
letter, dated Orvieto, March 23 ‘ The Count de St. Aulaire, in
passing through the Campagna di Roma, met with a detachment
of Constitutional troops, and announced to them the arrival of
the Austrians at Florence. * Return home,’ added lie, ‘ for,
if you do not withdraw, you will be massacred by the Aus-
trians. If you rely upon France, you are wrong; for the King,
my Sovereign, has directed me to suppoit the temporal power of
the Pope.’
“ The Hamburgh Correspondent states, after official returns,
that the Polish army, assembled in and near Warsaw, now
amounts to 60,000 men, and the corps of Geneial Dwernicki,
with the other free corps, to 20,000 men.
“ Letters from Barcelona of the 26th ult. contain the follow-
ing : —* The delivery of the letters by the last mail was delayed
for between two and three hours. A dispatch had been entrusted
to the postilion, to be delivered by him into the hands of the
Count d’Espagne, who is confined by indisposition at Sarria, and
the other letters were not distributed till the Count had ex-
amined the contents of his packet. It appears that other dis-
patches have occasioned arrests in several places between
Madrid and Barcelona, particularly at Sarragossa and Valencia.
It is said that in Madrd itself several Frenchmen have been put
in prison. No arrest took place at Barcelona in the course of the
26th, but the public mind was rendered very uneasy. The ap-
pearance of several French ships of war, in the bay of Barcelona,
had given rise to various conjectures. The Lent sermons were
seasoned with many imprecations against France, her King Louis
Philip, and his Government. A person, arrived from Figueras,
declares that ho saw a deserter from the 27th regiment of the
French line publicly walking about the streets, with the white
cockade in his cap. Other French refugees have taken up their
residence in the town, and are tolerated by the authorities.’
“ The Qnotidienne contains the following:— 4 It is now known
that the Baron de Montgenet. who acted so disgraceful a part in
the affair of Geslain and Duez, had been charged by M. Treil-
hard, then Prefect of Police, to proceed to Holyrood, as a partisan
of the fallen family, in order to become acquainted with the
Paris correspondents of that family. He was entrusted by
Geslain with several letters, the answers to which he delivered ;
to the Police. He informed the Procureur General of the pre-
sence of Geslain at the apartment of his mistress. Two days
after, Geslain was arrested. M. de Montgenet is a chef-
d’escadron, attached to the staff, and a Knight of the Legion of
Honour.”
(From the Constitutionnel.)
“ BOLOGNA, March 22.
“ After four days of combat between Novi and Modena, Gen.
Zucchi, yielding to superior force, has retired, taking with him
two pieces of brass cannon, six small pieces, much ammunition,
and three or four millions of silver taken from the Government
chest. These sums have been remitted to a responsible agent,
and will be devoted to the defence of the free provinces. The
Government of Bologna, and a part of the Deputies of the United
Provinces, have directed themselves upon Pesaro, to retire upon
Ancona, if the Austrians continue their march into the interior.
The fortifications of this place have been repaired, the citadel
provided with provisions and ammunition sufficient to resist for a
long time, although the best of the works w r ere destroyed in 1815
by the Austrians, w r ho sold the materials to th<i Roman Govern-
ment. General Frimont lends himself with much complaisance
to the claims for numerous arrests made by Cardinal Opizzoni.
Many officers of the National Guard of Bologna, who never
quitted the city, have been arrested, and the blood of the Italian
patriots will soon begin to flow.
(From the Journal des Debats.)
“ A Journal of Warsaw, of the 22d March, announces, on the
authority ofletters from Cracow, that the Sultan has declared war
against Russia, and that the manifesto has been received at
Vienna. General Dwernicki has been named ‘Purveyor of
Cannons,’ on account of the number of guns wdiich he has taken.
The Russians have begun to make use of frightfulmeans to depo-
pulate the country; they carry away with them all the men.
The cruelty which the enemy developes every where as he proceeds
will become fatal to himself. At this moment, Russian couriers
can travel no part of the country without powerful escorts.
Over the whole route from Pultusk to Augustow, terror is so
widely spread among the Russians, that large detachments dared
not pass the night in towns without having previously raised en-
trenchments. It is now no uncommon thing for a Russian to go
over from our side, who took the ranks with theavo-wed intention
of fighting for the liberties of Russia as well as of Poland. As
the Russians were quitting Lublin, before General Dwernicki,

The Brussels Papers which arrived this morning contain
ihe following account of the discussion in the National Con-
gress on the 2d. Tranquillity had been restored at Brussels,
but it will be perceived with regret that a disgraceful outrage
lus taken place at Ghent.
“ BRUSSELS, April 4.
“ NATIONAL CONGRESS, April 2.
“ The Order of the Day was the debate on the Decree for
calling out the first division of the Civic Guard.
“ Some of the Members said, they ought first to learn from
the Ministers whether this measure was really so urgently ne-
cessary.
” M. Lebeau, Minister for Foreign Affairs, said he was ready
to give the Assembly all the information in his power.
“M. de Robaulx —lt is indispensable, and, at the same time
impossible, for the Assembly to appreciate our situation with
respect to Foreign Powers, and the necessity of adopting the
measures proposed to us, because the Ministry has communi-
cated nothing respecting this situation ; yet, events have taken
place, couriers have arrived, and their dispatches must have an-
nounced something. I therefore ask—
“ 1. What has passed between the Belgic Government and
the Congress, since the last communications !
“2. What is demanded ; and what is the state of affairs re-
specting the boundaries of the territory ; and the debt !
“ 3. Which are the Powers that pretend to subject us to the
Protocols !
“ 4. Has M. d’Aerschot been officially received at London ?
Is an English fleet preparing to blockade the Scheldt !
“ 5. Has the Belgic Government sent an ultimatum to Holland ;
and has King William answered !
“M. Forgeur —l will put a sixth question :—ls there a new
plan for the choice of the head of the state! It seems that what
is passing on the subject is no longer a secret to anybody!
“ M. Lebeau said, the report of his predecessor stopped at the
nomination of the Regent, and there was therefore a break from
Feb. 24, to March 28, which he could not fill up; he was
called upon on the 29th March ; but he had just entered on the
office, and could not give the information asked.
“It is important to rectify a general error. It has been sup-
posed that the violation of the principle of our intervention
dated only from the Protocol of December 20 ; I am sorry that
this Protocol was not returned, and therefore it seems that the
principle of intervention was recognised by us, for the reserves
in this Protocol, by which the Congress assumes the right of con-
stituting Belgium on the basis of the treaties of 1814 and 1815,
and refuses to recognise Luxemburg as part of Belgium, are ma-
nifestly an intervention. But this principle of intervention is
in fact contained in the Protocol of November 17, which, after
laying down the time of the armistice, accepted by us, says, that
when we engaged ourselves with respect to Holland to abjure the
conditions of the armistice, we also made this arrangement with
the five Powers. This Protocol likewise was not returned, and
you know that in diplomacy to return is to refuse. A protest is not
so strong a measure as sending back. A declaration should have been
made, stating, that the national honour would not permit us to
accept tliis Protocol unless this clause was struck out. This was
not done, and you all see how it was turned against us ; not only
were the Protocols of November 17, and December 20, not
sent back, hut even the note of the 6th January was received ;
now it seems to me that the necessity of sending back
this note was evident. The facts thus laid down we must submit
to their inevitable consequences. The germs of usurpation
being thus introduced into our first diplomatic acts, will hear
their fruit; the course of the future negotiations must be impeded
by them, for we cannot possibly leave out of the question facts
which have actually taken place.
“ The Protocol of the 9th of January, ordering the opening of
the Scheldt, on condition of the raising ©f the blockade of Maes-
tricht on our part, on pain of being compelled by force, received
an answer worthy of the honour of the country. But an answer
is nothing ! The Protocol should have been sent back: it
soon produced new fruits. However, the protest of the
Congress against the Protocol of the 20th of January leaves us
the right to make war, and opens a new diplomatic career.
The Protocol of tiie 20th of January, relative to the boundaries,
was followed by that of the 27th of January, concerning the
debt. This was sent hack, and you know the consequences of
this step. A latter Protocol, which has not even been communi-
cated to us, acknowledging that of the 27th of Jan. (which be-
sides was disapproved by the French Government), contained
only proposals. That of the 7tl* of February, excluding the
Duke of Nemours and the Duke of Leuchtenberg, was returned.
We have seen none since.
“ With respect to the question put to him, M. Lebeau replied,
that M. de Aerschot had had several extra-official conferences
with Lord Palmerston ; but he did not .know whether he had
yet been received officially. The Envoy to Paris had been re-
ceived officially.
“ The Government has received nothing from the Congress at
London since the last communication. All the Powers, except
Prance, think we ought to be ruled by the Protocols.
“ The Government has no notice of a threat to blockade the
Scheldt. He had found no trace of an ultimatum sent to Holland:
the choice of the head of the State is under serious consideration ■
the Minister believes peace still possible. War, when not in-
evitable, is madness. We shall do our utmost to preserve peace;
but if we see that it is intended to impose on us, we know that
we have our army, our Civic Guard, our fortresses well armed
and provisioned, and then the Ministry will not hesitate to pro-
pose war.
“ M. Van de Weyer rose to correct some mistake of the
preceding speaker; the break in the report of which bespoke
did not exist, and with respect to the ultimatum sent to Holland,
i'- was not thought advisable to send a Charg£ d’Affaires to the
Hague, lest he should be treated as a rebel. They had, therefore,
treated with Holland through France and England. M. Van de
Weyer denied the assertion that by not sending back the Proto-
cols the system of intervention was sanctioned.
| “ Some further conversation took place, in which M. Lebeau
! said, that as the new plan respecting the choice ot a Sovereign
j was a secret to nobody, he need not name him.
j “ The Dutch have taken possession not of fort Callao, as has
| been said, but of fort St. Mary, and as soon as the Government
heard of it a notice was sent by a courier to signify to the Dutch
that if the fort were not restored in a quarter of an hour the
Belgians would employ their cannon.
“ BRUSSELS, April 4.
“ It is said that Gen. Vandermissen passed through Arlon on
the 31st, and escaped into the French territory, passing through
I.ongwy.
“ Several persons have been arrested at Liege, who took part
in the late excesses.
“ GHENT, April 4.
“ A deplorable event has justafflicted our city. M. Voortman,
a manufacturer, was arrested by the populace at the door of his
manufactory, to which he had come in a cabriolet. He was ac-
cused of Orangeism. The mob went to his manufactory to de-
mand some cannon, said to be deposited there. M. Voortman,
on his way to the place, was warned of what was passing, and
advised to turn hack ; trusting in the arms lie carried about him,
lie unhappily persisted, and when he got to the place was attacked
and disarmed, and required to give up the cannon, which he refused.
He was then led away by two soldiers of the Civic Guard, and the
mob carried him about the city; on the bridge of L’Eclure a
dagger dropped from his coat, on which a woman struck him in
1 ire face with a wooden shoe and drew blood ; the soldiers in
vain tried to protect him from the popular fury ; one of them
received several blows aimed at the unfortunate manufacturer,
who, when they reached tire market-place, was promenaded
three times round the tree of liberty, against which they dashed
iiis face and horribly mutilated it. They then led him through
several streets to the parade, where Baron Coppens saved him
from being massacred, and had him taken to prison to rescue him
from inevitable death : but probably this succour will prove to be
too late. The surgeon who dressed him, found thatiie had received
eleven bayonet and two sabre wounds. His life is despaired of.
it is reported that the vengeance of the people was drawn on him
by his having said to his men who asked for work, * If you have
nothing to eat go and suck the tree of liberty, which you have
planted.’ Nothing is left of the manufactory but the bare Walls.
“ BRUSSELS, April 5.
“ A British Cabinet messenger arrived here yesterday wit!)
dispatches for the English Embassy, and immediately set out
with other dispatches for Germany.
“ It is affirmed, that orders have been sent to make all tie
troops at Namur that can he spared, march to Luxemburg.”
The accounts from all quarters concur in stating that
brighter prospects are opening for the Poles, and give the hope
of their not only having the ardent wishes of liberal-minded;
Governments for their success, but even the support of the
Ottoman Porte. On a former occasion we expressed our
opinion that it would be a very beneficial matter if the British
Government had a confidential person in Poland, from whom
they could be furnished with authentic information as to the
actual state of the armies, the sentiments of the Poles, their
resources, &,c. Every account we receive from that quarter
confirms us in the opinion that such an agent would be
highly useful. We perfectly conceive, that, under the
existing connection and good fellowship which sub-
sist between this country and Russia, Great Britain)
could not with propriety send or nominate a diplo-
matic agent to Warsaw, or rather to the Polish Diet ; butt
tiie object could be attained in another way, and give no
ground for offence; in fact, British subjects and British
property,'require that some person should be on the spot to
take tiie needful measures for their safety and protection..
We think it hardly necessary to point attention to the subject,,
as we are satisfied that our Government will omit no oppor-
tunity of furthering British interests by all means in their
power.
A report is in circulation that a communication has been
or ened between the Poles and the Sublime Porte, and that
Envoys have been mutually sent from Warsaw and Constan-
tinople. This rumour is certainly countenanced by the:
French Papers, which even go the length of saying that war
has actually been declared by the Porte against Russia -
An insurrection, it is also asserted, has taken place in
Courland.
The German Papers, which arrived this morning, contains
accounts from Warsaw, but the dates are not later than those
in the French Papers, and there is nothing else in them worth
extracting.
The last number of Blackwood’s Magazine contains- an
article on the debate which preceded the division on the
Reform Bill, in the course of which the writer says—
“ Such is a sketch, rapid and imperfect it must be allowed, of
the great debate on the bringing in of the Reform Bill; but who
can describe within a few pages the minute particulars of seven
times seven hours speech-making 1 Upon the whole debate we-
should not fear to leave it to any honest critic, of any party, to
decide which had the advantage, sure of a decision in favour of
the speeches against the measure. In the mortifying conscious-
ness of this being the fact, the friends of Ministers cry out
against the right of borough Members to have been heard at
all upon the question. So violently unjust a point was, we sup-
pose, never before set up upon a matter where public rights were
in controversy. Why should not borough Members be heard ?
They do not appear as witnesses in their own cause—they are,
as Members of the House of Commons, Members for the whole
country, and on an equality, as senators, with any other Mem-
bers. They are pleading a cause, not giving evidence, and they
come fortii as champions in the fair field of argument, to stand
or fall by the test of truth and facts, which are open alike to all.
If the Members for boroughs be able men, should we not he
cautious how - we interfere with the system which brings them
into the House I—if they be not able men, why are their speeches
thus feared 1 for, as yet, it is not the interference of their votes
which has been objected to.”
We are not surprised that the old and acknowledged
champion of the Anti-Reformers should attempt to persuade
himself and his readers that the Boroughmongers had the
lies - , of the argument in the House of Commons ; but we think
he will find it difficult to convince any sensible and unpre-
judiced man that they had any argument at all. It would
be just as easy to convince a reflecting and impartial man
that the John Bull, the Morning Post, the Quarterly Review,
and Blackwood, are, of all the newspaper and periodical
press, the only publications in which reason and argument
have been brought forward on the Reform question. In


answer lo the question, “If the Members for Boroughs.
be able men, should we not be cautious how we inter-
fere with the system which brings them into the House?”
we will only say, that however able they may be, yet if the
system be an imperfect and unjust one, and an equal number
of able men can be brought into the House of Commons by a
popu'ar and just system, it is our duty to resort to it. If the
present Borough Members be able and upright men, it is by
mere chance only that they are so, for there is nothing in the
system itself to prevent the most ignorant and profligate, so
that they be also wealthy men, from sitting in the House of
Commons, for a very great portion at least of the close
boroughs. We wish to have some better guarantee for the
capacity and integrity of Members than the mere lottery of
chance, and therefore think that much good would arise from
throwing open the field of competition to men of talent and
integrity, who would have to face the electors with their cha-
racters in their hands. It is no argument to say, that because
some of the close boroughs have fallen to the lot of honour-
able men, the close borough system is therefore a good one.
The House of Commons would not be shut to men of talent
by the abolition of rotten boroughs; on the contrary, it
would be thrown more open to them. The only difference
would be, that they would then go in at the wide door like
honest men—not sneak in by back passages as if they were
unworthy of being classed among the representatives of the
people.
The late trial at Kingston will, we hope, be followed by
one beneficial result—it will fix the attention of the Legis-
lature on the melancholy fact that attempts to destroy life by
means of poison have become frequent, and are likely to be-
come even more so, unless some farther restraint be imposed
upon the facility of obtaining the means of destruction. We
are quite aware that no legislative enactment can have the
effect of preventing the sale of poisons altogether, for the
adoption of the most virulent class of poisons into medical
practice must render their sale general, and consequently lead
to occasional mischief from their wrong application; hut
surely something may be done to prevent the very shameful
negligence, or worse than negligence, of the retailers of drugs,
so as to diminish the frequency of the cases of intentional and
accidental poisoning. It is really disgraceful to the Legislature
that means are not adopted to restrain unprincipled druggists
from accommodating those who, with a few pence,and a paltry
excuse that they require poison for the purpose of killing ver-
min, may now obtain with facility the means of destroying
themselves or others. The mere possibility of accident from
the use of poisons, to say nothing of the horrid character of
the crime of its wilful administration, ought to be sufficient
to make the sale of them, except under particular restrictions,
a highly penal offence; and when we consider how little real
inconvenience to the public would be occasioned by any
restrictions compared with the very serious results of the
facilities now afforded to purchasers, we find it impossible to
refrain from telling our legislators, that unless they make an
attempt to check the evil, they will neglect their duty as guar-
dians and correctors of the public morals. Every day fur-
nishes proofs of the ease with which poisons—not only those
inordinary use, such as arsenic, opium, and oxalic acid,
but even those of recent date, as prussic acid and acetate of
morphine—may be obtained by the public, and we trust that
another Session of Parliament will not be allowed to pass over
without an effort at least to remedy an evil of so serious and
alarming a nature. “They manage these things better in
France,” and indeed on the Continent, generally, very strict
regulations are in force for preventing the indiscriminate sale
of poisons.
Dispatches have this morning been received at the Foreign
Office, from our Minister at Berlin.
“ CITY, Twelve o’Clock.
“ The rise in the French Funds, and the hopes entertained
that the affaiis of Austria and France will be amicably arranged,
added to the near approach of the settlement of the present ac-
count in the Stock Exchange, have tended to create more con-

Powers placed in the same predicament.
The Lords Commissioners of the Treasury have given no-
tice to the Commissioners for the Reduction of the' National
Debt that the total surplus revenue of the United Kingdom,
over the expenditure of the year which ended on the sth of
January last, amounted to 2,913,673/. 2s. 4}d. The Com-
missioners for the Reduction of the Debt have, in consequence,
just given notice that for the quarter which commenced yes-
terday, and ending on the sth July next, one-fourth part of
this surplus will be made applicable to the reduction of the
national debt, viz., 728,418/. ss. 7d. The amount to be em-
ployed as a sinking fund during the current quarter is less
than that appropriated in reducing the public debt during the
quarter just ended—there having been paid out by the Com-
missioners, in the period last mentioned, the sum of
747,601/. Bs. BJd. The Commissioners yesterday made their
first purchases for the present year—they bought Reduced
Annuities, Consols, and Three and a Half per Cent. Stocks.

The Aurora Borealis. —lt is now considered as a settled
point, that the phenomenon of the aurora borealis has its origin
in electricity; though philosophers, in discussing the subject,
speak with a degree of mysteriousness which affords a suspicion
that “ the light within them is yet,” comparatively speaking,
“ but darkness.” At the same time, appearances are certainly
in favour of the electric theory ; particularly the sound which
these streamers are known to emit, and which bears a strong re-
semblance to the crackling noise proceeding from an electrifying
machine when in operation, though of course much louder.
Doubts, it is true, are entertained respecting the actual existence
of this sound ; and it is certain that the members of the Arctic
Expedition, under Franklin and Richardson, never once heard it,
although, from its forming the subject of a part of their instruc-
tions from Government, they bestowed the closest attention in
watching the phenomenon. They were assured, however, by
their Canadian attendants, that this sound had been heard by
them hundreds of times ; and the persons expressed their sur-
prise that a circumstance of such common and frequent occur-
rence should be the subject of doubt From an Article in the
Edinburgh Journal of Science.
Deception Island.— This island, one of the new South Shet-
land group, was visited by Lieutenant Kendall, while belonging
to the ship Chanticleer, Captain Foster, and a notice of his ob-
servations was read before a late meeting of the Royal Geogra-
phical Society. It is situated in lat. 62. 55. S. and long. 60. 28.
W., and is of a volcanic origin. The interior of it is occupied by
a circular lake, which communicates with the sea on its S,E.
side. Compact lava, ashes, and pumice-stone, are among the com-
ponent parts of the island, the highest part of which is about
1,800 feet above the sea. It seems that volcanic action is still in
progress, as many apertures were found, from which steam was
constantly issuing with a loud noise. Hot springs abound in the
island, and Lieutenant Kendall found water at a temperature of
140. issuing from under the snow-clad surface of the ground,
and running into the sea. Alum was seen in several place's. The
remains of a wreck were found, too old, however, to afford any
clue to the name of the vessel, or the country to which she had
belonged.— lbid.
That snug little theatre, the Sans Souei, in Leicester-place,
has just been newly fitted up for meetings, concerts, &c. and is
now engaged by Messrs. Smith and Dolier for the delivery ot
their very useful and truly entertaining lectures on Early Educa-
tion. It will be opened for this purpose next Monday evening ;
and when we consider the lively interest which Messrs. Smith
and Dolier have excited at the London and other Institutions, and
the direct patronage which their Majesties recently conferred
upon them for their exertions in improving the practical educa-
tion of children of the higher classes, we cannot doubt that our
intellectual countrymen and countrywomen will take great plea-
sure in attending to the delightful subjects treated of by these
highly favoured lecturers.
Notwithstanding the Viscount de Beaulieu’s severe proclama-
tion, declaring Antwerp in a state of siege, and ordering all the
wine-houses to be closed, on the very first day a grenadier was
found on his post desperately drunk. He was taken before the
Commander, who, before condemning him to he shot, had the
consideration to give him an opportunity of explaining. The
muddled soldier scratched his head, and at last stammered out,
“ Why, General, your proclamation says the refractory are to be
fired on with grape-shot, and, as I had none, I thought it my duty
to provide myself with ammunition I’’ Beaulieu laughed, and the
grenadier escaped with a caution to be more sober and less witty
for the future.
Matrimony. —“ They manage these things differently in
France.” The following advertisement appeared in the Consti-

A letter from Messina, dated March, says, “ After having for
several days experienced several shocks of an earthquake, of
more or less violence, we have witnessed a new opening in the
crater of Mount Etna, which was followed by a considerable
eruption. As this opening did not take place towards Catana,
in the direction of the sea, as has usually been the case, but
towards the west, the stream of lava took a direction to the in-
terior.”
It is said that one of the concerts given at the Opera in Paris)
by Signor Paganini, produced him 16,500 francs. An amateur
has made the following calculation upon this amount. The per-
former played during the evening three pieces, each covering
about five pages of music, of six rows, giving about 91 measures
to the page. The fifteen pages thus contained 1,365 measures
by which the 16,500 francs are to be divided. The quotient will
he 12 francs for each measure, or the proportions will be ns fol-
low : —For a round, 12f.; a minim, or while note, 6f.; a black
note, 3f.; a crotchet, If. 50c.; a double crotchet, 15 sous ; a
triple crotchet, 7} sous. And, on the other hand :—For a pause,
15f.; a demi pause, 6f.; a minim rest, 3f.; a demi rest, If. 50c.;
a quarter of a rest, 75c. There would still, out of the 16,500
francs, remain 120 francs, which is exactly the price of such a
violin as the Conservatory awards as a prize to its most distin-
guished pupils.— Le Furet de Londres.
The following instance of honesty and self-denial is, we fear,
not likely to find many imitators among our London coachmen oi
cal) drivers. A five hundred franc note was a few days since for-
gotten in the cabriolet No. 227, in the street Croix des petits
Champs, in Paris, and was restored to the owner by the driver,
Philippe Gonzales, an old Spaniard, who had served many years
during the war in the French armies. The veteran obstinately
refused to take any pecuniary recompense for his honesty, but
after much entreaty accepted of the uniform of the National
Guard, which he had been compelled to leave a short time before,
in consequence of his poverty.
A Russian soldier, who was made prisoner in the affair at
Wawry, begged hard for quarter. When asked by one of the
Poles, what made him fight against them 1 “It is not my fault,”
he replied, “ I received a rouble, and was told that 1 was about
to fight the French.” When questioned as to what country he
was in, he answered, that he believed himself to be in Belgium.
—Le Temps.
The following is mentioned among the numerous traits of pa-
triotism displayed by the Poles. Two young men of the Palati-
nate of Augustowo were at the point of fighting a duel on the Ist
of January last. In place, however, of fighting, they mutually
swore to devote themselves to the service of their country. They
joined the army, and were severely wounded in the actions of the
24th and 25th of February. Both are in the same hospital at
Warsaw, where, now united in the most fervent attachment, they
have renewed their vow of fighting for liberty.— Counter des
Electeurs.
At the late military review at Paris, a grenadier of the 12th
legion of the national guard cried out just as the King was
passing, “ Vive le Roi! II nous faut la guerre.” After his Ma-
jesty had sufficiently removed from the spot, M. Agier, the
colonel of that battalion, formed the company to which the
grenadier belonged into a circle, and held a sort of Swiss court-
nartial on him. His comrades instantly voted the expulsion of
the grenadier.
Ihe Church of St. Michael, Crooked-lane, which is now being
taken down for the approaches to the new London Bridge, and in
which a great alarm took place on the last performance of divine
worship, has become an object of much curiosity. The patron-
age of this church was anciently in the Prior and Convent of
Canterbury, in whom it continued till 1408, since which time it
lias been in the Archbishops of that See, and is one of the 13
peculiars within the city, belonging to that Archbishop. Among
the ancient monuments preserved in this church, is that of Sir
William Walworth, who slew Wat Tyler, in Smitiifield ; one to
the memory of Queen Elizabeth ; and the following concise epi-
taph on the tomb of a parishioner :

COURIER OFFICE, Four o’Clock.
We have just received, by Express, a letter from Frankfort,
dated April 3, which states that official accounts had been
received there from Berlin, announcing that the whole of the
duchy of Samogotie, as far as Georgenburg, on the frontiers
of Poland, is in a slate of open insurrection. Apprehensions
are entertained that this insurrection will extend to Volhyani
and Podolia. The particulars have not reached us, but it is
supposed that the guards, whose advance had aleady reached
Pultusk, will be obliged to retire. General Geismar was at
Grochno on the 26th; the Field Marshal’s head-quarters at
Sienica ; General DeWitt at Pulawy; Generals Toll and
Kreutz at Lublin and round Zaraosc, into which fortress
Dwernicki was obliged to retire.
The following is from our Brussels Correspondent :
“ BRUSSELS, April 3.
“ No further attempts have been made at this place to renew
the abominations of last week. Ghent has been less fortunate ;
riots took place there yesterday. M. Voortman, a manufacturer,
was attacked by the populace, and would have shared the fate
of the unfortunate Gaillard, of Louvain, had not his mangled
body been rescued from the hands of his infuriated assailants by
some Officers of the Civic Guard. The condition of a country,
in which such excesses are carried on with impunity, requires
no comment. It is time, however, that France should frankly
unite with her Allies in adopting vigorous measures to terminate
a state of misrule and terrorism, at once fatal to the interests of
Belgium, dangerous to the peace of neighbouring States, and
disgraceful to civilization.
“ It is generally reported that the late disturbances have been
countenanced and encouraged by France—that is to say, not by
the French Government, hut by the agents of the Republicans.
There is much truth in this, for there is no doubt that the dema-
gogues of both countries lean upon each other for support; and in
proportion as their doctrines become less influential in France,
they are the more eager to keep up the flame in this country. The
interest of Louis Philip and his Constitutional Ministry is to de-
sire the restoration of order in a country so immediately conti-
guous to France, and it is also the interest of the Re-
publicans to perpetuate that state of anarchy and confusion
which, if continued much longer, must lead to the subversion of
the Government, and to the realisation of their favourite theory.
It is for this reason that the French party have hitherto opposed,
and will oppose, every combination tending to the consolidation of
Belgian independence under a monarchical sceptre. It is for this
reason that the Gallo-Belgic Journals already cry out against
Prince Leopold, and endeavour to alarm the nation with the bug-
bear of British influence. But fortunately the sane part of the
nation is of a different opinion.”
IRELAND.
Mr. O'Connell has addressed a letter to the freeholders of the
Queen’s County, urging them to return Sir Henry Parnell. The
Learned Gentleman earnestly assures the electors that the unani-
mous return of Sir Henry Parnell, for an Irish county, at the
present moment, would be a fact of the utmost utility to the car-
rying of the great measure of parliamentary reform ; and that
the measure of parliamentary reform is the most useful to public
liberty, to constitutional freedom, to the attainment of cheap
government and free institutions, and to the permanent peace
ind prosperity of Ireland that was ever brought before the Bri-
tish Parliament.
The election of a Representative in Parliament for the city of
Londonderry, has terminated in the return ot Sir R. Ferguson.
A meeting of graduates of the Dublin University was held in
the hall of the Guild of Merchants in that city, on Monday, to
receive the report of a Committee appointed to consider the
propriety of petitioning Parliament for an extension of the
elective franchise under the proposed Reform Bill. The Com-
mittee recommended a petition to the Legislature, praying that
the University of Dublin might be assimilated to the Univer-
sities of Oxford and Cambridge in its elective privileges. The
report of the Committee, after some discussion, was adopted by
tlie meeting.
On Sunday week last, up cards of 1,000 persons assembled on
the Curragh of Kildare, for the avowed purpose of expressing a
determination of opposing the present system of collecting tithes,
and to resist their further payment, until they could obtain some’
reasonable reduction from the incumbents of the neighbouring
parishes.— Carlow Morning Post.
A prisoner on his way to town on Friday morning, under a
charge of Ribbonism, died on the road. No cause could be
issigned nut the operation of terror. — Western Argus.
The Freeman’s Journal of Tuesday contains the following letter,
which presents an appalling picture of the distress in the county
of Mayo“ Ballina, Sunday morning—You may judge of the
state of the town of Ballina, and of the frightful amount of
wretchedness it exhibits in other quarters, when I can assure
you that at this moment (seven o’clock in the morning) I count
seventeen mendicants, and still not exceeding the usual retinue
' if poor that besiege our doors from morning until evening.
We hare not been wanting in calling attention to our distress.
•Ve have petitioned the Parliament; we have more than once
memorialised the government; and if* we have not appealed to pri-
vate benevolence beyond our town, it was because we preferred
that the poor should be relieved by being employed in making
our river navigable than that they should be reduced to the con-
ation of mendicants begging gratuitously. An outlay of three or
four thousand pounds would complete that important work, a
sum which would be soon refunded to the government in a
hundred fold by the increase of trade and prosperity of which it
’ would be productive. Until that work, however, is undertaken,
[know not, but from a reliance on Providence alone, how the
mmerous groups of wretched beings that are imploring labour
for any price may be rescued from starvation. You may judge
of then-condition from this one fact, that until the oats were put
town there was not a potato field in the neighbourhood of
Ballina, on which from twenty to thirty were not repeatedly seen
turning the soil in search of a few potatoes. There are, at least
from two to three thousand persons here at this moment in abso-
lute want of the necessaries of life.
In addition to the unqualified contradiction given by Lord
Goderich in our columns, to the statements in the Caledonian
Mercury, as far as his Lordship is personally concerned,
Lord Grantham and Colonel Gordon have written to the
! imes, the former distinctly denying any knowledge of the
transaction till he read of it in that paper, the other affirming
“ there never was any traffic for sale of seats in that borough,”
and that “ the very constitution of the borough renders it
impossible.” Mr. I'raser too, on his part, affirms the state-
uent to be “ in every particular incorrect,” and publishes a
letter from Mr. Weyland in support of his assertion.
It is curious to compare the language of the Duke of
Yellinglon and the other ex-Ministers on the Reform-Bill,
is to its being a measure approved by the King, with their
conduct on the Roman Catholic Relief Bill. On the present
occasion they reproach the Government with an unparlia-
mentary use of the King’s name. Surely they forget the use
they made of George the Fourth’s name. They made the
Catholic Relief Bill part of the King’s speech, and indeed
hey refused to allow Mr. Peel to bring the bill into the
House of Commons, until George the Fourth had pledged
himself to support it, and it is said they even insisted upon
that approbation being communicated iu a: i autograph letter.—
Brighton Gazette.
In the Courier of Tuesday appeared a paragraph, stating
ihat the indictment against Mr Cobbett not having been re-
moved by writ of certiorari into the Court of King's Bench,
would come on during the approaching Old Bailey Sessions.
Phis is incorrect. The indictment was removed by the
Crown prosecutor into the Court of King’s Bench.
As a paragraph has gone the round of the papers, calculated
o excite uneasiness respecting the situation of Mr. Charles
Kemble’s eldest son, we think it right to state that knowing,
■is we do, a part of it to be unfounded, we are led to hope '
he remainder may be equally so. The visit of Mr. Kemble
o France is purely professional; indeed, the absurdity of a
person going to Paris to intercede for the life of another, sen-
'enced to execution at Cadiz, is manifest. Mrs. Kemble, too,
we were glad to see in her private box, on Tuesday, listening
o Spohr’s beautiful music, at the very time when the para-
iiaph in question had been twenty-four hours in circulation.
Hie last accounts received from tire young Gentleman by his '
family were, we believe, dated Gibraltar.
A numerous and liighly-respectable meeting of the inhabi- ,
ant householders, rate-payers, and parochial authorities of the .
parish of St. Paul, Shadwell, was held at the vestry-room on
Tuesday night, for tiie purpose of taking into consideration 1
lie propriety of addressing his Majesty and the Legislature
on die subject of Parliamentary reform. Several gentlemen ;
advocated in able speeches the three reform bills introduced 1
by Lord John Russell. And petitions to the Houses of Lords
and Commons, praying that the Ministerial plan of reform 1
might pass unimpaired into a law, were unanimously agreed ,
10. An address to his Majesty, expressing confidence in his
Ministers, and thanking him for allowing so welcome a mea- ;
sure to be introduced, was also agreed to, not a single hand i
being held up against it. i

Yhe REVENGE.
(From a Morning Paper.)
However favourable has been the first impression produced by
the April accounts, more accurate examination not only tends to
strengthen and confirm it, but to prove that, under a rational
system of finance and a good government, the powers of produc-
tion and of consumption in this country are augmenting roost
rapidly, and that we may fully rely on the increase, as well as on
the stability, of all our great national resources.
The revenue, under the two great heads of receipt, of Excise
and Customs, presents the following result
Customs, increase on quarter £494,864
Excise, decrease on quarter 826,163
To rectify this account for the purposes of making a fair com-
parison with the corresponding quarter of 1830, it is necessary to
add to the Customs, the account of the coal duties remitted since
the Ist of March. These duties amount in London to 63,0001.,
and in the outports to 30,0001., which sums would have given an
increase to the quarter of 1831 over that of 1830, in no less a sum
than 287,8641.
The Excise receipts for April, 1830, amounted t 0.... £3,188,000
But of this must be deducted for taxes since repealed—
Beer .£687,516
Cider 11,414
Bides 85,067
Or paid on these three accounts into the Exchequer.. 772,0C0
Real Revenue of April, 1830, arising out of taxes now
existing 2,416,000
Excise payment to the Exchequer, April,
*B3l 2,362,000
Retained to answer claims of drawback on
printed cottons 300,000
_ . ■ 2,662,000
Rea! excess on Excise receipts in April, 1831, as compared
with the receipts of April, 1830, from the same taxes, 246,0001.
To this must be added a further sum of 114,1901. increased
revenue in Ireland.
The whole account would, for the purposes of comparison,
stand as follows :
Increase on Customs £287,864
Inciease on Excise 246 000
Increase on Irish Revenue 114’190
Total increase on the Quarter’s Customs and Excise .. £648,054
1 his constitutes a fair comparison between the revenue of the
two years, and one more satisfactory in all respects cannot he
stated.
Let the Government but persevere in a steady course of eco-
nomy and of financial improvement, and let them be supported
by the intelligence and virtue of a reformed House of Commons,
and it may be doubted whether the great advances already made
in our national wealth, industry, and trade, may not in future
years be far exceeded by a new development of prosperity.
But to achieve these objects there must not be such miserable
trickery practised as was witnessed in the debate on the timber
duties. We must not any longer see men opposing their own
measures, not to defeat a Budget, but to check the progress of
Reform. Those gentlemen who have condemned the people of
England to pay high prices for a bad article—those partisans of
the dry rot, both in our houses and in our Constitution—must be
for ever excluded from power, before a full measure of relief can
be afforded to our people, and a due security to the liberties of
England.
W ith regard to the Malt Duty, it is to he observed, that nearly
double the quantity ofbarley has been converted intomaltfrom the
sth Jan. last to this time, to that so converted during the same pe-
riod in the pi deeding year ; but, although so much
made, the revenue for the quarter just ended has not bean aided by
it; for the maltsters do not pay their duties immediately, butgive
bond for them, so that the duties on malt made in the quarter
just expired will not be paid until the ensuing quarter, whilst
the tax on ale and beer used to be paid in the country at the col-
lections made every six weeks. Another important fact is, that
the barley was not sufficiently dry for malting very eaily in the
preceding quarter, so that the duties that became due in the last
quarter in respect of malt made iu the preceding quarter, were
not equal to what they would otherwise have been ; but I have
not the least doubt, that by the end of the year the malt duties
will be found to have produced within 1,030,0001. of the duties
on malt, and beer, and ale iu former years. —Correspondent of a
Morning Paper.

Extract from a letter of Captain Dickenson, of his Majesty’s
ship Lightning, dated Rio, January 22 :
“ It has fallen to my lot to be appointed to one of the most in-
teresting and important services that ever a single ship was em-
ployed in. My temporary diving bell was yesterday tried from
the Warspite, to the depth of six fathoms, with four people in it,
and succeeded to admiration. I have also VieTised several other
instruments for the recovery of the treasure, and success seems
at present very far from improbable.”
Memorandum.—The Lightning sailed from Rio Janeiro tha
24th of January, to endeavour to recover the treasure on board the
Thetis frigate.
Mr. Futcher, a respectable maltster, of Urchfont, a few
days since received a kick in his stomach from a horse which
he was about to purchase, which occasioned his death in a
few minutes. He has left a wife and six children. —Bath

Swatkins and Lloyd, the two men convicted of arson, at
the late Staffordshire Assizes, and sentenced lo death, have
received a respite of their sentence until the 10th of April, in

we understand, the ultimate fate of these unfortunate men.—

Jemima Fitzpatrick was finally examined lastnightat Worship-
street, on suspicion of having been concerned in the murder of
John Davy, who, it will be recollected, was found dead in his
bed on Saturday morning last, in New-street, Old-street, St.
Luke’s. There appeared nothing to connect the prisoner with
the murder, except that she had been in the habit of attending
the deceased, and she was accordingly discharged.
About 10 o’clock last night a fire broke out in the back part of
Mr. Matthews’ house, painter, See., 30, Gower-place, near the
new London University. The tire w-as confined to the back
premises alone.
During the course of Sunday night, a man of the name of
Kelly, or M'Kellop, residing in Thread-street, Paisley, who is
a stone-breaker, was heard quarrelling with his wife. On Mon-
lay morning the wife was found sitting on a chair dead, and tha
husband lying in bed. He was taken to the police office a little
before nine o’clock, upon suspicionof murder.— Glasgow Courier.
On Monday night last, between nine and ten o’clock, a fire, we
regret to state, took place on the premises of Mr, Huxley, of
filstock, near Whitchurch : the out-buildings were observed to
be on fire in three places, and the whole of them were consumed.
The dwelling-house took fire, hut, providentially, its spread was
prevented. We are sorry lo add, that six or more cows perished
in the flames. There cannot be a doubt but it was the work of
incendiaries. —Salopian Journal .|
