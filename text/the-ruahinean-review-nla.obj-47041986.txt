■ The production of a magazine on
board one of H.M.N.Z. Transports
has by this time become something
not to be undertaken lightly or in-
advisedly, Successive reinforcements
in the course of their voyage “over
there” 1 have- produced journals of
such a high standard that the idea of
producing another one makes an ama-
teur staff at first thouglit feel very
amateur indeed. Everyone knows what
corhparisons are—and nearly everyone
goes on making them. Therefore we
beg to state quite clearly at the "very
beginning that for the judgments of
those who wish to compare the
with other similar productions, we do
not care a rap—not because we think
that the will come success-
fully through the process, but because
we are absolutely uninterested in the
'question. The ——— has not been

doings of Transport 110. Our object
has been to provide some record of
the life of those who for a few weeks
have been welded, as only life on
shipboard can,* into a single commun-
ity. We came on board from every
permanent camp in New Zealand ; our
numbers include representatives of
every branch of the N.Z. service, ex-
cept" the Mounted Rifles and the
A.S.G, - (This is not to be taken as
a sluf* on the good name of these
units ; it is their misfortune, not their
fault, that they are not represented
in what is of course “ the finest body
of men (and Sisters) that has sailed
from New Zealand !’’) When we reach
our destination-—which, by kind per-
mission of Hun subs, on the urgent
request of our Silent Navy we hope
to do in a few weeks— : we shall once
again be scattered to various camps.
But for these few weeks, our. is
that of a single, community, and we
send the upon Its way. in. the
hope that it will be of interest to
those who care to know the manner
’of that life, and as something for
them to keep to show to those of us
who come back, the record of a part
of our experiences in connection with
the war, which we shall not want to
forget. ' '
We regret to have to record 1 that
one of our ship's company has passed
over the Great Divide during the
voyage. Gunner P. F. White, June
of the naval gun-crew on board, died
on September sth, and was buried at
sea the same day with full military
honours. Gunner White had had a
share in two : of the biggest naval en-
gagements of the. war, having been
present at the battle off the Falkland
Islands and the Jutland Battle. We
understand that he leaves behind hiin
a wife and family, resident near .Liver-
pool, England, and to, them,-we extend
our sincere^t sypiha'thy 1 in their , fce-

Ourselves.
“ Semper Constantsumus.”
“ Behold, I bring yon glad tidings
of great joy;” Such are the senti-
ments with which we announce to
the world the inauguration of a
Magazine which alike as a literary
effort and as a commercial enter
prise is, we have no doubt, assured
of success.
Our enemies we know with irrepres-
sible jealousy will say the wish is
father to the thought, but we can
afford to treat them with the silent
contempt which they deserve. We
fear to give them further attention —
even if it were only to paint them
with well-merited abuse —lest w©
might seem to elevate them to a
position of importance for which they
have not the slightest warrant. We,
therefore, consign them to the depths
of Oblivion.
Now, no newspaper, magazine or
what not can hope for success unless
it announces to the public with per-
fect frankness its policy, the
principles, that is, by which it will
be guided in its effort to contribute
something which will effect or help
to effect a permanent improvement in
the existing social order and unless it
remains true to that policy or else with
equal candour confesses its conversion
to some other.
With this idea in view we announce
that inasmuch as we are in the midst
of military affairs our policy shall
savour of khaki —metaphorically speak
ing, of course, domestic affairs will
be no concern of ours. We leave those
things for the politicians, whose
suavity and adaptability to the wishes
of their constituents more befits them
for “talking to the ladies,” drinking
afternoon-tea —Chaplains are good at
this too, stroking the baby’s head and
enquiring after a string 'of relatives
some of whom have been dead and
buried this last twenty years.
Our concern will be the Army and
ail that pertains thereto. We shall
be champions of the indispensability
of military discipline and rigid up-
holders as we are firm believers of
the wisdom of military rules and
regulations.
We shall support the Colonel and
his retinue with a consistency for
which we hope to be duly rewarded
if 'not in this world then assuredly
in the next. If the “heads” say
black is white, so shall we ; if they
say the sea is calm enough for drill
—even though the vessel be standing
on her very beam ends —so shall
we; if they affirm that safety
dictates the necessity of ' “ lights
out” at 9.30 p.m. so shall we, and
we shall support them (the heads
we mean) When they maintaih that
this necessity applies only to the third
saloon. If. perchance they iiiake a
mistake—what great man hasn’t—we
shall rack our brains in quest of a
satisfactory excuse and we shall never
fail to exaggerate the misdemeanours
Of the “lesser lights.’"
In short everything which the
“fountains of wisdom ” say or leave
unsaid will have our hearty approval
and co-operation.
Again we believe that every rule,
regulation or order which cannot
otherwise be supported is justifiable
on the grounds of that same military
discipline to which we have adverted
earlier in this article.
It is military discipline which de-
mands that the men should have for
breakfast a leathery substance that
masquerades under the non de flume
of steak ; that the “ scrubbers ” should
be able to see with the naked eye as
much as the Skipper detects with that
inseparable electric torch; that the
spoons should be not merely perfectly
clean, but polished so that on
emergency they can be used as shav-
ing mirrors; that the men should
rise at reveille, dress, fold hammocks
and blankets (with the edges
regular as a sliced cucumber) put
them neatly away in the allotted
place in the bins, and be on deck for
roll call at 6.30 a.m—all in the dark,
and finally that the men in the clink
should enjoy the same privileges as
their fellows.
In short, discipline is the beginning
and end of all thigs military; we
even hear it affirmed that it will be
the end of the soldiers! But after
all this is only in keeping with the
argument because soldiers are indeed
“ things ” military.
In giving our whole-hearted support
therefore to these military rules, regu-
lations and orders we feel sure we are
on a ‘ ‘ good wicket M-readers please
pardon our lapse into colloquialism—
that is if our information as to the size
of the Goloners bank account be not
seriously amiss.
In conclusion, though we could con-
tinue the' argument to much greater
length, we feel sure we have said
enough to convince the unbiassed
mind that our magazine will go down
to posterity as one of the literary
marvels of this age.
We regret to report that Captain
Drinkitall died under mysterious cir-
cumstances. Incidentally it may be
remarked that he was responsible for
the closing of the pubs, at our first
port of call:

rifles and no side-arms) : Platoon,

What’s it to be ?
What’s "Tt to bel|; That is the
question. Will the Outcome of this
titanic struggle, this trial of strength
between right and might, between
man and brute force, which has been
drenching the world in precious blood
for the past four years, be, as one
of our great statesmen has said, “ that
the world has been made safe for de-
mocracy or will it be naught but
an armed truce, a breathing space,
“the end of the first round,” a mere
experience by which nations will be
guided in another loathsome prepar-
ation for mis cruel, sinful and withal
useless thing called war? Will the
future see everything that is highest
and best in a nation .sacrificed to an-
other insane race for armaments?
Finally, will “ the clash of competing
ambitions,” the pre-war “ groupings
and alliances and a precarious equi-
poise,” hang, so to speaky like a
sword over the heads of mankind,
subduing the pure and contented en-
joyment of all that is best in life,
and hindering the . consideration of
urgent domestic problems and re-
forms? If so, then science, art, skill
and thought will be prevented to the
pursuit of means for outwitting the
“ other fellow ” in the destruction of
human life and property. In short,
will extreme militarism again hold
sway ? That, we repeat, is the ques-
tion, and we confess we find it diffi-
cult—though not impossible—to
answer.
To dispel any misgivings which may
have arisen in the minds of our read-
ers as to our opinion as to the result
of the present great war, we hasten
to assert our entire confidence in the
triumph of the Allied arms. There
were times, we admit, when victory
seemed to us impossible, but the
clouds have rolled by, and with them
all our doubts and fears.
No treatment of this subject could
be considered satisfactory which did
not contain a reference to the part-
altogether beyond praise—which has
been played by our great leaders.
Their names are household words the
world over. The real extent of their
influence will, probably never be
known. Buoyed up alike by. their
precept and their example, we have
now reached—or have, we been car-
ried —to the very threshold of victory.
This being so, we are now in a
position to consider whether our ene-
mies’ collapse will render the world
‘ safe for democracy,” and democ-
racy immune from the paralysing
effects of war. In a word, is this the
last great war ? Now, instead of the
hitherto undisputed right of recourse
to war, the establishment is. suggested
of an international tribunal, to which
all international problems may. be sub-
mitted for solution. : Antecedent td
the establishment Of this tribunal is


the inducement of nations to abandon
war or preparation for war as a means
of settling their disputes or preserving
that dangerous, fickle principle, the
Balance of. Power. They will have
to realise two things : first, that noth-
ing which can be settled by war is
incapable of settlement by peaceful
negotiation;; and secondly, the utter
futility of war as a means of securing
their ends. We are not contending,
be it noted, that war is in every case
futile : on the contrary, we maintain
—and here we part company with the
conscientious objector, with whom we
say candidly w r e have little patience—
we maintain that war is the one and
only means of repelling war. It is
no use reasoning sagely with an en-
raged savage or opposing with the
fists an adversary who has resorted
to sticks or stones. Herein lies, we
think, the only justification for the
adoption by the Allies of some of the
less worthy methods of their enemies
(e.</.,’the use of poison gas).
Again we have neither the desire
nor the intention to assent that war
or instruments of war can be abol-
ished. They cannot be. Even if they
could, our last state would be worse
than our first. It would be like abo-
lishing our State P olice Force. We
have already hinted at, and we now
assert that war, i.e. force, and instru-
ments of war must be retained as an
ultimate sanction of justice, but a
sanction whose aid only to public or
international tribunals will have the
right to invoke. A single nation may
have the desire, even the audacity to
resort to war, but it will have no
more right to do so than an individual
or any but the recognised authority
has the right of invoking the aid of
the State Police.
But this is not our point. We carry
the matter a stage further back and
maintain that every nation will have
a strong incentive to leave war severely
alone. If Germany has been unable,
after upwards of forty years of
thorough preparation and over four
years of actual war to reach anything
but impending defeat, is it likely that
she or any other nation will have even
the desire again to resort to war or
even prepare for it? Once burnt,
twice shy. Theirs’ would be the
punishment of natural consequences.
Should they elect so to suffer, then
this war has been fought in vain.
But as with individuals, we con-
tend, so with nations. For these rea-
sons we believe that this will indeed
be the last great war, and that with
the few exceptions experienced in the
enforcement of law between individu-
als, future disputes will be settled
peaceably by the arbitrations of an
international tribunal supported by one
international police force capable of
enforcing its decisions even if neces-
sary by war. We shall begin a new
era in which
The Pen shall supersede the Sw r ord,
And right, not might, shall be the
Lord,”
A League of Nations—ls it
Practicable ?
: A' perusal of the■:■. article, - entitled
“•What’s it to be?” to which, by
the kindness of the Editor I have had
access, prompts me to pen a few lines
on the proposals underlying the form-
ation of the League to enforce
Peace, which owes its birth to the
lessons of the present war, It is
not from motives of self-depreciation
in the hope of securing compassionate
praise, but solely lest I might be
“not understood,” that 1 hasten to
say I am not arrogating to myself
the role of an authority on this most
difficult subject. My limited supply
of knowledge, I fear, does not war-
rant me competent even to express an
opinion, but a lively interest in what
to me is an entrancing question, added
to a firm conviction that it is one
of the most difficult and most im-
portant problems wherewith mankind
has been confronted overcomes the
diffidence and indeed trepidation with
which I advance my argument and
lures me into print. At the risk of
wearying the reader therefore, with
discussion, the transparency of which
may betray a “plentiful lack of wit,”
I proceed to consider a few argu-
ments bearing on the practicability of
the scheme, and I am glad the writer
of the, other article to which I have
referred in my opening remarks, has
not omitted the point. At the out-
set I feel .sure I tread safe ground
when I say that any proposal which
has for its object the substitution of
arbitration for war, of peaceful nego-
tiation for brute force, should have
the goodwill and the co-operation of
every one who claims to be a. civilised
human being. I have neither sf)ace
nor time to refute the contention that
war is a noble and a desirable pas-
time tending to promote strength of
character, manliness, vigour, chivalry,
and all the other good qualities that
help to make a “man.” The argu-
ment is unworthy of further consid-
eration here. It is consequently
with a mixture of contempt and pjty
that I meet the man who will not
stop to consider the proposal we have
under review. The man who dis-
misses the subject with the bold, curt
remark, ‘ • impracticable, war has ex-
isted from time immemorial and will
never be abolished.” Now the time
is opportune to correct a misappre-
hension which I think exists in the,
minds of many who have not given
the question much consideration, and
I am glad the writer of the other
article to which I have referred in
my opening remarks, has not omitted
the point. I refer to the idea that
the League of Nations Society pro-
poses total disarmament. Unless my
view of the aims of the Society be
seriously amiss this has never been
proposed; certainly it is not now
entertained. The League does not
propose total disarmament. Such a
condition of affairs is diametrically
opposed to the ideas'which called the
Society into existence. Total dis-
armament/ to quote the other article,
is as undesirable as the removal as
the State Police Force. Just as there
exists a Force for the preservation
of law and order, between individuals
—a national Police Force—so also
must there be a Force to preserve law
and order between nations, an In-
ternational Police Forced
But in a dispute between indi-
viduals or classes of individuals,
neither side may call upon or expect
the aid of the National Force. The.
dispute must be referred to an ap-
pointed tribunal, and none but the
recognised authority may utilise the
Police Force for the enforcement of
the decisions of that tribunal. In a
similar manner nations will be com-
pelled to submit' their disputes to a
properly-constituted International Law
Court, on which all civilised nations
will have a fixed representation, and
that tribunal will be supported by an
International Police Force—that is to
say, an army and a navy—able and
willing to enforce its decisions.
The idea then is that as no one
in the State is entitled to take the
law into his own hands or to resort
to self help for the redress of his
grievances, neither shall any nation
be entitled to do so, and any one
who transgresses the rule must try
conclusions with the Police Force.
The use of force by the individual
is therefore not permitted, but the
State keeps at its disposal such amount
of force—a residue one might say—
as experience shows to be sufficient
to ensure that the settlement of dis-
putes by the Law Courts will be
binding on the parties concerned.
Likewise a residuum of force—an
army and a navy—will be at the dis-
posal of the international tribunal,
but not at the disposal of any nation.
Finally, in the community conflicts
with the Police—l do not mean Sat-
urday night brawls, but a serious op-
position to the authority of the Police
—are comparatively rare; so rare,
indeed, that the mere existence of the
Police has become a guarantee of
peace, the mere threat of force has
become a sufficient substitute for its
actual exercise.
By a similar line of reasoning it is
hoped and earnestly maintained by
those whose opinions challenge serious
attention, that conflicts with the In-
ternational Police, in other words,
any active opposition to International
Law will be comparatively rare, and
that the mere existence of the Force
will be sufficient to maintain order.
I am aware that many will find
it hard to believe that the proposal
will be practicable. A trace of in-
nate conservatism I think arouses mis-
givings in their minds. They can-
not escape the haunting idea that as
war as a private weapon is as old as
man himself, nations will not be
willing to surrender their right to


use it when and as they think fit. But
this is not sound argument, nor is it
borne out by the facts of history. Sim-
ply because a certain condition of
affairs has existed for a long period
is no reason why it should continue to
the end of time. I wonder what
progress civilisation would have made
had this same negative line of rea-
soning been accepted- against all the
great reforms that have done so much
to improve the lot of mankind. The
abolition of the divine rigm of kings,
of serfdom, of the slave trade, of
the Corn Laws, amidst other reforms
too numerous to mention. Might not
this same argument have greeted the
introduction of the proposal to sub-
stitute arbitration, that is the Law
Courts and the State Police, for self-
help or force, that is war in the set-
tlement of disputes between mem-
bers of the State? At that time
self help, sometimes extending even
to war was the time immemorial
method of Settling individual dis-
putes ; therefore, because it had ex-
isted for so long it was indispensable.
The Law Courts and the Police Force,
by whom the decisions of the Courts
were to be enforced, and by whom
order was to be maintained, would
never be practicable. Duels and wars
will never be abolished. People will
never surrender the weapon of self
help. One can imagine such argu-
ment being used against the estab-
lishment of the State Law Courts and
the State Police Force. But these
institutions were and still are and
ever will be practicable, and no one
who makes any claim to sanity would
propose to revert to the old order
of things when might was the only
standard of right, and man was
thrown on his own resources with
perhaps those of his kinsmen or
friends for the redress of his grie-
vances.
There was a time when it was
necessary to protect one’s castle with
moats and drawbridges. No one thinks
of doing so to-day. With the trans-
ference of the right of resort to force
from the individual to the public, in
other words with the advent of the
courts and the police, disappeared
the necessity for armed protection; a
sense of security supplanted a sense
of suspicion or fear. Why should not
the same healthy change take place in
International relationships ?
Again we hear it affirmed that wars
will never cease, because human nature
is unchangeable. Unchangeable ! Any
one who asserts this should read a
chapter in Mr. Norman Angell’s book
“ The Great Illusion,” dealing with
this very question. Apart from the
instances already quoted there are
countless others.
When Gallileo profounded his theory
that the earth moves round the sun
he was compelled under threat of
torture to renounce his doctrine on his
knees. Has human nature changed
its view of his theory? , There was a
time when human nature tolerated
the slave trade. Is . it tolerated to-
day?
Time *was when the poor man’s son
was debarred education. Is such a
condition of affairs tolerated to-day ?
One might multiply the instances
ad'■ infinitum and yet human nature
doesn’t change?
Human nature changes as surely as
childhood changes to youth and youth
to manhood. But the change is so
constant that the matter has become
a commonplace and we cease to
notice it. But perhaps the most
difficult argument to answer is the one
which asserts that nations are not
restrainable like a single individual.
Groups of individuals, it is argued,
act more on the impulse ; whereas the
individual stops to consider. The
impulse which exerts but a slight
influence on the one separate human
being is multiplied a thousand
fold or more in the case of the group,
‘‘ the undecided fickle mob,’ 5 as Horace
calls them, who wait for a lead and
then follow like sheep, : no matter how
hasty may have been the leader’s de-
cision. I confess this is a difficult argu-
ment to refute. Nations have often
acted on the impulse, like, for ex-
ample, the crowd at the threatre when
an alarm of fire is raised. Did every
one act according to reason so that
the exit would be orderly, then in
the-majority of instances there would
be no injury. What actually happens
is well known : the hasty man of ac-
tion, acting on a misguided impulse,
makes a rush for the door, the crowd
“ follow the leader,” exits are blocked,
people are trampled under foot, and
all the while the fire is spreading.
But this is due to want of practice,
and it is precisely f or This reason-that
troops are given boat drill aboard
transport. This disciplinary training
has been productive of much good; in
nearly all the shipping disasters of
recent years we are told that the
conduct of all on board was exem-
plary—there was no panic, and con-
sequently the loss of life has been
reduced as low as the exigencies of
the situation would permit. Such loss
of life as has occurred has not been
due to disorderly conduct on the part
of the passengers. This tendency to
panic, then, is largely due to want of
training, of practice—in other words,
of education. And why should it not
be so with nations? The resort to
war when right, reason and self-in-
terest dictate negotiation and arbitra-
tion, is capable of correction by the
simple process of education. And what
better education than the bitter ex-
periences of this present war ? Hus-
bands, sons, fathers, brothers, torn
away from their loved ones, some
never to return; homes wrecked, food
allowances reduced below the level of
decent existence and even of bare
necessity, prices of many commodities
almost prohibitive, taxes beyond the
comprehension of peace time formulas
■ —in short, sorrow, suffering, want ?
privation,: hopelessness.' Most of these
conditions obtain in all the belligerent
countries to-day. Such at any rate
has been the internal condition of our
enemies for practically the duration
of the war.
Is it conceivable that this education
will not bear good fruit?
To those who make reference to
previous wars, the answer is that there
has never been a war on such a gigan-
tic scale. Nations never before real-
ised what war really could be. The
Franco Prussian war, for example,
was little more than the equivalent of
a mere episode in the present Arma-
geddon.
Again some one will remind me of
the Hague Convention, to which I
reply that the arbitration proposals
were merely optional; there was no
obligation either to submit a dispute
to arbitration or to abide by the de-
cision if arbitration were elected upon.
But in any case at that time a
League of Nations as at present pro-
posed would have been doomed to
failure. Some, if not all, the greater
nations were not ripe for such a
drastic change. The mental attitude
of Germany in particular-—-with whom
responsibility for the present war rests
-—was such as to render the s< heme
hopeless. Militarism was being preached
in Parliament, press, pulpit and in
the schools. She has now tested the
bitter cup of experience ; militarism
under circumstances far more favour-
able than either she or any other na-
tion could ever again expect. As I
have stated elsewhere, nations have
been educated. I have often heard it
asked whether Germany is to be ad-
mitted to the League. The answer is
that Germany must' and shall be in-
cluded therein. For her it will be not
a privilege but a duty. If she is not
disposed to join in of her own free
will—but I think she will be —she
must be compelled to do so. No
League of Nations can hope to avoid
such an amount of friction as may
render it abortive unless Germany be
compelled to participate.
Finally a word or two about the
merits of arbitration in the past. It
is said that arbitration has proved a
failure; this is not so. The History
of International Law records a num-
ber of instances in which arbitration
between nations has been attended
with very satisfactory results. Per-,
haps the best example, is that of the
notorious “ Alabama ” case. The
“ Alabama ” was a pirate ship fitted
out privately from Britain, and she
wrought great havoc amongst the com-
merce of the Northern States during
the American Civil War. It was
claimed that Britain was liable -.'ac-
cording to International Law for the
damage done by the vessel, and after
some negotiation the dispute was re-
ferred to an arbitration tribunal which
sat at Geneva. This tribunal con-
demned Britain to pay the sum of


fifteen, million dollars, (over three , mil-
lion pounds), and Britain paid up like
a gentleman. If, there fore, in the
past ..arbitration has,, not,..achieved all
that was hoped, ,it Fas at;least, been
far front a failure.
One could continue the argument
almost indefinitely, but I fear I have
already said enough to weary the
reader if not to interest him, and so
I hurriedly conclude.
I readily admit that the practical
application of the aims of the Society
bristles with difficulties. Such matters
as the amount of representation which
each nation shall have on the Inter-
national tribunal, the quota which
each shall contribute for the estab-
lishment and maintenance of the
International Police Force and the
disposal of such force will call for
delicate ’and skilful adjustment.
Friction will inevitably arise and un-
less it be overcome the scheme will
be abortive.
But no insurmountable difficulties
should be incurred. The realisation
that a. change from the old order of
things is highly desirable, and of
the comparative cheapness of arbitra-
tion, coupled with the bitter lessons
of the present war, should exert a
persuasive influence, sufficient to
overcome any reluctance, to submit to
the will of the majority, and nations
will be well advised to approach the
question m a spirit of good will and
compromise.
The fact that the scheme has the
support of many of the leading states*
men of the world arrests attention and
encourages the belief that it will meet
with the success it deserves.

We flying boys, we have our joys
on no.,
We sock in beans to Battery queens,
-.and call it sport.
We pull their beds about their heads,
in night attire.
We switch on lights and start some
fights, we flying boys.
Why does. Rusty Laidlaw look so wild,.
You see, he’d found his little bunk
was pifed..
Then in conies old Button, his face
looks blue.
Those flying boys have v/recked my
cabin, and wrecked yours too.
Says Rusty, we’ll wreck them' in re-
turn.
But we s re prepared for' Rusty and his
friend.
And you may rather bet, they will
return quite wet,
From the raid on the £C Flying Boys. 55

He and his wife remind us of a story
we heard shortly after the War be-

of it, married men had to have their

reply came : “ For God’s sake take

THE C OMMANDING OFFICER.


The Ruahinean Review.
Just a few remarks on the forma-
tion of the magazine, the choice of
cover and name, and some words of
thanks to those who have assisted
the Committee in the compiling of a
production of which at least we are
not ashamed.
After a lapse of oyer a fortnight
the persistent expression of a desire
for a Ship’s Magazine, and an un-
successful search for one with jour-
nalistic experience, ripened into a
request that the present Editor should
undertake that somewhat difficult
task. Moved by a desire that the
events of the trip should not go un-
recorded, I finally consented to under-
take the position, though I confess
with much reluctance, not on account
of indolence, but solely because I
know my *own limitations, and deit
that I was not competent to edit a
magazine worthy of the name. How-
ever, thanks to the quantity and the
quality of the contributions, and the
valuable assistance of the Magazine
Committee, in particular the manager
(Lieut. Moore) and the sub-editor,
Cadet E. Flower, my task has not
been nearly so arduous as I antici-
a view to enticing talent from
its covert, the Committee offered a
prize for the best cover design, and
the result was most satisfactory, no
fewer than seven designs being sub-
mitted, not one of which would have
disgraced the cover of any Ships
Magazine. The selectors had con-
sequently the difficult task of choos-
ing the best of a very good lot. ihe
selection was made by the Magazine
Committee, with Col. Colquhoun as
Chairman, and the choice lay finally
between the design of Flight Lieut
Harkness, entitled “ Souvenir of
Transport 110,” and the. one which
appears on the cover. In selecting
the latter the Committee has chosen
what is considered to be the most
suitable for a cover design.
Two other designs, the one by Mr.
Harkness, and another, that of Cadet
Ni col son of the Royal Air Force,
entitled “ The Shield ,” have in the
oninion of the Committee such con-
spicuous merit as to warrant repro-
duction in the Magazine itself, and
this, fact I may say weighed more
with the Committee than anything
else in the final selection, as it was
felt that the design chosen was
strictly a cover design, and not suit-
able for reproduction in the« Maga-
zine. Although, therefore, the prize
has been awarded to Pte. Checkley,
of the N.Z.M.C., Mr. Harkness and
Cadet Nicolson can take credit unto
themselves for having their efforts
reproduced in the book itself.
By way of explanation it may be
mentioned that Mr. Harkness’ pro-
duction is so designed as to repre-
sent the figures 110, the number of
our Transport, and Cadet Nicolsou’s
contains the badges of the O.C.
Troops—Col. Colquhoun (14th South
Otago), and of the Ship’s Adjutant
Lt. M. Milliken (3rd Akld.), and the
badges at present worn by each unit
on the ship, with the exception of
the N.Z. Dental Corps badge, which,
we regret, through a pure oversight
on the part of the artist, was omitted.
Our apologies go to Capt. Foster of
the N.Z.D.C. for the omission.
The committee offered a further
small prize for the best collection of
photographs, suitable for reproduc-
tion in the magazine, and this prize
was also won by Pte. Checkley. The
collection which appears in the maga-
zine is not, however, identical with
that of the prize winner. The com-
mittee has selected the best out of
all the collections that were sub-
mitted.
It may, perhaps, be hardly fair to
single out any individual, but I wish,
especially, to thank Flight-Lieut.
Harkness for his number of fine
sketches which serve as a bright
relief to what would otherwise, I fear,
be a monotony of reading matter.
In conclusion, if the reader derives
half as much pleasure from the
Magazine as I have had in compiling
it, then I shall feel truly rewarded.
ED.
Troopship 110.
The Troopship of the day is one hun-
dred and ten.
And the same will be said by hun-
dreds of men.
She is up to date and well worth
seeing
And behaves herself like a human
being.
Now and again she has a bad turn,
And then of course her manner is
stern.
But a pluckier boat there couldn’t be,
For she ventures out in any sea.
She goes night and day without
making a row,
And each wave she passes receives
quite a bow.
At one port of call, when the time
came to leave,
She throbbed all over and gave a
little heave.
When a gale arises she only laughs,
And amuses herself with a game of
draughts.
The waves come overboard and
threaten to drown,
But the ship passes through them
without a frown.
When entering a port against the tide,
She battles along with masterly pride.
Much more could be told of the won-
derful transport,
But the paper is scarce, and the pen-
cil ran short.
Still facts remain : We’ll'say. no more,
For she carries New Zealand’s Sons
of War.

With the N.Z. Division.
By Lieut.-Col. Colquhoun, D.S.O.
One of the most interesting opera-
tions carried out by the N.Z. Divi-
sion was in March of the present year
at the commencement of the great
Hun offensive. The Division had
been holding the line of Ypres salient
for some months and towards the end
of February went out for a month’s
training. On the 25th March when
our line in the vicinity of Amiens was
forced to give way the Division was
hurriedly sent out to fill the gap. The
following is the experience of one of
the Otago Battalions, which is
typical of what other units went
through. The battalion left a small
village at 1 a.m. on Monday, 25th
March, 1918, marched four miles to
the entraining station, left there at
4 a.m. and detrained at a station
west of Amiens at 4 p.m. that after-
noon. After a meal arid all packs
were stacked the battalion went for-
ward in fighting kit. A march of
five miles was made that night and
then all ranks camped on the side of
the road. Next morning the
battalion was on the move again and
marched miles through Amiens
to a point where motor lorries were
ready to convey the battalion to a
village a further 9 miles. This
village was reached at 8 p.m. on
Tuesday night. At 1 a.m. on Wed-
nesday morning the battalion formed
an advanced guard and marched
through Ma illy-Mallet to Colincamp.
When the latter village was reached
an outpost line was formed round the
village.
At daybreak on Wednesday morn-
ing a Wellington battalion, in con-
junction with a Rifle Brigade batta-
lion, advanced through the outpost
line and pushed back the Hun and
established a front line with com-
munication to the units on the flanks.
On Wednesday night the Otago
battalion was established in strong
points as the battalion in Divisional
reserve. By Thursday morning the
Divisional had established a front
line and a reserve line and the Hun
was unable to penetrate our defences.
The men were in splendid form and
enjoyed the change to open warfare.

LT.-COL. COLQUHOUN, D.S.O.
Who’s Who Aboard.
Quite one of the most interesting
pieces of reading in the “ Ruahinean
Review ” will, we feel sure, be
afforded by the following account of
the decorations that have been
gained by those whom it is our good
fortune to include in our numbers.
The usual reluctance with which men
yield to a request for an account of
something about themselves renders
our task of compiling these pages by
no means an easy one; but we have,
we think, obtained sufficient to make
an interesting narrative, more interest-
ing too because it is true, although
to one who has been far removed
from the glamour of war parts of
the story read like the sort of fiction
of which we were so fond in our
schoolboy days. The decorated men,
three in number, are • now all officers,
but Mr. Moore was 'not commissioned
at the time he gained his distinction.
D.S.O.
To get these few words from these
soldiers of ours has .been real hard
work as they are no different from
any other decorated man —and as we
all know, men who have been
lionoured by their country don’t like
talking of their deeds. However,
after much persuasion, we managed to
get a rather bald statement from the
officers concerned.
When Lt.-Col. Colquhoun, D. 5.0.,
was interviewed, he tried to shift
all the merit to his Battalion. Now,
that is very nice indeed, but it does
not explain the one important fact,
and that is who was responsible for
the training of this fine Battalion,
and as we all must realise no unit
can be at all efficient unless its Com-
manding Officer is efficient and able.
Col. Colquhoun’s D.S.O. was won on
October 4th, 1917, at Paschandaele,
where our crowd fought one of its
hardest fights. The Assaulting
Brigades were the Ist and 4th, the
4th being on the right. The
Assaulting Battalions of the 4th
Brigade were 3rd Auckland and 3rd
Otago. The Otago Battalion was
commanded by Lt.-Col. Colquhoun.
Its objective was just in front ..of
Gravenstafel and Abraham Heights.
In the line of advance lay Otto Farm
and Van Muelen. These two points
were taken in our stride, so to speak,
and all appeared to be going well
until the battalion objective was
reached when trouble came from
Gravenstafel, which lay beyond our
objective. So Col. Colquhoun sent
his battalion forward again and
captured Gravenstafel and Abraham
Heights, taking 150 prisoners from
Gravenstafel alone. During the day
this fine battalion took 300 prisoners
and many machine guns and by
nightfall had a trench 5 feet deep dug
along their entire front. We all
remember how the papers sang the
praise of our “ Peerless Division 55
when this deed became known. And
now we know that a great share of
that praise was earned by Lt.-Col.
Colquhoun, D. 5.0., and the 3rd
Battalion of the Otago Infantry
Regiment.
D.S.C.
Our next case concerns an entirely
different branch of our Imperial
Forces. I am speaking of the case
of Flight-Lieut. Harkness, D.S.C.,
R.N.A.S. He is not serving with a
New Zealand unit, though he is a
New Zealander. His story is as fol-
lows : During August, 1916, I was
stationed at Dunkirk,. On August 9th
there was a big Zepp. raid over Lon-
don. I and another officer, both
Flight Sub-Lieuts. at the time, went
up and tried to intercept the Zepps.
on their return to their sheds. We
left our aerodrome 2 hours before day-
light and flew out to sea, but saw no
Zepps. Then climbing we turned and
came inland over Zeebrugge, Ghent,
and on to Brussels. When we reached
Brussels we were at a height of 15,000
feet. Collett, my partner, shut off
his engine and dived down on sheds;
he reached to within 300 feet or so,
and let his bombs go. This was just
at daybreak, and he was dropping
bombs before he was spotted. The
Hun opened heavy Archie fire on him,
and as soon as he saw the shed on
fire he scooted off home. I at this
time, would be about 7,500 feet up
waiting to see the extent of the
damage caused by Collett. There were
three large sheds at Brussels, one on
each of three sides of the town. The
Bosche spotted me and opened up
pretty solidly. So I dived on a large
shed which had its doors closed, and
which I presumed held a Zepp. I
dropped 8 bombs on this shed (we
were carrying 12 each) and circled to
see results; it burst into flames and
was entirely destroyed when I saw it
was well alight. l" scooted off to the
third shed and dropped my remaining
4 bombs. I got hits, but could not
see what damage I had done. I then
scooted off home, which I reached
safely after having been from to 4
hours in the air. About a month later,
much to my surprise, I saw in orders
that I was to be decorated. Our spies
had reported the total destruction of
all three sheds. (This is a great per-
formance, as night flying was at this
time almost unknown. And the dar-
ing of this young New Zealander and
his English companion deserves the
highest possible praise. Hats off,
boys. Editor.)
FLIGHT-LIEUT. HARKNESS, D.S.C.


About a month later this officer was
leading a large bombing raid into
enemy territory, when he had engine
trouble and was forced to land in
Holland, where he was interned. Al-
ter 12 months he was given his parole
so that he might visit his people in
New Zealand. He is now on his way
back to internment camp in Holland.
So here’s the best wishes of the ship’s
company to Flight-Lieut. Harkness,

Unit History.
The 43rd N.Z.F.A., in command of
2nd Lieut.' Sinel, mobilised at Fea-
therston M.C. under the designa-
tion of the 40th N.Z.F.A.
The greater part of the men trans-
ferred from the 39th N.Z.F.A. (which
was considerably over strength) and
details from the Infantry and the
C.l camp made up the strength to
132 other ranks, but owing to various
wastages, at the 1 date of departure,
some 10 men had to be transferred
from the 45th to make up the sailing
strength.
At the start of this unit ’ s training
there were only two artillery units in
camp, and consequently they (the
2ND LIEUT. MOORE, M.M.
40th) were put straight on to more
advanced work with horses and guns,
a good deal of the preparatory squad
drill being cut out.
: Things were not too - pleasant at
this time, as the weather was very
inclement, and most of the outdoor
work was carried out in rain and
sleet.
About ' this time the designation of
the unit was changed to the 44th
N.Z.F.A., and about two weeks before
sailing it was again changed to the
43rd, presumably to fit in with the
numbering of the infantry drafts.
This is the only artillery unit for
.some months past which has had only
the minimum period of training, but
notwithstanding this fact, the men
gave an excellent account of them-
selves at their service shoot, carried
out at Morrison’s, Bush, and on ar
rival at the base, the men, being a
young and keen lot, ought to give a
good' account of themselves.
43RD SPECIALISTS’ COMPANY.
The assembling of this Company
was carried; out at Heretunga (near
Trent ham) during the first week of
April, 1918, and comprised picked
men from District quotas coming to
Gamp from all parts of the Dominion.
The Company was under canvas for
a period of three weeks and then en-
trained to Featherston Camp on 23rd
April.
The original Officers of the Com-
pany at Heretunga were 2nd Lieut.
S. B. Probert, 2nd Lieut. L. O’B,
Fitzmaurice and 2nd Lieut. V. A. L.
Daniel. Mr. Probert was Officer-
Commanding up to 14th June when,
on transfer to 47th Specialists’, Lieut.
J. P. C. Walshe took charge of Unit,
Lieut. Daniel was transferred and 2nd
Lieut. M. G. Curry filled the vacancy.
The latter was transferred to “ B ”
Coy. 37th Reinforcement and was re-
placed by 2nd Lieut. E. J. Davenport
who was subsequently posted to “ C ”
Coy., 35th Reinforcement; 2nd Lieut.
R. Thomson coming to strength.
On embarkation the Officers were
Lieut. J. P. C. (Officer-Com-
manding) attached to Signal Section,
2nd Lieut. L. O.’B. Fitzmaurice, and
2nd Lieut. R. Thomson, Machine Gun
Section.
Just before embarkation of the
original N.C.O.’s of the Company
Cpl. P. F. Skinner was transferred to
47th Specialists where, we are glad
to say, he received deserved promo-
tion to Sergeant.
The following members of the Com-
pany were classed C 2 Lc.-Cpl. W.
J. Keel, 0. G. Bird, W. Chadwick,
; G. E. Haydon, L. Kerr, R. A. Otway,
T. C. Rayner and P. D. Wackildene.
Final leave was granted the Com-
pany in May, the dates being from
22.5.18 to 6.6.18, after which the two
Sections underwent their special train-
ing at respective Schools. The train-
ing was hampered somewhat by wet
weather.
Nevertheless the percentage of
passes in each School was highly
satisfactory and reflected credit on
all concerned. With one or two ex-
ceptions in each Section all succeeded
in passing the various tests and secur-
ing a qualification badge.
During its stay at Featherston Gamp
the Company made a creditable record
in winning the Camp Commandant’s
Cup for best kept lines on no fewer
than six occasions, including three
times in succession.
The performance was duly recog-
nised when final leave and extended
leave dates were allotted by Head-
quarters.


The behaviour of the Company, col-
lectively and individually, was exem-
plary and compares favourably with
any of its predecessors.
Now that the Company is “ For It.”
it behoves all ranks to add further
to the reputation of the “ Good Old
Specs.”
DIVISIONAL SIGNALLERS.
The draft for the Divisional Signal
Corps. N. Z. Engineers comprises one
sergeant and five sappers. Tlfey are
all specially trained signallers, having
undergone a course of training at the
Featherston Military Camp. The
period of training extends over a five
months’ course, and their men are
selected to accompany a reinforcement
when required. On arrival at the base
camp several months of advanced
training on the latest ideas are under-
gone. Men are then drafted to France
as required.
PIONEERS.
The Pioneers total 59 all ranks,
comprising one officer, nine N.0.0.’s
and 49 men, six of whom, (whose ser-
vice is recorded elsewhere) have been
on active service previously.
The majority of the men have just
attained their majority,’ and are most
eager for anything that happens their
way. They began and completed their
training at Narrow Neck Camp, .Auck-
land. Their musketry course was most
satisfactory; there are ten marksmen,
twenty first-class, ten second class
and nine third class rifle shots- —a
truly fine performance.
The physique of the men is splendid,
fine, sturdy-limbed chaps, as is evi-
denced by a casual glance as they,
move about in their “ shorts ” —which,
by the way, is their full dress, and a
very good one too.
The men have entered heartily into
all that is “ going ” ; reports will show
with what results.
On joining up with the Pioneer
Battalion, this draft will be absorbed
into different companies : the North
Auckland men to A Company, Hawkes
Bay and South Island to B Company,
East Coast to C Company, and Wel-
lington, Taranaki and Wai’Kato to D
Company.
The draft is under the command of
2nd Lieut. Moore, M.M.
ROYAL AIR FORCE.
The ship’s complement includes
twenty-three Flying Cadets who have
gained certificates in N.Z. entitling
them to admission into the Royal Air
Force Training Schools in England
for which they are now en route.
Two of the Cadets are from Kohi
Marama School, Auckland, and the
remainder from Lockburn School,
Christchurch.
Considering that a condition prece-
dent to entry into the N.Z. Flying
Schools is a premium of £lOO, which
is forfeited if the Cadet fails to
qualify in England and' that he re-
ceives no allowance whatever until
after he arrives in England, one can-
not but admire these boys for their
pluck and determination.
We regret that pressure of time
compelled us to exclude a very fine
article (by Cadet Pack wood) giving an
account of the N.Z. Cadets’ experi-
ences to date. Success to the Flying
Birds !
39TH N.Z. MEDICAL CORPS. .
The 39th N.Z. Medical Corps mo
bilised on the Bth March at Trent-
ham, and a week later commenced
training at A wap uni Camp, Palmers-
ton North. They proceeded to Race-
course Hospital, Featherston, 18th
May, 1918, where they underwent a
further month’s training and estab
dished the record for speed bandag-
ing. Returned to Awapuni, where
they completed their course of in-
struction. It was here that the
Corps became famed as the ‘ 1 Bivvy
Builders.”
Let us hope that their good per-
formance will continue.
ENGINEERS..
The 43rd draft of the New Zea-
land Engineers, in charge of R.Q -
M. Dyson, had been together only
about one month before embarkation.
Following the usual practice the men
were drafted from various Engineer-
ing Units in training in camp. After
its formation the draft was fortunate
in being placed under the capable in-
struction of Sergeant-Major ——N a
returned man with wide experience,
and embarked as one of the most
efficient drafts of Engineers that have
yet left New Zealand. ,
Just prior to embarkation a com-
pany of infantry was hastily formed
at Trentham, and “ pushed away”
with us under the name of F Com-
pany 43rd reinforcements. Many
of the men were unknown to the
N. ’s, who consequently had no
easy " task. Nevertheless the draft
is performing very creditably, and
doubtless will do justice to their
native land. The company is in
charge of 2nd Lieut. Osborne.
Y.M.C.A.
We feel that our paper would be
incomplete without some reference In
the work of the Y.M.C.A., the great
war work, which is so well known,
and has proved such a boon to our
Forces everywhere.
The Association has, as on pre-
vious Transports, placed a represen-
tative, Mr. W. H. Berry, of Inver-
cargill, on our troopship, and the
assistance given in the matter of pro-
viding equipment, etc., has proved of
very great benefit to all aboard. Many
and varied outdoor and indoor games
wore in evidence, besides which thou-
sands of sheets of writing paper and
envelopes were distributed to the
boys.
The spiritual side of the Associa-
tion’s work was not neglected,
Hymn books, Testaments, etc., being
provided, and Bible classes, sing-
songs and prayer meetings all being
well attended, tending to lead men
to think of the higher things of
life.
In conclusion, on behalf of the men
on'board this Transport, we would
extend our sincere thanks to the
Association for the many necessary
games and comforts provided for the
use of all ranks on board.
The public of New Zealand can
rest assured that the money provided
by them for this institution’s war
work is being expended to the best
advantage.

the rosebuds while ye may. ’ 5
There is many a time that I lie in my
bunk,
And seem to feel kind of blue,
Wishing this whole blamed life to pot.
How it. all seems strange and new !
And I dream and dream of the days
that have been,
With, a life unrestrained and quite
free,
And wonder if the time will ’ere come
again,
When those days once more I shall
see.
Then I question myself, while still in
this mood.
Will I come through alright “ Over
there ” ?
Will I quite act the man, thro thick
and thro thin,
Play the game well and do my
share ?
But I suddenly wake up, get myself
cc back to earth,”
And I laugh once more and feel
glad,
And kick myself hard for the things
that I thought,
Gee ! But I must have been mad.
No ! None of the boys ever talk of the
blues,
They go about wearing a smile,
Don’t think of the morrow, just live
for to-day,
Be merry and bright all the while.
So as day follows day, our old boat
plows her way,
Many miles off the map .she erases,
We’re all merry and bright and
though not after fight,
- Yet we’re ready to give the Hun
blazes !

Dreams Again.
There will be dreams again ! The
grass will spread
Her velvet verdure o’er earth’s tom
breast;
By ragged shard, half hid, where rust
runs red,
The soaring lark in spring will build
her nest.
There will be dreams again ! Ihe
primrose pale
Will shelter where the belching guns
plowed deep ;
The trees will whisper, and the night-
ingale
Chant golden melodies, where heroes
sleep.
There will be dreams again ! lire
stars look down
On youthful lovers—-Oh, first love,
how sweet,
And men will wed, and childish
laughter crown .
.Life’s compelling miracle complete.
There will be dreams again ! Oh,
thou forlorn,
That crumbling trench, or slowly
heaving sea.
Hath snatched thy dead—Oh, pray
thee, do not mourn,
'There will be dreams, —Thy lered
shall come to thee.
A Soldier in the Making,
Here we are sailing along to the goal
to which all our time and training
points. A short time ago we were
among the great unknown, among those
who had done no more than give a few
paltry shillings toward some or, other
of the different Patriotic Societies or
Red Cross Funds. Then when our
call came we mobilised in old Trent-
ham, the camp which has produced
some of the finest soldiers the world
has known. After mobilisation we
were drafted out to our various depots
to undergo training for the particular
branch to which we had been posted.
After many weary weeks of training,
during which we cursed and swore and
gave vent to our feelings in no gentle
manner, we were warned for embarka-
OUR BILLIKIN.
tion. But all our ups and downs did
us good and we felt better as time
rolled on, and when we stepped on
board our transport we were as fit
as could be trained to the minute,
puts it rightly. Now here we are
pn our way to join the boys who have
gone before. We will find on arrival
some members of that peerless Brigade
which landed on Gallipoli on April
25th 1915 l—men who can look back on
“The Landing,” “August,” “The
Evacuation,” the shift to France, then
Armentieres, the Somme, the Auck-
land Raid, Messines, Passchendaele,
the hard fighting of last March, and
this last and greatest of all aMvances---
men who have had their four years
of service. Think of it—four years of
hard fighting! What will their f eel-
ings toward us be? Will they jeer
and scoff us? Will they welcome us
with open arms? Neither;- they- will
set us up, make us comfortable, and
leave the rest to us. Some may ask
us don’t we think we have been a long
time, but these will not be the old
soldiers, rather will they resemble a
young cock which has just learned to
crow. When we arrive we will be
placed on trial, as it were. The eyes
of the platoon will be on us, and we
must wait patiently for their verdict.
We must not ask silly questions, as
die war-worn soldier hates them.
Give the men you meet credit for
knowing more than you do about this
great game of war. When you go into
a trench for the first time don’t get
curious as to what is on the other
side of our parapet. Men have some-
times looked over once, and then again
your turn for Patrol or Listening Post
will come soon enough. Realise the
difference between being game and
being foolhardy, also that between
caution and cowardice. Always do
your work cheerfully and well; re-
member the English meaning of dis-
cipline : “ cheerful obedience.” Be-
fore reaching France, the goal, we will
through ‘ our various Reserve
Depots, and the work and training
gone through will be far more strenu-
ous than any we have known. Here
we will meet men who have fought
and bled for their country. It is a
rule that all men in depots have seen
service. Do not grouse or kick about
what they do or tell you to.do. They
know from experience what is best
suited to fit you out for the work
before you. The food will be much
more plain than that you have been
used to, but “don’t grouse,” rather
remember that there are mothers rear-
ing children in Great Britain who have
not tasted butter for months and that
by the time baby’s food is sweetened
no sugar is left, or at least not enough
for other members of the family.
When you realise that in all things
soldiers come first, you will not
grouse about your share of food.
These few hints are intended to make
your lot a wee Tit easier, and should
you bear them in mind they will have
served their purpose and so have made
a most difficult row a little more easv
to hoe.

Mock Court.
Monday ■ evening September 16th,
will be remembered by all to whom
the. privilege was extended as the night
of a very successful Mock Court held
in the 2nd saloon. In fact we are
speaking with the utmost candour
when we say our reporter’s opinion is
that it was quite the best entertain-
ment of its kind he has seen, and he
speaks from no limited experience.
The fact that all the officers of the
Court were new to the game gieetly
added to the brightness of the proceed-
ings. Nevertheless some of the efforts
would have done justice to many a
professional. The charges, most of
which for absurdity would defy im-
provement, were laid against a num-
ber of the Ist saloon passengers, to
whom a general invitation was ex-
tended. The manner in which all the
prisoners, from the Colonel down-
wards, entered into the spirit of the
thing was particularly pleasing and
greatly Contributed to its success. In
our opinion this sort of conduct cn
the part of officers does more than
anything else to inspire that confidence
without which true discipline, that is,
willing obedience, so indispensable to
success in military affairs, is hard to
obtain. We are not saying this in a
spirit of adulation; we speak sin-
cerely. ' : :
Punctually at 8 p.m. cries of
“Silence” from Detective Cassells
heralded the approach of His Honour
the learned Judge. Judge, did we
say? He looked more like a vaudeville
artiste. The audience displayed its
ignorance by failing to rise as the
Judge entered the Court, but loud and
repeated cries of “Stand up” from
Detecting Cassells soon brought -them
to their senses, and the Judge as-
cended the Bench with all the decorum
proper for such an occasion. Follow-
ing the Judge were the Clerk of the
Court, dressed like a first-class butler.
Counsel for the Defence, whose dress
resembled night attire rather than a
lawyer’s robes, and Counsel for the
Prosecution, who looked like—well,
what did he look like ? Two foot
policemen, one mounted policeman, all
of whom were indeed typical, and a
Judge’s Associate completed the com-
plement of the Court.
Detective Cassells (Staff-Sergt. Har-
per, who was one of the best of a
very good lot) called the-first case in
an awe-inspiring, one might also say
terrorising, manner, and the victim
was none other than Claudius Col-
quhoun, the very Colonel himself.
Oh, how are the mighty fallen !
The Colonel was charged with being
a d~-m good fellow. The first witness,
Beery Bob Brewer, testified that the
Colonel frequently came down to the
hospital and gloated over the suffer-
ings of the patients. Counsel for the
Defence, Mr. Hanlon, in a very elo-
quent and forcible address, argued con-
vincingly that the youth of the accused
was amply sufficient to secure his ac-
quittal. ‘‘ Was it likely,” asked Coun-
sel, 4 4 that a man who had stricken
terror into the hearts of the Huns
could possibly be a d—n good fel-
low?” Counsel for the Prosecution
followed, and the chief merit of his
argument was the amount of forgotten
-—nay, unheard-of—history that be
brought to one’s mind.
“ The Colonel,” he said, “had been
Hannibars right-hand man at Lake
Tanganyika, and later threw his weight
in with the Arabs against the British
Squares in Iceland, while burning
snowflakes fell fast on the arid desert.
Later still we see him the pride of
Laplanders assiduously wheeling his
peanut barrow to the tune of choco-
lates, caramels and jubes, sixpence a
bag. The Historians’ History (Ref.,
par. 24, page 2065, VoL 59) find some
lines in italics stating that accused
fought against Sir Richard Grenville in
Wellington Harbour on June 15th, 54
8.C., also helping the Bolivians in
their rising against themselves 230 :
years later. ‘ 4 The Colonel,” said
Counsel, “was the first of a long list
of criminals, and this was the latest
of a long list of crimes. On his file
would be found 3,876,543 previous
convictions for the same offence,” The
Judge said the prosecution had proved
the case beyond the shadow of a doubt
and imposed a penalty of a box of
cigars, which, be it said to the prison-
er’s credit, was promptly paid next
morning,
Percy Plantagenet Billiken, alias
Milliken, pleaded not guilty to a
charge of being an habitual gambler
and of being in possession of a Crown
and Anchor board.
Detective Cassells testified that he
had found accused playing poker,
roulette, fantan, pakapoo, and other
such games in a Chinese shop.
Constable Dinney corroborated the
evidence of his confrere.
Fee Fie Fo Fum, lessee of the
gambling house, in a particularly in-
teresting manner gave details of the
gambling that had been carried on by
accused at his house and we were
sorry to learn that our Provost Ser-
geant was implicated—when he was
not on another sort of gambling—a
gambling with death from a broken
heart. His Honour, our reporter
could not help noticing, seemed to
follow the witness with remarkable
familiarity, but this could hardly be
so; our reporter, we admit, has a
fairly vivid imagination.
Lieut. Dudd said the accused and
he were old pals of long standing
friendship, and that, if the accused
would pay back the sixpence he owed
him, he (Lieut. Dudd) would testify
to accused’s innocence.
Bishop Wowser of Waiapu stated
that accused was religious on Sun-
days, but frequented the house of
Fee Fie Fo Fum on Fridays.
Counsel for Defence likened ac-
cused to Brutus, which he said in
Hebrew meant Billiken. ** Who,”, said
Counsel, “ is the man that'the town
is going mad about—Billiken, that’s
him/ 5
But pleading was useless, guilt
was written in indelible letters on the
accused’s very face,- and in any event,
had accused been as innocent as a
saint, it would have been of no avail,
as the Judge, with commendable con-
sistency worthy of imitation by some
of his less scrupulous brother Judges
had plainly made up his mind that
convictions were to be recorded in all
cases. Accused was accordingly found
guilty and fined 100 cigarettes.
Queer Quack Tracy Inglis was
charged with taking Ant ip on.
Beery Bob Brewer testified that ac
cused took Antipon every morning,
but on cross-examination by Mr.
Hanlon admitted that there were
other bottles in the same medicine
chest and that he was merely judging
by the labels. Counsel for Defence
argued that the accused’s goodly pro-
portions could not be due to anything
but whisky. Had he taken Antipon
as alleged he would have been as thin
as a pull through. We regret that
space does not permit us to report
further arguments of Counsel.
The doctor was convicted and pro-
hibited' from taking Antipon for six
months and fined a bottle of Johnny
Walker which has been duly paid.
Good old Queer Quack!
John Thomas Padre, alias Gilfillan,
charged with (1) exceeding time
limit* (2), regularly having two after-
noon teas; (3) drunkenness on and off
parade, t
Detective Cassells testified that he
came from the same district as ac-
cused and that he was in the habit of
taking ten seconds over his sermons.
Steward Bathbrick said ... accused
cleared the 2nd saloon and then for-
aged the Ist saloon. Witness ad-
mitted to accused’s Counsel that the
accused was on Army rations. The
Bishop said that accused was once a
- member of their clergy but on ac-
count of liquid- communion with a
spirit by name Johnny Walker had
gone astray.
On the first count the Judge said
he would take into consideration the
extenuating circumstances—we heard
none—and dismiss the charge. On
the second count he was convicted and
ordered to take three afternoon teas
in future-
On the third charge he was con-
victed and the Judge said that as this
was the third offence within six
months there was no option but to
commit him to Pakatoa and declare
him an habitual criminal.
Passionate Percy Woods, charged
with exceeding the speed limit and
appropriating another man’s goods,
pleaded, through his counsel, not
guilty.
John Cordite stated that accused
did use the words alleged. Counsel


for defendant said that the witness
had not touched on the case. Wit-
ness replied that accused had touched
on his case—not merely one bottle—
but the whole case.
Pansy Flower (who made, quite
the best witness of the evening),
dressed as a nurse, gave touching
evidence. When she finished there
was hardly a dry eye, and when she
fainted, oh ! the cries of “ Shame ”
fairly rent the lurid atmosphere. Sister
Pansy Flower frankly admitted that
she was indeed in love with one of
the officers, but that (and here she
wept bitterly) he had—well—he had-
ty must be imposed/- Accused was
' banished from the upper deck after
sundown and fined 50 cigarettes. Fine
not yet paid—1.8.9.1918, 9 a,m,
Cheerio Chin Chin Walsho charged
with (1) Desertion; (2) Being a per-
son of no visible means of support.
Fuzzy Foster said he had nothing
against the prisoner personally but
he was bound to say he had not seen
much of him in the first saloon, not
even at meal times. He had seen ac-
cused going about with a tiny glim-
mering light like Diogenes looking
for an honest man. On the second
charge, witness said he could state
Constable Dinney said that he
found accused fifty yards from his
own quarters and that he wore awor-
ried frightened look,
Lieut. Dudd’s evidence against the
accused was to the effect that he and
2nd Lieut. Sinel frequently ate choco-
lates in the 3rd saloon,
The convictions against accused car-
ried a penalty of twelve drinks at the
first port of call.
The last case to be dealt with was
that against Charles Plate Powder
Goddard charged (1) with going in
the wrong direction; (2) taking the
sun. Fuzzy Foster said on one oc-
er-hurt his foot. (We are not sure
but we have a faint notion that she
referred to 2nd Lieut. Osborne who
had the misfortune to break a bone in
his foot some weeks ago). Roars of
laughter from the spectators brought
forth Detective Cassells’ thundering
voice : “ Silence, silence in the Ladies’
Gallery ” and silence reigned supreme
(we don’t think). Sister Flower
stated further that during her loved
one’s absence accused had taken his
place • she had made no overtures to
accused but he had. She did really
love the other one—her real boy—but
then she must have company.
The Judge said it was the most dis-
graceful case he had ever had before
him and consequently a severe penal-
THAT DAILY INSPECTION SENSATION.
most emphatically that accused
smoked cigarettes to excess, and just
as emphatically that he never smoked
his own.
Detective Cassells said accused was
one of the worst men in the District.
He frequented race-courses, pie carts
and oyster saloons. Accused when
arrested had in his pockets a three-
penny bit and a dirty singlet. Wit-
ness in answer to accused’s counsel
gave an enlightening account of the
difference between " A steak a’ de
Oyst Saloon ” and “ A cafe de Curb ’*
and between the latter and “ A cafe
de Gutter.” The first sold German
sausages, the second poisoned saveloys
and the third stale pork pies.
casion when he came on deck he
found the ship had been turned
round, and that accused said it was
the world that had turned round. ,
_ . _ , ~
On the second charge witness said
accused did not take the sun at the
last port of call. Counsel for defen-
dant elicited from witness that he had
tried to steer by the stars at the last
port of call and but for the accused
would never have got home. Gerty
Go-slow, dressed as a vaudeville
dancer, tripping the light fantastic,
addressed the accused in most endear-
ing terms, as she stepped forward to
give evidence, which was most in-
criminating. Counsel for Defence in
a telling address which unfortunately


appeared to make as little impression
' on his Honour’s mind as water on -a
duck’s back, contended that the evi-
dence showed conclusively that ac-
cused did not take the sun, he took
the daughter.
As usual, accused was convicted and
fined six drinks, two of which have
since been paid.
The “Court stands adjourned”

a very enjoyable evening to a conclu-
sion. The performers received a very
deserving round of applause, and we
sincerely hope this is not the only
amusing turn to which we will be
treated on the voyage.

Lest We Forget.
Our magazine, we feel, would not be
complete without some account of the
record of those of us who have already
" done their bit ” either in the present
or any previous war.
By some it may be thought that
these pages are superfluous, inasmuch
as thousands of others from our little
Dominion are in the same category,
and many others who have paid the
Supreme Sacrifice; but we have kept
steadily in mind two things : first, that
familiarity should not be allowed to
render ns oblivious of the debt which
civilization owes to those worthy Sons
of Empire; and, secondly, that the
Magazine is primarily for us and ours.
We are especially glad to include
the Boer War veterans, for whom, we
say candidly enough has not been done
in the past. Though that War was
perhaps merely a midget alongside the
present conflict, let us remember that
it had a great bearing on the political
and social affairs of the Empire, and
ai great bearing on the present war.
It was the Boer War which showed
the Motherland that the Colonies had
grown to manhood, that the Colonial
was as good as his brother " Tommy.”
It was the Boer War which showed
that the ties of Empire were real; it
was the Boer War which gave us a
Botha and a Smuts; and, finally, this ;
same war awakened us from our ad-
olescent slumbers and showed us the
way to fight. To our mind the Boer
War has been a blessing in disguise,
and we do not think we exaggerate
when we say that history would have
recorded a far more unsatisfactory
result to the present Armageddon had
Britain not had the experience of the
Boer War.
We may mention that many of the
accounts have been very reluctantly
given, in fact some have been extorted
one might say, at the point of the
bayonet; the length of some reports
is consequently shorter than it ought
to be and in several cases quite in
inverse ratio to the value of the service
that has been rendered to the righteous
cause for which the 9 Allies fight.

Rookie (pointing to the Company
Orderly Room); Say, chum, what’s

professional etiquette to report that an

Digger.
One hears the name at every turn.
"Digger, give us a fag!” " Digger,
lend ns a franc I ” and very, very
often, "Here, Digger, put this dres-
sing, will yon?” One hears it here
on this old ship of ours, and one
wonders if half those who use the term
know the meaning of it. The wonder-
ing brought on the idea (new ones
are not often known in the Army)
that an explanation may prove useful
to ourselves and the people who watch
and wait. For does not a song say
“ Men must work and women must
weep,” and waiting and weeping go
hand in hand in these times. Well, it
has _ been- a noted fact that since the
Division has been in France it has not
taken over any part of the line that
was in the good state of repair that
the one just left .was. This necessi-
tated much work with pick and shovel,
and so after a short while the boys
became as good with these implements
as they were with their various
weapons, which is saying some. . After
we had reached this stage it was not
a far cry to the old rush days when all
who sought the precious metal were
Diggers. The name was given and has
stuck, and will, I think, stick until
one Wilhelm has had his last mad fling
for world supremacy, then we peer
Bills and Jims may have a show of
being called by the name mother thinks
best of all. In conclusion, a yarn I
heard one time, A counle of Aus-
tralians were standing in a small vil-
lage behind our lines when some troops
appeared in the distance. After a
good look one Aussie said : "New
troops, wonder who they are.” The
other chap ha cl a good look, then srid :
"Must be New Zealanders; tney’re
carrying shovels.”

SCENES
ON BOARD.


The Machine Gunners.
The Machine Gunners are a branch of
the Specs,,
And a very large one too;
It is even rumoured they are the best,
But that we’ll leave to you.
Their officers make a merry pair.
And solemn looks they seldom wear :
Fitzmaurice and Thomson are their
names.
And next on the list will come I
wager
The quarter, Beale, and the Sergeant-
Major’
The latter, Kenny, is a man of pluck,
And well to the company both have
stuck.
Tilley’s a Sergeant and Clarke’s one
too.
They wake us and drill us, they’ve
lots to do,
.And they often appear' in our games;
The corporals treat us fairly well,
There’s 'Hill and Gordon and Tread-
well.
Now Worcester and,Hunt are lance-
jacks game,
And Knoxie also is much the same.
But Wilson, foremost is he of all,
“Kiwi” his nickname, as known to
us all,
And the photos he spoils is a shame.
And now, come the privates who num-
ber three score,
They’re right up to the mark, I’d
have told you before,
But for fear of offending those above
us, yon know,
Right in the background we only must
show.
We eat the ship’s stew, and like it
quite well,
And we like jam roll, as the
steward can tell.
But the tea gives us room to complain.
Bayly and Blair come top of the list,
Then Borrie, Buchanan and Brown;
Coleman and Glapham the photo-
graphist,
And Collier whoTl argue a grin is a
frown.
Then Watson and Stables otherwise
“ lloni,”
Cathro, Duncan and Vernazoni,
And Peeler Chamberlain.
Davidson, Fraser, Gifford and Greig,
None of them very fond of the keg.
Heath and Richworth insep’rable
pain.
And Brunt and Connor who fell down
the stair.
Then Martin and Matthews the camera
men,
And King who’s on his way back
again
To give it another go.
Then Mitchell, Perry, Patchett and
Read,
I cannot say much of them new,
Rusbatch and Ritchie, we’ll pass on
with speed,
To Ross who once hashed all our stew ;
To Garton the bugler, and Tregurtha
the clerk,
And Duncan who always was fond of
the dark,
And Ritchie and Hewlett and Rowe,
A number of others well deserve men-
tion,
But would soon make this story too
long,
And I don’t want to keep your nerves
at such tension,
So I’ll have to be moving along.

Sergeant (to 2nd saloon steward) :
Why have these oranges such thick
skins ?
Steward : Oh, that’s to keep out
the cold; they’re kept in the freezer,
you know.
“Our Birds.”
On board this grey old transport
We’ve a number of “ Birds” who
train;
They’re bound for some Homeland
port,
From thence they will entrain ;
They come from o’er New Zealand,
To join up in the fray,
To move the good cause onward
And help to win the day;
They volunteered in Maoriland
For the good old cause of “ Right,”
To help and slay that Hun Bafid
Who have no thought but fight;
And when we’re in the dark blue sky
At a high and dizzy height,
We’ll show those cows of Germans
The reason why we’d fight.
A great old time we all will have
If we get in the air of France,
Those Germans of the Kaiser
We’ll lead a hearty dance,
For we did not come from o’er the
seas
To spend our time in playing,
But show the German Huns the art
Of giving them a flaying.
And when this war is over,
If some of us pull through,
We’ll lock back with a heavy sigh
And think of all of you.
A thought we’ll give for this old tub,
And wish it were at hand,
The very pleasant times we spent
On our trip to the “ Old Home-
land.”

The Song of the Trimmer.
We knows the songs o’ sailormen, —
their jolly life and free.
An’ ’ow they finds a wife in every
port;
But when us blokes wot trims the coal
goes out upon a spree
We sings a song o’ quite a different
sort.
When the ’ooker’s doo for sailing,
Ho ! the Chief is cussin’ prime,
An' the ol’ man’s pacin’ topsides
in a stink;
For the stags as does the trimmin’ job
ain’t come aboard to time; —
Cos we ’ad to ’ave another little
drink.
They’ll log us in the mornin’, while
the becond goes around
Through the bunkers with a spanner
in ’is paw;
’An’ ’e’U shove us on to “ dooeers ”
till the rest is fit an’ sound.
An’ ’e’ll threaten to break someone’s
blinkin’ jaw.
The smart fore-cabin passengers is
frequent down below,
To try their ’and a-shovelling the
coal;
So we cadges fags an’ matches, an’
sits down to ’ave a blow,
An’ watch them do the wheelin’ in
a roll !
Flo ! it’s nice to run yer barrer to the
pocket gapin’ wide,
Flown the midships bunkers, in the
slush-lamp’s gleam;
When the glass is up to boilin’ an’ the
water overside
Is near to ninety, churnin’ through
the Stream,
\us, it’s fine to struggle forrard from
the fiddley to "the peak*
As we run the Eastin’ down to make
the Horn;
Am’ she takes the grey-backs over,
while we waits to make a break
. For the fo’c’sle scuttle when the nex’
one’s gorn.
An’ down where OF Nick’s firin’ an’
a-beating ’is tattoo,
Us stags’ll meet ’im, shovels in cur
’ands;
An’ ’e’ll call the watch together on the
plates for a shivvoo,
With a blackpan from the shinin’
angel bands.

Maori Anecdotes.
By Haka.
A good story is told of a Maori
named Tomati.' Amongst his fellows
Tomati enjoyed financial reputation
(based entirely on outward display)
far in excess of what he deserved,
and it was a common fallacy that he
possessed a substantial bank account.
Consequently Tomati’s cheque was ac-
ceptable at face value by the vast
majority of his- fellow natives. At
a certain North Island race meeting
Tomati was met by a “ friend ” who
wanted tto borrow £lo—a very com-
mon experience, so our racing enthusi-
asts tell us. Tomati was placed in a
very awkward predicament —he wished
neither to lend nor to refuse, as in the
one event he felt sure he would lose
his money; in the other event his
friend’s good fellowship. After a
little apparent serious deliberation he
replied Aery sorry, lost all cash on
races to-day, but if you like to take
cheque— ? ” The cheque was quite
acceptable to Tomati’s now jubilant
friend, and duly extracted from
Tomati before (so his friend reasoned)
there was time for a change of de-
cision. Now, it so happened that
Tomati, being in need of cash for the
races, had that very day closed the
comparatively small bank account to
which he could lay claim. Having lost
all his money, Tomati (following the
usual practice, so it is said) retired
from the race-course before the con-
clusion of the meeting. On his way
home by train he was handed an
urgent telegram, which read : “Lost
ch * que ; kindly stop payment at bank. 55
Tomati curtly replied : “Don't worry;
cheque stop himself.”

Things the Editor would
like to know.
Whether it is a fact that a certain
Officer (not attached to the Infantry)
went into a fruiterer’s shop at one of
the ports of call and asked how much
were the pyjamas a bunch? Quite a
number of our subscribers say there
was a motive for such a question.
Who was the N.C.O. in F Coy.,
43rd Infantry who gave the command
“ At the double quick march.”
If all the nurses wore regulation
dress on the night of the big alarm?
Ask the Provost Sergeant.
Has a certain ecclesiastical gentle-
man of the Ist saloon entered for the
“ Consumption Stakes,” for it is a
well-known fact he is a regular at-
tender at afternoon tea in the 2nd
class saloon and shortly afterwards
may be seen doing himself well at a
similar function in his own quarters ?
Ask James.
If certain would-be birds will be
allowed to strut the decks in such gaily
coloured plumage when we reach the
danger zone? Ask Gussie.
If a Sergt. and Sergt.-Major in
2nd class saloon are prepared to give
instruction on “ Returns and how to
treat them?” Just ask ’em.
Do soldiers growing seven a side
intend to join sweepers’ fatigue ? Ask
Dan.
How a certain Sergt. occupies his
spare moments on the boat-deck during
the evening hours. Ask Mare.
Is it correct that a Q.M.S., when
saying “ Any complaints, men,” re-
ceived the answer: “Yes, there’s a
bad smell here?” Ask H.
Did an Officer of the day get his
shins barked when he fell over a
shadow sleeping on the poop-deck aft?
Ask the Nurses.
Do two responsible ship N.C.O.’s
share moustache wax? Ask Pansy.
If the Padre is prepared to tie the
Nuptial Knot, as Cuming and Going
of the Suicide Corps are inseparable i?
Ask Knobby.
Would a stitch in time have saved
nine when he went Outski ? Ask
Cordite.
Wanted Known.—Get. rid of that
stiffness in your sleeping quarters by
two or three games of draughts before
retiring. (Advt. Black and White.)
It is true that the ship’s canteen is
a dry one, but nevertheless our spirits
are good enough for me. Open up a
Port or two every morning.


Limericks.
A favourite is Colonel Colquhoun ;
To have him O.C. is a boon.
Though he sometimes was lacking
In an artillery backing
He could always protect his platoon.
The Adjutant’s right on his job;
He’s the powers of an Indian Nabob.
From reveille at six
He is going great, licks—
And all for an extra five bob !
Our P.M.O. Col. Tracy-Inglis,
Has a special vaccine which he mingles
In our blue-blooded veins.
Causing all sorts of pains,
But he only grins more as it tingles.
Major Dudley is also a doctor,
And of physics a dexterous concoctor;
Drilling bare to the knee
With his N.Z.M.C.
He has more of the style of a proctor.
Two high-flyers—Hirschberg and
Harkness,
Have frequently “ spiralled ” in dark-
ness.
If it’s . “ Slippery Sam”,
Or bombarding Potsdam,
They’ve a bite that is not always
barkless.
Our Padre—Capt. T. E. Gilfillan,
Admires himself much for his skill in
Arranging all games,
Or attending the dames,
—And two afternoon teas are quite
fillin’!!
Friend Parker controls the canteen ;
He seems to think all is serene.
It isn’t his. fault,
But we’d like to assault
The fellow who stocked that shebeen.
“ Rangi ” Woods is a gunner from
France,
And we guess that he made the Bosche
dance
In his 50% zone;
But he cannot condone
The poor infantry’s sheer ignorance.
When the war’s going worse than it
oughter,
We will call, for Moore’s dinky trench
mortar;
And in between whiles,
From his dear lady’s smiles
He will hop out to join in the
slaughter.
Long Thomson’s a practical joker;
His long suit is really as stoker.
With his instrument queer
He would charm any ear; —• p
And his films exceed even his poker.
We must make up a rhyme for
Fitzmaurice,
Who has also been over before us;
With his bon machine-gun
He’ll again chase the Hun
And lay odds on a “Kamerad” chorus.
Percy Walshe is the beau of the ship;
Every hour of this excellent trip
He is working and walking
And touring and talking; —
And his torch makes things go with a
. zip.
Another gunner we know is Sinel;
He thinks he’s no end of a swell.
He stayed down the hold
Till the ‘“gift ’’ goods were sold, —-
What the profits were no one can tell.
Captain Foster attends—(between
rollers)
To our canines, incisors, and molars;
They say that his filling
Is perfectly killing,—
He himself prefers other consolers !
Poor old Osborne had rotten bad luck;
His skipping rope once ran amuck.
It injured his ankle,
But this needn’t rankle,
For the girls hover round this lame
duck.
Our Nurses are ladies of learning ;
Their laurels at games they are
earning.
Our next .port of call
Seems to hold them in thrall,
And to set foot ashore they are
yearning.

A Midnight Flitting.
At 8.30 p.m. on Saturday nigNt the
starboard dormitory was full of busy
life and tobacco smoke. At 9.30 p.in.
the silence was broken only by the
heavy breathing of the occupants.
Two hours passed by uneventfully.
Then this peaceful silence, was
rudely shattered by six blasts on the
steamer’s whistle—the signal for life-
boat drill.
The dormitory was galvanised into
sudden life. Dark forms sat up in
bed and queriously inquired what the
h was the matter.
Being a heavy sleeper, I was cue of
the last to awake, and when I
tumbled out the dormitory was full
of busy forms, each muttering angrily
to himself. As I hopped out of bed
I seized a lifebelt. Unfortunately my
neighbour seized it too, and, after a
brief and unsuccessful struggle, I
departed in search of another, which I
eventually found. Racing back to my
hammock, I jumped into a pair of
trousers (which I later discovered to
belong to someone else), and made
for the door. Everyone seemed to be
making for that door. After squeez-
ing through I stumbled down the
ladder, ran along the main-deck and
climbed up on to the poop-deck,,
stubbing my toe violently as I did so.
Without stopping, I struggled on to
the boat-deck and sat down. For a
minute or two I was fully occupied
with my toe, but then I had a chance
to look about a bit.
Judging from appearances, a stranger
would undoubtedly have thought us to
be a company of “ Scotties ” in kilts.
Everywhere were men airily attired in
shirts and money belts, running and
climbing to the boat-decks. Just now,
however, my attention was distracted
hy the Sergeant who appeared in a
pair of silk pyjamas of wondrous hue
startling even in the pale moonlight.
By now. all our crew had arrived,
everyone commenting on the wisdom
of; the Captain with no uncertain
voice. We also discovered that the
night wind was cool and refreshing, to
say the least of it.
As soon as the bugle call went, sig-
nifying that all was over, we. all made
a dash back to shelter, and m a few
minutes the ship was once again en-
veloped in silence.
The following is a true story :
(Sarcastic Engin'eer, watching
R.F.C. members who have been
drenched by sea being shipped, call-
ing his mate).
“ Hurry up, Sap, and come and see
these Homing Pigeons kidding them-
selves they are ducks.”
Yours faithfully,
Wymoznihan, N.Z.E.


Ship’s Commandments.
1. Thou shalt love none other ship
better than this.
2. Thou shall not take light refresh-
ments within the lounge or food
°f any sort that is in the heaven
above or the earth beneath, or
water under the earth. Thou shalt
not sit down in the dining saloon,
nor rest till tfie heads of the ship
stroll in, for the motto of the ship
is Progress, for the Commander
hateth all slackers.
3- Thou shalt not speak home truths of
any of the ship’s personnel, for
the Adjutant lendeth not his ears
to the strings of a lyre.
4. Remember that thou smoke not be-
tween the hours of sunset and sun-!
rise. Set hours hast thou to smoke
in which thou cans't do all thou
hast to do; of what thou lea vest
shall the N.Z.A.N.S. do. For in
the day they do no manner of
work—-they, their pals, and the,
stewardess, and the stranger
which sometimes comes within
their gates.
5. Honour thy Commander and the
O.C. that thy days may be happy
in the boat wherein thou strivest.
6. Thou shalt do no murder to thy
Padre, either by too much Trench
indulgence, or accidental over-
working,
7. Thou shalt not miss the boat at the
next port of call.
8. Thou shalt not steal another man’s
socks or his private tucker.
9. Thou shalt not bear false witness
against our N.Z.M.C.
10. Thou shalt not covet thy neigh-
bour s cabin; thou shalt not covet
thy neighbour’s towel, nor his
toothbrush, nor his Strawberry
box, nor his vaccination against
smallpox, nor, anything that is his.

A WELL-PROTECTED
TRANSPORT.
The Y.M.C.A. Magazine depot and
a Canteen full of tin fish,

board, but we seldom see a tenner.

The Smart One : No, but I have
several sisters (nurses) on board.
KIT INSPECTION.
Officer: Where is your sea-kit,
Murphy:?'' '
Pte. Murphy : That’s alright,' sir, I
threw it overboard the day we left. '
Routine.
As that tired feeling, and the hours
for bed draw near,
From Saloon we’re shunted and down
below do clear,
Then from our weary hearts there
comes a stunning sigh,
As we our wannish cabins and
rumpled beds do spy.
With feelings most disastrous and full
of wrath and rage
We seek the perpetrators of this im-
mense outrage,
And wonder who the deuce has
pinched our nice clean clothes,
Thus making us unable to commence
our sweet repose.
We have a fair idea who did the
dirty work,
So duty in revenge we would not dare
to shirk,'
And make a straight-way rush to the
Artillery, dumps,
Where all the men are lurking like a
lot of bally funks.
cc Come out, vile beggars, to the
light !” we yell,
And then and there we cause a mighty
row like hell,
As down the narrow corridors we
chase as if we’re mad,
With water-bottles in our hands, we’ 11
serve them jolly glad.
At last they come to bail against the
cabin wall,
And soon are reinforced by a running
Medical,
Who, despite a Red Cross badge
adornment on his arm,
Is always very keen, and out to do ns
harm.
The fun it doth continue amidst a
rowdy scuffle,
The wrangling and the wrestling
being something awful
Until old sleep approaching with very
stealthy tread,
Bids the boys-depart to each respec-
tive bed.
Ihe morning soon does dawn, and
being most refreshed,
As never do we dream our slumber
to disturb,
We very soon arise, and forth to
breakfast run,
Ready for the work ere day has
scarce begun.
As through the day of toil we manage
to exist,
We wonder why the hell we wanted
to enlist;
But all are very willing each to do
his bit for right,
So carry on until the day doth mingle
with the might, -
Tea being ended we to smoking-room,
adjourn,
Where quietness and peace should
always reign supreme,
But scarcely has a fellow on his vir-
tuous couch reclined
V^hen—-bash—-a dirty pillow does,
smite him from behind.
A yell is quickly heard “ Go for your
very life,”
And then and there begins a mighty
awful strife,
In which the Flying Boys are out to-
do their best
To stop poor Archie Harper, Artillery
and the rest.
As Father Time goes on, our strength
begins to wane,
Until a truce is called, and never ’tis.
in vain.
So, feeling very tired and nigh unto
be sick,
We ask for some slow music to be,
played by dear Old Nick.
Of course, our strong entreaties he
never can resist,
So seats himself at piano and gives us.
of his best,
Which wafts us from the present into,
some past so sweet,
That makes us think of home and.
then things good to eat.
So do the evenings pass upon this
ship so fine,
And well it is we know just where to
draw the line,
For romping with the boys is good
while sailing o’er the billows,
’Specially carried on amongst such
very decent fellows.
“ Well, good-night,' hoys,” we bear
from nearly every lip,
And wend our weary way to cabins
on the ship,
So once in bunks quite warm and
covered with the clothes
We do not care a damn if it Rains,
Hails, Blows or Snows.
Morning—once again we’re wakened
by a shout,
And find old Arch. Harper coming in
to pull us out,
As quickly we descend from off our
bunks so sweet,
We say to the intrduer : “ WeTl fix
you up a treat.”
Boys will be boys, and no sport would
Complain,
But still we have had notice from rag-
ging to refrain,
So ’tis evident to all the lads there’s
creeping things aboard,
And plain it is that one has
“ peached ” to our C£ King Pin ”
or “ Loud,”' ' ' ■'


A meet has taken place by reps, of
every badge
To show their good position, to
M.M.M. our Ad j,,
As he was once a "boy, and did enjoy
such sport,
He thinks that romping round is fun
of decent sort.
Of course, he has to speak as if we're
in the wrong,
So leaves it to our honour and doesn’t
make a song,
And as ail things are quite correct,
and still no damage done.
It surely will not be amiss if we do
carry on.;
So pass the quiet days as on our
course we sail,
But let us not imagine that duty one
will fail. ■ ■ ' ' , ' , -
We never shall forget, as no one with
us. ought,
The happy days we spent on Troop-
ship one, one, nought.

The Call.
As I was walking out with my gal, as
serves as a cook at Tootui,
Along comes a fellow of Kitchener’s
Corps, on leave from the Front
recruiting;
He was brown' and straight, with a
corporal’s stripes, but I laughed
when I heard him pleadin’ :
“ Your country needs you mate,” says
he, Says I
“ She can go on needin’.”
cc If to stand in a ditch and be shot,”
says I, C£ is your £ modus oper-
and!,’

“ I’m ’anged,’ 5 says ’e, ‘‘ if you
look it,”
£C An’ two quid a week is enough for
me, so take my tip, an’ ’ook it.”
We sauntered on to the barrack square
to watch the khaki’s drillin’.
H| Left wheel, right wheel,” “ Poor
beggars,” I cried, “ as ’ave sold
their souls for a shillin’.”
When away from the rear comes "a-
bugle note, and it sets my blood
a leapin’,
For it called like the . voice of a mil-
lion dead to a manhood sleepin’,
sleepin’.
And as I listened I saw the sky flare
red with the light of Battle,
And I heard the clatter of chargin’
hoofs and- the Vicker’s deadly
rattle,
And I turned to the girl : “ Good-
bye,” I seys, “ though I love you
true and steady.
His Majesty’s asked me to do my bit,
and I’ve stayed too long already.”
And now I’m a sprawl in a blood-
soaked trench, and above there’s
hell’s own thunder,
And the hillside’s black with the
watching Hun, and a lot of us
may go under,
But I 'don’t give 'a damn what the
end rnay be, for clear through
the shrapnel failin’
I can hear the voice that the Empire
heard, the voice of a bugle callin’.

THE SHIELD.
THE EUAHINEAN REVIEW.


SERGEANT WEBB.
Rumour hath it that the mystery
the disappearance of our
mascot pup was sensationally cleared
mp yesterday morning at, breakfast. It
appears that one of the signallers
while waiting to be served .with his
breakfast sausage had struck up a
whistling tune. To his astonishment
one of the sausages immediately rose
up, wagged its tail and barked.
Needless to say we are not bring-
ing any more mascots on board.
MY COUNTRY COBBER.
He walked into camp one eventful
day, dressed in blueys and with his
grip in his hand, just in time for tea.
Placing him at the end of the table,
I told him it was Rafferty’s rules and
to fist hold of a knife and fork and
dig out. Dig out ! Gords-struth! He
ate two dixie lids, the tea-urn, four
empty bully beef tins and drank the
messes’ washing water, and then
Tolled up and slept. Next day he
got his uniform, and what a pet he
looked! Bill Nassey would have
given himself up if he could have only
seen him. The O.C. asked who the
baby camel was, and my country
cobber got the trump. Dinner-time
I got chummy with him and asked Idm
where he worked, and he told me he
was relieving nurse on a farm relieving
cows of their milk till he got the sack.
“ Sack, Cobs, what did you get the
sack for? “ I ate the rubber pipes
off the milking machine in mistake for
macaroni, ’ ’ says my poor country
cobber. Well, the Sergt.-Major drum-
med him into shape, and in due course
Cobs and I embarked with a third-
class passage backsheesh for the flying
foundry in F'rance, and it is to" my
eternal sorrow to say I have worn out
three ladles and f our carving knives
carving returns for my country cobber,
and owing to not getting enough to eat
he can be seen any day with green
glasses on following the carpenter
round, eating wood-chips and pre-
tending they are grass, and this is

Periscope Annie.—From your old pal
HOUSY.
THE MASCOT.
While at the port of call I heard
the following about our mascot, as
told by one of the passengers to a
civilian :
Yes, we have a mascot of the
dog variety. “ Specs ”is very playful
by nature, too playful for a boat. You
should have seen the floor after he
had been let loose for a night. Deck
shoes ruined, sleeves torn out of
coats left on the floor by untidy and
unsuspecting soldiers, everything tear-
able torn to shreds, that was how a
dog showed his gratitude for being
taken for a trip to Blighty.
During the daytime he proved a
continual source of annoyance, especi-
ally to the officer who stumbled over
him and descended the steps without
the trouble of touching every step.
At meal times he caused much merri-
ment, once he ran between a mess-
orderly and lowered him into a dixie
of soup.
A scape-goat for all our troubles,
the dog was blamed for all missing
articles. As a thief he earned an envi-
able reputation, having the credit of
appropriated articles varying in size
from a knife to a piano.
Although he destroyed lifebelts and
hammocks, the tempers of tired and
perspiring scrubbers, and would per-
sist in sleeping on men’s clothing, it
was not until' he murdered the ship’s
cat that “ Specs.” No. not registered
mascot of the ship, was court-mar-
tialed.
Rumours floated around the ship as
to the sentence. The best was that
our innocent fox-terrier was to be cast
adrift on the ocean on a specially
constructed raft, but the find-
ing of the field service court-martial
was, Guilty, to be shot at down.
Dawn,—the ship’s deck was unusu-
ally animated. The different units
were drawn up on their respective
parade grounds, the firing party after
cleaning their rifles stood at atten-
tion. It was not until the Kazoo
band had nearly finished the “Dead
March” in Saul that “Specs.” was
brought forward. I closed my eyes as
the shots rang out. When I opened
them timidly to have a look at the
corpse, I shared the general con-
sternation of the onlookers. Specs.”
was still alive, what is more, the
bullets had severed the cords tying
the dog to the winch, and evidently
“•Specs.” had no faith in the result
of a second volley and ran for his
life.
I shall never forget the scene that
followed : soldiers, officers and even
N.C.O.’s lowered their dignity to
catch the prisoner. A steward
found him in the Ist class saloon,
busily converting the Brussels carpet
into door mats. After the parade
had again been drawn up in review
order, the firing party fired, the en-
couraging remark, “To fix bayonets
and charge, ” improved their shooting,
and “ Specs.” died prematurely.
Now it is bad enough to sail with-
out a mascot and we all knew that it
courted disaster to rid the ship of
the only charm against evil. Fortun-
ately the difficulty was quickly solved.
Our mascot neatly stuffed adorns the
Ist class saloon. The irony of it is
that I who never wished the dog
any harm have been detailed as a
special fatigue to carry the case at
the front of all route marches. Not
one of the spectators has ever guessed
the cruel fate of our mascot.”
At this stage the “civy ” suddenly
remember an appointment and the
soldier reluctantly finished bis yarn
and went into a jewellers to buy a
lucky kewpie.

Good-morning, Doughy.
Good-morning, Harold,
How’s the motor-bike, Doughy?
Did the tyre stand all right? No,
Harold, it blew out at the Domains.
Go on! Oh, here’s Jack. How are
you, Jack? How T ’s the jigger ? Good-
morning, Doughy and Harold. Look
at that man there, hands in his pocket
when standing at ease. Good heavens!
Trained Signallers! I wonder what
they’ll play with in France; didn’t
ought to be, anyhow. Got a Syilaby

only 26 ? —got a parade state allrite,
march ’em up, and get ’em to send the

not the Tin Utt—-Ready—Dots too
deep, don’t aggravate the flag, like
a man in front of the band—yer bin

you have of snowballing h—ll.
—• Oil Dot by numbers letcher
AK —Send M. No, M—
Lena C, Emma, for —-sake—No, no,
no, yer’d better go and see, Emma.
Harold appears and gives instructions
to proceed to Beer AK (BA) with full
kit, to establish his pet scheme (this is
better than Doughy’s or Umpty
Tddy’s). Now then, out with those
reels, hurry up, you should a-been
there long ago, the rest of you fellows
go out six miles away with flags—No,
no telescopes—visual signalling—l’ve
read 'em; myself at that distance—
Sergt., look at that Runner cf yours
—look at him, doubling ! The he’ll
freeze! Send another man out to
make him run. That you, A.B.C. ?
.Eh, what ? Can’t get through, Harold.
No, Iddy, s’pose Jack’s down at BA,
and he’ll have the plug out. Can’t
you get Doughy either—No—l can
hear the Fuller ’phone working,
though. Oh, well, put another earth
on. Check ! check ! just look at that
man there; he’s facing BA; he’s on
RBA ; take his name ; besides Jr e hasn’t
got his great coat folded up in the
regulation manner; he should be put
under open arrest. You must have
station, discipline. Check! Oh,- —
- Reel up ! reel! for sake. Look
at those silly coming in; you’d
think they were going to a funeral;
could reel up ten miles of wire in half
the time myself. Check off the earth
pins and don’t forget the nuts. Sergt.
Doughy will be annoyed if there are
any missing.
And the. Spec’s go home after a use-
:ful day’s training.
THE SHIP’S POST OFFICE.
It would be a great mistake to
publish a “ Ships Magazine ”. and
omit to say something about the Post
Office on board. It is only a small
place so it wont take up much space
and the valuable information will be
welcomed by the public. The Officer
in charge is Bob Cooper, and it is
rumoured that he sits for his com-
mission very soon. He has a staff of
two : Jack; Babington and Hughie
Dent, who are both specialists but not
in Postal work. The Office hours are
not very long. Sixty minutes being
the longest. Of course they do a lot
of night work owing to the Office
being a splendid darkroom' for photo-
graphy. They accept letters for de-
posits but they wont allow any with-
drawals. If you ask for a stamp, it
is given to you, but on your pet corn.
Parcels are not accepted more than
one foot square owing to the Post
Office being so small; and you can’t
send a wire because the ship’s wire-
less. The closings of mails are the
only “ Postal Notes ” we see, and
they are useless for no one will
change them. There are hammock
bins placed all around the ship, but
not a sign of a pillow-box anywhere.
Mails close about once a fortnight,
but the Post Office is closed nearly
all the time. The New Zealand males
and a few (late) females will be put
ashore at the next port of call. If
the officials don’t get the sack before
then a number of mail bags will be
required. It is rumoured that the
office is a resting place for doves. We
have certainly noticed a number of
pigeon holes inside.
Of course all that has been said
Has been said to make you laugh
For we are all good cobbers with
The Postmaster and his staff.
Once upon a time un a fine sum-
mer’s day, as they say in the story
books, I set out with a friend on a
walking tour. After some hours feel-
ing tired we lay down by a little
brook for a short respite. We soon
fell asleep and I dreamt a peculiar
dream. I dreamt I made a journey
up to heaven and on reaching the
gates politely knocked. Peter asked,
“ Who’s there,” and on my replying
asked, “ Where do you come from.”
I said, “ Wellington,” and was sur-
prised when he told me I was the
first person from that place to get so
near to heaven. I applied for admis-
sion but my qualifications would not
suffice. However he promised that I
should be admitted provided I filled
a lamp which he handed me. I found
a supply of oil but nothing where-
with to fill the lamp so remembering
the schoolbook story of the crow and
the pitcher set to work diligently to
perform my allotted task by dipping
my finger in the oil and then dropping
it into the lamp. IR was a most
tedious process but I was making
some headway when my dream was
interrupted by a blow which made
head buzzy. I awoke to hear my mate
uttering a String of unmentionable
oaths and then I discovered that I
had been dipping my finger in the
stream and dropping the water into
my mate’s ear.
We are informed by the Censor
that a soldier aboard the Transport,
writing to his mother, said : “ Dear
mother, the walls of my cabin are
so thin that I can hear the man in
the next cabin change his mind.”

rung,
With many praises left unsung;
But remember this, we’re going to do
Duty to God, our country and you.

Officer : What sort of soap did you
use this morning, Jones ?
Pte. Jones, hesitatingly ; Sunlight,
sir.
Officer : Not on your lifebuoy (life
boy).


Limericks,
THE 43 RD SIGNALLERS,
Lieut. Walshe is the genial 0.C.,
And a better man there couldn’t be.
He tries his best whilst we’re . at sea
To study the wants of his Company.
Davis and Webb are our Sergeants
■ two..- . -
To better the pair would be hard to
, do. , ,
Next come the Corporals, the boys
who seldom frown,
There’s Whiskery McKie, Richardson
and Treglown.
Then next the Lance-jacks of whom
there are four,,
There’s Cousins and Dent and Wat-
son and Moore,
The Orderly Room Clerk, whose
name is Small,
Eats a great deal but is not very tali.
Now the privates whose names will
not be forgotten,
There’s Wenzlick, McEachen and old
Fred Bottom
Then there’s Bryant and Ross who
are known very well,
To say nothing of Thompson and
big Lofty Dell.
There’s Phil Lennon, the batman,
who can polish things bright.
And Wilson and Malloch who disturb
you at night.
There is Singleton and Leadbeater
both cunning and bold.
And the same could be said about
Daisy Arnold.
There’s Hannah and Heyward quite
flash when in town,
As well as Bob Graham and old Bus-
ter sßrown.
There’s Hedges and Crossman, hot
stuff on the flags,
And Chaney and Mangin, two very
good “ Wags.”
Sheehan and Babington are all that
remain
Of those who may signal “ Victory ”
again.
Gunner Small our Orderly Room
; Clerk,
Is a little man, but he eats like a
■ shark.
He’s been trying for a month a few
hairs to grow,
So we encourage him by saying,
“Wait half a c mom’ ”
A good man at quoits is Sergt.-Major
Kenny,
He throws all day without, missiu ;
any. .
Another good , man is big Freddy
. Potton,
Give him the rings and he’ll put the
■ whole lot on.
CPL. J. R. RICHARDSON.
To put into print all wants at sea.
Which happened aboard the old
“ R —e.” v
To take up his duties of Editorship,
Sergt, Webb has given flag-wagging
the slip.
Who made the donkey buck ? Gin-
ger.!. T ■ ,
But we now give that the go-bye,
For a more modern and up-to-date
question is,
Who blackened “ Ginger Butt’s ”
■ eye?
“ There’s many a slip s twixt cup and
lip.” *
This saying is known to the Corps.
And what we’d like to know just now
, t S 3
Who “'Laid Law” -Rusty on the
jaw?
Aboard the old Hooker we’ve Freddie
Ford,
But no relation to the “ Tin Liz”
Lord.
’Cause he gives us corns on the end
of our spine,
While our Sergt. Ford prepares men
for the “ Rhine.”
Another member of the Pop-gun
game,
Is Sergt. Smith of violin fame;
Who after dinner each day and night,
Plays us his preludes, midst a pillow
"fight.
He was in the artillery, but has for-
saken that pack,
And is now known as Paymaster
Jack.
Who, when nearing port, appears sil-
ver in hand,
And is then it appears, very much in
demand.
There’s a man on board who thinks
he’s much sharper,
And goes by the name of old Sani-
tary Harper.
At inspection time he will always be
found
Following the Colonel and Commo-
dore round.
At the mess-room table in the Second
Saloon,
There’s Q.M.S. Aitcheson who thinks
he’s a boon,
But the opinion you hear that is borne
by his fellows.
Is that he’s more like a pair of well-
oiled bellows.
What’s yours is mine, what’s mine is
my own,
Is the motto of hungry Jack Kenny ;
When it comes to a case of apples, I
know,
He does not appear to be “ canny.”
“ Its rotten to be on a ship at sea,
When it makes a soldier feel dilly,
And sea-sickness is always what hap-
■; • - pens., to,. me
Three weeks, out,”' says a. Sergeant
called Tilly,
The men in the cabin forty-two ,
They get no sleep the whole night
through,
For Davis, Ha ! ■ Ha! -Ho ! Ho ! Ho;
Is as disturbing as a nigger on an
old banjo.
DAWS AND MACK.
THE CENSOR.
The Censor is a peculiar man,
He cuts up our letters as much as he
can;
And his victims wonder through most
of the night
If even their signatures get home
right. :
And why do they cut up our letters
so ?
It’s lest they should know that we
know that they know.
But when at length we reach any
ports,
To the Post Office then he straight-
way resorts,
Ami lets his friends at home all know,
Without a thought for the watchful
foe,
Lots of things they shouldn’t know -
At least, so popular rumours go.
CENSORED.
FOR THE TROPICS.
Eve picked fresh costumes every day,.
And changed them twice or maybe,
thrice,
Yet Adam had no bills to pay.
Can we do that on a shilling a day 2 ;
H.L.
OUR “ PROVOST SERGEANT.”
Our “ Provost,” the sceptical beau,,
Who dresses as none of his kin do,
In picturesque demnins and leggins,
Is worshipped in decks nearer heaven_
While all the Boys swear by “ Hause”’
And many of the games about
His plots for captures are hazy,
For the Police are damnably lazy.
He reminds me of “ Sherlock
Holmes ”
And mysteries of things such as
bones,
As a detective this man would shame
us,
But our “ Provost ” is unbearably
famous.
H.L.
Wanted Known,— : That the ship’s
barber is selling articles at a very low
price. A razor which was recently
valued at two shillings and sixpence is
now worth half a-crown.


PARADISE.
There’s a spot, oh ! so small,
Named the “ Hole in the Wall ”
Before which Mac did fall,
At our first port of call.
Then our Corporal so; fair,
To a spot did repair,
With the girl from
“ The Hole in the Wall.;’
He found her sublime,
Forgot all about time,
Would have been a crime
Had the train gone at nine.
K.
There is a young fellow, the son of
old Mat;
He is not very thin, but inclined to
be fat,
And he’s mostly considered a bit of
an ass,
As he’s always admiring himself in
the glass.
His cabin’s a litter of powder and
scents, -
And the room they take up the Cap-
tain resents.
If anyone thinks that this is not true,
Just pay a short visit to joint 22.
We’ve got an O.C. called Sinel,
Who is fast going downward to—well,
At our first port of call
He rode for a fall,
And now there’s a story to tell.
Soldier at the Front, writing to a
lady who has sent him a patriotic gift
parcel :
I’ve received your socks; they’re a
very fine fit;
I’m using one as a helmet and one as
a mit.
Glad to hear you are doing your bit,
But who the h—ll said you could knit ?
There’s on board an ambitious young
Quarter,
Who journeys with us o’er the water,
But the Infantile Swank
Of this misguided Crank
An appropriate name, we confess,
Will earn him a punch—so it oughter.
There was a young fellow called
Flower;
His language it did not lack power ;
His yarns they were spicy,
But hardly quite cc nicee,”
In fact they were near sour.
Domfield.
Is held by the boss of the mess.
For more issues of duff,
Q.M. Caterer’s sure to say “ Yes ”
If we clamour enough
(perhaps !)
Quips.
We are out upon the seas,
We have left our homes of ease—
Tho’ we mustn’t dare to tell our
destination.
But the soft seductive motion
Of the South Pacific Ocean
Has upset the equilibrium on occasion.
From the Briton brave and bold,
Who did rove the main of old,
Is descended now a seaman of per-
fection ;
Who, as five bells smite the morn,
To the sound of winding horn,
Austerely marches forth on hisy in-
spection.
From the languid leg of mutton
To the shy, retiring button
On the jacket of some poor delin-
quent steward
Gleams the all-revealing torch;
And a look that seems to scorch,
Seizes hard upon a lamp obscured to
leeward.
On this royal perambulation.
The elusive ventilation
Of the residences aft is sure to cop it;
For the adjectival port
Which is screwed down when it
ought
To be open, makes the atmosphere like
Tophet.
Sharp at seven bells “ ack emma 55
We sit down to a—dilemma ;
As apostrophised by some— u our
morning hate.”
And by time that we are through,
With our emaciated stew
We’re entitled to some thanks, at any
rate.
Idly swinging in our beds,
Clamorously above our heads
Sounds the playful prattle of our
nursing sisters;
Sometimes heatedly debating,
■> Sometimes coldly dissertating
On the rival claims of tennis, quoits,
or—misters.
And amid the other joys
That exhilarate the boys
Are “ les classes Francaises,’ con-
ducted by the parson;
With' his “ Apies vous, M’sieu,”
And u Voyez-vous I’ocean, par-
bleu S” •
And his list of dainties handled by
. cc le gar yon.”
Sleeping, eating, shewing, drink-
ing—
Varied bursts of painful thinking—
Help to tally oft the seeming ' endless
days.
And the burden of our song
As we heave our way along,
Is to whether Crown and Anchor
really pays ! !
It is common talk on board that if
the boat gets held up outside a port
of call for any length of time, the
majority of us are going to take a
cab in (cabin).
Specs.
Ev ery one knows the word savours
of something BAD or nearly so.
Therefore Specs :
1. Thou shalt (before embarkation)

Kissed Oxey good-bye.
Gave Reesby glad eyes.

But it would be hard to discover a
more mixed-up lot
Than those who did dwell m the
above-mentioned spot.
B.S.M. Smith lead the boys of the

And hard was the bite if anyone did
point;
But, all said and done, Smithy was

And often he’s joined us and won

And in his own quiet way a veritable

But one morning in June —gargle for-
gotten,
Master ton leave stopped—“ That’s a
bit rotten,”

Was a quiet regard for a wee Auck-

A devil to argue, and if he said must,
We knew it was goosed, and gave up
in disguest.
Another of the throng—Albert Charles
Wonnocott,
Wherever there’s dirt, he’s right in
the plot;
A jersey, however, we remember it
still,
Brought a few hours of dandy pack
drill.
Then there was one whose surname
was Pain,
He’s been to Somoa, now he’s off
once again;
His failing was Masterton, and on
Wednesdays he’d grin
When adjusting his “pretties” to
see his best “ Jin.”
And who hasn’t heard of the infamous
“ Blanch,”
Who, a short time ago, ran a Cali-
fornian ranch,
And still looks for the chap who while:
he did sleep
Cut half of his hair off—poor Blanch
he did weep.
this gives an idea of some of the

Who assisted in making the great
Forty-thirds,
But none will forget wherever they go
The grand times they did spend in

THE RXJAHIXEAX REVIEW.


Concerts.
Among some of the few pleasures that
.are to be partaken of amidst our pre-
sent surroundings are a series of con-
certs, capably arranged by an energetic
Amusement Committee. The first of
the series took place in the 2nd Saloon
on , under perhaps rather
bad weather conditions, but was un-
doubtedly a success, considering the ad-
verse circumstances,, not the least of
which was the natural inclination of
many artists to hang back and see what
was doing. Every item was received
with great enthusiasm, and encores were
frequent.
The second of the series, held on
, was an open-air concert
on No. 4 Hatch, and was the scene of
ja, very cheerful and bright gathering.
The weather being perfect, everyone
looked their best, and ’twas hard to
.realise' as one looked through a veritable
sea of faces that they were not on a
pleasure jaunt.
No one seemed to have any concern
for what lay beyond; make the most of
to-day, and to H—l with to-morrow,
Aeemed to be the universal motto. Dis-
regard of the unknown future is always
conducive to a general happy feeling,
and this, combined with the quality oi
the talent that was forthcoming, ren-
dered the concert a pronounced success.
The third of the series of concerts,
held in the 2nd Saloon on the evening
of September 14, was equally successful.
Tn spite of oppressive heat, the items
were well received, and the high
standard of previous efforts was main-
tained. The following is a. list of con-
tributions to a very successful enter-
tainment.
Once again we have to report that
owing to the untiring efforts of the
Concert Committee another successful
open-air entertainment took place on
the forward hatch at 8 p.m. on Sep-
tember 17. Under the moonlight’s sil-
very gleam the fallowing items were
received with enthusiasm, frequent en-
cores from various contributors being
quite in evidence :

To the Editor.
Sir, —Can you explain to the Ser-
geants’ Junior Table (The Silly Asses)
why certain members of the Mess,
seven in all, in fact a carlo-ad, saw
green spots on the ocean for three
days after leave at the last port of
call?
CURIOUS.
Re THE SHIP’S POST OFFICE.
To the Editor.
Sir, —I respectfully draw your at-
tention to the unsatisfactory state of
affairs existing in the ship’s Post
Office. Inattention and incivility on
the part of the staff is most marked,
and inquiries re the delay on the in-
ward mail elicit the reply from the
Postmaster that ‘‘there is a slip on
the line.” Communication with N.Z.
by wireless has not yet been estab-
lished. The P.M. informs us that
the lines are down and that the line-
man has gone to the war.
The Stamp Dept, is “non est,”
The Pensions Dept, refuses to pay.
The Savings Bank is broke (the P.M.
was noticed spending money freely
in our first port, and entertaining his
friends to ‘‘joy” rides). The P.M.
wears a “smoked Irishman’s” hat,
not in keeping with his position.
Owing to long hours worked he re-
fuses to leave his bed till 9 a.m.
The first assistant L/c D is
continually ‘ ‘ snapping ’ ’ the public,
and appears to be always on pleasure
“bent.” On emergency he cannot
be found. His bunk is always
empty; they say he sleeps in the
crow’s nest. We are not certain.
In conclusion, I also wish to point
out the dirty and disgraceful state of
the office counter presumably
through the hardest part of the day’s
work —morning and afternoon teas.
(This probably explains numerous
missing parcels of cakes, etc.). Trust-
ing the public will awaken to this
astounding state of affairs. —I am,
etc.,

The Toast of the New Zea-
land Boys at the Front.
Boys! Here’s to the land of the Moa
and Maori,
Of the isles of the blue southern
ocean—-the Queen,
Where the fair nikau palm and the
tall stately Kauri
Grow regal in woods ever mantled
in green.
Where the dear Motherland gives her
children—for dowry,
The freedom we prize in the land of
the Maori.
Where women are fair and men bold
and fearless
(Let France and Gallipoli tell their
proud story).
Where the mountains and lakes and
the geysers are peerless,
In beauty, in majesty, grandeur and
glory.
Where the groves and the meadows
are fragrant and flowery.
Boys! Here’s to the land of the Moa
and Maori.
Ist Saloon Steward (flabbergasted
because he has just received a sub-
stantial tip) : What will you have,
sir, steak or meat ?
“Steak.”
Some people say that with good teeth
We can ’most anything break,
But I am sure' ’tis not the case
We can’t get through that steak.
The old cow steak for breakfast served
Napoleon had it too,
So you can gues just what it’s like,
You simply can’t get through.
We bend our forks, we crack the plate *
Our knives we always break,
And though we try from morn till
night,
We no impression make.
As last resort we take an axe,
And with it try to sever
That awful steak—with hefty smacks,
But can we do it? Never !
We swing the axe and chip the edge,
At last we get . a saw,
Which also won’t go through that
meat,
In future we eat it raw.
"THE GRUMBLERS."
Ist Tommy : Why do they call these
flying birds aeronauts ?.
2nd Tommy : ’Spose it ’s because
when they’re up yon don’t know whe-
ther they’re in the air-or-not.

Engineers (Campbell),
SWINGING THE MONKEY.
The representatives of the different
Companies, were as follows:
Dawson, R.F.C. ; Chapman, N.Z.E.;.
Roberts, N.Z.L ; Rurohin, Pioneers;
’ Sergt. Flemming, N.Z.F.A. ; Mitchell,
Specs. ' •
Results: jßurohin, 1; Sergt. Flemming,
2; Dawson, 3.
Shortly after starting the Engineers’
representative (pulled out
This „ event caused a considerable
amount of amusement, and some of thb
balancing was exceptionally good, espe-
cially that of Sergt. Flemming; but
Rurohin proved too much for him.
Much credit is due to Rurohin, as he
kept both feet iin the loop all the time,
and relied on hand balancing, whereas
Sergt, Flemming’s, balancing was done
by taking one leg out of the loop,
Dawson also put up a very creditable
performance.
PILLOW-FIGHTING ON SPAR.
This event was post entry, and was
eventually won by Pte. Whitcliffe, out
of 36 entries.
A very .- stiff contest between Hisloip
and Wilson finished up with the toss
Qf the coin, and Wilson was the lucky
man.
The final between. Wilson and Whit-
cliffe was both interesting and amusing.
Wilson had a big advantage in weight,
but the Maori seemed to put more sting
into the pillow, and very soon had his
man off the balance,.
COCK FIGHTING (SEMI-FINAL).
J. Austin, R F.C.
O’Connor, Specs.
Quarter-hour contest, no decision.
Second attempt, no decision.
Combatants decided to toss up the
and the luck fell to O’Connor;
Austin’s luck was out from the start.

Sports.
LAZY STICK. '
This competition was entered into
very heartily, each company being re-
presented.
The winner, Pte. Johnston, N.Z.F. A.,
seemed to have everything his own
way, but Hamer ell, N.Z.E., who 7 was
runner-up, put up a. very creditable per-
formance considering weights.
The first to start were the Flying
Corps and the Artillery, which the* Ar-
tillery won, but, owing to some mistake
being / made, re having three pulls or
one, it was decided to let them pull
again, with the same result. '
TUG-OF-WAR.,
This event caused a lot of excitement,
and the entries were as follows:
Infantry: Two teams (1 and 2).
Engineers: One team.
Medical Corps: One team.
Flying Corps: One team.
Artillery: One team.
Pioneers: Two teams (1 and 2).
Officers: One team.
Specialists: One team.
The second pull was between the In-
fantry _ (1) and the Engineers, which re-
sulted in. a draw after a pull of 3 min.
The next pull was between the ■'Medi-
cal Corps and the. .Pioneers (1), but
weight told, and the Medical Corps were
beaten by 8 inches after 3 min. pull.
Specialists and Officers were the next
to meet, the Officers losing after a
very pull of 3 minutes by 6
inches. I think the Officers would have
done very much better had they taken
their boots and socks off like their op-
ponents. Next the Infantry (2) and the
Pioneers (2) met, with the result that
Pioneers won by a small margin. The
Infantry (1) and the Engineers met the
second time to decide the draw, and the
laurels fell to the Infantry (1) by the
small margin of 2 inches.
The second round started between the
Pioneers (2) and the Specialists, the win
going s to the Specialists. Artillery and
the Pioneers (1) then handled the rope,
resulting in an easy win for the Pioneers
(1). The next contest between the Ist
Infantry and the Specialists proved the
most even contest of the lot, both sides
see-sawing over the mark about an inch,
and when-time was called there was no
advantage on - either side. Result:
draw.
The same teams changed over sides
of rope, and after, another severe pull,
extending over the time (3 minutes), the
Specialists won by the small margin of
an inch. I think there was a slight ad-
vantage gained by a team being lucky
enough, to get the outside rope, as the
first pull always seemed to go that way.
Evidently a slight, downhill pull.
The final pull between the Specialists
and the Pioneers (1) teams will be con-
: tested on the first fine day after leaving
the next port, and should cause a. good
deal of excitement.
Much credit is due to the for
the manner in which he ran and handled
all the sports of the day.
FOOTBALL.
A football match was played at our
.second port of call between the Boys’
High School fifteen and a team from
the ship, and resulted in a draw; 3
Points (a try) each; our try being
scored by Lieut. Moore.
As might be expected, the College
boys were in fine fettle, and consider-
ing that our own boys had had
•several weeks on the water, and had
never played together before, they
put up a. very creditable performance.
If the standard set by the College
be . any criterion, then the game of
Rugby has. a good hold in those parts,
and we are indeed gratified that it
should be so.
. After the match our team. wa.s
kindly entertained to afternoon tea
by the Headmaster lof the College.
The ship’s team comprised : Sapper
-Ryan/ (N.Z.E.), Gunners Bolton and'
■Golvsn; (N.Z.F.A.), -Cadet Matson
. (R.A.F.), Q.M.S. Button and Gnr.
Lamplough (N.Z.F.A.), • Sgt. Webb

G. Wilson (43rd Specs.), Sapper Moy-
(N.Z.E.) and Cpl. Shepherd

Under the auspices of the Sports
Committee a series of Boxing Tourna-
ments took place on September 17 on
the forward deck under favourable
weather conditions. In the opinion of
our reporter the display was not of a
very high standard, science in a num-
ber of bouts being conspicuous by its
absence. The following competitors
provided the amusement for the large
crowd of onlookers:
Heavy Weight.—Gorpl. Widderstrom
(Artillery), 12 st. • Pte. Taura (Pioneers),
14 st. An unevenly matched contest,
1 aura being declared winner, over-
tor Wermg Weight being the deciding fac-
. Welter Weight.—Pte. Henderson (In-
fantry), 11 st. 5 lb. ; Bombr. Woodward
(Artillery), 11 st, A fair display. Hen-
derson winning on scientific points.
Middle Weight.— P. Buchanan, B.
Hughes. A good example of hard hit-
ting Hughes succeeding in placing
knock-out in the first round after one
minute, dislocation of his thumb being
the result; ■ ■

Semi-Final, Welter Weight.—H. Tap-
Mi (Pioneers), 11 st. ; Pte. Wilson
(Specials), 11 st. 12 lb. Tapsell declared
wanner after a well-matched fight.
A fairly general opinion was current
that Wilson should have been declared
winner, but it must be borne in mind
that the judges were in a better posi-
tion to decide, and we understand the
decision was practically unanimous.
Owing to the inability of various com-
petitors to come to scratch the finals of
middle weight and welter weight were
postponed for a few' days.
PATRIOTIC GIFTS. ‘

gotten by the “ watching and waiting
