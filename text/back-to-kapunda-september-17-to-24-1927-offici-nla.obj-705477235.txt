Beautiful Kapunda.
Fair Kapunda, roamed of yore
By dusky sons and daughters,
Named by them in native lore
“The meeting place of waters.”
Now where nomad natives strayed,
’Midst nature’s floribunda,
Stand the homes our fathers made,
Our beautiful Kapunda.
Primal settlers trailing flocks,
Through the scrub and tangled vine,
In the rich outcropping rocks,
Found the famed Kapunda Mine.
Soon the wilderness was changed,
Homes went up as shafts went down,
And where once the wild man ranged,
Britain’s sons had built a town.
There on gentle slopes it rests,
East and west, a vale between,
Verdant, beautifully drest,
In rich garb of living green.
Many sons and daughters fair,
To Kapunda bring renown;
Many still are striving there
To improve their lov’d home-town.
Health and wealth still there abound,
Industries replace the mine,
Living gold from over ground,
Ripens in the bright sunshine.
So Kapunda is en fete
To welcome friends returning;
Hoist the flags with hearts elate,
We’ve kept the home hres burning.

A Foreword.
The Committee of the Back to Kapunda Movement extend a
very cordial welcome to the visitors on this auspicious occasion.
To many this visit will revive old and sacred memories, and also
give an opportunity for the reunion of friends and acquaintances
of long ago. We hope your stay with us will be a very happy
one, and we will do our best to make it so. Kapunda, as one
of the oldest provincial towns in the State, has a history of quali-
fied status and importance, and is also the birthplace of a large
number of men and women of prominence and ability, who to-day
are filling important positions in various parts of the Common-
wealth.
We trust that “Back to Kapunda” will afford an opportunity
for the renewal of old friendships, and also an opportunity for
the sons and daughters of the old pioneers to review and recall
the homes and family /life and associations of years gone by.
The present residents of Kapunda extend greetings and a warm
welcome to all.

THE KAPUNDA MINE.
The Kapunda Mine was discovered in the year 1842. The
first discovery of the ore was by the youngest son of Captain
Bagot. Mr. H. Dutton, one of the founders, states: —“Shortly
afterwards, not far from the same spot, I ascended to the top
of a small hill to view the surrounding country. One of our
flocks of sheep had been dispersed during a thunderstorm, and I
had been out nearly the whole day in drenching rain searching
for them. At the place where I pulled up my horse there was
a protruding mass of what appeared to be at first glance slate
grey rock, but on examination 1 got the impression that the rock
was covered with a beautiful green moss. After breaking off a
piece 1 found that it was green carbonate of copper. To my
neighbour, Captain Bagot, I confided my discovery; the place
was on his sheep run. He also produced a similar specimen
found by his son. The discovery was kept secret. We applied
to the Government for a survey of 80 acres of land and became the
purchasers of same at the upset price of one pound per acre.
At this time a few Cornish miners were quietly following other
pursuits, but on hearing of the discovery they quickly resumed
their mining tools and commenced to raise ore on the tribute
system. At 3/6 in the pound they did very well, and in this way
a quantity of rich ore was available for sale. The place at that
time was a complete wilderness, the nearest water being half-a-
mile distant, and brackish. We soon succeeded in finding a good
spring, and then erected a row of stone cottages for the miners
and workmen, which were much needed. The mine was between
40 and 50 miles from Port Adelaide, and there was not a track
of any kind between the places. Captain Bagot undertook to
select and mark out a line. This he did by fastening a plough
behind the first dray and striking a furrow for succeeding drays
to follow. This line was adopted and for a long time used until
more suitable roads were constructed.”
In the year 1845 Mr. Dutton sold his one-fourth interest in
the mine and subsequently Captain Bagot parted with the re-
mainder to an English company. The company entered into de-
velopment work at once, and soon erected the necessary mining
plant for the more effective working of the mine. It was found
that the deposit was a very rich one, comprised of blue and green
carbonates, yellow sulphides, and black oxide of copper ranging
in quality from 19 to 50 per cent, of the pure metal. At one
time in the mine’s history the output was so great that the com-
pany erected smelting works on the mine property, and by so
doing concentrated to regulus and fine copper the raw ore raised.
This considerably reduced the cost of transit to the seaboard at
Port Adelaide.
Copper to the value of £1,000,000 sterling was raised from the
Kapunda mine between the years 1845 and 1877. At the end
of 1877 the low price of copper and an excessive influx of water
into the main workings led to the termination of operations by
the mining company.
The ivapunda mine has been worked in a general way to a
depth of 70 fathoms, and at one shaft (Harris’) to a further depth
of 10 fathoms. At this point a crosscut was driven eastward to
intersect well-known lodes which on higher levels were composed
of high grade yellow sulphides. When the crosscut had reached
the vicinity of what is known as Hart’s lode, there was an inrush
of water which completely overwhelmed the capacity of the water
lifting appliances, and work had to be abandoned, with the
result that nothing more was done from that time up to the
present.
There is every reason to believe that at the 80 fathom level
(Harris’ shaft) there is a large deposit of payable ore; first,
because lodes are recognised as water conductors in the develop-
ment of mines; and secondly, because there is a strong lode of
high grade at the bottom of the 70 fathom level, and tending
downward.
Since the cessation of operations by the mining company,
copper to the value of several thousands of pounds has been
raised by tributers from the Kapunda Mine property. The rising,
however, of the subterranean water and the limitation of suitable
machinery largely blocks any further work of a payable nature
under the tribute system,


THE KAPUNDA COPPER MINE
IN 1845.


THE KAPUNDA MINE IN 1877


PROGRESS OF THE TOWN OF KAPUNDA.
Following hard upon the opening of the Kapunda Mines, the
town quickly grew to be the chief country town in the Stale.
Townships were surveyed, homes and business premises erected, and
the hitherto peaceful countryside became a scene of industry and
progress, and for many years the ore won from the Kapunda
Mine was the means of ensuring the establishment of South Aus-
tralia in the early days of its colonization.
Until the year 1877 Kapunda was the rail-head from the
seaboard, and all carting further north and east was done by the
bullock teams. About 50 years ago Kapunda had probably
reached the highest peak in her march of progress. At that time
the hospital, churches, banks, and other important public build-
ings had been erected. At that time, too, the future of the out-
back country was assured, and Kapunda ceased to be the rail
head, the railway being carried on to Morgan. Other industries,
however, kept the town busy.
The opening and development of the agricultural lands called
for agricultural implements and machinery, which in a large
measure were manufactured locally. The wool industry also grew
to one of importance. Other industries which have assisted in the
progress of the town and district would include the marble
quarries and the phosphate rock deposits.
For many years Kapunda has been the headquarters of Sir
Sidney Kidman’s operations, and the horse sales condrcted by
him at Kapunda for many years were the largest horse sales held
in Australia, and attracted buyers from all over the world.
Kapunda is still the centre of activities for the district, for
three large and important firms of stock agents, and the fact that
these and the branches of three trading banks and two savings
banks are operating in the town speaks for itself of the present
business stability of Kapunda,
The mines, the marble quarries, and the horses are gone—
at least, for the present. In these avenues of developmnt Ka-
punda lives on its past. It is, however, a past to be proud of.
The mines were virtually the saviour of the colonization efforts in
South Australia. The marble from Kapunda stands as a lasting
memorial in our Parliament House. The horse sales were records
in the days when horseflesh had not been supplanted by motor
power. The other developments—the more stable industries—
survive. The wheat and wool still make their annual appearance
and in increased volume. Stock raising is a side line on every
farm, and dairy produce is produced in large quantities.
Other towns in the rush of development may have left
Kapunda behind, much in the same state as she was fifty years
ago, but as the centre of a safe district her future is assured.
The health of the town and district is almost a record, there
hems' so few epidemics in proportion to its population. This no
doubt results from the open manner in which the town has grown,
nearly every householder having his half acre or acre of land.
During recent years many additional conveniences have been
given the residents, the most important would be the replacing of
the old gas lamps by the electric light, and the substitution of
the Warren water for that from the old reservoir at Taylor’s Gap.
Situated picturesquely only about two hours’ run by car from
the city, with its large and beautiful park and tree-lined roadways,
Kapunda makes an ideal holiday resort.
The children born and reared in Kapunda have scattered far
and wide, but to all, no doubt their old town holds very dear
memories, and they, like we, who still remain here, are proud of
her history and achievements.

The Kapunda Corporation was brought into being on the
thirteenth of July, 1865, by the following proclamation by His
Excellency the Governor, Sir Dominick Daly, Knight.

DR. M. H S. BLOOD,
Kapunda’s First Mayor.
Dr. M. H. S. Blood, J.P., arrived in Kapunda about the yeaf
1854. He held the position of medical attendant to the miners,
and also had a private practice. He was prominent in all public
functions of the new town, and assisted in starting many Societies,
among them being the Masonic Lodge of Light under the Irish
Constitution. He exerted his influence to make Kapunda a Cor-
poration, and rendered all the assistance to other residents who
were working to that end, and he became the first Mayor on the
formation of the Corporation on the 13th July, 1865. He spent
many years of usefulness in the new town, and was again elected
Mayor in the year 1877 and 1878.


MR. WILLIAM BREWER,
Kapunda’s First Town Clerk.
Mr. William Brewer was appointed Town Clerk when the
Corporation was formed in 1865. During his term of office most
of the construction work, such as forming roads, Water tables,
and footpaths, making of culverts, crossings, etc., was carried out,
and although the Government subsidy was then much larger than
it is at present, the Corporation had to raise a loan. Owing to
failing health Mr. Brewer tendered his resignation to take effect
on the 31st December, 1877, and by an extraordinary circum-
stance his death occurred on the 31st December, 1877,

District Council of Kapunda.
, The District Council was gazetted on July 5, 1866, and held
its first meeting on July 30 of that year at the residence of Mr.
1. Duell, about a mile north of the township. The property is
now owned by Mr. D. C. Murray. The Council consisted of four
members—Messrs. W. Oldham, John Ford, James Stokes, and
ihomas Duell. Mr. Duell, was the first Chairman. Mr. William
Brewer was appointed as the first clerk at a salary of £l5O a
year. Applications were Called for a ranger, and Mr. James
Hind was appointed at £4B a year. After the Council had been
formed and officers appointed, work was begun, but not on a very
lavish scale. , The first month’s pay-sheet totalled £27, and the
second month s £7 7/-. J he Government was approached for an
advance, and £l7O was granted. Later on £5OO was advanced in
anticipation of the year’s rates. Tenders were called for an
assessor, and Mr. John Row secured the appointment at £37. The
amount of the first assessment was £11,067, which brought in
$527 as rates. The present assessment is £15,407, and rate?
amount to £1,155. The Council was divided into wards in
June, 1867. The present area of the district is 67,840 acr6s, and
the population about 1,100. There are from 25 to 30 miles of
main roads, and 300 miles of district roads under their control
at present. Meetings of the first Council were held monthly at
the old Morning Star Hotel, and at the Wheatsheaf Inn, at Allan-
dale North, also in the old schoolrooms at Allandale. Later they
were held at Mrs. P. Harvey’s house, on Clare Road, and event-
ually an office was secured in the town. At present the Council
occupies up-to-date offices in the main street. The first bridge
constructed in the district was Orchard’s, on the Bethel Road,
and the tenders for that work ranged from £lOO to £lBO, and that
of Messrs. Fry Bros., at £l2O, was accepted. The first auditors
were Messrs. Wm. Lewis and Thos. Fotheringham. The present
Chairman (Mr. Samuel March) has held that position since 1918,
gnd the present Clerk (Mr. J. Healy) was appointed in 19gJ,

THE KAPUNDA HOSPITAL.
In 1875 the need of a hospital being much felt, a number of
gentlemen subscribed liberally and formed a committee for the
purpose of providing such an institution. Messrs. A. Thomson and
Pearce communicated with the Government in an endeavour to
obtain the old Post Office as a cottage hospital, but without suc-
cess. It was then decided to build, and the present site of about
10 acres was purchased for £lOO.
In December, 1874, Mr. Jas. Elliott wrote Mr. F. H. Dutton
(the owner of Anlaby Station, then in England) asking his assist-
ance towards erecting a building. Mr. Dutton replied in March,
1875, with a donation of £2,500. Mr. H. T. Morris (as represent-
ing Mr. F. H. Dutton) and the Rev. J. M. Day called a meeting
at the Institute in May, 1875. A committee was formed with Mr.
J. Elliott and the Rev. J. M. Day, and subsequently Mr. W. H.
Rinham in place of the Rev. Day, as secretaries, and the total
subscription was raised to £8,781. The Government subsidised
£ for £up to £4,000. Mr. T. Frost was employed to prepare plans
for a building to cost about £2,000. Tenders were called, that of
Messrs. March and Jaffrey being accepted for £2,509 6/-. l'he
foundation stone was laid, with Masonic honours, on January 9th,
1877, by Mr. H. T. Morris (as representing Mr. F. H. Dutton),
in the presence, it was estimated, of over 1,000 people.
The hospital was opened for receiving patients on November
Ist, 1877. The first patient—Mr. J. Rowe, agent, of Kapunda—
wag admitted on November sth. Many improvements and addi-
tions have been made to the premises, viz.:—Verandah in 1884,
cost £450; Nurses’ cottage, 1906, £750; Electric light installed,
own plant, 1911, £322: Maternity block built, 1923, £2,500; Do-
mestic staff quarters, 1925, £l,OOO. A tender has now been ac-
cepted for the erection of an up j to-date isolation block. An
X-ray plant is about to be installed.
The whole of the hospital has been renovated and brought
up to date, and may now he considered to compare favourably with
any other such institution in the State. It is connected with the
Adelaide Electric Supply Company’s main; and electric washers,
irons, radiators, etc., have been installed^
The first members of the Board of Management were—Mr.
H. T. Morris, J.P. (chairman), Messrs. J, Varley, S.M., J. E. Elliott,
J.P., W. Oldham, W. H. Benham, A. H. Greenshields, and R.
Cameron. The medical officers were Drs. H. S. Blood, D. A,
McLachlan, and F. E. Rennie. ,
Chairmen of the Board of Management—lB77, H. T. Horris;
1878, W. Oldham; 1880, J. Elliott; 1883, Rev. J. M. Donaldson;
1887, John Small; 1895, W. H. Benham; 1899, A. Thomson; 1914,
1). James; 1924, J. H. Hitchens.
Tne services of the medical officers were given gratuitously*
the officers reserving the right to make charges for attendance on
such patients as were able to afford them. The following medical
officers have attended since—Drs. T. K. Hamilton, Pentland, E.
Hamilton, C. M. Hamilton, Bennett, E. McM. Glynn. R. V. Glynn.
Dr. J. Riddell was appointed in 1914. and still holds the position.

Messrs. H. J. Skull, L. N. Tilbrook, S. March, W. M. Shannon. H.
Hughes, and Dr. J. Riddell. Assistant medical officer, Dr. Mc-
Kenzie.
The number of patients treated at the hospital since its incep-
tion is 10,500.


THE ENTRANCE TO DUTTON PARK.


Dutton Park.
In the year 1875 the following letter was received from Mr.
F. H. Dutton, dated Florence, March, 1875: “1 shall he
happy to assist in raising a fund to acquire a piece of land in
the neighbourhood of Kapunda to be used as a public recreation
ground, towards which object I will subscribe the sum oi £500.”
It was eventually decided to purchase part of Section 1479 at £l5
per acre. A subscription list was opened, Mr. James Pearce
donating £lOO. The first Committee was appointed in May, 1877 —
Messrs. H. B. Hawke, R. Cameron, R. Brewster, W. Oldham, W.
Neil, J. Scandrett, and Dr. MacLachlan. Mr. W. Oldham was
appointed the Chairman. The matter of planting the Park with
suitable trees received the attention of the Committee. The
minutes of the meetings are very interesting, showing donations of
money, trees, etc., and offers by different townsmen to carry out
the work. It was decided to call the new grounds Dutton Park.
On the death of Mr. F. 11. Dutton the late Mr. Henry Dutton
assisted the funds of Dutton Park, and with his assistance the
Committee were enabled to build the present pavilion. Also the
entrance gate to the Park was paid for by the late Mr. Henry
Dutton. In the year 1917 a suitable Soldiers’ Memorial Garden
was suggested by the present Mr. Harry Dutton, and he offered
to donate the sum of £250 towards the scheme. This he did, and
many other friends came forward and assisted the Committee to
plant the present garden, which it is hoped to complete this year
by placing memorial tablets in memory of our fallen soldiers
at the trees, and to complete the shrine in the centre. Dutton
Park is now an attraction to the general public, and is carrying
out the wish of the late Mr. F. H. Dutton, in that it is now
a public recreation ground.

THE FALLEN SOLDIERS’ MONUMENT.


KAPUNDA AND DISTRICT FALLEN SOLDIERS’ MONUMENT.
The monument was erected in the year 1922, and dedicated
to the memory of the brave men who paid the supreme sacrifice
in connection with the World War, 1914-1919.
Three hundred and ten men enlisted for the front from the
town and district of Kapunda, and forty-five of that number gave
their lives in the interest of freedom and justice.
The monument stands in the centre of the town, and at the
junction of five streets. It is 18 feet high and has an imposing
appearance. The base is in the form of three steps, on which is
placed an ornamental column reaching to the height of 12 feet,
all composed of Australian marble. On the top of the column
there is the figure of an Australian soldier (life size) in Italian
marble. The figure is in a military mourning attitude, with head
slightly bowed and rifle reversed.

The monument stands on private property generously donated
by the executors in the estate of the late John Kearne, of Ka-
punda. At present it is held under a registered deed of trust
in the names of Samuel March, J.P. (on behalf of the District
Council of Kapunda), Henry Jas. Truscott, J.P. (on behalf of
the town of Kapunda), Alan I. Reed (on behalf of the R.S.A.
of Kapunda), and William T. Truscott and Richard H. Williams
(on behalf of the general subscribers to the mounment fund).
In addition to the noble band of men who enlisted and those
who paid the supreme sacrifice, Kapunda and District contributed
most liberally to the various patriotic funds, and approximately
£167,578 was raised. The co-operation of all sections of the com-
munity was magnificent, including the Red Cross Society, League
of Loyal Women, Church Circles, Public Schools, and Recreation
Clubs. It is noteworthy that Kapunda and District subscribed
£20,000 to the 1915 War Loan, £BO,OOO to the sixth War Loan,
and £47,000 to the seventh. Australia Day of 1915 raised £2,249,
1917 £3,500, 1918 £1,150; motor ambulances for the front £1,202,
and the Y.M.C.A. Fund from 1915 to 1919, £1,201. Sir Sidney
Kidman as a Kapunda gentleman in 1916 donated to a battle
plane £2,700, and in 1918 a similar amount. Such large sums
raised by personal contributions and special effort, together with
the workers and smaller donors, is an evidence of the practical
interest taken by Kapunda in the great war.


KAPUNDA BOWLING CLUB.
VIEW OF THE GREEN AND CLUB HOUSE.


Kapunda Bowling Club.
Probably the first game of bowls played in Kapunda was
some time during the year 1876 on a private one-rink green
owned by Mr. Andrew Thomson, Sen. It was not, however, until
13th December, 1909, that anything definite was done to form a
club. On that date a meeting, convened by Mr. C. B. O’Reilly,
supported by Mr. E. S. Bastard, decided on the formation of a
club, and an influential committee, with Mr. Murray Thomson as
president and Mr. C. B. O’Reilly as secretary, was appointed.
A good site near the centre of the town was secured, and the
new club’s affairs were taken up with spirit by the members, who
put in much good earnest work. lhe president of the S.A.
Bowlin" Association (Mr. S. J. Jacobs) officially declared tlie
green open on Ist March, 1911, in the presence of a large number
of guests.
The club, in its earlier stages, was materially assisted by the
late Dr. E. McMahon Glynn in procuring the land and by Mr.
(now Sir Sidney) Kidman, who was president for three years,
in building the club-house.
In the laying down of the green and designing and erection
of the club-house and other works Messrs. T. S. Davie and Thos.
Warner were indefatigable, the members showing their apprecia-
tion bv making them both honorary life members. The green
to-dgy is admitted to he one of the best in the State, and the
membership of tljr club averages about 50.
There have always been some good bowlers among the mem-
bers, and the representatives have always been able to give a
good account ol themscivcs in matches with the surrounding clubs
and with city teams, too. Among good performances of our
members was the winning of the single championship in the first
country carnival in 1915 by Mr. E. G. Glover, the winning of the
open rink championship of the Adelaide Bowling Club (1920)
by Messrs. A. S. Lewis. J. Riddell, H. Hughes, and It. L. Hooper,
and the winning at Easter, 1927, both of the singles and rink
championships in the country carnival, the former by Mr. C. E.
Forward and the latter by Messrs. H. A. Alehin, C. Leslie, 11.
Milde, and Dr. J. Riddell.
Ihe club has had the pleasure of entertaining among other
distinguished visitors a former Governor of the State (Sir Henry
Galway) on three occasions, the representatives of the A.B.C.
from New South Wales, and the Victorian interstate team in 1926.
To Mr. T. Crase, secretary of the 5.A.8.A., and a former
resident of Kapunda, the club is indebted for kindly assistance
and advice at all times.
The members of the executive for 1926-27 are:—Messrs. C. E.
Forward (president), J. Christie (vice-president), H. H. George,
T. Jeffs, H. Milde, W. Muirhead, J. Riddell, R. H. Williams, J,
H. Hitchens (hon. treasurer), C. Leslie (hop. secretary).

KAPUNDA’S CHURCHES.
Christ Church.
For some time, in the early days. Church of England services
were conducted in houses in Kapunda, first by Canon Coornbe, of
Gawler, and later, until 1859, by the Rev. F. P. Strickland, of
Riverton. The first portion of the church, the nave and tower,
was built in 1858, and consecrated on 28th May. Ten years
afterwards the transepts and sanctuary were added, and the
original roof of the nave raised to a uniform height. The bell
and clock were placed in the tower in 1866. The church possesses
a fine pipe organ and some good stained glass windows. In 1891
the parish hall was erected.
List of Rectors.—T. Sabine, 1859; Jasper Smyth, 1867; J. M.
Donaldson, 1872; F. W. Whitington (now Archdeacon of Hobart),
1889; G. E. Young (now Dean of Adelaide), 1891; C. S. Ilorna-
brook (lately Archdeacon of Adelaide), 1894; G. Griffiths, 1902:
H. J. Lovibond, 1908; D. Kerr, 1910; C. F. Hall, 1916; F. J. Price,

The Rector of Kapunda is also in charge of the Parish of
Hamilton, where there is a most beautiful church built and
endowed by the late Henry Dutton ,of Anlaby.
St. Rose’s Church.
St. Rose’s is the oldest Roman Catholic Church in the State.
The first section of the building was erected 65 years ago, and
was a plain edifice 40 feet long by 20 feet wide. The Rev.
Michael Ryan was the first priest, succeeded by Monsignor
Byrne, who completed the church building to its present dimen-
sions. Monsignor Williams succeeded Monsignor Byrne, and
was followed by Archdeacon Enwright. The Rev. B. S. Gurry is
the priest now in charge.
Methodist Church.
The Methodists began worship in 1847, in a small house on
the Kapunda Mine Property, the minister being the Rev. John
Harcourt, who had to travel from Gawler to Kapunda. The first
church was built in Main Street and opened on April 13, 1849.
The present church was erected in 1858, during the ministry of
the Rev. W. Brown. The parsonage was built in 1875, and
occupied by Rev. Thos. Lloyd. The lecture hall was built on the
site of the old parsonage in 1884; the foundation stone was laid
bv Mr. D. Nock.
Methodist union was consummated in 1900, when the Bible
Christian and Wesleyan Churches united. The ministers in
charge were the Rev. Jno. Watts and the Rev. Thos. McNeil.
There have been 38 ministers and assistants in the Kapunda
circuit since 1847, many of whom became the leaders of Austra-
lian Methodism. The present minister is the Rev. Gordon Rowe.
Baptist Church.
The Kapunda Baptist Church was formed in the year 1865.
The foundation stone was laid by Chas. H. Good, Esq., M.P., cm
Thursday, May 24th, 1866. The architect was James Cumming,
and the builder, James Tyrie. The first pastor was the Rev. W. A.
Claxton, who served the Church for a period of two years (1866-8).
The names of the deacons were—J. D. Gates, J. Mellor, C. Bel-
lingham. Mr. Claxton was succeeded by the Rev. J. M. Day
(1870-78). After him came the Rev. W. 0. Ashton,
who remained for a period of nine years (1876-85). The next
in order was the Rev. Matthew Morris, who removed in October,
1890; Rev. Frederick Boyling, 1890; Rev. Alfred Metters, 1893-
96; Rev. John Richard Wallbank, who removed to Western Aus-
tralia; Rev. McCulloch, Rev. James Barker, 1899-1902, removed to
N.J.W.; Rev. Henry Coombs, 1903-9; Rev. John Murray, 1909-10
(During Mr. Murray’s ministry the jubilee of the church was
celebrated in September, 1915); Rev. E. B. Turner, 1916-21; Rev.
G. W. Paice, 1922-25. The present pastor, Rev. N. R. Hill, began
his ministry in October, 1926. One of the foundation members,
Mrs. j. P. Gates, is still associated with the Church.


Congregational Church.
It was about the year 1853 that Mr. Wm. Oldham, a staunch
Congregationalist and manager of the newly-discovered copper
mines, gathered a few worshippers together in the old mine store
and conducted services regularly till the year 1858, when it was
resolved to build a church (the front portion of the present edi-
fice), and in the October of that year a fellowship of 12 members
was formed. A call given to Mr. Oldham, who was ordained
and became the first pastor. The newly-erected church was
opened for worship on November 14th, 1858. The first deacons
were appointed in February, 1859, Messrs. Wm. Lewis and Wm.
Anderson being elected. The Church having been given a start.
Mr. Oldham resigned, and in January, 1861, Rev. Morgan Wil-
liams accepted the pastorate, which he filled till 1874. During
tms pastorate a cause was started at Alma and a Church founded
and building erected at Bagot’s Well. In June, 1874, the Rev.
Wm. Hopkin, of Maryborough, became pastor and served the
Church till 1876. In May, 1876, Mr. B. Fernie accepted a call
to the pastorate, was ordained, and continued in the service of
the Church till his death in 1885. In April of that year Mr. J. W.
Platt, 8.A., entered on his ministry, and success followed upon
his efforts. Subsequent to his resignation, in 1888, the Rev. A. G.
Fry accepted a unanimous call to the Church, commencing his
quarter of a century pastorate in February, 1889, and continuing
until his resignation in 1914. During his term as pastor the
jubilee of the Church was celebrated, in October, 1908, and a
long-awaited school hall built and opened in 1912. The pulpit
since then has been filled by the Revs. N. C. Goss, 1915-18: A.
Woolford (a few months in 1918) ; G. Muller. 1918-23; and A.
W. Rowland, the present pastor, from April, 1924.
Prominent workers, etc., in the dmconnfe, include Messrs.
Wm. Lewis, Wm. Anderson, David Will. John Small, Robert
Cameron, Alf. Palmer, Wm. Thomas, J. N. Smith, John Packer,
J. K. Shannon, A. $. Le\yis, E. G. Cloyer, anti R. C. McKnight,
Evangelical Lutheran Trinity Church.
In January 1907, several members of the Evangelical Lutheran
Synod of Australia formed the Trinity congregation at Kapunda,
under the pastorate of the Rev. J. E. Hansen. In the same year
land was bougnt on South Terrace on which a substantial church
was built. From 1909-17 a church-school was held in the vestry.
In 1915 the congregation linked up with the Gawler Parish, the
Rev. C. A. Wiebusch from 1916-25 being in charge. In July,
1925, this Church, with Allan’s Creek Church, formed a new
parish, which has since August, 1925, been under the pastorate
of the Rev. E. Fischer. The Church adheres strictly to all ortho-
dox Biblical doctrines and practices. The Church property is
free from debt. Services in English are held every Sunday even-
ing. On Saturdays the pastor imparts confirmation lessons, and
four teachers conduct a well-attended Sunday school.
The Evangelical Lutheran Church of St. Pauli.
A branch of this Church was instituted at Kapunda in the
year 1907. The Rev. R. J. Stolz, of Light’s Pass, was the first
minister, and for three years the Church was under his ministry
and supervision. In 1910 the Rev. T. I iebart, of Tanunda, took
charge, and since that date has been the officiating pastor.
The Salvation Army.
This branch began operations 44 years ago under the leader-
shin of Captain Upton. Through misunderstanding its earlier
period was fraught with opposition. However, that spirit of in-
domitable earnestness which has characterised the Army through-
out, so changed the atmosphere of public opinion that its bene-
ficent service and spiritual influence are both recognised and
appreciated by all classes of the community.
Among its officers who have commanded the corps are:—
Adjutant John Gore, Colonels Sharp and Blake, Brigadiers Ward
and Carmichael, Major Sawkins and Commandants Meade, Pear-
son, Loane. Stewart, and Day. The present officials are Ensign
and Mrs. Jacobs.


GROTTO OF OUR LADY OF LOURDES AT ST. ROSE’S, KAPUNDA
Erected by the Catholics of Kapunda and District in memory
of deceased relatives. The Grotto was dedicated on the first
Sunday in January, 1927, when there was a very large attend-
ance from Adelaide and surrounding districts.


Kapunda & Light Agricultural Society.
The present Society had its inception ih 1857, when a few
of the prominent men of the district decided to hold a ploughing
match. Among those were Messrs. Henry Kelly, David Shannon,
and James White. The residents of Kapunda and Angaston
joined, but the function proved a loss of £3O, and half of this
amount was met by Angaston, and Messrs. White and D. Shannon
paid Kapunda’s share, Matches were held yearly, and the first
show was held in iB6O, when prizes were offered for draught
horses. Up to that time bullocks were mostly used; in fact, at
the first ploughing match four of the six entries were drawn by
bullocks. The judges at these matches were:—Richard Palmer,
James Shannon, and Robert Hyde. The real start of a show
was held in 1865, when produce was shown in the room then
known as Crase’s Wheat Store, at present occupied by Messrs.
Glutterbuck Bros., in Franklin Street. The implements and horse
stock were exhibited in what is now Coles Bros.’ sale yards. For
a few years this much apathy was shown, and in 1869 things got
so bad that a resolution was carried that no show be held. This
was proposed by Mr. J. O’Loughlin and seconded by Mr. William
Jeffs. The resolution caused a lot of consternation in the town.
A special meeting was called, and the two parties became very
heated, with the result that Mr. J. P. Moyle (grandfather of
Messrs. W. J. M. and S. A. B. Oats) and Mr. J. A. Bruce (father
of the present Lord Mayor of Adelaide) left the room. Eventu-
ally better counsel prevailed, and the show was eventually held.
At about this time various farm implements were shown. A
reaper, which was considered an improvement on the “Ridley”
(the first stripper made) was shown. Afterwards Mr. H. B. Hawke
exhibited a new mowing machine, Mr. J. F. Mellor a novel horse
rake, and Mr. R. Cameron an improved reaper. Later on Mr.
G. P. Ralph made and exhibited a one-horse reaping machine.
From the year 1870 to 1877, owing to the dry seasons and
apathy shown, the position of the Society was very bad; in fact,
it was again decided to close up altogether in 1877. Just at this
time, however, many of the prominent men met and decided to
resuscitate the Society. Among those present were: —Hon. J,
Pearce, Messrs. J. White, M.P., H. T. Morris, J. Scandrett, W,
Flavel, J. Coles, J. Carey, Pat. Kerin, and many others. A prize
list of £5l was offered. A good show was held, but the plough-
ing match was a failure. There were some good Alderney cows,
but it is recorded that the Angora goats were a disappointment.
In the year 1880 the matter of purchasing a showground was con-
sidered. Many sites were offered, and the Committee of Dutton
Park offered to lease a portion of Dutton Park, hut eventually
Mr. W. R. Morton offered to sell a part of the mine paddock at
£8 per acre, which was afterwards reduced to £6. This land was
eventually purchased. The building of the wall, sheds, etc., cost
more than the Society could afford. Subscriptions were asked for,
and Mr. F. H. Dutton donated £2OO, the Hon. J. Pearce, M.L.C.,
£lOO, and many other subscriptions were handed in. The 1881
show was a good success, the prize list amounting to £220. It
was at this show that Mr. James White, M.P., acted as President,
and Mr. James Scandrett as Secretary. At the 1882 Show, His
Excellency the Governor attended, the attendance being 3,000.
From that date many successful annual shows were held, and the
Society gradually increased in popularity. In 1883 Mr. William
Jeffs was appointed assistant secretary. The 1887 show was a
good one, and it was at that show that Mr. David James’ thorough-
bred, “Josephus,” took the prizes for jumping. In 1890 Mr.
W. M. Shannon was appointed President, and Mr. W. Flavel
Secretary. Mr. David .lames was appointed President in 1892,
1893, and 1894. In 1895 Mr. H. T. Morris was appointed President
and Mr. T. Jeffs, Secretary. The 1897 show proved a loss owing
to wet weather. In 1899 the new show hall was suggested, and
Mr. David James took a prominent part in its erection. It was
found necesasry to borrow money, and £BOO was loaned from the


Kapunda Hospital at 4| per cent., and on the 6th June, 1900,
the foundation stone was laid by the Mayoress, Mrs. David James,
pie present Secretary, Mr. T. S. Davie, was appointed in 1911,
and has held office up to the present. During the years of the
war, from 1914, it was decided to forego the holding of a show,
and the whole of the work of financing the Society through those
years fell on the Secretary. He had to let the land to the best
advantage, and get as many subscriptions as possible to pay the
interest on the loan of £6O0 —which were still owing—and it is
due to him that the Society did not go back through those years.
There were two horses-in-action shows held, and in 1919 the
matter of a show was again considered, and one was held in 1920.
It was then thought advisable to sell the showground, and make
some arrangement with the Dutton Park Committee for holding
shows in the Park; An agreement was eventually arrived at, aiid
the Dutton Park Committee granted a 20 years’ lease to the
Society. The first show was held at Dutton Park in 1922, and,
having increase! in interest and popularity since then, promises
to be one of the best Country shows in the near future.

KAPUNDA BRASS BAND.
Early in the fifties of last century the first band was formed
by the courtesy and support of Mr. Wm. Oldham, the manager
of the Kapunda Mine. Good material for the purpose was at
hand among the miners, and artisans, etc., who were attracted
hither by the discovery and opening up of the mine, among whom
were some of rare musical ability. Mr. George Bargwanna was
the chosen leader and bandmaster, and under his tuition a really
fine band of over 30 performers was trained to a point of per-
fection that made their services required at many important vice-
regal and civic functions in the city and elsewhere, viz., the visit
of the Duke of Edinburgh, the funeral of the Governor (Domo-
nick Daly), Proclamation Days, etc., besides affording a much-
needed recreation and pleasure for local residents. This fine
combination existed several years with the able support of such
men as the Carnes, Wilhards, Tregays, Jeffs, Gregors, Dunstans,
Hoopers, Minalls, and Menhennetts, and was followed by various
smaller bands that have succeeded in fostering and maintaining
the sacred fire of Orpheus to the present time. Among past con-
ductors were:—W. H. Carne, John Menhennett, R. J. Hooper,
B. Harris, G. Anderson, sen., W. May, C. A. Neindorf, J. Riggs,
and G. Anderson, jun. At present the members total 23, and the
band must be regarded as a valuable asset to our town, and
deserves every encouragement and help from the residents.
Kapundaites are proud of their devoted efforts and loyalty to the
musical tradition of the town. The present officials are:—Patron,
Dr. J. Riddell; President, Rev. A. W. A. Rowland; Committee,
Messrs. R. H. Williams, A. Matthews, W. J. Thomas, F. I. W. E.
Smith, W. Truscott, E. Trevena, and L. N. Tilbrook (town),
Messrs. R. Davis, W. Anderson, A. Carlson, W. Goedecke, and
F. Moon (band) ; Librarian, Mr. H. Sauer; Bandmaster, Mr. C. A.
Neindorf; Deputy Bandmaster, Mr. F. Moon; Secretary, Mr. H.
Jory; Assistant Secretary, Mr, H. Laubsch.


KAPUNDA INSTITUTE.


Kapunda Institute Incorporated.
The Kapunda Institute was founded on February 16th, 1869.
Mr. Pitcher was the chairman.
Object.—That the object of the Institute shall be the pro-
motion of useful knowledge and rational amusement by providing
a library, reading rooms, museum, lectures, conversaziones, classes,
and any other means which the committee may find expedient.
Committee at that time:—Messrs. Darwin, Oldham, Gurr,
Bennett, Buchanan.
Life Members—That donors of £lO and upwards to the In-
stitute funds be enrolled as life members without further pay-
ment. The annual subscription shall be one pound, to be paid
quarterly in advance.
Plans for the new Institute having been prepared by Mr.
Garlick, and tenders invited, that of Messrs. Manson and Hill
was accepted on the 6th August, 1870. Value of land, £200;
buildings and offices, £1,535; cost of excavating site, £4O. The
contract was completed by them in the satisfactory manner of
which the evidences are now before you. On October 12th 1870
which was observed as a public holiday in the town, the founda-
tion stone was laid by the Hon. John Hart, C.M.G., Provincial
Gr„nd Master of Freemasons, Scotcn Constitution. The building
was opened with an exhibition of fine arts on the 12th July, 187 L
and the immense concourse of visitors upon that occasion was
proof of the interest felt in the Institute by the residents of the
town and surrounding country. The number of subscribers was
126. At that time non-subscribers availed themselves of the
opportunity of frequenting the reading rooms, open free each day
for two hours. Donations to the building fund amounted to £555.
The Institute was incorporated on February 21st, 1871. Tenders
for the hall were called, and that of Mr. P. McLaren was accepted
for the sum of £1,210 15/-. Building operations began in Octobei,
1873, and the hail was opened in May, 1874.
The Philharmonic Society was formed and affiliated to the
Kapunda Institute in August, 1872, and helped the funds con-
siderably. Mr. E. Riley held the position of secretary, caretaker,
librarian until his death, and Mr. William Stokes was appointed
in 1893 and held office until December, 1906. Mr. Joseph O’Neil
was appointed in 1/07 and has held the position ever since.
The billiard room was opened in October, 1916, and has been
a great help in increasing the number of subscribers. The read-
ing rooms are well patronised by about 40 or 50 a day, and there
are above 3,000 books in the library, many of them of a highly
c<! national value. There are 270 subscribers on the roll, and
the subscriptions amount to £lBO annually. The Institute has
alsi an excellent juvenile library. The president is Mr. W. T.
Truscott, who was elected in 1925; and the Institute is now con-
ducting its own picture show. Issue of books, 12,000 yearly.
Soldiers’ Memorial Hall.
1 his idea has been considered for some time, but up to the
present has not borne fruit. Ihe object was to convert the present
building into a soldiers’ memorial hall and to make all returned
men ljfe members, and there is yet hope that the scheme will be
adopted. The Lite Mr, A, S. Lewis was the promoter,

Kapunda Sub-Branch.
A Sub-Branch of the above League has existed in Kapunda
since the 29th January, 1920, and has always taken a lively
interest in matters appertaining to the welfare of the town and
district. Mr. T. A. T. Heward was the first president, with
Messrs. E. K. Jeffs and W. A. Ros*. as vice-presidents.
During the Great War some 310 young men and six nurses
from Kapunda enlisted for active service, and of this number
60 were killed in action or died of wounds; many others were
incapacitated. The Sub-Branch assists in looking after the wel-
fare of its less fortunate members, and annually make two appeals,
the first for T.B. soldiers and the second a general appeal for
distress among ex-service men and their dependents.

KAPUNDA'S GOLDEN
GRAIN.
WHEAT STACK AT KAPUNDA RAILWAY STATION.
Perhaps the most stable of the industries
of the district, and certainly the most im-
portant, is that of wheat raising. North,
south, east and west of the town lie the
prosperous homesteads of the farmers, and
every year a large quantity of the golden
grain is brought into Kapunda and railed
to the city.
With the use of improved machinery and
manures, the yield is still increasing, and
during the season just past large consign-
ments of wheat passed through the town,
in addition to other large parcels trucked
at such near-by stations as Bagot’s Well
and Fords.
The average yield for the district per
acre is about 16 bushels, and with an as-
sured rainfall the yield is never much be-
low this average.


WOOL.
From the earliest days in the Settlement
of South Australia, wool has been one of
the most stable products of the Kapunda
district; indeed, it was while inspecting
sheep running on the site of the old Ka-
punda Mine that the first trace of copper
deposits were discovered.
Although the larger sheep runs have
now been more closely settled and given
up, in nart, to agriculture, the farmer of
to-day has learnt the value of keeping a
few sheep on his farm, so that the yield
has not been appreciably diminished.
The quality of the wool grown is very
high, being principally Merino.
Since ttie war the high price obtained in
the world’s market for wool makes wool
production largely responsible for the pros-
perity of the district.


PHOSPHATE QUARRY NEAR KAPUNDA.


COPPER.
Among the many mineral resources of Kapunda and its dis-
trict the red metal has the pre-eminence, for, beside the enormous
quantity of copper that has been won from the Kapunda Mine
during its working by the mining companies and since by tri-
haters, according to experienced miners there should be still a
greater quantity to be won from greater depths in the future.
This theory is founded on the fact that strong bodies of sulphide
ores are known to exist at the deepest point yet reached, viz., 480
feet, so that when we consider the fact that the 16 principal work
ing shafts in use at the time of the mine being worked did not
average more than 240 feet, we are forced to the conclusion that
the main ore body is still to he found at a greater depth. Also
that the Kapunda Mine has a great future, when the world’s
increasing demand for copper shall cause its re-opening.
That Kapunda is pre-eminently a copper-bearing district is
borne out by the fact that discoveries of that mineral have been
made in every direction surrounding the town.
On the west, Gundrv’s Mine (which was worked by Capt.
Gitndry in 1850-51 and left when the Victorian diggings started)
remains one of the most promising. In the deepest of the three
shallow shafts sunk on the property (all revealing ore of good
quality) the trend and dip of the ore was inclined to intercept
a massive ironstone lode formation, from which for fifty years
metal has been raised for road making. These indentions, in flu-
opinions of e-'-perinur/'d miners, make very probable the dis-
covery of a rich mine at no ereat depth.
Stephens’ Aline, east half a mile from the Kapunda Mine,
was worked in 1864-65. but to no great extent, 14 tons of ore
being raised from the only shaft on the property in 1895.
Aben’s Creek Mine, two miles north of this, was worked in
1873-74. and a few tons of copper ore raised from the shallow
pits sunk.
Lachimore Mine, seven miles N.E., was worked for a short
time, and ore assaying 36 per cent, was found on the surface
jn a lode formation,
PHOSPHATE ROCK INDUSTRY
Phosphate rock was first found in this district in May, 1903,
by Mr. Ihomas Green, to whom credit of starting this industry
is due. After prospecting on property owned by Mr. M. Hans-
berry, which is situated three miles east of Kapunda, good samples
of rock were found to exist. After onening up the deposit, Mr.
Green persuaded Mr. A. Duncan to join him, and a little later,
in conjunction with Messrs. Clutterbuck Bros., the quarry was
extensively worked, and many thousands of tons of phosphate
rock have been railed to Port Adelaide. The picture of the open
cut will give some idea of the face of the deposit, the depth of
which is 25 feet, and the drives have travelled a long way into
the centre of the hill. Other deposits were discovered on Ham-
pel’s land by Mr. Keiper. Mr. T. Green also worked Dermody's
quarry extensively. Messrs. Clutterbuck Bros, quarried many
tons of rock from Kleinig’s and Tom’s quarries. Mr. A. Duncan
was also the means of opening up a rich deposit on Mr. R. Kerr’s
land at St. Kitts, 13 miles east of Kapunda, in May, 1905. Rock
from this quarry turned out to be of good quality, and tests
ranged from 60 to 70 per cent, phosphate. This industry employed
30 quarrymen and carters for many years, and was worked by
Messrs. Clutterbuck Bros, until 1926, when it was decided to
close down on account of high cost of labour. At the present
time Hansberry’s quarry is being worked by the Cresco Co., the
foreman in charge being Mr. M. Hansberry, who has been con-
nected with the industry since it started. There is still plenty of
good rock available to anyone interested in the industry,


MARBLE.
Parliament House, Adelaide, built of Kapunda Marble.
Extensive beds of marble have been
found in the Kapunda district, consisting
in colour of cream, chrome, grey, varie-
gated. and blue. It is of good quality,
pronounced by experts to be consistent in
texture and suitable for columns, orna-
mental and monumental designs, and gene-
ral work in connection with architecture of
every kind.
The new Parliament House in the city of
Adelaide is built of Kapunda marble, and
probably will be completed with the same
material when the necessity arises for the
further extension of the building.
Some very fine panels and foundation
stones consisting of blue and white varie-
gated marble, together with dressed slabs,
suitable for floors and street footpaths, have
been raised from the local quarries.
The marble contains a high percentage
of calcareous properties, and thousands of
tons have been sent to Drv Creek and Port
Adelaide as flux in connection with the
smelting of galena ores from the Broken
Hill mines.
Large quantities of lime have been manu-
factured and sold from time to time,

KAPUNDA HIGH SCHOOL.


EDUCATIONAL.
Kapunda High School,
The Kapunda High School was established on Jahuary 21st,
1907, when Mr. H, G. Hosking (now an inspector in the Educa-
tion Department) commenced duties as Assistant-in-charge of the
continuation class, as the school was then known. He was fol-
lowed in 1908 by Mr. J. E. A. Klose, now on the staff of Prince
Alfred College. Mr. R. Barbour (present headmaster of Gawler
High School) took charge in 1914. The present headmaster, Mr.
L. McCarthy, was appointed to ihe school in 1915.
Classes were held for many years in class rooms of the
Kapunda Primary School. On May 81st, 1921, Sir Sidney Kidman
presented his beautiful home, “Eringa,” at Kapunda, to the
Education Department for use as a high school—a munificent gift
to the cause of education in South Australia.
The high school is now in point of buildings, gardens, and
environment one of the finest in the State. The school prepares
students for both public and commercial University examinations
up to the “leaving” standard, although in recent years students
have been successful in “leaving honours” subjects. The present
staff consists of Mr. L. McCarthy (headmaster), Miss R. Bruse
(assistant), Mr. D. Dowd (woodwork instructor), and Miss E.
Wallis (domestic art teacher).
The members of the High School Council are Messrs. H.
Hughes (chairman), S. A. B. Oats, A. F. Mayger, L. N. Til-
brook H. Allen, D. Hambour, J. Leslie, W. J. Thomas, S. March,
H. Beneke, G. Anderson, and J. O’Neil (secretary).
SIR SIDNEY KIDMAN,
Who presented Eringa to the Education
Department.


KAPUNDA PRIMARY SCHOOL.


Kapunda Primary School.
This school was completed in 1877 and opened in January,
1878, the first headmaster being Mr. Wm. L. Neale, whose photo-
graph hangs in one of the classrooms. The head teachers since
opening are as follows:-—William L. Neale, 1878-83; William J.
Mcßride, 1884-88; Alfred Holloway, 1889-96; Erhardt Schroeder,
1897-99; Henry J. Tuck, 1900-05; George S. Berriman, 1905-06;
Frederick N. Leak, 1907-08; William Ham, 1908-10; Adolph E.
Mueller, 1910 11; William H. Hand, 1911-14; William Luke, 1914-
15; Dennis D. Murphy, 1915-18; William D. Oliver, 1918-21;
William A. Bentley, 1922-26; Harrv L. Haines, 1927.
The school opened with a roll number of 220. The numbers
gradually increased until in 1886 when the numbers reached about
500. Ten years later the number had decreased to about 350.
For some years the average remained about 300. By 1908 the
average was about 240. Since that time the average att r ndance
has hovered between 250 and 300. To-day there is a roll number
of 280.
The School Committee consists of:—Messrs. T. Jeffs (chair-
man), W. T. Truscott (hon. secretarvi, H. Hughes, J. F. W.
Linke, D. C. Murray, E. Marschall, and W. J. Thomas.
Kapunda Technical School.
A branch of the Adelaide School of Mines was established at
Kapunda in the year 1891, and continued under the auspices of
tfiat institution until 1915. Under the provisions of the Education
Act of 1915 all of the country branches of the Adelaide School of
Mines were brought under the direct control of the Education
Department and designated Technical Schools. Dr. Jenner was
appointed Superintendent of Technical Education, and under his
supervision a syllabus of subjects perpared and supplied to the
different schools.
The Kapunda School is held in a section of the public school
building, and is fitted up with suitable appointments, including
electric light and power. The subjects taught are geometrical and
mechanical drawing, shorthand, typewriting, book-keeping, dress-
making and millinery. Provision is also made when required for
imparting instruction in invalid cookery and woolclassing.
Excellent results have been gained by students of the different
subjects in connection with the annual departmental examinations.
Tne school as an education institution on technical lines is, and
has been, of practical benefit to the town and district. A large
number of young people (male and female) have been qualified
or 'be foundation laid of a successful career as a result of their
association with the school.
The local interest of the institution is under the supervision
of a council consisting of 12 gentlement, viz., Mr. J. H. Hitchens
Coresident), Messrs. W. J. M. Oats and L. N. Tilbrook (vice-
presid nts), Rev. F. J. Price, Messrs. Thos. Jeffs, W. Truscott, R.
Hawke, H. L. Haines, H. H. Rees, and H. J. Truscott (registrar).
•
The Dominican Convent.
Classes are held daily at the Dominican Convent, and the
e ducation imparted there by the Sisters reaches a high standard.


Sports and Pastimes.
Kapunda has become famous for its annual Foundation Day
sports meeting, which is held at Dutton Park under the auspices
of the Kapunda Cycle and Athletic Club.
This Club was founded in 1908 by the late Mr. S. E. Han-
cock and an enthusiastic committee. The first sports programme
of £lB was carried out at Dutton Park on Foundation Day of
that year. Mr. T. T. Thompson was the first President, and Mr.
S. E. Hancock, Secretary. Sports have been held at Dutton Park
on Foundation Day in each year, and the prize money has steadily
increased. In 1927 the total prizes, including trophies, amounted
to £230. The club, in addition to maintaining the cycle track,
which is recognised as being one of the best in the State, has
effected many improvements at Dutton Park. During the war period
the net proceeds of £55 of the annual fixtures was donated to
patriotic funds, and over £lOO was realised from luncheon and
refreshment booths, which were under the control of the League
of Loyal Women. The club has always taken an active interest
in the 100 mile road race, whieh is promoted by the Dunlop
Rubber Coy. annually,, and in 1925 was instrumental in having
this raee started from Kapunda. The President of the Club,
Mr. Jos. Burgess, was elected to that position in 1920, and is a
foundation member. The Secretary, Mr. W. T. Truscott, has
held office since 1910, and several members of the Committee
have acted in that capacity since the inception of the Club.
Sports of all seasons are followed by Kapunda citizens, and
many strong clubs exist. In addition to the Bowling Club, des-
cribed elsewhere, the list includes:—

Kapunda Rifle Club.
This was among the first registered in the State, its founda-
tion coming from the old Militia or “Red Coats,” of which
Kapunda boasted two companies in the old mining days. Of
these, only Mr. R. J. Hooper, sen., remains in the town. For many
years a champion shot, successively of his battalion and the club,
he is now past shooting, but still takes a keen interest in it.
The register shows the names of some hundreds of residents who
have passed through its ranks, including many prominent towns-
men. The club still has a good roll, and, as always, some keen
marksmen. Owing to the enterprise of the then members, about
40 acres on the banks of the River Light were secured for a
range, and it is probably one of the best sites for the purpose
in the State, if not in the Commonwealth. Generous supporters
have been the late Sir Jenkin Coles, the late Mr. Henry Dutton,
Mr. H. H. Dutton, Mr. C. de N. Lucas, and Dr. Riddell, and
many townspeople also are good supporters. It is worthy of note
that over 20 members of the Club enlisted for the Great War.
The present officers are H. Hughes, Captain; D. FI. Wurst, Secre-
tary; H. A. Alehin, Treasurer; Committee, F. H. Gamlen, R. H.
Hughes, W. L. Hooper, and E. L. March.
