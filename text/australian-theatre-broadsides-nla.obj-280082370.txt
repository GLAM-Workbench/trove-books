The Ruling Passion, —Editor’s Wife—
‘Oh, John, baby has swallowed a but-
ton!” Editor— “ Well, let’s hope it
won’t hurt the poor little chap, but should
it happen to kill him, what a splendid
alliterative headline it will make ! —“A
Baby Bolts a Button and Becomes
Breathless’!” Editor’s Wife —“ Oh, you
hrufce!”
He was No Giraffe.
The plaintiff’s barrister in the breach
of promise case thought he would make
life a burden to the unfortunate young
man who was the unwilling defendant.
0 “ Do you mean to say,” he asked, after
a number of embarrassing questions, “that
after you have been absent for an entire
month you did not kiss the plaintiff to
whom you were engaged to be married,
when you first saw her on your return ? ”
“ I do,” responded the defendant firmly.
“Will you make that statement to the
jury ?”
** Certainly, if necessary.”
“Do you think they would believe
you ? ”
“ One of them would, I know.”
“Ah, indeed. And why .should he,
pray ? ”
“ Because he was present when I first
saw her. He was at the gate when I rode
up, and she put her head out of the second-
storey window, and I said to her, ‘ How
d’ye do ? ’ and called out I’d be back to
supper in half an hour. I’m no giraffe ; ”
and everybody smiled except the barrister.
“ Evidently you were overlooked in the
account of the entertainment last night,’g
said the gossip.
“Oh, no,” replied Mrs. Newrich. “I
was mentioned. Didn’t you see the last
line of the list of those present P ”
“ Yes. It read ‘ and others.’ ”
“ That’s me,” asserted Mrs. Newrich
proudly but ungrammatically.
Go Over to the Other Side.
He had determined to serve his country
and leave his practice at home, but met
with grievous remonstrance from his
mother.
“ I beseech you not to go to this war,
my son ! ” she pleaded, her soft eyes full
of tears.
“ But I do not go to fight, mother,”
said the doctor cheerfully. “I am going
as a medical man. Surely there is no
harm in that.”
“ Well, well,” she said doubtfully, “go
then, if it must be so.” Then suddenly
a gleam of joy lit up her countenance.
She looked bravely into her son’s face
and said:
“If you find you kill more than you
cure, I advise you to go straightway over
to the other side, my son! ”
“I trust your husband had something
saved up for a rainy day,” said a
sympathising friend. “ Indeed he had.”
replied the widow ( with a fresh buret o£
tears. “He had seven umbrellas. John
was the thriftiest man I ever knew.”
Thus an American paper.— The tele-
graph companies of Australia suffer a
good deaj from the fondness of the
natives for bracelets and ear and nose
rings made of telegraph wire.” All this
statement, by the way, is true, except
that there are no telegraph companies in
Australia, and that the few stray aborig-
inals to be found near telegraph lines
never dream even remotely of touching
the wires. The remainder of the state-
ment is quite correct, that is, if there' is
any remainder.
j Barkley : “ Why, is it a woman can
never keep a secret r ”
Henpeck: “But she can. I have never
succeeded in getting my wife to tell me
where she hides our pocket book, and
]’ve been trying for fifteen years.”
Beauty unadorned may be most adorned;
but, fortunately for the milliner-and the
dressmaker, it doesn’t think so.
O’Flaherty: “Is your son working
now, Pat ? ”
Pat: “ Shure an - ' he’s got a job in a
powder mil),, with good "prospects uv
gittin 5 a rise.”
“ This is the seventh time you’ve been
before me,” said the magistrate, “Yes,”
replied the culprit; “it’s strange how
some men hold on to office,”

A MARVELLOUS MACHINE.
The progress of modern invention is ever in the
direction of labor-saving appliances, and applied
mechanism is now capable of doing almost any-
thing hitherto done by hand, Writing machines
are amongst the most modern introductions,
and the march of improvement has manifested
itself most markedly in this direction. Abso-
lutely the very latest is the “ Elliott and.
Hatch ” Book Typewriter, a machine which
writes in books, addresses cards, labels or
envelopes, and conducts the ordinary corres-
pondence of professional and business men.
The writing in books is a feature not possessed
by any other typewriter. The principles of
construction are wonderfully simple, and no
limit is placed upon the size, binding or thick-
ness of the book to be used. Forms and
documents up to 18 x 23 inches can be written
upon over their entire surface. John Andrew
and Co., 13 Bridge-street, Sydney, are the
sole agents in Australia, and most cordially
invite inspection and examination of the
machines working in their showrooms.
• He—“ Just think of it, They say
man descended from a monkey.” She—
A come down, indeed.”
Took the Highlander’s Excuse,
A recruit of a Highland regiment which
was stationed at Malta went out to see
the town, and remained absent. He was
brought before the commanding officer, a
Highland gentleman of the old school,
next morn ng.
“ This is a verra fine thing, Sim, [to be
absent fca verra first nicht you join ta
corps,” said the officer.
££ Beg pardon,” said Sim, “ but I lost
myself in the streets of the capital, and
could not get back in time.”
“I’ll tak’ yer excuse,” said the officer,
< £ but ye maun mind that ye’ll hae to bide
jn barracks till he ken the toon ! ”
She Didn’t Forget It Either.
A north-country miller, noted for Lis
keenness in financial matters, was once in
a boat trying his best to get across the
stream which drove his mill.
The stream was flooded, and lie was
taken past the point at which he wanted
to land ; while, further on, misfortune
again overtook him, to the extent that
the boat was upset.
His wife, realising the danger he was
in, ran frantically along the side of the
stream, crying for help in a pitiful voice ;
when, to her sheer amazement, she was
suddenly brought to a standstill by her
husband yelling out: —
“ If I’m drowned, Molly, dunnot forget
that flour’s gone up two shillin’ a sack 1 ”

ARISTOCRACY OF CRIME.
“ He didn’t speak to yer, did he ? ”
“Uv course not. Yer don’t expect an expert bank-robber
like him to speak ter a humble sneak-thief, does yer ’ ”
The revolutionist leader was rapidly
getting ahead of his men in the wild
retreat.
The private who sprinted just at his
heels managed to say :
“ Why do you run ? I thought you
bragged that you would die in the last
ditch P”
“ I will—l will, my boy. But the last
ditch is some distance away, and I must
hurry if I am to keep my word.”
And the little band of heroes continued
to annihilate time and distance.
BOMB ANCIENT BATTLES.
The Battle of Marathon, B.c. 490, in
which the Athenians, under Mllitiades,
defeated the Persians, under Xerxes.
The Battle of Syracuse, b,g -413, in
which the Athenians were defeated by
the Syracusians and their allies.
The Battle of Arbella, B.c. 331, in
which the Persians, under Darius, were

under Alexander the Great.
The Battle of Metaurus, b.c. 207, in

The Battle of Philippi., b.c. 42, in which
Brutus and Cassius were defeated by
Octavius and Antony. The fate of the
Republic was decided.
The Battle of Actinm, B.C. 31, in which

Cleopatra were defeated by Octavius,
and Imperialism established 'in the per-
son of Octavius.
