Commonwealth of Australia.
Minister of State for Defence.
Major-General French, R.A., C.M.G.,
Military Commandant, Sydney, N.S.W., —
As it is necessary that at as early a date as possible, a draft Defences and
Discipline Bill for the Commonwealth, and Regulations under the same should be
prepared for presentation to Parliament I hereby appoint the Military Com-
mandants of the several States of the Commonwealth to be a Committee to —
fa) Consider the Defence Acts of the several States, and to draft a Defences
and Discipline Bill for the Commonwealth. The Bill should provide
for the formation of Rifle Clubs and Cadet Corps. It should also include
provision for Naval Forces.
(h) To prepare draft Regulations under the Bill for—
(a) Permanent Forces ;
(bj Militia or Partially-paid;
(c) Volunteers, including Cadets;
(d) Rifle Clubs.
(c) To prepare Dress Regulations.
fd) To draw up a scale of pay and allowances, and capitation and effective
grants for—
{a) Permanent Forces;
(h) Militia or Parti ally-pa id ;
(c) Volunteers.
The Committee will meet at Sydney and will appoint a Secretary who,
however, will not be a member of the Committee.
Each Commandant has been instructed by telegram of the appointment of
this Committee, and that you will convene the same, and I shall be glad if you will
therefore place yourself in communication with the other Commandants with the
view' of the meeting being held at Sydney at the earliest date possible in March.
Each Commandant w ill bring with him copies of the Acts and Regulations
of his State, and I will be glad if you wall submit to the Committee also a copy of
the Draft Bill prepared in New South Wales in 1896.
I w r ould also point out that it is important and desirable that all matters of a
permanent character should be embodied in the Bill and not be left to Regulations;
that is, I would wish to limit the necessity of provision by Regulations as much as
possible, by making the Act comprehensive, and to include rates of pay and periods
of training.
It might be possible for the Committee to make a progress report, in the way
of furnishing me with a draft Bill wdien prepared, without wanting for the comple-
tion of their labors, so that I might have as much time as possible for its considera-
tion before the meeting of Parliament.

REPORT
OF THE
FEDERAL MILITARY COMMITTEE, 1901.
Assembled at Sydney, New South Wales, on 20th March, 1901,
and following days.
*
JPresident:
Major-Gene ral G. A. F BENCH, If.A., C.M.G., Commanding the Military Forces
of New South Wades.
Members:
Major-General M. F. EOWNES (late 8.A.), C.M.G., Commanding the Military
Forces of Victoria.
Colonel G. H. CHIPPINDALL, Commanding the Military Forces of West
Australia,
Colonel H. FINN, Commanding the Military Forces of Queensland.

Secretary :
Major W. T. BRIDGES, Eoyal Australian Artillery.
Recommendations of the Committee upon the Agenda.
Para. 1.
1. Defences and Discipline Dill for the Commomvealth.
The Federal Military Conference, which sat in Sydney in 1894, recommended that
the Queensland Defence Act of 1884, witli the amendments of 1891, should form
the basis of legislation required in connection with the Defence Forces of the
Colonies of Australia and Tasmania. With this recommendation the Colonial
Defence Committee (London) concurred.
The Acts mentioned, and the South Australian and West Australian Defence
Acts, formed the basis of a Bill drafted in 1896 by Major-General G. A. French,
H.A., C.M.G., for acceptance by each of the Colonies of Australia and Tasmania.
This Bill, with subsequent alterations, was, in accordance with the instruct
tions of the Minister, laid before the Federal Military Committee, who, after
careful consideration, submit it, as amended by them, to the Honorable the Minister
of State for Defence.
The
B


The Committee also submit the following observations upon the proposed
Bill;
Compulsory Service (Clauses 3-5).
a. The Colonial Defence Committee (London) agreed with the Federal Military
Conference, 1894, that provision should be made for compulsory service in time of
national emergency. The Defence Acts of the Dominion of Canada and of the
Colonies of Queensland, Tasmania, and South Australia provide for compulsory
service. The Committee are fully agreed that the Commonwealth Defence Act
should also provide for compulsory enlistment, to be enforced only in time of war,
when Volunteers in sufficient numbers are not forthcoming.
As it is estimated by the Government Statistician of New South Wales that
the first class in the Commonwealth (clause 5) exceeds 130,000 males, it is highly
improbable that the proposals of the Committee, if carried into law, will ever be
found burdensome or have to be enforced with respect to the other classes.
Commander-in-Chief (Clause 6).
h. Complying with section 68 of the Commonwealth Constitution Act the Bill
for the Governor-General as His Majesty’s Eepresentative being Com-
mauder-in-Chief of the Defence Force, and, as such, dealing with the discipline of
the Forces.
Command of the Land Forces and of the Marine Forces (Clause 7).
c. The Committee are agreed that it is of primary importance that the General
Officer Commanding-in-Chief and the Naval Commandant should be directly
responsible for the efficiency of the Forces under their command, and should
therefore be the sole responsible advisers of the Minister.
Though doubtless in the future it will be found desirable that local officers
should be appointed to the command of the Forces, the consensus of opinion of the
committee is that, for the present, these commands should be held by officers on the
Active Lists of His Majesty’s Imperial Army and Navy.
Privileges of the Forces (Clause 9).
d. The Constitution Act of New South Wales (section 44) provided for
articles for the use of Her Majesty’s Begular Forces being exempt from payment of
Customs Duties. Clause 10 sub-clause (n) of the Bill provides for a similar privilege
in respect to equipment being extended to the whole of the Defence Force, & a
privilege which for some time obtained in Victoria, and still obtains in Queensland
and West Australia.
Exemptions from service as jurors, &c., follow the laws of West Australia
South Australia, and New South Wales.
Regulations (Clause 10).
e. The Committee have sought to give effect to the Minister’s instructions to
make the bill as comprehensive as possible, and, in the hope of obviating amendin'*
acts, have provided sufficient powers (clause 10) to issue Regulations to meet the
varymg conditions of service obtaining within the extensive area of the Common-
wealth and changes incidental to the future. (See Appendix No. 9.)
Divisions of the Active Forces (Clause 13).
f To give all persons an opportunity of joining the Active Forces, they have
been divided into Regulars, Militia, and Volunteers, or in other words the
continuously paid, partially paid, and the unpaid forces.
Regular Forces must be maintained for the proper and efficient care of forts
armaments, magazines, explosives, stores, ships, and war materiel. The Government
statistician of New South Wales estimates that more than £4,000,000 has been
expended upon Defence works, ships, and war materiel, now maintained and lit
or use in the Commonwealth. They are also essential for the protection of the

Commenting on the Report of the Federal Military Conference the Colonial
Defence Committee observed that, judging from the reports of the Commandants of
the Colonies, the former condition did not appear capable of fulfilment until an

\ T f he Committee are of opinion that it will be to the benefit of the Common-
wealth that persons unable to join the Active Forces should be encourXd to
become efficient rifle shots, and in return for the advantages provided by the
vernment, such persons should be liable to enrolment in the Active Forces if
needed, in time of national danger. voices, it
Cadets (Clause 27).
nm After TP 1 ' 6 . oonsl deration, and hearing the opinion of the Cadet Chief
Staff Officer and Superintendent of Drill, N.S.W., the Committee recommend that

control of the Military Authorities, lads from 14 to 17 years of age, and the
Committee axe or opinion that such Senior Cadets should not be liable to service in
tune of war, and, therefore, should not form part of the Defence Force.
Officers and Non-Commissioned Officers (Clauses 28-34).
n-n {' Committee regard it as of the highest importance to the efficiency of
Forces that the promotion or officers should depend upon military merit as well
as seniority, and to further that end have provided for appointments and promotions
being made by the Governor-General as Commander-in-Chief, thus relieving Ministers
from political pressure. °
-n p aiC a a ? reed * s essential to efliciency that Members of the
e ence I orce, who, from age or other cause, become unfitted for their positions
should be retired, and that a reasonable flow of promotion be ensured. Compulsory
retirement, upon reaching a given age is therefore in their opinion necessary
llie ages for retirement or the several ranks should be the same as laid down for the
imperial iiegular and Militia Forces (see Appendix No. 1). This means that
provision must be made for pensions, for the past furnishes abundant proof that
where pensions are not provided, officers and non-commissioned officers, quite
incapable or useiul work, are retained in the Service, and the Committee are of
opinion that pensions should be granted at the same rates and under the same
conditions as laid down for the Imperial Forces (see Appendix No. 2).
. +l Th ? Committee are agreed that the tenure of appointments should be limited
as m ie Imperial Service. Provision has therefore been made for a half-pay list
XXi r officera ° f the Regular Forces may be placed, should no vacancy exist
bp -n e r! e -° f an a PP° mti f ent ex The effect of this, the Committee
/. f, ■’ rvill be to increase officers opportunities of gaming experience in all branches
i icn piotession, aim to afford opportunities of encouraging officers showing
special capacity or diligence. uinceis snowing
To set at rest any questions which may arise as to the seniority of officers
and other members of the several Defence Forces, when amalgamated, the Committee
have inserted sub-clauses 3,4, and 3of Clause 28. The Committee are of opinion
that


that the qualifications and length of service, as well as their present seniority, should
he taken into consideration in preparing the gradation lists of the Commonwealth
Forces.
As the Committee consider that no delay should occur in the preparation of
these lists, they recommend that each Commandant should forward to the President
a gradation list of the Officers and Warrant Officers of the Force under his command,
in order that the preliminary work in preparing them may be finished before the
Committee can reassemble, which it is hoped may take place in June.
Training (Clause 39).
7c. In accordance with the wishes of the Minister the periods of Training that
the Committee deem best suited to the conditions obtaining in the Commonwealth
have been inserted in the Bill.
Discipline (Clauses 45-51).
l. The Committee agree with the views expressed by the Federal Military
Conference, and concurred with by the Colonial Defence Committee, that in time of
war the Defence Force should he subject to the same laws as the Forces in other
parts of the Empire; and they are unanimously agreed that the laws they are subject
to in time of war should apply to them when on duty in time of peace. Effect has
been given to these views, making due allowances for local conditions. In this
connection it may he pointed out that no new principle is being introduced.
It is obvious that, owing to the great distances of many stations from Head-
quarters, to prevent delay in trying offences it will be necessary for the Governor-
General to delegate power to convene Courts-martial.
Offences (Clause 60).
m. The clause relating to the improper use of uniform has been taken from
the provisions contained in the Defence Act of South Australia and the Uniforms’
Act of West Australia, 1895.
Fay (Clauses 73-78).
n. Though in each State the conditions of service may not vary greatly, yet
within the extensive area of the Commonwealth, at some stations the conditions
of service are easier and the cost of living less than at others; so that it does not
appear to the Committee possible to devise a workable scheme for consolidating
pay and allowances that would be just and satisfactory to all members of the
.Regular Forces.
But as the Committee are aware that dissatisfaction has been expressed when
the emoluments of officers and men were not readily determined, they have sought to
meet such views as far as possible, and at the same time prevent any feeling of
uncertainty in respect to rates of pay. This they regard as of extreme importance
to the well-being of the Forces.
The proposals of the Committee, embodied in clause 73, provide—
1. A single rate of pay for all arms and branches of the service in place of
different rates of pay for different arms. Upon referring to Appendix
No. 3, it will be seen that the proposed rates for the lower ranks exceed
the Imperial rates; but that the proposed rates for the higher ranks are the
same as in the Imperial Service —a discrepancy which appears to be
inevitable owing to the high rate of wages ruling in Australia.
The classification of ranks and positions in Schedule 5 is based on the
classification laid down in para. 1, Allowance Regulations, 1900.
2. Further simplification is provided by the Regulations prescribing a single
schedule of rates, printed as Appendix No. 4 to this Report, consolidating
extra pay for staff appointments, extra duty, corps, departmental, armament,
and specialists pay. The rate o£ pay in this schedule to depend on the
appointment, &c., held by the individual, and to be irrespective of rank.
The rates proposed in Schedule 4 to the Bill, and the consolidated rates in
Appendix No, 4 to this Report, have been based on the supposition that other
allowances, in lieu of forage and quarters, etc., and those of an exceptional or
temporary


temporary nature, such as travelling, field, and working and good-conduct pay,
should he issued to the troops on the same scales as obtain in the Imperial Service.
An estimate of the average rates is printed as Appendix No. 5. Since the proposed
rates of pay and allowances are based on the Imperial rates, it will he necessary to
provide pensions upon the same scales as laid down for the Imperial Troops if the
Commonwealth Forces are to lie put on an equal footing with the Imperial Troops as
regards emoluments. The Committee also point out that it cannot he expected to
obtain for the Commonwealth Forces officers of the same standing and acquirements
as those of the officers of the Imperial Army and Navy if smaller emoluments are
offered, especially when there are fewer opportunities of advancement.
The rates of pay for the Militia (Schedule 5) are the same as the existing
rates for active or temporary service in Victoria, and practically the same as those
proposed by the Intercolonial Military Committee, 1896. ( See Appendix No. 6.)
The Committee considering that the pay of the Marine Forces should he
dealt with by Naval officers have not drafted clauses 76-78. They are of opinion
that the Naval rates should not he higher than for the corresponding grades of the
Land Forces.
Life Assurance {Clause 82).
o. As very unequal terms are offered by different assurance societies, the
Committee hope that some arrangement may he come to, whereby members of the
Force may obtain more favourable terms, particularly in regard to the extra premiums
that some companies exact when members of the llegular Forces are ordered on
Active Service. The Committee consider that such terms are only likely to he
obtained by making it compulsory for all married men to insure their lives. *
Transport {Clauses 81-88).
p. Experience has shown that the provisions for exemption from tolls and free
transport by railway contained in the Repealed Defence Acts require extending.
Ranges {Clause 91).
q. Provisions with respect to ranges are contained in the Victorian Defence
Act (sec. 58), the Queensland Act (sec. 52), the Tasmanian Act (sec. 51), South
Australian Act (secs. 51-53), and the West Australian Act (secs. 30-32 and 82).
Since troops untrained in the use of their weapons could never he relied upon in
battle, the Committee are of opinion that such provisions are of paramount importance
to the efficiency of the Forces.
Safety of Defences {Clauses 92-96).
r. The provisions for the safety of defences are practically those contained in
the West Australian Safety of Defences Act, 1892, and the South Australian
Defence Act.
Australian Rifle Association {Clauses 97-100).
s. The object the Committee have in view in providing for an Australian Rifle
Association is to ensure that all money voted by the Government for rifle-shooting
shall he expended in making the shooting practical and military, and to prevent
it being wasted in furnishing prizes for men already experts at target shooting.
Entering on Lands {Clause 101).
t. At the instance of the Colonial Defence Committee (London), the Inter-
colonial Military Committee, 1896, inserted in the Draft Federal Agreement a section
similar to clause 101.
Protection of Miners' Rights, Spc. {Clause 101).
u. The Committee being of opinion that, where voluntary enlistment obtains,
no obstacle should be put in the way of recruiting, they have accordingly inserted
clause 104, which is contained in the South Australian Defence Act.
Right to Drill on Government Reserves and Crown Lands {Clause 110).
v. The Committee hope by means of clause 110 to avoid the difficulties and
delays that sometimes obtain in getting suitable drill grounds for training the Forces.
It is considered that the rights of the public are fully protected by conferring the
required authority only on the Governor-General in Council.

DISSENT.
CO
I do not concur with the following provisions of the Draft Bill:—•
1. Suh-section (3) of danse 7.
It appears to me that there is no reason wdiy the Executive should he thus
hound to a particular course of action in making appointments.
2. I do not concur with the proposed subdivision of the Defence Eorces into
Regulars, Militia, Volunteers (clauses 12, 13, 26, 27), Rifle Clubs, and Cadet Corps.
I propose, instead, that the Defence Eorces he subdivided as follows;
(a) Active Eorces.
(h) Reserves.
The Active Eorces to consist of—
(a) Regulars permanently employed.
(b) Militia (partially paid).
The Reserves to consist of Rifle Clubs and men who have served in the
Regular or partially-paid Eorces, who will receive no pay, hut will he provided with
uniforms, arms, and equipment, in return for such training as may he prescribed.
3. The system of partial payment to he as follows:—Regulations will pre-
scribe the standard of efficiency, and every volunteer who reaches that standard will
he entitled to personally receive the amount of pay fixed upon by the Regulations,
in addition to his uniform, arms, and equipment.
J. M. GORDON,
Brigadier-General,
Commanding S.A.M. Eorces.
(n)
I do not concur with clause 31, sub-sections (1), and (3) of the Draft Bill.
Suh-section (3). I think that power should he given by this Act to the
Governor-General to extend the age to sixty-two, provided the officer in question
is capable of efficiently performing the duties of his command.

Formal Proceedings.
Election of Secretary .
President Upon receiving the instructions of the Minister of State to
convene this Committee, I appointed Major W. T. Bridges, Royal Australian Artillery,
to assist me in preparing papers to be laid before the Committee. He was Secretary
to the Federal Military Conference, 1894, and the Intercolonial Military Committee,
1896.
Proposed by Major-General Downes and seconded by Colonel H. Finn, that
Major TV .T. Bridges, R.A.A., be appointed Secretary to the Committee. Carried.
Agenda.
President : I beg to submit to the Committee the following papers, printed
copies of which are laid before each member, viz. :
(a) Minute No. 3 by the Minister of State for Defence, dated 1 March, 1901,
appointing this Committee.
(h) The Agenda Paper.
(c) A Defences and Discipline Bill lor Australia, which I have prepared as a
basis for discussion.
President ;


President: The Federal Military Conference of 1894 proposed that the
Queensland Act of 1884, with the amendments of 1891, should be adopted as the
basis of legislation required in connection with the Defence Forces of Australia and
Tasmania, a recommendation with which the Imperial Colonial Defence Committee
concurred. When I arrived here in 1896 I found that no effect had been given to
these proposals, and, with the concurrence of the Premier, I prepared an Act to be
passed by each Colony, in order that the laws affecting the Defence Forces of the
various Colonies should be alike. Practically up to the present time no further steps
have been taken. I now lay before you what I hope will be considered the cream of
the Acts, and it is, I think, our main business to consider this carefully. A great deal
of attention has been given to it. There is a matter which, I daresay, has struck
you, as it has me: it is the great disadvantage we now labour under in having no
system of pensions, and I suppose in other Colonies, as here, there are a large
number of officers quite over the age for work. I suppose you would all like to
look over this draft Bill, and will be ready to commence business to-morrow
afternoon.
After a short discussion it was resolved to adjourn until 2 p.m. the next dav,
