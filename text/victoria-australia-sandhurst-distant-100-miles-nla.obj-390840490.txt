COLONY OF VICTORIA.
o^-0
MW&HE most southern portion of the island-continent of
<sLs Australia is the Colony of Victoria. It comprises an area
of 87,884 square miles, of which about one-third, or
30,000 square miles, is occupied by gold-bearing rocks. The
goldfields on the west are distant 350 miles from those on the
east; and those on the south, 200 miles from the rich auriferous
tracts on the north. From the first discovery of gold in this part
of Australia, up to the present time, the fields have yielded
53,759,203 ozs., of the value of £215,036,812.
At the commencement “gold digging” alone was carried on.
The soils in the vicinity of the quartz reefs, and the shallow
gullies trending from the reefs, yielded, with few appliances, an
immense amount of gold; the value of the metal exported in 1852
being £8,875,128 ; in 1853, £10,705,380 ; in 1854, £8,602,920 ;
in 1855, £11,006,140; and in 1856, £11,943,964. Subsequently
deep leads (old stream-beds) covered with volcanic lava, were
explored with success; and soon thereafter the quartz reefs were
opened up, and these and the deep leads continue to yield
abundantly.
Since the first publication of Mineral Statistics in the Colony,
up to the end of 1884, particulars have been obtained respecting
the yield of gold from 20,931,576 tons of vein quartz crushed,
M3555'? SMgbb


showing an average per ton of 10 dwts. 13.41 grs. Considerably
more than one-third of the quartz crushed is raised in the
Sandhurst district, and the yield per ton is exceptionally high.
In the Sandhurst and Eaglehawk Mining Divisions—in the near
neighbourhood of the City of Sandhurst—there were crushed in
1884, 324,039 tons of quartz, yielding 180,278 ozs., of the value
of £i21,112, or an average of over 11 dwts. per ton.
The total yield of gold from quartz veins and alluviums cannot
be given completely, but the quantities of gold purchased by the
several Banks at Bendigo, according to the records kept in the
Government Sub-Treasury, at Sandhurst, from November, 1851, to
31st December, 1885, amount to 10,402,785 ozs.
Approximate estimate of the quantity of gold taken away
privately to Melbourne and to other places is 4,000,000 ozs.,
showing altogether a grand total of about 14,000,000 ozs., or 431
tons, of the value of £57,000,000.
As it may be of interest to state what is being done on this
goldfield in late years, the gold disposed of to the banks in this
district in 1883, 1884, and 1885, amounts to 655,129 ozs., value,
£2,620,516, showing a daily average of £2845, allowing 307
working days in the year, the value of the gold sold elsewhere is
not included. As the ground under lease and being worked is
only 4800 acres, or less than eight square miles, this return ought
to lead to the enquiry : will gold-mining pay upon the balance of
one thousand and ninety-two square miles, or 699,000 acres ? This
is a question worthy of consideration by manufacturers, merchants,
shipowners, and others, who believe that a deficient supply of gold
acts injuriously upon the general prosperity of the nation.
As the opening up of this immense field, which has produced


and is still producing gold in large quantities at points many
miles apart; and which has not been properly prospected, or ever
likely to be with our limited population, is surely worthy of
attention, seeing that it can only be undertaken by numbers, with
reasonable capital.
Particulars relating to Mining Companies at Sandhurst, the
produce of whose Mines is represented by gilded cubes
now in the Exhibition.
In August last the president of the Sandhurst School of Mines
(Mr. Alexander Bayne) placed before the Administrative Council
of the School a scheme, by which a substantia] idea of the wealth
of the Bendigo Goldfield might be presented to the people of
Great Britain at the forthcoming Colonial and Indian Exhibition
in London.
The proposal, which was warmly taken up, was that the various
public mining Companies should be applied to, requesting them to
furnish particulars of the amounts of paid-up capital, the yields of
gold, and the dividends paid by each Company; and that they
should be inscribed on cubes representing in size the masses of
gold respectively taken from the mines of such Companies.
A deputation was appointed to wait upon Mr. Levien, the
Minister of Mines, to ask for the assistance of the Government in
carrying out the design, out of the funds provided for Exhibition
purposes. Mr. Levien, who expressed himself in favor of the
preparation of such an exhibit, at once acceded to the request, and
promised also that an explanatory pamphlet, to be furnished by the
Council of the School, should be printed at the Government expense.
Applications were then made to a large number of Companies
for the required information, and the comparatively few that
responded have had the cubes prepared, with inscriptions upon


pui icu. xiib names ui lub eumpames to wmcn tne accompanying
table applies can be seen upon the cubes or the photographs of same.

them setting forth, in a condensed form, the history of each.
The cubes are gilt, to represent solid cubes of gold. It is shown
that the amount of paid-up capital in these Companies—twenty-
seven in number—amounts to £437,631. The value of the gold
raised is £6,132,544; cost of machinery, £258,789; dividends
paid to 31st December, 1885, £3,131,355. The approximate
value of these mines is set down at £2,000,000. The account
stands thus: £437,631 of outlay has produced £3,131,355 of
dividends, and mines of the approximate value of £2,000,000.
The subjoined statement will give intending gold producers
some idea of the amount of capital required to follow legitimate
gold mining. Mining machinery of all descriptions is manu-
factured upon the goldfield at a cheaper rate than it can be im-
ported. The names of the Companies to which the accompanying
table applies can be seen upon the cubes or the photographs of same.


The rent for the above Claims has been reduced from 10s. to
ss. per acre since the 18th December, 1885. The Claim of 430
acres is a freehold.
A map prepared by Mr. Walker, Government Surveyor,
showing the extent of ground held by the several Companies and
other important information, can be seen at the Victorian Court
of the Colonial and Indian Exhibition.
CLIMATE.
The Colony of Victoria is greatly favored as regards climate.
The mean temperature is 57.3° ; and the rainfall varies from
10 inches in the north-western parts —remote from the principal
goldfields—to 50 inches in the loftier ranges on the south and
north-east: the mean for several years being 26 inches.
Work is scarcely ever interrupted by the state of the weather.
All cereals, European vegetables, and fruits, flourish luxuriantly;
and more suitable soils and climate for the grape, the olive, the
orange, and the lemon, it would be difficult to find, if we exclude
the Cordillera, where there is often snow during the winter.
Over 700,000 gallons of wine, and nearly 3000 gallons of brandy
are made yearly in Victoria. More than 7300 acres are planted
with vines.
MINING DISTRICTS, &c.
The Colony is divided into seven Mining Districts, namely ;
Sandhurst, Ballarat, Beechworth, Maryborough, Castlemame,
Ararat, and Gippsland. The number of miners employed in
getting gold is, approximately, 29,182 —16,140 being engaged as
alluvial miners, and 13,042 as quartz miners. The numbei of
distinct auriferous quartz reefs, many of great length and
persistence, is over 3700. The value of the machinery employed
in alluvial mining is £343,000 ; and of that used in quartz
mining, £1,500,000. The salaries and wages paid per week to

managers, foremen, artisans, miners, and others, in the Bendigo
district, are as follows :
The Eight Hours system prevails; that is to say, men work 48
hours per week only.
Beef, mutton, flour, potatoes, and other necessaries, are
abundant and cheap ; this also applies to what are considered
luxuries.
Each miner can erect a dwelling for himself on a residence area
of one acre, acquired under the bye-laws; or he can rent a
comfortable house, at Sandhurst, upon easy terms. From the
Building Societies assistance can be obtained in erecting dwellings,
and their terms are equitable.
CITY OF SANDHURST.
'O ■♦■O l
The City of Sandhurst, the centre of the Bendigo Goldfield,
having a Mayor and a Council of 9, is situate on the Bendigo
Creek, a tributary of the river Murray. The mean height above
the level of the sea of the land within the municipal limits is 710


feet. The area under the control of the City Council is
acres; and it is safe to say that the whole’of this is auriferous.
The population of the City is 26,471; the municipal revenue is
£23,453 per annum ; the number of private houses is 6450 ; and
there are 30 churches, 10 state schools, 6 public halls, 8 banks,
excellent hotels, a theatre, an hospital, a benevolent asylum, a
school of mines, a mechanics* institute, and other important
buildings, amongst which may be mentioned particularly the
town hall and the new government offices, the latter costing
£45,000 ; both of them imposing and stately structures.
Some thirty years ago, when the site now occupied by the City
was covered with the tents of thousands of diggers, the main road,
now known as Pall Mall, was in winter almost a quagmire, and
in summer more than ankle-deep in dust. At the present time it
is a wide, well-formed, and well-kept street, adorned with fine
buildings, and many of the shops are superior to those seen
in the larger cities in England. The aggregate length of the
streets within the boundaries of the City is 94 miles; and more
than 78 miles are planted with deciduous and other trees, which
afford grateful shade in summer.
The streets are well-formed, are kerbed and channelled, the foot-
paths are asphalted, and they can be traversed during all portions
of the year with comfort. There are numerous reserves planted
with trees or laid out as ornamental gardens, with sheets of water
of some extent. Rosalind Park has an area of 66 acres, and is
a constant resort of the inhabitants, both in winter and summer ;
the Botanical Gardens occupy an area of 60 acres ; and the
Weeroona Park, with its lake, has an area of 46 acres. Lake
Weeroona is well suited for aquatic sports ; there are numerous
sailing and row boats on it; and it was on this lake that Hanlan
gave exhibitions of his skill as an oarsman.
The Sandhurst railway station, 100 miles from Melbourne, is


distant no more than a quarter of a mile from the General Post
Office ; and one can travel by rail to all the important cities and
towns in the Colony with ease and rapidity. The total length of
the railways in the Colony is 1598 miles. The time occupied in
travelling by rail from Melbourne to Sydney (New South Wales)
is nineteen hours. The railway connecting Melbourne with
Adelaide (South Australia) will be opened in a short time.
Sandhurst, with its fine buildings, wide streets planted with
trees, its extensive parks and gardens, its salubrious climate, and
its busy population, is a most desirable place, as a residence. No
stranger, occupying a dwelling in the City proper, would suppose
that he was in the centre of the greatest gold-producing area in
the world.
The visitor will find here people from nearly all parts of the
earth. The German, Danish, French, and Italian citizens are as
truly Australians as the English, Scotch, and Irish; and the
several organizations for the relief of the sick and feeble, and
associations of every kind, show that they can work together
harmoniously and cordially, without regard to .nationality.
BENDIGO GOLDFIELD.
.©-♦-O'
What may be properly designated the Bendigo goldfield occupies
an area of 1100 square miles, or 704,000 acres. Its centre is the
City of Sandhurst. Within this tract there are 272 quartz reefs,
which have been proved to be auriferous; but no more than 4800
acres are actually worked upon in the Sandhurst and Eaglehawk
Mining Divisions.
The gold raised at Sandhurst during the year 1885, was 215,908
ozs., of the value of £863,632. The number of Companies con-
tributing was over 130.


SUPPLY OF WATER.
Sandhurst is supplied with water from the Malmshury reservoir,
formed by an embankment across the river Coliban, and from
other smaller reservoirs near Sandhurst. The storage capacity of
the Malmshury reservoir is 2,841,000,000 gallons. The drainage
area is ample, and the supply could be largely increased at a small
expense. The water is conveyed by flumes and channels, (through
tunnels in solid rock in places) a distance of 42 \ miles; and
the aggregate length of all the channels, &c., connected with this
system of water supply is one hundred and fifty four miles. The
smaller subsidiary reservoirs have in the aggregate a storage
capacity of 1,380,902,206 gallons. Water is laid on to most of the
houses in the City, and a great quantity is used for mining
purposes. The cost of the waterworks was over <£1,000,000.
LIGHTING OF THE CITY.
The City is lighted with gas, and proposals have been made
which will probably result in the electric light being largely used
in the more crowded thoroughfares at no distant period.
Sandhurst is in communication with all parts of Australia by
means of the Electric Telegraph, and messages can be sent to, and
are received from, every part of the world to which the Telegraph
lines extend. The Telephone is in constant use in the City.
Merchants, Bankers, and many private persons, as well as mining
companies, subscribe to the Telephone Exchange, Some of the
larger mines are lighted with gas and others with the Electric
light. The Telephone is also used in the mines.
Sandhurst returns three members to the Legislative Assembly.
There are three daily newspapers, and most of the newspapers
circulating in the colonies, and the principal newspapers published
in the mother country as well as scientific and other publications
are filed in the reading room of the Mechanics Institute. There
are four free reading rooms in the City, having 10,000 volumes of
works, and each is supplied with newspapers and periodicals.
There is a postal delivery three times a day.


SCHOOL OF MINES.
.©-♦-o
The Bendigo School of Mines and Industries was established in
Sandhurst on the 21st April, 1873, for the following purposes,
viz :—(a.) To impart sound instruction in the various branches of
science connected with mining operations ■ to instruct students in
the theory and practice of mining, the management and safe
conduct of mining works, mine surveying, and mining engineering •
and to afford the means of students acquiring such a knowledge
of geology, mineralogy, physical geography, meteorology and
ethnology, as will fit them to pursue independent inquiries in these
several branches of science, (b.) To teach chemistry and chemical
physics, metallurgy, and assaying, materia medica, biology and
botany. (c.) Arithmetic, mathematics, algebra, euclid, trig-
onometry, mensuration, gauging, conic sections, astronomy,
geodesy, mechanics, surveying, drawing and plotting from field
books j mechanical and architectural drawing, practical geometry,
freehand drawing from the flat and round, and from nature ;
illuminating and decorative painting, mezzo-tinting, linear per-
spective, insometrical projection, painting in oil and water colors,
lithography, photo-lithography, wood engraving, the use of tools
in trades, and modelling and carving, (d.) The ancient and
modern languages, (b.) Short-hand writing, telegraphy, the con-
struction and use of the telephone, and illumination by electricity.
(f.) Such other subjects as may from time to time be deemed
desirable. It is governed by a general council and an adminis-
trative council. There are ten lecturers and teachers, and the
number of students is over 500. Certificates are granted to
students in the several classes who successfully pass the prescribed
examinations. The fees payable by students are very small.


THE BOROUGH OF EAGLEHAWK,
Three miles from the Post Office, is connected with Sandhurst
by rail, and has a population of 7362, with 1497 inhabited
dwellings. Much has been done to improve the Borough ; and
there are some public buildings of importance.
MODE OF ACQUIRING AURIFEROUS LANDS.
Any one may apply to the Government for a lease of auriferous
or mineral lands. The largest area usually granted under lease
for gold-mining is 30 acres ; but, on obtaining special permission
from the Minister of Mines, a still greater extent of land may be
acquired. The greatest extent allowed for a lease of mineral
lands is 640 acres. The rent for a gold-mining area is five
shillings per acre per annum. The preliminaries necessary in
order to obtain a lease are simple, and clearly set forth in the
Orders-in-Council. The term is usually 15 years, subject to
renewal if desired by the lessee. Leases of private lands may be
obtained under conditions.
Bye-laws are framed by the Mining Boards, each consisting of
ten members, elected annually by the miners, under which
auriferous lands may be acquired by any one, whether the holder
of a miner’s right or not. The miner’s right, which costs five
shillings, is in force for twelve months, and gives security to the
miner who takes up auriferous land under the Bye-laws. The
areas granted under the Bye-laws in the Sandhurst District are
as follows: —
On Quartz reefs.—Ordinary Claim, 100 yards by 150 yards, two
men; Prospecting Claim, 200 yards by 150 yards, two men;
Special Claim, 320 yards by 150 yards, two men for the first six
months ; afterwards, one man for every 40 yards.
Alluvial Claims.— 3s feet by 35 feet for one man ;or 70 feet
by 70 feet for four men.


If the sinking be over 50 feet in depth, 70 feet by 70 feet are
allowed for two men ;or 100 feet by 100 feet for four men. In
wet sinking a claim of 100 yards by 200 is allowed in some cases-
Sluicing Claims are 200 yards by 100 yards for four men. No
rent.
No sum, beyond that paid for the miner’s right, is charged for
lands held under the Bye-laws. Nothing is charged for rent. An
area of one acre is allowed for a residence; and one quarter of an
acre for a business site. Miners can obtain licences or permits
authorising them to take and divert water for mining purposes.
The area held under gold-mining leases in the Sandhurst
Division is about 3700 acres. On the leased lands there are 3200
men employed ; and 350 men work in alluvial Claims.
The accompanying tables serve to indicate to what extent gold-
mining is carried on in the Sandhurst Division ;

There is an act in force in Victoria ( Regulation of Mines
Statute) providing for the protection of miners and those engaged
in mining; and inspectors of mines report on all accidents.
Trained mining managers, with foremen acting under them, have
the control of the mines.
Moneys are voted yearly for prospecting for new goldfields. A
large area of the colony is as yet unprospected. Important
discoveries are made from time to time, many of which enrich the
discoverers. Clearing land, cutting drains, removing timber, and
the like operations frequently reveal the extension of valuable
gold bearing reefs. Diamond drills provided by the Government
have proved of great value in ascertaining the course of auriferous
leads , or ancient river channels. In the beds of these ancient
channels quartz reefs are found outcropping, and when the drifts
are exhausted these can be worked often to great profit.
It is believed that diamond drills, having a diameter of three
inches, would be useful in discovering the existence of quartz reefs,
and such drills, no doubt, will shortly be brought into use. The
diamond drill can be used underground as well as on the surface,
and if the same principles were adopted here as in America, it is
confidently anticipated that this appliance would ultimately
largely benefit quartz miners. The bore can be directed
vertically, horizontally, or at any angle, and with one of large
diameter, there would be under proper management, little or no
deflection.
Pyrites (sulphide of iron), rich in gold, occur in the quartz reefs,
and the Colony maintains 32 establishments for the treatment of
pyrites, where nearly 200 men are employed. There are five
such establishments at Sandhurst, and in one the chlorination
process as well as the ordinary method is employed.
MINERALS AND METALS OTHER THAN GOLD.
Silver, Copper, Lead, Tin, Antimony, Iron, Chrome Iron,
Bismuth, Blende, Cobalt, Manganese, and Molybdenite, are found


in some places. The value of the Antimony, Tin, Copper, &c.,
exported annually is considerable. There are more than 280 men
employed in mining for minerals and metals other than Gold, and
there are six smelting works giving employment to 200 men.
Lignite is abundant and of excellent quality. Small thin seams
of Coal occur in the “ false Coal measures ” of Victoria, but they
have nowhere been worked to a profit. In the true Mesozoic
Carbonaceous rocks of Hew South Wales there are valuable
seams of Coal, some of which are over thirty feet in thickness.
Miscellaneous Notes relating to the Colony of Victoria and
the Sandhurst Goldfield.
NUGGETS OF GOLD.
On the sth February, 1869, two miners named John Deason
and Richard Oates, found a remarkable nugget of nearly pure
gold, barely covered with earth, which weighed 2280 ozs., its
value at the Bank of England being £9534. It was unearthed
near Dunnolly, a locality 32 miles west of Sandhurst. This
nugget was named “The Welcome Stranger.”
“ The Welcome Nugget,” found at Bakery Hill, Ballarat, on
the 15th June, 1858, weighed 2217 ozs. 16 dwts. and was sold for
£10,500.
“The Blanche Barkly,” found near Kingower, on the 27th
August, 1857, weighed 1743 ozs. 13 dwts., and when melted in
London was of the value of £6905 12s. 9d.
A nugget weighing 1619 ozs., of the value of over £6OOO, was
found in Canadian Gully, Ballarat, on the 31st January, 1853.
Two nuggets, found at Dunolly in 1857, weighed 2952 ozs.;
value, when freed from quartz, <kc., £5500.
Other nuggets, weighing respectively 1286 ozs., 1177 ozs., 1158
ozs., 1117 ozs., 1034 ozs., 1011 ozs., 1008 ozs.; and a great number,
particulars of which are given in printed records, ranging from a


few ounces to many pounds in weight, have been found on the
Victorian goldfields by working miners. Nuggets of nearly pure
gold, weighing 500 ozs. and more, have been unearthed in shallow
ground on the Bendigo goldfield, as for instance :

GOLD MINING COMPANIES.
While there is always too much business done in buying and
selling shares—as there must be on the richest goldfield of the
world— Sandhurst offers unusual facilities for the prospecting and
proper working of mines. Miners from the old country can at
once, and without difficulty, obtain a perfect title to an area of
auriferous land, either under the Bye-laws (at a very small cost),
or under lease; and they can work the alluviums, which are in
the Sandhurst Division, shallow, either with a “ windlass ” or a
“whim.” When, having sunk their shaft, gold is discovered,
simple appliances for washing can easily be procured, and skilled
labor to assist, if necessary.
When a quartz reef is opened, with the like simple ap-
pliances, they can send their quartz to be crushed at public
mills; or they can themselves erect a crushing plant, either on a
very small or on a large scale. There are several foundries at
Sandhurst, where machinery of all kinds and of the best
description is manufactured.


OTHER MANUFACTORIES.
Railway plant, railway carriages, and rolling stock of every
kind, are made at Sandhurst, as well as carriages for the road.
There is a pottery where some excellent ware is manufactured.
There are several breweries and fellmongery works; and
establishments for the making of leather, soap, candles, &c., are
carried on with success, giving employment to a large number of
persons.
WINES.
At the numerous and extensive vineyards in the near neighbor-
hood of Sandhurst, excellent wines are made, which are highly
appreciated, not only in the Colony, but also in Europe and in
India. The Sandhurst wines have been awarded prizes at all the
great Exhibitions in the Colonies and in Europe.
LAND UNDER CULTIVATION.
The Government Statist reports, that in 1884 there were, in
the Colony of Victoria, 1,104,392 acres under wheat; 188,161
acres under oats ; 46,382 acres under barley ; 40,195 acres under
potatoes ; 302,957 acres under hay ; and 286,866 under green
forage. These are the principal crops ; but there are raised in
the Colony, amongst other valuable products, hops, beet, carrots,
tobacco, opium poppies, olives, mustard, canary seed, mulberry
trees, medicinal herbs, maize, flax, chicory, broom millet, &c, As
already stated, all European vegetables and European fruits, and
fruits of warmer climates, reach the highest perfection.
VISITORS.
It is very desirable that persons who visit the Colony of
Victoria in search of information, should so arrange as to remain
for a few days or a week in Sandhurst, in order that they may
examine the mines and the public institutions, and verify the
statements contained in this pamphlet.


BENDIGO QUARTZ REEFS.
It is scarcely possible, by any verbal description, to convey a
correct idea of the surface features of the Bendigo goldfield.
There are what may be termed main dividing ridges (all of them
very low), and at various angles to these are subordinate, still
lower, ridges forming innumerable small drainage basins. The
gullies trend towards the Bendigo Creek and other streams, and
there are in places wide flats where the gullies unite. The first
gold was got beneath the surface soil of the ridges, and in the
gullies, the depth of sinking in the latter varying from 2 feet to
11 feet. The auriferous drift lying on the bed-rock was of
almost fabulous richness, and all the gold in it was derived
from the quartz reefs at the head of the gullies, a fact not at that
time known to ordinary miners. A not very large tub of “ wash-
dirt, as the auriferous drift is called, yielded sometimes as much as
100 ozs. of gold, the result of the work of a few hours, and yields of
5 ozs. 10 ozs. 20 ozs. and 25 ozs. per tub were not regarded as
remarkable in 1851, 1852 and 1853. The miners, or to speak
more correctly, the “diggers,” wandered through the tree-clad
ranges on Sundays and holidays, and they noticed huge blocks of
white quartz protruding from the ground, or lying on the slopes,
and in these masses of rock they saw gold. They broke up the
quartz and selected the pieces showing most gold and kept them
as “specimens.” Soon it became apparent that it would be
profitable to break up the quartz with hammers, and get the gold
by washing it. Then it occurred to one intelligent person to use
the “dolly ’ for crushing, an appliance consisting of a log of wood
shod with iron, and suspended from a sapling over a stump. This
was followed by a rude stamping machine furnished with a grating,
the gold being obtained by cradling. Better stampers were
subsequently brought into use, a steam engine, instead of horses,
was employed to move the stampers, and quicksilver was placed
in wells over which the crushed quartz was made to pass.


This was the condition of things thirty-two years ago. Improve-
ments were made from time to time, the wooden stamps were
replaced by wrought iron shanks, copper plates, blankets and
barrels were added, and the methods of reducing quartz were
gradually advanced, until very complete plants, some consisting of
ninety-six stamps, moved by excellent machinery, were erected.
Many years ago reefs were opened in the neighbourhood of
Bendigo, which were found to yield as much as 1 oz., 2 ozs., and
more per ton, but at that time they could not be profitably
worked, as the cost of transport to the few crushing mills then
erected, and the expense of crushing and treatment was so great.
Now, while the land intersected by such reefs can be taken up
by anyone, the circumstances are very different. A battery of
four stamps can be rented at the rate of 2s. per hour, and each
stamp-head will crush per diem of twenty-four hours from one ton
to two tons and three quarters of quartz.
The quartz veins intersect mud-stones, clay-stones, shales, and
fine sandstones of Silurian age. The rocks are unaltered, except
in the vicinity of the granite,* but they are plicated and folded,
and the quartz is found commonly in the form of saddles—the
quartz has aggregated, in fact, on the anticlinals, generally one
saddle beneath the other, and continuing to depths unknown.
The quartz is in many cases highly mineralised. The strike of
the rocks varies from N. 15° W. to N. 32° W. ; and the general
strike of the reefs or veins is N. 22° W., though many depart
largely from this direction.
* A mass of granite, from five to twelve miles in width, extends from the
river Coliban, on the east, to the river Loddon, on the west. It is supposed
to be completely metamorphosed sedimentary strata. It is usually a ternary
granite, consisting, of quartz, felspar, and mica. It separates the Castlemaine
goldfield from that of Sandhurst. The alluvial deposits of “ Forest Creek ”
(Castlemaine) were exceedingly rich, and at one time there were nearly
30,000 miners working there. The quartz reefs are rich, and one has been
aptly but curiously described as “a bed of gold-mines.” The granite affords
excellent building material, is highly ornamental; and blocks, homogeneous
throughout, can be obtained of enormous dimensions.


There are three principal lines of reefs at Sandhurst, namely :
The ‘Hustler’s,” the “Garden Gully,”and the “Hew Chum
and Victoria ”; the distance between the summits of the anti-
clihals being about, on an average, 2600 feet. A map of the
surface shows the reefs outcropping on these lines ; but it must
not be supposed that the saddles present very close uniformity,
or are symmetrical. The metalliferous belts are, however,
continuous, and extend for great distances, whether they are
characterized by a succession of saddles, isolated blocks of quartz,
or strings, or veins.
In the early days of quartz-mining, at Sandhurst and elsewhere,
the miners followed the quartz on the underlie; but at the present
time there are vertical shafts over 2000 feet in depth, and from
levels varying from 1660 feet to 1760 feet, quartz has been raised
of exceptional richness; small parcels have yielded as much
as 7 ozs., 8 ozs., 4 ozs. 5 dwts. 17 grs., and 18 ozs. 2 dwts.
21 grs. per ton. All the shafts, it is needless to say, are well-
timbered ; the machinery and appliances are of the most excellent
description; and with “safety cages” and arrangements to prevent
overwinding, the miner can pursue his labors in comparative
comfort.
It is not necessary to inform the English reader that there are
no explosive gases in our mines; and such accidents as those
which occur in coal mines, sometimes involving the loss of
hundreds of lives, cannot occur here. Prospecting below the
surface, the driving of levels and crosscuts, winzes, &c., are
costly; but in a well-managed mine—and some could be men-
tioned from which tons of gold have been raised-necessary
“ dead work ” is carried on concurrently with the work of breaking
down auriferous stone. The best class of mining managers would
lefuse to “pick the eyes ” out of a mine.
There are large areas of ground near Sandhurst which have
never been touched. Between the most northern gold-producing


claim on the New Chum line of reef, and a locality known as
Sebastian, where the “Frederick the Great” mine is situated, a
distance of seven miles, there is a tract of country which is as surely
auriferous as the reefs that are now yielding gold so largely. At
Ray wood, six miles northward of Sebastian, a valuable discovery
was made quite recently. Between the river Campaspe on the
east, and the river Loddon on the west, and northward of the
granite to the margin of the Murray tertiaries, there is an area of
over twelve hundred miles which only awaits development as a
gold-producing tract. Even on the well-known lines of reefs,
there are between the mines now producing gold, lands which are
lying dormant, and which could be opened up by men with
the necessary capital.
On the Myrtle Creek, a tributary of the river Coliban, only
sixteen miles from Sandhurst, an important discovery of gold was
made lately by a Mr. Pilcher, who, in grubbing his land laid bare
a quartz reef, which yielded 10 ozs. of gold to the ton.
The Mosquito, Axe, Emu, and Sheepwash creeks, tributaries of
the river Campaspe, from five to eighteen miles from the city, all
flow through Silurian rocks intersected by quartz reefs, which,
though now partially neglected, yielded in many cases thousands
of pounds worth of gold. This area would be quickly opened up if
its resources were made known. Indeed the chances of new finds
of gold are as good as ever they were, and men with a capital of
£2OO or £3OO could take up claims with prospects of success
which rarely present thepaselves in other mining countries.
It is unnecessary to describe the methods of opening up a reef.
If these words are read by a miner, he will understand at once
in what manner he should go to work and if not a miner, no
verbal description would enlighten him. He must come to the
mines and see things for himself. It may be encouraging,
however, to state that many of our most successful quartz miners


were bred to other pursuits, and have acquired the knowledge
they possess on the Victorian goldfields.

RECREATION.
A Bowling Club, a Lawn Tennis Club, Football and Cricket
Clubs, Cycling Clubs, and other organized bodies for affording
recreation, are highly prosperous.
The Sandhurst Sheep and Cattle Yards stand on about six acres
of land, granted by the Crown to the City Council for that
purpose, in the year 1861.
Yards, offices, house for inspector, and abattoirs, are erected by
the Council, at a cost of about £12,000 —expenditure extending
over a term of years, as necessity required—and are now in such
a complete state that about £2OO a year will keep them in repair
for the next ten years.
The business done through the Yards during the year 1885
(about an average year) was as follows ;—28,727 cattle; 271,844
sheep; 16,469 pigs ; of the estimated value of £280,000. Clear
of all expenses, the revenue derived from the Yards amounts to
about £2lOO.
COST OF BUILDINGS.
The public buildings in Sandhurst are of a substantial and
generally of an ornate character. The public offices, having a fine
tower, with a clock for which £l5OO was paid, cost £45,000 ;
the town hall, £28,000; the principal theatre, £14,000; the
banks, eight in number, from £4OOO to £9OOO each; and the
Masonic Hall, £BOOO. Many private residences, in Sandhurst,
standing within well-kept grounds, with sloping lawns, and well-
planted with the magnolia, oleander, rose, rhododendron, datura,
orange, lemon, cedars, pines, and other exotics, attest the wealth
and taste of the proprietors.


EFFECTS OF THE INCREASE OF THE YIELD OF
GOLD.
In the Queen’s speech on the opening of Parliament on 21st
January, reference was made to the dulness of trade in Great
Britain. The development of the goldfields, leading to a greater
production of gold, would, as happened over 35 years ago, give an
impulse to manufactures and commerce which would result in
profitable employment being available to many thousands of
persons. The production of all necessaries would be facilitated ;
increased carriage on sea and land would beneficially affect
shipping and railways, and, with abundance of gold, every branch
of trade would revive, and following such revival, prosperity,
peace, and contentment would prevail where in many places there
is now poverty with discontent and disorder.
Over-populated countries would be relieved, and new avenues
for the safe investment of capital and for the employment of
labor would be opened up.
The following Claims are all represented by cubes at the
Colonial and Indian Exhibition, and may be seen at the
Victorian Court.
UNITED WHIP AND JERSEY COMPANY.
Capital paid up, £10,400.
This Company represents an amalgamation of some of the
richest claims of the earliest days. Like most of the other claims
which were rich in the early days, it was abandoned for a time,
after the first formations were worked out, owing to the general
belief at that period—but long since dispelled—that to sink any
deeper would be but waste of money.


The ground was first worked in 1856, and the area held by the
present Company was then held by thirteen Claims. The records
show that the total amount of gold raised by these Companies
reached the enormous total of 291,600 ozs., valued at £1,166,400,
independent of that of which no record is kept. The most
successful Companies were: the North Whip, which, from 160
yards of ground, got 66,000 ozs. gold ; the Old Whip, which got
from 80 yards, 61,000 ozs. gold; the Elliotts’, which, from 33 yards,
obtained 40,000 ozs; and the Jersey, which, from 40 yards, got
36,000 ozs. The Elliotts’ Claim was at one time sold for £BO, and
in a few weeks afterwards the lucky purchaser got £3OOO worth
of gold from it.
The present Company was formed by amalgamation, in October,
1880. So far they have only obtained 1830 ozs. gold ; but they
have erected machinery of sufficient power to enable them to
prospect for the second formation of reefs, which has been proved
to exist in other portions of the district; and by the exercise of
perseverance the glories of this locality may soon be revived. The
Company holds a lease of 66 acres 1 rood and 11 perches, for
which they pay to the Government an annual lease rent of £l6
11s. 4d.
NEW ST. MUNGO COMPANY, NO LIABILITY.
Capital paid up, £6300. Dividends, £17,100.
Though this Company’s Claim is directly on the line of the
leading reef in the district, and in the centre of two rich portions
of that line, it was, up to within a few years back, regarded as
being of no value whatever. The reason of this was that between
the two portions named there is a gap of about a mile in length,
on which no outcrop of a reef, or other indication of the existence
of a reef, was visible. A few weak efforts at exploration not
giving any encouragement, it was generally conceded that the
locality was barren. However, some few years ago, in 18/9, it


was decided, in consequence of some encouraging developments
further north, that a thorough trial should be given to the ground,
and a strong Company was formed. They took up a Claim of 11
acres 3 roods and 26 perches, for which, by the way, they pay the
Government the annual reduced rent of £2 19s. 6d.
At first their efforts were unrewarded, but by perseverance they
managed, in 1883, to get payable stone at about 600 feet. They
thus proved that though there was no indication near the surface,
the reefs form deeper down.
This was the result attending the expenditure of £6300, which
was the amount of capital called up. They have since proved the
existence of large bodies of payable stone, which are now being
opened up. They have obtained 12,184 ozs. gold, and paid
£17,100 in dividends, besides erecting machinery valued at £3OOO,
The success of this Company caused great activity on the
remainder of the supposed “barren” area, which is now being
worked energetically. There are numbers of similar places in
Sandhurst, both on the northern and southern extensions of this
and other reefs, which, likewise, only require the expenditure of
capital for their successful development.
THE LAZARUS COMPANY.
Capital paid up, £13,500. Dividends, £51,750.
The ground held by this Company was one of the first localities
on the goldfield, and one of the most successful. The ground was
taken up about 1854 by Messrs. Gibbs and Lazarus, after the
latter of whom the Company is named.
The locality, which stands upon a boldly defined hill, was a
striking one. Upon the surface huge blocks of quartz jutted out,
and the alluvial diggers of the early days used to make a Sunday


pastime of knocking off lumps of quartz with a hammer, and
pounding them up to get the gold. Even this crude method of
separating the precious metal from the matrix paid the diggers
well for their exertions.
When quartz mining was commenced in earnest the quartz was
battered up by a stamper worked by a windmill, the appliances
generally being little better than barbarous when compared with
the great labor-saving and economical machinery used in the
present day. The large blocks of stone on the surface gave a
large amount of gold, the proprietors reaping handsome profits;
and, when the shaft was sunk, every successive level proved of
great richness.
After a few years Mr. Lazarus became sole proprietor, and
continued to work the mine with great vigor, reaping a very
large fortune from it.
About 1878, when Mr. Lazarus had worked the mine down to
about 900 feet, he decided to sell the claim to a public Company.
It was accordingly divided into two parts, and formed into two
Companies: the Lazarus, and the Lazarus No. 1 (mentioned here-
after). The price which he received was £65,000 ; and it is
estimated that Mr. Lazarus previously derived from the mine
itself a profit of at least £300,000, making £365,000 in all from
this ground ; and it must be recollected that this profit would
have been much greater had the treating of the quartz been as
cheap in the early days as it is now, instead of being nearly twenty
times as great.
Since its formation into a public Company, the Lazarus has
proved the richness of the ground below Mr. Lazarus’ workings,
and has produced 28,660 ozs. of gold, and paid no less thap.
£51,750 in dividends. The capital actually paid up is £13,500.
The Company holds 21 acres of ground, and pays an annual lease
rent of £5 7s. 9d. to the Government. It possesses machinery
valued at £BOOO.


This Company is unique as the only one possessing underground
steam machinery in the district, a winding plant being erected in
a large chamber 1000 feet below the surface, to haul from a blind
shaft. Their total depth below the surface is about 1690 feet.
THE LAZARUS Ho. 1 COMPANY.
Capital paid up, £13,500. Dividends, £75,375.
Most of the remarks in the above apply equally to this
Company, as it was part of Mr. Lazarus’ original Claim. Both
Companies now work with the same machinery and from the
same shaft. The Lazarus Ho. 1 Company has obtained since
registration, 37,450 ozs. of gold, and has paid dividends amounting
to £75,375 since it was formed into a public Company. The
Capital actually paid up is £13,500. The dividends paid from
this and the Lazarus Companies’ Claims, together with the profit
estimated to have been obtained by Mr. Lazarus, shows the ground
to have yielded in 30 years the enormous profit (over all working
expenses and upon a very small capital) of £492,125.
THE HEW CHUM RAILWAY COMPANY.
Capital paid up, £13,873. Dividends, £31,817.
The history of this Company—situated as it is nearly at the
south end of the present workings on the Hew Chum line—is of
especial interest in view of the suggestions for working this line
further south. Some 18 or 20 years ago the idea of working the
reef so fr.r south as the Hew Chum Railway was ridiculed, as it
was thought the reef died out before it reached this point. It
was soon proved, however, by the expenditure of some capital,
that not only did the line of reef continue, but that it was in
places very rich.
Some work was done in this locality as early as 1860; but it
was not for some years afterwards that anything of a definite
character was proved,


The original portion of the present Company was not formed
until 1871, when a claim was taken up 110 yards in length.
Messrs. W. D. C. Denovan and Piper were rival applicants for the
ground, which is part of a railway reserve, and eventually the
ground was divided between them, and a Company formed. The
shares were not held in much repute at first, and Mr. Denovan
gave away, to friends, shares which ultimately proved to be
worth £20,000.
The first reef was found 100 feet below the surface ; and they
subsequently worked to great advantage, paying, in a few years,
between £35,000 and £40,000 in dividends. After working for
some years they decided, in 1879 to enlarge the Claim by amal-
gamation, and they took in two or three claims to the south,
including the celebrated Rourke and Henderson’s Claim, which
had been working for some years on rich stone, which averaged
for a considerable time 17 and 18 ozs. per ton.
The dividends obtained from the Claim in a few years amounted
to £35,000. With the dividends paid by the smaller Companies,
the total amount of dividends paid from the ground now held by
the New Chum Railway Company was, before amalgamation,
£85,000. During the seven years since amalgamation the
Company produced 20,458 ozs. gold, and paid £31,817 in
dividends; making a total paid in dividends altogether of
£116,817
They possess machinery valued at £9OOO, and their shaft is now
nearly 1500 feet deep. This was from ground which in the early
days was not considered to be worth working. The next Claim
south, the Eureka, has been paying good dividends recently.
Further south, there are miles of unoccupied lands along the line
of this reef, and no doubt that, upon the expenditure of the
necessary capital a large amount of gold will be obtained.


THE CATHERINE UNITED COMPANY.
Capital paid up, £46,000. Dividends, £81,120.
This Company holds one of the largest areas in Bendigo—their
Claim comprising 59 acres 1 rood 39 perches, for which they pay
an annual lease rent to the Government of £l2 17s. 6d. The pro-
perty is a most valuable one in every respect, and long before the
Company was formed the ground laid the foundation of several
substantial fortunes for the owners of the small Claims in which
it was then held.
It was first worked early in the fifties, and a large number of
men did very well in working the surface formations. Sub-
sequently shafts were sunk, and the reefs followed down. There
were about sixteen Claims held by private parties, on the ground
now occupied by the Company. All these Claims paid well and
some were very rich, notably, “ The Dane,” “ Kimbers,” “ Farns-
worth’s,” “ Ellis’s,’ “ Cook’s,” and “ Chips,” the latter so named
on account of its owner being a carpenter. These parties all
worked large bodies of quartz, and some of the formations,
especially the runs of spurs, were very rich. One party is stated
to have picked out 100 ozs. gold from a bucketful of quartz, to
obtain which cost only about an hours labor.
Owing to the length of time which has elapsed since these
parties were at work, and most of the former owners being dead
or out of the Colony, it is difficult to estimate, at this period, the
amount of gold obtained by the various Claim-holders. But so
far as reliable records can be obtained, there is clear proof of the
production from this ground of 80,000 ozs. of gold, valued at
£320,000, by private owners, prior to 1861. Allowing for the
yields from claims of which the records are lost, the total yield
from this Claim, antecedent to the formation of the Company,
must have been at least 120,000 ozs., valued at £480,000; and
the only Claim-holders now residing here say this is a modest
estimate.


In 1861, owing to the necessity for sinking deeper and erecting
machinery, the various Claim-holders decided to amalgamate and
form a registered Company; since that date they have been
working from two shafts, both of which are very deep, the north
one being down about 1400 feet.
The workings of the Company have been on a most extensive
scale, but at a comparatively moderate expense, owing to the
excellence of their machinery, which is valued at £15,000. They
have obtained, since the formation, 95,000 ozs. gold, valued at
£380,000 ; and have paid £Bl,OOO in dividends; the large amount
spent in opening up the mine to facilitate future operations, having
lessened the dividends.
NEW CHUM UNITED COMPANY.
Capital paid up, £1475. Dividends, £64,900.
The ground held by this Company has always been very pro-
ductive from the very earliest days of the goldfield. It was first
worked in 1853, in small 12 feet square claims. There was a large
reef on the surface, and in some places two of these 12 feet Claims
would lie abreast. The reef was very rich, although worked with
the most primitive appliances, and in one case 70 ozs. gold were
obtained from one bucketful of quartz.
A very large quantity of gold was got from this reef, of which
no reasonable estimate could be formed at this period. Subse-
quently the reef became poorer, and the returns would not stand
the enormous price of £7 10s. per ton then charged for crushing
the quartz (the charge is now about five or six shillings). For
some years the ground was idle ; subsequently a portion of the
present claim was taken up by Bonati and party, on the co-oper-
ative principle, the shareholders realising fortunes. Subsequently
Bonati’s Claim was formed into a Company, and paid £24,000 in
dividends.


The southern portion of the present Claim was held by the
New Chum Company, subsequently styled the Ellesmere Company.
This Company’s operations were at first unsuccessful and they let
the mine on tribute to Mr. Clarke Magee. He succeeded in
discovering a very rich reef, and took out a large amount of gold,
and from the tribute percentage the Company paid £36,000 in
dividends. Magee worked the reef at times 40 feet wide. Thus
the two Companies who formerly held the ground cleared £60,000
out of it, besides the enormous amount obtained by tributors and
private parties of which there is no record.
The two Companies were amalgamated in 1875, and now hold
16 acres (213 yards along the line of reef), and pay to the Govern-
ment £4 per year rent. They have been very successful and
have obtained upon the small paid up capital of £1475 the
splendid return of 42,450 ozs. gold, and paid £64,900 in dividends.
They have machinery valued at £6OOO, and their shaft is now
over 1450 feet deep.
NORTH OLD CHUM COMPANY.
Capital paid up, £24,975. Dividends, £84,036.
The ground held by this Company was worked by several parties
with good results on the surface, in 1855. Subsequently it became
the property of Mr. John Wybrants, who worked large bodies of
stone from the surface down to about 250 feet. He worked it
thirteen years and retired with a fortune. Some of the stone he
crushed was very rich, yielding as high as 29 ozs. per ton. Up to
1871, when the present Company was formed, the ground yielded a
lot of gold; but, owing to the original proprietor being dead, the
exact amount cannot be ascertained. The materials available,
however, showed that the previous owners derived a profit of at
least £40,000 from the Claim.
The present registered Company was formed in 1871, and
bought Mr. Wybrants out. During that time they have worked


energetically, and discovered several payable bodies of stone.
Their shaft is now down nearly 1800 feet.
During 14 years they have, upon an actually paid-up capital of
£24,975, obtained 39,930 ozs of gold, valued at £159,720, and
have paid £84,036 in dividends. They have machinery valued at
£4OOO, and capable of sinking to 3000 feet. Their area is 2 acres
1 rood 23 perches, and their rent the merely nominal one of 12s.
Id. per annum.
THE NIL COMPANY.
Capital paid up, £4062. Dividends, £8437 10s.
This Company is the leading one of one of the many auriferous
localities immediately outside the central group in and around
the city. It is situated at Haywood, where comparatively little
work is doing at present, though there were several rich mines
there some years ago.
Attention was first drawn to this locality about 1860, at which
time the ground now worked by the Nil was first taken up by
the Nil Desperandum Company. This Company was successful
and worked at several levels down to 316 feet. They obtained
about £50,000 worth of gold, and paid £16,000 in dividends.
After working about seven or eight years they abandoned the
Claim, as the stone had got poor and would not pay in those
expensive times.
The ground lay idle till 1879, when a new Company, under the
abbreviated title of “ The Nil,” was formed. After a brief period
of prospecting, and a total expenditure of £4062, they came upon
payable stone, and have since obtained 7370 ozs. of gold, valued
at £29,480, and have paid in dividends, £8437 10s., besides
adding materially to their machinery.


This is only one of the many instances in which work has been
profitably resumed in claims abandoned in the early days; and
there are numbers of such Claims, besides any quantity of new
ground, still available.
THE GARDEN GULLY UNITED COMPANY.
Capital paid up, £21,646. Dividends, £880,225.
This Company claims special notice, as it is the greatest and
most remarkable success in the 33 years history of quartz mining
in the district. In less than 27 years a profit of over a million
sterling has been derived from the 620 yards in length held by
this Company, over and above all expenses. The total value of
the gold obtained was much higher, as in the early days wages
were double, and crushing many times over present rates.
The history of this ground furnishes another remarkable
instance of the great riches which were to be ultimately obtained
from ground which was at one time regarded as valueless ; and
there is no doubt but that in the many miles of reef-country now
waiting exploration, many similar instances will occur.
In the “ fifties,” when quartz mining was first got into full
swing, the situation of the present Garden Gully United Company
was passed over by thousands of prospectors as being unworthy
of any expenditure of time and labor. Reefs had been worked
for some years before any miners were found adventurous enough
to go in for prospecting here ; eventually, however, it was taken up
in a number of small Claims j the chief of these was known as
Ladams.’ A Claim owned by Mr. John Lomasney, and known as
the Rainbow, had struck a reef showing gold, and Ladams’ party
made an effort to reach it. Not being very decided in their faith,
they soon stopped ; however, anew partner was, in the year 1861,
introduced—Mr. Ashley, a tradesman in the locality—and the
party then consisted of Messrs. Ashley, Goodwin, Gordon,


Ladams, and Anderson. Mr. Ashley endeavoured to get them
to go to work, but unsuccessfully at first, ultimately he succeeded,
with outside influence, in securing a resumption of work. The
shaft was sunk to 90 feet, and after driving 50 feet, they dis-
covered, not the reef they were looking for, but a new reef entirely,
known after as Ladams’ reef. Their first crushing was at Grant and
Stephens machine, Happy Valley, and went 3 ozs. per ton \ they
worked the reef 18 months, and got a lot of gold, and derived a
profit of £lBOO per man, or £9OOO in all. As the water was
getting troublesome, they accepted an offer from Mr. Geo. Lansell
—now the great Bendigo mining millionaire, but then just on the
road to success—to give a small engine for a sixth share. They
then went on prospecting, and made a few calls, but getting nothing.
Mr.,Lansell declined to go on. After some time it was decided to
float a public Company to work the ground : this Company to
take over several other Claims in addition to Ladams.’ The other
Claims were the “ Southern Cross ” (held by Mr. W. Waugh and
Dr. Boyd), “Lomasney’s Rainbow,” “Schmidt’s’Possum,” “H.
Johnson’s Claim,” and another Claim held by Wm. Johnson and
Barker, but afterwards bought by Mr. Ashley. Of these the
Rainbow was the only one which (in addition to Ladams’)
had obtained much gold.
The new Company was formed in 1865, and did some little
prospecting. They had given Ladams’ Party 1000 paid-up shares
for the machinery. They worked Ladams’ reef in the “ ’Possum ”
ground, and got 8 dwts. of gold per ton. After prospecting awhile,
many of the shareholders would not pay the calls ; thousands of
these shares were forfeited and sold, and in many cases would not
bring the amount of a three-penny call. Investors of those days
not dreaming of the fortunes they were throwing away. The
Company found it impossible to carry on, and in 1868 the mine
was let on tribute. The tributors, after a good deal of work,
succeeded in getting on to a remarkably rich reef at 300 feet.


Portion of the Claim was let to the Garden Gully Tribute No. 1,
who in turn sub-let portions to the No. 2,3, and 4 Tributes.
The history of these Tributes was of a sensational charactei,
the yields being enormous. The No. 1 Tribute crushed 9033 tons
of stone for 17,144 ozs. gold, and paid 275. 6d. per share in
dividends. The No. 2 Tribute crushed in about a year 3573 tons
for the magnificent yield of 24,474 ozs. gold, and paid 595. 6d.
per share, or <£70,656 ss. The No. 3 Tribute crushed 2898 tons
for 17,709 ozs., and paid 435. per share, or £51,062 10s. in
dividends. The No. 4 Tribute paid £6531 55., and the Rainbow
Tribute, £9500 in dividends. These dividends were in addition
to paying 171 per cent tribute to the parent Company.
The total capital called up by the whole of the Tribute
Companies was £12,666, and the total dividends paid by them,
£220,875.
In 1874 the Tributors’ terms expired, and the Company
resumed work. The large yields of gold which had been obtained
put new life into mining in the district, and the maiket value of
the Garden Gully line alone rose from £5OOO to £1,000,000.
The Company resumed possession of the ground in 1874, and
have been paying dividends ever since ; the profits to date being
£672,016. The amount called up by the Company prior to
getting dividends was only £21,646, so that the return for the
outlay was enormous. The total amount of gold raised since the
Company was started was 287,872 ozs., valued at £1,146,1/5,
and the total dividends (Company and Tributes), £880,225.
The Company holds, on a capital of £26,800, 42 acres of
ground, rent now reduced to £lO 10s. They have machinery
valued at £lO,OOO.
There are many miles of country open for exploration, and
there is no reason why many such another Claim should not be
opened up.


SHENANDOAH COMPANY.
Capital paid up, £BBOO. Dividends, £41,600.
This has been one of the most energetic prospecting Companies
on the south end of the New Chum line, and it has been very
successful. The ground was first worked in about 1856 by private
parties who did well, working several payable blocks of stone
from the surface down to 300 feet. The whole claim was worked
for some time as a private one and no records of the amount of
gold obtained are now available. Portion of the southern end of
of the claim was however let to the Shenandoah Tribute Company,
which paid close on £15,000 in dividends.
The present Company was formed during the great mining
excitement of 1871, and immediately sunk the shaft further.
The Company proved a success at its inception almost, for, at
390 feet they opened up a large body of stone as much as 12 feet
wide and 160 feet high. From this stone they paid 17s.
per 32,000 th share in dividends.
Subsequently they discovered another payable reef at 450 feet
which continued down to 720 feet. At 877 feet they had another
good reef from which they paid 16s. per share in dividends.
They have since sunk the shaft to over 1500 feet, and are now
working two payable reefs at 1300 and 1500 feet respectively.
The Company has paid altogether (independent of what was
paid by previous proprietors prior to 1871) £41,600 in dividends,
upon a yield of gold of 43,777 ozs., valued at £175,108, and
upon a paid-up capital of £BBOO. They hold 13 acres, 2 roods,
26 perches, giving a length of about 120 yards along the line of
reef, and the lease rent paid annually to the Government is only
£3 9s.
THE NORTH SHENANDOAH COMPANY.
Capital paid up, £lBOO. Dividends, £34,500.
This Company holds portion of the Claim held by the previous
owners of the Shenandoah Company, and consequently its early


history is embraced in that of the Shenandoah Company. The
connection between the two Companies is still kept up, as they
work with the same machinery and from the same shaft. It is
rather a smaller claim than the Shenandoah, possessing only about
100 yards along the line of reef. It has worked all the reefs with
success equal and sometimes greater than that of the Shenandoah,
and has paid £34,500 in dividends. It has, since 1871, produced
14,074 ozs. of gold, and the capital called was only £IBOO. Prior
to this date, as a private Company, it paid £27,600 in dividends.
The lease rent is only £1 18s. 9d. per annum.
THE GARIBALDI COMPANY.
Capital paid up £9BOO. Dividends, £36,050.
This Company has been remarkably successful, considering the
very short time it has been in existence —barely six years.
Previous to its formation it was for many years in the hands of
Mr. Clarke Magee, who declined to make his returns known. So
far as can now be ascertained from reliable sources, his returns
from this mine were 15,000 ozs., valued at £60,000. There was,
doubtless, more gold than this obtained, but no reliable information
can be procured.
In 1880 the present Company was formed, in 28,000 shares,
which were taken up in a day or two, at 7s. 6d. each. Since then
the Company has worked a rich reef, about 700 feet, and obtained
17,000 ozs. gold, valued at £68,000, and has paid £36,050 in
dividends. They hold 1 acre freehold ground and 2| acres lease-
hold, and pay 12s. 6d. per annum lease rent. Their machinery is
valued at £6OOO. The capital actually called up is only £9BOO.
They are now working down to a depth of 1250 feet.
THE NEW CHUM CONSOLIDATED.
Capital paid up, £BOOO. Dividends, £93,000.
The ground held by this Company, situated about the centre of
the New Chum line of reef, has been rich, as most of the ground


in the locality has been at intervals, since first a pick was put in
the ground.
The ground was first taken up, in 1856,’by private owners, and
it remained in private hands, with many changes of individual
ownership, for fully 20 years. The reef was worked with great
success from the surface down to 100 feet, the returns varying
from 1 oz. to 9 ozs per. ton. Subsequently, when in the hands of
Mr. Menzies, good yields were obtained down to 200 feet and 300
feet.
From the start, when originally worked, up to the time when
the present Company was formed, fully 50,000 or 60,000 ozs.
of gold must have been obtained, and the profits derived by the
various private owners are calculated at over £lOO,OOO.
In the year 1876 the present Company was formed by the
purchase of the interest of the private owners. Some two or three
years after the formation the shareholders received a splendid
return for an infinitesimal outlay of £BOOO : they struck a reef at
660 feet, and worked it successfully down to 850 feet, obtaining
37,430 ozs. gold, and paying in a comparatively short time
dividends amounting to £93,000.
The Company has since sunk the shaft to over 1500 feet, and
appear to be coming on to dividend stone again. They have
hauling machinery valued at £5OOO. The area of the Claim is
17 acres; rent, £4 ss. per annum.
BELMONT AND SAXBY UNITED COMPANY.
Capital paid up, £2250. Dividends, £101,250.
The amount of gold which is credited to this Company, though
large, is but a small proportion of that which has actually been
taken out of the ground, as the present Company is only a few years
old, and a large amount of gold was taken out by the previous
proprietors.


This ground was first taken up on the 7th September, 185/,
when the hill upon which it stands was covered by a dense scrub,
whereas it does not now show a particle of vegetation. The
ground was all held by private parties, and one portion was
called the Belmont, after a coal mine in the old country, owned
by the Earl of Belmont, and in which some of the miners had
worked.
There were two reefs out-cropping on the surface, and these
paid the men well; subsequently they worked the reef down to
100 feet, and did well. Afterwards the ground was idle for a
time. In 1872 some tributes were let, with good results. The gold
obtained out of this portion of the ground cannot be definitely
stated, but so far as the official records go, they show a product
of 6424 ozs. gold, valued at £25,696 ; out of this the Company
paid £3500 in dividends, and the Tributors paid a considerable
sum, of which there is no record.
The other portion of the present claim was held by the Saxby
Company, but their records are not obtainable, though it is
estimated that they got nearly £20,000 worth of gold.
Prior to the formation of the present registered Company, there
was very little work done in the neighborhood, and mining
matters had been for some years in a state of stagnation. In the
year 1880, the Ellenborough Company, adjoining the Claim under
notice, discovered, by dint of perseverance in prospecting, a
payable reef, and this set all the other Companies going. At this
time the whole of the shares in from fifteen to twenty Com-
panies in this locality could have been obtained for a mere song,
and in fact in many of the Companies purchasers could not be
obtained at any price. In a few months, however, the market
value of these then almost worthless Claims rose to something
approaching a million of money. Under these circumstances the
private owners of the Belmont and Saxby claims decided to


amalgamate and form a public Company in 30,000 shares. They
readily placed the shares on the market at 10s. each, and at once
started operations.
The career of this Company is one of extraordinary success,
although it has only been six years in existence. They actually
called up only £2250 from the shareholders, and of this merely
nominal sum £l6OO was spent on machinery. In a few months
they got on to the gold, and in three years, upon the expenditure of
Is. 6d. per share, they returned £3 7s. 6d. per share in dividends,
or £101,250. They got altogether 38,534 ozs. gold, valued at
£154,136. The whole of the £101,250 in dividends was paid
from a small block 120 feet in length, and from 10 feet to 30 feet
wide.
The Company hold 2 acres 3 roods of ground, with 100 yards
along the line of reef; and pay only 13s. 9d., per year rent.
It is to be specially noted that less than seven years ago this
ground was considered to be almost valueless. There is any
amount of ground in the district at present available which is just
as likely to give a large fortune to prospectors. A moderate
capital and a little perseverance are the chief essentials.
THE UNITED HUSTLER’S AND REDAN COMPANY.
Capital paid up, £12,000. Dividends, £lll,OOO.
This Company holds a large area of ground on the Hustler’s
line of reef, and the ground upon which they are working was
very rich both in early days and in latter years. It was first
worked in 1853, when this line of reef was discovered, and it was
soon yielding its riches to the lucky digger in a most lavish
manner.
There are several parallel runs of stone on this portion of the
line, and they were all more or less rich when worked on
the surface by the owners of the small 12 feet and 24 feet Claims
allowed in those days.


As an instance of their richness, the Redan run of stone
yielded from sto 10 ozs. per ton; the Maiden run 6 ozs. per ton;
the Williamson reef as high as 200 ozs. per ton; the Bignell, 30
or 40 ozs. per ton ; and the Laplua, 18 or 20 ozs. per ton. The
latter Claim was called after the owner’s wife who used to haul
up with the windlass the rich golden ore broken by her
husband.
The stone at this time was all crushed with rudely constructed
dollies ; crushing batteries being then unknown. A “ dolly” was
made by providing the stump of a tree, upon which the quartz
was crushed by means of a stamp affixed to a handle working in
the fork of a tree. As a matter of course a very large proportion
of the gold was lost, and, on the Claim now under notice the
refuse from these crushings was afterwards treated and yielded
as high as 4 ozs. of gold to a small tin bucket.
After the private parties had worked for some time, larger
Companies were formed to work the ground below the surface.
The principal Claims thus formed now included in the United
Hustler’s and Redan, where, on the west side, the Redan,
McTavish and Wades, Ritchie, Alabama, Lady Darling, and
Hustler’s and Redan; and on the east side, Silk’s, Johnson’s,
Summerhill, Go-a-head, Fraser’s and European. (The Redan reef
it may be mentioned was so named owing to the news received
regarding the war in the Crimea).
Nearly all these Companies got a lot of gold, and some of them,
notably Johnson’s, Silk’s, the Redan, McTavish’s and others were
very rich. They got the water at 90 feet, and though some of
them worked down to 200 or 300 feet, they all found the
necessity a few years ago of amalgamating so as to put up more
powerful machinery, and thus the present Company was formed.
Owing to the very large number of Claimholders who formerly
had possession of the ground, most of whom are now dead, it is


difficult to obtain any accurate information with regard to the
amount of gold obtained, but from the records available and
information given by those connected with the Claim in the
eailiest days, it is certain that the yield of gold from various parts
of the piesent Claim, from the time it was first worked up to the
time the present Company was formed, was at least 250,000 ozs.
or 300,000 ozs.
The present Company was successful in the earliest stage of its
career. They put up machinery and started to work on a run of
stone, the top of which had been worked by one of the private
parties ; they soon struck rich gold, and in a couple of years got
out 42,000 ozs., valued at <£168,000, and paid dividends amounting
to £lll,OOO, and this upon a paid-up capital of £12,000. The
Company’s deepest shaft is now down 1050 feet. They hold 63
acres of ground, for which they pay £l5 15s. per year rent.
Though this ground has been so rich, there is a very large area of
ground almost immediately north available for exploration.
JOHNSON’S REEF GOLD MINES COMPANY.
Capital paid up, £72,100. Dividends, £130,119.
The Claim held by this Company was formerly held by a large
number of owners j the Cofnpany having, at various periods,
bought previous owners out, and thus enlarged their Claim until
now it is one of the largest in the district.
This ground was first taken up in 1853, when there were a
large number of 12 feet square Claims, from many of which very
good returns were obtained, though the ground was not so rich as
in the immediately adjoining Claims, from one of which the
enormous return of 2500 ozs. of gold from 5 tons of stone. The
general run of the surface stone in the Johnson’s was from an
ounce to a pound of gold per ton.


The present Company established themselves first, in 1858, on
the southern portion of their present Claim, and paid £34,000 for
the Claims they purchased during the early part of their history ;
and subsequently they acquired more property north, and pur-
chased Walker’s Claim, which was rich, for £20,000. In later
years they acquired a large Claim on the east, and known as the
Nelson.
Owing to the large number of hands through which various
portions of the property passed, prior to being bought up by
the Company, it is difficult to estimate the quantity of gold
obtained in the early days, but as far as reliable data is obtain-
able, it shows that private owners realised a profit of over
£120,000 ; so that they must have obtained some £300,000
or £400,000 worth of gold ; Walker’s Claim alone gave a profit
of about £30,000 before the Company bought it. The Nelson
also paid a good deal in dividends. Out of this portion of the
ground, in the early days, one lot of 20 tons of stone broken,
yielded 1050 ozs. gold ; and a small block of stone, left standing
on the boundary pending a survey, when broken down gave a
yield (though it did not weigh more than half a ton) of 1 1 8 ozs.
gold ; the returns fell off after this.
The Johnson’s Reef Company has been very successful since its
formation. It has produced gold valued at £462,182, and has
given dividends amounting to £130,199. Their paid-up capital
is £72,100, nearly the whole of which was for the purchase of
Claims. They hold an extensive lease of 70 acres, for which the
lease rent is £l7 10s. per annum.
FREDERICK THE GREAT TRIBUTE COMPANY.
Capital paid up, Dividends, /101,000.
This Company, whose gold production is represented by one of
the large cubes, is in possession of a Claim of 400 acres of
freehold property at Sebastian, 14J miles north-east of the City


of Sandhurst. From this Claim, they have as the cube shows,
raised gold amounting 102,713 ounces, valued at £410,855, from
which they have paid to the owners of the freehold, as a
percentage for the right to mine, £45,000, and to the shareholders
in dividends, £lOl,OOO.
Their machinery is valued at £30,000, and all this has been
accomplished upon a paid-up capital of £2600. but the gold
stated above does not nearly represent the total amount raised
from this property, for, prior to its formation into a public
Company, it was worked extensively and with very good results
by private owners, as a brief glance at its history will show.
A large portion of the Sandhurst goldfield had been in full work
for some years before gold was discovered in this locality, which
then formed portion of a squatter’s or sheep-farmer’s run. In
1862 some woodsplitters discovered some rich golden quartz on
the surface, and at about the same time a deposit of alluviul gold
was discovered.
The first discoverer was Sebastian Schmidt, after whom the
place was named. Mr. Hugh Glass, the then owner of the
property, refused to allow the quartz miners to work, but let a
number of small Claims upon the alluvial ground, from which a
large quantity of gold was obtained. In 1864, however, Mr.
Glass entered into an agreement with a party of miners to work
the quartz reefs for 450 yards in length—the men to erect a
crushing machine, and to pay Mr. Glass 30 per cent, on the gross
yield of gold. Though the percentage was so high, the venture
proved a good one for the miners, who were headed by Mr. Robt.
Charlton, and the cost of erection of the crushing battery was
paid during the first six weeks. Subsequently the tribute was
reduced to 12| per cent., and the area extended to 400 acres.
The party put up a large plant at a cost £22,000. They worked
one block of stone from the surface down to 450 feet, when it


became very large and poor. They subsequently did a good deal
of prospecting lower down, but as the whole of the party had
done very well, it was decided not to spend any more work on
prospecting, but to stop work and divide the profits.
They were working for nine years and a quarter, and during
the eight years of that time of which records are obtainable, they
crushed 165,443 tons of stone, the yield of gold from which was
73,375 ozs., valued at £289,319 9s. lOd. They paid £147,993 9s.
10d. for working expenses and the erection of machinery;
£44,892 in percentage to the owner; and divided amongst them-
selves £96,434. Subsequently, on the death of Mr. Glass, the
estate was sold, and Charlton became the purchaser. He took a
trip to Europe, intending on his return to work the mine, but
death prevented him from carrying out his intention. The
property was offered for sale at a low price, but no one would buy
In February, 1880, after being idle for about seven years, the
Company now under notice was formed to work the ground,
obtaining from Mr. Charlton’s executors a lease for seven years,
at a royalty of 10 per cent, upon the gross yield of gold. For the
first year or two, as they had a good deal of prospecting to do,
they did not meet with any very decided successes, and in order
their large Claim —1137 yards along the line of reef
should be thoroughly prospected, a number of blocks of ground,
300 feet square, were let on tribute; some of these were very
successful, notably Bruhn’s Tribute, which worked a block of
stone from the surface to 300 feet, and paid a large amount of
dividends. Later still, the No. 20 Tribute (which, like Bruhn’s
Tribute, is a registered Company) came upon a good run of gold,
and are getting large yields. These Tributes pay 21 per cent, on
the gross yield to the Frederick the Great Company, who are also
turning out a large quantity of gold from the ground reserved for
their own use*


The working of these mines gives employment to a large number
of miners, and quite a township has sprung up in the locality,
through which a line of railway from Sandhurst passes.
The Frederick the great Tribute differs from most of the other
Companies in the district in one point, i.e., its ground being free-
hold, it has to pay a large amount in royalty to the owner ;
whereas most of the other mines are on crown lands, and have
only to pay a nominal rent to the Government.
The history of this Company’s operations is of more than
ordinary interest, from the fact that between it and the northern
end of the main lines in Sandhurst there is a length of 8 miles in
a direct line on which scarcely any prospecting has been done,
but which is just as likely to carry rich reefs. The reason of this
ground being unworked is, in the first place the absence of
sufficient capital to fully explore all portions of the district, and
secondly, the fact that for a good portion of the distance there is
no out-crop to show the position of the reef, thereby rendering its
exploration more difficult. As regards the latter point, it may be
mentioned that the rich reef worked by Bruhn’s Tribute had no
visible out-crop, and lay hidden for years, its discovery being
purely accidental.
THE VICTORIA QUARTZ COMPANY.
This piece of ground was one of the richest in the district in
the early days, for reliable records show that from the surface
down to 150 feet, for its length of 216 yards, the splendid return
of at least £IOOO a yard was obtained, or £218,000 in all. Four
small Claims held on the northern end produced £70,000 worth of
gold in four years for the original owners. These Claims were in
1860 bought by Mr. William Rae, who obtained £50,000 worth
of gold from 69 yards. In addition to this, the Company holding
the southern portion of the present Claim, obtained £20,000


worth of gold, and tributors subsequently got £20,000 worth of
gold. The gold obtained by other parties brought the total
value of the out-put, prior to the formation of the present
Company, up to .£220,000. In 1878 the present Company was
formed by an amalgamation of the various Claims. Since then
they have been prospecting vigorously, but have not obtained
more than a few thousand ozs. of gold ; latterly, however, they
have, at a depth of 1760, got a rich reef, one of the crushings
from which averaged 37 ozs. per ton. They are now opening up
this reef, in order to work it extensively, and will shortly be
producing regular yields.
The discovery of this reef at such a great depth is a good
example of what perseverance will do, as they passed through
about 1100 feet of barren ground before they got on this run,
which will, however, very soon repay the expenditure.
THE ELLESMERE COMPANY.
Capital paid up, £7816 13s. 4d. Dividends, £89,950.
The early history of this Company is to a great extent identical
with that of the New Chum United, given elsewhere; the two
Companies having formerly belonged to one propi’ietary. Like
the adjoining Claims, the ground yielded a large amount of gold
say about £60,000 or £70,000 worth to its private owners,
prior to the formation of the present Company. Since that date
(1872), a rich reef was discovered about 700 feet, and the
Company, upon a p> a id-up capital of only £<Bl6 13s. 4d.,
obtained 37,286 ozs. of gold, valued at £149,144, and paid in
dividends £89,950 —a magnificent return for the outlay.
They hold 6 acres 2 roods 10 perches of ground, and pay a rent
of £1 13s. 3d. per annum. Their machinery is valued at £2OOO.
Their prospecting is now carried on to a depth of over 1500 feet


T HE GRBAT EXTENDED HUSTLER’S AND TREAT
EXTENDED HUSTLER’S TRIBUTE COMPANIES.
Capital paid up, £27,200. Dividends, £363,300.
The history o£ these two celebrated Companies is so similar
that - “ impossible to separate them. The immense yields
obtained by them some years back, noised the fame of this line
all over the English-speaking world ; and the Hustler’s line was
then the principal one on Bendigo, as it may be agate.
Gold was first discovered on this line of reef in 1853 by
Jonathan Harris, one of a numerous party of colored men who
had found their way to “the diggings,” having probably deserted
from some ship in port. When these men, who were African
blacks, got the gold they held great rejoicings, and engaged a
and to play on the Claim. Subsequently they sold out to a
party, included in whom were J. Hustler, a one-armed man, after
whom the reef was called, and Messrs. Latham and Watson.
After some time a number of Companies arose, including the
Ulster. Londonderry, Tuff and Joseph’s. These, in February
866, were, with others, absorbed into the original Great Extended
ustler s Company ■ all of them had been rich, especially Tuff'
and Joseph’s. North of this was Latham and Watson’s Claim
since also absorbed in the Great Extended Hustler’s, which will
long be remembered in the annals of this goldfield. They worked
a very rich reef between 100 feet and 600 feet, and obtained, it
is stated, fully half a million pounds worth of gold.
The early history of the ground now included in the Great
Extended Hustler’s is interwoven with many an incident of
romance. When the gold was discovered by the blackfellow, in
1853, it was exhibited in the leading business street, being the
first quartz gold, or nearly so, obtained on the field. This
dieted from an auctioneer, named Beecham, the remark— £< This
is what will prove to be the mainstay of this goldfield.” This


remark was almost prophetic, for no one at that time had any idea
of the great and permanent quartz-mining district then in its
infancy, which was, in years afterwards, to prove reefs payable
2000 feet below the surface.
Before the reign of the present Company, two parties narrowly
escaped making big fortunes. One party, which included Mr.
George Lansell, the present “ Quartz King,” had sunk a shaft to
260 feet, when, being troubled with water, they sold out to the
Company ] this shaft, when sunk 40 feet further, came right down
on the cap of a very rich reef. Another party had a somewhat
similar mischance, just missing a rich reef by not carrying on a
drive a little further.
When H.R.H. Prince Alfred visited the Colonies he was
entertained in a most novel manner by the rich proprietors of
Latham and Watson’s mine. At 400 feet level a huge cavern
had been made by the removal of the reef, and here, in the bowels
of the earth, illuminated by artificial lights, with the walls draped
and the floor carpeted, H.R.H. was entertained at a magnificent
banquet.
When the present Company had absorbed all the other Claims,
it was decided to form another Company to work the southern
portion of the ground, and, in 1871, the Great Extended Hustler’s
Tribute Company, with 250 yards along the line of reef, came
into existence. Both Companies, the parent and the tribute,
caused great excitement by their great richness, yields of as high
as 4000 ozs. were obtained in a fortnight, and the dividends
ranged from £l5OO to £14,000 a fortnight. The Company
yielded 144,719 ozs, gold, valued at £590,607; and paid in divi-
dends £363,300. Their capital actually called up was only
£27,200. The lease rent is £l2 per annum.
GREAT EXTENDED HUSTLER’S TRIBUTE CO.
Capital paid up, £28,700. Dividends, £194,600,
This Tribute Company got 60,800 ozs. gold, and paid £194,600


in dividends, upon a paid-up capital of £28,700. The two
Companies thus, since formation, paid £557,900 in dividends. It
is impossible to calculate the amount paid previously, but it was
enormous. The Company’s shaft is now down 1750 feet, and the
Tribute shaft, 1670 feet. Rent, £l2 per annum.
THE UNITED DEVONSHIRE COMPANY.
Capital paid up, £6883, Dividends, £211,400.
This Company has been the most sensational venture in the last
three or four years, and indeed its success has been almost entirely
a latter day character. In the early days it changed owners
several times. One portion of it, when held by Freeman and Co.,
was worked down to 150 feet, and yielded, in places, as high as
80 ozs. per ton; and the “ Dane’s ” Claim yielded as high as 60
ozs. per ton, but no record of the total yields at this time can now
be obtained.
Subsequently the ground was not very productive, and in 1873,
after a number of vicissitudes, it passed into the hands of the
present Company, who prospected for many years without success.
Eventually, about three or four years ago, they succeeded in
finding payable gold in a big block of stone between the 400 feet
and 600 feet levels. They opened up the reef and obtained a
number of highly sensational yields, running up as high as from
2000 ozs. to 3000 ozs. per fortnight. For a long time they paid
regular dividends, of from one to ten shillings per 28,000 th share
each fortnight; and on one occasion they divided no less than
£14,700 as the results of a fortnight’s work. They obtained,
altogether (chiefly in two years), 68,000 ozs. gold; and paid, from
March, 1884, to April, 1886, £211,400 in dividends. To obtain
this the cost was trifling; the capital called up being only £6883
6s. Bd.; and for this rich Claim they only pay £1 17s. 6d. per
annum rent. They have machinery valued at £8162.
It may be noted that the cube sent home in regard to this mine
is much too small, a serious error in the calculation of the yields


and dividends o£ this Company having been discovered since the
cubes were shipped.
THE HERCULES AND ENERGETIC COMPANY.
Capital paid up, £5250. Dividends, £48,375.
This is one of the large Companies of the district, and like
nearly all the other mines described, the Claim has passed through
various stages of private ownership, and small public Companies,
before reaching its present owners, who hold it in a Company
consisting of 30,000 shares. Previous to the amalgamation,
which took place in 1876, it was held by four Companies—the
Hercules, the Energetic, the North Energetic, and the Victoria
Pilot. Prior to this it had passed through the hands of private
Claimholders, who had started work there as early as 1855; in
this stage the Hercules portion proved successful, a small quartz hill
or mound yielding fairly, and they also worked down to 100 feet ;
afterwards, as a Company, the shaft was sunk deeper, and moderate
yields obtained. The Energetic portion yielded better, and paid
the private owners £16,000 clear profit, and as a Company, gave
£30,000 in dividends. The North Energetic and Pilot did not
produce much gold. Prior to amalgamation the ground held by
the present Company yielded altogether a profit of about £60,000.
Since 1876, they have got 44,502 ozs. gold, and paid £48,375 in
dividends, making altogether (public and private) £lOB,OOO in
dividends. They hold 85 acres, and pay £2l ss. per annum rent.
LADY DARKLY COMPANY.
Capital paid up, £17,400. Dividends, £52,000.
The ground held by this Company was first worked about 1857
by a number of private parties, who got good returns on the
surface; subsequently one portion came into the hands of Kilfoy
and Company, who obtained returns running from 1| ozs. to 2
ozs. per ton from a small surface stone; this was the original
Lady Darkly Claim, and later on came into the hands of Robbins


and Co., who divided £16,000 clear profit, chiefly from a stone at
75 feet, which yielded as high as 7* ozs. per ton; subsequently
it was formed into a public Company and amalgamated with the
Ramgall and North Devonshire Companies, both of which had
given good yields near the surface; however, beyond those
obtained by Robbins and Co, the profits of the early Claim-
holders are not now ascertainable, though it is said to have been
one of the best Claims along the line in the early days.
For many years after the formation of the Company the
venture was not prosperous, chiefly owing to its shareholders’
ack of enterprise, and a few years ago the whole of the 24,000
shares could have been obtained for not much more than £5O;
shortly after this they struck a good reef at 600 feet, and the
market value of the Claim rose to about £40,000. They obtained
gold to the value of £112,792, and besides erecting good
machinery, paid £52,000 in dividends, and are still raising pay-
able stone. Area, 12 acres; rent £3.
SOUTH ST. MUNGO COMPANY
Capital paid up, £9375. Dividends, £48,375.
This Company’s ground adjoins the Lady Darkly Company,
and as its history is almost identical, it is unnecessary to repeat
it. It was formerly called the Governor Darkly, and though not
so rich as the Lady Darkly, it yielded largely in the early days.
Detween 150 and 250 feet the stone was rich. The results since
the formation of the Company are striking, showing how rapidly
mining repays the previous expenditure. Por several years, like
the Lady Darkly, the Company dragged on slowly, and the
shareholders during all this time were only called to pay £9375.
In 1884, however, they struck a good reef, and in two years got
21,250 ozs. of gold, and paid £48,375 in dividends, besides
erecting powerful machinery. They hold over 13 acres, and pay
£3 7s. per annum lease rent.


BIRD’S REEF COMPANY.
Capital paid up, £9685. Dividends, £12,327.
This Claim is situated in a locality, which, for many years has
been neglected, though at times it has proved very rich. The reef
was first opened by a miner named Bird, who succeeded in getting
enough gold to enable him to return to England a wealthy man.
In 1859 the Bird’s Reef Company was formed and worked for
some years with moderate success, obtaining 25,115 ozs. gold,
which gave <£12,327 in dividends, upon a paid-up capital of
£9685. In late years this locality has fallen out of favor, and
though several spasmodic efforts have been made, nothing has
resulted ; now, however, a new Company has been formed, and
intends to go to work with energy. There are miles of ground
available in the neighborhood, which was rich in the early days,
but has not been systematically prospected since.
NEW CHUM AND VICTORIA COMPANY.
Capital paid up, £4BOO. Dividends, £112,112.
This Company’s Claim has always been a popular one, and it
justified the favor shown it, for, though at times it has been out-
shone by its neighbors, it has all through been one of the most
consistently rich mines in the district. It was worked as early as
1854, and the various private parties that then held it did very
well.
There were on the surface two bodies of stone, resembling the
east and west legs of a “ saddle ” reef (which is the general
formation of reefs in this district), and the “cap ” had evidently
suffered from a process of denudation by nature. Later on the
ground was held by two parties, one portion being known as
Hudson’s Claim, and the other as Burrows, McDonald, and
Phillips,’ and later on as Burrows and Sterry’s. In Hudsons’
Claim rich stone was obtained from the surface to about 200 feet;


the yields averaging from 2to 14 ozs. per ton. In Burrows'
portion good stone was also obtained down to 300 feet, the
richest part being above 100 feet. For part of the time this
portion of the Claim was held by the private partners, that is
from October 28th, 1854, to March 24th, 1860, the proprietor’s
books show that 288 tons of quartz yielded 3607 ozs. 10 dwts.
6 grs. gold, valued at over £14,000. The highest yield was
366 ozs. from 10 tons. For the remaining period, and with regard
to other portions of the Claim, such exact figures are not obtain-
able, but from the data to hand, the profit made by the whole of
the original holders before the Company was formed must have
been at the least £BO,OOO. The New Chum and Victoria
Tribute afterwards worked the ground, and paid T 31,800 in
dividends, from a reef at 500 feet. The Company has since
worked various bodies of stone with success, and was tiie first
Company which paid dividends from a reef below 1000 feet.
Their shaft is now down 1800 feet. The total gold obtained since
the private parties were bought out was 98187 ozs., valued at
£392,748, and the dividends paid, £112,112. The capital called
up was only £4BOO. Lease rent, £3 10s.
VICTORY AND PANDORA COMPANY.
Capital paid up, £43,381. Dividends, £170,000.
This ground was first worked in 1857 by a number of diggers
who held small Claims. There was a reef two feet six inches
thick on the surface, which gave about 5 ozs. gold per ton. It
was worked to various depths in the different Claims. In one
instance 16 tons gave a profit of £46 per man in a five-men Claim.
After the shallower levels were worked out things became very
dull, and in 1868 a mile of ground along this line of reef—from
which area over two million pounds worth of gold has since been
taken—could have been bought for a thousand pounds.


In 1870 and 1871 two Companies were formed under the names
of The Victory and The Pandora, to work the present Claim, and
both were successful, the Victory Company especially so. The
ground was worked separately until 1875, when, it being found
necessary to sink one deep shaft, they amalgamated. Since the
amalgamation the Company has worked with great energy, and
it is now remarkable as possessing the second deepest mine in the
district, its shaft being down 2000 feet. They have it in
contemplation to sink to 3000 feet shortly. At 1860 feet they
recently discovered a golden reef, but have not got any dividends
from it yet.
Owing to the great outlay this Company has been put to in
sinking, the called-up capital is much heavier than usual-
amounting to <£43,381. The total dividends paid by the two
Companies before amalgamation was <£170,000, and the gold
yield, 56,500 ozs. Their machinery is valued £BOOO. They hold
over 17 acres of ground, and pay <£4 Bs. 9d. per annum rent.
NOTE.
The Administrative Council of the Bendigo School of Mines
and Industries consists of 13 members, many of whom are
interested in gold mining, and others are managers of gold mines,
who have had experience extending over many years on the
Sandhurst goldfield.
To those who desire to investigate the facts contained in this
pamphlet, and to find out for themselves by observation the
resources and capabilities of the large auriferous area known as
the Bendigo or Sandhurst goldfield, the fullest information will
be given, and the readiest help will be afforded by the members
of the Administrative Council.
