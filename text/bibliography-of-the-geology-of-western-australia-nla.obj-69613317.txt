PREFACE.
�HE following Bibliography contains a list of Works,
Papers, Reports, and Maps bearing upon the Geology,
Mineralogy, Mining, and Paleontology of Western
Australia. Its compilation was originally commenced during
the time I was an officer on the Staff of the Geological Survey
of Queensland. The labour was undertaken with the object
of enlarging my knowledge of the literature of Australian
Geology, and with the hope of being able to keep up to
date the Catalogue of Works, Papers, Reports, and Maps
prepared by Messrs. Etheridge and Jack in the year 1880,
and to which I am indebted for much information.
My appointment as Government Geologist of Western
Australia rendered the completion of the list, so far as was
possible without access to well stocked scientific libraries,
peculiarly appropriate; and, on being submitted to the
Honourable the Minister for Mines, the Bibliography was
ordered to be printed for public information.
To ray predecessor, Mr. H. P. Woodward, I am indebted
for having unreservedly placed at my disposal a short manu-
script list of works bearing upon the Geology of the Colony,
which he had prepared from the records of the British
Museum.
