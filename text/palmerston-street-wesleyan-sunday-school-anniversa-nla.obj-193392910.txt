O God make clean our hearts within us,

ALL HAIL THE POWER.
Wesley’s Hymns, No. 68i.
ALL hail the power of Jesu’s name
Let angels prostrate fall;
Bring forth the royal diadem
To crown Him Lord of all.
Crown Him, ye morning stars of light,
Who launched this floating ball;
Now hail the Strength of Israel’s might,
And crown Him Lord of all.
Crown Him, ye martyrs of our God,
Wfho from His altar call ;
Of Jesse’s stem extol the Rod,
And crown Him Lord of all.
Ye seed of Israel’s chosen race,
Ye ransomed from the fall,
Hail Him who saves you by His grace
And crown Him Lord of all.
Let every tribe and every tongue
Before Him prostrate fall,
And shout in ■universal song
The crownd Lor i of all.
O that with yonder sacred throng,
We at His feet may fall,
Join in the everlasting song,
And crown Him Lord of all

SALVATION! O THE JOYFUL SOUND
Wesley’s Hymns No 742.
SALVATION ! O the joyful sound !
What pleasure to our ears !
A sovereign balm for every wound,
A cordial for our fears.
Chorus.
Glory, honour, praise, and power,
Be unto the Lamb for ever :
Jesus Christ is our Redeemer ;
Hallelujah, Praise the Lord.
Salvation ! let the echo fly
The spacious earth around ;
While all the armies of the sky
Conspire to raise the sound !
Glory, honour, praise, and power, &c
Salvation ! O Thou bleeding Lamb,
To Thee the praise belongs;
Salvation shall inspire our hearts,
And dwell upon our tongues.
Glory, honour, praise, and power, &c.
O FOR A THOUSAND TONGUES
TO SING.
Wesley’s Hymns, No. x.
OFOR a thousand tongues to sing,
My great Redeemer’s praise,
The glories of my God and King,
The triumphs of His grace !
My gracious Master and my God,
Assist me to proclaim,
To spread through al! the earth abroad
The honours of Thy name.
Jesus ! the name that charms our fears,
That bids our sorrows cease ;
’Tis music in the sinner’s ears,
’Tis life, and health, and peace.
He breaks the power of cancelled sin,
He sets the prisoner free ;
His blood can make the foulest clean,
His blood availed for me.


He speaks, and, listening to His voice,
New life the dead receive,
The mournful, broken hearts rejoice,
The humble poor beleive.
Hear Him, ye deaf; His praise, ye dumb,
Your loosened tongues employ ;
Ye blind, behold your Saviour come,
And leap, ye lame, for joy.
ALL PEOPLE THAT ON EARTH
UO DWELL.
Wesley’s Hymns, No. 607.
ALL people that on earth do dwell,
Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice:
Him serve with fear, His praise forth tell;
Come ye before Him and rejoice.
The Lord, ye know, is God indeed ;
Without our aid He did us make ;
We are His flock, He doth us feed ;
And for His sheep He doth us take.
O enter then His gates with praise ;
Approach with joy His courts unto ;
Praise, laud, and bless His name always,
For it is seemly so to do.
For why ? the Lord our God is good,
His mercy is for ever sure ;
His truth at all times firmly stood,
And shall from age to age endure,
ANNIVERSARY SONG.
Festal Songs, Page 2.
HAIL, festal day, whose dawn our hearts
rejoices,
Gladly we greet Thee, singing loud and clear ;
Praise we the Lord with ringing voices,
Hail to the happiest day in all the circling
year!
Here in the place of God’s abode appearing,
Shout we His name, whose goodness crowns
our days;
Humbly we kneel, His Majesty revering,
Rise, then, to sing our great Deliv’rer’s
praise !
Refrain : Hail, festal day, &c.


Praise to the Father, who His Son hath given:
Praise to the Saviour, God’s Eternal Son ;
Praise to the Spirit shed forth from heaven ;
Praise to the Trinity, thrice-blessed Three in
One!
O Father, hear Thy children’s adoration!
O blessed Jesus, take our sins away !
O Holy Spirit, by Thy inspiration,
Cleanse all our thoughts on this thrice holy
day.
Refrain; Hail, festal day, &c.
Hear Thou the songs from joyful lips out-
pouring,
Bless Thou the word of truth proclaimed
this hour,
Answer our prayer to heaven up soaring,
Send down Thy benediction like a gentle
shower.
And when these fleeting years of earth are
ended,
Welcome Thy children to Thy home above,
Where we shall sing, with saints and angels
blended,
Glory and praise to Thy redeeming love.
Refain : Hail, festal day, &c.
Praise ye the Lord, oh, praise the Lord
MORNING SONG-
Festal Songs, Page 21.
F'ROM out His red pavilion
The bridegroom sun hath stepped,
And glad are they for dawning light
Who thro’ the dark have wept.
The birds in merry chorus
Sing welcome to the day,
And evil beasts and things of night
In terror steal away.
Now, through the sleeping city,
There moves a thrill and stir.
Blue smoke from many a new-lit fire
Is rising through the air;
The children’s shouts and laughter,
Proclaim that night is done,
And glad they sing, a blithesome choir,
To hail the risen sun.


Then round the board they gather,
The daily bread is given ;
And reverently they kneel to pray
And thank the God of heaven.
And then, with mother’s kisses
Yet warm upon their face,
Rush headlong out to join in play ;
And God is in that place.
We thank Thee, O our Father,
The God of life and light,
Who giv’st the day for work and play,
For quiet rest the night.
May all our days be hallowed
By service done to Thee !
Then when the shadows flee away
New dawn in heaven shall be. Amen
8 THE GOOD SHEPHERD.
Festal Songs, Page 24.
Repeat refrain after each verse.
O Praise the Lord with one accord
And tell the wonderful story
Of how He came to bear our shame
And bring all His children to glory.
For when God beheld our sad, pitiful case
And the woe that had come on mankind,
He gave His own Son to restore us to grace
And He sent Him His lost ones to find.
So Jesus came seeking the wandering sheep
That had strayed on the mountains of sin;
He swam the dark waters and climbed the
rough steep
All to bring the lost wanderer in.
How gently He carried him clasped to His
breast,
As He bore him to safety and home ;
With tenderest mercy He soothed him to rest,
And He taught him no longer to roam.
And then He sent forth the glad news far and
wide
To His neighbours and friends all around ;
The angels rejoiced and new melodies tried
To proclaim that the lost one was found.


And when the fierce wolves thro’ the gloom of
the night
Came upon them to ravage and kill,
The good Shepherd laid down His life in the
fight
That His sheep might be saved from their
will.
O Jesus, good Shepherd, Thy lambs would
proclaim
All thy bountiful goodness and care ;
And when dos’t Thou call Thine own sheep by
their name,
Saviour, grant that we may all be there!
Amen.
BATTLE SONG,
Festal Songs, Page 9.
HARK ! ’tis the trumpet loudly blowing !
On to the battlefield be going.
Jesus our Captain rides before us ;
Shout for His banner waving o’er us!
Hail to our Captain ! Who dares shame Him ?
Jesus, the Conqueror, we’ll proclaim Him!
King of all kings and lords we’ll name Him;
Hail to King Jesus ! Hail! Hail! Hail!
Faithful and true, He heads His forces,
Charging upon their snow-white horses,
Clothed in fine linen, white and glorious,
Over all sin and shame victoribus.
Hail to our Captain, &c.
By the great name upon Him written
Surely His foes shall all be smitten:
Word of our God, with grace anointed,
Captain of all heaven’s host appointed.
Hail to our Captain, &c.
See how His eyes like fire are blazing,
Dazzling the foe, their heart amazing;
Fighting for Him the brave grow braver,
Courage, dear comrades, do not waver !
Hail to our Captain, &c.
Fight the good fight of faith right boldly,
Shame on the man whose pulse beats coldly.
Never give way, fear no disaster,
Victory waits upon our Master.
Hail to our Captain, &c.


Look where the crown of life is gleaming,
Flashes of glory from it streaming ;
Yes, unto us it shall be given,
Triumphing aye with Christ in heaven.
Hail to our Captain, &c
10 GLORY TO GOD ON HIGH !
Festal Songs, Pag* 17.
GLORY to God on high ! the morning stars
were singing
When God in its beauty call’d forth this
wondrous frame;
And the light shone around, and the earth with
flowers was springing.
Chorus.
Then praise the Lord, O praise the Lord !
Then praise the Lord, O praise the Lord !
Then praise ye the Lord our God and magnify
His name!
Glory to God on high! the angel choir re-
peated,
When Jesus was born to redeem us from our
shame,
And the glad shepherds came and the King of
glory greeted.
Then praise ye the Lord, &c
Glory to God on high ! the hymn of praise loud
swelling,
The triumph of Christ o’er the grave doth now
proclaim,
As He riseth on high to regain His heav’nly
dwelling.
Then praise ye the Lord, &c.
Glory to God on high ! With sound like mighty
thunder
It peals round the Lord as He comes in flashing
flame
To avenge His elecf, to perform His work of
wonder.
Then praise ye the Lord, &c.


Glory to God on high! when time and death
are ended
In heaven’s fadeless splendour the song shall
be the same;
And the hymns of the saints and the angles
shall be blended ;
Then praise ye the Lord, &c.
Amen.
PRAISE SONG.
Festal Songs, Page 23.
COME, loudly sing our conqu’ring King,
From all our foes who frees us,
Tell forth his fame,and shout his name,
The blessed name of Jesus!
Laud Him ye hosts on high,
Ye saints on earth reply!
And children too shall raise
Hosannas to His praise.
Then loudly sing our conqu’ring King,
From all our foes who frees us ;
Tell forth His fame and shout His name,
The blessed name of Jesus.
O sing His birth, who came to earth,
From sin and thrall to save us ;
Of glory shorn, of virgin born.
His spotless self He gave us.
Despised by sinful men,
Rejected was He then ;
No grace in Him they saw,
No majesty or awe.
Refrain. —Then loudly sing, &c.
Upon the cross, to save our loss,
He meekly lets them nail Him ;
Whilst savage foes, with cruel blows,
And bitter taunts assail Him.
Obedient unto death,
He rendered up His breath ;
’Tis finished ! He cried ;
Then bowed His head and died.
Refrain.—Then loudly sing, &c.


But soon He broke death’s iron yoke,
And rose in life and glory;
His servants sad, He made right glad,
And sent to tell the story.
And now the Gospel’s sound
Has gone the wide world round ;
And men of every race
Rejoice in Jesu’s grace
Refrain.— Then loudly sing, &c.
To Him is given in earth and heaven,
The name above all others;
And every tongue shall praise in song
His love beyond a brother’s.
Then shout, ye hosts on high !
Ye saints on earth reply !
And, children, let us raise
Hosanna to His praise !
Refrain.— Then loudly sing, &c.
Amen
12 HOSANNA !
Festal Songs, Page 13.
HOSANNA! Hosanna! the children
sang bold
When Jesus came riding to Zion of old ;
Hosanna ! Hosanna ! they hailed him their
King,
And Jesus, well pleased, heard their fresh
voices ring.
The scribes and the doctors stood sullenly
by,
And “Master, rebuke them,” they angrily
cry.
“Not so,” said the Saviour; and still they
sang on,
Hosanna ! Hosanna ! to David’s great Son.
Hosanna ! Hosanna ! we join in the song,
Which children have echoed the ages along,
Hosanna ! Hosanna ! and Jesus still hears
And smiles on our praises and quiets our
fears,
He loves all His children. He loves their
sweet praise,
And He will protect us through life’s early
days;
And, therefore, our singing shall never have
end,
Hosanna ! Hosanna ! to Jesus our friend.


Hosanna ! Hosanna ! again we shall cry,
What time we behold Him enthroned in the
sky;
Hosanna ! Hosanna ! and angels shall blow
Their trumpets of gold as loud chanting we
go,
And heaven’s ancient music shall learn a
new strain,
Hosanna to Jesus, the Lamb that was slain ;
And in that high temple we children will
sing
Hosanna ! Hosanna ! to Jesus our King !
WHO IS THIS ?
Festal Songs, Page 20.
WHO is in this manger laid,
Tended by a peasant maid ?
While the shepherds tidings bring
How they heard the angels sing ;
Joining them our knees we bow,
Jesus, Son of Man, ’tis Thou !
Who is this beside the sea,
On the hill in Gallilee,
Telling to the crowd around
How God’s kingdom may be found
E’en by men who sow and plough ?'
Jesu, Teacher, it is Thou !
Who is this on Tabor’s height,
Clad in raiment glistering white ?
Like the sun His face doth shine
With a glory all divine.
By the light that clothes Thy brow,,
Jesu, Son of God, 'tis Thou !
Who is this by scourges torn
Hanging on the cross of scorn ?
Hark ! that loud and anguished cry,.
Thrilling to the darkened sky !
By the thorns upon thy brow,
Jesus Saviour, it is Thou !
Who is this in cloud of light
Raising from His servant’s sight ?
Who His gracious hands extends,
Shedding blessings on His friends ?
Hark ! the angels greet him now,
Jesus, King of heaven, 'tis Thou !


Who is this in majesty,
Flashing through the lurid sky,
While the trump of God doth blare,
Pealing through the startled air ?
Prostrate in the dust we bow :
Jesu, Judge of men, 'tis Thou !
Who is this in heaven’s blaze,
Centre of their rapturous praise,
Standing on Mount Zion’s height,
God of God, and Light of Light ?
Ah ! those bleeding wounds avow,
Jesu, Lamb of God, ’tis Thou !
PILGRIM SONG.
Festal Songs, Page 18.
PILGRIMS marching home to Zion
On our way we gladly sing,
Making the hill and valley echo
With the praises of our King,
Sunshine bright or clouded sky,
Ever cheerfully we cry :
Hallelujah ! Hallelujah !
Sometimes from the hills of Beulah
We behold the city’s towers,
And so near its glory gleameth
That we almost think it ours!
Then we make the mountains ring
Whilst exultantly we sing,
Hallelujah ! Hallelujah !
Then to Baca’s cheerless valley
Doth our path go winding down,
Where the stealthy lion lurketh,
And the cliffs with horror frown ;
But to scatter fear and doubt,
With undaunted voice we shout
Hallelujah! Hallelujah !
Soon in Zion all appearing,
In God's presence we shall stand
For the faithful pilgrim never
Fails to reach the promised land.
There in louder, sweeter praise,
Still the ancient song we’ll raise,
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!


MIRIAM’S SONG.
Festal Songs, Page xg,
O TRIKE your timbrels, Hebrew maidens,.
Miriam bids upraise the lay ;
Mighty is the Lord at all times,
Mightier hail we Him to-day.
Blow your trumpets, men of Israel!
Gideon leads you through the night;
Break your pitchers, wave your torches,
Charge upon the Midianite !
Beat your tabors, dancing damsels!
David comes in triumph by,
Vanquished liesithe grim Goliath;
Shout your freedom to the sky !
Wave your banners, host of Jesus !
He hath risen from the tomb ;
Lift your heads, eternal portals,
Make the King of Glory room !
16 HAVE MERCY, LORD
Festal Songs, Page 7.
WHEN darkness broods o’er land and sea
And fears assail us shudd’ringly,
O, Father dear, we cry to Thee;
Have mercy, Lord ! Have mercy, Lord !
When fiercly beats temptation’s blast,
And all our sky is overcast,
And every hope of grace is past—
Have mercy, Lord ! Have mercy, Lord !
When sullen sounds the passing bell,
For those who loved, ah, loved so well,
And in the dark our spirits dwell—
Have mercy, Lord ! Have mercy, Lord 1
When death draws near, with visage grim,
And ears grow dull, and eyes grow dim,
And coldness creeps o’er every limb—
Have mercy, Lord ! Have mercy, Lord I


When pealing shrills the trumpet sound,
And earthquakes rock the trembling ground,
And we before the Throne are found —
Have mercy, Lord, Have mercy, Lord !
And when in heaven’s felicity,
We stand beside the crystal sea,
Ev’n then our prayer shall ever be—
Have mercy, Lord, Have mercy, Lord !
COME TO JESUS.
Festal Songs, Pagb 21.
Repeat last two lines in chorus unison.
COME to Jesus, little child,
He is gentle, meek and mild,
He was once a child like thee,
And He loves full well thy merry glee.
O come, O
Come to Jesus, do not fear,
Little ones to Him are dear ;
He will take thee to His arms,
Shelter thee from all life’s fierce alarms
Chorus —
Come to Jesus, one and all,
Listen to the Saviour’s loving call.
Come to Jesus, joyous youth,
He will teach thee living truth ;
Arm thee with the Spirit’s sword,
Make thee valiant, true in thought and word.
O come, O
Come to Jes*us, tender maid !
Nay, thouneed’st not be afraid ;
He will deck Thee with his grace,
With the glow of heaven transform thy face.
Come to Jesus, &c.
Come to Jesus, man of care,
Battling in the noon-tide glare;
He will nerve thee for the strife,
Stir thy pulses with a fuller life. O come, O
Come to Jesus woman worn,
He was of a woman born ;
Though the path of life be drear,
He will warm thy heart with heavenly cheer.


Come to Jesus, grandsire old !
Never doth His love grow cold.
Long hast thou refused His call,
Yet He now will freely pardon all
O Come! O
Come to Jesus, mother grey !
Long and hard has been thy way j
hix on him thy failing sight,
And at evening time it shall’be light.
Come to Jesus, &c.
Come to Jesus, sinner, thou !
Come to Jesus even now !
He is ready thee to bless,
And to pardon thine unrighteousness.
O come ! O
Come to Jesus, wait no more!
Jesu’s blood and tears implore ;
Yes, for thee, for thee He died !
Come to Jesus, Jesus crucified.

After two years consideration the School
Committee decided to erect a Platform for the
use of the Scholars on Anniversary and Festal
occasions. This has been done at a cost of
towards which a sum of was set apart
last year. We feel sure that this step will meet
with the approval of all, and we confidently
appeal to all who attend the Anniversary
Meetings to do the best they can to help us
to meet the necessary expense.
Plrtsic.
We desire specially to acknowledge the
help given to the School by Revd. E. H.
Sugden (Master of Queen’s) in this department.
He has again done all the work in connection
with the training of the children in the singing.
The Hymns have been selected from a collection
entitled “ Festal Songs,” which has just been
specially composed and arranged by Mr. Sugden
for the use of Sunday School Anniversaries.
