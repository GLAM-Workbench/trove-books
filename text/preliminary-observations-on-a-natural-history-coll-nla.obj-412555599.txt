PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS
OX A
NATURAL HISTORY COLLECTION
Made in connection with the Surveying Cruise of IT. M. S.
“ Myrmidon,” at Port Darwin and Cambridge Gulf—
September to November, 1888—by W. Saville - Kent,
F.L.S., F.Z.S., &c., Commissioner of Fisheries, Queens-
land.
I was invited last year by Captain the Hon. H. P Foley
Yereker, RN, Dr. W. G. K. Barnes, and other officers of
H.M S. “Myrmidon,” to accompany them on their surveying
expedition to Cambridge Gulf on the northern sea board of West
Australia, and of which district it had been determined to make
a more accurate survey, in consequence of the growing importance
of the township of Wyndham as a port of access to the Kimberley
Goldfields. Apart from the prospects of an enjoyable trip in the
most agreeable company, my alacrity in accepting the invitation
was greatly stimulated in view of the opportunities that would
be afforded me of obtaining natural history material from a
comparatively new field, and at the same time of forming a more
intimate personal acquaintance with tropical life than had
previously fallen to my lot. My anticipations in each of these
several directions were most agreeably fulfilled, and while
sufficient leisure has not been at my disposal to permit of my
presenting on this occasion a complete list of the specimens
collected, i propose to place on record a brief enumeration of the
more prominent among them, giving a special reference to certain
of those forms which have apparently hitherto escaped observation,
or have not been recorded in connection with an Australian
habitat.
The period of my explorations in association with H.M.S.
“Myrmidon” extended from September 9th, when I joined the
fh 1i.55/r//Oi
X 7-5-77


ship at Port Darwin, until November 14th, when I had to bid
the vessel adieu and return to the northern colonies. On my
journey to and from Port Darwin via Queensland coast, per the
China Navigation Company’s Steamer “ Tsinan,” such opportuni-
ties as presented themselves of adding to my collections and
store of information were readily embraced, and the result ß
accomplished may be appropriately chronicled in connection with
the major portions of this report.
The materials amassed were naturally associated chiefly
with the various sections of marine zoology, and in the accumu-
lation and conservation of which I am greatly indebted to the
able assistance of Dr Barnes, who has moreover since remitted
me a collection of specimens made by himself in the vicinity of
Port Essington shortly after my departure As opportunities
occured a small collection of reptiles and also of bird skins was
got together. Mr. Charles De Yis, M.A., the Curator of the
Queensland Museum, has kindly undertaken the identification of
these two sections, and has supplied the accompanying lists.
With respect to the birds J may suitab'y mention here that
Lieut. W. O Lyne, BA, of H.M S. ‘‘Myrmidon” was one of
the most extensive contributors Among the specimens that fell
to his gun is a species of owl, which has proved to be an abnor-
mally pale variety of the Blinking Owl, Maox connivens. A
somewhat rare form shot by myself among the mangroves in
Cambridge Gulf is a female specimen of Pachijcephala larwides.
The reptiles, Mr De Yis informs me. include a species of
snake differing in important structural details from those
recorded in any accessible work on herpetology, and apparently
new to science, this acquisition I leave to Mr. De Vis to describe.
Of the class of fishes over sixty species were collected ; from
Mr. Paul Folsche, P.M, and Dr. Wood the Government Medical
Officer' at Port Darwin, I received material assistance towards
forming a collection of the fish of that district. The majority
of these have been previously catalogued in Sir W. Macleay’s


Pishes of Australia, and more notably in an account of a
collection of fish received by him from Port Darwin, and
described in the Proceedings of the Linnean Society of Xew
South Wales for the year 1878. Some two or three of the
smaller fish obtained in Cambridge Gulf would appear, however,
to present characters that do not, so far as I have been able to
ascertain, coincide with those of any previously described species.
One of these is a small form of a Tassel Fish, I l ulynemu *, conspic-
uous for the number and great length of those filamentous
appendages developed from the base of the pectoral fins, which
have gained for the genus its characteristic title. Among the six
Australian species hitherto recorded, the number of pectoral
appendages ranges from four to six, and in none of these do they
extend in length beyond the base of the anal fin. In the form
now introduced there are seven filamentous appendages developed
from the base of each pectoral fin, five of which may extend
backwards beyond the distal extremity of the caudal fin, and
this last named fin is moreover of remarkable length, equalling,
with the exception of the head, that of the entire body. The
colours of this fish in life are essentially brilliant, the general
ground tint of the body being yellow, shaded or sprinkled with
black on the dorsal surface ; the long caudal fin and the membra-
nous portions of the pectoral and the nutral fins are bright
orange, whi e the filamentous pectoral appendages are of an
intense vermilion. Several species of the genus Polyminus having
seven pectoral filaments have been recorded from the East
Indian and Chinese Seas, and among these it most nearly
resembles the Paradise Tassel Fish, Pulyneinus paradise us, of the
Ganges and the Indian coast line. In the brief description given
of that species in Gunther's Catalogue of Fishes, Yol. 11., p. 320,
the ventral fins only are leferred to as being coloured yellow in
contra distinction to those of allied species which are black.
That species moreover would appear to be of considerable size,
several of the preserved examples in the British Museum being
referred to as “stuffed.” The total length of the largest example of
the form now introduced is only six inches, but it is in its mature


condition as evidenced by its body being distended with well
developed ova. I propose to associate with this Cambridge Gulf
species the title of Polynemus Verekeri , in recognition of my
indebtedness to Captain Yerker for the facilities afforded me for
collecting the materials catalogued in this present paper. A
technical diagnosis, together with a diagrammatic outline illustra-
ting the most salient features of this species, are appended to this
communication.
The second species of fish to which I have to direct attention
x s also remarkable for its East Indian affinities. It is a repre-
sentative of the family Scopelida?, and closely allied to the
valuable commercial form commonly known in the East Indian
and Chinese markets as the “ Hummaloh,’’ or “ Bombay Duck.”
One of its most familiar uses in a gastronomic sense is that of a
condiment to curries. The technical name of the Indian species-
is Harpodon nehereus, and so far as I am aware, or have been
able to ascertain, no second representative of the same genus has
been hitherto described. The species now introduced—and
which I propose to name Harpodon translucent —is a fish of small
size not exceeding four or five inches in length, and in life is-
remarkably transparent. One of its most characteristic features
however, is the abnormal development of the teeth of the lower
jaw; several of these at the symphysis lay entirely outside the
oral cavity, and to the unassisted eye, present the aspect of
curved projecting bristles. Examined wiih a lens, these project
ting teeth are found to be minutely barbed like a fish-hook, and
thus correspond in character with those occupying the normal
position in the more familiar Indian type. In company with the
Polynemus last described, this species of Harpodon was captured
in Cambridge Gulf in some quantity, with the aid of a prawn
trawl fastened overboard in the tideway, while the “ Myrmidon”
was at anchor. On being hau’ed on deck, the little fish citing so
tenaciously to the meshes of the net with their finely barbed
teeth, that it was difficult to detach them without injury. The
technical diagnosis and an illustration of this species is associated
with those of Polynemus Verekeri.


A third fish obtained in Cambridge Gulf, that I have reason
to believe is new to science* is a species of Ambit/opus. This
genus includes several small fishes allied to the Gobies, but
remarkable for the circumstance that the eyes are of such minute
size and low organisation as to be practically functioidess. In
the example now under notice, it was not possible to detect the
presence of these organs in the living fish, and it is only since it
has become bleached in the preserving fluid that the eyes have
been rendered visible, with the aid of a pocket-lens, as exceedingly
minute specks. The colour of the living fish was a most delicate
rose pink, with a longitudinal carmine streak, indicating the
contour of the lateral line. Secondary streaks branched from the
primary one on either side, and delineated the boundaries of the
muscle-layers or myotonies. With reference to its characteristic
colouring, 1 propose—in association with the accompanying
diagnosis and illustration—to distinguish this fish by the title of
Amhlyopus rubii-lineatus. The nearest ally to this new species
that has been hitherto recorded, would appear to be the
Amhlyopus roseus, described by Cuvier and Valenciennes, as
occurring in sufficient quanties in the Bombay canal to form
an article of food. That species, however, grows to the more
considerable length of fifteen or eighteen inches, and differs in
various structural details, including that of the fin formulte and
the comparative length of the head. The specimen here described
was taken with the dredge at Cambridge Gulf, from a depth of
about five fathoms A second example was likewise brought to
the surface by the same method at Port Darwin, but unfortunately
escaped into the water. The only other representative of the
genus Amhlyopus, hitherto recorded from Australian waters, is a
species that was obtained from the Brisbane River, and described
by Mr. De Vis in the Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New
South Wales for the year 1884, under the title of Amhlyopus
ntqer. The colour of that fish, as it name implies, is an intense
black.
in addition to the species of fish included in the subjoined
list, I received information at Wyndham, Cambridge Gulf, of a


large fish, weighing several hundred weight, apparently an
Oliooruv , that was occasionally taken in nets at the mouths of
neighbouring creeks I was unable to ascertain whether the
species was identical with OHgovu* Mitchelli Cast, of the West
Australian sea-board, or represented one of the two Queensland
types, 0 Urra-regmn and 0. goliath , L)e Y. It is possibly distinct
from either of these. A species of so called Barramundi —
probably the Giant Perch, Lates calcarif'er, Bl.—was reported to
me from the rivers and lagoons inland, from both Cambridge Gulf
and Port Darwin. Specimens could not be obtained at the
time for identification.
In connection with the invertebrate animals collected the
•class of the Mullusca claims the first attention. In this section
I have obtained the able assistance of Mr. C. Medley of the
•Queensland Museum, who has undertaken the identification of
the majority of the shells collected and has supplied the accom-
panying list. There are not so far as lam aware many novelties
among these Mollusca, though a certain portion of them may
possibly prove of value in illustration of the local distribution of
of previously known species. One of the forms, however,
obtained at Cambridge Gulf, is of more than ordinary interest,
and is apparently new to science. This is an exceedingly minute
species of oyster I found growing in great abundance, not only
on the stems, roots, respiratory shafts, or so called “ cobbler’s pegs ”
of the White Mangrove, Ariccnnia officinalis , but also, as shown in
the examples here exhibited, so thickly encrusting the growing
leaves of the same plant, that as many as fifty specimens may be
•counted on one leaf. The longest measurement of the finest
•examples does not exceed one quarter, or three eighths of an inch,
while in the majority of instances it is considerably less. That
the form is in its adult condition, and does not represent the
undeveloped stage of some larger species, was demonstrated by
the circumstance that numerous examples dissected and examined
with the microscope were found to be full of well developed
•embryos. The habit of the species is moreover essentially


distinct from that of any other oyster growing in their vicinity.
The one other species obtained from the same locality is apparent-
ly a local variety of the common Hock Oyster of the Australian
coast line, and which is most generally referred to fhe Ostvecir
glomeata of Gould. This species, however, in Cambridge Gulf,
and likewise at Port Darwin, is not accessible until the tide is
well down, while the minute form now under notice is found only
immediately below high water mark. The circumstance of its
growing abundantly on the leaves of the mangrove indicates that
this species is exposed to atmospheric influences for abnormally
long periods. Examples of this diminutive species of oyster were
given by me to Dr. J. G. Cox, of Sydney, to whom, —he being
an authority on the innumerable varieties of this mollusk--!
relegated the task of determining its specific identity, or of
describing it if new. In his opinion it is altogether distinct
from any form with whHi he was previously acquainted, and I
am anticipating ere long his report upon it. Under no process
of cultivation, I fear, will this remarkable oyster arrive at
the standard size, two inches, permitting of its being placed on
the public market.
1 hroughout my expedition I instinctively kept a keen look out
for all edible forms of the genus Ostrea. As already mentioned,
in the neighbourhoods of Port Darwin and Cambridge Gulf, a
variety of what I regard to be Ostrea qhmerata , or the common
Rock Oyster of this and the neighbouring colony of New Houth
Wales, was the predominating form. On my way up and down
he Queensland coast, and abreast of the Great Barrier Reef
moreover, I was constantly afforded by Captain Allison, of the
China Navigation Co.’s s.s. “ Tsinan,” the opportunity of landing
for an hour or so on one or two of the coral islands, including
those of Cairncross and the Howick Group. Here my attention
was attracted to a form of oyster that was very abundant in the
dead coral b’oeks exposed at low water. As exemplified by the
specimens exhibited, the distinctive external features of this form
when retaining its most normal and unrestricted development,


are its elongate lunate or somewhat scaphoid or boat-shaped
contour, the sharply defined and exceedingly even dentition
of its convex or ventral border, and its peculiar opaque pinkish
hue, which resembles that of many species of the marine calcareous
algae or nullipores. This species of oyster, as I have satisfied
myself by subsequent investigation, is identical with the Ostrea
mordax first described by Gould—Proc. boston Boc. Nat. Hist.
Yol. 111., p. 846, 1880—and incorporated under the same title
in Lr. J (I. Cox’s enumeration of the Edible Oysters found
on the Australian Coast. Proc. Lin. Soc. N. S. W. Yol. YU.,
p. 130, 1883. Had I met with this type in an isolated condition,
I might have felt inclined at first sight to have regarded it, as
do some more modern writers, as a locally modified variety of the
cosmopolitan Australian edible species Ostrea glomerata. Scattered
here and there, however, on the same coral rocks, was a large,
comparatively broad, black shelled oyster, that would be referred
without hesitation to that more familiar species I collected
an extensive series of specimens illustrating both of these two
types, the pink shelled and black shelled varieties, for further
examination and comparison, but regret to say that their brief
exposure on deck for a short interval pending their perservation,
proved too irresistible a temptation to some oyster connoisseur,
and all but a few specimens disappeared. Among those saved
is fortunately included one of the most interesting and instructive
of the series. This as represented by the example here exhibited,
illustrates a fully grown individual of the larger black-shelled
variety, attached to the same fragment of coral rock that supports
a group of the smaller pink- shelled type. The very fact of these two
exceedingly distinct oysters growing as itwere shoulder to shoulder
and under precisely identical conditions, is to my mind convinc-
ing evidence that they cannot be regarded as local varieties
only of a single species, but that on the contrary they possess
every qualification for independent specific recognition This
conclusion was arrived at by me at an early stage of their
examination, and a more careful subsequent investigation with
more materials at my disposal has further confirmed this


opinion. It has also assisted in the discovery of certain other
characteristic points of distinction between the two forms which
have apparently escaped the attention of previous writers.
Referring to the two species as Ostrea mordax and 0. glomerata—
the former being represented by the usually narrower, more
evenly dentated, pink-shelled type, and the latter by the more
expanded, irregularly dentate, black-shelled species,—l find that
Ostrea mordax is almost invariably attached to its support, and
with relation to the contained living animal, by the right valve,
the freely moveable or opercular valve being that of the left side.
In Ostrea glomerata, on the contrary, the predominating form of
attachment is by the left valve, the moveable or opercular valve
being that of the right side. From another point of view,
recognising the straight or more or less concave border of the
oyster’s shell as the dorsal, and the opposing or convex border as
the ventral edge, it may be represented that the direction of
curvature, as compared with the movements of the hands of a
watch laid horizontally, has in Ostrea mordax a tendency to
describe a right-winding, and in the case of 0. glomerata, a left-
winding spire. From a heap of the common market oyster,
0. glomerata, it is possible to pick a few examples in which the
attachment is by the right valve, the opercular shell being the
left one; but these are quite the “exceptions to prove the rule,”
and as shown in the several bunches here exhibited, and taken
hap-hazard from such heaps, the attachment is invariably by the
left shell. Similar exceptions may occur also in the case of
0. mordax, but the separate method of attachment described
being predominant in either instance, this feature may certainly
be accepted as an important accessory diagnostic distinction
between the two species. It may be further observed of Ostrea
mordax that adhesion is almost invariably effected throughout
the entire surface of the attached right shell, a circumstance
which renders it very difficult to detach these oysters from the
rocks without breaking them, and militates against their extensive
commercial utilisation. In the common Rock Oyster, 0. glomerata,
attachment is usually effected by the basal region or “ butt”


only of the attached valve, and it is due to this circumstance that
the clusters or bunches can be readily separated for the market.
Yet a third feature—apparently hitherto unnoticed, which
appears to me to afford a subsidiary point of distinction between
the two species, is the circumstance that the adductor muscle,
with its accompanying shell-impressions, is set much further
back or towards the distal or growing edge of the shell in
0. morrlax , as compared with that of 0. qlomerata. In the last
named species, it may be described as sub-central, while in Ostrea
mordnx its location more frequently intersects a line drawn
transversely midway between the centre and the distal border.
With reference to the distribution of Ostrea mordnx, I may
mention here that it occurs abundantly throughout the ocean
coastline of eastern Queensland. Among the specimens
now exhibited are some tine examples placed at my disposal by
Mr. Hedley, and which were collected by him in the neighbour-
hoods of Southport and the Curumbin Heads, a few miles
distance only from the New South Wales border.
Before leaving the subject of oysters, I may incident!? mention
here that the separate method of attachment that assists to dist-
inguish Ostrea mordax from 0. qlomerata is an altogether unstable
character in Ostrea edulis, and its varieties, as met with in the
Southern Colonies. In this species as demonstiated by quantities
artificially cultivated by me in Tasmania on slate and wood collectors,
the mollusk attaches itself indifferently by either shell. A similar
uncertainty as to the method of attachment obtains also in the
diminutive species found growing on the leaves of the mangrove
trees in Cambridge Gulf. Respecting the many other so-called
species of Australian oysters, I am not in a position to say much at
present. The entire nomenclature of the genus Ostrea has unfortu-
nately got into great confusion owing to the lavish multiplication
of species, on the basis, in many instances, of the most trivial local
variations. The tendency of more modern writers has been to cut
the Gordian knot, by lumping them altogether again as varieties
only of a single species. A more careful and exhaustive investiga-


tion of tlie subject will, I am inclined to think, indicate the
desirability of adopting a middle course, and load to the establishment
of several of the hitherto imperfectly defined species on a sounder
basis, and around which a greater or less number of the sub species
or varieties may then be satisfactorily grouped. In order to arrive
at this more desirable position, however, much careful work has to
be accomplished, and especially with reference to the acquirement of
a more perfect knowledge of the structural and developmental details
of the living animals that secrete the shells, upon which alon a their
specific distinctions have hitherto been based. In so far as the
opportunities will be afforded me o p , in such manner, investigating
the specific varieties indigenous to the Queensland Coast, I shall
hope to communicate a further report to some future meeting of
the Society.
The remaining Mollusca collected being of interest from a
museum rather than an economic standpoint, I have asked Mr.
Hedley, who is making this branch of zoology a special study,
to record any observations of interest that may be attached to
them. I may briefly mention here, however, that one great
prize in the form of a Pearly Nautilus, Nautilus pompilius,
with the living animal was narrowly missed. Early one
morning on the return voyage from Cambridge Gulf to Port
Darwin, some of the hands reported that a floating nautilus
shell with what was graphically described as “ something like a
cauliflower sticking out of it,” had just been passed. Captam
Yereker immediately ordered the ship to be put about, boats were
lowered, and a careful search was made along the wake just passed,
but without any result, the nautilus having evidently taken alarm
and descended again to its ocean bed.
Time has not yet permitted of ray working sytematically
through the collection of Crustacea. I f includes, however, a large
edible form of crab that excavates deep burrows in the mangrove
swamps in Cambridge Gulf and the neighbourhood of Port Darwin,
and is allied to, if not identical with, the Moreton Bay species,
Scylla serrata . Many varieties of prawns were taken with the aid of


a small prawn trawl, and some interesting phosphorescent Ostracoda
by the use of the towing net. These I propose to make the subject
of a future communication. Of the worm tribe, class Annelida, a
small collection was made including representatives of the two
leading groups distinguished by the respective titles of the
Dubicola and Errantia. Among the last-named section one equally
interesting type, Bonellia , was taken in some abundance with the
dredge in Cambridge Gulf.
The brief opportunity of landing on the Cairncross and Howick
Islands in the Great Barrier system was utilised to collect several
specific forms of the commercial varieties of the Beche-de-mer,
Trepangs, or Sea Cucumbers, as they are popularly called, and which
belong to that section of the Echinodermata, including also the
Sea-urchins and Starfishes, known technically as the Holothuroidea.
The examples collected, so far as I have been able to identify them,
would appear to represent the four species figured and described in
Semper’s work on this particuliar group, under the respective titles
of Holothuria atra , H. aculeata, H. scabra, and H. vAellus. It
afforded me much interest in studying the habits of these animals
in their native coral reefs to find that their method of feeding,
wh'ch has frequently been a subject of discussion, is essentially
identical with that recorded by me of certain of the smaller English
species,some years since, in the pages of “Nature.” The operation
is accomplished with the assistance of their proliferously capitat®
oral tentacles, and with which—while crawling over the submerged
rocks, or quietly resting in the tide-left pools—they gather up every
detachable organic substance and convey it to their mouth. First,
one tentacle is swept mop-wise over the rock or ground within
reach, and is then reflexed and thrust bodily into the oral cavity.
Immediately one tentacle is withdrawn, another food-laden tentacle
is reflected and ready to take its place, and in the same manner all
of the, from ten to twenty, tentacles are kept actively work in
supplying the commissariat. The substances found within the
alimentary cavities of these Holothuriae on dissection, consist chiefly
of fragments of coral, molluscous shells, and sand. Also to a very


great extent of the microscopic calcareous shells of the Foraminifera,
which occur in the living state in vast quantities on the reefs and
in the rock basins inhabited by the Beches-de-mer. These Fora-
minifera are thickly scattered over the surface of the various larger
objects swallowed by the Holothuriie, and evidently constitute their
chief food. In the case of other Australian and English species
belonging chiefly to the genen Psolus and Gucumaria , the tentacles
have a more finely divided plumose structure, but the modus operand’.
of feeding is essentially identical. Specimens kept in aquaria have
been observed by me creeping up the glass and sweeping off with
their tentacles the microscopic organisms, Infusoria and Diatoms,
that so speedily accumulate in such situations. In other instances I
have observed them, while in an otherwise sedentary condition,
continually thrusting out their tentacles into the surrounding water,
and alternately retracting them, being evidently occupied at such
times in capturing and feeding upon the Protozoa and other micro-
scopic organic particles freely suspended in the water.
On the same reefs and in the same pools frequented by the
Bech-de-mer, a species of Synapta was very abundant. The animal
has the organisation as a Holothuria, but is of a delicate pink
colour and of glass-like transparency. The surface of the skin is
also coated with minute anchor-shaped spicules, and bv means of
which it clings tenaciously to the fingers when handled. The
tentacles are utilised as food purveyors in the same manner as those
of the ordinary Beche-de-mer, but are of a different pattern,
being flattened and pinnately branched. Among the Echinoder-
raata presenting features of interest, observe 1 in the same locality,
may be mentioned a large Brittle Starfish allied to Ophiura
scolopendrina. This species abounded, its body being usually con-
cealed under the rocks or coral blocks, while the attenuate spinous
arms, sometimes as much as eighteen inches long, were thrust out
in every direction apparently seeking for food. The contents of
the stomachs of examples dissected were foun I to consist largely,
as in the case of the Holothurhe, of Foraminifera, mixed however
with a very considerable proportion of finely comminuted alga).
Like many of the Echini or Sex Urchins, they are apparently to a


considerable extent vegetarians. The aliinentative phenomena in
the varied representatives of the Class Echinodermata aie very
dissimilar. In the closely allied family group of the Ophiuridae or
Snake-armed Starfishes, by way of example, they are totally distinct.
Several species of this group were collected in the Barrier Reef and
also at Port Darwin, one of these being remarkable for the brilliant
emerald green tint of its snake-like arms. In an English species
of the same group, Ophiura texturata, kept by me in an aquarium,
the animals habitually lay buried in the sand. Immediately, how-
ever, that food in the form of minced fish or mussel was placed on
the surface of the sand, they emerged from their hiding place,
detecting the presence of the food apparently by a sense akin to
smell, and throwing their arms around it drew it to their mouths, or
more correctly dragged their bodies over and engulphed the food.
A considerable collection was made of representatives of
the Class Ooelenterata, including Madrepores or stony corals, Gor-
gonias or Sea-fans, Sea Anemones, and Jelly-Fish; coloured drawings
and notes of their living appearance being also recorded. The
time and opportunity not having been yet at disposal to write out
this somewhat extensive subject, further details are postponed for
some future occasion. It is desirable however, that I should
acknowledge here my indebtedness to the lion. W. Langdon
Parsons, Government Resident at Palmerston, Port Darwin, for
special facilities in collecting the Ccelenterata of that district, he
having placed the government steam launch at my disposal for
dredging purposes while that of H.M.S “ Myrmidon ” was under
repairs, Many valuable specimens were thus secured. The same
remark made of the Ccelenterata must apply also to the class of
the Protozoa including especially many rich gatherings of Formini-
fera. In an excursion made from Palmerston up the Darwin River
I succeeded in obtaining a varied collection of the minute Proto-
phytes known as Desmids, but which I have not the immediate
facilities for identifying.
Apart from the general natural history collections now
briefly summarised, some few objects were collected belonging to the


domain of anthropology, and certain of which are herewith exhibited.
These include several spear-heads most ingeniously manufactured by
the aborigines of the Kimberley Gold Field districts out of the
glass bottles they find round the settlers’ camps, and also a formid-
able tomahawk cleverly constructed from the segment of an iron
horse-shoe. The ordinary stone axe and spear-head manufactured
by the same aborigines is placed beside them. A pearl shell
ornament worn by the female representatives of the same tribe is
also shown. The aborigines in the neighbourhood of Cambridge
Gulf were not at all approachable, their signal fires were constantly
visible along the shore, and were evidently lit for the purpose of
warning their neighbours of the ship’s presence, but on no occasibn
did they appear within hailing distance. Respecting the signal fires
it was a frequent subject of remark that notwithstanding a strong
wind might be blowing, as evidenced by the drift of the
smoke of adjacent bush conflagrations, the thin line of smoke
from the special signal fires always ascended perpendicularly.
Along the route to the Kimberley Gold Fields the aborigines have
so far proved very treacherous and aggressive, though possibly not
without primary provocation. They have been known in several
instances to come to the settler’s tents and receive food on one day,
and return at daybreak the next morning and attack the camp.
This has naturally led to reprisal and the existence of much ill
feeling towards the aborigines on the part of the settlers. Unfortu-
nately the dialect of the natives in these parts differs entirely from
that of the tribes in North Queensland, and around Port Darwin,
with whom amicable relations already obtain, and through whose
medium the attempt has been made to establish friendly interviews.
Tree sculpture is pactised by the aborigines of Cambridge Gulf
district, probably as in the case ot the rock sculpture prevalent an ong
other Australian races, as a means of intertribal communication or
as a tribal record. Examples of such carvings embodying, so far
as decipherable, rude representations of various animals, engraved
on the back of a large Baobab or Bottle Tree, Adansonia Gregorii
were secured with considerable labour by Captain Yereker, the tree
being cut down and slabs including the carvings being carefully


removed. The engraved slabs were forwarded to the Melbourne
Centennial Exhibition, and are I believe still in the custody of the
Secretary to the permanent Exhibition Buildings. I may mention,
in conclusion, that I am indebted for the several aboriginal weapons
exhibited to the kindness of Dr. Baffin the Government Medical
Officer, residing at Wyndham, during the time of our visit. The
spear-heads, more particularly, had been brought in by a settler
who had been attacked and speared in his camp, and had come down
for treatment at the Wyndham Hospital.

same tint branching from the primary streak and indicating the
°utlines of the myotonies, a carmine patch at the base of the pectoral
fins, all the fins yellowish. Length—4 inches. Habitat.—Cam-
bridge Gulf and Port Darwin, N. Australia.
Holacanthus dariviniensis. s-k.
Preopercular spine smooth, slightly grooved, reaching to the
vertical from the hind margin of the operculum ; the dorsal and
anal fins rounded posteriorly ; scales small. Colour in life —ground
colour of the head and throat, and also the pectoral, ventral and
caudal fins, and the base of the tail, bright yellow ; the remainder
of the body and the dorsal and anal fins a deep purple black,
traversed by numerous undulating and occasionally branching
longitudinal bluish-white lines, about thirty such lines on the body
and about nine such lines on the dorsal and anal fins respectively.
A dark unstriated purple-black band extending vertually from the
front of the head through and enclosing the eye, and continued
slightly obliquely backwards to the chest; a yellow band extending
longitudinally along the dorsal surface of the body, encroaching


slightly on the dorsal fin, and connecting the yellow ground-colour
of the head with that of the caudal region ; a vertically disposed
elongate ovate area of opake white including the operculum, pre-
opercular spine, and base of the pectoral fin. Length-—8 inches.
Habitat—Port Darwin.
The two previously recorded Australian species of the genus,
Holacanthus sexstriatus C. $ K and //. Duboulayi, Gunth., belong
to that section in which the bands or striations are vertically-
disposed .

Descriptions of two New Yertebatbs in Mu. Saville-Kent’s
Collection.
Among the birds brought from Cambridge Gulf is a young
female Pachycephala which is identical with an adult of the same
sex previously procured at Kimberley on the Gulf of Carpentaria in
company with two males. These which have hitherto been sup-
posed to be P. lanoides, Gld., must now be considered to constitute
a distinct species. The writer proposes for it the name P. fretorum.
Adult male.—Above ash grey washed with olive green, but
losing that tint on the rump; upper tail coverts dark-brown
broadly margined with ash grey. All the head and face and ear
coverts black : si les of neck and a narrow pectoral collar black,
broadly margined with chestnut in continuity with a broad nuchal
collar o' the same. Wings brown: primaries narrowly, secondaries
and coverts broadly edged with ash-L r rey : chin, throat, lower chest,
abdomen, axillaries and under-wing coverts white : flanks grey:
tail dark-brown, feathers margined laterally and apically with ash-
grey ; legs and feet light-horn brown ; bill black.


The immature male wants the nuchal collar, has the pectoral
black band broader, its chestnut margin narrower, the beak dark
horn brown.
Adult female.— All above pale ashy brown ; ear coverts a
darker and glossiei brown ; a faint subocular line from the rictus,
tail and thighs brown ; primaries narrowly, secondaries and coverts
more broadly edged with ash grey ; chin and throat nearly
chest and upper abdomen pale buff : all the feathers from the chin to
the lower abdomen with a dark shaft streak—lower abdomen white :
flanks grey—under tail-coverts huffy white : legs, feet and inaudible
horn brown.

It will be seen from these measurements that P. fretorum is
inferior in size and different in proportions to P. lanoides. It is
further distinguished by the pectoral bands of black and chestnut,
and the chesnut collar occupying the whole neck on its upper surface.
Habitat—Southern shorts of Torres Straits.
Natricidao —Neospades,—g.n.
Habit stout, short, rounded : tail short, tapering, not distinct
from trunk. Head flat, subelongate, gently tapering, moderately
distinct from the neck, muzzle rounded ; an azygos prefrontal
shield ; poslfrontals moderate, vertical pentagonal. Two nasals,
nostril between, lateral—one loreal—two pre—and two post —oculars ;
labials in moderate number, scales keeled, anal divided, subcaudals
two rowed ; teeth minute, irregular, last maxillary grooved ; eye
moderate, pupil elliptical.
N. kentii.
Rostral broader than long, angular and separating the nasals
caudad ; prefrontal a nearly equilateral triangle with the angles.


truncated, separating the nasals rostrad and in contact with rostral,
post-frontals not longer than pre-frontal, Vertical nearly equilateral:
occipitals large, each followed by a post-occipital: nasals moderate ;
loreal large, subtriangular, with the upper and lower edges rounded.
Temporals three, the upper anterior the largest: upper labials eight,
the sixth the largest, the fourth entering the orbit ; scales in 21
rows, all the dorsals with a low and narrow keel not reaching the
tips, ventrals 188.
Yellowish grey, the body and tail with 54 dark-brown dorsal
bands with narrow interspaces, the bands giving off inosculating
streaks, and blotches on the sides ; under surface yellowish, the
scutes narrowly dark edged, an indistinct dark mcsian stripe, contin-
uous upon the anterior portion of the body beneath.
One example.—Habitat, Cambridge Gulf, N.W, Australia,
dedicated to the collector, Mr. W. H. Saville-Kent.
