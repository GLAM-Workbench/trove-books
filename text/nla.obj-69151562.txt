REPORT.
It is evident to all parties that missionary operations in
Fiji demand just now a very careful consideration and require
too a constant oversight and a wise superintendence. Never
before has the work caused so much anxiety to the mission-
aries as it does at the present time; and I suppose that I
may say too that the anxiety has been largely shared by the
Committee of the Society and many of its friends. Religious,
Political, Commercial, and Social events have during the past
few years been converging so rapidly and in such a marked
degree that we all feel that more must be done by the Society
if we are to maintain our position as a Church, and your
missionaries retain likewise their influence in the minds of
the natives. More must be done or the work which the Lord
has put into our hands (and which is the glory of the Metho-
dist Church) will decay; and that which still remains to be
done, in reclaiming those tribes which are still heathen, can-
not be undertaken. In the Fiji District, so marvellously as
the Lord extended our borders, that we now have 529 ~d-
Chapels, 353 other preaching places, 44 Native Ministers, 832
Catechists, 614 Local Preachers, 1986 Class Leaders, 18,550
Members, 5670 on Trial, 55,707 Scholars, and 105,782
Hearers. I think that it will be allowed that 12 mis-
sionaries are too few for such a work; and that little else
can be expected of them but that they exercise a general
superintendance over the whole. There is however great
danger in leaving too much detail to our Native Ministers; *
who, although they are good men and efficient as Preachers
and Pastors, lack administrative ability and are averse
to responsibility. In these matters they are but as


children and need constant superintendance and in-
struction ; yet, from the pressing necessities of the
work, we are compelled to leave some of them for months
together with a thousand accredited members under their
sole charge; and the oversight too of all the childrens? and
adults? schools devolving upon them. For several years the
Cakaudrovi Circuit has been without a missionary, and in
consequence has caused a vast amount of anxiety in the
minds of the brethren. Each successive year the district has
appealed for two men ; but the appeal has not been responded
to for want ?we suppose?either of the men or the means.
Then, again, there is a large and thickly populated district
<yn upon the west coast of Yitilevu, and situated a very great
way from the mission station at Hew a, with which Circuit it
is now a section, demands by its necessities the appointment
of a Missionary. Its requirements were fully placed before
the District Meeting of 1867, by the Rev. J. Carey and the
late Rev. T. Baker, and the Brethren, perceiving that by the
appointment of a Missionary to the Isadroga Section,
making it the head of a Circuit, not only would it tend to
conserve our young Churches upon that coast and the adja-
cent islands, but it would also be an excellent position from
whence Catechists could be readily sent to work among the
many tribes in the neighbourhood which are still heathen.
I would repeat the words of our Chairman, written to you
some time ago ?? The murder of Brother Baker will give us
ten thousand more Fijians to care for than we had before ;
but what can we do ? Here is our difficulty : how shall we
teach them ? The land is all before us, but we want Mission-
aries. We shall do all we can to keep our work from decay.
and we look to you to do all you can for a Mission which
God has so greatly blessed.? Thus for the more efficient
superintendance of the native work, as well as for the carry-
ing on of those attacks upon the citadel of heathenism which
have been so successful in the past we ought to have three or


four more missionaries in the group, so that the whole number
may be increased from twelve to sixteen, and if possible two
or three school-masters.
Upon the island of Rotumah we have now a flourishing / sCCp'./l
Church numbering 431 members and 59 upon trial for mem-
bership. The Rev. W. Fletcher, 8.A., has been labouring
there very successfully in establishing this church and in
getting into active operation the various agencies by which
the work is consolidated and extended. In addition to which
he has likewise translated the New Testament, translated the
Catechism and composed a Hymn Book, &c. &c. He now asks
permission to bring these his translations so that he may carry
them through the press, that the people may speedily read for
themselves words whereby they may be saved. A missionary
to occupy the station and carry on the work so admirably begun
by Brother Fletcher is absolutely necessary. The whole
population of the island being very small compared with that of
Fiji, it is hoped that when the New Testament is finished,
and the work on the island thoroughly established, it may be
safely left in the charge of our Native Ministers and the
European Missionary withdrawn.
Roman Catholic French priests have during late years been /'
very persevering in their efforts to disturb the minds of our
people in different parts of the District. They have lately
opened new stations, and to carry these on their number has
been increased to twelve. By threats of French men-of-war
they endeavour to frighten the chiefs out of their profession
of Protestantism into Popery ; and by directing their efforts
more particularly among our people rather than among
the heathen they hope to injure our work and strengthen
their own. It therefore behoves the society to make more
strenuous efforts to maintain the position which it now
occupies; and likewise to frustrate those which tend to make
the Fijians rest satisfied with that which is (as we see it)
but modified heathenism.

CD f ; The ecrease P�P u l a ti� n �f t,^ie islands is 00 a
matter of so serious a nature that it ought to incite us to in-
, y2, creased effort, so that they may be Christianized before they
become extinct. The Rev. J. Carey some time ago wrote
me to say that if the tribes round about Rewa were to
continue decreasing at the present rate that they would be
extinct in thirty years. From statistics of births and deaths
which I have by me, and which were collected from different
parts of Fiji the average is only six births to twenty-four deaths.
/This fearful decrease is not owing to strong drink, neither
J\ /, is it caused by diseases introduced by licentious white men.
The subject is a sad one and cannot be discussed in a mere
report. The rapid progress of the mission work in Fiji during
the past thirty years fills our hearts with thanksgiving and
praise; but still our joy is chastened when we think that
thousands must die in heathenism without having heard of
salvation, and that not because the ? arm of the Lord ? is
? shortened,? nor that His ? ear ;; is ?heavy ?to the cry of His
people; for experience teaches us that the Lord opens our
way before us as rapidly as we are prepared to carry the
work on.
I subjoin a few statistics which will shew very clearly
the rapid increase in all departments of the work during the
past ten years


Another very powerful argument for increased missionary
aid is the immigration of great numbers of white settlers and
their families. Eight years ago the majority of the whites
resident in the group were a very disreputable set. Now
however it is very different. Most of the influential and
respectable settlers who have during the past few years taken
up their residence there may be looked upon as the friends
of the mission, and they exercise a continued influence for
good. At Ovalau, Taviuni, and on the Rewa river there are
gentlemen who with their families look to this Society for
ministerial attention, and who are never backward in contri-
buting to our cause. I have ever thought it a great mistake
to shew our fellow-countrymen in the islands that we are only
sent to the Fijians, and have no time to give them that
attention which their circumstances demand. Whilst for
Christ?s sake and their souls? sake I would labour for the
benefit of the Fijians; yet, whilst endeavouring to benefit
the whites, in addition to these paramount reasons, we have a //
strong and powerful sympathy elicited in the fact of our one
nationality. Were they led to believe that we are more con-^
cerned about the salvation of an unthankful savage than
we are about theirs I think that they would despise us, and
most justly too. Let not circumstances compel your mission-
Aries to say that we cannot attend to their wants now; lest we
have to pay dearly for our inability or neglect by and bye.
For if those settlers and their families are deprived of the
means of grace to which most of them have been accustomed
in civilized society, and have not the restraints which a
Christian society exert, they will soon grow dreadfully
indifferent to religious influence, and will be a power for evil
wherever they go. If we give them suitable attention now,
then when difficulties arise between the two races ?as they
most assuredly will ?the results of the Society?s work will
be in a blessed manner apparent; for being the friends of all
and the enemies of none, we shall then be able to exercise


that influence which has been previously acquired, and be
likewise able to pour oil on the troubled waters. If we do
not manifest to the white residents that Christian solicitude
which their position demands whilst there is peace and cordial-
ity among all parties, then when dark days come and enmity
exists, ?when jealousies arise and retaliation for injuries
received by both parties is savagely enforced, if we attempt
to come in as peace-makers we shall be sullenly told to mind
our business and let theirs* alone. I would therefore most
respectfully but strongly urge upon the Committee the
necessity of so strengthening the mission that we may shew
ourselves the true friends of the whites by an early attention
to their spiritual wants, rather than by weak endeavours to
overtake the difficulty at some future time. They require
a minister of their own to whom they can look and ac-
knowledge as their pastor; and I have not the least
doubt but that they would fully support him in a
very short time. By late accounts from Fiji we learn that
there is a scheme on foot to procure a Church of England
/ (jtsiay /; clergyman ; this is a sign that we have already lost influence,
but it is not too late, for the scheme is fraught with many dif-
ficulties. To allay the prejudices which have arisen, to shew to
the whites in Fiji that we are not indifferent to their spiritual
interests, and to shew to the several Protestant Missionary
Societies who have left Fiji to our charge, that as a Society
we are doing our duty, I think that it would be advisable
for the Executive Committee to recommend the Conference to
appoint some Brother to have special charge of the English
work in Fiji.
The increase of ministerial help in the Fiji District involves
a proportionate amount of expense; but this ought not to
cause undue anxiety in the minds of the Committee ; for we
hope that Conference will make full enquiry as to whether
the machinery of the Society is kept in working order in
each Circuit from each Chairman of a District, and that a

missionary spirit will be revived in the hearts of Ministers
and people. By a reference to the amounts expended each
year in carrying on the work in the Fiji district, it will be
seen that the expenditure has not increased in the same pro-
portion as the increase which God has granted to us in all
departments of the work. The following statistics will shew

I have been told since my arrival in the Colony that the
Fiji District is a ? frightful expense.? Is �5OOO a sum which
can be called ? frightful ? when the vast extent of the work
is taken into consideration ? The District Meeting furnishes
each year to the General Secretary a detailed account of the
expenditure of each grant, even to the separate prices of the
various kitchen utensils necessary for the several mission
houses. Of this lam well assured, ?that if you take the
number of members in society, or the number of attendants
on Public worship, or the number of Chapels, or the number
of agents employed, ?take any one of these as a basis for
proportionate calculation and it will be found that the Fiji
mission is one of the cheapest known. Ceylon with only
1,562 members, and 5,365 hearers costs the Parent Society
�8074 12s. 6d. It may however be urged that there is little


comparison between the minds of the two races; that we can-
not hope to see such results in Ceylon as Fiji. This may be
allowed. Take however the African districts, and lam per-
suaded that the Fijian is as intelligent, as abominably bad,
and as difficult to deal with as the African, and there you
will find that in the 8 African districts there are only 19,294
members, whilst they have 84 missionaries involving a cost
of �21,029 2s. Id. In Fiji we have nearly the same number
of members viz 18,550 with only twelve missionaries assisted
by 44 Native ministers; the whole work necessitating a cost
of only �5OOO. Judged from a financial point of view all
must allow that the Society?s funds invested in Fiji yield
magnificent returns; and we desire that whilst there should
be a strict and close scrutiny into all matters of expenditure
the work may not be crippled or damaged by withholding
the necessary supplies or by false notions of economy.
Some time ago the brethren being most anxious to cut
down expenses according to instructions from the General
Secretary, it was thought that we could only do so by working
the Circuit Native Training Institutions at a less expense.
We expected that we could get more help from the chiefs
and people, and thus relieve the funds. We were, however,
mistaken; and I believe that harm has resulted in con-
sequence, and that it will soon be seriously felt throughout
the District if those Institutions cannot be taken up again
and carried on even more vigourously than they were before.
The average grant to each Circuit for these Institutious is
�l5 ; allowed for ? Educational Purposes,? With that sum
is purchased the Stationery for the Institution, and also all
that is required by the Catechists of the Circuits; it must
help too in purchasing food if the gardens do not yield suffi-
cient, and clothing for the men and their wives. lam well
aware that great difficulties are in the way of increasing our
staff of missionaries in the islands, that perhaps little more
can be done at present than replace those who are compelled
y?M
Jwf<


to leave the group. lam not ignorant of the wants of the
colonial circuits, nor blind to the great spiritual destitution
of the scattered populations of the interior. Being persuaded
of the liberal mindedness of the Committee, and having a
strong faith in the sympathy of the Conference towards the
Fiji mission I know that it will be strengthened with more
Missionaries if the men are to be had. But if we have them,
?or we fail to obtain them, ?I would urge the matter of
Training Institutions as being one of equally great importance.
I look upon these Institutions not only as the hope of Fiji in
a religious sense, but also as Fiji?s hope in a political and
social sense. If we can get a converted man who has also
been carefully grounded in good and religious principles sta-
tioned with every tribe then when the difficulties arise to
which I have already alluded these men will be on
the ground to allay or calm the storm of passion as it mani-
fests itself. But if we have to sefid out men whom we don?t
know, I very much fear that amidst political troubles some of
these men may add to them by leading the people away into
a diabolical fanaticism and call it religion, similar to the Hau-
haus in New Zealand. The Theological Institution at Kadavu
has already done an incalculable amount of good. The men
can be readily distinguished from their fellow-catechists by
the efficiency of their work and their general intelligence.
And we are glad to say that as a rule their residence at the
Institution takes the conceit out of those who are apt to think
of themselves more highly than they ought to think, rather
than to lead them to be proud and overbearing towards their
fellows who have not been privileged with such training.)/
Had it not been for the two hurricanes which literally swept /ff: ;?' ///? f-
the Institution twice to the ground and destroyed the gar-
dens, it would have been self-supporting two or three years
ago. If �3O per year were allowed each Circuit for educational Z ?
purposes it could then only be looked upon as a small amount .?> .i f
and it would be a great boon to Fiji. Many a time have we had


applications from towns for teachers when we have not had
lh em to send. At one of the last meetings over which I pre-
sided on Yanua Levu we had a great many requests for men.
One large tribe composing four towns had renounced heathen-
ism, built chapels and teachers houses, then they sent to us
confidently expecting a supply. We had none to send be-
cause we had not been in a position to train teachers. The
men are to be had ; men thoroughly converted, and willing
to go into the work wheresoever they may be sent; but we
know that they require, and we dare not send them without
some little preparation. Instead of having from six to ten
men in each Circuit Institution we should like the Committee
to enable us to have from twenty to forty; and without
this assistance we shall not be able to keep up with our
work as God extends it before us.
Ever since the departure from Fiji of Mr. Collis, the
want of a trained school master has been felt. The District,
therefore, upon the departure of the Rev. Mr. Calvert, re-
quested him to use his influence with the Committee to en-
gage two such agents who might be placed at the head of
Institutions, and devote their time to the special duty of
training young men for school-masters. Those men who
were trained by Mr. Collis still do good service by carrying
out the system of imparting instruction in which ho had him-
self been previously trained. Our men cannot strike out a
course for themselves. They confine themselves to the par-
ticular mode of conducting schools, which they have wit-
nessed at the Mission Station. This may evidence a lack of
ability. As, however, they can imitate successfully we ought
and must accommodate ourselves to those traits of character
which we find, and endeavour to develop those talents which
they have, and about which there can be no dispute. The
Rev. William Carey has proposed an Educational scheme,
which, if it could be carried out, would soon work a bene-
ficial change throughout Fiji. He aims at training school


masters, and providing a place and the means where and by
which the sons of Chiefs and the half-castes may have an
education suitable to their stations in life. The principal
difficulty is the want of an efficient school-master ?one apt
to teach ?who might be appointed to take charge of the es-
tablishment under the direction of one of the Missionaries.
One question for the Committee and the friends of the Mis-
sion in Fiji to take into consideration and decide upon is?
are we to rest content in Christianising the Fijians, or are we
to pursue our further work of Educating them. The work
hitherto has been Christianising ?preaching Christ, and
teaching them to read, so that they may for themselves read
words whereby they may be saved. Must we now Educate
or not ? No one, I presume, would answer in the negative;
for, were we to do so, we should deny those principles which
we cherish, and of which we are honourably proud. All
these subjects, therefore, resolve themselves into a matter of
�s. d. The Educational scheme would involve an extra ex-
penditure of �2OO ) the Circuit Training Institutions, �2OO
more ; and the additional Missionaries for native and Eng-
lish work, �600; so that instead of a yearly outlay of �5OOO,
as heretofore, the main question to be decided is this ?Can
the Society grant to the Fiji Mission �6,000 per annum, or
not?
I would now bring another matter before the Committee
of somewhat serious importance ; and one which is looked
upon by a majority of the brethren in Fiji with strong feelings
of uneasiness. It is that of the buying of lands in Fiji by the Cl l ijt
missionaries. The District Meeting held in June last passed
a resolution requesting the Conference to give a deliverance
upon the subject, so that if possible a settlement of the vexed
question may be arrived at. The right of a missionary buying
land we think can scarce be questioned; and we think too
that it would be a difficult matter to shew that there is one
law for the missionary and another one for his brother work-


ing in the Colonies. Neither can wo expect the Conference
to legislate upon a subject which is?or ought to be?a matter
of individual judgment and monetary means. But that the
mouths of gainsayers and persons evil disposed towards us
may be stopped ; and lest our influence as missionaries may
be injuriously affected among the natives and white residents ;
and lest it should be said of us ?as the New Zealanders said
of agents of a kindred society?that with one hand they
pointed us to heaven, whilst with the other they took the land
from under us ?/? we do most earnestly request that a deliver-
ance from the Conference be sent to the Fiji District about
missionaries becoming possessors of landed property, whether
obtained from the natives personally or through the agency of
white residents during the present unsettled and transition
state of those islands. As there is some fear that amidst the
multifarious business of Conference this subject may be passed
over or postponed, it would be desirable that the opinion of
the Executive Committee be given, and that it be sent to the
Conference in connection with the request of the District
Meeting.
.A Another matter, and one too of great importance to our
i,. f ; Churches in Fiji is that of the government of our Native min-
istry. But as this is a subject of disciplinary legislation, and
as such can only come before the Conference, I mention it to
show that there are just now so many matters of importance
connected with our district, that I should like the Committee
to request the Conference to appoint several influential men,
well conversant with mission matters and work, that they
form a Committee to consider these subjects and report upon
them, so that the Conference may be guided to just and wise
conclusions.
/ k /1 1 The last subject to which I would refer is the present com-
mercial and social state of Fiji, with more particular reference
to the white residents there. These are matters which ought
to be taken into serious consideration, for they are such which


will affect more or less our churches. The Society has ex-
pended since the commencement of the mission not much less
than �120,000 in promoting the interests of Fiji; and the
result of this expenditure, it having been greatly blessed of
God, is the present satisfactory state of Fiji for commercial
enterprise. Then too we must not forget the amount, not of cash
but labour and means, which the natives themselves have in-
vested in the great work of civilization. The Society?s ? five
pounds? have begotten ? other five,? Thus, it appears to me,
apart from the spiritual interests of Fiji, the Society cannot help
but feel a just concern in all events transpiring there. Com-
mercial schemes which may shortly seriously affect the
social interests of the Fijians, this Committee (being in trust
of those interests on behalf of the subscribers to the funds of
the Society until such time as an equitable government is es-
tablished there) is in duty bound meanwhile to take notice of
and take such steps as shall conserve those long established
and expensive interests, as well as to do its best to frustrate
any and every scheme which may be prejudicial to them. It will
be apparent to all that any clique or company of commercial
men engaging in transactions of considerable magnitude with
the natives if not placed under-the restrictions of law and
civil government is, to say the least about it, dangerous in
the extreme. The natives being in a transition state from
savage heathenism to Christian civilization, and being as-
tounded at the evidences of the wisdom and power of the
white man which are continually presented to them, have
generally a strong faith in the honesty of those who seem to
be the respectable representatives of the race which is held
in veneration by them. On the one hand there is every temp-
tation presented to the whites for duplicity and over-reaching;
and on the other hand there is the simplicity and ignorance
of the natives about all commercial matters, which can be
readily exercised upon and of which advantage may be taken.
Lands are thus transferred, and the seeds sown of future
fueds and of wars of races.


jyyvjvJ^
' / Enough has lately appeared in the public prints to assure
,f / every one that Fiji is largely concerned in a very questiona-
ble scheme of imported labour. In Queensland the system
has the advantage of supervision and is carried out with at
least a shew of legality and order. But there, although di-
rected by the Government, and controlled by the
magistrates, it has so many serious defects that it
is only looked upon as incipient slavery by many portions
of the community. In Fiji however the same system of
imported labour is carried on and is under the supervision of
H. M. Consul; but as there are no magistrates in the country
the Consul?s orders are questioned, and by some are despised;
so that it is in many respects optional with the planters
whether they fulfil their contracts with their labourers or not.
Whilst I know that by the majority the natives are treated
well; yet the fact that the planters have the power of using
the lash and that the natives have only the Consul to whom
they can appeal, and who can seldom be seen by them, is
sufficient to prove the system a bad one. That many of the
labourers have been deceived by false representations made
by skippers or super-cargoes can readily be proven ; and that
the imported savages are not qualified to make a civil contract
with their masters ?they being ignorant of and supremely in-
different to all such customs of civilized society?is sufficiently
well known. For the restraint of white residents as well as
the protection of the natives a government with wholesome
laws is absolutely necessary.
There are now in the islands hundreds of settlers and
each is a law unto himself; they have no checks or restraints
fa rf'i save those of public opinion ; and public opinion is very apt
yt /Vj6*. sadly demoralized and prejudicial to all social interests.
There have been serious crimes committed by whites which
could only be dealt with by a stretch of authority on the
part of the Acting Consul. A course of conduct, necessary
as it was for the protection of the interests of the community,


which might have caused his dismissal, if the friends of the
culprits concerned or personal enemies had protested against
it, and reported to the Imperial government. With others I
have had to act as constable in a free fight among fifty or sixty
quarrelling men; and on one occasion successfully interfered
and saved a man from the lash when a lot of justly incensed
whites were going to lynch him. Such matters ought not to
be. Whilst we can do nothing to stop immigration to Fiji ?
and I think that it would be a questionable matter to do so
if we could?and as our fellow-countrymen and their families
are going there by the score, we ought to do our best to se-
cure for those who are peaceably disposed a recognised au-
thority of law and order. We want in Fiji one who can not
only interfere in matters between the Fijians and whites, but
also one who can decide authoritatively between whites them*
selves. It would be a step in the right direction were the Im-
perial Government to grant magisterial powers to the Con-
sul ; but we want something more than this. One magis-
trate is not sufficient. We want a government and laws
which the Imperial Government could, if so disposed, give fy fiu
to us, by appointing a Commodant, one who would have the
powers of a Governor without the paraphanalia of vice - A*
royalty. He would be able to appoint magistrates over dif-
ferent districts, and would himself be looked up to as the
general protector of foreigners and natives. Six years ago
the Imperial Government declined to accept the sovereignty
of the group, and thought it better to ? leave the elevation,
civilization, and evangelization of the Fijians to the present
agency at work in the islands.? Whilst they thus declined
to enter upon this work of charity on behalf of the Fijians,
they expressed a great compliment to the Society, and
shewed its responsibility and honour, as they also shewed
their appreciation of this Society?s labours. Now, however,
whilst we would not urge the Imperial Government to under-
take the sovereignty of the Fiji Islands for the protection of the


fjj LJ * natives?seeing they decline such works of charity, I think that
�,we ought to go to the British Government, by presenting a res-
I / | ? pectful address or petition to Her Majesty?s representative?
and say,?that as far as the natives are concerned, we can and
are prepared to go on with our work among them; but now
that so many British subjects have gone to reside in Fiji, we
greatly fear that the work which has cost so much labour and
capital will be hindered and damaged, if law and order are
not maintained. And that if the British Government declines
to take the protectorate of the Islands which has been offered
to them, ?and would be again if it were thought it would
be accepted?that we respectfully submit that it should en-
deavour to keep a check upon its own subjects and maintain
its sovereignty over them wheresoever they may roam.
