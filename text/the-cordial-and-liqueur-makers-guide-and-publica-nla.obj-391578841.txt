PREFACE.
The following Receipts are offered to the public as
the result of nearly thirty years’ practical experience in
the trade; some of them are quite new. Explicit in-
structions are given with each Receipt, so that the most
uninitiated may operate with the greatest certainty of a
favourable result, providing the ingredients are of first-rate
quality. I recommend all who use these Receipts to go to
a respectable wholesale house for Essential Oils, and not to
be particular about the price, when quality is considered.
Two shillings per ounce in the price of the Oil will not
make two pence per gallon difference in the price of the
Cordial, which cannot be an object. Essential Oils are
frequently adulterated to a great extent with oil of tur-
pentine, spirits of wine, &c.




CORDIAL & LIQUEUR MAKERS’
GUIDE.
Ten Gallons of Peppermint.
Mix half an ounce of best English oil of peppermint with a pint
of strong spirits of wine, shaking it about well: put this into your
cask. Next put in three gallons of clean rectified spirit proof.
Dissolve thirty pounds of good lump sugar in three gallons of hot
water; put this to your other ingredients, and fill the cask up to
within an inch of the top with water. Fine it with one ounce of
alum, dissolved in boiling water; put it into the cask hot, and stir it
about well; then put in half an ounce of salts of tartar, and rouse
it up again. In a day or two it should be perfectly bright.
Ten Gallons of Cloves.
Mix one ounce of oil of clones with a pint of strong sprits of wine;
put it in your cask; then add three gallons of clean rectified spirit
proof, and stir the whole well together. Dissolve twenty-eight pounds
of lump sugar in three gallons of boiling water; put this to the other
ingredients, and fill the cask to within an inch of the top with water.
Fine it down with one ounce of alum, dissolved in boiling water, and
put into the cask hot; afterwards put in half an ounce of salts of
tartar, and rouse it up well. In a day or two it will be perfectly
bright. This cordial is usually coloured pink—sometimes red, brown,
&c. For the various colouring ingredients, see “ Miscellaneous
Eeceipts,” p. 9.
Ten Gallons of Rum Shrub.
Procure one gallon and three-quarters of bitter Seville orange juice
(or, what is preferable, buy the oranges, cut them in half, and squeeze
them yourself); put it into your cask, and add three gallons of proof
rum. Dissolve thirty pounds of lump sugar in three gallons of
boiling water, and put it to the other ingredients, and fill thb cask to
within an inch of the top .with water. Fine it down as follows:
Pound fine one ounce of chalk, and lay it in front of a fire until
perfectly dry; stir this into the cask; and lastly, add half a pint of
ale finings, stirring it up again. It will very likely be upwards of a
week before it is fit for use.


Ten Gallons of Aniseed
Mix one ounce and a dram of oil of aniseed with a pint °f strong
spirits of wine, shaking it up well; put it in your cask, and add three
gallons of clean rectified spirit proof. Dissolve thirty-two pounds of
lump sugar with three gallons of boiling water, and mix it with the
other ingredients. Fill your cask to within an inch of the top with

and put into the cask hot, afterwards adding one ounce of salts or
tartar, and rouse well up.
Ten Gallons of Caraway.
Mix one ounce of oil of caraway with a pint of strong spmts of
wine, shaking it well in a bottle; put it in your cask, and add two
gallons more of spirits of wine. Dissolve thirty-four pounds of lump
sugar in four gallons of boiling water, and put it to the other articles.
Fill the cask up with water, and fine down with two ounces of alum
dissolved in boiling water, and put into the cask hot. Afterwards add
one ounce of salts of tartar, and rouse the whole well together.
Ten Gallons of Noyeau.
Mix half an ounce of essential oil of bitter almonds with a quart
of strong spirits of wine, and shake it well; put it into your cask,
and add a quarter of an ounce of oil of cassia, dissolved in another
pint of spirits of wine. Next put in three gallons of clean
rectified spirit proof, and rouse them up well. Dissolve thirty-two
pounds of good lump sugar in three gallons of boiling water, and
mix all together. Fill up the cask with water, and fine with two
ounces of alum dissolved in boiling water; put into the cask hot;
and lastly, one ounce of salts of tartar. Stir the whole well together.
Ten Gallons of Raspberry.
Buy the fruit fresh gathered, and squeeze it through a bag made of
sampler cloth (which may be bought at any respectable linendraper’s).
When you have got five gallons of juice, put it in your cask, with
thirty pounds of common lump sugar dissolved in two gallons of
boiling water. Add two gallons of strong spirits of wine, and rouse
the whole well together. Now draw off about half a gallon of the
mixture, and stir into it a quarter of a pint of brandy colouring (see
page 9); return this to the cask, and rouse well up again. Fine it
down with half a pint of ale finings.


Ten Gallons of Gingerette.
Bruise two pounds of good ginger with a hammer, and steep it in
five quarts of spirits of wine for a fortnight in a close-stopped bottle,
shaking it up frequently; pour off the spirit, and put into the cask.
Continue to put a quart of water into the bottle with the ginger every
day, pouring it off each time, until by tasting it you find all the spirit
has been washed out; put this likewise into the cask. Add two
gallons of white Cape wine, a quarter of a pint of brandy colouring,
thirty pounds of lump sugar, and a quarter of an ounce of citric acid,
dissolved in three gallons of boiling water. Fill the cask up with
water, and fine it down with half a pint of ale finings.
Ten Gallons of Orange Bitters.
Take five pounds of dry Seville orange peel cut into small pieces,
one ounce of caraway seeds, and six ounces of coriander seed, bruised.
Steep all in three gallons of proof spirit for a month ; pour off the
spirit in a hah? sieve, and return all the seed into the bottle; wash
out all the remaining spirit in the ingredients, by putting a quart of
water daily, and pouring off each time, until by tasting you find there
is none left. Add twenty pounds of lump sugar dissolved in two gal-
lons of boiling water, and half a pint of brandy colouring ; fill up the
cask with water. Fine it down with two ounces of alum dissolved in
boiling water, and put into the cask hot; afterwards stir in one ounce
of salts of tartar.

dissolved in hot water. Fine it with half an ounce of alum boiled in
half a pint of water.
Ten Gallons of Lemonade.

tallized), in three gallons of boiling water. Add seven gallons of
capillaire ; and if wanted to keep any time, also add a quart of spirits
of wine. Mix well together.
Ten Gallons of Capillaire.
Break eighty pounds of finest lump sugar into a copper, and add


five gallons of water; keep stirring it until it boils, then add a table
spoonful of pyroligneous acid, and stir it well in, keep boiling a quarter
of an hour, and leave it in the copper until cold; draw off clear from
the sediment.
Ten Gallons of Cherry Brandy.
Buy the largest black cherries you can get, mash them first in a
tub, and squeeze them through a bag made of sampler cloth, until you
have five gallons of juice, which put into your cask with two gallons
of strong spirits of wine. Dissolve twenty-six pounds of lump sugar
in two gallons of boiling water, add a quarter of a pint of brandy

and put into the cask hot; afterwards add one ounce of salts of tartar,
and stir the whole well together.
Ten Gallons of Cinnamon.
Mix one ounce of oil of cinnamon with a quart of strong spirits of
wine, shaking it up well in a bottle, next put in three gallons of clean

product will be a fine violet.
Pink.—Steep four ounces of cudbear in a quart of strong spirit for
a fortnight, and filter.
Beown. —See “Brandy Colouring.”
Brandy Colouring.
Put twenty-eight pounds of lump sugar into a brass or iron pan
with one gallon of water, and boil it until quite black on the top, add
one gallon and a half of boiling water, and boil it ten minutes longer.
Yellow Colouring.
Two ounces of turmeric or saffron root bruised, put into a pint of
spirits of wine for a month, shaking it frequently; filter through blot-
ting paper.
British Brandy.
To ten gallons of cleanest rectified spirit put two ounces of bitter
almond meal, half an ounce of mace pounded, half an ounce of orris
root sliced, and one ounce of cassia buds ground, shake it frequently
for a fortnight, and then add one ounce of terra japonica finely pul-
verised, two ounces of sweet spirits of nitre, and half a pound of
prunes ; let it be well roused up, and after it has stood another fort-
night it will be fit for use. Colour with brandy colouring if you need
it darker.


Spirit Beading.
I ■
To put a fine bead on fifty gallons of weak spirits.—Take one dram
of oil of vitriol, and one dram of oil of sweet almonds, rub them
together in a marble mortar, and when well incorporated, add by
degrees half a pint of spirits of wine, mix with the spirits, and rouse
up well.
Gin Flavouring.
Take one ounce of oil of juniper, one dram of oil of sweet fennel,
four ounces of essence of angelica, and an ounce of tincture of capsi-
cums ; mix altogether in a quart of strong spirits of wine, add it to
one gallon of capillaire. If gin is reduced to a very low strength, add
as much as will fetch up the flavour.
Finings for a Butt of Sherry Wine.
Put two ounces of isinglass into a jar with one quart of sherry near
the fire, when soft beat and whisk it up to a froth with the whites of
six eggs, thoroughly mix the whole with a gallon of the wine, and
return it to the cask, rouse the whole well up. This will answer
equally well for Marsala, Madeira, &c.
Finings for a Pipe of Port Wine.
Take the whites and shells of sixteen eggs, and beat them up to a
froth in a tub, add a gallon of the wine and whisk it up well again;
put the mixture into the cask, and rouse the whole well up. The same
for Bed Cape.
Finings for a Pipe of White Cape.
The same as for a butt of Sherry, with the addition of a quart of
milk with the cream taken off.
Ale and Porter Finings.
Take any quantity of isinglass, and put it into a tub or pan with
sufficient hard ale or porter to cover it; as the glass swells, keep adding
more liquid, until the whole is formed into a stiff jelly ; rub it through
a hair sieve and add hard ale or porter until the whole is of the con-
sistency of thick cream. A pint of this is sufficient for a barrel of ale
or porter.


Finings for Gin, Whiskey, &c.
For 100 gallons, take two ounces of roach alum and boil it in a
quart of water for a few minutes ; put it into the liquor hot, and
add one ounce of salts of tartar : rouse well up.
To make 100 Gallons of Gin.
To eighty-two gallons of clean rectified spirit proof add the follow-
ing:—li oz. of oil of juniper (English), oz. of essence of angelica;
J oz. of oil of sweet fennel; i oz. of oil of bitter almonds; 1 oz. of
oil of coriander, and J oz. of oil of caraway. Mix the whole of the
oils with a gallon of spirits of wine 60 0.p., having first taken the
precaution of rubbing them down in a mortar with a little lump sugar,
add this to the spirit, and after having well mixed the whole add
seventeen gallons of water; fine it down with 4 oz. of alum and 4 oz.
of salts of tartar.
To make-up Gin for Sale.
For 100 gallons:—l oz. of oil of juniper, J oz. of oil of bitter
almonds, i oz. of oil of caraway, \ oz. of oil of cassia, and J oz. of
oil of vitriol; rub the whole of these down in a mortar, with a little
sugar and a quart of spirits of wine 60 o.p. Boil 1 oz. of chillies in
a quart of water gently, until it has reduced to a pint, and strain.
Put the whole into the gin, with forty-five pounds of lump sugar, and
twenty-five gallons of water. This gin, which is in reality about 35
u.p., will taste as full of flavour and as strong as 17 u.p.
To improve a Puncheon of Rum.
After the rum has been racked into the vat, and reduced'to the
selling strength, add six gallons of'good old sound porter, four pounds
of honey well mixed with a gallon of the rum, and a pound of green
tea. The addition of a couple pounds of prunes is, I think, an im-
provement ; they should be struck with a hammer to break the stones.
After all is in the vat rouse it well up night and morning for three
days. If the honey prevents it going bright in the usual time, add
half a pint of ale finings, which will have the desired effect.


FOREIGN LiaUEURS.
Directions for Mixing and Managing, &c.
As the following receipts contain merely the names and quantities
of the several ingredients, the instructions for the method of proceed-
ing with them must be particularly attended to—viz.;
All dry substances, such as cloves, cinnamon, &c., should be
ground. Leaves and flowers, orange peel, figs, &c., and all fresh and
soft substances, must be cut up into the smallest possible pieces, and
always used fresh, if they can be procured; if not, use them dry;
but double the quantity will in many instances be required. Almonds
and fruit kernels must be beaten to a paste in a marble mortar, with
a small quantity of spirits to prevent them oiling.
When the several ingredients have been prepared, as above, put
them into a jar well corked up, with the quantity of spirit ordered,
and allow it to remain a month, shaking it frequently eveiy day, and,
if possible, kept in a very warm situation; at the expiration of this
time pour off the spirit and add the quantity of water ordered in the
receipt; let this stand a few days, shaking it up as before ; then pour
off, press out all the liquid, and mix with the spirit, add the sugar and
colouring matter and filter through a flannel bag. If essential oils
are ordered, a small quantity of the pure spirit should be kept back
to mix with them, and added to the other materials previous to
filtering.
In a few instances gold and silver leaf is ordered, which is prepared
in the following manner:—Get a few leaves such as are used by
gilders, and spread them on a plate which has a little thin syrup on
it, cover the leaf also with the syrup, and with two forks tear it into
small pieces, about the size of a canary seed. These precautions are
necessary, as, if you attempt to break them in a dry state, one half
will go into dust, and spoil the appearance of the liqueur; it should
not be added until the liqueur is in the bottles.
