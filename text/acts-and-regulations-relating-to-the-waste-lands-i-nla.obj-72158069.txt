REGULATIONS
FOR THE
SALE OF CROWN LANDS.
Colonial Secretary s Office,
Brisbane, ?2oth November, 1860.
riNHE recent passing of the Act of the Legislature, 24th Victoria,
I No. 15, ?to provide for the Alienation of Crown Lands,
having in some respects altered the conditions under which Land Sales
are henceforth to be conducted in the Colony of Queensland, His
Excellency the Governor, with the advice of the Executive Council,
is pleased to declare that all former Regulations in that behalf shall,
from the date of the present notice, be cancelled, and that the following
are established in their stead.
By His Excellency s Command,
R. G. W. HERBERT.
Periodical Sales by Auction.
1. With certain exceptions, all Crown Lands will be sold by public
auction. Sales by auction will be held as often as .the demand tor land
in each district, the extension of settlement, or other considerations may
require. Sales will also take place in the chief districts at fixed inteivals,
of which previous notice will be given in the Government Gazette at the
commencement of each year.
Land Sales to be proclaimed
2. All intended Land Sales will be notified by Proclamation in
the Government Gazette? the exact number of lots to be sold, and
the situation and area of each will be specified in such Proclamation.
A Proclamation will not be altered, amended, or rescinded, except
under special circumstances.


Sales to be notified not more than three months or less than one
month prior to Sale.
3. No such Proclamation will be issued at an earlier date than
three months, or a later date than one month, before the day of sale.
Lands may be withdrawn from Sale after Proclamation,
4. The Government reserves to itself the power to withdraw any
lots after such Proclamation, and even up to the moment previous to
the fall of the hammer at sale. This power, however, will not be
exercised except in cases of unforeseen necessity, nor for the sole
purpose of bringing forward the lots at some future period at a higher
upset price.
Classes of Lots.
5. Lands will be brought forward for sale by auction in three
different classes, viz.;?
1. Town Lots.
2. Suburban Lots.
3. Country Lots.
1. Town Lots. ?Town Lots will comprehend the lands
within the actual boundaries of Towns.
2. Suburban Lots. ?Suburban Lots will comprehend lands
lying within the distance of two miles from such towns;? The two
miles being determined by section lines East and West, North and
South, two miles from the outer limits of the town in each direction.
But should it be considered that any such lands will not derive any
increased value from their vicinity to the town, they may be excluded
from the class of Suburban Lots.
3. Country Lots. ?Country Lots will comprehend all
lands not included in any other specific class.
Area of Lands for Sale of the several classes.
6. Unless circumstances shall render a deviation in special cases
advisable, the following will be the respective areas of the different
classes of lands brought forward for Sale.
Town Lots, will be sold in portions of from one quarter of an
acre to one acre.
Suburban Lots, in portions of from one acre to twenty acres.
Country Lots, in portions of from twenty acres to six hundred
and forty acres.
Special Country Lots, or lands which from position or otherwise


are deemed to possess peculiar advantages, will be sold in portions
varying from one acre to six hundred and forty acres.
Sales to be held in the Local Land Offices.
7. The Land Agents in the different districts of the Colony will
conduct all Sales at their respective offices, and will at the time of sale
notify the conditions of such sale.
Survey and Sale of Lands in special localities.
8. Persons desirous of obtaining lands in particular localities may
make application to have such lands surveyed and brought forward
for sale, and, so far as circumstances shall permit, the application will be
complied with.
All such applications must be made in the form A in the annexed
schedule, and addressed to the Surveyor-General.
Upset price of the different classes of Land.
9. Country Lots will be put up at the minimum price of one
Pound per acre; but Special Country lots, and Town and Suburban lots,
will be first offered at such prices as circumstances may suggest as being
a fair approximation to their real value.
Mode of Payment.
10. A deposit of ten per cent must be paid at the fall of the
hammer upon each purchase, and the residue of the purchase money must
be paid within one month from the date of Sale. The Land Agent will
receive the deposit and balance, for transmission to the Treasury, and
will in each case give the prescribed form of receipt for the same.
Certain Lands open to Selection, or Sale without competition.
11. Any Country or Special Country Lots which have been
offered for sale by auction and not sold, will be open to Selection, at the
price at which they may have been offered. And any such lands which,
having been sold, have been forfeited by reason of non-payment as
prescribed, will also be open to purchase without competition, but at the
price at which they were previously sold, less the amount of deposit paid
and forfeited. In each of these cases the claim of the first applicant will
be preferred, provided he pays at once to the Land Agent the full amount
of the purchase money. No claim will be acknowledged that is not
accompanied by a Tender of the purchase money.
Form of Application for purchase by Selection.
12. Every application for Purchase by Selection must be made in
the Form B in the annexed Schedule; and no alteration in any


particular in such application will be allowed after it has been delivered
to the Land Agent; nor will any lands so selected be allowed to be
exchanged for any others not originally selected.
Town and Suburban Lands not open to Selection.
13. The right of Selection will not be applicable to any Town or
Suburban Lots which may not have been sold when offered, or which
having been purchased have again reverted to the Crown by forfeiture,
unless it shall be notified specially that they are so' open to Selection; in
which case they will be dealt with in the same manner as Country
Lots.
Lands may be withdrawn from Selection.
14. The Government may withdraw any lands from the list of such
as may be open to Selection, for the purpose of again bringing them
forward to Sale by auction, or for any other purpose which may be for the
public interest.

15, The boundaries of Agricultural Reserves will be proclaimed
from time to time as provided for in the Act.
Survey and Proclamation of Allotments in such Reserves,
16. Allotments in Agricultural Reserves will be surveyed in
portions varying from forty to one hundred and sixty acres in extent;
and, when so surveyed will, by Proclamation in the Government Gazette ,

thereof.

20. The holder of any land within an Agricultural Reserve
will be required within six months from the date of his purchase to
occupy and commence to improve the land so purchased, or such other
contiguous land as may have been leased, by him. In default thereof,
such land may be declared forfeited, and again open to selection, and
the price of the purchased land, less ten per cent., returned to the
purchaser.
Purchase of Lands in Agricultural Reserves to convey right to Lease
contiguous Allotments.
21. The purchaser of any allotment within an Agricultural
Reserve will, upon application in form D in the annexed Schedule,
be allowed to lease for five years any allotments contiguous to his
purchased land, if not previously sold or leased. But such lease shall
not comprise lands of greater area than three times that of the
applicant?s purchased land within such Reserve; nor, as before stated,
can his entire holding by purchase and lease exceed three hundred and
twenty acres.
Right to Pre-emption over Leased Lands.
22. If the Lessee of any lands within an Agricultural Reserve
shall have fenced in such lands he will have the right to Pre emption
thereover, although there may be other applicants for the purchase of
the same by the usual course of selection.

23. The Rent for the first year of Lease must be paid to the Land
Agent at the time of application for such Lease ; and for each succeeding
year of its currency the rent must be paid on or before the 30th of

further claim to the land so leased to him ; but he will be permitted to
re-establish his right by payment, within sixty days from the proper rent
day, of the full amount of rent, with a further sum, by way of penalty,
equal to twenty-five per cent, thereon.


Commencement and duration of Leases.
24. All Leases of Lands within an Agricultural Reserve will be for
five years, and will date from the first of January. But in cases where
the application for a Lease has been made subsequently to the 30th of
June the Lessee will be required to pay only half a year?s rent for the
remainder of the current year.
Leases subject to forfeiture if not fenced in within eighteen months.
25. If any Lessee of Lands within an Agricultural Reserve shall

a period of eighteen months from the commencement of such lease, he
will forfeit all title thereto, and the lease will be immediately cancelled.

other than for gold or coal, will be permitted to do so, without
competition, to the maximum extent of Six Hundred and Forty acres in

by depositing a sum equivalent to one-fourth the entire purchase money
for as many aci'es as may be comprised within their selection. The price
of such mineral lands will be One Pound per Acre, except as hereinafter
specified.


Boundaries of Mineral Lands.
31. Should any portion of surveyed lands be included in any
application for Mining purposes, it will be necessary that the whole of
such surveyed portion be taken by the applicant. But should no
survey have been effected, the boundaries of the selected portion must
be right lines directed to the cardinal points, and the length must not
be more than twice the breadth. No deviation from this rule will be
allowed, except in cases where the features of the country or the
boundaries of adjacent surveyed lands may render it necessary.
Minimum extent of Selections for Mining purposes.
32. No smaller portion than Eighty acres shall be comprised in
an application for purchase of Mineral Lands, unless it be the intention
of the applicant to purchase only a surveyed allotment of less area.
Selections for Mining purposes inadmissible upon Town Lands.
33, No lands comprised within the boundaries of any proclaimed
town site, will be sold for mining purposes.
Minimun price may be increased in certain cases.
34. If the proximity of any town, or any other local advantages,
irrespective of their mineral character, shall be considered to attach a
higher value than One Pound per acre to any lands selected for Mining
purposes, the Government will determine the price at which such lands
may be purchased. The applicant, however, will have the option of
withdrawing his application in cases where a higher price than One
Pound per acre may be considered the proper value of the land he
desired to purchase, and his deposit of Five Shillings per acre will be
returned to him.
Reservation from Sale of Mineral Lands.
35. The Government will use its discretion in granting or re-
fusing applications for the purchase of Mineral Lands according as a
due regard to the public interests may seem to render advisable.
Conditions of purchase of Mineral Lands.
36. If within one year after the approval of an application
and payment of deposit on account of a purchase of any Mineral
Lands, it shall be proved to the satisfaction of the Government that a
sum equal to the amount of the purchase money has been expended
on such lands in the searching for or working of any mineral, the
product thereof, a Deed of Grant will be issued in favor of the appli-
cant for such lands upon payment into the public Treasury of the
remaining three-fourths of the purchase money thereof. The original
deposit, however, will be forfeited, and no Grant will be issued, or claim
acknowledged, unless these conditions are observed.

intended land purchases, will be permitted to do so, and will receive
such a receipt for the deposit as will be available as cash for any pur-
chase of land made either at auction or otherwise.

38. Land Receipts, Remission Certificates, or Land Orders, will

the holder thereof for further purchase of land: and the Receipt,
Certificate, or Order will be returned to him endorsed with the amount
to which it has been used, and the balance for which it is yet
serviceable.
Land Receipts and Land Orders Transferable.
09. The transfer of a Land Receipt or Land Order will be per-
mitted conditionally upon an endorsement being made thereon, as in
the case of Bills of Exchange; and that person will be deemed the
holder thereof whose name shall appear last in the list of endorse-
ments ; and from such last named person only, or his accredited agent,
will the Receipt or Order be taken by the Land Agent in payment for
any purchase made.

issued under Regulations made under the authority of Her Majesty to

LANDS WITHIN THE COLONY OP

and 24 Victoria, No. 12, His Excellency the Governor, with the advice
of the Executive Council, directs it to be notified that the following

to the provisions of the said recited Acts.
Ilis Excellency's Command,

2. The District of Leichhardt
3. The District of Maranoa
4. The unsettled portion of the District of Wide Bay and Burnett

Duties of Commissioners of Crown Lands.
2. The duties of the Commissioners of Crown Lands to be ap-
pointed under the Act 24 Victoria, No. 11, shall consist in executing the
provisions of that Act in the manner specified in the following Regulations,
and in such other instructions as they may from time to time receive.
First occupation by License from local Commissioner.
3. The first occupancy of Crown Lands in the Unsettled Districts
will be by License, for one year, under the hand of the Commissioner of
the District in which the Lands applied for may be situated. Application,
in the form A in the annexed Schedule, must be made to the Commis-
sioner, who will, if no objection exists, issue to the applicant a License, in
the form B in the annexed Schedule, to occupy the Lands applied for,
for the space of one year. Should two or more persons apply at the same
?time, for the same country, the preference will be given to that person
who may first have occupied it with stock during any period not exceed-
ing sixty days before the making of the application.
Applications to contain a clear description of the Lands applied for.
4, All applications must contain a clear description of the Run
applied for, with reference to the leading features of the adjacent country,
as also of the boundaries and estimated area of such Run.
Requisite Area and Shape of Runs.
5. Within the boundaries of the run so described, an area of not
less than Twenty-five, nor more than One Hundred, square miles shall be
comprised : and each portion shall be, as nearly as practicable, of rectan-
gular form, and of equal length and width.
Deviation from this form will be permitted only when the general
features of the country, or the adoption of natural boundaries, (at all
times desirable), may render it necessary.
Restriction as to Water and Water Frontage.
6. A Run may not include the whole of any water necessary to
the beneficial occupation of adjoining lands, and as a general rule, will
be restricted to one side of any principal water-course.
Unavailable land may be excluded in the computation of Area.
7. Any lands lying within the external boundaries of a Run, and
not exceeding one-half the total area, which may be wholly unavailable
for pastoral purposes, may be excluded, by the Commissioner, from the
computation of area whereon license is chargeable.


Applications for License to be registered by Commissioners, and open to
inspection.
8. All applications for License to occupy Crown Lands shall be
entered in a General Register to be kept by the Commissioner of each
District for such purpose ; and such Register shall be retained at the local
office of the Commissioner, and will be open to inspection by any person
desiring to refer thereto, upon payment of a Search Fee of Two Shillings
and Six Pence. This Register must be signed by each applicant, or his
accredited agent; and in the event of (in applicant not desiring to name
another agent, he may, by an authority endorsed on his application, or by
an authority in writing to be filed with such application, empower the
Commissioner to sign as such agent.
Amended description of Run to be inserted in the Register.
9. Should the description of the Boundaries of a Run applied for
be not sufficiently clear, it shall be amended, so far as practicable, by the
Commissioner, and, in its amended form, be inserted in the License, and
in the Commissioner?s Book.
Amount of License Fee chargeable, and consequences of Default.
10. The License Fee for lands obtained in the manner before-
mentioned, will be computed at the rate of Ten Shillings per square mile,
and the Licensee shall pay such Fee into the public Treasury of the Colony
within a period not exceeding ninety days from the date of the License*
or from its notification in the Gazette.
Licenses will be refused to Defaulters.
11. The Government reserves the power of refusing to grant a
License to any person who has previously failed to pay the License Fee
according to the preceding Regulation.
Licensed Runs not transferable, unless Stocked to One Quarter of their
capabilities.
12. No License will be transferable, except by operation of law,
unless the Run so licensed shall have depasturing upon it at least twenty-
five sheep or five head of cattle or horses per square mile.
Leases for Fourteen Years to be granted upon certain conditions.
13. If a Licensee shall have stocked his Run to an extent of at
least twenty-five sheep or five head of cattle or horses for each square mile
comprised within the boundaries of his Run, he shall be at liberty, within
any period not less than three months before the expiration of his license,
to apply, through the local Commissioner of Crown Lands, for a lease, for
fourteen years, of the lands held by him under a License ; and such Lease
shall be granted, for the said period of fourteen years, upon the certificate
of the local Commissioner that all the provisions of the Act have been
complied with by the applicant.


Declaration of Lessee, or his Manager, admissible by the Commissioner,
14. In cases where it may be necessary to prove that a Run has
been, and continues to be, stocked as required by the Act, it shall be
competent to the Commissioner to require and receive a declaration, in the
form D in the annexed schedule, signed by the Lessee or Manager of such
Run, and attested by a Justice of the Peace.
Commencement of Leases.
15. The term of all Leases to be issued in accordance with these
Regulations will be computed from the Ist of January or the Ist of July,
according as either of these dates may be nearest preceding to the date of
the application.
Rent chargeable, and method to be adopted for its determination.
16. The Rent chargeable for the first four years of the lease of a
Run will be at the rate of ten shillings per square mile, according to the
determined area of such Run. For the two succeeding periods of five
years each, being the residue of the total currency of the lease, the rent
to be reserved will be computed by an appraisement to be made at the
commencement of each period, as provided by sections 12 and 13 of the
Unoccupied Crown Lands Occupation Act of 1860.
Time for payment of Lease Rent ?and consequence of default.
17. The rent reserved in every lease must be paid in advance
into the Treasury at Brisbane. The rent for the first year must be paid
at the time of the delivery of the lease, or within ninety days from the
notification in the Gazette of such lease being ready for delivery, or the
lease will be forfeited. For each succeeding year the rent will be
payable on the day from which the term of the lease is computed. If
default be made in such payment, the lease will be liable to forfeiture )
but payment, within ninety days, of the full amount of rent and of an
additional sum, equal to twenty-five per cent, thereon, by way of penalty,
will defeat such forfeiture.
Lease not applied for, or forfeited, to be Sold by Auction,
18. The Lease of a Run, which may be vacated at the expiration
of a License, by reason of the Licensee having omitted to apply for, or
failed to obtain, such lease on his own behalf, or having failed to keep up
the required amount of stock, will be sold at public auction by the land
agent, at the land-office nearest such run.
Tbe upset price of Lease at Auction may, under circumstances, be reduced.
19. The upset price of a Forfeited Run, when submitted to
auction, shall be Ten Shillings annually for each square mile. Should
the lease remain unsold after being twice submitted to such auction, the
minimum upset rent of such lease may be reduced; and it shall from
time to time be offered to sale at such reduced rate of rent as may be so
determined.


What shall be considered the Grazing Capabilities of a Run.
20. Every Run, whether held by license or under lease, shall be
estimated as capable of carrying one hundred sheep or twenty head of
cattle for each square mile within its recorded boundaries. Should two
or more Runs, the recognised holding of one person, and containing on
the aggregate not more than one hundred square miles, be contiguous,
they will be dealt with, in respect to stocking, as one run ; and it will
be sufficient if the proportionate amount of stock for the whole be de-
pastured upon any part of either of them.
Measures to be adopted for the removal of Trespassers.
21. Trespassers upon Crown Lands will be proceeded against, as
the Act directs, by the lecal Commissioner, or other person duly autho-
rised in such behalf; and all such matters shall be adjudicated upon by
the nearest convenient Bench of Magistrates, whose decision will be carried
into effect by their Warrant, addressed to the Commissioner or other duly
authorised Agent of the Crown.
Penalty for Trespass.
22, Any person convicted, in manner before recited, of Trespass
upon Crown Lands, shall be liable to a fine of Five Pounds for the first
offence; Ten Pounds for the second; and any sum not exceeding Twenty
Pounds for a third and every subsequent offence. But no information
shall be laid against the same defendant for a subsequent trespass, until
the expiration of thirty days from the date of the previous conviction.
Power of resumption, or of reservation, by the Crown,
23. The Government reserves to itself the right to enter upon,
or to resume, for sale or other public purpose, the whole or any portion of
a Run. In cases of resumption, the lessee will be entitled to, and will
receive, twelve months? notice from the Government of such their intention
to resume, and a proportionate amount of rent paid or payable will be
remitted to him.
Compensation for Improvements.
24. The value of improvements erected on lands resumed, or
upon a Run, the lease of which shall lapse by effluxion of time, and which
shall not be renewed to the same lessee, will be allowed, provided that
the claim to such compensation be notified to the Chief Commissioner of
Crown Lands, through the local Commissioner, within two months after
the notice of resumption, or two months after the expiry of the lease.
Compensation will only be given on account of such permanent improve-
ments as may reasonably bo deemed necessary to the Pastoral occupation
of the run, or the development of its capabilities.

?
Colonial Secretary's Office,
Brisbane, 24/ A December, 1860.
WHEREAS the provisions of the Acts of the Legislature, 24 Yict. r
Nos. 11, 15, and 16, render it necessary that Regulations should
be made respecting the issue of licenses to cut timber on the lands
prised within the provisions of those Acts respectively : And whereas
the Regulations now in force respecting the issue of licenses to cut timber
on Crown Lands, other than those comprised in the above-mentioned
Acts, require amendment, His Excellency the Governor, with the advice
of the Executive Council, has been pleased to cancel all Regulations-
previously in force on that behalf, and to substitute the following, to take-
effect from and after the Ist January, 1861.
His Excellency's Command,
ROBERT Gl. W. HERBERT.

the Bench to whom they are addressed.
A Return of Applications to be made to Colonial Secretary.

different benches. These Returns will briefly state the grounds of
decision in each case where an application for a license has been refused.
Licenses personal.
5. Licenses are to be issued, in the form annexed (C) and will be
personal; they will not entitle any person but the actual holder to any
privilege whatever, neither will they be transferable.
Separate Licenses for each Person.
6. A separate license must be taken out by each person actually
employed in felling, cutting, sawing, splitting, or removing timber from
Crown Lands, as well dead timber, underwood, or roots cut for sale as
fuel, as growing timber cut for other purposes.
Lessees may cut Timber for certain purposes without license.
7. The preceding Regulation does not apply to the lessee or
licensed occupant of Crown Lands who is permitted to cut any timber
growing thereon for domestic uses, as firewood, fencing, &c., but not for
sale or barter.

8. Licenses will be of two kinds ?one empowering the holder to
cut any kind of timber, as well Cedar and Pine as Hardwood, the other
will be restricted to Hardwood alone.
Pees charged on licenses.
9. The fee chargeable on a Cedar and Pine license, which must
be paid to the Clerk of Petty Sessions previously to the issue of the
license, will be �4; and the fee for a Hardwood license �2, to be paid in
like manner.
Clerks of Benches to account.
10. The sums so paid to the Clerks of Benches are to be
accounted for and paid over in the same way as other public moneys
passing through their hands.
Operation of licenses.
11. Licenses will only be operative within the Police District for
which they were issued.
How available in another district.
12. Licenses granted for one District may be made available in
another, provided that the licensee shall obtain the written consent of
the Bench of such last-mentioned district, to be endorsed on the license,
and recorded in the same manner as an application for a fresh license.


Timber to be Removed.
13. All timber must be removed within twelve mentbs from the
time when cut, otherwise it will be liable to be seized, forfeited, and sold
on behalf of the Crown, notwithstanding that it was cut under the
authority of a license.
Licenses to be notified.
14. A. Return will be published in the Government Gazette from
time to time of all timber licenses issued.
Duration of Licenses.
15. Licenses will be in force during the current year ending the
31st December, or for the current six months ending 30th June or 31st
December in each year, but licenses for the current six months will be
charged only half the regulated fee.
Licences to extend to lands under lease in certain cases.
16. Licenses will extend not only to vacant Crown lands, but also
to lands under pastoral lease, subject to the following restrictions :
No timber to be cut within two miles of a head station.
17. No timber shall be cut within two miles of any head station,
except with the special consent of the lessee or superintendent of the run.
Lessees of runs may prohibit the cutting of Timber on their runs in
certain cases for the period of one month.
18. The lessee or licensed occupant of a run, or his superintendent,
may give notice in writing to any person holding a license prohibiting
him from cutting timber on any particular part of his run, to be specified
in such notice, for a period not exceeding one month.
Persons holding timber licenses may enter protest against such re-
strictions.
19. The holder of the license may apply, within one month from
the date of such notice of prohibition, to the Commissioner or nearest
Bench of Magistrates respectively, who are empowered to confirm or dis-
allow such prohibition as he or they may see fit, and if after such notice
of prohibition, and before the disallowance thereof, or after its confirma-
tion by the Commissioner or Bench, the holder of the license shall
continue to cut timber within the limits specified in such notice, he shall
be liable to such penalty not exceeding �2O, as the Commissioner or
Bench may see fit to impose.
Lessees may apply for a restriction of all licenses from particular por-
tions of their Runs.
20. The lessee of a run may notify in writing to the Commissioner


or the Bench any reasonable objection to any such timber license being
granted, and the Commissioner or the Bench shall furnish and report upon
any such objection to the Government, who shall decide upon it.
Timber Licenses not to extend to town sites and other reserves, &c., except
in special cases.
21. Timber licenses will not extend to Town or other Keserves, or
to lands measured for sale, except under a special authority in each
case.
License to be exhibited when demanded.
22. Every person holding a license to cut timber is required to
exhibit such license, whenever he is called upon to do so, to any officer of
the Government authorised in that behalf, as well as to the occupiers of
the run upon which he is cutting timber, or to the agent of such occupier.
Any person refusing to produce his license when called upon to do so, in
pursuance of this regulation, will be considered as unlicensed, and will be
prosecuted accordingly.
Penalties for breach of Regulations, &c.,
23. Any holder of a timber license, who shall cut or remove any
timber from any land excepted from the operation of his license, or any
person who shall cut or remove any timber, except firewood not for sale ,
from Crown Lands or lands under pastoral lease or otherwise, without due
authority, shall be liable to the penalties prescribed in the 29th section of
the Act.
Proof required.
24. In order to prevent any misapprehension, parties are warned that
it is not essential to a conviction under the Act that the offender should
be detected in the act of cutting or removing timber, but that the offence
may be established by evidence of facts from which its commission by the
party charged may be reasonably concluded.
Timber cut without license may be seized.
25. The Commissioner of Crown Lands or * other officer duly
appointed to act in that behalf, will seize all timber cut by unlicensed
persons, and all cut timber lying on Crown Lands which he may have
cause to believe has not been cut by a person duly authorised to cut the
same ; but in case a right to such timber shall be asserted within fourteen
days after the notice to be presently mentioned, and shall be established
to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, or officers seizing the same, it
shall be restored to the claimant.
Sale thereof after due Notice.
26. All such timber when seized will be marked with the broad
arrow, and after due notice of the seizure thereof, by a writing to be


posted up at the principal place of Petty Session in the district, shall, in
case no claimant shall appear and establish his claim within fourteen days
therefrom, be there sold, such timber having been previously removed
thither, or sold for delivery on the spot, as may be most expedient, and
subject to such condition of removal as may be specified at the time of
such sale.
Proceeds of Sales, &c.
27. The proceeds of the sale of timber so seized arc to be accounted
for and paid over like other public moneys.
In certain cases Timber will be reserved from license.
28. If it shall appear that the future sale of any Crown Lands will
be injuriously affected by the removal of the timber therefrom, or if it
shall appear desirable to preserve timber of any kind in any particular
district, the Government will, by a notification in the Gazette, prohibit the
cutting and removal of timber in such localities.
Licenses to dig and remove stone, gravel, &c., restricted to particular localities.
29. Licenses to dig and remove stone, gravel, brick-earth, or other
similar material, will be issued, in the form annexed (D), in the same
manner as timber licenses, but will be restricted to the particular locality
? *
