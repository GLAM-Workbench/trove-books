THE .
facing Career 0/ Con) Tjales
With hands like silk, and nerve of steel,
We see him crouching in the straight,
He hears above the thund?ring feet ?
The deaf?ning cry? *? The fav?rite?s beat!?
And still he seems to wait.
But like a flash, the scene is changed
His horse appears to gather strength,
And then our hero starts to ride
And fairly lifts him in his stride?
He?s won by half a length,
?M. P. BAL'LD,
THERE?S an old saying that an Irishman is never at peace un-
less he is quarrelling, a Scotchman never at home unless he
is abroad, and an Englishman never at rest unless he is
working. Whatever tr-uth there may be in that paradoxi-
cal definition of the traits of the several inhabitants of the
British Isles, there can be no gainsaying the fact of the Anglo-
Saxon possessing a love for the horse and the sport of racing which
he has inherited from his early ancestors. That this inherent love


for the noble steed is possessed by Australians admits of no doubt.
What wonder then, that Tom Hales, being a colonial, should have
shown an admiration for the horse ?
Thomas Hales, who is the second eldest of a family of ten,
seven sons and three daughters, first saw the light at Portland,
Victoria, in 1847, and is a descendant of an old Gloucester county
family. When quite a little lad his parents moved over the border
to Penola, in South Australia, and while residing there Tgm first
met the late lamented Adam Lindsay Gordon, who' subsequently
attained undying fame both as a bold and fearless cross-country
rider and a poet. Gordon at this time was a trooper in the service
of the South Australian police, and under the sobriquet of." Long
Gordon? was widely known. Apropos of Gordon, Hales ?tells a
story of how he first made the acquaintance of the ijran who was
destined to become famous afterwards. Our youthful herb and a
couple of companions, about his own age, had one day ? played the
wag ? from school, and, in a spirit of boyish mischief, a signboard
at the local pound attracted their attention and became the target
to decide their merits at stone-throwing. Needless to say the board
suffered materially. For this indiscreet bit of sport the trio ran
foul of the police, of whom Gordon was one, and the lads were
marched off to the lock-up, but after about an hour?s incarceration
and a severe lecture on the dangers of throwing stones they were
set at liberty. The kindly remonstrance of Gordon had its effect on
Hales, and from that day until the untimely end of the dashing
rider a close friendship existed between the pair.
After some years? residence at Penola, the Hales family removed
to Robe, a seaport in the south east of South Australi?a, and?bere it
was that Tom, a youngster of 13 years or so, won Ijis first race.
He rode a chestnut horse called Euclid in a match for,
against another rejoicing in the appellation of Tommy, trained and
ridden by Johnny Pounding, a clever Adelaide trainer in those
days. The subject of this sketch, whose bodily weight would
hardly bring the beam down at qst, scored an easy win, and so
elated was he at his initial success that he slept in his boots and
breeches that night. His father entirely disapproved of his son?s
feat, and predicted that he would ultimately go to the dogs if he
persisted in riding races. But the spirit was too stronglyTrhb'uecl in,
the lad, and he went entirely in opposition to the old man?s advice


and wish. He won a number of races in the Mount Gambier dis-
trict shortly afterwards, the principal consisting of three hurdle
races and a steeplechase on Tatiara, a son of Leap Year.
Tom subsequently went to live at Mr. Edward Stockdale?s Lake
Hawden Here he rode and handled all Sorts of a very
large number of horses. He? says: ??While I was here Mr.
Gordon came to the station and broke-in a lot of horses, and it was
during my stay there that I really learned to ride. Mr. Stockdale
used to send large drafts to Adelaide for sale and it was arriving
with one of these lots that I took up the idea of trying life in the
City of Churches.?
Here it was that Hales broke in the famous Fisherman horse?
Smuggler, for Mr. C. B. Fisher, the late respected chairman of the
Victorian Racing Club, and he also rode the gallant brown and won
his first metropolitan race on the Thebarton course. From this out
Tom rode innumerable winners in South Australia, but, unfortun-
ately, no authentic record of them exists.
In the Spring of 1872 Tom Hales accompanied the string of the
late Mr. T. J. Ryart, in charge of poor Harry Tothill, to Victoria,
and from this date his remarkable career may be said to have com-
menced in earnest, and this is the period from which his record in
the following pages is compiled.
Hales? first mount in this State was on the ill-fated Benvolio, by
Peter Wikins-Juliet, in the Maribyrnong Plate won by Dagmar.
He met with no success whatever at this meeting, although he very
nearly reached the summit of every jockey?s ambition ?to win the
Melbourne Cup?at his first attempt on that good horse The Ace,
who was just beaten by The Quick after a rattling finish. Unfor-
tunately, the son of Ace of Clubs suffered a compulsory stoppage in
his work at a critical time in his preparation for the great handi-
cap. A sore had formed on the horse?s back and the head being
knocked off by . the saddle the dye from a maroon quarter-sheet
entered the wound, poisoning it ; this caused an abnormal swelling
of the part, and riding him was out of the question. But for this
contretemps The Ace would, no doubt, have very easily won that
Melbourne Cup.
Journeying to Dowling Forest, he steered The Ace to victory in
the Ballarat Handicap, and in the Autumn he followed up by win


ning several races at Flemington and Randwick on the son of Ace
of Clubs, and also on Kingfisher. The following season his efforts
were attended with better results, and he went on year after year
increasing his number of wins. After Mr. Ryan relinguished racing
and went to Europe, Hales joined the late Mr. W. Wijich, then
owner of Pytchley Lodge, Flemington, but now in the occupation
of Mr. S. G. Cook, and in the ? violet, white sleeves and cap? ofhis
new master he secured first notice from the judge many times on
Newbold, the sire of Ben Bolt, Megaphone, &c.
We next find him playing a winning hand with Ace of Trumps in
the Adelaide Cup, and then in Eli Jellett's ? black and white spots?
he had a rare sequence of successes on the back of that sterling
little fellow Richmond, The beautiful Lurline, too, accounted for
Australian Cup of 1875 in his hands, and after this Hales became
" first call ? for the powerful St. Albans' stable, then presided over
by Mr. James Wilson, sen., and what a series of triumphs fell to his
lot during the four years this engagement existed ? The names of
First King, Briseis, Savanaka, Petrea, Progress, Pardon, Royal
Maid, &c., recall many of the good things of the past, all of which
will be found enumerated in the comprehensive winning list.
The Hon. W. A. Long was the next owner to benefit from the
services of our hero, and with Grand Flaneur who retired from the
turf with an unbeaten certificate, he won every, race for which he
started, with the exception of his maiden victory in the V.K.C.
Normanby Stakes, when W. Yeomans had the mount, Trump
Yoss, Geraldine, The Wandering Jew, Gipsy Cooper, Hildebrant,
&c., were also steered to victory by Hales.
The dreaded ??all black" of Terara was next entrusted to Tom s
care, and with Navigator, Solitude, Gudarz, Guinea, &c., he
credited Mr. De Mestre with a long list of important successes.
In 1883 Hales became leading jockey for the most renowned stable
Australia has ever boasted, that of the late Hon. James White, of
Kirkham, N.S.W., and for a period of six years he sported the
pretty blue and white jacket with an uninterrupted series of
triumphs. Every classic race of note, and almost every handicap
of consequence, both in Victoria and New South Wales, were
credited to the stable through the agency of Hales. It was during
this engagement that the crack horseman accomplished his best


riding record. This eventuated at the V.R.C. Autumn Meeting in
1888 when he piloted ii winners out of 14 mounts. Four of these
were ridden in succession on the opening day of that memorable
gathering, viz.: Carlyon in theEssendon Stakes, Volley in the Ascot
Vale Stakes, Abercorn in the St. Leger, and Cranbrook in the New-
market Handicap.
Shortly after the death of Mr. White, Hales took a fourth Interest
in a syndicate that was formed in 1890 to purchase eleven Kirkham
bred yearlings at 500 guineas each. These were raced in the nom de
course of ? Mr. J. B. Clarke.? but nothing like the unparalleled suc-
cess achieved by Mr. White's horses fell to the lot of the con-
federacy. It was shortly after entering into this speculation that
the late Mr. W. R. Wilson made Hales a very handsome offer to be-
come first jockey to St. Albans, but in view of his position he was
reluctantly compelled to deline what would in all probability have
turned out as remunerative and successful an engagement as ever he
had entered into.
In addition to the owners already mentioned, Hales has at one
time or other donned the colors of almost every leading sportsman
throughout Australia, one prominent exception being the Messrs.
Miller, whose racing jacket he never wore.
During the three and twenty years of active service, Hales has
won almost every notable event throughout Australia and Tas-
mania?classic or otherwise. Briefly, he has won a Maribyrnong
Plate and a Melbourne Cup, the V.R.C. Derby seven times, the
Oaks five times, and the St. Leger on no fewer than ten occasions.
Eight Australian Cups, two Newmarket Handicaps, seven Champion
races and the Ascot Vale Stakes five times are some of his
Flemington achievements. At Randwick the A.J.C. Derby has
fallen to him half-a-dozen times, the Oaks four times, St. Leger
seven times, and the Champagne Stakes five times. He also ac-
counted for three Sydney Cups in succession, and the Metropolitan
Stakes once. The V.A.T.C. Great Foal Stakes he has won twice,
and thrice has he captured the Caulfield Guineas, but singularly
enough, the Caulfield Cup is the only race of significance that he
has never seen the right end of. Six Geelong Cups he is responsible
for winning, while the Adelaide Cup (twice), Launceston, Hobart,
A.J.C. Summer, Ballarat Sandhurst, Sydney Tattersalls', and Albury


Cups have also been credited to him, and other important races in-
clude Hawkesbury and Goodwood Handicaps, and A J.C. Carring-
ton Stakes.
Hales has not escaped immunity from the dangers so inseparable
from racing, for he has encountered four severe falls. The worst he
sustained was whilst riding Adelaide in the A J C. City Handicap
in 1877. The field was a large one, and at the moment his filly was
going great guns in third position while the home turn was being
rounded, when suddenly he was driven on to the rail. One of his
boots was turn to shreds, his instep crushed and a knee injured. So
badly was he knocked about that he was laid up tor eight weeks,
He received another spill whilst riding Despot, who had a penchant
for coming down, and on another occasion he had the misfortune
to fall over Martini-Henri whilst riding his stable companion, Mor-
peth, in the Sydney Cup. Teddy Power, who had the mount on the
former, was, like Hales, badly hurt and Morpeth was killed. It is
a curious coincidence that these falls occurred at Randwick. He
also encountered a bad fall whilst riding Fisherman in the Sandhurst
-Cup,of 1877, owing to the saddle-girth breaking. To add to the in-
jury on that occasion his trousers were stolen from the dressing
room and he was compelled to return from the course into Bendigo
in his riding pants. Here a pair of unmentionables, the property of
a burly owner, were improvised for the nonce, but as Tom
remarked, ? they would have made a suit for me.? Whilst riding
The Plunger a private gallop in Adelaide, Tom also received a severe
fall in consequence ot his horse putting his foot into a hole.
The career of Tom Hales in the saddle has altogether been a
phenomenal one in the annals of the Australian turf, and justly
earned for him the title of the ? Archer of the Antipodes.? From
its outset he has ? made his own running and retained the lead to
finish.? The success attained has been thoroughly deserved, and
no better tribute could be paid him than in recalling the fact that he
has never once incurred the displeasure of the ? powers that be.?
He was ever scrupulously fair in riding, but not so some of his
rivals. Once a well-known and fashionable dealt ?
with him during a race to such purpose as to utterly extinguish his
chance of winning, and, although reluctant to protest, he felt it his
dutyx to do so. The owner, however, was averse to a complaint
being lodged and the matter was therefore allowed to pass. Some


little time afterwards the same jockey repeated the offence, but as
no sign of an objection was made, and being a palpable case the
same owner asked Hales if he was not going to protest? "No!?'
promptly replied Tom, "Had you allowed me to do so when I
wished this would not have happened.??
Among the many brilliant finishes that Hales has participated in,
that for the V R.C. Derby of 1888 may be cited as a masterpiece of
jockeyship, for he fairly snatched the race out of the fire from the
itriighty Carbine on Ensign. Another instance of his marked ability
as a horseman was demonstrated at Flemington in the Autumn of
the same year, Tom was riding Ambition in the Special Juvenile
Stakes, and at the distance the favorite Epicurean had him beaten,
the latter?s rider thinking (and rightly too) that he had a bit up his
sleeve, kept alongside, ? kidding,? Hales took in the situation atone
glance and quickly nursing his horse for a final dash, waited until a
few strides from home when he sat down in resolute style and with
one supreme effort landed his mount a clever winner by a neck,
much to the chagrin of his opponent.
Hales practically relinquished riding in 1892, but, during the in-
terim prior to his final retirement from the pigskin, he occasionally
had the ? leg up ?? on his own horses He owned some fairly useful
horses in his time. Paul, by Maribyrnong-Lady, was the first
animal he became possessed of, he being a present from his former
master, Mr. E. De Mestre. He next purchased Alphabet, a full
brother to Creswick. from the squire of Kirkham, then followed All
Gold, Hogmanay, Beeswing, her half brother, Odd Stockings, New
Fashion, Morok, Fire King (hurdler), Carlton, Carlina, Carlsruhe,
Lady Love, Liljydale, Cornelius, Historian, and Caralbi. With
most of these he won a number of races, the most important of
which was the Newmarket Handicap with Carlton in 1897. This
race should have proved far more profitable to him than it turned
out. A lady, who had drawn Carlton in Tattersalls? sweep, wired
Hales half the amount of the first prize in the event of the gelding
winning, but the chestnut performed so badly in a private gallop
with Acton a few days prior to the race, that it not only presented
his owner from supporting him to win a good stake, but he deemed
it simply useless to reply to the telegram and the result was that he
lost �2,300 in consequence, and all the money he had about the


winner was to �4O, taken in the paddock shortly before the
start.
Hale's? long and honorable career could not afford a better ex-
ample for the rising generation of jockeys. He was an indefatigable
worker too, and although for many years he suffered acutely from
asthma, he was always present to ride early morning work, no
matter how unpropit uous the meteorological elements. Many a
time when the atmosphere was raw and bitterly cold, with perhaps
drizzling rain as an accompaniment he would have given fifty
pounds for the privilege of remaining at home, yet he never failed to
do his duty, a, lasting proof of his devotion to his profession.
Hales is reaping the reward of many years hard work by enjoying
his otium in his charming residence at Moonee Ponds, ? Acmeville,?
so dedicated in honor of Acme, one of the best fillies he ever
bestrode.
Tn private life Tom Hales is as highly esteemed as he was while
following his vocation Always a modest man and not given to
ostentatious display, he is withal a fluent conversationalist and it is
distinctly entertaining to listen to his narration of some of the
stirring incidents of his life.
In 1883 pastoral pursuits engaged the attention of Hales, and in
conjunction with ?Billy? Yeomans, these celebrated ? knights of
the pigskin ? acquired Milbey station on the Lachlan river, situate
about 12 miles from Condobolin and 750 from Wagga Wagga. This
property comprised 40,000 acres and carried something like 20,000
sheep. Squatting, however, did not prove congenial to the tastes
of Hales, and in 1888 he severed the connection with his partner,
who experienced a very hard stroke of misfortune on the day of dis-
solution, for the ravages of a severe bush fire destroyed 1000 sheep
together with a large quantity of fencing, grass, &c.
As a breeder, Tom Hales did not attain anything like the success
commensurate with his enterprise. He purchased ? Haleswood,?
a charming valley property of 600 acres near Tallangatta. and
through which coursed the river Mitta Mitta. The selection of a
stallion was one of the first matters to determine, and his choice
fell on the Prince Charlie horse, Lochiel, then eight years old, and
who was destined to later on achieve such conspicuous distinction
as a s ire. After giving a long figure-for the celebrated black, Hales


shortly afterwards learnt, from what appeared to be a most reliable
authority, that the horse was affected with a certain disease, and
without loss of time he disposed of him for considerably less than
the purchase money. As events subsequently proved this turned
out to be one of the most unfortunate incidents that ever befel the
embryo stud master. As lord of the harem, Newmaster, by New-
minister?Primrose, and therelore own brother to the two New-
market Handicap winners, Churchill and Wild Rose, was then
selected, and with such aristocratically-bred dames as Albina, Cor-
vette, Litigant, Skiff, Double Acrostic, Liliydale, May Queen, Lady
Love, Mollusca, Bright Heart, Cornelian, &c., a bright future was
predicted for the stud. Newmaster, however, failed to justify
anticipations in his new sphere of life, which after a few seasons
terminated, his death being caused through snake-bite. The
Officer, by Robinson Crusoe, was used for a season, but in March,
1899, Hales being disgusted with the prices realised for the yearlings,
the breeding establishment was disbanded, and the choice lot of
brood mares distributed over some of the studs in this and the
neighbouring states.
As previously stated no authentic records were kept of Hales? ex'
ploits in the saddle in the early days of his career, and, as will be
observed from the tables in the following pages, his deeds are com-
piled from the season of 1872-1873, when he may be said to have
fairly embarked in his profession, and from which date he became
so well and deservedly known to the racing world. Out of a total
of 1678 mounts he won 496 races?a splendid average?and for his
numerous employers he won no less a sum than/168,340 10s., irre-
spective of second and third place money. This is truly a
magnificent result, and bids fair to remain unequalled for many
years to come in the annals of the Australian turf.
