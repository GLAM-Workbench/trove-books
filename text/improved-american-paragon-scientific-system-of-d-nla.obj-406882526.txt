There are three Instruments and Book of Instructions which comprise this system—viz.,
The Scale, Arm Piece, Sleeve Chart and Instruction Book. The scale is the largest piece of
cardboard, and has two measures and three points. Long measure is side of scale extending
from 1 to 24 inches ; (2) short measure, side of scale extending from 1 to 13 inches ;
(3) extreme point at which the 24th inch is found ; (4) curved point, at top of Scale ;
(5) double point, at which the inches start, run from 1, running in opposite directions. A
measure will be found on the Scale, which must be practised and thoroughly understood
before other measures are taken.
For Drafting the Back.
1. Place the Scale even with the edge of the paper, and make a dot in holes marked 1,2, 3 ;
then push scale from you, and draw a straight line so that it will pass over dots just
made the full length of the scale.
2. Turn Scale round and draw line 2 square with line 1 (as in cut) ; before moving Scale
make a dot on line 1 just £-inch down from line 2, and another dot on same line 3|
inches from line 2.
3 and 4. Move Scale down and draw lines 3 and 4 (as in cut) square with line 1, from dots
just made ; turn Scale round, and place actual length of back on line 3, at the same
time having the Scale straight with line 1, and make a dot at the double point |-inch
inside of line 1.
5. Now see “Dart Calculator” for line 5; make a dot inside of dot already made for
length of line 5, as given by the Dart Calculator ; then make a dot 3 inches further
out, and allow the space of 3 inches to come between the middle back and side form,
making the latter about 1 inch the larger of the two ; then draw line 5 (as in cut) to
dots just made ; before moving Scale make a dot above line 5 on line 1, the distance
of the “ Under Arm” length measure.
6. Turn Scale round and draw line 6 (as in cut) from last dot ; before moving Scale make a
dot at Back Bust Measure ; then make another dot 3 inches further out.
7. Place the point of Arm Piece which is marked by a star, place the star at junction of lines
1 and 3 and the number of the neck measure of the back neck, just touching line 2 ;
then draw the curve (as in cut).
8. Place double point of Scale at junction of line 7 and 2, figure 7 just touching line 4 ;
then draw the line jpinch longer than actual shoulder length.
9. Draw line 9 from outside dot on line 6 to outside dot on line 5.


10. Two-thirds of line 10 is first drawn with curve on arm piece from point of shoulder
towards first bust dot ; then place double point of scale on square with line'l, just
touching line 10, and make a dot 3 inches further out; then continue line 10 with
curve from said dot to junctions of lines G and 9.
11. The two linos 11 are drawn with arm piece from sections of line 10 to line o.
12 and 13. Make a dot down on line 1 twice the distance from line 5 of the length of line
5 ; pull the Scale outside of line 1 and make a dot at corner ; make another dot
inside of last dot half the distance you came down from line 5 less k-ineh, and another
.dot inside the whole distance you came down from line 5 less another dot 3
inches beyond ; then draw line 12 from k-ineh dot at waist to corner of line G and J
and line 13 from i-inch dot at waist to outside dot below.
14, Draw lines 14 and 15 from line 5 te dots made below (as in cut),.
For Drafting the Front-
1,2, 3. Draft lines 1 and 2 same as in Back Drafting ; before moving Scale make a dot
down on line 1 inches from line 2 ; draw line 3lfrom said dot square with line 1
(as in cat)..
4. Before moving Scale make a dot down on line 1 half the distance of the arm size,
measure from line 3, then draw line 4 from last dot ; before moving Scale make
another dot down on line 1 just the distance from the under arm length measure from
line 4 ; place the length of back bust line on junction of lines 1 and 4, and make
a dot at the remainder of the half bust measure, then another dot 3 inches inside
last dot.
5. Move scale dow and drawn line 5 from dot made on line 1 for under arm length measure,,
square with line 1.
'6. Turn Scale round and draw line 6 square down from line 2, so as it will pass over
outside dot on line 4.
7. Place the star on arm piece at junction of lines 1 and 2, make a dot down on line 1 f(j
the distance required for front neck measure, place star of arm piece on dot just made
and the number of the front neck measure just touching line 2, then draw line 7 (as
in cut).
?8.. Place double point of Seale at junction of lines 1 and 2, figure 7, just touching line 3 ;
then draw dine 8 to actual shoulder length.
;9. Before drawing line 9 get the length of line 7 in Back Drafting and dednet it from front
length measure, and make a dot down on line 1 the remaining distance from the
upper end of line 7 in Front Drafting ; now place the double point of Scale on said
dot with long measure, just crossing 5 and 6 at junction ; make a dot If inches
inside of line 1 for the space to Ist Dart (refer to Dart Calculator for size of darts) ;
then make another dot inside of last for size of dart, and dot again 1 inch further for
space between darts, and another dot for 2nd Dart same size as Ist: measure space
between last Dart on line 6 and deduct 3 inches, then make a dot on line 5 half the
remaining distance from the outside of 2nd Dart, and another dot on same line 3
inches further out towards line 6 ■; then draw the two lines 9 parallel with line 6, so
that it will cross said dots, leaving the space of 3 inches to come between the Front
and Under Arm Form.
Notice.—The number of inches which the bust dot has been thrown out and
the space between two lines 9 must always be the same ; this space is allowed for
spring on hip. If for a very large figure more space may be allowed, though only
in back, as 3 inches is always sufficient for any figure in front. The term “ Dart”
refers to what is commonly called breast pleats.
HO. Make a dot 1 inch up from line 4 and | of an inch inside of point of shoulder, then
draw line 10 with curve on Scale from point of shoulder to said dot, make another
dot £ of an inch below line 4 on lines 9 and continue curve to said dot, get length of
line 9 in Back Drafting and measure same distance up on line 6 from the waist and
make a dot, then finish line 10 from last dot to £-inch dot below line 4 on line 9 (as
•u cut).

3,1 anl 12. -Place short arm measure of Scale straight with line 1, long measure ju'st touching'
line 10, and make a dot at figure 2 and one at figure 4 on line 1 ; draw line II from
'2-inch (Jot straight to line 9 and line 12 from 4-inch dot to corner of lines 11 and 9.
18. Move Scale down, draw line 13 from dot made near line 5 to corner of lines 5 and 9.
14, 16, 1(5, 17. Make a cross in centre of each large dart and a dot each side of lines
9, then draw linos 14, 16, 1(5, 17 from said dots (as in cut).
18 and 19. With curve point of Scale draw lines 18 and 19 and 20 and 21, as in cut ;
before drawing lines 22 and 23 make a dot G inches below waist line on line 9 and
f of an inch each side.
22 and 23, Draw lines 22 and 23 from: 3-inch dots on line 5> to dots made below ; these
lines are drawn witli 40 curve, so that they will cross lines 9 just below line 6.
24. Make a dot 3 inches down on line 6 from line 5 and a dot 1£ inches out from line (5
draw line 24 with curve point so it will cross last dot made.
25, 2(1, 27, 28- Are drawn so that they will meet about 10 or 12 inches below waist line.
For Drafting Cloaks,
Draft back same as for a dress, with few exceptions—first, to give- the looseness' by
making a dot | inch outside of line 15 on line 5, and drawing a line from said dot to lines 10'
and 9 ; draw line 15 from |-inch dot on line sso it will cross the first line 15 about 11 or
12 inches below waist. Front.—Draft front |of an inch larger, and make a dot |-inch
out from line G on line 5 ; then draw a line from said dot to lines 10 and 6, and if one dart
instead of two is preferred put the two ordinary Darts into one and deduct from the amount
which add to V dart ; the large dare is put into the centre of the space between
1 and 9,
Directions for Cutting a Princess Dress.
First, trace out your lining for the waist. Second, tack the front piece of your lining
on the g>mds. dhird, measure fr< ni the waist down the front (lie length of your skirt
measure, Fourth, square a line across the bottom of the goods. Fifth, measure down the
opposite side, and then tack the under arm go.e lining on your go; ds and measure down
side next to front the length you made long s'de of front pie'ofe ; then square a line
across bo ; tom same as in front. Seventh, measure down opposite side to the square line
from waist. Eighth, commence on s : de form next to back ; lack'your lining <n gc ods and
measure down short s.de the same length you made long side of last piece, and squaie your
line same as before. Ninth, if cutting a common house dress, add about two inches to long
side ©- ill's piece. Tenth,cut the back the same way. EleV- nth, see tks inst.net ons showing'
the width of each piece at bottom of dress.

then cut the sjrace ( ut 1-elween them ; in sewing them together always let the seam run-
down at least 9 inches below* the waist. The lack may be cut the same way.
Per Cutting Sto.t and Trained Skirts,

How to Carry Down and Cut the Skirt of a Dress or Pattern,
First trace out the full pattern as far as your drafting runs down. Second, piece the
front of your pattern and run line 1 down to the actual length of skirt measure ; then run
dowm opposite line the same distance. Trim your pattern up all round, and commence on
the under arm gore. If you w T ant the train to be 9 inches long, make the front side of
under arm gore the same length as you have front, and opposite side 1 inch longer ; run
down short side of next piece the same as long side of under arm gore, and opposite side 5
inches longer ; run down short side of back same as long side of last piece, and make
opposite side 8 inches longer. Any other length of train is made the same way.
For Cutting Trained Skirts.
Follow instructions as above, separating hip dart same as second dart in short skirt
(being necessary to have two side gores). Make width at bottom a continuation of slope of
darts, except the front width, which is the usual width. Always allow about two-thirds of
the extra length (after the 1 inch on first gore) on long side of second gore, remaining one-
third to be put in centre of back.
For Tracing Gabrielle.
First, for front piece trace line 11, or waist line, to lines 13 and 17. Second, line 1 the
full length. Third, line 7to line 8. Fourth, line Bto line 12. Fifth, lines 12, 13 and 17.
Piece next to front first waist line from junctions of lines 14 and 15 to lines 6 and 18,
or lines outside of lines 6 and 18. Second, lines 8, 12, 14 and 16. Third, lines to 10, 0
and 18. Fourth, always be careful if lines ar# drawn outside of lines 6 and 18 to trace them
in place of lines 6 and 18. Always notice that the front of this dress should be cut on the
fold of the goods. Trace the back same as for adults.
To Out a Gabrielle Wrapper.
If this dress is tight fitting make the drafting same as for the Princess dress with few
exceptions. First, draw the Gabrielle in place of the front dart. You should always deduct
about inch From the back dart, and add the same to your Gabrielle dart. Second, draw
the Gabrielle dart same as for children, and separate the same as for children in centre of
shoulder and centre of dart, leaving 1 inch space, and between front and under arm form
leaving 3 inches space. Hence, making a second bust dot 4 inches further out, over which
line 6 must be drawn.

If this dress is loose fitting leave out the back dart and add the looseness same as
for the Cloak.


Instructions How to Test your Drafting.
Take thpe line and first take off amount of line sin Back Drafting. If the measure
you have after measuring these spaces will make just half of the regular waist measure your
drafting is correct. Draw a straight line G inches below waist and measure spaces the same
way for size of hips.
How to Trace and Cut Back and Front.
Always draft Back first and trace and cut front first. First pin your drafting to your
lining, and commence by tracing line 13 (or waist line) ; lines 16, 10, 8,7, 1, 14, 15, 18, 19,
20, 21, 22, 25, 26, 27, 28. Under Arm Form.—Line 5 (or waist line), 17, 23, 6 and 24 ;
line 10, 6 to 9 ; side back line 5 (or waist line), 11, 9, ID, 14, 15 ; now cut this out.
Middle Back. —Lines 5, 11, 12 to neck, 8, 7,10,13, 14 ; now cut this out. Allow turnings
everywhere but on the neck and arm hole. Never let line Bin Front Drafting cross line 3 ;
line 8 in Back should not cross line 4 unless the shoulder is over 7 inches, in which case the
over the actual 'shoulder length is put on the line, and in front drawn to just the
measure of the shoulder.
How to Take Measures.
1. Tie a cord round the waist. 2. Take measure of “ neck” tight. 3. Arm Size :
This measure is taken around the arm about 1 inch below the point of sqoulder, and taken
very tight. 4. “ Bust” : Bring tape line around the body, allowing two fingers to pass over
full part of bust. 5. “ Waist” : Tight. 6. Front length from the prominent bone in back
over shoulder to cord in front at waist. 7. Back length from same bone in back to cord at
waist. 8. “ Back Bust” : From just under the arm from right to left. 9. Under arm
length : Prom hollow under the arm to cord at waist. 10. “ Shoulder” : From neck to point
of shoulder. Always take this measure the full length of shoulder, and if a shorter shoulder
is required slope the arm hole the height required. 11. Hip : Measure round hip about 6
inches below waist, and test your draftings before cutting. 12. Sleeve : First take length of
sleeve from point of sho'ulder to wrist, with hand resting on breast ; secondly, measure width
of sleeve round largest part of arm loose ; thirdly, measure size of wrist ; if required tight
take measure from point of shoulder to point of elbow.
For Drafting Sleeve.
Line 4 : Make a dot at top and bottom in holes corresponding with length of sleeve,
and draw a line with inside curve of sleeve chart ; draw straight line across wrist 2 inches
more than half wrist measure ; make a dot for width of top 3 inches more than half width
measure ; place the number of sleeve length on dot made on wrist line, and draw outside
curve to corresponding dot at top, passing over dot made for width measure ; upper curve to
be drawn with upper sleeve chart, the under part of sleeve to be 2 inches less than half the
width measure ; under slope to be drawn with space cut out on sleeve chart ; if fullness is
required at top of sleeve make a dot 2 inches Beyond upper curve ; measure size of wrist ;
measure also top of sleeve and compare it with size of arm hole, if too small slope the
underpart.
For Cutting Children’s Dresses.
Draft the back same as for adults, with few exceptions ; the first is that dot made on
line 6 for spring in back is £-inch instead of ; draw line 8 in Back Drafting for
children only longer than shoulder measure instead of i-inch. 2, Lines 12,13 and 14
are drawn by your eye ; they need but little spring. 3. See the perforated dots showing the
lap in the back, and also showing that you must allow for the hem in the back, the notches
running to the waist showing the dress should be clipped to make it set well ; the notches
above show the same. 4. Draft the front down to line 10 same as for adults, omitting lines
11 and 12 and drawing 11 in place of line 13. 5. See Children’s Dart Calculator, and got
the amount for Gabrielle Dart. 6. If for a medium size child make a dot 1| inches from
line lon line 11, or waist line. 7. Make a dot on same line for size of dart. 8. If Dart
Calculator gives anyth'ng to be added to Front Drafting, make the dot without moving
Scale. 9. Make a dot in centre of line 8 and one in centre of dart. 10. Draw a line from
centre of line 8 to centre of dart. 11. Draw a line 13 from line 4 to outside of dart
(same as in cut). 12. Line 14 (same as in cut). 13. Line 15 square from waist down.
14. Line 16 square from waist down. 15. Line 17 so it will cross line 16 11 to 12 inches
below waist line. 16. Line 18 as you see it in the cut. 17. Lines outside of 18 and 6
take the places of 6 and 18 when the Dart Calculator gives anything to be added to Froi t
Drafting.


6’
Dart Calculator.
First amount under Jv. is width of back or length of line 5 in Back Drafting. Always
remember the inside of line 1 is not included in this calculation. Second p mount
under B. is bust measure ; D. is the size for each large dart in Front Drafting; Y. is 75-inch
(always the same) which must come out in the small dart in front. Make line 5 just as the
Calculator says. First find the bust and waist measures, and the remainder of the measure
will be in the opposite columns.

For Cutting Children’s Clothing, Princess Dresses, Polonaises, Train
and Walking Skirts, Gabrielle Wrappers and Loose-fitting Garments
for Ladies and Children, also a feuj valuable Hints
on Dressmaking.
EZEJVLA-EI&S.
After a dress is properly cut by our system, the next most important step is to properly
tack the pieces together. Often the fit of a well cut garment is entirely changed by careless
tacking. It is said by many good dressmakers that a garment well and properly tacked is
half made ; there is more truth in this than most ladies have ever thought of. To sew the
■darts—or breast plaits—commence at the top, holding both edges even for one inch ; begin
•the seam so fine and neat and with such small stitches that .there will be no appearance of a
fold—or plait—at the top .of the darts on the outside when made up. The edge toward the
lap should then be held a little full, then eased to the waist line. Then place the darts over
the knee, and stretch them until they become perfectly smooth. In sewing the back and side
body together the back should be held a little full over the shoulder-blades, and when
ladies have round shoulders it is well to increase the fullness a little ; this will give ease over
the shoulder-blades, and make the dress fit easily to the figure. In cutting out the back you
must allow for this at the waist, or the back will be just that much too short for the side
body. In tacking and sewing the shoulder seam the front must be stretched half an inch to
meet the back ; this is done to avoid any wrinkles, and causes the garment to fit into the
hollow of the shoulder. We would further advise that all the seams should be opened, the
edges neatly overhanded, and bone casings put on. This, as you cannot fail to see, gives the
seams a chance to spring to the waist, and must, being soft and pliable, be better than taping
the seams, which confines and will not allow the seams to give. The whalebones for darts
should be very thin and supple, and shaven at the top. While tacking the fore part of the
bodice a thread should be run around the arm size to prevent it from stretching while the
garment is being made, then cut the thread, after the dress is finished, to allow the sleeve
and arm size to give to the arm just enough to : add ease and beauty to the dress. A little
wadding may sometimes be added under the arm and back to the side body, and may extend a
little up in front of the arm. Ladies who are very thin very often require a little from the
shoulder seam to the bust. If wrinkles appear wilder the arm, too much curve has been
taken for the darts ; such figures require straighter darts, and in drafting for them it is best
to use the curve at 40 on the “ Waist Line ” of the scale.. The height oi the darts may be
.changed to suit the figure ; in order to do this, lines 11 and 12 in Front Drafting must be
either raised or lowered, and the darts carried up only to line 12, as in front diagram. The
space between the darts may also be made less or greater to suit the figure, which does not
■alter the fit of the garment. The arm size measure is most important in this system, as if
taken too large too much material will be found between the shoulder and under arm ;
remember that the size of this measure does not refer to the size of the Arm Hole. No
particular rule for sewing in the sleeve can be given which will apply to every figure more
than the highest part of the sleeve, at the top, should be put to the point of the shoulder ;
this allows the sleeve so hang properly. As so many styles of sleeves are worn, the seams of
which necessarily come in various places, there .can 'be no fixed rule as regards placing the
seams, but if .the sleeve hangs from the point of the shoulder straight it cannot fail to set
well, letting the seams come where they will, fn Children's Clothing the front shoulder is
stretched only quarter of an inch, instead of half, and is tacked in same way, commencing at
the top.
