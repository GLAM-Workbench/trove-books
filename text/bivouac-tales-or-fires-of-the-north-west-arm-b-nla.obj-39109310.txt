PREFACE
I
I
HAYING had some little experience of literary work, it
has occurred to me that I would like to write a few
things for my friends that will put in permanent form
ie results of many camp-fire talks during the years of
pioneering work at North West Arm.
I mention that this little work is more for my friends,
because I feel that I want a certain amount of indulgence
in what may be faults from a purely literary point «f
view, but which, it is hoped, will be more than balanced
by the sincerity of the views expressed. Indeed, I do
not want to worry my readers with my own views alto-
gether, as many of them, being my friends, will already
be aware of them. Rather will I repeat the gist of what
I have learned from others.

It is a noticeable thing that out here beside the burn-
ing-off fires or «round the old “Bivouac” log fire, men
do put aside all hindrances from an absolute communion
of mind and soul, and say exactly what they think. After
all, the surroundings lend themselves to this.
These talks take place at night, or at week-ends,
when the cares of the dav are over and the silence be-

neath the stars, broken only by the flickering of the fire
and the words of the next speaker, seems to impose upon
men the duty of either smcereiy speaking or saying
nothing.

travel and at the same time its quietness and freshness
have attracted for brief holidays, Artists, Theologians,
Medical Specialists, Teachers, Lawyers, and last, but not
least, your real Bushmen, in quite considerable numbers,
• for this is one of the last places so close to Sydney where
these may ply their axe to some advantage.
As for returned soldiers, it has since the war been a
veritable Mecca, particularly, lam pleased to say, be-
cause in the various ranks I held in the Army, I made
many friends, some of whom have returned and wish to
see me aagin, though many are resting at the other side.
I had forgotten in the list of my teachers—and they
all have been my teachers of what I am trying to pass on
to you—that we have had quite a fair sprinkling of re-
tired Police Officers. These men, after almost half a cen-
tury spent in various country districts, and retiring to
Sydney or the Suburbs to spend their declining days, be-
come pleasantly garrulous as the roaring log fire brings
back to them the scenes of their early service, but when
the subject would turn, as it so often does torn, upon the
mor« serious things of hie and death, these men can pro-
duce a most interesting theory of existence which claims
the closest attention, due no doubt to the fact that they
have dealt with the realities of life, and, strangely enough,
the romance and poetry of life lie very close beside the
In the following pages I propose to put in detail the
theory of existence given by a grim old retired officer as
I was greatly impressed by it, especially as it was worked
lip from his own observation, rather than from reading.
At the samedime we have had many close readers amongst
us, and the lessons they gave us will not be forgotten.
I Was wondering whom I might dedicate this little
work to, but, without mentioning any names, I am think-
ing mostly of three serious stretcher cases that we took
acres* that Creek, two of whom passed on, and one re-
turned. They all three were fine characters, and talked

before her death, and telling her daughter it was for her,
and so on. She never exactly expressed it, but we seldom
express-even if we comprehend, consciously—whht we
know sub-consciously. We act accordingly, howevei,
even though we cannot explain why we do so.
Everyone remarked, however, on what a softening

birds and flowers, tended by her new-found friend*.
Gp the first night I took my turn to watch between
i **
f . ■"'
midnight and dawn—that “turn of the night” that every
weary watcher talks so much about. The man going oil
was a big fellow, and he spread himself on the floor to
sleep. His great arms were spread, and legs bunched up
like a large spider. His nursing dress consisted of a
bathing suit. One contrasted—-not in an unkindly way
—this good-hearted, big-limbed returned soldier, with the
yvoman on the dying bed. Her delicately chiselled features
i *
and arms denoted the true artist, just as his appearance
denoted the true soldier and man. It was music to watch
his big hands handling a small spoon and giving nourish-
ment of his patient. He laughingly said he was a great
specialit, and had the whole of the medical practice of
■ “* L
North West Arm. He had. There was only one patient,
•/ JT 7
and he had her.
As I compared the two a heavy rainstorm poured on
the shingle roof —a roof of shingles carved out of the
very trees that were fallen to make room for “The Biv-
ouac ’ ’ —built by Bill Keough, another returned soldier,
by the way—and flames leapt from the fire. Did you ever
see “The Bivouac” fireplace? Well, it is the biggest I
know on Port Hacking. Its floor is a large rock. It
will take logs that two strong men must lift. The artist
was very pleased with that fireplace. As I watched, the
log burned into a large bright coal, shaped as of itself,
before it collapsed. I had seen many a log burn, but
not one like that. I was sorry she was unconscious. She
would like to have seen it, I am sure.
The morningy dawned. The doctor came. The
ambulance came. Oh, let me say one word of apprecia-
tion for the St. George Ambulance. At short notice,
over rough roads, they made their way. By this time
the artist’s sister had reached us, and was carefully tend-
ing her. We lifted the unconscious woman and helped
her arrange matters for the last journey.

As the writer was chairman of a movement to im-
prove the status of women and children, it follows that
many of our visitors who took an interest in such mat-
ters "gave their opinions from the historical and all other
points of view to me in fireside chats.
I was also presented with, and had loaned to me,
many rare and useful books on the subject, which I read
and pondered over in the quiet of this place. It will be
impossible in a work of this kind to take the readers
through all the interesting views that were put to me
by experienced and thoughtful people, nor even the main
outlines of the books referred to. I therefore take the
liberty of reprinting an article that I wrote for the press,
and which, in a condensed form, gives the result of the
debates, etc., on this matter.

STATUS OF WOMEN
Status of Women
Many of the former ideas of mankind on various
important subjects are now in the melting pot. There
has been a considerable change of opinion and policy as
regards the status to be accorded to women, and it seems
a favorable time to consider whether there should be
now an attempt to completely place them in the status
that they deserve, and which it is the object ©f this
article to show.
1 v.. ‘y&r'-
- ~-u'-. a- -S?> • X'- -. vg
History reveals the tragic position that women have
almost always occupied, not only as regards human
laws, but also as regards so-called religions, she having
been very generally regarded as a chattel.
Nearly all religions, and almost all people, ancient
and modern, have considered women to be inferior to
men. Few authorities have maintained any equality of
the sexes, and still fewer have claimed any superiority
for the female sex.
The weight of authority has always been in favor of
a doctrine of the superiority of the male, and in regard
to the human female, some religions, like some sects of
Mahommedans, even maintain that women have no souls.
Philosophers, so-called, have even gone to the extent of
contending that woman is an undeveloped man. Hence
it was but natural that she was early reduced to the
position of a dependent, a slave. Plato, for instance,
considered the wife to be part and parcel of the. husband's
estate, and in the same sense as his horse, his dog, or
slave —his property.
Shakespeare, in “The Taming of the Shrew,” alludes
to her as “goods and chattels,” and even some of our
past writers on evolution pre-snppose a superiority of
the male line. Starkweather was one of the first to re-
cognise the atrocious unfairness of

opinion of the superiority of man over woman is because
the former is more developed, as a rule, miiscularly.
Up to quite recent times, even in civilized eommuni-
ties, women were practically held in a sort of subjection
or to the man, and were not permitted to engage

»i sense,
noint of view is more often arrived at by a common-sense,
decision in the individual case rather than the admission
©f any general principles in her favor. |
Even in very modern, almost contemporaneous, poli-
tical beliefs, serious attempts have been made to again
place women in the place of chattels, and, State-owned ||
that Fortunately, such theories are d|bi|?s .f° |r 1 j
destruction, but it is one more of the many reasons why
we should now make a determined and final effort to
give woman such a status that such ideas could ffet^
occur again even as a fleeting theory. _
It becomes the duty of the writer in the interests ot
truth to point out that even in the Old and New Testa-
ments which form the Christian religion, the inferiority
of women is mistakenly insisted on in many passages
One writer has said that the reason that no particular
religion, ancient or modern, appeals to him is because in
none of them have women received their proper status.
This is more regrettable because any unbiassed observer
must admit that woman is a higher spiritual power than
man, and is, in fact, the preserver of chastity and moral-
ity, and it is not going too far to say that if women were
not superior spiritually and morally to man. there
would not be much virtue in our midst.
We have, therefore, only to add to the natural in-
clination of the man the teaching of various religions
that the woman is the inferior being, and we can easily
account for the ages-old injustice that have been done
to woman by man-made laws. For example, it may

ago a so-called Preacher, and a well-known man at that,
said that women had no soul.
Modern writers should avoid the errors so otten
made by past writers in referring contemptuously to
women in the way of illustration. For example, Cicero-
—who ought to have known better uses this lemark.
“Some men make the womanish complaint that it is a
great misfortune to die before our time.”
As a matter of fact, women endure enormously more

OLD BOB—OB P BBC EFT AND EXAMPLE
Old Bob—or Precept and Example
The woodearters’ camp was fixed on some gently
sloping ground near Dent’s Creek, and not far from
Jackson’s Hut.
Heavy weather had made the roads boggy, but the
carters had persevered with the loads of oak wood out
on to President Avenue, and thence to Sutherland Station.
The rain was holding off, and we sat round the camp-
fire on such improvised seats as the circumstances pro-
vided. ':-WmO fil
The horses clinked about in their hobbles (soine
authorities say the right word is hopples), while we
swopped yarns. , r--; v - ;Si : : -
One of the animals then took a great liking to eld
Bob. I won’t give his other name, as he may have feel-
mgs of modesty, but it is my duty to make it clear that
it was not voung Bob.
o
The horse nosed Bob gently round 1 the ribs, and
the caress was returned by patting.
“Now,” said Bob, “you fellows can see how friendly
/ / WJ f
a horse becomes. He knows by instinct anyone who is
kind to horses. You can do a lot more with them bv
- i -■ - .. ■ - ~ ; ' - ;. ■ . W
encouragement than by ill-treating them, or even swear-
ing at them.”
Bob continued impressively in this strain for some
JL Or
time, and certainly the horse seemed to take a lot of
notice of Bob.
Just then the horse took a step round and inclined
its head for another caress, it seemed. But Bob leaped
• « ■ X
in the air, with a yell of pain. The facts then quickly
revealed themselves. Bob had been sitting on a bag of
chaff, and the horse had simply an attack of cupboard
love. The sharp night air and the keen sense of smell
that horses possess were contributing factors to the

catastrophe. After smelling round, he thought the time
was ripe to bite the bag open, but by some error of calcu-
lation he got a bit of Bob as well
With much furious and unprintable language, Bob
drove the beast away with sticks, stones, old tins, and
'every missile he could lay hold of. Not content with driv-
ing the horse away from the coveted feed and the circle
of firelight, he drove him down the mountain-side, ex-
pressing a wish that he would break his so-and-so neck—
his remarks punctuated by the thud of sticks and stones.
Bob returned breathless, and rubbing himself in the

afflicted part, and, with a fihal word on the ingratitude
of animals, resumed his seat.
Silence then reigned for a few seconds, but was
broken by “Aub,” who said, “Well, Bob, that was a great
lecture on kindness to animals, and one thing I like about
you is the way you practise what you preach.”
After the laugh, in which Boh joined, we had another
pannikin of billy-tea, and turned in.

MY FIRST VIEW uF . WEST ABM
:r ■ Tv--v
My First View of Nor. West
Arm
Bush born and bred, I felt, after a few years ®f city
life, that I should like a place that combined the quiet
and peace of the bush, with easy reach of the city. This
thought soon ripened into a longing, particularly as one
4 or two of my near relatives to a certain extent shared
the idea —or ideal, shall we say? It led me on, some
years ago, before the war, to make many week-end ex-
■ eursions into unknown tracts within a measurable radius
of Sydney, and I could tell many stories of the minor
adventures that my ramblings produced. But, while
my geographical knowledge mounted up, no place suited
me. I must, forsooth, have everything in the one place.
Abundance of firewood (I am a demon on winter log-
fires), fresh water, and yet salt water, and tides at that.
Not those tides that merely rise and fall by impercep-
tible gradations on a wall face, but tides that raced over
flats, or bubbled over rocky necks. And there must be
I trees —good old pioneer trees—and mountains and odds
; and ends like that. Small wonder is it that my quest
ii for this veritable place of dreams was destined to be a
Pong one.

One Saturday, I noticed by a railway map that the
waters of Port Hacking came close to the railway line at
• one spot. The question of convenient access to Sydney
’ was favourably settled by the map. I determined to ex
1 plore it that afternoon, and set out from Sutherland, soon
1 locating Saville’s Creek, down which I travelled. It was
1 wild enough even for my dreams of mountain and
I Some. Oh, yes, there was an abundance of trees—T had
# j° b to get along. The many pretty little waterfalls
I• x .y'- ' ' # - - ■ ■

MY FIRST VIEW uF NOIL WEST ABM
charmed me. I reached a spot a little above the present
bridge and became much interested in caves with good
relics of aboriginal occupation.
From a rise nearby I saw the mirror of the large
fresh-water basin at the junction of Saville’s and Dent s
Creeks, and, crossing the mouth of the latter, passed on
towards Horne’s boat-shed. But the increased volume
of water caused by the junction of the two creeks now
made exquisite waterfalls ere it reached the saic water.
I did not recognise the salt water at the time.
Where the buildings of the settlement now stand
the oak trees were so thick that in places the body could
mot be got through. However, Dash-wood’s first track
twisted through the glade, and along the flat. I noted
where a bridge had to be to open up the place.
As I passed on I then j van amazi thing. I had
just passed waterfalls going seaward, and I met water-
falls, or, at any rate, water-races coming up to meet
them! In the one stream! I looked hack at the other
waterfalls. - They wcr e there all right. And the st s
were not parallel. And I was strictly sooer. And com-
paratively *sane (we are all only comparatively sane at
the best of times, of course). Well, these facts, taken
together, had to denote something. And, like a flash,
there it was. Why,.of course, that must be the incoming
tide of my dreams. The crystal tide running over the
level sand, filling the myriads of miniature lakes, and
lifting itself to the rocky ledges, gurgling over the stones
to meet its mate from the mountains- "Yes, they meet
twice a day, and tell each other the stories of their
travels. What joyful things they tell! What sad. things !
And just as they met, and where they met, I stood and

visioned my dream coming true. •
A bridge crossed the stream, the undergrowth ana
logs cleared away, definite roads and paths were formed,
queer hut homely buildings peered at me through the
frees, and friends came and talked by the clearing fires,
and laughed at my pioneering eccentricities, and they
stayed with me a little while, and went away. And some

So what I pictured in my first view of North West
Arm eame true, and more than that came true. I had
forgotten the shadows, but the Great Artist took the
brush from my hand and placed each shadow in its
right position on my little landscape. It made me sad
as each shadow went on, for I had a leaning to the garish
brightness of my sunlight effect, but I see now the finish-
ed picture, for I can at least appreciate the Good, the
Beautiful, and the True.

SPECIAL NOTE.~In an old book, with its rem-
nants of brown paper protecting cover, on the shelf at
the “Bivouac,” are found the historical records.
PC do not remove that old cover—it is so worn it is
-but little practical use now—for I think of the many
hands —some of them vanished —that have held it.
These records, in addition to notes of the progress
of the district since I first knew it, contain the result of
much patient research at the Public Library, and the
Mitchell Library into the early discoveries.

In getting at the facts I had to piece together the
history from many fragments (such as letters,, entries oa
maps, extracts from etc.), and also brought to
bear a close personal knowledge of every bit of the coun-
try and coastline concerned. Having been along the
coast in an open boat, I have been able to unravel some

of the apparent conflicts in different accounts of the
“Tom Thumb” voyages and other matters.
I do not think there is a more Connected account of

tralian library in the world. It is worth a visit. To be
a reader there it is necessary to go through some formal-
ities to establish character, bona-fides, reasons for re-
search, etc.
However, I hope the reader enjoys the condensed
account, the fuller details of which have been read to, or
by, so many of our visitors beside the “Bivouac” fire.
If you come, I will lend you that old book —or in-
flict it on you, as my daughter might warn you, as I
reach towards that high shelf.
DISCOVERY OP PORT HACKING
At the beginning of 1795, Captain Hunter sailed for
the second time for New South Wales, to succeed Captain
Phillip as Governor.
Of course, when we speak of the discovery of a
place, we mean discovery by white men, and modern
whites at that. We cannot peer far into the past, when
the blacks discovered and used Port Hacking, and even
other white men (for instance, the Dutch) undoubtedly
had found many parts of Australia long before the
Brtish did.
Bearing in mind, therefore, the restricted meaning
that we must, for present purposes, put upon the word
“discovery,” we will return to our story.
Captain Hunter, on this trip, brought with him the
two vessels “Reliance” and “Supply.” On board was
a young officer, Flinders, just from the South Seas, and
he had a passion for exploring new countries, and Aus-
tralia at that time provided about the most ample field.
They arrived at Port Jackson in September, 1795.
At that time the investigation of the coast did not extend
much beyond the three best-known harbors —a couple
more such, as Port Stephens, were also slightly known.
George Bass was surgeon of the “Reliance,” and a
man of similar age and character to Flinders. They
soon became fast friends, and were prepared to face any

These men were deputed to further examine the
-east coast of New South Wales, and thus we have shown 1
what led up to the discovery of the district in question.
They were supplied with a boat, eight feet long,
mi;
known as “Tom Thumb,” and their crew was one boy | 'JH
named Martin. They first inspected and mapped out
Botany Bay, and proceeded up George’s River about 22 || F
miles. Probably they reached to about where Liverpool , .• i
now stands, and to which tidal waters reached. They y ,,-j ■■£■ -|H
little thought it was be the spot chosen for one of the
biggest military camps of the Southern Hemisphere dur- i wPHBHK
ing the Great War.
Until March, 1796 Bass and Flinders were occupied by | ■■
a trip to Norfolk Island, when they again took up their |
work of exploring this district. They were informed by | |HHH
a man named Hacking, stated in one record to be a pilot, | BMffl *T
that while kangaroo shooting he had seen a large river
flowing to the sea, a little south of George’s River. This, dj HHh
of course, was Port Hacking, and, being observed from a I
distance, particularly if its widest part was seen, it was | HaH d

rather a natural idea of Hacking’s that he had found a |
magnificent river. As he seems to have been the first It Si

They bailed the boat, and anchored, and although
drenched to the skin, the three were so weary that they
huddled together and slept in the bottom of the boat.
Leaving Flinders’ Journal, and turning for a moment
to a writing of Bass, I will give you his exact words: —

'A* day broke I was the first to wake refreshed
“from sleep. The water was calm, and the light in the
“east was beautiful. The rising sun glinted on the most
“perfect little beach that I have seen in this world. Be-
“yond it, a clear waterfall fell into a lagoon. It was a
“beautiful little cove, and I felt it was our salvation.
“We called it Providential Cove, for if Providence had
“not brought us to it in time we could not have sur-
“vived. ”

The party landed on Wattamolla Beach on the
morning of March 30. They got a good supply of fresh
water, and rested. They recorded in their journal that
the inlet was a suitable anchoring place for large boats,
and that it had a fine sandy bottom for anchorage pur-
poses. I have, however, seen a fine boat smashed to splin-
ter* by losing its anchorage in a storm at this plaoe. C@r~

They stood to the north again, and at last found
the mouth of Port Hacking. It was known as Deebatt
by the natives. On April 1, 1796, they entered the mouth
of Port Hacking. They charted it as over a mile wide
at the entrance, and noted that it contracted as they
went inland, and it became shallower in parts, and they
divided it into various arms. They sounded it as three
wj
to eight fathoms deep in places.

There are traces of kangaroo hunts, and

got several references of Botany Bay, for instance, there
are accounts of a great deal of fishing going on there.
Soon after 1850, we find at page 117, Library Refer-
ence A. 923, 9 (6), Life and Adventures of Captain Wil-

Port Hacking, I give the library reference fully, as the

Captain Collin moved from Botany Bay to Port
Hacking, but found a family named Goggerly in posses-
sion. They lived in a stone house. Collin had with him
a sailor named Massey, who was very superstitious, and
learning from the Goggerlys that “yahoos” lived in the
bush round the port, he decamped, and left his master to

THE BIVOUAG
THE BIVOUAC
The westering sun throws long shadows from the
trees on the upland across the clearing and the gully to-
wards a quaint building, which stands on a shoulder of
the hill. Though low enough on the mountain side to be
sheltered from the southerly weather, it nevertheless
overlooks the stream and the road and bridge.

When these mountain sides were being formed, the
processes of nature operated in a way that resulted in a
range that turns just there at right angles, with the
result that Saville’s Creek coming down one valley meets
the main waters of North West Arm in the other valley,
also at right angles; or, rather, the actual meeting of
. ■■
the waters forms a large boomerang-shaped pool, so low
and sheltered that the wildest storm can scarcely ruffle
its surface. It is only when flood-waters rush down from
:
i
'h
the highlands of National Park past the “Bivouac” that
the water of that pool becomes troubled.

Although those long shadows from the trees seem to
speak of loneliness and sadness, yet the sunlight itself
filters through, too, and glints on the walls and high gable
roof, and if we look up to the sky the fleecy clouds near
the sun, reflecting its brightness, seem to smile at us and
make us feel happier.

The building is nicely situated so as to get the sun
from the east, north and west, through its erection at
that angle mentioned.

It was built by a returned soldier —one of the thou-
sand men. There is a bond that is greater than that
formed by any of the usual reasons that bind groups of
men together—the one that bound that thousand toge-
ther. We have often heard the expression, “He is one in
: a thousand.” Well, the builder of the “Bivouac” was

Selecting the site well, he fell some of the giant

southern end of the high tapering gable, you will see quite

THE FALLEN TREE
fMmmmmm* | w | jwwyim
I f ie 1 tee
Seated one Sunday afternoon ai iea in the old shack
at “ Wattlebrae,” we were startled by a louu and sudden
crash —very close, too.
Having a fair sense of direction, I soon located the
fallen giant—just on the hillside above the “Bivouac. ”
I remember distinctly the pleasant smell of the
fresh uprooted earth as many of the roots tore it up. In
childhood I was always greatly impressed with the
mysterious appearance of large trees that had been blown
up by the roots. The soil and clay would stick between
the straggled roots as they stood upright, so to speak,
and in time the clay and wood would become hardened
and whitened so that it became a childish pastime to pick
out which was wood and which clay. B\it they always
seemed to have a personality even in their fallen estate,
and indeed were weird. I knew that just beyond them,
too, was the dingo country, and many forbidden valleys.
As I watched our fallen tree, I noted the limbs still
settling down with groanings and creakings, and many
of them hung, the whole effect being like a huge and
many-legged animal that had received its death blow,
and was fast passing to a comatose condition.
I thought of that scene in the backwoods of America
when on the placid surface of a stream a boat was found
scarcely moving on the slow current. In it slept a man
of about middle age, his head on a rough cushion, and in
the boat his notes on nature. But his sleep could not be
broken by man. He was a writer, and had died peace-
fully at his work. But one of his last descriptions was
that ©f a tree which he likened by apt imagery to a man.
I forget the details, but the sap was the life-blood,
the bark the skin, the outer wood the flesh, and so on.
Of esurse, the limbs were the arms. And so his descrip-


I
Ifl more tree has fulfilled its part in the inscrutable plan of

tion —possibly his last words —always come to my mind
when I think of that fallen tree. Indeed, part of the
tree is there yet.
The attentions of wood-getters caused many of his
smaller limbs to pass through the crucible of the “Biv-

hill a few yards —and bush fires swept his body time and
a^ain —but the main trunk and a few of the larger limbs

—blackened, it is true —remain. One of these limbs goes
in the air and down again, in a rough arch foundation,
and I used to pass through that to a tent I had on the
shoulder of the mountain past it.
But that tree will never have to again go through
that ominous creaking and groaning, as he settled back
to earth, after watching perhaps centuries pass by, and
certainly seeing the blacks go and the whites come. Stil
the younger trees growing up around him will have to
go through it unless they are earlier removed for poles
isfm
or some such need. Some at least are fast arriving at
maturity, and in my mind’s eye I see them describing in
their fall an enormous arc against the clear blue sky of

I am sure some of our readers would have loved the
sunset here that afternoon. Although the exact spot of
IiSI
fits setting varies slightly all through the year, this after-
moon it dropped just at the head of the valley towards
Sutherland, and down which Saville’s Creek flows. The
v [western sky was a deep blue —for some reason there was
o redness near the horizon. But the red was reflected
strongly on clouds higher up—as if the sun, though out
(of sight below the range, shone obliquely up the sky.
[put from the clouds a further reflection, or sub-reflection,
efcame down upon the trees.and walls of huts down the
Worth West Arm., making them quite red. The blue I
attention above made me think of the ,blue of tropical
vwaters, and the edges shading to light green like th
Dpiore shallow -water of coral lagoons. Across these coral
lagoons (as in the Sandwich Islands) you can get ferried
ifin glass-bottomed boats, through which you look at e
Efcoral and bright-coloured fishes.

It» is li r ilf~past ten and I have 311st come in from the

Not that it will be, by a very long way, the last hre,
e n clearing-off fire, we will have here. But it is the
latest in point of time as I write. It is burning out there
now, just in the gully near the turn of a winding road,
I just’ at the last turn it makes before climbing the hill

The last shall be first, it has been said, and as I have
mention ed this fire, I may as well finish about it, before
HU; i:{
we go back to the first.
Well, there was a lady and her two children staying
at the u Bivouac/ ’ and they wished to see a stump burnt
out. So we selected one, going through the ;j ; t'
This consists of picking a place where there is a fair
pocket of good soil, or level ground, so that it is worth
the labor of removing the stump. Even the uninitiated,
at a word, will grasp why we don’t waste energy on
stumps in among rocks—we let nature take its course
yi ; Us esc. You then make sure the particular stump
is not in a suitable place, and. of a suitable nature, to saw
off smooth and straight for a seat; also that it is not
one of those easily grubbed out, in which case you grub
it, and roll it against another one, and they help each
other burn. Lastly you study a splitti fuel
piled rubbish and ugly pieces of wood (no good indoor
firewood, mind yon!) round him. But it was wet then,
and we said to the children, “Now, you must watch tor
this, maybe it will be dry in a day or two. But in a ciaj or

two the mother and children had gone home—the mother
to 6ihome in heaven, and the children to theirs on earth.
• 1 L^e s^um P was forgotten. But to-night we de-
cided to complete the task —somehow we did not like
to see it incomplete. And a man stood beside me while
we poked the burning pieces together.
Phe woman and the children were those I told you
about in the first sketch, and the man beside me was the
“ Spider. V
i°u can readily believe we were rather silent, and
saw their faces in the fire, and heard their voices in the
murmur of it.
„ the Spider has gone to his tent, and I am writ-
ing this, and the fire is burning out there under the stars.
Well, to go back to the first fire in North West Arm
■we can safely imagine it was a great bush fire, set
alight by one of those agencies other than the hand of
man, that ignited, and still ignites, forests and under-
growth. We can judge from what is left yet that those
eaiuy fires must have been very fierce in the heavily tim-
bered gullies and on the wind-swept uplands and hill-
tops.
Then we see with the eyes of imagination the count-
less fires of the tribes of blacks who lived or visited those
parts. I have dug through many heaps of shells si
they collected oysters and other kinds of shellfish in the
Wr ~eis of North "West Arm, and ate them at the camp-
fires. There are many eaves about here—with middens
iand stones piled to windward. The sheltered nooks close
bcsioe the waters from which came much of their food
would have made this a favorite resort of the blacks.
And everywhere about I find traces of the fires of
©ld-timers of our own race, which fits in with the numbers
of. old people who tell me bow they used to spend a day
or two here fishing and swimming.
Yes, I can imagine it —those dreamy old days! When
giant dead tiees stood or lay everywhere among giant

green ones. And most of tlie intervening spaces filled
witk tiosely growing oaks. And only rough tracks, and
wonderful nights of silence, and sunrises and sunsets
filtering through the trees in exquisite beauty.
And there would be flocks of wild duck in that big
fresh-water lagoon, or wheeling overhead in their well-
known formations, or maybe, sitting in the branches of
that big dead tree that Bill fell some time since. And
the cawing of many crows, and the laughing of many
jackasses. We have a few of these now—but what must
it have been like then!
The little waterfalls of the creeks would always have
been crystal pure, because no streets nor roads; directly
#r indirectly, discharged mud into them during heavy
downfalls of rains. But I guess there were many heavy
rains and floods, and trees whirling along in the cur-
rents and occasionally those old-timers crouched under
the caves, or hung on to the their flapping tents. But
they would be rewarded by the big fish that jumped in
* ■' iy O A'
the waters of the in coining tide. Ah! and a few nets and
other devices were used, I’ll be bound.
Then came our own first family camu-fire, when we
V A 3
sheltered under the big log at the swimming hole that
first night. We dipped our tea water from the stream,
and it was fresh, and the next lot we got was salt. But
we were not old-timers then, and did not grasp that v h
a good stream of fresh water coming down at low tide,
you can dip there. But we know these things now to the
flap of a fish’s tail.
I will hurry you over the fires that we had while
we dossed in tents. You just had to fall a tree into the
fire —or reach back for a piece of dead limb —anywhere.
After every fire you had a few feet more to move about
in. We cart the wood now. Still, we have plenty left-
up the gullies, and we take care of it. North West Arm

1 hen I remember, as we rose to the majesty of a
shack, in addition to the tents —a kind of town hall among
the dotted domiciles—a large heap of oakwood that my
brother had cut and piled, while he w r as clearing the place
ret we soon got through it.
And now I must tell you of a very interesting fire
indeed— one that I referred to in the Preface.
Against our shack lay a huge log. You could not
see over it, even a good way from the butt, so great was
its diameter. We used it for a wall for some time—hung
pots and pans on it. But we decided it must give place
to more conventional ideas. For many days the giant
* 'SJ & • ' * •• I Jr
burned, and one night the whole length of the inside-
. a seething mass of flame and glowing coals.
Seated at a necessary distance from its mouth were-
our visitors on that occasion. They included a retired
police officer, a retired hotelkeeper, a medical student, a
lawyer, and many others! We were short of a clerffv-

man, but all the same the talk turned on matters of the
soul, ihe debate that night—we sat up practically all
night in the comforting warmth from the great log—fixed
itself very deeply in my memory. No doubt the unique
camp-fire- like thirty feet or so of a great furnace, be-
cause the outer shell remained intact to the last-helped
impress the scene on me.

iiverybody contributed their earnest opinion about
the mystery of life. Some of them have since been able,
perhaps, to test their opinions, as they have passed from
earth! I knew some of these men in their ordinary daily
lives, and what impressed me then, as often since, is how-
different men are when you yarn for a few hours with
them by a camp-fire. I think you get to know the real
men then. lam glad to say whatever onr faults are, I
have vays found that men generally improve on a
quaintanee; of course, there are a few exceptions. I
like to think this proves we are all a bit better than we

I can see these rugged and experienced men sitting
there, and near them over again. It seems real. The
memory of it seems more real and calmly true than the
actual event.
Every one of those men believed in some form of
hereafter for the soul.
The police officer said life to him seemed like a flower.
The roots were in the earth and were coarse, but refine--

the mind from settling into a groove.
From time to time over the years we completed,
sometimes in stages, the building of large bonfires for
the children —our own and those of visitors. Frankly, I
think the grown-ups often enjoyed them, too. When a
place wanted clearing of a lot of dead bushes, we eeuld
•accomplish the double object by piling them up for a
bonfire —using an unwanted tree as a backbone, s# to
speak. This would cause the flames to reach higher.
These bonfires generally would take place just after
dark, and were always a great success. A bonfire in the

moonlight had a beauty of its own, too.
The flames would leap 50 or 60 feet in the air, often
going higher than the trees around. People would be
much interested in the different appearance of the trees
viewed from underneath, with the firelight playing on the
undersides of the branches.

It made wattles look like oak trees. Ido not forget
that. I have heard arguments as to which kind certain
| t(
| -Ci
trees were. From their position I would know from my
daytime knowledge (so to speak) what they were. I
would know they were wattles, but I admitted they
looked like oaks. So we often mistake the real facts of
life because we only see them in the night-lights and
shadows of time, instead of the clear light which is not
•of the night nor ihorning, nor dusk nor dawn.
Here let me say wattles always bloom more beauti-
fully in its last year. When you see a wattle outshine in
bloom all its mates, you will know that wattle will never
bloom again, and the expert bushman just as soon would
cut it clown as soon as the bloom had fallen, so it would

Stef?* in just then, let ns think of him in the same way as
the kindly bushman who knows what must happen, and
takes the tree entirely from human sight while the beauty
and fragrance of the last bloom still charm the beholders.
We must not wish to see the gaunt branches against the
stormy, darkening sky, nor hear the moan of winter winds
amongst its almost sapless limbs. How much better t*
always see that tree just as it was to the last —a memory
of beauty and sweetness for ever. So death and the bush-
man each know their work, and I see both their faces
look tired, and maybe they will be glad when the reaping
and tree-failing is over. We feel sometimes that c. en
the forces of nature that crush us feel sorry for us, but
have to do their work as part of the great Plan. I wonder
if man long ago understood nature better than we do,
and by becoming more absorbed in the conquest ©f
material things we have departed from inward know-
ledge of ourselves, and our relationship with nature-
intellectual advancement does not seem to take the plac*
of intuition and imagination. One philosopher said “Wi
are masters of nature externally alone; inwardly we are
nature’s slaves.”
But to return to our subject. Ido believe (in fact,
from observation, I know —not merely believe) that with
the Souls in Life’s Garden, or at any rate, certain ones of
them, God makes them bloom more beautifully at the-
last, as a warning and as a consolation. Just as the expert
bushman knows the wattle’s last bloom, I would think
an expert in Souls should know —or could by long ex-
perience know —when a Soul is passing from earth. There
would be an unselfish tenderness, a softness, a sweetness
in the blooming that a keen observer might detect as
compared with others under his observation, fine as their
blooms may be. For many of the other wattles are fine
iu their blooms, and sometimes none but the expert ca»
draw your attention to the last blooming.
I lately knew a wattle tree that had blossomed for

But it is now 12.30, so I shall conclude with my fav-
orite fires of memory—the “Bivouac” (indoor) fires
How many true and interesting (and inb.rad.cd;

kf %

logs of all the fires. That is a pretty legend that when
the wood burns the sound you hear is the singing of all
the birds that have sung in the branches of the tree.
How everyone looks into these fires. They supply

a poke at the fire. Shew me a man who can sit near

log nre and not poke it about, necessarily or unneces-
sarily, and I will tell you at once he is not a bushman,
even if he is not a true man at all.
Now we see all the old familiar faces in the fire.
What sweetness, what sadness. I wonder why it is when
we are beside the fire we always think of the Past, dream
of the Past, talk of the Past. Why do our bygone days
spring, bejewelled with tender memories, arain to life
when the flickering flaim lie tup rfa 3 and east
the shadows that come and go?
Perhaps it is because man first formed his soeial
ties around the fires in his first rude habitations. One
might fairly suppose that when individuals gathered round
the first fires, and found warmth and comfort, and did:
their first rough cookery, they felt more kindly to ea'ch
other, and so while outdoor fires become associated in #0
minds with good fellowship, the indoor fires remind 11s
of peace and happiness. He is an unfortunate man in-
deed that cannot conjure up a few genuine smiles of sweet
welcome from those already sitting there with the fir 9-
light playing on their faces, as he makes towards the
hearth, cold, wet, or fatigued.

The kindly glow of the fire brings back all our hopes
and dreams, and loves and landscapes, in a beautiful and
idealised form. The scientists tell us that fire releases
the radiance stored up in the trees, some of which were
gathering the brightness of the sunshine while the Macks
were roaming here. And at the same time the fire, luce
a magician, lets the sunshine of onr past stream out to us

The following are a few of the letters found in a
military kitbag hanging in the “Bivouac,” untouched
for a few years, but curiosity at last tempted me to open
it. I have selected a few that the reader might enjoy
as a glance at the lighter side of military life —and, in-
deed, a few interesting sidelights are cast on events at
the time. There can be no harm done, military or other-

Away to Billy-ho,
Friday iiigiit.
Miss L —Mosman, N.S.W., Australia.
My Dear L , The Sergt.-Major was round to-day,
as the boys bad been complaining about the tucker. He
tasted some liquid in a dixie. “Why, lads, it’s beautiful
soup. Thick and strong. What the devil more do you want 1 ?
There’s a body in that soup.” “That’s alright, Sar-
Maje,” drawled the mess orderly. “But that happens
to be the tea you are tasting! ”
Well, he went to the nest group, and asked for
complaints. “Yes,” said one, “the spuds is bad.” “The
spuds?” said the S.M., who is English— -just appointed-
“What’s he mean?” “Oh,” said the corporal, “he’s
igerant; he means taters. ”
I wish you could be told some of the interesting
things—censorship stops it.
I forgot to enclose a silver leaf in M ’s letter
(though I advised it), so I enclose it for her, and one for
you—if I don’t forget them both.
It may interest you to have a pen picture of the
circumstances under which this letter is written. To the
right is a high mountain, with a square top like a table,
and rugged outline on its shoulders. Vessels of all kinds
lie around. We are in a dock. It is nearly dark. 1

write this on a box set npon another, and the affair shakes
as I write. I have awkward equipment on because lam
corporal of the guard. Last night some “Cake Smoke”
got on board, and some of the boys got very merry, and
to-day they have been considering matters in the clink
But just now they are very happy. The Sergt. skipped
off, so I am letting them walk about the deck, ; as their
cell is stuffy. They are dancing about and singing. The
euards lean on their bayonets in the typical Aussie way
(one paper says the posts in London will all be leaned
crooked when Aussies go home). I can trust these men
so thoroughly there is not the least fear of them clearing
out. One thing these men will not do —they will not
break their word to me. I intend to leave them out as
long as I can. I just heard one of the guards say (they
are all chums) ; “Gripes, it’s getting dark. Don’t clear
out, Bill, for I can’t see to shoot you in the dark.” Some
niggers are telling our boys about their fighting in Africa.
I spent some time at the Museum yesterday. It was
very interesting. I will tell .you about some of the most
interesting. A kind of bird known as the social birds
make a huge general nest in a large branch. The trees
are large and each branch has a nest. Hence each tree
looks like a collection of haystacks. The nests are com-
posed of twigs and on the under-side grass and straw is
put. Then there are many little hollows, making, as it
were, cells, like the cells in a piece of honeycomb. Each
cell or sub-nest has a family and all the families make the
social nests. Please tell J about these as I make
all letters different, knowing you can change. Then we
studied a couple of gorillas (male and female) from which
man is supposed to have descended. I mean this was the
particular branch of the monkey family from which wc
are supposed to offshoot. The lady was so true to human
type we went to raise our hats, but just remembered we
were soldiers, and saluted. The head of the male was
almost exactly human —and a brainy-looking bloke at
that! He is very strong and no doubt a contingent of
them would work havoc with the Germans. Well, L

and if possible see them. The books to mother and Mr.

We are prohibited from discussing many subjects by
Mr. Censor, but I note that rats are not included in the
list; so here goes.

Well, rats are a suitable subject to discuss with you.
We are on a dark ship. Our main holes are for’ard, but
occasionally we nose our way along the passages, and
attack forage at the other end of the ship. When the
boys go through a case of apples, etc., they call it “rat-
ting.” (Most appropriate).
Our whiskers grow long on account of our rodent
existence, and, of course, are very handy when creeping
up dark stairways and passages, as we can feel if any of
our cobber rats are coming the opposite way. We eat
considerable cheese, and at supper time the rats collect
for nibbling their cheese. We sometimes get caught in a
trap. The big trap is called the ‘ ‘ clink. ’ ’ Our nests are
composed of many substances —such as empty eases, and
even blankets. Many of the younger and more active
rats swing from the ceiling in bag-like affairs, and when
the vessel rolls heavily—we are in heavy seas —they bump
together and squeak. Occasionally the eats come round,
to get the rats for guard duty, and the like, whereupon
the rats retire to their very furthest Igjrs but are often


AUSSIE LETTERS FROM ABROAD
dragged upstairs to the light, and fall easy prey. After
a few months of this existence we will, I presume, have
much smaller eyes, as nature always adjusts herself, and
our noses should become longer.

I remember once, before I became a rodent, lolling
round the Pacific in swell saloon style, but, with that
inevitable law of compensation that Emerson tells us of,
I have met my Waterloo. It all reminds me of old sea
tales of derring-do, particularly the Sea Wolf. But the
kf-.if,

rats will, one day emerge and become men again.
But, mind you, we have plenty of fun, and even when
we become drenched with extra big waves, we squeak
with glee —particularly if the other fellows get it, and
we miss.

My Dear L . As we have many experiences to

the censor won’t let us) we have got to get a move on,
so I will deal out 3 cards to you, hoping you put them
all together, getting the whole pack between your folks

a talk. I first tried him on his age. Bringing up various
soldiers of widely different ages, I tried to get him to
compare his age. This experiment failed. I referred to
■‘moons” —also no good. However, he made me under-
stand he would grow no more, by placing his hand over
his head, and shaking his head. At last, after much
brain sweat, a light came over his face. '“Ah, mark!
mark! (imitating marking a pole, tree or other upright).
Thus I gathered some tribes ‘ ‘mark ’ ’ their ages so. He
said “No mark” (pointing to himself)- —pointing to the
hills: “Mark.” “Some trib es mark, some not, said 1.
He grunted approval of this. “Ask him if he’s married.”
(said one of the Aussies). He nodded. “How many
children?” was the next one. There were piccaninnies
about, so this was easy by pointing. He had 3. How
long had he been married? He thought a long time.
How many years? (Wave just splashed through port-
hole —never mind what i said). At last, after some
thought, he said, One! I said I was shocked at this, and
he laughed most heartily with the rest of us. “Must be
about six years you mean?” said 1, wiith an experienced
nod. “Yah,” he said, “six." Evidently he was agree-
able to make it any number to uphold the respectability
of the family. The way that joker laughed was good to
see. He evidently realised that he had escaped from a
logical absurdity by following a diplomatic lead when it
was given him. We brought him some tucker, which he
had a feed of, putting the rest in the “cadging bag”’
(which many of them carry round with them) to take
home. He was much interested in the short, stubbly
beards that some of the soldiers had (being rough, and
running out of water made shaving difficult). He felt
this and then his own chin. I felt his skin and the whole
face was as smooth as a child’s. The texture of the skin
(strangely enough) was very fine, finer than ours, really,
though the color of the skin would prevent your noticing
this at first. Some of them came round the boat in can-
oes to sell fruit. An officer pointed a rifle at them, and
you should have seen them send that boat sweeping over

But when a man fell overboard a black man saved him
(or rather, his rescuer), and they coaled our ship,
working throughout days and nights for a pittance and
scraps of food (but those are other stories). The white
men have taught them their worst oaths, witnout telling
them what they mean, and it’s most laughable to see
them, with a comical expression on their faces, asking

(2). Cape Smoke is the name for a vile, secretly
distilled drink that our soldiers get hold of (the ordinary
pubs that sell better stuff being closed to them). 1 was
told of the horrible effects of this, but no description
equals the truth. Lying at Capetown, one night when 1
was in charge of guard ’tween decks, I saw a man leap
up and bark like a dog, and race after men, trying to
bite them. I thought it was a joke, til! 1 saw his eyes.
He was mad. Cape Smoke. He thrashed the iron pillars
Tween decks because they challenged him, he said.
Grabbing mouthfuls of bed clothes, ne tore ttieni from
the sleeping men, and finally, with terrible snarls, he
fixed his teeth in a deck tub (these are heavier than an
ordinary vrashing tub) and raced round with it. An-
other man and I grabbed him, and after much persuasion,
got him to imagine he was a great pugilist, and we were
training him. Gradually massaging muscles and limbs
he ink to sleep. In half an hour, with frothing mouth,
he was again attacking us. He seemed to have terrible
power in his teeth, and his hallucination lay in the pro-
position he was a powerful mastiff, and gee! he did act
the part. As he snapped at me I saw all sorts of visions
of hydrophobia. It took half a dozen of us to hold him.
He got over it. I saw the same man playing a little

something that put me in mind of Cape Smoke and that

As they seemed serious and interested, I guessed the distance

account of the confession which followed, though the other
names don’t matter). “There’s no doubt King suffered more
from his dreams than the gallows. You’ll remember the King
case, Corp. ; where the husband murdered his wife by cutting
her head right off.” (I remembered the case, and have no
doubt of the truth of the dream incident). “Well, while wait-

through a little misunderstanding, I was in the same place as
he was for a While —and he often came to me, and said, “I

every night with her head off, and a knife in her hand.”
“It’s pretty terrible,” said Ellis, the ex-eommerial travel-
ler, as he looked towards the horizon in the direction where
we last saw Australia a few weeks ago, “but I used to travel
all over Australia, and had some terrible nightmares in my
travels. One night I had a bad headache, and dozed off. I
dreamed I was paralysed, and people thought I was dead. I
could hear them preparing the coffin, and they put the shroud
on me, and I was in terrible agony because I couldn’t speak.
My people kissed me, and folded my hands, then they put the
lid on, and started nailing it down. Each nail was like a dart
through my brain. When the last nail was driven I woke and
found shooting pains in my head. No doubt the headache re-

THE FINAL THOUGHT |
The Final Thought I
So we come to the end of our true stories, grave and
gay, and of camp-fire talks and debates, and I will try
to soothe any feeling of disappointment on the part of
our readers by a final word. The idea ot this final word
is to see if we can so gather the threads of our experi-
ences and contemplations as to make an interesting and
useful fabric.
And we really have before us, even in this little
settlement all the necessary threads that make the warp
and woof of life. The oak tree is potentially present in
the acorn. Study life closely in one small place, and you
can describe it at large.
Here we have the message of the tides and the
streams. We see trees around us hundreds of years old.
We have watched nature temporarily overcome by man.
And we have seen nature eventually triumph.
We have seen great bush-fires and wonderful floods- —
have seen people laugh, and cry, and smile, and die.
The sun filters through the trees in its settings, and
each morning anew the birds shake the dewdrops from
the oaks.
Our friends have given us freely of their experiences
—of their inward spiritual experiences that they rarely
care to talk about in the surroundings of the city.
And they have given us rare books to read.
And what can we make of the old, old riddle of ex-
istence?
We peer into the past, and see a wonderful thread
running through all the religions and philosophies of
men. Does the grave end all? Was it the end for the
prehistoric man, who was evidently drowned in the
Thames (his bones being found when tunnelling under
the river!, when it was a mi<rhtv stream and tributary

of a still mightier one that flowed north through what

thousands of years? Was it the end for those precious
little ones that you and I have laid to rest from time to
time, and shall we see their smiles no more except in
memory, and that, too, to cease, when our bodies leave
the surface of the earth to join the millions of those below
the surface? And was it the end for all those millions?

Was it even the end for those half-animals, half-
humans that bore the burden of evolution, and lifted
the race from the lower forms of life through the first
stages of love, when the mammals suckled their young,
to the flowers of creation —those perfected souls we have

I think evolution was beautifully expressed by the
writer who said, “The spirit slept in the atone, dreamed

has bloomed to perfection time and again in noble and
precious men and women. Even as the petals drop, the
fragrance remains.

And so the humblest of our departed little ones now
know more than all our priests and kings, and philoso-
phers and scientists and historians put together know!
And the humblest places they hallowed with their
presence becomes to us more sacred than the greatest
cathedrals and temples and palaces on earth!
We who are still on the earth, regardless of our
position, power or learning, merely guess—they who
have passed know.
As we look on their noble faces ere we say farewell,
and note the triumphant and happy smiles that so many
bear —even when death is sudden —the wonders of myth-
ology, the ages-old traditions, the religious and secret
rituals, and phi losophies seem to roll up into convenient
scrolls to be put aside without more study, for they have
passed beyond the stage that requires these. We our-
selves feel by a reflected glory from them that our own
contemplations can be lifted to higher altitudes.

But the faces of the dead, though often more beauti-
ful in death than in life, are inscrutable. If they solved
the great mystery as their souls left their bodies, they
do not tell us. Yes, they have solved it. If it is dream-
less sleep for ever, their silence has solved it If they
pass on to a perfect existence, they have solved it. If a
stage further is all that is traversed —that stage behind
the door of death —that scene beyond the impenetrable
veil is sure to be so important, and progressive that re-
latively they have solved it, compared with what little
we know —or they knew just that moment before they
left us.

I think we must comfort ourselves by the reflection
that the only reason we do not understand is because our
senses are finite.
I talked with an old grave-digger whose home is in a
cemetery, and whose children were brought up there. 1

“Well, I do, but it ought not to be. There’s something
wrong with us. It’s just that we don’t understand.”

Certainly, clever and sincere men have contended
that there is nothing beyond the grave, and it is useless
to say it can be positively proved they are wrong. Rather
let us remember that able men of all ages have stoutly
maintained the reverse, and it mav be more than “a

The philosophy of suffering would shew that no man
is justified in begetting a child, and no woman is
justified in bearing a child if the grave does end all.
Many lives are demonstrably sad and unfortunate, and
of tie others, many have sorrows that only their
spiritual, medical, and legal advisers know, and still

boso a of the suffered, and never reach even the con-

that, not as a pessimist or growler —I have had my share
of scrrow—but, I hope, I have raised my share of laughs
and smiles. No, I say that because it’s true. But I will

say something else that is equally true. If life’s lessons
are part of a grand plan, and if our suffering is to teach
our souls, then life—even earthly life —can be regarded
as magnificent and beautiful and wonderful. If you
punish a child merely as a punishment, there is not much
in it for the child or you—-if you punish him as part of
a well-thought-out scheme to make a good man of him —
then it seems everything that is for your own happiness
and the child’s.

Pain and sorrow teach the tenderness of humanity,
and the sweetness of commiseration. They stir our hearts
and make us kind and sociable.

In this world we are deprived of certain facts about
the mystery of our existence. We know rationally
neither whence we came, nor where we are going. The
young medical student can describe the origin of the
body; the greatest doctors and scientists admit they
are baffled on the subject of where the life comes from.
If they cannot tell us where it came from, they cannot
tell us* where it goes to. But it is natural and reasonable
for us to conjecture about it, and everyone is entitled to
his or her opinion.

The only assured fact is that we do exist, and we
inhabit a planet always in movement in the midst of still
larger worlds. Probably as I write, other worlds, and
even universes, are being boi-n. It is unknowable at
present. It is useless to worry about the beginning or
the end. We can only do our duty—that is, seek our own
and others’ happiness.

I have read deeply into rival religions and philoso-
phies, but it seems to me hard to accept from other men,
however worthy of confidence they may be, ready-made
solutions, the frame-work of revelations, the metaphysical
arguments of scholars.

I think there is an element of good and evolutionary

even many secret organisations. Music, as I understand

I like that verse of Longfellow's;—

Poor souls! trying to conceal the grief that might
be assuaged (I know it cannot be wholly stayed; if tne
natural pride and dignity would unbend a little, and
reach for sympathy and help before it is too late.
But we must sanctify our grief by patience. W e
mav as well have no illusions about the universality and
necessity of suffering, but there is a reasonable hope that
the end will be perfection.
We may go into these matters another time, but I
would say now that I earnestly believe more can be learned
by contemplating the actions and words of a beautiful
human soul than pondering for years over tomes of
religions and philosophies. These things have their use,
and are right in their place, but we could blot them all
out of existence if we had just a few more of those 1! beau-
tiful souls” that spread a good influence wherever they
jig
go.
The most impressive ceremonies shrink to a tedious
mumble compared to their truly selfless actions; the most
terrible and secret oaths and threatened punishments re-
strain us less than their tears; their wistful looks raise
doubts about our views more than learned books in oppo-
sition ; their smiles are a greater encouragement in good
works than the hope of heaven. They fan anew the

dwindling faith in God, and make us realise the ultimate
good in all things, when we have passed the training of
suffering.
They make us dimly to vision the new heaven and
earth that are in the making. We observe how they
carry their crosses and smile —as we meet them on the
4/
road of life. They have spiritual insight and tender
sympathy with others in their pain. Sorrow and disap-
pointment do not seem to make them bitter. There is
not a trace of hardness in their expression. Sad at times,
but always the lines are soft and sweet.
