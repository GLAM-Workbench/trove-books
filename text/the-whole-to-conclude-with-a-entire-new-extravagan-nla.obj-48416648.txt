Of the most novel and thrilling interest, which has been for many weeks in active preparation, with
HEW SCENERY
Novel fflechanicalEfiects
And which has achieved an unprecedented world-wide popularity and enthusiasm, in the principal Theatre* of
LONDON and the CONTINENT, forming, altogether, the most absorbing and extraordinary
GHOST STORY
Ever presented to the Public. Tbe Drama is founded on the following
LEGEND * CORSICA
A\ Inch has been for centuries, and is at tbe present time, firmly believed by the
JVATirEto of TUJMV ISIjJMWD.
“The following astounding facts are preserved among tbe FRANCHI, as a FAMILY TRADITION. About
Three Hundred Years ago, one of their direct Ancestors died, leaving two Orphan Children, deprived of both
Father and Mother; these two children, left alone in the world, were aware of their isolation, and loved each other
with the whole amount of affection they could have felt for Father and Mother, if their Father and Mother had
lived. This affection became proverbial throughout the country; and as if to give it a sanction more holy still’,
than the natural sentiment that united them, to it the sacred sanction of tan Oath, they
swore that nothing should separate them, not even Death ; and at the end of what they considered a potent
conjuration, they each of them wrote with his Blood upon a parchment, which they exchanged, this
solemn promise—this reciprocal engagement, ‘‘That the first that «ii«il should appear to the other at the
very instant of hi* death, and afterwards at all the momentous periods of his life." Three months after
the accomplishment of this mystic ceremony, one of the Brothers, who was at feud with a powerful family of
Corsica, fell into an ambuscade and was killed, at that moment his Brother, uneasy on his account, was sealing a
letter he had just written to him, but as he was applying the seal of his ring to the still burning wax, he heard a
sigh behind him, and turning, saw Isis Brother standlutr with his hisntl placed U|ioii his
Shoulder, although he did not feel that band, then, by a mechanical movement, held out the letter that he had
destined for him, the other took it sadly, shook his head, and stretching bis hand to the extremity of the chamber,
he cons man (led the wall to open —it did so! and the living Brother beheld the whole scene 4*f
assassination. He saw his Brother contend with, and fall beneath, the hands of murderers, and so perfectly
did he behold all this, that when he met with these men, whom he had never seen before, he not only recognised
them, but he was further able to trace and bring to light every detail of their crime from the profound obscurity
is which the assassins believed they had buried it. These Two Brothers it appears had engaged not only them-
selves but all their descendants ; for, from that period, apparitions have appeared, as well at the moment of death,
a* on the eve of all remarkable events that happen to the Family of die Franchi.” Upon this extra-
ordinary Story, Mons. Alexandre Dumas founded his very popular work of “ Les Freres Corses," from which
the present Dramatist has produced this most extraordinary Drama, which has proved the most attractive ever
produced on the Stage.
