Barkley : “ Why is it a woman can
never keep a secret ? ”
Henpeck; “ But she can. I have never
succeeded in getting my wife to tell me
where she hides our pocket book, and
I’ve been trying for fifteen years.”
Beauty unadorned may be mostadomed j
but, fortunately for the milliner and the
dressmaker, it doesn’t think so.
O’Flaherty; “Is your son working
now, Pat ? ”
Pat: “ Share an’ he’s got a job in a
powder mill, with good prospects nv
gittin’ a rise.”
“ This is the seventh time you’ve been
before me,” said the magistrate. "Yes,”
replied the culprit; “it’s strange how
some men hold on to office.”
Downer: “ I am very glad it is good
form not to wear a watch with a dress
suit.” Upper : “ Why ? ” Downer: “ Be-
cause I never have my watch and dress
suit at the same time.”
Smythen : “ Poetry is a gift.” Rhythm
(gloomily): “That’s what it is. You can-
not sell it nowadays.”
Willie : “ Pa, what’s an ultimatum ? ”
Pa; “It’s a demand for something we
can’t have without fighting for it.”
“Papa,” said little Percy, “Why doesn’t
mamma travel with the circus?” “Why ?”
Mr. Henpeck asked ; “ what could she do
in a circus ? ” “ She might be the strong
woman. I heard her telling grandma the
other day that she could wind you round
her little finger just as easy as nothing.”
A minister’s little daughter and two
little boys, the sons of commercial travel-
lers, were talking about their respective
fathers, and what they did. One little boy
said:—“ My papa sells shoes.” The other
said—“ Mine sells paper,” and turning to
the little girl, “ What does your papa sell?”
For a moment the child hesitated, but, not
to be outdone by boys, she replied with u
grand air—“ My papa sells talk.”
The Ruling Passion.— Editor’s Wife—
Oh, John, baby has swallowed a but-
ton!” Editor—“ Well, let’s hope it
won’t hurt the poor little chap, but should
it happen to kill him, what a splendid
alliterative headline it will make! “A

" I’m a reader of your paper,” said the man whose head
was bowed down by reason of a boil on the back of his
neck. * “ I came in to make a request."
“ Well,” replied the editor, “ what can I do for you ? ”
“ I want to know if you can’t stick your posters a little
ower down, until I get over this trouble of mine.”
At a public gathering lately one of the gentlemen present
was called upon for a speech, and this is how he responded :
“ Gentlemen and women—l ain’t no speecher. Mor’n
twenty year back 1 came here a poor idiot boy, and now

A gentleman tells of the loss of a steamer through the
carelessness of the captain, who stood upon the pilot-house.
A rock appeared ahead; in trepidation he rang two bells,
one to “go ahead ” and one to “go astern.” The engineer
obeyed both bells, and the boat parted in the middle.
“ What makes you limp so ? Shoes too small ? ”
“ No ; feet too large.”

Mary's Trials and Triumph.
Shame on yon, George,’ thus spoke his spouse,
And sad tears with her voice were blended ;
* This is the way you keep your vows,
And thus your vaunted love has ended.
1 Scarcely a year has passed away
Since these your vows of love were spoken,
But vows and promises, they say,
Are made, like piecrust, to be broken.
' Now not one word of love you give,
No smiles, no kisses, or caresses ;
And every weary day I live
Your coldness my poor heart oppresses.’
* Mary,’ said George, ‘ you need not scold ;
Stay your reproaches for a season.
I may, perhaps, be cross and cold,
But, wife, I have sufficient reason.
‘ How do you think that I, whom you
With your vile cookery are killing,
Can smile and kiss, and bill and coo,
When pain through every nerve is thrilling!
* Look at the pastry, cakes and bread
You place upon this breakfast table ;
Say, to digest such lumps of lead
Is any human stomach able ?
‘ You quote a proverb to me, but
About your piecrust ’twas not spoken,
Yours might with axe or saw be cut,
But could not, like a vow, be broken,
sp
A WORD TO
YOUNG WIVES.
Be Wise and remember the
aphorism that ' The road to a
man’s heart lies through his
stomach.’ Therefore, do not
imperil your husband’s affec-
tion by upsetting his diges-
tion, when by reading the
marginal verse and profiting
by Mary’s experience, you can
ensure his undying devotion.
‘ Now, mark this, Mary, if love’s flame
Has vanished like a bursted bubble,
Yours is the fault, you are to blame ;
Your cookery has caused the trouble.’
‘Oh, George,’ said Mary, ‘say not so,’
And here her voice began to soften,
‘ls mine the fault? Well, well, you know
I have tried hard, I have tried often.
* To make light cakes and bread and paste,
But trying always ends in failing,
Constant disaster, loss and waste
Prove all my efforts unavailing.’
‘ The fault is yours, and yours alone,’
Said George, and here his voice grew louder,
‘ Nor can I such a fault condone,
You will not use WAUGH'S BAKING
POWDER.'
‘ I’ll try it George ; I will, indeed,
Lest constant broils our hearts should sever.
She tried it, praying to succeed ;
Success at once crowned her endeavour.
No trouble now with cakes or bread,
No fear the pastry is not rising,
No longer sodden lumps of leads,
But viands light and appertising.
And no dark cloud of storm and strife
Now rises o’er the breakfast table.
Mary, a fond, a happy wife,
To cook to George’s taste is able.
And George, so all his neighbours say,
Of his dear wife grows daily prouder ;
While both for ever bless the day
When first she used WAUGH’S BAKING
POWDER.

Two East-enders were discussing the war news.
“ I say, Bill, who’s this ’ere Warren ? ”
M Why,” said the other, “he was a copper once. Charlie
Warren, doa’t you remember ? ”
The other reflected for a moment, then he said, medita-
tively :
“He never copped me. Which was his beat ? ”
“Were you reaUy happier before you became civilised ?”
asked the white man.
“ Well,” answered the Pacific Islander, “ I must say I
