OURSELVES.
4- 4> 4-
IN launching our frail barque on the
stormy waters of journalism, we have
undertaken a task both difficult and
dangerous. Even in times of PEACE the
lot of a newspaper man is not a happy
one, so you can imagine the task we have
undertaken in the present conditions.
The members of our Staff, like our
readers, are all war-worn warriors of over
four years' hard fighting and dodging bayo-
nets and bullets as well as shells and shrap-
nel —and work. They are broken down in
spirits -so far as spirits can be broken
down (and that's saying much) —still we
will try as a last kick and dying flutter to
produce the Ship's Magazine.
Our office is situated in a Spraying Room
originally intended for the destruction of
microbes. This is now very suited to the
disinfection of our M.S.S. prior to publica-
tion. Its prominent position on the for'ard
deck seems to impress the diggers with the
idea that it is an Enquiry Bureau, or Home
for Waifs and Strays. Our Staff is kept busy
answering foolish questions or paying
pretty compliments to the eager information
seekers. In consequence of this, our Office
Kat has given notice to quit owing to too
many " backsheesh " kicks being bestowed
upon her after such interviews.
4- <s>
Our lady clerk has deserted us and taken
up her abode with a ship's fireman for the
sake of peace and quietness and to escape the
love sonnets of the poet.
Let us remind our readers that our present
address is a mobile one, as we are crossing
the briny ocean on one of the palatial liners
of the Commonwealth and Dominion S.S.
Company : the smart ocean-going S.S.
Port Hacking—a magnificent craft of some
" ninety thousand tons " —or less. In her
efforts to put up a record run and cause
excitement for the troops aboard, she
tangoes or foxtrots to the music of the wild,
wild waves, the wind in the rigging and our
symphony orchestra, accompanied by Ross'
bagpipes.
The result is that our whole staff imagine
that it is once more out-back, astride buck-
jumpers . Even our crack rough - riders take
their grips fore and aft to keep their balance
and hold their own, while the Art Editor
settles his spectacles firmly, takes a fresh
grip—and adds a line to the drawing in the
wrong column as the ship lurches.
Despite these difficulties, we are deter-
mined to make this Ship's Magazine the
Star of the East and with a competent crew,
a trusty skipper, steady pilot and favourable
conditions, we hope to have straight sailing
to success:
G.P.J. Sherringham,
Editor.

A DAY IN A PILOT'S LIFE
IN THE A.F.C.
By Lieut. Nosedive.
4- 4> 4*
A SHAKE on the arm and a voice saying
" It's 5.15, sir ! You leave the ground
in a quarter of an hour," brings you
with a crash from the land of dreams.
Your first thoughts are for the weather, and
you ask your man " What's the weather
like ? Dud ? " (i.e., unfit for flying). At
last you tumble out, shivering and don your
flying kit and make for the mess, where Old
Mac., the mess corporal, has a cup of hot tea
and a biscuit awaiting you, which puts you
in a much better mood.
" Come on, you chaps," the Flight Com-
mander roars. So you stroll down to the
'drome, from which comes the sound of
engines running, and you confer with the
Flight Commander as to what formation the
flight is going to fly in, and what your posi-
tion will be in it. Having polished your
goggles and put on several pairs of gloves,
you walk to your machine, which has now
been " reved " up. A mechanic sits astride
the tail to hold her down, a smile and a nod
from the " ack emma," and you know
things are O.K. So you jump into the seat
and run your eyes over the instruments and

guns—everything O.K.—you wave your
hand, the chocks are pulled away and you
44 taxi " out into the field.
4- 4* 4-
All in position, the Flight leader opens up
his engine, the rest following in turn and you
take up formation—being mighty careful
not to get into another machine's backwash
or you will go into a spin and probably
crash. For the next half-hour we climb
steadily towards the line and at 15,000 feet
we are above it and nothing is to be seen bar
a few " Harry Tates " (spotters), doing their
tour up and down the line.
We cross the line, making towards Lille,
still climbing and keeping a sharp look-out
for Huns. Nothing doing, so you let go a
burst or two to test your guns—then,
44 crump, crump," and you realize you have
been flying straight making an excellent
target for "Archies." You now make an S
course and, still climbing, you look at the
altimeter, which reads 20,000 feet, and it is
bitterly cold. We change our course and
looking well into the sun for Huns (for it is
there the wily Hun is waiting to drop on the
poor beggar who drops back from his flight)
when, suddenly, the leading machine fires
a red light and you know the Hun is about.
Away down below can be seen a few dots
and by their actions you know they are
Huns. Down you go, with engine all out
and doing about 250 miles an hour, and,
marking your man, you go for him and put
in a burst. But he goes down in a clever
spin and you dare not follow, for he is too
low and many a good fellow goes West
through following down too far. So feeling
rather savage with yourself for missing him,
you flatten out and look for the Flight and
climb up to them again.
You hardly take up your position when
another crowd is sighted —the Hun is up on
the job with a vengeance so down you go
for another thriller. This time being luckier,
getting right on his tail and put a burst in
at 200 yards. He side slips and tries to
manoeuvre for position, but you manage to
hang on his tail. A couple more bursts and
down he goes in a wild circling plunge, then
completely out of control. You wait
anxiously for him to burst into flames,
when crack, crack, and the zipp, zipp of
bullets through your machine, brings you
back to grim reality and you know that
whilst you were watching the Hun's wild
plunge, somebody has got on your tail.
You do a hundred things in a second.
Looking back you see two Fokkers coming
at you, all out, so you spin, side slip, and
then zoom up in fact everything you can
think of to keep the ring of those sights out
of the line of your head. When, all of a
sudden, the zip finishes and you find, on
looking back, that your flight has got on to
them and one is tumbling down like a comet,
flames streaming behind him and the other
fellow making for home. Then you just
scrape over the line, getting "Archied " to
hell, and fly slowly over the G.C.S. at St.
Venant, land at the 'drome and taxi in.
4- 4- 4-
44 Get anything ? Machine alright ?"
are thrown at you by the mechanics. 44 Yes,
got one, 'busgood-o." Then you jump out
and look over the 'plane for bullet holes and
Archie rips, but find you have been lucky,
only the fabric torn in a few places. After
going to the Squadron Office and making
your report to the C.0., comes breakfast
for which you are ready. A clean up, a spell,
then lunch and up again at 2 p.m., after
which you should be finished (if you are
lucky).

A LAST WORD ABOUT
THE WORLD WAR.
By Captain H. Neville Roberts.
4- 4>
I THINK you men who heard me when I
lectured at St. Budeaux Camp on the
War, know that I was genuinely pleased
to come and talk to you. I looked happy on
the platform, did I not ? That was your
doing, for you were an audience after my
own heart.
In taking up my pen to write as promised
for your ship's magazine, I am nearly as
happy, but not quite, for I should be still
better pleased to see you all about me, as I
did in the Y.M.C.A. Hut at St. Budeaux.
4- 4- 4>
I tried to tell you what you have helped to
save the world from ; the threat of world-
conquest by Germany. I cannot repeat the
long story of the German plot to enslave the
world —you were more patient with me than
the Editor of your magazine would be—but
I shall try to put the main point in a nutshell.
The German Empire was built up by war
—three short, sharp, successful wars. The
German people came to believe in war as a
very paying business, and, just when they
were drunk with their victories there began
the teachings of Nietzsche, followed by
Treitschke, both declaring that war was the
one thing for which every German should
live and should prepare night and day.
4». 4- 4-
The German Military Party, which ruled
Germany, took up the teachings of these
two men, made them their aim and policy,
foisted them on the people and steeped the
mind of the people for the last three genera-
tions in these ideas of war, ruthless war
that was to bring the world under their heel.
This what they called " Kultur," which
means " something cultivated," or,
" something produced by breeding." So
the German States deliberately, and suc-
cessfully, bred a race of Germans with a lust
for war, a lust for world dominion, and a
blood lust for the blood of England.
4> «*> <s>
Then there arose in Germany, about
twenty-five years ago, a party which began
to talk of a German road to the East as a sure
road to their conquest of the world. This
party called their plan the " Mittel Europa,"
or Central Europe scheme, and their aim
was to dominate a great belt of territory
stretching across Europe and down into
Asia, from the North Sea on the one side, to
Railway, connecting the North Sea with the
Persian Gulf, and in 1914 they had got it all
except the bit passing through Serbia and
Bulgaria. Hence the war started by a
flormon nlnt that hrniioht dhmit a niiarrel
German plot that brought about a quarrel
between Austria and Serbia. And the
world was at war to prevent Germany con-
quering the world.
4> 4» 4-
Your job during the last four years has
been to save, not only the British Empire,
but the world, from the barbarous and in-
tolerable rule of the Hun bully. If they had
got their "Mittel Europa" scheme, they
would have got both the British Empire and
the rest of the world under their devilish
control, for what nation could have stood
—~~
against them if we could not, or would not ;
if our Navy had not kept open the seas of the
world ; or if our men had failed us ?
4> 4* 4> |
Your job is done, as far as beating the
contemptible Hun at his own game of war is
concerned. You have helped to smash his
boasted war machine, and to smash it ut-
terly. You have helped to lay the pride of
the German beast in the dust. You have
won through the biggest task that the British
—®
Empire has ever undertaken in all its his-
tory. You and I know that it has been
worth doing. Neither you nor I would
change places with any man in the wide
world who has not had a hand in it. We are
glad that we were born at a time which gave
us a chance of taking a hand in it. We might
have gone through life in some narrow rut,
without an opportunity of doing anything
big. This has been an opportunity, and we
have lent a hand at making history—world
history. There is still work for us to do—
work that is worth doing, and worth doing
well. We have to re-build this Empire of
ours, and we must not build it of the broken
bricks that the war has tumbled about our
ears. We must see to it that the building is
better than ever it was. The war ought to

continent of Australia better than it was
before —more worthy of the greatness it has
achieved in this great war. Our job over
here is to re-make the Home country, to
extend our hand to Australia with all the

the Hun beasts until they have shown that
they are fit to be at large in a civilised world.

SHOCKS AND STARES.
By Lonar Baw.
The Share Market opened up very wobbly
this morning, owing to persistent rumours
that the works of Roulette et Cie., Twice Up
& Co., and the old Sarnmajor and Mudhook
Prop. Ltd., were being taken over by the
Government, and when in the afternoon the
rumours were confirmed by official notices,
there were indescribable scenes on 'change,
speculators clamouring madly to try and
save a little out of the wreck, and the bottom
was knocked clean out of the market.
♦ 4 <e>
House-building Mortgage Co. shares
went up in leaps and bounds on news of
important contracts with the Government
for the duration.
4 4- 4
Plymouth Brewers Prop. Ltd. dropped a

The market finished very unstable.
THE POET'S PLAINT.
4- 4- 4-
It's hard to enthuse on the joys of the Muse
When the ship's like a tipsy old Scot ;
The Poet who raves on the beauty of waves
Has been writing in some sheltered spot.
If CHILDE HAROLDE wrote on a wild
transport boat,
His travels, much would have been lack-
ing.
Perchance, though, he might have been able
to write
On the joys of the
" S.S. PORT HACKING."
4- ,4* 4
The orchestra sti-ives to bring to our lives
Successive melodious thrills.
With raucous-voiced cry, " Devil's Own,"
" Kelly's Eye ! "
The "house" fiend brings grist to his
mills.
The gramophone wails from its metal
entrails
The song of the voice that is bawling.
No cheerful-faced ass could possibly pass,
But must honor the office by calling.
4 4- 4
Could LONGFELLOW write in a flickering
light
That goes out ten times in an hour ?
A typewriter tapping and everyone yapping,
Would make even TENNYSON sour.
The Editor grows impolite, though he knows
This effort is hard. So I'll say
" Farewell ! " "Au revoir ! " The Muse
flows no more.
Yours—till the next issue—

Tuesday morning breaking fine, a few of
the lads had a try out at the Port Hacking
Stadium, and a series of six bouts were put
on by the Welter, Middle and Lightweights,
when some very interesting fights took
place, stouch being dealt out with an
earnestness and received with a good
humour that promises well for the trip.
4 4 4
The Sports Committee intend to put on a
series of competitions in the various classes,
leading up to the competition for the Cham-
pionship of the Boat.
IS IT TRUE ?
THAT the restrictions placed upon this
ship for exceeding the speed limit through
the Bay of Biscay has spoilt our chance of
putting up a record non-stop run to Aus-
tralia ?
4 4 4
THAT the extra sprint for a few days across
the Mediterranean was the Chief Engineer's
renewed effort to regain lost mileage ? Or
was it a dying flutter ?

with the boys, and added his little bit to the
mighty deep ?

OUR FIRST IMPROMPTU CONCERT.
4 4
ON Tuesday night the 10th inst., our
first concert was held at the 44 Hip-
podrome," main deck for'ard, when a
number of exceptional turns were put on by
the troops and members of the ship's com-
pany. As well as popular songs by good
singers, a good turn was given by Piper
Ross on the bag-pipes. A good ragtime
turn was followed by a Wild West show from
Wells and pardner, where the principal was
punctured with pins, etc., and his arm was
sewn to his neck, the turn finishing by
chewing glass and the eating of liquid fire
as if he liked it.
4 4 4
The singing of 44 God Save the King "
brought a very enjoyable evening to a close.
4- 4- 4
The ship's concert party, 44 The Medleys,"
assisted by our Symphony Orchestra, will
give a grand concert at an early date.
After the Shows—
Come and have a quiet drink at

TIRELESS TIDINGS.
THE GREAT WAR.
By Our Special War Correspondent.
(Pillip Fibbs.)
4- 4- 4
Press H.Q., 10-12-18.
On the morning of the eighth after a heavy
preliminary bombardment, the Codlin
Moths went over the top in three waves, to
the accompaniment of the drum-fire of the
Drop-shorts and gained all objectives. But
were driven out in the early morning by a
vigorous counter-attack of the Crow-
eaters .
4- 4 4
The whole front was very quiet during the
day, but just as dusk was falling, an unfor-
tunate incident happened through a mistake
of the Crow-eaters' H.Q information be-
ing sent to the companies in support and on
either flank of Captain Phosgene's Coy.,
that a raid was taking place and to take no
notice of the increased rate of fire. Just as
Phossie's company was preparing for the
stunt, the Codlin Moths made a vigorous
counter attack and Phossie's company
suffered severe casualties, including one
ear bitten right through, so Phosgene asked
for an armistice to bury his dead —which
was granted by the Codlin Moths after
payment of cigarettes all round.

At a late hour last night a wild-eyed indi-

strips of canvas round both legs (which were
limewashed) rushed into our sanctum.

IT was the official opening day for Aus-
tralia House. King George did the
opening act in fine style. Billy Hughes
and Andy Fisher were his chief supporters
on the platform. But did you see the
"Aussies " who formed the Guard of
Honour ? Every man bronzed by the sun
of Egypt, beaten by the winds of Gallipoli—
bitten by the frosts of France.

Each man knew his job that day and did
it like the man he was ; they watched the
" Performance " with immovable features,
impervious alike to the comments or cheers
of the London crowd. They stood rigid in
the rain ; they made no sign when a pale
English sun peeped through the sullen
clouds ; they were some soldiers !
Then the Aussie on the Strand thrilled
that day as he watched his chosen comrades
come to attention as one man.

PART I.
TO look into the unknown and to search
in the interest of Science and Explora-
tion, the whaler "Aurora," with a
party composed chiefly of Australians,
under the leadership of Sir Douglas
Mawson, set out from Hobart on December
2nd, 1911.
Our objects were : (1) To determine the
nature and extent (as far as was within our
means) of that part of the great Antarctic
Continent lying immediately south of Aus-
tralia ; (2) To make soundings, collect
specimens and correct any geographical
errors which might crop up during our
voyages in those unknown waters.
4 4- 4>
Our first port of call was Macquarie
Island, which is situated about 950 miles
south-east of Tasmania. Here we were to
erect a wireless station and leave a party
of scientists for the study of the fauna (which
is very prolific on this island), to make a
topographical survey, and to keep in touch
with both the mainland and southern party,
so that the meteorological records, etc.,
could be sent to Australia.
<s> > 4-
This place is ideally situated for purposes
meteorologically affecting both Australia
and New Zealand.
I may state that when the expedition was
disbanded, this station was taken over by
the two governments and was continued
until war broke out.
Macquarie Island up to the present has
been used for collecting sea elephant and
penguin oil, but I believe in the near future
it will be made a National Preserve, as the
the world, and it is only by taking this
measure that the future study of these inter-
esting specimens will be possible.
To erect a Wireless Station presented a
great many difficulties, as the only suitable
place was on a hill 400 feet high, situated at
the northern end of the island. We were
fortunate in finding an aerial ropeway which
had been used by the men working on the
island for transporting the sea elephant
blubber to the trying-out sheds, as it is
impossible to use a boat during the greater
part of the year, owing to extremely bad
weather.
4» 4- 4>
After a great amount of exertion the heavy
machinery and masts were hauled to the
top of the hill, but not before we had dropped
one of the dynamos (luckily it was not
smashed too badly to be repaired). This
station has since worked djrect with Port
Moresby, a distance of 3,400 miles, which
constitutes a world's record for a 2 kilo-
watt station.
4- 4- 4>
During the time we were ashore (ten
days), the ship, while cruising about, was
unfortunate enough to strike a sunken rock,
which in the succeeding days necessitated
the use of the pump to a much greater ex-
tent than would have been necessary in
ordinary circumstances, but we were out
for excitement, and a little thing like the
ship taking in water at the rate of 11 inches
an hour was nothing to us, but must have
caused a great deal of anxiety to the worthy
master of the ship.
4- 4> 4-
Our good-bye was taken on Xmas Day,
1911, from Macquarie Island, by having to
warp the ship off the rocks at a place called
bird and mammal life, of which this island Caroline Cove, where we had put in to sup-
abounds, is fast dying out in other parts of plement our water supply.

part of our trip. The members of the ex-
pedition were put into watches to help the
crew, and what with hauling on ropes,
furling sails, etc., we had our time very
much occupied.
❖ 4>
One of the amusing sights on the ship was
to watch the sledge dogs being fed. For the
benefit of those who do not know what these
dogs are like, I will try and describe them.
In looks they resemble a collie, with a head
like a wolf and covered with very thick hair.
Their nature is very much like a wolf in the
way that their hair bristles when they are
angry, and they will fight among them-
selves at the least opportunity. Woe betide
the one that goes down in the melee, as it is
sure to be killed if steps are not promptly
taken to stop the fight. It is inadvisable
for a person to interfere with bare hands (a
log of wood is much better) as the dogs are
quite impartial as long as they see some-
thing to bite at.
4- 4-
A pack of these dogs always has a recog-
nised leader, and if food is placed before
them, and he anywhere about, they always
defer to him and let him have the first share.
If by chance one makes a slip and puts his
nose into the bucket first, it will be promptly
put in its place by the said leader. These
dogs do not bark, but make a mournful
howl.
The food for the dogs varies, of course, in
different places. We rely chiefly on seal
and a quarter pound's weight, and heated
over the stove, so as to drive off the moisture
and also to reduce the bulk. The weight per
piece is about one pound after this heating,
and one lump is generally given twice a day
to each dog.
<s> <s> <s>
Of course these rations are for sledging
journeys only. When at the base the dogs
have the scraps from the hut, and they
generally have as much as they can eat of
seal meat to finish up with. There are
various ways of harnessing them to sledges,
but the two methods usually employed are
the Fan and Tandem formation. Their
harness consists of a collar similar to that
used on horses, and a girth to keep the
collar on. The tug-rope is fastened to the
collar.
4> 4> 4>
It is estimated that eight dogs can haul as
much as three men, and are much faster on
an ordinary surface, but, when in bad
country, a man-hauled sledge wins easily.
4 4- 4'
A great deal of controversy has arisen
among different explorers whether dogs
are efficient or not, but I think that the
remarkable trip of Amundsen to the
South Pole with dogs proves conclusively
that dogs properly used are the best means
of transporting sledges.

POST-WAR PROBLEMS.
By L. V. Worle.
No. 2 —"THE TIMBER INDUSTRY"
HOW many of us have ever thought of
the wonderful resources of timber
that are growing in Australia,
only waiting to be tackled in a businesslike
manner to grow into one of our greatest
wealth-producing industries ? We have
extensive forests of what is acknowledged
to be, by all experts, absolutely the finest
timbers in the world. Hardwoods there are
especially, as well as soft woods and fancy
timbers with the most beautiful grain it is
possible to see—suitable for the manufac-
ture of the finest furniture and the inside
work of the builder.
<£> <s>
These forests are, in many cases, being
burnt to clear some settler's holdings, or
for firewood (I have actually seen this).
The whole trouble has been that public
opinion still sticks to that old fallacy of the
imported goods being the best, and of the
premature working of the timber, i.e., not
seasoning the woods before using them in
the various manufactures.
That is one of our most important duties
on return—to convert public feeling towards
our home products. Now just take a look
at what other countries are doing. Cali-
fornia, U.S.A., on cutting down her own
forests, is re-afforesting with Australian
hardwoods. Italy and South Africa are also
planting them as fast as they can grow the
seedlings—having Government nurseries
for the purpose. What are we doing ? Just
cutting down the trees indiscriminately and
trusting to Providence for them to grow
again, thus throwing away one of our most
valuable assets. Look what has happened
during the war. The Allied countries have
had to scrape to meet the extra demand
made on the world's timber supply by the
war -even felling the finest old trees in some
of the historical parks of England for the
purpose. So you can see, when the building
and other industries return to their former
prosperity and activity and start to make
up for lost time, that the world's supply is
not going to meet the demand .
4- 4> 4-
So we want to get busy as soon as we get
home and make it our business to see that
the Government do take notice of these
forests of ours and their possibilities and

get a comprehensive scheme of re-afforesta-
tion going and provide the necessary trans-
port facilities so that we can compete in the
world's markets and supply the extraor-
dinary demands that will be made on the
timber supply of the world in the near future.
Otherwise we will have vested interests
from other countries coming in and jumping
our claims.
We know now that only a few months ago
a big foreign corporation was trying to
obtain a hold on the best of Australia's
timber reserves, including the jarrah
forests of Western Australia, by getting
long term concessions. Surely, if it is worth
their while to spend time and money on
working up our timber industry, it is worth
our while to exploit them ourselves and
keep the forests in our own hands, thus
making the v/hole industry as it should be—
a purely Australian concern, run by Aus-
tralians for the good of our young country.
PURSUIT OF A PIANO AT
PORT SAID.
We had great difficulty in the early stages
of our voyage with having only one piano on
board. Our Orchestra would be wanting to
practise, and find it was being used by the
Concert Party, and vice versa, so our
popular Y.M.A.G. Rep., Mr. Sims, made up
his mind that at the first port we touched,
he would beg, buy, borrow, or steal the
second one.
4- 4- 4-
As soon as we touched Port Said, he and
our popular Padre went over the side in
search of one, and the necessary music, and
Mr. Sims, after putting in a good tale, was
given an old one by the Y.M.C.A. Rep. at
Port Said,,and he then went after the music
and some new piano wires.
The day being a public holiday, all
business places were closed ; but with the
persistence of a tail-bettor, following up a
trot, he rushed around to the private house
of one of the proprietors of a music ware-
house, but the boss was out, and his wife
could only speak Gippo, and our Y.M.C.A.
bloke English, but after much gesticulation
and glad eye stunts, he was able to explain
himself and was sent to where they thought
the Boss was.
The bird had flown, but with the assist-
ance of the usual small boy he started off
again and luckily met his man, grabbed
him and took him to shop and then carried
him off to the ship as a prisoner to tune the
old piano up.
In the meantime our Padre had got the
piano down to the wharf and aboard a small
rowing boat, and at last came into view
sitting astride and doing a balancing feat
that would have opened the eyes of Cinque-
valli, and with great excitement brought it
alongside, where the best feat of the, show
was done ; one nigger back-watered and
the other pulled hard and the Padre did the
Gaby Glide to perfection, pulling up and
steadying just in time to save himself and
the piano from a watery grave, and landed
it on deck to the accompaniment of the
cheers and laughter of the boys.
But our thanks are due to the hard work
and persistence of these two gentlemen in
trying to help us.
4- <s>
We now have two pianos and the work of
the Concert Party and Orchestra can carry
on independently, to their great satisfaction
and the pleasure of the troops on board.
SHOCKS AND STARES.

PORT Said Distillers Coy. dropped with a
bump, owing to official notice of the pro -
hibition of sales of whisky, etc., by bum •
boats to ships passing through the port.
House-building Mortgage Co. shares fell
a few points, owing to no business being
done lately.

The Treacle Zero Financial Corporation
floated the company during the week, but
we advise our readers to look well into the
prospectus before investing. They seem to
be asking a lot from their shareholders,
with no possibliity of a return for their
money for some considerable time.

ANANIAS.
The boys sat round and discussed such
things
As whizz-bangs—and Blighty—and rum.
They talked of sheep-farming and murders,
and kings,
—Accompanied by Gotha's dull hum.
"A townie " held forth on a wallaby hunt.
(He'd never been into the Bush)
A cocky spoke long on a " Guv'ment House
stunt,"
Referring to that " Toorak Push ! "
4 4 4
A red chevron man spoke of Courtney's and
Quinn's,
Another one mentioned the Strand,
They drifted through Millsies to Tickler's
jam tins,
And things that we all understand.
They argued on Paris and Nimitybell,
On thistles and prickly pear.
A Gumsucker reckoned that 44 Darwin was
hell ! "
He'd an uncle who'd visited there !
Then up rose a man who had just come to
light.
They listened—his words seemed to stun.
Then rose in a body and murdered the wight
And chuckled and laughed when they'd
done.
A corporal spoke, " We have wrought a
good work,
In slaying this Kangaroo rat,
You all heard the words of this son of a Turk,
' I've never yet SEEN a live chat'."

fTAHE Sports Committee started the ball
rolling last Saturday by opening the
season with a Grand Skipping Compe-
tition, which was held on the Port Hacking
Sports Ground, main deck, for'ard. All the
Inter-State champions took part, and a
good afternoon's sport ended in Victoria
gaining the coveted honour of Premier
State by taking Ist, 3rd and sth prizes.
N.S.W. put up the best individual perform-
ance, in Lester doing 1467 on a single break.

Ron. Wells (Vic.), of Wild West fame,
won in a canter with 2231 ; Lester (N.S.W.)
came second with 1764 ; Gunn (Vic.) get-
ting third place with 1453 ; Roscoe (W.A.)
came fourth with 1376, and Powell (Vic.)
fifth, with 1031.

The prizes were presented to the winners
by the Padre, Capt. Redhead, at the concert

"TT 7~ EEN interest was centred in the con-
test between Ron. Wells (Australia),
the champion " Magsman " of Vic.,
and Fireman Ellis (England). Both looked
fairly fit, but Wells appeared about 141bs.
heavier than the Fireman. The bout was to
be six two-minute rounds.
4 4 4
Round 1. —Wells went after his man from
the gong and after a few exchanges, Ellis
retreated to the ropes, showing a tendency
to stay there and smother. Wells ripped a
few body punches in and appeared much too
strong for Ellis.

appeared very tired. Wells connected to
the chin just as the gong went.

Round V. -Wells led off with a heavy left
to the head and followed with lefts and rights
to the body. It was plain to see that Wells
was too rugged for his opponent, and the
claret was flowing freely from Ellis' nose
and mouth. Wells connected to the point
and the Fireman went down for eight. At
the end of this round the towel was thrown
in from the Fireman's corner.

TIRELESS TIDINGS.

THE INTERSTATE WAR.
4 4 4
A Great Victoria.
AFTER an exceptionally heavy bom-
bardment the Cornstalks'lst Army ,
under General Kelly, went over the
top in the faint light of dawn and advanced
a short distance, but in a brilliantly executed
counter-attack the Croweaters, under
General Phosgene, drove them back to a
depth of fifteen yards on a fifty yard front.
4 4 4
The Cornstalks put up a splendid fight in
their reserve lines in heavy hand-to-hand
fighting, but could not stop the victorious
rush of the Croweaters, so five divisions of
the Codlin-moths were thrown into sup-
ports. But still the advance continued, the
Croweaters capturing a nine-inch gun and
numerous field-pieces.
4 4 4
With the aid of two more Codlin-moth
divisions coming round in a brilliant flank-
ing movement, the rush of the Croweaters
was stopped. In some of the wild melees,
after heavy street fighting, even the stret-
cher-bearers and pioneers took a hand. By
this time the Cornstalks, under Kelly, had
re-organised and moved up, and put in
good work mopping up trenches and clean-
ing up dug-outs.
■4 4 4
The Croweaters, with Phozzie in com-
mand, again and again threw in new divi-
sions to gain a decision, but the fighting
still see-sawed and the streets were as
shambles. Bringing up their last reserves,
they bombarded the enemy with liquid fire
and gas. Their low-flying 'planes flew over
the enemy, doing great execution with their
waddies and boomerangs ; but General
Treacle, with his gallant Bananalanders,
moved up from supports and drove the
Croweaters back past their original line.
During the fight, Phozzie's cigarette dump
was destroyed by incendiary shell-fire.
Our war correspondent was wounded in the
early stages of the battle, but was able to
carry on until the end.
The Gumsuckers, who were neutral, have
now joined the Allies. The Sand-gropers
were out resting at Le Sharp End and after
recuperating will take part in the coming
battle.
MUSIC AND MELODY.
By Viola.
4 4 4
OUR second Concert was held on
Saturday, the 14th inst., at the
Hippodrome, and was a huge
success.
A number of good turns were put on,
including a couple of good songs by our
popular Y.M.C.A. representative, Mr. Sims,
and he received a great ovation. Murphy,
with his inimitable Irish songs, was very
popular with the large audience, but the
star turn of the evening was a burlesque of
the Johnson-Burns World's Championship
Fight, by Ron. Wells and Cpl. Sherriff
(Johnson). The big black hit, kicked and
bit the little white fellow through five
rounds. Rafferty's rules were allowed
right from the start. Tammy went down
for eight once and, taking a surreptitious
drink while the referee was counting and
the nigger sitting on his second's knee,
blew the water into his opponent's face on
resuming. In the fifth round, J. J. knocked
Tammy clean out of the ring and sat down
and waited for him. When Tammy got
back he " jobbed " all within reach, but was
too late and again lost the Belt. The turn
was uproariously applauded by the crowd.
4 4 4
After this turn our popular Padre, Capt.
Redhead, presented the prizes won at the
skipping competition. Making a pleasant
little speech he announced that Wells wished
to hand the first prize back for re-competi-
tion as a sporting offer by a good sport, but
he was persuaded to take what he had won.
4 4 4
Unfortunately, at this juncture the rain
came down in torrents and the concert had
to be continued down on the Troop deck.
After a number of good songs, this most
enjoyable evening was brought to a close
by the singing of " God Save the King."

task was comparatively easy as the poison-

the Limburger magazine remained intact.
As she drew alongside, great rolls of
barbed wire were swung over the side, down
which the gallant crew speedily slipped.
Then the knives (jack, with lanyard—the
most modern weapon in the armament of
the nations) were brought into play upon the
steel plates of the German. In a very few
hours a cavity was made large enough to
admit two men, who immediately raised
steam and brought her into the British
lines, where she was moored to a 5.9 dud.
In the meantime the main German fleet was
forced to retire fully eighteen inches, and,
its speed being inferior to our vessels, it was
soon in a very critical position.

" Four years and a quarter ago I left a
wife and four children to come into the
struggle."
" My poor fellow ! " we broke in, " and
now you weep because you are returning to
them ? "
A reproachful glance told us that we had
misjudged our man.
"Yes ! " continued he ; " the finest
family in the most beautiful State in Aus-
tralia ! "
As we are from that State, our hand went
out in comradeship, but his next words
shattered the illusion.
"I am from Western Australia. x Kal-
goorlie is my home town. . . . And sitting
here, looking across this lovely sand, a great
wave of homesickness came over me, till
my eyes were blinded and my heart broke."
Sadly we turned away, for who could
comfort a Sand-groper, homesick in the
Suez ?
SAND AND SORROW.
Whilst all aboard were admiring the
evolutions of the air-men on Wednesday
morning, as the ship was passing through
the Canal, we were gazing from the Edi-
torial sanctum, when our eyes fell on a
mournful digger seated on a bollard, gazing
sadly across the desert and weeping silently.
With our usual quick sympathy, and pos-
sibly with the hope that he had in some way
managed to reach the cargo, we went across
to enquire the trouble. After some urging,
our melancholy friend dried his tears and
unburdened his soul.

Being stone motherless, I couldn't accept
the gentle hint, so I left our friend with the

I strolled across to interview our old friend
of many a morning after, the Starboard

I explained to the Editor that I was unable
to supply the goods, but he would not give
me a hearing at all, so I walked out still
suffering from Bassitls—which translated
into pure Aussie means not enough Bass
germs to make life worth living—and gave
up the Ghost. I then lay me down in a quiet
corner of the deck and forgot all about the
paper and its articles by going promptly off
to sleep.
OPEN-AIR IMPROMPTU
CONCERTS.
4 4
During the week impromptu concerts
were held on every night for which no
regular programme had been arranged.
The troops and members of the ship's
company assisted with items, and most
enjoyable evenings were spent, some ex-
ceptionally good talent being found among
the diggers.
4 4- 4
The Orchestra generously assisted and
with all hands joining in the choruses the
evenings passed pleasantly.
4 4 4
We hope the same spirit—of helping each
other in the entertainment and amusement
of ourselves and the crew—will keep to the
same high standard of good-fellowship
until the end of this—our last voyage as
soldiers on a troopship.

PART 2.
SHORTLY after leaving Macquarrie
Island the preparations were com-
menced to equip a sledging party
ready to put off at a moment's notice, in case
we discovered any land, or to make a journey
with a piece of wood about three feet long
coming up from each runner at an angle of
60 degrees, and they are joined by a piece of
wood which allows the the team to
have some control over the sledge. Whenjit
XMAS IN THE ANTARCTIC.
over the ice should the situation warrant it.
A great deal of detail has to be studied in the
preparation for such a trip, so I will enu-
merate the main things that are required.
First is the sledge, which consists of two
runners of hickory or ash, 12 feet long by
4 inches wide, about f-inch thick, curved up
at each end and joined together at one end
is man-hauled, the necessity for this steer-
ing bar does not often occur. Tenented into
each of the runners are short pieces of wood,
9 inches high and morticed on these are
narrow strips, or stringers, as they are
called. These stringers have cross pieces
fastened to them, and the combination of
stringers and cross pieces form the platform

on which the load is carried. All fastenings
are made with greenhide, as metal would
soon crystalize in the intense cold. You can
understand how important it is to have
good sledges, when I tell you that they have
to carry a load of 1200 pounds weight, and
that if a breakdown occurs, a big distance
from the base, disaster will very likely over-
take the party.
4- 4-
The next thing to be considered is the
tent. This is made from very light Wil-
lesden canvas and is erected on five bamboo
sticks, like an Indian wigwam. The en-
trance is round and has a piece sewn on to
it in the form of a cylinder about three feet
long, and this can be tied up to prevent any
snow from drifting in. The bottom edge of
the tent has a flange about 18 inches wide —
on this, blocks of snow or ice are packed
to keep the tent down. The tent is made to
accommodate three men sitting down, and a
pretty tight squeeze it is when you have the
Nansen Cooker, food, clothes and sleeping
bags inside with you. The sleeping bags
are made from reindeer skin with the fur
inside, and resemble in shape an Egyptian
mummy case. They are difficult to sleep in
for the first few times owing to the lack of
air, as no part of the body is showing, but
one soon gets used to the feeling, and when
it is very cold you would swear that a gale of
wind was blowing through it.
<&> 4- 4-
The Nansen Cooker was designed by the
famous explorer, Dr. Nansen, when he made
his dash for the North Pole. It consists of
four pieces—central boiler, ring boiler,
outside case and cover. It is heated by a
Primus stove, and one gallon of kerosene
will cook for four men for a period of ten
days. The food consists of Pemmican
(30 per cent, dried meat, 70 per cent. fat).
This, in conjunction with ground-up biscuits
and water, makes the famous Hoosh (some
dish) ; biscuits, tea, sugar, dried milk,
chocolate, butter, raisins and almonds
complete the list.
With regard to clothing, our expedition
relied chiefly on Jaeger woollens and bur-
berries. The hands being covered by mit-
tens and Wolfskin gloves with the fur out-
side, and the feet by Finnesko, made from
reindeer skin, also with the fur outside.
These are bound on to the feet with lengths
of lamp wick. The only change of clothing
you have is socks. The spare clothing
carried is put on when you get into your
sleeping bag. It's not like, in the Antarctic,
because you do not take your clothes off
when you go to bed, but put more on.
The sledge belts (for hauling the sledge)
are made from canvas and are about 6 inches
wide, with cross shoulder straps, and ter-
minate with a short length of Alpine rope,
which in turn is fastened to the sledge rope
by means of a toggle and eye. A mast is
added to the sledge and the floor cloth of the
tent can be rigged up as a sail when the wind
is fair. It is also used as a flagpole when you
leave it behind to mark a food depot. As
every pound of extra gear carried means so
much less food, a great deal of re-arrange-
ment and cutting down of weight takes
place before the leader passes the load as
fit.
Well, we fixed this matter up 0.K., and
as the days wore on and the temperature
began to drop, we knew that we must soon
begin to see ice. About 4 o'clock one after-
noon, a shout from the lookout announced
the fact that ice was in sight, and at 6 o'clock
we were alongside our first iceberg.
It was not very big (about a quarter of a
mile square), but to us who hadn't seen
anything bigger than that which you buy for
fivepence a block, it was magnificent. The
Antarctic icebergs are different from the
ones in the North, inasmuch as they are
always flat topped, being formed by succes-
sive layers of snow, whereas the Arctic
icebergs are composed of true glacier ice

THE season was continued on Saturday
the 20th, when the inter-state scratch
pull was decided in which all the inter-
state strong men took part and some great
contests took place. Each event was keenly
contested.
RESULTS OF FINALS.
Heavyweights.
After a gruelling contest in the semi-
finals against a much heavier man, Padre
Redhead put up a great pull ; he pulled his
opponent, Cpl. Geiger, straight up, but
in the second pull it was a great struggle 4
both men straining every muscle to gain
the verdict, but the Padre managed to
outstay the big Corporal and pulled him
over the mark to the hearty cheers of the
big crowd of spectators, giving first leg to
N.S.W.
Lightweights.
Cpl. Keogh pulled Pte. McKenzie straight
over in the first pull, but in the second had a
much tougher job, but hanging on well he
gave a good heave and pulled his man over
again, and giving a second leg in to N.S.W.,
making a certainty of the premiership.
Middleweights.
Garsed (Vic.) pulled Davies (Vic.) in the
finals and appeared much too strong for his
opponent, pulling him over in two straight
heaves.
Our Sporting Padre and Cpl. Geiger
officiated as Ground Stewards in their
usual able manner.

The Sporting season was continued on
Christmas Day, when pillow fights on the
greasy pole were indulged in at the swim-
ming pond, main deck, aft.
A most hilarious and amusing afternoon's
sport was enjoyed, some of the turns would
have made the greatest of pessimists smile
and the acrobatic feats performed made the
spectators rock with uproarious laughter.
The star turn of the day was the series of
bouts between Sgt. Macfarland (Queens-
land) and J. Powell (Victoria Ist D.H.Q.)
for the championship. In the first bout
Powell knocked his man over and with the
force of his own blow knocked himself
round, but managed to hang on and win.
4 4- 4
The second bout both men hit hard and
fell together, wild swiping went on from an
inverted position, but neither* could gain the
verdict.
4> <s> 4>
After a rest, they continued, and Treacle
knocked his man into the usual upside
down position, and with great strategy
waited until his man came over the top to
regain his position, when a heavy swipe
made him continue the circle, much to the
amusement of the spectators, and honors
were easy again.
4 4 4
In the final, Powell got on to his man and
toppled him over and by continuous belting
stopped him from getting to the right side
again. He kept on playing havoc with
Treacle's binghy, until at last he knocked
him off and won the championship. The
efforts of Treacle to get on top nearly sent
the crowd into hysterics
MUSIC AND MELODY.

THE " Medleys " costume concert
party opened their tour of the Port
Hacking circuit on Saturday, the
20th inst., at the " Palladium," main deck,
aft, under the capable management of
S.-Sgt. Odgers.
4 4 4
The Symphony Orchestra opened the
programme with a medley of popular tunes.
Mr. Nathaniel, one of the ship's engineers,
sang the " Deathless Army " in a pleasing
manner.
<s> 4- <s>
The " Medleys " then gave a concerted
turn, " Comrades," and this their first
performance in public, showed that great
judgment had been used in selecting the
voices, the performance being very credit-
able and was well received by the large
audience.
4- 4> 4
The female impersonator, S.-Sgt. Yates,
was exceptionally popular, his make-up
being perfect. As an encore they gave us
" Sing us an Aussie Song," a topical turn
full of bright gags.
<S> 4-
W. O. MacLauchlan recited " The Yukon
Trail " —there was an artistic finish about
the rendering that puts Mac in the forefront
as an artist of great dramatic ability and for
an en core he gave that old favourite," Gunga
Din."
4- 4 4
Pte. Jackson sang "Asleep in the Deep,"
with a will and has a powerful bass voice.
4 4 4
Cpl. Matthews played the popular Inter-
mezzo from " Cavalieria Rusticana."
4 4 4
The fair maid, Miss P. J. Yates, then
sang " If you look in her Eyes," in a way
that gladdened the hearts of the diggers in
the orchestra stalls.
4 4 4
The musical monologue " Oh ! Memory,"
by W. P. Odgers, was an exceptionally fine
character sketch, and he gave as an encore
the bush sketch "Destiny," in fine style.
During the interval the orchestra played a
pot pourri of popular melodies.
4 4 4
Sgt. Bassett sang " Mother Machree."
In the duet "Absent," by Privates Trundle
and Jackson, the blending of the voices was
good.
4 4 4
Then our popular and versatile Y.M.C.A.
Rep., Mr. Sims, sang "An Emblem."
4 4 4
The comedy musical turn by Odgers and
Wilson was very good.

" The Bells of St. Marys" was sung

Featherweights.
L.-Cpl. Roscoe v. Cpl. Gunn, (Vic.)
Ist round.—Roscoe led off and rushed his
man, scoring frequently with the right, and
Gunn had hard work trying to keep his end
up, though he fought well, but Roscoe
seemed too rugged, and was scoring per-
sistently with his right throughout the
round.

2nd round.—Roscoe bored in and it was
easily to be seen he was looking for a knock-
out, and though Gunn did well in the
clinches, Roscoe connected to the head with
a stinging right and he then just seemed to
measure his man and put in a terrific right
followed by a left and Gunn dropped to the
boards, and though he gamefy tried to get
on his feet, took the count, and Roscoe was
declared the winner.
Heavyweights.
Pte. Nelson (12-4) v.L.Cpl.Hattrick (12-6).
Ist round. —The round opened with
Nelson scoring to the head and Hattrick
replied to the body ; Nelson put in a good
body punch and connected with a wild right
swing to the side of the jaw, and although
the round was stopped whilst Hattrick's
gloves were changed, he never recovered
and seemed too dazed to even smother and

THE preliminary competitions for the
championship of the Port Hacking in
the various classes opened on Monday,
23rd inst., when the opening bouts of the
Feather and Heavyweights were decided,
under trying climatic conditions. Results :
Nelson just knocked him about as he liked»
but could not administer the knock-out
blow.
❖ <s>
2nd round.—Hattrick opened out as if he
had fully recovered, and scored frequently
to the body and head, when Nelson got home
in the same spot as before with a right swing
which seemed to paralyze Hattrick. He then
just belted until he dropped and the towel
was thrown in from Hattrick's corner.

The championship boxing competitions
were continued before a large crowd, on
Thursday, at the Stadium, when one of the
best exhibitions of the tournament was
contested between McVinish and Musgrove,
the contest being fast and clean and both
lads fought like champions.
Results :
Welterweights.
Fireman Ellis (England) fought a bye with
Cpl. Geiger (W.A.).

Musgrove, Ist A.S.C., N.S.W. (9.6).
Ist round.—The round opened with some
fast exchanges, with McVinish getting a
little the better of them, but Musgrove
evened matters with some fast long-range
work, and honors were easy.

2nd round.-- Musgrove scored in quick
succession with the left to head, Mac con-
nected with right ; Musgrove made two bad
misses, and Mac followed in fast, and piled

3rd round. —Musgrove fought steadier
and left the wild swings alone, and was
forging ahead when Mac put in some bril-
liant work and scored freely ; the round was
fast and clever, Mac just getting a little the
better of it.

4th round.—Musgrove connected with

WRESTLING.
By Smackanhit.
During the week all the interstate
wrestlers have been training solidly, the
mat being available every morning and
afternoon, through the active assistance
lent by the ship's bosun, and no words of
ours can express the feelings of the men on
board at the ready help always given by this
gentleman in the interest of all sports on
this ship. It is to be hoped that a wrestling
competition will be promoted in the various
classes, as there are a number of promising
lads on board and they are all looking fit.
DEBATING SOCIETY.
The Society held their first meeting on
Saturday, 20th, when the discussion was
whether a White Australian policy should
be maintained.
Padre Redhead's team, Sgts. Possingham
Jarrett and Worle, took the affirmative,
Mr. Sims' team, Sgt. Sherringham, W. O.
McLauchlan, Pte. McCutcheon, the nega-
tive, this great problem being discussed
from every point of view. The work was
continued on Friday the 27th, when a com-
petition of impromptu speeches was carriecj
out, and some interesting lights were
thrown on the various subjects under dis-
cussion. The prize-winners were Pte.
Datson, A.M.G., Ist., Sgt. Hannam, Corps
H.Q., 2nd., Sgt. Sherringham, sth A.F.A.,
3rd. The prizes will be presented at the
concert on Saturday night.

The next debate will be held on Tuesday
next, the subject being that interesting
drink problem, whether we should have
Total Prohibition or not in Australia.
THE DAY AFTER.
By A Perfect Day.
ON Boxing Day there was a great stunt
at the Stadium, two diggers who
had apparently had a couple of
tee-total cobbers at their table, deciding to
have a friendly spar.
4 4
Lightweights.
44 Komic Style," 18 stone, 4 bottles of Bass
and a horse-shoe
" Ed. McGoherty," 6 stones, 211b5., 44 ozs.,
9 drachms (of Scotch) and a piece of
hard luck.
The round opened with some great ring-
craft, " Komic " performing some great
footwork, when his toe caught in a seam,
and very, very mixed exchanges followed ;
they let loose to Rafferty's rules the Referee
having great difficulty in separating them
and dodging the lefts and rights aimed at
him. They showed us the greatest variety
of hits ever seen in a ring, uppercuts, cross-
cuts and under-cuts, swings, merry-go-
rounds, see-saws, right crosses, Victoria
crosses and wooden crosses being mixed up
in an indescribable whirl ; then 44 Mc-
Goherty " went to the boards and as he rose
"Komic" smote him with his shoe, inci-
dentally forgetting to fake his foot out of it,
and the round closed midst the cheers of the
large crowd.
The second round opened quietly, but they
soon warmed to their work and plied each
other with half nelsons, Lord Nelsons,
strangle holds, ship's holds, left hooks,
coat hooks, hat hooks, fish hooks, mud-
hooks and bunches of uppercuts, 44 Mc-
Goherty " again going to the boards, but
44 Komic " wasn't satisfied and went down
after him and carried on with the good
work. When at last they staggered to their
feet they made feeble efforts to knock each
other out, but were too exhausted to carry
on, and the contest was declared a draw and
postponed for a hundred years.
4 4 4
44 Komic " announced at the finish that
44 McGoherty " was the best boxer, but not
good enough for him.
4 4 4
Spud Murphy, of s.s. Benalla, refereed,
when he didn't have his eyes blocked by the
contestants' gloves.

TALL TALES ABOUT
TRAIN TRAVELLING.
By Treacle.
4- 4- 4
"""■ "\ID you ever see that express from
§ Boulogne to Paris ? " says the
Bananalander. " Talk about flash
trains, it was a
beauty ! The inside '
was done up like our
Skipper when he //
hopped into that
whitesuit." "Yes," I
says N.S.W., "but
that's nothing to the
Sydney to Mel-
bourne Express. It
has a carriage made
entirely of glass,
and everything one
could wish for—even
a swimming bath-
mixed bathing al-
lowed, too ! "
" What! " says
Bananalander.
"Yes ! " put in Billo
from Victoria. " The
water then runs into
the second class, and
after to the third
~ Bert, did you?"
class all for use .. No Look behind you ,
respectively!"
" Then," chips in N.S.W., " the dirty water
is bottled up and sent to you Bananalanders
to drink on festive occasions." " That's a
good-ee ! " says Queensland. " But you
want to see our railways. From the en-
gineering point of view, that railway from
Cairns to Atherton can't be beat in Australia
or America. It's built on such a steep grade
that they carry sentries to watch out for
landslips, so that the enginedriver can pull
back his joy-stick and leap any obstacles—
and that requires flying speed and up-hill,
too ! One day the engine got loose at Barron
Falls and on its own went right to Towns-
ville—73 miles. —It was so used to hopping
over obstacles that it cleared the dead end
on the Townsville wharf and landed at
Magnetic Island—seven miles out ! " Of
course, it was magnetic attraction carried
it quarter of the way, but its speed was
XMAS 1918 AT SEA.
Didn t notice any Brandy Sauce on the Duff,
marvellous I " " That's nothing," says the
Cornstalk. "While you're talking about
speed, did you ever hear how I lost my tart,
and not over an express train either, but a
troop train ? " "No ! " says Queensland.
" Well, when I left Sydney for Melbourne
with the mob, the whistle blew and I put my
head out to kiss my tart, but, too late ! too
late ! The guard's flag tore her head off! "
"That must have been a shock, Bill!"
"Yes, I haven't
- spoken to a tart
since."

Billo from Vic-
toria then told his
yarn : When he was
travelling to Mel-
bourne from Sydney
next door to him
was a newly married
couple—of course
each compartment
was separated by
their partition only
—this conversation
was heard : Lady :
" Darling, I should
like some fresh air,
how will I know our
compartment
again ? " " I'll
leave my foot stick-
ing out the end, my
love," replied the hubby. The bride stayed
away some time, so he poked his head out
and there was a line of feet sticking out all
along the corridor ! '
OUR GUN IN ACTION ON
THE HIGH SEA.
By Old Dropshot.
4 4 4
Our Naval men tried their hands at
practice with their new gun to-day, and
after a couple of trial shots, had a go at the
target, and upheld naval traditions in a
good shoot, going close enough to make it
uncomfortable for any submarine if it
happened to be the target.

SHOCKS AND STARES.
By Lonar Baw.
♦ 4> .
A PROSPECTUS—an artistic modifi-
cation in mauve, bound with helio-
trope ribbon, and bearing an im-
posing title, has come to hand during the
week. Here is an excerpt:—
" A company is to be formed, to be called
4 The Feline and Rodent Production Com-
pany,' for the purpose of breeding cats for
their skins.
<s> 4-
" The present market price of catskins is :
Tabby, Is. 3d. ; Tortoiseshell, 2s. ; Black,
2s. 6d. ; Persian, 4s.
" It is proposed to purchase 2000 acres of
sand country in West Australia for £4 3s. 4d.
On to 1000 acres of this will be introduced
12,000 cats of assorted varieties, which
should produce 2500 skins per month
without further expenditure than that of
killing (the most difficult task) and skinning.
4- 4
" But it may be pointed out —and rightly,
too that 12,000 cats will take some feeding.
❖ 4- 4-
14 It has been estimated that a cat will eat
four rats for one day.
4- <s> ♦
44 We stock the remaining 1000 acres with
rats with which to feed the cats.
4- 4> 4-
44 So that the cats eat the rats —the rats
eat the cats, and the F.R.P. Company col-
lects the skins of each as its profits."
4- ■s>
This appears to us to be a genuine gilt
edged investment, which we would recom-
mend to our readers, more especially as the
company's offices are situated in Young and
Jackson's Building, Flinders and Swanston
Streets, Melbourne.

TO AN EMPTY FRIEND.

O Dead Marine, with gloossy sheen
Upon thy soft, translucent green !
Where is the joy that lay between
Those sides ? Where is the rale potheen
That was to pangs of life, morphine ;
That gave to all, enjoyment keen ;
That, like a drink from Gunga Din,
Brought life, where dull despair had been ;
That made a street girl seem a queen
More beauteous than had e'er been seen —
Like 44 sentimental bloke's " Doreen.
O Dead Marine !
Ah, Dead Marine ! the times are lean !
One-half thy contents may have been
Sufficient some wee babe to wean.
But for a grown-up man machine,
Or any older than fifteen,
It takes a bit more gasolene
Sad, sad to think —to ponder, e'en—
That till our own home towns are seen,
We'll slake our thirsts with old Yan Yean.
Adieu ! Adieu ! ma trusty frien'—
My Dead Marine !

"The Mystery of the Marie Celeste."

iPilx '™ l * >» ■*■ '*"'.* v™ V»V *\ •*.Vo* r v "&■<■&•. *5 '%''¥ ••'' >®9
THE following narration has appeared
elsewhere in some other publication,
but in the opinion of the present nar-
rator it is well worth telling for its absorb-
ing " queerness " alone. The story is in
the form of a problem which our readers
are invited to solve. The original pub-
licaton invited solutions, and when I say
that such eminent authors as Sir Rider
Haggard and Sir A. Conan Doyle tried
unsuccessfully to submit a true theory of
" Marie Celeste's" misfortunes, it should
put our readers on their mettle. Thfe
known facts are as follows and are
absolutely authentic in so far as the
narrator's memory serves him.
<s> 4- *
A good few years ago, the exact date does
not affect the story, the barque " Marie
Celeste " left New York with a good cargo
of general merchandise, a contented crew
and everything propitious for a good voyage.
4- * <S>
Four or five days after she was discovered
drifting, abandoned, in the North Atlantic,
by a passing tramp steamer whose attention
was attracted by the erratic behaviour of
the barque, which had all sails set, no signs
of distress, but was yawing all over the place
apparently under no control.
A boat's crew from the tramp boarded
the " Marie Celeste," as was painted on her
counter, the sea being almost a perfect
calm—as had been the condition for more
than a week past. On arrival on deck they
found no one at the wheel, in fact no signs
of life whatsoever. A close scrutiny showed
no signs ofviolence, orevidence of any strug-
gle. The sails and rigging were in perfect
condition, and the boats hung at their
davits. They went below. In the saloon
the table was laid as for a meal —the chairs
being pushed back from the table, and the
meal half eaten, breakfast it had been, from
the eggs and bacon, etc., which were, of
course, cold and dried up. It looked as
though the occupants had risen from the
table hurriedly. The captain had appar-
ently sat at the head of the table. Next him
had been his wife, as a lady's shawl was
thrown over the back of the chair, also thet e
was a sewing machine in one corner, with a
lady's thimble lying on its side, which fact
testified to the calmness of the weather.
Next, there was a child's chair, also some
toys, which would point to the presence of
a boy of 5 or 6 years of age.
4- 4 4>
Thus the evidence of the cabin —no sign
of blood, or disease, was seen therein and
no trace of any dead bodies.
On further examination the cargo was
found in good condition, therefore preclud-
ing the possibility of an asphyxiating gas
being generated, the only circumstance that
pointed to anything unusual having occurred

chronometer were missing.

The boarding-party then rowed round
the ship to see if possible if there was any
illuminating sign which would account for
the sudden disappearance of the whole of a
ship's company. They found nothing ; not
a rope was hanging from the side (they had
to climb up the bow chains themselves on
boarding from the boat). Except on the
starboard bow near the chains, were some
long vertical scratches. These threw no
light on the mystery surrounding the dere-
lict, so the completely mystified men rowed
back to their own ship and reported.
4 4
Now, gentle readers, amateur detectives'
and logical reasoners, explain and let us
have your written explanations to this office
if you can, and give a reason for this com-
plete abandonment of a ship which was in
perfect condition and at a time when the
wfeather had been almost a dead calm for
days past.

On the fourteenth inst. an unfortunate
accident occurred on the ship. Sergt. Miller
fell through the hatch into the hold. Luckily
the stair rail broke his fall and saved him
from what might have been a very serious
accident. He escaped, luckily, with a dis-
located wrist as well as a severe shaking.
Ship arrived at Port Said about noon on
Tuesday, 17th inst., and left for Suez at
11.30 p.m. the same night.
While at Port Said the Y.M.C.A. Rep.
secured another piano which was given
gratis by the Aust. Y.M.C.A. stationed here.
to see if a special train could be procured
and arrangements made for our proposed
trip to Kandy.

For the sum of two piastres we secured a
copy of the " Egyptian Mail " our first
news of the world since leaving England.
Learned from above that the Armistice
had been extended to January 17th, 1919.
While passing through the Canal, we were
treated to an exhibition of flying by a British
Squadron camped in tt a cVsert not far from
Suez
T 4- 4
We arrived at Suez about midday on the
18th, where we anchored for twelve hours.
Here our party was increased by the addi-
tion of 70 details of 1914 men waiting in
Egypt—so of these were Light Horse from
the Palestine fronts.

When the Padre spoke on language,
And one man's profanity—

From the man who feeds the fire ?

POST-WAR PROBLEMS.

No. 3.—RECONSTRUCTION.
4> 4- 4-
HAS it ever occurred to you what an
enormous amount of remodelling
of our national policies will be
needed when our soldiers return to civil life
and occupations ? It has hardly been
thought of yet, but we, the advance guard of
the demobilisation scheme, are on our way
home and must of necessity be the pioneers
of the thought of Australian soldiers on
matters affecting the national policy. There
is our land policy (including the various
State repatriation schemes) which must be
reconstructed on much broader lines to
make it effective. Up to the present we
have only seen one comprehensive scheme —
that of Queensland —and I contend that it
should not be a matter for an individual
State, but for the Commonwealth as a whole
to take the whole scheme over, so that we
may open up all the areas of land that are
suitable for agricultural purposes, in every
State of the Commonwealth.

THE LIGHT THAT FAILED.
Abdul (Bethlehem Guide). " That lamp, Sir, has burned for over a thousand years.'
"Dinkum?" "Well, it's time it went out!—pouff."
We would then entice the desirable white
immigrant to come to our country, for
there is no doubt that is the only way in
which we will populate the vast vacant
spaces of Australia. The places of our
friends who will never come back must be
filled up as soon as possible, and so stop
the chances of the Yellow Peril ever getting
a hold in our fair land.
Again, it is no use asking people to take
up land unless reasonable facilities are
provided for the transport of their produce
to the markets. The only way to do this is
for the authorities to push the railways
through the great central areas and thus
open up the country in every direction.
During the past we have been afraid to put
down new lines unless there were prospects
of an immediate return ; and how can you
expect a block of land that has to be cleared
and then cultivated to give you an immediate
return.

have kept to the coast and have never at-
tempted, to exploit our central agricultural
areas, except for grazing cattle and sheep
on.
<e> 4- 4-
This is a matter that every one of us re-
quires to think long and carefully about, and
get our ideas absoultely settled. "As we
shall sow, so shall we reap," and if we are
content to sit down and let the country lay
idle, Australia will still have the great
empty spaces to fill, and no one except
blacks to people them.
<§> 4-
But, if we work hard for the benefit of the
country we shall populate the empty spaces
with desirable people and have Australia
one of the greatest agricultural countries in
the world.
The more the agricultural industries
grow, themore the kindred industries grow,

THE MAN WITH THE FOUR BLUES
We wonder if anyone noticed a very dis-
consolate khaki figure on the wharf just
before we left blighty ?
4> 4- 4>
Our hearts were touched at his expression
and we asked the reason of his despondent
bearing. "You are going back to your
home, while I know not when the sight of
Peterhead will gladden my eyes," said he.
4> 4- 4-
"You don't know!" we replied. "Why
didn't you enlist in 1914, then you would be
with us ? "
4- 4* 4-
He burst into tears, and between sobs
unfolded this tale of woe.
4' 4- 4>
" Enlist in' 14 ?" he murmured. "Didn't
I try ! How hard I tried no one will know !
When war broke out* I was on the trip from
the Cultured City to Melbourne, where I
had never before been. The ozone of the
river, as the ship berthed in Riley Street
drain was slightly overpowering, so that
when I got ashore I lost my way. Instead of
reaching Scott's, I found myself after hours
of walking, out in Coburg.
4> 4> <s>
" It was too late to return to the city, so I
got a bed and waited till morning. I asked
the people how I could get back, and they
told me : ' Take that thing—it's a horse
tram —and then change to the cable car at
Brunswick.'
" I accordingly boarded the car, earning
a reprimand from the driver-conductor for
getting in at the same end as the other pas-
senger, which he said would certainly upset
the car. Need I speak of the journey to the
Business City ? Fortunately I had money,
and was able to obtain board and lodging
at each stop. But by the time I reached
Flinders Street and a recruiting office, the
news of the Anzac landing had come through
and that's the reason I don't wear the red
chevron ! ''

The soft-voiced sergeant on the gangway
recalled me to the ship, so that I had no
time to comfort my unhappy friend.

JAM IT ALL
There was a disillusioned Digger at mess
yesterday.
" Hullo ! " he said, as he seated himself at
the festive board, " what's the idea of put-
ting the port on at the beginning ? " And
he poured out half a pannikin just to sample
it.
" Port wine be d ," roared the M.O.
" Putthatback—that's to-day's jam issue !"
4* 4> 4*
STIFF
A certain digger always looked on the dark
side of things. One day a friend tried to
cheer him up.
"Why don't you do as the song says—
' Pack all your troubles in your old kit-bag,
and smile, smile, smile ? ' "
Digger : "I tried that once," he said
sadly, "but even then the Q.M.S. didn't
have a kit-bag big enough."
4> <s> <s>
Salvation Army Lassie (selling "War
Crys" ) : "What about buying one,
Aussie ? "
Digger : "Oh ! I don't believe in the
Bible ! "
Lassie: " But you should."
Digger : " What! Do you believe it true
about Jonah being in the whale's belly ?
How could you prove that ? "
Lassie : " Oh ! I'll ask Jonah when I go
to heaven ! "
Digger : " But suppose Jonah's not
there ? "
Lassie : " Wall, in that case, YOU'D better
ask him ! "

much, as we were under the shelter of the
ice cliffs, which rose in this place to 100 feet
in height.
❖ 4> <?>
We cruised along this ice face for a few
days, continually taking soundings, as we
did not know when we would strike a shoal,
and one afternoon a cry went up that land
was in sight at last. It proved to be the
place where the main party was to make its
home for the ensuing 13 months, and to be
the grave of two of our dearly loved com-
rades. A boat was lowered to investigate
the place, and the party, after about three
hours' absence, returned with the tidings
that it was eminently suitable, as there were
plenty of seals, penguins, and also a good
take off into the interior.
4- ♦ 4"
A place was selected to anchor the ship,
about a mile off the ice cliffs, and this place
was afterwards named Commonwealth
Bay.
Then the bustle commenced. The holds
were opened ; motor launch and boats were
put over the side, and the first load was got
away for the shore. It was incredible the
amount of stuff that was jambed into our
vessel.
4- 4- 4-
Just before the boats which had been
ashore with the first load returned, a heavy
breeze came on, accompanied with drift
snow, and this blow held the landing up for
three days. The landing of the material
occupied ten days, and we didn't have a
moment to spare.
4> 4>
There was a very convenient place (which
we called the boat harbour) to make a land-
ing stage, and this we did by making a der-
rick out of two lengths of the wireless
masts and then cutting a step in the ice wall,
which was about six feet high at this place.
To guard against the recurrence of a bliz-
zard, a party erected tents on shore, so that
the building of the huts could be erected
without interruption. It was during this
time that we had practically the only fine
weather during the whole time we were
there. You will understand this by my
saying that the wind average for the year
was 48.2 miles per hour.
4> 4-
One didn't seem to have enough time in a
day to complete the necessary preparations
to put the gear landed every day in a place
of safety. It wasn't safe to leave anything
on the ice, as in the course of a few days it
would have sunk out of sight. As soon as
all the gear for our base was unloaded from
the ship, we bade farewell to our comrades
on the ship who were to make a base to the
west of us.
<s> 4> 4-
Now there were only eighteen of us left to
complete the work.
The living huts of which we had two, were
erected on some outcropping rocks. Mag-
netic huts were erected, and the stores
dragged up to a convenient place close to
the hut. The hangar for the Aero Sledge
was constructed with empty clothes boxes,
etc., and all this work was only just com-
pleted in time.

Beware of counterfeit coins.
Carriage and Rickshaw Fares.—The fare
is by the hour. Every vehicle plying for hire
is licensed, and before payment, the wallah
should be made to produce his tariff, or
scale of charges—if he fails to do so, call
the first policeman (European for prefer-
ence, as the native police usually accept
" backsheesh " from the wallah). It is
understood that if you have a race with two
or more rickshaws it is worth a bit extra.

Police.—Civil (Native and European) ;
Military.

Hotels. —The principal hotels are the
Grand Oriental (G.0.H.), facing the har-
bour ; Bristol Hotel ; Galla Face Hotel and
Mount Lavinia (the latter is about seven
miles down the coast and is easily reached
by rail or road. It is a beautiful drive by
gharry or rickshaw, but the distance is
rather long for the latter method of convey-
ance). The hotels are all first class.
<s> 4- 4-
Tariff (pre-war).—Rps. 8 per day for
bedroom, meals, bath and attendance. All
hotels have splendid billiard rooms. The
Galle Face Hotel has a swimming bath (salt
water). The orchestra usually plays in the
evening. Dinner is in the evening, from 7
to 9 p.m.

The mid-day meal is called " Tiffin," and
is on from 12 to 2 p.m.

Silks. —Silks of all qualities are obtainable
but ar6 fairly expensive. The best plan is
to buy the silk by the yard and have it made
up in Australia.
4* 4" 4
Clothing (men's). —Linen, cotton (white
and colored), or linen drill, and crash suits
are cheap. All are suitable for Australian
wear.
Curios of any description may be bought.
Care should be taken with regard to the
exorbitant prices demanded by the natives.
You can, by " hanging off," usually buy the
article for half or quarter the " asking
price," as the native terms it.
European Business Houses. —The prices
are all fixed and it is no use trying to " beat
them down " in price.
Fruit.—Great care should be taken in
buying fruit by seeing that it is not over-
ripe, as cholera is likely to follow eating.

THE JORDAN VALLEY.
see just such a rapid rise both to east and to

see the skyline on either side, although such

I SUPPOSE it is the case with most men,
as assuredly it was with me, that im-
pressions gained from books were not
always the most trustworthy. Specially is
this so with regard to descriptions of places
about which we were accustomed to hear
much, from childhood up. I don't know
whether I was ever very much interested in
any description I had ever heard or read of
this Jordan Valley, before actually getting
into it, but I know that what impressions I
had formed of it before were far from being
in any sense like its reality.
4- 4-
As may be supposed, great varieties of
climate can be had in and around the Jordan
Valley. While in the summer it is possible
to get a freshening breeze on the tops, and
even cold and frost, it is totally impossible
to live in the valley in any degree of comfort,
because of its extreme heat. And in winter
time, while one may be almost frozen on the
tops, it is possible to walk about in the
valley in comfort without a shirt.

The town of Amman sports some of the
most interesting old ruins I have ever seen,
even in this land, so rich in ruins. They are
the remains of an old Roman amphitheatre,
in a sufficiently good state of preservation
to make it easy to conjure up old scenes that
must still haunt it.

The most striking thing about that part of
Syria which takes in the Jordan Valley, is
its mountainous character. Nothing that I
had ever heard or read of before prepared
me for such mountains. Imagine, if you
can, mountains that rise from a level 1200
feet below sea level to a height approaching
4000 feet above it—a height that it attained
within the comparatively short distance of
12 miles. Standing in the centre of the
lowest part of this valley it is possible to
In their first attack on the town the Light
Horse set out from the Valley in shirt sleeves.
When they got to the top they found that
rain had fallen, and out came the overcoats.

That night they slept two deep, and only for
the danger of smothering, they would have
slept ten deep, for the sake of getting a little

The best vantage point that I know of
from which a good panoramic view can be
had of this vastly imposing valley, is from
that part of the old Roman road from
Jerusalem to Jericho which brings the town
of Jericho right under your feet. The road
at this point skirts a deep gorge w T ith a
stream winding down its bed like a silver
ribbon.
After having planted yourself firmly on
this point of vantage let your eye take in the
whole panorama in one sweep. Here at your
feet is Jericho, with its tiny little mosques
rising up as it seems a few feet and its other
houses and hovels looking so small that it
might be a mere model of Jericho, any
house of which you could reach over and
pick up to examine like a toy. Beyond
Jericho, to the left, is the plain of Jericho,
which slopes down to the Jordan River, no
part of which can be seen because its bed is
in itself a Jordan Valley in miniature.
Beyond the river the ground rises again to
the hills at the foot of the Mountains of
Moab, from 18 to 20 miles away. Still
■sweeping round to the right with your eye,
you at length come to see a great sheet of
water which opens out into the Dead Sea.
As far as the eye can reach to the South, this
sheet of water stretches to the south until
it is lost in a haze so indefinable that you
cannot tell where sky and water meet. I
■don't suppose any digger would wait long
enough on the point of vantage to watch/>ld
Sol work his magic in light and shade,
though it would be well worth his
while. Writers have said " that the
valley is Old Sol's playground,"
the Light Horse will tell you that
it is impossible for anything else to
play when Old Sol is in his most sportive
mood. At no other place on earth is his
■coming in the morning ushered in with such
blaring of trumpets and pomp and circum-
stance. Rudyard Kipling, in his 44 Road to
Mandalay," makes the dawn come up like
thunder. You get some idea of the meaning
of this apparently meaningless phrase
when you see the sun rise over the Jordan
Valley. Wonderful colours of green and
gold and purple are given to the mountains
in ever changing hue till the whole is trans-
formed from their unforbidding appearance
till seeming to have been draped with a soft
velvet mantle which changes colour with
every wave of Old Sol's magic wand.
Life does not permit of unceasing con-
templation of grandeur, let it be ever so
grand. And in the case of Old Sol and his
wonderful transformations, he will soon
drive you out by the very intensity of his
efforts to please, till you seek a shelter from
his burning rays. You may have been
raised out of yourself till you didn't
feel the pangs of thirst stealing on
you, but you will wake up presently
and find you have such a thirst as
one can experience only in the East. Of
course you will want to slake it, and here
you will find a real pleasure, for clear run-
ning streams abound, and in the shade of a
thorn bush, you may lie down and drink
your fill of pure cool water. These streams
run the whole year round and find their way

Treacle de Lyle had taken his fiancee punt-
ing at Richmond. Some rough Australian
fellows in another boat had collided with the
lovers, and even Treacle's marvellous skill
in punting—gained by many an afternoon's
practice at Flemington and Caulfield—
failed to prevent a catastrophe. As the punt
capsized, Margery cast herself into his arms
and they fell overboard together.
Margery fainted.
As she fainted she fell downstairs and,
breaking her neck, died.
" She is dead ! " said the doctor.
He was right.

Kiwi wandered by the embankment and
meditated —one might almost say pondered.
Fortunately the water was scarcely knee
deep, so they waded ashore, and went to
their homes to change their clothes —she to
her death, as has been told.
Now, when a healthy, sought-after, first-
row chorus-girl starts to think, there is
something wrong. And there was with
Kiwi. Tom —her beloved Ginger—was
going back to France next day.
But the punt drifted down stream and
saved the life of Kiwi.
Coming up for the third time she, woman-
like, had changed her mind about dying.
Why was he not here with her on this last
night ?
" Rather," gurgled she, " will I become a
V.A.D. and go to France with my Ginger."
And the punt coming along at that moment,
she grasped it and was borne along with the
stream, and then with the tide far out to sea.
The reason is simple. It was but a short
15 minutes since he had left her. He would
have NEVER have left her but that she had
only enough money for one drink —the drink
he was now having.

Meanwhile Kiwi cogitated.

POST-WAR PROBLEMS.
By L. V. Worle.
No. 4.—THE METAL INDUSTRY.
HAVING dealt, in previous issues,
with our primary industries, we
now come to what will be one of
our greatest manufactures—our metal in-
dustry. As everyone knows, before this
war turned commerce and the world upside
down, Germany had her octopus-like ten-
tacles spread with overwhelming grip
around the heart of our metal trade, so that
the local manufacturers absolutely could not
compete with her. For, by a liberal system
of national subsidising of her steamship
companies, they were able to transport the
crude ores to Germany at a much cheaper
rate than we could send them to our own
manufacturing centres not a tithe of the
distance from our mines, that she had to
carry them. But now, owing to there
having been no means of transporting the
ores out of the country, we have started
treating them ourselves, sending them on
to the manufacturing centres, thereby giving
every metal trade a great frlip.
4-^4-
This has meant increased prosperity
everywhere, and we have proved in this, as
in every other Australian industry, that we
can make the goods of a quality as high, if
not higher, than the imported article.
4> 4-
It is therefore up to us to see that the
export tariff on crude ores is so prohibitive
as to keep out for all time the foreign trading
interests that have done so much harm to
our manufacturing industries. As soon as
the peace problems have been settled and
peace actually declared, Germany and her
allies are going to get to work with the
peaceful penetration programme that she
has drawn up during the war, ready for in-
stant action. In fact, her feelers have been
out already in some of the countries that
have fought with us for national freedom,
and, unless we take a firm stand we will be
in the same unenviable position as before,
relying on the foreign countries for the
finished article.
The point is : Are we going to allow the
peaceful penetration scheme to go on un-
molested, or will we fight with our backs to
the wall —as we have done in this war just
finished ; fight for the freedom of our manu-
facturing industries and the right to keep
them going in spite of the opposition that
will come from the big importing interests
that have mismanaged our industries in the
past.
4- 4 4-
We Australians have already been taught
a lesson that we will never forget, in the
enormous profits made by Germany out of
the great Cobar Copper Mines.
* 4- 4>
Tfliink it over, weigh it in the balance of
your common sense, and if it is worth while,
stick together and make it a fight that will
be remembered by the future generations
of Australians as the turning point in the
history of this great Commonwealth —
where, from being a country that only grew
or found the raw material, we became a
self-contained nation able to make her way
in the world's manufactures in line with the
best of the old world countries.
COMMONWEALTH
REPATRIATION SCHEME
By A. Digger
THE latest Commonwealth repatriation
scheme that this paper has seen,
does not deal with land or small
businesses, and gives one much food for
thought. It provides for some small loans,
gratuities and sustenance allowances for
Australian soldiers until they are absorbed
into civil life again.
Firstly, it provides for a gratuity to the
value of £25 for widows with children or
totally incapacitated soldiers (in poor cir-
cumstances) to buy furniture.
<£> 4- 4-
A gratuity of £lO for the purpose of buy-
ing tools, instruments or personal equip-
ment, artificial limbs and surgical
appliances and repairs.

Medical treatment, with travelling ex-
penses to hospitals.
Free passages for soldiers
returning to homes abroad, wives of sol-
diers who married abroad, and fiances
under a guarantee of marriage after arrival.
4- 4- 4-
Sustenance allowance on application by
soldiers awaiting employment, within six
months of discharge, which will be granted
on the following scale : Soldier without
dependant, 425. ; with wife, 525. ; with
wife and one child, 555. 6d. ; with wife and
two children, 595.; with wife and three
children, 625. 6d. ; with wife and four or
more children, 66s ; all these rates inclu-
sive of pensions.
On failure to accept employment, or loss
of employment, the applicant will be
granted one week's allowance, and the
State Board will have power of revision.
4- 4- 4-
Apprentices will have their wages made
up to the wages of a journeyman, and re-
ceive technical training free.
Funeral allowance of £lO for soldiers
dying in poor circumstances.
Educational expenses, where necessary,
for the training of a soldier or dependant.
4- 4>
Rent, where necessary, for a totally in-
capacitated soldier or the widow of a soldier.
4-4-4-
Loans to be made to soldiers, on security,
no interest on the first £5O, and above £5O
at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum up to
£l5O, and special cases to Minister, £250,
for the purchase of approved businesses,
stock, plant, etc.
A soldier taking up land or a business has
the right of appeal, through the State Boards
to the Commonwealth Commission, on any
dispute, the Commission's decision will be
final.
The whole of this scheme, in our humble
opinion, does not go far enough. We came
to this war and fought not for any State, but
for the Commonwealth and Empire.
We do not ask for charity—only the oppor-
tunity of taking up the broken thread of our
lives, and resuming our former occupations.
We have the RIGHT to ask, whilst we
were defending the country's freedom and
honour, that our private interests be looked
after, and that we do not suffer financially
through being away, fighting the common
foe.
♦ <s>
This Commonwealth scheme, with the
six State schemes, represents a conglome-
ration that no man can dissect, and we must
see that the Commonwealth take the matter
up, taking the best of every scheme, and
make a uniform workable whole that can
be administered quickly and efficiently.
We do not want to go home and wait for
years for the opportunity for working the
land or business, but want to get I'ight on
the job and make up for lost time.
4-' ♦ 4-
Anf of us know what a time it takes to get
through an application to Land Boards, and
we don't want that again with these eternal
Commissions. We must have ready by the
time the main body will return a compact
and efficient machines working to return
them to civil life.
So put your shoulders to the wheel, and
show them at home that we will not accept
charity, but will have our rights as men-
justice and fair treatment for all, and an
early return to pre-war occupations.
4- 4- 4>
Do away with all the State Boards and
appoint one Commission, capable of doing
the work, with adequate representation
from the soldiers —for no one knows better
than themselves what we want—and you
will find that the difficulties of repatriation
will disappear and the Commonwealth will
resume its normal state in a very short time
with increased prosperity for every class in
the Commonwealth.

ON Sunday the sth, our Editor sent me
to interview our sporting sea-weedy
friend, Neptune's bath. I walked
along the main street of Port Hacking in
pursuit of our old pal, and meeting two wild,
wet and woolly diggers, I explained my
difficulty of finding our old friend. They
generously offered to assist me and leading
me along, all of a sudden I was propelled
forcibly through the air and landed (gently ?)
on the bosom of our old pal. I spat out
three gallons of the liquid that spoils good
whisky, and asked him how the world was
treating him. He gazed out to sea with a
far-away expression and replied : " Well,

WRESTLING.
By Smackanhit.
4 4 4-
Soon after leaving Colombo, an effort was
made to get the above sport going, but the
results so far have been very discouraging
to the initiators.
The mat was spread on the deck for'ard,
starboard side, each evening, but in spite
of the stentorious exhortations of " Snowy "
Taylor and the persuasiveness of his con-
frere, " Darkie " Taylor, business was
scarce and the " birds " were shy.
4- 4
It being too late at this juncture to arrange
a tournament, the idea has been abandoned.
Still the mat remains open to all desirous
of exhibiting their dexterity. With Driver
Jim Powell demonstrating the art of " The
Breaking of Joints and How to do it," and
the two Taylors handling the would-be
" Catch as Catch Canaanites," a few more
interesting evenings should be passed ere
disembarkation.
4 4 4
There is so little chance of obtaining
enough exercise on board ship that the ranks
of the wrestlers should be enlarged and
perhaps some good matches result.
INDOOR GAMES.
4 4 4
During the week the Sports Committee
called for entries for a series of the following
indoor games : Draughts, Chess, Cribbage,
Euchre, Auction Bridge and Quoits, and a
large number of entries were received.
It is proposed to conduct these games on
interstate lines, to see which State provides
the most champions.
4 4 4
Most of the best players have entered, and
there is bound to be some exceptionally
tough games.
4 4 4
The competitions will start early next
week.
The entries received for the various games
were : Chess, 43 ; Draughts, 74 ; Cribbage,
110 ; Euchre, 46 ; Auction Bridge, 73 ;
and Quoits, 17.
ON Saturday the season was continued,
when an interesting programme
was put on, including a pillow fight
on the,greasy pole, and the standing long
jump, in which all the champions tried con-
clusions, and a great afternoon's sport
resulted, some of the comedies in the pillow
fight being past description. Results :
4 4- 4
Semi-finals.
Treacle McFarland (Q.) v. Purtel (N.S.W.)
In the first bout, Treacle did not hit for a
long time, just letting Purtel whack away,
until he saw his opportunity, when he
swung in an undercut on his opponent's
legs and as he swung, hit him on the top of
the head and knocked him clean off the pole.
4 4 4
In the second bout Purtel knocked
Treacle off with a beautiful clout in the eye,
and Treacle couldn't recover in time and
went into the inverted position and hung for
a while, but Treacle had to take the count.

better in the tricky work, but the Gum-

fought a bye with Cpl. Hay ward, who was
too light to be in the ring with the big man.

Sgt. (Treacle) McFarland (Q.), list. 81bs.
Pte. Ron. Wells, M.G.G. (Vic.), lOst. 61bs.
The fight was uninteresting from a spec •
tator's point of view, and went through
six rounds of clinches and break-aways,
Wells coming in close and using all his ring-
craft to stop the big man from getting in
any effective hits, and Treacle pushing him
off to try and make an open fight and get his
hitting powers into play. In the fourth
round Treacle got a hard left home and sent
Wells to the boards for eight, but he came
to his feet and bored in and stayed there,
leaning on the big man, and the fight ended
at last by Wells getting the verdict on points

Ist round. —The round opened with some
very fast and clever exchanges, Powell
scoring with the left and Roscoe piling up
points with his right. Some great footwork
and ring-craft was seen, then Roscoe con-
nected with a right swing to the jaw that
shook Powell, and followed with a very fast
left. The round was very fast and clean and
there was not much between the boys at the
finish, Roscoe having just a little the better
of it.

2nd round.—The opening exchanges were
lively and Roscoe connected with the right
and Powell scored to the head and body.
Powell was doing most of the leading, but
Roscoe was getting home his terrific rights
with great regularity, and had Powell rock-
ing during the round, but he came again
and scored to the head in succession, and
Roscoe scored with left to the point, gaining
a further margin of points in this round.

3rd round. —Powell connected to jaw with
left ; Roscoe retaliated to body ; then
Powell came in very fast, but stopped with
a rush when he met one of Roscoe's right
swings and Roscoe followed in and con-
nected again, the towel being thrown in
from Powell's corner. A good, clean fight
from start to finish by two clever and willing
lads.

Flyweights.
Arriving in Colombo harbour in the
evening of New Year's Day, arrangements
were made the following morning to put on
an interesting series of bouts, the main
contest being between the two flyweight
champions of the Island—Jack Johnson
(3st. 41bs.) and Ole Starlight (4st. 51bs.).
The bout was willing from the jump, Star-
light rushing his man, but Jack ducked
cleverly and poked out his left as Starlight
retreated, and when the ole fellow came in
again, got him with a ripping uppercut.
Both boys then missed with wild swings,
and then Jack connected to the point and
Ole Starlight's blood rose and they went at
it hammer and tongs, but Jack, keeping
cool, kept poking his left home and won
easily.

The rest of the fights were willing, but the
main contest was easily the best, and kept
the large crowd highly excited and the kids
were uproariously applauded and showered
with pennies and silver.

Gunner Bill Brigs had just returned from
his first Blighty leave, and, like many before
him, let his thoughts carry him back to the
land where, only a few hours previous, he
had been in his haven of delight.
•$> <s>
He was a good fellow was Bill, but his one
great failing was woman ; one smile from
a pretty face simply plucked Bill's heart
from its bearings. And now Bill told of his
pleasures.
4 4 4
44 Well, it's about the best place I know
of," said he ; 44 and all I want now is a 4 tres
bon ' little wound, anywhere in the fleshy
part of the arm or leg will do for mine, so
long as it gets me over there."
Then came the part we fully expected.
Bill went on to tell us how he had picked up
the best little tab that he'd ever seen.
4 4- 4
44 I was on top of a 'bus, goin' out towards
Shepherd's Bush, and on gets a little tab
and sits on the seat 'longside of me. Every
thing went alright for a while, until suddenly
the old 'bus bumped something hard, and
before the girl could regain her balance she
fell helplessly into my arms.
<s> 4- <s>
She didn't seem to mind, and apologized,
and so did I, and to finish up we gets off
together and goes to a play. After the play
we goes to supper, then I carts her home,
and makes a meet with her for the following
night.
<s> * 4-
44 Well, I met her every night after that.
Went to theatres, and everything possible
there was to go to. And now, here's a bloke
back here in this hole !
<s> <?> 4-
"Anyhow, she's going to write to me
always, and she reckoned that I was the only
Aussie she'd ever met or ever walked with.
I reckon she's dinkum, because every night
she was there as regular as clockwork
waiting for me."
Here Bill was interrupted by the arrival
of Ted Spinks, just down from the gun pits,
and expecting to go on his second Blighty
leave the following day.
4 4 4-
44 Well, Bill," said Ted ; 44 Tell me what
you think of Blighty now."
4- 4 4
Bill again explained all his experiences to
Ted, not forgetting to mention his meeting
with the fair lady.
<s> <s> 4-
"Well, Bill, old boy," said Ted, 44 I'm
going to see the best little girl in Blighty
when Igo there. Funny thing, I met her in
nearly the same way as you met that girl of
yours. It was on the top of a 'bus where I
met my tab. Ethel's her first name ! "
4 4 4
44 Blow me, if it ain't the same name as
my girl," said Bill.
4 4 4
44 Well," continued Ted ; 44 I took her
home that night—to Ward Street! "
44 The same street as me ! " said Bill.
44 Was it at Shepherd's Bush ? "
44 Yes," said Ted, 44 Number 11 Ward
Street."
44 The very same as mine ! " said Bill.
44 Well, I'm blowed ! And she told me as I
was the only bloke she'd ever been out with.
Does she write to you, Ted ? "
4> 4- 4>
44 Write to me ! Why, of course—every
week ! And she's told me how she always
stops at home and is always wishing for me
to come— and here she is going out with
Bill, Tom and Harry."
4> 4- 4-
44 She told me, too, that I was the first
bloke she'd went out with."
4 4- 4
44 Well, anyhow, I'll steer clear of her this
time ; she'll get no theatres and suppers
out of me ! " said Ted, getting up and going
outside.
Bill Brigs sat there alone for an hour,
with a look on his face that was anything
but pleasant. Then he slowly got up and
walked five kilos to drown his sorrows in
44 point blank."

" Hacking Cough."

and unbeliever of the first water. Tell him a
story of the unusual and he will kick back

Well, here's another No. 9 for him to scoff
or not to scoff, namely the solution of the
mystery of the 44 Marie Celeste."
The Editor,
44 Hacking Cou£h."
Sir, —1 would like to place before you my
theory of the desertion of the 44 Marie
Celeste." My idea is that she ran into an
iceberg, probably in the early morning,
during a very heavy fog. The forepart of the
ship, say the jibboom, being held fast, which
would cause a panic, the crew being under
the impression that the berg would at any
minute crash down on them, leaving the
alternative of waiting for death or trying to
get away by boat. The captain, although in
haste to get away, would not forget his
instruments of navigation (which were
missing). The boat being got ready, every-
body would leave by a rope found trailing in
the water. A ladder would not be needed,
the ship being small and not too high from
the water the captain's wife and child could
be handed down. After they had got away,
the berg probably drifted south, melting all
the time. The wind changing could catch
in the sails and blow the ship off. I would
account for the small boat, being a long dis-
tance from land, could easily run out of
supplies and the occupants would soon go
mad or starve to death, which could easily
happen in those days of travel when ships
were small and few and far between.
4- 4 4
There is nothing to prove that the barque
was abandoned. In fact the boats hanging
in the davits show that the crew never left
the ship. The disappearance of the log-
book and chronometer point to the fact that
preparations had been made to leave her,
but for what reason ?
4 4 4
It has been proved beyond a doubt that it
was not bad weather, the ship was not on
fire, neither had she sprung a leak, nor was
there any sign of disease, or mutiny, or any
of the usual circumstances which cause a
whole ship's company to fade away, but it
was the unusual that happened in this case.

the berg probably drilled south, melting all The only clue we have is the long vertical
the time. The wind changing could catch scratches on the starboard bow near the

account for the small boat, being a long dis- natural to conclude that they were caused by
tance from land, could easily run out of somethingfrom the outside, and that some-
supplies and the occupants would soon go thing (pe rhaps two of him) came aboard and

Snowy Taylor and the other Sandgropers

Dolly pointed out and there, lo and behold,
was the solitary figure of an old White-
bearded Sundowner sitting upon his swag
on the hilltop overlooking Albany. An old
collie was lying in the shade of a Jarra
stump and the three small puppies played
around a time-worn 44 Whitely King "

at the Crimean War and was the only
white man now left in the land of the
Sandgroper to welcome home the 1914
draft of Anzacs arriving to-day on the
s.s. " Port Hacking." He had tramped over
miles of desert sands from the Kimberley

heroes who were expected to make a landing
at the famous city of Albany, under the
leadership of the veteran 44 Dropshort

Part IV.
AFTER a few weeks of solid work we
commenced to take things a little
easier, as we had finished the huts
and had most of the recording instruments
in working order. But, of course, there was
still plenty to do in the way of storing seal
and penguin meat for the winter, making
gear more secure, as by this time it had
commenced to blow, and unless boxes, etc.,
were made secure with rocks, they were
liable to blow into the sea. In fact we lost
two sledges by not securing them before we
had had an opportunity of knowing what
the wind could do.
etc., and a couple of short sledging journeys
were made, and they had a rough time with
the wind and snow.
There was plenty of work inside, repair-
ing and altering clothes, tents, etc. One
man, of course, was sleeping every day,
being on night watch the night before, and
his duties consisted of keeping the stove
going to heat the hut, observations of tem-
perature, movements of clouds, Aurora
Australis, and wind, baking bread, prepar-
ing breakfast for the cook, and last, but not
least, having a bath and washing a few
articles of clothing. Each man had a turn
every 18 days. One of our big jobs during
the winter was preparing and packing the
food for the spring and summer sledging.
Well, the winter gradually left us, and the
weather started to clear up and the sledging
parties moved off on their respective jour-
neys and those who were left in the hut
commenced to pack up the gear and collect
penguin eggs the arrival of the ship.
In about ten weeks' time the first of the
sledging parties returned and one day
shortly after this we were surprised to see
the motor boat from the ship moving into
our boat harbour.

I may mention that we had recorded one
gale up to 204 miles per hour when the
anemometer broke. It was during this
gale that one of the wireless masts was
blown down. Unless one has experienced
gales such as these, it would seem like a
fairy tale to say that it was comparatively
child's play to erect a mast in a 50 mile an
hour gale, but we did it, and didn't think
much of this achievement either.

As the winter started to arrive, the wind
and snow became very persistent, and we
used to have a sweepstake on the monthly
wind average. The payments were made in
chocolate, and one syndicate made a gamb-
ling instrument which they called Hunterloo
and very soon after they had cornered the
whole of our Saturday chocolate for weeks
ahead. When they had completed their
scheme they used to bribe us with their
illgotten gains (of course we, the losers,
reckoned they were illgotten). In the winter
not much work could be done outside, al-
though the daily records had to be made of
temperature, wind, magnetic variations,

You can imagine the excitement this
caused, as we hadn't seen the ship come in.
Our first excitement over, everyone started
clamouring for his mail, and a happy party
we were, but a black cloud was hanging over
us. Sir Douglas Mawson's party had not
returned, and as the days wore on the feeling
gained ground that something serious had
happened to our leader. The ships cruised
along to the east, to see if he was on the
coast, but there was no sign of him.

Captain Davis, who was second in com-
mand, then decided to leave a relief party
for another year to go out and look for them
as darkness was coming on and the Western
Party had to be relieved, as they were on
practically floating ice. About four hours
after leaving a very sorrowful party behind,
we received a wireless message from the
base to say that Mawson had returned, but
Minnis and Merty were dead, and to return
at once and pick up the party.
4> 4> 4-
We returned, but found a heavy blizzard
blowing, and after hanging on for 24 hours,
it was decided to leave them (they were
relieved in 1914) as the Western party were
in a perilous position as regards food, etc.
We passed along the coast for about 1200
miles, and through 40 miles of pack ice, and
on the 28th February, 1913, we came up to
their base.

It took about 12 hours to water ship and
embark the party and then we turned for
home, and three weeks later we passed
into one of the most beautiful places in
Australia—D'Entercastreaux Channel, Tas-

So ends my first Antarctic trip, but the

POST-WAR PROBLEMS.
By L. V. Worle.
No. S.—THE WOOL INDUSTRY.
WE now come to one of our greatest
problems and one of the most im-
portant in the welfare of the country
—the Wool Industry.
❖ 4- <«>
We breed what is recognised the world
over as the finest wool-producing sheep,
both for quality and quantity, that the world
has seen, and our annual wool sales are
among the greatest in the world. But most
of the clips are bought by exporters and
agents for shipment to England and other
countries for manufacture into blankets,
cloth, etc. ; we also have the local manu-
facturer buying very small quantities for
his factories.
4- 4- 4
Take the average man in the street before
the war, and you would find that he wore on
his back Australian grown wool of foreign
manufacture, in most cases, unknowingly.
The absurdity of it Why ! it stands out as a
monument of the Australians' negligence
in matters of national importance, letting
the exporting and importing interests guide
his thoughts into the channels most profit-
able for them and most expensive for the
average individual.
4 4> ❖
We carry our raw materials over 11,000
miles for the purpose of manufacturing
them and carry back the same distance our
local requirements of the finished article ;
the colossal waste of labor and energy
speaks for itself, especially when we have
the raw materials, machinery, and work-
people willing to, and capable of manufac-
turing the cloths of a better quality than the
imported article, right on the spot.
+ <s> *
Why, we know ourselves that whilst we
have been soldiers, the Australian tunics,
blankets, etc., have " licked " the other
makes out of sight for wearing qualities
and appearance, and the majority weie al-
ways on the lookout for a " dinkum Aussie "
tunic. Well, if they are the best for the
soldier, surely they are the best for the
civilian, and we want to stick out for them
every time.


During this war the Imperial Govern-
ment have bought practically the whole of
our wool clip (after supplying local de-
mands) for a number of years after the war.
This would not have been necessary, or
possible, if our woollen manufacturing
industry had been on a sound basis before
the war. The Imperial authorities would
have bought the manufactured article,
thereby letting their own factories do other
work in connection with the successful
prosecution of the war, and it would have
meant a big increase in the financial re-
sources of our own country, and thus have
meant less direct taxation towards the cost
of the war.
* st> <s>
The buying of our clip means that our
woollen manufacturers will be, to a certain
extent, restricted until that period is com-
pleted, but, with a look-ahead policy, we can
prepare for the day when normal conditions
will be with us again, and attain the premier
position in this great industry.
Most of us returning to civil life will find
it necessary to buy complete new outfits of
clothing ; now, are we going to demand
cloths of Australian manufacture, or are we
going to take what the tailor likes to give
us ?
-¥ <*
If every man going home demands (and
sees that his demands are complied with)
cloths of Australian manufacture, it will
mean that our factories will get a big
" boost," and the money wffl stop in the
Commonwealth. It will also mean that
more machinery will be needed to meet the
increased demand, and so the general pros-
perity will be felt in every kindred industry,
making more work for our people, supply-
ing them with a better article and keeping
the circulation of our money in the Com-
monwealth.
Every man asking for local products
means a little more towards the great idea
we are all working for, and with our natural
business acumen and keen competition to
assist it, there is no reason why Australia
should not become in the near future the
greatest woollen cloth manufacturing coun-
try in the whole world.

THE JORDAN VALLEY—Part 2.
By A. J. Fawley, 7th L.H.
IN addition to the heat of the Valley, the
place abounds in venomous reptiles
and vermin. Snakes particularly are
to be found there, all of which are venomous
and deadly. The most dangerous of all, I
think, the Asp, a bite from which will put a
man out in less than 20 minutes. Of the
many causes of death in the valley, the snake
was no insignificant one. Almost every day
we would hear of a case of snakebite, the
victim in nearly every case dying.
There were other kinds of snakes besides
the asp, such as vipers, cobras, adders, and
many other little known varieties. For the
comfort of the troops in the valley, it was
necessary to start a crusade against this
very real nuisance, and a good killing came
to pass, as a result, the valley is freer of
snakes now, I venture to say, than it has
been since the time when owing to a well
nigh infernal rumpus, it was made.

The Medical Officers, in order to get an
wealth. Residence for six months of each
year in first five years.

The South Australian scheme applies to
all H.M. Forces with clean discharges, and
offers land on perpetual leases, or purchase

analysis of the poison of the different snakes
so that they might combat its effects more
effectively, gave it out that they would be
pleased if the lads would carry live snakes
to them, so that they might milk them of
their poison. On the first day after this
request came out, our medical dug-out was
beseiged with every variety of snake that
the valley knows, till the medical orderly
was compelled in self-defence to threaten
the snake collectors with a machine-gun.
With regard to vermin, there are to be
found every species of nefarious scorpion,
spider, ant and beetle known to science, and
many that are not so known. The scorpions
and spiders particularly are of very big and
ferocious varieties. As may be supposed
they made things uncomfortable, for they
always seemed to have a partiality for dug-
outs. However, quite a lot of amusement
and even excitement was caused by these
very same vermin. One chap that I knew
had the champion fighting scorpion in the
Division. He was a big black one, about six
inches long, with claws like those of a

medium-sized crayfish and a sting in his tail
as sharp and as hard as the point of a needle.
His owner, who was very proud of
44 Satan," as he called him, used to carry
him about in a tin, and would throw out
challenges to fight any type of vermin that
could be dug up in the Jordan Valley.
Giant spiders were brought, and would
give a good acount of themselves, till at the
psychological moment 44 Satan" would let
fly with his tail—finish spider.
<?> 4- <s>
The most deadly of all—and the smallest
—is yet to be described. I refer to the mos-
quito. He abounds in swamps and any
place where water lies stagnant. And like
the other pests, the mosquito was übiqui-
tous. Every precaution was taken against
him, the most effective being the killing of
the egg, which is always left to hatch in
rubbish on the surface of still water.
The magnitude of this job is not grasped
till one comes to consider how much stag-
nant water would lie on an area of hundreds
of thousands of acres over a great part of
which swamps and stagnant water was to
be found. Even on the edge of running
streams would be found still water, which
had to be drained off into the streams and
the banks lined with stones to keep the water
from spilling over into the holes, becoming
stagnant and so affording a good surface
for the mosquito to lay his eggs on. Every
stream in our sector was so lined and a
party was told off to watch them.
Where the water could not be drained off—
as in the case of swamps—the surface was
cleared of all rubbish and then sprayed with
disinfectant.
4- <s> <e>
But in spite of all these precautions the
mosquito continued to thrive, and to give
in exchange for the blood he took from one,
a good dose of malaria. When our casualty
list used to appear in the 44 Kiaora Cooee,"
it would be found that the proportion of men
evacuated from the valley because of malaria
against that for wounds from fighting
would be about 10 to 1. Unfortunately, in
the majority of cases the kind of malaria
was that described as M.T. (Malignant)
which was the cause of many deaths.

THERE was a rush on change to sell the
shares of Kandied Railways Pty. Ltd.
when news was received by Cooks
Tourists Ltd. going smash, with no pros-
pects of an early resumption of business and
the market finished dead, plenty of sellers
and no buyers.
House Goldmining Coy. rose a few points
on receipt of news from the manager that a
rich vein had been struck, but there was no
definite intimation whether it ran right
through the reef, and this company has been
striking very patchy streaks from the start,
so speculators want to look ahead before
plunging.

Kolombo Kurios Ltd. sent along their

diggers are on their way to the goldfields of

COMPANY FLOTATION
A new company was started during

and their elaborate prospectus has been
received at this office.

The Company is acquiring the lease of one
of the largest foundries in Australia, and

feet, special pendulums for lead swinging
artists to enable them to baffle the Pensions

This company is going in to provide a long

efficient direction, there is no reason why
it should not go ahead, especially as they

There were a large number of entries and
some of the contests were very funny. In

exactly the same moment and both men
were knocked clean off their perch and
landed with a mighty splash together.

The first bout was a challenge contest
between Bunny Smart, A.F.A. (Vic.), lOst,

The contest opened quietly, both men
finessing for an opening, when Benham
rushed his man, scored with the left to
head and right to body, and some lively
exchanges followed, Banham scoring
heavily in the in-fighting.

The second round opened lively, and
Smart connected with a right, then missed
badly with the left, and Banham, boring in

In the third Smart evened matters by
scoring with straight lefts that stopped
Banham's rushes with a jerk, and was the
only round he won in the contest.

The fourth was willing, Smart connected
to the jaw, with the left but Banham jumped
in and punished his man severely about the

Chapter 5.
Treacle de Lyle waited at Tilbury for the
44 Potakin," due in at any moment.
44 Carrambo ! Parbleu ! Donnerwetter !
Tempus fugit! Vivavoci !" he swore im-
patiently. Many years at work on the copra
mines in Queensland had left their imprint
on his language.
And now he was troubled ! Recently he
had invested heavily in some theatrical ven-
tures. All had gone well till a Swedish
agent had outbid him for the pianist over
whom the world had gone mad —Brooke
Wells. Hearing of the infatuation of the
dumb pianist for Kiwi of the 44 Felicity," he
had sent his agent to her with an offer of
engagement, hoping thus to lure Wells back
from Stockholm. Then, just as all seemed
well, Kiwi had disappeared, and here he was,
waiting for his fish, but without the bait to
land him.
At that moment the 44 Potakin " rounded
the corner, and with a great clanging of
bells and blowing of whistles, drew along-
side the platform—rather, the wharf—sink-
ing two bumboats and a ferry in the process.
Treacle paid little attention to the commo-

First Mate's arm around her waist, was
Miss Kookee, wan and weak and worn, but
still the old shining Kiwi.
As soon as she came ashore he spoke to
her.
44 Did you meet Brooke Wells ? "he asked.
She burst into tears and borrowed his
handkerchief.
44 He is dead ! " she sobbed.
44 Dead ? "
"Alas ! Yes. Dead ! Dead ! Dead ! "
44 Then will you marry me ? " eagerly
asked de Lyle.

" I don't mind if I do ! " breathed the poor
girl, as she leaped to his arms and pushed
him into a passing luggage porter.
Treacle kissed her on the nose and swore
as the porter's truck went over his toe.

Chapter 6.
"In seven days I shall foreclose ! "
Twysupp Chirnsyde spoke in a voice as
harsh as a gas rattle.
" But you know I can't pay till my cat-
farm dividends are declared ! "
" In seven days I shall foreclose ! "
Like the trump of doom came the words
to the ears of Sir Treacle de Lyle, Bart.,
0.8. E., S.R.D.
Things had prospered with him since his
marriage seven years before. Two succes-
sive successes at the " Felicity '' had brought
him first a knighthood and then a baronetcy,
besides much wealth ; but some unwise
speculations had placed Cane Castle under
a mortgage in the hands of the notorious
money-lender, Twysupp Chirnsyde ; and
now the old family seat seemed likely to go.
"In seven days " but Sir Treacle
waited for no more. Grasping a heavy ink-
well from the table he hurled it with terrific
force at the financier's head, killing him
instantly, and unfortunately splashing some
ink over a priceless example of the early
work of Corot.
So perished Twysupp Chirnsyde.

Chapter 7.
Sir Treacle de Lyle was dead. At 8 a.m.
the black flag had floated out from Newgate
Prison. Directly Superintendent Kelly of
the C.I.D. had taken up the case of the Ink-
welled Philanthropist, the murderer was
doomed. Not for nothing was Kelly's Eye
famous. Kelly's Eye could spy criminals
and Kelly's nose scent evildoers where all
other detectives were baffled. The detec-
tive's triumph was shortlived, however.
With a sardonic smile he spoke the last
words of the damning evidence and turned
to leave the court. A shot rang out from the
back of the court and Kelly staggered back,
while one of his former victims escaped in
the confusion-. Yet his work was well done.
The wretched murderer had paid the su-
preme price. Our old friend Treacle was
dead —hanged.
(Long instalment next week.)
N.B.—As Lady de Lyle and her numerous
offspring have most unfortunately been
killed in an air raid, we cannot print any
more of this enthralling story.

KOLOMBO KOONS.

A Criticism on the Kolombo Koons Koncert
Kompany.
By Onlooker.
Knowing that the Handley Page,'with a
crowd of Dinkum Abo's were to arrive on
board, great preparations were made to
have everything up to Dick.
The stage was erected on the Saloon Deck
at the sharp end of the ship. The lighting
effects, consisting of Spot Lights (in two
spots half lit) were generously supplied by
the ship's company. We all watched the
Northern sky during the evening for the
appearance of the Aeroplane, but there was
no sign of her. At last a cry went up :
" Here she comes," and as everyone lis-
tened, a low humming sound was heard,
but as the minutes wore on it didn't seem to
get any louder.
4 4 4
At last someone scouting round the deck
discovered that it was only the ash hoist
working. It was now dark and everyone
was getting weary, till suddenly a stealthy
shuffling of feet was heard coming from the
blunt end of the ship, and into the semi-
lighted arena strode, slipped and hopped
the most weird collection of Dark Humanity
it would be possible to find in Gyppo Land.
They were led by King Billy of Currabubula
and his dainty bride (I nearly called her
something else), two charming specimens
from Treacle's country. In fact, as he
appeared of the same hue, I think that he
has been keeping it dark where he does
come from. Anyhow, the show started with
a flock of Sparrows flying out of King
Billy's beard, and then we passed on to the
real thing.

First we had an opening chorus, " Silvery
Sea," by the assembled Nigs, followed by
the duet "Absent," rendered by Messrs.

Trundle and Jackson. Sleeman then wedged
in a gag on the W.A.A.G.S., which he fol-
lowed by a comic song.
♦ <e> *
Murphy, I hope, was speaking for himself
when he said " We'll get off and push."
Now to let you into a secret : Phillips and
Wilson wore out about at least two dozen
spoons and the contents of the same number
of bottles, before they became proficient in
their Mandolin and Bottle Duet. Treacle
(dressed up regardless of expense) here
interposed with a gag re racing (the writer
is not conversant with the latest racing
matters, so will let him off this time).
King Billy, who was next on the list, in-
formed us that he and his lubra had just
dropped in for a chat, but whether he was
chatting the chat, or whether I was too far
away I don't know, as his latter remarks
were unheard by me. The " Swannee
River " by Phillips, with the diggers helping
in the chorus, went with a swing. A gag on
1 sharp, by Head and the pianist was fairly
original, and was followed by "Are you from
Dixie ? " helped out in the chorus by the
boys, and the first part ended with " In the
Evening by the Moonlight" and "Hop
Along, Sister Mary," after which the com-
pany disappeared, to be heard a few minutes
later by such things as popping corks, and
Treacle's voice saying : "A pint for mine,
and did I ever tell you about those gins,
etc."
<s> 4- ❖
It was a pity that the band couldn't com-
pete with the wind, but the diggers appre-
ciated their attempts. The second part was
a replica of the first, and the show came to
an end with all hands singing "A Perfect
Day." The whole show was a credit to all
concerned and the boys showed their appre-
ciation with cheers.

Having emerged from the bathroom,
Sam was escorted to the banquet hall.

giving the appearance of many diamonds

the table, in the centre of which stood a huge
iced cake, marked in tiny sugar 5.9's 44 TO

Sam looked dazed and stared into space.

on which lay several Huntley & Palmer's

HOME.
There's a subtle sort of feelin's come
a-stealin' through the ship—
Just a feelin' of elation 'mong the boys ;
You can hear it in the chatter at the tables
and on deck—
Everybody seems to want to make a noise.
It's been gradually growing for the last six
weeks or more
Since we cleared Gibraltar. Everybody's
doin'
Up their leggin's and their boots we're
gettin' near our native shore—
And yesterday the ship passed by the
Leuwin.

See that ginger-headed digger grinnin'
wide from ear to ear ?
He's a Groper, and he goes ashore to-day.
You can reckon by next Tuesday he'll be
miles away from here
With his friends to listen while he has his
say.
The rest of us that stay aboard, have but a
week to go ;
The Brasseries work overtime a-brewin' ;
The fellows walk about the deck with grins
that seem to grow,
For yesterday, the ship passed by the
Leuwin !
There's lots of things to think of, looking
back the past four years—
There's friends we've known, and cobbers
who've gone' West;
We've struck a lot of countries and we've
met a lot of folk—
found the Blighty folks some of the
best. i
But these are all behind us—for the time at
least forgot ;
Along with gas, and cold, and shell, and
ruin ;
And everybody's thinkin' of his special
little spot—
For yesterday the ship passed by the
Leuwin !

THROUGH THE BARRAGE
By L. G. Taylor.
MY IMPRESSIONS AT PROYART.
The corporal buttonholes me gently but
firmly in a corner of the trench behind the
guns. " Flags, you'll be going forward
with the Major in the morning, taking the
director and stand. Leave here a half an
hour after Zero and you'll not come back."
This to me does not presage annihilation, as
would seem from the final few words, but,
as I know from previous experience, this
job means crawling out from my dug-out
at dawn (Zero hour), I pack and sling my
scanty kit round me (my bed consists of an
" Dropshort " Cannon sang " I Knew it
was Going to be Wet," in a dry way that
tickled the house to death, and " Mad
Carew," by MacLauchlan, was recited with
a dramatic intensity that held the audience
with Mack in this tragic piece to the end.
The Boss Rambler sang us " Thora " in
good style and " Usey " Hughes used his
strong voice to good effect in Tosti's " Good-
bye."
"Spud" Murphy ragged with "Twice
Up " Head through "Are You from Dixie,"
in quick time, with the real Yankee touch,
and Piper Ross piped us through a number
of popular melodies. The show reflects
great credit on the organiser and promoter,
Charlie Ratford, and was one of the best
that has been put on the ship so far, and the
playing of the selections by the Orchestra
was fine throughout the evening, and we
hope to hear this popular company again in
the near future.

Our job (notice the " our ") is to select a

out their " lines of fire." To do this necessi-

the Huns' barrage is thudding down, trying
blindly and futilely to check our boys.

of our guns behind us, thundering their
support to the infantry. Leaping old

wire entanglements, tripping over tele-
phone wire concealed by the long rank
grass in the deserted meadows, we push on
past men going forward with stretchers, and
little groups of scared prisoners coming
back. These latter, tangible proofs of the
success of our attack, hearten us greatly.
A few hundred yards journey and we en-
counter the advance guards of what we have
been watching with ill-concealed appre-
hension for some time —the Hun barrage—
all " heavy stuff " too. We barge into the
strafed zone, shells tearing down seemingly
at our feet! There's a batch of dejected
Huns going rearwards in charge of a
diminutive Aussie ; they're bobbing auto-
matically every few seconds. We don't.
We can't very well, with Fritz watching us.
Down come the shells with a hissing whistle.
Bursting with a thunderous crash, throwing
up immense clouds of dirt, flame and
smoke ; the flying fragments whizz out from
the bursts, sometimes two to three hundred
yards. Then it's fling yourselves to the
ground, here's another, and it's coming our
way, our experienced ears tell us. The
sound of its passage—this heavy steel mes-
senger of death —is a whine of eagerness to
destroy, growing in volume as it rushes
towards us with a loud roar. Then a pon-
derous tearing crash, five yards away —a
fountain of earth flung skywards, and the
whine and hum of jagged pieces. Some are
big enough to cut a man in halves or make
no larger hole than a bullet. They hum like
bees over our backs, however, and we rise
to walk on quickly, nerves are highly strung
and all are distinctly " nervy."
Under present conditions of making war,
with death coming invivsible out of the
skies, this is considered natural and un-
avoidable.
4> <s>
A man is considered game when he con-
ceals his nervousness and carries on.

These shells are a later ingenious idea of
the Huns—that is, mixing gas with his high
explosive. Not content to spray the vicinity
with death-dealing metal fragments, they
belch out gas to choke the wounded and
survivors alike.
Our party are now through the barrage,
and collapse, rather than jump, into a
trench, gasping, sneezing and choking, and
fumble for our masks. No sooner on than
the great desire is to tear them off for
breath, but by an effort of will we keep them
on, and suck in the filtered and purified air.
The gas from the shells which has been
laying around, an invisible but efficient
cloud, is soon dispersed by the breeze, and
though we can see no evidence of its depar-
ture, a few cautious sniffs re-assure us, and
feeling much better for the respite, we push
on forward.

On arrival at the new position, our job is
soon got through and we are soon the spec- -
tators of our guns rolling up through a now
very fitful shell fire, swinging round and
firing on the retreating Hun.

" Hacking Cough."
Sir, —I am sorry to find that I went to the
trouble of noticing your gibes. Since the
last issue was published I have had the
ship's valuer in your establishment to see
what would be the amount I could claim
with some chance of receiving enough to
cover my court expenses. Herewith a copy
of his report :
Dear Sir, —As a regular subscriber and
reader of your journal, would you grant me
a few lines of your most valuable space to
bring to the notice of your numerous readers
the disgusting state of immorality which
exists on this ship.
The subject I would bring to your notice
is the dress during the mild weather we have
been experiencing of late. It is no un-
common sight to see some gentlemen
parading the promenade, saloon and boat
decks dressed in a pair of shorts and hat.
In fact, whilst at lunch and dinner on several
occasions I have seen gentlemen sit down in
the various messes, not only without a coat,
but likewise a shirt.

Sir, —Acting under your instructions I

On the 4th inst., whilst crossing the line,
it was a regular sight to see gentlemen,
after having been in the water four or five
times, exercising in an absolutely nude
condition.
Yours faithfully,
J. Blank.
In passing, I am pleased with the compli-
ment paid to me in the fact that I would be
some use to my country if I were dead.
Other people whom I could name are of no
use either dead or alive.

This state which at presents exists is no
more or less than disgusting, and I make
this appeal in hopes that you will be able to
bring about some remedy, and in the mean-
time I must appeal to the offenders' own
conscience and ask for the sake of the fairer
sex on this liner that they will in future use
a little more consideration in the matter of
dress.

THE JORDAN VALLEY—Part 3.
By A. J. Fawley, 7th L.H.
4- 4> 4
THE Valley is rich in religious historical
associations. The writer does not
claim to be conversant with such, but
no description of the Jordan Valley, how-
ever superficial it may be, would be com-
plete without reference to this fact. The
scriptures tell us that Moses completed his
great trek through the wilderness at a point
on the hills of Moab, from which he could
see the vast panorama of the Promised
Land—a land, however, that he was not
destined to enter. Joshua takes up the
leadership from this point and with the Ark
of the Covenant carried by some of the High
Priests, proceeding on before, crossed the
Jordan River, it is believed, close to where
it opens out into the Dead Sea. He then
marched on Jericho, to do battle against the
inhabitants of that town. He found it well
prepared against his coming, whereupon
he caused all his trumpeters to be gathered
together and instructed them to march
round the walls of Jericho, blowing their
trumpets until the walls fell.
4> 4> ❖
The scripture asserts that the walls were
brought down in this way, and we are not
quite so sceptical about it now that we have
had experience of trumpets and trumpeters.
The Crusaders also went to Jericho in
olden time, but their wall razing, we venture
to submit, would have been more substan-
tial—battering rams would have been more
to their purpose, as in our day Bin. high
explosive was to the Turk.
"Jericho Jane," to give one of Jacko's
guns the name that some wag, with a fond-
ness for alliteration, had given it (perhaps a
relative of the man who christened Beachy
Bill) was a vast improvement to the trum-
pet, or even the battering ram, for wall
razing. And if the spirit of one of Joshua's
trumpeters, and an old Crusader, could
have been called into being while " Jericho
Jane" was throwing her weight about at
Jericho, across some eighteen miles of
intervening space, I guess they would have
been considerably astounded and would
have lost no time in resuming their ethereal
condition as spirits, feeling that safety
consisted only in being a wraith —the less
substantial the better.
<s> <e> ❖
There are three monastries in the Valley.
One is perched like an eagle's erie half way
up the steep side of the Mount of Temptation
(which mount was the one on which Christ
was supposed to have been tempted by the
Devil) and overlooks Jericho at its feet.
The second is on the river near where John
the Baptist was supposed to have baptised
Christ, while a third is situated near the
Dead Sea. All three belong to the Greek
Orthodox Church, and a few monks con-
tinued to live in them all the time we were
there, despite the fact that the War was
going on around them.
From St. John's Mount, looking towards
Jerusalem, two spires can be seen away in
the high distance, cutting sharply against
the sky. These are well worth mentioning,
as from a philosophical point of view they
seem to represent two great influences in
the world of to-day—or rather, of yesterday.

The one on the left, which is more graceful
than the other, and rises to a more ambitious
point, is the spire of the Church of Ascen-
sion, which church is built on the highest
part of the Mount of Olives, and the other,
half a mile away from the first, is the spire
surmounting the Kaiser's Palace. The one
is to represent the Ascension of Christ to
heaven, and so is symbolical of man's
ambition for a place in the next world, the
other was meant to be a monument to th#
Kaiser's dominion and power over this
world, and may be said to be symbolical of
man's ambition (unbridled it was in the
Kaiser's case) for power and dominion,
which may be said to rest in the soul of
every man.
In conclusion, let me mention that the
atmosphere is capable of quite infernal
suggestions and with a little effort of the
imagination it is possible to conjure up
visions of devils, witches, and all manner of
diabolical personalities. So writers have
expressed the opinion that the ill-fated
cities of Sodom and Gomorrah once stood
where now is the bottom of the Dead Sea.
It is easy to reason thus, because the general
aspect suggests volcanic disturbances of
quite a colossal character, and the very soil
suggests fire and brimstone. And so Dante,
in writing his Inferno might have gained
color for his weird conceptions from a study
(of the atmosphere) in the
Jordan Valley. L- '

It has been a sensational week on 'change,
quite a number of companies closing down
and the remainder preparing to make the
final plunge, owing to the persistent rumors
of this populous town of Port Hacking
having to be evacuated owing to the military
situation.
Roulette et Cie, having finally closed down
after paying to shareholders one-quarter
centime in the pound. Poker Metallurgique
Prop. Ltd., are packing their machinery
away ready for the final clearance, and that
quiet smooth-working company, Twiceup
& Company, are preparing for the final
coup, before evacuating this war-smitten
sphere for fresh grounds to work on, and we
believe that they will start on a bigger scale
in the near future.
That well-known firm, House Mortgage
Building Society are preparing their final
dividends, and the directors will take a
well-earned rest on the remains of the
capital that will accrue after the final clear-
ance and the large profits they have made
out of their war contracts.

We have received, per Wireless, the
abridged prospectus of the Mort Pelbourne
Slavage and Restoration Company, and
they propose to buy the remains of Port
Hacking and restore it to something new.
They are specialising in the taking of
Khaki Sea-kits and remaking them into
fashionable suits for soldiers returning
from the war ; the renewing of ship's shoes
and selling them as sand shoes at Manly,
Coogee, Brighton, Aspendale, Cottesloe,
Henley Beach, Wynham and St. Kilda.
Also the revulcanising of pricked con-
sciences, the repairing of broken morals,
and the remodelling of Blighty Yarns for
married men.

This Company have engaged as chief of
their sales department that well-known
and successful bagman Wells, whose strik-
ing style, combined with a strong director-
ate should make this company a huge suc-
cess, and we advise our readers, now the
war is finished, to invest any spare cash in
this project, as it will be more profitable
than letting it lie in Whisky at lOd. per nip.

AS announced in a preceding issue of
the " Cough," I am appending the
only known authentic solution of
this most baffling mystery of the high seas.
4- 4~
Before setting out my data, etc., I would
like to acknowledge the receipt of the solu-
tions by two readers which were published
in our last issue and therein commented
upon. •
<s> 4> «*■
Now to get on with my task. After the
discovery of the barque—derelict on the
high seas—the story aroused much interest
and speculation all over the world, especi-
ally among seafaring folk. A full account
was then published in a leading English
magazine. This in time elicited a reply
from, of all people, a Cambridgeshire
clergyman. His letter disclosed the fact
that a good number of years ago, not long
after the date of the "Marie Celeste's"
strange adventures, a seafaring man, about
to set out on a long voyage, deposited his
valuables including diary, etc., with the
cleric. These he stowed away and, his own
affairs engrossing him, the incident was
temporarily forgotten. Then he happened
to read the magazine abovementioned, also
the Editor's request for solutions to the
mystery.
He bethought himself of the papers left
by the sailor who had mentioned at the time
that his last ship was the " Marie Celeste."
Under the circumstances, the clergyman
thought himself justified in producing the
diary for publication.
4> <e> ❖
The story revealed by the perusal of the
diary is as follows : From the time of em-
barkation at New York the captain was
" funny." The ship was a good one, sea-
worthy, and only recently refitted. The
crew was small, as became the size of the
vessel, and the usual " happy-go-lucky "
crowd of seamen. The captain's wife and
child accompanied him on the voyage. He
being part owner, this was quite within his
prerogative.
4> 4 4-
The child, a flaxen-haired boy of five or
six, soon endeared himself to the rough
crew. His happiest pastime was playing
" skipper." Not content with his miniature
quarter-deck, he demanded a bridge
whereon he could act the captain properly.
The crew, who would have done anything
for the " baby," as they called him, ob-
tained permission, and constructed a light
model ship's bridge, which they placed
across the bows as the most suitable place.
This the child delighted to play on. None

As before stated, there were no ropes
dangling from the side, the swimming
match being the result of a wild impulse.
The ship's sides presented a high smooth
wall and sharks being abundant, the end can
be conjectured.
<e> <s> <s>
The sole survivor, as he claims to be,
supported himself on the wreckage of
" baby's bridge," and a light breeze spring-
ing up, the ship drifted far away, he being
eventually picked up. Being of an ignorant
and unimaginative type, the seaman kept
his knowledge to himself, fearing he would
not be believed, etc. And the famous
mystery remained as such till the recent
disclosure.
L. G. T.
The captain's ill-humour, which had been
growing worse all the voyage, culminated
on the fateful morning at breakfast time.
The sea was a dead calm and had been so
for days past. At breakfast the captain's
manner was provocative, the mate being the
butt of his caustic comments. In spite of
the efforts of his wife to calm him, the
skipper became more and more truculent
and ended by challenging the mate to a swim
round the ship, which was then becalmed.
4 4 4
To humor him the mate agreed and the
captain brooking no delay, they arose from
the table and were soon in the water swim-
ming. All at once the cry of " Shark " was
set up. Everyone below rushed up on deck
and, as happens in the face of disaster, each
thought of his most treasured possession—
the woman her child, and the navigating
officer the log-book and chronometer—and
took them up on deck. " They're round by
the bows " came the cry and all the little
company of distracted people rushed for'ard
and climbed on to the best vantage point to
see—baby's bridge. All pressed to the side
where the captain was in difficulties, with
the natural result that the temporarily fixed
" bridge " canted and shot the whole crowd
into the water, the bridge following.
OUR ORCHESTRA.
By 'Cello.
4 4 4
The " Port Hacking " Symphony Or-
chestra have played selections at every con-
cert that has been held on this ship, in many
cases under great climatic difficulties.
4 4 4
Nothing that we can say will ever show
the appreciation that is felt among the
diggers for the hard work Corporal Mat-
thews and his men have done to try and
make this trip seem a little shorter, and
provide musical entertainment for the ship's
company.
4 4 4
On Wednesday they assisted the Medleys
at their concert, and put on a high-class
performance that was much appreciated by
the large audience. The selections of popu-
lar melodies were rendered in fine style.
The " Hacking Cough " March, composed
by one of the members of the orchestra,
Private W. F. Unsworth, was a great success
and the diggers applauded it so much that
they had to reply with an encore number.
We suggest to the leader, Cpl. Matthews,
that the Orchestra give us a musical treat
in the shape of an evening devoted solely to
the Orchestra, and feel sure that it would
be much appreciated by the troops on
board.
DEBATING SOCIETY.
4- 4- <s>
The Society held the third of their series
of debates on Friday, when the Returned
Soldiers' Association was the topic. The
talk centred round the necessity of having
an efficient organization capable of keeping
the rights and wants of the soldiers before
the public on their return to civil life. The
social side was also discussed, and some
interesting propositions were put forward,
and we feel sure that the object of these
debates (to bring before the troops on-
board this ship the problems that await us
at home) is being fully attained, and we
hope to hear many more discussions on the
problems that await us on our return.

The sporting season was continued on
Saturday the 11th, when a contest for
blindfolded boxers was put on, and a number
of wrestling bouts by the best exponents of
the art on board.
4-4 4-
WRESTLING.
Best two out of three falls.
The first bout was between Dvr. Taylor
(Vic.) and J. Baulkland (s.s. Port Hacking,
England).
Taylor won the first fall after a good
exhibition —Baulkland almost having his
man at one time with a half nelson, but
Taylor wriggled out with a half inch from
the mat to spare, and throwing right over,
got on top and levered his man to the mat.
4 4- 4
Baulkland got the second fall in quick
time, getting his man to the mat and Taylor
trying to back throw over his man, Baulk-
land caught him in the middle of the throw
and forced his opponent's shoulders to the
mat, making a fall each.
4 4 4
In the final bout, Taylor rushed his man
and then put up some fast work, Baulkland
showing great cleverness in defence, but
Taylor's great strength overpowered his
opponent, and he won the deciding fall.
4-4-4'
Dvr. Powell (Vic.) v. Sgt. Mackenzie.
The first fall went to Powell after some
very fast clever work ; Powell rushing his
man and went for the Flying Mare and Mac
cleverly evaded it and almost got his op-
ponent with a cross buttock, but Powell
cleared himself and got his man to the mat
and brought him over, the sergeant's lack
of condition telling at the finish.
<?> <•> 4>
Powell threw his man in good style after
a very clever bout, in which both lads
showed great cleverness both in attack and
defence, and we would like to see Mac train
and have another bout with Jimmy, and
feel sure it would be worth seeing.
Exhibition No-decision bout between
Bdr. Woods (N.S.W.) and Dvr. Taylor
(Vic.).
A clever bout right through, both men
showing every hold that is practised in the
strenuous art of wrestling ; also putting a
couple on the Referee —just for luck.

BLINDFOLD BOXING.
In this competition all the contestants
were blindfolded and put in various parts of
the ring, and on the gong sounding were to
search and knock out their elusive op-
ponents .
<e> <?>
Those well-known exponents of the fistic
art (Ron Wells, Bunny Smart, Skeeter
Hay ward, Treacle MacFarland, Darky
Taylor and Keogh) took part and one of the
most amusing day's sport that has been
seen on this trip was staged.
4- ❖ 4-
On the gong sounding, the contestants
came warily to the centre and Treacle sent a
bunch of uppercuts into the empty air ; then
a little more finessing and Ron Wells, hear-
ing a noise apparently, put in a couple of
heavy body punches, but there was no body
there ; then Hayward made a wild swing
and hit himself behind the ear and
nearly knocked himself out ; then
all the contestants met in a corner of the
ring unexpectedly, and in as many seconds
in an indescribable whirl of legs and arms,
Treacle, Ron, Hayward and Taylor were
down and out, leaving only Keogh and
Bunny to fight the finish.

bum looking for cigarette butts in the
gutter," and feeling carefully for his
man, and Smart doing the Battling Nel-
son smother every time he heard a noise ;
then they would back into each other, and
legs and arms flew in all directions ; break
and away again, Keogh touched the ropes
and uppercut, swung and straight lefted for
his life until he tumbled to it.
4 4 4
In the final round Bunny hit his man a
miss by miles, and then they met and
swinging wildly, Bunny accidentally got his
man, Keogh getting Bunny half a second
later, Keogh just reaching the boards a
fraction before his opponent, and Bunny
was declared the winner.
4 4 4
Cpl. Jackson dodged the wild swings and
uppercuts that were thrown round indis-
criminately and between whiles refereed
the contest in his usual capable manner.
4 4 4
INTERSTATE LEMON CUTTING.
On Tuesday the 15th, the sporting season
was continued, when a large number of
competitors took part in the Lemon Cutting
contest, before a large crowd. The con-
ditions being that the competitors were
blindfolded, turned three times round the
ring and were allowed three cuts at the
potato hanging from a line.
4 4 4
There were some very amusing stunts in
the first round, Murphy causing much
amusement when he lost his bearings and
made wild sweeps at the spectators with
his sword, and putting the wind up those
within reach.
4 4 4
Lambert slashed away at the empty air as
if all the Huns in the world were opposing
him, and Fowles, losing his bearings,
rushed forward each time until the spud
touched his face, when he jumped back,
parried, and cut for his life, but only the
empty air.
4 4 4
Sixteen were left in for the second round
and seven again scored one point, but Cpl.
Willis (22nd Battn., Vic.), won outright with
two points ; getting right on the spud he
made no error and put in two slashing cuts,
but missed with the third.
In the third round for second place, some
great cutting was put up, four of the con-
testants cutting their spud twice out of the
three tries.
4 4- 4
The contestants for the second place in the
final round all missed with the exception
of Sgt. Sherringham (sth Battery, Victoria),
and he, scoring one point, took second prize,
and this finished a fine afternoon's sport.
4 4 4
COCK-FIGHTING.
On Wednesday a series of cock-fighting
competitions was decided, conditions being
best two of three falls and if both fall, first
man mounted to win.
4 4 4
There were some good bouts in the first
round, especially the bout between Treacle
McFarland and Taylor against Keogh and
Icke, and after three hard willing tussles,
Treacle and his horse won the bout.
4 4 4
Ferguson and Lambert versus Powell
and his horse, was a very clever bout, both
jockeys employing every trick and Ferguson
and Lambert just got the verdict.
4 4 4
In the semi-finals Ferguson and Lambert
beat McFarland and Taylor after a good
scrap, the bouts being very even until the
deciding bout, which was won in a sudden
rush that swept Taylor off his feet.
4 4 4
Worle and Johnston won their first fall
against McNamara and Garsed, and the two
succeeding bouts being exceptionally even
and draws, Worle and Johnston were de-
clared the winners.
4 4 4
In the finals, Ferguson and Lambert won
in two straight falls, after some hard tussles,
both jockeys doing all sorts of back twists
to try and get the mastery.
4 4 4
Before the final round, a presentation
(collected from the sports on board, and one
from the Sports Committee) was made by
the Padre in a pleasant and complimentary
little speech, to the popular bosun, Mr. O.
Stephens, for his untiring work in the in-
terest of sport during the voyage.

Blunt End,
H.M.A.T. " Port Hacking,"
At Sea, 14.1 .'l9.
To the Editor,
" Port Hacking Cough,"
T.S. Port Hacking.
Dear Sir,—Permit me, through the
medium of your widely circulated news-
paper, to draw the attention of your readers
(not only those on this boat, but also the
many thousands who anxiously await your
daily wireless reports in all Australian
Commonwealth States) to a recently pub-
lished statement in a well-known Austra-
lian Journal.
In it I learned with surprise, and some
chagrin, that while Western Australia and
South Australia have generously offered to
all their " 1914 " soldiers returning on
leave, full facilities for travelling, free of
cost, to any part of their respective States
during their sixty days' leave, the other
States are only allowing a free warrant to
one destination, in addition to suburban
concessions.
4- 4- 4
We fully appreciate all that our States
have done, on our behalf, during our ab-
sence, and I feel sure that it is only necessary
to draw the attention of the proper authori-
ties to this matter to bring about the desired
result.
4- 4- 4-
May I, then, suggest to you, sir, that in
your next communication to the Common-
wealth Government this very natural desire
of the diggers will receive due ventilation ?
4- 4- <B>
In closing, permit me to express apprecia-
tion of the energy displayed by Queensland
agents in advertising to returning soldiers
on this boat the advantages of settling in
that State at the termination of the war.

We understand that all States are desirous
of holding their own soldiers within their
respective areas, but Queensland has led the
way in this instance, not only in holding her
own, but also in inducing men of other
States to settle within her boundaries.
Thanking you in anticipation,
Yours, etc.,

MEDLEY'S MANAGEMENT.
S.S. " Port Hacking,'
Monday, 13-1-19.
Dear Mr. Editor.
In your last issue of the " Hacking
Cough" reference is made to a concert
given last week by the Medleys under the
direction of Vic. Odgers.
May I be permitted to state, in all fair-
play, that it was directed and very success-
fully put over by S.-Sgt. Yeates, not me.
The credit is distinctly his.
(Sgd.) Vic. P. Odgers.
(We sincerely regret not having given
S.-Sgt. Yeates his full dues in the matter,
having believed Sgt. Odgers had taken over
the management of his popular company
again before this concert, and feel sure that
S.-Sgt. Yeates, knowing the great success
of his efforts, will forgive this error in our
criticism. —Ed.)

To the Editor. —Rumors are flying round
that you are shortly being closed down
(about time too), so taking all things into
consideration, I think it will be advisable
that this dispute between us should cease
forthwith, providing, of course, that you are
agreeable. I think that if we both promise
to provide each other with a gargle at Bel-
field's, or any other suitable estaminet, our
accounts ought to be settled, N'est ce pas.

The Editor
Sir, —On reading your last issue, I was
surprised to see in your Letter Box column
a complaint from a certain young lady (Miss
McGhee) onboard this excellent liner, and I
should like to know what right or authority
she has to interfere with the social standing
of the ship and why she was out of her
cabin at such an hour at night ?
Perhaps she had not been invited to this
ceremony and wrote her letter to your paper
in wrath.
Hoping you could give me some detail, 1
should be greatly pleased.
I am, yours truly,
The Silent Knight.

APPRECIATIONS.
Dear Mr. Editor.
On behalf of the " Medleys " I would like
to express keen appreciation for the genial
support afforded us by all aboard.
Your personal assistance (and that of
your staff) will not be forgotten—neither
will your faces, for when the " Hacking
Cough" makes its appearance from the
printers, all those who travelled aboard
D. 34 will be reminded for many years to
come of the worthy men who have worked
diligently and with marked ability to give us
a pleasing souvenir of our trip back to dear
old "Aussie." Good luck to you all for it!
Permit me to say that your reports on our
concerts have perhaps been a wee bit
" flowery," we can but hope that they were
merited. Personally, Ido not feel that I
deserve all the nice things you said of me.

I would like to say that a great deal of
musical support has been given by one of
the highly esteemed Medical Officers
aboard (Captain Nankervis). To find time,
between duties, to play our accompani-
ments and tutor us at rehearsals under
conditions far from pleasant, was quite a
sacrifice on the doctor's part, one which we
all feel deeply grateful for. Bert Cramp
also did a great deal for us in that direction,
in fact, his ability in accompanying has
helped very largely in pretty well all events
aboard where music has been conspicuous.
There are manjr names I'd like to men-
tion, but I feel that those who respond to
them feel as I do, i.e., that so long as our
humble efforts to entertain have been
appreciated—we are satisfied.
Yours faithfully,
Victor P. Odgers.

POST-WAR PROBLEMS.
By L. V. Worle.
-¥ 4- 4-
HOME PRODUCTS—No. 6.
WE have dealt with the various im-
portant industries of the Common-
wealth in our previous issues, and
now come to the last and greatest problem
of all, individual support for Australian
Manufactures.
We have shown previously the effect on
the various industries in the country, of the
importing craze that has held the vitals of
our manufacturing industries in its grip
during the past decade.
4- <s> 4-
The only way to fight this down is by in-
dividual efforts, our asking always for the
locally made goods, and not only asking,
but making certain that we get them. The
man who is going home to marry the fiancee
who is waiting anxiously there for you, see
that you build and furnish your home with
Australian timbers, grown and manufac-
tured in your own country ; see that
every bit of metal ware is made in our local
factories, that the clothes you wear are
Australian made ; in fact, that everything
you buy is purely Australian, and once
carrying out this resolution, stick to it,
and you will have done something towards
making this country of ours great.
The bachelor—it is your duty also to make
certain of getting the Australian made
article, and it is every man's duty, not only
to buy them himself, but educate the people
who do not, or will not know, so that they
may be converted to the excellence of the
locally manufactured products.
It is the individual effort that is going to
count and gradually make a united demand
for the Australian articles that will not be
denied : learn a point from our despised
enemy—Germany—and make every soul in
the country a canvasser for our factories and
industries.
When we have done that, we will be able
to hold our own everywhere, and the effects
will be far-reaching, in that we will be able
to supply the world's markets with the
manufactured article instead of the raw
material only.
<s> <s> <s>
We have been far away for four years ;
we have a broader outlook on life ; we have
seen for ourselves and know that our goods
are better than any other ; look at the jam
we have been issued with usually, and tell
me, would you not rather have the Austra-
lian goods ? So let us put our whole heart
and soul into it, and be in the forefront of
this great campaign to suppprt our local
industries and relegate this importing craze
to the place where it rightly belongs—the
garbage heap of Australian thought.
❖ 4-
Remember, every Australian article
bought is a spike in the guns of the big
importing interests, another pound in the
national exchequer, another man employed
in a trade, and another step towards the
ideals every true Australian has been fight-
ing for —to see this big country of ours
peacefully leading the world's greatest
nations in commerce.

DEBATINC SOCIETY.
A CHALLENGE debate between Mr.
Sims, our Y.M.C.A. Rep., and
R.Q .M.S. Kemp took place on Mon-
day night, under the auspices of the above
Society. The subject under discussion was
" Whether Total Prohibition of Alcoholic
Liquor would benefit the State and the
Individual," Mr. Sims taking the affirma-
tive, and R.Q.M.S. Kemp the negative.

-<e> 4- <s-
THE "Medleys" concert party, under
the capable direction of Sgt. Odgers,
S.-Sgt. Yeates and Cpl. Matthews, put
on a tip-top show on Wednesday night.
Mr. Sims opened the debate by outlining
the terrible effects on the population of the
drink traffic and that the average individual
cannot stop at moderation. The enormous
cost of the drink traffic being one-seventh
of the cost of the war during the same period,
and the example of the leading people of the
world in condemning its use during this
war. The enormous loss of working time
during this war through the evil effects of
drink and that the use of alcoholic liquor is
decreasing in hospitals in favor of milk and
other foodstuffs.
<e> <s> <e>
The Orchestra set the ball rolling with a
fine selection, " Round the Map," intro-
ducing cornet and violin solos with great
effect, and this fine orchestra excelled itself.

The company then tripped on the stage
and gave us a new and original chorus,
entitled " Some Show." Then Sleeman
" Shurrup " ed to his heart's content in his
own inimitable way that puts the house in a
good humor, and he replied with an encore
tale about not being able to keep his eye-
glass in his eye, in a comic way that kept the
audience roaring.
<e> ❖ <s>
R.Q.M.S. Kemp, in reply, emphasised the
need of moderation, but not prohibition, as
it interferes with the liberty of the subject,
and the average person was able to keep to
moderation. The issue of rum to the troops
and navy was absolutely essential to their
welfare and is not harmful to the general
mass, so why restrict the majority for a few
degenerates. The attitude of Christ and
Apostles towards drink in allowing it in
churches, was quoted as an argument that
the churches as a whole did not denounce it.
That prohibition meant more secret drink-
ing than there was when licenses were
allowed, and finally mentioned a humorous
story where a Temperance lecturer in a
Prohibition District asked for a pint flask
to illustrate his arguments ; on repeating
and saying that a quart would do, every
member of the audience handed one up.
Vic. Odgers soliloquised through a
" Cigarette," with great dramatic finish, to
a fine chorus effect by the company, and
A. B. Benham ragged his way through
" Samoa," to the appreciative plaudits of
the crowd, followed by the popular singer
J. H. Jackson, who sang " End of the Jour-
ney," using his fine powerful voice to good
effect. Then S.-Sgt. Yeates introduced us
to the " Indian Rag," with original music
by the orchestra and chorus that was very
popular with the troops, and it was SOME
rag.

Trundle rendered " Less than the Dust,"
in fine voice, and MacLauchlan recited the
" Dream Scene," from the Silver King, his
make up of Wilfred Denver being fine, and
he delivered this fine scene with a pathos
and dramatic tensity that was really fine.
Then the new Lady of the company, Bugler
Roscoe, sang " Blue Eyes " in a way that

comedy into his turns. Then Ross piped
while Steele danced the Hie'land Fling as a
good Hie'lander would after a few wee drap-
pies on a braw bricht nicht. Vic. Odgers
rendered "The Savage" in wild comic
fashion, dressed in rabbit skins and cocoa-
nut fibre, and " Some Automobile," by the
company with all properties, Sleeman in his
funny way steering them through the in-
tricacies of the stage, and S.-Sgt. Yeates
supplying the propellant with the chorus on
the exhaust by the whole company.

Charlie Ratford played " God Send You
Back to Me," on the cornet, with violin ob-
bligato by Cpl. Matthews, and the audience
joined heartily in the chorus and Sleeman,
Jackson, Odgers and Trundle gave us that
popular turn " Rallentando, Crescendo,

A specialty Hypnotism turn by Professor
Charles and his assistant Abdul was very
cleverly done : getting the mediums from
anywhere in the audience, he hypnotised
them and made them do all sorts of tricks,
including washing in a basin of flour, chas-
ing and killing imaginary bees and other
vermin, throwing nuts to monkeys, and
finally imitating brumbies on a buckjump-
ing stunt, and it was a decidedly clever and
original turn that was well appreciated by
the large audience.
The audience then joined with this
popular company in singing "Auld Lang
Syne," in anticipation of the disembarka-
tion of the Sand-gropers in the next couple
of days, and " God Save the King " brought
a very pleasant and successful evening to a
close.
Mention must be made of that fine pianist,
Cpl. Woods, who has played the accompani-
ments for most of the concerts during the
trip, and worked in a quiet, but efficient
way for the amusement of the troops during
this voyage.

"A speech without Words," a very clever

Ratford, who has worked very hard in get-
ting the shows going and deserves all the
success he has attained. All the old artists
appeared and sang their songs in fine style,
and a new discovery, Fireman Murphy, of

clever, and brought forth tumultuous
applause from the large audience.

❖ *
44 The Medleys " Concert Party gave us
the final concert of the season on Tuesday
the 21st, under the capable management of
Vic. Odgers, and being near the end of the
voyage it was made a request night, and all
the old favourites of the company sang,
recited and danced their most popular turns
in their usual accomplished way, and a few
new turns were put on, including songs by
Captains Nankervis and Cottell, and our
popular Padre, Captain Redhead, a fine
selection on the mandolin by C. Wilson, a
song by Mr. Nathaniel well rendered, a good
turn by our Y.M.C. Acker, Mr. Sims, and a
stump speech by Boyes.
4 4 4
At the conclusion of the finishing chorus,
44 Auld Lang Syne " was sung by the party
and large audience, in anticipation of the
parting in the next couple of days, and
44 God Save the King " finished a show in
which this popular company and tuneful
orchestra excelled themselves.
4 4- 4
The whole of these concerts reflect great
credit on the promoter, Vic. Odgers and
S/Sgt. Yates and their able assistants,
who have worked so hard for the amuse-
ment of the troops during this voyage.
GOOD-BY-EE.
4 4 4
A SHAKE of the hand, a terse good-bye
and some of the pals who have been
through four years of Anzac and
muddyFlanders,are gone—perhaps forever.
Everybody happy, smiling faces everywhere,
for it is the first sight of the homeland and
the realization of our dreams of four long,
weary years ; soon we will all be going our
devious ways, and perhaps never see each
other's faces again, for our roads in most
cases lead far apart.
4> 4> +
But we will still have our thoughts,
memories well worth treasuring—think of
it, memories of a pal who helped you when
yoA were knocked ; gave you half his last
fag, and whose every belonging he shared
with you—the eternal brotherhood in a new,
rough form, but none the less sincere, come
to give us a bigger and broader outlook on
life, and make us for all time pals.
Well, Sand-gropers, we saw you go off
on the long, long, trail, and the occasion was
too big for noise, but you know what we
feel—it's in our hearts alright, only we
couldn't express it.

We know you'll make good in the future
as you have done in the past ; the ideals we
fought together for are very near realization
now and our job is finished ; all that re-

sometimes happy, but always of a duty done
and of cobbers who were with you in the
doing. So Good-bye with the best of luck
to you all and hopes of a meeting sometime

Six o'clock came and Mark was ready.
Going up to the parade ground he fell in
with eight of his mates who were waiting
for the Orderly Officer to inspect them.

MARK TIME had just arrived in the
city from way out back. Being the
early spring, the city began to
look bright and busy, but these things Mark
did not notice. He had not come to the city
for amusement's sake, nor yet for a holiday.
War had broken out, and Mark, hearing the
call for men, at once volunteered. Hence
his arrival in the city—to go into camp,
Mark sat alone for a while. His shift was
from 2 a .m. to 4 a .m. Strange things passed
through his mind. Things that might pos-
sibly happen in the night. He had read in
the daily papers of German spies and their
doings. Supposing they molested him
during his watch ! These things he knew
were not impossible, so he made up his

mind to be ready.

Two o'clock came and Mark was marched
out to his post, which extended from an
opening in the fence to the butcher's shop.
4 4- 4
Mark was put in a tent along with a dozen
others who had arrived in camp that morn-
ing. They were a decent lot except for one—
a burly fellow by name of Jones—a thorough
scoundrel, and a rough Australian gentle-
man.
4 4 4
Armed with a trenching tool handle he
paced up and down his beat. There was no
moon, and the was inky black, making
it almost impossible to see more than a
yard ahead. All went well for an hour, then
Mark heard a movement in the vicinity of
the butcher's shop. He stopped and lis-
tened, but heard nothing more. A breeze
had sprung up and perhaps a piece of loose
timber or something had rattled, so he took
no more notice till a few minutes later he
heard the noise again, decidedly louder.
Again he stopped and listened. The noise
continued. All sorts of things passed
through his mind. Mark crept a little

But Mark took no notice of him, and made
up his mind to keep to himself, doing his
work most conscientiously and in a soldier-
like manner.
4 4 4
Detailed for duty, he did not grumble, but
performed it, no matter how hard or dirty
it may have been.

A week had passed and Mark was growing
more accustomed to his work. He did his
parades and learnt a little in the use of a
rifle.
closer . . . and the noise in the but*
cher's shop continued. His mind was made
up. It must be a spy trying to poison the
meat that was stored within for the troops !
Should he wake the Sergeant of the Guard ?
No ! He would capture the culprit himself !
4 4 4
At dinner time one day, the Orderly
Sergeant came round, and Mark was warned
to mount guard that evening at 6 o'clock.
That meant the afternoon off for him to get
cleaned and have everything ready.
4 4 4
The noise inside grew louder, as if car-
cases were being moved, and Mark, creep-
ing still closer, roared out : " Halt! Who
4 4 4
goes there ?"
Uniforms not yet being on issue, Mark
had to clean up his old suit a bit, the trousers

After our experiences of over four years
in the greatest war that the world has ever
known, Padre Redhead came amongst us
as our guide and spiritual adviser during
our voyage "Homeward Bound." He soon
exhibited those rare qualities of closely
associating himself with matters of interest
to the humblest " digger," while, at the
same time, displaying with unusual tact, a
breadth of mind and undoubted ability to
deal with those opposed to spiritual matters,
or men of higher culture. Padre Redhead
has proved himself a " man's " man with a
wide knowledge of the various phases of
human nature, and we feel that we cannot
allow him to leave us without expressing
our sincere gratitude for his many services,
not only in the interests of our spiritual
welfare, but also our bodily needs.

now wishing him 44 Au revoir," we will have

clergyman. Napoleon harshly said that if
a soldier was not a bad man he must be
made one. In this he meant that the finer
qualities of a man s nature must be brushed
aside, the softening and refining influences
of more tender years must be obliterated ;
he must, in fact, be transformed into a being

S.S. Port Hacking,
22-1-19.
To The Troops on H.M.A.T. " D. 34."
It is with mingled feelings I come to bid farewell to the " 1914 " personnel on board
this ship ; joy that we are about to be re-united once more to our families after our four
years' separation ; regret that the many pleasant associations formed during this voyage
home have now to cease.

Before saying good-bye, I would like to voice my appreciation of the different people
who have contributed so much to the success of our trip. The members of the Concert
Party who have entertained us so charmingly on many pleasant evenings, the Sports
Committee who have carried out such a varied programme of events, the Debating Society,
coupled with the names of our Padre, Captain Redhead, and our Y.M.C.A. Representative,
Mr. Sims, also the Staff of the Ship's Paper. We are all looking forward to receiving the
paper in book form and will prize it as a delightful souvenir of the voyage home. And
now, in bidding good-bye to you, I would like to thank all ranks for their splendid and
soldierly conduct during the trip—it is quite in keeping with your great record during the
past four years.
The Officers appreciate the manner in which various duties have been carried out,
the good feeling that exists between all ranks has made their task a light one.
I wish you all good-bye and the very best of luck.
E. O. WILLIAMS,
Captain, O.C. Troops.
To The Officers, N.C.O.'s, and Men of
H.M.A.T. " D. 34 " Port Hacking.
Dear Comrades,
Your Editor, Sergeant Sherringham, has granted to me space in this souvenir
edition of the " Port Hacking Cough," to say au revoir, and now I find it extremely difficult
to express my real sentiments to you all ; but, firstly, I must convey to the members of the
"Medleys," "The Kolombo Koon Kompany," the Staff of the Ship's Paper, and the
Orchestra, my very grateful thanks and appreciation of their splendid and successful
efforts to interest, amuse, and consequently increase the " esprit de corps " of the troops
on board.
Throughout the whole of our voyage the spirit, conduct, and earnest desire to assist
shown by all ranks, has been such that it is well worthy of men who represent a portion
of the remnant of the original Anzacs who, during the past four and a half years have made
the name of the Australian Army as a fighting unit second to none.
I wish to thank you all for the assistance given to me at all times in my various
duties as Adjutant, and now, Comrades, accept from me my best wishes for your'future
happiness, the best of good luck and good health.
Au revoir !
NORMAN LUCAS,
Lieut, and Adjt.,

" Hacking Cough."
Sir, In your last issue I was pleased to note the well merited articles concerning the
kindly efforts of our Padre, Captain Redhead, and Mr. Sims, Y.M.C.A. Representative,
to lessen the tedium of what otherwise might have been a rather monotonous trip, and would
like to voice the sentiments of the Troop Deck, who unanimously vote these two gentlemen
as sports.

But I crave space in your journal on this, the eve of disembarkation, to express on
behalf of the said Troop Deck the appreciation we all feel at the treatment we have received
at the hands of the O.C. Troops, Captain Williams and his Officers, who have done all in
their power to make the trip as enjoyable as possible for us.
It seems there has been no little amount of ill-treatment, both as regards insufficient
accommodation and bad food, meted out to soldiers returning to Aussie per troopship,
and it behoves us all to give as wide a publicity as we may to the really enjoyable trip
afforded us, the " 1914 " men returning on furlough per the " Port Hacking."
We cannot dwell too long upon the excellent food rations, in both its quantity and
quality, the numerous comforts supplied by the Red Cross and Comforts Funds, and the
Y.M.C.A., nor can we say too much to thank each and every one of those responsible for
the arrangements made for us.

The cleanliness of the troop deck and the utter absence of illness are praises in them-
selves for Major Goldsmith and his medical staff, while we all fully appreciate his efforts
to obviate unnecessary quarantine on our arrival in Melbourne, by thoroughly spraying
and disinfecting all the kit on board.
In conclusion, I defy any digger in the Commonwealth to say he has had an equally
comfortable and enjoyable trip during any period of the War !

THE QUARANTINE
QUESTION.
By A. Digger.
4- 4- 4>
WELL, we've been doing nose dives
and abdominal crashes for four
years and a half now, and Thursday,
the 22nd inst., was the final and worst one
of all we landed on our stomachs with a
bounce and a splash that was heard as far
away as Melbourne.
4- 4- 4-
Every man got up in the morning with a
happy, expectant look on his face, and Kiwi,
razors and soap were flying in all directions.
At last every man arrived on deck looking
spick and span and ready for the great day.
The Port Phillip Heads hove in sight and at
last we passed through to the Quarantine
Station, and there the great crash came.
<s> 4- 4-
The Quarantine people came aboard,
their faces covered with protective masks,
and pronounced the verdict —in Portsea for
four long days. A meeting was convened
and the complaint sent through to the
proper authorities, and received the official
reply that suspicious cases were on board.
Where they got the information from no one
knows, for tW ship had reported "All well "
since the 9th January, and yet they placed
us in Quarantine before we arrived, so
probably a little bird whispered it to the
official mind.
Then the blankets had been handed in,
so a request was sent for the loan of new
ones, and the great official mind sent this
wonderful reply :—No blankets could be
/supplied owing to the danger of infection,
and they had not enough to supply us. We
can understand that if they did not have the
blankets we could not get them, but in the
first part of the official reply it apparently
did not matter about the danger of infecting
poor diggers with dirty blankets —they had
been risking their lives off and on for four
and a half years, and another risk or two
wouldn't matter to them !
We all realize the necessity of keeping the
dread Influenza out of Australia, and would
willingly spend three weeks in quarantine
if we were certain it was necessary, but when
a ship is reported clean by our Medical
Officers and also at the station on arrival,
well, we think after the time we have been
away we deserve a little more considerate
treatment, and suggest that a ship is exam-
ined before she is quarantined, as we were,
a week before we arrived in the home port.
The officials also came aboard and pro-
nounced our spraying room (erected under
Admiralty supervision) as not sufficiently
air-tight. They then brought off and
erected a ramshackle canvas spraying shed
of their own, with holes that a man could
climb through in the walls ; even a layman
could see the absurdity of it, and after the
place was erected they found the ship's
room the best, and used it in preference to
their own.
THE PORT HACKING
FISHERIES.
By The Chief Inspector.
In making my annual report of the Fish-
eries I must go over the whole of the dis-
tricts, including the New Fishing that has
started aft.
I started my tour from the pointed end
for'ard on the Port side, and strolling, saw
many diggers with lines varying from a
trout bobbing strength up to a hawser,
gazing with a rapt expression at the sea,
and at last came to a big sixth battalion
sergeant, with his back hunched and his feet
firmly planted, hanging on for his life, and
on looking over the side I saw a fish fully
ten feet long making for the Heads at 900
miles an hour, when, with a twang like a
ship's cable parting, the line broke and the
tiny sergeant fell with a crash. When he
rose I spoke sympathetically to him, but he
just murmured sadly, " It's not my line,"
and departed.


I strolled on and at the blunt end came on
Murphy. He was playing with his line with
the artistic finish of Lord Vere de Vere
landing a salmon trout, and at last brought
up a huge flathead, weighing fully a quarter
of a pound to within a few feet of the deck,
when slither, and away went Murphy's only
hope and he retired disconsolately, to carry
on with his ordinary duties, with no pros-
pects of a fish tea.
♦ ♦ 4-
The whole of the fisheries seem to be
thriving, and I'm sure that if we put a net
across the heads and swept the bay from
top to bottom, we would be assured of a
supply that would last this populous district
at least one meal.
FUMIGATION.

Strikeme ! I never larfed so much in orl
me life as wen ther Qorrinteen blokes
brort off their ole sprayin' room ter put on
ther ole boat insted of our own dinkum
shed, ther diggers orl 'elpin' ther 'eads ter
git it up over ther side.
<s> 4- 4-
An' then wen they started ter put it up,
ther old shanty 'ud 'ardly stan' on its pins,
but at larst they got it up and started ter
cover ther bloomin' show and wen they put
ther canvas on, cripes ! I thort I'd bust
larfin' 't ther idear, yer cud see 'oles orl
over ther place an' sum 'f 'em biggeren a
bloke cud get his head through.
4 4 4*
At larst ther 'eads were reddy an' started
orf on ther job and ther first mob was put
through ; ther ole shed 'ud 'old about fifty
orl told, an' after a hundred and fifty 'ud
gone in an' passed out ther other end,
the quorrinteen bloke sed thet'll do, it must
be crowded now, and wun 'f ther mob inside
sed thers plenty 'f room yet, Joe ! So 'e let
a few more in, an' then Woodsie an' a few
more poked ther 'eads out thro ther 'oles
jest ter show ther was no ill-feelin'.
Well, ther first mob got thro ther ten
minutes at larst, an' ther bloke went in ter
fill up ther mixture jugs agen and their was
all ther mob playin' two-up in ther center
and no fumes, or nothink ter worry 'em,
Blimey ! didn't the mob roar !

An' down a bit further, at the ole joint as
should a bin used, our ole Doc. was puttin'
some more thro an ther blokes 'ud come out
splutterin' like 'ell, gettin' ther dinkum
stuff all ther time, I tells yer, these guv-
ment blokes lick me, never seem ter see
any think at orl. Why anyone cud see wif arf
an eye thet ther joint put up by the Admir-
alty licked their ole shanty outer sight,
but not ther 'eads, they were satisfied ter
put ther ole shanty up an' make a bit more
money out'f the pore taxpayers' pocket, an'
it mite keep ther influenza out, tho I 'ave
