THANK-OFFERING FOR VICTORY AND PEACE
FOREWORD.
On St. Martin’s Day, 1918, there came to us one of
the rarest moments in human experience. The war was
ended. Victory was given. We were lifted to the
heights. Thankfulness travailed to find issue in thanks-
giving. Our hearts were ready for any demand.
Rare moments are given us to lift us to the heights
that we may see a great vision and walk and work upon
the mountains of God. The rare must become the con-
stant, but not the commonplace. Thanksgiving must have
its rightful end in the unforgetting gratitude of never-
failing service.
To some of us who were with the forces, there were
three glad springs of thankful joy. We thanked God that
the sacrifice of young and precious lives was ended. Day
by day we had been losing our best friends. Now at
last the slaughter was ended.
Then there was the unspeakable thankfulness that
the manifestly evil cause, as we had seen it face to face,
had not been permitted to triumph. Not in vain had such
Immensity of sorrow been borne.
Further, there was thanksgiving for a mighty oppor-
tunity. Now the world was set free for us; now we could
serve in unforgetting thankfulness. There could be no
other worthy use of life after this great experience, but to
apply its final energy in unremitting service.
A new day was breaking, our friends had passed while
it was yet night. We were to pass out into the new day
wherein so to work that their sacrificial service should
not be in vain.
There is but one worthy monument for us to raise, the
monument of a new world, a world of love and service, a
world won for Christ.
As it has been impossible to verify all quotations, the
compiler wishes to state that they have been set up in the
form in which they were received.
In November (Armistice month) the extracts are spec-
ially chosen as tributes to the men who won for our
Empire Victory and Peace.

Is sure a noble anchor.

Bound by gold chains about the feet of God.

Blow out, you bugles, over the rich dead!
There’s none of these so lonely and poor, of old,
But dying, has made us rarer gifts than gold.

Of work and joy, and that unhoped serene,
That men call age; and those who would have been
Their sons, they gave, their immortality.

That every Man in Arms should wish to be.

In life, not death, speak kindly; living hearts need
sympathy.

which you can pour the energies of your soul for
God and the service of the people. To live for
others bring the greatest happiness and the highest
good.

Happiness is not in strength, or wealth, or power,
or all three. It lies in ourselves, in true freedom,

peace, and the even flow of life, even in poverty,
exile, disease, and the very valley of the shadow of
death. — Epictetus.

deavour to avoid it.— Thucydides.

From God, who is our home. — Wordsworth.

WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 27.

The oaks of the mountains fall;
The mountains themselves decay with years.
The ocean shrinks and grows again;
The moon herself is lost in heaven;

When thunder rolls and lightning flies,
Thou workest in thy beauty from the clouds,
And laughest at the storm.

TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 2
I with uncovered head
Salute the sacred dead

Beside the one gift worth it all:
The one good thing from pole to pole,
Is called Simplicity of Soul. — Phillips.
TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 9.
We that have seen the strongest cry like a beaten
child,
The sanest eyes unholy—the cleanest hands defiled;
We that have known the heart blood less than the
the lees of wine,
We that have seen men broken, we know that man
is divine. — Hodgson.
WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 10.
All day the loud wind cries, the clouds unroll,
But to the cloud and wind I say, “Be still!"

— Tynan.
SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 13.

ones,
Though their joys were shadows —do they miss so
much ? —Rosaleen Graves.
SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 14.

Who dies if England live ? — Kipling.

Unto each man his handiwork, unto each his crown.
The just fate gives;
Whoso takes the world’s life on him and his own
lays down,
He, dying so, lives. — Swinburne.


TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 16.
We know—it is our deathless pride!
The splendour of his first fierce blow;
How reckless, glorious, undenied,
He stormed those steel-lined cliffs we know,
And none who saw him scale the height,
Behind his reeking bayonet blade.
Would rob him of his title-right—
“ The bravest thing God ever made.”— Ogilvie.

Their mighty arms — Wilkinson.

It’s new England as I fights for,
It’s an England swep’ aht clean,
An England where we’ll see the things
Our eyes ’ave never seen;
Decent wages, justice, mercy,
And a chance for ev’ry man,
For to make ’is ’ome an’ ’eaven,
If ’e does the best he can.
It’s that better, cleaner England,
Made o’ better cleaner men—
It’s that England as I fights for,
And I’m game to fight again. — Kennedy.

Of fates so vain—of passions so abhorred—

live as before.
What was good, shall be good, with, for evil, so

shall exist;
Not its semblance, but itself. — Browning.

An’ keep on keepin’ on.

Eternal rest. — Procter.

Ring out the feud of rich and poor,
Ring in redress to all mankind.
