To QreetYou and Wish You Well
The ? Hixco ? Wedding Book
HIS publication has been speci-
ally compiled for us with a
double objective.
FIRSTLY, that of providing a
source of useful and interesting
information upon Marriage Customs and Cere-
monials, and the many social observances attach-
ing themselves to this auspicious event.
SECONDLY, to provide a fund of practical and
acceptable suggestions for suitable Wedding
Gifts of such character as is now regarded as
both sensible and in keeping with the present
day tendency to avoid, as far as possible, Wed-
ding Gifts that serve no useful purpose.
To you, Little Lady, with this Booklet we send
our felicitations. May your period of courtship
be entertaining, your marriage of the happiest,
and your life as peaceful as can be in this world
of stress and strain.
And, may we also say, that possibly within the
pages you will find suggestions of home necessities
that will so interest, that you will make the time
to see in our rooms the originals, and begin your
married life well and happily in a ?Hixco? Home,
that being a chief aid to comfort and contentment.
Faithfully yours,
John Hicks & Company Ltd

HIXCQ WEDDINCTBOOir^^feI)
The ?Hixco ?Wedding Book
Though fools spurn Hymen?s gentle powers.
We, who improve his golden hours,
By sweet experience know
That marriage rightly understood,
Gives to the tender and the good
A paradise below.
WE forget who wrote those
lines, but think they get
nearer to summing up the
whole gamut of matrimony than
any others.
In fairness to Sydney Smith
however, one must quote
his description of the I
marriage state as being A
the most apt, and prob'
ably the cleverest of the
lot: ?It resembles a pair
of scissors,? he said, ?so
joined that they cannot
be separated; often
moving in opposite
directions, yet often
punishing anyone who
comes between them.?
No human institution has pro'
voked more cynicism than marriage.
No human institution has occa'
sioned more joy, more happiness,
more grief, more disappointment
and disillusion than marriage.
Along with birth and death, mar'
riage is one of the three great
adventures of life?it is the high
sea for which no compass has yet
been invented.
The cynicism, perhaps, is summed
up in ?Punch's? famous advice to
those about to marry: ?Don't.?
There is no question that matri'
mony is a hazardous enterprise, so
much so that one must bring the
French proverb upTO'date and
counsel that, in buying a second'
hand motor car or choosing a wife,
close your eyes and commend your'
__ iI u | self to Providence.
Love has long been
reputed to be blind, and
this optical debility no
doubt leads to many
marital disasters.
Greater happiness would
attend the married state
if we kept our eyes wide
open before marriage,
and half shut after'
wards.
A cynic has suggested that the
institution of matrimony would be
far more satisfactory if men could
only marry their second wives first!
Montaigne has likened wedlock
unto a cage: ?The birds outside
despair of ever getting in; those
inside are equally desirous of
getting out.?
And even Robert Louis Steven'
son, the ?well beloved,? tilted his
pen at matrimony when he referred
to it as being ?no more than a sort
of friendship recognised by the
police.?

H1XCO WEDDING BOOK
there is a tendency these days, and
not a particularly nice one, to give
other presents to mark the engage-
ment, such as a set of furs, or a
wristlet watch. But for sentimental
and traditional reasons, a ring is by
far the nicest gift. When choos-
ing the ring, it is not considered in
good taste to get one carrying more
than one, two or three
stones ?a simple, yet
beautiful, token.
In modern times the
diamond is the favourite
gem for the engagement
ring. Indeed, one thinks
only of the diamond in
connection with rings
of betrothal. There is
a reason for this.
According to an old
superstition, the origin In N
of which is unknown, the sparkle
of the diamond is supposed to
have originated in the fires of
love. Therefore, the diamond en-
gagement ring is considered by
superstitious persons the only true
engagement ring, portending love
and happiness throughout life. As
always, custom prevails.
In the England of Shakespeare?s
time, solemn bethrothal of a couple
was almost universally practised.
Among the peasantry the place of
rings was taken by a coin which
was broken between the pair, each
taking a part. But almost any gift
sufficed. A case in 1852 is recorded
where the lover gave his lass a pair
of gloves, two oranges, two hand-
kerchiefs, and a red silk girdle.
Sometimes the bride-elect received
a bent sixpence! At the conclu-
sion of the ceremony, which by no
means always took place in a
church, it was usual for the couple
to pledge each other in a cup of
wine, as do the Jews and Russians
to-day.
Formal betrothal is no longer
customary in England, but in
Europe it retains much of its
importance. Public be-
trothal carries with it
an obligation to marry,
and in the case of re-
fusal, the injured party
can have recourse to
aw - Germany to-day
' t^e betrothal is gener-
ally celebrated before
the relatives, and the
couple are called bride
and bridegroom from
that until marriage.
Announcing the Engagement
It used to be customary for an
engagement to be publicly an-
nounced, but even in society, this
has now fallen into disuse. Inci-
dentally, the custom of announcing
an engagement through the medium
of printed cards is now no longer
?done.'?
A few years ago the unfortunate
engaged couple were never allowed
to be alone. It was considered
quite impossible for them to be un-
accompanied even for an hour or
two. In those circumspect days?
not so many years ago ?a third
party trailed round, acting ?goose-
berry.? But in these days of
?liberty,? the mere suggestion of a
chaperone would receive short
shrift.

The Broken Engagement .
In the event of a couple breaking
off their engagement by mutual
consent, it is not considered good
taste to ask for the return of any
gifts which have been exchanged.
For the sake of future embarrass-
ments, however, it is as well to re-
turn each other?s letters!
According to the law,
a contract to marry is as
binding as any other
contract. The woman x.
who breaks her engage-
ment is just as liable in (wa
law as the man, but men %lp
have rarely been known
to sue for damages. In
odd cases unrequited
love amongst men leads
to murder or suicide, or
both; in odd cases the
man never marries, but grows into
a sour celibate; generally, however,
the man heals his wounds with a
popular homoepathic remedy, i.e.,
he takes unto himself another.
Betrothal Customs.
Modern bethrothal customs are
generally very simple in most coun-
tries. Among the Moslems of
Delhi, where infant-betrothal is
practised, the mother of the boy
simply drops a rupee into the girl
baby?s first bath!
In Mahomedan India spies report
upon the girl?s looks to the boy?s
people.
Among the Polynesian Hindus,
courtship rests with the maiden.
In New Britain, if the girl?s offer
of a neck ornament is accepted, the
engagement is complete.
In New Ireland the bride-elect
may be secluded in a leaf cage for
five years! The only alternative to
this plan is to send her to a fasting-
hut!
In China the deportment of the
bride-elect is strictly regulated by
the ancient Book of Rites.
In Hungary the betrothal is an-
nounced at a kissing feast.
A curious old custom
still prevails in Guern-
sey, although it is no
longer as widespread
and common as it was in
the eighteenth and nine-
teenth centuries. When
a young man offers him-
self to a young lady and
is accepted, the parents
�f both parties give
what is termed a ?flounc-
ing.? All their friends
are invited and a great feast is pre-
pared. The young lady is led around
the room by her future father-in-
law, the young man by his future
father-in-law, and they are intro-
duced to all the friends and relatives
of the opposite families. Rings are
then exchanged publicly and the
couple is considered betrothed. The
ceremony is almost as binding as
actual marriage, and once the rings
are exchanged, the thing is done!
They are as good as man and wife.
Etiquette is harsh in Greece, even
to-day. Rings for betrothal are ex-
changed in the priest?s presence,
and the engagement then may not
be broken without the consent of
the priest. Following the betrothal,
the engaged couple may not see
each other or talk to each other
until the day of the wedding.

P? THE HIXCO WEDDING
The Trousseau.
Generally, as soon as the happy of
couple?one uses the term ?happy? br
relatively, for engaged couples are g e
notoriously unhappy in their hap- nc
piness?as soon as the happy couple
have made up their minds regard- an
ing the approximate date of their
marriage, the bride-elect begins the wi
preparation of her trous-
seau ?the mere mention
of which is warranted - SS-.JSL-
of which is warranted
to excite a flutter in the
feminine heart. Make
the most of it, fair
lady, for it may be the
best dressed, and most
dressed, period of your
life.
It is always advisable
to have the trousseau
completed at least a
month before the wedding, if only
to free the bride from dressmaker?s
appointments, and the incidental
anxiety and worry which usually
attend the making of an important
frock.
A word of advice in regard to the
trousseau. Don?t buy a lot of
frocks. Fashions change so rapidly
these days that you will find some
of them out of fashion almost be-
fore you?ve had them on. If you
are wise you will see that your
trousseau consists chiefly of three or
four serviceable frocks and a wealth
of pretty underwear, and such
adornments as you know will appeal
to mere man.
The Household Linen .
Though we may flatter ourselves
on our civilisation, many of our
customs, and most of the prettiest
of them, are savage survivals. The
bride providing the linen and silver,
generally the gift of her mother, is
not very different from the practice
among the Cheyne and Pawnee
Indians, where the girl brought
with her a high-peaked riding
saddle with an embroi-
dered saddle cloth, a
summer sheet made out
of the skin of a buffalo
heifer, beautifully
whitened, and gowns
and moccasins all beaded
and ornamented. Her
WS mother, in addition, pro-
Mjfe/ vided the hanging for
Plftl the inter i or of the
lodge, and the cooking
utensils.
The Evolution of Marriage
Marriage is one of the oldest and
most sacred of human institutions.
It emerges from the long shadow of
pre-history and silhouettes itself
against the blackness of early sav-
age life, like the sun in a clouded
sky. Man appears originally to
have practised polygamy. If he
saw a woman he wanted, he took
her. The woman was a captive
before she was a wife. Marriage
by purchase followed marriage by
capture, and finally marriage by
contract became the general custom
among civilised peoples.
To a large extent marriage by
capture still leaves its impress on
modern practice. Among the Arabs
of Sinai, a girl acquires permanent
repute in proportion to her tears
and her struggles of resistance on
her marriage day.

the relatives and nearest friends of
the bride and bridegroom are in'

In arranging the marriage, popu'
lar opinion still favours the good
oldTashioned way of publishing
the banns. They must be pub'
lished in both the parish of the
bride and bridegroom, for three
Sundays preceding the -
marriage, and they hold
good for three succeed
ing months.
Marriage in a Regis'
try Office, however, is
rapidly coming into
favour, and is both
simple and economical.
The wedding invita'
tions are generally sent
out in letter form on
specially selected and
printed sheets. The paper must be
very good, but plain white, and, if
desired, with a gilt edge.
The usual invitation form is as
follows:
Mr. and Mrs. H. B. Honeybee
requests the pleasure of
presence at the marriage of their
daughter
Trilby
with
Mr. Gerrard Firstplace,
At Cathedral (Church or Home)
on
Wednesday (and date),
at 2 p.m.
and afterwards at the True Arcadia
R.S.V.P.
Brisbane.
The invitations are sent out two
or three weeks before the event, and
it is usual to ask guests to both the
ceremony and reception afterwards
?if there is a reception.
The church is, of course, deco'
rated for the occasion by enthu'
siastic lady well wishers.
Naturally anything very
bizarre is out of place,
but the more beautiful
the flowers, the better
the effect.
f" ' The Wedding Day is
Sjp essentially the woman?s
11 supreme moment. Ex'
cept in so far as it
affected the legality of
the occasion, no one
would notice whether
the bridegroom or best man were
there or not. Still, their presence is
more or less necessary (at least, the
bridegroom?s is), and it would be
too cruel to deprive him of all moral
support. Probably the bridegroom
and best man are extremely thank'
ful they are not the ?cynosure of
all eyes,? and we can dismiss them
from our thoughts after having as'
sured ourselves that they look neat
and tidy, that the best man has the
ring ready, and that the bridegroom
has done his duty in the way of
bridesmaids? presents.
The giving of presents to the
bridesmaids is nothing but the sur'
vival of a primitive custom. When
the world was young the man
bribed the girl?s friends to lure her
to the place where he lay in hiding.

H1XCO WEDDING BOOK^^^I
Where the Bride's Friends Sit .
The bride?s friends, as a rule sit
on the left of the aisle, and the
bridegroom?s on the right. This
choice is occasioned by the fact that
the bride walks on the left side of
the aisle as she enters and leaves
the church. She walks up the aisle
on her father?s left, and T f >
descends it on the bride' "b |j|jj
groom?s left. ||ll
"yJ fill
The Bridegroom
Forbidden . IfrXil ii
It is an old custom
for the bridegroom to
be forbidden the house
of the bride on the day 3 ilfn"
of the wedding. A m fef/jpr 3
superstition exists to the
effect that if the bride
permits herself to be Bah '
seen by the groom on the day of
the wedding, before the actual time
of the ceremony, the wedding will
not be quite as happy as she had
hoped. But, of course, few people
entertain these old superstitions
nowadays.
Qiving the Bride A way.
The duty of giving the bride
away is always performed by the
bride?s father, if living, or unless
circumstances prevent him from
attending. Failing the father, the
duty devolves upon a brother, or
if there?s no brother, on some near
near male relative or close friend
of the family. It is quite formal
for the bride?s mother to give her
away, though it is not usual.
The Bridesmaid's Duties.
The duty of the bridesmaid is to
make the way easy for the bride on
the day of the wedding. She should
see that the bride is perfectly
dressed, and that all the usual ac'
cessories?veil, bouquet, etc. ?are
in order. Generally, the brides'
maid or bridesmaids pre'
t j cede the bride to the
li church, and await her
** < |*. at the door, although it
. is often the practice at
a MflLr a modern wedding for
the bridesmaid to leave
the house at the same
time, but in another
vehicle.
At the Church
The bridegroom is the first per'
son to arrive at the church, acconv
panied by the best man. He stands
at the right of the altar.
The front pews are reserved for
the families of bride and groom.
The wedding guests should be
careful to arrive in good time, as
it is not etiquette for them to arrive
later than the bride. They rise on
her entrance. A bride should ah
ways be punctual. Punctuality is
the thief of time.
The chief bridesmaid must be
ready to receive the glove and bou'
quet of the bride early in the ser'
vice. The best man sometimes
holds the bridesmaid?s bouquet.

H1XCO WEDDING
After the Service .
At the conclusion of the service,
the bridegroom and bride go arm
in arm to the vestry, followed by
the bridal party, their parents, and
any relatives or distinguished
guests.
The register is signed (the bride
signing her maiden name) by bride
and groom. Two wit-
nesses are enough, but
the friends of the bride r,
always consider it a pri-
vilege to sign their
names to the document.
The bride goes down the (im
aisle to the strains of
Mendelssohn?s ?Wed-
ding March,? on the arm =
of her husband. The
duty is to see that he has it ?and
knows he has it.
The best man is undoubtedly a
relic of marriage by capture. When
the ancient bridegroom set out to
capture a bride, he was usually
accompanied by a strong-armed
friend who covered the pursuit of
the girl?s protector.
ln early Anglo-Saxon
marriages, men were no
less primitive in their
courtships than their
forefathers. The early
Jjjfefift Anglo-Saxon stole into
the girl?s home, bluntly
r \ announced his purpose,
, and had a horse ready
V at the door for her. She
didn?t have the oppor-
tunity even to say ?This
bridal couple are the first tunity even to say ?This
to drive away, followed Earl > En z land is so sudden.? If willing,
by the bride?s parents. The bride?s
parents provide the vehicles, in-
cluding those of the bridesmaids,
and one for the officiating clergy-
man, if he attends the reception.
The Best Man's Duties .
All the church fees are borne by
the bridegroom. He gives the
bridesmaids presents and bouquets,
and should appear interested and
at his best.
The best man does the actual
paying for the groom. His position
is no light one. He has to attend
to both bride and groom. But his
principal duty is to see that the
bridegroom does not enter the
church Without the ring or leave it
without his hat. It is the bride-
groom?s practice to want to go away
without his hat, and the best man?s
she was treated gently. If not her
wrists were bound and she was tied
to the saddle. Of course, her father
pursued her, but the wise groom ah
ways had one, two or more friends
ready to cover his retreat. These
fighting friends were the original
groomsmen.
Wedding Ring Lore .
In Shakespeare?s time the wed-
ding ring was an elaborate and
richly ornate affair, but from the
time of Queen Mary onwards, the
English people favoured the plain
gold band, as the insignia of mar-
riage, and its popularity spread all
over Europe. At the time of
Queen Mary?s wedding to Philip of
Spain, some controversy arose as

H1XCO WEDDING
simple ring unadorned with gems,
for ?she chose to be wedded with
a plain hoop of gold, like other
maidens.?
lt is said that the ring is worn
on the left hand to signify the sub-
jection of the wife to the husband.
This may be mere superstition; we
do not know. But it is certain that
in early times the right hand signi-
fied power and author- c ""T
ity, the left, subjection.
The wedding ring is
worn to-day on the
third finger of the left
hand. A pretty bit of
anatomical fiction which
has come down to us
from the ancient Greeks,
is that a certain vein of
blood, passing directly
from this finger, flows
on to the heart! In Cheyne and Pawnee Indians
spite of this, there was a period in pected tc
English history when the wedding
ring was worn on the thumb.
The Reception .
It must not be forgotten that the
bride?s mother, or whoever gives
the reception, is hostess, and not
the bride. The bride?s mother must
be greeted first. The bride has no
official duties at the reception, and
is not called upon to entertain the
guests. If any speeches are made,
the health of the bridal pair is pro-
posed by the minister or old friend
of the family. The bridegroom
briefly responds if able to, and not
too nervous. The health of the
bridesmaids is next proposed by the
best man, and replied to by one
who for the time being must speak
from a woman?s standpoint. This
rule will soon be altered.
The notorious wedding break-
fasts of a few years ago are now
mercifully being superceded by an
'?At Home? tea form of entertain-
ment, and the jocose and often
doubtful speeches which accom-
panied them are also no longer the
fashion.
The best man sees
i that the car is ready be-
f f� re the bridal couple
fZ are ready to leave on
their honeymoon. He
- "wM a^so atten ds to the lug-
gage, etc.
The guests nearly all
leave the reception as
soon as the couple have
departed.
A bride is not ex-
pected to entertain after she returns
from her honeymoon; she should
be entertained by her friends.
Throwing Shoes and Rice.
Originally, the casting of a shoe
signified a fruitful marriage. But
later on, among the Assyrians and
Hebrews, the flinging down of a
shoe was a symbol of possession.
Some authorities believe that the
wedding shoe is a relic of marriage
by capture, and that it grew out of
the custom of hurling missiles after
the robber bridegroom by the
father of the girl.
The throwing of rice played an
important part in ancient marriage
ceremonies, and was generally allied
with the hope that the marriage
would be fruitful.

THE H1XCO WEDDING BOOK~^^^
Some authorities tell us that the
practice of throwing rice was for
the purpose of giving food to the
evil influences that surrounded
them. It was a primitive belief
that evil spirits were always present
at a marriage, and it was for the
purpose of appeasing these spirits
that rice was thrown.
The Origin of the Honeymoon .
Lord Avebury in his Origin of
Civilisation suggests that the seclu"
sion usually associated with the
honeymoon is a survival of marriage
by capture, and answers to the
period during which the husband
kept his wife in retirement, to pre"
vent her from appealing to her
relatives for release. Other writers
suggest that as the moon coni"
mences to wane as soon as it is at
its full, so does the mutual affec"
tion of the wedded pair!
This may be only the acidity of
the disgruntled.
The custom of referring to the
period immediately after marriage
as the Honeymoon comes down to
us from the ancient tribes of Cem
tral Europe.
Newly married couples drank and
served to their friends a wine made
from honey gathered during the
first thirty days following upon the
performance of the wedding cere"
mony.
This custom persisted for several
hundred years but finally died out,
only the term remaining to indicate
its origin.

IT has been said of old rime that marriages
are made in Heaven. May be so. ? Hixco?
offer no judgment, but think ? not proven.?
The marriages made in Queensland and New
South Wales are more certain and interesting

Many more marriages?many more furnishings
much more happiness.
So let the marriage bells and motor cars go
merrily and often?all the year round.
