LETTERS, Ac.
To liis Honor, the Superintendent, Port Philip.
Melbourne, March 31, 1851,
Sir, I have the honor to inform your Honor, that the interes
of the run called ? Trio,? in the district of Western Port, has been
assigned and transferred to me by Messrs. Jeffries? Brothers, and I
beg leave to request that the pre-emptive right to purchase the fol-
lowing portions of land comprised in that run, viz., sections 56, 53,
52, 49, 48, and 57, may be granted to me as the holder of that run.
?I have the honor to be, &c. W. Campbell.
Note, Mr. Campbell received no written reply to the above
letter, Mr. La Trobe being absent in Sydney, but Mr. E.
Bell, who was acting as private secretary, acknowledged it
personally to Mr. Campbell, and it appears in a ? Return of
lands applied for under pre-emptive right, but not
granted,? laid before the Council on the 10th May 1842.
It will be observed, that the lands thus applied for lay out-
side the reserve at Kynton, and it was not therefore then a
question whether the occupant was entitled to pre-emption,
but a question between Messrs. Jeffries? and Mr. Campbell, ?
as to whether the former gentlemen, after the sale of their
iuii, could retain a pre-emptive right over such portion as
they might have applied for previously. The Attorney-
General, Mr. J. P, Beer, and ]Hr, Edward Bell, will pro-
bably recollect the question being brought under their notice.
The Kynton reserve was not, until some years afterwards,
extended, and so made to include these lands.
To His Honor, C. J. La Trobe, Esq., the Superintendent,
Port Philip.
Melbourne, May 5, 1851.
Sir,?-As the licensed occupier of the Trio? run in the Western
District, I beg leave to apply to purchase under the pre-


eruptive right the following portions of land situated in the parish
of Lauriston, at and near Kynton, viz., portions 3, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15, 16, 18, and 19, containing one hundred and eighty acres
(180), being bounded on the west by the village of Kynton, on the
north by John Mills? purchased land, and portion 21, on the east by
the parish boundary line, and on the south by William Ritchies, and
Andrew Welsh, and Jane Watson?s purchased land. ?1 have the
honor to be, &c. W. Campbell.
To Mr. W. Campbell, See., &c.
Superintendent?s Office, Melbourne, May 7,1851.

dated the sth instant, applying to purchase, under pre-emptive right,
certain portions of land in the parish of Lauriston, and to inform you

To William Campbell, Esq., St. Kilda.
Colonial Secretary's Office, Melbourne, June 21, 1852.
Sir, ?With reference to your application of the Bth May 1851, to
be allowed to purchase, under pre-emptive right, a portion of your
licensed ran, known as ? Trio,? in the Western Port District of this
colony, I have the honor to inform you that the application has been
referred to a Board appointed by His Excellency the Lieutenant-
Governor to report upon it, and that His Excellency approves of
your being allowed to purchase the following portion of land, viz.,
640 acres containing your valuable improvements, at the price of
20s. per acre, amounting to �640, which sum you are required to
pay into the Colonial Treasury within one month from this date. ?
I have the honor to be, &c. W. Lonsdale.
To Captain Lonsdale, the Honourable the Colonial Secretary.
Strathlodden, August 28,185].
Sir, ?Whereas His Excellency C. J. La Trobe, Esq., Lieutenant-
Governor of the Colony of Victoria and its dependencies, &c., has
notified by proclamation that the following portions of land, situated
upon my licensed run of ?Trio,? near Kynton, in the county of
Dalhousie, will be offered for sale at Melbourne on the 17th proximo,
viz., portions 21, 22, 23, and 41, containing about 345 acres, and
whereas, by an act passed in August 1846, ?it was enacted, that it
should be lawful for Her Majesty, by an Order in Council, to make
and establish all such rules and regulations as to Her Majesty should
seem fit, for the purposes respecting the more effectually making
demises or licenses, for any term of years not exceeding 14, and
respecting any right of pre-emption which it may be proper to give
the holders of any demise or license within the colony of New South
Wales.? And whereas it was ? ordered by the Queen?s Most Ex-
cellent Majesty, by and with the advice of the Privy Council that
within the said colony of New South Wales the rules and regula-
tions comprised in the following chapters shall henceforth be ob-
served, and have the force and effect of the law.? Whereas bv the
9th sect., 2d cap., His Excellency ?is empowered to make grants
or sales for public purposes, or disposing of in such other manner as
for the public interest may seem best,? and whereas such section
enumerates a detailed description of such public purposes, I have to
submit to His Excellency, that the fact of enumerating such pur-
poses in detail shews clearly, were there nothing else in the rules


and regulations to provide against it, that it was never contemplated
that such land should be offered for sale to private individuals for
speculative purposes.
The 6th sect, provides, that ? during the continuance of any lease
of lands occupied as a run , the same shall not be open to purchase
by any other person or persons except the lessee thereof.? And the
Ist sect., cap. 3, provides, that ? within lands coming under the de-
scription of ?intermediate? lands, the interest in runs shall be ac-
quired, held, and determined, upon the same terms and conditions as
above laid down for unsettled lands, excepting that the leases shall
not be made for more than eight years in duration, and that at the
end of each successive year from the date of the lease it shall be com-
petent for the Governor, provided he shall have given 60 days? pre-
vious notice, to offer for sale all or any part of the land within any
such run, subject to the same conditions in favor of the lessee, as are
above laid down in the case of a sale, at the expiration of the full
term of a lease of unsettled lands.? And whereas such section in-
cludes all the rules and regulations applicable to intermediate lands,
and as no lease has been granted, no power to sell is yet vested in
the Governor, nor can be until a year after a lease has been granted.
The 6th of the above recited act, to amend an act, enacts, ? that it
shall be lawful for Her Majesty, by an order or orders in Council, to
make and establish all such rules and regulations as to Her Majesty
may seem meet. Peovided always, that nothing herein contained
shall be construed to authorize the sale of any waste lands in the
said colonies, otherwise than in conformity with the provisions of the
said act, except to persons who shall be in actual occupation thereof
under such demise or license;? from which provision it is evident
that any lands beyond the bounds of location cannot be sold except
to the persons in actual occupation, and to them only at a fair value,
which value can be fixed by His Excellency, by the power he has of
appointing an umpire, and which counteracts any undue advantages
there may be in the right of pre-emption. That I have to submit
to His Excellency?s consideration, that a wrong construction has
been put upon the rules and regulations for the sale of land in the
intermediate district, which are applied contrary to the Act of Par-
liament, as above recited. That, taking the whole act, and the whole
of the rules and regulations, as well as the colonial proclamations
sanctioning the transfer of runs, there is nothing to warrant or autho-
rise the sale of any lands beyond the bounds of location, except to
persons in actual occupation. That, as I have given a large consi-
deration for the transfer of the ? Trio? run, under a belief that im-
perial acts and orders in Council would be held sacred, I feel it my
duty to protest against the sale of the aforesaid portions of land;
and that I most respectfully beg to draw His Excellency?s attention
to the above-mentioned act, and to express a hope that His Excel-
lency will be pleased to cause the said portions of land to be with-
drawn from the approaching sale. I may add, for His Excellency?s
information, that a considerable portion of the lands already sold in


the neighbourhood of Kynton has been bought on speculation ?
several lots have already changed hands, and more is offered for
sale, and scarcely any is yet brought under cultivation. ?I have the
honor to be, &c; W. Campbell.
Note. ?The lands thus referred to are within the original
reserve.
To W. Campbell, Esq., Strathlodden, Kynton.
Colonial Secretary?s Office, Melbourne, Sept. 17, 1851.
Sir, ?I have the honor, by direction of His Excellency, the
Lieutenant-Governor, to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
dated the 28th ultimo, respecting the sale of certain portions of your
run called ? Trio,? in the Intermediate District; and in reply, to
inform you, that His Excellency has been pleased to direct that the
portions noted in the margin should be withdrawn from approaching Portions 21,22,
sale until your claim to pre-emptive right of purchase can be inquired and 41,
into.?l have the honor to be, &c. W. Lonsdale. Cou �ty of IM-
lionsie.
To the Honourable the Colonial Secretary.
Strathlodden, Sept. 29, 1851.
Sir, ? I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of
the 17th instant, and beg to express my thanks to His Excellency
the Lieutenant-Governor, for having caused to be withdrawn from
sale the portions of land referred to in my letter of the 28th ultimo,
which letter miscarried, through the want of proper postal communi-
cation.
Observing portions of land in the parish of Lauriston offered for
sale on the 7th and 16th proximo, and presuming such portions to
be situated upon my run of ? Trio,? I beg leave most respectfully to
request that His Excellency will be pleased to direct that they be
withdrawn from the approaching sale. I make such request on the
ground given in my letter to you of the 28th ultimo.?l have the
honor to be, &c. W. Campbell.

Colonial Secretary?s Office, Melbourne, Oct. 15,1851.

To Wm. Campbell, Esq., St. Kilda.
Colonial Secretary?s Office, Melbourne, April 5, 1852.
Sib, ?I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the
27th and 16th March, and to inform you that it has been found
necessary to refer them to the Land Board for further information;

the Lieutenant-Governor's decision thereon, it shall be made known
to you without delay,?l have the honor to be, &c.
For the Colonial Secretary,
G. W. Rusden.


Re-application,
To the Honorable the Colonial Secretary.
St. Kilda, July 24, 1852
Sir, ? I beg leave to apply to purchase, under the pre-emptive
right, the following portion of land, situated upon my licensed run
of ? Trio ? ?viz., 28, 29, 30, and 31, containing 237f acres 3 roods,
adjoining the eastern boundary of the parish of Lauriston, and now
proclaimed for sale.
I beg to add, that the above-mentioned portions of land are included
in my application of the Bth May 1851, and to impress upon you
that I am entitled to purchase at the value the land had at the time
I applied for it, and not an increased value.?l have the honor to
be, &c. W. Campbell.
To W. Campbell, Esq., St. Kilda.
Colonial Secretary?s Office, Melbourne, August 20,1852.
Sir, ?I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the
24th ultimo, applying to purchase, under pre-emptive right, certain
portions of land adjoining the parish of Lauriston, forming part of Portions 28
your licensed run named ? Trio.? 30 and 31.
In reply, I am directed by His Excellency the Lieutenant-
Governor to inform you, that as the land in question forms part of a
reserve set apart for the public utility and settlement of the colony,
your request cannot be complied with. ?I have the honor to be, &c.
W. Lonsdale.
Note. ?The land was not included in the original reserve, nor
even in any reserve, long after the first application to pur-
chase was made.
To the Honorable the Colonial Secretary.
St. Kilda, July 29, 1852.
Sir, ?I beg leave to apply to purchase, under the pre-emptive
right, a section of 640 acres of land situated upon my licensed run


of ? Trio/? being bounded on the south by the measured land
formerly applied for, and the sold lands in the parish of Lauriston,
and on the west by the river Compaspie.?l have the honor to
be, &c. W. Campbell.
Note. ?This land lay outside the reserve.
To W. Campbell, Esq., St. Kilda.
Colonial Secretary's Office, Melbourne, October 11, 1852.
Sir, ?Your application to purchase 640 acres at your station,
known as ? Trio,? in the parish of Carlsruhe, under the regulations
dated the 28th June 1850, having been brought under the consi-
deration of the Land Board, and duly reported upon for the infor-
mation of His Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor, I am directed
by His Excellency to inform you that, consistently with the regula-
tions, your claim cannot be allowed, one section in this vicinity
having been already granted.?l have the honor to be, &c.
W. Lonsdale.
To Captain Lonsdale, the Honorable the Colonial Secretary.
St. Kilda, August 18, 1852.
Sir, ? I regret being under the necessity of protesting against the
proposed sale of the portions of land referred to in my letter to you
of the 24th ultimo. Ido so upon the grounds that His Excellency
is required by the Order in Council to give the occupant the option
of purchasing at a valuation before he can otherwise sell, except for
public purposes. That it is not a public purpose to sell to private
individuals for speculative purposes. That the lands sold years ago
in the same locality have been purchased chiefly by speculators, and
not brought under cultivation. That, from the scarcity and high
price of labour, it is impracticable to bring lands under cultivation.
That the lands are more beneficially occupied for the public, under
the present pastoral system, than under a system of subdivision,
which, if adopted, will destroy the pastoral interest, to the public
loss, and render the runs untenable. ?I have the honor to be, &c.
W. Campbell.


To W. Campbell, Esq., St. Kilda.
Colonial Secretary?s Office, Melbourne, August 24, 1852.
Sir, ?I do myself the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your
letter of the 18th instant, protesting against the sale of certain land
in your licensed occupation, and detailing the grounds upon which
you adopt this course.
2. In reply, I am instructed by the Lieutenant-Governor to
inform you, that after giving the subject his fullest consideration,
His Excellency takes a different view of the case to that shewn in
your communication, and regrets not being able to sanction the
withdrawal of the land in question from ensuing sale. ?I have the
honor to be, &c. W. Lonsdale.
* *
To Captain Lonsdale, the Honorable the Colonial Secretary.
St. Kilda, October 4, 1852.
Sir,--I beg to apply to purchase, under the pre-emptive right,
the following portions" of land situated upon my licensed run of
? Trio,? now advertised for sale : ?viz., portions 21, 22, 23, and 41,
which portions were withdrawn from the sale of 17th July 1851, at
my request; also portions 39, 40, and 46, containing in all about
570 acres. And I beg to remark, that the only practical access to
the water frontage is through these sections ; and if not allowed to
exercise my privilege in purchasing them, the pastoral resources of
the remaining part of the run is destroyed, which you can perceive
hv a reference to the map of the land. ?I have the honor to be, &c.
J W. Campbell.
To Wm. Campbell, Esq., St. Kilda.
Colonial Secretary?s Office, Melbourne, October 11,1852.
g IRj I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th
instant, applying to purchase certain portions of your licensed run,
and to inform you that it has been found necessary to refer it to the
Land Board for further information ; as soon as this may have been
received, and I may have obtained the Lieutenant-Governor?s deci-


sion thereon, it shall be made known to you without delay.?-I have
the honor to be, &c. W. Lonsdale.
In 1853 Mr. Campbell again protested against a sale, and had the
following reply: ?
To W. Campbell, Esq., M.S.C.,
Legislative Council Chambers.
Colonial Secretary?s Office, Melbourne, November 22,1853.
Sir, ??I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
of the 14th instant, in which, after referring to your application to
purchase under pre-emptive right, you protest against the sale of a
portion of your run ? Trio ; ? and finally, request that such portion
be withdrawn from sale.
I am directed by His Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor, in
reply, to express his regret that such request cannot now be com-
plied with. ?I have the honor to be, &c.
Order,
L. Gilles, C. Secy.
To His Excellency Sir Charles Hotham, K.C.8., Captain-General
and Governor-in-Chief of the Colony of Victoria, and Vice-Ad-
miral of the same.
25 Walker Street, Edinburgh, January 3, 1856.
Sir, ?Having, in March 1851, purchased from Messrs. Jeffries the
? Trio ? station, with 6600 sheep ; and having acquired a vested
interest in that run by transfer, under the sanction and authority of
the Executive Government, for which transfer I paid a considerable
price, under a belief that the privileges of lease and pre-emptive
right, granted by the Queen and Privy Council, and implemented
by Colonial proclamation, would be held sacred; and having suffered
heavy losses from the illegal acts of the Government, I beg leave
most respectfully to draw your Excellency?s attention to the follow-
ing facts : ?I applied to purchase, under the pre-emptive right, the
following quantities of land upon my licensed run, and am in posses-


slon of replies from the Government to them that I made such
applications, viz.:?
On the 31st March 1851, 1400 acres.
sth May ... 180
Bth ... ... 1600
Two half acre allot-
27th March 1852,
ments in Kynton,
the head station.
? ? *
? ? ?
24th July
29th ...
237
640
4th Oct.
570 ...
Total, 4628 acres ?the greater portion of
which was situated outside the boundaries of the ori-
ginal agricultural reserve at Kynton, but of which I was
only allowed to purchase 640 acres.
On observing these lands advertised for sale by auction, I protested
against the sale of any land for pastoral or agricultural purposes to
private individuals in that way, and upon such protests the lands
were then withdrawn from sale. ?See letters from the Colonial Sec-
retary to me of the 17th Sept, and 15th Oct. 1851. I was thereby
strengthened in ray belief that my just and legal claims to purchase
these lands would be fully recognised by the Executive Government,
and in that belief was prevented from otherwise
investing in land; my available capital being in
such expectation kept from seeking other equally
profitable investments, in proof of which I may refer to
the fact of my never having purchased even a single acre at any of
the sales since then. I always held the sales in the pastoral districts
to be illegal, and to which I could not consent, nor become a party
thereto by purchasing. I therefore most respectfully submit, that I
am equitably entitled to be put in as good a position as if the lands
applied for had been granted to me at the average price which the
adjoining lands then realised. I am therefore entitled to
compensation equal to the difference between that average price and
the increased value of these lands, which have been illegally sold to
private individuals for their private gain?a great portion of which
is used (if used at all) for pastoral purposes.
Upon another point I may add, that the pastoral resources of the
run in question have been entirely lost to me ?by the denial of my
pre-emptive right to purchase, and by the illegal sale of the best
portion of my run to private parties for any purpose, because from
the sale of the water frontage the water was thereby cut off from the
stock upon the remaining back portion of the run, and the pastoral
capabilities of the run were deteriorated so much, that the stock were
necessarily decreased to a nominal number, and ultimately my agents
were compelled to dispose of the remainder of my stock in such bad
condition, that the price realised was scarcely one-third of that of


stock in good condition, and in the end were forced to vacate the
run entirely ; a reference to the map of that locality will substantiate
this point. I may also add, that I was subjected to great loss and
annoyance, and had my stock even impounded upon the pastures of
my run, which ought to have been my property by law and justice,
but which were illegally sold to others. The Records of the Bench
of Petty Sessions at Kynton will shew that I was subjected to the
payment of poundage and trespassage, within the limits of my own
run.
I trust your Excellency will thus permit me most restpectfully to
claim an equitable consideration for the various losses sustained as
herein stated, and to request that your Excellency may be pleased,
in justice, to submit my claims to arbitration, and
so facilitate the obtainment of justice, according
to lawand equity have the honour to be, &c.
W. Campbell.
Note. ?ln addition to the losses sustained in the sale of the lands
upon the run of ? Trio,? Mr. Campbell suffered a heavy loss by the
indiscriminate and illegal sale of lands for agricultural, pastoral, and
other more speculative purposes, upon the run of ? Strathlodden
against which sales he lodged protests, and previously applied to
purchase these lands under his pre-emptive right.
Mr. Campbell also lost the greater portion of that run by its being
occupied as a gold field; but he felt he had no legal claim against
such occupation, it being one of the public purposes at the disposal
of the Governor, but a very different pnrpose from the sales of agri-
cultural and pastoral lands to speculators ; which sales deteriorated
the run so much, that Mr. Campbell was forced to sell his interest
in the remainder of the run at a value far below what it would
otherwise have realised.
