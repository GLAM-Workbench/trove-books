Her Master, Captain K. A. H.

about 100 miles east of the toe of

Her crew had taken to the
boats ; some were swimming
when the Stratheden stopped to
give them as much shelter as was
possible.
The lifeboat had picked up 11
sailors, say reports reaching
Athens, when a giant wave tossed
it like a Cork and capsized it.
Every man in it was drowned.

Princess
Margaret
Statement By
Group Captain
Townsend
Brussels, Monday.
( t ROUP CAPTAIN PETER
VA TOWNSEND said to-day that
Princess Margaret had not made
known to him any decision to
marry him, nor had he any reason
to believe she had made such a
decision
He was referring to a news-
paper report claiming that he
had said in an interview: “If a
situation should demand my exile
and that of a certain lady, we
should of course accept it.”
The 40-year-old air attache
showed reporters waiting outside
his flat a copy of the report, and
speaking slowly in a firm voice
said:
“ This statement implies that
Princess Margaret has decided
to marry me.
“ The Princess has made no
such decision known to me, nor
have I any reason to believe she
has made such a decision.”
‘Pure Invention’
Speaking of the report in which
the reference to exile was attribu-
ted to him, he said;
“ I have already described this
alleged statement as pure inven-
tion and said that it should be
comoletely disregarded.
“In view of this statement—
again, of course, alleged to have
been made by me—as well as a
number of other statements also
alleged to me, I shall now be
forced to seek escape from re-
porters.”
He added to the waiting group;
You reporters have, by the con-
sideration you have shown me,
made it much easier for me to get
on with my life than 1 found it
when I avoided you.”—Reuter.
‘BIG BUSINESS ’ MEN

The men, Frederick Walter

At the police station Xinaris, it
was alleged, said: “A man chal-
lenged me to a flght. He took his
coat off and rolled up his sleeves.
We went outside into the alley.
He drew a knife at me. I got hold
of- the knife and then everything
went hazy.
Rudolph Faraoe, an Islington
shop assistant, who said he was
known as “ Toni ” or “ Lou,” told
the court that Xinaris had given
him the knife a week earlier to
have it sharpened. He was hand-

Here’s My

season of the year.
you are successful, I’ll send you
a certificate to prove it to the
world.
Right now, all over the country,
the most unlikely people are busy
trying to spot the winner of the
Grand National. Not only the
hard-bitten racing regulars, but
all kinds of stay-at-home fans
who have never seen a racecourse
in their lives.
Hundreds of them don’t bet and
don’t know the difference between
a bay and a chestnut, but they
try to spot the winner just for the
fun of the game,
I’m even doing it myself.
THE RULES
UNCLE S MISTAKE
ONE of the unluckiest winner-
spotters I ever knew was my
Uncle Jim. He was always going
round telling people that he had
fancied the winner of a big race
—after it had won
Uncle Jim fancied Shaun
Spadah, Grakle, Tipperary Tim
and half a dozen other Grand
National winners, but he wasn’t
a betting man and so he never
had anything to show for his
smartness. What was worse,
when he spoke of his premoni-
tions after the race nobody would
believe him.
You see, poor Uncle Jim always
kept his fancies to himself and he
could never prove to the world in
general what a wonderful winner-
spotter he really was. He died a
soured and frustrated man.
YOUR CHANCE
THERE must be hundreds and
thousands of people like
Uncle Jim—quiet, stay-at-home
students ot racing who, maybe,
spotted Royal Tan as last year's
Grand National winner, or Early
Mist the year before, and h_re
nothing to show for it. except a
few sceptical glances when they
talk about it.
. Well, here Is my challenge to
all of them, including YOU—try
to spot this year’s winner and, if

Odds Shorten
The heavy Cambridge crew can
certainly send their boat along at
a fast pace but they have not yet
attained the uniformity of Oxford.
Yet the odds on Oxford repeat-
ing last year’s wim have been
considerably shortened on the
strength of the fast Cambridge
trial in which they were 35sec
quicker than their rivals.
We shall know a little more
about the prospects after the final
trials. Oxford will row from Put-
ney to Mortlake on Wednesday
(5,0) and Cambridge on Thursday
(5.45).

MID-RIVER
MEETING
By MAURICE HART
Race to be rowed March 26 (2.20)
IXIHE Oxford and Cambridge
Boat Race crews went all cov
to-day. Travelling in opposite
directions they came within a few
feet of each other Blades stopped
and neither crew would budge.
The coaches exchanged glances.
Then, after nearly a minute,
Cambridge decided to show their
paces.
Four of the Light Blues took
off their sweaters and, with an
air of challenging defiance, swept
out of distance under Hammer-
smith Bridge leaving Oxford still
stationary.
Nevertheless, Oxford, in their
naddling as far as Chiswick
Reach and back, were every bit
as good as their rivals.
More so in a start off the Putney
boat-houses, in which they put in
ten strokes in issec., against Cam-
bridge’s ten in I7sec„ and a later
effort of ten in I6sec.
