MISCELLANEOU S.
I.? Overland Journey from Sydney to Port Essington.
In the first session of the Legislative Assembly of New South
Wales, a Committee, appointed to inquire into the feasibility of
the project, reported in favour of a money-vote to defray the ex-
penses of an overland journey from Sydney to Port Essington.
The Assembly, in consequence, voted 1000 Z. for this purpose.
The vote was disallowed by government; but the undertaking
has not been allowed to drop. It has been taken up by private
enterprise, as will appear from the following extracts from two
Sydney papers :
? Expedition to Port Essington.' ?Dr. Leichardt, a gentleman of
scientific attainments, who has been about two years in the colony,
during which time he has been actively employed in collecting speci-
mens of natural history in the northern districts, has determined to
make an attempt to proceed overland to Port Essington. His party will
he hut small, not consisting of more than six persons ; and his supplies
will be carried on pack-horses, it being evident that in bush-travelling
any sort of vehicle must cause great delay. -As no public money will be
applied for, the charges will be heavy if suffered to fall entirely on Dr.
Leichardt; and any person who may feel disposed to assist in the
object, can do so either by a subscription in money or supplies. The
party will start in about ten days, it being desirable, it possible, to
arrive at the end of the journey before the tropical rains set in. An
application has been made to the directors of the Hunter River Steam
Navigation Company to give the whole of the party a free passage to
Moreton Bay, which, considering the object in view, we trust they may
be induced to do, as it will save a tedious journey of several hundred
miles. While we cannot but repeat our opinion of last year, that the
government was highly to blame for refusing the 1000 Z. voted by the
Legislative Council for the purpose of fitting out an expedition to pro-
ceed to Port Essington, we are pleased to find that individual enterprise
is about to undertake a measure of such deep importance to this and the
neighbouring colonies.? Sydney Morning Herald.
? Trip to Port Essington. ?ln our previous notice of this subject
mention was made of a gentleman properly qualified to undertake the
expedition, and who was about to start overland for Port Essington.
The gentleman to whom allusion was made is Dr. Ludwig Leichardt,
known to many persons in Sydney as a very successful lecturer on bo-
tany. Since the time when he appeared in this capacity, Dr. Leichardt


has been engaged in a scientific exploration of the country between
Sydney and Wide Bay, to the north of Moreton Bay. He has recently
returned from that journey, bringing with him an immense collection of
specimens of every kind?plants, wood, shells, recent and fossil rocks,
reptiles, wild fruits, gigantic bones, &c. This collection is in many re-
spects perfectly unrivalled ; and in one division alone, that of botany,
we understand he has discovered upwards of one hundred new plants.
His geological labours have enabled him to follow a complete section to
Wide Bay; and the result of his industry will shortly be made known
through the medium of either a German or English scientific periodical.
It will be then seen what has been going on, whilst some have little
dreamed of it. In the course of his journey, Dr. Leichardt has, of
course, come into contact with numerous tribes of aborigines. With
them he lived peaceably, employing them frequently in his service.
Even the wildest of the Myall blacks ?fellows as ferocious as cannibals
usually are?learned to appreciate him; and though for a long time
they could not comprehend his operations on the stones, tapping them
with his hammer and putting them into his bag, yet they found out that
he was an extraordinary character, and, from his medical attentions to
them, a person far beyond themselves. Hence they became his friends;
and we have been told that, where another white man would have been
swallowed, the doctor was safe and unharmed. His skill, patience, and
tact thus enabled him to go alone and undefended into the haunts of
savage men, and to pursue his avocations at his ease. The adventures
which befel him in his long and perilous journey would, we doubt not,
form an interesting volume. It is not our business to intrude into his
own province, and imperfectly touch upon what he will, we trust, him-
self lay before the public. It is sufficient for us to be able to assure our
readers that the adventures of this enterprising man are singularly cha-
racteristic, and that they prove him to be a person well calculated to
battle with the difficulties which would, doubtlessly, await any one
who should attempt the overland route. Cool, determined, considerate,
and full of that patient untiring energy which is so material a part of
the German character. Dr. Leichardt is, of all men we have seen, the
best fitted to enter upon this arduous duty. His plans at present are,
we presume, not matured; but it is said that he will very shortly set
out for his new destination. Not accoutred from the public purse?not
encumbered by a useless retinue of followers?but alone, or with one or
two trusty friends, without weapons of offence, armed chiefly with his
hammer, and determined to investigate all he sees?this resolute indi-
vidual will, if his life be providentially spared, accomplish single-handed
what many, whom we are acquainted with, declare to be impossible.
Time will determine.?? Australian.
