A WIS
V. J. D.
WE wish thee pleasant wandering's
In many a sun-browned Isle,
“ Where every prospect pleases
And men not maids are vile.
In heart we’ll travel with thee,
The wind will bear our sighs ;
We’ll think of thee near coral lips
And sunned in Beauty’s eyes.

VICTOR DALEY.


PERSONAL NOTE.
By RODERIC QUINN.
VICTOR DALEY, Poet and Story-teller, and, to those
who know him best, man of willing- heart and hand,
was born in Armagh, Ireland, on August sth, 1858.
His cradle was shadowed by Navan Rath, a green mound
now, but once the abiding place of kings who sent their tens
ot thousands of armed men to the North and the South and
the East and the West. The shadow of Navan Rath never
quite lilted from his life : it looks out of his poetry ; and
those who read, and have eyes to see, will find it there, with
all its suggestions of Ancientry. At times, however, he casts
the shadow from him, and emerges into a broad, modern
sunlight of merry humour, and then we know him as Creeve
Roe.
In his twentieth year Daley arrived in Australia. He
had some money and plenty of memories. Memories are not
always marketable, but these of Daley were. When the need
came he dressed them up in graceful verse —he is an artist in
colour—and sold them at so much a Column. Like some old
captain of the Levant, home coming from a profitable cruise
with a train of captives—sweet-faced, shrinking girls, the
which would be exposed later on for the bidding of rich
merchant and jewelled Sultan—Victor Daley has brought his
memories to the market-place, and every one of us, no matter
what his place in the world, may take just that one which
suits his mood—take and lay its beauty to heart.
With poets, as with vocalists, there is a time of
apprenticeship, during which the inner voice is learning
expression. Even Amy Castles had to undergo arduous
hours of training before that voice of her became touched
and thrilled with exquisite sweetness. So it is with the inner
voice ;so it was with Victor Daley. His first poetic efforts
were contributed blushingly to a suburban paper in Adelaide.
Then he sought publication in Melbourne—not without
result—and emboldened by success knocked at the doors of
Sydney Punch , and later, while the Bulletin was yet a baby,
and Editor Archibald in possession of a palate uncloyed by
twenty years of verse-tasting, made his first appearance in
that journal. Into its pages his best work has gone, and
“ Dawn and Dusk,” in the main, is a collection of Bulletin
verses.


A dream of how we twain some dav,
Heedless of map or chart,
Will both take ship and sail away
Into the sunset’s heart.


Daley the man is business-like in appearance, and looks
not at all like a dreamer of dreams. He wears a trim beard,
and he does not wear long - hair. To such lengths does he
strike one as a man of the world, but there the resemblance
ceases. He knows that stocks and shares exist—at one time
he had to write leading articles for a daily paper—and I
daresay he knows the price of beef and bread, but he thinks
there are better things than stocks and shares in the world,
and more exalted mind-food than the price of bread and
meat. He talks excellently, with a charm of words and a
manner that fascinates. He is not rich, neither is he poor,
and he is both rich and poor—according to one’s point of
view. Some men gain a world and lose their souls. Daley
has gained a world without losing his soul. But it is not the
money-maker’s world. /


And when Death from a cloud above
His awful shadow flings,
The Spirit of Immortal Love
Will shield us with his wings.


DALEY’S LAND OE DREAMS
WE pass the gate ; a perfumed flower
Recalls a passion-laden hour,
And breezes heavy with its scent
Blow down beside its Lethe streams
And stir the drowsy poppies, bent
In Daley’s Land of Dreams.
At Dawn and Dusk ! At noon it seems
A warm sun sheds his golden beams,
And from the shine and shadow blent
His sweet song steals an added power
As from some frowning battlement
A mavis on an ivied tower.
The stars are lit ; the shadows lower ;
Dream-music fills the lilac-bower,
And I would be content, content
With such sweet songs, and such gold gleams,
Could all my dole of days be spent
In Daley’s Land of Dreams.


Of V. J. D
I TURN the poet’s page to see
What subtle part hath ravished me,
And wonder which we best might spare
Of all the treasures gathered there.
The art so delicate, so fine,
That to the soul each subtle line
Unfolds as daintily as those
Fair petals of the perfect rose ?
Nay, that must bide. The wondrous glow
Of ruby fire ? The tender flow
Of music rare ? The lilac scent ?
The witchery of the Orient ?
The wit ? The humor quaint, or the
Sly touches of diablerie ?
No, no ! The sadness then ? Stop thief !
We’ll not forego the poet’s grief.

A BALLADE EOR VICTOR DALEY.




AUSTRALIA’S debt to Victor Daley is so self-evident
to every lover of good literature that insistence on
the fact would be ridiculous. He has proved himself
the ablest verse-craftsman of this Southern Land ; of all our
poets he is the most delicately fanciful ; and of all the most
hauntingly Celtic. I join in wishing him every good and
perfect gift.
TO VICTOR DALEY I wish a renewed lease of life ; as
much wealth as it is good for a man to have ; and
a fair share of that fame which is the last infirmity
of noble minds.
“ Victor in Poesy, Victor in Romance.”
VICTOR J. DALEY (whom we are delighting to honour)
probably has no superior amongst present-day
exponents of the Celtic literary temperament. His
imagination teems with thoughts unfelt by any but the Celtic
writer ; and, although his Australian environment has pre-
vented their fullest expression, we have gems of his in prose
and verse to vie with the best of Catherine Tynan and Dora
Sigerson. What he has done for Australian letters we all

VICTORIOUS
NOT all who seek inherit
The piercing' coloured flower
It is the price of merit
That waits a patient hour.
Though age make manhood hoary,
And care eclipse like night,
He treads the heights of glory
Who wears the flower of light.
Long time he sought it, bringing
The high gods’ gift of song ;
They hearkened to his singing,
A pleased and silent throng.
And, while yet he is burning
With leaping lyric fire,
The gods, to ease his yearning,
Have granted his desire.
The years will but unfold it,
And time make fierce its flame :
’Tis his—to have and hold it—
The scarlet Flower of Fame.


“ Spellbound by a sweet fantasy
At even glow I stand
Beside an opaline strange sea
That rings a sunset land. ”


N A DREAM
AST night when all the world was still,
A fairy vision came to me :
, Methought this Earth was formed anew,
And owned the Power of Poesy.
For when the land was parched and dry,
And quivered ’neath the summer heat,
The far stream heard the Poet’s lay,
And hastened down to kiss his leet !
No ploughshare tore the bitter soil ;
The Bard sang to the Earth his song,
And lyrics into lilies bloomed,
While epic trees grew great and strong.
And he who had no song to sing,
Vain was his strength of arm or hand :
The new Earth took no heed of him,
And only Poets farmed the Land.
Now in this dream-world wandering,
Nigh to a large estate I strolled,
Where 10, above the ivory gate
A poet’s name was writ in gold !
Soft on the fragrant, verse-strewn sward
That haughty Croesus walked at ease,
Beside the fair song-blossomed beds,
Beneath his own soul-springing trees.
He was the richest settler round,
And three crops yearly harvested
I woke by some unhappy chance,
And so the fairy vision fled.
Not fled, not wholly fled, for us ;
Though, long as summer seasons roll,
No Power of Poesy or Song
May give this undine Earth its soul.
Yet still, while other blossoms fade,
And other memories pass and die,
Shall Daley’s flowers of fantasy
Bloom on in Memory Land for Aye.

ROAD WE TRAVEL.
DEDICATED TO
VICTOR J. DALEY.
THE gods have paved a highway
With flints of black-and-white ;
They call it—My-and-Thy-Way
The Way of them-who-write.
Beyond its thorny hedges
The Greener Lands unfold,
The purple of their edges
Is broidered deep with gold.
And tho’ those Lands out yonder
Lie sweet in Ease and Gain,
Our footsteps may not wander
Lrom out the Path of Pain,
But if this narrow Highway
Both hard and bitter be,
The Land of My-and-Thy-Way
Is fair to Thee and Me
2 3


“The sea hath its pearls.”


And from the fading- land the breeze shall bring- us, blowing low,
Old odours and old memories and airs of long ago.


The old man bent his weary head ;
The sunlight on his gray hair shone ;
His thoughts were with a woman dead
And buried, years and years agone ;


To VICTOR J. DALEY.
YOUTH wanders in enchanted ways
Where fays elusive dance,
Lapped in the dreams of singing days
The brave days of Romance.
Youth loves nor hearthstone warm and red,
Nor shelter of the vale ;
His fires are marsh-lights weird and dread,
And strange and spectre-pale.
His haunts are in the open lea,
Upon the wind-swept hill,
Or where the mist shrouds eerily
The wildwood dark and still.
You, Master, you have known desires
In your young days like these,
Have watched the dying of their fires
And sung their threnodies.
To you the laurel-wreath belongs
That crowns the true in Art,
For since you first sang, all your songs
Came welling from the heart
Like tears at twilight when hushed rooms
Seduce forth Passion’s throng,
Buried yet errant from their tombs
Upon the call of song.
With whom a lingering perfume stays,
With whom a glamour goes
Like old sweet flowers—a rose of days
Long dead, immortal rose.
Of love, most mystic, magic flower
Whose scents his incense be,
Whose every petal is an hour
Of Passion’s rosary.
And like a sad, remembered plaint,
The subtle violet,
A hermitage of fragrance faint,
The symbol of regret.


Such are the song's at dusk you sing
Amid the sunset gleams,
With your sad heart remembering
The spring-tide of your dreams.
Always in Spring the roses bloom
Each like a silken tent,
Always the summer twilit gloom
Is languid with their scent,
The fair skies sun-thrilled through and through
Recall the old love’s glance,
The wind blows wondrous as it blew
In days of dead Romance.
GEO. C. WHITNEY.




THE BURNS’ STATU
(For the Bulletin .)
WHAT statue needs the Bard of Ayr—
What sham memorial urns—
When Scotsmen carry everywhere
The name of Robert Burns ?
I see my Robert throned on high
Above this small eclat—
A-guaging- with his humorous eye
Casks of ambrosia.
When Scotland was from West to East—
Below the Highland Line
Owned by the Laird and sour-faced Priest
And damn-to-hell Divine ;
When every strutting little loon,
Whose kin a laird should ken,
Could go and take the causey’s croon
And spit on better men ;
Then midst that solemn sour-eyed gang,
And ilk, and kith, and clan,
He rose the first who ever sang
The Ballad of a Man.
The Ballads of the Border Frays,
The songs of Sword and Lance,
Were past, and all the Singing Days,
With Mary—and Romance.
The sweet old Scottish muse seemed dead
The Ploughman struck the Lyre,
And filled again her veins with red,
And set her heart afire
He little recks of creed or clan,
Or fanes or statues fair,
God’s noblest Home-made Gentleman,
My friend, the Bard of Ayr.
