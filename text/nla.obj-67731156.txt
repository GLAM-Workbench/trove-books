\ our most obedient, very humble Servant,


THE CAUSE OF IMPROVEMENT.
Since tlirough false education we,
Accursed millions see ;
We must destroy falsehood, and let
The millions blessed be !
ILLUSTRATION OF THE CAUSE OF IMPROVEMENT.
The truthful object of Education is to destroy ignorance, and to
establish the power of truth. Ignorance prevents mankind from
having a true knowledge of the Creator; and, therefore, as shall
be truly demonstrated, every degree of unhappiness is generated.
Truth is the infallible agent of the Creator, and the souls that
honestly adhere to it will ever possess, within themselves, the
unerring guide to wisdom, happiness, and bliss, God?s power is
ever at hand with them, to the end that they shall succeed in
the fulfilment of all objects tending to promote good amongst
each other ; not from selfish, but through noble motives of ac-
complishing, on this globe, the will of the Creator ! The will of
the Creator is that this globe shall spontaneously become , at least ,
a sojourn of bliss and glorification ! The means for acquiring this
exaltedness is to have a thorough knowledge of the Creator?s at-
tributes, and a due care that all our acts and thoughts shall be in
accordance with them. The Creator?s attributes are unerring
wisdom , unconquerable power , and infinite goodness. These ador-
able attributes are convincingly displayed in the benignant sun,
which daily creates life, sustenance, and joy to millions. The
heart must surely be morbid that refuses glorification to the
Creator of unbounded goodness. The man who receives a kind-
ness from another is esteemed no better than a monster, in being
ungrateful to his benefactor ; yet ignorance does not allow man-
kind to see that there could not be any gifts to be bestowed,
were the goodness of God withdrawn from the globe. This illus-
tration will, however, prove that the souls of the people have, as
yet, been so formed as to induce them to reject God, merely that
they might possess themselves abundantly of the bounties he has
ordained the globe shall produce for them, and that, in this un-
reasonable selfishness, they have lost sight of the main principle
in forming a sold; this principle is an honest adherence to the
attributes of the Diety , as stated above, without which no sold can
j)ossibly be complete. Many well-intentioned persons, among
whom Homer, Socrates, Belisarius, Virgil, Octavius Augustus
Caesar, and others mentioned in ancient history, together with


hundreds in modern history, have used their utmost endeavours
with the view of inducing the people to eschew falsehood and in-
justice, and devote their attention to the consideration of their
serious obligations to the Creator. Hut all has been, through
ignorance, as yet ineffectual; for it will be seen that selfishness
l?as at last so far prevailed over reason, that a system of penal
law is being established, calculated, insiduously, to direct men?s
minds henceforth, exclusively, to the pursuit of objects pleasing
to tyrants and the selfish alone, and directly opposed to the will
of the Creator ever being fulfilled on this globe ! The reveal-
ment of that resolution, secretly planned to misdirect men?s minds,
on this globe, ought to be disseminated in every degree of lati-
tude and longitude throughout the globe, where a human habita-
tion is found? 1 n this revealment, both the wisdom of the Creator
and the depravity of the -selfishness of mankind, are note being
brought to issue, and this statement is opportunely put forth,
with the hope that sufficient integrity may be ever in readiness
to insure an honest trial for a cause so vitally important ; for
surely the wisdom, power , and goodness of the Creator are worthy
of being duly advocated. It is as follows :
In the year of Christ 1 789, the Bourbon dynasty in Europe
had so far neglected the properly educating the people that France,
then governed by Louis the Sixteenth, was so seriously oppressed,
through maladministration, that the whole of the oppressed people
united themselves, overturned that wicked system of government,
and endeavoured to establish a republic, as a system better suited
to their wants. All the other governments of Europe, being
prehensive lest other nations might act as France did, united
their forces, just as occasion required, against h ranee, and finally,
in 1815 of the Christian era, overthrew the French nation.
It was on that eventful occasion that the perfidiousness of
education throughout Europe was demonstrated. The respective
governments of England (though supposed the best), successively
from IGBB to 1814, had so far imposed upon the English people,
as to have abstracted from the fruits of their industry the enor-
mous sum of about twenty-three hundred millions of pounds
sterling, under the pretence that that immense sum had been re-
quired to protect Great Britain, and support its honour and glory.
Now, on the overthrow of France in 1814, it was* in the power of
Great Britain to have established a model of a just and happy
system of governing the people, and of glorification to the Creator,
that couldnot have failed of being then imitated throughout all
Europe- ?and thence throughout other portions of the globe?for
as a great portion of the above money, surreptitiously taken from
the people, had been lavished in subsidizing those powers that,
aided Great Britain in the overthrow of France, therefore Great
Britain then possessed the power of much influence with those
rulers of Europe. But, far from amelioration, it appeared that the


governments had already prepared the people of Europe, through
long abuse of power, for yielding to wicked measures so artfully
contrived as that, if allowed to bo successful, neither love of
country, nor glorification of the Creator, could be, ever more,
displayed by any nation of Europe ; for the great rulers of Europe
had formed a coalition, binding themselves with the view of
crushing every attempt of the people of Europe to free themselves
from the future restraint by which they were to be governed ; the
rulers reserving to themselves alone all power over the people; whose
measure of happiness, consequently, should ever after that memor-
able year, immorally and irreligiously depend on the virtue of the
subserviency and art they might devise to please their respective
despotic rulers. And that state of things would have proved per-
fectly practicable in one or two succeeding generations, as educa-
tion in England had trained the rich ter the grand secret of both
obtaining, not only power to govern the people, but also power
over the produce of the labour, skill, and energy of the people, to
so great a degree, that everything needful to the support of human
existence?from the womb to death, and from that till the head-
stone marked out the final deposit of the body ?was made dear,
in order to contribute to the comforts of the governing powers, to
the great injury of the governed ; and the rich had also learned
how to restrain the education of the people, lest they should,
through useful knowledge, effectually discover the grand secret,
and annihilate, as France tried to do, its degenerating and de-
-7 � O
moralizing power; for even those of the people who had, through
the noble efforts of preceding ages, possessed honest power to
thwart the designs of the wicked, were now rendered so-base as
to have bartered away that power in returning those members
whose votes in the government had all but rendered Great Britain
a wholly depraved people. This was the condition of Great Bri-
tain in the year of Christ 1814, when a pretended hallowing was
thrown over the eyes of the people, to draw away their attention
from the all-destroying measures then begun, and still in practice,
all over Europe. All eyes seemed as if averted from God, and
fixed wholly upon a desire of obtaining possession of what God
had generously given. Obsequiousness became general. All em-
powered under the government, from the lord chancellor to the
sheriff s bailiff, from the judge to the police constable, and front
the premiership to the bribed voter at election, put forth their
respective claims for rewards ; the clergy prayed tor higher privi-
leges ; the subversion of the protestant religion was being zealously
prosecuted, and recantation was common ; lawsuits progressed in
due proportion to the wickedness practised throughout the king-
dom ; the suits of the poorer were soon lost ; the suits of the
richest might be moved from the lowest to higher seats of injus-
tice, and finally thrown into Chancery, where the property
in dispute may remain until the litigants died of distress,


or some other cause, and then the property was disposed of, not as
in accordance with the justice intended by the honest framers of
the court, but in accordance with the conscience of the managers of
the court. In short, as respected courts of law, it was folly for the
injured to pursue the injurer ; as the doing so would only, in nine
cases out of every ten, add to the injury : and so adroitly arrang-
ed were the plans ef the government, in producing every degree
of corruption, that it was in vain that the few well disposed en-
deavoured to check them ; for it was easier for one evil disposed
person to establish the practice of evil than it would be for a
hundred to prevent it?and this being the undisguised condition
of Europe, but. more particularly so of England, soon after send-
ing Napoleon first to Elba, and afterwards to St. Helena, and
when the secret measures for establishing despotism throughout
Europe were being put in force under auspices so powerful and
favorable as never before did attend an earthly scheme?surely
therefore the education of the people must have been most de-
plorably abject ! That being the most powerful scheme opposed
to the practice of humanity and the recognition of the attributes
of the Creator ever recorded ! Oh, reader, yet this is but a feeble
picture, of the state of things, at the time here alluded to, drawn
under the strictest censorship of discretion ?the object being solely
an honest desire to draw, if that non' is possible , the serious at-
tention of men and women to the obligation their superior posi-
tion, above all other creatures , imposes upon them ! The sophis-
try of a selfish few, has hitherto gulled the ignorant millions out
of the means provided for them, though inexhaustible as they are, ?
their ignorance, however, of the true attributes of the Creator, had
rendered them, wholly, into the power of a systematical despotism
at the period here alluded to, whence they could never free them-
selves, had not the Divine wisdom of the Creator provided a reme-
dy directly opposed to the prevailing opinions which the people
had been taught respecting the Creator, but yet most wonderfidhj
suited to the exigency of their dreadful condition.
The remedy, that is, the intervention of the Creator, is as
follows, viz.
There is a man now living in Victoria, who was born just before
the French revolution of 1789 broke out ?he was kind in infancy
and loved God so sincerely that, on seeing, as he thought, and
still believes to be, the insulting modes of worshipping the
Creator, he felt so displeased at such folly being every where
practised, that ho has objected to become a member of any of the
professing religious societies of the world, even to this present
date. This man?s view of God is, that His wisdom, power and
goodness are so benignly concentrated and brought to view in
the sun, in the construction of this globe, and in its inexhaustible
means of happiness, for rational creatures, as to be expressly
intended to elicit admiration, joy, love, and veneration, through-


out the whole globe, towards the Creator, from the created ; the
whole tending wonderfully to the all-noble end that eternal bliss
should be the result of the Creator?s design! When this man
understood the plan through which Ignorance resolved to oppose
the glorious design of the Creator, and that, apparently, all other
creatures directly and indirectly aiding in it, he offered himself as
a sacrifice to God, with the sincere desire of cheerfully enduring
throughout eternity, if needful , all the torments that his body
and mind are capable of enduring, on condition that God might he
pleased to bless his efforts in directing his fellow creatures to the
true sense of the love of God in the mind, the heart, the soul, and
thus defeat that plan ?this love is the perfection of Cod?s wisdom
displaying itself in the thoughts and acts of the truly wise and
good, and is ever exercising itself in promoting the Creator?s will
throughout the globe ; the Creator alone being the source whence
this love emanates ; it aims to act with God alone, and, there-
fore, its efforts arc ever successful, because being wisely and
godly designed, God blesses them to all good designs.
Theaboveis a disclosed truth which is now as verifiable as the ex-
istence of gold in Victoria is verifiable?then let, at least, as much
enquiry be manifested in testifying the truth of the love of God
being spontaneously produced in the heart of man, as has already
been made manifest in testifying the truth, that the province of
\ ictoria, a portion ofGod?s work also, as man is His work, has spon-
taneously produced that, which the heart of man is strenuously
pursuing throughout this prolific globe, Gold ! This enquiry
shall not, if made, be expensive?the reward having been already
most amply awarded, in the glorious triumph of God?s love hav-
ing been in due season, duly preferred, despite of falsehood,
before the love of God?s gold, in the heart of God?s creature,
man. Surely it cannot be longer insisted upon that God rejects
man s heart because of the wickedness of its nature. And this
victory,' how rejected soever it may he hy the lovers of gold, will ever
be glorious?for, admitting the dreadful case of selfishness pre-
vailing, and that the governments of Europe should succeed in
their united scheme for enslaving the people, to the end, that the
love of God shoidd not he more sincerely evinced any more in Europe
than it is in Asia or Africa; yet this globe has not been unpro-
ductive of glorificatiomto its Creator, even though it were to have
produced no more than one truly venerating being in confirmation
of the will of the Creator?the universe presents so many millions
of globes that the abortiveness, and consequent destruction, of even
many of them, would only affect their respective inhabitants, not
the Creator; whose wisdom, power and goodness transcend all
casualties. He aims at perfection and the honest Cosmographer,
who is a link assisting in this aim of the Creator, and the heart
who proves sincerity to the Creator, in being in his aim, like God,
tr �ly a��d to His fellow creatures, the proof of loving God ; these


are infallible proofs of the wisdom, power and goodness of tlie
Creator?these, through the power of their minds, show how na-
ture proceeds, and in so doing prove how near to perfection this
globe has already progressed?and, in confirmation of these
proofs, it has been in the hope that this progression should not be
interrupted, but allowed to continue on its direct course, to con-
summation, that the man above alluded to, was induced to give
himself, expressly to the Creator, as before stated ; nor has either
all nor any of the circumstances occuring since then in the world,
induced him to regret making that vow. And let the very limited
liberty then of worshipping the Creator under penal restrictions,
be contrasted with the mighty power now attainable, with com-
parative facility, through the all-powerful information here given
to adopt any wise and godly measures for establishing the will of
the Creator, the deduction proves that the minds of the wise and
good spontaneously formed\ are the true agents through whom the
Creator has ordained perfection throughout this globe ! When
that man?s soul was moved, upwards of fifty years ago, to incline
itself rather to the love of God than to a love" of the things which
His goodness gives us ; the powers of Europe were then prose-
cuting those measures which if allowed to be successful, would,
most positively, have enslaved all Europe, and, perhaps encou-
raged the continued enslavement of the other portions of the
globe, on the ignorant principles previously inculcated; conse-
quently, as no earthly power was prepared to oppose those ungodly
measures , it then became absolutely needful that the Creator should
vindicate His men wisdom, power and goodness , and thus , in having
done so through his own work , man, has manifested himself to the
soul which , in due progress towards perfection , was sufficiently
matured to act as his faithful advocate. It is right to state here
that the love of God is not instilled into this man?s heart from
gratitude for blessings received in the course of his own existence on
earth , but in veneration of the infinite goodness ?of the Creator who
has stored this earth with the means of happiness and bliss for mil-
lions of millions of creatures. The truth of the foregoing is as
verifiable now as the gold in Victoria.
The following truth, verifiable by statistics of the British go-
vernment, should enlighten every intelligent mind upon the folly
of allowing fallaciousness to prevail in governing a nation. It
occurred that two of the soldiers, who had sworn to truly and
faithfully serve and defend the Crown of the United Kingdoms
of Great Britain and Ireland, during the war against the Em-
peror Napoleon, did, after ten years? service, under the same im-
pression ol mind as soldiers, change from each other in opinion as
to the true performance of their respective duties in accordance
with the oath they had bound themselves by. That change, in
opinion, took place on the overthrow of the daring enemy, and
the insidious commencement of the proceedings of the trovern-
AO o


ments of Europe to enslave the nations they respectively
ruled. One of the two soldiers believed that the true interest
of the Crown consisted in the people being ruled in truth and
Justice the other soldier joined with the governments
who began to establish the sway of untruth and in-
justice throughout Europe?this soldier did so diligently
serve the government that they loaded him with gifts not only
sufficient to enrich himself but also his posterity, and at his death
they exhibited every possible proof of regret at the loss they had
sustained in the death of so great an advocate ol their plan.
The other soldier knowing that the salvation of Europe depended
upon the withdrawing of the power and influence of the British
government from the other governments, which could only, as he
thought, be done by elucidating the matter to the King; he. there-
fore, devised every effort with so much judgment and caution, that
notwithstanding the great severity of the restrictions established
by the government, to conceal the viliany of their proceedings,
he succeeded eventually though, through exertions the most ha-
rassing and injurious to human existence, and that perhaps , are
endut able only through the grace of God! in bringing the govern-
ment, the people, and the King to issue upon the wickedness of the
government?but the power of the government was so mighty
that it was only by unceasing perseverance his object has, at last,
been ! First, Castlereigh being discarded by George
the Fourth, was the first whose conscience experienced a shock,�a
bitter fruit, from the infamous scheme which he himself allowed
to be contrived?George the Fourth next felt remorse on being-
shown that his hand not only tended to degenerate and deprave
his subjects, in depriving them, by means of unjust laws, of the
honest way of supporting existance ; but also to have them hanged
like so many dogs and cats for the depravedness they had been
led to be guilty of, not throuyh nature but through inched
laws. Louis XVIII, the tool of the tyrants, and Alexander of
Kussia next felt the sting of conscience. On the death-bed days
of George the Fourth the leading powers resolved on consumma-
ting the success of their plans by, as they intended, definitively
destroying the Press ! They had it put down everywhere at
that period, except at London and at Paris?in May 1830, the
soldier, who closely watched the proceeding of the governments with
the view of frustrating their plan, by the withdrawal of British aid
from them, entered the House of Commons, and preferred the
charge of betraying the nation, against Peel and Wellington; so
perfectly, forcibly and successful did this bold attack prove to be
that the ministers found they were too strongly surrounded by
the truthfulness of the charge to hazard more exposure
of themselves by any other proceeding than honourably dis-
missing him, the soldier, from the custody of the Sergeant
at Arms, where he had been detained from Saturday 19th, to


Monday 21st !?but though those ministers succeeded 111 �?ettin <r
the Parliament, a full House too ! (it having met to trv a liar-
rack Master General on a charge of embezzlement) to" let pass
that charge against Peel and Wellington, without a due inquiry,
yet it proved the truth of two very important things; namely,
that those two ministers, were guilty of the charge brought against
them, and that that House of Common?s was equally as corrupt
as the ministers ! ! George the Fourth was buried in a month
after that?and the persevering friend of the crown and people of
the United Kingdom, the soldier, put a manuscript statement of the
depraved condition of the kingdom into the hands of William the
Fourth and his Queen in three days after the burial of George
the Fourth?A illiam the Fourth took immediate measures for
breaking up the corrupt dens whence Whigs and Tories had po-
inted the people during a ruinous period of 150 years?and thus
were both the soldier, who had given himself to the service of the
Governments against the liberty and independence of Europe, and
the British government acting under him, prevented, through the
measures taking place under the direction of William the Fourth,
from assisting the Tyrant kings of the Continent in a mortal blow
at the press?the press is now quite free in Great Britain, and
the blow was therefore , struck, not in London but in Paris, where
the tyrants suffered a partial repulse. The design of eventually
enslaving the people has been, since 1830, prosecuted under cover
of Diplomacy?but there is reason note to hope that the Crown of
the L nited Kingdom shall never again be endangered by its merely
professing supporters. The Anti-Corn league, the Anti-War
league, and the power of knowledge through the press must al-
ready have warned the Crown upon its danger through fallacy.??
God, as certain as Europe exists , has peculiarly befriended Great
Britain, through the above matters?there is no doubt but that
the hearts of those who have worn that Crown, during the last
half-century were inclinable to God. George the Fourth removed
his wicked minister from his council and ordered enquiry into the
cause of crime?William the Fourth ordered a reform in the mode of
supplying the Parliament with members?and the curse of the
Whig and Tory factions is being removed under Queen Victoria,
?and the heart, whether it be in the most exalted or in the
humblest of any human form, and strives to be truly good, has
the power of God with it to enable it to accomplish the good it
aims at?but it must be ever minded that nothing introduced by
the mortals of this globe can be blessed but that which emanates
from the heart which is truly good?the Creator is all goodness?
the honest heart is the perfection of the Creator?s wisdom, dliis
heart commands God?s power, and is therefore good.
Had the kings and people of Europe been honestly instructed pre -
vious to the year 1814 when, on sending the tyrant Napoleon, as he
was called, to Elba, they might have united, through a perfect free-


dom of the press, the then isolated knowledge of Europe, what an
inexhaustible means they would thus have possessed themselves of
for progressing in freedom, prosperity, and happiness, through the
proper pursuit of agriculture, trade, commerce, and all other bene-
ficial employments,?but Machiavel, not tied, being their in-
structor they broke faith with France, in forcing the reign of bigotry
and tyranny upon that brave nation, who, overpowered by the
force of circumstances, yet using the language of brave men, re-
jected the superstitious and hyprocritical Bourbon?on which
rejection it was so planned that JNapoleon was induced to quit Elba
to lead those who might yet be able to defend France, in
opposition to the scheme of the Allied Powers, to the battle of
Waterloo, where they were utterly destroyed, and through which
the union ol depraved principles ever since enforced against all
that is good in Europe was consummated ! Again, if the Allied
Powers did not resolve upon enslaving Europe, why did they force
the Bourbon, Louis XVIII as king of France??why did they
let Napoleon land from Elba with a few hundred men in France,
when the people of France offered reason against the proposed
tyranny of Louis XVIII? why did the Allied Pow r ers, when
the last of the republicans were destroyed at Waterloo, again force
the Bourbon despot upon the French nation, as king, and then
support him there with their armies, until he firmly established
himself as a despot king ??if the allied powers had not resolved
upon enslaving Europe, why has no nation been allowed the liberty
of the press from 1814 even till now, 1853 ; Great Britain, alone
is a noble exception; but this exception confirms, in the strongest
possible sense, the resolution of the allied powers to enslave the
people of Europe. From 1814, to the death of Castlereagh, and
from thence till at the death of George the Fourth, Wellington
and Peel resigned their power over the British Government,
all the Governments of Europe acted in accordance with the reso-
lution of the allied powers to enslave the people?but we have
thepowernow to see, that, because God has been pleased to inter-
pose his watchful Providence on behalf of Great Britain, that
all the other governments are, at least , unfriendly towards Great
Britain. Why is not that unanimity still preserved by all the
courts of Europe, which prevailed whilst the enslaving chain was
being striven to be riveted upon nation after nation, from 1814,
till at last Russia is preparing to dispute the propriety of the
British Crown itself, being composed of all its magnificent gems !
It is now clear that Great Britain and Russia cannot possibly
pursue a despotic course without the strictest security that, on
achieving Iheir object, the strongest power shall not infringe
upon the rights of the weaker. But Great Britain has enabled
Russia to become not only in itself the most gigantic of despotic
powers, but in also strengthening that power by alliance with
the other despotic powers. Then in what does the security of
c


the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain consist ?
Does that security depend upon the fidelity of the despotic Czar,
and the power to keep mankind in endless servility and de-
pravity ? Should this question merit affirmative or negative con-
sideration ? Should it be resolved that the British Crown should
depend on that security; then the soldier who joined the British
government in all the measures that have tended to bring the
British Crown to its present position, merited all the riches and
honors conferred upon him, and all efforts made to prevent its
being reduced to its present position were devoid of sense !
Now, although the majority of those to whom a decision in the
important matter, here submitted for consideration, might decide,
without reflecting on the variety of interests it involves, (which
must be expected as the result of the corruption so long swaying
the dispositions of mankind,) yet the minority might feel disposed
to pursue its solution with great fervor. That millions of our
fellow creatures should, annually , be pronounced accursed, some
in this world, and more in the next, by the very persons too , who
assume to themselves alone the privilege of preventing this curse ,
is a state of things that a true knowledge of our Creator cannot
endure without opposition. Those persons, though but few
comparatively in number, who, in 1814, had the power either to
prevent or encourage a continuance of so anomalous a course, in
the then advanced maturity of the world, have, since then, been
removed from that exalted position, to another more or better
suited to the disposition of the spirit that animated them. God s
decree is that this globe should prove the purity of his Divine
attributes through a due progressive impiovement towards per-
fection. To this end He allows perfect freedom to the spirit that
animates matter, in every shape or form whatever. God alone
being sole arbiter of the due degree of improvement, at which
perfection is attained ; therefore perfection is a spontaneous pro-
duction of Nature ; and perfect happiness being the result of
perfection, which is only attainable through the pure love of God
being indelibly fixed in the heart, consequently the Creators
grand design shall have been fulfilled when the globe exhibits
beings in the full enjoyment of that happiness for which it is,
unquestionably, in every way prepared by the wisdom, power,
and goodness of the Creator ! Those who resolved in 1814 to
encourage the progress of the accursed state of things then pre-
vailing, were, each of them, men highly favoured by nature in
the structure of their bodies?they possessed riches enough to
enable them to adorn their persons with all the embellishments of
ar t?their minds were formed through a study of the knowledge
then extant ?they might acquire any, and every accomplishment
and grace suited to their respective dignities?two being emperors,
others kings, others plenipotentiaries ?their influence extended
itself over millions of beings of their own species, who were all


willing to obey them in the practice of truth, and imitate their
virtues, even till happiness should be attained, and the glorifica-
tion of the benificent Creator should, eventually, displace the
then prevaling folly of the human species! Aow, as those
emperors, kings, and plenipotentiaries, who were in the position
of perfect beings, neglected to perform the duty of perfect beings,
when they had full power to perform that duty, it is too mani-
fest that they were so very utterly ignorant or regardless of the
attributes of the Creator, as to direct their zeal to the accom-
plishment of an object which, if attained, would completely frus-
trate the Creator?s glorious design ! Then it follows as a pure
truth that both the religion and education, through which those
men?s minds were formed and prepared to act in this world, are
too erroneous, too false, and too preposterous to be tolerated as
the instructors of any people !
Is it not then, from all the foregoing, become incumbent upon
mankind to question the propriety of accepting as truth, the
doctrine hitherto promulgated regarding the destiny of the
spirit on the dissolution of the human body ? The Creator
requires perfection, in beings produced on this earth or globe, as
a result in confirmation of his wisdom, power, and goodness, dis-
played in the design of so magnificent a dwelling ! It is an
inexhaustible means of bliss for those who shall know the Creator,
and act with him ! It surely must be for them alone that his
providence attends it! The goodness of the Creator is un-
bounded, his wisdom has devised, and his power enforces; there-
fore an obstruction resolved upon by the beings of this globe,
that is calculated to be opposed to the will of the Creator being
finally established, must endanger the utter destruction of the
v 7 O
globe, and produce confusion and remorse to the spirits that
caused that destruction? if it is a truth that the soul never dies !
Again, as to the destiny of the spirit, mankind, in order to
arrive at a correct conclusion on this vital subject, must eschew
every appearance of sophistry, and be guided solely and wholly
by the unsophisticated reasoning whence pure truth is elicited.
The Creator?s object in creating this globe is, that it should be
the abode of blessedness. To this end it is replete with abun-
dance of everything that can be required to produce perfect
inhabitants. That perfection is attainable through the proper
use of the means which the Creator has already provided. JNow,
if the spirit, that directs the body in the disposal of these means ,
or any portion of them, perform its office with the 'purest desire
to fulfil the mill of the Creator , this is a perfect being ; but if it
be through ignorance, or any motive deviating from the purest
desire to fulfil the will of the Creator, that the spirit is actuated,
it is an imperfect being ! But perfection is attainable?and a
due knowledge of the formation of the materials of which the
globe is constructed?the growth of vegetation and animals upon
C 2


it?and the progress of all things in improvement, through the
law infused into nature, even till the heart, soul, mind, or spirit,
which rules the body, becomes so perfectly sensible of the un-
bounded goodness of the Creator, that its utmost delight consists
in the purest love towards the Creator, for this unbounded good-
ness?all this is calculated to lead to two conclusions, first, that
perfection is attainable, and secondly, to produce almost a con-
viction that the spirit which is imperfect on the death of the
human body, does not quit this globe before it shall hare become
perfect through some further process suited to that end in natures
law !
There is one more circumstance that bears very power-
fully upon this subject. The man already alluded to, and who
is ready at the hour this illustration is being written to prove that
God is ever ready to bless every wise and good effort, of any
good soul, has been fifty years successfully devoted to the service
of mankind. As he depended solely for success through aid
from God alone, he restrained all his acts and thoughts by the
purest motives. This exposed him to a sea of troubles, through
which it was utterly impossible for him to have pursued his
noble course, had not the providence of God always attended
him. On the accomplishment of that portion of his design, upon
which depended final success, he was so completely overpowered,
that he supposed no more was needful to be done by him, and he
cheerfully resignedhimself to death; hisbody,ashe then thought, be-
ing so utterly enfeebled as not to be able to bear further hardship.
Whilst in that perfectly resigned state, a voice addressed him in
the most affectionate accents and words, calling him by his name,
so very often and at a time of day, for several successive days, so
convincingly, as to have rendered the circumstance impossible of
either deception or oblivion, the name of the spirit addressing
being added ; it was that of a good creature, who had laboured
hard for her support while in human form?and whom this
oppressed man sincerely respected; he had attended her body
to its grave a few years previous to this circumstance. Her
merit, as far as he was able to discern, consisted in being truly
honest and kind.
This man is now in the enjoyment of witnessing, to his heart?s
highest satisfaction, the steady progress of events towards a reali-
zation of the object his soul yearned for during a half century ?
the frustration of the most mighty scheme for keeping mankind
in a state of perpetual slavery ! The British Government is in
the hands of men who are at last brought to a due sense of the
anomalous position to which the British Crown is now reduced
with respect to its relation either in the carrying out, or, of
opposing tyranny, in Europe ! The proper time for averting
all the evils which have been inflicted since 1814, and which may
vet be inflicted upon the people, was on sending Napoleon to


Elba, and not to have made his escape from thence (whether
palpably screened or not), a pretence for unsheathing the sword
against all that can render mankind the glorious proof of omnipo-
tent wisdom ! But, as the ports of Europe are at last free to
embark the most oppressed and poorest people in ships, laden
also with merchandise, to California, Sydney, Victoria, or any
other place where the wisdom of the Creator has stored the earth
with abundance of that gold by means of which the poor can
easily defeat the wicked designs of all tyrants, by learning how
to instruct each other, through the mighty press, in all that
affects their interests either in a human or any other form, need-
ful to fix them for eternity in bliss ! Therefore, enough has
now been stated to arouse those whose minds are inclined to
be good?it is utter loss of time to write for the reformation of
those whose souls are made up of the various ingredients that
compose the corruption of the world; they live by it, and cannot
understand a sentence opposed to corruption ; it, in a word, is
their Constitution ! But it is not a law in nature that good and
bad should amalgamate-?every thing opposed to good prospers
hut for a short time, whilst what is good lasts as long as the globe
itself lasts ! Then, let the good commune with the good, through
the press, and it will soon be found that bad hearts wall not be
able, with their utmost cunning, to conceal their evil deeds under
a cloak of specious virtue. There is this all-invigorating property
in goodness, that it recognises itself in every part of the globe;
uniting its influence and exercising its virtues to a degree that
ensures happiness ! How great, then, the opportunity afforded by
the gold of Victoria for spreading throughout the world infor-
mation calculated to enlighten every nation upon matters affect-
ing their vital interests ; but which, were it not for the gold,
might never be revealed ! The sea-ports of Australasia are
thronged with ships from all parts of the globe, wdiich return,
taking back with them as passengers, thousands enriched with
gold, to the wTetchedly governed countries whence they were
induced to migrate, in the hope of procuring freer and happier
homes in this distant land. Alas ! God provided not only the
gold, but land more precious by far than gold ; but a European
Government instructed a people who rules all, and w r ho, knowing
not how to rule honestly , drives aw r ay from that part of Australasia
called Victoria, through misrule, all who get gold enough to go
to some country better governed ! Those returning to their
respective native lands, or who may settle in other lands, are both
richer and wiser than they could have been by remaining at their
own homes ; this is a circumstance highly conducive to the spread
of useful knowledge ; and, undoubtedly, will at once prove to be
the strongest opposition to the farther advance of tyranny, and
the greatest promoter of a true knowledge of God; all that is
required to insure the spread of truth, happiness, and bliss !


EDUCATION.
The strictest adherence to the consideration of three things is
absolutely necessary to produce a complete education, or,
which is the same thing, to form perfect minds; these are, Firstly,
honest parents, happily circumstanced, to the end that there
should not be any cause for their children acquiring either evil
practices or being corrupted by bad example, previous to being
placed under a teacher. Secondly, interdiction, of all religious
teachers, to secure the minds of the scholars from being misin-
formed relative to the Creator by any of the false creeds which
have, during too long a period, been, as already proven, tools in
the works of tyranny; whilst, through penal laws, knowledge has
been interdicted, and its noble advocates compelled to brave the
endurance of pains and penalties in circulating what of it is yet
useful in the world ! Thirdly, competent masters and teachers
whose qualifications, respectively, should depend on letters written
by themselves; and which,being submitted to the consideration of
a competent number of qualified scrutineers for approval, would
secure the desideratum in the due management of aschool; because
letters of recommendation to fill most important situations have,
hitherto, been procurable by utterly unfit persons, whose incom-
petency, though imperceptibly, has increased the vexations of so-
ciety ; whilst, in many cases, the competent have been rejected
through false prejudices and corrupt motives. If, therefore, any
impression, calculated to produce lasting good, can be imprinted
on the minds of the members who form the Legislature of Victoria,
it will consist of circumstances affecting education. The truthful
circumstances adduced in illustrating the necessity of the cause of
improvement in education, clearly demonstrate that God?s power
is vainly sought to promote evil?but that a mind, purely inclined
to God, shall have the power of God with it even to the accom-
plishment of the good it desires, however great or small that good.
Then it is the forming of purely honest minds that must engage
the attention of an honest legislator; because he knows tha
the blessing of God would expedite every step necessary
in accomplishing so glorious a work. How infinitely great, there-
fore, in estimation of the Creator, would that legislator be who
would lend a helping hand and heart in establishing a power on
this beautiful globe that should, under the supervision of the
Creator, remove from it the follies through which it has too long
progressed in evil! Noportion of the globe presents, so noble a
field as Victoria doesforthe display of a mind so disposed. Forhow
numerous soever well disposed minds may be in Asia, Africa,and
Europe, yet the iron of tyranny and the withering influence of
false education and false religion, have too strong a hold of the


heart in those places. The Americans may not, perhaps, trample
under toot the power to be great and good given to them by the
honest Washington, California has already laid the foundation
upon which it is quite optional to erect the standard of eternal
bliss or earthly vicissitudes. There could be no very injurious
acts without a remedy w r ere men wise and the laws just. But in
Victoria, 0 Victoria! the evils which exist are yet but on the
surface?they are not so firmly rooted as that an honest legisla-
ture cannot destroy and remove for ever those obstructions, to the
spread of truth and the growth of wisdom, prosperity, and happi-
ness. There are every where to be found men of good intentions
but selfishness misdirects them. Every legislator, however, has
sense enough to understand how to avoid passing acts, through his
own hand, into law, which might, at a futnre time, perhaps, have
the effect of reducing himself and wife to a state of indigence, and
expose his children to the chance of having recourse to the prac-
tice of duplicity, in order to procure food and the other demands
needful to a comfortable existence : but this sound sense has not
yet shown itself through legislation in Victoria, as respects
the poor ! The Creator has stored Victoria with acres and gold
enough to enable millions of mankind to prove, by their
happy position, that they are grateful for the blessings bestowed
upon them ; but the law r s of Victoria are opposed to the design
of the Creator! for the acres and gold are so unwisely disposed
of as to enable one man to enrich himself sufficiently to be a le-
g'.slator, upon the immoral principle of exposing one hundred to
the danger of becoming practisers of evil! W T ere the legislature
of \ ictoria al?owed to legislate upon a principle so prolific of evil
as that hitherto pursued by it, truth, justice,'and honesty must
fly from a place so accursed: where plunder and murder are rife, and
where the land is made to produce dust and fires instead of
corn-fields and green meadows The law, too, relative to education
as it is at present, will leave power in the clergy to mould the minds
of the pupils, intrusted to their charge, to suit the purposes, not of
a happy society, but of the clergy themselves; who, with re-
spect to their various sects, have as strict an eye to enlarging
their respective interests as any of the other trades or professions
of the world. An instance elucidative of this corruptive state
of things exists at Buninyong ; a town so closely surrounded by
thousands of acres of rich lands in the possession of half a dozen
men, favored by the laws to such an extent, that there is no reserve
secured for the poor of the town. The legislature placed one
hundred and twenty pounds on the estimates, in January 1852,
for teachers at Buninyong. There w?ere then two teachers at
Buninyoung; one was the parson of the only place of worship there;
the other pursued a religious course suited to his own idea of God.
I his teacher w r as so much esteemed for his superior method and
skill in expediting education that, as the parents of more than


half the children of the town appeared unable to pay him, even
moderately, for his services, they energetically appealed to the
Colonial Secretary to allow him a due portion of the sum voted to
teachers at Buninyong; the Secretary referred the application to
the denominational board?the Board replied to the Colonial Se-
cretary that ?as the application was not recommended by a
clergyman it could not be complied with.? The board did as it
suited its own views with the money ; the parents were unable to
employ an efficient master to instruct their children, upwards of
twenty in number ; therefore the children must, of necessity, re-
main without education, or else be compelled to receive it from the
parson, there not being due encouragement for a proper mastsr at
that place. This case with the other objections to the board would,
if properly inquired into, clearly prove that the education of the
children of Victoria should be secured upon a better basis than
that fragile thing through which nothing but briars and thistles
are yet perceptible; every possible contrivance is being put in force
to prevent a true knowledge of the Greater. Habit and profit
render ignorance acceptable.
It is to be hoped that truth enough has now been published to
convince every reflective mind, not opposed to a reliance upon the
Creator being needful in the affairs of mankind, that ?the neces-
sity of improvement in the national system of instructing the peo-
ple of Victoria, in wisdom and happiness,? has been clearly
established upon ground work immovable! The legislature, then,
of Victoria has the power, if it gives its will, to prove to the whole
world, by substantially reforming existing abuses and adopting
measures calculated'm future to destroy, in the bud, every appear-
ance of evil throughout the territory; that neither the acres,
though unbounded, nor the gold, though incalculable, nor even both
united, are sufficient to prevent its gratitude, love, and veneration
of God, the Creator, from being evidently, shown through the
wisdom of its measures for turning the minds of the people towards
God. v
Proper masters and teachers for aiding the government are
easily procurable for either public or private teaching, provided the
legislature is itself determined to watch the progress of the
rising generation in useful knowledge and protect the teachers,
lest that through undue influence any school should suffer.
The first step in which should consist of a sound knowledge
of correct reading, writing letters, arithmetic, and English
grammar. These are branches so soon acquirable, under the
care of an honest teacher, that but very few children are
incapable of being sufficiently masters of them to be found useful
for a shop or counting house by the age of ten years. Mayor's
Spelling, with a little improvement, Walkingame?s Tutor?s A ssistant,
and John Turner?s Intellectual English Grammar aregood initiatory
books, and well adapted to enable a teacher of sense to make an


efficient first effort to expand the reflecting faculty, and prepare tke
mind for receiving at an early age truth, and expelling falsehood '
It would be sheer folly to expect that sound education can be in-
sured either by not paying teachers a salary that shall render
them independent whilst employed as teachers, or by insisting that
they shall teach an unreasonable number of pupils. Teaching any
branch of education (except what can be well acquired in reading
classes) to anumber of pupils in a class, retards, both the progress of
the cleverest and due exertion in those that are dull. Every sum
in arithmetic?every exercise in grammar, French or any other
language?and every problem in mathematics, should be worked on
a slate by the pupil, according to the rules for each, respec-
tively, and brought to the teacher; who, being quite com-
petent to detect errors at a glance, should cross the errors to he
corrected by rule so that a thorough knowledge of each branch
should be indelibly fixed, by practice, on the mind. By this
method every pupil, male and female, can be solidly prepared to
render at an early age both great service to their parents, benefac-
tors, or any requiring their services; and, as they undoubtedly will,
by pursuing knowledge to a matured age, be of credit to themselves
and ornaments in the highest state of society. But this happy state
of tilings can never be arrived at by the pursuit of selfish motives.
The legislature is in honor bound to protect the poor, to the end
that no parent, who is desirous to labour honestly for the support
of himself and family, should be rendered unable to do so praise-
worthy a duty through laws which confer lands, houses, water,
wood, cheap laws, influence, and, in short,all advantages upon some,
by reducing too many to a state of penury, and through penury to
criminality! This was the destructive kind of legislation pursued
by the legislature of England from 1689, when the legislature
mortgaged the produce of labour upon a principle?the national
debt?that gave the legislature power to demoralize millions by
renderng honest pursuits unprofitable, and encouraging the prac-
tice of wickedness as a better means of procuring a comfortable ex-
istence ! That state of things could not have been so long
endured by a wisely educated people?but somebody has said that
?mankind were then divided into two great classes, viz., rogues
and fools/ 1 Then the legislature of 1689 was composed of rogues,
who embraced the opportunity of laying the foundation of enrich-
ing both themselves and their successors in office, through the
ignorance, and the results of the ignorance that has ever since pre-
vailed; for although criminal proceedings, when detected , are pun-
ished, yet they as well as the most virtuous labour, where directed
%J t/ 7
to the augmentation of the exchequer by taxation, and to the
strengthening the power of the legislature, to do as it pleased?.
h being protected by its influence on judges, courts of law, police
magistrates and gaolers, and the clergy, and their influence on
their respective .congregations, and by the influence of a portion
1� 2


of the salaries received by all these being expended in bestow*
ing patronage ! Now all the foregoing means of cursing a
nation, although being but partially transmitted from the mother
country to this, yet it can only be prevented from taking root
in Victoria, by wisely educating the rising generation. Minds
prepared, by a due exercise in the pursuit of truth, and
in the knowledge necessary to carry on trade, commerce,
and the other occupations of an enterprising nation, will
be in a proper position to earn, by ability and fidelity,
independence in any society ; those social duties which are neces-
sary to promote the good of society will soon become familiar, and
by all being duly qualified to transact business profitably, under
security of laws that protect the good and punish the wrong doer,
without expense to the injured party ; all this efficiency would tend
to honesty, prevent defalcations in trade, and establish mutual
confidence. The lands and gold of Victoria are more than ample
to afford lucrative employment for millions; provided the legis-
lators dispose of them in the noble aim of affording the people
every possible opportunity for securing to themselves happy
homes?uncontrolled freedom of conscience to venerate the
Creator, not as others dictate, but, in accordance with the good
desires of their own individual hearts ; to the end that they may
have full power to prove, by honest conduct towards each other,
that they are desirous to be found worthy of the Creator?s bless-
ing upon them, in whatever form through his wisdom, power, and
goodness, they are designed to exist. Were the legislative coun-
cil of Victoria condescending enough to recognise this effort, un-
dertaken solely to serve the nation, whilst there is yet time?the
great crisis of human affairs being at hand! ?it would show the
whole world, through the prosperity and happiness of the people,
in a few years, that the Creator is ever present to bless every
effort of a nation united in promoting its own happiness and the
glorification of the Creator without whose love being steadfast
in the heart, no mortal can succeed with due satisfaction?and
with whose love in the heart every mortal can rely with perfect
security on success and the highest degree of satisfaction in all
his undertakings.
In conclusion, then, it should ever be born in mind, that the
surest road to eternal bliss begins with virtuous instructions
from parents to their children?these are again to be instructed
by duly qualified teachers, either at the private cost of parents,
or at schools supported by the Government, in every branch of
learning necessary to render them, whether males or females , in
the first place, good readers, correct accountants, and sensible
letter writers in English ; then the mathematics, rather than
Hebrew and Greek, should be correctly taught; geography, his-
tory, astronomy, vestiges of natural historv of creation, and
whatever can be acquired by reading should be taught, on the


interrogative system, in classes. Drawing, music, dancing,
French, or any more useful language, and the solid rudiments of
Latin are accomplishments that, when added to a useful educa-
tion, confer social advantages which render existence under a
wise Government, not only desirable, but delightful! and man-
hood when so attained, would be duly prepared to devote enlight-
ened energies as well to matters affecting individuals, as to those
affecting the prosperity of the nation; the minds of the people
would be matured for contemplation ; and as all doubt respecting
the proper duty of mankind, towards the Creator, would then
begin to be effectually destroyed for independent, noble, and
highly exalted dispositions, would leave no cause for the formation
of sect or party ; God?s love would manifest itself, among the
people, as evidently as the sun displays his wisdom, power and
goodness in the unbounded provision made through the virtues
it diffuses for their happiness, even, as is evidently ordained by
the Creator, until their course should end in bliss ! But as there
are so many obstructions in the approach to this blissful road in
Victoria, therefore it is that the Legislature, through whose
wisdom these obstructions shall have been opportunely displaced,
will, in that glorious act, do more to reconcile tyrants to a desire
of bestowing liberty and independence upon their subjects, than
would all the cannon and missiles of war to be opposed on behalf of
liberty to the Czar of Russia and his affianced satellites, who are
on the eve of so disposing their powerful forces as to insure, ac-
cording to their view, both the final destruction of the press, and
the debasement of what nobleness of mind may yet remain in
Europe. But these tyrants would do well to reflect that man-
kind are destined by an all-wise disposer of events for a noble
purpose, and that those who, forty years ago, concocted the basis
upon which these successors of those tyrants have been, ever
since, enabled to enforce their hatred of the spread of knowledge,
have themselves been compelled to obey the summons of a power,
to whose decree they must submit, lie being more mighty than
they ! whilst, as if to contemn such schemes, the only mortal faith-
fully opposed to them does yet live, and is possessed of confidence
enough in the goodness of the Creator to inspire him with the
belief that God?s power would attend the legislative acts that
should wisely aim at establishing the general practice of truth
and justice throughout Victoria?and through the same confi-
dence, that every member of council who joins in the passing of
these acts, shall enjoy the happiness of seeing tyranny compelled
to yield to the power of truth and justice in Europe, and this too,
even under direction of the council that Queen Victoria has
selected to guard from error legislative acts affecting the interests
o # o O
of the people, who, in the course of events, are intrusted to her
care. There are, even now, at the eve of the final issue of this
long contested struggle of principle, proceeding/ Jrom the Creator ,


against all that is censurable in mankind, men and ships ready
to convey to all parts of Europe the glad news that not only
do the fields of Victoria afford opportunities for produc-
ing abundance of food for man and beast?gold in abundance
O O # t
to enable the people to supply themselves, from ships in the har-
bours, with all the materials necessary for cultivating the fields,
and also for laying up stores of the luxuries of other nations, to
increase the comforts of the people ?but what is more wonderful
that, contrary to the oppressive measures of European nations,
both the legislative council and the people are united in resolution
to acknowledge that as, notwithstanding the enormity of their
demerits, these gifts are so bountifully bestowed upon them, they
have enacted the first and most important of all laws necessary to
insure that not only their own hearts, but the hearts also of all
succeeding generations born in the nation, now called Victoria,
cannot fail in love and gratitude to the Creator of all good ; they
being now quite conscious that it is to this blessed end all these
gifts are being bestowed upon them ! Nothing, therefore, is
more certain that a perusal of the extensive knowledge, given in
the foregoing illustration of the cause of the necessity of improve-
ment in Education, would sway the emperors and kings of Europe
from their accursing pursuit of dominion, to that of improving by
an extensive use of the arts and sciences, the condition of their re-
spective subjects. Any thing that may appear doubtful in the
foregoing, shall be explained, and facts adduced by the author,
either at the Diggings, Geelong, or at Melbourne. So at once
then,
0 embrace now the true time, and by your wise Legislation,
Let Victoria the Queen and Victorians her nation.
Thus lay a corner stone for soon completing the creation,
And creating God?s love in the heart till time ends generation I
