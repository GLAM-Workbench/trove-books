THE DECLINE OF THE FISHERY,

INTRODUCTION.
It is not with any intention of interfering with, or dictating to, the
present owners of whaling ships, that I address to them, as well as other
Capitalists, the following observations; —the few remaining fully acknow-
ledge and deplore the continued decrease in the number of ships fitted,
and therefore cannot be otherwise than interested in the Statistical
details; even should they fail to secure acquiescence in the inferences
deduced, and co-operation in the plan suggested.
Many ascribe the decline of the trade entirely to the alteration of the
duty upon Foreign Oil, contending, that from that cause the British
owner is unable to secure an advantageous return for his capital; for-
getting, that before the question of reduction was contemplated, the
number of ships fitted annually had much decreased. As this is the
reputed cause and so strenuously set forth, it is the more important to
shew how the fishery will really be affected by it.
Now, it is evident that in order to supply the British market, and
secure the same profit as the English owner, the Foreigner must obtain
his Oil at just so much less cost, as the duty and charges imposed upon
its introduction amount to. According to an official paper on the Ame-
rican fishery, presented to Congress by Mr. Arnold, of Massachusets, it
appears, the duration of a Sperm voyage averages 3 years. That the
wages are about 30 'f- cent, upon the products of the cargo,—


That of the outfit,
33 cent, is pure American produce, viz,, provisions, agricultural
produce, and wood.
23 cent, on articles which America can produce, but of which some
portion generally comes from England.
20 per cent, of articles which come from abroad.
6 per cent, of articles obtained on the voyage, and
18 per cent, of manufactured articles required for the outfit. ”
So that it is certain the Americans do not make a voyage, upon the
average, in less time than ourselves—that they pay the same, or rather
a greater proportion for wages—that at least one half of their outfit costs
as much, if not more, than it would do in England ; and labor averag-
ing 30 per cent, more than in this country; they having to manufacture
their own produce must be unable to obtain the average of our last com-
pleted year’s fishing, at a saving of .£3,540, that being the amount of
duty and charges which would be incidental to the importation of the
same quantity of Foreign Oil, it being admitted that the cost upon im-
portation amounts to £2O per tun;
Or according to the general statement, the cost of obtaining a tun of
oil, averages about £6O, the Foreigner must consequently obtain his oil
at £4O per tun, before he can compete with us in our own market.
That this is not accomplished, may be proved by an extract from a
Price Current of American produce for March 1844, “ owing to the
advance in the U. S. holders of American Oil have withdrawn their
parcels for the present, asking £75.” It may be observed that the cost
of obtaining is much less than the sum above named, when the ships
are at all successful, the estimate refered to being 179 tuns in 37.49
months, whilst the average of 127 ships selected, was 237 tuns in 36.36
months, in that case giving a protection to the British owner of £4,740
per voyage.
That the speculator is most seriously injured by the change, there
cannot be a doubt, for it is impossible again to have those serious fluc-
tuations in the price, but this, a disadvantage to him, will doubtless
prove a benefit to the owner.


Hie decline of the trade being admitted, it is requisite to attempt an
explanation of the same, and although it is hereafter stated to arise
from the death of the original owners, it is still necessary to shew a
probable cause why those who remain have not increased their interests
in proportion; or why others have not been induced to enter into it;
and this may be done in a few words. It requires a more than ordinary
command of capital to make a certainty of success—and those who have
been engaged in it have found so little unity of purpose in the trade that
unless they can command a regular succession of officers, they find it
too much of a speculative investment, for although employing an exten-
sive capital they have not a sufficient number of ships to counteract the
effects of a few bad voyages; and the experience of this is, no doubt,
the cause why many have been wary in their operations. But there is
reasonable ground for affirming that capitalists in combination will sur-
mount every difficulty, and a company with a respectable directory offer
one of the most lucrative means of investment presented to public
notice.

ADDRESS
TO THE
OWNERS OF SHIPS ENGAGED IN THE SOUTH SEA FISHERY,
AND
CAPITALISTS GENERALLY.
At no period since the establishment of the Whale fishery has a more
favorable opportunity than the present presented itself for the formation
of a Company having for its object, the prosecution of the Whale fishery
in the Southern Seas.
The fishery has heretofore been carried on by private parties having
at command capital, which increased by success and employed with
experience, has raised the fishery to a high standing in British Com-
merce, but the death of many long established owners during the past
few years, and the now much to be lamented decease of the most exten-
sive in the trade, will, without some such Association as now proposed,
be the cause of the decline of that most profitable branch of English
industry. The present moment more particularly favors such a for-
mation, as the monetary distresses in the Australian Colonies has caused
the almost total annihilation of the Whaling Trade in that quarter of the
globe ; which at one time was carried on with a success, that bid fair
to supersede the London fishery, but from the want of greater com-
mand of capital than possessed, it has been f ound impossible to re-
tain. Thus, in the year 1835, Sydney alone had 45 ships engaged, and
by the latest dates received, March 1844, only 20, many of which must
be withdrawn upon their arrival. It is improbable cither there or in
England individuals will be found willing to embark so large a sum as
from £50,000 («$ .TGO,OOO for three years in an undertaking in which they


have not had any experience; and with a less amount it would be im-
prudent to enter upon it, the results of the last 15 years fully shewing,
that in proportion to the number of ships engaged in the same interest is
the advantage to the proprietor.
The South Sea fishery was first carried on out of London about the
year 1775, and encouraged by bounties from the government until
1821, from which time it has continued without further assistance. In
1823, Oil was first imported from the Australian Colonies. In 1836,
upon the introduction of the imperial measure, the total imports of
Sperm Oil exceeded 6,000 Tuns,
It is hardly necessary to state, the fishery when conducted with suffi-
cient capital and experience has proved a source of great profit; the ex-
tensive fortunes realised are too well known to need particularising. It is
only requisite to shew that as a whole, under all the disadvantages
arising from conflicting interests, and the material losses experienced by
many who have entered it, but not sufficiently extensive or without
experience, it has made a more than ordinary return for the capital em-
barked.
The succeeding statements comprise, without exception, every ship
sailed from London, intending to return direct, for the Sperm whale
fishery from the year 1825 to 1840; embracing a period of 15 years.
The quantity of oil delivered, is according to the Custom’s return.
The estimated price, the map.ket price at the time of arrival,
tub losses, the ship at the value of the same, deducting deterioration
in proportion to the time out, the oil, the value of the quantity on board
at time of loss, without deducting crews proportion.
The cost op voyage, viz., the deterioration of ship and stores, cost
of provisions, whaling stores &c., seamen’s wages, and charges incidental
to the voyage, and the value of the ship at sailing for estimating the
capital, is obtained from the average of a number of ships employed.
From which is compiled
A statement, as above; shewing the advantage of Non-Insurance.
A statement shewing the ships classed under their respective owners,
from which is selected the returns made to the two principals.


A statement shewing the quantity of oil brought by each ship en-
gaged during the period referred to, arranged according to their num-
ber of voyages.
Before proceeding to the consideration of these statements it will be
necessary to point out the disadvantage under which the fishery has
labored, and the advantages derivable from its amalgamation into a com-
pany.
Ic is well known to all conversant with the trade, that the greatest
difficulty to the owner in the outfit of a whaler, is the selection of the
master, officers, and crew, for to them is entrusted, without restraint, his
property for a period varying from to 4 years, the nature of the
voyage precluding that periodical investigation and control, exercised
in every other branch of maritime commerce; and, it but too frequently
occurs, that his interests are considered secondary to their own ; and the
master once dear of the land, is either seeking his own aggrandisement
by trading, to the neglect of the voyage, or by giving himself up to in-
temperance—disgusts and contaminates the crew. The officers, instead
of co-operating with a master anxious for a voyage, either from ineffi-
ciency for the duty, or from intemperate or quarrelsome habits, frustrate
his best intentions, and by creating dissensions in the cabin, destroy all
control over a crew composed of the most discordant materials, at all
times difficult to manage. To one or other of these causes can be as-
cribed the ill success of every ship returned without a fair cargo, and
unfortunately the loss of many.
It should be the primary object of the company, to use their utmost
exertions to counteract this important evil, and in time there can be
no doubt of complete success; in furtherance of this object, steady, ex-
perienced, and persevering men might be appointed as superintendents,
to control a certain number of ships. And a regular system of promo-
tion and remuneration should be established for the officers, and a pension
fund, by which the seamen will be provided for in old age or sickness,
and in case of death assistance rendered their families. By this it is ex-
pected to secure the assistance of meritorious officers and seamen.
The first part of the plan, if carried into effect, will place a certain


number of ships, say 5 to G, under the directions of a tried and intelli-
gent commander, who will direct their movements, and acting as their
commodore appoint their several fishing stations, arrange for their supply
of necessary refreshments, superintend their refitting, and control the
general arrangement of the officers, who will have rank and pay under
him in proportion to their ability. The principle advantage of this mode
of operation, is the experience of the party so employed, both as regards
fishing and the general management of whaling ships, the assistance of
all the ships on the station, in case of accident to any one of them ; where-
by the probability of loss from shipwreck will be materially lessened, as
even under extreme cases the oil and stores may be saved, and not as
in the majority of cases that have occurred, wholly lost to the owners.
In case of death of the master, the object of the voyage need not be
sacrificed, as some other officer maybe appointed in his room; and there
would always be a sufficiency of officers and well disposed men to
overrule any disposition to mutiny and insubordination in the crew. It
would also form at once the system of promotion desirable, and the office
of commodore with its emoluments, be looked forward to, as the reward,
which it would be, of merit and good conduct. The amount of remu-
neration might be in proportion to the rank bestowed, in the aggregate
not exceeding that now paid for the voyage, so that the carrying out
the plan shall not entail an extra charge upon the same.
The provision for the crew will be made by deducting from every
man in the ship the sum of Is. per month, which in the course of a few
years, will raise an annual revenue fully equal to the purposes required.
Although this may appear a tax upon the seamen, still the having his
slops at a moderate profit upon their cost, instead of paying at the
rate customarily charged, and other advantages he will derive, will
place him in a far better pecuniary position than he has ever yet en-
joyed.
The second and next important disadvantage under which the trade
has labored, and from which when conducted by the best men, the
voyage is made longer than formerly, arises not from the paucity of


whales, but the increased difficulty of obtaining them, for on account of
frequent pursuit, they have become, as it were, instinctively sensible of the
distance at which they are secure from attack, for to about 30 or 40 feet
there is no difficulty of approach. An instrument has however been in-
vented, and being as it is, approved and eagerly sort for by the most
experienced, successful, and practical men, there cannot be the slightest
doubt of its important advantage to the fishery, more especially as it is
found from the examination of the Log Books, and from the evidence of
the Captains, that the boats during the voyage, when in pursuit, almost
always obtain to the distance at which they see the apparatus will act
with effect; but not once out of twice, to within a distance sufficiently
near to obtain the whale by the ordinary way, consequently the same
amount of oil will, should their opinions be realised, be obtained in at
least one third less time. Thus in four voyages, taken indiscriminately,
the total number of times the boats chased whales was 410—number of
times they captured, 195—number of whales captured, 341. The pro-
duce of which, delivered in London, was 873 tuns of sperm oil. With
regard to the apparatus, the construction is so simple that an ordinary
mechanic can rectify any difficulty that may arise from the peculiar
nature and plan of its use.
The foregoing are the most important considerations, and from the
adoption of which the greatest benefits will accrue to an association ; there
are, however, other advantages which a company will derive ; for from
an uniformity in the construction of the vessel, and of the outfit, a more
advantageous and economical mode of fitting will be attained. The
command also of capital will enable a body to avail themselves of the
cheapest and best markets ; and from the quantity of stores required,
construct and manufacture the greater part to advantage.
A great amount of saving will also accrue from being their own in-
surers, not only from a less liability of loss, but upon a general and
admitted correct principal; the result of 15 years shewing a very im-
portant saving to the fishery, had the owners, during that period, united
themselves if only for the purposes of mutual assurance.
The alteration of the duty upon Foreign Oil, has been the cause of

some considerable uneasiness to the trade, but it is much to be doubted
if it does not prove the means of establishing the fishery upon a firmer
basis, the retained amount of duty being such as to prevent the intro-
duction of foreign oil, but, at a price sufficiently remunerating to the
British obtainer, and it must be borne in mind, that if the duty be
reduced upon oil, it is also reduced upon, or has caused the reduction
in price of almost every article required in the outfit of the ship, and
upon no one article, more particularly than that important one of pro-
visions, and the present cost of fitting, as compared with that of eight or
ten years back, will give an advantage of from 10 to 20 per cent, the
cost of provision being at least 25 per cent. less. The reduction will
also prevent the revival of that speculative monopoly, which by raising
the price, as it did a few years past, threw the article out of con-
sumption, and at the period refered to, did much injury to the Sperm
oil fishery, by causing the improvement in common oils, and in the
mode of burning them.
The following is the general statement of the fishery referred to—
shewing the number of ships sailed each year, from 1825 to 1839 inclu-
sive, the proportion arrived, and lost, and the quantity of oil delivered.

In the consideration of the foregoing it must be borne in mind that very
many of the ships charged as lost, would not have been so, but for the
wilful misconduct of the masters, and the great probability is that in a
measure this contingency will in future be much avoided. There are
also seven ships, charged as losses, condemned as unseaworthy, but
which cannot occur with the description of vessels proposed to be
built. A quantity of oil, charged as lost, was saved at the time of the
ship’s loss, and either shamefully abandoned, or from want of accredited
agents in or near the neighbourhood, lost to the owner.
A Statement shewing the Ships classed under their respective owners.


That the advantage is in proportion to the number of ships in one
interest, will be readily admitted upon consideration of the above. And
selecting the ships belonging to the two principal owners that have been
in the trade, it will be found that the average quantity per month ob-
tained by those ships was 5 tuns 175 gallons, the general fishery being
5 tuns 13 gallons, and that the surplus take of their ships over the
general fishery is 1,815 tuns 161 gallons, which at the average value of
the oil will give £835,791 : 12s. excess of profit.
The great increase in the return for capital is hereby so fully developed
that the most inexperienced, with regard to the fishery, must admit that
very many who have entered upon it have done so without the neces-
sary ability to carry it out, and the consequent advantage of any
defined system.
If the statement compiled of the ships arrived, classed according to
their tonnage, was here introduced it would be seen that ships of a mo-
derate tonnage are more applicable to the fishery than larger, as they
will bring a fair quantity, are fitted at less expense, and from their
draught of water better suited to the seas they frequent.
The last statement offered, is that shewing the quantity of oil brought
by each captain during the same 15 years, arranged with the ships’
names, and the time occupied, and according to the number of voy-
ages made; from which it is found that those who have commanded
one voyage average 3 tuns 241 gallons per month, their average amount
of loss having been 16-jVff P er cent. Of the ships thus commanded, 10
ships delivered under 100 tuns, averaging 65 tuns 78 gallons, obtained
in the proportion of 1 tun 215 gallons per month; 27 ships under
150 tuns, averaging 121 tuns 37 gallons, or 3 tuns 15 gallons per
month; 25 ships under 200 tuns, averaging 167 tuns 141 gallons, or
4 tuns 51 gallons per month; and 17 ships above 200 tuns, averaging
222 tuns, or 5 tuns 194 galls, per month.—Those who have commanded


two voyages, average 5 tuns 8 gallons per month, the average loss having
been 10 T per cent. Of the ships thus commanded, 6 delivered under
100 tuns, averaging 62 tuns 116 galls, or one tun 99 galls, per month.
15 under 150 tuns, averaging 130 tuns 204 galls., or 3 tuns 95 galls,
per month.—34 under 200 tuns, averaging 174 tuns 44 galls, or 4 tuns
178 galls, per month; and 45 above 200 tuns, averaging 241 tuns 100
galls., or 6 tuns 100 galls, per month.—Those who have commanded
three voyages, average 5 tuns 160 galls, per month, the average loss
having been per cent. Of the ships thus commanded 7 delivered
under 100 tuns, averaging 71 tuns 221 galls, or one tun 242 galls, per
month. —14 under 150 tuns, averaging 132 tuns 174 galls, or 3 tuns
127 galls, per month.—33 under 200 tuns, averaging 173 tuns 16 galls,
or 4 tuns 138 galls, per month. —36 above 200 tuns, averaging 237
tuns 41 galls., or 6 tuns 42 galls, per month. —Those who have com-
manded four, or more voyages, average 5 tuns 214 galls, per month, the
average loss having been 1 per cent. Of the ships thus commanded
one delivered under 100 tuns, viz. 47 tuns 5 gallons. one under
150 tuns, viz. 110 tuns 24 galls.—26 under 200 tuns, averaging 179
tuns 121 galls., or 4 tuns 236 galls, per month; and 29 above 200 tuns,
averaging 238 tuns 94 galls., or 6 tuns 131 galls, per month; thus
proving most incontestably, that inexperience materially increases the
probability of failure and loss of ship.
The foregoing statements have been prepared with the strictest regard
to their correctness, and the observations are the result of close and
careful consideration, (during the period referred to), of the facts that
have occurred in the fishery, the compiler having had from his constant
intercourse with owners, masters, officers, and crew, peculiar facilities
for acquiring information.
