Werrißee (§prge
THIS interesting feature is easily accessible
from the Metropolis, and if its attractions
were better known it would no doubt become
a popular resort.
Leaving Melbourne by the early train at 7.40
a.m., after a short journey of 32 miles, the tourist
reaches Bacchus Marsh at 9.2 a.m.
Visitors can ofifain Conveyances
to take them by Werribee Vale Road to the lower
end of the Gorge, a distance of about 3 miles, or
by another public road to the shelter shed near
the upper end of the Gorge. From these points
foot-tracks lead through the Gorge.
The Committee of Management has formed a
complete system of tracks, erected shelter places,
and provided finger-posts for the guidance of visitors,
who can thus secure an enjoyable day’s outing.
The shelter huts are available for picnic parties.
Visitors are urged to assist in preserving the
natural beauty of the Gorge and not to injure or in
any way interfere with the ferns and plant life.
The return train from Bacchus Marsh leaves at
9.8 p.m., reaching Melbourne at 10.24 p.m.

Thus the varied and interesting rocks were buried and
preserved from the wasting agents of nature. Streams
of rain waters, however, had to flow on, and, passing
from the lava plateau at a height of 1,400 feet to' the
Melburnian Basin beneath, they developed such power
that the rushing waters of the Werribee River wore
out this narrow cleft, shall we say, for present day
Victorians to admire.
“Not only did they carve out the grand scenery of
this romantic area, but they exposed to view the under-
lying rocks—rocks that have a wonderful story plainly
inscribed on them. For here it is that the rocks are
clearly proved to have been formed by the agency of
ice—ancient glaciers, ice rivers—whence they came we
know not. Here was a surprising discovery, that in a
country enjoying such a fine, warm climate as Victoria
now enjoys, there should have been extensive glaciers.
The evidence is so plain that he who runs may read.
The jumble of fine clay and stones of all sizes so unlike
water-deposited material, the stones worn into flat faces,
grooved and striated, and the old bed-rock scored and
polished as the glacier passed over it, can all be easily
recognised and interpreted.
“As this area has now been declared a National Park,
and tracks and paths have been constructed through it,
it will rapidly become a favourite resort of the student
and the tourist.”
