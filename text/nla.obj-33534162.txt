Enquiry into the Conduct of Sub-Commissioner Cooper on Kiandra.
HAWKINS Y. GOOPEE
MONDAY, JANUARY 6, 1862.
y appointed by Government to investigate the
isioner, Kiandra.)
(Before James Ilarrop Griffin, Esq., J.P., Chief Commissioner of the Southern Gold Fields ;
specially appo
Commissioner,
charges made against Frederick Augustus Cooper, J.P., Sub-Gold
? ? Cr , ' '
. Sir?l beg to transmit herewith copies of a series of
? barges which preferred against Mr. Sub-Commissioner
Copper of Kiandra, ut the investigation which was held into
his conduct in January last, by J. H. Griffin, Esq., Chief
1 Commissioner of the?Southern Gold Fields. To these I
have added the charged-pf Messrs. Newman and Wallace
which I have copiedJfrom*lhe public prints. Many other
charges of the gravo-t nature were brought before Mr.
Gridin by other parties, but as they have not been-pub-
lished, I am not in a position to state and only
allude to the fact to show that rav allegations are not the
solitary complaints of one isolated and discontented indivi-
dual, but that they are but a portion, and a portion only,
of the many accusations which have been made against Sir.
Cooper by several distinct parlies, most of wh >m were up
to the time of the investigation absolutely unknown to
each other.
I have applied to the government for a copy of Mr Grif-
fins report, and also for the evidence adduced at the
enquiry, hut my request has been positively refused com-
pliance with. No action his been taken by the Govern-
ment, and with ole exception every question has to this day
? l�een left undeeioed; from this continuous un certainty oh
?disputed points of mining law I am still subjected to endless
dispuies entailing unceasing litiga:ion, perpetual annoyance
And loss. Ten months ago I appl.ed to Chief Commissioner
Cloete, for a decisive settlement of 'hose vexed questions,
I th-*n addressed invseif to the Minister for Lands, but
only succeeded in obtaamu o licial acknowle Igements, curt
evasive, and amb.gumis. A.ur niucii procrastination an
enquiry was at length instituted, pa;lial in its (Operation,
one-sided and u..fair ; eon meted with closed doors every-
thing that transpired was guarded with th ? most jealous
secrecy. In the interval of live months delay, many of
my witnesses left, thus diminishing my opjxmunities of
proof. The limited powers with which Mr. Griffin was in-
vested rendered th.) of the truth a
task of no ordinary difficulty. No subpoenas could bo ob-
tained, which alone could have compelled the attendance
?of unwilling and frightened witnesses, and which alone
oould have rendered the investigation eith *r searching or
complete. Mr. Cooper took special care to inform the
witnesses whose evidence he knew would damage his case,
that if they chose to absent themselves there was no power
to enforce their atten lance ; by these means the difficulty
of obtaining the piools of the va?idity of many charges was
Mill further increased. The refusal to issue these sub-
pumas was a direct and positive assistance to Mr. Cooper;
he could command the, presence of his witnesses who had
nothing to fear, mine on the contrary were subjected to
open intimidation, and secret threats of his uncrunulous
partisans, with the avowed intention of defeating the ob-
jects of the enquiry, under these circumstances the timid
and the cautious could not be induced to appear, and I
was consequently driven to rely almost solely upon those
who had already publicly opposed or condemned his con-
duct. As an instance of the audacious maimer in which the
were ?4womtoned, I may state that one of tho-
Tcaders of the mob, at the door of the Court, almost in the
herring of Mr. Griffin himself, expressed his determination
of ?jumping my guts out,? his words being loudly ap-
plauded by numbers ofl.*s followers. This man has com-
mitted frequent assaults, and is no.v bound over to keep
the peace. If the evidence in support of any of my charges
should be considered weak, I answer that it was the want
of subpoenas alone which prevented the production of
proofs on every point, which would have been crushingly
conclusive. Ido not complain of Mr. Griffin, I willingly
admit that his conduct was characterised by the strictest
impartiality, but at the same time, I cannot but conceive
that the instructions by which he was governed were mani-
festly unfair towards me. They practically afforded Mr.
Cooper every facility for stilling inquiry and preventing
the appearance of dangerous witnesses, whilst they effec-
tually deprive I me of all external sunport, and divested my
witnesses of the shield which compulsary attendance would
afford them, to expose them to the brutal outrages of an
exasperated mub,whc had sworn at all hazards to exculpate
their protector. Yet in spite of those obstacles, in the
teeth of a determined and organised opposition, I still
succeeded in maintaining the truth of my charges. To the
evidence obtained under all these disadvantages, I ta x
triumphantly point in confirmation of my assertion. If
Mr. Gosper is guiltless in those matters in justice to him
let the evidence be produced, let him be exonerated from
even the suspicion of ill doing?secrecy and silence will
never be accepted as proofs of innocence. If he is
guilty, thou I maintain that justice to myself, and to the
minors generally, demands that this evidence should be
forthcoming.
That 1 have been willfully, deliberately, and systemati-
cally wronged, I need neither depositions nor report to
whole of these disputos-originated in-
the refusal of Mr. Cooper to comply with a request which
?he was htndul to accede to, vi/.., to compel the holders of
confiieting.rights to measure their water by the legal guage
enjoined by the government; for reasons best known to him-
self, he steadfastly and obstinately declined to enforce this
regulation. Nearly the whole of my .os<es are traceable to
this one cause. This ftict was so obvious, the justice of my
request so undeniable, that Mr. Griffin without even wait-
ing to report to the government, immediately ordered Mr.
CooiKjr to see that this very regulation should be henceforth
literally adhered to. After five mouths deprivation of my
officially guaranteed right, uhich upon this point alone in-
volved a loss ot upwards of �*)00, I obtained from Mr -Grif-
fin the immediate recognition of the all important claim
which Mr. Cooper had so long and so pertinaciously with-
held. The regulations, No. xix, runs thus ??Such water
ghrt*l be measured by a plank sluice head, having a sec-
tional area, of twelve inches by one, with a fall of one in
twenty-four.? It / e vr was complied with & the cons ?qm n c
was, that lifter the expenditure of mv capital, I was robbe I
an I Jefrauded of the very source of my income. This com-
plaint is embodied in charire No. 11. Case C.
I will now ptss on to another point, which was admittel
at the investigation, and state the case as it occurre I in all
its miked lolly end injustice. Mr. Cooper had sent me a
written order directing me to turn out my water to supply
apa tv whose race hea led fib irr me; for them to have ob-
tained it, it must hive run up hilt , in spite of the palpa?Vo
fibsnr litv, the manifest injustice of this order, he still < om-
pellel me to surrender it upon the monstrous plea tha ! lae
sunplv of this party was dell lent. Shiunoek, one of the
men, for whose suppose I benefit this onler-w is given, him-
self a knitted in evidence, th �t he was aware nt the time
that l.e never could receive it, that he nevertheless still in-
sist *d upon my obeying the order. Let his depositions be
pro luce Innl my assertion will bo substantiated. This was
in the month of August, the depth of winter. In conse-
quence of the abstraction of the water, the fi ost penetrated
the embankments, seriously injuring them in some places
and utterly destroying them in others. Similar embank-
ments in the same places Ixdongiug to other races
were preserved from Injury by the running water. In
addition to this, four miles of the race were completely
blocked up, an I obliterated by drifting snow, a result which
in other rises was likewise prevented by running water.
Whilst the snow continued the d im ige was irreparable.
An additional loss of upwards of �2OO was entailed from the
operation of this senseless and arbitrary order. This com-
plaint is contained in charge VI and ease E.
Having now patiently waited for nearly twelve month'*,
having unsuccessfully attempted every available means of re-
dress, knowing the uselessness of appealing to the Courts of
Law against a i officer armc 1 with an undefined irrespon-
sible authority, and protected by sweeping discretionary
powers, mv property having been wantonly injured, my
admitted rights forcibly withheld, half ruined by the vin-
dictive persecutions of a Government official, who has ha-
bitually prostituted the judicial powers with which he has
.been cutiuste I for the disgraceful gratification fit hiapriya�L
malice, having sustained losses and damages to the extent
of �BOO solely attributable to his flagrant violations of duty,
perceiving no other hope of redress, I have as a list resort,
determined upon appealing tol?arliament for that reparation
and restitution which it would be vain to seek fur elsewhere.
I would rosoectfully urge you to lend me your assistance
and support in my endeavours to obtain the u'holo of the
correspondence relating to the complaints against Mr.
Cooper, together with the depositions of the witnesses and
the report of Mr. Oriffiu upon the late enquiry. If those
papers are once printed I will engage that an exposure of a
scries of th * most incredible malpractices will bo the in-
evitable result. If the charges are unfounded their pub-
lication cannot possibly injure the character of an innocent
individual, whilst every attempt to withhold them will
assuredly be com trued into an admission of their truth.
If from a perusal of these statements it should appear that
I have been wronged, if a subsequent perusal of the depo-
sitions taken at the enquiry should strengthen the convic-
tion, if it can be shown that the Government neglected for
five long months to take any measures to relieve me from
that wrong, though frequently urged to action both by the
member for the Southern Gold Fields and myself; if it can
be shown that Mr. Griffin himself admitted the wrong, and
took immediate measures to prevent its recurrence upon the
guage question, the question upon which all these mining
dispnt *s hinged, if it can be shown that oven now, after
the lapse often months that every other question has been
[ left undecided, thus perpetuating a never failing source of
loss, litigation, and ill-will. If these statements can be
shown to bo unanswerable, then 1 confidently appeal to the
justice of Parliament to grant me compensation for losses
which have been unjustly inflicted by an irresponsible indi-
vidual arbitrarily wielding the delegated" authority of the
Oovernment-fcf-the'wnntry. *- ?'?*??- ? - -
I have the honor to remain your obedient servant,
SAMUEL HAWKINS,
Kiandra, May ?, 1862.
The following arc the charges which were prepared by G
B. Barton, Esq., Barrister-.it-I iw, who conducted the case
on the part of Sir. Hawkins.
I, Samuel Hawkins, for 9 years a miner on the Australian
Gol I Fields, ami for the last 16 mouths a resident of
Kiandra, having lorwarded to the Government various
charges against the alxu?e-mentioaed F. A. Cooper, and
having at length an opportunity atfordel mo of publicly
confirming them, do hereby make the following specific
charges against him ;
I.- No Permit or Transfer.
I charge Mr. C icpcr with having in direct violation of the
provisions of the Gold Fields Regulations, allowed a miner
to hold a Water Privilege, without a Permit for the same,
or any Transfer of a Permit, and to use such water to the
detriment and injury of other miners legally entitled to the
same.
lI.? No OfAOE.
I charge Mr. Cooper, with hiving, in .direct violation of
the provisions aforesaid, neglected ami refused to direct
certain min rs p isses-diu Priority of Right, and com-
plaining of shortness of water, to measure their supply by
a Gaa;e wlnm called upon to do so by the holders of con-
flicting rights and allowing to pass for a legal and proper
Gauge that which was no Gauge at all.
111. ? Fink for Order not Co mmun i c at Ed.
I oh irge Mr. Cooper with having inflicted on myself and
my partners a fine, lor not having obeyid an alleged order
made by him, although such order had never been com-
muniea?c.l to us.
IV.?One Assessor a Partner of Plaintiff.
I charge Mr. Cooper with having carried into efiVt a
decision made by two assessors, although it was made
known to him that one of such assessors was a partner of
the plaintiff.
V.? Order Reversed.
I charge Mr. Cooper with having carried into execution
an order made by him, notwithstanding such order had
been received by his superior officer, Mr. Commissioner
S,?ott, and such reversal had been duly notified to him.
VI.? Order Impossible.
I charge Mr.Cooper with having made an order vexatious
absurd, and impossible to be carried out, to wit, that I and
my partners should turn the water out at the head of our
race in order to let it flo w into the head of another race, to
do which would require us to reverse the natural flow of
water in a creek?all explanation on our part being super-
ciliously rejected.
Vll.?Refusing Adjournment.
I charge Mr. Cooper with having refused to grant an ad-
journment of a trial in which I and my partners were defen-
dants, in order to obtain necessary and indispensable wit-
nesses, notwithstanding the expressed desire of one of the
assessors that such adjournment should be granted.
VIII.? Courts in Public Houses.
I charge Mr. Cooper with having habitually heard and
decided oases in public-houses without auj* reason or
necessity lor so doing ; with having kept no record of cases
decided, orders made, or damages awarded ; and when the
said public house was the daily resort of the members of a
notorious mob, who unrestrainedly intimidated the peace-
ful portion of the community.
IX.? Assaults and Purjukv.
I charge Mr. Cooper with having refused mo protection
when I was in personal danger and requested such protec-
tion ; with having sanctioned and allowed, if not instigated,
a succession of brutal assaults to be made upon me by a
ruffianly mob, two of which assaults took place in the bar
room of a public house to which he had summoned me ;
and with having directed the police to get out of the way,
as the mob were about to attack me. 1 declare that Mr.
Cooper in ills evidence on the recent hearing of a certain
indictment filed by him against one Dixon, of Cooma, for
libel, was guilty of corrupt and wilful perjury.
X. -?-Vexatious Summons.
I charge Mr Cooper with having vexatiously summoned
me to appear before him on unfounded charges, knowing
at the time that I was no way interested or concerned iu
such charges.


XL? PREJUDICED ASSESSORS.
I charge Mr. Cooper with having, in mining cases in
which I was concerned, selected assessors whom he knew
were bitterly prejudiced against mo.
XII.? CONFERINO WITH ASSESSORS.
I charge Mr. Cooper with having habitually conferred
with the assessors during the deliberation of their verdict.
Xlll.? Police.
I charge Mr. Cooper with having neither maintained,
nor endeavoured to maintain, any check or control over his
}>olioe ; with sanctioning and allowing, and frequently in-
stigating, the commission by them of grossly illegal acts :
to wit, of arresting and dragging to the lock-up without
warrant and on unfounded charges ; of breaking into pri-
vate houses on frivolous pretexts, and of allowing mur-
derous assaults to be committed in the open street, in broad
daylight, without the slightest interference on their part.
And I declare that the police instead of being a source of
protection to the peaceable and well disposed, arc a source
of terror ami of dread ; and that they are, notoriously, the
aiders and abettors of a lawless mob, whoso hitherto unin-
terrupted career of brutality has been the disgrace and
ruin of Kiandra.
XIV.? Irish Mob.
I charge Mr. Cooper with having, during his sole ad-
ministration of the Kiandra Geld Fields, habitually aided
and abetted a mob of lawless ruffians, commonly known as
the ? Irish Mob,? who have long been notorious in Kiandra
for their wanton violation of the law, and incessant breaches
of the peace ; who have openly avowed themselves the par-
tisans and defenders of Mr. Cooper; who have not only'
threatened to assault, but have actually assaulted, persons
who presumed to question the legality of Mr. Cooper?s
proceedings; who have been guilty of almost daily assaults;
who have never been interfered with in their unlawful acts
hy the police, or brough - up for trial before Mr. Cooper.
And I swear that these men, knowing that they have the
sanction of Mr. Cooper and the police, exercise great inti-
midation over peaceable and respectable miners and others ;
that life itself is scarcely safe among them, and that a
revolver has become a necessary part of daily attire. In
short,that law' has been laid aside,and mobbish has reigned
triumphant.
XV. ?Kvivkd hy Decisions and Vindictiveness.
Finally, I charge Mr. Cooper with having, by' a series of
illegal and unjust decisions in cases involving mining law,
deprived myself and my partners of the benefit of 10 months
incessant labor in the construction of a race which en-
titled an expenditure of little less than �2OOO, and which
was completed in the face of great natural difficulties, by
refusing to allow' us to hold and enjoy the water to which
we were by law' entitled, and by granting such water to
others, whereby' we have been brought to the verge of
absolute ruin. And I accuse Mr. Cooper of having been
actuated in his conduct towards me by a spirit of malice
and vindictiveness unworthy of a gentleman and disgraceful
to a Magistrate.
The foregoing charges, so fir as they'relate to questions
of mining law, originate in, and are proved by, the
following cases:
A.
Yates and Tauuert v. Maxwell. Assessors ; Speck
* and Votno.
291h July, 1831.?Complaint was male to Mr. Cooper
nv two miners name I Votes and Taggert that their supplv
of water was insufficient, and calling upon us to supply' the
deficiency. The complainants ha Ino guage. Mr. Cooper
having summoned two assessors, decided that we should
turn out inches of water at the head of our race. Wo
complied.
1L
Yates and Taookrt v. Maxwell. Assessors; Burrows
and Moriautv.
31-t July.?Complaint was again made to Mr. Cooper by
the same parties that their supply of water was still insuf-
ficient. They alleged that although their permits specified
merely two sluice-heads, they had, in their application for a
permit, asked for 2 ground sluice-heads. The complain-
ants hal no guage. Mr. Cooper, having selected two
assessors, decided that two sluice-heads meant two ground-
and ordered us to turn out all the water at
the head of our race. We complied.
Hawkins y. Speck.
Ist August.?l informed Mr. Cooper that a miner named
Speck was using water to our prejudice, without holding any'
permit for the use of water, or any transfer of a permit. I
requested Mr. Cooper to call upon the said Speck to prove
his right to the use of water, and in the event of his doing
.so, to place the regular guage at the head of his race, as
directed by the regulations. Speck was present at the
Camp when I made tnose demands, and he thereupon ad-
mitted that he had neither permit nor transfer; but
pleaded that he was formerly* a partner of certain miners
who cut the race, and who hold permits, but who never
transferred them to Speck. These men had abandoned the
race for several weeks. Mr. Coojkt decided that Speck
Kiiould continue to use the water as before, and without em-
ploying a guage.
D.
Yates and Taookrt v. Hawkins and Maxwell. Asses-
sors : Shinnock and Mouiauty.
2nd August.?Camplaint was again made to Mr. Cooper
by the said Yates and Taggert that their supply of water
was still insufficient, and again calling upon us to supply
the deficiency. They* alleged that we were using water
flowing from certain springs intercepted by our race, about
a mile from its head, which was available for their purposes.
Mr. Cooper having selected two assessors, .awarded damages
against us to the amount of �B, or 7 days imprisonment.
This was lor being in possession ot a flow of water miserably
insignificant in itself, which we wore never ordered to re-
sign. Previous to the expiration of the seven days we dis-
covered that one of the assessors, named Shinnock, was a
partner of the complainant Yates, and gave immediate
notice of the fact to Mr. Cooper. In addition to this a
telegram was received by one of our friends from Mr. Com-
missioner Scott, in reply* to one forwarded to him ques-
tioning Mr. Cooper?s decision that two sluice-hcads meant
two ground~sluicc~heads, which stated that ?unless
specially marked ground ?, all sluice permits are for one box-
head only*.? This was also communicated to Mr. Cooper;
but in defiance of both facts, Mr. Cooper declined iu any
way to alter the verdict.
Shinnock v. Hawkins and Maxwell. No Assessors.
Gth August.?Complaint was made to Mr. Cooper by* a
minor named Shinnock that his supply of water was insuf-
ficient, and calling upon us to supply the deficiency. We
complied, bia against the order on the ground of .point to be considered. I submit that for Miners to com-
