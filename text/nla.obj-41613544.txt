Publisher’s Note
A question will naturally arise; Who is “The
Red Bard”? From the technical finish, sustained
quality and local idiom of “Battle-song of
Change” it will be evident that the work is that
of a front-rank Australian poet, and it is a
commentary on the period in which we live, and
the repressive influences which operate, that such
a writer should need the protection of a pseu-
donym.
The call of this poem is a clear continuance
of that which Henry Lawson uttered in 1887
when, in Sydney “Bulletin”, he wrote:
Sons of the South, awake, arise!
Sons of the South, and do.
Banish from under your bonnie skies
Those old-world errors and wrongs and lies,
Making a hell in a paradise
That belongs to your sons and you.
The author announces that “Battle-song of
Change”, or any part of it, may be publicly
reprinted, lead, recited, recorded or broadcast
oy radio, without fee, provided it is not so
used lor personal or business profit.

BATTLE-SONG OF CHANGE
1.
On tho mountain-top the Temple
Plashes, poised against the skies,
Crowned with domes of gold that dazzle,
Seat and symbol of our Wise,
Our Almighty Lord and Master
God of Private Enterprise!
Hark the High-priest of the Temple
Like a prophet-voice of old :
“Every man may climb the height
And dwell beneath those domes of gold,
If he will but worship, always.
One sole God. our Great, All-wise,
God of Private Enterprise!
2
But another sound insistent
Murmurs, like a bronzen gong
Faint and far but growing strong,
Like a buoyant-hearted throng,
Like a multitude still distant,
Singing as they march along,
With a challenge in their song:
“Men are rotting in your service,
God of Private Enterprise I
For the stream <jf life is poisoned
By the virus of your lies.


“And a cancer-sore of discord,
Sorrow, crime, and social woes,
Monstrous wrong and trivial evil,
From your greedy purpose grows.”
3.
Yet the voice booms from the Temple
In that droning tone of old:
“Every man may climb the height
And dwell beneath those domes-of gold. . .”
4.
Climb the height! When all the slope
Is terraced by the trampled dead,
Trampled by the feet of frenzy
In the crowded climb ahead.
Multitudes upon a mountain,
Writhing, all with each as foe,
Like a pyramid of maggots
Churned obscenely from below.
Struggling all to' reach the Temple
Dazzling-bright against the skies,
Throne of that Almighty Master,
, God of Private Enterprise!
Multitudes upon a mountain.
Massed upon the slopes that bleed,
Dupes of that Almighty Monster,
God of High Finance and Greed!
Potgut God of Private Profit!
God whose wine of life is Lies!
God of Pestilence and Hunger!
God of Murder in disguise!
God of Crime and Wars and Treason!
God of Private Enterprise!


5.
And the Temple is but guilded
Holding high those domes of gold,
Dazzling domes of metal balanced
On a frame that cannot hold.
For the Temple walls and columns,
Beams and buttresses and frills,
Are but bank-notes pulped and pounded,
Ten-bob notes and dollar bills.
And that papier-mache mansion.
Domed by gold, must soon or late
Lurch and shudder, sag and crumple.
Crushed beneath its overweight.
And beneath the golden menace
Of the central Temple-dome,
That Almighty Lord and Master,
Great God Pot-gut. has his home.
6.
What a God' And what a Temple!
What a Throne! And what a Creed!
What a Maggot-mound of Horror!
What a Monument of Greed!
7.
Yet the High-priest of the Temple
Still intones that tale of old:
‘Every man may climb the height
And dwell beneath those domes of gold.”
8.
Men are rotting in your service,
God of Private Enterprise!
For the stream of life is poisoned
By the virus of your lies.


And a cancer-sore of discord,
Sorrow, crime, and social woes,
Monstrous wrong and trivial evil
From ,your greedy purpose grows.
At a secret memo pencilled
By your secret counsellors,
Millionaires will steer an empire
On from trade-typhoons to wars,
Or as lightly pinch a penny
From the wages of a boy
Or a girl of their employ.
In your naihe a miser shuffles,
Counting coin with wheezy breath.
Or some quisling snarls and wheezes
As he dooms a town to death.
All for you some pork-fat butcher
Adds a zack or two to sales
By the way he rigs the scales.
All for you the fascist-butcher
Rigs his gear in torture-jails.
Where the starving toilers totter
Through the stagger-dance of death,
Hunger jazzes with diseases,
Children gasp for bread or breath,
While your priesthood tries to tel! them
That your rule is good and just.
Pot-gut God of Money Lust!
In the back lanes of the city
When the stealth of night begins,
Women, victims of your looting,
Loot in turn the garbage-tins.
In your name a titled wowser
Rooks the denizens of drums.
Lordly landlords reap their rentals
From the moaning miles of slums.


9.
Yet the High-priest of the Temple
Still is drooling as of old:
“Every man, may climb the height
And dwell beneath those domes of gold. .
10.
But that other sound comes clearer,
Vibrant like a bronzen gong,
Like a mighty-throated throng
Singing, many million strong,
Marching, singing, marching ’nearer,
And the Regiments of Wrong
Sense the challenge in that song;
“Men are rotting in your service,
God of Private Enterprise!
For the stream of life is poisoned
By the virus of your lies.”
Decent souls are doped, degraded,
Warped, and veered to ways of stealth,.
By the frenzied fight for profit
In the cut-throat war for wealth.
In your name, in halls of commerce,
Rogueries go slinking round.
Everywhere, illegal purpose
Creeps within the legal bound. •
News-rags boast of truth and freedom.
Yet, at call of private trade,
Twist the truth and strangle fact
And rig the news in masquerade.
And, to madden more this whirl
Of doubts and lies and hates and threats,
Falsehood bellows .every minute
From the throats of radio-sets.


11.
Yet the High-priest of the Temple-
Hopes that men may be cajoled:
■‘Every man may climb the height
And dwell beneath those domes of gold. .
12.
Men are rotting in your service,
God of Private Enterprise!
For the stream of life is poisoned
By the virus of your lies.
Those who most have robbed and cheated,
Scabbed, and crawled, and smirked, and lied,
In your Temple most are lauded,
Laurelled, pampered, sanctified.
Round your throne such rogues of finance
Find a floodlit place to pose
As the robber Rockefeller.
He, who paved an age with woes,
Perches there, a pet archangel,
Saint of high-financial skies,
Pedestailed on piled-up dollars,
Prince of Theft in sacred guise.
In the same seraphic waxworks
Pierpont Morgan, Henry Ford,
All the crafty kings of cartels,
Cackling in a loud accord,
Praise your ways as good and wise,
God of Private Enterprise!
Praise your deeds and hail you lord.
Such a crook as John McArthur,
He who reared his wealth on rum,
Wears a full merino mantle
In your golden Kingdom-come.
And his fellow rum-rogue, Wentworth,
Brawls and shouts that there should be
Convict slaves and coolie labor
For enrichment of his free
Bunyip aristocracy.


Hothani won your crown of glory,
Made your pulses race and rise,
God of Private Enterprise!
When he woke the goldfield sabbath
With a cold-blood rat-tat-tat,
And his gunmen murdered diggers
On the hill at Ballarat.
Bums, who launched a shipping-line
On human bodies black and brown,
Boasts about kanaka-slaves
And wears a sugar-coated crown,
Where your golden • domes look down.
Weaver, he whoso rifles murdered
Norman Brown at Rothbury,
Scatters words as wild as bullets
In your gilt eternity,
Pot-gut God of Tyranny!
Kidman, king of cattle-duffers,
At your altar proudly stands,
In a broad-brimmed halo dreaming
Of new ways to fake the brands.
13.
These and others, in the togs
They label as Democracy,
These the Wardens, of your Temple,
God of Enterprise called Free!
These, Defenders of your Faith!
The lauded heroes of your song!
These your Captains, Mighty Master
Of the Regiments of Wrong!
These your Saints and Seraphim!
The Barrackers that boost your creed,
God of Business! God of Pillage!
God of Death and Evil Deed!


14.
Yet the High-priest of your Temple
Still is mumbling as of old:
“Every man may climb the height
And dwell beneath those domes of gold. . .”
15.
But that other sound comes clearer,
Vibrant like a bronzen gong,
Like a vast united throng
Singing as they march along,
Singing, marching, marching nearer.
And the Regiftienls of Wrong
Feel the challenge of that song.
16.
Men have rotted in your service,
God of Private Enterprise!
For the stream of life is poisoned
By your creed of greed and lies.
At your Pot-gut call for Profit,
Heedless of the call of Man,
Dalfram holds were gorged witlj iron,
Guns and bayonets for Japan . . .
(For the slaughter of our boys
Who sprawl in death in tropic mud,
While, within an armchair sprawling,
Pot-gut drinks their health, in blood.)
At your will, to win you profit,
Skeletons must crawl and sprawl,
Maybe round a Belsen dungeon,
Or where famished millions fall
In the back lanes of Bombay
Or in the gutters of Bemgal.


At your will, death-freighted bombers
Roar and soar and dive and wheel,
Ripping flesh from helpless owners
Of the land that you would steal,
Or the land that you have stolen,
With your guns or with your lies,
God of Private Enterprise!
17.
When a gale of truth arises
And reveals your naked creed,
Servants hurry with disguises
For your desperated need.
Witness Hitler, Hirohito,
Mussolini, Chamberlain,
Chang-kai-chek and Winston Churchill,
And that Franco-cur of Spain
Each in some new-fashioned clobber,
Selling some new-fangled scheme.
All in fascistry conspiring
To maintain your rule supreme,
Massacring and maiming millions,
Wading deep in bloody deed,
Toppling nations, rending empires,
All to serve your profit-creed,
God of High Finance and Slaughter!
God of Wars, and God of Greed!
Pot-gut God of Fraud and Intrigue!
Cut-throat God of Graft and Lies!
God of Treacheries and Treason!
God of Private Enterprise!
18.
At your will, Great God of Profit!
When Peace called for songs and cheers,
Bevin, pomping in Westminster,
Kissed the toes of tory peers,
Murdered Grecian hopes and brimmed
The Javanese canals with tears.


And this Bevin, banging tables,
Boasting Britons must be free,
Drove the riven ranks of Labor
Down to dollar-drudgery.
19.
At your will, Groat God of Profit!
Though your days are in decline,
Wings of Wall Street eagles darken
All the world. The dollar-sign
Looms, a newer Nazi-symbol,
Just as dread and more malign.
At your will, Great God of Profit!
Dollar millionaires now strut,
Monsters masculine yet pregnant,
Big with greed that swells their gut.
Bloated spiders of the board-room,
Weaving their financial mesh,
Tangling human flies in war-webs
Shattered bones and screaming flesh.
At your will the Wall Street bankers
Poise their bombs above the world,
While they boast the ways of life
Beneath the Stars and Stripes unfurled
Stars men see when bashed with batons,
Stripes from whips of Ku Klux Klan!
Stars and Stripes, a flag degraded,
Dish-rag of the Marshall Plan,
Wet with blood of good men murdered
On the route of march of Man.
20.
At your will. Great God of Profit!
God of Enterprise called Free!
Politicians don the boots
And bowyangs of democracy,
Hoping still to make the workers
Hitch the belt and bend the knee.


Hoping still to save a system
Geared to this inhuman end:
Every life must yield a bonus,
Every death a dividend.
21.
And the Voice booms from the Temple
Now with anger uncontrolled:
“Every man may climb the height
And dwell beneath those domes of gold. . .”
22.
But still clearer and yet clearer,
Sounds that vast united throng,
More than many million strong,
Singing as they march along,
Singing, marching, marching nearer.
And the Regiments of Wrong
Stand in terror of that song.
No regime is everlasting.
Hark that new call, clear and strange,
Like the voices of the people
In the battle-song of change.
23.
And the High-priest of the Temple
Chokes a scream and starts to scold:
“Every man may climb the height
And dwell beneath those domes of gold.
There is room. You have been told.”


30.
For the challenge of those marchers
Is the Battle-song of Change.
No regime is everlasting,
And the new call, clear and strange,
Wins the people with its logic,
And the workers take the lead.
Private Enterprise collapses,
And a world awakens, freed
From the maggotries of Greed.
All the rusted chains of Finance
Break. The slaves are breaking free.
And a thousand million people
Greet the new life now to be.
And a thousand million people
Move like strong tides of the sea.
For that sound so terrorising
To the Regiments of Wrong,
Is the forward-moving throng
Of the Workers, proud and strong
Workers of All Lands United
Singing as they surge along,
And with Triumph in their song.
31.
No regime is everlasting.
Hark! The new call, strong and strange,
Of the Voices of the People
In the Battle-song of Change.
