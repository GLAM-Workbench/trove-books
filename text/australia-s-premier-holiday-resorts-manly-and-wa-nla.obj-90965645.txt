How To Reach Manly
THERE are numerous ways of reaching Manly—
the Playground of Australia, situated seven
miles from the City of Sydney. Many visitors
prefer the steamer trip, for which one of the finest
ferry services in the world caters.
Steamers leave No. 3 Jetty, Circular Quay, at
regular intervals, and the journey to Manly affords
passengers a wonderful opportunity to see, at close
quarters, the countless delights of Sydney Harbour.
Fares are: Adults sixpence (6d), children one
penny (Id) —children under five years free.
Season and weekly tickets are available at re
duced rates.
BY TRAM,
An alternative route can be taken by tram from
Wynyard Station (entrance George, Hunter or York
Streets, Sydney) to The Spit, crossing the Sydney
Harbour Bridge, and traversing North Sydney,
Neutral Bay, and Mosman to The Spit Bridge. Pas-
sengers have to change trams at The Spit. On this
route many glorious views of the Harbour and
Middle Harbour are obtained.
The tram trip from The Spit to Manly occupies
only 20 minutes, and passes through the increasing-
ly popular suburb of Balgowlah.
BY MOTOR ’BUS.
An up-to-date fleet of motor omnibuses plies
between St. Leonards and Manly at half-hourly in-
tervals. The ’buses are of the observation type,
affording passengers maximum opportunities of en-
joying the exquisite views. The ’bus route deviates
somewhat from that traversed by the trams.
by road.
An excellent road from the City to Manly is
available to the visiting motorist, and after crossing
the Sydney Harbour Bridge a choice of routes may
be taken. Finger posts at the various intersections
show the respective routes. A popular drive is that
to Roseville—a pretty North Shore suburb—along
the Pacific Highway to Boundary Street, thence to
Roseville Bridge, along French’s Forest Road, to
Beacon Hill, and Governor Phillip Look Out.
> to Koseville —a pretty North bhore suburb along
. the Pacific Highway to Boundary Street, thence to
y Roseville Bridge, along French’s Forest Road, to
Beacon Hill, and Governor Phillip Look Out.
t From the Look Out, a magnificent panorama of
Manly, Sydney Harbour, and the Pacific Coast, for
a distance of 20 miles, is obtained.
at Newly formed roads lead from Beacon Hill to
’ j Manly, a distance of three miles, or to Palm Beach,
lose I 7 miles north.

Manly —By the Sea
ON 23rd January, 1 788, the Governor of Aus-
tralia, Captain Arthur Phillip, R.N., made his
first landing in Port Jackson. After entering
Sydney Heads, he travelled North to a small cove,
and so impressed was he with the friendliness and
MANLY bearing of the natives, he named it Manly
Cove.
The Municipality of Manly was incorporated on
6th January, 1877, and as this brochure is publish-
ed, suitable arrangements are being made to cele-
brate Manly’s Diamond Jubilee.
The progress of Manly was retarded for a num-
ber of years, owing in no small measure to the lack
of transport facilities from the city of Sydney, but
there has, during recent years, been developed the
most official and up-to-date steamer passenger ser-
vice in the Southern Hemisphere, if not in the
world.
In addition there is an excellent 'bus service
from North Sydney to Manly, and from Manly to
the residential districts of Warringah Shire—trans-
port is fully covered in earlier pages.
There is no end to Manly’s charm and interest
for the holiday maker and tourist, and the climate
itself conspires to crown the district as the most
temperate place in Australia throughout the year.
Winter Climate
There is no off-season in this delightful resort,
with its beauties of ocean and harbour scenery, un-
surpassed in any part of the world. The winter
climate is so mild that it is no less popular in win-
ter than in summer, in fact, a very large number of
visitors acclaim the winter months as most ideal for
the perfect holiday.
DE LUXE CABS


Winter Climate —Continued
The mean temperature during May, June, July,
and August is 60.9°, and it is interesting to compare
the winter temperature of other famous tourist re-
sorts with Manly:—Santa Barbara, Cal., 52.50°;
Algiers, Algeria, 52.50°; Cannes, South France,
50.85°; Mentone, South France, 51.50°; Black-
pool, England (6 summer months), 56.30°.
From the days when Municipal Councils and
the Police discontinued the practice of rigidly en-
forcing the regulation which provided that sea-bath-
ing must cease at 7 a.m. until after sun-down.
Manly has always been recognised as the premier
holiday resort in Australia, and a paradise for lov-
ers of surfing and bathing.
The main ocean beach is noted for its excellent
surf and safe bathing, the clean golden sands being
washed and purified with every tide. A magnifi-
cent stretch of Norfolk Island Pines line the spa-
cious promenade, and provide shelter on the hot-
test summer day to surfers and picnickers. Dressing
pavilions are provided at both the Southern (South
Steyne) and Northern (North Steyne) end of the
beach, which is over a mile in length.
Sydney’s largest and most modern Hot Salt
Water Baths will be found at the South Steyne end
of the Ocean Beach Front, where expert treatment
is always available. These Medicinal Sea Baths
are becoming more popular each year, and are
highly recommended by the Medical Profession.
Marine Parade, with delightful and colourful
rockeries leads the visitor to Fairy Bower Beach and
Rock Swimming Pool. Shelley Beach and Blue
Fish Point, from which latter points a glorious
panoramic view of the Pacific Ocean may be had.
The rugged grandeur of the cliffs is itself and attrac-
tion, and in rough weather, when heavy seas are
pounding the coast, many tourists make the pleas-
ant walk to witness a memorable sight.

The visitor to Manly will naturally desire to
see Middle Harbour and The Spit. Middle Harbour
is one of those delightful places which gratify the
individual taste of every Nature lover (see the view
on inside back cover). The surpassing loveliness of
its scenery delights innumerable tourists, boating,
sailing, and yachting enthusiasts are attracted by the
scenic grandeur of its many picturesque coves,
whilst devotees of the open-air life find many ideal
spots for camping and picnics along its shores.

For SCENIC
Sports and
At The Spit Bridge there are several boatsheds
where rowing boats, launches, and yachts may be
hired for the day, week, or month.
From Manly, Middle Harbour and The Spit
Bridge are approached by good tram and ’bus ser-
vices. Around The Spit and The Bluff along Battle
Boulevarde and Seaforth Crescent, a new circular
motor drive known as the Seaforth Scenic Drive
has been constructed. From the various vantage
points along this road can be seen Pearl Bay, Long
Bay, and panoramic views of Middle Harbour for
several miles, with glimpses of North and South
Heads in the distance. There are many glorious
walks to delight the hiker and seeker of natural
bush scenery.
Manly is world famous for the sporting pro-
clivities of its citizens. Australian champions are

cult to find a holiday resort anywhere in Australia
where there is better provision for every kind of
sport—golf, tennis, cricket, football, bowls, deep-
sea and rock hshing, rifle shooting, yachting, boat-
ing, speed-boat racing, and surfo-planing. There
are saddle ponies for children and two riding
schools for adults. Manly and Warringah presents
to the golfing enthusiast no less than 1 0 golf cours-

high grade standard. The Manly, Dee Why, and
Long Reef courses are full 1 8 holes, while those at
Balgowlah, District Park, Elanora, Mona Vale,

provide delightful picnic surroundings.

Glorious Warringah is a most fitting phrase
for this superbly beautiful district. There is
no shire in Australia which offers such an extra-
ordinary diversity of attractions. Its hinter-
land presents a variety of scenery, combining
the grandeur of the Scottish Lochs with the
softer aspects of well wooded green hills,
picturesque lake scenes and beautiful shady
walks. On the ocean side and the shores of
Pittwater, there are sixteen beaches to choose
from. The Warringah Shire possesses many
gems of scenery, the principal being Pittwater.
Space only allows a brief mention of the at-
tractiveness of the places worthy of a visit and
situated in Glorious Warringah. Each, however,
can be made the centre of a delightful holiday from
which to explore the other beaches, the beautiful
ocean vistas from the various headlands, the
wooded hills and the broad expanse of delightful

Avalon Beach.
Scenic Beauty of Pittwater.
The Open Road
The Narrabeen Lakes, situated but seven miles
from Manly, is another gem of scenic wonderment.
Here is to be found, as well as a long expanse of
snow white surf beach, a secluded and calm lake
area that will delight the heart of the artists. Cov-
ering a huge area, and of varying depths, boating,
sailing, and ( flshing provide happy recreation, as
well as safe and pleasant bathing. The Hills that
surround these Lakes are beautiful and rugged, and
provide ideal walks and hikes for the more athleti-
cally inclined. Narrabeen township is quite con-
siderable in size, and this spot marks the terminus
of the tram from Manly.
Pretty beaches, each with its own characteristics
and advantages, are dotted right along this strip of
coast line, and possess happy and pleasing sound-
ing names. Harbord, with its sheltered beach,
village township, McKillop Park reserve and camp-
ing area. Curl Curl, the more majestically ocean
type of resort, providing excellent bathing and sand
sport. Dee Why is more protected, and is a well-
settled township, having a direct bus service from
the Manly Wharf. The Black Swan Lagoon at
Dee Why gives a new touch of solitude to this de-
servedly popular place.
Collaroy and South Narrabeen are well known
holiday spots, only six miles from Manly, and be-
coming more populated each season.
Great lawns, motor camps, and a well con-
structed cliff roadway are further delightful advan-
tages for the tourist and motorist.
Pittwater is one of the main reaches of Broken
Bay, and embraces a very large expanse of water,
some seven miles long in the main arm, but the
actual water frontage enclosed is about thirty miles.
At Mona Vale, either of two good roads lead
to various parts of Pittwater. Taking the road bear-
ing to the left you come to Bayview and Church
Point. In the distance, guarding the entrance to
Broken Bay, is Mount Elliott Island, more com-
monly known as Lion Island, then slightly to the
left we see Scotland Island, covering about fifty
acres. The road to the right at Mona Vale leads
to Palm Beach. Along this road views of Coast-
er’s retreat and The Basin, well-known to yachts-
men as a good and safe anchorage, are obtained.

® Hiking
* for Health
Many Australians indulge in the health-giving
recreation of hiking or bush-walking and Manly and
Warringah districts abound in scenic walks, many
remaining as unspoiled as when Governor Phillip
made his overland trek from Manly to Pittwater.
The district has its waterfalls, cascades, caves,
fern and palm glades, grotesque rock formations,
clear crystal bushland pools, wild flowers and birds,
in addition to its magnificent beaches.
There are numerous delightful walks in the
area enclosed by Sydney and Middle Harbours on
the south; the Pacific coast on the east; Barrenjoey
on the north, and French’s Forest and Pittwater on
the west.
Every class of walk imaginable is within reach
of the walker or hiker in this area, including foot-
tracks, minor and main roads, creek-gully walks,
beach walks, headland climbing and harbour fore-
shore walks, and in each the hiker’s interest is main-
tained.
Warringah Shire is known as the playground
of New South Wales, and by virtue of its sparsely
populated areas is attractive to the hiker.
The numerous beaches referred to in this pub-
lication, the capacious rock baths, popular with
women and children, Pittwater Bay with its many
inlets, suitable for boating, swimming and fishing.
Narrabeen Lake and delightful reaches, all offer to
the hiker the ideal opportunity of getting away
from the cares of everyday life to a vast and beau-
tiful area.
