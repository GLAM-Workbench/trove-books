INTROD UCTION.
At the Exhibition Jubilee
Where golden treasures are on view.
Pure complex minerals there you?ll see
And Peacock ores of varied hue.
fo my dear friends and the indulgent reader, not with-
out misgivings I venture to launch a boat laden with
hopeful aspirations on the seething waves of public
estimation and opinion by the aid of those priceless
gems, ideas my obtuse mind has been incubating,
and at last succeeded in hatching a poetic egg "as
the result of meditative inspiration, which the writer pre-
sents to the public gaze in its original cracked condition
? The mixture to flavour, if hard to digest,
With herbs and salt season according to taste?
Cast and fashioned in the same mould by a similar propa-
gating process, the writer?s genius (or something at least
analogous called rhyming) has given birth to ?? an hode ? and
other doubtful delicacies ready to dish up spiced and pickled
to suit the epicurian taste if encouraged by the success of
this.
The incidents narrated in the ensuing pages refer to the
early diggings and customs of the diggers in the good old
times. As an eye-witness to and actor in some of the stirr-
ing events that took place, I?ve described with accuracy
what actually occurred, I have of course freely used the
license and privileges granted to descriptive verse in this
respect. The writer?s fancy has taken flight and soared like
a "bird on the wing" to a high elevation, but in these days
of discovery and invention, within the range of future possi-
bility. ? Those days of golden glory ? have passed away
when a votary of the god of wealth?poor one week might be
rich the next. The Jubilee Exhibition now on view at famed
old Bendigo, presents a striking illustration of the mineral
resources and industrial progress made since then.
I will conclude this tiresome prelude by saying the writer's
object will be gained and his vanity gratified if the artistic
reader will kindly gather and entwine ? by fancy formed ?
what the writer has tried in vain to supply or weave, viz,, an
armful of fresh native blossoms to form a garland or floral
wreath to cover the blemishes and embellish the following
descriptive verses dedicated to the golden era.


To Victoria?s sunny shores in feverish days of old
From every clime there came eager searchers after gold.
Sea-captains left their vessels to founder ?neath the waves,
And doctors and lawyers came, excited by the craze.
Sailors went and made a pile in gully banks and creek,
Left their ships without a hand to sail them on the deep.
A great rush to Bendigo and Ballarat set in;
No duffer blanks were seen, so all a prize must win.
The bank of wealthy Croesus was found and rushed en masse,
Who planted for his offspring pure nuggets in the grass.
The baby seed sprang up a hundred-fold of gain,
And grew a crop so rich ?twas christened the golden grain.
Its infant birth required a mother?s fostering love
To introduce the cradle, the washdish, and the tub ;
The puddler-trough and sluice-box at length came in demand
To save the gold that ploughed and sowed the fertile land,
Whose bounteous pastures broad and fleecy wealth combined
To store the golden grain?rich treasures always kind.
Commerce and trade sped on as if a fiery comet
Set diggers hopes ablaze with burning cinders from it.
By the boring-rod and surface signs of basalt rock,
Deep leads were sought and found, traced from the golden
crop;
And where the tangled scrub grew matted from the
Groves abound, and orchards bring forth the ripened fruit,
And budding flowers did soon their perfumed tithes bring in,
And every garden bloomed with floral gifts to Spring;
The whistling jackass warbled melodious in the bush,
And blythe the magpies sang in chorus with the thrush;
Harsh was the parrots? screech, like cockatoos in fright,
Of vocal music jealous, put harmony to flight;
The curlew?s mournful cry portentous warning gave.
That sounded like the wail of a lost soul from the grave.
The radiance of the beaming sun
Eclipsed has been and overcast,
When highest glory he has won,
With clouded head will wane at last.
So in the zenith of our fame
A riot?s blighting shadow came,
Opposing unjust greed of gain,
And rights of diggers to maintain.
Not a single digger faltered,
Though the fortieth came from town,
Whose duty was, when quartered,
To fight and crush rebellion down.
But the diggers had by practice,
And some military tactics,
Marshalled their forces right away,
Resolved to die or win the day.


Submit to wrong and right forsake!
Stockade Eureka made reply;
Eureka was the diggers? cry,
While freedom?s banner floating high
With scorn injustice did defy?
For life and honour were at stake.
One pound a year the men laid down ;
The monthly fee was two pounds ten.
The diggers must, to pay the tax,
Sell shirt and coat from off their backs,
Go hunting with the naked blacks,
And live on possum roasted brown.
Hostilities at last began,
The bugle note defiance rang,
And fast the bullets flew.
The conflict raged, and rifles blazed
In deadly work and true;
And ere had set the glowing sun,
The diggers had a victory won?
Besieged with courage, boldly fought,
Repulsing foemen?s stern assault,
To storm the stockade well.
Whose cause was just, so stand it must,
Though all beseigers fall;
And Peter Lawler in the van
Secured the rights for every man.
The monumental Soldier?s Hill
To contract signed bears witness still,
That saw it sealed and bound.
One pound to reap each year, and keep
The golden crop when found ;
And pay good men to legislate,
And pilot safe the ship of State.
From rocks and breakers far away,
To anchor in the haven bay
And harbour of good hope;
And good laws frame, our rights maintain
With hearts of native oak.
To guard our shores and overthrow
The power of any foreign foe.
By fruitful seeds of wisdom sown
Victoria won the country's heart,
And helping all her sons at home
Best free instruction to impart;
Like some famed monarch on his throne
The Act of Education rules,


Its dower a sceptre and a crown
Acquired by knowledge in the schools..
No feeble words its power can stamp,
Stupendous monument sublime
Erected by the hand divine
To blazon on the scroll of time,
And mark the epoch newly born,
Uniting progress with reform
That dwarfs Aladdin?s magic lamp.
On squatting bent like kangaroos
The lawyers jumped gold lands in use.
And Legislative Members paid
Helped sterling men before unknown,
Whose able councils wisely made
The squatters? tyrant rule break down.
And doctors? land bills poison packed
Tried hard to drug the goldfields act.
The land acts liberal made did lay
Progressive works for poor to say ,
Protection prospered far and wide,
And kept our commerce in its place.
Made industries colonial thrive ;
Secure within his strong embrace
The six States should, supplies to bag.
Between them hoist the freetrade flag.
As time with measured pace strode on,
And good alluvial nearly gone,
A network zone of rich quartz reefs
At Bendigo was found.
And diggers rushed again in heaps
To peg and lease the ground ;
Like flathead new chums came in shoals.
And corner agents made big hauls.
As capital the place had stormed
Quartzopolis at once? was formed,
And hustlers* monster cakes so bright
Of pure retorted gold ;
And duffer scrip that turned out right
Like sellers had been sold
United quartz veins reefs will feed,
Like food the hungry man in need.
Our skill by practice has been taught.
And by severe experience bought,
And Lansell?s enterprise has won
Our best esteem to seek,
And prove a belt of golden stone
Five hundred fathoms deep.


The Chilian mills and rollers plan
Were soon knocked out of time
By Cornish buddies and berdan
That saved sludge gold so fine;
Then stampers? music rich awoke,
Improved reduction works,
No skill of scientific growth
Excels the synate course.
We spring to reach the ripened fruit,
But throw away the stone ;
So when there?s no gold in the shoot
?Tis like a well picked bone.
We learn that gold shoots large and small
In paying reefs abound,
And no gold seen at hanging wall
Near foot wall may be found.
This rule in level, drive or winze
I?ve always found correct,
And fortune?s wheel will often hinge
Upon a small prospect.
The gold conductors from below
Those indicators sure
Like whales must come on top to blow
The foul air off for pure.
Another giant stride we took
For Federation?s stand,
And tempting was the bait to hook
So prime a whale on land ;
The vagaries of the public mind
Reproaches often bring,
To patient merit are so blind,
They leave a venomed sting.
The standard of its excellence
Is like our modern swells,
Who always pay due reverence
When one does like themselves.
My little barque is tossed upon
The stormy ocean?s trough,
And laden rich with treasure from
The tranquil shores of hope.
In port once more I?ll steer away
To Viccy?s shore with care;
?Tis fifty years ago, they say,
Since gold was first found there.
These simple lines I dedicate,
In feeble words and tame,


And hope they will commemorate
The first marked golden claim.
The claims so rich in wealth untold
Seemed like a blessing sent to crown ;
Prospectors toil to win the gold
That built and laid out Melbourne Town.
My hand has sown and ploughed the field.
And harrowed all the rubbly soil,
In hopes the crop will pleasure yield
A recompense for cheering toil.
The kind indulgence I implore
Of all my worthy critic friends,
And hope they will not judge before
They know my own forbearance ends.
I leave it to their able minds
And always better judgment keen
To rub the mica oft these lines
No digger finding gold has seen.
When on white flat at Ballarat,
At Smythe?s and Brown's and Budjeon?s flat,
Though yet a boy but twelve years old,
I daily got half ounce of gold.
At bagatelle and skittles then
Boys spent their gold as free as men ;
The blue shirts with the red shirts fought,
And wrestled o?er the gold they sought ;
Claim pegs and coats went flying round,
When someone jumped disputed ground,
And by the single combat rule,
?Twas settled like they did at school,
And then a digger stabbed or shot,
Sometimes was killed upon the spot:
But soon Judge Lynch with rope in hand,
For murderer?s life made stern demand,
And o?er a limb by breezes blown,
With lasso skill tne rope was thrown,
And when police came on the scene,
The criminal had rescued been,
The witness bribed and jury pack'd,
Soon justified the felon?s act.
Behold the path that leads to wealth,
Trod by the prospector for gold.
The hardships borne and loss of health,
And perils of the track untold.
Observe his zeal by duty led,
Disclosing hidden treasures vast,


And go the way God marked to tread,
For man to find his gifts at last.
If he had but a start in life,
He might a wealthy man yet be
With station stocked and faithful wife.
Beside love?s pledge upon his knee.
Like gold refined cast in cement,
Hope was by fire burnt in his brain?
With good impulses nobly blent,
When he should strike the golden vein.
But fever?s scourge and deadly hand
Had seized him ere the goal was won ;
His blighted hopes and prospects grand
With him were buried in the tomb.
But nature?s laws must be obeyed
By men of noble mind and slave
Who grasp the golden prize that made
And dug the bold prospector's grave.
And great reformers in the van
Of progress and of science deep,
Have not with honour rose to fame
Till in the tomb's last silent sleep.
What fascinating charms belong
To all exciting gold pursuit
Its power speaks every foreign tongue,
Its key turns locks of guarded fruit.
'Tis sacred to the debauchee,
And king?s bow down before its rule,
Bond slave to Satan?s perfidy.
And humane laws will ridicule.
The raiser?s bauble he adores,
And virtue oft becomes its slave ;
It tempts all classes to our shores
In hopes a fortune soon to save.
But pillar?d might and fountain pure
To help the poor, and homes provide.
The orphan?s food and clothes secure.
And weeping widows aid and guide.
Asserting right, denouncing wrong,
And saving lambs from vulture?s claws,
To help the weak against the strong,
Tyrannic despots? brutal laws.


And courage to at once resist
Oppression?s cruel, grasping hand,
And bold heart always to insist
That just laws govern all the land.
My memory roused will fondly wake
The trust that first to love gave birth,
And taught our dear ones how to make
Our home an Eden bower on earth ;
And when we made our youthful choice,
And watched her steps that lightly falls
Like thistle down on ivied walls,
And joyful bade our hearts rejoice.

And how exciting to behold
When cash and hope were nearly gone,
A prospect of an ounce of gold
From gutter rich we bottomed on,
A five score ounces patch we got,
Then broke the pledge and paid the store.
And in that break made two score more,
Like Roberts would upon the spot.
And in what nervous haste we went
To bundle up our swags, as well
Our footsteps to the new rush bent,
That must be felt by one to tell.
And he whose heart within him sank ?
A duffer was without a soul
As shallow as a two-foot hole,
And shiser on a mullock bank.
The magic spell of beauty?s power,
Will captivate like Cupid?s dart.
The same as gold at any hour,
Will charm the true prospector?s heart.
I?ve often done without my food,
To work a patch out half the night,
Yet like a fish I longed to bite,
But would not while the wash held good.
Those sportive days were full of glee,
So was Lake Burrumbeet with game,
And Corangamite that ebbs to sea,
With duck and black swan was the same,
And monster turkeys on the plains,
Whose shyness made them cute and smart,
Only approached with horse and cart,
By wary sportsmen taking pains.
The fossickers on plunder bent,
To wash out tubs and cradles scrape,


Must watch the digger to his tent,
Whose mate watched him to stop escape.
So if he must a thrashing bear,
He tried revenge on long-tailed John,
Who with bamboo attacked him there,
And tailing heap disputed long.
Tipped on the nose, if John should see
One drop of blood had left a mark,
He trotted to the nearest tree,
And filled his nostrils up with bark.
At Carnham rush I much regret,
Two other boys, and I the third,
Resolved one stormy night and wet,
To wreck John's camp when off his guard,
The day before he came in force,
With bamboo?s armed prepared to fight,
Annexed our heading heaps and quartz,
And by a rush put us to fight.
Each missile now much like a bomb,
Would storm the fortress of the foe,
Each broadside would avenge a wrong,
All fossickers endure below.
My hand had fired a parting shot,
While trembling in my nervous fear,
When backward pulled upon the spot
My throat was cut from ear to ear.
The digger?s heard my startled shout,
And promptly to my rescue came,
And promised John to burn him out,
If he molested boys again.
A finger-nail or pen-knife could
Inflict a cut so long and keen?
If force had not been used it would
A painful scratch alone have been.
I?m much inclined to think it was
A practised thumb-nail skilful used?
It took six weeks to heal, because
The cut with poison was infused.
The Chinese camp at Carnham flat
(When John audacious had become)
Was burned down like at Ararat,
That rich field found by him alone.
Sensations of delight will thrill,
The joyous heart and nerves of man,


When aerial locomotion will,
Transport electric cars by tram
?Twill not be long before its power,
Will heathen nation's overthrow,
From then will date the wondrous hour.
When flying foemen chase the foe.
O?er billows of the bounding waves,
And verdant beauties of the land,
In rapt delight we?ll feast our gaze,
Admiring scenes amazing grand.
The eagle from his lofty home,
With sable plume and blazing eye,
Will gaze in wonder from his throne,
At envious rival?s flight so high.
With life-destroying bombs well armed.
For war as well as trade and sport,
The airships could not be becalmed,
Nor should they be in ambush caught,
They could secure and out of reach,
Demand surrender of the town,
Or else at once compliance teach,
By dropping fiery bombshells down,
An aerial destroyer then,
Some genius must invent to chase,
Air monsters in the shape of men,
Whose wants must be supplied in space,
Safe from the cyclone?s raging might,
High up from falling limbs and trees,
We?ll anchor safely all the night.
Above the howling wind and seas.
And guided by the morning star,
Will steer away for beauty?s isle,
O?er take a bird?s eye view afar,
And plume our gaudy wings in style
Then man the flying vulture will
Prey on his kind for love of greed ;
And never will he rest until
The glutton on himself will feed.
Go ! ask the Yarra factories
The secret of their trade and size ;
They?ll tell you golden batteries
Have crushed to build up enterprise.
Huge firms in Bourke and Little Bourke
Were on a gold foundation built;


?Twas gold helped navvies do the work,
To make the lines and dredge the silt,
And monumental public works
Whose solid masonry will stand
When justice has wiped out the turks,
Whose tyrant rule defiles the land.
?Twas golden soil from which was formed
Victoria?s parks, and perfumed flowers,
To beauties art the skill belonged
Of ornamenting festive bowers.
The floral taste of marigold
Has charmed the exhibition ground ;
And goldfish in the ponds behold,
By any sportsman can be found.
Zoo wonders, of the Royal Park,
And museum?s treasures golden bound,
Our libraries famous works of art,
Have proved our progress to be sound.
With golden stone our streets were paved,
To break a yard cast one pound ten,
And bricks twelve pounds a thousand made
The houses built expensive then.
Our railways and our sewerage scheme
And human institutions grand,
Arise like pyramids that seem
To crown the triumphs of the land.
These lines require the painting pot
And colours bright to suit the taste,
But I can only daub the spot
With muddy patches made of paste.
What ornamental tints I?ve shown
Of variegated shade and hue,
An artist sticking bills in town
Could whitewash paint a better view.
The rippling wavelets of the lake
With rainbow beauty gilded o?er,
Whose borrowed tints from sunbeams break
In crimsoned bubbles on the shore.
Within its azure bosom lies
Reflected like a mirror true
The wonders of the spangled skies,
A brilliant panoramic view.


The tiny crystal dewdrop?s fall
Awakes the bud to hail the sun,
Whose life-diffusing warmth for all
Will beam until his course is run.
I knew two diggers went away
Whose act excited madness showed,
And left a hole they knew would pay
At least ten ounces to the load.
Two mates left this at Forest Creek,
Whose mates had struck the juggler rich,
And shouted, Sell that duffer cheap,
We?ve washed twelve ounces in a dish.
Like fish some people, hard to please,
Leave small sweet bait they could have took,
To nibble on and large one seize.
But cried out when they felt the hook.
At Eaglehawk on Bendigo,
Directed by good luck or fate,
And where a rich reef made a blow,
One man got fifty-six pounds weight.
The water courses from the reef
Joined in a crab hole down the hill,
And there the gold all in a heap
With dirt a bucket half did fill.
Good dogs were often bought and sold,
The bull and mastiff was the breed;
And stickers up, by drink made bold,
Were pinioned ere they?d done the deed.
The drink sold then promoted crime,
And daily suicides took place.
The thieving done in contract time
Would brand some honest man?s disgrace.
A paltry thief caught in the act
Fast to a tree was tied all night,
And in the morning soundly whacked,
And told to clear the place outright.
The digger's license must be shown
If trap demanded without fail,
And if by chance 'twas left at home
He was handcuffed and lodged in jail
Sometimes the trap a digger chased
Like startled wombat to his hole,
But going down his coat disgraced
As LB. 4 in sludge did roll.


The goods were paid when coin seemed dead
With pure gold from the chamois bag,
And if a copper showed its head
It was cast out like dirty slag.
And later on there came in force
Tin tags marked 4-pence 1.0. U.,
That seldom were redeemed of course,
But broke or lost, the storemen knew.
The freight from town to Bendigo
Was eight score pounds for ton of stores,
The tide of good luck went to show
When fortune reigns it always pours.
And in the Bay of Biscay bogged
Some teamsters were delayed for weeks,
Their bullocks lost, of horses robbed,
The liquor broached must soothe their griefs.
Then revel glee salutes the air,
Cracked fiddle wakes the dancers? mirth;
The bones and tambourine declare
No happier men could live on earth.
Some drays and waggons found a grave
In marshy traps upon the plain,
Both wheels were sank down to the nave
And had to be dug out again.
I?ve seen them toss at Ararat
For drinks all round for many rounds,
The beer as muddy as the flat,
For which the loser paid five pounds.
The barman counted seventy men,
His fancy added thirty more,
The ? shout ? was regulated then
By payment of the one before.
Some barmaids kept a chamois bag
To bank the diggers? gifts of gold,
But found out like prophetic Wragge
That storm-clouds under lucre rolled.
And when the washing up was done,
Four mates might share ten pounds of gold
A drinking spree was started on,
Till every pennyweight was sold.
Till devils came, their minds were bent
To swipe like sailors come ashore ;
They longed to have the dollars spent,
For sooner they would look for more.


Good water then was hard to get,
For washing prospects used it up;
The rain supply, though not so wet,
Must serve our wants and wash our stuff.
A duffer sank just thirty feet,
Supplied the needs of many round ;
And though the water tasted sweet,
It was the best that could be found.
A pair of stands with windlass on
Done duty for the public good.
To which a rope and bucke slung.
Was left a fixture where it stood.
The glowing sun, so blazing hot,
A longing glance shot down ihe well,
And, beaming thanks upon the spot,
He only left a drop to tell.
One lowered his mate to bail it up,
Who in a fright let go the pail,
For floating in the muddy stuff
He saw a Chinky?s long pig-tail.
John?s mates said, ? Him go long before,
Him muchee leper, welly old,?
But many diggers loudly swore
They threw him down to get his gold.
The shanties did a roaring trade,
And brandy was in great demand,
For lots of diggers were afraid
Of leprosy?s revolting brand.
When sinking duffers, oft we would
Be made hard up and sick at heart;
Then old ground workings gave us food
And bade the phantom want depart.
Our tucker meant all wants supplied,
That often cost four pounds a week ;
And sinking prospect holes beside
To find lost lead or new one seek.
Both root and stump John worked the ground,
And paddocked golden gullies out,
If not good patches would be found
By hard-up diggers round about.
In depth John paddocked thirty feet,
And picked two feet of bottom up,
And thus the work, done so complete,
Left not a colour in the stuff.
The Happy Valley gulleys gave
Employment to a Chinese town,


And one pound weight of gold did save
From each machine they puddled down.
Two diggers bound to Berlin Rush
Had ta?en a parting glass in town
With one they knew ?a Doctor Bush,
Who said, ? I?m half inclined to join;
X might a large bonanza get,
And three can sink a paddock down,
So let us have another wet,
Just say the word and I?ll make one.?
? Agreed,? the diggers both replied.
But hard work is not easy wrought,
Said he that cannot be denied ;
But change of toil is only sport.
If you can but enjoy your meals,
And soundly rest in slumber wrapt.
Then nature?s laws prime vigour yields,
And work is exercise in fact.
They bought a claim in Cato?s ground,
And in cement the doctor toiled ;
His tender skin the sun had browned,
And blisters large his hands had spoiled.
? Dear boys, oh come with me,? he cried,
? And let us spell by yonder tree ;
Its spreading boughs and shade beside
Will cool us and refreshing be.?
? Cheer up ! cheer up !? his mates replied ;
? We?ll bottom ere the sun goes down ;
You know its only exercise?
At least, you told us so in town.?
? Dear boys, I must confess I did,
But had not quite expressed my mind;
I meant light exercise instead,
But this is of a violent kind.?
Two Frenchmen of patrician birth
From France La Belle on nuggets bent
And eager in the search tor wealth,
Delayed in town till cash was spent.
They represented pills and law;
With tender hands as white as snow,
They never had done work before,
But forced by hunger had to go.
They started on a heap of stone
At three and thirty bob a yard ;
Blood-blistered hands, sweat teaming down.
They toiled like navvies extra hard.


Upon his knees the doctor sank
And held his painful hands aloft;
The lawyer laughed upon the bank
And ganger-like his comrade scoffed.
?Mon Dieu ! Mon Dieu !?? the doctor cried?
11 What have I done to come to this ??
? You?ve killed some one,? his mate replied,
? Or else betrayed some trusting miss.?
? Too true ! too true 1? the other said,
? I have deceived a girl in town,
And promised marriage to the maid !
Mon Dieu ! I should be hunted down.?
Three-inch stone mason work paid well,
The diggings had no charms for them,
They steered a course back to Moselle,
Lots wiser if not happier men.
In sombre evening?s twilight grey,
Outside their tents the diggers would,
To caution loafers, blaze away ?
The only warning understood ??
With blunderbuss and derringers,
Carbines as well, and rifles too,
And those destructive messengers,
Famed pepper-boxes deadly true.
When gold-like plums in pudding shone,
And dogs to paddocks fast were chained,
The diggers robbed their mates therefrom.
When outside rogues were often blamed.
Deep in the paddock buried down
A patch of twenty ounces would
Be bagged as sure as Cockney Brown
Would bag the game shot in the wood.
A scheme to poison dogs was planned,
Who would not be by strangers bribed,
But took meat from the traitor hand
Of one for whom they would have died.
A digger left his dog and went
Out drinking on the spree,
The mastiff chained beside the tent
A faithful watch kept he ;
For a week the butcher daily
Had left the daily meat,
Underneath the tent securely
And near the guardian?s feet.
Oh, what reward can e?er repay
Such faith and noble trust ?
The digger found, to his dismay,
The meat had not been touched !
FINALE.
