AS SUPPLIED TO THE ROYAL TABLE.
CAPTAIN PIDDING?S HOQUA?S MIXTURE,
of FORTY HARE BLACK TEAS, produced on as many dif-
ferent plantations, each Tea differingfrom live rest, and.possessing a
flavour, a fragrance, or strength, peculiar to itself. Blended toge
ther in the proper proportions, they comprise all that is desirable in
Tea. bis discovery was not the effect of chance, but of many great
advantages united in one individual, and the result of numerous
experiments and the most minute analysis- For another to produce
the same result, he must possess equal skill, the same discriminat-
ing taste, equal power o r procuring the 10 various Teas required,
and know the exact proportions of each kind used?and though he
may never once have visited China, he must have had equal oppor
tunities of securing to himself, its productions ; with one who, like
Captain Bidding, has spent years there in acquiring theseadvantages,
and to whom alone Howqua?years before his death?impaited at
Canton, the secret of compounding his Mixture.
Yet there are upwards of 500 retailers pretending to sell Tea, they
call, ? Hoqua?s Mixture??each mixture differing from all the
others. Now as there can be but one beal ? Howqua?s Mixture,?
it follows that, as 600 different medleys are offered ?499 must bespu
rions. The 499 counterfeits are so many evidences of the superiority
of the one genuine. And it would be absurd to suppose that Capl.
Bidding, with advantages, the result of eightvoyages made to China,
and 5 years spent in that country, would be so silly?even were it
possible?as to yield them up to 500 others, or impart to them so
valuable a secret.
The very great celebrity this Tea has acquired, having tempted
many unprincipled persons to give similar, or nearly similar titles
to their own spurious mixtures, to guard against such impositions
purchasersshould observethat ? The Signaturethus?
Hon.Company?s Service,ison every Genuine Package.
To those who drink Green Tea, ? Capt, Bidding?s Howqua?s
Small Leaf Gunpowder, grown only on one estate, is recommended
for its strength and economy, and as being the purest and most
wholesome Green Tea imported from China.
Captain Bidding has appointed the under Agentsfor District ?

CURE OF RHEUMATISM AND RHEUMATIC GOUT.
Extract of a Letter from Mr. Thomas Brunton, Landlord of the
Waterloo Tavern, Coatham, Yorkshire, late of the Life Guards,
dated 28th September, 1848.
To Professor Holloway.
SIR ?For a long time I was a Martyr to Rheumatism
and Rheumatic Gout, and for ten weeks previous to using your
medicines, I was so bad as not to be able to walk. I hud tried
doctoring and medicines of every kind, but all to no avail, indeed
daily got worse, and felt that 1 must shortly die. From seeing your
remedies advertised in the paper I take in, I thought I would give
them a trial. I did so. I rubbed the Ointment in as directed, and
kept cabbage leaves to the parts thickly spi-ead with it, and took the
Pills night and morning. In three weeks I was enabled to walk
about for an hour or two in the day with a stick, and in seven weeks
I could go any where without one. I am now, by the blessing of
God and your medicines, quite well, and have been attending to my
business for more than seven months, without any symptoms of the
return of my old complaint.
For your information I had the honor to serve my country for
twenty-live years in the first regiment of Life Guards, and was
eighteen years a Corporal. I was two years in the Peninsular War,
and was at the Battle of Waterloo. I was discharged with a pension
on the 2nd Sept., 1833. The Commanding Officer at the time, was
Colonel Lygon, who is now a General. I belonged to the troop of
Captain the Honorable Henry Baring.

CURE OFABADLEG OF TWEN PY ONE YEARS? STANDING.

To Professor Holloway.
Sir?With pleasure and gratitude I have to inform you that after
suffering for twonty-oneyears with a bad leg, which yielded to no kind
of treatment, although I consulted, at different times, every medical
man ot eminence in this part of the country, but ail to no purpose.
I was frequently unable to work; and the pain and agony I often
endured no one can tell. My leg is now as sound as ever it was in
my life by means of your Pills and Ointment, which I purchased
from Mr. I. Davidson, Druggist, Berwick-upon-Tweed, who knows
my case well, and will, lam sure, be happy to certify with me, if
necessary, as to the truth of this wonderful cure.

AMPUTATION OF TWO TOES PREVENTED.
Extract of a letter from Mr. Oliver Smith Jenkins, dated
Falkirk, August 13th, 1848.
To Professor Holloway.
Sir?l was superintending about six months ago, the erection of
one of our Railway Bridges, an 1 by the fall of a large stone my right
foot was seriously bruised, which ultimately got so bad, that I was
advised to go to Edinburgh to consult some of the eminent Surgeons,
which I did, and was told that in order to save my foot, two of my
toes must be taken off. In despair, I returned home to impart the
melancholy news to my wife, Intending to submit to the operation, it
was then a thought struck me to try your valuable Ointment and
Pills, which I did, and was by their means in three weeks enabled to
resume my usual occupation, and at this time my toes are perfectly
cured. (Signed) OLIVER SMITH JENKINS.

Member of the London Hospital Medical Society, &c.
Marriage requires the fulfilment of several conditions, in order tha 1
it may be really the cause Of mutual happiness. Could the veil,
which covers the origin of ddmestic wretchedness, be raised, and its
true source in every instance disclosed, in how many could it be
traced to physical disqualifications and their attendant disappoint,
ments. Excesses are always injurious; the gift,which when used in
moderation is fraught with advantage, becomes, when abused, the
prolific source of mischief, and of greater or less injury to the con-
stitutional and vital powers. The particular excesses, on the nature
and consequences of which this Treatise professes to dilate, are pro-
ductive of greater severity of misery to the human frame, than any
o ther which it is subject.
This work contains an accurate and complete account of the Ana-
tomy and Physiology of the Reproductive Organs, and of theirrelative
conditions in health and disease. It deservedly requires the closest
attention snd study; for what subject can be of more importance than
the preservation of the health, and of the physicalcapabilities ofwhich
every man should be possessed. It unfortunately happens that the
unhappy victim of excessive indulgence and vicious habits, whether
acquired in early life or from the follies of advanced age, while suffer-
ing from their invariable consequences, unwisely entertains a fear of
applying to a qualified physician for relief. Shame and the dread so
frequently but erroneously entertained that these complaints are bet
yond the reach of art, alike restrict him and prevent his seeking for
assistance where alone it can be procured. In acting thus, he forgets
that accurate discrimination in ascertaining the causes of disease,
sympathy with the sufferer, and, above all, secrecy, invariably cha-
racterise the intelligent and practical physician, and to the medical
man, who can shew by his possession of the requisite legal qualifica-
tions that he is entitled to esteem and respect in his professional
pursuits the utmost confidence should be extended. Dr. La?Mert
has obtained the highest medical honours, as his diplomas testify,
and the great extent of his practice for many years is a guarantee for
his professional experience, which has reference almost solely to the
treatment of these diseases.

FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE.
FRANCE.
The debates in the Legislative Assembly during the week
have excited interest on account of the hold position taken by
the Republican party, and the evident effect it has had on the
recent policy of the government on the affairs of Italy, by
their despatching on Wednesday an order for the recal of
General Oudinot. Rumours are afloat that a serious division
has broken out in the ranks of the Legitimists, and that
several have given in their adhesion to the cause of Napoleon,
whom they express their willingness to elect as Consul for
ten?years. The ultra-Legitimists are furious at any such
idea. It is, however, said that several of the leading Legiti-
mists took the opportunity of the recent visit to the west to
express their feelings that an extension of the period of the
presidential reign is the only means of restoring the country
to its former prosperity. There is, however, no doubt that
at present the uncertain state of the government, and the
conviction which every one has that the Republic, in its pre-
sent form, cannot stand, have a most injurious effect upon
commerce.
The imposition of new taxes is looked upon, under present
circumstances, as a very hazardous experiment; and yet there
seems to he no alternative between that course and plunder-
ing the public creditor.
The Paris papers of Friday confirm the signing of the
treaty of peace between Austria and Sardinia. La Presse.
adds that the Austrian Government had engaged to proclaim
it previous to the signing of the treaty. A similar engage-
ment had been made in the name of the Duke of Parma and
Modena. The news from the provinces is devoid of interest.
M. Edgar Ney, aide-de-camp to the President of the Re-
public, set out for Rome on Thursday afternoon with a mis-
sion to General Oudinot, who is recalled.
General Oudinot is to return to France with a portion of
the army. General Rostolan is to assume the command of
the French army. General Oudinot is not to be replaced.
Colonel Ney is charged to present a letter from the President
of the Republic, and another from the Cabinet Ministers, to

opinions have prepared the following resolution;?? The
French Republic recognises the independence and the nation-
ality of Hungary.? The executive Government will adopt
such measures as are necessary to secure the integrity of the
Hungarian territory against all foreign intervention and in-
vasion.
HUNGARY
The accounts from the seat of war in Hungary are of the
most conflicting character; at one time the progress of the
Austrians and Russians is described as of the most satisfactory
character; at another, that the Hungarians have baffled their
opponents and inflicted on them severe chastisement. The
official news from Vienna presents a singular contrast with
the accounts given by the German papers. They deny most
explicitly that Georgey has succeeded in forcing the Austro-
Russian line, by separating the armies commanded by General
Haynau and Prince Paskewitch. On the contrary, it is Prince
Paskewitch who has prevented the junction of Georgey and
Dembinski.
General Haynau has destroyed another Hungarian town.
Csongrad not having received the Austrian troops with such
? friendly demonstrations? as the inhabitants of Ketskemet
and Felegyhaza, the commander-in-chief ordered it to be first
plundered, and then burned down.
Szegedin was occupied by the Austrians on the 31 st ult.,
without firing a shot. Whether the explosion of the powder
magazine, on the 28th, was the result of accident or design
has not been cleared up. General Haynau shifted his head-
quarters from Felegyhaza to Szegedin on the Ist inst. The
Hungarian Generals Messaros, Kiss, and Desoffy withdrew
their troops from the fortifications without offering any re-
sistance. It is important to add that intelligence of the oc-
cupation of Szegedin is given from private sources, and notin
an official form.
Munkacs, a town in the Beregh county, north-east of
Debreczin, has been taken by the Russian corps, entered from
Stry, and the Hungarian bishop, Popovich, hanged.
Raab has been taken and occupied by the Hungarians. All
was consternation and alarm at Presburg.
The manoeuvre is said by some to have been executed by
Aulich. The town naturally did not refuse to receive him,
and thus the most important position in the rear of the Aus-
trians is now in the hands of the insurgents.
A disorderly crowd of fugitives arrived at Presburg on the
4th inst., and it was soon known that the Hungarians were
within sight of Altenburg, at the distance of twelve English
miles from Presburg. At Gorgo and Raab the Hungarians
found large stores of victuals and ammunition, 80,000 bushels
of oats, and 2,400 head of cattle, which they carried off to the
fortress of Comorn. Besides this, they captured two com-
panies of Austrian foot and six pieces of art illery. The Hun-
garian troops, who were commanded by Klapka, did not keep
possession of Raab, but returned to the fortress.
A Constantinople correspondent, writing on the 24th says,
? A courier from Galatz has brought us the following news ;
?The Austrian-Russian array, 60,000 strong, which after it
had compelled the Hungarian General Perczel to retire, and
had occupied the cities of Hermanstadt and Cronstadt, and
other small places, advanced as far as Sarcani. The errors
and imprudences of Perczel in Transylvania induced the
Hungarian Government to send General Bern to retake the
command of that most important part of Hungary. He
(Bern) collected all the forces under liis command, amounting
to 40,000 men ; marched immediately against the enemy, and
on arriving at Sarcani offered battle to the Russian General
Luders. The battle commenced on the morning of the 10th
by a stratagetic movement on the part of Bern, by which he
cut off the whole of the left wing of the Austrian army,
attacking the right at the same time, and compelling it to
fall back upon the centre. General Bern, seeing the disorder
of the enemy?s line, ordered the reserve to advance, which, by
a determined and gallant charge, decided the day in favour
of the Hungarians. The Austrian-Russian army took to a
precipitous flight, leaving on the field 10,000 dead and
wounded, nearly all the artillery, and 8,000 prisoners, among
whom is General Aulemberg. After this battle General Bern
again took possession of Cronstadt and Hermanstadt. In
Galicia General Dembinski is also reported to have gained a
victory, and taken General Froytag prisoner.?
A correspondent of the Times , writing from Presburg,
states that ? so sudden was the approach of the Hungarians
upon Raab that the imperialist garrison of that place was
seized with a panic. Their flight was general and disorderly
in the extreme. The fugitive officers presumed that the
cities of Raab and Gorgo were taken?indeed, there was
nothing to prevent the Hungarians from taking them, and
with them an enormous quantity of stores, the whole com-
missariat of the imperialist army, which had been concentrated
in the two places previous to being sent into the interior to
the army of General Haynau. At Gorgo the Hungarians
must have found two steamers with a quantity of boats which
they were intended to drag. On the quays were above 80,000
bushels of oats and enormous quantities of flour, rice, and
vinegar, and 2,400 head of cattle?all of which fell into the
hands of the Hungarians. The loss of the Imperialists is
estimated at 1,000,000 of florins, but in reality the loss is much
greater, for the lives of the Imperialist armies in Hungary
depended on the safety of their stores, which cannot now be
replaced in time to be of any use to them. The Hungarians
captured also two companies of foot and six pieces of artillery.
Several troops of lancers, too, were missing.? Of the diffi-
culties met with by the Austrian armies on their advance into
the interior of the country he states, ? that Haynau finds
the difficulties of his march almost insuperable. There are
rumours Of his having been forced to fall back upon Ketsh-
kemet. His soldiers are stated to have suffered more than
any army ever did. Their march from Pesth was a weary
plodding through the deep burning sand. The horses and
the artillery could scarcely move along. With the exception
of Ketshkemet they did not find a single village. There were
neither numan creatures nor animals. The inhabitants of
those places had wandered away; they had burnt their vil-
lages, and filled the wells with putrid carcases of men and
animals. No water is to be had, and the soldiers must drink
the hot and corrupted water which General Haynau carries
along with his army. They mix it with vinegar to make it
drinkable. On their weary march they found, as yet, not a
trace of the Hungarian army, and it is very doubtful whether
that army will oppose them at Szegedin. But if the Hunga-
rians were to attack and. defeat General Haynau at Szegedin,
the probability is that but few of the Imperialists would live
to tell the fate of the battle, for the Landsturra would rise up
in their rear and prevent their escape.?
PRUSSIA.
From Prussia we learn that the session of the Chamber
was opened on Tuesday with a royal speech delivered by
Count Brandenburg in the King?s name. The speech
touched generally on the great events which have been pass-
ing in Germany during the last few months, alluded with
satisfaction to the formation of a federal state, and to the ap-
proaching convocation of the Reichstag, and gave a favour-
able account of the financial condition of Prussia. The
speech was well received, and at its close the Chambers gave
three cheers for the King.
BADEN.
The affairs of Baden are gradually subsiding into their
former state of quiet monotony; and it is said that the peace
of the Grand Duchy for the next three years will be ensured
by the presence of 30,000 Prussian troops, who will occupy it
for that period. The misunderstanding with Switzerland,
arising out of the violation of the territory of the Confedera-
tion, has been honourably settled; but the precautionary
measures adopted by the Federal Council have been fully
sanctioned by the Diet, who will resist any attempt on the
part of the refugees to disturb the peace of the country, and
resent any future violation of their frontier by an appeal to
arms.
ITALY.
From Italy we have the important news that the treaty of
peace between Austria and Piedmont has at length been
signed, the Austrian Cabinet having pledged itself to the
English and French Governments tograntan amnesty to the
Lombards, although for reasons of state it declined to insert
it in the treaty. The Grand Duke of Tuscany made his
triumphal entry into Florence on the 28th ult., and was re-
ceived by his subjects with great enthusiasm. At Rome, all
parties and classes, military, civil, clerical, and diplomatic, ap-
pear to be growing weary of the indecision of the Pope, and
of the delay in announcing his intentions. The Commission
which he has appointed has arrived from Gaeta, and has com-
menced a system of reaction in which Austrian influence is
too openly disclosed to satisfy either the French Government
or the Roman people. General Oudinot has been already
recalled to France, and the Duke d?Harcourt, the French
Ambassador at Rome, has returned unexpectedly to Paris, for
the purpose of consulting the President and his Cabinet re-
specting the terms on which the Pope shall return to Rome
?a subject upon which neither the diplomatists nor the
generals can agree. It appears, therefore, that those were not
far wrong who predicted that, when the French entered
Rome as conquerors, they would soon discover that the
troubles of their intervention were only then beginning.
UNITED STATES.
By the Niagara, which arrived at Liverpool on Tuesday,
we have advices that the annexation of Canada and Cuba now
occupies public attention to a greater extent than any other
political question of the day; and all this new impulse to
future ? extension of the area of freedom? has been produced
by the recent disaffection and riots in Canada. Many of the
journals of both the great parties allude to future annexation
as all but a certainty, adding, however, that it will or must be
on fair terms, and without any infraction of treaty or national
faith, either with England or Spain ; and these sentiments
are favourably echoed in several public organs on the Canadian
side of the St. Lawrence. But the annexation of Canada
would infer the addition of several new free states, and even
the present vague talk of such a thing has in some measure
roused the ever-wakeful slave states of the south.
Cholera, that dreadful destroyer, and, indeed, many other
kindred diseases, continue their destructive ravages.
A shocking state of affairs has been developed at Alleghany,
a city adjoining Pittsburg. The last steamer?s news informed
us that thirty -eight buildings and a church had been burnt
down, probably by incendiarism. It appears that the volun-
teer fire companies of the place had solicited 400 dollars from
the city councils, but owing to unavoidable circumstances,
and perhaps, also, to the riotous conduct of these firemen, the
sum was not granted. This dreadful conflagration then oc-
curred, and the Hlleghany firemen not only refused to ex-
tinguish it, but actually prevented the Pittsburg firemen from
working?thus heartlessly and wickedly sacrificing the pro-
perty of their fellow-citizens to a petty feeling of spite.
Later from California we have advices that 6,000 Mexicans,
at least, had arrived at San Francisco. They were very tur-
bulent, and trouble was expected. The gold dust had not
been freely dug out for several weeks, owing to the swollen
streams.
CANADA.
The population of Canada continue to exhibit violent feelings
of disgust at the ignorance and infatuation of the British
Ministry as exhibited in the late debates in the Houses of Par-
liament ; and, instead of asking for their independence, are
most determined for annexation.
There are reports of Orange riots in Canada from various
sources. At St. Catherine?s and Quebec there was great ex-
citement, and serious damage caused. Further disturbances
were expected, but we have no intelligence up to the date of
the letter. In Toronto there was a tremendous gathering of
the Orangemen, but everything went off peaceably.
THE CHOLERA.
The virulence of the visitation is evidently decreasing,
though the numbers increase, probably from the spread of the
disease into new districts. In London the more airy and open
districts to the north-east are almost wholly free. The chief
mortality is confined to the vicinity of the river, and especially
to the south side.
In general the mortality has been confined to the lower
orders, who indulge in all kinds of food (dangerous at this
period), pineapples in a state of decay, sold in penny slices in
the streets, unripe fruit, stale fish, and foreign meat of a bad
quality. If to those we add the vast quantity of medicated
beer and deleterious liquors swallowed, with the thermometer
at 8 or more, it is easy to conceive the progress of mortality.
The only expedients against cholera are the same as those
against every other disease?temperance, the avoidance of
hazardous food, caution in the use of fruit, and immediate re-
course to the nearest medical man on the first plain symptoms
of illness in the stomach.
We would also suggest to the ecclesiastical authorities the
fitness of a general day of supplication that we may be re-
lieved from a disease which, though it does not sweep the
land, keeps the nation in fear, and which the hand of the
Great Disposer of all things can alone remove.
The following hints, suggested by a committee of physician 3
and surgeons of Southampton, appear to be well calculated t
allay the fears which at present prevail in the minds of
many:?
1. Temperate Habits.? lntemperance or any excess, late
hours, and every habit which weakens the body, should he
altogether avoided. Those who indulge in intoxication and
debauchery are most liable to be attacked.
2. Diet. ? Wholesome and nutritious food in moderation
prevents disease ; and those who are poor should rather spend
their money in good food than in beer and spirits. Those
who are weak, or are liable to bowel complaints, should abstain
from fruit and vegetables. All should avoid sour beer, acid
drinks, unripe fruit, and fish not perfectly fresh, especially
shell-fish.
3. Cleanliness? The skin should be frequently washed,
and the greatest attention paid to personal cleanliness.
4. Clothing ?The clothing should be such as to keep the
body comfortably warm. Flannel should be worn next to the
skin, particularly around the bowels and loins. No one should
rest in wet clothes or with wet feet.
5. Ventilation.? The windows and doors of rooms should
be frequently opened, especially if many persons are working
together at sedentary occupations in the same apartment.
Bed-room windows and doors should he freely opened during
the day, and all fire-boards or obstructions in the chimneys
removed at night as well as by day. Bed-rooms without
chimneys should have a ventilator in the window, or the door
should not be shut at night, otherwise they are very un-
wholesome. The beds should be stripped early, and not made
for several hours.
6. Drainage.? The house drains should be well washed
down every evening, as experience has shown that this is ne-
cessary even where the drains are well trapped. If any bad
smell is complained of in the house, its cause should be dis-
covered and removed. In such cases the traps of the drains
should be examined. No filth whatever should be allowed to
accumulate near the house. All rooms requiring it should
be fresh whitewashed.
7. Improper Medicines.? Epsom salts and strong pur-
gatives should be avoided.
8. Looseness of the Bowels, ? Persons attacked with
looseness of the bowels, however slight, should immediately
apply for medical advice, for looseness is the first stage of
cholera, and if neglected for a few hours, may pass into fatal
cholera. By attending to this precaution, the disease was
checked in many places in 1832, and in the present epidemic
in Europe it has been found ? that the greatest attention
must be paid to the looseness which precedes cholera.?
9. Protection against Cholera ? ln conclusion, the
public are reminded that those who are temperate in all
things, cheerful and free from alarm, by confidently trusting
the kind providence of God, active and regular in their habits,
early in their hours, and clean in their persons and houses,
are the least liable to be attacked with cholera.
Mr. Stanford, the Conservative candidate, has been
returned for Reading, having polled more votes than
those of both his ultimate competitors?Mr. Bowyer,
supported by the Tories, and Mr. Warton by the Radicals.
The Late Mr. Denison, M.P. ? The late Mr. Denison,
M.P. for West Surrey, and senior partner in the banking
firm of Denisons, Hey wood, and Kennard, has died worth
more than 2,000,0001. of money, the principal part of
which is settled upon Lord Albert Conyngham andhisheirs.
The Yorkshire estates of this ?wealthy man are valued at
more than half a million; those in Surrey at 100,0001.;
the remainder of the property is in the funds and other
securities. We are glad to hear that the Marquis of
Conyngham has not been forgotten ; his deceased relative
having left him a handsome legacy. The whole property
is valued at 2,300,0001. ?a sum sufficient to support any
title, and a sum which we hope may always be in as safe
hands as the present fortunate possessor has proved him-
self to be, or a shrewd man like the late Mr. Denison
would never have placed him in his present position.?
Shipping Gazette.
New ? Religious? Association. ?A mystical associa-
tion has just been formed in Berlin under the Presidency
of the Count Otto von Schlippenbach, under the denomi-
tion of ?League of fidelity for women,? of which any
respectable lady?married or single?who adopts the
nfotto of King Frederick William?? I and my house
have decided to walk in the paths of the Lord??may
become a member. Candidates for the honour are sub-
ject to a form of election. The order is divided into four
degrees?l. The ? Henrietta? degree (colour green), in
honour of the wife of the great elector. 2. The ? Sophia?
degree (colour white), of which the Queen of Frederick
is the patroness. 3. The ? Louisa? degree (rose colour),
in honour of the defunct Queen. 4. The ? Elizabeth? de-
gree (colour blue), in honour of the present Queen Consort.
The fetes of the League include the birthdays of the
King, the Queen, and the Crown Prince, the anniver-
sary of the foundation of the foundation of the order, and
that of the last King?s death.
What Next?? We find the following advertisement
in the Morning Herald of Monday ; ?? Clairvoyance,
?Any Lady or Gentleman wishing to test the power of
Clairvoyance may by enclosing thirteen postage stamps,
accompanied with a lock of hair and real initials , receive
satisfactory answers to any Six Questions referring either
to the past, the present, or the future.??Then follows
the address.
Prolific Potato. ?Mr. Clear, gardener, Weedon,
renting a garden near the barracks, some days back dug
up a root on which there were fifty-one potatoes, and
several other roots having on each respectively 20, 30,
and 40 potatoes. Before setting the potatoes, the ground
was dressed with lime, the seed then placed in trenches,
and covered with turf ashes, and afterward with mould
in a common way. ?Northampton Mercury.
Extraordinary Yield of Potatoes. ?We under-
stand that a single root, dug up a week ago, in the garden
of Mr. Tweedale, of Masbro?, yielded the astonishing
number of 289 potatoes. They are called Banbury kid-
neys, and are seedlings of the second year?s growth.?
Sheffield Times.
We understand from undoubted authority that imme-
diately on the marriage of Lieutenant Heald with the
Countess of Lansfeldt (Lola Montes), the Marquis of
Londonderry, Colonel of the 2nd Life Guards, took the
most decisive steps to recommend to her Majesty that
this officer?s resignation should be insisted on, and that
he should leave the regiment, which this unfortunate and
extraordinary act might possibly prejudice.? Post.
The Emperor of Russia?s Quick Travelling.?
An anecdote, showing the rapidity with which the Em-
peror travels, and his indifference to the modes of con-
veyance, is narrated in connection with his last journey
to Petersburg!). On arriving within about a hundred miles
of his destination, the w heels of the imperial carriage
were found to be on fire, whereupon the emperor jumped
out, mounted the little teleka, in which sat his field-jager
(courier), and leaving Count Orloff to extinguish the fire
and follow, proceeded onwards, and arrived as fresh at
St. Petersburgh as if he had not been jolted during twelve
hours in a vehicle without springs.? Correspondent of the
Morning Chronicle.
Bangor, August 9.?A terrific thunder and lightning
storm took place in this city between one and two o?clock
this morning, which has destroyed property and life.

inquest is now holding on the body. Another lady died
from fright. A fine horse was awfully injured and died;
also a dog.
A Midwife Committed for Manslaughter.?A
coroner?s jury sat at the Town-hall, Sheffield, on Satur-
day and Monday, to investigate the circumstances of a
case which involved a serious charge against Mrs. Cus-
worth, one of the midwives in the employment of the
Sheffield Public Dispensary, w r ho was alleged to have dis-
played the greatest ignorance and inhumanity in attend-
ing on a Mrs. Mappin, of Sheffield, during her confine-
ment. Mr. Moor, a surgeon, who was called in by Mrs.
Cusworth, but too late to be of any service, deposed that
he found the w-oraan in a most dangerous state, and that
he had never seen an instance of grosser ignorance and
want of skill, or a case of more brutal treatment. The
coroner summed up, and the jury returned a verdict of
? Manslaughter? against Mrs. Cusworth, who was com-
mitted to York for trial at the next assizes. In reply to
an application to admit the prisoner to bail, the coroner
stated that he had no power to do so, but if application
to that effect were made to a judge it would probably be
granted.

The Grain Crops. ?We may congratulate our rea
on their prospect of the finest harvest ever seen in this
country. There never was a better promise, and though
the result still depends on many contingencies, it is satisfac-
tory to think that average circumstances, during the next
month or six weeks, will fill our barns and stackyards
with as much food for man and for beast as they ever
held before. They are empty enough now ; the stock of
wheat on hand in Great Britain is certainly under an
average, and in Ireland our correspondents report " none,?
? none,? ? none.? The harvest, too, is generally later
than it has been, but it will have begun very generally
through the South of England in the course of next week.
?Agricultural Gazette.
The Potato Crop. ? It was not without cause that
the potato crop is still, unsafe, notwithstanding its ap-
parent soundness. At the very hour when those remarks
were written it had begun to appear near London. At
Putney, on Friday, it was suddenly noticed, and every
post has since that day brought some unfavourable com-
munication.? Gardener's Chronicle.
Potatoes.? Potatoes appear to be progressing favour-
ably, and most of the early sorts that have yet been dug
have turned up sound and free from disease ; the later
kinds continue also to be well spoken of on the whole,
though reports have within the last few days reached us
from the westward expressing apprehension, and it must
be admitted that symptoms of the blight have manifested
themselves in some localities where a week ago the plant
was looking perfectly healthy. This is, however, we are
happy to say, the exception to the rule : to expect to be
all at once and wholly freed from a disorder which has
for several succeeding seasons attacked this root, would
be unreasonable ; but we do hope and think there is good
ground to believe that the disease will this year do com-
paratively little mischief in a national point of view. Up
to the present time we have not heard of its appearance in
Scotland, and in Ireland it seems to be quite rare as com-
pared with previous seasons.? Mark Lane Express.

Wednesday, August 8.
ENTRANCE INTO DUBLIN.
The Royal procession reached Baggot-strcet bridge at 25
minutes past ten. Here the, city keys were presented hy the
Lord Mayor. The crowds were immense all along the line,
and the cheering was most enthusiastic, kept up from house
to house and street to street. The Queen and Prince Albert,
who were followed in another carriage by the royal children,
were evidently deeply moved by this extraordinary manifes-
tation of popular acclamation, in which ail classes?from the,
highest to the humblest?participated. At a quarter past
eleven o?clock the procession passed through Nassau-street
into College-green, between the University and the Bank of
Ireland. This building attracted the attention of the Royal
Family from its admirable proportions, its impressive and
pleasing appearance. Immediately before the statue of King
William, and facing the entrance to the College, a troop of
the Enniskillen Dragoons was drawn up, and a company of
the 17th Lancers was stationed along that wing of the Bank
opposite College-street. The Bank itself was an object of
much attraction ; large numbers of persons were collected on
the roof, and some of them were grouped round the figures
surmounting the facade of that noble building, and presented
a very novel and picturesque appearance. It is unnecessary
to state that every available space was occupied, and such was
the anxiety to procure a favourable situation for viewing the
gorgeous pageant, that numbers of the respectable citizens
gladly availed themselves of the recesses formed by the
columns which support the left wing of the Bank. Her Ma-
jesty and his Hoyal Highness appeared highly gratified at the
cordial manner in which the people welcomed their approach,
and were greatly pleased with the beauty and elegance of
the public buildings which adorn this portion of the city.
The cortege next entered Westmoreland-street, where it
was seen to great advantage; the width of the street, and
the admirable arrangement of the troops by whom the
line was formed, affording every facility to pedestrians
for observing the most interesting features of the Royal
procession. Like all the other thoroughfares which we
have described, this street presented a very gay and ani-
mated appearance. The windows and house tops were
literally alive with spectators, and the different balconies
erected were equally crowded with anxious lookers on.
Several of the houses were decorated in a very tasteful man-
ner with evergreens and flowers, which were wreathed with
elegant and graceful designs. The procession continued its
route over Carlisle-bridge, where a dense multitude was con-
gregated. The river presented a very gay appearance, the
vessels having their colours flying, and the yardarms being
filled with sailors. The appearance of the procession, as it
moved along Sackville-street, was very imposing, the extreme
breadth of that splendid thoroughfare permitting every object
to be seen to the greatest advantage. Here, as in other places,
vast numbers had assembled to witness the interesting scene,
and from an early hour the houses on both sides of the street
were fully occupied. An immense flag waved from the top
of Nelson?s Pillar, the base of which was surrounded by a
wooden paling, on which appeared the letters ? V.R.? toge-
ther with a crown and harp. The Post-office was much
crowded, as were also the balconies, which were very neatly
fitted up, and ornamented by wreaths of laurel and other
evergreens. The street was lined by the 55th infantry. At
the Rotunda an immense platform was erected, extending al
round the front of the building, and that wing opposite
Cavendish-row. It is needless to say that this platform was
filled to excess, and that the occupants testified, by every
means in theirpower, their feelings of respect and attachment
for their Sovereign. As the procession passed under the arch
at Eccles-street, a dove was lowered from a window into the
Royal carriage, which her Majesty placed beside her, amid
loud cheers from the vast multitude assembled at this point;
after which the cortege moved on, and passing along the
Circular-road, reached the Viceregal Lodge at a quarter past
12 o?clock.
CORN EXCHANGE.?MARK LANE, LONDON.
MONDAY, Aug. 13.?There was a very limited supply of wheat bv
land carriage samples from Essex, Kent, and Suffolk for this day?s
market, and few samples of barley and beans; but a good show of
new peas from the near counties, whilst the fresh arrivals of English
and Scotch oats wero quite trifling ; there were none from Ireland.
The importations of foreign wheat and barley have been only mode-
rate, but those of oats pretty good, with a fair quantity of other arti-
cles of the trade.
During the past week the weather on the whole was pretty favour-
able for harvest work, Saturday proving a very hot and breezy day
but was succeeded at night by thunder showers, and since then it
has been more unsettled; this morning it is alternately very wet and
sunny, just the sort of weather to cause sprouting.
The decline submitted to at last Monday?s market, combined with
the busy occupation of the farmers, caused a most limited supply of
wheat to be brought forward this morning, and the downward tend-
ency has been checked; but although former prices were obtained
the trade was not lively. '
A few samples of new wheat appeared at Friday?s market from
Essex, they were the first for this season, quality fair but not fine
To-day there was very little addition of new, one sample red from
Essex, smutty, but in good condition, and two samples from Kent
white, about 61 lb., of fair but not fine quality and, sold for about fiOs*.
There was rather more doing in foreign wheat, as the showery state*
of the weather induced the millers to take finer qualities with less
caution at last week?s currency. Flour was much the same, some
millers selling on lower terms. Grinding barley realised former rates.
Beans in fair request at last week?s currency. New peas plentiful at
Is. to 2s. per qr. cheaper. Fair trade in good oats, at the full rates
of this day se?nnight.

Why pass me thus unheeded by,
Nor deign one gracious look ;
Hast thou a dull or partial eye
For nature?s varied book ?
Thou dost not shun the gay parterre ;
Thou dost not scorn the fields;
Each plant that buds and blossoms there
Some heavenly teaching yields.

They teach thee much, they teach thee well;

Deign then one passing gaze.

Enwreathes her unkempt hair ?
What though more courtly eyes may scorn

Those eyes have never looked upon
More graceful loveliness.

Betting?s to 4 agst The Recluse (t), 6 to 4 agst Muff (t), 4to 1
agst Lampoon filly (t), fi to 1 agst Dick?s Hat Band. This was a
splendid race. The Recluse made a strong effort, but when ap-
proaching the stand fell back. Lord Chesterfield?s filly, Jereed,
Dick?s Hat Band, and the Gladiator filly were abreast on passing the
stand, but the contest was between the Don John fil y and Jereed,
the former winning cleverly by a short head. Dick?s Hat Band and
the Gladiator filly were so close up that the Judge could not tell
which was third. Recluse was fifth.

To close the eyes, and give a seemly comfort to the apparel

Doubtful Dogs .?? What dogs are these, Jasper,? inquired

Love. ?There is a fragrant blossom that maketh glad the
garden of the heart; its root lieth deep; it is delicate, yet
lasting, as the lilac crocus of autumn ; loneliness and thought
are the dews that water it morn and even ; memory and ab-
sence cherish it, as the balmy breathings of the south ; its sun
is the brightness of affection, and it bloometh on the borders
of hope; its companions are gentle flowers, and the briar
withereth by its side. I saw it budding in beauty; I felt the
magic of its smile; the violet rejoiced beneath it, the rose
stooped down and kissed it; and I thought some cherub had
planted there a truant flower of Eden, as a bird bringeth
foreign seeds that they may flourish in a kindly soil, t saw
and asked its name; I knew no language was so wealthy,

Proverbial Philosophy.
Concerning Eggs.? At breakfast, one morning, in that
quiet and comfortable old inn, the White Swan, in York, a
foreigner made quick dispatch with the eggs. Thrusting his
spoon into the middle, he drew out the yolk, devoured it, and
passed on to the next. When he had got to his seventh egg,
an old farmer, who had already been prejudiced against mon-
sieur by his moustachioes, could brook the extravagance no
longer, and speaking up, said, ? Why, Sir, j r ou leave all the
white! How is Mrs. Lockwood to afford to find breakfast at
that rate ?? ? Sacrebleu I? exclaimed the Frenchman, ? you

We have heard a good deal of American eloquence. The
following rich specimen is given by Sir Charles Lyell, in his
Second Visit to the United States :?? It would be impossible
to burlesque or caricature the ambitious style of certain mem-
bers of Congress, especially some who have risen from humble
stations, and whose schooling has been in the hack-woods.
A grave report, drawn up in the present session by the mem-
ber for Illinois, as chairman of a post-office committee, may
serve as an example. After speaking of the American re-
public as ? the infant Hercules,? and the extention of their im-
perial dominion over the * northern continent and oriental
seas,? he exclaims: * The destiny of our nation has now be-
come revealed, and great events, quickening in the womb of
time, reflect their clearly defined shadows into our very eye-
balls. Oh, why does a cold generation frigidly repel ambro-
sial gifts like these, or sacrilegiously hesitate to embrace their
glowing and resplendent fate ? Must this backward pull of
the government never cease, and the nation tug for ever be-
neath a dead weight, which trips its heels at every stride ?? ?
A clergyman being at a wedding party where there were
some wild young men, they proposed that he should drink
with them; to this he assented, remarking at the same time
that ?he could drink like a beast.? At this they stared at
each other, and winked plainly, intimating that they would
make him go the entire animal. After drinking a glass, he
positively refused to take any more. They then reminded
him of his promise; to which he replied, ? I have performed
my promise ?1 have had enough, and a beast always leaves
off when he has had enough.?
A Dog Disgusted. ?Sir Walter Scott, on being asked to
sit for his portrait for Terry the actor, said that both he and
his dog Maida were tired of that sort of thing?Maida par-
ticularly; for she had been so often sketched that whenever
she saw an artist unfurl his paper and arrange his brushes,
she got up and walked off with a dignity and expression of
loathing almost human? The Drawing-Room Jest Rook.
A Charming Spot.? A London periodical writes regarding
the Creraorne Gardens in the following grandiloquent style:
?? In these piping times, when a panting, perspiring popula-

is something positively refreshing and deliciously suggestive
of comparative frigidity in these aquatic fetes.?
The Result of Female Emigration to New South
Wales. ?Out of the fifty orphan girls who were sent to
Moreton Bay from the latest emigrant ship, forty-nine already
are married. The fiftieth, upon being asked ? why she re-
mained single?? said that ?although she had received an ex-
cellent offer, she could not get married because there was not
a bridesmaid left for her; hut she was anxiously waiting for
the next draft of immigrants, when that little difficulty would
be got over.? This is a fact. Australian Sportsman , March,

TUESDAY, Aug. 7.
BANKRUPTCY ANNULLED.
Edward Gibson and George Sturt, St. Alban?s, bankers.
VISIT TO PUBLIC BUILDINGS.
Tuesday.
Notwithstanding the unfavourable state of the weather on
Tuesday, her Majesty fulfilled her previously announced in-
tention of visiting the principal public buildings in this city.
At a quarter to twelve o?clock, her Majesty and Prince
Albert, accompanied by Prince George of Cambridge, Lord
and Lady Fortescue, and Lord and Lady Jocelyn, arrived at
the Bank of Ireland, in three carriages, each drawn by two
horses. A few mounted police rode in front of the Royal
cortege to prevent obstructions. As her Majesty and Prince
Albert alighted from their carriage they were enthusiastically
cheered by the crowd, which in a moment congregated in
College Green. The Royal party were received by the board
of directors; and in the hall of the bank the Lord Primate,
the Archbishop of Dublin, Mr. Justice Crampton, Baron
Lefroy, and some other gentlemen, were in waiting to pay
their respects to her Majesty and her Royal Consort. The
governor and deputy governor then conducted the Royal
party to the printing office, where they inspected the new
and eminently scientific machinery, invented by Mr. Grubb,
for the printing of notes which defy the forger?s art. Her
Majesty was greatly pleased with the operation of printing
and numbering the notes, and generally with the whole of the
machinery of this very interesting department. The Royal
visitors were next conducted to the fine hall now called the
? Court of Proprietors,? hut originally built for, and,
until the union, used by the Irish Lords. This apartment is
in nearly the same state as when the Viceroys of Ireland
entered it to read from the throne the speeches of the
monarchs of Great Britain. The dais of the throne is
there ; but, instead of a canoped chair, the place where
the throne stood is occupied by Bacon?s splendid statue
of George 111., executed in JBl2. Her Majesty examined
this work minutely, and commented upon its beauties.
There were two ornamented chairs placed at the base of
the statue, but her Majesty and the Prince remained stand-
ing while the Governor of the Bank described the trifling
alterations which had been made in the interior of ? the
Irish House of Lords? to reduce it to the condition of a
? Court of Proprietors of Bank Stock.? The fine old tapes-
tries which clothed and ornamented the walls on the right
and left of the throne are there still, apparently little the
worse of the additional half century of age which has passed
away since their subjects suggested to weary orators matters
of excitement. That on the right hand represents the siege
of Londonderry,? with the never-to-he-forgotten motto of
?No Surrender,? remarkably prominent. On the left there
is the Battle of the Boyne?of course King William the
Third being in the foreground advancing towards that river,
while King James?called in Irish Shemus a bocca , or dirty
King Jim?is seen gallopping off as fast and as frightened as
Tam o? Shanterat the bridge of Doon. Her Majesty and the
Royal Princes appeared much pleased with their visit to this
apartment?so full of remarkable associations, at least to the
Irish people. The House of Commons, now the Cash-office,
was next inspected by the Royal party; after which they
took their leave, and proceeded to the schools of the National
Board of Education. Her Majesty was received by the mem-
bers of the hoard in town, who conducted her through the
various departments of this valuable institution. The chil-
dren welcomed their Royal visitors, by singing in admirable
style the national anthem, ?God save the Queen.? Her
Majesty particularly inquired into the workings of the
girls? school, several of the pupils in which were examined,
and whose answers were rewarded by her Majesty?s en-
comiums. The Royal party next proceeded to Trinity
College. As the authorities and students of this venerable
and valued institution had due notice of her Majesty?s inten-
tion to visit it on Tuesday, everything was arranged forgiving
effect to the reception of the Royal party. Her Majesty was
much pleased with the extent and beauty of the building, or
rather buildings?the splendid park and squares?and the
library. In this department the Royal party delayed a con-
siderable time, and manifested a lively interest in the principal
curiosities, to which their attention was called by the Provost
and the Vice-Chancellor. Her Majesty closely examined the
Irish harp, once the property of King Brian Boroimhe (pro-
nounced Boroo.) It is said to be the veritable ? Harp that
once through Tara?s Hall the soul of music shed.? But
whether it is or not, this much we know, that Donah, the son
of Brian, laid it with the golden crown at the feet of the Pope
in 1023, and a succeeding Pope presented it to Henry VIII.
of England, but his Holiness took precious good care to keep
the marketable part of the present to himself. The harp
was given by Henry to Lord Clanricarde, who gave it to the
M?Mahons ;* and about 1782 it was presented to Trinity
College. The inspection of the college curiosities being con-
cluded, and the day being still terribly wet, the Royal party
returned to the Royal Lodge in the Phoenix Park.?The
librarians. Dr. Wall and Dr. Todd, exhibited to her Majesty
the several Irish aud other manuscripts, as well as various
objects of antiquity, in all of which she and the Prince ap-
peared to take considerable interest. Among the volumes
examined by her Majesty is a copy of Sallust, of the 16th
century, with the autograph of Mary, Queen of Scots. The
Queen was pleased to leave in the library another Royal au-
tograph, which will hereafter be regarded with still greater
interest, as a memorial of her visit to Ireland. She wrote her
name as follows in one of the blank leaves of the Book of
Kells: ??Victoria R. August 7th, 1849.? And imme-
diately beneath her Majesty?s signature, Prince Albert wrote
his name as follows: ? Albert. August 7th, 1849.?
After walking through the library, and inspecting the Egyp-
tian papyrus rolls, and the Fagel Collection, the Queen de-
scended the grand staircase, and entered her carriage amidst
the enthusiastic applause of a large number of students of the
university and other persons whom the news of her Majesty?s
visit had attracted to the spot. Her Majesty also visited the
National Schools, Marlborough-street, the Royal Hospital,
Kilmanham, and in the evening there was another

was dressed in a major-general?s uniform, and also wore a star
on his breast. The Lord-Lieutenant wore civilian costume,
and kept generally, through the course of the review, near
Her Majesty?s carriage. Shortly after 11 o?clock the review
commenced. The troops marched past the Royal standard,
beneath which Her Majesty?s carriage was stationed, in slow
and quick time. Several rapid charges of Cavalry followed,
and a series of beautiful evolutions, brilliantly performed,
were gone through by the Infantry regiments. The troops
then commenced firing in line, by platoons, and in square,
whilst the Artillery displayed the perfect training of its men
and horses by a number of splendid evolutions, and the light-
ning rapidity with which the guns and their ponderous car-
riages and ammunition waggons were whirled from one point
to another at the sound of the trumpet, the guns unlimbered,
and shot after shot delivered. The firing of the regular troops
in line was sustained with great regularity, and the rapid
movements of the regiments from line into hollow square were
beautifully performed. The Cavalry charges were splendid ;
as the whole cavalry force on one occasion advanced from the
extreme distance at a trot, and then broke into a charge, the
earth reverberated like distant thunder beneath the hoofs of
the advancing squadrons.
troop of soldiers. What an installation for a minister of
the God of Peace ! The indignant inhabitants have ad-
dressed to the Prefect of Vaucluse a letter in these
terms : ?? We, the undersigned, proprietorsandinhabitants
of the commune of Mormoizon, deeply convinced of the
errors of the Roman Catholic Church, and sincerely
moved by the scandalous effect it produces, declare our firm
and immovable resolution to separate ourselves from the
said church, and to unite ourselves -with the evangelical
church of France, in which we wish to live and die. We
are firmly convinced that it is impossible for us to be saved
in a church such as that which we have abandoned with
all our heart.? This movement is not free from human
alloy and worldly motives. The inhabitants of Mormoi-
zon are not yet instructed in the doctrines of the Gospel.
But it is a first step?a decisive step, and if a pious pastor
be sent amongst them it will be a permanent conquest for
Protestantism.?

. Baptism of the Hon. and Rev. Baptist Noel. ?It
1 having transpired that the Hon. and Rev. Baptist Noel,
who lately seceded from the Church of England, and who
has embraced the views of the Baptists, was to be pub-
licly baptized on Wednesday evening, in John-street
Chapel, Mecklenburgh-square, in the immediate vicinity
of the chapel in which the hon. and rev. gentleman had
preached as a minister of the Church of England for
twenty-two years, the chapel was crowded in every part
long before the time appointed for the commencement of
the services. The number present must have been from
2,000 to 2,500, while almost as great a number must have
gone away unable to obtain admission. The services of
the evening, after the usual preliminaries, were com-
menced by the Rev. Mr. Shepherd, assistant to the Rev.
Mr. Evans, minister of the chapel, delivering a short
sermon, chiefly bearing on the subject of adult baptism.
Mr. Noel himself then ascended the pulpit, and delivered
the address usual among Baptists before the administra-
tion of the ordinance. The hon. and rev. gentleman
spoke at considerable length on the nature and obligation
of adult baptism, the whole of which period he was
listened to with the deepest attention. After some inter-
vening devotional services the hon. and rev, gentleman
descended into the font, which is situated in the body of
the chapel, and was immersed by the Rev. Mr. Shepherd,
Several other persons were also baptized in succession.
The ceremony was witnessed with the deepest interest
by the vast crowd assembled on the occasion.
Wesleyan Love of the Liturgy. ? A Wesleyan cor-
respondent of the Watehman [Wesleyan paper] this
week pleads for the use of the liturgy in the Wesleyan
Chapels; giving the following outline of ?some of his
reasons?:?? First, then, I love the liturgy, because it is
solidly instructive. Its prayers, collects, litany and les-
sons, have a direct and immediate reference to the Holy
Scriptures, and, at the same time, furnish us with a beauti-
ful model of godly simplicity in our addresses to Almighty
God. Extemporary prayer, you know, as to the point of
instruction, is uncertain. We are sometimes greatly
edified, at other times not so.? Secondly , The liturgy em-
bodies those doctrines of Wesleyan Methodism which we
are so anxious to propagate, and in language entirely free
from all rational objection. I could here come in with an
overwhelraingdemonstration. But, ? Thirdly, The liturgy
gives to congregations suitable employment. Too many
people, unless seriously spiritual, find in mere extempo-
rary worship they have nothing to do but sit at their ease
and hear a sermon.? Fourthly , The liturgy is peculiarly
important to children, filling their minds with what I may
call a good store of practical and devotional divinity.?
Fifthly, The liturgy admirably regulates devotional ex-
citement, and assists us to give expression to it in a man-
ner, which at once employs the understanding and reli-
gious affections.?
Ventilation of Mines. ?A correspondent of the
Mining Journal writes as follows : ?? So long as the ex-
hausting system of ventilation is pursued, I believe that
accidents in mines will be common ; increasing both in
frequency and in magnitude, in proportion as mining
operations are extended. How can it be otherwise? What
can more effectually cause the escape of inflammable and
other gases from the workings, than a diminution of pres-
sure? The more active ventilating process, or, in other
words, the nearer, as at present constituted, it approaches
perfection, the greater is the quantity of gas evolved, the
greater the danger in working the mine, and the greater
the cost of maintaining it in a workable condition. Re-
verse the process?let the ventilation be one of propulsion
instead of exhaustion. Force air into a mine, not draw
it out, and then there will be not only effective ventila-
tion, but perfect security, comparative comfort, and a
greater amount of physical energy enjoyed by the work-
men. Let the density of the atmosphere of a mine be
plus instead of minus, as compared with that at the sur-
face of the earth, and there will be no need of Davy?s,
and, under ordinary circumstances, no risk in using can-
dles. In such a case the quantity of gases evolved would
probably not amount to a third part of what it is at pre-
sent and the cost of the propulsive process would, there-
fore, not be so great as might be apprehended. But if it
could be shown that it would be more economical than
the exhausting process would that recommend it ? Wait
a little?let us see if any one will affirm the principle of
propulsion ??O. N.: Black Rock, July 23.
Cruelty to Animals. ?The new act for the preven-
tion of cruelty to animals (12th and 13th Victoria, chap.
92), which came into force on the Istinst., contains 31
clauses, and extends to England and Ireland. Former
acts are repealed, and it is enacted that if any person
shall cruelly beat, ill-treat, over-drive, abuse, or torture
any animal, or cause the same to he ill-used, he shall for
every such offence forfeit and pay a penalty not exceed-
ing 51. Offenders may be taken into custody with or
without a warrant. On non-payment of penalties they
may be committed for a period not exceeding three
months, with or without hard labour. Vehicles may be
seized and sold to defray the expenses and to pay the
penalities?a moiety to go to the informer and the re-
mainder to the poor. There is a clause in this act which
will be of service to the public. It is provided by the
22nd section, that the proprietors of public vehicles, such
as omnibuses, &c., may be summoned to produce their
servants for offences against the provisions of this act;
and unless the owners can give a satisfactory excuse for
their non-appearance, magistrates may issue a fine of
40s. from time to time, until the driver, conductor, or
servant is produced. Penalties inflicted on proprietors
may be recovered from their servants in a summary
manner.

After the firing ceased two grand charges of Cavalry fol-
lowed, the troops formed in square, and marched to the ex-
treme end of the field. Prince Albert, General Blakeney,
Prince George, and the whole staff then galloped over to the
position held by the troops. On the command being given,
the Cavalry formed in squadrons to the right and left, and
the Infantry deployed into line, with the Artillery stationed
in the rear centre. The whole mass of troops then moved
forward to the music of the regimental bands, and when
within full view of the spectators they charged bayonets and
rushed on at double-quick time to the music of that terrible
war cry, half British cheer and half Irish hurrah, and halted
only some 20 yards from the Royal carriage. The colours
of the different regiments were then advanced, and the bands
pealed forth the national anthem. The troops then gave
three tremendous cheers, which were echoed loudly by the
spectators in the vicinity of the Royal carriage, and taken up
by thousands of voices along the lines. The troops then stood
with grounded arms, and the horses were led out and put to
Her Majesty's carriage. This was a signal for a hearty cheer
for the Queen, originating with a group of military officers
and civilian gentry in the inner lines; the cheer was responded
to heartily, and cordially repeated. From the same body
of gentlemen emanated a call for another cheer for his
Royal Highness the Prince Consort and the Royal chil-
dren ; this, too, was warmly responded to. Another
cheer was claimed for the Queen amongst the crowd
of people, and again even more warmly and heartily
given. By this time Her Majesty?s carriage was in
motion, the lines were broken, and a vast crowd as-
sembled round the Royal equipage, following it, and
cheering enthusiastically. At length the Royal carriage
got clear of the crowd, and drove off at a rapid pace to the
Viceregal Lodge, the Queen bowing gracefully in acknow-
ledgment of the repeated evidences of goodwill that greeted
her on all sides. The troops then filed off the ground, and
the vast crowd began to disperse ; but so numerous were the
carriages, horsemen, and pedestrians, that for more than three
hours the Park-road and the streets and quays leading from
it were perfectly impassable.
Shortly after two o?clock his Royal Highness Prince Albert,
accompanied by the Earl of Clarendon, the Marquis of Lans-
downe, Earl Fortescus, and Mr. Corry Connellan, private
secretary to the Lord-Lieutenant, drove into the city from
the Viceregal Lodge for the purpose of visiting some of the
public institutions. The distinguished party first proceeded
to the Royal Irish Academy, a most interesting museum of
Irish antiquities, where they were received by the Rev. Dr.
Todd, the Rev. Mr. Graves, and Dr. Petrie.
His Royal Highness and the noblemen who accompanied
him next drove to the Royal College of Surgeons, Stephen?s-
green.
Four o?clock was appointed for the presentation of an ad-
dress to his Royal Highness Prince Albert by the. members
of the Royal Dublin Society.
His Royal Highness passed to the cattle show of the Royal
Agricultural Improvement Society of Ireland.
On Wednesday an evening party was given at the Royal
Lodge.

The city from an early hour last evening was full
of all the note and preparation incident to the great and im-
portant event of the Queen of the united empire holding her
first drawing-room in the second city of her dominions. So
early as 7 o?clock in the morning carriages began to set down at
the Castle. The scene presented to the eye of the spectator
was one of peculiar brilliancy. Hour after hour the long line
of equipages succeeded each other. It literally appeared as if
there would be no termination to the arrivals, and the blaze of
light from the Castle, and the Royal Exchange, and other
buildings which were illuminated made every object appear
almost as discernible as if it w'ere clear day.
At 12 minutes after 9 o?clock the Queen and Prince Albert,
the Lord-Lieutenant and Countess of Clarendon, entered the
Castle gates, the three state carriages being preceded and
followed by a squadron of the 6th or Enniskillen Dragoons.
Cheers, long, fervent, and earnest, burst forth on every side,
and those who occupied the carriages in the line which was
formed by the Royal cortege joined in the plaudits, one com-
mon feeling of loyalty actuating all classes.
Shortly afterwards Her Majesty, accompanied by his Royal
Highness Prince Albert and the officers of state, entered the
Presence Chamber. Her Majesty was attired in a superb
pink poplin dress, elaborately figured with gold shamrock.
The number present altogether exceeded 1,700.
The fine bands of the 2d Regiment and the 60th Rifles per-
formed a variety of splendid music during the evening.
At a few minutes after 12 o?clock Her Majesty and the
Royal suite took their departure, and the cheers were loud
and long -continued as they proceeded to the Viceregal Lodge.
The people were more than usually peaceable, and the
streets orderly in a remarkable degree, despite the dense
masses which thronged every available space that could be
occupied.
The Queen, after lunching at Carton with the Duke of
Leinster, left the Viceregal Lodge, at five o?clock this day,
for the terminus of the railway, Westland-row, and proceeded
to Kingstown, where Her Majesty and suite embarked for
Belfast.

illumination.
Crowds of pedestrians and lines of carriages traversed the
leading streets. The public buildings looked to quite as
much advantages as on Monday night. A great many pri-
vate houses were also lighted up, particularly those which
had fancy devices already at hand. Many people attributed
this unexpected compliment to the popularity which her
Majesty acquired by her unostentatious journeys through the
streets in the course of the day, without guard or parade of
any kind.
Wednesday.
On Wednesday the Queen and Prince Albert left the Palace
about half-past one o?clock. They were preceded by the
Guard of Honour. Then followed two of the state carriages,
containing the members of the suite. A third, and very
magnificent carriage, contained the Queen, Prince Albert,
the Lord-Lieutenant, and the Countess of Clarendon. As
the royal cortege passed through the gates, the acclamations
of the assembled crowd rent the air, and as it proceeded along
the avenue, the enthusiasm of the people found vent in
similar demonstrations. Her Majesty, in the most courteous
manner, acknowledged these tokens of respect. The royal
party drove at a rapid pace to the castle, in the spacious rooms
of which the Queen was to give audience at a levee to those
who were privileged to obtain presentations. Before the ar-
rival of Her Majesty, the streets in the line towards the Castle
were densely crowded, and never, perhaps, were seen congre-
gated together so great a number of vehicles. They extended
for miles, and in them were seated persons ready dressed for
the levee. Coaches, open and closed cars, and other convey-
ances, were all brought into use, and it was sometimes very
curious to observe the striking contrast between the well-
dressed officers who sat in open cars, and the rough-looking
exterior of the genuine specimen of an Irish car-driver perched
on the box. All, however, seemed too anxious to pay
their personal respects to their Sovereign to notice the des-
cription of ? machine? in which they reached the Castle gates.?
As the Queen alighted from the carriage she appeared in
high spirits, and graciously returned the greetings of the
ladies and gentlemen assembled at the state entrance. Her
Majesty, being conducted to the throne room, assumed her
place. Prince Albert stood upon her left, Sir George Grey
upon her right hand. The lords and ladies of her Majesty?s
household, with the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland and the
Countess of Clarendon, stood behind. The appearance of
her Majesty?s Court at the moment the deputations with ad-
dresses were admitted was brilliant and effective.
Her Majesty wore a rich green tabinct dress, with sham-
rocks embroidered in gold, a blue scarf, and a splendid
bandeau studded with brilliants. Prince Albert was attired
in military costume.
The day?s proceedings commenced with the reception of
addresses from the Corporation of Dublin, the University of
Dublin, the Bishops of the Church of England, certain
Bishops of the Church of Rome, the Presbyterian Synod, the
Quakers of Dublin, Wesleyan Methodists, General Assembly
of Presbyterians, Dublin Protestants, and from various public
bodies of Dublin and other parts of Ireland.
The addresses numbered upwards of fifty. After the pre-
sentation of this enormous number of addresses, the reception
of which might be considered good' work for one day, the
regular business of the levee commenced. The presentations
occupied till six o?clock, shortly after which her Majesty left
the Castle. There was a considerable crowd assembled out-
side, who cheered lustily as the Royal carriages drove off to
the Phoenix Park.
The gas illuminations at the College and several public
institutions and private establishments were continued in the
evening. The night was very mild and fine, and the streets
had the usual throng of spectators, all partaking of the general
joy so universally diffused amongst all classes by the presence
of her Majesty. The fireworks at Kingstown harbour at-
tracted groups of fashionables, and the Royal St. Georg�
Yacht Club accommodated a great many of the elite of the
neighbourhood to witness the joyous display in honour of her
OILS.

Interesting Discovery. ?M. Paul Gervais (says the
Constitutionnel) has just discovered in the upper tertiary
stratum of Montpellier a species of fossil ape, probably
belonging to the Macaque genus. On comparing this
discovery with that of M. Lartet in the Gers, and those
made in the environs of London, it appears that fossil
apes have been discovered in the three principal tertiary
strata of western Europe, that is to say, in every part of
the level of sedimentary earths in which the bones of
mammalia abound. If man had existed at the period
when these strata were deposited, the non-discovery
hitherto of the slightest trace of human skeletons, or
remains attesting human industry, would be very as-
tounding. The discovery of these fossil apes is therefore
an additional indirect proof of the very inferior antiquity
of man on the earth.

WOOL.
LONDON, August 13.?Since Monday last the private contract
market lias been well supplied with both English and Colonial wools,
yet the demand for all descriptions has ruled firm, at very full prices.
The stock of the latter in warehouses is about 12,000 bales. The
imports have amounted to 1,500 bales from Port Philip, 385 from
Hamburgh, 10 from Ostend, aud 321 from Adelaide.
BRADFORD. ?The supply in the market for wool of all kinds is
very abundant, but the prices sought by the growers and dealers are
so very high that the staplers cling to their stocks; being unwilling
to sell at prices at which they cannot replace them. This, with the
good supply in the consumers? hands, accounts for the limited busi-

Beware of the Quack Doctor. ?On Tuesday, a
travelling quack made his appearance in the house of a
publican, not a hundred yards from Wrengate corner,
carpet-bag in hand, and after perusing the countenance
of an elderly female friend of the family, knowingly re-
marked, ? excuse, me, Mrs., but are you not suffering
from liver complaint ?? The good lady, at once acknow-
ledged that she was a martyr to that disease, whereupon
that gallant son of Esculapeus volunteered her cure. She
was ultimately won into consenting by the ? doctor?s?
eloquence, and the professor departed to prepare his pre-
scription. He proceeded as far as the next druggist shop,
where he produced a bottle, and ordered two drams of
Fryer?s balsam, at the same time begging a small lump
of saltpetre. The balsam being duly placed in the bottle
it was filled to the top with the necessary quantity of
water, corked up, and the medicine man departed. For
this he paid the druggist one penny, and had the consum-
mate impudence to charge his patient four shillings and
threepence for the same mixture. He then dived into his
Pandora box, and produced to all appearance, his own
peculiar condiments from the bag, which was nothing
more nor less than the lump of alum saltpetre he had
begged. These he handed over to his new patient, with
a variety of instructions as to how it should be taken, and
what she should eat, drink, and avoid, during the time
she was under his treatment. The old lady listened at-
tentively to his instructions, expressed her thanks, bor-
rowed the money from a friend, and handed it over to
the professor of medicine, who speedily took his departure,
well pleased no doubt, with his success. The patient?s
friend, being more suspicious than herself, went to the
druggist in question, and, of course, the imposition was
speedily discovered before the old lady had left the town.
This trick U so frequently played on foolish people that
we fear a little such dear-bought experience is the only
mode of teaching them the folly of such nostrums. The
tfld proverb of ? live and learn ? ? is true still.
