April, 1898.
The Trustees of the National Art Gallery of New
South Wales have been pleased to undertake this project,
which seeks to obtain a more extended attention to
Australian Art beyond the Colonies, a project which
has been made possible through the liberality of Miss
Eadith Wadkrr, of Concord, Sydney (who placed a
substantial sum towards its consummation at the com-
mand of the Trustees), together with the cordial support
of the Hon. J. Garrard, M.P., Minister of Public
Instruction for New South Wales. The Trustees re-
cognise that the Artists of Australia, availing themselves
of this opportunity, have done their best to represent
their Art, the result being this collection submitted to
the judgment of connoisseurs outside of Australia.
