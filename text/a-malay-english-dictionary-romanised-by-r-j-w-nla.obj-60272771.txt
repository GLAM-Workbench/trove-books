PREFACE
The questions have been put to me,
«How does a man set about writing a
dictionary? And why, oh why, does he ever
come to take up so dull a hobby?* Well, I
grant you that a word list is unimaginative,
unoriginal; that everything in it is taken
from oral or printed sources; that, in a sense,
it is mere plagiarism since it must eschew
all coinage of new words by its author.
Yet, eyen so, it has its pitfalls. Where a
meaning can be proved by its use in
Malay literature references can be given
to the places where it occurs; where the
information comes orally, perhaps from
one or two persons only,—how is a dictionary
to distinguish between what is quite certain
and what is doubtful at best? I am telling
the story of this word list partly to let
a student know whereto rely on a definition
and where to seek more evidence; partly
to pay a debt of honour to my many helpers;
partly also in the hope that other students
of Malay may keep clear of my mistakes.
To begin with, this book is not the
outcome of a hobby; it owes its origin to
conditions in Malaya some forty or fifty
years ago. By the wisdom of Sir Hugh
Low the policy of enforced progress that
was the cause of the Perak War had been
replaced by kindlier methods. Sir Hugh’s
instructions were «to look upon Perak as a
Native State ultimately to be governed by
native Rajas», whom he was «to educate
and advise*). In the State Council he argued
in Malay and had no official majority;
he had to proceed by persuasion only and
by the trust of the Chiefs in his honesty
and single - mindedness. Such a policy
called for a real knowledge of the language
and an understanding of local customs. In
1889 when I joined the Service Sir Hugh
Low had just retired; but Sir Frank Swet-
tenham in Perak, Sir William Maxwell in
Selangor, the Hon. Martin Lister in Negri
Sembilan and Sir Hugh Clifford in Pahang
were all Malay scholars of distinction. For
junior officers a mastery of Malay was a
sine qua non if they meant to seek
promotion in the States.
In those days learners of Malay were
lent three books by the Government:
Favre’s Malay-French Dictionary, Max-
well’s Manual and Swettenham’s Vocabu-
lary. Favre’s work is rich in passages
from Malay literature which he used to
illustrate the meanings of his words a
plan that takes from conciseness to add to
interest. His methods made a great impres-
sion upon me at the time and guided me
in all my early work.
The first man to put me on the higher
paths of Malay study was Sir William
Maxwell. He asked me to serve as Secretary
to the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic
Society during the absence on leave of Mr.
H.N.Ridley, and so brought me into touch
with a number of workers interested in
Malay. One of these, Mr. W.W. Skeat (who
had been with me at Cambridge), suggested
early in 1895 that we should join in the
compilation of a Malay-English dictionary.
The method we followed was this. A very
large number of phrases and idioms—some
15,000 examples were taken from the
Hikayat Abdullah alone were collected
by me and grouped under the words they
illustrated. The draft word-lists so prepared
were then sent to Mr. Skeat to be checked
by oral discusssion with Malays in Selangor,
our hope being that the meaning of each
word would thus be fixed with precision
and authority. For a time all went well;
then our ways parted. Mr. Skeat went on
to specialize in the studies that built up
his interesting book on «Malay Magic»,
while I kept to the humdrum business of
word - collecting.
My troubles began early. Much of the
best Malay literature was unprinted and
could only be studied in manuscript at
places like London, Leyden and Batavia.
Fresh MSS. had to be procured, if possible.
On my paying good prices many texts
came my way. They included two copies
of the Hikayat Koris to which Dr. Rouffaer
had occasion afterwards to draw attention;


one of the Cliekol Waneng Pali (of which
only one other version is known); one of
the Hika;yat Bestamuiam— since printed, but
of which no library then owned a copy;
three of the Sang Samba; four each of the
Parang Puling and Putra Java Pati; and
others. One Panji romance was written on
Javan vegetable parchment; one treatise on
letter - writing contained the forms to use
when inditing a letter to the captain of an
East - Indiaman; most interesting of all to
me was a version of the Hikayat Iskandar
Dzulkarnain containing an account of Alex-
ander’s meeting with the Gymnosophists,
a tale differing hardly at all from the
original Gi'eek of 1800 years before. A
Singapore Malay (Zain-al-abedin bin Kasim)
used to come round every afternoon to
read these MSS. to me, waiting from time
to time to let me put on record any word
or phrase of special interest along with the
book and page where it occurred. In this
way a large number of words were collected
and their meanings verified.
More was soon needed. A comparison
of my word-lists with those of the Dutch
lexicographers—Klinkert, Pijnappel and von
Dewall—made it plain that most Malay
terms lie quite outside literature and have
to be collected from other sources. Bare
lists of words (without meanings) were
then taken from other word-lists as well
as mine and submitted, a word at a time,
to a committee of three Malays from Singa-
pore, Johore and Riau respectively. Leading
questions were shunned; no hint whatever
of a known meaning was given. My Malays
proved modest, well - informed and precise,
admitting ignorance where a word was
strange to them and defining it with
accuracy when they knew it. In this way
they taught me to trust what they said
even when unverified; and to them I owe
nearly all the words marked «Riau»,
«Johore» or «Singapore». When moved to
Penang I got together another such
committee,—representing Kedah, Penang
and Province Wellesley,—with even better
results since these dialects lay beyond the
range of Dutch scholarship. The plan
adopted had worked well—as far as it went.
Let me here record gratefully the names
of my Singapore committee: Zainaiabedin,
Haji Gani, Haji Ali.
In time it became plain that the
average man, however well - informed, is
unable to deal with the long range of
Malay technical terms; if you want to
study the intricacies of fishing you should
go to a fisherman. New methods had to be
tried: visits to workshops and boat - sheds;
the employment of men to draw up detailed
accounts of house - building, rice - planting,
cookery, sorcery, stage-plays, metal-work-
ing and so on. Long lists of new words
were so obtained, along with their defini-
tions, — only to show up the limitations of
this plan also. As soon as my collectors
began giving me the names of the fish
caught by my fishermen fresh trouble
arose. It is useless defining an ikau alu -alu
as «a species of fish»; the fish should be
given its scientific name. In most cases
that means catching the fish and having
it identified by a zoologist; and as Malay
zoological names run into thousands the
vista of work before me seemed endless.
By this time I had been ten years in
Malaya without having taken leave to
Europe; any further delay might imperil
the work already done. The dictionary,
such as it was, had to be sent to the press.
By 1901 the first part of that Diction-
ary had been printed; and I owe it to Mr.
Langham- Carter, who was good enough
to revise the proofs of the second part,
that I was then able to proceed on leave.
On my return the Government sent me
to the Bindings, an unpopular station but
a zoologist’s paradise where something
could be done to fill up the gaps in my
book caused by the lack of scientific names
for my beasts and birds. My attention had
first been drawn to the wealth of this
vocabulary by a Malay headman at Bedoh
on the Singapore coast. This old gentleman
had been picking up shells on the beach
and proving, by questions, that the school -
trained children of that time (and their
teacher also) knew none of the names of
these common objects. After this object-
lesson in the limitations of book - learning
I began to collect shells and to have them
identified at the Raffles Museum. But my


next step was less happy. Taking some
Malay experts to the Museum I got them
to give me the local names for the stuffed
birds in the show-cases while I took down
scientific terms from the labels. These tags
had just been mixed up by a careless
attendant with dire results to the value of
my work. The «label» method has man-
traps for the ignorant.
To Major S.S. Flower, now of Tring,
and to Mr. A.L. Butler (afterwards Game-
Warden in the Sudan) I owe the beginnings
of the little knowledge of zoology that I
possess. To my old friends Dr. Hanitsch,
H.C. Robinson and C. Boden Kloss —su-
ccessively Directors of the Museums Depart-
ment - I am indebted for help extending
over many years. The last two, indeed, did
me the honour of naming a shrew after
me, Tupaia ferrugiuea wilkinsoni;
though this (I am told) was only a tribute
to my mischievous activities as a Secret-
ariat officer. To books, of course, I also
owe much; notably to the invaluable
Encyclopaedia of Netherlands India and to
the works (on fishes) of Mr. Charleton
Maxwell and Doctors Weber and de
Beaufort. In Botany so much has been done
by Messrs H. N. Ridley, I. H. Burkill and
J.C.Watson that I can claim credit for
nothing of my own. My present book
may show a real advance on the earlier
work of 1901 -1903; but much zoological
work is still left for others, notably in
identifying the Malay names of insects,
crustaceans and holothurians.
In 1903 the Government transferred
me to the M day States Service. Contrary
to common belief the Colony is a good
centre for research; its towns bring together
men from every part of the Malay world;
in a district up - country there is a narrower
range. But the Colony can teach the
student nothing about the political side of
Malay life. The States have their Courts,
their pageantry, their old official dignities
and their custom rry laws and systems of
government; all these things were quite
new to me in 1903. It was also my good
fortune to serve for several years in Perak
as Secretary to Sir Ernest Birch, the last
real representative of the Residents of the
school of Sir Hugh Low. Sir Ernest held
the view that a knowledge of native life
and customs was as important to an officer
as a knowledge of the vernacular itself. He
induced the Government to take up the
preparation of a series of «Papers on Malay
Subjects*, of which he made me the general
editor. In carrying out this duty I recall
with gratitude the help given me unstint-
ingly by H.H. the Sultan of Perak, his
Chiefs (notably Raja Haji Yahya) and his
European officers, among whom were
Messrs. R. O. Winstedt, A. Hale, R. C.
Berkeley, G. E. Shaw, C. Boden Kloss, J.
Rigby, A.J. Sturrock, T.S. Adams and C.W.
Harrison. But Sir Ernest’s success was due
largely to his strong and winning personal-
ity. Outside Perak there was less interest
in Malay; and the federation of the States
was beginning already to undermine Sir
Hugh Low’s system by making large and
important branches of the service indepen-
dent of the State Councils. Some «federal
departments* were officered by Europeans
of whom no knowledge of Malay was
expected and were staffed largely by alien
Indians and Ceylonese. This last detail
has always been a real grievance in the
eyes of the people of the country. Of the
working of the system let one story suffice.
In iqio or 1911 I had occasion to invite
the joint-rulers of Sungci Ujong to a
Council-meeting in their own capital. The
letters of invitation were returned to me
by the Tamil - staffed Seremban Post-Office
with the endorsement, «Addressees Un-
known*.
From 1910 to 1915 I served in the
responsible posts of Resident of Negri
Sembilan and Colonial Secretary of the
Straits Settlements; indeed the outbreak
of the Great War found me acting tempo-
rarily as Governor and High Commissioner.
Throughout this period my Malay studies
were of value to me; then in 1915 my
promotion to the Governorship of Sierra
Leone broke all my ties with Malaya.
Only the barren knowledge remained.
Malay is of little interest apart from
the people who speak it; but the academic
path is now the only path open to me.
Not that a dictionary is «literature»; at


best it is a useful book of reference well
worth my doing as it may be of help to
my successors in the Service. Before my
retirement I had worked up my notes into
a second word - list, intending to follow
this up with a detailed account of the
Malays and of their History. Fate ordained
otherwise. In September, 1922, my word-
list (which had been completed on a
visit to Smyrna) had been left lying at that
place along with my notes and books
when the army of Mustapha Kemal Pasha
sacked and burnt the town. After the
Mudania Armistice I hurried to Smyrna
and (thanks to its Governor, Abdul-Khalik
Bey), was able to save what was left of my
material. Of my MSS. about three - fourths
were missing; lost books, of course, could
be replaced. I took the salvage to Mytilene
hoping that the making of peace would let
me resume my search. In this I was balked
by long-drawn bargaining at Lausanne;
but in the meantime I had taken up
my work once more to lessen the dullness
of waiting.
My Natural History notes had mostly
been spared. So had an interleaved copy
of my older work with comments by Mr.
W.L. Conlay (late Commissioner of Police,
F.M.S.) and by M. Tugault, formerly
Professor of Malay at the Paris School of
Eastern Languages. Much priceless matter
given me by Sir Hugh Clifford had
perished, but part of it had been embodied
in Letters H. I. J. K. S. that had sur-
vived. Many Malay texts had been
published since 1903; much research had
appeared especially in Dutch publications.
Dr. Ritter von Zach, formerly Austro-
Hungarian Consul at Singapore, aided
me with a long list of new Batavia
words; Dr. Winstedt and Mr. A. W.
Hamilton, workers in the same field as
myself, helped me with fresh material and
by checking what I had to send them.
Yet, when all is said, Mytilene is a poor
centre for Malay studies. My only local
helper has been my wife who has done
all she can for fifteen years to make
this book a success: looking up references,
dictating passages and even typing it all
from end to end when typists could not be
got. The monotony and drudgery of such
work make it all the kindlier. Printing
also was hard in a place where no
compositor knows English, much less
Malay; I was lucky to find in Mr. Salavo-
poulos a printer trained elsewhere and
equal to his task. In short, I am doubtful
whether my keeping on with this word-
list is to be called diligence or obstinacy,
but, by now, the work is nearly over.
In West Africa I heard it said that
a man who learnt a foreign tongue
«lowered himself to the level of those who
spoke it». If the study of Malay could
teach a student the courtesy and
kindliness of the Malay himself it would
be well worth taking up; all that it has
done for me is to give me a heart - felt
liking and a real admiration for the
people whom I served so long and (if
this book can be looked upon as work
for Malaya) whom I am glad still to serve.

abis, = habis (done, finished).
abjad. Ar. Cabalistic alphabet; alphabet arranged
according to the numerical values of the
letters and used either for memorizing dates
or (more commonly) for purposes of divination
(tilek a.).
[The sequence of the letter-values is really
that of the old Aramaic (and Hebrew) alphabet.
It is memorized by the use of group-words:
abjad (a, b, j, d), hawwaz (h, w, z), etc.
From the first of these aids to memory the
cabalistic alphabet gets its name. Six group-
words or twenty-two letters in all exhaust the
Aramaic alphabet and take us (in units, then
in tens and then in hundreds) to 400.
Then follow two group-words made up ot
six Arabic letters not found in Aramaic; these
take us to 1000. Non-Arabic letters found in
Malay are included in the abjad as multiples
of a thousand but are not combined into
group-words.
The abjad can be used to give a date.
Thus the Hikayat Bugis (p. 76) coins the
word walakigh to give G 130 +lOO + lOOOz:
1136 A. H. as the date of Daeng Perani’s
death. Or, for divination purposes, take the
numerical values of the letters making up
the names of a bridal pair. Add them up.
Divide by twelve; and the balance, if any,
will give the-sign of the zodiac affecting the
fortunes of the wedding. Divide by seven for
the kbtika tujoh. Divide by five, and we
can apply the ketika lima. Cf. Ht. Angg.
104. See also J. M. A. S. i 283 for details of
use of the abjad.

themselves; see alif, ba, ta, etc.]

and religious law were equally in force (adat
yang kawi, shara’ yang lazim); in practice
they often overlapped;
(xi) loosely, all law; e. g. a. kitab Allah
(law of the Koran), Mai. Sayings 26).
[The common law of Minangkabau is based
on immemorial tradition and is embodied in
old saws (kata p6saka, kata saka, p6rbilan-


gan adat) down from a time when
•God was not yet known as Allah nor Moha-
med as his Prophet* (Allah belum berna-
nia Allah, Muhammad belum bernama na-
bi). But jurists affect to believe that it was
all thought out by one man, a Dato’ Perpa-
teh Pinang Sa-batang, and that after much
discussion it met with general acceptance and
that the whole population swore perpetual
allegiance to it, for themselves and their
descendants, by oath on the besi kawi or
bisa kawi. The scene of these events was
the country about Batipoh, Priangan and
Padang Panjang.

Bruas or Gangga Negara.]

[For information about the batek process
see Rouffaer’s Batik-kunst and the
third volume of Jasper’s Inlandsche
Kunst - nij verheid. The process is based
on the fact that waxed cloth does not absorb
dye. Patterns in molten wax are stamped
on cloth with printing - blocks (chanting
chap), or drawn on it with a stylus (chant-
ing); the cloth is then steeped in a dye-vat
and the waxed portions stand out undyed
against a background of colour. The process
is, of course, much elaborated.
In Java itself batek cloths may be classed
according to the pattern or according to the
basic colour (natar, latar), e. g. b. bang
(red). The patterns are innumerable but
those best known in Malaya are the perang
rosak, limaran and gerengseng wayang.]

The Hindu period introduced a knowledge
of the signs of the Zodiac at all events; but
the old names of these signs have been
superseded (Mai.) by their Arabic names.
The later Malays obtained most of their
astronomy from the Arabs for purposes of
divination, viz. (i) the names of the seven
ruling heavenly bodies (raja b., b. tujoh),
viz. the Sun (shamsu), the Moon (kamar),
Mercury (b. utarid), Venus (b. zuhrah, b.
juara, b. k6jora), Mars (b. marlkh), Jupiter
b. inushtari) and Saturn (b. zuhal); and (ii)
the names of the signs of the Zodiac (b. dua-
belas), for which —with their astrological
associations —see akrab, asad, delu, hamal,
hut, jauza, jadi, kaus, mizan, sartan,
sunbulat, thaur.
According to this Arab astronomy (Host.
Sal. i 47 to 51) the stars are made of various
«kinds of gems resembling lamps® (daripada
jenis nianikam sopSrti kandil); «their size
is that of the greatest mountains of the
earth® (bosar - nya sfiperti bukit yang
mahabfisar dalam dunia); and they are of
three classes (i) those always visible, (ii)
those that rise and set; and (iii) those that
wander (planets).
In poetry the «moon in a circle of stars®
is a simile for a glorious sight or a bevy of
beauty; see bulan and cf. awan bortepok,

An account of the moon is given in the
Bostan (Bost. Sal. i 46, 47), It is granted
that the moon shines with the sun’s
reflected light (chahaya b. itu daripada
chahaya matahari), Bost. Sal. i 50; but
its size is put variously at 40 parasangs
(about 150 miles), the earth’s size, and 2G
times the size of the earth. The position of
the moon in the sky for each night of the
lunar month is defined by its thirty resting-
places or mansions (manazil, q. v.). Its
waxing and waning are explained by its
being permitted to do obeisance (sujud) to
God once a month; it expands at the
prospect and pines away in regret after the
obeisance is done. Like the sun it is destined
to perish in flames at the Judgment Day.
Some of the Malay months have popular
names, viz.;
(i) muharram,=b. sura, b. api, b. hasan-

B. is used of wrapping a kerchief round

[Main ch. is so called from the cards
(not more than seven) that a player may
draw (chabut) from the pack. His aim is
to get a hand worth 21 points or (if court -
cards are included in the pack) 31 points.
This latter form is the more popular and
gives the game the alternative name of
main tiga puloh satu. The players begin
by each drawing two «kecl» cards (daun
lunas) or foundations for their hands; the
number drawn afterwards depends on the
value of the lunas. If a player fails to rise
to 31 points after drawing all the seven
cards allowed he is beaten and «enters the
pack® (maeok daun). If he gets too many
he is also beaten, «dead» (mati) or «in the
plate® (masok piring). To get exactly 31 is
to «hit the bull’s eye» (masok mata). But
players who approach 31 and have still cards
to draw may elect to pass and stand on
what they have. If they pass on 29 or 30
points and stand a good chance of winning,
it is belit bfisar. On less it is bclit kechil.

Chgki. [Ch. chit - k i] «Chicky», a name given
to;
(i) a certain type of Chinese playing card
(daun ch.) known to Chinese as peh-pai
and ilid. in detail, May. pi. xvi;
(ii) a certain game also known as main
tan, (Pen.) main chochot, or (Java) main
yu played with this type of card.
[The term chfiki comes from the fact
that in this game the cards are turned up
one at a time (Ch. chit - k i = Mai. sa -
helai). The game is a sort of bluffless poker,
success going to the player who first gets
a «full hand* (tan) made up of three of
one suit, two of a second and two of a
third, one of these sets being made up of
cards of the same denomination as well as
of the same suit.
The full playing pack (sa - kepala daun
ch). is made up of four similar packs or
sets of thirty cards each. Each of these sets
contains:
(i) one long suit (yu) of six denominations;
(ii) eight short suits of throe denomina-
tions each. These last are known by the
names of the Hok - kien numerals from two
to nine (ji, sa, si, go, lak, chit, (chhit),
poll, kau). For the long suit denominations
see yu.
The short suit denominations are diffe-
rentiated as ban or lichin (which has a
Chinese character distinguishing it), tian or
rintek (with circles) and pia (plain). Thus
the ban card in the suit sa is known as sa -
ban. But varying local names are also given
by Malays and Javanese to most of these
cards and suits.
After shuffling (banchoh daun ch.) the
dealer deals out (mdmbahagi daun ch.,
ni Mubfiri daun ch.) nine cards to the first
player and eight to each of the others. The
first player then discards and exposes one
of his nine cards. The second player turns
up and exposes one of the pack - cards. He
is then allowed either to pass or to discard
and expose one of his own cards and take
either the first player’s discard or his own
turn -up from the pack. The third player
then turns up a card and has a similar
choice. So the game goes on till one of the
players acquires his tan or full hand.
Names for the short suits are: ji = l6kok
= pangkah; sa = aerong; si = lebai =
kepala bulat; go = babi = mata dua; lak
= gapet = kapit; chit; peh = mata satu;
kau = anjing. Examples of local names for
individual cards are: lak - tiau = (Pen.) lak-
sdmambu, = (Java) lak - banibu; sa - ban
= (Sel.) jam in, = (Pah.) serong jaruni.]

Chfitßria. [Skr. kshatriya] Member of the second
(or warrior) caste. In India this is also the
princely caste. In Bali the caste survives
as ksatria (with various subdivisions); its
members are styled dewa; three Balinese
princely houses belong to it, the others
being of the lower Vaisya caste. In Suma-
tra the word itself is obsolete; but what it
represents may survive in the term hulu-
balang (q. v.) when used as a hereditary
title. In early Moslem days (Mai.) it is
recorded of a Chief that he was of «khshatria»
descent (asal - uya choteria, Mai. Annals
8G); but later on we find the Hang Tuah
(137, 163) treating kastfiria and chbtoria
as distinct titles. The term is now quite
obsolete. In Java the two great princely
houses are probably of Vaisya origin. In one
passage (Dar. Chandu 9) choteria is used to
describe a medieval knight.

[The true kain chindai is a silk cloth five

wide with iringed or tasselled ends. Its
distinctive features are: (i) its extremely fine
texture in theory it should pass through
a finger - ring; and (ii) its handsome and
bold reticulate pattern (ch. jantan). It was
worn as a sash by warriors, gave them some
protection from its many folds, and was even
supposed on occasions to turn into a python
and fight for its wearer. When locally made
the cloth was of thicker texture and less
bold in design (ch. botina, ch. sari); it was
prescribed by etiquette as material for trousers
(chelana) in Java. Cloths made in the
Peninsula by the chindai process are known
ns kain liman or kain limar; kain ch. is

Narada (Jay. Pati); or (iii) by prayers and
formulae (menchita beryangyang, Raj.
Muda 112). In this last passage the procedure
suggests telepathy; a prince prayed that his
brother might think of him and so be induced
to set out in search of him. This use of

With men the shaving of the head is almost

to shave his head when his wife is expecting
a child. Hair on the face, usually scanty, is
not shaved but pulled out by pincers. For
the importance attached to the shaving of

In its contracted form puny a this woid
is used very commonly in Bazaar Malay to
form a genitive, e. g. Sahara pnnya (my’,
dia pnnya (his). This is regarded as faulty

Chinese grammar) of using pnnya to create
an adjective, e. g. baik pnnya ornng for
orang baik.

Note also the passage (Mai. Annals 210,
referred to s. v. awang) where a bendahara
changes the pronoun from awang to fingkau
on finding that he is speaking to a slave.
In Java this unceremonious n go k o - speech
(n go k o = engkau) is almost a language of
its own as most expressions have a courtly
(krama) and a common (n g o k o) form.
In colloquial Malay doubtless because
of its semi-contemptuous character fingkau
has been superseded in use by local terms
such as (Ked.) hang, (Pk.) mika, (Pat.,
Kel.) mu, (Joh.) awak, (E. Sum.) dikau,
(Min.) ang, angkau, (Batav.) koe, though
still met with in Sel., Setul and Malacca.

11. = angkong (court - card).
gngku. A title of high rank; prince. In Perak;
a form of address to princes of the royal
house other than the Sultan, Raja Muda
and Bendahara who are tuanku. So also a
queen of royal birth is ongku puan; of non-
royal, tengku puan. Neither engku or teng-
ku appear as titles in the Malay Annals
and it is uncertain how and whether they
were used by the old Malacca kings. At the
fall of the dynasty (about A. D. 1700) the
sons of the new Sultan (the former bbndahara)
styled themselves tengku instead of raja,
and his near relations were styled engku
or die’ engku: cf.: the’ engku (lit. Bugis
SG); 6ngku temenggong and ongku enche’
ayu (lit. Bugis 06); cf. also the treaty
of the 17ih April 1734 and the letter
of Sultan Sulaiinan and his brother Engku
Raja Indera Bongsu (Netscher, Appx. xxix).
Ihe nett result of these changes was to
exalt the title of tfingku as compared with
others. From this time tSngku was the title
borne by princes of the Daik and Trengganu
houses; the descendants ot the Bugis Tam-
ilian Muda were styled raja and addressed
as engku; the descendants of the other
families were styled engku. At a later date
the Bendahara of Pahang and the Temenggong
of Johore began to be styled Raja Bendahara
and Raja Temenggong, their sons by women
of high rank che’ engku and by women of
low rank che’ wan. In recent years these
two magnates have become Sultans and their
sons are styled tengku.

at Padang it means ‘grandfather®; cf. also
bugku jaksa (Malay magistrate), Waj. Hak.

[This system is almost confined to the

in most cases to disputed successions. If A.
and B. both claimed a title, B. (the weaker)
might end h}' waiving his rights for the
moment on condition that he or his heirs
got the title at the next vacancy. But there
is a notable giliran outside Negri Sembilan
in the case of the title of Da to’ Penglima
Kinta in Perak; and, at one time, there
were many who said that the Perak Sultanate
itself was subject to a giliran. Sultan Idris
denied this but made some concession to it
by arguing that his eldest son, Raja Abduljalil,
could claim to represent the family of Sultan
Yusuf (his maternal grandfather) which under
the giliran would have the next claim to the
throne].

demons (b. butan, b. riniba, b. dfinai, b.
belukar, b. songkai); mountain spirits (b.
gunong); evil spirits of the waters (b. aver,
b. laut, b. sungai, h. bidai, gulong bidai,
balong bidai);
(ii) demons tied to special spots or
tute'ary spirits of freaks of nature (b.
puaka), e. g , of huge trees (h. pokok);
waterfalls (h. banclan); oil - springs (li.
ininyak);
(iii) demons behind natural phenomena,
such as: echoes |h. • hantuan); will o’the
wisps (h. joranibang); meteors (h. panah
Ranjuna); spirits of the storm (h. angin,
h. ribut); sunset - clouds of weird shape or
colour (h. dagok, h. inatnbang);
(iv) invisible elves wandering about the
earth (h. bunian, h, siluman, h. lemboyan,
h. kelembaian);
(v) evil spirits associated with definite
diseases (h. penyakit) such as small - pox
(h. ibu pamenan) or shooting internal pains
(h. senggirek);
(vi) vengeful ghosts of the dead, e. g.: of
the murdered (h. niati di - bunoh); the
perjured dead (kamolo’, h. bangkit, h. bung-
kua, h. golok, h. jerongkong, h. koohong,
h. knbur); women dead in childbed (h. pun-
tianak); and unwanted children (h. kang-
kong ngoang - ngeang);
(vii) ghost - birds, harpies or vampires (li.
langsuyar, bnrong h.);
(viii) discarded divinities of older faiths,
e. g.: the spectre huntsman (h. pemburu,
h. raya, h. tinggi, h. dongak, h. longgak,
b. lengak. li. longgak); Kala or black
divinity (h. hitam, awang hitani); and
Hanuman (h. doman);
(ix) the tiger - spirit attached to a sorcerer
(h. belian, h. loyang);
(x) familiar spirits generally (h. jamuan,
h. anjong. h. pusaka, h. jinjangan, h, jadi -
jadian, h. berjinjang);
(xi) the magician’s head as a familiar
spirit (h. pfmanggalan; Ked. h. tftngge-
long, N. S. h. manjangan, h. manyangan.
Sum. h. pelSsit); and
(xii) familiar spirits of indefinite local
character (li. bajang, h. polong, h. pelesit}.
Disease, esp. madness, is attributed to
evil spirits (kena h.); its intensity varies
with the closeness of contact with the ghost.
Whence: kena pnputan h., kena imbasan
h. (to be affected only by a ghost’s aura):
k6na lintasan h. (to be diseased because
you have gone where a ghost has crossed
your path); kena k6tSguran bantu (to be
the worse for being accosted by a ghost).
More serious is a ghost’s attack or possession


of his victim (di-haru h., di - asoh h., di-
solap h., di-rasok h.) causing paroxysmal
madness, raving madness or death. Elves
are believed to cause disordered hair or «elf-
locks* (rambut di-sugun h., rambut di-
jalin kelfimbai). Spirit - possession is believed
also to explain a passion for dancing or
certain games where the player forgets
his surroundings (h. nienari, h. gamboh, h.
rusa, It. musang).
Ghosts are credited by Malays with
planting wild varieties of fruit; e. g., pisang
h. would mean «wild banana*. The word is
therefore common in Malay botanical names.
Malay ghosts are «white*, «red» or «black»;
the black are the worst.
With its malignant and secret associations
h. has become a term of abuse and is applied
to: police informers (h., puma, ainpania,
tahua); supposed scenes of secret devilry
like masonic lodges (ruraah h., Batav. ru-
inah setan); owls as ill-omened birds (bu-
rong h ); nautilus or sea - devil shells (siput
h. laut); sorcerers (pawang h.); sorcerers’
seances (berhautu, main puteri, Orang
Laut menobat); and the longest finger of
the hand (jari h.) which became so when
the devil stuck to it as long as he could
while trying to carry off Adam.
In incantations it is thought unwise to
call an evil spirit bantu. The word has evil
associations. The -word jin is used as being
politer.

Mohammed went to the jin as God’s Apostle
(pfisuroh) and preached Islam to them as he
did to mankind (Bost. Sal. i 31), whereupon
some jin refused to listen and are evil and
infidel genii (j. kafir) while others accepted
his preaching and are good genii (j. islam).
But later Islam sometimes regards them as
associated with the smokeless fires of Hell
and as the offspring of Iblis and Marijah;
more charitable writers say that the shaitan
are the children of Iblis while the jin are
the sous of Jan.]

jolok occurs occasionally as a term of

He was expected to reconcile religion and
custom and to see that religious services
were conducted in a seemly manner. Minang-
kahau custom limited him to religious issues
and expected the first qualification only (jika
ta’ - banyak kitnb di - bacha tiada sab ni6n-
jadi kadzi). In modern Perak he adjudicates
on the validity of marriages and divorces and
on the distribution of intestate estates;
enforces mosque attendance; deals with the
distribution of pitrah and zakat; and regulates
the carrying out of religious observances. His
position is one of some difficulty as laws are
hard to enforce by moral suasion; while the
granting of licences to receive charity or of
certificates of competence to slaughter cattle
in the approved ritual way are examples of
powers that can create valuable monopolies
and lead to serious abuse.]

kSmban (which is being neatly dressed in

Malaya (kSmban t6rbuka k£lihatan pung-

array he stopped to wash a half - eaten fish
(ikan sa-belah, sisa nabi==sole) in a spring;
the fish came to life and swam away. Kh.
drank the water but kept his discovery to
himself. Thus he became immortal; and as
his religion was the shareat nabi Ibrahim
(Mai. Annals) he is immortalized as«Ahasuerus»,
the Wandering Jew. He is associated by
Moslems with the sea; and an account of
his meeting with the Malay hero Hang Tuah
is given (Hg. Tuah 508).
Another account says that Khidzir was

who washed the fish. In any case St. George

really Andreas].
