“ THE TWO ORPHANS.”
The revival of “ The Two Orphans ”
a.t Her Majesty’s Theatre on Saturday
drew a crowded popular audience, and
the applause bore witness alike to the
general excellence of the representation
and to the sterling worth of the emotio-
nal drama. Visitors to Her Majesty’s
will find that Mr. George Rignold, whilst
retaining the six-act form, has reduced
the Linieres to the merest shadows,
and by keeping the main story well in
view has greatly quickened the action,
Indeed, praise is due for the smartness of
the stage management on Saturday,
seeing that the six acts, with their
many changes, were rapidly rendered
in the space of three hours, so that it
was not 11 when the audience finally left
the theatre. ... 11 The Two Orp-
hans,” which was adequately staged
throughout, was received with a respon-
sive cordiality which augurs well for its
success during its run at Her Majesty’s.

iiich he defined as walking out with a
young woman, to see if the dispositions
would suit each other, and to see whether
at the right time, anything would come
of it.”
The remark of a contemporary, “ that
many of our successful lawyers com-
menced life as preachers,” is gracefully
corrected by one of the legal gentlemen
referred to, who begs leave to state that
he began life as an infant.
Through the blinding rain walked a penniless
tramp,
And he said to himself with a sigh,
“ ’Tis hard enough to be soaking wet,
Without being, so infernally dry.”
The patron of a cheap eating-house,
who complained that they now gave him
one potato with his meat, whereas they
formerly gave him two, was mollified
by the waiter’s explanation, that the
last lot of potatoes they purchased was
so bad that no gentleman could eat
more than one of them.
The moral effect of being well-dressed
was shown in the answer of a child who
was asked why she wasn’t as good as a
little girl of her acquaintance. “ Per-
haps I should be quite as good,” she
answered, “ if my dress had little pink
bows all over it.”
The only witness of geographical
knowledge the Shah has in his palace at
Teheran is a 12-inch globe, upon which
the parts of the world are set out in
jewels of various colours —England with
rubies, India with diamonds, and the
sea with emeralds.
“ Why, Uncle Dewlittle, how dew you
dew ? Come in and rest a little while,
dew. How does Hannah dew, and what
is she dewing ? Dew tell us all the
news. Come, dew sit down to the table
and dew as we dew ; help yourself; d&w
talk now, and dew not make me dew all
the talking, for I sha’n’t dew it. Now
dew dew something, dew.”
Mother (to suitor) : “ No, I can never
give you my daughter. I have quite
made up my mind.” Suitor: “ Then
I am doubly disappointed. 1 vowed
that I would have a lovely wife and a
young-looking mother-in-law.” Mother:
“ Well —er —you may call again, I may
change my mind.”
A sleepy fellow was reproved for ly-
ing in bed so late in the morning, when
he replied that he was obliged to do it
to invent excuses for not getting up.
A young lady of New York, who is
partially deaf, is in the habit of saying
‘ Yes ” to everything when a gentleman
is talking to her, for fear he might pro-
pose to her and she did not hear it.
An Unsolved Mystery. Conlon:
“ Where did you get that broken nose
and yer eye cut ? ” Dolan : “ It was from
meeting O’Flannigan wid me girrul.”
Conlon : “ Did yez lick him ? ” Dolan :
“ Well that’s bin a matter av puzzlement
to me from then till now. Yez see, whin
I cem to me sinses, O’Flanigan wuz gone,
an’ to this minut I don’t know which
wan av us g’ot licked.”
Mrs Callahan ; “ I want to get a pair
of shoes for the little boy.” Shopman:
“ French kid? ” Mrs Callahan (indig-
natly) : “ Indade not,' He’s my own son
—born and bred in Dundalk, ye spal-
peen !”
An Alabama editor mildly alludes to
his rival as “ a reservoir of falsehood
and an aqueduct of mendacity.”
In order to keep up with the progress
of the age, Time is said to have aban-
doned the scythe and hour-glass and
purchased a mowing-machirm and a
watch.
“ I go through my work,” reprovingly
said the needle to the idle boy. —“ But
not till you’re pushed through,” triump-
hantly replied the boy to the needle.
Mistress : I don’t want you to have so
much company. You have more callers
in a day than I have in a week.” Domes-
tic : “ Well, mum, perhaps if you’d tried

Unexpected.—A German settler in
Ohio, found guilty of selling liquor con-
trary to law, and sentenced to be im-
prisoned in the county gaol for thirty
days, protested as follows :—“ Chail
Go to chail ! Me go to chail! But I can’t
go ! Dere’s my piziness,—my pakery.
Who bakes my bread when I bqn gone ?”
Then casting his eyes about the court,
appealingly, they fell upon jbhe good-
natured face of jolly Chris Ellwaner, a
fellow-countryman, who had no “ pizi-
ness,” and forthwith a brilliant idea
occurred to him. Turning to the judge,
he said, in sober earnest, “ Dere’s Chris
Ellwaner ! He’s got nothing to do ; send
him !”
“ It is a great misery,” says La Bru-
yere, “to have neither enough wit to
talk well, nor enough judgment to keep
quiet.” But the misery is oftenest the
experience of the other fellows.
Two young carpenters, named respec-
tively Robert Brown and Thomas Jones,
were very fond of dropping into Mr.
Smith’s parlour and spending an hour
or two with his only daughter Mary.
One evening, when Brown and Mary
had discussed almost every topic, Brown
suddenly, in his sweetest tones, struck
out as follows : —“ Do you think, Mary,
you could leave father and mother, and
this pleasant home, with all its ease and
comforts, and emigrate to the Far West
with a young carpenter, who has but
little besides his strong hands to depend
upon, and with him search out a new
home which should be your joint duty
to beautify, and make delightful and
happy like this ?” Dropping her head
softly on his shoulders, she whispered
—“ I think I could, Robert.” “ Well,”
said he, “ there’s Tom Jones, who’s
going to emigrate, and wants to get a
wife; I’ll mention it to him.”

Harold, you love another.”
An editor wrote a leading article on
the fair sex, ■in the course of which he
said, “ Girls of seventeen or eighteen are
fond of beaux.” When the paper was
issued, he was rather shocked to discover
that an unfortunate typographical error
had made him say, “ Girls of seventeen
or eighteen are fond of beans.”
Woman may be a conundrum, a puzzle,
but the world will never give her up.
The chief attractions about a miser is
his charming heirs.
Professor Lessing was occasionally so
absent-minded that he knocked at his
own door, when the servant, not recog-
nising her master, looked out of the
window, and said, “ The Professor is
not at home.”-—“Oh, very well,,’ replied
Lessing, composedly walking away, “ I
will call again.”
A young couple were sitting together
in a romantic spot, with birds and flow-
ers about them, when the following dia-
logue ensued : —“ My dear, if the sacri-
fice of my life would* please thee, most
gladly would I lay it at thy feet.’
“ Oh, sir, you are too kind ! But it just
reminds me that X wish you d leave off
using tobacco.” —“ Can t think of it.
It’s a habit to which I am wedded.”—
“ Very well, sir ; since this is the way
you lay down your life for me, and as
you are already wedded to tobacco, Xll
take good care you are never wedded to
me, as it would be bigamy.”
“If there is one time more than ano-
ther,” says an experienced married man,
“ when a woman should be left entirely
alone, it is when a line full of clothes
comes down in the mud.”

He sang the “ Song of the Press.”
Write, write, write.
Till his head, begins to swim,
And write, write, write.
Till he achs in every limb.
Ink, paper, and pens,
Pens, paper, and ink.
And a thirst that is burning his glottis out — |
But his screw won’t run to a drink.
Oh ! men with sweethearts who read,
Oh ! mothers-in-law and wives,
It isn’t the papers you eagerly take,
But human editors’ lives,
Write, write, write,
Till he really can’t see any more.
And his head sinks ’low on the desk below
With a loud and sonorous snore.
Write, write, write,
From early morn till late,
And write, write write,
At a supernatural rate.
It’s oh, to be out on the main !
Away on the sea for a blow,
But there’ll he no fun in his weary life
Till he’s sent where all editors go.
With fingers weary and thin,
With eyelids heavy and red,
The editor sat in his high-backed chair
When he ought to have been in bed.
Write, write, write,
’Mid ink, and paste, and mess,

Would that its tones had been gay and light!
