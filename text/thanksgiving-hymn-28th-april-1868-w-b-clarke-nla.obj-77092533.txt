THANKSGIVING HYMN.,
28th April, 1868.
Thou, who, in the time of sadness,
Sendest from Thy throne above
Consolation, peace and gladness,
Tokens of redeeming love :
Thou, who in the night of sorrow.
When no human aid is seen,
Joy reservest for the morrow.
Thus, we pray Thee, bless our Queen.
Thou, whose Spirit ever blesses
All who in Thy grace abide.
And amidst their deep distresses
Countless mercies dost provide
Hear us, when to-day we gather
W here our concourse oft hath been ;
Hear us 0 Almighty Father,
Guide thy Church, and guard our Queen !
For, O Lord, in retrospection
Of the wonders of Thy hand,
Comes the grateful recollection
Of Thy goodness to this land
How Thy presence in his danger
Sheltered, midst that troubled scene,
Him the trusting, youthful stranger.
Scion of our rightful Queen.
Hence, each loyal heart rejoices
That o?er him Thy shield was castj
Hence, to-day we lift our voices.
Thankful for the peril past;
Hence, we bend in adoration
With glad souls and minds serene,
Mingling with congratulation
Intercessions for our Queen.
