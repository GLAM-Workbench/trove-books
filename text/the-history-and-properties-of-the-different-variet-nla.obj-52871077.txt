PREFACE.
The information contained in the following pages has
been derived almost wholly from my own analyses and
from practical experience of the effects of various kinds
of guano used in different parts of the country.
There has long been a necessity, not only for farmers,
but for manure manufacturers and dealers in manure, to
have some better acquaintance with the differences that
exist in that class of manures known as guanos.
In the following pages will be found analyses of all
the different varieties of guano, which, so far as I have
been able to ascertain, have during the last eight or ten
years been imported into this country.
In the present work it is intended to treat only of the
nature and properties of natural guanos ; we propose
at a future period to give a history of the origin and
progress of the artificial manures manufactured and used
in this country.

THE
HISTORY AND PROPERTIES
OF
NATURAL GUANOS.
NATURE OF PLANTS AND MANURES.
Plants derive the elements of which they are composed,
some portion from the earth, some portion from the air,
and from the water or rain, which falls from the atmo-
sphere. Soils naturally differ much in their power of fur-
nishing the constituents of plants, and those vegetables
which will grow luxuriantly in a soil which contains a
large amount of available mineral and organic elements
will not attain perfection in one which contains a
smaller amount of these substances. Nature, however,
has provided us with plants of different habits; so that,
whatever the diversity of soils, we find a natural variety
of plants adapted to each.
It is estimated that botanists are' acquainted with at
least 150,000 species of plants; some adapted to live
in arctic or temperate regions, others in the torrid zone;
but each one requiring certain conditions of soil and cli-
mate for its full and proper development.
The food of man is derived from a few species of plants,
chiefly the grasses. All soils are not naturally adapted
to the requirements of man. For instance, we hear of
no district where wheat grows as a natural plant. It is
not indigenous in any country, and in no climate will it
arrive at perfection without the assistance of man.
Hence, the art of agriculture arises as the result of a
constant struggle between the powers of Nature, which
would clothe our fields with natural plants, and the ne-
cessities of man, who requires for his sustenance the
growth of a few species only. A proper system of
agriculture must therefore consist in a knowledge of
the means of altering the ordinary condition of soils,
and adapting them for the growth of certain plants


required for the use of man, and of those which aie
necessary for the sustenance of his flocks and herds.
Prom remote antiquity until the present century, the
art of agriculture had made but little advancement in
its mechanical or scientific operations. It had long been
ascertained that certain forms of vegetable and animal
matter might be used with success for the reproduction
of various forms of animal and vegetable life: but the
present century inaugurated the science of agriculture;
and it was reserved for the.chemists of modern times to
determine the nature of the elements of vegetables, and
to ascertain their relative value.
It is well known that few farms have the power of
producing a sufficient amount of animal and vegetable mat-
ter, as manure, to bring out their full capabilities.
In order to cultivate land profitably, therefore, extra-
neous substances must necessarily be imported on to the
farm; and the introduction of manures, such as guanos
and superphosphates of lime, has undoubtedly been of
immense service to British agriculture.
By a careful examination of the component parts of
those manures which in practice have been found most
conducive to the luxuriant growth of vegetable life, we
are now in a position to estimate their commercial and
agricultural value.
Before entering fully into a description of the various
Guanos, I wish to give a short account of the nature and
properties of those substances which practice and science
have proved to be essential elements of good manures.
SUBSTANCES FOUND IN MANURES.
The object of this work is not purely scientific ; it has
been written for the purpose of affording useful infor-
mation for practical men. It is not intended to enter
into a minute examination of every individual element, or
combination of elements, to be found in manure; our
observations, therefore, will be confined to the more im-
portant constituents.
The substances found in plants and in manure may be
classed in two great divisions —
1. Inorganic or Mineral Matters, which are
chiefly or entirely derived from the earth.


2. Organic or Aerial Matters, which are chiefly,
and in some cases eiftirely, derived from the air.
I.—INORGANIC ELEMENTS.
The more important mineral elements are—
Silica. Soda.
Lime. Common Salt.
Magnesia. Phosphoric Acid.
Potash. Sulphuric Acid.
The inorganic elements are nearly all derived from the
soil; though, in the vicinity of sea coasts, or by the action
of violent winds, a very considerable amount of common
salt finds its way from the sea to the land.
Silica.
Silica exists in two forms : one very insoluble, as in
common sand and quartz. The other, more easily soluble,
is found in combination with various substances in dif-
ferent rocks and soils.
Silica is found in abundance in the stems of grasses,
particularly in the straw of wheat, oats, and barley.
Prom all the experiments hitherto tried, it appears that
soils naturally furnish plants with a full supply of this sub-
stance. No benefit has attended its application in a solu-
ble form as a manure. Its presence in quantity in guano
is always a distinctive sign of adulteration or impurity.
Lime and Magnesia.
Lime and magnesia are termed alkaline earths, and are
both pretty generally known.
Lime, as carbonate of lime, is found in common chalk
and limestones, and in gypsum as sulphate of lime. In
bones it exists as phosphate of lime.
Magnesia is generally associated with lime, in a greater
or less degree.
Soils generally contain a sufficient amount of lime and
magnesia for the use of plants. When this is not the
case, limeing or marling will supply the deficiency.
Potash, Soda, and Common Salt.
Potash and soda are termed alkalies. They are found in
the ashesof all plants, butvaryin amount in different species.
Common salt is chemically called chloride of sodium.
The soda of commerce is prepared from common salt.


Potash is prepared by washing the ashes of plants, and
boiling down the ley.
With few exceptions, soils appear generally to furnish
to plants as much of these substances as they require.
Common salt, however, is very often found useful in
strengthening the straw of wheat, oats, and barley, when
weak and inclined to fall. It is also good for mangel-wurzel.
Phosphoric Acid.
Phosphoric acid, in combination with lime and a small
portion of magnesia, constitutes the greater portion of
the earthy matter of bone.
Bone ash (or burnt bone) consists principally of phos-
phate of lime and magnesia.
Phosphoric acid exists in most plants, united either
with potash, soda, lime, or magnesia. It is absolutely
essential to the life of animals, and for the production of
plants, furnishing their food.
Phosphoric acid may be considered as the most valu-
able mineral constituent of manures.
Sulphuric Acid.
Sulphuric acid is found in most soils in the form of
sulphate of lime, or gypsum. It is very useful for plants
of the clover tribe. When not present in the soil, a
dressing of gypsum is the readiest way of supplying it.
2.—ORGANIC ELEMENTS.
The organic elements are:—
Oxygen. Hydrogen. Carbon. Nitrogen.
Some organic compounds also contain phosphorus and
sulphur.
The organic elements are derived originally in great
quantity from the air by the leaves of plants; but in the
practice of farming it is found exceedingly useful to place
in the soil the organic as well as the inorganic compounds.
As the organic matters decompose in the soil, the roots
take up the liberated ingredients, which, together with
similar elements absorbed by the leaves from the ah, are
assimilated, and there is thus insured a larger produce to
the farmer of the plants he cultivates.
Oxygen, Hydrogen, and Carbon.
Oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon are the three elements


which make up the mass of plants—particularly of the
woody fibre. They are almost the sole constituents of
starch, gum, sugar, mucilage, and oil, which in the ani-
mal economy are the chief elements of respiration and the
producers of fat.
They are originally derived by plants from the air by
means of their leaves. They are usefully supplied to the
soil by means of all the forms of vegetable and animal
matters which constitute farm-yard dung.
Nitrogen.
Nitrogen is the most important of the organic ele-
ments. It is found in quantity in the seeds of plants,
and is an essential constituent of the flesh of animals.
Nitrogen is the most valuable organic constituent in
manures. It is the fertilizing principle of ammonia,
and of the nitrates of potash and soda, and is found in
great quantity in the best guanos. In the latter ma-
nures it is largely associated with phosphate of lime.
APPROXIMATIVE ESTIMATION OE THE
VALUE OF MANURES.
In consequence of the variation in the composition of
manure, and the constant adulterations practised by un-
principled dealers, it is a matter of considerable importance
to the farmer to be able in an easy manner to obtain an
approximative value of any manure which he may have
subjected to analysis ; and we subjoin a mode of valua-
tion, the use of which will at least save him from the
gross imposition to which he is occasionally subjected.
The substances which analysis and practice have proved
to be most efficient as manuring principles are phosphates,
and nitrogen in any of its forms.
A few isolated experiments prove potash to be of some
value in one or two crops, but, as this substance can
readily be bought in a state of tolerable purity as sul-
phate or muriate of potash, and as it is not generally
found in compounded manures, we shall not give this any
agricultural value, further than as comprised under the.
term of alkaline salts.
Silica, under any of its forms, has not yet been proved to
have any agricultural value; and carbonate of lime (chalk)

is in most instances a serious detriment to a manure,
though, useful on a large scale in the form of chalk or
marl.
From a careful comparison of numerous analyses of
manure with the value of the substances therein contained,
we have been led to adopt the following prices as giving the
nearest approximative value of the several manuring matters:
The following mode of calculation has been used by
me for many years, and is exceedingly simple, as we only
require the analysis of the sample to enable us to arrive
at its worth in a very few figures:—
RULE FOR CALCULATING THE VALUE OF MANURES.
Consider the analysis to represent the components of
one hundred tons. Multiply the respective amounts of
each ingredient by its price per ton in the preceding table,
add up the several products, and the sum will represent
the value of one hundred tons. Divide this amount by
one hundred, and the quotient will be the price per ton.
The decimals in the analysis below 0.5 may be disre-
garded, and those above that amount reckoned as an ad-
ditional unit. Thus, in the second example, the organic
matter, instead of 21.68, may be read 22; and the
phosphate of lime, instead of 44.35, may be called 44.
The values of all the guanos, the analyses of which will
be found in the subsequent pages, are calculated accord-
ing to the method adopted in these tables.
The following examples show how very closely the rule
brings out all the actual value of the various samples. It
is necessary, however, to remember that circumstances
might possibly arise in the course of time which would
render some alteration requisite in the amounts of our
multipliers of value. At the present period, however,
they are sufficiently true for every practical purpose.

are in want of—a bargain.
t This value is, however, practically lessened by the large quantity of carbonate of lime
contained in the sample. Yet this substance has actually been bought by farmers as Guano,
at from £S to £9 per ton.


ON THE DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF GUANO.
The word Guano, pronounced in the Spanish “ Huano,”
is the term now applied commercially to all fsecal de-
posits of birds and marine animals which on different
parts of the earth’s surface have been collected together
in greater or less purity. The quality and value of these
manures commercially depend almost wholly upon the
amount of decomposition to which they have been sub-
jected by the action of the atmosphere. The faecal matter
of these animals consists essentially of nitrogenous and
phosphatic compounds. The ammoniacal portion of
these deposits, with some of the phosphates, are, through
the long-continued action of rain and air, made tolerably
soluble in water, and are readily washed away. The phos-
phates of lime and magnesia are less soluble. In dry
climates, where very little rain falls, as in some parts of
Bolivia and Peru, on the Avestern coast of South America,
the dung deposited suffers very little from the action of
the atmosphere, and retains nearly the whole of its solu-
ble nitrogenous and phosphatic compounds. Guanos
found in the regions Avhere much rain falls lose a
greater portion of their soluble ingredients. The resi-
due is, hoAvever, often left rich in the phosphates of lime
and magnesia. Many guanos are also much deteriorated
by large quantities of sand being driven on to the deposits
by the action of the Avinds. Guanos may from their
composition naturally be divided into three classes:—
Ist. —Those Avhich have suffered little by atmospheric
action, and Avhich retain nearly the Avhole of their original
constituents, such as the Angamos and Peruvian Guanos.
2nd. —Those Avhich have lost a considerable portion of
their soluble ingredients: of this class are the Ichaboe,
Bolivian, and Chilian guanos. They contain a sufficient
quantity of nitrogen to distinguish them fromthethirdseries.
3rd.—Those which have lost nearly all their ammonia,
and contain but little more than the earthy phosphates
of the animal deposit. Many of these are largely con-
taminated with sand.

GUANOS WHICH HAVE SUFFERED BUT LITTLE FROM
ATMOSPHERIC ACTION.
ANGAMOS GUANO.
This Guano is obtained from a rocky point on the
Bolivian coast, called Angamos. It is the most recent de-
posit of the birds, and is collected by hand, with consider-
able danger and difficulty, from the bare surfaces of the
precipitous cliffs which they frequent. When pure, it is of
first-rate quality, and having suffered no decomposition, it
frequently contains from 20 to 24 per cent., or even more
of ammonia. The smallness of the quantity, however,
that can be yearly collected, renders it of little general
importance to the farmer. This guano differs altogether
from the other Bolivian guano imported into this country.
* This guano though imported as Angamos appears to differ totally from the other specimens.

The following is a detailed analysis of a sample of—
In some cargoes of tins guano a large number of hard
saline lumps are found of inferior value. They contain
nearly 50 per cent, of common salt. An analysis is
subjoined:—


PERUVIAN GUANO.
By far the greatest deposits of guano known are those
which exist within the territories of Peru. Guanos are
there found not only on different islands near the coast,
but also upon many parts of the coast itself. The variety
known in this country as Peruvian Guano is obtained
from the Chincha Islands. These islands are situated
in the Pacific Ocean, off the coast of Peru, at a distance
of about twelve miles.
They lie between 13 deg. and 14 deg. S. latitude;
in a district within which no rain falls, where the air is
dry, and the sun shines with vehement power. The
waters of the surrounding ocean contain innumerable
shoals of fish. Myriads of birds, after daily satisfy-
ing their voracious appetites upon the finny tenants of
the deep, have for ages made the islands their resting
place and nightly abode, and the receptacle of their
fsecal offerings. Prom the arid nature of the climate,
the excess of humidity has speedily evaporated from
their ordure, decomposition has been arrested, and by
gradual accumulation from time immemorial, these ex-
traordinary deposits have attained the depth, in many
parts, of one hundred feet.
These are the largest known deposits of guano in the
world.
The Guano, as found on the islands, is subject to
slight variations in composition. Towards the southwest,
the deposits are more exposed to the action of the spray
of the sea, brought by the prevailing winds. Some of
these guanos have lost by this means a certain amount
of ammonia, and have not yet been imported in quantity
into this country; in others, the deterioration is trifling ;
and many are simply discoloured, without having suf-
fered any other change, and are equal in value to paler
samples.*
* Messrs. Antony Gibbs and Sons are the sole agents in this country
for the Peruvian Government, and for the sale of Peruvian Guano.

Peruvian Guano contains in a natural form a consider-
able portion of soluble phosphates, which we are obliged
to produce artificially in other manures, by the action of
acids upon bones and other insoluble phosphates.
In fact, good guano partakes of the nature of super-
phosphate of lime, as it contains both soluble and inso-
luble phosphates. These together generally amount to
the average quantity found in commercial superphosphate
of lime.
This fact will be clearly seen from the subjoined table
of the average of fifty analyses of different samples of
guano, taken indiscriminately from the stores at present
lying in the ports of London, Liverpool, and Bristol.
It will also be seen by the following tables that Peruvian
Guano is remarkably uniform in the per-centage of its
constituents. This uniformity of composition is one of
the most distinguishing characteristics of guanos from
the Chincha Islands :
* The phosphoric acid la calculated as equal to neutral phosphate made soluble.

The use of Guano in Peru is of very ancient date ;
and for its preservation, and that of the birds by which
it was deposited, the most stringent precautions were
made use of by the native Incas and their Spanish suc-
cessors. At one period the punishment of death was
inflicted upon any one disturbing the birds in the breed-
ing season.
The following table contains analyses of various ma-
nures, made by Boussingault and other well-known che-
mists, and also an analysis of an ordinary sample of
Peruvian Guano.
* These analyses were made in the Laboratories of the College.
Boussingault, Payen, and many others of our leading
practical Agricultural Chemists, have come to the conclu-
sion that the value of different manures varies nearly in
proportion to the amount of nitrogen they contain.
There may be cases to which this rule is not exactly ap-
plicable ; but in many natural manures, an increase of
nitrogen is accompanied by an increase in the phosphate
of lime, and every other valuable manuring element. In
the above table, for instance, the 13.88 of nitrogen in the
Guano is accompanied by 80.40 parts of inorganic mat-
ter, of which 23.60 parts (or more than two-thirds) is
phosphate of lime.
If we take the per-centage of nitrogen, then, as a cor-
rect indication of manuring value, we shall find that one
ton of ordinary Peruvian Guano is equal to
tons of farm-yard dung. 22|- tons of pig dung, and
21 tons of horse dung. 14| tons of mixed human
38 \ tons of cow dung. excrements.

Let those who farm in hiJly countries, and other places
where carriage is expensive, ponder well the above facts.
Though a good farmer will produce as much manure
as he conveniently can, yet even farm-yard dung may be
bought too dear; and it is certain that on numbers of farms
the cartage of dung is so expensive an item of management,
that theintroductionof Guano, forthose parts at thegreatest
distance from the homestead, would be productive of the
same fertility, at a considerable saving of expense.
At the present price of Peruvian Guano, it is more than
questionable whether the ordinary plan of increasing the
available manure on a farm by the importation of oilcake
and the feeding of stock is at all economical. If the oil-
cake owes its fertilising properties to the nitrogen and
phosphate of lime it contains, it is certain, from the ana-
lyses of various chemists, that Peruvian Guano is a much
cheaper source of these substances. In a lecture delivered
by the author before the farmers of Dorchester, this sub-
ject was alluded to as follows :
“It may here be necessary to notice another question of great
importance, viz.;—ls the use of artificial food (such as oilcake) for
stock the cheapest mode of introducing bone-earth and ammonia into
the land 1 Many farmers are content if their fat stock produce as
much money as will pay for the oilcake used, together with the
price of the lean animals bought; thus sinking altogether the tur-
nips, mangold, and hay, likewise consumed by the stock. It appears
to be clear that, unless the oilcake affords a profit hy the beef or
mutton, a more expensive system of manuring could not well be
pursued. The following table, comparing the manuring values of
oil and rape cake with guano, may fie of some service in determin-
ing the practice of the intelligent farmer:—


“ From the foregoing table, it appears that one ton, or 2,240 lbs.
of Peruvian guano, containing 16 per cent, of ammonia, would in-
troduce into the farm six times the phosphate of lime, two-and-a-
quarter times the potash, and more than two and-a-half times the
ammonia, than would he furnished by one ton of the best oil or rape
cake. To pass oilcake through the bodies of animals, without some
attendant benefit, is both expensive and wasteful; and unless you
can find your profit in the increase of the beef and mutton, it is an
improper expenditure of money.”
These observations are amply supported by the opinion
of the members of one of the most intelligent Farmers’
Clubs in England. The Eotley Earmers’ Club have
unanimously resolved, “ That where there is not sufficient
dung for • the wheat crop, it is more profitable to apply
concentrated manures than to purchase dung ; and that
an equal amount of money expended in the purchase of
concentrated manures will raise more wheat than the
same amount expended in the purchase of oilcake or
com, and converted into dung by feeding cattle.” And
the Rev. L. Yernon Harcourt, speaking of this decision
of the Club, says, “AH my experiments tend to corrobo-
rate the view taken by the Botley Club on this subject.”
Leaving these facts and opinions for the consideration
of those farmers who seek to combine good farming with
economy of manuring, we shall now offer some sug-
gestions as to the best mode, and the proper time, -of ap-
plying Guano to different varieties of crops.
MODE OF APPLYING FIRST-CLASS GUANOS TO
VARIOUS CROPS.
PREPARATION OF GUANO FOR SOWING OR DRILLING.
For drilling-, it must first be mixed with four to six times its
weight of the ashes* of wood, turf, or coal, or with the same quan-
tity of well-sifted mould. Charcoal, in powder, either from peat
or wood, is also a most excellent article to be mixed with the
Guano, in the proportions indicated. Its great porosity allows it
to retain the volatile ammonia, and dry weather to absorb con-
siderable moisture from the air. This is of material benefit to
plants in then- early growth.
• Some varieties of wood ashes, which contain a considerable smonnt of free
alkali, are not suitable for mixing with Gnano, as they liberate the ammonia.
This may easily be shown by mixing a shovel-fall of the ashes with the same
quantity of Guano, If a strong ammoniacol odour .be immediately perceived, the
ashes are not fit to be mixed with Guano. The mode of preparation here de-
scribed should be used, with slight variations, according to •circumstances, for nil
varieties of crops,— 3. C. N.


Before mixing, the guano must he finely pulverized, which may
easily be done with a common garden roller upon the floor of a
ham or shed, or even by heating it with a common shovel. A
layer of the ashes, &c., is then spread evenly upon the floor, and a
quantity of the fine Guano sifted over it. This is followed by
another layer of mould or ashes, and another of Guano, until the
requisite quantity of both is used. The whole must then be re-
peatedly turned with the shovel until thoroughly mixed. , If time
will permit, it is now preferable to leave the mixture for eight or ten
days. It must then be again sifted, when it will be ready for use.
In using Guano with the drill, care must be taken that the mix-
ture falls below the seed, and that an inch or so of soil intervenes
between them, otherwise the strength of the Guano will kill the
seed. Garrett’s, Hornsby’s, and other modern drills, are well
adapted for depositing Guano and other concentrated manures.
lue above mixture is generally sufficiently damp to' fall exactly
where the hand directs it. When this is not the case, a small
quantity of water should be added; the field must be sown with
the mixture in the ordinary manner, and the manure harrowed in;
the seed is then drilled as usual.
Perhaps the preferable mode would be to broadcast two-thirds
of the Guano applied, and to drill one-third with the seed. The
young plants would then have enough manure under the drills
to serve the early stages of growth, while the Guano sown broad-
cast would supply the wants of the plants in a more mature state,
when the roots would have spread in every direction in the soil.
Wheat, Bareev, Oats, and other Cereals.
The researches of modern chemistry have in no respect proved
of greater benefit to practical agriculture than in the analysis and
estimation of the components of different manures, and in the
careful examination of the effects of these components on different
crops when applied either alone or combined. This is, in fact, the
only philosophical mode of arriving at a true knowledge of the
manuring substances best adapted for the development of various
forms of vegetable life.
Prom the analyses of some thousands of samples of manure in
the laboratories of the College, and/rom a knowledge of the effects
E reduced by these manures on a variety of crops, the conclusion
as been irresistible that nitrogen is the cheapest substance to
apply to cereals. The same conclusion has been arrived at by
numerous other chemists. The results also of the experience of
farmers in all parts of the country for many years is, that nitro-
fen in any of its ordinary combinations is the matter of all others
est adapted for the growth of wheat and other cereals, and
which for these crops will yield the greatest per-centage of profit.
Not that com requires no phosphates or other materials for its
development, but that the latter are generally supplied to the soil
for other crops in the ordinary course of rotation, or, as in the case
of Guano, are found in the manure itself. The market value of


nitrogen of course varies with the source of its supply, and with
the rise and fall in price of its various combinations; but at the
present comparative price of Guano, this substance appears to be
nearly, if not altogether, the cheapest source of nitrogen, at least
in any considerable quantity.
There can be no doubt of the vastly increased production of
corn, and consequently of profit to the farmer, which would accrue
if Guano were more extensively used.
Our most intelligent agriculturists, among whom we may men-
tion Mr. Caird and Mr. Lawes, agree that the application of two
cwt. per acre will give an increase of between eight and nine
bushels of grain, besides one-fourth more straw than usual.
Mr. Caird has proved that without any increase of rent or taxes,
an expenditure of twenty-shillings per acre produces a net profit
of thirty-two shillings and sixpence. If these facts were more
generally known, it is impossible to believe that farmers would not
at once avail themselves of the opportunity of making a profit of
more than one hundred and fifty per cent, upon the annual addi-
tional outlay.
Many farmers prefer using the whole of their Guano for wheat
in the autumn. A portion, at all events, should be sown broadcast
at that period. This is more especially needful if no dressing of
farm-yard dung be used.
If Guano be used for wheat in lieu of farm-yard dung, a greater
quantity, often the whole, ought to be applied in the autumn.
Care, however, must be taken not to stimulate the plant too much,
otherwise it will be liable to suffer injury from frost. One cwt. or
two cwt. per acre on light lands can be applied broadcast, and har-
rowed in during autumn, either before or after the drilling of the
wheat.
In the spring a further application of not more than one cwt. or
two cwt. may be made, harrowed in with light harrows. If the
wheat be drilled sufficiently apart to allow of horse-hoeing, it will
be found advantageous.
Should wheat, manured with dung as usual, look unkindly in the
spring, it will be greatly benefited by a dressing per acre of two
cwt. of Guano and four cwt. of salt. Salt has great effect in
strengthening the straw of wheat and other cereals; and where
any of these crops are liable to lodge, or whenever Guano is used,
four cwt. or five cwt. of salt should also be sown per acre. For
barley and oats two cwt. of Guano and four cwt. of salt may be
sown broadcast per acre, the seed drilled, and the whole harrowed
in together.
Turnips.
For this crop Guano may be applied, either broadcast or by
drill, mixed as previously shown. The quantity of Guano to be
used per acre will vary with the condition of the farm. About
two to three cwt. may be applied with advantage, and six cwt.
have been used with safety on heavy soils. Two cwt. or three


cwt. sown 'broadcast, and one cwt. drilled with the seed, will pro-
bably give the best chance for a successful result.
Experiments have proved that, when a portion of Guano is
applied between the drills, and well horse-hoed in after the turnips
are up, large crops are obtained. It is questionable whether this
is not one of the best means of applying Guano, as on light soils
there is less liability to loss in the Guano, and the roots of the
turnip are supplied with fresh manure at a vigorous period of their
growth. Two cwt. or three cwt. broadcast before the turnips are
sown, and one cwt. between the drills afterwards, will be found
sufficient.
A combination of superphosphate of Erne with Guano has
been used with much success. For this purpose two cwt. or
three cwt. of Guano is sown broadcast, and the same quantity of
superphosphate of lime, mixed with ashes, drilled with the seed.”*
We may here suggest to some of our intelligent, practical
farmers, to try the effect upon the turnip crop of a mixture of
Peruvian Guano and sulphuric acid.
Sulphuric acid is undoubtedly a manure per se, and it seems to
exert a specific effect on the turnip. A mixture might be made of
four cwt. of Guano and one cwt. of white acid, of sp. gr. I'Bl.
The Guano must be laid in a heap, a hollow made in the centre,
and the sulphuric acid must be poured into it; the whole should
then be well worked together with a spade or other instrument.
Considerable chemical action will take place, but in a short time
the whole will become dry and ready for the drill. If the brown
acid, of sp. gr. T 7, be employed instead of the white, one-fourth
more must be used. The above quantity will be sufficient for two
acres. We believe that a mixture of this kind will prove a most-
efficient manure.
It is of some importance to remember, in using Guano for
turnips and other roots, that the whole of the nitrogenous matter
is not taken out by the crop, but that a portion is left for the sub-
sequent com crop. Large quantities of Guano are used for heavy
land by many of our best Essex farmers on mangel as a good pre-
parationfor wheat, the mangelbeing wholly withdrawn from the field.
Mangel Wurzel.
Guano is an excellent manure for this crop. On heavy and
loamy soils the land is ploughed, and ten or twenty tons of farm-
K'd dung are worked into the soil—before Christmas, if possible,
o or three weeks before drilling the seed, four cwt. of Guano,
with an equal weight of common salt, is sown broadcast over the
field and well harrowed in. The seed is drilled in the usual way,
and at thirty to forty inches apart. In thinning the plants after-
wards, they should not be left too close together. Repeated horse-
hoeings between the rows is of great importance, for air and nutri-
ment are thus admitted to the roots of the plants. As in the case
•of the turnips, great advantage will be obtained by occasionally

agricultural counties, \ras taken by a gentleman who followed this plan.


sprinkling a little Guano between the tows previously to the hoeing.
This insures continued nutriment to the plants.
When no farm-yard dung has been applied in winter, six cwt. of
Guano may be used instead of four cwt. On heavy land this may
be put on either in the autumn or spring, and well worked into
the soil, following this up by a small dressing afterwards be-
tween the drills at the time of hoeing. The land in either case
will be left in good condition for wheat.
On light chalky soils, a mixture of Guano, nitrate of soda, and
common salt, at the rate of two cwt. each per acre, has been found
very efficacious in the growth of mangel wurzel.
Grass.
The experiments of Kuhlman, the French agricultural chemist,
upon the action of ammonia on grass lands, at once point to Guano
as one of the most important manures for increasing the productive
power of our pasture and meadow land. This chemist applied
ammonia in different forms, alone, and combined with other simple
manures, and he found that in all cases the amount of grass or hay
produced was in exact proportion to the amount of nitrogen con-
tained in the manure. Guano containing a large amount of am-
monia, and being also at present its cheapest source, must, there-
fore, prove of great benefit in the production of grass.
For grass land, from two to four cwt. of Guano, mixed with
soil, may be used per acre. Wet or damp weather should be
selected for sowing it. Probably the end of March or the begin-
ning of April is the best time. Under certain circumstances, Guano
may be applied to grass land in the autumn, particularly where
the under-soil is of a strong or loamy character. Thus applied,
it will have the effect of bringing up the grass earlier in the spring.
Potatoes.
From the comparison of numerous series of experiments, it would
appear that Guano succeeds best with this crop as a top-dressing,
in conjunction with farm-yard dung. The ground is prepared in
the usual manner. The farm-yard dung is deposited in the bottoms
of the drills, the sets of the seed potatoes laid upon the top of the
manure, and the whole earthed up. Before the plants appear, the
Guano is to be sown on the top of the drills, covered over with the
plough, and then rolled. If the potatoes be grown on the level,
and not in drills, the guano may be sown over the field broad-cast,
two or three weeks after the potatoes have been planted. The
quantity of Guano to be used per acre is from three cwt. to six cwt.
Many experiments have proved the great utility of sulphate of
soda, or sulphate of magnesia, in conjunction with Guano, upon
this crop. As far as our own experience goes, these salts have a
decided effect in diminishing the liability of potatoes to disease.
We should therefore recommend, in addition to the Guano, to put
per acre, at the same time,
1 cwt. of sulphate of soda, and
1 cwt. of sulphate of magnesia.


If farm-yard dung be not used for potatoes, broad-cast and
barrow-in three cwt. or four cwt. of Guano, and set the potatoes as
usual. Three or four weeks afterwards sow over them, and lightly
harrow-in the quantity of Guano and one cwt. each of the sul-
phates of soda and magnesia.
The mixture of sulphuric acid and Guano mentioned under the
head of “ Turnips,” would probably be found an excellent manure
for this crop.
Near the Humber, as much as ten cwt. annually is used for
potatoes, with extraordinary results.
Beans, Peas, and Leguminous Plants.
For beans or peas, two cwt. or three cwt. per acre may be used,
either broadcast before sowing, or a portion afterwards between the
drills at the time of horse-hoeing. The latter would probably be
the better plan.
For vetches, lucerne, sainfoin, or clover, two cwt. or three cwt.
per acre broadcast may be used. This should be sown in the
beginning of April, on a dewy morning, or during wet weather.
It is useless to sow if there be a probability of dry weather ensuing
for any lengthened period.
Flax.
This crop, in olden time, had the renown of being one of the
most exhausting crops which could be put into the land. We
have now learned that white crops, and those in general which
have the repute of ‘‘ drawing the land,” are those which require
the largest amount of nitrogen for the formation of seed, and for
which, consequently, ammoniacal manures are precisely adapted.
With the aid of Guano or other ammoniacal manures, flax can no
longer be considered an exhauster of the soil.
In using Guano for this crop, from two cwt. to four cwt. per
acre, mixed with ashes, may be sown broadcast, and harrowed in a
few days before the seed is drilled.
Cabbage, Carbots, Ac.
Guano has been found of material benefit for these crops, and
may be employed advantageously at the rate of from two cwt. to
four cwt. per acre. It must be remembered that carrots require
deep cultivation, and that both crops will be benefited by the
proper stirring of the soil between the rows, and the occasional
addition of a little Guano.
Hops.
To no crop does the addition of a proper amount of ammoniacal
manure prove more advantageous than to the hop. The constant
withdrawing of the hops, year by year, from the land necessitates
the importation upon the soil of a considerable amount of both
mineral and organic ingredients. Four cwt. of Guano and three
cwt. of salt per acre, applied at two separate times, and well worked
in between the alleys, will be found a useful application. Or the
manure may be put round each hill, and covered up with the soil.
From several analyses of the hop plant, the following mixture


was recommended by the Author, some years ago, as a proper
manure for the hop:—
MANURE FOR AN ACRE OF HOPS.
3 cwt. of Guano,
1 cwt. of common salt,
1 £ cwt. of saltpetre, or nitrate of soda,
1 cwt. of gypsum.
This manure has heen used with considerable success in various
parts of Surrey, Kent, and Sussex.
It will not be necessary to give any further details of
particular crops for which Guano is suitable, or to describe
more fully the mode of its employment. The intelligent
farmer will soon learn to vary its application to suit the
end he may have in view.
Guano, however, is useful to others besides the farmer.
To the horticulturist it is invaluable, and many specimens
of the finest vegetables and fruits, and of the most
beautiful flowers, have been indebted to the judicious
use of Guano for the admiration they have excited, and
the prizes they have obtained.
Por further particulars respecting its horticultural use,
we must refer the reader to the columns of the Gardener's
Chronicle. And in concluding this part of our subject,
we cannot refrain from quoting the opinion of Dr. Lindley,
the learned editor of that valuable journal, that “If the
experience of the last few years has taught us one thing
more certainly than another, it is the unfailing excellence
of Guano for every kind of crop which requires manure.”
ON THE ADULTERATION OF PERUVIAN GUANO.
After the observations we have made on the utility of
Guano to those engaged in agricultural pursuits, it would
have been very gratifying to have concluded our remarks.
It is, however, our invidious duty to refer to a less
pleasing, but not less important, part of the subject.
The high manuring value of Peruvian Guano, and its
extensive sale, combined with the want of judgment
among agriculturists as to its genuineness, and their
manifest reluctance to be at the expense of a chemical
analysis, have, together, induced many fraudulent dealers
to adulterate this manure systematically, to a great


extent. The strong desire which unfortunately exists
among a large class of farmers to purchase Guano at the
lowest terms per ton, without due reference to the
quality or composition of the manure, has also operated
most materially to their own disadvantage.
If the honest dealer offers a genuine article in the
market, upon which he puts only a reasonable profit, and
finds that his roguish neighbour can more readily sell an
adulterated article, he has no alternative but to abandon
the trade or to turn rogue himself. The man who likes
cheap manures should be reminded that to the buyer
they" are always dear, as he has to pay the whole expense
of adulteration, as well as the twenty or thirty per cent,
profit of the dishonest dealer. In fact, we should
recommend the lovers of cheap manures to follow, in
preference, the example of Quin, who finding his milk
more than half water, armed with two jugs, demanded
of his milkman “to give him them separate, he could
mix for himself.”
It is, indeed, scarcely possible to give persons at a
distance an idea of the extent to which Guano is
adulterated in London and some other large towns.
The demand of the farmer for cheap manure, acting
upon the trade through the medium of the unscrupulous
dealer, has given rise to a fraudulent and hitherto
successful business.
A most extensive and profitable trade is at present
carried on by parties who practise the compounding of
specious-looking articles, to mix with Guano ; these
they supply to dealers in that manure.
The materials used to sophisticate Guano are numerous.
Sand, marl, clay, chalk, limestone, bricks, tiles, gypsum
—ground, when necessary, to a fine powder—constitute
the materials for which the farmer is destined to pay £8
or £lO per ton. These, mixed in proportions to counter-
feit the colour of Guano, are sold to roguish dealers in
town and, country, who introduce a little genuine Guano to
give the necessary odour. Some recent actions brought
against parties who have sold adulterated Guano, in which
heavy damages were obtained, have contributed some little
to arrest this nefarious traffic. One remedy lies with the


farmer, who ought to prosecute vigorously those who
impose upon him.
Another system of deception is often practised by men
whose consciences are perhaps too tender to sell as first-
class guanos those they know to have been manufactured
in England: these parties, however, have no objection to
sell as first-class guanos importations of very inferior
quality. What they sell is no doubt guano, but it is not
the guano the buyer wishes to purchase. All purchasers
should therefore require the invoice to expressly declare on
its face the name and quality of the guano bought, such
as Peruvian, Bolivian, &c. The parties will thus render
themselves liable to severe punishment in case of fraud.
Though numerous unprincipled dealers exist in the
manure trade, yet there are certainly many others, honest
men, upon whose fair fame there has never yet been a
breath of suspicion.
We advise the farmer, therefore, to purchase his ma-
nures from men of established reputation, who have a
character to lose, and who will not demand from him
more than a fair and reasonable profit.
The best safeguard, however, against fraudulent dealers
is never to use a manure of any kind without having a
sample analyzed by a competent authority. Indeed men
of real intelligence and business habits now regularly call
to their assistance the science of the analytical chemist to
ascertain the real agricultural value of artificial manures.
It should be also remembered that at present £l2 per
ton is the lowest price at which Messrs. Ant. Gibbs and
Sons sell Peruvian Guano; and this only in wholesale
quantities. The country dealer has, in addition, to pay
wharfage, carriage, and other expenses, which must be
added to the cost of the Guano. He is also entitled to
a reasonable interest for his money, if he gives long
credit for that manure which he himself is compelled to
pay for in cash.
We leave it, therefore, to the common sense of the
English farmer to judge whether a genuine Guano can
possibly be purchased at the prices at which Guanos,
purporting to he genuine, are constantly offered in the
country markets.

ICHABOE GUANO.
The island of Ichaboe lies on the Avesteru coast of
Africa, about 400 miles north of the Cape of Good
Hope; lat. 26 deg, 19 min. south, 14 deg. 50 min. east lon.
It is a small rocky island, situated very near the coast,
and is the abode of innumerable birds, chiefly penguins
and gannets. When first discovered the guano deposits
Avere very extensive, and Avere estimated to contain many
hundreds of thousands of tons. The guano from this
island was at first of very good quality, and nearly the
Avhole was brought to this country; the recent im-
portations, which consist mainly of the annual deposits
of the birds, are to some extent mixed Avith sandy and
other matters, so that they have ceased to be important
either in quantity or value. Subjoined are analyses of
these guanos:—

BOLIVIAN GUANO.
The Bolivian guanos originally brought to this country
were very nearly equal in quality to Peruvian, and in
character ranked with them in the market. The recent
importations have been very much lower in quality. We
subjoin analyses of samples imported from 1852 to 1858,,
which have come under our notice:—

to this market. We subjoin analyses of these guanos.
PAVILLON DE PICA GUANO.
A large deposit of guano is found in lat. 21 deg. south,
70 west long., on a part of the Peruvian coast called
Pavilion de Pica. This guano has not hitherto been
imported in quantity into this country, but it may be so
ultimately. We subjoin analyses of it:—

Chili, deposited under the same circumstances as the
preceding guano. The following analysis will indicate
its general character :
CALIFORNIA GUANOS.
On some parts of the coast of California dung deposits
are likewise found. They vary somewhat in character,
some containing much more sand and earthy matters
than others. The following table will give an idea of

PATOS ISLAND GUANO.
Patos island lies off the coast of Lower California, and
has deposits of guano similar in character to those of
Ichaboe. This guano has not found much favour in the
market. It is similar to the Elide Island guanos.
CLASS III.
THOSE WHICH HAVE LOST NEARLY ALL THEIR AM-
MONIA, AND CONTAIN LITTLE MORE THAN EARTHY
PHOSPHATES.
AFRICAN GUANOS.
As previously mentioned, the island of Ichaboe once
furnished a large amount of good guanos. Prom many
other points on the African coast guano has also been
imported into this country. Some of these have been of
very fair quality, as far as concerns their phosphate of
lime; but others were much contaminated with earthy
matters. The guano from Saldanha Bay has been found
to be useful for turnips. We append analyses of thpse
varieties of guanos : —■

WEST INDIAN GUANO.
Many of the islands of the Caribbean Sea are also the
resort of birds who live and breed there in the same
manner as on the Chincha islands. The conditions of
the atmosphere, however, are very different. While on
the Chincha islands there is no rain at all, on the West
India islands there is an annual rainfall of large amount,
combined with tempests and other violent atmospheric
disturbances. Without the rainfall, the guano in this
district would undoubtedly be equal to Peruvian; but,
as it is, the soluble matters are washed away, and there
is left in most cases little more than the phosphates of lime
and magnesia, sometimes contaminated with large quan-
tities of sand. The analyses of the guanos from various is-
lands of this group will give an idea of their general vslwe.

BAKER ISLAND GUANO.
Among many other islands of the West Indies that
contain deposits of faecal matter is Baker island. The
analysis of the guano from it is annexed:—
NAVASSA ISLAND GUANO.
Navassa island lies about half way between Jamaica
and St. Domingo, and is between three and four miles in
circumference. It is apparently thickly wooded in parts.
The guano is found some little distance from the sur-
face. It is a purely phosphatic guano, the nitrogenous
compounds having been almost wholly lost by atmos-
pheric action. The following analyses will show that
this guano contains no soluble phosphate.

MARACAYBO.
This most remarkable substance is found on Monk
Island, near Maracaybo, in the Gulf of Venezuela. It
is found in large rocky masses, containing considerable
traces of organic matter, and presenting all the features
of a guano changed by volcanic action. As found it
would have been of no use as manure ; but the deposits
from this island have been almost wholly employed in
the manufacture of superphosphate of lime, for which
they are very well adapted. This substance is singular,
from the fact of its containing an excess of phosphoric
acid, compared with other known natural phosphates.

BIRD ISLAND.
This island lies some distance to the west of St.
Vincent, in the West Indies. We subjoin the analysis of
its guano, which is comparatively worthless as a manure:

MEXICAN GUANO.
Some manures have been introduced into this country
under the name of Mexican Guanos. It will be seen
from the following analyses that they are of very low
character. They are not worth importing into this
country, though they have been sold to farmers at very
high prices. We give two analyses.
KOORIA MOORIA GUANO.
The Kooria Mooria islands are five or six leagues from
the coast of Arabia, lying nearly east and west from each
other. They are very barren islands; Halki, the western-
most island, is small, and situated in lat. 17 deg. 29 min.
north, lon. 55 deg. 40J min. east; Sardi, the second,
bears east 15 miles from Halki. Halabi, the third, in
lat. 17 deg. 30 min. north, long. 56 deg. 5 \ min. east,
is the largest of the group. There is a fourth island
called Deriabi, and an islet named Rodando. The chan-
nels between the westernmost islands and the main are

other islands are also considered safe ; but that formed
by Halabi and the easternmost island Deriabi is the
best. We subjoin analyses of guanos from this district.
There are many other varieties of guano obtained from
the Arabian coast; their general characteristics are
similar to those of the Kooria Mooria islands.

JARVIS’ ISLAND.
The island thus called is in lat. 0 deg. 28 min. south,
lon. 159 deg. 46 min. west, and lies due south of the
Sandwich Islands. It is five miles in circumference, and
its surface is pretty generally covered with low shrubs;
the guano is found underneath. The following is the
analysis:—
SOMBRERO GUANO.
An exceedingly curious phosphatic matter has been
lately imported into this country, under the name of
Sombrero Guano. It was at first difficult to decide the
exact nature of this substance. A careful examination
has, however, proved that we cannot rightly rank it as a
guano, but that it must be regarded as a mineral
phosphate. As it has been entered at the Custom
House as guano, we feel inclined to give some account
of it. The island of Sombrero is situated in Lat. 18
deg. 35 min. N., Long. 63 deg. 28 min. W. It is situ-
ated about 60 miles from St. Thomas, one of the Virgin
Isles. The island is 1J miles long, extending from
N.E. to S.W., and it is of a triangular shape. The
average breadth is about three-quarters of a mile.
The island is covered with boulders, said to contain
fossils, and apparently different from any other rocks on
the island. They vary from one ton to twenty tons in
weight. The surface of the island is in most parts com-
posed of a hard silicious rock or tufa, from two to four
feet in depth, below which is found phosphatic and cal-
careous tufa, interspersed with irregular upright dikes

and bosses of solid phosphoric matter. The whole island,
as far as can be ascertained, appears to be one mass of
the same material.
In different places the solid phosphatic matter protrudes
to the surface to the extent of some thousands of square
yards, say from one-half to three-quarters of an acre, un-
covered by the tufa. This rock varies in colour from pink to
grey, yellowish green and dirty white. Many silicificd
stumps of trees are found on the surface throughout the
island. The -phosphatic tufaceous deposit contains the
casts of several varieties of marine shells, and many fossil
bones are found embedded in the same stratum to the
depth of from ten to thirty feet. The dikes of solid
phosphatic rock, although generally upright in direction,
are often curved and twisted from the perpendicular. In
this substance we find a considerable amount of iron
and alumina, and in some specimens carbonate of lime,
but no soluble phosphate.
It is stated that about 40,000 tons have been already
obtained from the island, and used in the United States,
simply ground and put upon the land—with what exact
results we are not able to state. From its composition,
its evident use in this country would be a basis for
superphosphate of lime.
The following are the analyses of the mineral phosphate
called'

PATAGONIAN GUANO.
Some guanos have been imported into this country
from Patagonia and the Falkland Islands. They are
nearly all of the same character, and are very much
deteriorated by the action of rain. We subjoin the
analyses:—

SHARKS BAY GUANO.
Some guanos have been imported from the islets and
rocky coasts of Australia. They have proved of very
inferior quality, and great loss has been sustained by the
parties who have shipped them. The analyses appended
show that the freight must frequently be more than the
value of the guano.

MANURES SOLD UNDER THE NAME OF GUANO.
The practical value of good guano to the agriculture
of this kingdom having been thoroughly established,
many manufactured manures have been introduced into
the market under the name of guano. This has been
done in spite of the fact that that name can only be
honestly applied to the natural deposits of birds and
other animals. Whenever the farmer hears of British
and Italian guanos, and of other substances of the same
class, his suspicions ought instantly-to be aroused; it
being indubitable that no guano, properly so called, has
ever been deposited in the localities referred to. Some
attempts have been made to improve even Peruvian
guano, which has been represented by the manufacturer
as “ Peruvian Guano with ammonia partially fixed,
tvlierehy its quality is much improved .” When the Peru-
vian guano is not so improved it is worth £13 per ton;
but it appears that when it is improved for the farmer its
value is only £2 10s. per ton ! Some other substances
are equally improperly sold in this country under the
name of guano, description and analyses of them will,
we think, be more in place in the work we propose to
publish hereafter.
NOTE.
When experiments are carried on by the agriculturist for the pur-
pose of ascertaining the productive properties and comparative values
of different manures, great care should he taken that the manures
used should be fair representatives of their respective classes. This
is the more necessary as it is possible that samples may he sent out
for these experiments superior to the hulks, thus giving to them a
fictitious value-


OBSERVATIONS ON THE USE OF GUANOS OF
THE SECOND AND THIRD CLASS.
CLASS II.
THOSE WHICH HAVE LOST A CONSIDERABLE PORTION
OF THEIR SOLUBLE INGREDIENTS.
Guanos of this class have lost a considerable amount
of their ammonia, and in consequence require to be
applied in much larger quantities than guanos of the first
class.
The mode described for using first-class guanos will
also apply to those of the second class; but, in general,
the amount per acre ought to be nearly doubled. Eor
ordinary root crops many of these guanos, used in proper
quantities, have proved to be serviceable manures.
In purchasing these guanos the prudent farmer will
always require not only a guaranteed analysis before he
buys, but before using the manure he will have the bulk
also analyzed. If he has bought a spurious article, he
will, by taking these precautions, prevent the loss of his
year’s rent, tillage, and crop.
CLASS III.
THOSE WHICH HAVE LOST NEARLY ALL THEIR
AMMONIA, AND CONTAIN LITTLE MORE THAN
EARTHY PHOSPHATES.
If used alone, six or eight hundredweight may he
applied per acre. The best guanos of this class are suit-
able for some species of root crops, and then only when
unmixed with much sand, and containing a good amount
of phosphates really derived from the rain-washed deposits
of birds and other animals.
In many guanos of this class, however, the phosphates
are too insoluble by ordinary atmospheric action to answer
by themselves. Even the best of them are most useful
when dissolved by sulphuric acid, and made into super-
phosphate of lime.
The precautions previously mentioned should be ob-
served in the purchase of these manures,

To prepare a sample of manure for chemical analysis, half a pound
should be taken from each of a number of bags containing the hulk, and
these should be mixed together on a sheet of brown paper, until thoroughly
incorporated and homogeneous. A quantity weighing three or four
ounces is enough for analysis; and the sample can easily be sent by post
from any part of the kingdom. •To prevent evaporation, the specimen
should be wrapped up in tin-foil, or lead-leaf from a tea-chest, and after-
wards in paper. If tin-foil cannot be procured, two thicknesses of strong
paper should be used. The title or description of the sample, together
with the full address of the sender, should he distinctly and legibly
written on the inner wrapper. To ensure speedy delivery, in accordance
with the new Post Office arrangements, parcels and letters should have
