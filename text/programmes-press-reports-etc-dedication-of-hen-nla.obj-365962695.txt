SONS OF THE SOUTH
henry lawson’s first poem
PUBLISHED IN THE SYDNEY BULLETIN
ON IST OCTOBER 1887
Sons of the South, awake! arise!
Sons of the South, and do.
Banish from under your bonny skies
Those old-world errors and wrongs and lies,
Making a hell in a Paradise
That belongs to your sons and you.
Sons of the South, make choice between
( Sons oj the South, choose true)
The Land oj Morn and the Land of E’en,
The Old Dead Tree and the Young Tree Green,
The Land that belongs to the lord and Queen,
And the Land that belongs to you.
Sons of the South, your time will come —
Sons of the South, ’tis near —
The “Signs of the Times’’, in their language dumb,
Foretell it, and ominous whispers hum,
Like sullen sounds of a distant drum.
In the ominous atmosphere.
Sons of the South, aroused at last!
Sons of the South are few!
But your ranks grow longer and deeper fast,
And ye shall swell to an army vast,
And free from the wrongs of the North and Past
The land that belongs to you.
