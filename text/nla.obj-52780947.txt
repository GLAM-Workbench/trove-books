REPORT ON MENTAL DEFICIENCY IN THE COMMONWEALTH
OF AUSTRALIA.
The problem of mental deficiency is one of supreme national importance, inasmuch as it involves the physical
and mental health of the whole population of Australia, as well as its economic prosperity and efficiency.
So far as Australia is concerned, the subject has been considered, up to the present, as one of the particular
duties of the State, but there are good reasons why it should not be limited to the narrow and wholly artificial
borders by which the States and their individual activities are confined. We may at least assume that the
Commonwealth has a duty in the way of co-ordinating legislation and in regulating the nation’s activities with a
view to establishing reciprocity between the States and uniformity in administration by those Departments which
are responsible for the care of the mentally defective.
More than this, the Commonwealth is already interested, since there are many mentally defective persons in
receipt of invalid pensions, concerning which fact it should be pointed out that an anomaly already exists arising
from the fact that there is differentiation in the treatment between the mentally defective in private care and
guardianship, and those in State institutions. It must be a matter of common knowledge that there are very
considerable numbers of mentally defective persons segregated in State hospitals or hospitals for the insane or
institutions for the feeble-minded, who are not in receipt of the relief by the Commonwealth afforded to other mentally
deficient persons who are not in such State institutions, where, be it remarked, they should not infrequently be
detained that they might get the necessary inspection, care and training, at the hands of the officials of the State,
whose experience in such matters would be a valuable protection to them.
Evidence was given in 1925 before the Royal Commission on Health at some length on the question of mental
deficiency and the steps taken to deal with that important aspect of preventive medicine. The Royal Commission on
Health in its report made reference to this problem, and included recommendations that a Director of a Division of
Child Welfare should be appointed, one of whose duties should be to investigate the health conditions of children of
all ages, especially mental hygiene, and that the Commonwealth should subsidize States to provide institutional care
for mental defectives. These recommendations were considered by the conference of Ministers of Health in 1926 and
were approved by that conference. The Federal Health Council, at its second session in 1928, passed the following
resolution:—
“Mental Deficiency. —ln view of the incompleteness of information concerning the extent of mental
deficiency in Australia, and the urgent necessity for having this knowledge available, the Council requests the
Commonwealth Government to arrange for an inquiry to be made and for a full report on this subject to be
compiled for the next session of the Council.”
The Commonwealth Government adopted this resolution and approached the Government of the State of
Victoria with a request that the services of the writer should be made available for the purposes of carrying out the
full inquiry contemplated by the resolution of the Council.
The report herewith presented is the outcome of this action by the Commonwealth Government. It is not
claimed for the survey that it is an absolutely accurate census of all mental defectives within the Australian borders,
but in all probability it can be considered sufficiently truthful to demonstrate the need for action by the Federal
Government. It may be possible also to compare Australian statistics on this subiect with published returns and
estimates from other countries, particularly with those of English-speaking nations. It is hoped in this report to
indicate the principal causes of mental deficiency, with a view to stimulating the study of preventive measures in
w ith the teaching of modern hygiene, and to point out the most efficient method of providing for the detection,
..cation, training, segregation and guardianship of the various classes of defective individuals.
tr At the request of the Federal Health Minister, facilities were made through the State Governments for the
visits of the writer, who was thereby enabled to obtain interviews and co-operation with State Departments, such
as the Education, Lunacy, Penal, Children’s Welfare and other agencies of the State. Private institutions, blind
deaf and dumb asylums, epileptic colonies, were also visited, and the writer desires to acknowledge the invariable
courtesy and assistance which he has received at the hands of heads of the churches, Ministers of State, public
servants, and many private citizens, who are interested in this subject.
Arrangements were made for the writer’s visits and for much of the work in the matter of the collection
of statistics "by the Federal Medical Officers of Health in each State, and the assistance of these gentlemen has been
of a very valuable character.
iylthough the subject of mental deficiency has many sides, it was considered for the purposes of this return
necessary to turn one’s attention chiefly to two avenues of inquiry—the educational and the institutional.
'Vyith regard to the former, it was thought desirable to give the Education Departments in each State as free
Iras possible, permitting them to make use of their own statistics wherever such existed. This was especially
in New South Wales, where the Education Department was undertaking a survey of the State under the
of Dr. Harvey Sutton, Principal School Medical Officer ; and Tasmania, in which State a Mental Deficiency
a Board are already established. In other States than New South Wales, as no inquiry had been made
a set scheme was adopted and the Education Departments in each of the States fell into line and adopted
W3|HKrm return. Forms were sent out to each State School on the lines of that attached to the appendix to this
ijjr, as well as criteria for tabulation printed in each Education Gazette. This advice or instruction is also to be
in the appendix.


It will be seen that the work asked from the State Education Departments was not a light one, as, according
to the returns of the Federal Statistician in 1926, there were 10,203 State schools with 883,925 scholars enrolled and
an average attendance of 730,571. Inasmuch as inquiry was also to be made from private schools, of which there
existed in 1926 no less than 1,761, with an enrolment of 233,566 and an average attendance of 178,985, it will be seen
that inquiries should be made from nearly 12,000 schools and of more than 1,100,000 schoolchildren. The collection
and examination of these returns afforded a task of some considerable magnitude.
For these returns, a special classification of mental deficiency was adopted and three grades were recognized—
those of extremely low mentality, who may be generally known as idiots and low-grade imbeciles, those of definite
mental deficiency, not so low as the first class, but still definitely below the third class, which are spoken of as the
border-line class, and returns were asked for as to this border-line class according to the criteria laid down in the
advices printed in the Education Gazettes, because it was considered that this was the most important class which the
educationalist has to deal with. Age classification was also asked for, giving special heed to the period of school age
viz., six to fourteen years of age. This classification was, in point of fact, devised by the educationalists and medical
officers of the Victorian Education Department and their advice was followed, although there was more than a
possibility of border-line cases, who were merely dull, being included in the returns of the mental deficient, Still,
the explanations and definitions as to the criteria were so simple that it was thought that every school teacher should
have been able to respond to the request in a reasonably accurate manner. It would seem, however, that in many
cases where no tests of the Binet-Simon type were made, difficulties and discrepancies arose and not infrequently.
With regard to the institutional investigation, it was fairly certain in this respect that the information could
be of a verv definite character. The number of institutions dealing with mental defectives in Australia is not a large
one, probably there are not more than 50 or 60 institutions which are definitely admitting mental deficients for care
and treatment. Many of these will be found in the wards of the mental hospitals belonging to the State Lunacy
Departments, and it was obvious from the first that this return could be made of a reasonably accurate character.
For the purpose of this return, the nomenclature and definitions which have been laid down by the Royal
British Commission of 1908 were adopted, that is to say, a return was asked for classifying mental deficients into
idiots, imbeciles, feeble-minded persons, and moral deficients. The return also differentiated those cases into those
below the age of six, those from six to fourteen, and those above fourteen years of age. The number of epileptics
was asked for separately. A copy of the return which was sent to each institution is also attached to the appendix.
The survey is, therefore, a two-fold one. The (a) returns will consist of an enumeration of those children who
are mentally deficient but who are not in institutions. They are known to the Education Departments and are being
catered for in many ways quite satisfactorily, but it is obvious that the extent of the special school and class provision
is totally insufficient. Those children are the cases for whom the greatest degree of amelioration can be expected,
and a considerable portion of them will be found to respond educationally to some extent, and particularly to the
specialized education of the opportunity classes and special schools which have been established in many States.
These cases are the more important because they are particularly capable of re-actmg to good or evil influences.
r p]}o classification will include the inmates of various institutions the idiots, imbeciles and high-grade
mental defectives, who are anti-social or who are incapable of being looked after by their relatives, and who are in
any case certain to find their way into some institution or another, in which their liberty and their possibilities for
doing mischief can be restricted.
As already stated, arrangements were made with the Education Departments in the various States for the
collection of the information with regard to State schools, but as the system followed for this collection and for the
tabulation of the information received varied somewhat in each State, the following is a short resume of the manner
in which the collection and tabulation was carried out for each State, together with a summary of the number of
returns and the number of children to whom the returns applied.
New South Wales. —The investigation in this State was carried out by the medical service of the Departme.
of Education and was based on a different system to that adopted by the other States, inasmuch as the reports were
furnished by the School Medical Officers, while in the other States they were supplied by the head teachers themselves ;
hence, the New South Wales figures, based as they are on the examination by medical specialists experienced in such
intelligence testing, will not include a large number of the border-line and doubtful cases, which would certainly be
enumerated by the school teacher actuated by indifferent scholastic responses.
Considerable delay was experienced with this State, as Dr. Harvey Sutton, who was at first in of the
School Medical Service, resigned in February, and as his figures did not correspond with those furnished later by
Dr. Stewart, his successor, the figures of the latter have been adopted.
This investigation has covered but little more than one-quarter of the State school population ; fortunately,
it includes schools in the cities, suburban areas and country districts, so that it can be taken as representative of the
whole State. The number of children examined was 76,557, out of a total enrolment at June, 1926, of 29Sj3*p|7J»s
estimated by the Department. ■■sS&SS
Victoria— In this State the forms to be filled in, accompanied by instructions in the Education Gaz
sent out to the head teacher of every State school by the Education Department, and the returns handed
writer for tabulation. A large number of forms had to be returned for completion, as in many cases the head
had omitted to fill in the total number of children attending his school, without which information it was imposapll#
to obtain the percentage of mental defectives. ■ ' ’ v -


Altogether returns were furnished by 2,098 schools or 78 per cent, of the whole number, embracing 201,548
children, representing 98.5 per cent, of the estimated attendance for June, 1928. A number of small schools, which
neglected to furnish returns, were disregarded as being too insignificant to affect the total percentage.
As the returns were all analysed under the supervision of the writer, it was possible to make interesting
comparisons between the numbers of mental defectives in the city, urban, and country schools.
Queensland. —As in Victoria, the forms, accompanied by instructions in the Education Gazette were sent to each
head teacher by the Education Department. The completed forms were sent for tabulation. There were many
incompletely filled in forms, the number of children in attendance not having been given, but the Education
Department was able to supply the information itself as time was too short to send the forms back to the various
head teachers.
Returns were received from 1,447 State schools, or about 83 per cent, of the total number, and they referred
to 115,306 children. The compilation was made out showing separate figures relating to city, urban and country
schools, as was done in the case of Victoria.
South Australia. —The information regarding this State was obtained in a similar manner and tabulated by
Dr. Constance Davey, Psychologist to the Education Department, and apparently includes all the State schools,
inasmuch 5s a total of 77,476 children is reported on by her, while the total average attendance at June, 1928, is
estimated at only 73,259, the total enrolment in 1926 being nearly 85,000.
A separation into metropolitan and country schools was also made.
Western Australia. —The returns, which were given on forms issued as supplements to the Education Gazette
containing the instructions, were collected and tabulated by the Education Department in Perth. The total number
of schools from which returns were received is not given, but the Department reported that about 50 more returns
were still outstanding. The number of State schools in 1926 was 848, so that presumably about 800 returns have
been received.
Tasmania. —As regards this State, the information was collected and compiled by Dr. Morris Miller, Chairman
of the Mental Deficiency Board. Although the number of schools investigated is not given, still the survey must have
been fairly complete, as the number of children reported, viz., 28,496, exceeds the estimated attendance, though
it does not come up to the total enrolment of about 32,000.
Dr. Morris Miller states that “ The estimated percentage of feeble-mindedness at school age (Class (b) —according
to teachers’ estimates based on your criteria) is about 1.83 per cent. We expected about 2 per cent, under the
circumstances ; but according to examinations made under the Mental Deficiency Act, the percentage is nearer
0.75 per cent, for children of school age. We are of the opinion that, however the figures re percentage of certifiable
defectives vary, there are border-line and feeble-minded children comprising about 3 per cent, of the school population
that require special training ”.
Note. —In connexion with the numbers of children at State schools, two sets of figures are available in the
Commonwealth Year Book, viz., scholars enrolled and average attendance. There is a large difference between these
two sets of figures, for example, in 1926 the number of scholars enrolled was 883,925, and the average attendance was
730,571, or 82.7 per cent, of the enrolment. This is due to the fact that many children, both in the city and in the
country, are enrolled at more than one school during the course of the year, and thus get duplicated in the figures
for enrolment, the actual number of State school children would therefore lie somewhere between these two sets of
figures.
With regard to private schools, the figures are very unsatisfactory, as the furnishing of returns was purely
voluntary on the part of the authorities concerned. Through the courtesy of the Archbishops in New South Wales,
Victoria and Queensland, I was able to obtain returns from many of the Catholic schools, but with the exception of
Victoria and South Australia, no returns were received from any non-Catholic schools.
New South Wales. —The total number of completed returns received was 89, representing 9,685 children. The
total number of private schools in this State in 1926 was 704 and the average estimated attendance in 1928 was 71,510,
hence only a little over 12 per cent, of the schools and about 13.5 per cent, of the children in attendance are
represented.
Victoria. —As the filling in of the forms relating to mental deficiency was purely a voluntary matter with private
schools, it was not possible for the Council on Education to exercise any compulsion on the proprietors to send in any
returns. However, better results were obtained in Victoria than in New South Wales, but even in this State only
251 out of 484 —about 52 per cent, of the private schools —furnished retxxrns, the number of children included being
34,006 or about 58.5 per cent, of the average attendance.
Queensland. —Returns relating to 2,641 children in eighteen convent schools were received, or about 10 per
cent, of the average attendance and 9 per cent, of the number of private schools.
South Australia. —From this State the returns were more satisfactory, 122 schools out of 184, or about
two-thirds, furnished returns relating to 10,341 children, or 73 per cent., of the average estimated attendance for
1928.
tilt are untrained and in any case would be more likely to conceal mental deficiency than expose it.”
Western Australia.—No returns have been received from private schools in this State.
Tasmania. —Returns covering 3,995 children, or 77 per cent, of the total average attendance, were received
and tabulated by Dr. Morris Miller.

METHOD OF ESTIMATING TOTAL NUMBER OF MENTAL DEFECTIVES.
In order to ascertain the number of mental defectives between the ages of six and fourteen years in each State
and for each sex, several methods were tried, but the following method, which has been adopted in this report, appears
to be the most satisfactory :
(а) State Schools—The total estimated number of children attending State schools having been ascertained,
the number of mental defectives in each class has been calculated from the percentages obtained
from the available returns.
(б) Private Schools—The same method has been adopted as with State schools in such States in which
returns from private schools are available.
(c) High Schools, &c—Where returns are to hand, the same system has been adopted.
(, d ) Mental Hospitals.' —The figures.for these are complete, and have been adopted as returned.
(e) Other Institutions.—The figures for these have been treated in the same manner as those for mental
hospitals.
From the Federal Census has been ascertained the total number of children of school age ; from this survey
has been obtained returns showing the total estimated number of children attending schools and in the above types
of institutions. The difference between these two sets of figures gives the “ balance a body of children who are
apparently not covered by this survey. It is claimed that there is a portion of mental defectives m this balance,
in all probability of a similar proportion to that recognized in State schools.
Figures based on this proportion have been included in the gross totals of mental defectives.

TABLE A (4).
Comparison between Percentages of Mental Defectives among State Children of School Age in
City, Urban, and Country Schools.
Note. —City Schools include those in the Metropolitan Postal District in Victoria, those in Brisbane and suburbs
in Queensland, those in the Metropolitan District in South Australia, and those in Hobart and Launceston in
Tasmania.
Urban Schools include those with over 200 children in attendance in Victoria and Queensland, and those
with enrolments of over 100 or more in Tasmania. In South Australia urban schools are included with country
schools.
Country Schools include all schools not enumerated in the foregoing.
Owing to the fact that the numbers from New South Wales and Western Australia were supplied
undifferentiated, it was impossible to give the information concerning those States in this Table.
It will be seen that the proportion in the country districts is nearly double that of the city, whilst the urban
numbers are more or less intermediate.


SPECIAL INSTITUTIONS FOR MENTAL DEFECTIVES.
Elsewhere in this report it has been stated that the majority of the obviously defective that is to say, of
the idiot and imbecile class, are to be found in the State Hospitals for the Insane. There are, however, a few
institutions which have been established especially for this class of defective.
In Queensland, the majority of these cases are in wards in the various State Hospitals, but there are also
a few young adults in the Benevolent Asylum at Dunwich, as well as a few epileptics. In the Diamentina Hospital
for Incurables there were six obviously low-grade imbeciles of each sex.
Queensland has an epileptic colony at Willowburn ; this, although it is not on the reserve of the Hospital for
the Insane at Toowoomba, is quite close to it and for all practical purposes it might be considered as a ward of the
Toowoomba Asylum. It contained, on the occasion of the inspection by the writer, 30 male and 45 female patients.
They are all practically congenitally mentally deficient and there could be no possible objection, other than a
sentimental one, to the certification under the Lunacy Act of the majority of these patients.
A visit to the Blind, Deaf and Dumb Institution, which is governed by the State, revealed the fact that,
although an attempt is made to prevent the admission of a child whose intelligence quotient is below 80, nevertheless
a few cases are admitted who are really mentally deficient.
In Queensland it would appear that there is no real appreciation of mental deficiency amongst the prison
population, although there is a reformatory prison in the neighbourhood of Toowoomba, and it seems practically
unbelievable that all the inmates are of normal mentality. Furthermore, it would appear that there are no mentally
deficients amongst the class of women attending the Venereal Diseases Clinic, as has been found to be the case in
Victoria and, indeed, in most other English speaking countries.
In New South Wales the subject of mental deficiency has received a very considerable amount of attention,
not only from the Education Department, but also from the Health Department, the Children’s Welfare Department
and the Crown Law Department, necessarily also from the Lunacy Department. Indeed, a Bill dealing with this
subject is receiving the attention of Parliament and the Government officials.
Quite recently the Education Department has established at Glenfield a residential school, which is capable
of receiving 120 children. It is intended to run this institution on ordinary residential school lines, i.e., the children
come in for set terms and return home. Further, it is intended only to take children who show some capacity for
improvement educationally. Of the numbers in residence at the time of the visit of the writer, 20 per cent, were
regarded as having an I.Q. of below 50. The majority of the cases, however, showed I.Q.’s of 60 to 80, and two
approximated to a9O I.Q. A strong scholastic staff attended during the school hours, and during the rest of the time
the children were taken charge of by a capable staff consisting very largely of trained nurses. The dormitories and
classrooms are ideal, and good playgrounds are also provided. The boys learn gardening and the girls are instructed
in cooking. A good deal of manual training goes on —hearth rugs are made and basket work is undertaken. The
musical education of the children is a striking feature. The parents are asked to pay the very moderate sum of £35
per annum, but in many cases where they cannot pay, a less amount is accepted. The institution is under the
direction of a trained psychologist, and practically all the staff are expert in their particular work.
If Glenfield is to remain as an institution for this class of case, it could easily be established as the ideal
training school for those teachers who are going to undertake the special care and education of the mentally defective
child. It is not easy to find teachers with the requisite knowledge, and it would be a wise step to make arrangements
for other States to send probationers to Glenfield for this purpose. There appears to be no very good reason why
suitable cases from other States should not be received, even if higher rates be paid.
The Lunacy Department has established at Newcastle an institution for mentally defective children. There
is, however, in this institution a small sprinkling of adults. On the occasion of the writer’s inspection, there were
220 cases in residence ; 70 children go to school, and there is a strong nursing and teaching staff in constant attention.
Although the institution is an old one, it has been renovated and brought up to date, and the care that is extended
to the inmates is of the highest order. There are, unfortunately, a very large number of hopelessly idiotic children
who require constant attention at the hands of the nurses.
In connexion with the Children’s Welfare Department, there are smaller institutions for various classes of
mental defectives ; for example, at Brushfarme there were 52 girls in residence, seven of whom were morons, 23 were
classed as high-grade imbeciles, and 22 low grade. This institution consisted of an old homestead with 11 acres of
ground. It is admirably situated and has a competent staff, but there is comparatively little done in the way of
scholastic education; however, the children are made extremely useful in running the institution.
At May Villa is a similar institution, which consists of two houses grouped together for 22 boys in all; seventeen
were in school, but the majority were not likely to achieve much advance educationally. The eldest boy was fourteen
and the youngest eight. They are taught certain handicrafts, and five boys work in the garden. These boys are
looked after almost entirely by a married couple ; there'is, however, a visiting teacher and a cook.
At the Mittagong Keformatory Colony, one block is set aside for mentally defective boys.
There is a private institution in one of the suburbs of Sydney wherein 40 cases are looked after. Considering
the fact that they are mostly Mongols, the care of these children is commendable, and the house reasonably adequate
and the training good.
In South Australia there is one special institution for mentally defective patients, and that is Minda. On
the occasion of the visit of the writer, there were 209 patients in residence ; 70 were quite elderly mental defectives,
57 were between the ages of 16 and 21, and there were 82 under the age of sixteen ; of these, 25 were in the babies’
cottage. Of the total number, 21 were epileptic. From 60 to 70 go to school, and for this purpose, there were two
teachers, one of whom has had considerable experience in England. There does not appear to be any legislation
extant which gives the Minda authorities power to legally detain any mentally defective individual.


The institution is remarkably well situated, being placed close to the sea, but luckily on good ground. The
consequence is that the farm and garden showed excellent results, the majority of the work being undertaken by the
bigger boys. Whilst there were a few good wards, the greater part of the institution was not entirely prepossessing,
and it would appear that more training and teaching is essential. The sanitary spurs, so absolutely necessary in
institutions for this class of defective, struck one as being inadequate and badly kept. The training of the children
as to habits does not start at a sufficiently early age, and for this reason alone better sanitary arrangements are needed.
There were a very large number of Mongols, who are not, as a rule, capable of any considerable degree of educational
advancement.
It would appear that there is a proposition to reconstruct and send to a country farming colony the older
imbeciles, retaining Minda for younger cases, and especially for those who are capable of education. This would seem
to be a very sensible step, inasmuch as Minda appears to be over-crowded and considerable renovation is required
in connexion with the kitchen, laundry, and administrative offices.
In South Australia, there are certain other smaller institutions, such as the McGill Boys’ Reformatory, which
shelters 69 boys, seven of whom were definitely morons, and fourteen might be described as dull.
At the Angus Home, Parrafield, blind, deaf and dumb cases are accommodated, varying in number from
20 to 30. Those are all returned as mental deficients.
The State Hospital for the Insane at Parkside shelters a fairly large number of congenital mentally deficient
cases, but they are all suitably accommodated, although not in special wards.
Western Australia. —Whilst a very definite advance has been made in the establishment of a State Psychological
Clinic, as yet there has been comparatively little done to provide special accommodation for mentally defective cases.
The State Hospital for the Insane at Claremont holds a considerable proportion of mental deficients, the majority
being unsuitable for special institutions other than Claremont.
There is an institution, the Seaforth Home, which is run by the Salvation Army a few miles from Perth, and
in it is a special school for 45 boys. Their ages range from twelve to eighteen years ; after they reach the latter
age, they are no longer retained and are discharged, but apparently ther } is no definite provision for them when they
have to leave. The boys are graded in two classes —there are 21 in the top class and these are doing particularly
good manual work ; carpentry, basketware, and sea grass furniture is undertaken. The lower class is in process of
some form of education of the kindergarten type. The building generally is not particularly suitable.
Under the direction of Miss Stoneraan, the Roman Catholic Church is building a special school at Casfcledare.
It is proposed to erect three cottages, which will contain from fifteen to eighteen, and the patients will range from
the age of eight to eighteen years.
There does not appear to be any special accommodation for female defectives at present, although some are
maintained in certain orphanages and homes.
The evidence tendered to the writer appears to show that there is necessity for special institutions, inasmuch
as there are nearly 100 cases accommodated in the homes abovementioned.
Tasmania— Although this State has led the way in the matter of legislation, and possesses a Mental Deficiency
Act as well as a Mental Deficiency Board, of which Dr. Morris Miller is the Chairman, it would appear that nothing
worthy of the name has been provided in the matter of accommodation for mental defectives.
At the mental hospital at New Norfolk, there is a special cottage for idiot boys, but it is anything but
satisfactory. A few imbecile girls are in a ward on the female side, but there is urgent need for a special block to-
be erected to accommodate all these cases.
At the infirmary at Newtown, which has been declared under the Act as an institution for defectives, there
are a few imbecile boys and girls, and the Hobart Gaol has been declared as an institution for criminal defectives.
At Ashley, near Deloraine, there is a school, which has not been proclaimed as a special school for defectives, to
which a few boys of fairly high grade are sent under the guardianship of the Superintendent.
Victoria. —In the State Hospitals for the Insane and in the private licensed houses there are approximately
1,050 cases of congenital mental deficiency, amounting to idiocy or imbecility. Whilst there are many of them
scattered throughout the institutions in appropriate wards, the Children’s Cottages (Idiot Asylum) atKew are responsible
for the care and treatment of 420 cases.
This institution is in process of reconstruction, and recently the Department has recommenced the educational
training of the high grade cases. There is a very large proportion of idiot cases, and there is practically no limit put
to the age at which children can be admitted, the consequence is, this institution receives from the Children’s Welfare
Department and the Children’s Hospital a very large number of idiot babies, quite incapable of benefiting from any
form of training or treatment. As will be referred to elsewhere in this report, the proportion of these cases, which
are believed to be due to inherited specific diseases, is very high —probably as much as 50 per cent.
At Mont Park there is a block which contains accommodation for 40 patients, and this is used for the custody
of grown up male imbeciles, who are employed very largely on the farm and in the gardens at Mont Park.
Two outside cottages at Ararat are also used for the same class of patient.
It is generally found that the grown-up imbecile girls can be made of considerable help in the kitchens and
laundries of the various institutions, and-this is very markedly the case at Kew, where the main laundry and the
Children’s Cottages’ kitchen are carried on with patients’ labour, materially diminishing the employment of paid staff.
2030.—2


In the depot of the Children’s Welfare Department at Royal Park there is also invariably to be found a
number of-congenital mental deficients. A report from the Medical Officer to the institution shows that there are
77 defective, of whom 42 are male and 35 are female ; 23 are under six years, 23 are between six and fourteen years,
31 are over fourteen years —of the latter, six are regarded as moral deficients.
Epileptic Colony.—At Clayton, on the Mason’s Meadows Estate, there is a colony for the care of epileptics, and
it contains 150 patients, of whom seventeen boys and thirteen girls are adjudged as mentally deficient. This institution
was founded some twenty years ago, and is called after its founder —Lady Talbot. The institution is extremely well
conducted and economical, but it would appear that there is an increasing accumulation of very demented patients,
the majority of whom are certifiable, but there is no legal power to detain them. The colony has a charter empowering
it to exist, but it has no legislation to control it or endow it with active power.
Originally it was intended for the admission of those epileptics who were not markedly affected in mind, or
who were not definitely congenitally mentally deficient; it is not a disparagement of the institution to say that the
original intention of the founders is impossible of perpetuation. When a case is admitted to such an institution as
this, it may prove somewhat difficult to obtain removal unless the patient becomes actually dangerous ; the
consequence is the institution becomes burdened with an increasing number of demented and incurable cases.
Moreover, it is extremely improbable that sane or intelligent epileptics will seek for shelter in an institution which
has become notable by the class of demented patient one invariably finds in it.
A special cottage has been set aside for returned soldiers who have become epileptic, and this cottage more
closely approximates the ideals of the founders. Accommodation for twelve soldier cases is available, and generally
that number is to be found in residence. These patients have very considerable liberty given them, and much is
done by the Red Cross Society for their amusement and occupation.
In Victoria, beside certain schools belonging to the Education Department, which will be afterwards referred
to, there are two private schools where defective children are accepted, but at present they do not come under any
official cognizance.
SCHOOLS FOR MENTALLY DEFECTIVE CHILDREN.
Beyond the residential school established by the New South Wales Education Department at Glenfield, there
are certain other day schools and classes which have been established for the education of mentally defective children.
The first of these was established in Victoria in the yea; 1913. The Bell-street School, Fitzroy, was the first of these
day schools, and it now receives from 40 to 50 scholars who come for special training from the neighborhood. The
second school was established at Montague, and this school receives about the same number, and has exactly the same
function® as Bell-street. Besidp these two day schools, there are in Victoria a very large number of special classes,
or as they are called, “ opportunity classes,” wherein backward children receive education of a specialized character
from trained teachers, and these classes have developed a routine appropriate to the character of the children they
receive. In Victoria there are actually 38 of these excellent classes ; 33 scattered through the metropolitan area,
and five in the principal country towns.
The Education Departments in other States have followed this procedure and there are special classes attached
to six schools in the metropolitan area of Sydney.
In South Australia, under the direction of Dr. Davey, these schools have been established, and there are now
opportunity classes to the number of fifteen, teaching 292 children. In South Australia no teacher takes more than
twenty cases, and they are all female teachers. Of the children attending these schools, some are retarded or dull,
but by far the greater majority of them are definitely defective, though not delinquent. From most of these cases,
the boys go to work in the wood-shops attached to the schools ; music is made of considerable use, and simple
handicrafts.
In Queensland, there are five such opportunity classes —one at Buranda for 22 boys, where there is one male
teacher. In this school they specialize in basket work and carpentry. At the South Brisbane School, there is a special
class for 75 ; they are mostly little boys and girls, and three teachers are continually engaged. Many of these
children are retarded and subsequently find their way back to their appropriate class.
In Tasmania certain schools have been developed for this class of work. One school (Elizabeth-street) has
special classes, both for boys and girls. The boys attend carpentry classes.
The writer saw no instance of special classes or special day schools in Western Australia, but although
opportunity classes have been established in six schools, it does not seem that these classes are quite on the same
scale as the opportunity or special classes in other States. In Western Australia the classes appear to be more for
retarded and dull cases, rather than mental deficients.
To revert to the two special schools in Victoria, namely, Bell-street and Montague —during the sixteen years
the former has been in operation and fourteen years in the case of Montague, there have passed through Bell-street
384 boys and 182 girls, making a total of 556, and through Montague, there have passed 216 boys and 88 girls,
making a total of 304.
The question arises as to which is the better method —special schools or special classes. It is obvious that
special classes will be more economical in more sparsely settled districts, but everything appears to point to the
greater value of the special school from the point of view of efficiency. It should be pointed out that backward and
defective children vary and require classification just as normal children do, and that teachers will have to deal
individually wirh children of different grades of understanding. Moreover, in a special school there will be an economy
in the use of necessary equipment and material, and again, in special schools better opportunities will arise for
instruction in manual and vocational training.

STATISTICAL CONCLUSION.
Allowing for the difference in the method of examination between New South Wales and the other States, the
writer considers he is justified in stating the percentage of mental deficients in the whole of Australia at 2.89 per
cent. ; this includes all classes from the deeply idiotic to the border-line cases, for whom specialized training and
education is essential. If, however, the figures are taken as they have been returned, the percentage will be 2.12 per
cent., and this will give a final estimate of 22,217 persons between the ages of six and fourteen years who are
mentally deficient.

With regard to school children, if Professor R. J A. Berry’s findings in the cases sent to him for investigation
can be taken as a guide, then 60 per cent, of the returns by the teachers will be definitely defective, 20 per cent,
doubtful and 20 per cent, normal, and it would appear reasonable to reduce the total number by 20 per cent, at
least, and on this calculation the number of mentally defective State school children would be :
No reduction has been made to the New South Wales figures, as they are based on medical examination and
not on teachers’ estimates.
It should be mentioned that these figures are based generally on the average attendance at State schools,
which, as already stated, differs from the enrolment figures, and that the exact total number of children attending
State schools is not known, but lies between the enrolment and the average attendance figures, hence the estimate
for the number of mental defectives in State schools given above is below the mark.
Note. — That the ratio of male to female mental defectives is as ten to seven, and further that the proportion
in the country is twice as great as in the city population.
INVESTIGATIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES.
The most important investigation into the subject of mental deficiency is undoubtedly that of the British
Royal Commission which was commenced in 1904, and which published its findings in 1908. The general result of
its inquiries showed that there were 0.8 per cent, on an average of mentally defective children throughout England
and Wales, and 1 .24 per cent, in city areas.
If one may be permitted to criticize such a monumental wnrk, one might with justice hazard the opinion that
the percentage of feeble-minded was under-estimated. For example, Dr. Francis Warner, of the Royal Sanitary
Institute, London, in a six-years’ investigation examined 100,000 children. He concluded that 1.6 of his first series
and 0.88 of his second series needed special care and training. His inquiries, however, went further, and he
investigated the question of dullness or retardation and found that this was 6 per cent, higher, and he believed that
such a degree of dullness warranted special educational provision other than that to be found in an ordinary school.
Again, in England a Departmental Committee of the Board of Education examined 150,000 children in
Birmingham, and a similar number in Manchester, and found a percentage of 1.12 in Birmingham and 1.24 in
Manchester, who could be regarded as definitely mentally deficient.
In Switzerland, an investigation of 490,252 school children revealed 7,667 cases who w r ere mentally enfeebled,
that is to say, 1.5, and this figure excluded idiots and low grade imbeciles ; whilst another 6,000 children were
regarded as dull and in need of special class work.
These figures are supplied merely to contrast with those presented in this report.
INQUIRY IN AUSTRALIA.
Following the meeting of the Australasian Medical Congress in Sydney in the year 1911, a Committee was
formed to report on the extent of mental deficiency in this country. The object of the campaign was to educate
the public and various Governments and to attempt something in the shape of a census. This was undertaken in
each of the States separately and a general report was presented to the Congress meeting in Auckland, New Zealand,
in 1914.
The difficulties which have arisen in the present survey were experienced even to a greater extent in that
undertaking. New South Wales withheld its returns, and none were available from Western Australia and New
Zealand ; but in Victoria, out of an approximate population of 230,000, 1,162 were regarded as definitely feeble-
minded, and 3,500 were regarded as dull. In South Australia, out of 55,000 children attending the State schools,
550 were regarded as definitely feeble-minded and 1,800 as mentally dull. In Tasmania, out of 20,000 attending the
State schools, 125 were returned as feeble-minded and 547 as undoubtedly dull.
A subordinate return on the question of the educability of children not attending school showed that there
were 229 children who were regarded as defective but educable, and 247 who were non-educable.
The reason given for the defection in the matter of the returns from New South Wales was said to be due to
the following facts :
(1) That the number of “ mentally dull ” children in the public school returns was abnormally large as
compared with other States of the Commonwealth, and was presumed to be exaggerated by the
■teachers, owing to their minds being perplexed by recent State inquiries relative to retardation.
(2) When the school classes, in which these alleged “ mentally dull ” and feeble minded children appeared,
were scrutinized, it was found that in many instances a child was marked mentally dull or even
feeble-minded when he was actually in a school class whose average age exceeded his.

On the other hand, in Victoria, Dr. Harvey Sutton investigated se\eral schools subsequent to the census taken
at that time in order to check the figiires. He found in practically every instance that the teachers had under-stated
the prevalence of intellectual defect, often by 50 per cent.
This may be taken as a very striking commentary on the figures which the writer has received from New
South Wales, as contrasted with figures resulting from the more thorough investigations undertaken in all the
Southern States, particularly in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania.
The difference between the returns from New South Wales and the other States is explained by the fact that
the examiners in New South Wales have classified their cases into —
(а) Definitely mentally deficient.
(б) Probably mentally deficient.
(c) Suspicious cases (very retarded, &c.).
It is conceivable that these definitions do not accurately coincide with those which' have been selected for
the purposes of this inquiry, and which are seh out in the form printed in the Appendix attached to this report.
RECENT INVESTIGATIONS INTO EXTENT OF MENTAL DEFICIENCY IN AUSTRALIA.
Victoria.— lt is desirable that reference should be made in this report to the inquiry which has been undertaken-
by the Anatomy Department of the University of Melbourne.
Professor R. J. A. Berry and his staff, together with Mr. S. D. Porteus of the department of Education,
commenced in 1917 to examine school children with two objectives :—(1) to ascertain the normal brain growth in
the living boy and girl from six years of age into the third decade of life, and (2) the association of this physical
growth with mental deficiency. At that time some 10,000 school boys and girls were examined, and several valuable
publications have been issued setting out the results of this inquiry. '
Of more recent years, the actual inquiry into mental deficiency has been assisted by grants of money made by
the Edward Wilson Trust. A series of tests were devised and carried out by Professor Berry and his colleagues, and
the following factors were investigated : —the cubic capacity of the brain, the standing and sitting stature, the
weight, grip, and vital capacity. To these were added the Binet-Simon and Porteus intelligence tests.
The result of this elaborate research was to create a standard whereby the children and individuals tested could
be correctly classified with respect to their physical growth, mentality, education, and attainments, and this standard
proved to be of extreme value in the work subsequently undertaken by Professor Berry and his assistants in the
examination of a large number of suspected abnormals. No less than 1,541 cases were brought before the investigators,
and 1,280 of these were submitted to a complete and full examination. The results show that 742 cases were diagnosed
as mental defectives, 266 cases were placed in a deferred diagnosis group, and 270 cases were returned as normal. It
may be assumed that 60 per cent, of the cases were feeble-minded, 20 per cent, were border-line cases, and a further
20 per cent, were of normal intelligence.
The majority of these examinations were undertaken at a clinic which had been established at the request of
the Honorary Medical Staff by Professor Berry at the Children’s Hospital, but clinics were also functioning to a less
extent at the Melbourne Hospital and at the North Melbourne Children’s Court, and for a time at the Children’s
Welfare Depot, Royal Park.
The co-operation of the medical man and the educationalist proved to be of the greatest value, and furthermore,
the appointment of a social worker who could investigate the home conditions of the child was also of value in
determining what could be done for the case under review.
The results of this valuable inquiry clearly demonstrated how necessary it is to establish a Psychological Clinic
in each State ; whether it is to be known as such or under the name of “ Child’s Guidance Clinic ”, does not
particularly matter ; or whether it should be wholly attached to the Education Department or to the Children’s
Court, or some other Branch of the Public Service is immaterial, so long as a clinic is established which will have the
power of co-ordinating the work of the various Departments interested in this subject.
Western Australia. —The next development in this direction to which it is necessary to make reference is that
of the State Psychological Clinic of Western Australia. In July, 1926, the Health Department of Western Australia
established a State Psychological Clinic in the Observatory Buildings, and Miss Ethel T. Stoneman, M.A., who was
also a lecturer in Psychology in the University, was appointed to the position of Director, who has the advantage of
collaboration with the Chief Medical Officer of the Children’s Hospital and the Inspector-General of the Insane.
Cases are sent for examination from the Education Department and various institutions, and quite a considerable
number of cases come privately to the Clinic. Examination has been made of certain prisoners, and Miss Stoneman
has re-standardized tests which she considers to be peculiarly adaptable to the needs of the children of Western
Australia.
In her report for the year 1927-28 Miss Stoneman summarizes the work which has been done by her in the
way of examining the children brought before her. It may be as well to give a summary of her work from her report: —

As a result, Miss Stoneman recommends the establishment of homes for defectives, farm colonies, &c., and
special provision for epileptics, inasmuch as the proportion of cases needing special care and attention amongst those
she has examined is high. In her report, Miss Stoneman states that in a total of 1,229 children in various schools,
there was a proportion of 2.5 per cent, whose I.Q. was below 70, and that the percentage of mental defect, more
serious than that indicated by an I.Q. of 70 per cent., was 1.8, but this figure excludes all low grade imbeciles, idiots,
and all defectives who are still further handicapped by major epilepsy. The number of such cases would probably
add .58 to the index. Miss Stoneman goes on to say that, as the total school population of Western Australia
comprises some 52,900 children, the number of defective individuals for whom special education is urgently necessary
is about 1,500, and she makes the pertinent query —“ How long is the progress of about 50,000 normal boys and girls
to be delayed and impeded by the attempt to force 1,500 handicapped children to do the impossible ? ”
New Sout}> Wales. —In this State what virtually amounts to a State Psychological Clinic has been established
in connexion with the Children’s Court, which is presided over by a Police Magistrate (Mr. Fincham), who devotes
the whole of his time to this class of work. He has the assistance of the Medical Officers of the Education
Department, as well as Educationalists who have had psychological training ; he has also at his behest the assistance
of social workers who belong to the Clinic, which is actually an activity of the Crown Law Department.
Associated with the Clinic is a shelter, and in the year 1927 there were as many as 2,564 admissions, and it
appears that the numbers are growing year by year. This shelter finds accommodation for as many as 55 boys who
are under the observation of the Court. They are detained there whilst their mental and physical condition is
investigated, as well as their home environment and their past record.
There is a smaller shelter for girls, but it is at some distance from the Court, which also controls a small farm
school for truant boys.
The procedure of this Court seems to be most efficient, and well worthy of re-duplication in the other States.
Mr, Fincham estimates that 4 per cent, of the children presented at the Court are mentally deficient.
THE CAUSATION OF FEEBLE-MINDEDNESS.
This condition rnav be simply described as a failure in brain development, and the causes of such failure are
many, but the principal of them are :
(a) An inheritance from neuro-pathic or psycho-pathic progenitors, which would be accentuated by a
con-sanguineous marriage. The mating of a normal parent with a feeble-minded one will most probably produce
some degree of feeble-mindedness in some of the offspring, but where two feeble-minded persons mate, it is practically
certain that all their descendants will also be feeble-minded.
Tredgold claims to find such an inheritance as a factor in 80 per cent., which denotes a very close and searching
inquiry into the families of his patients.
Dr. Eyan, of the Children’s Cottages, Kew, submits the following table of his inquiries recently made into
this subiect; —
The column “ Nervous Instability ” is the result of personal contact with the parents ; if one extended it to
other relatives, the figures would be higher.
“ Physical Disability ” includes Cancer, Phthisis, Heart Disease, &c., occurring in more than one of the patients’
antecedents.
(6) A tubercular history is said to be very common in the genealogical tree of many mentally deficient
individuals, but there are in Australia no very definite statistics which will demonstrate this statement.
(c) Alcoholism is frequently stated to be a cause of mental deficiency, and cases are on record showing that
children pro-created during a period of an alcoholic debauch are likely to be deficient.
(i d ) The influence of syphilis is probably of more importance from the hygienic stand-point than any other cause
or factor. An inquiry by the late Dr. W. A. T. Lind, of Victoria, into the causation of epilepsy revealed the fact
that the lower grade imbeciles who were also epileptic very generally exhibited post mortem changes which were
almost certainly syphilitic. He further observed that a positive Wasserman reaction was obtainable in almost 50 per
cent, of the children admitted to the Cottages for mental defectives at Kew, provided that the Wasserman was taken
sufficiently early in life ; but a report by Dr. Ryan, from the same institution, shows only 48 positive reactions in
a succession of 2fo cases.
In connexion with the State Psychological Clinic at Perth, Dr. J. Bentley, Inspector-General of the Insane
for Western Australia, stresses the necessity for the examination of the blood in the case of all mental defectives sent
to the Clinic.


The Lunacy Department of New South Wales has conducted an inquiry into the blood condition of 1,652
mentally defective persons scattered through the various institutions in that Department. A plus Wasserman
reaction was returned in 40 cases who were also epileptic, and 123 cases who were not epileptic ; 27 other cases were
returned as being indefinite.
Roughly speaking, it may be stated that 10 per cent, of the cases who are permanently segregated in the
New South Wales State Hospitals as mental deficients owe their defect to a syphilitic inheritance. Unquestionably
with the lower grade cases the proportion would be very much higher.
(e) Encephalitis Lethargica.—Whilst it was extremely unlikely that there would be the same number of cases
affected in Australia as appears to have been the case in the Old World, it was thought advisable to find out to what
extent this disease was responsible for admissions to State institutions. It must be remembered that in Great Britain
so many cases exhibiting mental deterioration and defect occurred as a result of the wide-spread nature of the epidemic,
that it was necessary to establish special institutions for their reception and care. Indeed, an amendment in Bills
before the British Parliament of the definition of “ Mental Defective ” was projected, and in the opinion of the
writer, very unwisely so, in order that cases of weak-mindedness and other mental abnormalities due to this
infection might be brought within the scope of the Act. It would appear to bring many cases of Dementia Praecox
into the category of mentally defective persons.
Inquiries were made in the various States, and in Queensland, South Australia, and Tasmania, there were no
replies showing that the condition was sufficiently wide spread to merit any special attention ; but in Western Australia
Dr. Bentley had reported several cases in the Australia Medical Journal, and he gave it as his opinion that there were
still further cases, but unrecognized. In New South Wales the Metropolitan General Hospitals had knowledge of some
150 cases diagnosed as due to Encephalitis Lethargica, but there was very little definite information obtainable as to
what became of these cases. It was considered that some 20 to 30 might have found their way into the mental
hospitals, but quite a large proportion of the number originally recognized were said to have died. In Victoria the
same condition of things exists, but possibly to a less extent. There are in the State Hospitals for the Insane at the
present time not more than half-a-dozen cases whose causation could be said to be due to Encephalitic Lethargica ;
but the Board of Health reports the notification in 1926 of 18 cases, of 13 cases in 1927, and 23 in 1928 ; 35 were
notified in the metropolitan area, and 19 from country districts. There is, however, no attempt made to follow up
these cases by the Department at present, but it is anticipated that this work will be undertaken.
(/) Hook Worm.—Whilst in Queensland the question was raised as to whether this disease could be regarded
as one producing mental deficiency, Dr. R. W. Cilento obtained a report on this matter, and from this it would appear
that, whilst it was certain that hook worm infection would produce retardation, it was also practically certain that
it would not be the cause of definite mental deficiency. Doubtless many mental defectives have been affected by
hook worm, but the probability is that their mental deficiency would render them prone to hook worm infection.
(g) There are other causes of less importance, in so far as they act less frequently, such as mental derangement
occurring in the pregnancy of the mother, abnormal labour, post natal convulsions, and nutritional defects in early
infancy.
If one accepts this very simple statement on causation, the question next arises as to what steps should be
taken to prevent these causes from continuing to be reproductive in our nation. Very wide and important social
problems arise, but the following active steps appear to be indicated :
(1) The detection and segregation of the mentally deficient person, with arrangements for their appropriate
training and guardianship.
(2) Sterilization of the unfit.
(3) Legislation on the marriage problem by which only those individuals who are fit mentally and physically
to enter into wedlock should be permitted to do so.
(4) The elimination of syphilis from the community.
(5) The prohibition of alcohol, or at least, the enforcement of laws providing for its use rather than its
abuse.
RECOMMENDATIONS.
(a) Psychological Clinics.—The writer. desires to recommend that in each State a Psychological Clinic
should be established for the examination of all mentally defective children and young adults. The Clinic should
comprise a Medical Practitioner, who is experienced in diseases of children, an Educationalist, who has had
psychological experience training, and a Medical Practitioner with experience in psychiatry, and a staff of social
workers. The best way to make the Clinic efficient is to attach it to a Children's Court.
The establishment of residential schools for high grade mentally defective children, who, on admission, should
not be more than twelve years of age, or less than five. Such children, if they exhibit possibilities of improvement
by the special character of education undertaken in such residential schools, could remain until they were seventeen
or even eighteen years of age. Glenfield, in New South Wales, is a type of school of this character.
In addition to these residential schools, the special day schools, such as Bell-street and Montague in Victoria,
should be continued, and where it is impossible to establish such day schools, the special or opportunity classes
functioning in so many of the ordinary State schools, principally in Victoria and South Australia, should be continued.
Residential colonies for adults, who are capable of a certain amount of manual, industrial, and domestic training.
These colonies would necessarily be in the country, and they should be used for the permanent segregation of those
cases who are not suitable subjects for guardianship outside an institution.
A system of boarding out, or guardianship, should be undertaken, and it should be worked in conjunction with
the residential colonies.
Special blocks for hopeless idiots will require to be provided, as is the case at present in connexion with the
State Hospitals for the Insane, failing the establishment of special institutions to accommodate all mental defectives.
(b) The British attitude to the question of sterilization may be considered a conservative one, but it is based
on a genuine belief that it is not likely to be generally effective, and not infrequently ill results to the individual will


follow, and that, although many individuals with mild degrees of defect, and who are not immediately in need of
preferab] ) e na dang6r in the matter of procreation, segregation and guardianship are infinitely
In America, however, sterilization has been placed on the statutes of many States, principally in California •
nut it would seem that in most of the States the practice is being discontinued.
Quite recently in New Zealand the Department of Health conducted an inquiry into the.question of mental
detectives and sexual offenders, and sterilization was investigated. A Committee appointed for this purpose advised
that the information at present available was inadequate to permit of a sound and final judgment as to the value
of the procedure. •
The writer considers that sterilization will never be resorted to in any of the countries of the British Empire
until the economic pressure, arising from the increasing burden of lunacv and mental deficiency, has become very
much more acute than it is at the present time.
(c) With regard to the question of the right to marry, it is interesting to note that, as long ago as 1891, the
Oregon legislature passed a law providing that a marriage licence would not be issued to any one having communciable
or_ contagious venereal disease, or very low mentality, unless one or both of the couple were rendered sterile. Upon
is being referred to the voters, the law was disapproved. From that time on, and even to-day there are many
advocates for such a drastic step. It is hardly likely that, with our present views on the liberty of the subject such
a law will be passed and put into effect.
[d) It would appear that the modern treatment of syphilis is having some effect. To show that this may be
the case, the writer would draw attention to his Annual Report of the Lunacy Department for 1927, in which
he shows that the incidence of General Paralysis of the Insane has diminished nearly one-half in Victoria during the
last fourteen years, and the figures of that report seem to show that the fall in the numbers received into the State
hospitals of V ictona follow the introduction of the treatment of syphilis by salvarsan and its allied remedies. He
argues that, if this is true of General Paralysis, it will certainly be true of other syphilitic manifestations also.
• * ! € } \ ltn ard to the United States of America is making an experiment that must be of the greatest
interest to the whole world. Whether or not the inhibition of alcohol is going to produce a virile race, it is impossible
to say. Jt may be worth while quoting from the results of an intensive survey which is being made by the State
Department of Mental Hygiene in New York. Dr. Pollock' says, with regard to a demand for increasing institutional
accommodation for mental cases, that a turning point has been reached with regard to the first admissions of those
suffering from alcoholic psychoses. The report, he says, showed a downward trend from 1909 to 1920 • in 1921 the
percentage began to increase and reached 7 per cent, in 1927, the highest since 1917. In 1928, however’, a significant
rS e t: Ar r , the admisslons > both absolutely and relatively, showed a decrease, the numbers declining from
054 to 509 and the percentage from 7to 5.9. This is a very small change about which to be optimistic.
It would appear from the American statistics, which have been borne out by the Victorian, that during the
war years and for a short time subsequently, there was an appreciable decrease in intemperance ; that, however
appears not to be the case in Australia to-day. The numbers admitted to inebriate institutions and the number of
convictions for drunkenness are increasing year by year, and without going to the length of penalizing the population
as a whole, it appears desirable that chronic offenders in the matter of inebriety should be dealt with much more
i nr n appears to be the case at present, and that protracted residence in penal establishments, if necessary
should be prescribed for those in whose cases medical treatment has proved to be unavailing.
i ■ °. rder . bat a l ust appreciation of the subject of mental deficiency by the medical profession may be
achieved and in view of the possibility in future legislation that medical practitioners of experience in Psychology
and I sychiatry alone may be responsible for certification, it is desirable that greater effect may be given to the teaching
of these sublets in our various universities, and particularly to the Diploma of Psychological Medicine, which has
been established by the University of Sydney.
It is unlikely that such a diploma can be established in all our universities, the number of candidates coming
vwu 'o 11 ? t 0 be Sllfficient to do more than kee P the one diploma going. Arrangements should be made
with the Sydney University to receive graduates from Melbourne and Adelaide for an intensive course of study
which will enable them to present themselves at the former university for this diploma.
i .•¥ A ? d T al aB9l s tance to the States in this matter is desirable, although it may be difficult to devise a scheme
by which such help could be given without interfering with the existing methods.
There are 50,000 invalid pensions in force at the present time in the Commonwealth, and although there is
no exact knowledge as to what proportion of these pensions are given to mentallv deficient persons, there is reason
to believe that something like 10 per cent, of the pensions are given for that purpose ; and there is practically no
method of inspection m order that the Federal Government mav discover whether the pension is being used to the
best advantage. " °
One might here instance the condition of things which exists in Great Britain. There, the Central Government
contributes to the Local Government help both in the matter of mental disorders and mental deficiency. With
regard to the former, there is an exchequer grant of 4s. per week paid for each patient who is detained in asylums
such as are maintained by the county and borough rates. The councils of the counties and boroughs are burdened
with the necessity of providing institutional accommodation and they are assisted by this 4s. grant in the case of
lunatics, and 50 per cent, of the net approved cost is paid by the Central Government to the local authorities for
carrying out the statutory duties in connexion with mental deficients.
tbe appendix of this report is attached a statement concerning the Mental Deficiency Service in England
and Wales, which sets forth the way in which the Mental Deficiency Acts are conducted in the Old Country.
MENTAL DEFICIENCY AND CRIME.
Although this subject is far too large a one to be dealt with exhaustively in this report, it would be improper
to omit any reference to it. r r
In the first place, it may be as well to stress the fact that mental deficients are not necessarily bad but that
owing to their suggestibility, lack of control and foresight, they are undidv influenced by their environment and
up-bringing.


For years it has been realized that in the prison and reformatory population there is a considerable number
of subnormal individuals, and that a proportion of these are definitely feeble-minded. Of the juvenile offenders at
Pentonville, England, Dr. Parker Wilson informed the Royal Commission sitting in 1908 that about 100 prisoners
a year were so far mentally affected as to be quite unfit for prison discipline, and that beside these, no less than
20 per cent, of the prisoners showed mental inefficiency. Altogether 18 per cent, of the population of the prison were
regarded as feeble-minded.
In the Birmingham Prison, Dr. Hamblin Smith investigated 325 inmates, and he came to the conclusion that
23 per cent, were mentally deficient and another 20 per cent, were subnormal.
Dr. Healey of Chicago examined 1,000 young repeated offenders, and he found that 419 were below the normal
mental status of their age, and of these 69 were definitely insane, 8 were imbeciles, and 170, i.e. 17 per cent., were
definitely feeble-minded.
Comparatively few systematic investigations have been made in Australia on this subject, but perhaps the
most satisfactory investigation to demonstrate the importance of this subject will be to quote the results which have
been arrived at in the investigation conducted by the schoolmaster at the Castlemaine Reformatory, which is as
follows :
The number of youths to whom the Binet Intelligence Tests at Castlemaine has been applied, now totals 362,
and the results are as follow :
Intelligence quotient under 70 .. .. •• ..14 per cent.
Intelligence quotient 70to 79 .. .. •• ..21 percent.
Intelligence quotient 80 to 89 .. .. . • ■ ■ 25 per cent.
Intelligence quotient 90 to 99 .. . • • • 22 per cent.
Intelligence quotient 100 to 109 .. ■. • • .. 10 per cent.
Intelligence quotient 110 and above .. .. 8 per cent.
This analysis shows that 35 per cent, of the inmates had intelligence quotients below 80, indicating subnormality
in intelligence. Included in this number are many of border-fine feeble-mindedness, and others who are definitely
feeble-minded. 14 per cent, are shown to have an intelligence quotient below 70, indicating a very low type of
mentality. While not certifiable under the Lunacy Act, these low grade defectives constitute a problem in the
reformatory, and help to present the results of the Board s work in an unfair light. Such a class would be excluded
from the Borstal Institutions in England, and from reformatories like Elmira in America. They should be treated
in separate institutions here.
LEGISLATION IN AUSTRALASIA.
Until quite recently the management of such cases as were definitely regarded as imbecile has either been
left to the Lunacy Department of the various States, or else has been carried on without any legislative enactment
whatsoever.
Tasmania was the first State to pass an Act dealing with the mentally deficient as distinct from the insane
person, and at the present time Bills are contemplated in New South Wales, Victoria, and Western Australia. South
Australia and New Zealand had in operation an Act bringing all cases of mental disorder and defect under its
provisions, but recently in New Zealand this has been amended by a special Act creating a Department of Mental
Hygiene.
An analogous position is found in South Africa, where a Mental Hygiene Department, under the direction of a
Commissioner, deals with both lunacy and mental deficiency, and the report of this official deals with the question
as though it was one and indivisible. In his last report, Dr. Dunstan emphasizes the value of the reports supplied
by the Psychiatrists of the Department to the Education Department, and he has inaugurated surveys to determine
the areas most retarded mentally and by intensive study to discover the causes of the retardation and suggest remedies;
and further, to determine what number of children in each town or district requires to be taught and trained in the
special schools or classes.
Necessarily this work can be undertaken without any legislation, but the subsequent handling of those children
who are found to be definitely mentally deficient is one which cannot be divorced from the powers conveyed by an
Act of Parliament. So far as Australia is concerned, it is essential that whatever legislation is put into effect, it
should be similar in each State, and that reciprocity between the States and their individual Departments should be
made possible.

EXTRACT FROM THE VICTORIAN EDUCATION GAZETTE.
Mental Deficiency.—Return to be Forwarded.
In connexion with the investigation being carried out by Dr. W Ernest Jones, under the sent
Commonwealth Government, to ascertain the probable amount of mental deficiency m Australi a om be g
to every school in the State for completion by the head teacher.. For the guidance of m
return, the following statement has been prepared. It should be read carefully m conjunction with the directions
on the printed form :
Preliminary Description of Mental Deficiency.- By mental deficiency is to be understood the mental <=on«Mjon
that means that as compared with other individuals of the same age and approximately equal opportunities a given
indivhiuaHs markedly tacking in ability to conduct h.s affairs efficiently. It is shown
as lack of ability to master intellectual tasks, especially those of the problem type, in inability to profit by experience,
in lack of capacity to plan ahead or to assume responsibility or to meet new situations in an mte g _ 7-
Distinction between Mental Deficiency and other Mental Abnormalities.— Mental deficiency must be distmguishe
from insanity and milder conditions of the same general type. Though a menta ly deficient person also have
intellectual and emotional disturbances approaching more or less closely to those typically found in th ,j ,‘" a ■
the exception rather than the rule to find both types of abnormality present in the one mdividuah The mentally
deficient individual is often emotionally stable, and is rarely subject to delusions abnormal fears, and so on.
is eccentric in his behaviour or “ queer ”in his ideas or beliefs. The insane person is often capable
of quite good intellectual achievement, and has usually developed normally during childhood, whereas the typically
mentally deficient individual shows marked slowness in development from birth. The msane
are often limited to particular times and particular subjects, whereas the subnormality of the mentally dehcient
not relieved by periods of recovery, and affects the performance of all mental tasks which really require g .
Grades of Mental Deficiency .—lt is incorrect to think of mental deficiency as being separated by a definite
gap from intellectual normality. It has been established that the number of individuals markedly decreases as we
pass from normality down to the lowest degrees of mental deficiency. The drawing of the line to mark the upper
Cts of dSe deficiency is to some extent a matter of arbitrary decision. It seems necessary, however to define
the limits of the groups so that, for a random selection of the genera population, there will be a majority th
cases at normal levels of intelligence, a somewhat smaller number of individuals in a group which we can call
rather than definitely mentally deficient, and a still smaller number of cases which are
in greater or less degree. Owing to the fact that no means of judging intelligence are infallible, there will always be
a number of cases about whose classification we cannot feel certain. We thus speak of a group of border-line cas
lying between dullness and definite deficiency.
Criteria of Mental Deficiency .—I . Mental Tests—An individual who has had normal school opportunities,
who is tested by a properly trained examiner, and whose performance on a standard test of intelligence is less tha
seven-tenths (1.Q.70) of the performance normal for his age may be regarded as definitely mentally deficient if: from
his general behaviour, school achievement, and so on, there seems reason to doubt his normality. This can be set
out as follows : , n ,
q n 7 9 .. 11 .. 14 and older
Actual age in years .. .. 3 .. 5 .. I •• 9 J to 10
Approximate mental age .. Z .. o 2 ■ • ° 2 2
For example, a child of five who is mentally retarded 1 years or more, a child of eleven who is mentally retarded
3£ years or more, and an adult whose mentality does not pass the ten-year old level, can be regarded as mentally
deficient.
2. Educational Achievement.-For various reasons school achievement and grading will be a less certain
indication of mental status than are mental tests. It is extremely unlikely that a child s educational performance
will be better than is to be expected from his intelligence, but it frequently happens that it is POOTer lrregu ar
attendance lack of interest in school work, sensory defects, weakness in one particular subject, difficultly
behaviour, are all factors tending to make school performance, or estimates based on it, lower than they ought to
be If however, none of these factors are operative to any serious degree and a child s school grading, when based
on actual performance and not on age, is two or more grades lower than is normal for his age when he is ten y
old, or is three or more grades lower by the age of fourteen, then it can be suspected that such a child is mentally
deficient. ,
3 Vocational Ability.—For older individuals, failure to learn a trade, even though attempts have been made,
and marked inability to retain a job for any length of time particularly if associated
of ability in the conduct of his own affairs, may be regarded as evidence of mental deficiency At the same tim
ability to give continued satisfaction in quite unskilled and routine work is not inconsistent with mental deficiency.
I Appearance.—This is one of the least dependable criteria of mentality It is true that more bodily defects
and peculiarities are found among the subnormal than among the normal, but neither their presence nor their absence
can L rebed on as sole criterion in any case. Their presence can only be regarded as confirmatory of other lines of
evidence In the one type of case where appearance is used in the diagnosis, viz., Mongolism, which is marked by
somewhat Oriental features, short stubby fingers, Ac., the deficiency is always so marked as to be obvious on grounds
other than appearance.
5 General Development of Behaviour.—lt is characteristic of the mentally deficient that they are d ehmtely
retarded in their mastery of the forms of behaviour and control common to human beings. A child who by the ag e
of 3 1 vears has not acquired clean habits, has not commenced to walk or to talk, can be suspected of mental defect.

of mental deficiency speech is never developed. In many cases of higher, but still quite marked defect the deficiency
could never be detected from ordinary conversation ; in some cases there may be a glibness which even gives an
appearance of brightness. It should be noted that good and even remarkable powers of rote memory are not
inconsistent with recognizable mental defect. On the whole, mental deficiency is accompanied by slightly less than
average ability with the hands, but marked manual ability in work in which the demands are muscular rather than
intellectual is at times found in cases of mental deficiency.
APPENDIX “B.”
FORM FOR RETURN RELATING TO MENTAL DEFICIENCY (IN STATE SCHOOLS).
Suggested mode of procedure in compiling return (particularly in schools) :
(1) Select for consideration children whose educational performance is very definitely below average {see
para. 2 of Criteria of Mental Deficiency, p. 190, Education Gazette , August, 1928).
(2) Consider in each such case whether the child’s educational standard may have been adversely affected
by ill-health, irregular attendance, &c., and if this seems likely and there is no other evidence of
mental defect, do not include such cases.
(3) If mental tests results are available, see whether each case to be considered falls below the limits
suggested in para. 1 of the Criteria.
(4) In cases where applicable, inquire into vocational efficiency as suggested in para. 3 of the Criteria.
(5) If mental tests and school records are not available, consider general development as indicated in
para. 5 of the Criteria.
(6) “ Problem ” (disciplinary) cases should not be included unless there is sufficient evidence on other
grounds that mental deficiency is present.
Any individuals thus retained should be grouped as well as possible under the classifications indicated below :

On behalf of the Commonwealth Department of Health, and with the sanction of the Ministers concerned in
this State, a return of the number of mentally deficient persons is asked for from all institutions such as mental
hospitals, State hospitals (benevolent asylums), orphanages, epileptic homes or colonies, blind, deaf and dumb
institutions, reformatories, or special homes for young offenders, schools for backward and defective children, &c.,
in the Department of the Ministers concerned. The return should be completed within fourteen days from receipt
and forwarded in duplicate to the office of the Inspector-General of Insane, Old Treasury Buildings, Spring-street,
Melbourne.
Ofiicers-in-charge making the returns are requested not to include cases of insanity such as dements, but only
those cases who betray defect of mental development from birth or from a very early age in accordance with the
definitions set out hereto.

DEFINITION OF DEFECTIVES.
The following classes of persons who are mentally defective shall be deemed to be defectives for the purposes
nis return ;
(a) Idiots. —That is to say, persons so deeply defective in mind from birth or from early age as to be unable
to guard themselves against common physical dangers.
(h ) Imbeciles. —That is to say, persons in whose case there exists from birth or from an early age mental
defectiveness not amounting to idiocy, yet so pronounced that they are incapable of managing
themselves or their affairs ; or, in the case of children, of being taught to do so.
(c) Feeble-minded Persons. —That is to say, persons in whose case, there exists mental defectiveness which,
though not amounting to imbecility, is yet so pronounced that they require care, supervision and
control for their own protection or for the protection of others or, in the case of children, that they
appear to be permanently incapable by reason of such defectiveness of receiving proper benefit
. from the instruction in ordinary schools.
(i d) Moral Defectives. —That is to say, persons in whose case there exists mental defectiveness coupled
with vicious or criminal propensities and who require care, supervision, and control for their own
protection or for the protection of others.


APPENDIX “D.”
MENTAL DEFICIENCY SERVICE IN ENGLAND AND WALES.
The statutory basis is the Mental Deficiency Acts, 1913 to 1919. The Act of 1913, which was passed as a
result of the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the Care and Control of the Feeble-minded, makes
“ further and better provision for the care of the feeble-minded and other mentally defective persons ”.
The central authority is the Board of Control, in which the Lunacy Commission (the central authority for
lunacy) was merged on the passing of the Act of 1913. Subject to the general supervision of the Minister of Health,
the Board is charged with the general superintendence of matters relating to the supervision, protection, and control
of defectives, including the administration of the Government Grant, the certification and approval of institutions
and the management of State institutions for defectives of dangerous or violent propensities.
The local authorities are County or County Borough Councils (or combinations thereof). They exercise their
duties and powers either through, or on the report of, committees constituted by themselves under conditions
prescribed by the Act.
The local authorities’ duties relate to mentally defective persons who come within section 2 (1) (6) of the Act.
In brief these persons are defectives :
(i) found neglected, abandoned or without visible means of support, or cruelly treated ; or
(ii) found guilty of any criminal offence ; or
(hi) detained in prisons, reformatory and industrial schools, lunatic asylums, or criminal lunatic asylums ;
or
(iv) habitual drunkards ; or
(v) notified by the Education Authority, viz., ineducable children between the ages of seven and sixteen
and children about to leave residential special schools at age sixteen who require continued detention ;
or
(vi) unmarried mothers in receipt of poor relief at the time of pregnancy or confinement.
The local authorities are enjoined to “ ascertain ” these defectives and to provide suitable supervision (i.e.
home visitation or training at centres) ; and to provide institutional care or guardianship (i.e., care by a specially
appointed person) for defectives in whose cases an order of detention has been made. This order, which can only
be made if the defective comes within section 2 (1) (6), is made by the Home Secretary, or a Criminal Court, or a
judicial authority, as the case may be.
These duties only arise if a Government Grant of not less than one-half the net cost, as approved by the Board,
is forthcoming.
In view of the present financial stringency, the provision of institutional care is, by departmental action,
restricted to such of the above-mentioned classes as come within the Board’s definition of “ urgent ” cases. Moreover,
the Board are unable, save in every exceptional circumstances, to approve any fresh schemes involving capital
expenditure for the provision of institutions by local authorities.
Local authorities also have permissive powers enabling them to pay, or contribute towards, the expenses of
providing institutional care or guardianship for defectives not coming within section 2 (1) (6). Expenditure in respect
of the exercise of permissiveppo r ers does not rank for Government Grant.
The duties of ascertainment and supervision are carried out by local authorities under approved schemes
either by existing officers or by specially appointed officers. In many instances voluntary societies, aided by grants
from the local authorities and the Board, give valuable assistance in this work. Institutional care is provided either
(a) in “ local authority ” institutions, i.e., institutions established and maintained by local authorities alone or in
combination ; or (6) in “ contract ” institutions, i.e., institutions provided by voluntary bodies or Poor Law
Institutions in which accommodation for defectives has been specially approved by the Board.
The extent to which local authorities are carrying out their duties varies considerably owing largely to war
and post-war conditions, which have restricted the establishment of institutions by local authorities.
The Central Authority, through the administration of grants, approval of schemes, contracts, plans, and
estimates, certification of institutions, and local visitation, exercises a close supervision and control over the work
of local authorities.
Expenditure is controlled by the submission of schemes and annual estimates. Rates of charge at “ contract ”
institutions are regulated by contracts which are approved by the Minister of Health on the advice of the Board ; and
the expenditure in respect of “ local authority ” institutions is closely scrutinized and checked by costings and by local
visitation.
Inquiry is made in every case to secure that, wherever practicable, a contribution towards the cost of maintaining
defectives in institutions or under guardianship is obtained from the defective or from any person liable or willing
to contribute.
The Board have established a State Institution for dangerous or violent defectives at Rampton. The institute
accommodates 368 patients. Pending the provision of additional beds, a block at Warwick Prison, formerly ■
for inebriates, is being utilized for 42 female patients.
The approximate total number of defectives in respect of whom local authorities had, or were likely to .
obligatory duties on the 31st December, last, was :
Under supervision .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ~ 10,700
In institutions .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 10,100
Under guardianship .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 350
21,150
Action not yet taken .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 3,750
Under consideration .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 3,350
Total number “ ascertained ” .. .. .. .. .. .. 28,250
These figures do not include “ permissive powers ” cases (175) or cases chargeable to Education Authorities,
Poor Law Authorities, or private persons.
Although there is no trustworthy information as to the total number of “ defectives ” in the country to-day,
the Board estimate the number to be not less than 40,000.
