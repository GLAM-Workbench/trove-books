SILVER WATTLE.
No. i.
Poets to us discourse in vain
Of the Laburnum’s golden rain ;
We will praise the softer showers
Of Australia’s fairer flowers.
i Do this in faith, for everything
Of beauty hath in faith its spring.
2 This flower lifts its banner blue
Against the heaven’s paler hue.,
3 Fruit, boasting a celestial birth,
Not greatly prized on common earth.
4 Sweeter than Juno’s eyelids, and as fair
As are the orbs beneath those lids, I swear.
5 Sweet, bright, and fair, we flowers call;
Alas ! this also are they all.
6 But though that’s true, some flowers never fade, „
«of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made.”


No. 2.
At the thought of my second with pride doth glow
The heart of my first, and his praises flow.
1 He’s not the first, altho’ he wears the ermine and the band.
2 For reasons scientific this enterprise was planned.
3 Oh, wretched murderer, see thy victim’s agony.
4 How few obey this call compared to those of yesterday.
5 A fair isle of a Northern sea whose praise is known in
song.
6 In this the gfasping group is seen their durance hard
and long.
7 Not best of Oxford’s crews am I, but well-known from
the throng.
Fern.
No. 3.
It rests in peace, it says, “ Whatever is, is well.”
Nothing can please, and none can satisfy;
All are in fault, and everything is wrong.
1 Add me, O Builder, ere thou say’st thy work is done.
2 Mine is a bed which none begrudge me nor would wish
to share.
3 Sweet, yet strong and powerful.
4 Thy taste is good, thy spirit pure, although the world
may call thee old.
5 Ever backward, never forward.
6 He takes no part with either side, but stands to watch
the play.
7 Under the earth you must search for me.
M. E. W.


No. 4.
My second as he taught my first, bestowed
More seemly habits on the madding crowd.
My dusky crew unfurl at e’en
To catch the gale, the broad lateen.
For me they sweat, and slave, and sell;
I’m slang, but indispensable.
On my quadrisyllable breast
Do weary travellers rise to rest.
Some touch of nature bids me stay,
And faintly cling to broken clay.
I now define, with varying taste,
Now merely indicate a waist.
No. 5.
A lovely country, free and bright,
Where all a home can gain ;
Ever the cause of truth and right
May she promote, sustain.
But tho’ so bright, and free as air,
Perfect she cannot be :
Discomforts these that somewhat mar
Human felicity.
1 “High, holy, happy ! stainless as a star,
Imperishable as eternity.”
2 Emblem of peace, Athena’s gift to men.


3 “A new planet swims into our ken.”
4 “ The trumpets blew, and then did either side,
They that assailed and they that held the lists,
Set lance in rest.”
5 “ Calm on the seas, and silver sleep
On waves which sway themselves in rest,
And deep calm in that noble breast
Which heaves but with the heaving deep.”
6 “ I oft delivered from his forfeitures
Many that have at times made moan to me ;
Therefore he hates me.”
7 “ Then fierce the hero o’er the threshold strode,
Stript of his rags he blazed out like a god,
Full in their face the lifted bow he bore,
And quivered deaths, a formidable store.”
8 Name of an old and graceful form of dress,
Two silent vowels at the end suppress.
9 The day is fixed, great are the efforts made
To have the bridal finery displayed.
10 “Tremble, let them tremble; I am their master,
Claudia.”
11 “ There dwelt the lily-maid Elaine.”
12 “ Come, go with me, peruse this as thou goest;
Fair Jessica shall be my torch-bearer.”
13 “ But in it there were three tall trees,
And o’er it blew the mountain breeze.”
14 “‘O first of Greeks,’ Ulysses thus rejoined,
‘ The best and bravest of the warrior kind.’ ”


No. 6.
An English poet, and his chief work.
1 “ Placed on high amid the tuneful quire
With flying fingers touched the lyre.”
2 “ There is a spot of earth supremely blest,
A dearer, sweeter spot than all the rest ;
Here woman reigns.”
3 “ Did ever maid or spouse,
As fair as my beloved come,
To rest beneath thy boughs ?”
4 “ And the imperial votaress passed on
In maiden meditation, fancy free.
Yet marked I where the bolt of Cupid fell.”
5 “ That’s a brave God, and bears celestial liquor,
I will kneel to him.”
6 “ Were the last words of Marmion.”
7 “ Then I, mingling despair with love, bethought
of the robe
The Centaur gave me, and the words he spoke,
Forgetting the deep hatred in his eyes.”

“ Fiercer and louder blew the blast,
A gale from the north-east,
The snow fell hissing on the brine,
The billows frothed like yeast.”


“ She struck where the white and fleecy waves
Looked soft as carded wool,
But the cruel rocks they gored her sides
Like the horns of an angry bull.”
1 E’en to the happiest, this is nigh.
2 Hark ! it reverberates thro’ the sky.
3 High in the air King Henri’s banner waved.
4 A faded flower treasured up and saved.
5 He wore it ever, day and night the same,
Lodged in his prison, no one knew his name.
No. 8.
Great Moralist, whose tender heart and true
Gigantic intellect, sound sense and clear,
To all mankind, from China to Peru,
Throughout all time thy memory must endear.
What owe we not to him who, to thy sphere
Admitted, thenceforth reckoned it to be
His crowning glory therein to appear ?
His vanities with lenient eyes we see,
And pardon all his follies for his love of thee.
i Without discretion valour hath small gain ;
The master, whom this warrior served with skill,
Loth during his own life to do him ill,
Yet left directions that he should be slain.
2 On every tree he carves her name with sighs,
Yet when he meets her does not recognise.


, A hundred years and more ere Luther s fame;
For the same doctrines one had given his liie ;
His followers, who called them by his name,
Avenged his death by long and bloody strife. _
a The time to do a kindly deed, a duty unattractive ,
To succour those who are in need, to be alert and active,
c A witty writer still with pleasure read,
His gains came quickly, faster yet they sped.
6 Ancestral wisdom such a verdict found—
She swims, a witch ; she’s innocent if drowned.
7 ’Gainst us these dusky chiefs no grudge did bear
That we a portion of their land should share ,
In peace they dwelt and reverenced our sway,
And, but for us, had done so to this day;
Their subject brethren are faithful still,
Why should we then of all the race speak ill.
No. 9.
“ Thou from whose unseen presence the leaves dead
Are driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing:
Yellow and black, and pale, and hectic red,
Pestilence-stricken multitude !”
1 “ That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.
2 “ The languid light of your proud eyes
Is wearied of the rolling hours \
In glowing health and boundless wealth,
But sickening of a vague disease.”
•2 « Inferior to the vilest now become m
Of man and woman; the vilest here excel me.
4 “ Boil thou first in the charmed pot.” C H M


No. io.
There falls a first, beyond a doubt,
To everybody’s share ;
The last a fancy fabric is
Both beautiful and rare;
The total round the first is worn
By many a lady fair.
Applies to anything at all pertaining to the nation.
A subtle question which to solve requires consideration,
Relating unto comedy, provocative of mirth.
As cutting in its action this as anything on earth.
Alpha,

Brave spirits ! worthy of the name !
What obstacles they overcame j
Who from their Fatherland withdrew,
“ To seek fresh fields and pastures new.”
Their flocks increase, their welfare grows,
The desert blossoms as the rose,
And here a new “ sweet home” they find,
As dear as that they left behind.
1 Oh ! gentle nine ! from yonder heights,
Assist me in my humble flights.
2 “ Love’s image upon earth without his wing,
And guileless beyond hope’s imagining.”
3 The night departs, see where the rosy dawn
‘ Opens the purple eye-lid of the morn.”
4 “ Bespangled with those isles of light,
So wildly spiritually bright.”


5 Light, buoyant, delicately fair,
Belonging to the realms of air.
6 The hour the weary labourer longs to see,
« when lowing herds wind slowly o er the lea,
n “ Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge
He overtaketh in his pilgrimage.”
8 Whose deathless fame will never cease,
A stranger to domestic peace.
No. 12.
My first of greater value is
Than wealth or even fame.
My next a quality which brings
Reproach, derision, shame.
1 At the last fatal scene, he too must be there.
2 This as a prohibition weighs.
3 A pretty soft wrap of feminine wear.
4 A prophetess of ancient days.
5 A nice occupation for hands of the fair.
No. 13.
We are used to songs of triumph,
Not to moans of loss and woe.
When our sons go forth to battle
Tis to victory they go.
Many a field of fame and glory
In blazon proud our banners bear,
Many a great and noble story
Of England’s might is written there.


Now alas ! triumphant music
Changes to a mourner’s wail;
And with blood upon the banners
Glory writes a sadder tale.
Ah ! those banners ! saw they never
Greater cause for England’s pride,
Than when beyond the fatal river
Their guardian heroes on them died.
No. 14.
A woman’s heart, a student’s brain, combined,
insight amazing, purpose high and true
Produced this strange, sad book, in which we find
I he unworldliest woman fiction ever drew.
i How wearisome are trees that never fade
In spring no grace, in summer heat no shade.
I heir dingy winter hues are dearly paid.
Home of law, and royalty,
City roughs, and misery.
Outcast from society.
Weapon of old chivalry.
Cushioned and luxurious.
Singular, not curious.
By hedge divine surrounded.
O’er ocean wave she bounded.
Music grandly swelling.
Royal country dwelling.
Tiresome in dresses.
Dwells in wildernesses.
Tired eyelids close we,
On her breast repose we. M.H., 1879


2 Five people’s councillors, whose powers were great,
They held the purse and fortunes of the State,
And even fined their king, because his bride
Had not the stature claimed by civic pride.
■2 A seat of learning ; even in British days _
Kings have endowed it, poets sung its praise.
4 Victorious returns the gallant knight.
Falsely reported to have fallen m fight,
Alas ! the lovely maid he comes to wed
Behind the convent walls to him is dead,
e Devoted daughter ! at the dead of night,
Through the churchyard she goes, m fears despite,
Concealed in yon deep vault her father lies,
And she, while others sleep, his wants supplies.
c A foolish boast has stirred Olympian hate,
Jove darts his lightnings at her lord, and she
Casts her upon his blazing pile to be,
Even in death, the sharer of his fate.
7 Spring o’er its bare boughs throws a tender haze,
Shady and green it stands through summer days
In autumn, flicked with gold, it charms our gaze.
8 Notorious, even in a wicked time, _
To raise her son she went from crime to crime,
And, when the Imperial crown his brow adorned.
She, for reward, was cast aside and scorned,
g To conquerors the laurel crown,
The olive wreath that brow should wear.
Whose bloodless triumphs all may share,
Successful labour earns renown,

Whence a fair southern province takes its name.
