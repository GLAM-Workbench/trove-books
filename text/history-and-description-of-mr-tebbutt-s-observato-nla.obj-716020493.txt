HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION
THE WINDSOR OBSERVATION.
At the eastern extremity of the municipal town of
Windsor lies the Peninsula Estate, a tract containing about
250 acres of the richest alluvial land. It is so called be-
cause it is nearly surrounded by the courses of the Hawkes-
bury Kiver and its tributary the South Creek at their con-
fluence. On a hill situated a little south-west of the
middle of the Estate, and whose summit is about fifty feet
above the local mean tidal level, stands the residence of
the author, with the two Observatories now to be described.
Occasional astronomical observations, necessarily of a rough
character, were made by him at his residence from 1854 to
1864, the instruments employed being only a sextant, an
artificial horizon, a telescope of If inches aperture, and a
common but excellent eight-day clock with seconds pendu-
lum. These were employed chiefly for the purpose of self-
instruction and for providing gratuitous information of a
popular character for the daily newspapers. To these in-
struments were added a refracting telescope by Jones, of
3f inches aperture and 48 inches focal length in November,
1861, and an excellent eight-day half-seconds box-chrono-
meter by Parkinson and Erodsham, No. 1042, in April,
1864. At the close of 1860 a small observatory was
erected on the western side of his residence, the walls being
constructed of pine and the roof covered with slates. The
building comprised a transit-room, with two meridian piers
and their corresponding openings in the walls and roof, and
likewise a prime vertical room. The local, mean time was


determined by means of a transit instrument made expressly
for the observatory by A. Tornaghi, of Sydney, and mounted
in September, 1864. The telescope is supported between the
pivots, and originally had an object glass of 2*l inches
aperture and 20 inches focal length. The object glass was
broken in June, 1874, and was replaced by another of two
inches aperture and a greater focal length. The setting
circle is affixed to one end of the axis of the transit. The
graduated limb is of silver and 5J inches in diameter ; the
divisions are each equal to 20', and are subdivided by opposite
verniers to 20". The distance between the pivots is 12
inches. The instrument was originally provided with a
heavy metal stand, similar to that belonging to the Uck-
field Observatory and represented on page 653 of Chambers’
Descriptive Astronomy , Ed. 1867. This stand was firmly
secured to the eastern pier and was thus employed till a
double pier was erected at the western end of the building
in 1867. The instrument was now provided with Y’s
secured immediately to the stone caps of the pier, one ad-
justable for level and the other for azimuth. Beneath a
trap door in the floor of the building the main body of the
pier supported a trough of mercury employed in connexion
with a Bohncnberger eyepiece and a level for determina-
tions of collimation error. The metal stand before men-
tioned was subsequently transferred to the prime vertical
pier for latitude observations and again restored to its ori-
ginal place on the eastern pier. The transit system origi-
nally consisted of five threads crossed at right angles by
two other threads about 2' apart. The equatorial distances
of the threads from the mean of the threads in mean time,
are according to the latest determinations : —A= + 33 5 *593,
B= + 16 S *6o6, C= +0 S *l79, D=—l6 5 *922, E=—33 5 *456. The
letters are in the order of a star’s transit above the pole
with the setting circle east. The threads were accidentally
destroyed in November, 1867, but were at once replaced
by the maker with another system consisting of. seven
threads. The latest determinations of the equatorial dis-
tances in mean time of the new threads from the middle
thread gave the following results :
i ii hi v vi VII
+50 5 *793 +32 5 *744 +16 5 *277 -16 s *l33 -34 s *oo6 -51*471
+50*176 +32*439 +l6*oßo -15*903 -33*649 -50*846


the first set corresponding to the old and the second to the
new object-glass. The telescope has four eyepieces, namely,
an ordinary positive eyepiece, a diagonal eyepiece, and two
Bohnenberger eyepieces. It was originally furnished with
a striding level divided to tenths of an inch, each division
being equal to 15" # 9. In reading this level the divisions
were sub-divided by estimation to tenths. In December,
1875, a more delicate level, the workmanship of Troughton
and Simms, was supplied by the Messrs. Flavelle Bros., of
Sydney, the value of each division being 1"*1. The pivots
of the transit instrument, so far as can be determined by
means of the level, are not perfectly cylindrical, and the
circle pivot is much smaller than the lamp one. Various
corrections for inequality of pivots have been employed and
the most recently adopted value is 2"* 8. A lamp was origi-
nally provided by the maker for the illumination of the tran-
sit threads. Owing, however, to some defect in the adjust-
ment of the reflector in the telescope tube, the arrangement
has never been satisfactory. The illumination was there-
fore effected by means of a circular concave reflector at-
tached to a ring on the object end of the telescope. The
transit instrument is readily transferred from one set of V’s
in the meridian to another set in the prime vertical. On
the bank of the South Creek, south of the Observatory,
stands a meridian mark corresponding to the western or
double pier before described. A stout iron-bark post is
sunk perpendicularly into the ground to the depth of about
five feet, its top being nearly level with the northern sloping
surface of the bank. About six inches below the top a
piece of white porcelain is let into the post, and over this
is secured a plate of copper painted black, with a circular
hole in it about a quarter of an inch in diameter. The
porcelain is thus seen through the perforation from the
Observatory as a small white spot on a black ground.
This spot long served as a meridian and collimating mark
for the transit instrument, its centre from the most recent
observations being 7"*7 east of the meridian. From Sep-
tember, 1861, to September, 1879, the chronometer was
regulated to mean solar time. In computing the mean
times of the transits of the clock stars, the sidereal time at
Greenwich mean noon, as given in the Nautical Almanac,
was diminished by Im. 39T05., the correction correspond


ing to the adopted longitude, lOh. 3m. 15*7s. E. This
value of the longitude depends on that derived for the
Sydney Observatory, (See Sydney Ast. and Met. Ohs.,
1861, p. 82.), combined with an approximate determination
by telegraph of the difference between Sydney and
Windsor. Notwithstanding the imperfections of the in-
strumental means, every precaution was taken in the work
of observation so that the error of determination of the local
mean time, from a set of transits on any evening, could
hardly exceed half a second. A small octagonal tower
rising from the centre of the Observatory, and covered by
a conical revolving roof, accommodated the 3f inch refractor
already referred to. It was mounted by the author him-
self in 1864, according to the Sissons or old English
method, and with sufficient accuracy to enable him to
identify stars of comparison. It has a finder, and had
originally six eyepieces, namely, one terrestrial or erect-
ing eyepiece and five negative eyepieces with magni-
fying powers ranging from 30 to 120 diameters. It was
furnished with two ring-micrometers by Tornaghi, and with
this telescope all the extra meridian observations were made
till the acquisition of a 4f inch equatorial in June, 1872.
In 1874, a circular building of pine, twelve feet in di-
ameter, was erected a few yards south-east of the Obser-
vatory already described, for the temporary reception of the
latter instrument. This telescope was purchased from
Anthony Hordern, Esq., of Sydney, for whom it was made
in 1870, by Cooke and Sons, of York, but was then unpro-
vided with micrometers of any kind. Its object glass has
a clear aperture of 4f inches and a focal length of 7 0 inches.
It is mounted according to the Fraunhofer method and is
adjustable to any latitude. When it came into the posses-
sion of the writer it was mounted on a firm wooden tripod,
but was at once transferred to a temporary wooden plat-
form in the equatorial tower of the Observatory. In
August, 1874, it was removed from its temporary position
to the circular building above mentioned. The polar axis
and the socket or bearing of the declination axis are formed
of one piece of metal. The telescope, which carries a finder
of If inch aperture and 15 inches focal length, is secured
in its cradle at one extremity of the declination axis and at
the other extremity are the declination circle and counter


poise. At the lower or north end of the polar axis is the
hour circle, five inches in diameter. It has a double set of
divisions on its edge, and when clamped revolves with the
polar axis, and when unclamped is revolved on the axis by
means of a milled head. Above this circle is a fixed ver-
nier whose zero is in the meridian, and below it is another
circle fixed to the polar axis, not graduated, but carrying
another vernier whose zero coincides with that of the upper
vernier when the telescope is in the meridian. The hour
circle is divided on brass to two minutes of time, and these
divisions are again read off by a microscope and vernier to
five seconds. The declination circle is five and a half
inches in diameter and is divided on its brass edge to
30' and subdivided by two verniers to single minutes. The
graduation expresses declination. The telescope is provi-
ded with the usual arrangements for clamping and slow
motion in right ascension and declination. It had origi-
nally two diagonal eyepieces, one a Cooke first surface re-
flexion prism and the other a Herschelian reflector, also a
transit eyepiece, a comet eyepiece, a terrestrial eyepiece,
and six negative eyepieces with powers of 55, 80, 120, 180,
265 and 400 diameters, and the usual dark glasses for ob-
serving the sun. The two ring-micrometers formerly em-
ployed with the 3|- inch refractor were at once adapted to
the instrument. In April, 1879, a position filar micrometer
and apparatus for illuminating the threads in a bright field,
were received from the Messrs. Cooke, through the Messrs.
Flavelle, of Sydney. The position circle is about 3| inches
in diameter and is divided on silver to single degrees and
by opposite verniers to tenths of a degree. The micro-
meter screws each carry a single thread, their heads being
divided on silver into 100 equal parts. An inner brass
circle registers the number of whole turns of each screw.
One of the threads is brought into the axis of collimation
of the telescope and usually regarded as fixed and therefore
kept at a constant reading. One revolution of the adopted
moveable screw is, according to the best determination
from transits of circumpolar stars, equal to 29"*688. This
screw has been carefully tested at every revolution through-
out its length and found to be satisfactory. The position
threads consist of two 14" apart and one of them is em-
ployed as the transit thread in differential observations of


right ascension. The exact perpendicularity of these
threads to the declination threads, as well as the mutual
parallelism of these latter threads themselves, has been
carefully verified. The micrometer is furnished with four
eyepieces having powers ranging from 90 to 325 diameters.
The illuminating lamp is suspended in a crutch affixed to
the side of the telescope tube, and is provided with the
proper arrangement for insuring its constant vertically and
for colouring the light. The illuminating arrangement has
always given complete satisfaction, but there being no
means of exhibiting bright threads on a dark field, all faint
objects were until the close of 1881 observed by means of
the ring-micrometers previously referred to. It is, how-
ever, well known to astronomers that it is only under cer-
tain conditions which cannot always be secured, that
differential measures with this form of micrometer yield
satisfactory results. Since 1881, the use of the ring, ex-
cept in one particular instance, has been abandoned, and
for the observation of faint objects a square bar-micrometer
has been substituted. This micrometer, which was made
by the Messrs. Cooke, was received at the close of April,
1882. It is similar to that designed by Graham, and
described on page vi of the Introduction to u Cooper’s
Catalogue of Ecliptic Stars.” At the request of the author,
however, threads were stretched between the opposite
angles of the square to serve for ready and accurate ori-
entation of the micrometer. The lengths of the diagonals
reckoning from the intersections of the middle lines of the
bars is, according to numerous careful observations of pairs
of well determined stars, equal to 1522"*8. It was found
that when the adopted declination thread was made coinci-
dent with a parallel of declination there were errors of
difference of right ascension amounting to several tenths of
a second of time in the case of stars whose difference of
declination was considerable. A thorough investigation of
the errors was made and a table formed for facilitating the
calculation of the corrections of differential right ascension.
No appreciable error is experienced in the determinations
of differential declination. It is found that observations
with this form of micrometer are more convenient and re-
liable than those with the ordinary ring. All the extra-
meridian observations involving measurement, from 1873


down to 1886, have been made with the equatorial just des-
cribed.
In 1879, a substantial Observatory of brick was erected
a few yards south-west of the old building. From the
centre of a large room at its west end rises a pyramidal
pier of brick and cement which passes through the ground
floor and a floor above. To this pier the 4± inch equatorial
was transferred at the close of August, 1879. The instru-
ment has remained there down to the present time and is
protected by a galvanized-iron roof revolving on ten wheels
on a circular plate faced with iron. The opening in this
roof extends from horizon to horizon and is closed by six
shutters, two of which open outwards and the others inwards.
The apartment under the equatorial room serves as an office
and computing room. On the south side of this apartment
is the prime vertical chamber with its pier, and on the
eastern side the meridian transit room for time observations.
The meridian room is furnished with an excellent transit-
instrument made for the Observatory by the Messrs. Cooke,
and mounted on a substantial pier in September, 18/9.
The instrument is of that form which has the telescope
between the pivots and is mounted on a heavy metal frame
standing on the pier, the whole frame being adjustable for
level and azimuth. The object glass has a clear aperture
of three inches and a focal length of thirty-five inches.
The setting circle is of brass with a graduated limb of silver
about five inches in diameter. It is secured to the eye end
of the telescope and is supplied with a level and two
opposite verniers read off by microscopes. The divisions of
the limb are 20' and these are subdivided by the verniers
to 20". The readings are zenith distances. The telescope
has three ordinary positive eyepieces with powers of 45,
70, and 90, and a diagonal and Bohnenberger eyepiece,
with powers of 60 and 30 respectively. The level is a
delicate one with a radius of curvature of about 1130 feet,
and its divisions are on the tube and extend as far as fifty-
two each way from the centre. Each division has been
found equal to 0"*8. By means of the level, which is a
striding one, the inclination of the axis of the transit-instru-
ment can be measured between the limits of 25 and 154
degrees of zenith distance. The pivots are sensibly cylin-
drical and equal, and the distance between them is 18


inches. The transit system consists of five threads designa-
ted as A, B, C, D, E, in the order of transit above the pole
when the clamp is east. The equatorial distances of the
four outer. threads from the middle thread in mean and
sidereal time have been recently determined as follows :
Threads. Mean Time. Sidereal Time.
A +l9-455 +l9-508
B +9-759 +9.786
D -9-971 -9-998
E -19-592 -19-646
The reduction for a complete observation of an equatorial
star at the upper culmination, clamp east, is therefore
—O-070 s. The threads are illuminated by a lamp standing
on a shelf near one of the pivots. The light falling on a
lens in one of the pivots passes down the hollow conical
axis of the transit and is brought to a focus on a small re-
flector in the middle of the central cube, thence it proceeds
down the tube to the transit system. The piers of the
equatorial and transit-instruments are substantial, and are
remarkably free from sudden fluctuations of level consider-
ing the nature of the foundation, which consists of clay and
loam. Both piers are built on a substratum of pitch and tar
to prevent the rise of damp. It is remarkable that from
April, 1882, to May, 1885, the eastern pivot of the transit-
instrument gradually rose, so that on several occasions
during that period it was found necessary to lower the
pivot in order to keep the inclination within measureable
limits. The following is a record of the adjustments made :
—April 29, 1882, 13"-3 ; June 15, 1882, l0"-9 ; September
14, 1883, 9"-6 ; February 26, 1884, 15"*9 ; April 8, 1884,
14, 1885, l5"-4; April 23, 1885, 16"-9 ; May 12, 1885,
8"-5. Their sum is 116" - 7. Subsequently to the last men-
tioned date the western pivot has been on the whole rising.
Thinking these changes might be due to a general oscilla-
tion of the hill on which the Observatories stand, I made a
series of simultaneous observations of the level errors of the
two transit-instruments, the one in the old and the other in
the new Observatory. Although the changes of level in the
two instruments followed the same law for a time they
ultimately became discordant. The cause of change for
each instrument must therefore be an immediate local one.


I may remark that one or more sets of level readings are
taken on every evening when transit observations are made
for time. There is no micrometer in connexion with the
transit threads, but the collimation of the middle thread is
usually kept perfect by viewing periodically by reversal
the slightly inclined middle thread of the two-inch transit-
instrument mounted on a pier a little north of the transit
room. On some few occasions the error of collimation has
been determined by observing the lower transit of a cir-
cumpolar star over two of the side threads with the clamp
alternately east and west, and on other occasions by means
of the level and the Bohnenberger eyepiece. The adjust-
ment for collimation has proved to be of a pretty permanent
character. The azimuth error is deduced either from transits
of (3 Hydri and j 3 Chameeleontis at opposite culminations,
from those of a star in high south declination and one near
the equator, or occasionally from those of a high and low
star north of the zenith. This error is also pretty constant.
The reductions have throughout been effected by means of
Mayer’s well known formula, namely :
Sum of Instrumental Corrections = + ------f 4—4
lo cos 8 15 cos 8 1 15 cos 8
«, b, c, being the azimuth, level and collimation constants
respectively and <5, Z the declination and zenith distance of
the star observed. The corrections for all stars north of the
zenith have recently been derived from a carefully calculated
MS. Table whose arguments are each degree of declination
from —33° to +s6°, and the values of a , b f c, for every
second of arc from Ito 15. Star-transits south of the
zenith are reduced by means of a MS. Table of ordinary
factors for every degree of declination except in cases of
very high south declination, when special calculations of
the corrections are made. The timekeeper of the Observa-
tory has been either the old Parkinson and Prodsham
chronometer before referred to, or another excellent one by
John Poole, obtained in November, 1882, and bearing the
number 2962. These, until the close of 1885, were regu-
lated to mean time, but subsequently the first-named in-
strument has been regulated to sidereal time. Since a more
accurate determination of the longitude was obtained, the
calculations of the mean times of transit of the clock stars
have been made by employing lm. 39T25. as the correc


tion of the sidereal time at Greenwich mean noon. These
calculations have been checked by the use of the other
quantity in the Nautical Almanac known as the mean time
of transit of the First Point of Aries, the correction for this
value being + lm. 38-84 s. Since 1885, however, the
sidereal chronometer has been employed as the transit
chronometer. For time determinations, the usual clock
stars of the British Nautical Almanac have as a rule been
employed, the only additions being a few occasionally from
the moon culminating list. For azimuth determinations,
circumpolar stars from tne Melbourne Catalogue for 1870
have likewise been occasionally adopted. On the eastern
side of the transit-room is a fire-proof apartment sometimes
used as an office and computing room. It also contains the
astronomical library which is gradually being enriched by
works of necessary importance to the practical astronomer.
A complete list of the scientific works in the library is
given further on, and it will be observed that it chiefly
comprises the gifts of eminent astronomers and well-known
public institutions. The presentations to the library have
for the most part been acknowledged by letter, but the
author desires thus publicly to express his gratitude to
those institutions and friends who have so kindly recognised
and encouraged his labours. In his isolated position as a
student of astronomy such recognitions are particularly en-
couraging. It now remains to speak of a very important
addition to the instrumental equipment of the Observatory.
This consists of a fine equatorial refractor of eight inches
clear aperture, and 9 feet 7 inches focal length. It was
constructed in 1882, by Grubb, of Dublin, and imported
by the late Dr. Bone, of Castlemaine, Yictoria. On the
death of Dr. Bone, the instrument was sold to the writer
for the sum of ,£4OO, or about two-thirds of the original
cost. The telescope reached the Observatory on May 20th
last year, and on the 16th of the following month, was per-
manently mounted in the circular building formerly accom-
modating the 4 ~ inch equatorial. The pillar supporting
the equatorial consists of two massive hollow cylinders of
cast iron, one standing on the other. The lower casting is
securely bolted to a pier of brick and cement rising from a
foundation about nine feet below the floor. The upper casting
is bolted to the lower one, but admits at the same time of


a small azimuthal adjustment by means of a tangent screw.
To the upper cylinder is secured another massive casting
containing the socket for the polar axis : it also contains
the clock, whose driving weight is within the cylindrical
pillar. This casting consists of two parts fitted in such a
way as to admit of the usual adjustment for latitude within
a very wide range. The mounting is that known as the
Fraunhofer or German. The telescope tube is in three
parts and of rolled steel. The hour circle is at the lower
extremity of the polar axis, and the declination circle next
to the telescope cradle, being respectively 8-6 and 13-0
inches in diameter. They are divided, the former to 2
minutes of time and read off to 10 seconds by the vernier,
and the latter to 10', read off by opposite verniers to 30".
The latter is very conveniently read off from the eye end
of the telescope by means of a tube with lenses and a prism.
The illuminating lamp is suspended at the counterpoise ex-
tremity of the declination axis. The light passing up this
hollow axis and falling on a set of reflectors in the telescope
cradle, serves for illuminating the micrometer threads, the
graduated limb of the declination circle and a transparent
position circle at the eye end of the telescope. The teles-
cope has a filar micrometer of the best description, consist-
ing of a single position thread and two moveable distance
threads. The micrometer screw-heads are each divided
into 100 equal parts, and their revolutions are registered
by suitable scales to the extent of 80 whole turns. The
thread carried by screw A is adopted as the fixed thread
and is usually kept in the collimation axis of the telescope,
while distances are measured with screw B, one revolution
of which has been found to be equal to 17"’869. This mi-
crometer has five positive eyepieces magnifying 74, 96, 112,
132 and 168 diameters. The telescope has also a Dawes
solar eyepiece and four negative eyepieces whose magnifying
powers are 131, 175, 224, and 350. The ring, square-bar
and filar micrometers employed in connexion with the 4J
inch equatorial have recently been adapted to this instru-
ment. The powers of the last mentioned micrometer thus
adapted are 138, 230, 299, and 683, and one revolution of
the adopted moveable screw is found to be equal to 18 //, 026.
It is found necessary to use the bar-micrometer when faint-
objects are to be observed, as there are at present no means


for illuminating the micrometer threads in a dark field.
The reader will at once perceive that the new telescope
forms a very valuable addition to the appliances of the
Observatory, and it has not been idle since it was installed.
From what has been written it will be seen that the in-
strumental equipment of the Observatory is of a modest
character. It has, however, been sufficient to occupy the
attention of the proprietor, and has doubtless rendered some
service to the cause of astronomy. At the close of this
description will be found a list of all the papers contributed
by him to the scientific institutions of this Colony and of
the Northern Hemisphere. He considers it quite unneces-
sary to publish the large mass of observations in the Colony,
as they have already appeared in the papers referred to and
are to be found in the library of every Observatory. As
an interesting memento of his work, he also adds a list,
which cannot be far from complete, of his popular con-
tributions to the colonial daily press, from 1854 down to
the present time. These contributions have been published
from time to time in the hope of creating a practical in-
terest in the science. It will be seen from the list of
papers that the author’s speciality is cometary astronomy,
and in connexion with this circumstance it may be men-
tioned that in the year 1882, a request was made by the
Scientific Society of Boston that he should use his influence
for the formation of an Australian Corps of Comet Seekers,
similar to that in the United States. A club of this kind
has existed for some years past in that country, and nearly
all the honours in recent comet discovery have been carried
off by it. A considerable portion of the southern heavens
is, however, shut out from the examination of northern
observers, and it was on this account that the Society re-
commended the formation of a corps in Australia. With
kind words of encouragement from friends in England he
proceeded to the task, but it was unfortunately one which
ended in disappointment. Much time was spent in corres-
pondence and in the preparation of regulations for the work,
but although many gentlemen were written to, only two
promised to join. These were residents of neighbouring
colonies. One of them carried on the work for a short
time, but the other does not appear to have done anything.
Although there are several gentlemen in the Colonies


possessed of telescopes adapted for ordinary amateur work,
the idea of systematic observation, which alone can be of
any benefit to science, does not present itself to their minds.
The proposal for the formation of an association of comet
seekers was ventilated at one of the meetings of the New
Zealand Philosophical Society, but the discussion resulted
merely in the suggestion that the Government should
establish an astronomical observatory in the island. It is
true that in onr own Colony we have a Government Obser-
vatory furnished with the finest astronomical instruments,
but in addition to this circumstance it is well that the im-
provement of our astronomical knowledge should become as
widely as possible the object of private enterprise. When
we consider onr extensive seaboard and the position which
we are expected to occupy as a great maritime nation, it
seems strange that astronomy is not more widely cultivated
amongst ns. In a paper written for the Industrial Progress
of N.S. Wales, 1870, the author expressed his opinion that
this lamentable state of things was in some measure due to
the fact that instruction in the elements of the science was
almost wholly neglected in onr educational institutions.
How differently is the science regarded in the United
States. There not only the universities embrace astronomy
in their curriculum, but almost every college has its little
observatory. Private observers are also abundant. Now
that we are about to celebrate the first centenary of our
existence, let us hope that an important change may take
place in our attitude towards the noblest of sciences.
A brief description of the Observatory and its instru-
ments having now been given, it remains to say something
with reference to the work itself. The list of papers which
follows this description will afford a very good idea of the
results achieved. It may be stated that all the astronomi-
cal observations without exception have been made by the
author himself, and previously to 1881 he executed unas-
sisted all the reductions of these observations. In the
reductions since 1880 he has been enabled to obtain the
occasional assistance of the following persons : —Messrs. A.
0. Powys, of Sydney 5 Mr. M. L. Allen, Public School Teacher
of Woodhonselee, near Goulburn; Miss M. Arnold, Pupil
Teacher, and Masters A. Berkelman and M. McMahon,
pupils of the local Public School. Assistance has also been


rendered by his own son. The reductions were made ac-
cording to forms prepared by the author, and every pre-
caution was taken against both systematic and accidental
errors. Many parts of the calculations were performed in
duplicate. The more intricate and important portions of
the reductions have fallen to the author’s own lot, and in
every case from 1858 to the present time the calculation of
the cometary orbits has devolved solely upon him. In
addition to the astronomical work, daily meteorological ob-
servations have been kept up with few interruptions since
1862. All these observations with some few exceptions
have been made by the author. The daily reductions have
also been performed by him, but the calculations of the
monthly sums and means have been made in duplicate by
himself, his son and various assistants. The results of these
observations to the close of 1885 have been published in
five parts and distributed among the various scientific in-
stitutions of both hemispheres. For a description of the
meteorological instruments the reader is referred to the
works thus published.
A woodcut, which is a faithful copy of a photograph of
the Observatories taken from the north-west in August,
1880, forms the frontispiece to this little volume. The
geographical position of the establishment has been pretty
accurately determined. The longitude has been derived
firstly from lunar distances and lastly from moon-culmina-
tions, lunar occultations of stars, and telegraphic signals
exchanged with the Sydney Observatory. The latitude,
originally obtained from numerous meridian altitudes of the
sun and principal stars taken with a sextant, has more re-
cently been deduced from prime vertical observations made
with the two transit-instruments. The most reliable co-
ordinates are as follow:
Longitude =loh. 3m. 20'8s. E. of Greenwich.
Latitude =33° 36' South.
The former has been derived by Professor Auwers in his
very elaborate investigation entitled, u Bestimmung eines
fundamentalen Meridians fiir Australien durch absolute
Methoden,” in the Astronomische Nachrichten , Band CX,
p. 289 ; the latter is the result of a very careful series of'
prime vertical observations with the 3 inch transit-instru-
ment in 1881. See an abstract of the author’s investigation


in the E.A.S. Monthly Notices , Vol. XLIY. p. 101. The
Observatory being now regarded as a fundamental point in
the Australian system of longitudes, Prof essor. Harkness,
of Washington, has recently suggested the great importance
of determining with all possible accuracy, by means of the
electric telegraph, the difference of longitude between it and
the Government Observatories at Sydney and Melbourne, two
other well determined points in Australia. At the request of
that well-known astronomer, this work has recently been
carried out, and the results promise to be exceedingly satis-
factory. In concluding this brief description of the Obser-
vatories and their appliances, it may be added that a con-
siderable portion of the results represented in the accom-
panying list of papers has been already utilized, and the
work has proved of sufficient importance to admit of
Windsor being placed in the list of Observatories in the
British and American Nautical Almanacs, the Connaissance
des Temps, and the Berliner Astronomisch.es Jahrbuch.

The elements are derived from the Windsor positions for
January 30, February 8, 15, 23, and March 18, corrected for
aberration and parallax. As these results formed till recently
the closest approximation yet published, they have been
transferred to the Comet Tables in the various popular works
on Astronomy. A definitive investigation of the elements has,
however, just been completed by Dr. F. Koerber, of Breslau.
Discovery and Observations of Encke’s Periodical Comet :— R.A.S.

author with the 3J inch refractor on June 24, 1865, with the
help of a rough calculation founded on the elements for the
previous return and an assumed perihelion passage. The
positions are apparent right ascensions and north polar dis-
tances for June 24, 29, 1865, uncorrected for parallax. The
mean and apparent places of the comparison stars, with the

improvement on those before communicated. They have been
employed by Dr. F. Koerber of Breslau, in a discussion of all
the published observations for a definitive orbit. The cor-
rections to the Windsor provisional elements are small. See
Dr. F. Koerber’s “ Inaugural Dissertation ueber den
Cometen, 1865, I, Breslau, 1887.”

parallax but the necessary factors for the reductions are
added. The mean and apparent places of the comparison
stars are given, the former being almost wholly derived from
observations made in the same year with the Melbourne
transit-circle, and kindly communicated by the Government
Astronomer for Yictoria. These observations have been em-
ployed with the other southern observations in a definitive

Lunar Occultations of Stars in 1876 : — R.A.S. Monthly Notices, Vol.
XXXVII. p. 434. These observations were made with the
\\ inch equatorial and consist of eleven disappearances and
three reappearances. The Windsor observations of lunar
occultations of stars, extending from 1873 to 1876 and com-
prised in this and preceding papers, have recently been
turned to valuable account. They occupy a very prominent


position in an investigation by Professor A. Auwers, of
Berlin, of the longitudes of Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide
and Windsor. See his paper, “Bestimmung eines funda-
mentalen Meridians fur Australien durch absolute Methoden”
in “ Ast. Naeh., Band OX. No. 2635-6, p. 289.” This dis-
tinguished astronomer in the course of his investigation bears
the following very gratifying testimony to the value of the
observations : “ These observations, too, are throughout
“reliable and prove the great care with which Mr. Tebbutt
“ has worked. I cannot omit to point out that in my ex-
“ perience in this branch of research, there is no second
“ series of observations approaching at all in extent to his, in
“ which, as here, not a single observation can be regarded as
“ faulty, and not a single error has to be rectified in the
“ statement.” The long series of occultations thus utilized
by Professor Auwers has rendered the Observatory one of the
fundamental points in the Australian system of longitudes.
Observations oe Dark Transits of Jupiter’s Third Satellite :

Nach., Rand XCV., No. 2264, p. 119. Except in one instance
the observations were made with the 4£ inch equatorial, and
may be summarised thus :—Satellite I, one disappearance
and twelve reappearances; Satellite 11, one disappearance
and three reappearances ; Satellite 111, two disappearances
and four reappearances; Satellite IV, one disappearance
and three reappearances. Both phases of the eclipse of
Satellite 111 on November 7, were observed. Dark transits
of Satellite 111 were observed on September 7, 14, October
20, and a similar transit of Satellite IV on August 24.
Observations of Brorsen’s Comet, 1879 :— R.A.S. Monthly Notices,
Vol. XXXIX. p. 486, and Ast. Nach., Rand XCV. No. 2264,
p. 123. These consist of ring-comparisons with the 4£ inch
equatorial on February 26 and March 11. The results are
apparent right ascensions and north polar distances, with the
usual parallax factors. The adopted mean and apparent
places of the comparison stars are also given.
On the Longitude of the Observatory, Windsor, N.S. Wales :
R.A.S. Monthly Notices, Vol. XL. p. 308. The longitude is
derived from twenty occultation phases, namely, seventeen
disappearances and three reappearances observed from 1866
to 1876, the moon’s places being corrected by observations at
Greenwich, Badcliffe, and Washington.
On the Probable Variability of B.A.C. 2472 : — R.A.S. Monthly
Notices, Vol. XL. p. 437.
On the Longitude of the Observatory, Windsor, N.S. Wales:
R.A.S. Monthly Notices, Vol. XL. p. 440. This is a paper
supplementary to that published at page 308 of the same
volume, and the longitude is finally determined from twenty-
three occultation phases, namely, nineteen disappearances
and four reappearances. The resulting value is lOh. 3m.
2PBs. E. from Greenwich.


Observations oe Eclipses oe Jupiter’s Satellites, July, 1879, to
January, 1880 :— Ast. Nach., Band XOVII. No. 2307 , p. 37.
The observations were made with the inch equatorial as
follows : —Satellite I, one disappearance and seven reappear-
ances ; Satellite 11, three reappearances ; Satellite 111, three
disappearances and five reappearances ; Satellite IV, two dis-
appearances and one reappearance. Satellites 111 and IY
were observed in both phases on November 29 and Septem-
ber 22 respectively.
Notice oe the Appearance of a Large Comet : — Ast. Nach., Band
XCVII. No. 2309, p. 75. This refers to the Great Southern
Comet I, 1880, but no observations of any value could be
obtained owing to continued cloudy weather.
Observations of Pallas at tiie Opposition of 1879-80 : — Ast. Nach.,
Band XCVII. No. 2321, p. 269. These consist of apparent
right ascensions and north polar distances on December 8,9,
14, 17, 20, 1879, January 7,9, 21, 1880. With the exception
of one observation in R.A. with the 3 inch transit-instrument,
the positions depend on the filar micrometer of the 4|- inch
equatorial. The parallax corrections are added. The mean
places of the comparison stars have, with two exceptions, been
deduced from the Washington Catalogue of 10658 Stars for
1860, but as the stars are in rather high south declination
the positions might, with advantage, be taken from Stone’s
new Cape Catalogue for 1880.
Orbit-Elements of Comet I, 1880 (Great Southern Comet) : — Ast.
Nach., Band XCVIII. No. 2338, p. 155. The elements are
deduced from the Melbourne observations of February 9, 14,
17, 1880, corrected for aberration and parallax.
Observations of the Red Spot on Jupiter : — B.A.S. Monthly Notices,
Vol. XLI., p. 331. These are observations with the inch
equatorial of the transit of the spot over the central meridian
of the planet both by means of the filar micrometer and by
estimation. The dates of observation are October 31,
November 2,7, 10, 15, 17, 24, December 1,4, 10, 18, 30,
1880. The observations have been combined by Dr. Schmidt
of Athens, with other results, in an investigation of the
rotation-period of the planet. See “ Ast. Nach., Band Cl.,
No. 2410, p. 147.”
Observations of Jupiter and Star No. 363 of the Washington
General Catalogue for 1860:— Ast. Bach., Band XCIX.
No. 2365, p. 205. These consist of filar-micrometer com-
parisons of the planet and star with the 4f inch equatorial
during their close approach November 20, 1880, with the
concluded geocentric places of the planet and the resulting
corrections to the Nautical Almanac.
Discovery and Observations of Comet 111, 1881 :—Ast. Nach., Band
C. No. 2387, p. 171. This paper contains a notification of
the discovery, with partially reduced filar micrometer
measures for May 22, 23, 25, 27, 1881.


Observations and Orbit-Elements of Comet 111, 1881 :—Ii.A.S.
Monthly Notices, Vol. NXA.p. 442, and Ast. Nach., Band C.No.
2397, pp. 333 and 335. This paper contains the comet’s ap-
parent right ascensions and north polar distances for May 22,
23, 25, 27, June, 1,2, 4,5, 6,8, 11, 1881, the last being
derived from circle comparisons and all the others from filar
micrometer measures with the 4% inch equatorial. The
parallax factors with the adopted mean and the apparent
places of the comparison stars are also given. The elements
are parabolic and are derived from the positions for May 22,
June 1, 11, 1881, uncorrected for aberration or parallax.
The Windsor observations combined with many others ex-
tending to the end of September, have been employed by M.
Bossert, of the Paris Observatory, in an investigation of the
elliptic elements, the resulting period of revolution being
years. See “ Comptes Rendus des Seances de l’Aca-
demie des Sciences, Tome XCIII. p. 659.
Discovery of a Comet :— Ast. Nach., Band Cl. No. 2402, p. 31. This
Comet was detected while sweeping with the 3| inch refractor
on September 17, 1881. It subsequently turned out to be
Comet IY, (Schaeberle) 1881. Approximate positions are
given for September 17, 18, 1881, from ring-comparisons
with the 4\ inch equatorial.
Remarks on Dr. Could’s Observation of Comet 111, 1881, June 11,
(Ast. Nach., No. 2384) :— Ast. Nach., Band CI.)No.
171. Dr. Gould supposed that he had observed another
comet in the same field with the Great Comet, and this paper
was written to show that the telescope at Windsor was
pointed on the comet within an hour and a half of the Cordoba
observation, without any second comet being seen, and that
owing to the very unsatisfactory conditions for observing at
Cordoba, the objects seen there were the blurred images
of the stars B.A.C. 1592, 1597, near the horizon. This view
has been endorsed by several astronomers.
Observations of the Transit of Mercury, November 7—B, 1881 :
B.A.S. Monthly Notices, Vol. XLII. p. 103, and Ast. Nach.,
Band Cl. No. 2411, p. 173. The four contacts were observed
with the 41 inch equatorial, the first imperfectly and the
others very satisfactorily. These results occupy a very im-
portant place in Professor Newcomb’s “ Discussion of the
Transits of Mercury from 1677 to 1881,” which forms Part
VI. of Vol I. of “ Ast. Papers prepared for the use of the
American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac, Wash., 1882.”
Observations of Uranus :— Ast. Nach., Band Cl. No. 2414, p. 223.
The observations are filar-micrometer comparisons of the
planet with the well-known clock star x Leonis on March 8,
9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 1881, the telescope employed being the 4|
inch equatorial. The results are apparent geocentric positions
with the concluded corrections to the Nautical Almanac.
Comparisons of the apparent magnitude of the planet are
also given.


Observations of Comet IY (Sciiaeberle), 1881 :— B.A.S. Monthly
Notices, Vol. XLII. p. 263, and Ast. Nach., Band CL No. 2419,
p. 301. These are ring comparisons with the inch equa-
torial on September 17, 18, 19, 20, 26, 29, 30, October 1,2,
3,4, 5,8, 12, 14, 15, 1881. The results are apparent right
ascensions and north polar distances, to which the parallax
factors are added. The mean and apparent places of the
comparison stars, the former from the best available authori-
ties, are also given. The positions furnished in this paper
have been combined by Dr. Carl Stechert, of Kiel, with all
other published observations in a definitive determination of
the orbit. See “ Definitive Bestimmung der Bahn des
Cometen, 1881, IY,” in Ast. Nach., Band CYIII. p. 177.”
Mean Places of Lacaille’s Stabs compared at Wind sob with Comet
111, 1881 : — Ast. Nach., Band CII. No. 2430, p. 93. The
star places were deduced from filar micrometer comparisons
with other well determined stars, and from observations with
the 3 inch transit-instrument in the meridian.
Kemabks on Db. Gould’s Obsebvation of Comet 111, 1881, June 11,
(Ast. Nach., No. 2384) :— Ast. Nach., Band CIII. No. 2468,
p. 311. This is a rejoinder to Dr. Gould’s reply in the “Ast.
Nach., No. 2434 ” to the author’s former paper on this
subject. This paper is reprinted in the “ Observatory,” for
December, 1882.
Pbe-pebihelion Obsebvations of the Gbeat Comet 11, 1882 B.A.S.
Monthly Notices, Vol. XLIII, p. 31, and Ast. Nach., Band
CIII. No. 2468, p. 311. These are comparisons with a square
bar-micrometer on the 4% inch equatorial on the mornings of
September 9 and 10, 1882. The results are apparent right
ascensions and north polar distances, to which the parallax
factors are added. The adopted mean place of the com-
parison star, with the usual reductions, is given. These
observations with five at Melbourne and two at the Cape of
Good Hope are the only data available for the determination
of the orbit-elements before the perihelion passage. From
a comparison of the results derived from these data by Dr. J. K.
Hind, of London, M. Raoul Gautier, of Geneva, and Dr. J.
Morrison, of Washington, with those deduced from post-
perihelion observations, it would appear that the orbit did
not suffer any sensible change by the comet’s rush through
the sun’s coronal atmosphere.
Observations of Comet I, (Wells) 1882 B.A.S. Monthly Notices,
Vol. XLIII., p. 58, and Ast. Nach., Band CIY. No. 2475 41.
These were made with the inch equatorial on June 19, 20,
21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, July 1,2, 3,4, 5,6, 7,
9, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 1882. The com-
parisons from June 19, to July 7, were made with the filar
micrometer, and from July 7 to 25, with the square bar-
micrometer. The results are apparent right ascensions and
north polar distances, to which the usual parallax factors are
added. The comparison stars are forty-three in number, and
their mean places as derived from the best available'
authorities are given for 1882-0, together with the necessary


reductions to the apparent places for the dates of the comet
observations. The observations, it is understood, are in the
hands of Dr. E. von Rebeur-Paschwitz for a definitive in-
vestigation of the orbit.
Note on the Geeat Comet 11, 1882 : — R.A.S. Monthly Notices, Vol.
XLIII. p. 62. This communication treats of the Comet’s
visibility in full sunlight without a telescope, and of the
similarity of its orbit to those of the Great Comets of 1848
and 1880. It appears that Windsor was the first station at
which the comet’s visibility near the sun was noted.
Obsebvations of Comet 111, (Babnaed) 1882 :—Ast. Nach., Band
CIV. No. 2492, p. 317. These consist of apparent right
ascensions and north polar distances deduced from square
bar comparisons with the 41 inch equatorial on December 2
and 8, 1882, to which the usual parallax factors are added.
The adopted mean places of the comparison stars, with the
reductions to the apparent places, are also given.
Note on Pbofessob Newcomb’s Remaeics on the Windsoe Obseeva-
tions of the Teansit of Venus in 1874*: — R.A.S. Monthly
Notices, Vol. XLIII. p. 279. This contains a reply to Pro-
fessor Newcomb’s remarks in the “ R.A.S. Monthly Notices ”
for April, 1882.
Obsebvations of the Pabtiab Solae Eclipse, Novembee 10, 1882 :
R.A.S. Monthly Notices, Vol. XLIII. p. 280. Both contacts
were well observed with the 4£ inch equatorial. An interest-
ing series of observations of two black-bulb thermometers,
one in vacuo and the other in air were also made during the
phenomenon.
Post-Pebihelion Obsebvations of the Geeat Comet 11, 1882: —
R.A.S. Monthly Notices, Vol. XLIII. p. 383, and Ast. Nach.,
Band CV., No. 2504, p. 117 and No. 2513, p 263. These
consist of comparisons almost wholly with the square bar-
micrometer on the inch equatorial on September 28, 29,
30, October 2,3, 5,6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19, 22, 23, 26,
30, November 3,6, 7,9, 10, 14, 18, 20, 22, 30, December 1
2,8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 28, 29, 1882, January 1,7, 9, 12
14, February 6,7, 12, 26, and March 2, 1883. The comet
was also observed accurately in R.A., and approximately in
N.P.D., in full sunlight, with the 3 inch transit instrument
on September 18, 19, 20, 21, 1882. The apparent right
ascensions and north polar distances of the comet are given
for each of the dates stated together with the parallax factors.
The mean places of the comparison stars, seventy-six in
number, deduced from the best authorities available, are
also added with the usual reductions. The Windsor positions
for September 8 and January 14, in conjunction with
observations made at other stations, have been employed by
Dr. Morrison, of Washington, in an approximate determi-
nation of the elliptic elements. It appears that all published
observations of the Comet are now under discussion by Pro-
fessor Howe, of the United States, for a final determination
of the orbit.


Observations of Ceres at the Opposition of 1882 :— Ast. Nach., Band
CYI. No. 2530, p. 157. These consist of comparisons with
the 4-§ inch equatorial on August 10, 14, 21, 30, 31, Septem-
ber 1,2, 7, 13, 15, 1882, those on September 13, with the
square bar-micrometer, and the rest with the filar-micrometer.
The resulting places of the planet are geocentric apparent right
ascensions and north polar distances. The adopted mean
places of the comparison stars are given with the usual re-
ductions to the apparent places.
Eclipses of Jupiter’s Satellites Observed in 1880 —18S2 :— Ast.
Nach., Band CYI. No. 2541, p. 323. These may be classed
thus:—Satellite I, two disappearances and seven reappear-
ances ; Satellite 11, four reappearances; Satellite 111, two
disappearances and two reappearances; Satellite IY, one dis-
appearance. The 4| inch equatorial was employed through-
out. It is inferred by Mr. Marth, (See “ R.A.S. Monthly
Notices, Yol. XLIY. p. 244,”) from the observation of the
Fourth Satellite, that the tabular longitude of the node
of this satellite requires a sensible positive correction.
Observations of the Yariable Star R Carince, from May, 1880, to
September, 1883: — R.A.S. Monthly Notices, Vol. XLIV. p.
14. These consist of a series of careful comparisons of the
magnitude of the star with stars visible to the unassisted eye
and contained in the Uranometria Argentina, and with others
which are only telescopic. The concluded magnitudes of the
variable are given for 154 different dates extending over the
period stated. The coordinates of the small telescopic com-
parison stars with reference to the variable are also given.
The limits of variability of the star are magnitudes 4'3 and 9‘3
and the period from maximum to maximum about 313 days.
On the Latitude of the Observatory, Windsor, N.S. Wales :
R.A.S. Monthly Notices, Vol. XLIY. p. 101. This paper con-
tains the results of a revision of the determination of the
latitude from prime vertical observations with the two-inch
transit-instrument in the years 1867, 68, 69, 70, 74. The re-
sulting latitude of the meridian transit and equatorial piers
of the new Observatory based on more accurate places of the
stars employed is -33° 36' 29"-5. The paper also contains
the results of a new and very careful investigation of the
latitude from six well-determined stars in 1881, by means of
the Cooke 3 inch transit-instrument in the prime vertical.
The resulting latitude of the two piers above referred to is
—33° 36' 30" - 8, which value is that now adopted.
Observations of Comet II (Ross), 1883 :— R.A.S. Monthly Notices,
Vol. XLIV. p. 283, and Ast. Nach., Band CVIII. No. 2585,
p. 309. These are comparisons with a square bar-micrometer
on the 4J inch equatorial on January 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25,
27, 28, and February 2, 1884. The apparent right ascensions
and north polar distances of the comet are given for the dates
named, together with the usual parallax factors. The mean
places of the comparison stars for 1884-0 are also given from
the best authorities available together with the reductions to
the apparent places for the dates of observation.


Orbit-Elements of Comet II (Eoss), 1883 :— R.A.S. Monthly Notices,
Vol. XLIY. p. 377, and Ast. Nach., Band CVIII. No. 2588,
p. 375. This is a determination of the elements from the
Windsor observations of January 19, 23, and 28, 1884, un-
corrected for aberration or parallax.
Apparent Places of Comet II (Eoss), 1883 : — R.A.S. Monthly Notices,
Vol. XLIY. p. 444. This paper contains the places of the
comet as corrected for small errors due to the square bar-mi-
crometer. The Windsor observations have afforded a basis
for a determination of elliptic elements by Eobert Bryant,
8.A., of London. In conjunction with other observations at
Melbourne and Madras, they have also been employed both
by Gen. Tennant and Mr. Bryant in the formation of elliptic
elements. See “ E.A.S. Monthly Notices, Yol. XLV, p. 428,
and Yol. XLYII. pp. 24, and 434,” respectively.
Corrections to the Windsor Eight Ascensions of Comet II (Eoss),
1883 :— Ast. Nach., Band CIX. No. 2608, p. 251. This paper
contains certain small corrections due to the square bar-mi-
crometer with which the observations were made.
Observations of the Comet of 1812 (Pons-Brooks) at its Eeturn
to Perihelion in 1884 : — R.A.S. Monthly Notices, Vol. XLIY.
p. 445, and Ast. Nach., Band CX., No. 2625, p. 135. These
are square bar-micrometer comparisons with the 4j inch
equatorial on January 13, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, February 2,4,
5,8, 9, 10, 17, 22, 25, 26, 29, March 2,7, 8,9, 14, 21, 24,
and April 1, 21, 1884, the results being apparent right
ascensions and north polar distances. In the former Journal
the parallax corrections based on Schulhof and Bossert’s
ephemerides in Nos. 2558, 2569, and 2570, of the “ Astron-
omische Nachrichten” are given, but in the latter the parallax
factors only are supplied. The mean places of the com-
parison stars, forty-six in number, are derived from all
available authorities, and are furnished in both journals with
the usual reductions to the apparent places. The Windsor
positions in con junction with the numerous other observations
hitherto published are now under discussion by Schulhof and
Bossert of Paris, and will, doubtless, afford valuable data
for fixing the return of the Comet to perihelion about the
middle of next century.
Observations of Comet 11, (Barnard) 1884 :— R.A.S. Monthly Notices,
Vol. XLY., p. 50, and Ast. Bach., BandGX.., No. 2619, p. 39,
and No. 2624, p. 125. These are apparent right ascensions
and north polar distances derived from square bar com-
parisons with the 4£ inch equatorial on July 24, 27, 28, 31,
August 2,4, 6,8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 22, 1884, with
the usual parallax factors. The mean places of the com-
parison stars, twenty-one in number, are also given as
derived from all available authorities, with the reductions to
the apparent places. The positions for July 24 and August
22, have been already adopted by Professor Egbert of Dudley
Observatory, U.S., in combination with observations at the
Cape of Good Hope, Yienna, Arcetri and Nice, for a determi-
nation of the elliptic orbit, which turns out to be one of very


short period, namely, about 5*4 years. See “ Ast. Nach.,
Band CXI., p. 267, and the ‘ Observatory’ for May, 1885.”

Observation of the Lunar Occultation of Jupiter and his Satel-
lites, April 16, 1886 :— Ast. Nach., Band CXIY. No. 2736,
p. 411. The observations were made with the 4|- inch equa-
torial. The disappearance of the planet and Satellites I and
11, and the reappearance of the planet and Satellites I, 11,
and 111, were observed. This paper is reprinted with some
typographical errors in the “ Astronomical Begister,” for Sep-
tember, 1886.


Observations of Comet I (Fabry), 1886 . — Ast. Nach., Band CXY.
No. 2760, p. 393. The observations were made with the 4£

21, 22, 23, 26, 30, 31, June 1,5, 7, 1886, on the first four
dates with the filar-micrometer, and on the remaining dates
with the square bar-micrometer. The results are apparent
right ascensions and north polar distances of the comet, with
the corresponding parallax factors and the reductions of the
star places. The mean places of the comparison stars, thirty-
five in number, are also given based on all available authori-
ties.
Observations of Phenomena of Jupiter’s Satellites in 1886 :
