A NAROOMA SIRE.
In 1937, 25 cows averaged 6902-lb. milk and
361-lb. butter-fat in 273 days, equal to 434-lb.
commercial butter. Twelve two-year-olds averaged
317.5-lb. fat.
NAROOMA
JERSEY STUD
WAGGA
QINCE establishing Narooma Jersey Stud in 1927, the aim has
been a high-producing herd free from disease —an objective
that has been achieved. The herd is certified by the Department
of Agriculture as T.B. and abortion free. As regards production,
Narooma had the first cow in Riverina to produce 1000-lb. of butter
in a lactation, while official tests have shown that Narooma has
some of the highest producing Jerseys in Australia.
Narooma Estate, situated on the Murrumbidgee River, 12 miles
west of Wagga, comprises 1400-acres, of which 450-acres are used for
dairying, and the balance for sheep and wheat.
The stud is handicapped in some respects through being so far
removed from the recognised dairying zone, but the country has
irrefutable claims in stud stock production, building up bone and
constitution. Proof is the fact of the district being the home of the
world-renowned Wagga Gladys and two "thousand pound” cows
at Narooma, besides some of the best sheep and beef studs in
Australia. This is a point to be remembered in choosing your next
sire. Come to Narooma !


KELVINSIDE FOUNDATION
TyAROOMA Jersey stud began with purchases from several well-known
herds in N.S.W. Probably the most successful were those from
Kelvinside; of these, the outstanding cows —and those now forming the
main link in Narooma’s breeding programme —were Kelvinside Brown
Lustre, Kelvinside Maisie’s Modesty, Kelvinside Noble Fuchsia and
Kelvinside Tarzan’s Conceit.
Kelvinside Maisie’s Modesty was by Springmead Beau (3266), who
also sired Brown Lustre. The dam of Maisie’s Modesty, Maisie of
Kelvinside, was by Golden Hero (269), whose eight recorded daughters
averaged 424-lb. butter-fat in 273 days.
Narooma Lusmon’s Primrose (45382), Champion
Wagga Show, 1937.
Kelvinside Maisie’s Modesty produced 311-lb. fat as a
junior two-year-old and 545-lb. as a mature cow. Her
daughters at Narooma have inherited her production, viz.,
Narooma Lusmon’s Modesty (by Narooma Lustre’s Monarch),
349-lb. fat as a junior two-year-old, and Narooma Modesty
(by Monarch of Yaralla), 423-lb. as a junior two-year-old.
Kelvinside Noble Fuchsia, by Noble of Yaralla (3383),
is a maternal half-sister to Kelvinside Brown Lustre, both
cows being from Brown Chief’s Fuchsia 2nd of Wollingurry.
Noble Fuchsia created a State record as a junior three-year-
old, producing 623-lb. fat in 273 days.
Kelvinside Tarzan’s Conceit (3 2,345) is another out-
standing cow and to date in five lactations has an average
of 10,440-lb. milk and 555-lb. butter-fat. In her 1936-37
lactation, she gave 13,890-lb, milk and 736-lb. fat in 273 days
and for 365 days produced 16,902 j-lb. milk and 909.30-lb.
butter-fat. Her sire was Springmead Tarzan (4597), by
Springmead Osram (imp. in dam), 1777, ex Fleur of Yaralla,
which was by Retford Mariposa, and produced 14,270-lb.
milk and 744-lb. fat in 365 days. Springmead Tarzan has
ten daughters averaging 402-lb. fat in 273 days.
The dam of Tarzan’s Conceit, Kelvinside Noble Conceit,
was not tested, but the latter’s dam, Conceit’s Coquette of
Kelvinside, was the first Jersey on the North Coast to produce
1000-lb. of butter, her record being 13,457-lb. milk and
887.7-lb. fat in 365 days.
Tarzan’s Conceit is the second cow in the Narooma
herd to produce over 1000-lb. butter and the fifth cow with
the Kelvinside prefix to produce over 1000-lb.
The other thousand-pound cow at Narooma is Kelvinside
Brown Lustre, which in 273 days produced 849-lb. fat and
in 365 days 20,102-lb. milk and 1116-lb. butter-fat, thus
joining the select band of about a dozen cows that have
produced over 1000-lb. of butter in 273 days.


THE “SUPER” COW
Vessel of Kelvinside Brown Lustre.
once in a while the exceptional animal is born—
one that leaves a lasting impression and does untold
good for the breed. Such was Kelvinside Brown Lustre
(22703), a cow of outstanding type and constitution, which,
by consistent high production and regular breeding, placed
herself in the class of super cows.
Kelvinside Brown Lustre was sired by Springmead
Beau (3266), by Springmead Osram (imp. in dam), 1777,
by Les Niemes General 2nd, ex Warrior’s Golden Fern
(imp. in dam) 6908. Springmead Beauty (10913), the
dam of Springmead Beau, was sired by Werribee Fancy’s
Madeira King (1473), ex Lady Bois 2nd of \ aralla, which
was by Retford Mariposa (896). Lady Bois 2nd has a
record of 520 lb. fat, while her full sister, Fleur of Yaralla,
has a record of 744 lb. fat in 365 days.
The dam of Kelvinside Brown Lustre was Brown Chief’s
Fuchsia 2nd of Wollingurry (413 lb. fat), by Brown Chief
(994), by Mabel’s Chief (imp.) 623, ex Brown Bread (imp.
in dam).
Fuchsia of the Isles, the dam of Brown Chief Fuchsia
2nd, was by Retford Mariposa, ex Fuchsia 3rd.
TO NAROOMA GOES THE CREDIT OF
OWNING THE FIRST JERSEY IN RIVERINA
TO PRODUCE 1000 lb. OF BUTTER IN 273 DAYS.
Brown Lustre accomplished this honor for her owner
at the age of six years, when she produced 15,463 lb.
milk and 849.8 lb. fat, and over the 365 day period
produced 20,102 lb. milk and 1116 Ib. fat, making her the
highest producing Jersey, privately owned, in N.S.W
During this strenuous period she was run with the
herd and milked twice daily with machines.


PRODUCER : BREEDER
Brown Lustre, in seven official records,
averaged 11,263 lb. milk and 601 lb. butter-fat in 273
days. In addition, during her eleven years of life, she
produced nine calves. One of her sons, Narooma Lustre’s
Monarch, by Monarch of Yaralla (5046), has been in use
in the herd for some time. His heifers are now coming into
profit and promise to acquit themselves well—the first four
as junior two-year-olds averaging 322 lb. fat in 273 days.
Brown Lustre’s last son, sired by Belgonia Peggy lOth’s
Prince, has also been reserved for stud use.
It is not expected that the exceptional animal will
always breed stock of a similar capacity, but Brown
Lustre’s daughters have shown that they inherit out-
standing production. Narooma Lustre (27621), by Noble
of Yaralla (3383), in three lactations, has averaged
467 Ib. fat. Narooma Perree’s Lustre (36239), by
Perree’s Star of Glen Iris (4327) has an average over
four lactations of 451 lb. fat, producing 512 lb. in 273
days as a junior two-year-old. Narooma Lustre’s
Supremacy (45383), by Monarch of Yaralla, has
produced 466-lb. fat in 273 days.
Another cow that merits mention is Narooma
Gloria (36234), which, at the age of 2-yrs. 9-mths.,
produced 9844 lb. milk and 580.7 lb. butter-fat in 273
days, thus creating a State record for that age. She is
descended from producing stock, being sired by Perree’s
Star of Glen Iris, while her dam, Noble Gloria of Kel-
vinside (459 lb. fat) was sired by Noble of Yaralla, ex
Tidy’s Ideal of Kelvinside, whose dam, Tidy of Kelvin-
side (6441) is also the dam of Tidy’s Pride of Kelvinside
(10665), which produced 959 lb. fat in 365 days, and is
the mother of Nairfaie Yuletide King, a bull that is
doing excellent work in the Narooma stud.

Narooma has endeavored always to keep abreast of the times.
We maintain that if a job is worth doing it is worth doing properly
and if a cow is worth milking she is worth feeding. To ensure that
worthless cows are net given feed that can be better expended else-
where the herd has been continuously recorded for production
under the Department of Agriculture’s herd improvement scheme
and heavy culling is practised both on production figures and on
type and incidence of disease (mammitis, etc.).
The result is typified by two cows
illustrated on this page. Kelvinside
Tarzan ! s Conceit gave 909.30-lbs.
butter-fat on her 1936-37 lactation.
She is a beautiful fawn cow of ideal
temperament. Narooma Gloria gave
the remarkable yield of 580.7-lbs. fat
in 273 days at the age of 2-yrs. 9-
mths, establishing a State record.
In dairy farm competitions conducted by the local agricultural
society Narooma has won every competition held, and has acquitted
itself well in competitions covering a wider area. Thus, in 1932,
the Estate was first in the local competition and third in the State-
wide championship. In 1933 Narooma was first in the local section
and first in the inland section of the State competition, while
in 1934 the Estate was first in the local competition and third in
the inland section.


NAROOMA JERSEYS ARE FREE OF CONTAGIOUS
ABORTION AND TUBERCULOSIS
Abortion and tuberculosis are two scourges of the dairy industry,
causing untold harm and loss to dairymen, and early efforts were
made to eliminate both diseases from Narooma. The objective has
been achieved. Narooma was the first accredited abortion-free herd
in N.S.W., and possibly in the Commonwealth, and has since been
maintained free. The stock are submitted to regular tests by the
veterinary branch of the Department of Agriculture.
These tests, like production recording, are carried out for the
protection of clients and are a guarantee that Narooma Jerseys
conform to the highest standards of practical dairying.
Thus we find in the Herd Production Competition (1933-34),
inaugurated by the "Farmer and Settler" newspaper, Narooma was
placed first in competition with the leading herds throughout the
State, including all breeds. On a mature basis, Narooma’s 12 cows
gave the splendid average of 593.24-lbs. butter-fat per cow in a
lactation of 273 days. These 12 cows produced a total of
lbs. of milk and 6208.81-lbs. butter-fat, while the age allowance
for junior cows brought the total of butter-fat to 7118.88-lbs.
The stud now has some promising daughters of these test cows.
Particularly pleasing are those by the sire illustrated above, Belgonia
Peggy lOth’s Prince, who has handed down the outstanding type
and production characteristics of his illustrious sire and dam.

CONSIDERABLE success has been attained in the
establishment of irrigated pastures, mainly of peren-
nial rye grass and red clover, and there are now 50 acres
irrigable sown to these grasses. Divided into three and five
acre paddocks, the plots are grazed in rotation, and it is
possible to obtain green grazing practically every month
of the year. Earlier establishment of subterranean clover
on other pasture land, and the spread of other introduced
grasses, provide good mixed grazing in season on the
balance of the farm.
Pastures are supplemented by lucerne and cereal hay
and ensilage. An endeavor is made to finish each season
with a reserve of 250 tons of ensilage, 100 tons cereal
hay and 50 tons lucerne hay.
All the year feeding is practised, cereal hay being
chaffed and the grain separated for crushing and feeding
as desired.
Irrigated pastures, supplemented with home-grown
cereal and lucerne hay, have given a uniform volume of
production each month of the year —a difficult matter in
Riverina, where the drying off of pastures in summer
causes a loss of nutrients far greater than the winter decline
on the coast.

NAROOMA SIRES
SINCE 1928 the sires used at Narooma have been
descended from the best producing and show stock in
the Commonwealth. All trace back to several infusions of
the famous Noble of Oaklands strain, which has had a
wonderful influence in raising the type and production of
Australian Jerseys.
The foundation sire, Monarch of Yaralla (5046), is
saturated with Noble of Oaklands blood, of which he
has no fewer than seven infusions. Monarch of Yaralla
was sired by Oxford Golden Monarch (4391), ex Miss
Flower of Yaralla. His sire, who was bred in the Oxford
herd of Mr. E. Burton, Wanora (Q.), was twice champion
of Queensland, and is a son of the Island-bred sire, Prince
Palatine, imported by Mr. Burton in 1915, and champion
at the Brisbane Royal Show in 1917. Prince Palatine (imp.)
sired Oxford Golden Buttercup, champion of Queensland
for seven successive years, and the most beautiful Jersey
cow ever bred in the southern hemisphere.
Monarch of Yaralla’s dam, Miss Flower of Yaralla,
comes of a high-producing strain. She is by Result of
Melrose, a son of Golden Fern’s Viscount (imp.), ex
Jenny Lind 10th of Melrose, which averaged 8967-lb. milk
and 481 lb. butter-fat in five lactations.
Flower of Yaralla, whose record is 7476 lb. milk,
average test 6.3, and 470.40 lb. butter-fat, dam of Miss
Flower of Yaralla, is by the successful sire, Retford
Mariposa, by Matilda’s Noble (imp.), a renowned type and
production bull.
Monarch of Yaralla was four times champion at
Wagga, and two of his daughters, Narooma Modesty and
MONARCH OF YARALLA (5046, A.J.H.8.).
Narooma Pleasant, produced as two-year-olds 423 and 427
lb. butter-fat respectively in 273 days. Another daughter,
Narooma Monarch’s Maylette produced 497 lb. fat with
an average test of 6.1.
One of Monarch of Yaralla’s contemporaries was
Perree’s Star of Glen Iris (4327), bred by the late C. D.
Lloyd, Narre Warren (Vic.), by Perree’s Duke (imp. in
dam), 996, ex Werribee Starbright 9th (6542). His sire is
by Quality’s You’ll Do, by Oxford You’ll Do, ex Golden
Noble Duchess (imp.), by Golden Fern’s Noble. One of


the great cows of her breed, Golden Noble Duchess (imp.),
averaged 7218 lb. milk and 447 i lb. butter-fat for six lac-
tations, in .four of which her average test exceeded 6 per
cent., and she was champion at the Melbourne Royal Show
on five occasions. His dam is by Island Butter King
(imp.) 929, by Oxford Noble of Oaklands, and her average
for six consecutive tests is 9849 lb. milk and 547 lb. butter-
fat, and she was reserve champion at Melbourne in 1923.
The stock of Perree’s Star have performed well, two
notable examples being Narooma Gloria, 580.7 lb. butter-
fat as a senior two-year-old, and Narooma Perree’s Lustre,
512 lb. fat as a junior two-year-old.
The other contemporary of Monarch of Yaralla was
Retford Fern’s Prince, by Retford Jersey King (1384) by
Matilda’s Noble (imp.) by Noble of Oaklands, ex Retford
Fern, by Matilda’s Noble (imp.). The dam of Retford
Jersey King is Brown May (imp.) 4140, an Island-bred
cow that won a number of prizes in England, was champion
at Sydney in 1917 and yielded 9411 lb. milk and 476 Ib.
butter-fat. Retford Fern is a full sister of Retford Bracken,
champion at Sydney in 1924 and 1928, and her record is
lb. milk and 475.47 lb. butter-fat. Full use was not
made of Retford Fern’s Prince, but this strain has been
kept in the stud by the use of Narooma Lustre’s Prince
(8524), sired by Retford Fern’s Prince, ex Narooma Lustre.
To assist in carrying on the line of Kelvinside blood,
the bull, Nairfale Yuletide King (9839) was purchased
from Mrs. E. J. Booker. Sired by Noble of Yaralla (3383),
which has 13 daughters averaging 396-lb. fat, his dam was
Tidy s Pride of Kelvinside (10665), who produced 15,537 lb.
milk and 959.6 lb. fat in 365 days. Both the sire and dam of
Noble of Yaralla were sired by Retford Mariposa (896),
by Matilda’s Noble (imp.), by Noble of Oaklands. The
stock of Retford Mariposa were noted for breed type and
production. While only a few heifers by Nairfale Yuletide
King have completed an official test, it is confidently
expected that they will fulfil the hopes held for his stock.
His first six daughters as junior two-year-olds have an
average of 345 lb. fat in 273 days.
Narooma Lustre’s Monarch (8523), sired by Monarch
of Yaralla, and ex Kelvinside Brown Lustre, has been used
extensively the last few years; his heifers are now under
test and his first five averaged 322 lb. fat as two-year-olds,
Narooma Lusmon’s Maisie producing 349-lb. in 273 days.
The last purchased bull is Belgonia Peggy lOth’s
Prince (11357), from the famous herd of Mr. P. J.
Maloney, Tongala (V.). His sire is Duke of The Lake
(imp.), by Vinchelez Golden, who was one of the most
successful show sires on the Island, and the sire of the
1935, 1936 and 1937 champion bull at Brisbane Royal Show.
The dam of Duke of The Lake was a wonderful show cow,
Mistress Golden Thread, who, at an advanced age, produced
576 lb. fat in the lactation.
The dam of Peggy lOth’s Prince is Peggy 10th of
Belgonia (38831), by Aveley Rex (6612), ex Silvermine
21st of Banyule, by Audrey’s Lord Twylish. The dam of
Peggy 10th was Belgonia Peggy 6th, who, besides being a
noted Show cow and a reserve champion at Melbourne,
has produced over 600 lb. fat in a lactation. Belgonia
Peggy lOth’s Prince has as yet no stock milking at
Narooma, but it is evident that he is going to have a
marked influence on the type of the Narooma cattle. His
dam has a two-year-old record of 475 lb. fat and it is
felt that his heifers will be high producers.
