Foreign Lad’s Action
Another bomb which fortunately
failed to explode, fell into the com-
pounds of the' victoria . Nursing
Homo, 117 Boone Road, ‘and of No.
1 Aibury Road, shortly after two
o’clock. This struck the roof and
wall of the nurses’ quarters and
caused slight damage. No. 1 Al-
oury Road is a house occupied by
Messrs. M. R, f Pereira and Mr. E.
Marques who fortunately escaped
unscathed. With great presence of
mind, a youth : named Alfred Sulli-
van, whose father is a member of
the S.M.P. Specials, picked it up
and handed it to his father, who
promptly placed it in a bucket of
water and removed it to Hongkew
Police Station. The police later
handed tb -over to the Japanese
Marine headquarters.

tween Raining and Boone Boada,

Road, off Range Road, was
/mg in the street with a bullet
round in his chest and thafe it was
rtipossdble to remove him .to hos-
pital as he was between, two fines.
The French Concession
The only exciting events of the
day in the French Concession were
concerned with, -the falling of shells
of, Ub is believed, the anti-aircraft
variety. The first to all and those
which. gave rise' to the story of
the Japanese having! dropped a
bomb near the Qual de France
were, ait about ,7.10 am,. There'
were two of them and they fell
hear the China Merchants’ Kin
Lee Yuen Wharf and the. Water
Tower and: by these no fewer than
eight Chinese were wounded.
At 7,20 a.m. another fell at No.
10 Rue du conisulat wounding one
Ohlh&Je. - 1 -,
At-1.40 p,m, another shell.fell at
the junction of Rue Ponn-ose and
the Qual de France.' Ten minutes
later one dropped at the junction
of. Rue Pere Robert and , Rue
■'Lafayette,' and at 2.20 pjm. one fell
in Rue Lafayette. In these last
two occasions two were Injured.

Volunteer Stabs
Chinese Prisoner
Alleged Sniper Placed
In Truck, Bayoneted
By S.V.C. Member
A Japanese member of the
Shanghai Volunteer Corps, In full
uniform, was the principal in a
bayoneting affair staged at the
comer of Range and North Sze-
chuen Roads yesterday afternoon,
Chinese snipers, hidden behind
shop and residence windows and
perched behind chimneys on roofs ■
were taking pot shots at the Japan-
ese bluejackets and Japanese volun-
teers in the street below and this
led to a series of raids in which
scores of arrests were made.
The bayoneting was cold-blooded
and brutal, according to Mr. N. a
Isaacs, a member of-the Municipal
Police Specials, who was an eye-
witness. Three suspected snipers
had been shot dead by Japanese
bluejackets, aided in a raid by the
volunteex-s, Pour other men In the
same house, all of them well dress-
ed, were led out by the Japanese
bluejackets. Tlie prisoners had
their hands knotted behind them
with lengths of rope.
A Japanese truck pulled up when
hailed and the Japanese volunteers
commenced the task of . hoisting
the prisoners aboard. The four
men were tossed in like so many
sacks. As they lay on the floor of
the vehicle, a Japanese volunteer,
according to Mr. Isaacs, struck the
man In the abdomen with his
bayonet. %
There was a .groan from the Chi-
nese. who was particularly well
dressed, Mr. Isaacs stated. The
volunteer and the other Japanese
looked at him, pushed, him closer
to the other prisoner and then
ordered the driver to proceed north-
wards along North Szechuen Road,
presumably to the Japanese landr
inig force headquarters on Klang-
wan Road.
Mere Youths
Numerous batches of prisoners
were removed in trucks which kept
passing to and from headquarters,
the • men. many of them mere
youths, being bundled in, either
trussed together In pairs or singly,
Many seemed bewildered and while
.some of the.prisoners may have
been guilty of sniping or have
knowledge of such 'activities, it ap-
peared to the many foreigners
gathered at the intersection that the
majority of the prisoners were in
a daze as to the reason for their
arrest, Mr. Isaacs stated.
The Chinese arrested offered no
. resistance, apparently cowed by the
determined, drastic action of the
Japanese bluejackets and volunteers,
all of whom had either pistols,
rifles or swords in their hands,

AMERICAN LAD
“ARRESTED”
Taken by Japanese as
Sniper
An American lad, named Johnson
was arrested yesterday morning, at
2 Scott Road. A party of Japan-
ese marines entered the house and
seized the 15-year old hoy and took
him off to the marine landing
party headquarters.
A foreigner who witnessed the,
whole affair stated yesterday that
there had been some sniplngt in
the vicinity. The Japanese ap-
peared) and opened their rifles’
and a machine gun on an exchange
, shop next door. They riddled
j windows and doors, Inside was
j an elderly Chinese woman, who was
1 not struck.
Then they entered the house,
which was tenanted by the lad, his
brother being in the Volunteer
Corps and his father in the
Central district. They searched the
nlace and found a 45 Colt pistol
and a large quantity of spent
ammunition, which the boy said
that he and his friends had picked
up ait the Rifle Range. These were
being kept in an ordinary wash
basin. The Japanees asserted, how-
ever, ' that they found four , hot
-'Minds. The pistol was under a
mattress. In sprite of the .Tad’s
protests he was taken away.
An American vice-consul called
at the Japanese Consulate-General,,
demanding the release of the lad.
'•te was informed that the Japan-
ese would ascertain from the am-
ines if they held the lad. If so,
’->e would ' arrange? for his release.
This had not' been done by 9,33
pan,, yesterday.
Another Case
William Chong, 15 years of age,
whose Chinese name is Liang Wei-
■chib, was arrested between four
and five o’clock on . Friday after-
noon. William Chong was bom in
Sydney, Australia, and he possesses
his birth papers but his. parents
were not British subjects so. .It is
believed, he was not registered at
H.B.M. Consulate-General,
According to a statement made
MISSION ENTERED
BY TROOPS
Japanese Invade Methodist
School In Quinsan Road
A protest and an appeal tor pro-
tection. was filed by the Rev. J, C.
Hawk; D. D.. treasurer of the
Methodist Episcopal Church, South,
Mission, 10 Young Alien Court, with
the United 'States Consulate-Gen-
eral yesterday.
According to Dr. Hawk, shortly
after 1 a.m. yesterday some 30
Japanese marines and plain clothes
men entered the Sooohow Univer-
sity Law School, a mission project
located at 103 Quinsan Road, beat
the cook, searched the dormitory
rooms of the students and caused
| considerable damage. Broken win-
dows, wooden doors slashed through,
with swords, . damaged furniture,
and students' rooms in great dis-
array are the aftermath of the in-
cident.
For example, the gloss of the.
bulletin boards in front of the uni-
versity was smashed, the contents
of fire extinguishers poured out on
the floor, and personal possessions
of the students, books, thermos bot-
tles, lamps, destroyed.
Their object,, according to- the
"searching party” was firearms.
None were found and, before tho
•tightened servants could summon
my Mission authorities, the Japan-
ese had vanished, This , morning,
however, the university was "sealed”
by the Japanese,
Much the same thing,occurred at

ODEON BLOCK IS
GUTTED
Many Reported Shot by
Japanese as Snipers
FLAMES TERRORISE
HONGKEW AREA
With the, charred ruins of the
Railway . Station and Commercial
Press still smouldering, another
blaze started yesterday afternoon
behind the Odeon Theatre and in
several hours turned the entire
block on North Saeohuen Hoad,
Haskell Road, to the railway lino
.and, further down the. North Spe-
cimen Road, into ashes; Another
blaze was also reported In Chin-
yuan Road in Chapei near the
railway line, where more than. 100
honseq were razed.
With the entire area of the North
eweehuen Road and Range Road 1 in
the control of .the Japanese
marines, fire, engines of the Settle-
ment Brigade made vain efforts to
reach, the scene to combat the fire.
As the' flames were sweeping down
to the south side of Jukong Road,
menacing the Range Road block
in. the Settlement- the engines .were
allowed to pass to Range Road.
Firemen are still standing iby early
this morning to keep the blaze.from
touching the houses in the Settle-
ment,. in Haskell Road.
According to .Chinese eye witnes-
ses, the fire was started by Japan-
ese marines with tins, of kerosene,
determined to wipe out the entire
block. Should this action have been
taken by the marines, the Japanese
Consul-General said, lb was intend-
ed to wipe out the. snipers who have
proved such a deadly menace to the
soldiers.
Many viewed the flames in roof
tAutj in the Settlement leaping from
house to house in.oulck succession.
Many refugees residing in the block
flew for their lives in all directions.
It was reported that some were shot
dead bv the Japanese as snipers.
Residences Destroyed
Including the Gdeon Theatre
which was entirely gutted to the
ground with number’s of houses,
shops and godowns, wa* a Huang-
tuny Theatre and residences of
several wealthy Chinese. The pro-
perty of the entire block was owned
by Chinese.
At about 2 p.ra-, huge volumes of
smoke and flames were visible in
the . Central district. Those,, were
swept'by. 6. high wind and soon

During the day there were several
instances of Japanese activity in
other parts of Shanghai. The
American Marines detained a
total of 14 Japanese aimed civilians
who were found acting in the Amer-
ican sector and who stated, on de-
tention, that they had been order-
ed by their own authorities to pro-
ceed to that district. At 8.15 p.m.
tho Marines In Haiphong Road en-
countered two groups of aimed
Japanese who fired over the head
of a Marine sentry into Chinese
territory. The sentry detained nine
of the men.
At 8.23 p.m., two Chinese were
shot and killed by Japanese in
front of the Japanese marine bar-
racks ,at 102 Gordon Road which
■is inside the American defence area.
At 8.45 pm. four more Japanese
were detained by T 7, S. Marines In
the same district.
Japanese were also found in
charge of a police sub-station at
the corner of Robison and Penang
Roads and were evicted by British
troops after considerable difficulty.
Tho situation in Hongkew last
night was serious up to a late hour.
Gradually during the day, large
numbers of Japanese reservists in
nlaln clothes extended their control
from Hainlng Road up .to Soochow
Greek and by 7 p.m., they were in
practically full control of the whole
of Hongkew area dispossessing the
Municipal Police of. .whom five
patrols. comprising foreigners, Sikhs
| and Japanese, were withdrawn from
the streets by headquarters’ orders.
,tn the meantime, the reservists had
assumed police, powers and were

be established.
Tho greater part of Hongkew was
in complete darkness, Japanese
naval patrols early in the evening
having gone up and down the
streets shooting out the overhead
eleotxlc lights. (Lights which were
not put out by bullets were put out
by sticks. The reason was given
that the step, was necesasry so that
the patrols could operate without
being seen by snipers who were re-
ported to be infesting the district.
Considerable confusion was creat-
ed and there were several shooting
incidents. A foreign police ser-
geant saw a Japanese patrol shoot
at a crowd of Chinese on Woochang
Road but there were no casualties.
The body of a male Chinese was
found on Broadway with knife and
bayonet wounds in his body. Two
9ikh policemen going on duty were
searched by reservists. Japanese
action also occurred against isolated
incidents of sniping.
Starting at 5 -p.m,, . the Indian
police hospital on Woosung Road
waa evacuated of its patients who
were removed to other quarters,
and it is reported that patients of
tho Isolation. Hospital may be
evacuated to-day, Members of the
Indian hospital staff were subject-
ed to search as they left the in-
stitution.
Fire Brigade ambulances came
in for attention by the Japanese,
who declared that their trim Into
the district were attracting the at-
tention of sniper’s and after 11 p.m.,
the ambulances censed to visit the
district.
By 1.15 o’clock 'this morning the
district was,quiet, Japanese opera-
tions having apparently . ceased, al-
though there wag sniping bevond

functions wero resumed and a party
of foreigners were on duty at the

Dangerous Misrepresentations
If the world believed Japanese
official statements concerning the
Shanghai crisis it would certainly
have difficulty In believing its own
Shanghai Officials and press corres-
pondents-
Dispatches from interested
capitals have brought surprising-
tidings of misrepresentations by
Japan’s spokesmen,
Prom the official . Japanese ex-
planation of Japan’s sudden mili-
tary action after satisfactory Chi-
nese ■ assurances had been received,
on through a long list of detailed
statements and assurances, there
has been no indication that facts
known to everyone here have been
admitted.
Consider the single incident of
the last London Foreign Office com-
munique, one paragraph of which
said:
“The Japanese Minister for For-
eign Affairs, in reply, - gave assur-
ances that he fully appreciated the
anxiety felt by, the British Govern-
ment and said that everything pos-
sible would bc’done not to endanger
British lives and property, and that
tlie International Settlement would
not be used as a base for attack.”
The actuality is that lives, pro-
perty and ordinary rights of foreign
residents have been endangered by
the Japanese forces ; more, there
has been wanton destruction of for-
eign and Chinese property • by
Japanese within the International
Settlemejit areas which they pro-
fessed to guard, while the Interna-
tional Settlement has been used as
a base of attack from the vary be-
ginning .of the whole mishandled
affair.
Japanese authorities have done
their best to convince the world
that their actions were previously
known to the Shanghai representa-
tives of other foreign Powers, and
that there .was full approval and
agreement of these actions—that
Japan,, in fact, -had actually borne
the brunt of a necessary fight for
the common cause.
. The truth is that Japan’s naval,
authorities here acted wilfully,
without due consultation with their
associates or warning to Chinese
civilians; that far from moving on.
behalf of others, they went out of
their way to start a fight which
they couldn’t handle and which has
provoked the gravest of possible
consequences for us all.
Not only has Chinese fighting
spirit and conviction of military
potency, received the greatest brace
in years; the Japanese misuse of
International Settlement soil, . and
apparent ’ acquiescence in such
misuse by the other Powers, has
aroused a, growing Chinese feeling
that other foreigners must be lump-
ed in with the Japanese as targets
for national resentment. A dyna-
mite situation has been created in
which Japan’s military are moral
. and physical liabilities to other for-
eigners. :
Sanctimonious Japanese, declara-
tions regarding what is termed “the
true position"—apparently in con-
trast to the allegedly false reports
of everyone but the Japanese—can-
not alter one fact which the world
increasingly realizes:
Association with the Japanese
acta or program against China is
morally impossible for any other
nation either neutral or friendly to-
ward China.

A number of Americans were in a
precarious position shortly after 6
o’clock yesterday morning in their
residences on the installation pre-
mises of the Texas Oil Co., down
stream, when a Japanese destroyer
opened fire on them with machine
guns. With .the first outburst for-
eigners in the houses and Chinese
in offices and yards, ducked for
cover at once, Not a few of them
became familiar with the floors and
earth. The bursts of fire were in-
termittent for a. few minutes only.
An American destroyer which had
been ordered previously to take up
a position, at the wharf, steamed
down and tied up. It is suggested
that no. further machine guns,
whatever their source,, will open up
on the property.
. Other than, causing great ■ con-
sternation among those in the com-
pound, little damage was done. As
far as could be ascertained the
spray of bullets did not penetrate,
any of tho tanks. A few, however,
went through windows and . offices.
Tho destroyer steamed by and con-
tinued her way towards .Woosung,
Employees at the plant got into
Immediate communication with the
Shanghai office, who took up the
matter with Mr. E. S. Cunningham,
U. S. Consul-General. It is under-
stood that the attack on American
property will become the subject of
diplomatic negotiation.
Eyeivitnesfi Story
, According, to the account : of an.
employee of the company, an eye-
witness to the firing, he was in his
quarters, when the firing began.
"At first I thought it was some-
one firing crackers.. I looked :from
the window and saw. the bullets
spreading on the foreshore. X duck-
ed.at once, avoiding several, which
came through the window. .The:,
dust rising from the 1 contact in the
yard and foreshore.. . recalled 1 ,
memories of previous incidents
elsewhere. I shouted .to those .in-
side to make for cover as I did like-
wise-” ...
. Then according to his account,
the firing continued: for a matter
of two or three minutes in intermit- ,
tent bursts, the destroyer steaming
outward all the while. An 'Ameri-
can destroyer, upstream near the.
Power station, heard the firing but
had, no information regarding it
until after the Japanese had gone
on its way...
When the firing had ceased and
those Inside got, into full possession


of their wits, an estimate of the
damage was made. There were no
casualties on the premises, but a
female In a village nearby, was
found to have been shot through
the shoulder, while another Chinese
had a bullet through his sleeve. In
the compound employees picked up
numerous bullets, which had
glanced oil buildings, while others
were picked up in the offices and.
rooms of houses having come
through windows. A considerable
spread of lead was found on the
foreshore,
It is understood that the de-
stroyer opened fire on some vill-
agers behind the premises who had
.lighted a bunch of firecrackers.

POLICE PATROL
FIRED ON
Other Foreigners Also by
Japanese Marines
According to the eye-witness re-
ports of foreign police on duty In
the vicinity of the shooting, a police
van loaded with duty details from
the telephone exchange on Hai-
ning Road, was fired on by Japan-
ese Marines near Tiendong and
North Szechuen Roads intersection
at 3 a.m. yesterday. None of the
occupants of the van was struck by
bullets, although a survey made
later, in. the day indicated 15 ma-
chine bullets in the wall of a, gar-
age opposite.
Another similar incident was wit-
nessed by the same persons half an
hour later. A foreign couple were
engaged in. an altercation with their
chauffeur, near the, Tiendong Road
corner. The chauffeur drove off
and the couple eventually made
their way out. Still later a British
subject was fired on.
, These same observers also report-
ed that Japanese Marmes were
firing from a sandbag post in front
of the General Hospital.
In order to. avoid any such in-
cidents, last night,, details on guard
at .the exchange and at the Power
Company sub-office were sent out
at 6 pm. with provisions to last
until morning and blankets as well.

MORE FIRES IN
GHAPEI
Commercial Press Library
Burnt
. Severalhew .fires were reported
from the Ohapei district yesterday,
one: of the, : buildings. burnt being
the Commercial Press Library in
Paoshan Road, opposite. the main
section of the printing concern.
In each instance, the flames was
accompanied by fairly heavy' rifle
and machine gun fire.
Smoke was noticed coming from
beneath the eaves of the main
building of the Commercial Press
which, it may be recalled, was one
of the first buildings to go up in
flames several days ago and a
couple of large and spreading fires
were seen between Tientungan and
Klangwan shortly before four
o’clock. The belief was expressed
that, in the case of the latter, the
buildings involved were a couple
of universities in that vicinity. The
library fire broke out at about 12
o’clock.
As the Hongkew area has been
evacuated, all the Hongkew fire
engines, with the exception of two,
have been moved to this side of the
Soochow Creek. On Sunday after-
noon, the Japanese reservists as-
saulted a foreign member of the
Fire Brigade, after threatening him
with pistols.
The Commercial Press Library is
known as the National Eastern
Library and it is said to be the
largest institution of its kind in this
country. It was housed In a large,
three-storyed concrete building in
Paoshan Road, opposite the main
plant of the Commercial Press.

POLICE SEARCH OF
HOSPITAL
Report of Snipers in
Premises
A -party of Hongkew police in
charge of Chief Inspr. Bing made
a search of the compound and
■buildings yesterday of the Isolation
Hospital, subsequent to a report
from Japanese naval sources that
snipers had been firing from the
roof,.
About 3 pm., the party consist-
ing of foreigners, Japanese and
Specials, with a supporting force
of Sikhs, armed themselves with
Thompson suibs, 45 Colts and rifles,
and having donned steel waistcoats,
marched from Hongkew station to
Fearon Road. Det.-Sub-Inspr. Hill
was hoisted over the gate and drew
back the Iron lockbar, whereupon
the party entered and made for the
main door. ...•■.
They made a thorough and com-
plete search of the ■ rooms and
buildings which had been evacuated
on Sunday morning. They found
that many of the windows had been
broken and the furniture in dis-
. order, but no suspicious persons
. were within. Inquiries at the Chi-
nese section, which still was occu-
pied, were fruitless.
In spite of the Japanese request
that the Municipal police should
■mako this search, it was later
•ascertained that a. party of 25 'Ma-.
rincs had gone into the premises
at 1.30 p.m., two hours previously.

CULTURAL LOSS
TO NATION
National Eastern
Library Burned
UNIQUE EDITION OF
ENCYCLOPAEDIA
Chapel can be rebuilt, but the
books destroyed in this conflagra-
tion, described by Chinese as a cul-
tural catastrophe to the nation, can
never be replaced. No similar liter-
ary disaster has overtaken this
country since the Boxers set fire to
the famous Hanlin library in Pek-
ing during the attack on the Lega-
tion Quarter there In the rising of
1900.
Escape First Fire
The library building stood im-
mediately opposite the Commercial
Press plan, on the other aide of the
road. During the fire which, as a
result, of bombs dropped by Japan-
ese planes, completely destroyed
that printing plan, the library es- .
cape unscathed, though other build-
ings in the neighbourhood were
licked up by the flames.
Built to house thousands of books,
many of which were unique ex-
amples of old China’s learning and
civilisation, the National Eastern
Library rose four storys above the
surrounding houses, every known
device to ensure that it was fire-
proof having been employed to safe-
guard its valuable contents. Its
destruction, therefore, lands cur-
rency to the claim that the blaze
was started by incendiaries.
Among its most precious contents
was a complete original set of the
Chinese encyclopaedia, the "Shih
Koo Chucm Hsu” of which there
are now only two complete sets left
in the country. Though the Com-
mercial Press has printed modern
editions of the “Shih Koo Chuan
Hsu’’— which numbers Itself in
thousands of books—the old origin-
als have lost none of their value.
The two other' complete sets are
boused one in Peking,, the other in
Hangchow. ■
, Many other ancient manuscripts,
dating back to. remote periods and
treasured as priceless relics, were
also destroyed in the fire. These
included more than one thousand
books of the various hsien of China,
records and historical tales relating
to the districts which are now lost
forever.
Valuable Foreign Books
In addition to Chinese books, the
Library housed a valuable collec-
tion of books in foreign languages,
which have likewise been destroyed.
Tills collection had taken many
years to get together and represent-
ed one of the foundation stones of
modem Chinese • learning.

Tales Of Horror Are Told By
Residents Trapped In Hongkew
Streets Strewn With Bloody Corpses, Women And
Children Cruelly Shot Down, Says Witness
Women and children killed as
they fled from burning houses.
Nights of terror, filled with the
moans of wounded and dying. The
roar of death-dealing Implements of
warfare.
These horrors were seen, felt and
heard by three foreign families who
lived through five days of a verit-
able nightmare in the Lincoln Ter-
race, across from Hongkew Park.
Only yesterday, they escaped from
the scene of battle and made their
way back to safety.
Trapped In Homes
Two German families, Mi*, and
Mrs. H. Beckor, and Mr. Hans
Krenn, and an English family, Mr.
and Mrs. T. J. Ellis and their two
children, were the only foreigners
in the Lincoln ten-ace.
Trapped in the center of the war
zone, these seven foreigners were
forced to stay in their homes from
Friday until Tuesday, while death
and destruction hovered near and
threatened their lives at every
minute.
Attempted Escapes Frusira'ted
Japanese launched their attack
on the region so suddenly that they
were caught before they had a
chance to leave. Appeals to the
Japanese authorities availed them
nothing. Many attempts to leave
the district, they said, were frust-
rated by unruly mobs of Japanese
in plain clothes. Marines stopped
them at the points of bayonets. .
When Incendiaries started burn-
ing the houses in the neighborhood,
the three families took all precau-
tions to protect their property. Chi-
nese servants In the 35 houses in
Lincoln Terrace placed white bands
on their arms to identify them from
looters and fire bugs, and the
families prepared to. make armed
resistance to attacks on their pro-
perty.
. Several gangs of supposed loot-
ers and incendiaries were driven
from the place with shots from the
foreigners’ pistols. Japanese pro-
the League of Nations by a group
of Chinese educational leaders pro-
testing against the destruction of
the Library and charging that the
Japanese authorities : are respon-
sible for -"the disaster. The League
is urged to take steps to check.

tion of books being directly attri-
buted to the Japanese action.

mised them protection, and Chinese
told them they would spare their
homes.
Scoters Driven Away
But Tuesday, fires were started
in the houses next to theirs, and
they were forced to snatch up
what personal belongings they could
carry, and leave amid smoke and
confusion.
When they reached the Japanese
lines, they threw up their arms and
walked across, not knowing whether
or not they would escape with their
lives.
Tragic Tales Unravelled
They made good their escape,
which they attribute, to the fact
that a Japanese friend saw their
plight and helped them get across.
Mr. Becker, who had been' asked
by his consul to make no statements
to the newspapers, followed the
wishes of the German office and re-
fused to divulge the many tragic
scenes he witnessed from the win-
dows of his home.
Mr. Krenn, who had not com-
municated with consular authori-
ties Wednesday morning, told many-
tragic tales of the five . nights of
terror.
Bloody Corpses
“The streets were strewn with
dead bodies,” he said. “Yelping,
hungry dogs were tearing them
apart. We could, not. see the bodies,
there were bo many dogs. We shot
to scare them out, but the dogs did
not stay away.
“We saw dark figures creep up
to a house and set fire to it. When
the Chinese who lived there ran
from the smoking houses, they were
shot down in their tracks. I saw
four bodies slump to the ground as
they left the doors. There were men,
women and children.
Women Shot Down
“A Chinese shopwoman who lived
across the street started to leave
her shop, her baby in her arms,
when she was shot down, The next
day she was still alive, her baby
clinging to her. Chinese servants
in one of the houses in the Terrace
ran out and picked her up.
“She was carried into one of the
houses and given attention. When
we left, both she and the baby still
were alive.
“When Chinese attempted to re-
move the bodies of the dead, they
were assailed with rifle and
machine gun Are from the Japan-
ese. They were forced to leave
the bodies, tb rot in the street and
be torn apart by the' dogs.
Servants Loyal
“Chinese servants remained loyal
to the foreign families. When fire
bugs, who threatened to burn the
houses, came near the place, the
servant captured one. a Chinese
boy, and tied him to a stake, threa-
tening to burn him. They told
them that they had'three of their
number imprisoned in the houses,
and. that they would bum them ’if
the houses were set on fire, . This
complicated matters for us for we
wanted to anger neither side.”
Tho servants were in a state of
panic when the foreigners left.
They did not want them to go,
they said, and implored them to
remain with them. The servants
were those of the 35 houses in the
terrace, most of them occupied by
Japanese, who had fled.
Mobs Are Cruel
Japanese mobs were extremely
cruel, the foreigners said. Chinese
were beaten, stabbed and shot.
None were spared, neither men, wo-
men nor children.
One of the foreigners said that
he recognized several of the Ja-
panese members of Japanese volun-
teer forces. They had been em-
ployees of banks and other busi- •
ness houses with whom he had
done business in the past. .
Japanese Make Jokes
“The Japanese who recognized
me,” he said, “laughed at me and
made jokes about my plight as I
struggled under a load of belong-
ings, to get out of the danger area.”
The foreigners said that,, during -
the . many years they had lived in
this area, they had never had the
least trouble with the Chinese,
Chinese Bring Food
“When the trouble came” he said,
"and .wo ran short of .'food, .Chi-
nese families and servants in the .
neighborhood braved the, danger
that always lurked there, and
brought us rice and mutton and
other foods, and charcoal for our
stoves,”
They said that the ■ Chinese
soldiers never had crossed into- the
settlement. . It was their opinion
that the Japanese were. trying. to
tempt Chinese -militia into the set-
tlement, But, they said,. the. Chi-
nese forces did not move an inch
into the foreign zone, but merely
protected their own property.
Homes Believed Gone
When the seven foreigners- left
their homes, they were enveloped in
smoke from the surrounding houses,
and they believe that by. now all
of their property is destroyed.
Mr. Krenn's house fortunately
was surrounded by other buildings
in the colony, so .it was not ex-
posed so’ much to rifle and. machine
gun fife as the other homes. Be-
cause Mr. Ellis' house was exposed
on one side, his family, moved in
Mr.' Krenn’s home. Mr. and Mrs.
Becker remained in their own.-home
until the. time, of - departure.. .

BLAZES SEEN IN
ALL AREAS
Barricades Broken In
HongkeW
Mres were reported practically
from all . parts of Shanghai yester-
day but perhaps the biggest were
outbreaks on the north side of Soo-
chow Creek in the Jessfield District,
at 2.4 S p.m.; in Woosung, at 9.30
p.m, and, at Pootung, near Kao-
chiao, at 8.30 p.m. A large number
of reports came from the Chapel
District but it was impossible to as-
certain the whereabouts of these
or to get near them, because they
were outside of the Jurisdiction of
the Shanghai Municipal Fire Bri-
gade. However, it is known de-
finitely that one of them involved
the well-known Japanese geisha
gardens, known as Rokkusan, at
the northern end of Paoshan Road.
While there was no possibility of
ascertaining the origins of the out-
breaks, It was thought that most of
them were caused as a result of the
Japanese aerial bombardment or
falling shells.
Outbreaks in Hongkew
Eight houses were burnt In a fire
in the Hongkew District, at the cor-
ner of North Szechuen and Tien-
dong Roads (behind the Post
Office), at 11.30 a.m. The machine,
turned out from Central Station
and. it was found that the roads
had been barricaded by the Japan-
ese marines. When work was com-
menced on the tearing down of
these, it was thought that there
would, ,be objections , from the
Japanese but there was none and
the operations were carried out as
usual.
Just as this fire had ended, and
the Brigade was preparing to return
tb headquarters, another call was
received at 12 o’clock from the cor-
ner of North Szechuen and Boone
Roads* about 200 yards away. Fire
fighting work was started and, by
the : time it was over,, four houses
had .been damaged. .
At 8.30 p.m., a report came to
Shanghai of a huge fire in the Poo-
tung.District, near Kaochiao. This,.
It was learned, took place in the,
Kuang Hua Oil Company’s tanks’
and the oil involved was imported
by ; the Soviet Naptha Trust. The
glare from this could be seen from
the “North-China Daily News" root
until ;,shortly before ten o’clock,

be a disastrous fire was reported
from the Woosung area: No~detiiis
of this were available. .

"WELCOME
ENDORSEMENT
To the Editor :
We, the undersigned residents of

hai, wish to commend you for the
frank and courageous Editorial “To
Those Who Have Abused a Trust”
which appeared on the front page
of your issue of February i, touch-*
ing the present, aggression of Japan
against China.
We feel that it is time some
public words were spoken that
would show the' amazement and in-
dignation with which foreign re-
sidents in Shanghai have witness-
ed the trampling under foot of
human justice and righteousness in
the tragic events of the past two
weeks. . And we believe we speak
for the conscience of the whole
civilized world.
With International law disregard-
ed, the blood of innocent men,
women, and children calling for
justice, and a torn and straggling
people patiently waiting for the
verdict of humanity, we add our
voices to yours in calling for the
cessation of this “undeclared war”
and withdrawal of the , Invading
forces. We believe, firmly, that we
speak for lovers of righteousness in
Japan, as well as for the suffering
people of this land.

Urging immediate representations
to the Japanese authorities in re-

District, Brigadier-General E. B.
Macnaghten, chairman of the
Shanghai Municipal Council, has
addressed a letter to the Senior
Consul, Mr. E. S. Cunningham,
drawing attention to the grave re-
percussion of certain activities of
the Japanese Naval Landing Party
in sectors other than their own
upon the peace and order of • the
Settlement and strongly supporting
the protest of the Defence Com-
mittee.
Brig.-Oeneral Macnaghten also
directs Mr- Cunningham’s attention
to the grave situation which has
arisen through the activities of
Japanese armed, forces and armed
civilians in the northern and east-
ern areas of the disruption of the
public services and frightened the
inhabitants. Particular reference is.
made to the fact that members of
the Municipal Police and Police
Watchmen have been forcibly de-
prived of their arms and ammuni-
tion and prevented from executing
their duty: members of the Fire
Brigade, whilst on duty and in uni-
form, have been obstructed and
assaulted, and the utmost difficulty
experienced in the conduct of food
and hospital services on account of
the obstruction of Japanese naval
and civilian patrols and pickets.
Immediate representations to . the
Japanese Authorities are urged.

APPOINTED
The Consular Body have appoint-
ed a committee of three under the
chairmanship of Mr. N. Aall, Con-
sul-General for Norway, to super-
intend, in co-operation with the
Japanese authorities, the handing
to the Shanghai Municipal Coun-
cil of Chinese, whom the Japanese
Naval Forces took into custody as
hostages or for other reason, during
the recent operations. This Com-
mittee will exercise no judicial
authority. It will act purely in a
benevolent capacity.
Last night 117 Chiaiese arrested
in Hongkew and elsewhere, • were
handed over, to the Settlement
police. The latter at once brought
them food and drink and cigarettes
In, the temporary barracks.
They were a pitiful sight. Ac-
cording to police officers, the first
question of the majority was, “Are
you going to shoot us? If so. do
it at once and put us out of oux
misery.”
Many of them had not eaten for
three days. They were in such a
•nervous condition that they could
not eat the, congee, which had been
obtained from the gaol. They lolled
about in their quarters, jumping
nervously whenever the door opened.
Rushed To Hospital
A police doctor attended at once.
His examination proved that one
man was so critically ill that he
had to be rushed to tire operating
table at St. Luke’s Hospital. Three
others, suffering from bullet wounds
and stabs, were taken cavo of ac-
cording to the degree of their
wounds.
The police reported last night
that they were -still detaining 10 or
12 others, who, although badly in-
jured from, bayonet wounds, had to
await medical attention this, morn-
ing. Most of them have been stab-
bed in the sides or buttocks.. one
little child of three , screamed in
terror as a kindly police officer
put iodine into a raw wound.
The No. 1 boy in the Palace Hotel
snack, room’ was among the released.
He was captured eight days ago
while wearing hotel uniform. For
six of the eight days he was bound
hand . and . foot.- His wrists are a
mass to wounds caused by penetrat-
ing twine, with which he was bound.

Extremely good morale.
Complete lack of hysteria.
Those are the chief impressions
of Chinese soldiers and their com-
manders gained by two representa-
tives of The Shanghai Evening Post
and Mercury who made a complete
circuit of the troop positions in the
Municipality of Greater Shanghai
Sunday.
The tour was not a "personally
conducted” one. The two men
were possessed of military passes
■which gave free access to any part,
of the lines which they desired to
visit, and beyond showing them at
the point of entry, no escorts were
provided, and few eo7?m£mders
visited.

quest of the reporters.

property has suffered forcible entry
and wanton destruction.
The first instance was that of
the law school operated by the Me-
tliodisb Episcopal Church, South, at
Young Allen Court, One of the first
of many acts of unwarranted and
inexcusable violence by armed
Japanese in and out of uniform
was a midnight raid on tills pro-
perty. We have already commented
on this disgraceful affair.

byterian Mission Press was the

they were taken to either of the
Japanese schools. Three nights ago,
they were piled into a junk and

. A large truck whirled from Range
Road and sped up North Szechuen,
toward the Odeon Theater. The
vehicle, manned by Japanese blue-
jackets and ronlns, was full of fire-
wood, bundle upon bundle of it.
Another truck whizzed by. It was
full, of cans of kerosene. More
vehicles followed, similarly laden,
and all going in the same direction.
, The party moved along, following
the trucks. Foreigners, friends,
hailed them. The Japanese, these
foreigners reported, were hunting
gasoline and asking all pedestrians

been raided.

been used when the fires were set.
Japanese bluejackets and ronins
stood by and watched. Later fire-
men of the Shanghai Fire Brigade
came along, but were allowed to
start their impossible task only
after a long palaver, and then they
were restricted to confining the
flames so the Settlement proper
would not be endangered. And on
Saturday, February 6, a well of fire
still was to be seen in the ruins of
one of the buildings adjoining the
Odeon. That looked like oil.
It seemed as plain as day that
the Japanese forces had set fire to
the buildings in an attempt to rid
themselves of the sniper menace.
From Tientsin . however, there
comes the "true” explanation of
what happened. The Japanese In-
formation Bureau, of 22 Akebono
Road, Tientsin, in a circular under
dale of February 1, tells it all, thus:
“On January 30, a big fire broke
out in the neighborhood of the
Odeon Theater, believed to be the
work of the Chinese plainclothes-
men. The Japanese Fire Brigade
rushed to the spot aa well as the
International Fire Brigade. Efforts
are still being made to extinguish
the fire, but so far, it is still blaz-
ing,"
Life is like that, these days in
Shanghai!
(S. ,E. P., Fob. 9, 1932)
Several had been tightly bound
hand and foot during most of their
period of captivity, with resultant
wounds of wrists and ankles. Many
had not eaten for three days.
Treatment of the lot had been such
that they wore in a condition of
nervous breakdown.
All this within the International
Settlement}, all this by their “pro-
tectors” whose protection was of
such description that the captives
greeted Settlement police with
dazed looks and the words:
"Are you going to shoot us? Do
it quickly so our suffering will end!”
(S, E. P., Feb. 8, 1932)
LEAGUE’S REPORT ON
sHANCHAI
The trio of Consular officials—
with their trusty colleague and ob-
server by their side—have sent the
League of Nations an admirably
concise report on events leading up
to the. incidents of January 28 and
the happenings on the subsequent
days of January. In the main the
narrative —it avoids comment and
opinion with excellent discretion—
confirms the impressions given in
the columns of this journal. It
appears, from comments received
from Europe, to add little to infor-
mation already available there. De-
tailed examination of it may well
be deferred at the moment. It
may be sufficient to remark that it
in no way confirms the claims put
forward by the Japanese Govern-
ment regarding the intentions of
Admiral Shiosawa on the fateful
night, It will be noted that if the
Japanese troops were merely follow-
ing the example of the troops of
the other foreign nations, they, dis-
played originality in at least one
respect: their commander issued a
minatory proclamation to the Chi-
nese troops. There is ho record that
Brigadier Fleming or Colonel R. S.
Hooker felt Impelled to adopt that
course. The Oonsuls-General make
it very clear that the Council’s
Proclamation of a State of Emer-
gency was mainly inspired by the
earning given to the British and
other foreign Commanders by the
Japanese Naval authorities on the
morning of January 28. Post 7ioc
is not always propter hoc it is true
but it will be seen that the Conauls-
General, who had special opportuni-
ties for sensing the situation, are
in. no doubt. Logically, too, it seems
difficult to maintain the view that
Japanese action was merely part of
a concerted defence action called
into being to deal with the possible
consequences of Japanese action as
generally and not specifically in-
dicated on the morning in question'
In official form and, as trumpeted
abroad in advance by Japanese pro-
pagandists, General E. B. Mac-
naghten’s letter .to the Chinese
Ratepayers’ Association definitely
assigns the responsibility to the
Japanese , Government, His appre-
ciation of the position is strengthen-
ed by the Ciano Report. For the
rest It would be. impossible for any
resident of Shanghai to read the
document without coming to the
conclusion that, had the Settlement
been under other than international
control, its integrity' would have
been certainly and. .perhaps, ir-
revocably impaired.—(N.O.D.N., Feb.
10, 1932.)


FIRE BRIGADE’S PART
130 Calls Answered In 13 Days Of
Settlement’s Emergency
' The Shanghai Fire Brigade’s part
in the anxious times Shanghai has .
experienced since January 29 is ,
simply but eloquently told in iHie
daily bulletins posted up at the
Central fire station in Foochow
Road.
Picking up wounded, turning out
to fires some of which could not be
attended to owing to political con-
ditions and evacuation of hospital
patients from Hongkew all fell
within the Brigade’s duties and a
total of 130 calls was answered in
13 days, the majority being ambul-
ance calls.
Heralding a return to normal
conditions, firemen of the Hongkew
division responded to an alarm at
Jukong Road, at 7 am. yesterday.
Only a few days ago, Jukong Road
■was impossible for anyone to pass,
except for the Japanese marines
and plainclothes Japanese. Pour
Chinese houses were destroyed and
four others damaged as the result
of the fire, the origin of which was
not revealed. The houses had been
evacuated.
Of the 130 calls, the Brigade at-
tended many fires that were started
by shells, and sent many times am-
bulances in picking up those
wounded by bullets and bayonets.
Regarded as the greatest conflagra-
tions in the Shanghai history, the
flames in the commercial Press and
North Railway Station, were not at-
tended by the Settlement firemen.
These alarms would be responded in
times of peace. The -firemen at-
tempted to reach the Odeon blase
in North-Szechuen Road, but were
stopped by the Japanese.
It was not 11 hours after tire
first shot fired in Chapei that the
Settlement firemen felt the effect of
the warfare. The first call was
rushed to the Hongkew Fire Station
at shortly after 10 a.m., when an
ambulance was sent to Hashing
Road In picking up a Chinese male,
suffering from a bullet wound. The
call was quickly followed by another
ambulance call to North Haining
and Honan Roads, and a fire alarm
in Chapel, near the boundary of
. North Thibet Road and Haining
Road. A shell dropped at .25
Young Allen Court, near Boone
Road, also brought out the firemen
to the scene.
Prom that day onward, numerous
but . similar calls were turned , into
the Settlement fire stations. On
January 30, more than eight am*
balance calls and a similar number
of fire alarms Were received. The
ambulance calls were confined to
districts north of the Soochow
Creek, especially in the district con-
trolled by the Hongkew and West
Hongkew' Police Stations.
Removal of Wounded
Though the Japanese have been
in control of the Hongkew area
prior and after the opening of war-
fare, the reign of terror was not
brought to the attention of the Bri-
gade in the 7norn.i7l.ff of January 30,
when a riesha coolie with a knife
w ound inflicted by a Japanese
plainclothes man was picked up in
west Soochow Road. Fern minutes
later a Chinese with a bayonet
wound was conveyed from North
Ssechuen Road to a nearby hospit-
al. Similar calls for ambulances
continued for the following several
days and at a time the congestion
was so great that an acute shortage
for ambulances to meet the emer-
gency was felt, In Yangtszepoo
and Harbin Road districts, the calls
were also received. At 8.49 a.m. on,
January 30, a Chinese boy bayonet-
ed in the left shoulder was picked
up by officers of the West Hongkew
Police Station and sent to a hospit-
al by ambulance.
At 10 a.m., a fireman ascended to
the top floor of the Shanse Theatre
in North Shanse Road. No sooner-
had he faced the street through a
window, than a Japanese marine,
patrolling the street, opened fire.
The- bullet struck his neck and. the
fireman was rushed to the Lester
Chinese Hospital for treatment.
Several hours later a fire was start-
ed in the alleyway of the theatre,
this was. however, shortly after-,
wards put out by the Settlement
Brigade.
The activities of the Chinese
plainclothes men in Hongkew were
further accounted for the action_of
arson, as the result of which many
houses were burned down. One of
the most serious incidents: happened
on January 30, When the Odeon
block was -deliberately destroyed.
Firemen of the Hongkew Station
rushed to the scene upon the receipt
■ of the alarm from a watch tower.
Their duties were hampered as
; traffic on North Szechuen Road was
1 blocked by the marines and plain-
l clothes mm in that area.—(N. O. D.

REFUGEE CAMP
BOMBED
50 Persons Killed in Yin
Ying Road, Chapei
PROTESTS MADE TO
AUTHORITIES
Declaring that the flood refugee
camp in Yiu Ying Road, chapel,
was bombed several times by
Japanese aeroplanes, and that over
50 innocent, lives were lost, Sir John
Hope Simpson, Director-General of
the National Flood Relief Commis-
sion, has addressed the following;
letter to Mr. T. V. Soong, who is
chairman of the Commission;—
“I have to report to you that a
camp of flood refugees on tho Yiu
Ying Road, two miles northwest of
the North Station, and on the
border of Chapei, contained, on
January 26, 10,399 refugees, and a
staff of 49 members. After the first.
Japanese bombardment of Chapei
oil January 29, about 2,000 of these
refugees fled, but over 8.000 remain-
ed in the camp, and were, as .usual,
fed and sheltered.
"On February 5, the camp was
bombed by Japanese planes about
noon. A woman and a boy were
killed on the spot, four persons .
were wounded, and some of the
patients In the hospital died of
fright- Most of the refugees fled,
and there remained in the camp
only a few hundred persons, the
majority of whom were, sick In
hospital or aged people who found ■
it difficult to get away.
Unnecessary and Inhuman
“Tho following day Japanese
planes again bombed the camp,
and, after the bombardment, 48
dead wore found in the camp, most
of whom had been patients in the
hospital. With the exception of
about 20 people, the occupants of
the camp were removed and it was
again bombed the following day,
February 7. It was then entirely
evacuated, and, as the relieving
party was about to leave the camp,
the planes returned and dropped 1 a
bomb which damaged a house be-
side the camp.
“I have protested against this
action in a letter to the Japanese
Consul-General, pointing out that
the 'action appears to have been un-
necessary, and was certainly in-
human. I said that no military ~
advantage whatever can have been
gained by these attacks on a camp.
occupied by homeless refugees from
the flooded areas, the only result
has been the sacrifice of over 50
perfectly innocent lives. .
“I sent a copy of my letter .to
the senior member of the Consular
Body, with a request that its con-
-1 tents be conveyed to the members

Japanese Bomber Ignored Red-
Cross Flag, Simpson Declares
Murai’s Reply Regarding Bombing Of Refugee
Camp Draws Pointed Answer From Chairman
The bombing of the Liu Ying
Hoad flood refugee camp on
February 5 by Japanese airplanes
can not be blamed on military con-
tingency, is the gist of a reply sent
by Sir John Hope Simpson, director
general of the National Flood Re-
lief Commission, to Mr, K, Mural,
consul general for Japan.
In the letter, which was written
in reply to one sent by the Japan-
ese consul general expressing the
regret of the naval authorities lor
the bombing incident, Sir John
points out that the refugee camp
is about two, miles from the North
Station and at least a mile from
the nearest point on the Shanghai-
Nanking Railway, lino.
Mr. Mural's Letter
Mr. Mural's letter, which was
dated. February 15 and addressed to
the director general of the flood
relief commission, follows:
Sir:
I have the honor to acknowledge
the receipt of your letter of
February 15, 1932, calling ray atten-
tion to the bombing by Japanese
planes of a matshed of , flood relief
refugees on Liu Ying Road.
I lost no time in transmitting the
contents, of your letter to the
Japanese Naval Authorities, who in
reply have notified me to the effect
that in those days when the un-
hmim? incidents of bombing occur-
red,. the Japanese naval landing
forces were busily engaged in bomb-
ing the Chinese troops who were
incessantly, directing their bom-
bardment'at the Japanese forces
from their defence lines construct-
ed all, over the Ohapei district and
that the spot In question whore
bombs were dropped, unfortunately
not only happened to be located
quite adjacent to the Chinese posi-
tion but was protected With barbed
’wire.
However, the Naval Authorities
asked me to express their deepest
regret that so' many : food refugees
have been subjected to a serious
disaster by the bombing.
Letter Not Received
In, this connection, perhaps I
may call your attention to. the fact
that if you had been good enough
a notify me of the incident. of
February .5, immediately- after its
happening, the calamitous fate
which befell the unfortunate re-
fugees after February 6, might have
averted or at least lessened to a
■ great, extent.
I might add that according to a
circular from the senior consul, you
wrote:.to Mr. T. V. Soong stating
that you addressed me another let-
tor dated February 12, asking for
my reply. But I regret to inform
you that 1 have not yet received
your letter dated February 12 and
will appreciate if you make inves-
tigations into the matter,
I am, Sir,
Yours faithfully.
Sir John Replies
Sir John Hope Simpson's reply is
dated February 17 and reads as
follows:
Sir:
I have the honor to acknowledge
receipt of your letter of , February
15, 1932,. which was delivered to me
personally by your messag'd- at
12:30 p.m. today, February 17.
In your letter you acknowledge
receipt of my letter of February 15,
which I think must be a mistake
for February 10. the date on which
I sent my original letter.
. With reference to your last para-
graph, I beg to enclose a copy of
my letter addressed to you on
February 12. and of the enclosure
which was a copy of a telegram
which I forwarded to the League
of Nations on the evening of
February 11. The receipt of my
letter of February 12 is acknow-
ledged in the chit book by the seal
of your consulate-general.
Position of Camp Detailed
With reference to the contents
of your letter under reply, I note
that the Naval' Authorities have
asked you to express their deepest
regret that many flood refugees
have been, subjected to a serious
disaster by bombing. This expres-
sion of regret I shall have pleasure
in forwarding to the Chairman of
the Commission for notification to
its members.
With regard to the suggestion
that the camp was located adjacent
to the Chinese position and was
protected by barbed wire, I have
the honor to repeat. the statement
contained in my letter of the 10th
inst„, that, the' camp lay two miles
northwest of the North- .Railway
station and one mile from the near-
est point on the Shanghai-Nanking
Railway, and it cannot, therefore,
be described as adjacent to the Chi-
nese position. The statement that
the camp was protected with bar-b-
-ed wire is mistaken.
I have .caused an enquiry to be
made into, the whole occurrence,
and from that enquiry It-appears
that on February 2, before the
camp was bombed, a Japanese
aviator flew close over the camp
and waved his hand to the oc-
cupants. As there were 8,000 chil-
dren in the camp at the time, he
could not well have mistaken it
for a military encampment-
Airman TJsed Machine Gun
In addition, the bombardment of
February 5 was preceded by ma-
chine gunning which injured a Mr,
Ma, who was present in the camp
As in order to machine gun the
camp, the aviator concerned had to
descend to a low altitude, the sug-
gestion that the camp was consi-
dered to be a military encampment
would seem to be inexplicable.
Had I been Informed of the
bombing on February 5 at once, I
would of course, have protested on
that day, In. fact, however, the
report on the subject only reached
me after the bombing on February
7; which explains my failure to
address you earlier.
Finally I would draw your atten-
tion to the fact that a Red Cross
flag was flying at the gate of the
camp, and a Blue Cross Flag over
the hospital,
I am, Sir
Yours faithfully,
J. HOPE SIMPSON.
A Distressing Occurrence
Sir John Hope-Simpson's re-
strained protest to the Japanese
Consul-General on the bombing of
the flood refugee camp on three
successive occasions by Japanese
aeroplanes will cause a very pain-
ful impression. It will be seen from
the location of the camp and from
its nature and composition that no,,
military reasons appear to be ap-
plicable to an action of this kind.
The camp of some 10,000 refugees
was. reduced to 8,000 as the result
of the panic created by the bom-
bardment of Ohapei on January 29.
Exactly a week later the calm- of
the camp restored by • the devoted
labours of the helpers, was rudely
broken by Japanese bombs from the
air, two refugees being killed, four
wounded and some. of the invalids
in the hospital died of fright. The
population of the camp was further
reduced to a few hundred persons-
mainly sick and aged; They, were
notTeft . alone, the next day. the air-
bombing was resumed and ,48 re-
fugees, mainly patients in the hos-
pital- were killed. The occupants
of the. oarap wore tlieci all removed
with' the exception of 20, who on
the next day, again experienced the
visitation from the ■ air. Even In
the process:, of complete evacuation
the relieving party, was ; bombed-
Considering. that, these events
occurred long after the first. reac-
tion of world-opinion to the ; air-
bombing of Chapei was known,, ex-
planation, of this apparently-wanton
piece of cruelty will, on the face
of. it,, present considerable difficul-
ties.—(N. C. D. N,, Feb. 12,1932.)


BOMB FALLS ON
COTTON MILL
Six Killed, 15 Injured
In Markham Road
EXTENSIVE DAMAGE
Six Chinese were. killed and 15
injured at the. Wing On Cotton
Mill, 55 Markham Road, yesterday
morning when a bomb from
a Japanese aeroplane, crashed
through the root of the reeling
room doing extensive damage, The
bomb, which was explosive, wreck-
ed the reeling room, blowing some
of the workers to pieces, An in-
cendiary bomb also dropped but-
fell about 45 feet away and al-
though it sprayed the area with
sulphur and picric acid it caused
no casualties although 240 Chinese
were working in the building. ,
Lieut. J. S. Cook and 18 men of
the United (.States Marines were in
the mill at the time but none of
them was injured. The bombing
caused such a commotion that the
2,000 Chinese working in the build-
ing immediately stampeded, dash-
ing for safety.
The Wing On mill, which is
within Settlement limits, is about
a mile from. Markham Bead sta-
tion and several hundred yards
from Markham Road bridge. The
Japanese plane, which had been
bombing Chinese positions on the
other side of Soochow Creek, ap-
peared over the mill about 10.30
a.m. The bomb struck the roof
and exploded within a few feet
and as it dropped among the work-
ers in the reeling room the blast
shattered every window in the
vicinity and wrecked about 80
machines. So terrific was the ex-
plosion that pieces of mangled flesh
were scattered all over the room.
A panic . started ’ among the other
workers who immediately dashed
for the doors while the U.S.
Marines, instantly realising what
had happened,, worked their way
towards the. aft’ected. area to rescue
the injured.
Reeling Room Wrecked
An investigation revealed the
horror, of the catastrophe. Of 90
people normally working in the
room, about 60 had left for food
and the bomb dropped just over
the only exit. Two sides of the
room were enclosed, with fireproof
glass but not a. pane was intact.
The third wall, of substantial con-
struction, was standing, but the
fourth wall, originally built to con-
tain glass, was shattered,, all the
temporary bricks being out. In the
far . corner half the wall was blown
out while another corner was wreck-
ed, bricks and mortar scattering the
compound and many casualties were

Except for a few blocks of desert-

moe .the wheels of industry were
the .pulse of a busy and prosperous
industrial section, the district rt
completely deserted. Only the
blackened and jagged walls of ruin-
ed buildings remain as grim re-
minders of the days before the
forces of conquest, death, disease
and famine came to lay waste m
Ohapei.
Despite the fact that a short
truce, signed to allow Red Cros*
workers .to remove the dead and
wounded, and. refugees, from the
scenes of battle, was pierced by

Shanghai Evening ; Post and Mer-
cury editorial staff took advantage
of the lull in fighting, to survey on
their own. the scenes of the past
week’s carnage.
Few Bootes Open
Only, a few routes were open into

Iron 'beams of 12 inches were bent
by the force of the blast.
Immediately the Marines got to
work removing the dead and the
injured who were rushed to the
nearest hospitals and the Shang-

attending to any incipient outbreak
of fire.
The Wing On mill, at the out-
break . of the Shanghai troubles em-

of the workers the mill was re-
opened and restarted operations

POLICE OFFICER
ASSAULTED
Prevented from Going to
His Station
RONIN’S UNCALLED
FOR ATTACK
Sergeant G. W. Robinson, of
Harbin Road Police Station., was
the victim of an assault which was
■perpetrated in North SzeolTuen Road
■yesterday afternoon ,by a Japanese
“ronm” (reservist) after an at-
tempt had been made to prevent
him from proceeding to his station
to report for duty. The affair
was witnessed by Dr. H. Pedersen,
veterinary surgeon of the Public
Health Department, and by Mir. El
Kilner, Senior Chief Health Inspec-
tor.
■At about four o’clock yesterday
■afternoon, Sergeant Robinson was
going in a private motor oar along
North ©zechuen Road when he was
stopped at a spot about 15 or 20
yards to the south of Range Road
by a Japanese in plain clothes. The
latter demanded to know where he
was going and -the officer replied
that he was on his way to duty at
the Harbin Road .Police Station. .
' The. renin, who spoke English
fairly well, said "You cannot go
there,” so Sergeant Robinson de-
manded to know the reason. The
reply, whs that he was not on duty,
whereupon the foreign officer re-
plied that, under the present state
of. emergency, b e was always pn
duty. Has . uniform, he stated,
denoted that.
However, the nonin was ton in
bin decision. that neither officer nor
tho car could not .go forward, so
Sergeant. Robinson got out of the
cai' and walked northwards. He
was. followed by the reservist, .Who
struck- .him a biow, in the back. As
ha-, turned, the Tenth again struck
him, this time: in the , face. The
officer, unable to control himself
then retaliated. At this Juncture,
a Japanese Marine sentry interven-
ed, placing his ■ rifle-- against the
sergeant’s body cross-wise and pre-
■ vented him from going further.
A repeat of. the 'affair was mode
to Hongkew Station and shortly
afterwards a Japanese naval officer,
who stood near by at. the .-time of
the assault, visited .the police, sta-
tion and apologised.

Vice-Admiral Nomura, Commander-
In-Chief of the Japanese Naval
Forces in Shanghai. The writers
allege that, In spite of all efforts,
they have been unable to learn the
whereabouts of Mr. Tsiang and ask
the Admiral to take steps to restore
him to them. The letter follows:
Dear Sir, —The Pitch Memorial
Church of Christ in China Is
.located in Darroch Road, Hong-
ke\V, It is one of the largest
churches in Shanghai, Among the
, membership of this church tare the
families of the founders and execu-
; tive heads of the Commercial. Press
which has, -as you are aware, been
■completely destroyed, -as well as
many other Chinese holding posi-
tions of high responsibility.
On the afternoon of January 29.
there was assembled a group of 30
In the manse adjoining the church.
They Were mostly woman and
children. They were there because
they thought it was a safe place
for refuge. While squads of His
Imperial Majesty's marines were
engaged in rifle and machine gun
firing in front of the church and
the neighbourhood, they sought
comfort and peace of heart in
prayer.
About four o’clock -in the after-
noon, a marine patrol, numbering
about. 50. rattled the iron gates ot
the front of the, church courtyard
demanding admission. Naturally,
there was immediately- much fear
among the small group, and a few
minutes elapsed before one of them
a young lad of 20, Whose father and
mother and younger sister were
also In the group , In the manse
mustered sufficient courage to un-
lock the iron ©ate. As soon as he
had opened the gate, without any
further' ado' he was seized and his
hands bound behind his book and 1
carried away;, he has not been seen
or, heard freon since.
Search for Bombs
Immediately upon entering the
manse, Where the small group l of 30
were, the officer in charge of the
squad- demanded ..to be told where
the teachers and -students of the

Alleged Acts of Japanese Marines: Open
Letter to Admiral Nomura
school conducted in the church ad-
joining were. He was informed
that the students -and teachers had
gone to .their homes, as the school
was a day school and closed for
the winter vacation. When asked
who was in charge of the property
our pastor, -the 'Rev. Tsing Z-zu,
immediately stepped forward and
stated, that he was the pastor and
therefore the person in charge.
The marine officer then insisted
that there were bombs hidden on
the property. Our pastor replied
that this was a church and that
he was quite sure there were no
bomba or any other military equip-
ment on the place; but he invited
the officer to make a search of the
premises so as .to assure himself
of this fact. All of .the 30 who had
come to the church for refuge and
prayer had their persons searched..
No bombs or weapons of any des-
cription were found either on the
property or on the persons of the
■ group.
Your officer then separated from
the rest of the group our pastor
and his wife-and son, his nephew
and his secretary and two servants,
comprising his entire , family, ex-
cepting his little daughter of nine,
who was playing in the kindergar-
ten adjoining, entirely unconscious
of the tragedy enacted in the
md-nse.
Pastor Marched Off
The remaining twenty-two were
then commanded to confine them-
selves to the manse and under no
circumstances wore to look out of
the window or attempt to leave the
property. Your marines then turn-
ed their attention to our pastor,
Mr. Tstang, beating him in the face
•and prodding him with the bayonet.
Then they turned toward his wife
and beat her. repeatedly over the
thighs with, the butt of their rifles
until she collapsed on’ the floor.
They then bound the hands of all
seven behind their backs and
marched them off.
Since .then all-efforts-on our part
and on the part of our western
friends, have failed to secure any
information from the Japanese
Consulate or through . any other
agency as to their whereabouts or
fate, though more than two weeks
have past., - .
Our pastor waa a man who was
rich in love and compassion. Al-
most the last sermon that he preach


ed was an appeal to us to for-
give the injustices of your country,
not to hate, but to forgive and to
love as Christ taught us and show-
ed us to forgive and love,
An Appeal
With our chinch members widely
scattered, all in need of comfort’
and spiritual guidance and help,
wo greatly long for the wise
guidance and the spiritual help of
our Pastor. Surely a man like our
pastor, Mr. Tslang, whose’heart
bore no hatred but only love, and
who besought others to forgive and
practise love, has done nothing, or
his family, to be carried off as
prisoners.
The hearts of the men and wo-
men of our Church who all loved
him, cry out in sorrow and bereave-
ment; and so we, who are the
governing body of the chinch, can-
not refrain from writing this letter
to you 'bo ask you to restore to us
and to our church our pastor and
his family. . For this act of mercy
and compassion, we will be al-
ways very grateful.

Yesterday a number of unwar-
ranted actions were reported oy
riengkew residents as having been
i perpetrated either by Japanese
Marines or “ronins,” In one case,
a British house was entered by uni-
formed marines. In another’, their

ran out of the back door, making
for a Japanese machine gun post
not far distant. He called on them
to stop, but, as he was confronted
by the lai'med men he did not follow
further. Instead he repeated the
matter, addmg at the ponce station,
that when ho last was in his house
on Thursday, he was still in posses-
sion of a loud speaker, valued at

leased.
Two Chinese women were .arrest-
ed during the morning by several
Japanese marine officers on Seward

Mr, G. H. Parkes, formerly boxing
instructor at the Public School for
Boys, was severely manhandled
yesterday at noon by a gang of
some 59 Japanese reservists at the
corner of North 'Szechuan and Dix-.
well Roads.
Mr. Parkes, who is a British sub-
ject, had driven his car’ to this spot,
which is only a stone’s throw away
from the Dixwell Road . Police
Station, when he was held up. He
exhibited two passes which bad been

Municipal Police, one being his cur-
tew pass and the other an 'emer-
gency pasts, 'bearing the seal of
Rear-Admiral Bhiosawa, to enter
and leave the Settlement dining a
state ol emergency, but these were
snatched from his hand and torn up.
Two foreign police sergeants were
standing, near by at the time but
they were unable to render any
assistance.
When Mr. Parkes remonstrated
against the destruction of .his
passes, he was assaulted and his
car . detained. Nevertheless, he.
decided ithab resistance was useless
so eventually he made his way to
the Japanese Naval Headquarters
. and obtained assistance from a naval
officer who provided him with an
escort and issued an order for the
release of the car, the latter being
returned.
The "North-China Dally, News”
understands that the matter is being
referred to H, M. Consul-General
for action.,
(N.CfD.N. February IS, 1932)
previously, 30 Japanese marines
had entered his shop and caused
considerable damage. A similar oc-
currence took place at 9.40 a.m.,
soon after which a shopkeeper in-
formed the police that "rondna”
had removed a quantity of coal
and wood: from his premises. The
fuel.was valued at $60. The police
are in possession of tire lorry

A foreigner challenged a Japan-
ese "renin" with ithe theft.of several
beds from his house which had
been shelled. It was. resented hotly

Eye - W itness Stories Of War
Pass From Shanghai Horizon
JThere will be no more eye-witness
stories concerning Japanese army
actions In the front line, if Japan-
ese authorities can help It.
Piom Saturday morn of last week
until yesterday, all was well on the
Klangwan front for tire numerous
newspaper reporters and foreign
. correspondents whose duty it was
to “cover” the war. With passes,
and in, some cases without, the re-
porters and photographers rummag-
ed through the Japanese lines, often
right into the zone of actual hostili-
ties.
Guards or sentries there were
none to check the news hunters
and :they wandered far afield,
getting close-up,shots of the strife
and methods employed.
All Went Well Until—
Then someone spilled the beans.
Charges of atrocities flew, hut
were given little credence.
Then came a single eye-witness
account of ruthless slaughter, on.
the green grass of Klangwan Race
Course, —and the . bars were pur
, up.
Prom the Japanese Consulate-
Qeneral on ■ Tuesday afternoon
there was forthcoming a dis-
claimer. It is inconceivable, it was
pointed out, that any. Chinese
.civilians, could have .remained in
the. Klangwan zone, on Monday,
Consul General K. Mural urging
tho evacuation of all . non-combat-
ants from the zone of hostilities,
“Last Map Evacuated”
m the same statement is the al-
legation that the only Chinese
civilian seen in the Klangwan area
on Monday had been evacuated by
a. foreign newspaper correspondent,
His name was withheld, 1* was ex-
plained at the consulate, to avoid
causing the gentleman embarrass-
ment. Ho had brought into the
Settlement and turned the lone
civilian over to the Municipal
Police, safe, alive and well. .
There was no direct refutation
attempted in regard to the specific
charges of slaughter of- civilians,
whether guerillas or. not. Nor was
information forthcoming as to what
procedure, customary to organised
armies had been followed in the
-arrest, trial and • punishment, of
suspected soldiers, civilians, spies or
snipers. .
Passes Into Limbo Of Post
Reaction No, 3 came with an-
nouncement by the Japanese Con-
sulate General that all military
passes or courtesy slips, some oi
which had been issued a matter oi
hours before, no longer were valid
and had been suspended until fur-
ther notice. The announcement-
explained that owing to the “danger
and confusion” it was necessary to
suspend the privileges theretofore
enjoyed by member’s of the Fourth
reach the Japanese military head-
Estate.
The move made it impossible to
quarters at Tienlohsze, where, it was
customary for Major Miyawaki, in-
telligence officer’ on the staff of
Lieutenant General K. Uyeda, to
issue communiques on the latest
developments to the Klangwan
sector. Likewise it has become im-
possible for foreign newspaper men,
other than Japanese press re-
prosentatives, to proceed to the
ironit lines.
Tho freedom enjoyed previously
by tho Japanese war correspon-
dents, however, also has been re-
stricted to some extent and they
are required to gather in a tent set
aside for them at headquarters lo
await the appearance of the officials
appointed to broadcast what news
is .released.
Explanation Offered
Japanese diplomatic officials ex-
plain that there' Is no 'Connection
with the two developments,—the
publication of eye-witness atrocity
stories and the voiding of the con-
sular passes to the war zone. They
state that hereafter news of war
developments will bo available at
toe offices of the Japanese Con-
sulate general, which has been
issuing .communiques daily for the
iOSt three weeks.
The communiques cover a variety
of subjects, . all of them link-
ed with the present Sino-Japanese
situation. A liaison officer has
been appointed, by the consulate
and military news,- relayed from
the Tienlohsze headquarters, will
■O6; forthcoming in due course,
Customary courteous consideration
of newspaper, deadlines will be ex-
tended, it was explained. |
Test Of Statements
Text of the Japanese announce-
ment suspending all passes, issued
Tuesday night, follows;
“Due to danger- and confusion,
the validity of the press passes or
courtesy slips to the Japanese
Army Headquarters and the front
lines issued by the Japanese Con-
sulate-General or Army Head-
quarters is suspended until further
notice.”
The Japanese statement issued in
regard to atrocities charged to the
Japanese Army reads:
“A rumor of alleged Japanese
atrocities on civilians at the
Kiangwau Race-Course has reached
this office, much to our surprise.
On February 20bh, Mi*. Mural sent
to Mayor Wu a Note, the special
purpose of which was to advise
him to take necessary precautions
for the safeguarding of the Chin-
ese public at large, causing them
either to take refuge in a safer
zone or by some other appropriate
means.
“After the exchange of fire in
and around the Klangwan Race
Course of two days, it is incon-
ceivable that any civilian could
have been staying in that neigh-
borhood, especially in .the open,
where it Is alleged that the in-
cident took place,
“Ono foreign correspondent whose
identity, and standing are well
known to the office stales that he
brought back the only Chinese In
right from this same neighborhood,
to the Settlement, giving, him $5
and. handing him over to Deputy
Superintendent . Robertson of , -the
Shanghai Municipal Police.
Women As Snipers
“Therefore, if there should hap-
pen to be any others remaining in
the same neighborhood in any
number as has been stated by the
alleged accusation, they were no
other than those who were engaged
in sniping or otherwise in some
form .of military .activities.. It is
not surprising if there were some
women among the victims In view
of the fact., that some had .been
actually found sniping.
“In this connection, it may be
. added that although peaceful re-
sidents of Klangwanchen have
already evacuated, a great number
of. Chinese plain-clothes snipers,
most of whom are the regulars of
the Chinese army, arc still en-
trenched in some of the study
buildings of the village and are
offering a violent resistance, caus-
ing considerable casualties to.
Japanese forces.”

Called In Consultation
. Cass No. 2—On February. 12,
1932 I was called in consultation
by the department of the sur- .
gery of this hospital to see Mrs.
, Nlen who had been wounded by,
a rifle shot Feb. 13, 1932. I saw
a -small practically closed ■ en-
trance wound at the left poste-
r-lor chest. The exist wound


presented a defect of the size of
a man’s palm of the left upper
anterior chest wall. One rib was
seen apparently unbroken, the
one right below this showed a
defect of about two inches
through which the collapsed
lung could perfectly well be dls-‘
cemed. It is a well known fact
that rifle shots with the normal
small entrance wound and big
defects at the place of exist are
caused only by dum-dum bullet.
Apart from the possibility that .
dum-dum action is also found
in bullets deflected from their
course 'by first hitting a stone,
I herewith definitely state , that
the two above-mentioned instan-
ces are cases of dum-dum bullet
shots. ,
Sincerely yours,

MORE “ARRESTS”
IN HONGKEW
Chinese Civilians in
Custody
Additional "arrests’* and brutality
were alleged against the Japanese
marines in Hongkew yesterday. A
senior Municipal police described m
incident which he witnessed. After
searching a Chinese pedestrian on
Seward Road, a Japanese marine
brutally butted him with his rifle
and kicked him on his way, after
striking him with his fists.
At 11 am., a party of Japanese
marines searched three or four
houses on Miller Rood, without
awaiting the arrival of a police
party, whose assistance they had
requested. They suggested that
snipers were functioning on the
premises, but a thorough search by
the police failed to reveal any arms.
The marines escorted four of the
inmates to the headquarters, two of
whom were released during the
afternoon. At 2 pm., police offi-
cers witnessed marines "arrest” a
Chinese civilian on the Szechuan
Road Bridge. Several similar in-
cidents were reported as well.
Yesterday morning, two police
patrols were interfered with by Jap-
anese marines while they were
searching Chinese pedestrians, the
latter insisting that this was their
prerogative; Police officials' also had
difficulty In convincing Japanese
that one of their Chinese detectives
was a bona fide representative of
the Municipality.

MISSIONARIES’
APPEAL
Methods of Japanese
Criticised
The “North-China Sunday News”
has received a copy of a statement,
which has just been issued. Tills
statement was signed by 105 mis-
sionaries, British and American, re-
sident in Shanghai, and It was first
made public on February 12. It
reads: —
We, a group of Christian mis-
sionaries in Shanghai, deeply de-
plore the present position in which
Japanese direct military action is
inflicting unspeakable misery and ,
destruction In thousands of homes.
An unknown number of civilian
lives have already been lost. The
mode of this action ruddy assails
the new international standards of
morality so laboriously constructed
since the Great War. Attack upon
these is an attack upon every na-
tion and upon the foundations of
civilisation.
Advancing into purely Chinese
territory, a thickly populated city
area, at midnight on January 23,
with a few minutes' warning to
the Chinese Mayor and none to the
civilian population, the Japanese
armed forces, aided by aerial bomb-
ing and artillery, have wrought ruin ■
and destruction for twelve day® and
are still continuing. Houses and
property of innocent men, women
and children over a large area have
been razed to the ground and
burned. Public property and fac-
tories have been destroyed and tens
of thousands deprived of their live-
lihood. The great Commercial
Press, on which all educators de-
pend, was bombed and its library
with its priceless treasures has later
suffered destruction.
Privileged Position.
The privileged position of the
Japanese in the International set-
tlement is being abused as a base of
operations, putting Britain, Amer-
ica and other peoples interested in
the Municipal Council of the Inter-
national Settlement in a false and
embarrassing position. In the area
under Japanese control, even with-
in the Settlement, there has been a
reign of terror in which hundreds
of innocent people, many of whom
, we know personally, have been ar-
rested, maltreated or summarily
shot on suspicion without trial. All
this has taken, place in time of
i peace against a people with whom
. Japan had not even broken off
i diplomatic relations, still less de-
-1 dared war, a people who, had sub-
! mltted the dispute to the League of
i Nations.
■ Even now further armed forces
are being brought to the scene of
conflict. We appeal to all Ohris-
tlans and to the conscience of the
world to condemn this madness and
cruelty of war and urge our own
and, every peace loving nation, in-
cluding (the friendly Japanese peo-
ple themselves, to insist that their
government dissociate themselves
from the action of the Japanese
armed l forces, take every possible
measure calculated to end fighting
and make use of available Instru-
ments for a peaceful settlement.

Gruesome Sights
Mark Race Track
Corpses Sweeten Ground
Where Children Once
Romped At Play
By T. O. %
I visited Kiangwan Race Course
today. I shah never be able to re-
turn without'a shudder. My pre-
vious visits were to see 'the crowds
of happy Shanghailanders on a
Race Day outing, betting on their
favorite horses; gmtlemen-jockeys
coursing under a brilliant sun.
This morning is just such ft day
overhead; but underneath,— nothing
but horror.
The entrances to my favorite
stand are blocked- with corpses,
fresh corpses, newly made before
my eyes.
Women Shot In Back
perhaps, as the official military
communiques from Japanese head-
quarters say, these corpses once had
been snipers, or even perhaps spies,
X make no challenge, I just detail
what I see.
There are women and Children
among them; women shot through
the bock, their padded coats run
through with military sabres; chil-
dren whose bodies are riddled with
bullets; men garbed as peasant
fanners heaped grotesquely about,
their wounds soaking the ground.
They are not garbed as soldiers--- ;
not even the women and the chil-
dren—so I suppose they must have
been snipers—officially. I suppose
so because my very dear friends at
headquarters and the Japanese
legation assure me—are at pains to
point out to me—that the Japanese
army and navy are not making war
on civilians, nor upon Chinese
peasants—or upon the Chinese gov-
ernment, nor upon Government
troops—but merely the 19th Route
Army from Canton.
Bodies Strewn On Playground
So I suppose that these , people
who seemed so innocent to the
J casual eye must have been machine
gunners and rifle-men from the


19th Routs- Army,' disguised as
simple peasants.
; It is difficult to, ask them now.
The houses-, are burned; I saw
them burned, with neat precision:
not. a wasted match, nor an extra
piece of kindling. .
■ And they? Their corpses sweeten
the ground beneath the judges
stand;, oh© whose body was soaked
in oil anl now lies charred beneath
th-e officials' tower will till no crops
again; they lie in little heaps along
the grass before the stands, whore,
on that Race Day recently, the
children played and chased elusive
butterflies.
“Tragedy Of Peace”
And as I walk - the top rail,
scuffling through the glass which
crashed from rifle-butt attacks
u-pon the office tier, a tragedy of
Peace—for remember tills is not a
war—unfolds beneath my eyes.
An Infantry' company, just pre-
paring for its duty in the hand-to-
hand fighting on. ahead In Kiang-
w-anchen, pauses to watch, the
drama with me; I above and they
below. The flames from burning
fa-rmhuts throw a curtain of red
behind new captive groups of those
who. fled the fire.
An . officer turns one of the pea-
sant-garbed group away, to face the
sun. His shining sabre flashes, up
to its hilt in the human sheath;
the .body falls;, a second takes its
place, and once again the sabre
finds its pulsing scabbard.
"Death By Proxy”
And now, a diversion; the next, a
tall and likely lad, is- flung unbound
face down, upon th© two who clutch
the panting earth in death; and as
he falls, a volley from six officers'
revolvers makes a minor outline on
his back and courses up his spine.
The volley dies, .the pistols now are
empty, the jerking flgiu-e on the
ground now •is still and another
takes his turn. X-leave, for fear is
on- me now; the- sunshine gone; my
feet are lead.
. The company of infantry is tast-
ing death by proxy; and it is ready
for the front.-

Motor cars used no lights north
of Kiangwan last night, but there
was light enough and to spare.
While tanks, staff cars, motor-
cycles, cavalry and infantry, milled
along the spongy roads, the homes
of peasants burst into flame on© by
one. Thby furnished-tragic beacons
lighting the background of combat.
For days there had been fires in
•and about Kiangwan, but it was not
until last night that efforts became
organized with the apparent, aim of
burning every structure in or about,
the Japanese line. of attack.
Fires Dot Countryside
From Japanese headquarters,, at
a temple perhaps a mile north of
Kiangwan race course, fires specked
the countryside everywhere to the
east, north and south. They flam-
ed along the 1 road; skirmishers
brought -brush, piled it against the
windward side of each dwelling, and
the lazy early-spring breeze soon
fanned it high.
“A. necessary precaution,” ex-
plained headquarters. Snipers had
been In some of these buildings and
they might be in some others or
they might'get in. some time,.in
future; burning them was a simple
military safeguard, it; developed.
Parachute Flares
There were few country folk to
watch, and none to interfere. That
was a thing of th© -past.. The pea-
sants had not abandoned their
homes and poor treasures without
a. gesture, but -there were no ges-
tures last night.
Overhead wore Japanese .airplanes,
passing to - and fro cn mysterious
affairs. Occasionally, as dusk des-
cended a parachute, bearing a flare
would .be detached high in air. At
other times the passage of a plane
unknown. Another case concerns a
father and son,, both of. whom were
removed from the roads. . •
In one instance a Japanese con-
stable searched a Chinese and then
handed him over t© a Marine patrol.
A foreign police officer was appeal-
by a Chinese who was being
searched by a. marine,, the latter
appearing. it© have pocketted some
papers. The foreigner protested
and a Japanese constable informed
the former that he would report -his
(tiie foreigner’s), action to the
military authorities.

over the Chinese lines would be

air bomb.
Over near the former Japanese
headquarters at Pub Tan University
near Kiangwan , there were severed
■large guns, moved up during the.
day. One would, hear first the
bang of the gun, then. the whistle
of the shell overhead. Apparently
the parachute flares aided in cor-
recting the ranges.
Constant Elfl© Fire
But smaller pellets were flying
closer <ak hand. The rat-tat-tab of
machine guns, the, crackling, of rifle
fire, was, constant.. Occasionally a
nearer, bang and .the rising of a
cloud of black smoke would show
where a shell 1 from some polnt'un-
known had landed.
Within the temple headquarters
there were Japanese officers, re-
served but affable buttoned warm-
ly into their military greatcoats
and strolling about as though in a
pleasure park.
General Uyeda sat back within
tire building having his dinner. Be-
hind one shoulder could be seen one
character of a carved temple in-
scription—the character “p’iag," or
"peace.” '
The grounds outside were full of
equipment and covered with the
recumbent bodies of Japanese In-
fantrymen, snatching a moment of
respite from tile burden of:their,
heavy packs. Occasionally on of-
ficer would gather his group toge-
ther 1 and they would start forward.
Sounded lake War
Back along the road there had
been ammunition and other- sup-
plies, sometimes only a matter erf
feat away from a burning farm-
house. Ahead of the temple, how-
ever, it was quiet. •

CS. E. P. Peb. 23, 1932)


If the Japanese Governments re-
ply to the appeal of the Council of
the League of Nations were taken
at its face value, the only possible
conclusion would be that Tokyo
had failed to grasp the essentials
of the problem created by the ac-
tion of Japanese naval, air and
military forces here. The alterna-
tive suggestion that Japan refuses
to take the League, of which she
is a member, seriously might
be in consonance with some aspects
of Japanese policy but it can hardly
be accepted in justice to Japan’s
international reputation. It was to
be expected that every effort would
be made to present Japanese ac-
tions in. the best possible light. It
was not expected that so much re-
liance would be placed on the
dubious qualities of special pleading
and frivolous misinterpretation.
Fundamentally the weakness of
Japan’s case lies in the fact that,
in deciding to take "drastic mea-
sures" —the quotation of the
language of her agent must be used
to rebut the specious pretence that
defensive action only was intended
—she had no clear-cut issue. Al-
legations of "boycotting, anti-Japan-
ese activities, the murder of the
Buddhist monks, and the rest, could
not stand alone . They had to be
considered in their relation to the
effect on Chinese opinion of Japan-
ese aggression in Manchuria and,
moreover, the adoption by the
Japanese in Shanghai of an ex-
ceedingly provocative attitude
which, for the three months pre-
ceding the outbreak had caused
considerable anxiety. The concen-
tration of Chinese troops within
close proximity of Shanghai was
directly due to the movement of
menacing ■Japanese naval forces
with declared hostile—or punitive-
intent to Chinese Shanghai. Punish-
ment for the boycott, for anti-
Japanese activities was the object
as first announced. Now it is |
claimed, with effrontery rather than
logic, that the defence of the Inter-
national settlement was the recipi-
ent of Japanese solicitude.
China may have been—indeed
was—a transgressor. Japan was
the aggressor, the mere chronolo-
gical evidence of the source of the
first shot being immaterial. The
world has come to learn the futility
of assigning “war guilt.” This
should make Japan all the more
diffident in replying to the League’s
dispassionate appeal with fustian
instead of sound argument. It
seems now painfully ironical, for
Japan to wax eloquent over China’s
breach of treaty engagements, or to
moralise on China’s lack of status
IN BLUNDERLANS
as an “organised state.” Japan, as
a Member of the League, made no
attempt to bring before the League
the grievances on account of which
she took summary action in Man-
churia last , September and in
Shanghai last month. To support
1 the contention that the League was
a useless bulwark it surely was
first necessary to put the League to
: the test. Instead of that, Japan
; hamstrung the League and then
complained that it was incapable,
of bearing her. It has been wise-1
ly stated that, where breaches of!
treaty engagements are concerned, |
the precipitate movement of troops!
is the ultimate folly. Beside China’s
I broken pledges there now stand
Japan’s engagements under the
Covenant, the Kellogg Fact and the
Nine Power Treaty—and the ruins
of Chapel. Confronting the in-
tangible, shadowy, disorganised
Government of China is a Govern-
ment of Japan, completely at the ■
mercy of the very militarism with 1
which China is reproached.
Japan’s reply to the League
makes much capital of Chinese mis-
deeds and aggressiveness. They call
for correction. The question arises!
whether the process of correction |
should be undertaken with complete ;
disregard for other interests equal-'
ly—perhaps more extensively-
affected. It may also be asked
whether correction should take the
form of reprisals and whether
Japan, either by the actual perfor-
mance of the, last four weeks or by
her moral and material ascendancy,
was authorised to inflict it. Nor is
Javan’s insistence on Chinese un-
willingness to resort to peaceful
means of settlement impressive to
those who realise the extremely
provocative tone,, manner and pre-
sentation of the terms which Lieu-
tenant-General K. Uyeda laid down
last week. The Ingenuity of anti-
cipating Chinese methods of
evasion and shifting responsibility
is heavily discounted by constantly
accumulating evidence of the
technique of the agent provocateur
and the coincident occurrence of
events to fit certain lines of Japan-
ese action. The suggestion, In the
Japanese note, that the League
should have definitely proposed the
creation of a “safety zone” indicates
a pathetic blindness. As a "safety
zone" the whole Shanghai area at
the present moment looks a trifle
awry. Japan, indeed, seems to have
turned it into. a Blunderland, from
which it is to he hoped she will
soon be able to extricate herself
and others by the exercise of a
clearer perception of the realities so
Poison Gas
A Japanese military spokesman in
the Woosung sector indignantly de-
clared, a fortnight ago, that Japan
jhad no poison gas shells.
News from Europe Indicates that
.this omission is now being repaired
! through purchase of 2,000 such aids
;to pacification, along with 18,000
ihigh explosive shells, from the
1 Skoda Works of Czechoslovakia.
That international sentiment to-
I ward poison gas is not precisely
'hospitable would not seem an im-
portant detail from the Tokyo
viewpoint, since a great and in-
creasing hostility by the entire
world toward Japan's private war
on China has not as yet had no-
| tlceable effect on Japanese sensibili-
ties oi' policies.
. In fact, the whole attitude, of the
i Japanese military machine is such
that we would hardly commend such
I measures as are proposed by Miss
| Maude Royden and other British
, pacifists. .
i The Royden group wants to come

tion in "no man’s land" between

Quite a number of. innocent Chi-
nese civilians have tried that- The

| We would like to believe we lived
In a world where poison gas shells
weren’t bought, because they, seem
not quite sporting; where idealistic
third parties could halt a war by
getting into its line of .'march; but
, Japan has been giving us an educa-,
tion in hard realities.
The Japanese military machine
will quit grinding againsc China
when the home folk quit buying oil
, for It. Not sentiment, but financial
Toss and an inevitable realization of
defeat in the vital issues, will pro-,
vide the eventual check for Japan-
ese aggression.

blandly commended to the League’s
attention. There is little disposi-
tion in shanghai to overlook them;
they starkly glower in the complete
stagnation and possible ruin of the
trade of this great port; in the,
grave accentuation of political dan-
gers of the first magnitude and hi
