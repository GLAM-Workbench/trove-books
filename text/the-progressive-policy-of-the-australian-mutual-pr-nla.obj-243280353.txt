| NTRODUCTION,
At every Annual Meeting for the last five or six years the question as to
whether the expenses of conducting the business of the Society are excessive
or not, has been a subject for adverse criticism. Some members complain
that the total expenses are so much higher than they were in the early years
of the Society; others call attention to particular items of expenditure, and
consider them high, absolutely or relatively, as compared with former years;
at another time it is pointed out that the ratio of the expenses to the premium
income, for a particular year, exceeds that of some previous year; while
another favourite method of criticism is to contrast the ratio of this Society's
expenditure with that of some of the oldest Assurance Societies in England,
who transact only a small amount of new business as compared with that
effected by this Society. Then again it has been argued that the expenses
incurred in procuring new business are so much deducted from the profits
of the older members, that it is in fact a waste of the Society’s funds to
prosecute the business for which the Mutual Provident was founded. But
the climax of erroneous and unwarrantable criticism was reached when, at
the last annual meeting it was boldly asserted “ that it was an axiom laid
down by all actuaries, that anything in the shape of expenses over 10 per
cent, was unsafe.”
The Chairman has explained from time to time that the ratio of the
expenditure on the annual premium income has been gradually decreasing
for years past; that as a matter of fact the cost of management is unusually
low, being on the average nearly 10 per cent, less than is incurred by offices
of the same age of good standing in England, and less even than what is
spent by offices established for 50 years and upwards. It has also been
repeatedly explained from the chair that much of the expenditure is incurred
in procuring new business, but that it is for the good of the Society, and to
the interest of the members, that such expenditure should be incurred.
Notwithstanding these explanations, given year after year, the subject is
re-discussed, and observations made by members damaging to the Society.


The critics,although no doubt well intentioned,are frequently either ill-informed
on the subject, or do not understand the different aspects under which
it should be viewed, and their remarks are therefore calculated to mislead
the members as to the true policy of the Directors in the management of
the Society. An absolute decrease in the expenses of a society that is not
retrograding is neither looked for nor expected; but a relative decrease in
the ratio of expenditure on the premium income is taken to be a sine qua
non of good management, whereas it will not be difficult to shew that a
mutual life assurance society may be more profitably worked for the majority
of its members, even although the ratio of the expenditure to premium income
has, for a given period, increased instead of decreased. That is to say, if
the interests of the old and new members, as regards the expenditure
incurred in acquiring the new business, have been fairly consulted in
dividing the realised profit. Thus it will be seen that the expenses attend-
ing the management of an assurance society have to be looked at from more
points than one, even when the discussion is confined to a particular office.
But the question becomes more complex and misleading to members and
the public, when comparisons are instituted between the relative expendi-
ture of this and other societies, for, as I shall presently shew, a variety of
circumstances have to be looked at, and made allowance for, before much
value can be attached to any such comparisons. The economical manage-
ment of the Society is no doubt a matter of much importance and interest
to the members as a body, and it therefore seems to me desirable that they
should be in possession of the real facts, both as regards the Society itself,
viewed in the light of its own past history, and also when placed side by
side with existing kindred institutions. When the published accounts of the
Society shew a gradual and almost invariable decrease in the percentage of
expenses on premium income since its establishment, the most competent
of critics will not dispute that the influx of new members has not prejudiced
the interests of the older members; nor the most captious of critics deny
that the Society has been benefited by the large amount of new business
transacted. But indisputable as are these facts, and although it can be clearly
shewn that the position the Society holds is all that can be desired when
contrasted with assurance societies of the highest standing in Europe and
America, still another problem, personal to the members, has to be solved,
and it is this—Have the members generally been benefited by the large
amount of new business which the Society has transacted during the last
9 years, and have the expenses incurred in acquiring that business con-


served their interests, and been a pecuniary advantage to them 1 Or has
the increase of business merely resulted in augmenting the number ol
participants to share in a larger surplus, without rateably increasing the
share of profit to those who participated previously to the admission of the
new members? The case may be restated thus: —Is the contention of
those who disapprove of expenditure to increase the number of members
valid, on the ground that if the required outlay had not been incurred, their
share of the profits would have been greater ? And is there any foundation
for asserting or assuming that the progressive policy of the Directors, in
regard to new business, is leading the Society into a wrong position ; that
by energetically prosecuting the business for which the Society was founded,
they have been pursuing, as it has been termed, an ignis fatuus ? It seems
to me that the time has come when the several questions relating to the
expense of management ought to be officially answered, and particularly
this one:—Does a large new business pay at the price it has been procured
during the period under review? For if that cannot be answered in the
affirmative, then it would be true that the expenses incurred in acquiring a
large new business have been prejudicial to the interests of the members.
But on the other hand, if the profit has increased concurrently, and in a
ratio that has benefited and not injured the members, then the expenditure
has been judiciously laid out, and the policy pursued by the board the best
possible for the Society. The management of the Mutual Provident during the
past 9 years* may well be characterised as aggressive, and in a pre-eminent
degree as progressive; certainly no assurance society in England can com-
pare with it, and few offices in America surpass the results that have
been accomplished. Comparing the position of the Society at 28th February,
1869 (the end of the fourth quinquennium) with the results exhibited in the
last, the 29th annual report, it will be seen that the number of policies was
increased by 243 per cent., the amount assured by 196 per cent., the in-
come from premiums by 192 per cent., the income from interest by 257
per cent., and the realised assets by no less than 283 per cent. But if we
could only point to the amount of new business transacted as the measure
of success during the last 9 years, and could not prove that the members
have been, and will in the future be still further, benefited by the large new
business which has been transacted, its progress instead of being gratifying
would be mortifying, inasmuch as it would betoken unsuccessful manage-

ment. It will be in the recollection of members of the present board that
some years ago the subject of new business expenses, in all its bearings, was
reported on, and the question considered both as it affected the profits of
the Society and the interests of the members generally. The outcome of
the inquiry, embracing as it did both the system and the cost of acquiring
new business, as also the charge for collecting renewal premiums, was that
certain limits were then fixed, beyond which the board decided they would
not go, even although they had to see their new business decline. The
annual reports for the 9 years, which I am specially concerned in reviewing
(being the period during which I have been Actuary to the Society) have
disclosed a rapidly increasing premium revenue, and a variable but steadily
decreasing ratio of expenditure. The members doubtless have not failed
to see the beneficial effect of a large business, so far as it affects the Society
as a business, money making corporation, but it is not so evident, from the
published accounts, that what may be called the extension policy has been
for the good of the greater number of individual members. Believing that
the question considered from different points of view requires explanation,
I propose to treat the subject under the following heads :
(1.) How much do the assured contribute for expenses of manage-
ment ?
(2.) What have been the actuarial expressions of opinion on minimum
and maximum rates of expenditure ?
(3.) Comparative expenditure between different societies—what are
the causes that operate to its increase or decrease ?
(4.) Are the expenses of the Mutual Provident high or low as com-
pared with assurance institutions in England, America, and Australia ?
(5.) Has the ratio of expenses to the premium income exhibited a
continuously increasing or decreasing tendency ?
(6.) Are the expenses incurred in acquiring new business excessive, or
calculated to diminish the profits of the Society ?
(7.) Would it be to the advantage of the members who have already
participated in the profits, if the Society transacted a less amount of new
business annually, /.<?., admitted fewer members to share the profits ?
Before entering on these topics, which relate exclusively to this Society
it will not be considered unfitting to express my regret that the reported
proceedings of the last annual meeting should have been the medium for


promulgating so groundless an assertion as, that all life assurance companies
were unsafe which expended more than 10 per cent, of their premium
income in expenses of management. There is no foundation whatever for
such a statement, and I can safely say that no actuary ever expressed
such an opinion. The assertion has not even the semblance of truth, as I
shall presently shew. A grave responsibility rests upon those who give
utterance to reckless statements in defiance of well known facts; for although
they have no weight with intelligent and reflecting persons, they tend to
weaken the confidence of the public in life assurance institutions generally.
Therefore it is on that account that I propose to devote some space to shew
that it is not, and never was, “an axiom laid down by actuaries that any-
thing in the shape of expenses over 10 per cent, is unsafe for assurance
companies to expend in expenses of management.” Although the
facts to be communicated may not deter inconsiderate members here-
after from speaking disparagingly of the Society, I hope it may have the
effect of rendering it inexcusable for any member to brand as unsafe life
assurance offices of the highest standing, and that quite irrespective of any
consideration of the possible after consequences to such members them-
selves. I enter on the consideration of this question of expenses with a
desire to make clear to those who have already largely participated in the
profits of the Society, that their future bonuses will not be diminished, but
be augmented in proportion as the business increases, and for the purpose
of placing reliable information at the command of the members, in the hope
that intelligent, fair, and candid criticism may in future characterise dis-
cussions on the subject.


CHAPTER I.
In commenting on the expenditure of life assurance offices with a
view to determine whether any given society has passed the limits of
safety, it is necessary to know the amount of loading that has been added
to the net premium for expenses, contingencies, and profit. No person
in the least acquainted with the subject would assert that an office
was unsafe in consequence of heavy expenses, unless he knew that
the percentage on the premium income exceeded the margin provided
for expenses. Before the public can even guess whether an office
has imperilled its position by excessive expenditure, they must first
know how much that office has got to spend, Let the premiums
charged by life assurance societies be what they may, the amount that has
been added to the net premium for expenses is at once apparent when
the prime cost of life assurance is exhibited according to a given table,
combined with a uniform rate of interest. By comparing the percentage
of the premium income that has been expended with the percentage
derived by the office from the loading on its gross premium, a fair opinion
can be formed as to the safety of an office—so far, at least, as solvency
depends bn expenses of management. The difference between the
premium charged and the net premium forms the fund from which the
expenses have to be paid, and if they do not exceed what has been
contributed for expenses the assurance office is safe, and will be in a
position to pay the sums assured as they mature, provided their rates of
premium have been deduced from a true table of mortality. When the
public know better what is the price of life assurance—what the net or
mathematical premium is for the risk incurred, and what margin is added
to that net premium for expenses and profits, then those who criticise the
management of life offices will have to be more guarded in their
expressions, and will perhaps hesitate before making foolish and ignorant
statements when those whose interests they are damaging can prove their
absurdity. If policy holders were to inquire what their bonuses are, so to
speak, made of—where the money comes from —they would find that
(speaking of offices generally) about * one half the amount added to the
net premium for expenses has been returned to them in the shape of
bonuses. The subjoined table will illustrate what has been explained
for a particular age. The premiums charged at age 35 by all the leading
English and Australian offices are given, also the loading that has been
added to the pure or net premium for expenses, on the assumption
that it has been calculated by the Institute of Actuaries’ Tables com-
bined with 4 per cent, interest. The percentage that the loading bears
to the premium charged in each office on that basis is also exhibited.
* As a matter of fact in this Society, far more than the entire loading has been returned to the
members as bonuses, but that is owing to the rate of interest realised on the funds so much exceeding the
rate assumed in the calculations.

The above list contains 71 English offices, those with a Premium
Revenue less than ,£30,000 being omitted. The N. Z. Government and
six Australian offices are also included.


From this it does not follow that the percentage quoted represents the
average loading which the offices receive, as it usually varies at all ages,
being highest at the young ages, and gradually decreasing with the
increasing age. As the average age at which people assure their lives,
may be taken at 35, the premiums charged by offices at that age may fairly
be taken as typical of the cost to the public of life assurance in the different
societies exhibited in the table. The net premium to secure ;£ioo,
payable at the death of a person aged 35, according to the Table described
is 19s. 5d., that is the net or mathematical premium, and therefore the
prime cost of the assurance. Whatever offices charge above that is added
for expenses, profit, and contingencies, and constitutes what is called the
loading or marginal addition. The percentage that the loading bears to the
gross premium ranges, it will be seen, from 41.2 per cent, in the office that
charges the highest rates to 16.2 per cent., which is the smallest addition
which any office makes at the age selected for comparison. This percentage
is the one which is invariably spoken of when the expenses of management
are referred to —as for instance, if the expenses of a Society, such as the
Mutual Provident are, 14.5 percent, on the annual premium income, and
the average loading on the premiums 28.7 per cent., then it follows that
14.2 per cent, of the premium, or about one-half the loading, being
unexpended is saved annually, and accumulates as surplus for subsequent
distribution as bonus. On the other hand, if the expenses of an office are
upwards of 28 per cent., and the ratio of the loading to the premiums is less
than the percentage expended, then in that case actuarial expedients are
not unfrequently resorted to for the purpose of concealing the deficiency.
It sometimes happens, however, that adventitious circumstances connected
with life assurance business are sufficient to liquidate the deficiency that
would inevitably follow from the expenditure exceeding the loading con-
tributed. The difference between the real and office age in valuing the
liabilities, suspended mortality, and other incidental sources of profit that
cannot be called permanent, often create a real surplus where a deficiency
might have been expected to arise.

Note. —On the occasion of the investigation preceding that brought under review in the foregoing
table, the expenses of the Legal and General, included above, exceeded 10 per cent, while those of the
Scottish Equitable and the Eagle, not included above, were below 10 per cent. In fact, there are several
companies whose ratio of expenditure fluctuates above and below the 10 per cent, standard, but the above
exhibits the ratio at the date of the last investigation.
CHAPTER 11.
It is a well-known fact that the expenses attending the management
of Life Assurance Societies transacting an ordinary amount of new business
are not less than 10 per cent, of their premium income. A few old estab-
lished companies whose premium revenue has been decreasing for years
past are conducted for less than 10 per cent, and the same may be said of
some other offices whose premium income has, for several years, been almost
stationary, or whose rate of increase has been comparatively small. There
are twelve life offices in England, of which it can be said that their expenses
are less than 10 per cent, but their average annual premium increment
during the last five years has not exceeded B’i per cent As against that
rate of progress the premium income of the Australian Mutual Provident
Society shows an increase of 85 per cent, for the like period of 5 years.
The position in point of vitality held by this Society and that of those
offices which have been held up as models for imitation in virtue of their
economical management will appear from the following table:—

From these results it will be seen, that taking them on the average, the
period that has elapsed since they were established is 59 years; the average
amount of existing assurances, including bonus additions, is ;
their average annual premium income is ; and their expenses on
that income amount to 7'3 per cent. Repeating these figures in a tabular

The recuperative power of these offices in that which is essential to the
permanent existence of a life office it will be admitted is weak. For taking
the twelve offices in the aggregate, it will be seen that the new business
reported last vear onlv exceeds that of one year transacted 5 years ago
That it is far from being an unmixed good for Life Offices to be con-
ducted at a minimum rate of expenditure, may be further illustrated by
exhibiting the position of the same twelve offices having regard to the
amount of new business they transact annually. It is true of some of these
offices that they transact a fair amount of new business annually, but in a
decreasing ratio as compared with former years in their history. When the
new policies issued are not sufficient to replace those discontinued by
forfeiture, surrender, and death, then offices in that condition are not to be
congratulated on their economical management, even although their
expenses are less than 10 per cent., for their parsimony may outwit their
frugality. How the 10 per cent, offices stand as regards new business
appears from the following table: —
The recuperative power of these offices in that which is essential to the
permanent existence of a life office it will be admitted is weak. For taking
the twelve offices in the aggregate, it will be seen that the new business
reported last year only exceeds that of one year transacted 5 years ago
by 1 2' 1 per cent., while if the new business of the Mutual Provident for the
year 1877 be compared with that transacted in 1872, it will be found that
the increase amounts to no less than 127 per cent. The question I have
been considering is not how economically an assurance society can be
managed, nor whether those offices whose expenses are less than 10 per
cent, are more advantageous for the public to assure with than offices
whose expenditure exceeds that ratio, but to shew that it is only those
offices that are retrograding, at a stand still, or making comparatively little
progress, that are conducted for less than 10 per cent.


Having shewn that in England there are not more than 12 life offices
of which it can be said that their expenses are less than 10 per cent, on
their premium income, I shall now quote the opinions that have been
expressed by actuaries on the subject in refutation of the untrue but
dogmatically expressed statement that “it is an axiom laid down by all
actuaries that anything in the shape of expenses over 10 per cent, is unsafe.'’
The truth is actuaries have been very chary about expressing any opinion
as to what should be characterised as the limit of economical expenditure,
for no rule can be laid down of general application. Writing on this subject
De Morgan (in his Essay on Probabilities, p. 263) observes that “the
expenses of carrying on an insurance office, though they vary somewhat with
the amount of business, yet do not by any means increase so fast. In the
first year of its existence it would not be surprising if all the premiums paid
were swallowed up by house rent, salaries, &c., while in process of time
increase of business might reduce such expenditure to 2 per cent, upon the
yearly premiums.” That statement may be very true, but what might be,
never has been accomplished. For although the Equitable Insurance Society
has been transacting business for 116 years, and the London Life Associa-
tion for 72 years, the expenditure of these, the two oldest mutual life
offices, is not less than per cent., and it will be subsequently shewn that
when compared with offices charging low premiums their expenses are, in
point of fact, not less than 6| per cent. The evidence which Mr. C.
Ansell, F.R.S., and Actuary to the Atlas and National Provident Institu-
tions, gave before the select committee on assurance associations in 1853
is instructive, inasmuch as it affords the means of proving that the cost of
conducting life assurance offices, which expend very little in extending their
business, has increased during the last 2 5 years. The increase appears to
be owing to the general rise that has taken place in prices of late years, and
not to the special expenses usually incurred for obtaining new business.
Mr. Ansell gave a list of 17 offices established between the years 1806 and
1836, and said “ They have been good enough to communicate to me the
average rate at which their institutions were conducted in each case during
the first 5 years of their histories, and I find that the aggregate of the
premiums of those institutions during the first 5 years was
The aggregate of their expenses during these 5 years was being a
rate per cent, on the total premiums received during their first 5 years of 137
or nearly ; then pursuing this inquiry to see how far the expenses could
ultimately be reduced, I perceive that although many of the offices were
established so recently as 1834-5 and 6, their expenses have now fallen on
an average to about 8 per cent.” I have myself carried the same inquiry
down to the present day, and find that according to the last Valuation
Returns, published by these offices *, their premium revenues and expenses
were as exhibited in the following table :

From this table it will be seen that the premiums they received amounted to
£2,485,875, and the expenses to ,£230,754, being at the rate of 9.3 per
cent. Twenty-five years have elapsed since Mr. Ansell gave his evidence, and
although these offices have a very much larger premium income
than they
then had, their expenses on the average have increased ii per cent. Six
of the number are conducted for less than
10 per cent, but the expenditure
of the other ten is above that rate, and the percentage ranges from 4.7 to
14.3. The amount by which the premium income has increased or

The beginning and end of a period of five years forms the basis of com-
parison, and the increase overhead, it will be observed, barely amounts to
£ per cent. In the case of 5 offices there is a marked decrease; 2 remain
almost stationary, and in 3 offices only is there an appreciable increase of
business. This, with the previous table relating to 12 offices, proves, I
think beyond question, that life assurance societies cannot be kept pro-
gressive with an expenditure of less than 10 per cent., although they may be
kept alive for a time on less. Further actuarial expressions of opinion
were delivered before the same Committee. The late Mr. Downes, then
actuary to the Economic Society, said “that from 10 to 12 per cent, of the
premium, with an office well established, would be sufficient; ” and Mr.
Ingall, late actuary of the Imperial office, also said “if the expenses of
management be more than one sixth of the amount of premiums (i6| per
cent.) for any length of time, the office could not be said to be doing
profitably.” Since the assurance controversy of 1852, which culminated in
a select committee of the House of Commons being appointed to inquire
into the subject of life assurance associations, little of a controversial nature
has been written about the expenses of life offices. The subject was again
revived in 1874, owing to the disaster that had overtaken the Albert and
European Insurance Companies, and the precarious condition of some others
whose expenditure for a long period had been so excessive as to engender
anxiety for their safety. Since that year the expenditure of life companies
has been much discussed by the profession, especially as it is affected by
the amount of new business transacted, and several papers have been read
before the Institute of Actuaries directly bearing on that question. It has
also been thoroughly ventilated in the assurance press, and notably in letters
addressed to the “Times” (London) in the autumn of 1874. These news-
paper correspondents again have been replied to by actuaries, who have
published brochures setting forth their respective views on life assurance
finance in its relation to new business and expenses. From these sources


then I shall now quote all the actuarial opinions that have been expressed
bearing on a limitation of expenses to a specific percentage of premium
income.
If, as we have seen, life offices cannot be conducted for much less than
10 per cent, whose business practically is stationary, what rate of expendi-
ture would be considered economical for going concerns—progressive
institutions ? Mr, Sprague, Manager of the Scottish Equitable Assurance
Society, would answer that question and say “17 per cent, of the total
premium income ”; for in a letter addressed to the Editor of the Insurance
Record, dated 16th October, 1874, he submits a table shewing that in
13 Scotch Insurance Companies the expenses are from 10 to i6| per cent,
on the total premium income. In a second letter to the same paper, dated
6th November, he writes as follows : —“ Going back now to the practical
question of the expenditure of companies, I claim to have proved in my
last letter that companies which, when their expenses are compared only
with the total premium income, appear to be spending from 10 to 15 per
cent, of the premiums, are really spending, when the matter is looked at
more strictly, 50 per cent, of the new premiums. In my last letter I gave
a table shewing the expenditure of a class of offices which may be said on
the whole to be economically managed. It will be useful for the purpose
of further illustration of my argument,* to give another table shewing the
expenditure of some offices which are not so economically managed. It
has been somewhat difficult to know where to draw the line for this purpose,
but I believe that it may be very fairly drawn at an expenditure of 17 per
cent, of the premium income. The appended table gives, with regard to
19 companies whose expenditure exceeds that limit, corresponding figures
to those contained in my last letter.” The expenditure of the 19 offices
referred to ranges from 17 to 63 per cent, of the premium income, but
some having the highest expenditure transact Industrial business. What
Mr. Sprague’s views are as to the limit of safety in regard to expenditure,
will be gathered from a letter addressed by him to the Editor of the “ Times,”
dated 16th November, 1874, in which he says, referring to an examination
of the accounts of 120 companies returned to the Board of Trade, “of the
companies already mentioned the expenditure of 7 2 is under 20 per cent,
of the premiums, or fairly within the limits of safety.” Mr. Bunyon,
Actuary to the Norwich Union Life Office, gave two rules to guide intend-
ing assurers in the selection of an office, which have been much animadverted
upon. They were these: —(i.)Has your office got a million of money?
(2.) Are its expenses more than one tenth of its income ? lam only con-
cerned with the rule referring to expenses, and it is to be noted that Mr.
Bunyon referred to the total income, and this he took pains to explain,
observingt “that whatever rate of expenses can be agreed upon as
allowable it should be one running over the whole income, and not over a
portion such as the premiums alone.” That is a percentage which gives
* Mr. Sprague’s argument is that although the expenditure for new business has had the effect of
increasing the total ratio of expenses to the premiums, it has not had the effect of increasing the ratio of
expenditure against the old premiums. That therefore the expenses of life assurance companies should be
divided between the new business and the renewals before any conclusion can be drawn as to the real
economy of management.
t Letter to the “Times” dated 21st Nov., 1874.


very different results from one on the premium income only, and is much
more favorable to offices long established, on account of their having a large
revenue from interest on their accumulated fund; but it is not a method
usually adopted to measure the relative expenses of life offices. For
instance the premium revenue of the Scottish Widows’ Fund is .£496,304,
and the ratio of the expenses to that income is 12 per cent,, but if the
revenue from interest amounting to .£235,058 be included the ratio is
reduced to 8 per cent.* The last and in fact only other opinion I quote on
actuarial authority, bearing on what has been characterised as economical
expenditure, is that by Mr. A. Day, F.I.A. of the Scottish Widows’ Fund.t
“ His opinion on a general review of the whole question was that any com-
mission paying office that could do its business at 10 per cent, upon the
premium income was a very successful office.” So far then as actuarial
opinion has been expressed it will be seen that economical management
varies from 10 to 17 per cent, of the premium income. But between those
limits the amount of new business transacted determines which office is most
economically conducted. The effect that new business has upon the ratio of
expenses to premium income is a question that will be subsequently
considered.
I pass now from the consideration of economical expenditure to a rate
that involves the whole of the loading that has been added to the net pre-
mium. Offices that have entirely expended their margin in expenses have,
strictly speaking, spent all that they have got to spend, and have nothing left
from that source for profit to their members. Mr. Bailey, Actuary to the
London Assurance Corporation, says J “ The simple fact is that the premium
charged is always more than sufficient for the risk; the expenses have to be
paid out of the surplus, if anything then remains it is profit. If the expenses
exceed the surplus, the sums assured cannot be paid and the company will
fail; this I have no hesitation in saying has been the sole cause why any life
assurance companies in this country have failed.” That the expenditure of an
office should, as a matter of prudence, be limited to the amount of the loading
on the premiums after preliminary expenses have been liquidated, is a state-
ment that would be accepted unreservedly by all actuaries. Up to this point
there might be said to be an agreement among them, but beyond it there is
not unanimity of opinion about the limit of expenditure if the question of
safety and solvency is at issue. Preliminary and business extension
expenses can very seldom be liquidated out of the loading on premiums
received by offices for some years after their establishment, and therefore
the expenditure such societies incur marks the fourth stage in this inquiry.
Although in order to procure business and establish a connection new offices
do, as a matter of fact, spend more than the loading on their premiums, it
would not be proper to characterise them as insolvent. When the time
comes to determine whether such societies have made a profit or loss on
* The arbitrary rule of Mr. Bunyon was incorrectly quoted in an article on life assurance in the
“ Economist” of Oct., 1874. It reads thus “ Are the expenses more than 10 per cent, of premiums,” instead
of as above quoted. The article also appeared in the “ Sydney Morning Herald ”of the 31st March, 1875,
and as it is periodically quoted by one of the Society’s pseudo-critics, it may be as well to state that although
the figures quoted are correct as regards some offices, the deductions from them are entirely fallacious in
their application to the circumstances of the Mutual Provident Society,
t Journal of the Institute of Actuaries, Vol. xix, p. 7.

and Wilson, Royal Exchange, 1875. '


their business, some actuaries contend that their affairs should be investigated
with special reference to the expenditure they have actually incurred, and
are prepared to condone an amount exceeding the loading provided a
business has been established out of which future profit may be realised.
Mr. Sprague holds very liberal views on this subject, and has propounded
a method of valuation which he thinks better adapted to the circumstances
of young societies than what is known as the net or pure premium method
of valuation. He and one or two other actuaries contend that as the
expd uses necessarily incurred in acquiring new business are heavier in the
first than in subsequent years, and greater than the assured contribute in
that year, therefore the net premium method of valuation is inapplicable to
the case of a company that has spent much more than the loading on the
premiums. A correspondingly heavier portion of the loading should, they
contend, be available to meet special or initial expenses, on the ground that
although the premium payable be a uniform quantity throughout life, the
net premium need not also be uniform. The question then simply resolves
itself into lowering the reserve for the liabilities, which means in other words
that offices which spend more than the loading do not hold 20s. in the jQ
in reserve as compared with offices making a net premium valuation accord-
ing to a given basis. How the lowering process can be accomplished, and
an expenditure of the whole of the first year’s premiums in acquiring new
business justified, will be explained in a subsequent chapter. Meanwhile
it will be sufficient to quote the following extract from one of Mr. Sprague’s
letters as indicating the practical outcome of his method. “I am not to
be understood as advocating or justifying an expenditure of the whole of
the new premiums for the purpose of obtaining new business, but I wish
distinctly to express my opinion that an expenditure limited to this amount
is perfectly safe.” An expenditure then of the whole of the first year’s
premiums for the purpose of acquiring new business, together with 7 or 8 per
cent, of the renewal premiums (for that is included) implies a lowering of the
reserve for the liabilities, and therefore that a certain portion of future profit
has been sacrificed in the expectation that it will be more than recouped
hereafter by profit realised from the new business which has been purchased
at an apparently high price. But high as that rate of expenditure is, it
does not involve the anticipation of future profit which may never be
realised, and we now come to consider the position of offices that incur
a still higher rate of expenditure. They are those which have to a
large extent anticipated their future profits, for not only have they expended
the whole of their first year’s premiums in expenses, but the whole of their
current loadings as well, and they constitute the fifth class in the ascending
scale of expenditure which has been traced. The life offices that are in the
position described discount the future, and the fund they draw upon to
make themselves solvent is the loadings and premiums they expect to
receive. To make this more clear let it be borne in mind that when an
office values the gross premiums the total worth in present value of the
whole future loading is ascertained, and if taken credit for, then there is
nothing left for future expenses of management. The expense fund is
swept away and credit is taken for all future profit besides. A consequence
of this method of valuation is that the value of the future premiums is for
some years after policies are effected greater than the value of the sums


assured ; every new policy can be made to appear as an asset instead of a
liability, and this constitutes what is technically called “negative policy
values”—nothing else, in fact, but fictitious assets, inasmuch as they may
disappear any day at the will of the policy-holder, there being no obligation
on his part to keep the policy in force. It is by adopting this method of
valuation that some offices bring out an apparently large but only nominal
surplus—in reality, it only conceals how small the real surplus is If,
however, negative policy values be excluded, and an adequate deduction
from the gross premiums be made for future expenses, this method of
valuation is adapted to the circumstances of the offices we are
considering, for if the expenditure of an office has been excessive to the
extent indicated, it will be brought to account when a valuation of its
affairs by this method has been disclosed. Although such offices have
anticipated their profits, still if they have excluded from their valuation
balance sheet negative policy values, and make a proper deduction from
the value of their gross premiums, and hold that sum in reserve to provide
for the future charges of management, then there are actuaries (and Mr.
Sprague is one of them) who would not say such companies are insolvent.
They may have gone to the utmost length an office can go with safety, and
be on the border land of insolvency; but so long as they have reserved
such a proportion of their premium income as will suffice to meet their
future expenses, even such offices are not to be spoken of as having
exceeded the limits of safety, for they have a chance of retrieving their
position with careful management. The question then that has to be deter-
mined is what deduction should be made from the value of the gross
premiums to provide for the future expenses of managing offices in such
a condition. No definite answer can be given to that question, for it is
entirely a matter of opinion among actuaries : some contending that the
entire loading should be reserved, and that future profits should not be
anticipated to any extent, while others sanction an encroachment to a
greater or less extent dependent on the exigencies of the office they repre-
sent, or whose affairs they investigate and report upon. Speaking generally,
there are actuaries of high standing who would certify to the solvency of an
office provided it could stand the following test; —
Let all negative policy values be excluded from the balance sheet,
and allow the expenses of an office to be diminished by the amount of the
new premiums, then ascertain what ratio the remainder of the expenses
bears to the renewal premium income. Whatever that percentage may be,
it ought to “ indicate the smallest deduction from the value of the gross
premiums that must be made, in order that the company may be able to
pay its claims and meet its expenses. * ” If the value ol the loading be
known, and also the amount that has been deducted from the gross
premiums, then it is at once apparent to what extent future profit has been
anticipated, for the difference between the amounts represents loading
discounted. From this it follows that the bonus producing power is
weakest in those offices that discount their future loading to the greatest
extent, that is, who make the smallest deduction from the value of their
gross premiums, and highest when a net or pure premium valuation has been

made, which means that there has been no anticipation of future profit
whatever. Lastly, when is a life insurance company insolvent? That
was discussed at length by Mr. Sprague and other actuaries in letters
addressed to the Insurance Record in the year 1874; but the correspond-
ence showed that it was even more difficult to get actuaries to agree among
themselves as to what constituted insolvency than it was to get unanimity
of opinion on the point of solvency. Some maintain that if a pure premium
valuation brought out a deficiency, insolvency would be proved, while the
conclusion arrived at by Mr. Sprague was that if the assets of an office did
not exceed its liabilities, estimated by the Carlisle 4 per cent, table, with a
less deduction than 10 per cent, from the value of the premiums receivable,
no further proof was required that such a company was insolvent. On the
other hand, that conclusion was dissented from by other actuaries, who
maintained that a less reserve would suffice, because an office reduced to
such a position would not longer have to pay commission, and that a solvent
company could be found to take over their business if the assets were
equal to the liabilities, plus per cent, of the value of the premiums
receivable. But the fact is, no general answer can be given on the subject,
nor need the inquiry be pursued, for so far as English companies are con-
cerned (unless an office be fraudulently conducted) the returns which they
are required to make to the Board of Trade render it, to say the least, very
difficult to continue transacting new business after being reduced to a point
so near insolvency as has been indicated. It will be of use to quote the
opinion which Mr. Sprague has expressed on this subject, because at the
last annual meeting he was quoted as an authority who insisted that assur-
ance offices were not safe who expended more than 10 per cent, of their
premium income in expenses of management. There is something
positively ludicrous in quoting his name in connection with such an idea.
The misguided member who so grossly misrepresented his opinions did
not understand the difference between an office reduced to the position of
having reserved only 10 per cent, of the value of the future gross
premiums and an office that only expended 10 per cent, of the yearly
premium income in expenses. The expression of opinion where the
10 per cent, comes in is as follows : —“ The general conclusion at which I
arrive then is that when the sums assured and the premiums receivable are
valued by the 4 per cent. Carlisle table, a company is certainly insolvent
when less than 10 per cent, is deducted from the value of the gross pre-
miums, and most probably insolvent unless more than 15 percent, has been
deducted, but I am not to be understood as saying that in all cases a deduc-
tion of 15 per cent, is enough to ensure solvency." It may be interesting
to the members to know that if the assets and liabilities of the society had
been ascertained at the last quinquennial investigation by the standard
mentioned by Mr. Sprague, namely, a Carlisle 4 per cent, valuation,
reserving for future expenses 15 per cent, of the value of the gross
Premiums, then the surplus would have been or
greater than it was ascertained to be according to the
basis of valuation adopted. That basis was the Institute of Actuaries
H M (s) table with H M net premiums; the practical effect of such a
valuation was that the Society reserved for its contingent liabilities
more than would have been required had the Carlisle 4 percent.


table been used. Further, if the Society had valued and taken credit for
the gross premiums, making a deduction therefrom of 15 per cent, for
future expenses, the surplus would have been further increased by
stated, of In other words we may say that had the Society
expended in management expenses more than it had done up
to 31st December, 1873, it would still have had the surplus of at
that date. But such additional surplus would, as has been explained,
have been obtained by anticipating future profit and lowering the
reserve for the liabilities. It will, we think, be difficult for the member
who warned the directors at the last annual meeting that if they did not
mind “the seeds of dissolution would be planted in the society on account
of excessive expenditure,” to point to another assurance society so econo-
mically managed, and that has made so large a reserve for its liabilities.
In the review that has been taken of the opinions entertained by actuaries
on the question of expenses of management, we have shown—
(1.) That it is only when the business of an assurance company is
retrograding or stationary that the expenses are less than 10 percent, of the
premiums.
(2.) That progressive offices are economically managed when their
expenses range from 10 to 17 per cent., divergence from these limits
depending on the amount of new business transacted.
(3.) That no actuarial authority would question an expenditure that
involved the entire loading on the premiums, so far as it affected the safety
of an office.
(4.) That there are actuaries who justify an expenditure of the whole
of the first year’s premiums, and 7 or 8 per cent, of the renewal premiums
besides as perfectly safe, and that the reserve for the liabilities should be
adjusted to meet such expenditure.
(5.) That the necessities of an office may be such as to justify
anticipating the future loading on the premiums to a limited extent, and
that offices are within the limits of safety if 20 per cent, of the value of the
future premiums have been reserved for expenses.
(6.) That unless it has reserved less than 10 per cent, of the value of
the future premiums for expenses, it cannot be said to be insolvent, while
some actuaries maintain that a less reserve would be sufficient to work out
the business if it were transferred to another company.
Nothing, therefore, could be further from the truth than the reckless
assertion made by a member at the last annual meeting, “ that it was an
axiom laid down by all actuaries that anything in the shape of expenses
over 10 per cent, was unsafe.”


CHAPTER 111.
To generalise on the subject of expenses from the case of a particular
office without taking into account special circumstances affecting the ratio
of expenditure is misleading. This has not been sufficiently noted by some
who have recently written on the subject, and it is seldom or never borne
in mind when the question is discussed in its bearing on the affairs of a
particular society. Before instituting a comparison between two Life Assu-
rance Companies with a view to determine which is the more economically
conducted, it would be necessary for the offices to be of the same age, at
least until an amount of business had been secured by both sufficient to
form an average, and that they should have continuously transacted the
same amount and class of business for the comparison to be strictly correct.
But no two companies are ever so similarly circumstanced, and therefore
within certain limits comparative tests of economy are only approximately
true. Life assurance business is now conducted on much more liberal
terms towards the assured than formerly, but the cost of management has
been increased in consequence. The improvements in the practice of
life assurance, and the facilities afforded to policy holders at the inception
of the contract and during its currency, present a striking contrast to the
custom prevailing about 40 years ago. Certain concessions in favour of
the assured have been granted by nearly all offices ; thus the assured are
not now charged either with the medical fee or with the policy stamp, and
the entrance fee formerly charged has been abolished. All that has tended
to increase the cost of management and to decrease the profit of life offices.
But several of the old companies still cling to old traditions, and to ways
of doing business that materially lower their rate of expenses in com-
parison with offices that afford the assured many practical conveniences
and business facilities. Life assurance would be greatly restricted if annual
premiums only were accepted by offices, or if business arrangements were
such that the recurring payments of all the members fell due only on two
or at most four days in the year; and if the assured had to accept nolens
volens a reduction of future premiums in commutation of bonus additions,
with no other option. Yet there are offices doing business in England that
answer to that description, and others might be mentioned whose business
practice is of a similarly restricted character. It is not surprising that the
expenditure ratio of such offices is low, because they can be managed with
a comparatively small clerical staff. On the other hand, such an office as
the Australian Mutual Provident may be characterised as a repre-
sentative society—one that centres in itself the bonus systems peculiar to
several offices, and its members can avail themselves of the one or the other
at pleasure. Declaring bonuses in the first instance as reversionary addi-
tions, policy holders may at any time exchange them for other and various
forms of benefit ; as, for instance, to pay successive premiums as they fall


due, to reduce the premium for the next 5 years, or to permanently reduce
the annual premil m payable through life until extinguished, after which
future bonuses may be commuted into an annuity payable to the member.
They have besides the privileges of varying their option at every division of
profits, of surrendering their bonus for cash at any time, of getting their
policies kept in force as long as the surrender value of policy and bonuses
is sufficient for tl e payment of the premiums. And these are only
instances of the liberal business regulations adopted by the Society. A
society whose system of business embraces all the solid improvements that
have been introduced in perfecting the business of life assurance, and
whose members are afforded every convenience that a comprehensive
system of life assurance has developed, cannot be as low a rate
of expenditure as that of offices working on a narrow basis, and who afford no
such accommodation to their members. It were unreasonable to suppose
that they could, for exceptional circumstances necessitate exceptional
expenditure. It is only as between offices that are cognate, having had
mucn in common with each other, and whose business has been similar,
that comparisons should be instituted. As a corollary from this it follows
that an office may be unique, not comparable with any other, and such in
its pre-eminence is the Australian Mutual Provident Society. Referring
now to some special points of dissimilarity incidental to the business of life
assurance that affect the expenditure of one society and not another. The
ratio which the cost of management bears to the premium income gives
frequently a very incorrect indication of the relative expenditure of two
companies.
(1.) Some offices charge much higher rates of premium than others, and
consequently, in a company charging high premiums, the rate of expenses
will, cceteris paribus, come out lower than in a company which charges
smaller premiums. If an office charging very high premiums be compared
with one whose rates are very low, it will be found there is a difference
between their premiums on the average of 43 per cent.; therefore, in order to
draw a comparison between their relative expenditure, the premium income of
the one must be reduced in the ratio by which its rates of premium exceed
that of the low premium office to make them comparable. Thus, to take an
example : The average rate of premium per cent, charged by the London
Life Association on whole term participating assurances is about 3.49 ;
while that charged by the Scottish Provident is only 2.43 per cent. It
follows that were the London Life to charge only the Scottish Provident
rate of premium, its ratio of expenses to premium income would be 6.7
per cent, instead of 4.7, as shewn in the Table on page 14. Again,
in the Rock the average rate of premium on whole term partici-
pating assurances is 3.31 per cent., while in the Economic it is only 2.78
per cent, from which it follows that were the former office to charge only
the rates of the latter, its ratio of expenses to premium income would be
increased from 11.4 to 13.5.
(2.) If the percentage of expenses be calculated on the premiums
received in the year as per the revenue account, we may be led to
overstate the true rate of expenditure; for if any large proportion of the
bonuses are taken in the form of a reduction of the annual premiums pay-
able, and if only the reduced premiums are brought into account, then the


rate of expenditure in such a company will be overstated as compared with
that of another office which brings into account the full original premiums,
taking credit on the other side for the amount of reductions by bonus, or
with a company in which only a small proportion or none at all of the
premiums are so reduced. To take an example : The annual premium
revenue of the National Provident Institution, on the 20th November,
1872 —the valuation date—was whereas the premiums received
during the preceding twelve months, as per the revenue account, were only
the difference between the two amounts being principally cue
to the large amount of premiums reduced by bonus. The percentage of
expenses on the former amount is 6.4, but on the latter it would be 81.
(3.) Two offices may have the same amount assured, but the premium
income of the one may be much larger than that of the other, if the class 01
business transacted be such as to require higher premiums than the ordinary
whole term of life rates. This is the case when an office has a number of
policies the premiums on which are paid for a limited number of years only, or
if a large proportion of the business consists of endowment assurances. The
rate of expenses on premium income will be lower in companies having
much of this class of business as compared with offices the whole or most
of whose business is transacted at whole life rates. For instance, in the
Scottish Provident the average rate of premium on their whole life policies
at last valuation was 2.45 per cent., and if all their business was chargeable
only with this rate, their premium revenue would have been in
place of .£236,228, and the expenses remaining the same, the ratio of
expenses to premiums would be 14 per cent, in place of 12.6. Similarly,
the ratio of expenses in the case of the Gresham would be raised from 24.1
to 26.3, and in the case of the Australian Mutual Provident Society from
14.5 to 16.2. The above illustrations assume that the expenses of manage-
ment, including commission, would be as great in the case of the smaller
presumed revenue as in that of the larger, but this would not exactly hold
except in the case of an office which paid no commission, or in the case
of one which paid all its commission in the form of a percentage on the
sum assured. In other cases, of course, the renewal commission would be
somewhat less if the premium income were less.
(4.) The average sum assured by each policy in the different offices ranges
from £1,408 to £^X2o, and the ratio of expenditure is affected pretty much
in proportion as the average is high or low. From the Table on page 36
it will be observed that, with few exceptions, the percentage of expenses to
premium income is lowest in the offices where the average sum assured is
highest, and, although the rule does not always hold, as the average de-
creases the percentage of expenses increases. There is no doubt that when
the average sum assured is large, that class of business can be conducted at
much less expense than when the average is small. In the latter case the
general expenses of management all round are necessarily increased ; ob-
viously a much larger clerical staff must be maintained, and the
initial outlay in obtaining new business is also much greater. An
office that assures £1,200 in one policy has not to incur the same
expense as another which issues four policies of £3OO each. In
the matter of medical fees alone £4 4s. has to be paid by the office
which issues four policies of £3OO each, while the office which issues one


policy for has only £1 is. to pay. As bearing on the business of
the Mutual Provident, it may be mentioned that medical fees are higher in
Australia than in England : here no examination away from the head office
is ever made for less than £1 is., whereas in England the charge, when
the assurance is below a certain minimum, is usually 10s. 6d.
(5.) The rate of expenses in what are called class offices is exception-
ably low, nor is it surprising that this should be so when their business is
restricted to certain professions and classes in society. The Clergy Mutual,
the Friends’ Provident, and the University Life offices were established for
the purpose of assuring the lives of clergymen of the Church of England,
Quakers, and University men, respectively, to the exclusion of all others.
Restricted for business to the class they represent, expenditure incurred in its
prosecution can be reduced to a minimum, for most of it comes to the office
direct and without the intervention of an agent. Besides, no appeal has to be
made to the general public for business; the claims of the office to support
have only to be brought under the notice of the class for which it
exists. To argue that because the rate of expenditure in class offices is less
than in companies open to the public, such offices are therefore
more economically managed is manifestly unfair; for the cost of con-
ducting exclusive offices cannot help being lower than in companies
appealing to the general public for business : and therefore it does
not necessarily follow that the former are more economically conducted than
the latter, although the ratio of expenditure to premium income may be
less in the one than the other. As a rule, class offices have not been suc-
cessful, but the exclusiveness of those named has not prevented them from
obtaining a sufficient number of policies to form an average, and that they
have achieved most satisfactory results for their membership is undeniable.
The Clerical Medical and General, the Provident Clerks’, the United
Kingdom Temperance and General, and notably the Law Offices may pro-
perly be styled class offices, but they are not exclusive. These offices
principally draw their business from the professions or classes indicated by
their names, and are, therefore, in a position to conduct it at less cost than
companies conducting a general business, and for the reasons already
adduced. The law offices are specially favoured by circumstances that
contribute to keep their rate of expenditure low. Much of the life assurance
business in England is effected through solicitors; and as the shareholders
of the law offices are all members of the legal profession, they not only as a
class assure with these offices, but act as agents for the respective law com-
panies, and supply them with a steady flow of business free of expense,
except commission. These offices invariably have a numerous directorate,
and as all are members of the various legal bodies, a large proportion of
the business is introduced by the directors. Then again, much of their
business consists of life assurances effected as securities for or in connection
with loans on life interests and other forms of security. The amount of life
assurance business so effected is very considerable; probably not less than
20 per cent, of the new business of the law offices is in connection with
loans carried through by solicitors. Then the life assurances required in order
to protect the lender are generally for very large amounts, more than an
office can retain on one life, and that necessitates re-assurance. By sharing
these risks with other companies, they obtain re-assurances with these again


on different lives in return for what they gave off. The re-assurance
business becomes a fruitful source of new business, and it entails no other
expense than commission. It will be seen, then, that the sources from
which the law offices draw their business enable most of them to conduct
it a less cost than other commission-paying offices, and therefore their rate
of expenditure is not comparable.
(6.) In the case of companies conducting both fire and life business
the expense incurred in conducting the life department is lessened as com-
pared with a purely life company, from the fact that many items of expen-
diture are apportioned partly to the fire and partly to the life department,
which in a company doing only life business would have to be borne by the
life policy-holders alone. In the case of the London Assurance Corporation
the whole of the expenses of management, except commission, are charged
to the company's general profit and loss account; and in the Northern the
participating life branch is charged with only 10 per cent, on the premiums
paid as the cost of management, including commission.
(7.) The expenses of an office are considerably affected by the neces-
sity there is for employing agents to transact and procure business. Many
educated men, professional, mercantile, and others, neither require to be
reminded nor urged to avail themselves of the benefits of life assurance
institutions ; the fact that they exist is sufficient for them. It is, however,
somewhat remarkable that four life offices should be sufficient to supply the
demands of those who voluntarily seek life assurance—that go unsolicited
and assure their lives because they believe it to be a duty, nay, an urgent
necessity. They are those who view life assurance more in the light of a
privilege to be enjoyed than as an obligation to be met. The membership
of the two oldest mutual life offices in England, viz., the Equitable and the
London Life Association, were and continue to be composed of persons of
the class just described. The two offices named have never allowed com-
mission nor employed agents to canvas for business. The only other office*
open to the public that carries out that principle is the Metropolitan,
established in 1835. The Clergy Mutual has also been able, from its
exclusive class connection, to establish and carry on a business without
paying commission or employing agents; but, strictly speaking, there are
only three non-commission paying offices open to the public to assure in.
In speaking of those who voluntarily seek to assure their lives, and go to
non-commission paying offices, perhaps it would be more correct to say
that all other assurance institutions that have been established find it more to
the advantage of all concerned to employ agents and pay commission for the
introduction of business, although it is not to be inferred that the institutions
which do pay commission get no business without it; on the contrary,
some obtain a large proportion free of agency charges or commission. But
the fact remains that excepting the four offices named, all other life assur-
ance companies in England, America, and Australia obtain their business
mainly through the introduction of agents and canvassers. The com-
mission paid on new and renewal premiums, computed on the annual pre-
mium revenue, averages in the English offices 4.7 per cent., and in the
Mutual Provident 4.4 per cent. It would thus appear that the expendi-
* Excepting the recent experiment of the newly-established Scottish Metropolitan,


ture of life offices might be reduced by about 5 per cent, if the business
could be conducted without agents; but it is found to be impracticable,
and no office, I believe, can be named that has succeeded in permanently
discontinuing the practice, or that has deemed it advisable to do so.
Efforts were made some years ago by two Mutual Life Offices in England
to discontinue the practice of paying commission for the introduction of
business, but they found it did not answer, and reverted to their former prac-
tice. The chairman of the “Economic Life Assurance Society,” at their
last annual meeting, said* : —“lt would no doubt be within the recollection of
many of the gentlemen present that some years ago the question was dis-
cussed at some length whether the society should continue to allow com-
mission to those who introduced new business, and at the meeting it was
decided that from that time commission should not be allowed, and for
some time the experiment—for it was intended only as such—was tried.
But it did not succeed, and certainly the most sanguine of the members
were greatly disappointed, as well as the directors, who had not altogether
quite willingly consented to try what many of them considered a very
hazardous experiment. The result was that after a time the Board had to
reconsider and determine the question, whether it was better in the interests
of the society to pay a fair commission to agents, or to do a much smaller
business, and two years ago the Board decided that it would be better in
the interests of the society to revert to the old system of allowing commis-
sions, and though the time had been too short for the society to feel the
full benefit, yet he was able to state that the result of the change was satis-
factory. (Cheers.)” The experience of the National Life Assurance Society
is to the same effect. The following is extracted from the last annual
report —the 48thf : —“ It will be remembered that at the end of 1870, when
the present method of dividing the profit was adopted, the payment of
commission was discontinued. The result of this change has been carefully
watched by the directors, and a committee was appointed last summer to
consider the whole question in the light of more than 7 years’ experience
of the working of the non-commission system, and the result was that a
return to the original plan was decided upon.” And the chairman, in
addressing the members, spoke as follows:—“ There is one important
thing which we have done during the year. In 1870, shortly after the
failure of a large office, we took the important step of ceasing to give com-
mission. Many of our old friends who brought business here and received
commission did not approve of this. The result was not so much for the
good of the society as some of us had expected it would be, and under
these circumstances, after an experience of nearly 7 years, we decided that
it would be advisable to reconsider what we had done. A committee, con-
sisting of a large number of the Board, was appointed, and after going into
the question very minutely again we came to the determination to revert
to the old practice of paying the moderate commission of former years.”
An unauthentic statement was made at the last annual meeting about offices
discontinuing the practice of paying commission or employing canvassers.
It was the same individual who so unwarrantably claimed actuarial autho-

rity for asserting that anything in the shape of expenses over 10 per cent,
was unsafe, who, misquoting from the article referred to, which appeared in
the Sydney Morning Herald of the 31st March, 1875, sa id “that in at
least five leading offices in England it had been determined to discontinue
canvassing” ; whereas, in point of fact, not a single office had, at that
date, discontinued the practice, although two had reverted to their former
practice of paying commission. The correct quotation reads thus, “it
should be observed that four offices, viz.—the Equitable, London Life
Association, Clergy Mutual, and Metropolitan do not allow commission,
and another office —the National—has discontinued the payment of
commission.” The four offices named, as we have explained, are those
who never paid commission, and consequently never discontinued the
practice; the fifth office is the National, which, after discontinuing
payment of commission, had, as we have seen, just resumed the practice.
The fact is, life assurance would languish were it not for the men —you
may call them missionaries—who make it their exclusive business to pro-
claim, so to speak, the gospel of life assurance. Most people who have
effected policies would admit that but for the persistent and persuasive
arguments of the life assurance canvasser, their lives would not be assured.
Those who call it a waste of funds to pay for the services these men render
would rather see an institution die out than be perpetuated for the common
good, provided their personal aggrandisement was promoted. But people
of that class neither realise the apathy of the public to life assurance, nor
understand that it is to the interest of survivors that life assurance offices
should be progressive. In this connection it will be proper to call
attention, and that emphatically, to the fact that the Society from
its commencement affirmed the principle of paying commission to
agents and others introducing business. The first and every subsequent
balance sheet contained that item of expenditure. At the last annual
meeting one of the earliest and most interested members of the Society
observed “ that at the commencement of the Society there was nothing in
the way of travelling expenses or commission, and yet the Society flour-
ished but so far from that being the case, it has always been the practice
of the Society to pay commission. That the reputed father of the
institution, should have made such a mistake is somewhat surprising,
for he took a lively interest both in its establishment and subsequently
for 13 years as a Director. The Society would never have flourished
as it has done if the policy of the Directors had not been to push the business
by employing agents and canvassers to explain the benefits of life assurance
and the special advantages to be gained by joining this Society. In the
first year of the Society’s history 38 agents were appointed throughout the
colonies, and before the twelfth year had elapsed the Directors of that day
had adopted the plan of employing travelling agents to canvass for business.
The editor of the Commercial World (London), commenting on the
proceedings of the last annual meeting of this society, observed, “ The
progress of the company has been rapid, almost, if not entirely, beyond
example. Some members now wish to arrest progress in the hope ot
making a little more profit for themselves. This kind of business policy
has its dark as well as its bright side. Practically it means that the Society
shall work out instead of work on.”

Experience will corroborate the statement that those who assure in
offices that pay commission to extend their business receive as great
advantages, and have as ample security as those who prefer to go volun-
tarily to offices who pay no commission. In other words, the bonuses
declared by non-commission paying offices are not greater than the
bonuses declared by the societies that do pay commission.
Bearing in mind the special circumstances that affect the expenditure
of offices, some having the tendency to lower and others to raise the ratio,
we may draw this conclusion—that when a comparison is instituted between
two companies as to their relative rate of expenditure to premium income
without having reference to the special circumstances affecting it, one com-
pany may really be as economically conducted as another although the
ratios of expenses may differ from 2\ to 5 per cent. That is to say, the
causes that have been described as affecting the expenditure of one office
and not another may be estimated to produce a divergence ranging from
to 5 per cent. Three cases may arise in which, if the premium income be
taken as the standard of comparison without approximate adjustment, the
result would be misleading.
(1.) Two offices, A and B, may be affected by special circumstances
in different directions, that is to say, one cause may operate to reduce
the expenditure of A and another to increase that of B, in which
case there would be a difference of 5 per cent, between their respective
rates of expenditure, and yet the one office may really be as economically
conducted as the other.
(2.) The expenditure of office A may be 2\ per cent, greater than that
of office B from some cause by which the latter may be altogether unaffected;
in that case A’s management cannot be fairly considered more costly
than B’s.
(3.) The two offices may be affected in the same direction, for the
expenditure ratio of both may be 2\ per cent, greater or less than any
assumed standard, in which case the disturbing elements neutralise each
other.


In pointing out the special causes that affect the expenditure of offices
the object in view has not been to show how corrections may be applied to
allow of comparisons being instituted, for that would be futile, but rather to
satisfy candid inquirers of the inutility of making the attempt, except within
reasonable limits. If in two companies, whose expenditure appears to be
the same, a difference of as much as 5 per cent, may exist when due allow-
ance is made for special circumstances, the uninitiated critic would do well
to pause before drawing conclusions from comparisons between offices that
are not comparable. But grant that any two offices could be made com-
parable in respect of the points of difference that have been noted, the
expenditure of offices is far more affected by the amount of new business
they severally transact than from the combined causes that have been
enumerated ; but as that subject will require for its consideration a separate
chapter, its discussion cannot be here entered on.
Before leaving this part of the subject it may be well to point out
that the expenses of management are not perceptibly affected by the con-
stitution of an assurance company. There is no reason whatever why the
expenses attending the management of mutual assurance societies should
be less than those of proprietary companies or vice, versa. When the subject
has been under discussion at the meetings of the Mutual Provident, some
members seemed to think there is no analogy between the two classes of
offices regarding expenditure, being under the impression that in a proprie-
tary company the shareholders take all the profit, and that it does not
concern their policy holders what the expenses of management may be ;
but that is quite a mistake. The proprietary life assurance companies
established in the last and in the beginning of the present century it is true
were in the habit of dividing all their profit among shareholders; but the
large profits realised by the Equitable and other successful mutual offices
some 60 years ago made the proprietary offices unpopular, and in order to
compete successfully with those founded on the mutual principle they had to
modify their constitutions, and this they did by sharing their profits with
the assured in proportions varying from two-thirds to nine-tenths. All the
proprietary companies established since 1820 have been formed on what is
called the mixed principle, and when such offices are spoken of they are
understood as assurance institutions in which policies may be effected to
carry advantage in the way of bonuses akin to that of mutual offices.
Whether an assurance be effected in a mutual or a proprietary office, the
bonuses will be greater or less pretty much in proportion as the expenses are
lower or higher, and therefore as expenditure affects the assured in both, it is
of just as much importance to the policy holder in one class of office as in the
other. But although this ought to be so both in mutual and proprietary
companies, it is occasionally lost sight of by the latter, and the interests of
the policy holder sacrificed for the benefit of the shareholder. This has
been specially noted by Mr. Bailey, in his pamphlet already quoted from.
It has always been a vexed question as to whether the assured derive
greater advantages in the way of bonus additions from a mutual or from a
mixed office. That in a well established mutual office the bonuses to the
assured ought to exceed those of a proprietary or mixed office is self-evident
from the simple axiom that the whole is greater than its part. Candour,
however, compels us to admit that as a class it cannot be affirmed of


mutual assurance societies that their bonuses in all cases exceed those of
mixed offices; while it is undoubtedly true that some of the mutual offices
declare far larger bonuses than any mixed office, it is equally true that many
of the proprietary offices declare larger bonuses than some of the mutual.
Similarly in regard to expenses of management, it cannot be affirmed of
the mutual offices that the ratio of their expenditure is less than that of
proprietary companies. It. is true that some of the mutual offices are
managed for less than any of the proprietary companies; yet, on the other
hand, it cannot be gainsaid that the expenditure ratio of several of the
mutual offices is much higher than obtains in some proprietary companies.
Fierce and frequent have been the controversies between the representatives
of the two classes of offices. Happily we do not need to raise the ques-
tion, because in regard to bonuses granted to its members the Mutual
Provident is facile princeps among offices, whether the comparison be
instituted between mutual or mixed offices.


CHAPTER IV.
The following table is published for the purpose of disproving the
assertions so frequently made that the expenses of management of the
Australian Mutual Provident Society are greater than those of similar
institutions in England, and not with the view of facilitating invidious com-
parisons between offices, for the writer has been at pains to point out how
unsatisfactory such comparisons must necessarily be.
In this table the annual premium income of 73 English Life
Offices is recorded as at the date of their last actuarial inves-
tigation ; also their expenditure for the last year of the period
embraced in such investigation. The figures of the Australian Mutual
Provident Society have been added for the sake of comparison only, and
are not included in the summations. The information is compiled from
the returns furnished to the Board of Trade in conformity with the require-
ments of the Life Assurance Companies Act, 1870. The facts relating to
each office may be verified by a reference to the Blue Books, from which
the figures have been abstracted. The year terminating the last actuarial
investigation is stated and adopted as the more correct period for ascer-
taining the amount of the annual premium income. In fact with a few
exceptions it is only at investigation periods that offices state what their
annual premium income is, and as has been pointed out, if the percentage
of expenses be calculated on the premiums received in the year, as per the
revenue account, the true rate of expenditure will be overstated. Hence
the reason for adopting the last year of an investigation period for
instituting the comparison of relative expenditure between companies. The
table as it stands shows what the ratio of expenditure to premium income
is in each office. But that is of comparatively little value, for the expen-
diture of a single office is not necessarily a test of economical management
for any other office. If the causes that operate to increase or decrease
relative expenditure be traced, it will be found that on the one hand some
offices ought to be relegated to the class that are conducted for less than
10 per cent, while others ought to be rated 3,4, or 5 per cent, higher than
they are quoted. When in addition to the disturbing causes that influence
expenditure, account has also to be taken of the vastly disproportionate
amount of new business that different offices annually transact, it must be
obvious to any candid observer that the business of one society may be
conducted for a percentage on the premium income that might be con-
sidered strictly economical as regards that office, and yet be wholly

names of all the ordinary life assurance institutions doing business in Great Britain, with the exception of the twelve

The reasons for the omission of these three will be obvious. The Prudential, for the first time, in 1877 gave separate
statements of its ordinary and industrial business, and it Would have been misleading to have embodied the results of its
entire business, affected as they are so materially by its enormous industrial transactions. The Briton and the Scottish
Metropolitan were only established in 1875 and 1876 respectively, and have consequently not yet had an investigation.
The figures relating to the expenditure of the latter will be found interesting when viewed by the light of the announce-
ment made by the company that a “ leading feature ” in its management is that “no commissions are to be paid for
the introduction of business or collection of premiums.” By “ Mixed” Companies are meant Proprietary offices which
admit the policy holders to a share in the profits.

inapplicable as a standard of comparison or test of equally economical
management for any other company. Therefore I repeat the ratios of
expenditure should not be used as a standard to measure the relative
economical management of the different offices, unless the several modifying
considerations are duly taken into account; and certainly they should not
be dogmatically quoted, but rather be received with caution and within the
limits indicated. Anything less general than a conclusion drawn from the
combined experience of life offices to test whether the expenditure of a
particular office is economical or not will prove unsatisfactory. The
following considerations will prove that this must be so : —(i.) Suppose it
were contended that the expenditure of an office—say the Australian Mutual
Provident Society—should not be greater than that of any office established
either before or after it, and that only the average of such as are less should
be taken as the standard of comparison; then that would obviously be
taking too low an average standard, for it would confine the comparison to
39 offices established before and 7 after it whose expenditure has been less
than that of the Mutual Provident. It would, in fact, exclude the experience
of 27 offices established both before and after it whose expenditure is
greater, and the effect would be to reduce the average expenditure
from 14.6 to 12.3 per cent., which would not be an average at all, because
it would include only the experience of those offices whose expendi-
ture was less, whether established before or after the Mutual Provident.
Generally, as regards the age of an office, it cannot be said that
old offices, those that have been longest established, are necessarily con-
ducted for a less percentage on the premium income than offices 30 or
40 years younger, for experience proves the contrary. (2.) If the offices
with the largest annual premium income were to constitute a class, and to
be accepted as a criterion of expenditure of another office, such as the
Mutual Provident, having also a large premium income, the result would
be equally unsatisfactory, for the basis would be altogether too narrow.
There are only 4 offices in England having a premium income exceeding
and the percentage of their expenses ranges from 12 to 24 per
cent., while in the Mutual Provident, which is the third largest in point of
annual premium income, the rate of expenses is 14'5, The office that has
the largest premium income is the Standard, and the next largest the
Scottish Widows’ Fund, but the expense ratio is 1.6 per cent, less in the
latter office than in the former. The third largest English office is the Gres-
ham, established a year before the Mutual Provident, and if a comparison be
drawn between its ratio of expenses to premium income and that of the Mutual
Provident Society, its expenses will be found to exceed those of its Australian
cotemporary by 10 per cent. The same objection is applicable to offices
that have acquired only a moderate amount of business. If offices be com-
pared that have a premium income ranging from ,£50,000 to £IOO,OOO,
it would be found that there are fourteen conducted for less than 15 per
cent, and six above 15 per cent., but not exceeding 32 per cent. No con-
clusion can therefore be drawn about expenses, from the fact, taken by
itself, that offices as a class have either a large or comparatively small
premium income. (3.) It would, no doubt, be proper to confine a com-
parative and combined view of expenditure to offices classified according as
they are conducted on the mutual or mixed principle, provided we had a


sufficient number of mutual offices to deduce an average from. But
of the 73 companies in the table only 15 are conducted as mutual
offices, while 58 are worked on the mixed principle. The proportion
that the premium revenue of the mutual offices bears to the total revenue
of the 73 companies is only 25 3 per cent.; the total amount
assured in these societies is and their annual premium
income is 158,647 ; while the proprietary or mixed companies have
at risk, and their premium revenue amounts to ,£5,877,276.
The percentage of the expenses in the mutual offices to their combined
premium income is 138 per cent., and in the mixed offices 149
per cent., the average age of the former class being years, and
of the latter 39 years. As there is only a difference of 1 per cent,
between the expenditure ratios of mutual and mixed offices, there is not
much to boast of between the two classes, especially when it is borne in
mind that there .are only 3 mutual life offices now in existence that
have been founded in England during the last 32 years. It may also
be noted that 4 mutual offices and 4 mixed offices are conducted at
exactly the same percentage of expenses to the premium income ; but
although the percentage of the respective pairs of offices are the same, the
premium income of these 8 offices is widely different, and no one would
say, taking that circumstance into account, and looking to the time they
have been respectively established, that they are on an equal footing as
regards economical management. Bearing these facts in mind, the average
of the whole (mutual and mixed offices) is not perceptibly altered by com-
bining their experience. (4.) The offices that combine both fire and life
business being a distinct class are not strictly comparable as regards
expenses with companies transacting only life business, if single offices are
compared, and this for the reasons that have already been assigned. But
when the business is combined there does not seem any sufficient justifica-
tion for omitting their experience in determining the average ratio of expen-
diture, inasmuch as there is only a difference of 2 per cent, between that
of purely life offices and those transacting fire and life business. There are
26 offices of the latter class, their average age being years;
the total amount they have assured is ,£70,686,177, and their premium
income amounts to £2,189,763, while the ratio of their expenses to that
income is 13 2 per cent. While deprecating comparison between the
various classes of offices, or between individuals of any class, important
deductions can nevertheless be drawn from the table by dealing with the
combined experience of the offices. Applying the table in that way, we
can ascertain whether the Mutual Provident is or is not economically
managed ; for I apprehend no one will hesitate in answering that question
in the affirmative if it can be proved : —(1.) That on the average the cost
of management in all the companies established subsequently to the estab-
lishment of the Mutual Provident is greater by per cent. (2.) That
14 companies established before it was founded are conducted at a
cost greater than that of this society by 5| per cent. (3.) That the per-
centage of expenses to premium income of all the English companies (the
12 offices that have been specially referred to excepted) exceeds that
of the Mutual Provident. The following results can all be deduced from
the table on page 36 :


First, as regards companies established since 1849,
now transacting business. The 20 offices named in
the margin have a premium income of and
their expenses in the year terminating with their last
periodical investigation amounted to so
that their expenses were on the average 26 per cent.,
and one with another the companies had been in
existence for years.
Second, —From the table we leam that 14 life
assurance institutions (indicated in the margin) still
existing, and whose expenditure ratio exceeds that of
the Australian Mutual Provident Society, were founded
in England before that office commenced its career,
and on the average they have been transacting busi-
ness for 38 years, and have an aggregate premium
income of ;£ 1,431,880, their yearly expenditure
amounting to £281,637, or 20 per cent, of their annual
premium income.
Third, —The business of 73 life assurance ins
in England between the years 1721 and 1870,
shows the following results : —The total amount at r

That the Australian Mutual Provident Society should within a period
of 29 years have an amount assured exceeding the average business of
73 English offices by 232 per cent., and a premium income exceeding
theirs by 268 per cent., is a result that must be eminently satis-
factory to all interested in its success. It evidences not only the popularity
of the Society throughout the Colonies, but a deep-seated and growing
appreciation on the part of the Australian community of the exceptional
advantages to be obtained from joining its membership. This is fully
realised by all those who understand the relative positions of life offices, and


in a marked manner by those who are alive to their own pecuniary interests.
This large amount of business, acquired in so short a space of time, in face
of the most active competition for business by Home and Colonial offices,
is unsurpassed in the history of life assurance companies in England. But
gratifying though that be, it is to the economical management that has
characterised the Society since its establishment that we must look
for the primary cause of the marvellous success which it has
achieved. The rate of expenses on the premium income in the
Mutual Provident, according to the last published report, was 14-5
per cent., being rather less than the average of the 73 English
offices established for 39 years. That is to say, although these
English offices have been one with the other 10 years longer in the field,
the Mutual Provident rate of expenses is under that of the average English
Life Office. Apart from the special application of the combined experience
the table establishes the fact that excepting the 12 offices mentioned in
the second chapter, all the other life assurance offices in England are con-
ducted at an expense exceeding 10 per cent, on the premium income. The
expenditure in 58 of the offices does not exceed 20 per cent, of their
premium income; in 7it ranges from 20 to 30 per cent.; while in only
8 companies does it exceed 30 per cent. Thus it will be seen there
are only 15 companies whose expenses exceed 20 per cent These
facts clearly indicate that life assurance, as carried on in England, is now in
comparison with a former order of things in a healthy state. It proves con-
clusively that the life assurance institutions of England, taking them as a
whole, were perhaps never in a more satisfactory condition as regards the
cost of management —certainly at no period during the last 35 years. But
it would be erroneous to conclude that an office is necessarily in a sound
condition because the annual expenditure is within the margin provided
for expenses, or on the other hand to infer that a company is unsafe
because the margin has been exceeded. That there should be only eight
life assurance companies in England whose expenses exceed 30 per cent, is
matter for common congratulation in the interests of life assurance as the
most beneficent of institutions. The healthy state of life assurance in
England now is in striking contrast to that which prevailed when the
Mutual Provident was founded, and for 20 years subsequently. Up to the
year 1849, 202 companies had been established in England, of which only
138 were in existence at that date, for 64 had ceased to do business.
Subsequently to 1849, 223 life offices were established, and of that number
only 48 are now living; and 69 are no longer in the field that were in active
competition for business before the Mutual Provident had started. It will
therefore be seen that 425 life assurance offices have been established in
England, but of that number 310 have either discontinued business, or
turned out failures.* The remaining 115 now in existence will be found
particularised in the table on page 36, from which it will appear that 3 of
the number are working out, 2 are American offices, and 22 either transact
industrial business or receive a very limited share of the life assurance
business of the country; so that it may be fairly said that the
only remaining effective and legitimate representatives of the 425
offices established are the 88 companies more particularly referred to
* The names of these companies and the fate which befel them will be found in the AppendU.


in the table mentioned.* No fewer than 97 life offices have been
or are being wound up in the Court of Chancery, but of that
number only 3 were formed on the mutual principle. If it were possible
to compile a table which would show the percentage of expenditure to
premiums received by these companies, it would be even more instructive
than the table that shows the rate of expenditure of the offices now doing
business. But if we knew the amount of money lost to shareholders and
policy holders by the failure of these 310 companies (and it would have to
be reckoned by millions), it is doubtful whether the lesson would be taken
seriously to heart by that credulous section of the insuring and speculating
public which is ever ready to attach its allegiance to every new or specious
venture, and we must perforce seek elsewhere for that protection to the
unwary which is so essential an element in securing honesty in the conduct
of life assurance offices. What the nature of this protection should be was
indicated with an almost prophetic spirit in an article in the “ Assurance
Magazine/' as far back as 1852,f and has found a practical exposition in
the Life Assurance Companies Act, 1870. By the terms of this Act every
company commencing to transact life assurance business in England must
first deposit the sum of with the Government as an evidence of its
bona fides ; and it is a significant fact that since the passing of this Act only
two companies—the Briton (limited) and the Scottish Metropolitan—have
commenced to solicit the patronage of the insuring public. The former of
these can scarcely be held to be, strictly speaking, a new company, seeing
that it was organized for the avowed purpose of affording additional security
to the policy holders of the Briton Medical and General Office by the
introduction of additional capital into its business.
In instituting comparisons between life assurance companies there is
much valuable and interesting information to be obtained from a study of the
experience of American offices. American soil appears to be peculiarly
favourable to the growth of life assurance offices, and those which have
been established in the United States have been characterised by an energy
and have attained to a magnitude altogether unknown in other countries. In
many respects the conditions of life in America bear a strong resemblance
to those in these colonies. Sprung from the same parent stock and affected
by the same influences, the national life of America has much in common
with that of Australia. We may, therefore, fairly expect to find that so
prominent an institution as life assurance is in both countries will be
similarly affected by the same causes in each. If it can be shewn then that
by applying any approved standard of comparison to the cases of the
Mutual Provident Society and the average American office, the former is in
a marked manner more economically managed than the latter, such a result
must surely be highly gratifying. With this object in view then, and
for the purpose of affording the fullest information on this subject, I
have prepared a table showing the cost of management in the principal
American Life Offices. This table, which is given below, is condensed

from a very elaborate compilation by an American actuary, Mr. Robert G.
Hann. Mr. Hann’s complete table, which will be found in the “Insurance
Times," of New York, for the month of March, 1877, exhibits the premium
receipts and expenses of management (including commission) of 44
companies doing business in the States of New York and Massachusetts,
for the 15 years ending 31st December, 1875, subdivided into quinquennial
periods. It is the custom among American offices to keep the item of
commission distinct and not to include it when speaking of the expenses of
management. In the table which follows, however, I have adhered to the
plan adopted elsewhere throughout this investigation, and have included
the item of commission among the expenses of management; the figures
would not otherwise be comparable.
For convenience of reference I have condensed the results, and
exhibit them for the whole period under review. It might at first sight be
thought that this arrangement would lead to erroneous conclusions, and
that the average expenses of the whole period do not fairly represent the
state of affairs at the termination of the period. But it is found on examina-
tion that in the cases of 15 out of the 44 companies the average expenditure
of the last 5 years is higher than that of the whole period, while in the
cases of the remaining 29 the difference is so small that it may fairly be
disregarded, and we may assume that the percentages shewn in the table
represent with tolerable accuracy the cost of management in American
offices. These percentages, it will be observed, range from 11.636 per cent,
to 50.309 per cent, and average for the whole of the companies 17.646 per
cent. The average age of the 44 companies is 18 years. On reference
to the table on page 44, it will be seen that the expense of conducting the
Mutual Provident Society over the whole period of its existence has been
15.92 per cent, of the premium receipts (exclusive of single payments for
annuities), and when this is compared with 17.646 per cent., the average
cost of conducting the American offices, the advantage in favour of the
former in regard to economical management will be at once apparent.

Total Premium Income of 44 Companies
Total Expenses do. do 28,294,196

For purposes of comparison I have arranged in a similar form the
premium receipts (excluding considerations for annuities), and the total
expenses of the Australian companies for the whole period of their exist-
ence. These figures are all taken from the published reports of the com-
panies, and may be verified by anyone who chooses to take the trouble to
do so. From this table it will be seen that the expenses of management to
premium receipts for the whole period vary from 15.92 per cent, in the
Australian Mutual Provident Society to 49.47 per cent, in the Colonial
Mutual, and average for all the offices 18.76 per cent. It will appear then
that in the case of the Australian Mutual Provident Society the percentage
of expenses to premium receipts is considerably below the average of the
American companies, and is but little over one-half that of any other
Australian office. If, then, this ratio be accepted as a measure of economy,
it must be conceded that the Australian Mutual Provident Society is in the
front rank.

CHAPTER V.
From the table on page 46 it will be seen that at 31st December, 1873,
the close of the last quinquennial period, the premium income of the Society
was £247,678, and at 31st December, 1877, it had increased to £405,044,
so that within a period of four years it had increased by no less than per
cent. Notwithstanding this great increase of new business, the ratio of the
total outlay to the total premium revenue has steadily fallen, having been
16.33 per cent, for the first year of the current quinquennium, while it had
fallen to 14.54 per cent, at the close of last year. Tracing the history of the
expenditure from the inception of the Society, it will be observed that at the
close of the first quinquennium, when the Society had a premium income
of £3,265, the average expenses of the period, including all preliminary
expenses, only amounted to 22.6 per cent. When the Society had completed
its first decade, the premium income had increased to .£19,053, and the
average expenses of the preceding five years amounted to 24.8 per cent.
The income had increased to £67,467 when the third quinquennial period
terminated, and the average ratio of expenses for the period amounted to
15.9 per cent. Coming to the fourth quinquennium, it will be seen that
the expenses range from 21.1 to 12.1 per cent, and that the average rate
for the period was 14.64 per cent. This period marked the establishment of
a Branch Office in the colony of Victoria, and as the expenses incidental to
the outfit of the office were treated as current expenditure, the ratio for the
year 1864 appears exceptionally high. During the fifth quinquennial period,
which terminated in December, 1873, the expenditure ranged from 13.3 per
cent, to 16,3 per cent, and averaged for the five years 14.89, or .25 per cent
more than that of the preceding period. This trifling increase is somewhat
remarkable in the face of the generally accepted opinion that a large increase
of new business is usually accompanied by a correspondingly large increase
in the expense of management, and that the contrary effect is rarely seen.
In fact, it might fairly have been expected that the expenditure ratio
would have exhibited a considerable increase during this period, for it
must be kept in mind that the quinquennium was characterised by—
(1) An amount of new premium income acquired that exceeded that
of the previous quinquennium by £67,122, being an increase of 74 per
cent.
(2) The establishment of Branch Offices in New Zealand and South
Australia, the expenses incidental to the opening of such branches being,
as formerly, treated as current expenditure.

TABLE shewing THE PERCENTAGE OF EXPENSES on ANNUAL
PREMIUM REVENUE for each year of the Society’s existence.
* This period embraces the expenses of 14 months, but the percentage has been adjusted so as to
apply to a period of 12 months.
t Only to months’ expenses are included in this period, but the percentage has been adjusted so as to
apply to a period of 12 months.


(3) Competition from new offices. This period saw the establishment
of no less than five new colonial offices, all of which entered into a com-
petition of the keenest character for the acquisition of business from a field
which, if we except the comparatively modest operations of the agents of
several British companies, had been trodden by the Mutual Provident alone.
It must be evident, even to a superficial observer, that in the face of a
remarkably active and occasionally unscrupulous competition business
cannot be obtained at the price it formerly cost. Reference has been
made to the extent to which the Society should go in its efforts to acquire
new business, and the limit fixed has been steadily kept in view. For the
Society to stand on its merits (as the phrase is), and so save the cost of
canvassing and commission, would be the most suicidal policy that could
well be adopted, for practically it would be surrendering the field to the
new-comers In the interests of the members quite as much as of the
insuring public, the business of the Society has been vigorously prosecuted,
but admittedly at a slightly increased cost; but it will be subsequently
shewn that this increase of new business has been largely beneficial to
such as were members prior to its introduction. It was felt that the Society
would have failed in its high mission if it had neglected to avail itself of
every legitimate means of extending its business as widely as possible, in
order that it might expand into the great and beneficent institution which
it has since become, no less than that by enlarging the sphere of its useful-
ness it might induce the public, untutored in life assurance, to take advantage
of the pre-eminently superior privileges which its membership was calculated
to confer on them. And when it is seen what satisfactory results have
been achieved, it can scarcely be denied that the comparatively trifling
increase of expenditure has been amply justified.
(4) A general increase of prices. In addition to the increased cost of
new business from the cause just referred to, a further increase must be
attributed to a general rise in the prices of commodities. That such a rise
has taken place since the commencement of the last quinquennium, and
that it has been of an appreciable nature, is so much a matter of common
consent that any argument on the question would be altogether superfluous,
and it is not difficult to see that it must have had its effect on the acquisi-
tion of new business just in proportion as it increased the cost of living
of the agent who procured it.
(5) Exceptional expenses. There are few offices whose experience
does not confirm the statement that in some period of their existence they
have been subjected to an expenditure of an unexpected nature, and
which is not likely to recur except at distant intervals. The Mutual Pro-
vident Society felt the pressure, slight though it was, of an expenditure of this
character during the period now under review. Thus the year ending 28th
February, 1873, was characterised by exceptional expenditure of this nature
to the extent of caused by the cost of the actuarial reference, and
the law costs in the dispute under the Real Property Act, Queensland,
Merry v. the Society. These expenses had the effect of increasing the
normal ratio of expenditure to premium income for that year by no less
than 1.28 per cent.; so that the percentage proper for the year may be
considered to be only 15.04. Giving due weight to the foregoing con-

siderations, it will be observed, on reference to the table, that the expenses
of management have steadily decreased from 17.7 per cent, of the premium
income in iB6O to 14.5 per cent, in 1877.
In order to exhaust this question of expenses two tables are subjoined,
in which the several items of expenditure are detailed under the headings as
they have usually appeared in the annual reports for the last 9 years.
Any sub-division of expenses between old and new business can only be
partial, and must necessarily be arbitrary, for it is scarcely possible to draw
a hard and fast line by which to determine how much ought to be assigned
as the cost of conducting the old business, and how much should be consi-
sidered chargeable against the new. There can be no doubt, however, that
the first year’s commission on new business, the medical fees, and nearly
the whole of the travelling expenses should be considered new business
charges. In order to ascertain what these specific items amount to, and
the ratio they bear to the new as well as to the total premium income, the
amount paid in each year for commission on new and renewal premiums
has been sub-divided. The commission on new business, together with the
amounts paid for medical fees and travelling expenses, are exhibited in
the following table :
The amount paid for what has been specifically designated new business
expenses affords a good index of what its introduction has been costing the
Society. It will be seen that for the 9 years it ranged from 3.49 per
cent, on the premium income to 5.35 per cent, and over the whole period it
averaged 4.47 per cent. If the cost of new business be compared with the
new premium income only, it will be noticed from the synopsis given below
that it has ranged from 22.4 per cent, to 33.6 per cent., or an average for
the 9 years of 28.5 per cent. —a rate that does not exceed the loading on the
premiums payable. The years 1875-6 and 7 exhibit a small increase in the
rate paid for commission and travelling expenses; but that was to be


in consequence. Eliminating the expenses thus shewn
applicable to the new business, the cost of conducting the
is exhibited in the following table : —

Noth.—Travelling Expenses have been withdrawn from General Expenses and stated separately for
the years in which that item did not appear. The license fee paid to the New Zealand Government and
Exchange are included under General Expenses. For the last 6 years the Expenses of Management have
appeared under the same headings ; previous years are given rather more in detail than in the published
balance Sheets for the sake of uniformity and comparison.
From the above table it will be seen that the renewal business e
xne
nses
expected, for business has more than formerly to be sought for in the
sparsely populated districts of the interior, and a canvasser must necessarily
stay a longer time for the same amount of business than in large centres.
Besides, it is frequently necessary to associate a travelling medical referee
with the canvasser, so that the cost of acquiring new business is increased
in consequence. Eliminating the expenses thus shewn to be peculiarly
applicable to the new business, the cost of conducting the renewal business
is exhibited in the following table :
From the above table it will be seen that the renewal business expenses
range from 12.22 to 9.14 per cent, of the income, and over the 9 years
average 10.42 per cent. The last 4 years shew a steadily decreasing per-
centage of expenditure to premium income, both in the aggregate and as
regards each separate item of expenditure. Again, it should be noticed that
the charges for solicitors’ and auditors’ fees, for law costs, office rent, adver-
tising, printing and stationery, postage and duty stamps, and general
expenses, bear a smaller ratio to the premium income for the year ending
31st December, 1877, than they did 9 years ago. The two items of
salaries and commission are closely related, the one affecting the other as
branch offices have been opened. The salary account has, of course, been
increased in consequence; but that again has kept down the percentage of
the commission on renewal premiums, and for the last three years the ratio
has been decreasing both for salaries and commission. It is also satisfactory
to note that under all the heads of expenditure the ratio to premium income
is less for the last year than the average of the 9 years. The amount of

From the above it appears, (1) that during the last 9 years the ratio
of the total expenses to the total premium income has averaged 14.89
(2) that what has been described as renewal premium expenses has
averaged for the same period 10.42 percent.; and (3) that the percentage
of the new business expenses on the new premium income has averaged
only per cent, of the first year’s premium. By this it is not implied
that per cent, of the new premiums covers all the expenses that
might or should be charged as the cost of acquiring and managing the new
business introduced, but that as a certain amount of new business is essen-
commission paid on renewal premiums shews a very small percentage when
estimated on the total renewal income, and this is accounted for by the fact
that the principal agents or canvassers have no claim for commission on
renewal premiums, but are exclusively remunerated by a payment equivalent
to a commuted commission on the first year’s premium only. A large
amount of business is obtained on that principle now, and as the system is
developed of requiring the country members to remit their renewal pre-
miums direct to the head or branch offices, the percentage of commission
on renewal premiums will continue to decrease
I am not to be understood as implying by the foregoing sub-division of
expenses that the exact cost of conducting the old business is as above set
out, but I am persuaded that a very close approximation is afforded, and it
will be seen that the teaching of this table points to the conclusion that had
the Society ma le no effort to secure new business during the past 9
years, the expense of conducting that which it had already acquired could
scarcely have fallen below 10 per cent, on the premium income. The
expenses incidental to the introduction of new business have been variously
estimated, but in the experience of most life offices it costs not less than
from 50 per cent, to the whole of the first year’s premiums. The following
is a synopsis of the two preceding tables :


tial to the permanent existence of a life assurance society, it is not a
practical way of looking at the relative cost of new and old business to
attribute the entire cost of the former as a charge to be reckoned on new
premium income, and ignore the fact that to keep an office from retro-
grading—from dying out in fact—some proportion of initial or new business
expenses should be looked on as properly belonging to the ordinary cost of
management, and should be included and reckoned as a percentage
on the renewal premium income. Bearing in mind the multitude of
theories which have been advanced with reference to the limit
which should be placed to the expense of the acquisition of new
business, and the many arguments which have been put forward to justify
an excessive expenditure for this purpose, even to the extent of the whole
of the first year's premium, it is matter for congratulation that the new
business of this Society has been obtained at no greater cost than the
loading of a single year, which is a charge professedly made to meet
expenses, and that no inroad has been made upon the premium charged
for the risk. That this is so in the case of this Society is clearly established
by the figures of the foregoing table. These facts, coupled with this
other, that the Society has for the last 4 years consecutively transacted an
amount of new business larger than that of any other office in the British
Empire, proves that whatever be the case with other offices, the experience
of the Mutual Provident has been that as the premium revenue has
increased the ratio of total expenses to total premium income has
decreased. That is indisputably the most convincing proof that could be
adduced of the successful and energetic management of the Society, of which
the Directors have good reason to be proud, and which affords a ground
for congratulation to all interested in its welfare.


CHAPTER VI.
Following the line of argument sketched in the introduction, the
question now to be considered is this ; —Are the expenses that have been
incurred in acquiring new business excessive, or calculated to lessen
subsequent profit to older members in the Mutual Provident Society ? It
may seem almost superfluous to ask that question now, inasmuch as it has
already been proved that the rate of expenses reckoned on the total pre-
mium income has been gradually decreasing during the last 9 years, not-
withstanding the annually increasing amount of new business transacted.
We are now, however, to treat the question in its connection with the
expenses that have necessarily to be incurred in acquiring new business,
and having special reference to the professional views that have been
enunciated as to the proper method of measuring the expenses of a society.
In the discussions that have taken place on the subject of the expenses
of life assurance companies, no one has disputed that a large new
business would be profitable in proportion as the cost at which it
is acquired is greater or less, or that if the rate of expense increased,
the profit realized on the whole business would be diminished : neither
has any one questioned the desirability of a society transacting a
large new business, provided its acquisition were followed by a
diminution in the ratio which the total expenses bore to the total
premium income; because it is self-evident that an increase of business,
if obtained at a decreased rate of expense, must increase the profit. It
appears, however, to be an abnormal state of things in England for a life
assurance society to transact a large and annually increasing new business
and at the same time to show a concurrently decreasing rate of expense.
On that account the question of expenses of management in relation to the
amount of new business transacted by an office has become a subject of much
interest and importance to policy holders, and it has been recently profes-
sionally handled by several actuaries in England. Do the assured derive
greater pecuniary advantages from joining an office which transacts a large
new business than by joining one which does only a moderate amount of
business ? That is a question which has been examined and answered
very differently by Mr. Bailey and Mr. Sprague. I shall first briefly
summarise the opinions expressed by these actuaries, recognising them as
representatives of those holding similar views, inasmuch as they took the
initiative in bringing the opinions they respectively held or upheld before
the profession. Presenting Mr. Bailey’s views first. —In his pamphlet on
the expenses of assurance companies, already quoted from, he argues that
as in a mutual office the first consideration should be the interest of the
assured, the true test of a society’s success is the pecuniary advantage
members derive from it. That if the increase of the business has been


obtained at a cost that has increased the rate of expense, reckoned on the
total premium income, then that has had the effect of injuring those interests,
and therefore the amount of a company’s new business is not a test of
success. The conclusion arrived at by him is that a large new business
does not benefit the assured unless the increase diminishes the rate of
expenses on the total premium income, and that quite irrespective of any
consideration as to the cost, special or otherwise, of acquiring new business.
The ratio of the expenditure compared with premium income, Mr. Bailey
contends, is the true and only standard of measuring the expenses of life
offices. To quote his own words, “It is sufficient to point out that there is
one fund only, the assurance fund, out of which all expenses have to be
paid ; that therefore if the expenses for new business, or any other purpose,
be increased, this fund must, pro tanto, be diminished, and as the surplus
at any valuation is the excess of the assurance fund over the estimated
liabilities, the surplus must be diminished in like manner.” These
conservative views are easily understood, but Mr. Sprague’s new views
will not be quite so readily apprehended. He combats the conten-
tion of those who think “ that any expenditure for the purpose of obtaining
new business, which has the effect of increasing the ratio of the total
expenses to the total premium income, is disadvantageous to the older mem-
bers,” and contends that a fixed percentage of the first year’s premiums
may be estimated as having to be expended in acquiring new business, and
that this initial and non-recurrent outlay is a charge which does not
require to be liquidated at once, but which may be spread uniformly
over the whole lifetime of the members on whose account it is
incurred. He then propounds this question—What rate of expendi-
ture may be properly incurred for obtaining new business, without
disadvantage to the old members ? Before that question can be satisfac-
torily answered Mr. Sprague thinks the expenses of life assurance companies
should be sub-divided, and the proportion appertaining to the old and the
new business stated separately. After investigating the published accounts
of a large number of companies the conclusions he came to were, that, “in
comparing together the expenses of different companies, it will be fair
to allow one half of the new (annual) premiums towards the expenses, and
that a company may claim to be economically managed, whatever per-
centage of the total premiums its expenses may amount to, provided that
they do not exceed one half of the new annual premiums, and 7 or 8 per cent of
the renewals.” He has further expressed the opinion that an expenditure
of all the new premiums and 7 per cent of the renewals is one that a company
can make with perfect safety, if not propriety. Mr. Sprague, in fact, insists
upon the necessity of recognising initial cost, and contends that as a
matter of fact, fully half the first year’s premium is absorbed in special
expenses, incurred in acquiring new business, that will not recur again
during the currency of the policy, and therefore that expenditure may be
incurred, which although it has the effect of increasing the total rate of
expenses to premium income, does not necessarily increase the charges
against the renewal income. Whatever may be the percentage fixed
upon as the initial cost of new business, the percentage of the remain-
ing expenses reckoned on the renewal premium income, he maintains,
determines the cost at which the old business is conducted. This


he illustrates by supposing the case of a company whose ratio
of expenditure is 10 per cent, having a premium income of 110,000,
the renewal premiums being the new premiums 10,000,
and the expenses The expenses properly chargeable against
the new business of such an office will, he thinks, at least amount to
or 20 per cent, of the new premiums, leaving ,£9,000 as the
cost of conducting the renewal business. If an additional outlay of £2,000,
he argues, has the effect of raising the new premiums from £lO,OOO to
£20,000, such expenditure, although it has increased the rate of expense to
10.83 per cent., has left the expenses chargeable against the renewal premiums
unaltered, being still 9 per cent., while the new premiums are made to con-
tribute £4,000 or 20 per cent., as formerly, towards the expenses. But if
only 20 per cent were assumed as the initial cost, that would not be in
accordance with what he found existing companies really did spend for new
business, and therefore, he thinks, the £ll,OOO expenses would be more
correctly divided into £5,000 chargeable against the new premiums and
£ 6,000 chargeable against the renewals, being at the rate of 50 per cent,
of the former, and 6 per cent, of the latter. If these percentages obtain,
then it follows that the expenditure of an additional £5,000, with the
effect of doubling the new business, would leave the expenditure chargeable
against the renewal premiums unaltered, and would, Mr. Sprague holds, be
an expenditure advantageous to the old members, although in this case the
total expenditure would be increased to £16,000 upon a premium income
of £120,000, being at the rate of 13.33 per cent, against a rate of expense
equal to 10 per cent, on a premium income of £llO,OOO, His justifica-
tion for this increased average rate of expenditure is found in his explana-
tion that it should be observed that the initial cost of new business, which
has been spoken of, either wholly or partially consumes the first year’s
premium ; and he admits that if any company spent even 50 per cent, of its
new premiums (that being about double the amount of the loading), and
71 per cent, of its renewals, such an office would not be in a position
to make a net premium valuation at the end of 5 years. The pro-
portion of new premiums to renewals must always be much greater in a
young office than in one having a large renewal income and therefore the
weight of expenditure necessarily falls on the former source of income, obtained
at the high rate. On the other hand, an office with a large renewal income
may spend the same proportion of new and renewal premiums as a young office,
but such expenditure, when compared with the total premium income, will
appear moderate and be well within the legitimate margin for expenses,
from which Mr. Sprague argues that if a definite percentage of expenditure
reckoned on new and renewal premiums is spent and considered moderate
in the case of a company with a large premium income, the same rate of
expenditure ought not to be considered excessive in a company with a
small renewal income. But before it can be affirmed whether the office
with the large or the small premium income is the more economically con-
ducted, what he calls the equalised expenditure has first to be determined.
In other words as between two companies one transacting a small new
business and the other a large amount, the initial expenses incurred in
acquiring it have to be equalised over the whole of life before the real
pressure on the resources of the respective companies can be correctly


represented. To meet then the exigencies of companies that would not
be able to shew a profit on their business, Mr. Sprague thinks a net premium
valuation is not suitable, and recommends a method that has the effect
of lowering the reserve for the liabilities. This method may be exemplified
by taking the case of an office which spends in the acquisition of new
business the whole of the first year’s premium with the exception of that
part of it which is required to provide for the first year’s risk. In that case
Mr. Sprague recommends that only the proportion of premium for the
unexpired part of the year should be held as a reserve for policies in their
first year of assurance, and that the reserve for a policy which has been
exactly one year in force should be considered as nil. On the same prin-
ciple policies which have been more than one year in existence are to be
treated as having been effected one year later, and the member’s age
at entry is to be considered one year older than it really was. To illus-
trate this we shall take the case of a policy for effected at age 40,
the premium charged by the Mutual Provident being The pre-
mium for the first year’s risk by the H M 4 per cent, table is 1 which
is equal to 31 per cent, of the premium charged, thus leaving 69 per cent,
available for the expenses. The value of such a policy at the end of one
year, according to a net premium valuation by the H M 4 per cent, table,
would be I'43°, while according to Mr. Sprague’s method it would be nil;
at the end of 5 years the value by the former method would be and
by the latter 6 ’3lO. From this it follows that an office valuing by the net
premium method would reserve ;£ioo for a policy of effected
5 years ago at age 40, whereas valuing by Mr. Sprague’s method it would,
for a similar policy, reserve only 10s. or 17Jpercent, less. Expressing
this in technical language we have :
= A4l (I + ®4i) = o'ooo
Also, V 4 s = A 45 _tr 4Q (i + a 4S ) = 7-649
and V 4 _ A 4 (i + a 4S ) = 6310 1-339 = 17J p- c. on 7-649
The foregoing is the method recommended by Mr, Sprague when a com-
pany spends the whole of the first year’s premiums in risk and expenses;
but this would clearly not be applicable to the case of this society. I shall
therefore proceed to consider the method of valuation recommended in his
separate opinion in the case which was submitted to him conjointly with
Messrs. Tucker and Bailey. He there says (p. 101) that if Px be the net
premium at age x, Ax the loading, and C the special expenses chargeable
against the first year’s premium, then the value of the policy after n years
C \
is to be found by the formula + n -(i +«* +n) /•
I + d x
same time he admits that, considering the circumstances of the Mutual Pro-
vident Society, the net premium method may be used with advantage for the
ordinary policies ; that is to say, the Mutual Provident Society has no need to
have recourse to a contrivance of this kind, although for younger and less firmly -
established offices it might be allowable to estimate the liability in accord-
ance with the less rigid standard which Mr. Sprague considers sufficient.


In order, however, to estimate the effect of a valuation by his method as
applied to the case of the Mutual Provident, the whole-life policies of less
than 5 years’ duration in force at 31 December 1873, have been valued by
his formula taking C as equal to 17 per cent, of the gross premium, that
being the amount which was regarded as representing the special ex-
penses of the first year. A valuation by this method brings out a
liability of £102,284 against £112,661 by a net premium valuation, 01
£10,377 less ;* and a similar difference would exist at each subsequent
valuation during the existence of these policies. It will thus be perceived
that this method of valuation has the effect of lowering the reserve
by per cent, and increasing the surplus for division in respect of
these policies by ,£10,377. There can be no doubt that in the
present day new assurance companies cannot acquire business without
incurring a rate of expenditure which would shew that their business
had not yielded any profit, if their liabilities were estimated in accord-
ance with what is technically called a net premium valuation. The usual plan
with companies that have become permanently successful has been to admit
that their expenses have exceeded the amount received and available for
that purpose, frankly treating the amount spent in excess as preliminary
expenses and postponing a division of profits until such had been really
earned. If that has not been done a surplus has been found either by
valuing their prospective liabilities by a higher rate of interest than that
assumed in their premiums, or by discounting a portion of their loading,
in either case thereby anticipating future profits. A third plan is that sug-
gested by Mr. Sprague by which the initial expenditure is equalised and
spread over the lifetime of the policy-holder, but that method as already
explained lowers the reserve for the liabilities ; such companies in fact have
less than 20s. in the £ to meet their future liabilities as compared with
offices maintaining the orthodox standard. As to the propriety or expe-
diency of young companies adopting Mr. Sprague’s method, I express no
opinion; that they have to resort to one or other of the courses above
indicated I believe no actuary will question. But Mr. Sprague does not
propose to confine the method of valuation that has been described
to the case of offices having little else but new business —he finds
justification for its adoption by companies whose rate of expenditure is from
10 to 15 per cent, on their total premium income. A net premium valuation
he thinks is also unsuitable for such companies because their rate of expen-
diture implies that 50 per cent, of first premiums are spent besides 7 per
cent, of renewals; and if a young company cannot stand a net premium
valuation with such a rate of expenditure, no more can an old one with a
large renewal premium income, for if the latter brings out a surplus by such a
valuation, it is arrived at “ through the excess loading of the older policies
being devoted to fill up the deficit on the new,” and that means that a
bonus is given to the new members at the expense of the old. Therefore
he concludes that the larger the new business the smaller will be the bonus

unless offices adopt his method of valuation. We have seen then that
according to Mr. Bailey a large new business is not advantageous to the old
members unless it promotes their pecuniary advantage, and with that end
in view the expenses should from year to year bear a diminishing ratio to
the premium income, because in no other way can they be benefited by it.
For although the business may be increased, so is the number of members
that have to share the profit, and therefore unless the surplus be augmented
in a greater ratio than the number of new entrants, the old members are
not benefited. But according to Mr. Sprague new business is advantageous
to the old members if it is obtained at a cost not exceeding 50 per cent, of
the first year’s premiums, provided these initial expenses are met by a
method of valuation that will equalise them over the whole lifetime of the
assured. In brief Mr. Bailey would say, “Do less new business and your
expenses will be less absolutely and your assurance fund will be greater;
consequently the surplus divisible among the older members will be greater,”
Mr. Sprague would say, “Transact a large new business if you can within
economical limits of expenditure, and account for the initial expenses of
acquiring it by diminishing the reserve for your prospective liabilities, and
then you will have as large a surplus as the office that does a small new
business at less expense.”
I come now to explain my own views on this subject. And first let it
be borne in mind that the question is not whether the expenses of the
society are high relatively to those of any other company, but have the
interests of the older members been prejudiced by the society transacting a
large new business 1 When a mutual life office has obtained an amount of
business sufficient to secure an average so that the mortality experience will not
be subject to violent fluctuations, and moreover has its risks equally distributed,
protecting it from loss arising from an undue number of claims falling on
policies for large amounts, then in further developing the business of such
an office, I hold that the pecuniary advantage of the members already
assured should be kept steadily in view and promoted. An amount of new
business should however be annually transacted sufficient at least to keep a
society up to this safe average; but the expenses incurred to increase
business beyond that should be adjusted as between the old and the new
members in the distribution of the surplus so as to lessen the cost of manage-
ment to those already assured. The policy that has been acted upon in
the management of the Mutual Provident has had that effect, for in
distributing the surplus at 1873 a distinction was observed between
those who were members at the beginning of the last quinquen-
nium and those who became members during its currency; so that
the initial expenditure incurred in acquiring new business was met
and provided for by diminishing the loading assumed to have been contri-
buted by the new members and augmenting that contributed by the old
members by a like amount. Admitting my proposition that the society had
an amount of business at the beginning of the fifth quinquennium sufficient
to maintain a safe average, then the justification for such an adjustment as
has been described will be apparent from what follows. The circumstances
of the Mutual Provident at the end of its 25th year were such as an office
of that age has rarely experienced ; an amount of new business had been
transacted during the preceding 5 years so large that at the end of the

In the final adjustment of this table ‘03 has been added to the percentages
in columns 4 and 7 as compared with the figures in the Quinquennial
Report, from which it is extracted, and column 6 has been inserted for
obvious reasons.
With reference to the above table it will be proper to explain that the
expenses of management as shewn in column 3 were for an official year in
each case, but the percentages in column 4 were estimated on the annual
premium income at 31 December of each year. The total expenses of
management for the quinquennium were X145, 800: if however these expenses
quinquennium the new premium income acquired and then in force was no
less than 58 per cent, of the total, or comparing the new premium income
of the quinquennium then in force with the renewal income at its commence-
ment the former was 138 per cent, of the latter. The expenses during the
period ranged between 13*9 and 15 '9 per cent, on the total premium income,
but did not shew a uniformly increasing or decreasing ratio. Seeing that the
expenses of management did not exhibit a generally decreasing tendency,
there would have been some ground for the contention that the introduction
of so large an amount of new business did not benefit the old members, if the
profits had been divided without giving effect to an adjustment of the
expenses incurred in acquiring that new business. In the last Quinquennial
Report I observed that “ the interests of the old and new members have
been fairly considered in the adjustment of the expenses incidental tq the
introduction of new business.” The advantage which the Society derives
from the introduction of new members is exemplified in the following table,
which shews the percentage of the total expenses of management for each
year of the Quinquennium on the Premium Income :
management for the quinquennium were £145,800; if howeverthese expenses
had been ,£26,910 less, then the ratio of expenses would have been in
accordance with the rate shewn in column 5, and the difference between
columns 4 and 5 would represent the percentage by which the expenditure
for each year would have been reduced. Column 7 shews in fact the per-
centage on the total premium income that measures that portion of the
initial expenses incurred for new business which was specially charged to

the new members. Now represents the sum total of the
several percentages of column 7 on the premium income as shewn
in column 2, and this sum was made a charge against the loading
contributed by the new entrants. That is to say, the part of the
surplus represented by the loading contributed by the new entrants was
diminished by the sum of hence column 5 shews what the per-
centage of expenses on the premium income is after those specially
chargeable to the new business have been deducted, and column 6 shews
the amount of initial cost which was as good as not spent so far as the old
members were concerned, because the went to augment the
amount of their divisible surplus. The amount assured under new policies
for each year of the quinquennium ending 31 December, 1873, is shewn in
the following table :
The expenses charged to the new entrants, it will be seen from the above
table, are equal to a commuted commission which averages 12 s. 7d. percent, on
the total sum assured by all the new policies issued during the quinquennium.
This contribution by the new members towards the initial expenses affects
them only to the extent of diminishing their first bonus by 12 s. 7d. in
respect of each £lOO assured.

The percentage that the expenses are
on renewal and new premium
income, respe
ctivelv, as well as on
the total income,
appears
in columns
It will be observed that the expenses of the quinquennium are here
stated to be that is because the amount of expenses has been
adjusted by deducting from the year 1872 the sum of which has
been already referred to as being of an entirely exceptional character, and
on the other hand to the year 1873 has been added a sum of thus
raising the expenses for that year to which was the true amount
of expenditure for the 12 months, as per foot note on page 9 of the quin-
quennial report. Giving effect again to the 910, this amount of
initial expenses benefits the old members by taking the form of a prefer-
ence in their favour and constituting a first charge against the profits of the
new entrants. It is in short the quid pro quo the old members get as
against special expenditure incurred in bringing in new entrants and is equal
to 17 per cent, reckoned on the new premium income of the quinquennium.
That amount of quinquennial expenses then being accounted for, the re-
mainder is equal to an expenditure averaging 12.6 per cent, on the
renewal and 11 per cent, on the new premium income of each year. It
is perfectly true that the total expenses estimated on the total premium in-
come are as stated in column 6; but so far as the members assured previous
to March 1869, are concerned, the average rate over the period is 12.6
per cent, and the cost of acquiring the new business was to them as if it
had been acquired at 11 per cent., after allowing for the adjustment of
initial expenditure, and that rate represented the working expenses of the
new business in each and every year of the quinquennium.
The apportionment of the Quinquennial expenses when diminished by
the amount specially charged to new entrants, is shown in the
following table:—
The percentage that the expenses are on renewal and new premium
income, respectively, as well as on the total income, appears in columns
3,5, and 7. From a previous table it will be seen that the renewal pre-
mium income bears and the new premium income ,-£17,415 of
the quinquennial expenses \ the percentage of the former for each year is
given in the above table and averages, it will be observed, 12.6 per
cent. On the new premium income the rate of expense is, as for-


merly, a uniform n per cent. The table shews the pressure of the
expenses on the renewal and new premium income separately, and
also when reckoned on both combined. Column 2 shews the
amount of the renewal income at the beginning of each year, and
column 3 the rate of expense of its management. Column 4 shews
the amount of new business introduced in each year, and column
5 the rate of expense for its management; while column 6 exhibits the re-
newal business expenses, plus the new business expenses not specially
charged thereto, and column 7 the percentage of these expenses when
reckoned on the total premium income at the end of the year, as given in
column 2 of the table on page 58, and may be said to be the equalised
percentage. We see then that the new business when it became renewal
income was brought in and blended with the old business at the end of
each year for less than the latter was costing, and that when the expenses
as between the old and the new members are adjusted the percentage on
the total income at the end of each year of the quinquennium is less than
that of the renewal income at the beginning of each year. Recapitulating
the results given in the preceding tables, the adjustment of a given amount
of initial expenditure incurred on account of new business has been illus-
trated by shewing:—(l) That as in the table on page 58 the average
expenditure has been reduced by a varying yearly percentage when
reckoned on the total premium income. (2) That as in the table
on page 59 the amount so deducted is equal to 12s. 7d. per cent,
on the amount assured under the new policies effected during the
quinquennium ending 31st December 1873. (3) That as in the
table on page 59 the same amount is equal to 17 per cent,
reckoned on the new premium income of the quinquennium.
(4) That as in the table on page 60 the rate of expense at the end of each
year of the quinquennium was less than at the beginning, and that the re-
duction was caused by the introduction of new business at a cost which, as
it affected the old members, was less than the renewal premium income
had to bear at the beginning of each year. lam not to be understood as
laying it down that the plan I adopted would be generally applicable or
suitable for any other Assurance Society, unless its circumstances were
similar to those of the Mutual Provident at the end of its Fifth Quinquen-
nium ; and of course it would not be applicable at all unless the Society has
a surplus for division. What may be well adapted for the Society an
actuary officially represents may be quite inapplicable to the case of
another office about which he may be consulted, or vice versa. The posi-
tion of an office may be such that the actuary has to face one or other of
the ascending scales of expenditure described in a previous chapter, and in
that case he would have to be guided in his course of action by the cir-
cumstances of the office before determining what reserve should be made
for the liabilities and how the surplus should be divided. There may be
companies of which it might be said that it would be better for the assured
if a less amount of new business had been transacted, conformably with
Mr. Bailey’s contention; but that cannot be affirmed of the Mutual Provi-
dent, for at the last investigation after the surplus had been divided we
have seen that the large new business transacted during the quinquennium
benefited the members assured previous to its introduction, if, as contended,


mat have ceased to transact new business, sucn tor instance

they can only be benefited by new business when the ratio of the expendi-
ture to the total premium income is a decreasing quantity. Again it will
not be disputed that there are Societies both in England and Australia in a
condition to render Mr. Sprague’s contrivance for lowering the reserve to
meet expenditure a perfect godsend ; but it was of no use and utterly
unsuitable for such a Society as the Mutual Provident. Far from requiring
adventitious aid to swell its surplus at the expense of lowering the reserve
for the liability, its position was intrinsically so sound that not only were the
requirements of a net premium valuation by the H m table met, but the
reserve maintained exceeded that standard by over 10 per cent.*; the
resulting divisible surplus of after making such an exceptionally
high reserve, proves that in the case of a Society as economically
managed as the Mutual Provident has been, a net premium valuation
can be carried out without detriment to the interests of either the old
or the new members. Further, that the interests of both can be
satisfactorily adjusted by giving effect to a proper apportionment of the
expenses simultaneously with a division of the surplus between the old
and the new members, and that the method of valuation advocated
by Mr. Sprague, which would swell the surplus at the expense of lowering
the reserve, is not required; that in short every purpose is served
if the initial expenditure is made matter of adjustment as between the in-
coming members of a quinquennium and those previously assured. The pre-
ceding argument relating to the ratio that the annual expenditure bears to the
new and renewal premium income has been founded on the actual rate of
expense at which the new and old business of the Mutual Provident had been
conducted for the 5 years previous to the 31st December, 1873. The new
business, it was found, might fairly be estimated as costing 28 per cent,
of the first year’s premiums, and the renewal business as costing 12.6 per cent,
of the renewal premium income. That some portion of the initial expense of
acquiring new business sufficient in amount to prevent an office from retro-
grading may fairly be made a charge against the renewal premium income
can, I think, be illustrated by looking at the cost of managing companies
that have ceased to transact new business, such for instance as the Argus,
the figures relating to which appear in the following table: —
* The data used in the valuation were the Hm. (5) table with the Hm. net premiums for assurance
policies of all durations —hence the higher reserve.


The percentage of expenses to Premium Income for the years 1870-77
is shown in the above table, which, it will be observed, abundantly con-
firms the statement I have elsewhere made, to the effect that as the
Premium Revenue of an office diminishes its ratio of expenses is almost
certain after a time to increase. When the office ceased to transact new
business, in 1862, it had a renewal premium income of .£60,750, which
in 1877 had been reduced to £26,475.
There is no doubt, I think, that the cost of management of a life
assurance company working out will be less than that of one
which only transacts new business sufficient to maintain its renewal
premium income at a stationary amount; while the cost of management
in the latter will not be as high as it will in an office transacting an amount
of business which is annually increasing its total premium income. *
Now, those who contend, as Mr. Sprague does, that the average rate
of expenditure should not be used as a standard of comparison by which
to judge of the relative economy of companies, and that a more correct
view of the rate of expense would be obtained if the cost of the new busi-
ness was taken to be “ all beyond just what would be necessary to
administer the company’s affairs if it ceased to transact new business,” drive
their argument, I think, too far; for that means, as is admitted, that the rate
of expense of an office claiming to be economically conducted should
not be more than 7 or 8 per cent, of the renewal premium income.
But as we have seen that rate is scaicely equal to the minimum
cost necessary to manage a company that has ceased to transact
new business and that is working itself out, which is equivalent to
maintaining that an office should be perpetuated—kept alive—exclusively
at the cost of new entrants. Now it has been already proved that
companies which were characterised either as retrograding, at a stand-
still, or making little progress are not conducted taking them on the
average for less than 10 per cent. The inference then to be drawn from
these facts is that the cost of conducting the renewal business of a going
concern should not be measured by the rate of expense at which an office
can be managed which has ceased to transact new business and is
working itself out, but by the rate at which a society can be kept
alive, that is whose new business about equals the amount which
it loses by withdrawals from all causes. The expenses of the Mutual
Provident for the last 9 years average 12,6 per cent, of the renewal
premium income and 28-5 per cent, of the new premiums; that ex-
penditure is equal to 8'36 per cent, of the renewal premiums and
50 per cent, of the new premiums. The higher rate on the renewal
premium income seems to me a more correct percentage to assume
for the management of the renewal business of a company, while 28.5 per
cent, of the new premiums points to an expenditure for new business
limited to the loading on the new premiums. It is necessary to assume
that definite percentages of the new premiums and renewals are spent if we
wish to ascertain what has been called the equalised expenditure, that is
the real pressure of the expenses on the resources of a company. Before
the equalised expenditure of any company can be determined it is neces-
sary to have the premium income divided so as to shew new and renewal
income separately. The total expenditure should also be divided and

* In this table 28 per cent, has been adopted instead of 28.5 per cent, for convenience of calculation, and

reckoned as a percentage on new and renewal premiums, but it is not the
practice of companies to furnish this information, and therefore actuaries
can only approximately estimate what the equalised expenditure of any
company is over a series of years dealing only with the average expendi-
ture I propose to give the requisite data as regards the Mutual Provident
for each year since its establishment. The income from new and renewal
premiums from the commencement of the society is given for even periods
of twelve months ending 31 December, as in the following table :


The preceding table is given for the purpose of shewing what the
equalised expenditure would be on the assumption as regards the division
of the expenses between new and renewal premiums, before referred to, first
by shewing what percentage the expenses are on the renewals in addition
to 28 per cent, of the new premiums as in column 6, and second by shewing
what the expenses are on the new premiums in addition to 12*36 per
cent, of the renewals as in column 8. The column headed “ Percentage of
expenses on premium income ” is the same as in the table on page 46.
The columns headed “ Equivalent equalised expenditure ” in the above
table are calculated from the columns immediately preceding them in accor-
dance with an idea propounded by Mr. Sprague in the Journal of the Institute
of Actuaries (vol. 19, p. 307). If nbe the percentage of the new premiums,
and r the percentage of the renewals that are spent annually, then the per-
centage of special expenses of the first year over and above the ordinary renewal
rate will be n —r, and this Mr. Sprague spreads over the whole of life by
dividing it by the value of an annuity at the average age at entry. This I
have taken at 40, which pretty nearly represents the average office age at entry
in the Mutual Provident Society. We then have as the equalised
I ** #4O
rate which is equivalent to the special expenses of the first year, and this
being added to r, the rate of renewal expenses, we have as the
equalised rate of expenditure over the whole of life.
To illustrate this—lt is found that in the year 1877 the expenditure
of the Mutual Provident Society was 14.54 per cent.; but we also find that this
is equivalent to 54.2* per cent, of the new premiums and 7 per cent, of the
renewals, therefore the special expenses of the first year were 47.2 per
cent., which equalised over the whole of life =-—-=2.93, and this added
to 7, the renewal rate =9.93 the equalised rate of expenditure required.
Or, taking the other alternative, we find that the rate of expenses for the
year 1877 may also be represented by 50 per cent, of the new premiums
and 7.8 per cent, of the renewals which by the same method as we have
pursued above we find to be equivalent to an equalised expenditure of
10.41 per cent.
On reference to the preceding table it will be seen that especially as
regards the last four years, during which an unprecedented amount of new
buriness has been obtained, each of the measures of expenditure therein
indicated shews a marked decrease on that of the preceding year, thus
plainly demonstrating that the increase of new business has not entailed a
corresponding increase in the expenditure.
The following table illustrates the effect of an equalised expenditure of 28
per cent, of the new premiums and 12.36 percent of the renewal premiums.
The expenses computed on this basis are placed side by side with those
actually incurred, and the differences in the various years between the two
amounts are also exhibited. A mere inspection of this table will at once
shew the extent of the variations between the equalised and actual expen-
diture throughout the whole period of the Society's existence, and it will
be observed that the difference amounts to only £10,102 in favour of the
former basis on a total expenditure of £487,792 :

It depends of course upon the proportion that the old business bears
to the new, what the average rate of expenditure will be, but as we have
seen the new business entails a much greater expenditure than the old,
it is therefore essential to know what proportion the new business of a
given year bears to the old before we can rightly apprehend the bearing of
the average rate of expenditure on the finances of a life office. No doubt
the equalised rate measures more accurately the real pressure of the expenses
on the resources of a company, but the public we may be sure will con-
tinue to look on the average rate as the measure of a society’s expenses,
let the equalised rate be what it may. They should nevertheless be given
clearly to understand that the average rate must necessarily be governed,
and be more or less disturbed, in proportion as a society transacts a greater
or less amount of new business.
The proportion that the new business has borne to the old for each
year from the commencement of the society and for quinquennial periods
is shown in the following table :
The experience of the Mutual Provident Society differs materially from
that of less successful companies in several points of practice, and notably
in respect of the proportion which the new business has borne to
the old. Writing on this subject Mr. Sprague observes* “that since
the average rate of expenditure depends so much on the proportion
that exists between the old and the new business, it is not to be
expected that it must necessarily decrease as the total income increases,
even when the percentages of the new premiums and the renewals
that are spent remain unaltered. This will, no doubt, ultimately be the
case, but if the company is so successfully managed that the new premiums
increase faster in proportion than the renewals, the average rate of expendi-
ture will increase. If the new premiums increase so that the ratio they
bear to the renewals remains the same, then the average rate of expenditure
will remain the same, and not until the renewals are so greatly increased
that the new premiums bear a smaller ratio to them will the average rate of

expenditure begin to diminish. So long therefore as the new premiums of
a company are rapidly increasing it cannot reasonably be expected that the
average rate of expenditure will diminish.” Having reference to the table on
page 46, and reviewing quinquennial periods, we find that during the first
there was an annually decreasing rate of expense (except in the third year),
while the percentage of new premiums to renewals was less for each
succeeding year. The second exhibits a uniformly decreasing average
expenditure, and the proportion of new business to renewals, except in the
second and third years, shews a like decreasing tendency. The third period
was characterised by a steadily decreasing proportion of new premiums to
renewals except in the last year, and the average rate of expenditure for the
quinquennium shews a generally decreasing tendency. In the fourth
quinquennium there is a uniformly decreasing proportion of new business
to renewals, and except in the last year, 1868, a decreasing average expen-
diture, The fifth quinquennium furnishes an exception to Mr. Sprague’s
inference that so long as the new premiums of a company are rapidly
increasing it cannot reasonably be expected that the average rate of expendi-
ture will diminish, for the opposite condition will be found to hold pretty
generally in the case of each year except the third. The sixth quinquennium
just terminating exhibits the most remarkable results. It discloses the fact
that in each of the three latter years the ratio of new business to renewals
is greater than it was in the first year, notwithstanding which the average
rate of expenditure has decreased from 16.3 per cent in 1874 to 14.5 in
1877. In fact the society was so successfully managed that although the
new premiums increased faster in proportion than the renewals, still the
average rate of expenditure diminished, wdiereas the experience of other
societies would have led to the conclusion that the average rate of expendi-
ture under similar circumstances would have increased. The same may be
said of the years 1855, 1859, 1863, 1869, and 1873, for the proportion that
the new business bore to the renewals was greater in these years than in
those immediately preceding, but notwithstanding that the average rate of
expenditure decreased. Another point to be noted is that in the year 1868
the proportion of new premiums to renewals was 18.9, and the average
expenditure 15.58 per cent, while in the year 1877 the proportion that the
former bore to the latter was 19 per cent., and the average expenditure
14.54 per cent., the expenses being in the former case 37.06 per cent, of
new premiums, and 12.36 per cent of renewals, and in the latter 26.04 of
new premiums, and 12.36 per cent of renewals. After a lapse of eight
years the proportion of new premiums to renewals is the same, but notwith-
standing that the average rate of expenditure on new premiums has
been reduced fully 11 per cent. The table taken in conjunction with the
rate of expenditure affords another and a striking proof of the economical
and energetic management of the society.
The position of the Society as regards its rate of expenditure, when
reckoned on the total premium income, compared with English offices,
has already been exhibited, but I now propose to compare the cost of
management of this Society with that of the English offices by dividing the
expenses between the new premiums and the renewals according to a sug-
gested standard of what might be considered economical management on
the one hand and rates that point to the limits of safety being exceeded


on the other. Whether the expenses incurred
by this Society in acquiring
;d with those of other insti-
new business have been excessive as compared
tutions will be apparent from the following table

The foregoing table gives particulars concerning the new business and
measure of expenditure of 58 British Companies and of the Mutual
Provident Society. The companies are arranged in the order of the
amount of new business, and it will be observed that this Society heads the
list. The table exhibits in reference to each company the new amount
assured and new premiums, together with (1) the percentage of
expenses on renewal premium income in addition to 50 per cent,
of the new premiums, (2) the percentage of expenses on new premiums
in addition to the whole of the renewals, and (3)* the percentage
of expenses on renewal premiums in addition to the whole of the
new premiums. Keeping these measures of expenditure in view and
looking at the table it will be seen that of companies whose new
business exceeds of assurances the Mutual Provident
Society stands first in economy of management whatever measure be
adopted for comparison. In instituting a comparison with the remaining
companies it should be borne in mind that the Northern, Commercial
Union, Law Union, Lancashire, Scottish Imperial, and Scottish Commer-
cial, all transact fire business, and probably give effect to an arrangement
(common with such companies) by which the fire department is made to
bear a portion of the expenses of the life department. These then not
being purely life offices, and treating their expenditure in an exceptional
manner, should be excluded from any comparison from which it is required
to deduce reliable conclusions. Omitting these from the comparison then
it will be seen that out of the whole of the remaining companies only two
appear to have a trifling advantage over this Society in respect of the first
and second measures of expenditure referred to above. These are the
Equity and Law, an office doing a small amount of new business and draw-
ing that new business from a special class of the community, and the
Scottish Provident. And a reference to the third measure will shew that
the Mutual Provident and the Scottish Provident justify the assumption of
the term Provident by standing in the vanguard of all the companies in the
economy of their management.
From the preceding table it appears that the Mutual Provident Society
transacts a far larger new business than that of any other life assurance office
in the British Empire, a striking fact when it is remembered that the field from
which the business is drawn is restricted to Australasia and that the popu-
lation of all the Australian colonies including New Zealand does not
exceed 2,500,000. But it would be a mistake to suppose that a large new

business taken by itself is an evidence of successful management, or that
policy holders are necessarily benefited by it apart from the cost at which
it has been obtained. Mr. Macfadyen in a paper entitled “ Does a large
new business benefit the policy holders of a life company ” * has shewn
that it is not true of companies in the mass. His argument is confined to
the abstract question of ascertaining whether, when companies are grouped
according to specific amounts of new business, those which transact a larger
amount benefit policy holders more than those doing a smaller amount,
but he does not dispute that the question may be answered in the affirma-
tive as regards individual companies. Mr. Macfadyen points out that the
problem is not “ ought a large new business to benefit policy holders, but
as a matter of fact does it ;” and it will therefore be observed that the rate
of expense at which a large new business would benefit the policy holders
does not enter at all into the discussion. The answer to the question
heading his paper will be found, he says, “in seeing whether the ratio of
expenses to premium revenue is less in the larger than in the smaller com-
panies,” his contention being that “ if the ratio be not less, then, excepting
the possible reduction in fluctuations, the former can offer no inducement to
the would-be policy holder that the latter cannot give.” In order to test
whether the larger or smaller companies had the advantage in this parti-
cular he prepared the following table shewing the new business, the average
premium revenue, and the average percentage of expenses to premium
revenue of 55 British life offices compiled from the Blue Book containing
the accounts deposited with the Board of Trade :
These offices he has grouped into 5 classes according to varying
amounts of new business transacted. Mr. Macfadyen sums up the com-
parison between societies transacting a larger and a smaller new business, and
observes that “ the first offer greater freedom from fluctuation and some-
what less profit-producing power than the latter;” but adds, “it can hardly
be too often repeated, however, that these conclusions are the result of an
analysis of the experience of a class, and would mislead if applied indis-
criminately to every individual of that class.” No doubt the above table
shews that the rate of expenditure is the highest in the group that transacts
the largest business, but when Mr. Macfadyen asserts that “ the increased
business brings no additional profit to the policy-holders,” and that he can
find no evidence “ that a great number of new entrants has a beneficial
effect upon the springs of profit,” appealing to his table in proof of the
statement, I think he is drawing conclusions that are apt to mislead, not-

withstanding the repeated disclaimer that “in thus arguing it must be re-
membered that I am not talking of individual companies.” “ There are
societies,” he adds, “ getting a large new business at a small cost, and on
the other hand there are offices lavish in their outlay with but little to show
for it.” I think it would not be prudent for an intending assurer blindly to
choose from the class of offices transacting the largest new business in the
belief that because the office transacts a large new business, therefore he is
joining one economically conducted. It seems to me that is what the table
teaches, and the only legitimate conclusion that can be drawn from it. A
large new business is not unfrequently proclaimed as the sutnmum bonum
for a life office, but if equal publicity were given to the cost at which it was
acquired, then that would be simply heralding the fact and making a boast
of being on the high road to ruin. There are life offices in both hemi-
spheres of which it can with much truth be said, quoting from the paper
under review, “ that the excessive striving after new business now so preva-
lent among life companies is a very doubtful gain to the policy-holders in
them,” but I have demonstrated that this expression has no application to
the membership of the Mutual Provident Society.
By reasoning a priori Mr. Macfadyen seeks to shew “ that as the new
business augments in a life office, the cost of obtaining it increases still
more and very soon neutralises the advantage of the additional premium
revenuebut that line of argument seems to me to place those who are
capable and thrifty in the same category with those who are incapable and
extravagant. No one will question that the offices which transact a large
new business are energetically conducted, but some practise moderation
and put a bridle on their expenditure, while others hold a loose rein and
are lavish in their outlay. To infer that because a group of offices transact
a large new business, they are therefore more expensively conducted
than another group doing a smaller new business, appears to me
unfair to those offices that are pre-eminent for their progressiveness, but
who can without question claim to be both energetically and economically
managed. It will throw additional light on the subject if we trace the
effect of new business on the expense curve when the companies are
classed according to the rate of expense at which they are conducted. By
grouping offices so as to exhibit the ratio of expenses to their premium
revenue, according to an ascending scale, we can more accurately shew
what effect is produced by offices transacting a large new business as com-
pared with offices doing a smaller amount. The following table includes
offices of a similar class to those given in Mr. Macfadyen’s table on page 71,
and the information is compiled from the returns furnished by the British
Life Companies to the Board of Trade and printed by order of the House
of Commons. The companies excluded* from the table are those estab-
lished subsequently to 1864, those whose new annual business did not

From the preceding table we find that it is not the offices which have
the largest premium revenue that transact the greatest amount of new
business. The offices which are conducted for less than 10 per cent, have the
largest average annual premium revenue, but their new business is little more
than sufficient to make good their discontinued policies; and I have

From the preceding table we find that it is not the offices which have
the largest premium revenue that transact the greatest amount of new
business. The offices which are conducted for less than 10 per cent, have the
largest average annual premium revenue, but their new business is little more
than sufficient to make good their discontinued policies; and I have
already shewn that societies managed for less than 10 per cent, are either
retrograding or making little progress. The table also proves that the life
offices most patronised by the public are those in which the expense ratio
ranges from 10 to 15 per cent, for this class transacts no less than 60 per
cent, of the total new business effected by the 62 companies as against
14 per cent, done by offices managed for less than 10 per cent. The share
of new business that falls to an office conducted at an expense of from 15
to 20 per cent, does not exceed 12 per cent, of the total amount, and
when the expenses range from 20 to 25 per cent the amount of new busi-
ness transacted falls to 8.7 per cent. The English public appear to bestow
their patronage to a very limited extent on offices that are conducted at an
expenditure exceeding 25 per cent, of their premium revenue, for 5.7 per
cent, represents the proportion accorded to that class. Whether the new
business of a life office be large or small, the expenses of conducting it are
under the control of the management, and whatever pressure may be put on
would-be policy holders to patronise a particular society, the public volun-
tarily make their own selection. The combined influence of these two
forces is seen to be most powerful when the expenditure ranges from 10 to
15 per cent.; and I think it has been clearly proved that both progressive-
ness and economy cannot be obtained at a less rate of expenditure. In
offices combining both qualities the profit-producing power is greatest, and
the public follow a true instinct and shew their shrewdness in supporting
those that are both progressive and economically managed.
In answering the question “ Are the expenses incurred in acquiring
new business excessive or calculated to diminish the profits of the
society ? ” I have admitted the soundness of Mr. Bailey's proposition
that in the management of a life assurance society the first consideration
should be the interests of the assured, and that the true test of success


is the pecuniary advantage derived by the assured. It has been proved
that as concerns the Mutual Provident these conditions have been steadily
regarded and primarily kept in view; and it is claimed on behalf of
this Society that the amount of business it has transacted is a further
test of its success, because the interests of the assured have been
benefited by its acquisition. But lam not to be understood as having
joined issue with Mr. Bailey in two of his conclusions, viz., that the
interests of the assured have been injured in companies that transact
a large new business, and that the amount of a company’s business is
not a test of success, unless, as in the case of the Mutual Provident, any
office challenged could prove the contrary. I have maintained, in opposition
to the views entertained by Mr. Sprague, that the total expenditure of an
office including the cost of conducting as well as of obtaining and extending
the business should be reckoned on the total premium income without
reference to the amount of new business effected; that the expenses
incurred for its acquisition should never exceed a rate whether estimated
on new or renewal premiums that would prevent a well-established and
prosperous office from making a net premium valuation • that special or
initial expenditure should be adjusted as between the entrants of a quin-
quennium and those previously assured before the surplus is divided ; and
that the method of valuation he recommends is altogether unsuitable for
such an office as the Mutual Provident, because it has the effect of lowering
the reserve for the liabilities. While admitting Mr. Macfadyen’s conclusion
that the profit-producing power is somewhat less in companies transacting
a large business when all such are grouped together irrespective of the
varying rate of expense at which they are conducted than in companies
doing a smaller amount of business, I have shewn that the offices most
popular with the public are those conducted at an expense varying from 10
to 15 per cent, for that class secure by far the greatest number of policy
holders; and that this Society by transacting a large new business has
increased the profit for division among previous policy-holders, has done
the new entrants as well as the state a service, and has thus been fulfilling
the mission for which it was founded.


CHAPTER VII.
If the business transacted and the profit realized by a life assurance
company progress in the same ratio, it has been said that “ the result to
each individual is the same,” but that is not the case when the initial
expenses incidental to the procuration of new business have been adjusted
as between new entrants and those previously assured, as explained in the
last chapter. Without carrying the argument a step further, it has been
shewn that it has been an advantage to the members for the Society to have
transacted a large new business. No special importance however is to be
attached to any specific amount; it might have been greater or less without
detriment; the point is that admitting fewer members to share the profits
would not have benefited members previously assured, for the increased
business has enhanced the value of the older members’ interest in the Society.
This is so when policy holders, after being assured for 5 years and upwards,
find their contribution to the expense fund lessened, and their share of the
surplus augmented. My argument thus far proceeds on the assumption
that the business and the profit are in the same ratio at successive distri-
butions. But for a life assurance society only to be able to prove
that as its business increases its profits increase in the same ratio is not
satisfactory. Increased business means an increased number of participants,
and if the ratios of increase and profit are constant, it would be true that the
profit to each individual would be the same unless an adjustment of initial
expenditure as between new and old members were made. In expounding
the effect of the progressive policy of the Mutual Provident Society a higher
position can be taken than that which would imply that the ratios of increase
and profit remain constant, or that the measure of advantage from the large
new business transacted was restricted to the beneficial effect that was pro-
duced by lowering the share of expenses borne by the older members ; for
it can be demonstrated beyond question that the profit has increased in a
far greater ratio than the business or the number of participants entitled to
share. It will not answer the question to point out that the amount of
profit divided in 1869 was £97,333, and in 1874 the latter
being in excess of the former by 142 per cent. When however the
number of participants as well as the amount of profit divided is given,,
we have the requisite data for practically solving the question. Thus at the
distribution in 1869 the sum of £97,333 was divided among 7,677 policies,
and assuming that all equally participated the share to each would
have been In 1874 the surplus divided amounted to
and the policies numbered 16,035 > on a similar assumption the bonus to
each policy would have been £14.7, or £2 per policy more than at the
previous investigation. If a comparison be instituted between the ratios
existing at each investigation period between the assurance fund and the
liabilities (due allowance being made for the different standards of valuation
adopted) the result will be equally satisfactory. In 1869 the assurance

These accredited popular tests of the ratio of profit realized by an
office at successive periods of division it is scarcely necessary to observe
have no reference whatever to the share of profit allotted to individual
oolicv holders. The increased ratio of profit realised bv the societv for the
liabilities, including the .£50,000 reserved, were £433,463, and the funds
£536,901, the latter being 124 per cent, of the former; whereas at 1874
while the liabilities had increased to £955.959, the funds had reached
£1,215,745, the latter being 127 per cent, of the former. There are three
other tests that may be applied to compare the relative amount of profit
made by different offices, or by the same office at successive periods of
division. First by comparing what proportion the profit allotted bears
to the total premiums received in the period during which it has
accrued. Second by comparing what proportion the profit allotted bears
to the total sum assured under participating policies. Third by comparing
what proportion the profit allotted bears to the annual premium income.
The following table shows the percentage of profit on the premiums received,
on the sums assured, and on the annual premium income, at the last two
investigation periods.
These accredited popular tests of the ratio of profit realized by an
office at successive periods of division it is scarcely necessary to observe
have no reference whatever to the share of profit allotted to individual
policy holders. The increased ratio of profit realised by the society for the
quinquennial period ending December 1873, as compared with that ending
February 1869, will no doubt appear inconsistent to those whose bonus
was less at the last distribution than on previous occasions. Apparent
anomalies in the amount of bonus allotted to members who were either
differently situated as to age, or who had policies of varying durations, or of
different descriptions of assurance, could not fail to be produced by the
new method of division at its first introduction. The comparisons
that might be instituted would only shew on the one hand how urgently
an alteration in the method of division was called for, and on the other
how effectually it cured the inequalities which had been the subject of
complaint. Those members who were adversely affected by the change
may be reminded that a new method of division—one considered equitable
by competent authorities—could not have been given effect to without pre-
senting inequalities at its initiation. Considerable disparity must needs
appear at the first introduction of a new system when compared with a
former method, for if that were not so it would imply that there had been
no cause for change. The proper time to test the harmony and consistency
of the altered scheme will be when the profits realized during the quinquen
nium terminating 31st December 1878, have been divided. The bonuses to
be allotted in 1879 can then properly be compared with those granted in 1874,
for both will result from the same method of division. If then the profit
realized has increased in a greater ratio than the participants entitled to

The following table serves further to illustrate the point, and shews the
number of
policies, sums assured, and
amount of premium revenue
remaining in force at the end of the years 1873 and 1877 in
respect of
policies which were in force on 31st December 1868.
From this it will be
seen that in the first five years 23 per cent, of the premium income became
void, and in the whole nine years 34 per cent: —
share in it, the members have been benefited by the large new business
that has been transacted, and the question proposed for consideration in
this chapter answered in the negative. The conclusion which I have drawn,
it may be contended, affords only a negative proof of the proposition, and
objection may be taken to its incompleteness on the ground that if the
business had been arrested after the Society had obtained a sufficient
number of members to form an average, and provided no more were
admitted than were sufficient to make up for those who dropped out,
then the expenses would have been less absolutely and relatively; con-
sequently the rate of profit and the share of each member would
have increased. That contention will be refuted and direct proof
afforded of the main proposition if it can be shewn that had such a course
been adopted the expenses, instead of being less would have been greater,
and consequently the surplus less also. Direct proof that such a result
would have happened can only be afforded by taking a retrospective view
of the Society for a period of years. In order to illustrate the effect of
discontinuing new business in an office like the Mutual Provident
Society, or of doing only such an amount as will make up for annual
waste from all causes, the following table has been prepared shewing
the amount of premium revenue which became void in each year from
1864 to 1877 inclusive, in respect of policies in force at 31st December,
1863. The total premium revenue at that date was of which
or 53 per cent, became void in the 14 years, leaving
or 47 per cent, still in force at the end of the period.

In order to shew the effect upon the expense ratio which would
probably be produced by abandoning new business, except so much as
would be sufficient to replace the waste from lapses and surrenders, it has
been assumed in the following table that such a business could be worked
at an annual expense of being 10 per cent, on an income of
Of course it is assumed that the waste from claims is
not made up; these are inevitable, increase in intensity with the
increasing age of the office, and could not be replaced without an
effort, which would materially increase the rate of expense. It
would probably be found in practice that this annua! charge of
for expenses would not be materially if at all decreased as the
premium revenue diminished ; therefore the expense ratios shewn below
are calculated on the supposition that the annual expenditure will remain
the same while the revenue goes on diminishing; the result of this being
that the ratio is increased from 10 per cent in 1863 to 13.4 per cent, in
1877 :

That the supposition here made is by no means without foundation
may be seen on reference to the table on page 62 giving the rate of expen-
diture for the last 8 years in the case of the Argus Life Office, which has
entirely ceased to transact new business. It was shewn in the last chapter
that the cost of management to members assured for five years and
upwards had been at the
rate of 12.6 per cent., that is after the initial
expenditure had been adjusted between old and new entrants
: now we see
that the expenses, although by assumption reduced to 8 per cent., increase
consequently on a diminishing revenue until the cost of management exceeds
the rate borne by the older members when the Society was actively com-
peting for new business. If nonew business had been transacted since 1863,
and the Society had been allowed to work out, it is doubtful if the expenses
couldbe much reduced below ,£5,397, or 8 per cent, on the premium income.
But although 8 per cent, when the process
commenced, the rate on the
diminishing premium income is seen rapidly to increase until it reaches 17 per
cent., for the absolute amount could not be much if at all reduced for several
years to come. We have already demonstrated that the large new business
Notwithstanding that the percentage of expenses was at once reduced
from 14.5 per cent, to 10 per cent, in consequence of the absence of the
initial expenditure necessary to procure a continually increasing amount of
new business, it can easily be seen that as time has elapsed this percentage
has gradually risen until it has closely approached the ratio at which it
originally stood, and which it would doubtless ere long considerably
exceed. If it were contended that the interests of the Society were best
conserved by taking no new business at all the case would stand as in the
following table, from which it will be seen that the ratio of expenses is
lowered to 8 per cent, when the office is supposed to commence working out,
and subsequently is increased from that ratio to 17 per cent, in 1877, or l A
years after: —


transacted has caused the rate of profit to increase, and therefore the share
allotted to members assured previously to the admission of the new
entrants has also been increased. Now we claim to have further proved
that it would not have benefited the members if the Society had restricted
its operations or admitted fewer members to share in its divisible surplus.
No doubt the chief benefit which members of one Society have over
those of another arises from the expense ratio of one being less than that of
the other, but there are many policy holders, and some even in these colonies,
who fail to distinguish between a Society which spends less than 15 per cent,
of its premium income in expenses of management and other Societies that
expend more than 30 per cent, in their endeavours to build up a business.
Mr. Newbatt speaking to this question puts the matter plainly but forcibly
regarding chose who are so blind to their own interests as to risk their
money with new societies that have to spend so freely to acquire the busi-
ness. In a discussion on the question “ The expenses of Life Assurance
Companies : how they affect the assured,” * he said, “If the proposition
were put before a rational person— ‘ Come to this office and assure with us,
not because we are a great and flourishing concern, and can ensure you the
greatest amount of benefit, but because we are young and enterprising, and
about to make an experiment/ and it were put to him further that they
were about to make that experiment at his expense, he did not think it was
probable that man would give a willing acquiescence to the proposition.”
There is another advantage which members of a large and prosperous
mutual office reap which policy holders in a smaller society cannot obtain,
and that is exemption from violent mortality fluctuations. Those well
acquainted with the theoretical as well as with the practical aspect of life
assurance, and who have also watched the history of companies that have
gone down know that the failure of not a few could be traced to the
attractive but deceitful operation of a mortality experience. Allured by a
surplus partly realised from a temporary but vanishing source of profit,
some offices declared bonuses that simply had the effect of precipitating
their ruin ; they boasted of their light mortality—of only so many policies
having become claims in place of so many expected by the table of
mortality on which their calculations were based, forgetful that their
liability for the claims that had not fallen in was only suspended and not
liquidated. It is a trite observation that “ Nothing is more proverbially
uncertain than the duration of human life when the maxim is applied to an
individual, yet there are few things less subject to fluctuation than the
average duration of a multitude of individuals.” A law of mortality
founded on an observed order of facts is unfailing in its uniformity, but the
public, we fear, are not sufficiently impressed with the fact that the safety
of an assurance office consists in the number of lives it has assured,
and that the greater the number of transactions it has the safer it is. In
fact large numbers are indispensable to the safe and successful working of
a life assurance office, for unless a society has a sufficiently large number
of risks and an increasing business it will not be free from mortality fluc-
tuations, or as it has been termed, death perturbations. The subject has
been ably and exhaustively treated by Mr, M acfadyen of the Legal and
* Journal of the Institute of Actuaries, vol. 19, page 9.


General Life Assurance Society. After remarking that large numbers are
indispensable in order that actuarial forecasts may be made with reasonable
hopes of fulfilment, he vividly pourtrays the risks run by small life offices,
observing that “ insurance officials seem to believe that with what is called
a true mortality table as basis, then death claims are necessarily provided
for; and whether as a matter of theory this is really believed or no there
is not a doubt of the fact that there are life offices carrying on business
with a number of policies so trifling that prediction as to their claims is
impossible. In companies with a very small number of risks the insurance
ol life is not founded on mathematical principles at all. Such offices
instead of ruling the laws of chance are their sport. And notwithstanding
the zero in their favour of selection, or even the double zero of selection
and loading, it would be far from surprising if in the roulette game such
offices are playing, Death were occasionally to break the bank.” There is
an additional risk that small offices have to contend against. It may
happen with an office, old or young, that the mortality of a particular year
is considerably under the average of former years, and yet the amount paid
for claims in that year may perhaps be more than doubled ; this is to be
ascribed to the mortality accidentally falling on the lives of members
assured for large amounts. It is a matter of comparative indifference to a
society with a large number of risks whether the claims for the year have
fallen on large rather than on small policies, for it is customary for offices
to fix a limit to the amount to be retained at risk on one life ; but young
societies have been severely injured by their claims in a particular year
falling among the lives assured for the maximum sum they retain instead
of on the same number of small or average policies. The injury and
inconvenience to the young office may be so serious from the two causes
referred to, viz., both the number and amounts of the polcies becoming
claims being above the average, that it has not unfrequentlyi happened that
either the bonuses have been suspended or the profits been greatly
diminished, discontent engendered among the members, and the progress
of the office itself materially retarded.
Having thus indicated that it is an essential condition of the safety of
an office that it should acquire a sufficiently large business to secure it
against violent fluctuations in the rate of mortality, it should be added that
it is no less essential that this condition should be permanently maintained
—that the total business of the office should at least not exhibit a
decreasing tendency ; and further, that that business should be tolerably
fairly distributed among the various ages of the lives assured. Now there
can be no doubt that the business of the Mutual Provident Society
amounting as it does to over 35,000 policies, assuring an amount exceed
ing ;£i2,000,000, is a sufficiently large one to prevent any of the
fluctuations above alluded to. There can be equally little doubt that if
the Society abandoned the progressive policy of competing for new
business which it at present adopts the current of business which naturally
flows towards an office of such acknowledged superiority as this is would
be sufficient for some years to replace the yearly loss by lapse, surrender,
and death, and to preserve the Society in a stationary state. But what
would be the condition of affairs after the lapse of 10 or 20 years? Tne
terminated policies would by that time have so largely increased in number


that the natural accession of new business would be altogether inadequate
to prevent the Society from retrograding, and the average ages of the lives
assured would have increased so abnormally, owing to the small proportion
of new and therefore ot young lives which were being introduced, that the
mortality might become excessive. The Society would then have no other
alternative than that of working out; for if it attempted then to enter the
field as an active competitor for new business, it would find that the name
and prestige which were once so potent had lost their power; that the office
had ceased to have a hold upon the public whose sympathy had become
alienated from it; that young and energetic competitors had obtained the
position in public estimation which it once enjoyed; and it would be
compelled either to abandon the contest altogether, as many companies in
England have done, or continue it at a cost and with a result that would
be highly disadvantageous to its existing members. An illustration of the
necessity for pursuing a progressive policy is to be found in the course
recently adopted by the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York,
and to which it has been driven with the view of avoiding the catastrophe
above indicated. This company is the largest life assurance institution in
the world; it is perhaps the most conservative office in the United States;
and it has been managed with remarkable prudence and sagacity. Trans-
acting for many years a new business amounting to from six to eight
millions sterling of new assurances, its total business continued to
increase rapidly; but of late years so great has been the number of policies
becoming void that notwithstanding the acquisition yearly of a large
amount of new business, the total policies in force have begun to exhibit
a decreasing tendency. The accounts for the years 1876 and 1877 are as
under:—
1876.— New, 9,344 policies for Decrease.
Void, 9,612 „ 268 policies for
1877. —New, 8,494 policies for
Void, 9,066 „ 6,748,308
572 „ £1, 357,945
With this state of affairs before it, the Mutual Life Insurance Company
has awakened to the necessity for renewed exertion, and has inaugurated a
course of procedure which in these colonies would cause some
consternation if adopted by the Mutual Provident Society to increase
its business. This company has, in addition to the ordinary
commission to its agents, undertaken to allow all new assurants a discount
or reduction of 30 per cent, on the ordinary premium during the first and
second years of assurance, the premium to revert to the normal amount at
the end of the second year. This step can of course only have been taken
because the necessity for maintaining a regular influx of new entrants, more
than sufficient to replace those who yearly retire, was keenly felt and
recognised. It goes to an extreme to which no office in these colonies
except the Mutual Provident could go, but it is powerful evidence from a
It is the practice of American Companies to consider every proposal accepted as a policy issued,
although no risk may actually be incurred. In the Mutual Provident Society no proposal is considered as
a policy unless the first premium has been actually received. Adopting the American system, the new
business of the Mutual Provident Society for the year 1877 would have been 6,645 policies, assuring
instead of 5,150 policies, assuring ,£1,880,070, as reported.


valuable authority in support of the principle which I have been maintain-
ing. The case of this American company is so much in point that it may
be interesting to quote some of the reasons advanced in explanation of the
course adopted, The circular issued by the company states : —“ After a
life insurance company has become firmly established, if its tables of rates
have been conservatively constructed, it may if it see fit decline to do new
business or to use the ordinary agencies for procuring it; and its premium
receipts on continuing policies will suffice under judicious management to
pay every death claim as it matures. At the outset and for some years
thereafter the duration of life among its policy-holders being greater than
the mortality called for by the tables, a surplus is created which may be
returned to the insured as dividends. But as the ages of the insured
increase the mortality increases also, the surplus diminishes as the dividends
decrease.”
“ This is the foundation of, and justification for, the expenditure of
money belonging to the existing policy holders to procure new business.
The entire agency system of all the life insurance companies in the country
rests upon the fact that the introduction of new lives retards the progression
of the death rate, thereby maintaining the annual surplus at a uniform or
accumulating amount and permitting the payment of dividends at a
uniform or accumulating rate. But for the constant introduction of new
lives as above stated the dividends must necessarily decrease It is there-
fore to the pecuniary interest of the existing policy holders that their
money should be used within reasonable limit for the constant procure-
ment of new business.”
In this connection it is important to note that the continuous intro-
duction of new lives in large numbers into an office has the effect so
much to be desired of keeping down the average duration of the policies,
and consequently the average age of the lives assured. It is of vital
importance that an office should be preserved in a condition of this kind,
although, singularly enough, this is a point upon which much misconception
appears to exist. It is not unusual to hear the argument urged by persons
partially conversant with the subject, that an office after having been in
existence for 30 or 40 years is more secure than one of shorter duration,
and that the critical period of its existence has not been passed until a
generation, a period of about 33 years, has elapsed. But the fact is that
the time during which an office has been in operation may have but little
influence on its age, properly so called, for the average duration of the
assurance risks is that which determines the real age of an office. In
speaking of an old office then we should be understood to refer to one
whose policies have on the average been in force for a considerable time,
and the lives assured in which are consequently well advanced in years.
Viewed in this light it will be evident that an office which has been in
operation for more than a century may yet be a comparatively young office,
and indeed there seems no reason to suppose that it will be much older, in
the sense in which we speak of the age of an office, than one which has
only been in operation for half that time, seeing that the entrants of a
century ago will long since have given place to their successors. The
experiences of the Equitable and Law Life offices are cases in point. The
former office has been established for 116 years, and the latter for 55, but


the average age of the assurance risks in the Equitable has been estimated
to be 21.4 years, and in the Law Life 30.4. These averages have been
taken from a table published by Mr. Curtis, Actuary to the Gresham Life
office.* He determined the average age of the assurance risks in 51
offices, and in 8 only did it exceed 20 years. Omitting a large
industrial office the duration of the risks ranged from 4.6 to 30.4
years.t The office with the policies having the shortest duration had been
established for 16 years ; that having the longest had been in existence for
55 years. The average age of the polices brought under observation in
several of the more important mortality statistics will be seen from the

Here we deal with perfectly trustworthy data. From this table it will
appear that in no case does the experience extend to an age of even 12
years. In the Mutual of New York where upwards of 100,000 lives were
brought under observation, and which had existed for 3 1 years, the average
age of the policies was but years, and in the Australian Mutual Provi-
dent with its 17,511 policies, which were in force in 1873, the average age
of the policies at the end of its 25th year did not exceed 5 years. No
office in fact can become very old unless it transacts in its later years
a much smaller amount of new business than it did during the earlier period
of its history ; because as the average age of new entrants does not vary
very materially an increasing influx of new assurers will have the effect of
neutralising the increasing age of the old members as well as the increasing
duration of their policies. An office has begun to age in the true sense of
the word when its policies have endured, on the average, for 15 or 20 years.
Reckoned merely by the number of years it has existed the age of a life
assurance society counts for nothing, and can confer no special advantages
in virtue of its antiquity. An energetically managed life office should never
be allowed to get old, but should be preserved in a state of active and
vigorous youth; for once well established on a sound basis a life
assurance society is an institution that should last from age to age;
* “Factsand Fallacies concerning Life Assurance Companies.”—London, Rixon & Arnold, 1875.
t The method Mr. Curtis adopted to find the average age of the policies of the different Societies can
only be accepted as approximately correct, although, no doubt, it gives the duration “ within limits
sufficiently near for the purpose of a general comparison.”


but its permanent prosperity can only be secured by obtaining a con-
tinuous influx of new and carefully selected lives, for the young may
die, but the old must Upwards of 5,000 policies are now issued annually
by this Society ; let us assume that they represent that number of lives,

The table shews the annual decrement by death of 5000 entrants at
age 35, according to the Institute of Actuaries table, and it will be seen
that after the lives have been assured for 25 years the deaths begin to
increase rapidly ; that in 33 years the original number is reduced by one
half, and that in 62 years the last of the 5,000 will be dead. The gradual
extinction by death of a year’s new entrants gives however only a partial


indication of the rapid decrease which takes place in the membership of a
life office, for at the end of 5 years, of the 5,000 that entered not more than
3,75° will have policies in force; that is to say the number discontinued
from all causes will be about 25 per cent, of the original number, and that
percentage is less than most offices experience whose policies do not on the
average exceed 5 years of age. As the lapsed and surrendered policies
are generally held by the healthiest lives those who are left enjoy less
vitality, and consequently die off more rapidly than might be supposed
from an inspection of the table, hence the necessity for a continual influx
of selected members to repair the waste.
We have proved then that the large new business transacted has caused
the rate of profit to increase, and that had the Society restricted its opera-
tions the expenses of managenent would have been increased, and the profit
to each member would have been less ; also that if new business had been
practically suspended, it would in addition to these disadvantages have left
the Society exposed to loss arising from mortality fluctuations ; from which
it must be apparent that it would not be to the advantage of the members
who have already participated in the profits if the Society had transacted a
less amount of new business or admitted fewer members to share the
profits.
Having now taken a review of the Society’s progress during the last
nine years, and proved that, uninterrupted as was the success which it
enjoyed in its earlier years, it was not as marked as that by which the
period under review has been distinguished ; that as it has grown in years
it has grown in public favour; that it has been conducted at a rate of
expense below the average of that of all the English Life Offices (the effete
Societies alone excepted), less than the average of the American Companies,
and but little more than half that at which the new Australian offices
are managed; that it has acquired a total annual revenue exceeded
only by that of two offices in the British Empire; that notwith-
standing it was established only 30 years ago, it has outstripped
every office in the old country in the race for business, I cannot more
appropriately conclude the retrospect that has been taken than by remind-
ing the members of the motives that animated the founders and the objects
which the Society was designed to accomplish. Thirty years ago it was
written in the first prospectus : —“ When the immense advantages of an
institution of this kind are seen, how many thousands of all ranks will be
anxious to avail themselves of the benefits which are thus held out to
them ; the very working of it will teach them the value of a good life ; in
proportion to the numbers who join the Society will habits of forethought,
sobriety, and provident economy be generated and strengthened amongst
us, and the younger they are who join the Society, the greater advantages
will they derive from it. In the same proportion shall we be removed from
the necessity of adopting a poor law in the colony, a law which the experi-
ence of the mother country has shown to be a great and growing evil to all,
to the recipients as well as to the payers of poor rates. The love of ease
natural to man will always tempt him to live upon the labour of others, if
the opportunity for doing so be presented to him. A poor law induces a
man to rely upon others —life assurance or the securing an annuity for old
age, teaches him to rely upon himself.”


Owing to the disinterested action of the older membership, the Society
was enabled five years ago to effect changes in its system of doing business
which have secured for it a future progressiveness, a permanent vitality, and
a lasting popularity. We have at least one instance of an assurance
society that could once boast of as proud a pre-eminence as that of the
Mutual Provident Society, but there the members clamoured for the
public to be excluded; a majority, bent on selfish aims and seeking only
personal aggrandisement prevailed, but only to their subsequent discom-
fiture, for their sun went down at noon; in this office patriotism triumphed
and the members have founded a society for posterity. The Mutual
Provident Society may confidently look forward to a more abundant
prosperity and to a lasting increase, provided the management in time to
come be characterised by enthusiastic zeal on behalf of the uninsured
throughout these colonies, and if it never lapse into a state of dignified
indifference about its progress, never presume to “stand on its merits” for
support, never rest satisfied with results already obtained, but be ever
pressing forward and perseveringly adding to the number already banded
together for mutual help and benefit. By wisely administering its affairs
so as to secure the greatest good for the greatest number and continuing in
the future the progressive policy that has characterised the past, the
Australian Mutual Provident Society will be handed down as from sire to
son, a heritage to succeeding generations, and its usefulness be extended
throughout all time.

Extracts from a Pamphlet entitled
“LIFE ASSURANCE:
ITS SCHEMES, ITS DIFFICULTIES, AND ITS ABUSES.”*
What is Life Assurance 1 Had this question been asked a century
ago it would have occasioned some surprise had it met with a ready or
explicit answer; for, general as the practice has since become, it was at
that time in its infancy—a rude and imperfect scheme, practically known to
few, seldom resorted to, and even where known, so little were its appli-
cations understood, that it was often censured as a species of deliberate
gambling than admired for its ingenuity or philanthropy. * * *
Notwithstanding the publicity given to the scheme, the general public
continues to be almost as ignorant of the real pretensions and character of
Life Assurance as it was a century ago, otherwise there would scarcely be
found so many ready dupes to the preposterous promises of impudent
speculators, nor haply so fruitful a supply of those visionary and extravagant
schemes to which, to the regret of the sober-minded, every passing hour is
giving birth. Better the total obscurity of former years than the present
glimmering of perception, which only enables men to view the subject in a
false and delusive light.
The facility with which new Assurance Offices are set on foot, the
tempting promises with which each new scheme is baited, together with the
abuses, which ill-directed competition amongst the established Societies
has introduced into practice, have, in too many instances, lulled public
caution to sleep, and converted a scheme of infinite utility and philan-
thropy into one of the greatest speculative projects of the present day.
***** * * * J
A life assurance institution, during a long and improvident infancy,
may have exhausted or weakened those funds which in its maturity were
intended to provide against the inevitable increase in the number of its
claimants, in which case it will be compelled, in order to avoid open
bankruptcy, to dispute its liabilities on the most frivolous pretences, and to
endeavour by legal quibbles, and under the most disingenuous objections
to shuffle out of the payment of the claims of its deceased members. As
no one, perhaps, dreams of the necessities of institutions so situated, and
as the rumour of disputed claims may possibly never reach the public ear,
the assurer goes on, time after time, sinking his premiums in blind security
until he is awakened, too late, to the frightful reality before him.
* * It is not our wish to stay altogether the hand of
improvement, but merely to restrain and guide it in its motions. We
* London : W. S. D. Pateman, 1852.


confess that we are more than half inclined to suspect that this rage for
cheap premiums is encouraged and fed by a desire on the part of the
directors of recent societies to bring business to their respective offices.
We do not believe that it either is or can be a measure countenanced by
the professional advisers of these institutions. We are confident that an
actuary who, both as a mathematician and as a financier, is called upon to
investigate this subject in all its various bearings, would hesitate consider-
ably before he ventured to recommend so dangerous a measure as that
of cheap premiums. By which term we mean those rates which are
considerably below the average demanded by the general body of the
offices. We speak harshly of this system of cheap premiums, because we
feel that it is an evil daily becoming more formidable. We are sorry to say
that it has become a common boast of many new offices, in their public
advertisements, that they offer the lowest rates of premiums possible with-
out compromising the safety of the institution ! I Such advertisements
speak volumes. Who, we would ask, would open-eyed venture to place so
sacred a trust, as the future provision of a young family, in the hands of a
society which spontaneously acknowledged the charge of approaching so
closely to the line which divides security from insecurity ? Should we be
considered in possession of our senses were we to risk our necks by travel-
ing on a railroad, the engineer of which, at the outset of the journey,
promised to put the engine to its extremest speed, with the comfortable
assurance that however great the pressure on the boiler might become, it
should be preserved just short of an actual explosion ? Absurd as it may
appear, such a promise, on the part of the engineer, is not more preposterous
than that daily held out by the cheap premium offices. We repeat that to
prudent and cautious insurers, to men who look for the certain fulfilment of
their expectations, all such apparently enticing offers should be as lanterns
and watchmen before the house!! In our opinion any society offering
prominently the pretended immediate advantage of a rate ot contribution
much below the average, or, in other words, cheap premiums of assurance,
so far from conferring a benefit on the insurer is in reality, by that very
circumstance, holding out to him a sign which ought to determine him in
the rejection rather than in the selection of such an office. * * *
A life assurance society is the guardian of so many and such highly
important interests that it should invest its funds only on the most cautious
principle and in the most permanent securities which can be found. Govern-
ment funds and loans on the mortgage of landed f property are manifestly
the securities which will be usually selected. * * * * It
is, however, true that speculative investments will realize a higher rate of
interest than we have named ; but what husband, father, or guardian would
feel disposed to assure his life, or to confide his property to the care of an
institution which he imagined would invest its funds in uncertain securities.
* * * * # * * *
Our foregoing observations are intended to point out how many
formidable obstacles exist at the present time, and even under ordinary
circumstances, opposing, as it were, a favorable issue to the operations of a
life assurance society, even where the same is honestly and prudently
conducted. What then ought to be the astonishment of the public, nay,
reasonably speaking, what should be its indignation, when, day after day,


year after year, it witnesses the continual advent of new offices bringing
with them little else than delusive promises and pernicious schemes, yet
charging the established offices, because they endeavour to expose and
arrest the coming evil, with ignorance and fraud, while they themselves are,
in reality, by their own reckless career, and by the ultimate ruin which
must overtake them, drawing down contempt and disgrace on the truest
system of Philanthropy which was ever given to the world ? The success
of one or two of the older societies, under an entirely different aspect of
affairs, has completely blinded the public to the difficulties of insuring an
equally successful career for modem institutions. * * * *
It is extremely difficult for a person not theoretically and practically
acquainted with the doctrine of life contingencies to determine whether a
surplus, even when such is shewn by the books of the Society, is real or
apparent. We have already stated that the surplus is the difference
between the actual capital or accumulating fund and the aggregate of the
sums due to the body of the surviving members Now, it is well known
that in estimating the amount of the Society’s debt or engagements to its
members, it is neither expected nor assumed that the members will call for
immediate payment, nor indeed have they the right to do so. It is there-
fore in the power of the managers of the Society, or we should rather say
in the power of its actuary, to value this debt either as high or as low as he,
in his individual judgment, may think fit. If, from over caution, he value
the debt unduly high, the resulting surplus will necessarily appear to be
small, while, in reality, it may be of considerable amount; and this,
although an error, would be an error on the safe side. If, on the contrary,
from a wish to make it appear that the Society is prosperous, he should be
so inconsiderate as to value this debt too low, the apparent surplus would
be very large, while, in sober truth, the Society might be on the very verge
of bankruptcy. In such a state of things, however, a large bonus would
be declared out of this unreal surplus to the gratified members. The
praises of the office would be sounded far and wide, and a number of
new applicants for assurance would flock to its doors, and it would bear
every outward indication of great and deserved prosperity. Possibly, the
representatives of those few members who were so fortunate as to die
during this halcyon period, would reap the advantage of the unworthy
trick which had been played;
“ If ’twere then to die, ’twere then to be most happy !”
while, on the other hand, the representatives of those members who might
unfortunately live some few years longer (thus contributing more largely to
the Society’s funds) might consider themselves fortunate if they obtained
from the wreck even the bare amount originally assured. * *
The great evil of all this is, that individuals who are ignorant of the
real nature of the scheme of Life Assurance are, by means of these flat-
tering promises, enticed away from more prudent and less boastful
institutions.
