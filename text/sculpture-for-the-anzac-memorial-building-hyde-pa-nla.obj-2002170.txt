A DESCRIPTION OF THE ANZAC MEMORIAL
BUILDING, NEW SOUTH WALES,
BY LIONEL G. WIGMORE
The arts ot the sculptor and architect, by which
have been evolved the Anzac Memorial, have as their
aim the creation of form and design appropriate to
an event unprecedented in the world's history and to
a young and virile nation.
The work has been inspired wholly by this aim
rather than by classic precedent. An earnest en-
deavour has been made to execute a Memorial worthy
of the State and the Nation, in keeping with the
magnitude of the event and the sacredness of the
memory of those whose courage, endurance and
sacrifice it is intended to symbolise.
It is intended also to inspire in those who visit it
a spirit of meditation and determination that the
sacrifices of Australia's men and women in the war
shall not have been in vain; that despite the dis-
illusionment of the post-war period the world shall
be nobler for their sake.


1
CRUCIFIXION OF CIVIL I Z A T 10N—1914


Sculpture was selected by the architect as the
medium, by which the task could best be completed,
of conveying to present and future generations the
tragedy of modern warfare. The sculptor has
designed and modelled his works so that they may
arise naturally from the architecture and harmonise
with the general design.
The spirit of the memorial is embodied in the
group named "Sacrifice," to stand within the Well of
Contemplation.
Borne aloft by women, on whose shoulders the
war placed the burden of sacrifice equally with the
men, is the outspread body of a soldier, lying on a
shield with the back of his head cupped in a woman's
upraised hand. His arms fall back over a sword in an
attitude suggesting crucifixion.
Looking down with bowed head from a circular
gallery beneath the domed interior of the building,
the visitor will see chiefly the recumbent form with
shield and sword. Standing at the base the figures of
the women, with draperies flowing into the fluted
form of a column will be seen, from either viewpoint
the symbolism of the group being complete.

SKETCH DESIGN
The sculptor has sought to set forth the great
burden of sacrifice, pain, horror and annihilation
laid on the youthful manhood of the Nation, to
typify also the spirit of those thousands of women
not directly engaged in the war who lost sons they
had borne and reared, husbands, friends and lovers.
Semi-circular steps will lead up to the northern
and southern entrances of the Great Memorial Hall.
Access, gained from the east and west, will be by
massive doors of maple and bronze.
Buttresses surmounted by sculpture will provide
sheer, strong, upward lines to each facade, and the
high walls of granite will terminate with horizontal
stepping at the apex.
The architect's conception provides for a lake,
160 feet long and 60 feet wide, lined with poplars,
on the northern approach to the memorial. On the

centre of the southern approach cascading waters,
60 feet wide, will run for 180 feet. Flanders poppies
are to be planted in beds surrounding the memorial,
and other flowers and foliage similar to that with
which Australian soldiers were familiar will be
introdmed in order that Nature may assist the sym-
bolism. The intention is that the approaches shall
induce thoughts in harmony with the dignity and
beauty of the memorial, and attuned to its meaning.
I The complete design calls for the presence of
two further groups of statuary, placed respectively
on the eastern and western facades of the building.
On the former will be "The Crucifixion of Civilisa-
tion, 1914," wherein the figure of Peace is shown
with the body armour, shield and helmet of Mars the
War God. At her feet lies the human and material
wreckage of war.


"Victory After Sacrifice, 1918," is composed of a
young woman with arms upraised, symbolical of
Australia, in front of a figure of Britannia, repre-
senting the Empire bearing a sheathed sword,
emblematical of the cessation of hostilities. Below
are the dead, who, in dying, made victory possible.
Sufficient money for the completion of these two
groups is not immediately available, but it is hoped
that they can be incorporated before the completion
of building operations in July of next year.
Two bronze reliefs over the lower entrance door-
ways, each 32 feet long by 4 feet 6 inches high, show
units of the Australian fighting forces on the Western
Front and in the eastern campaigns. Four angle
reliefs will typify naval, air force, infantry, and
medical and nursing units.
At each angle of the building, 85 feet above the
ground level, will stand four figures typical of the
main branches of war service, namely, a Commander
of a torpedo-boat destroyer; Matron of the Australian
Nursing Service; Lieutenant of an infantry battalion
and a Flying Officer.
Sixty-five feet from the ground, surmounting
buttresses, will be sixteen seated figures, each seven
feet high, and modelled in stone to match the facades,
representative of the Australian forces at war.

Four reliefs in the Hall of Memory will represent
typical units of other arms of the forces, tired by their
war efforts but grimly enduring. Directly behind
them are arranged lines of crosses, suggestive of the
many war graves overseas. In slight relief from the
background is shown the march of the dead continu-
ing from one panel to thenext around the Great Hall.
The interior of the Hall of Memory will be 50
feet in diameter and 95 feet to the top of the dome.
Windows have been designed so that the interior
will be suffused with a light in keeping with its sacred
character.
This memorial, now being erected, will be 100
feet high, 150 feet long and 95 feet broad. It will be
faced in tooled light-red granite and will have an
interior of white marble.


CHITECT
ARCHITECT
The proportion of planes and units of the com-
position and the play of light and shade have been
designed to produce a complete architectural mass
of distinction.
The design was chosen from among 116 others
submitted by Australian architects throughout the
world, by the assessors, Professor Leslie Wilkinson,
Dean of the Faculty of Architecture, University of
Sydney; and Professor A. S. Hook, and the Public
Trustee, Mr. E. J. Payne.
The materials used in the construction will be
Australian —The white marble for the interior from
quarries near Bathhurst, and the granite for the
exterior from Tarana.
