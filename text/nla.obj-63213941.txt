Notes on Plants, Collected by Mu. Edw. Reader, in the
vicinity oe Mount Dromedary.
By Baron Eerd. yon Mueller, K.C.M.G., M.D., F.E,S.
Since 1860, when I examined the vegetation on the Genoa, we
were aware, that a multitude of Plants known to advance south-
ward to Illawarra, did not extend into even the most south-eastern
part of Gippsland, though many other plants were known hy mo
to reach so far south. Thus we remained in uncertainty, where

the bulk of the peculiar vegetation of the Blue Mountains and
the Hlawarra District really reached its most southern termination
until last autumn. Mr. Edward Eeader, a resident near Mount
Dromedary, became induced to gather the plants of his vicinity
with a view of tracing the southern limits of the more northern
Plants of New South Wales. This he did with a disinterested
zeal and energetic toil, which are beyond all praise. The series
of species never before found so far south, is already sufficiently
advanced to offer it for publication ; though during the spring
months many other, particularly herbaceous Plants, would likely
be added, if search in his district could be continued.
Mr. Eeader, who was formerly in scientific correspondence with
the Eev. W. B. Clarke, defines the geologic formations of the
Mount Dromedary country as consisting of granite, coarse grits,
and conglomerate of comparatively recent date, resting on
Silurian slates, intersected with dikes of porphyry. The moun-
tainous nature of the district, as well as the multitude of water-
courses which flow through it, must render the Flora there
eminently rich, especially as also some tracts of heathy land exist
there; and we thus derive much additional information particularly
of geographic interest concerning the flora of the district.
The species, for which already far more southern localities can
be recorded, are the following :

To these must be added still, tantalum ohtusifolium, E. Brown,
but this one has been traced also into the colony of Victoria,
where Mr. Eeader found it very sparingly on the Genoa. It may
be added that he found Ehretia acuminata and Marsdenia flavescens,
within about thirty miles of the boundary-line, and that he noticed
Eucalyptus maculata, and Macrozamia spiralis, within a few miles
of Twofold Bay. Eucryphia Moorei, was traced into Victorian
territory before by Mr. C. H. Walter.
Among the Plants shown for the first time to be natives of New
South Wales by Mr. Eeader?s collections, are : ? Acaciasupporosa,
F.v.M., Aster axillaris, F.v.M., and Lepidosperrna elatius, of
Labillardiere; these were obtained near Mount Dromedary. He
learnt also that Livistona australis, occurs in the coast-gullies
south of Eden.
Eucalypts of the County of Cumberland : their classification,
HABITAT, AND USES.
By the Eev. Dr. Woolls, D.D., F.L.S., &c.
Now that, through the labours of Baron F. von Mueller, the
species of Eucalyptus occurring in the County of Cumberland
have, for the most part, been accurately defined, it may be useful
to arrange them according to the peculiar features which they
present, and to place on record such particulars respecting them
as may lead to more accurate investigation of their properties
and uses.


Although the Colony of New South Wales has been established
ninety two years, it is only since the publication of the Baron?s
Eucalyptographia, that some of the commonest species have been
identified, and referred to their proper places in the systematic
arrangement. The descriptions in the third volume of the Flora
Australiensis, founded on specimens forwarded to Europe from
time to time since the establishment of the Colony, afford indeed
a most valuable basis for the study of the genus, and the greatest
credit is due to Mr. Gr. Bentham, C.M.GK, for the manner in
which he has thrown together the researches of all previous
writers on our Eucalypts. That eminent Botanist, however,
notwithstanding all the information which he was enabled to
collect, had many difficulties to contend with, for, not having the
advantage of seeing the trees in their native forests, or having
any means of distinguishing the species, excepting from the dry
material before him and the imperfect notes of collectors, ?he
was compelled,? he tells us, ?to establish groups upon such
characters as appeared to him the most constant among those
which were supplied by the specimens.? The labours of Mr.
Bentham in thus dealing with some 135 species are beyond all
praise, and whether the artificial mode of classification which he
elaborated be ultimately adopted or not, we cannot but admire
the patient investigation and powers of organization which he
has exhibited. With that candour, however, which characterises
great minds, Mr. Bentham acknowledged his inability to devise
any system of classification which is not liable to objection ; and
therefore, whilst regarding the series, suggested by himself, as
simply provisional, he expresses a hope, that Baron Mueller may
be able to give to the Scientific world ? a truly natural arrange-
ment founded upon the proposed cortical or any other system,
which experience may induce him to adopt.? In the work now
in course of publication; the Baron is simply figuring and
describing species, and collecting all such information respecting
them, as may be useful in a scientific or industrial point of view;


and whilst he brings out fully in sectional and magnified drawings
the figure and opening of the anthers, for the purpose of
illustrating Mr. Bentham?s artificial system, he also furnishes
data, partly from his own observations, and partly from those of
his correspondents in Australia, for grouping the species according
to the nature of their bark.
Of the species now known in Australia ?probably about 150 ?28
are indigenous in the County of Cumberland, and, according to
the artificial system, they may be placed in the following order :
(I.) Benantherce, that is such species as have for the most part,
perfect anthers of a uniform shape, viz.
1. E. radiata, (Sieb.)
2. E. obtusidora, (DC.)
3. E. capitella, (Sm.)
4. E. eugenioides, (Sieb.)
5. E. piperita, (Sm.)
6. E. pilularis, (Sm.)
7. E, acmenoides, (Schan.)
(2.) Heterostemones, such as have the outer stamens ananther-
ous, whilst the perfect ones are small, globular, or truncate, viz.
1. E. sideroxylon, var. of E. 3. E. Ticemastoma, (Sm.)
leucoxylon, (F.v.M.) 4. E, Sieberiana, (F.v.M.)
2. E.paniculata, { Sm.)
(3.) Porantherce, such as have the stamens all perfect, and the
anthers small and globular, opening in small circular pores, viz.
1. E. polyanthema, (Schau.) 3. E. hemiphloia, (F.v.M.)
2. E. largijlorens, (F.v.M.)
(4.) Micrantherce, such as have the anthers very small, opening
in lateral slits, viz.
1. E. siderophloia, (Benth.) 3. E. crebra, (F.v.M.)
2. E. sp. ? (F.v.M.)
(5.) Normales , such as have the stamens all perfect, the anthers
oblong-ovate, or nearly globular, the cells perfectly distinct,
parallel and opening longitudinally, viz.


1. E. longifolia, (Link & Otto.)
2. E. robusta, (Sm.)
3. E. botryoides, (Sm.)
4. E. viminalis, (Labill.)
5. E. tereticornis, (Sm.)
6. E. punctata, (DC.)
7. E. saligna, (Sm.)
8. E. resinifera, (Sm.)
9. E. corymbosa , (Sm.)
10. E. maculata, (Hook.)
11. E. eximia, (Schau.)
This system o� grouping the species has its merit in the
arrangement o� specimens for the herbarium, and also in enabling
the observer to identify any species which is remarkable for the
shape or opening o� its anthers ; but it labours under two defects,
viz., that it places in close proximity trees differing materially in
bark, wood, and fruit; and that it sometimes separates widely
those species, which, in the minds of the Colonists, must ever be
associated with each other.
The cortical system of Baron Mueller, therefore, is the more
natural and practical, and although in individual trees, the bark
may differ sometimes from the typical character of the section
in which it is placed, yet there is little difficulty in determining,
from a comparison of several trees, whether a species should be
grouped with the smooth-barked, half-barked, or fully barked
kinds. Solitary specimens of the common G-rey Gfum (E.
tereticornis ,) have sometimes been found with fibrous bark on the
butt; and, on the other hand, the Box (E. hemiphlora) and the
Woolly Butt ( E. longifolia ) vary occasionally from the ordinary
type in proportion to their age and the nature of the soil. The
Blue' Gum also (E. saligna) , which, for the most part, has very
smooth bark, is found here and there with rough bark on the butt.
Baron Mueller in taking an extensive view of specimens from
all parts of Australia, is disposed to amalgamate species differing
very much in the character of the bark, and he refers the aberra-
tions from typical form to geological considerations, the elevation
above the sea-level, and the range of temperature. The deviations,
to which I refer, are in some instances very remarkable, and


should they be proved to result from local causes, as that learned
writer suggests, many of the so-called species of Eucalypts will
be regarded as mere varieties. As it would be premature to enter
upon this question, until a patient investigation of all the known
species has demonstrated the value of Mr. Bentham?s artificial
system, I propose to group the species of the County of Cumber-
land according to the cortical system of the Baron, and then to
treat of them individually.
(1.) Leio'phloice, such as have the bark smooth on every side,
after the shedding of the outer layer, including the trees commonly
called Blooded Gum-trees, White Gum-trees, or Gum-trees in
general. This section is well-defined and comprises about a third
of the Eucalypts in the County of Cumberland,
(2.) iLemiphloice, such as have the bark in the lower part of
the trunk, persistent, wrinkled, and full of clefts, in the upper
part and in the branches, rendered smooth by the shedding of the
outward layer. The common Box and Black-butt may be regarded
as typical of this section, but, as it will be seen in the process of
inquiry, some species pass from the HemipUoice to the Leioplloice
as they advance in age.
(3.) Ehytiphloice, such as have the bark everywhere persistent
wrinkled, full of clefts, and solid within, as the trees called
Mahogany and Bloodwood, including some of the largest trees
in the neigbourhood of Sydney.
(4). Pachyphloia, such as have the bark for the most part
persistent, wrinkled, and fibrous within. Of this section, the
Stringy Bark is the type.
(5.) Schizophloice, such as have the bark everywhere persistent
deeply furrowed, and solid within. This section comprises all
the Iron Barks.
According to this system, the species of the County of
Cumberland will stand in the following order:


(Section 1., Leiophloi^:.)
1. E. radiata, (Sieb.)
2. E. saligna, (Sm.)
5. E. tereticornis , (Sm.)
6. E. punctata, (DO.)
7. E. maculata, (Hook.)
8. E. obtusiflora, (DO.)
3. E. hcemastoma, (Sm.) and
var. E. micrantha (DC.)
4. E. viminalis, (Labill.)
(Section 11., Hemiphloij:.)
4. E. longifolia, (Link & Otto.)
5. E. largiflorens, (F.y.M.)
1. E. Sieberiana, (F.y.M.)
2. E. pilularis, (Sm.)
3. E. hmiphloia, (F.y.M.)
(Section 111., Rhttiphloi^:.)
1. E. acmenoides, (Scbau.) 5. E. corymbosa, (Sm.)
2. E. hotryoides, (Sm.) 6. E. eximia, (Schau.)
3. E. rohusta, (Sm.) 7. E.polyanthema, (Schau.)
4. E. resinifera, (Sm.)
(Section IY., PACHTPHLOiiE.)
1. E. capitella, (Sm.) 3. E. piperita, (Sm.)
2. E. eugenioides, (Sieb.)
(Section V., SmzoPHLOiiE.)
1. E. sideropUoia, (Benth.) 4. E. paniculata, (Sm.) and var.
2. E. sp. ? (F.y.M.) angustifolia, (Benth.)
3. E. crebra, (F.y.M.) 5. E. leucoxylon, (F.y.M.) var.
sideroxylon, (Sieb.)
With one exception,(viz. E. obtusijlora ) all the species mentioned
in this list are trees, but, it may be remarked, that none of them
attain the gigantic dimensions of E. amygdalina, (the ? Griant
Eucalypt ? of Victoria), or E. diversicolor, (the ?Karri? of
Western Australia), which, in favourable localities, are known to
have exceeded 400 feet in height, with a diameter of 25 feet. It
is probable that no Eucalypt in the County of Cumberland
exceeds 160 feet, whilst the fruit of all the species is comparatively
small, even in the largest trees. The fruit of E. Youngiana,


(F.v.M.,) in South Australia sometimes exceeds two inches in
diameter, which is about four times that of E. longifolia , or our
common Woolly Butt, a species remarkable amongst the Eucalypts
of New South Wales for the size and thickness of its seed-vessel.

Anthias longimanus, Gunther.
Anthias longimanus, Gunth., Cat. Fishes, Yol. 1., p. 94,
D. 10/20. A. 3/8. Y. 1/5.
As this fish is apparently new to our waters, the following
notes may be of interest to the Society :
The horizontal diameter of the eye is one-fourth of the length
of the head, and equal to its distance from the snout. The height
of the body is one-third of the length, exclusive of the caudal fin,
the length of the head is three times and two-thirds in the same.
Snout very short, mouth oblique; the maxillary reaches to below
the anterior third of the eye. The prseoperculum is finely serrated
on both limbs and rounded at the angle ; the operculum has a flat
spine at its upper angle, and a smaller flat spine below it with a
denticulated margin. The dorsal fin is low, the third spine the
longest, the membranes connecting the spines and rays are clothed
with scales for two-thirds of their height; the pectorals are long,
narrow, of twenty rays, much longer than the head, and reach to
the fourth dorsal ray, and first anal spine ; the anal is moderate,
its tip reaching to the vertical from the last dorsal ray; the
ventrals are inserted just behind the vertical from the base of
the pectorals, and are a little longer than half their length. The
lateral line terminates about six or seven scales from the base of
the tail, the upper lobe of which is the longest. The space
