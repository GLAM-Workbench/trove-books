Does Aysiraita Stand For This ?
The Case of Father Jerger
Call to lovers of Freedom on behalf of a Wronged Man
Denied by the Commonwealth Government,
which has acted throughout in the most vindictive
manner, the right of a fair trial?the privilege of
even the greatest criminal?-I desire to place before
the people of Australia some facts in connection
with rny case. By the time this statement reaches
the puolic I will be on my way overseas?forcibly
torn from my home and people and sent away?
God knows where. I blame not Australia, the land
of my adoption. Australians are not unkind; they
are too brave to descend to the barbarity of wild
savages. Whatever-may be my fate, I will never
utter a hard word against the great young Com-
monwealth. My prayers, whatever they are worth,
will always be for the country and her people.
Australia?s present rulers do not speak for the
nation?s freedom-loving citizens. Those in autho-
lity are neither Australian in birth nor in spirit.
Tley are usurpers, violaters of the rights of the
people, and as such should be hurled from the posi-
ticns they debase. Farewell, fellow-Australians.
CHARLES JERGER.
July 10, 1920.
? I am known as Father Charles Jerger?a name
qvhich has been prominently before the Australian
people. To the Australian people I speak. They
constitute the High Court of my appeal. They have
a right to know the facts. In Australia, the father-
land of my adoption, I have spent the best years
and the most years of my life. Its laws I have ever
obeyed. If I have not obeyed them, then, before
Judge and Jury of twelve Australian citizens, I
demand to be. charged and tried. lam conscious of
no offence, and I liberty, unconditional
and unrestrained.
" Over thirty-three years have I laboured in this
land?a land kind and generous to me and mine.
Its people have been my,people; its welfare my
own. At peace with all men, I laboured at my
appointed task till 1918. On February 15, 1918, I
was summoned to appear in the Intelligence Office,
Victoria Barracks. I was arrested, without warrant
and without charge, and without trial cast behind-
the barbed wires at Holdsworthy. A warrant,
signed by George Pearce, was shown me about one
month later. A charge I have, to this day, July 10,
not vet heard. A trial I have not yet had.
? Two and a half years I lay imprisoned, and
what transpired behind those barbed wires at Holds-
worthy has yet to be told. It is a tale of horror.
What I saw in that lager?the dreadful, cheerless
sheds; the herding together of different ages-and
men from different spheres of life, the wretched
starvation rations, the insufficient blankets and
clothing, the habitual and wanton cruelty 'of those
in charge, the brutal language, the influenza
epidemic, and the last day of the strike. March 1,
1919, when 4300 men, rendered stupid and -resentful
by being deprived of bread for five days, of meat
for three days, and at times of water, were sur-
rounded by 1000 armed men, with machine guns
and artillery, ready and loaded to fire. These thijigs
I saw, and can never forget. To these things. 4100
others in the Main Compound were condemned for
periods of from two and a half to five and a llalf
years. No man among us saw a warrant until. a
month or two had elapsed. No man to this day ever
has had a trial.
? It is true that the Government sent two Boards
the Alien?s Board, about May, 1919, and the
Release Board; in August, 1919. The Alien?s Board
consisted of six magistrates sitting one in each of
six tents, one tent for each State. Each internee
desirous of remaining in Australia, only such being
called, went into the tent of his own State. They
were asked the same questions?Name? When
born? Where born? Occupation? Single or mar-
ried? What sympathy with the Allies? What
chance of employment if released? This magistrate

gence Section in my regard were?
1(1) Not to leave me out of sight. In carrying
this out, some of the men at first followed
me into the lavatory, and, tp avoid further
indignity, I had to confine all exercise to
an 18-foot verandah, pa-cing to and fro.
? (3) To see that no one saw me or spoke to me
without a pass. (Dr. Hayden, Bishop of
Wilcannia, was refused admittance.)
1(3) Not to leave the hospital grounds even
with a guard. Thus I could neither hear
nor celebrate Holy Mass. After about ten
days this was overcome by the Medical
Superintendent placing at my disposal the
only room he had ?a small, dark, dingy
little room under the staircase of the main
building. Thanks to the Medical Superin-
tendent, I could celebrate Mass; but,
thanks to the Intelligence Staff, I had to
celebrate under conditions so unfitting.
After leaving the Camp, I had to report at the
Victoria Barracks every Tuesday. One week I
reported on a Monday to the local police, and a
fey days later my sister rang up Major Lloyd, of
the Intelligence Staff. I deemed this sufficient for
the week, but was promptly wired for, and, though
satisfactorily explained, yet, to my surprise, it was

Robert Garran, showing how hard pressed the
military were to find a pretence for some charge.
j: Now, I want to know who is responsible for
orders so unnecessarily brutal? What object is to
beattained by this savagery? I am not a prisoner
of war. By the Hague Convention, ?No Minister
of Religion or Medical Man can be made a prisoner
of war.? By what law, in times of peace, am I
subjected to this disgraceful and disgusting super-
vision ?
Even the vilest criminal, in the vilest gaol, can-
ncjt be additionally punished without the proven
breach of a prison rule before the Governor or a
visiting magistrate. If this be so for a criminal,
car a prisoner of war, guilty of no offence, or an
innocent citizen and Minister of Religion, be fur-
ther maltreated? Do the Australian people approve
and countenance such actions in their name?
" While in Darlinghurst Gaol I was treated like
a common burglar, and given the same accommoda-
tion, same food and same exercise, notwithstanding
what the Military may say.
