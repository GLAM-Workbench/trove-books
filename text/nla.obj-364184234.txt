ORDER OF SERVICE
HYMN
Nearer, my Cod, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee!
E’en though it be a cross
That raiseth me:
Still all my song would be,
“Nearer, my Cod, to Thee, —
Nearer to Thee!’’
Though, like the wanderer,
The sun gone down,
Darkness be over me.
My rest a stone;
Yet in my dreams I’d be
Nearer, my Cod, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee!
ADDRESS
Pastor LACE TYREUS.
HYMN
Abide with me; fast falls the eventide;
The darkness deepens, Lord with me abide!
When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, O abide with me.
ADDRESS
Mr. BO ALANDER, Charge d’Affaires
of Sweden.


SOLO
Creation’s Hymn Beethoven
Mr. FRANK LISLE.
HYMN
A safe stronghold our Cod is still,
A trusty shield and weapon;
He’ll help us clear from all the ill
1 hat hath us now o’ertaken.
The ancient prince of hell
Hath risen with purpose fell;
Strong mail of craft and power
He weareth in this hour;
On earth is not his fellow.
With force of arms we nothing can
Full soon were we down-ridden
But for us fights the proper Man,
Whom God himself hath bidden.
Ask ye, Who is this same?
Christ Jesus is his name,
The Lord Sabbath’s Son;
He, and no other one,
Shall conquer in the battle.
L'fany Schubert
Funeral March Beethoven
