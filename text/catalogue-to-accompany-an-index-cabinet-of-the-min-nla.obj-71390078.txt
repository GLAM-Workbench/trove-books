PREFACE.
THE MINERAL WEALTH OF TASMANIA.
Gold.
Minerals are distributed profusely throughout the whole Island of
Tasmania, but it is within very recent years that they have attracted
attention. The existence of gold has been known since the year
1852, but it is only within the past ten years that gold mining has
been practically carried on. In the early days of Australian gold
mining the Government rather discouraged attempts to mine for
gold in this Colony; but in the year 1863 an Act was passed to
secure the payment of a reward of not more than �5OOO to any
person discovering a payable gold field in Tasmania (Act 26 Viet.
No. 6). The conditions were left to be fixed by the Governor
in Council by Regulations, which prescribed a graduated scale of
rewards for certain results, the gold fields not to be within four
miles of each other. There are now several applicants for the
rewards, whose claims are about to be decided by arbitrators to be
appointed under the third clause of the Act. A description of the
Gold Fields of Tasmania by Mr. Bernard Shaw, Commissioner of
Gold Fields (who also arranged the specimens in the Cabinet), will
be found at the end of the Mineral Catalogue. (Appendix A.)
The exhibit of alluvial gold in the Mineral Cabinet contains
samples from all parts of the Colony, and illustrates the great
variety of the metal found in Tasmania, both as regards value and
form. The sample from the Nine Mile Springs Gold Field repre-
sents gold which has realised the highest price, �4 3s. 10rf., and
that from the Denison the lowest, �2 12s. an ounce; whilst
samples of every intermediate value are to be found in the collection.
The exhibit of auriferous quartz and gold from quartz also
contains specimens from all parts of the Colony, and shows the


same variety. Gold from the reefs at Nine Mile Springs has
realised as much as �4 3s. 10c?. an ounce, and some from the
Waterhouse reefs only �2 17$.
The average value of gold from the different localities is as
follows: ? _ y

The New Chum Company at Nine Mile Springs has, within a
very few months, paid dividends amounting to �17,500.
Iron.
Iron was the next mineral which attracted attention, although
its existence was known more than half a century ago..
Soon after the first settlement of Europeans at York Town, the
immense deposits of iron ore on Anderson?s Creek, which flows
into West Arm, on the Tamar, attracted attention; and early in the
present century Lieut.-Governor Collins forwarded a quantity of it
to England, but what became of it is not known. Mr. Surveyor-
General Evans, writing in 1822, also called attention to the ? sur-
prising abundance of iron ? on the River Tamar.
In 1872 a company was formed in Melbourne to work the
deposits above referred to, and about �BO,OOO were expended, when
operations came to a stand-still through a very unforeseen circum-
stance. The furnace and machinery worked exceedingly well, and
large quantities of pig iron were manufactured, but it was soon
evident that it was of a quality too hard for ordinary foundry pur-
poses. This was a serious disappointment; and, as the result of
numerous analyses, it was discovered that all the metal was more or
less impregnated with chromium, a mineral which had the effect of
making the cast-iron hard, and, to a certain extent, brittle. In the
numerous chemical analyses of the various ores found on the com-
pany?s property prior to commencing operations, only one referred
to chromium as being present in the ore, and then the report only
mentioned a trace. As the mine was opened out, however, it
became evident that this mineral was present in small but ever-
varying quantities, and nearly all the pig iron made contained it in
the ratio of from 2 to 6 per cent. We need not indulge in any
scientific details. It is sufficient to say that chromic pig iron was
regarded as an entirely new product, and was not appreciated. It
was comparatively unsaleable in the market, excepting for mixing
purposes.
Other companies were also formed for working various iron
deposits on the Tamar and North West Coast, but so far none of
these speculations have proved successful, although a large amount
of capital has been invested,


Tin.
For many years past it has been known that Tasmania con-
tained stanniferous deposits. Samples of stream tin have been
found from time to time, but no regular search was made until Mr.
James Smith, a settler at the River Forth, took the matter in hand.
He pushed his way to Mount Bischoff, where he discovered the
enormous tin deposits which are destined yet to make a great name
for Tasmania. The matrix in which the tin ore is found is a sort of
? euritic granite? or ?quartz porphyry,? and of this Mount Bischoff
seems to be more or less composed. The ore occurs in veins or
bunches running through the porphyry, and also in the form of
<? stream tin,? the detritus of those veins dispersed through the sur-
face drift. This ?stream tin? is totally different in appearance
from the well-known ruby tin of New South Wales and Queensland
and the eastern coast of Tasmania. It is simply disintegrated lode
ore, and evidently has not travelled far, as the crystals are very
angular, and solid nuggets are found in the drift varying in weight
from a few grains to over a hundredweight. After an unsuccessful
attempt to induce Victorians to interest themselves in Mr. Smith?s
discovery, the Mount Bischoff Tin Mining Company was formed in
Launceston in 1873, and is now obtaining tin ore at the rate of from
200 to 250 tons per month. The company has a very extensive
establishment and plant, and in the crushing and dressing sheds are
all the latest and most scientific appliances for the treatment of tin
ore. They have a considerable length of tramway connecting the
mine with the washing sheds, the township, &c. The quality of the
washdirt is various, yielding as high as 56 per cent, of tin ore,
which at the smelting works gives from 50 to 75 per cent, of pure
tin in the ingot. Since the formation of the company, 9739 tons tin
ore have been obtained from the mine, and the produce of the first
six months of 1880 was 1050 tons. During the same period the
company?s smelting works at Launceston turned out 818 tons of tin
ingots. The shares, which were originally �5 each, of which 255.
per share has been called up, have been sold recently in Launceston
at from �4l to �42 per share.
In the year 1874-5 some valuable tin discoveries were made
on the East Coast of Tasmania, especially in the neighbourhood of

George?s Bay and the Boobyalla River. Over a very large area a
stanniferous drift was discovered, yielding very rich prospects.
This stream tin was of the ruby kind, very similar to that found at
Vegetable Creek in New South Wales, and also in several parts of
Queensland. An immense area of land has been taken up under
the mineral regulations, and many companies are now at work and
doing well.
Besides the Districts above mentioned, some very rich deposits
of tin ore have been found at Mount Ramsay, a mountain about 12
miles south of Mount Bischoff. A large number of claims have
been taken up under lease, and will no doubt be worked so soon as
tracks can be cut to them. We may state, in fact, that tin has been
found over the whole of the country, extending from a line drawn
due west from Mount Bischoff to the coast as far south as Port
Davey. The tin mines of Tasmania are, in fact, as yet only in their
infancy, and are destined to astonish the world. The progress made
will be best understood by the following table. Prior to the year
1874 the metal ?tin? had not appeared in our Statistics. Since then
the exports to the close of 1879 have been as under :
Value.
The Tin Trophy erected in the Tasmanian Court shows the
quality of the metal produced, while the handsome ornament sur-
mounting the Mineral Cabinet exhibits some ol the fantastic shapes
assumed by the molten metal which escapes from the furnaces, and
has been specially constructed from such ?drips? under the super-
vision of Mr. W. L. Jenkin, the Manager of the Mount Bischoff
Company?s Works.


Copper.
Indications of copper lodes have been discovered in various
parts of Tasmania, particularly at Mount Maurice, to the eastward
of Launceston; and at Badger Head on the Northern Coast. At
the latter place a company was for some time engaged prospecting
for a lode, and a large amount of money was expended in machinery
and mining operations, but without success. The enterprise has
been abandoned for the present.
Silver.
Silver ore of various kinds are common in Tasmania, but as yet
they have attracted very little attention. The opening up of the
mineral country in the neighbourhood of Mounts Bischotf and
Ramsay, however, will probably reveal some rich deposits of this
metal. Already several veins of galena, rich in silver, have been
struck in the vicinity of the tin mines of Mount Bischoff, besides a
considerable vein of antimonial lead, which will probably yield
silver. A company to work this mine is now in process of formation.
Near Mount Ramsay a very large deposit of stone has been
found, containing traces of both silver and copper; and at the
Hellyer River also some ores have been found, giving very pro-
mising indications. As yet this country has been very little
explored. It is all densely scrubbed and difficult of access, but, as
the tin mining advances, attention will be directed to it, tracks will
be cut, and its riches brought to light.
The only locality in which silver ore has been worked in Tas-
mania is Penguin Creek, and here, about a mile from the shipping-
place, and close to the water, is the property of the Penguin Silver
Mines Company. This company was formed in 1870 to work a
mineral lease of 80 acres, on which had been found a vein containing
silver, cobalt, nickel, and copper. The company was projected with
a nominal capital of �60,000, in shares of 20s. each. Of these,
45,000, paid up to 12s. Gd., were reserved ?for the purchase of the
property,? and 15,000 were offered to the public?2s. Gd. to be paid
on allotment, and subsequent calls not to exceed Is. per month. The
shares thus offered were readily taken up by a number of small


holders; but the management was bad, the subscribed capital soon
became exhausted, and after a month?s working operations were
stopped. The company was wound up in August, 1874. The pros-
pects of the mine were exceedingly good. Mr. J. Cosmo New-
berry, of Melbourne, assayed specimens of ores in 1870, and found
that ? the amount of mixed arsenides and sulphides was equal to
16 per cent., which contained 15 per cent, of copper, 6 per cent,
cobalt, 3 per cent, nickel, and an amount of silver equal to 38 ozs.
10 dwts. 4 grs. per ton.
Bismuth.
One of the most valuable mineral discoveries yet made in Tas-
mania is that of a lode carrying bismuth in large proportions, which
was found in 1873 by Mr. Charles H. Gould, formerly Government
Geologist, and the late Mr. J. R. Scott. The explorers came upon
indications of a lode containing quantities of this mineral, accom-
panied by tungstate of lime or sheelite, but chiefly in a matrix of
dark-coloured hornblende. They also found the metal associated
with arsenical pyrites. It was chiefly found, however, in the form of
crystals in the gangue, and easily separated by crushing and
washing. The lode has been found a chain and a half wide in some
places, and it has been traced a considerable distance. As far as can
be judged, the lode would yield all through about 7 per cent, of
metallic bismuth, which, not long since, would have been worth from
�lOOO to �l2OO per ton. Professor George H. Ulrich, F.G.S., of
Melbourne, visited and reported upon this lode in February, 1876,
and made some careful calculations as to its extent and value. He
described it as ? a discovery representing to my knowledge one of,
if not the most important and richest made of this rare metal in
recent times.? The bismuth lode is now the property of a Hobart
Town company, and no doubt its riches will be fully developed when
the means of communication are available.
Serpentine.
One of the most interesting features of the country in the
neighbourhood of the iron mines at the mouth of the River Tamar
is the serpentine, which exists there in very extensive deposits. On
the property of the British and Tasmanian Charcoal Iron Com-


pany, at Anderson?s Creek, there is a regular bed of this stone,
which has been partially opened as a quarry, the material being
used for building rough foundations, &c. Some of the blocks have
been found to take a high polish, and many beautiful ornaments
have been made from the stone?crosses, ear-drops, charms, &c.
Varieties of the stone are found in the quarry, some of it being of a
beautiful leek-green colour, resembling the New Zealand jade, but
of course not so hard; it is quite as lustrous, however, and keeps
its polish well. In crevices in the quarry fine specimens of horn-
blende are obtained, and frequent veins of iron embedded in asbestos.
On the eastern side of Anderson?s Creek good specimens of this
substance have been obtained. At a place known as ? The Settlers?
there are several very curious mounds of basaltic rock, and on the
flats beneath boulders of serpentine are found, through which
strings or veins of asbestos fibre run at regular intervals of an inch
or less. This fibre is very compact, and requires considerable
pressure to separate it. The bands vary from an eighth of an inch
or an inch or more in width, and having a bright silvery lustre, are
(in some specimens) very beautiful. It has not as yet been dis-
covered in sufficient quantity to render it of commercial value.
At the River Forth, on the North West Coast, a very extensive
deposit of green serpentine exists, rough and polished specimens of
which will be found in the Tasmanian Court. It has been partially
opened out as a quarry, and blocks large enough for building
purposes are now obtainable. It is well worthy the attention of
colonial architects and builders and of monumental stone workers.
Clays.
In connection with the development of the iron industry,
nothing is of more importance than an abundant supply of good
fire-clay, and also clays suitable for ordinary purposes. Surround-
ing the iron hills there are ample deposits. At Ilfracombe Bay
there is an extensive bed of a pure white clay which seems very
refractory, and which, when mixed with fine quartz (also abundant
and close at hand) forms an admirable firebrick. Brick clays are
found in all directions. Kaolin or porcelain clay is also found at
Circular Head, where there is said to be a very extensive deposit,
which will doubtless prove valuable ere long.


On the North and South coasts are found many valuable
coloured earths suitable for the manufacture of pigments; and at
Tam o? Shanter Bay, to the eastward of the River Tamar, a Mel-
bourne company is now procuring quantities of material which they
turn into paint of most excellent quality, samples of which will no
doubt be found in the Exhibition.
Limestones.
Good fluxes are most essential in all furnace operations, and
these fortunately abound in close proximity to most of our mineral
deposits. In the West Tamar districts limestone quarries have been
worked for many years past, shell lime, carbonate of lime (almost a
marble), and ordinary blue mountain limestone being found in large
quantities. There is an immense mountain of blue limestone
situated about two miles from the township of Latrobe, on the
River Mersey, which was leased by some Victorian speculators with
a view to the manufacture of cement. The enterprise did not turn
out a success.
At Bridgewater, Limestone quarries have been in payable opera-
tion for many years.
At the River Don there are very large deposits of pure car-
bonate of lime, and the eastern and southern districts, especially
Fingal, abound with lime of various kinds and qualities.
Coal.
Coal is very widely disseminated throughout Tasmania, especially
along the North West, Eastern, and Southern coasts, where, in
certain localities, it has been, and now is, extensively worked. The
principal coal measures of the North West Coast are at the River
Don and on the River Mersey at Latrobe, and surrounding dis-
tricts. The mineral here is of a coarse bituminous quality, approach-
ing to the common slate coal of England. Launceston is partly
supplied with this coal. A mineral resembling coal has lately been
discovered on the eastern bank of the River Tamar, at a place called
Dilston, but it has not yet been opened out. Coal has been found
on the north-eastern corner of the Island near Waterhouse, but not


in payable seams; but going south, along the Eastern coast it is
found in considerable seams and of superior quality. In the Fingal
District especially, very superior coal exists, although, owing to the
difficulties of transit, little has been done to derelope it. In the
Mount Nicholas range there is a thickness of about 900 feet occu-
pied by the coal measures series, and containing seams of a very
rich bituminous coal (see specimen No. 217). This is associated
with variegated and speckled sandstones, with clays and shales.
The principal seams are within moderate distances of each other,
and they can be traced along the face of the ranges to the east of
Fingal township. Several offers have been made to Government to
work these deposits on condition of the construction of a rail or
tramway, but these have generally been declined on account of the
outlay required. At Ben Lomond, Avoca, and at the St. Paul?s
River extensive coal measures also exist, but likewise unworked.
The Douglas River Coal Company some years ago conducted
considerable operations on their property near Bicheno, on the East
Coast. There are numerous coal seams on this property, said to
vary from a few inches to as much as eight feet in thickness. The
seams are for the most part horizontal, and lie apparently in their
original position, especially when in the neighbourhood of the
granite and greenstone, but in the vicinity of more recent trappean
rocks there is considerable displacement, causing differences of level
and inclination. The coal is a good bituminous and partially coking
fuel, but seams of anthracite or stone coal have also been opened in
the vicinity. Clay ironstone is associated with the coal in this
quarter.
At Port Seymour, on the East Coast, extensive mining opera-
tions were also carried on about ten years ago, and the domestic
demand of Hobart Town was largely supplied from the Seymour
mines, two vessels being employed in the trade. Operations were
unprofitable, however, and have for some time been suspended.
The coal mines at Port Arthur, Tasman?s Peninsula, also helped to
supply Hobart Town with coal until the breaking up of the Penal
Establishment there.
The whole eastern coast line south of Falmouth is rich in coal,
which will no doubt shortly be turned to good account. Passing


inland, coal is found at various points south of Oatlands, and in' one
or two places it is being worked. At York Plains, on the Main
Line Railway, Mr. James Lord has opened a mine (see specimen
No. 214). At Jerusalem a mine has been at work for the past two
years, and the railway is largely supplied from it, the coal being of
excellent quality (see specimen No. 215). In the neighbourhood of
New Town, near Hobart Town, coal mines have been successfully
worked for many years.
Slate.
Among other useful minerals, slate is very common in Tas-
mania, but, so far, the efforts made to turn it to commercial account
have not been very profitable. Several companies have been formed,
and a large amount of money has been expended in the endeavour
to develope the slate quarries to the eastward of the River Tamar,
but, owing to the broken character of the country, these efforts
have not proved very satisfactory. Two companies, the Bangor
and Tasmanian Slate Quarry Companies, have had to suspend
operations after a large outlay. Another, the Australian Slate
Quarry Company, still prosecute their operations, but very little is
heard of the results.

THE CABINET.
This Cabinet was constructed to the order of the Tasmanian Royal
Commissioners for the Victorian Exhibition, 1880, by Mr. Peter
Mills, Builder, of Brisbane-street, Launceston, and it well represents
the value for cabinet purposes of the ornamental woods of the
Colony. It is of highly seasoned Blackwood (Acacia melanoxylon,
JBr.) The trees grow throughout the Island, but not abundantly in
any one locality. Their height is from 60 feet to 130 feet; diameter,
from \\ to 4 feet; average, about 2� feet; sp. grav. 'BB5. The
timber is sold at from 12s. to 14s. per 100 feet in the log, and is in
great request for the manufacture of furniture.
The headings are of polished Huon Pine (Dacrydium Franklinii,
Hook, fils.) This tree was first discovered on the banks of the Huon
River, Southern Tasmania, but is abundant in the south-western
parts of the Island. The height is from 50 to 120 feet; diameter,
3to 8 feet; average, about 4� feet; price, from 16s. per 100
superficial feet in the log. Largely used for furniture, especially
for bedroom suites.

it is a worthless substance, but in Cornwall it is regarded as
a favourable indication; the saying is that u Jack rode a
good horse,? which means that a rich deposit of the ore in
request may be expected to occur below the spinel.

Iron and Associated Minerals-
* 139. Earthen Brown Hematite Iron Ore from the Mine of the
British and Tasmanian Iron Company, Anderson?s Creek,
River Tamar. (Company?s Works at Port Lempriere,
West Arm, near the mouth of the river.)
Note. ?Many samples of the ores from the above mine have been assayed by
some of the most noted chemists and assayers, yielding from 60 to 69 per


cent. Metallic Iron. The Company, after spending over �BO,OOO in works and
mining operations, had to discontinue in consequence of the presence of
chromium in small but indefinite quantities throughout the mine. Out of a
great number of analyses made prior to commencing operations only two
mentioned the existence of this mineral. They were made by the assayer of
the North of England Hematite Iron Company?s Works at Workington in
Cumberland; one was as follows
9th August, 1873.
Ferric oxide 73*65
Ferrous oxide 15*73

This was a sample of Magnetic Iron Ore. The next analysis gave similar
results, but with chromium oxide to the extent of 0*96 per cent. The
chromium increased as the mine was opened up rendering the pig iron pro-
duced hard and (for the time) unsaleable.

294. Bismuth Ore from large lode at Mount Ramsay.
Note.? Professor Geo. H. F. Ulrich, F.G.S., reported upon the Bismuth
lode at Mount Ramsay in February, 1876, and his report was of the most
encouraging character. He described the deposit as composed ?of a coarsely
and finely crystalline-granular amphibolite or hornblende rock, more or less
densely impregnated with larger and smaller crystalline particles and
roundish pellets of native Bismuth, (see No. 296 in Cabinet) grains, crystals,
and small irregular patches of Arsenical pyrites (closely intermixed with
some Iron pyrites), further of Copper pyrites, Magnetic pyrites, Ilmenite
(hexagonal Titaniferous Iron), Scheelite (Tungstate of lime), Fluorspar,
carnet and, rarely, Axinite,? (a mineral composed chiefly of silica, alumina,
and lime). At the time of Mr. Ulrich?s visit the mine was not at all developed!
and he was unable to give any reliable opinion as to the extent or nature of
the formation whether ? lode, layer, stock, or other kind,? but he estimated
that the shoot in view ?would produce 6000 cubic feet of Metalliferous
Hornblende rock (like example No. 292 in Cabinet) equal to 666 tons in round
numbers, on reckoning 9 cubic feet per ton.? Taking this stone to contain
Bismuth it would represent nearly 20 tons of metal, which at
aii market price at the date mentioned) would give �20.000
AH the picked samples obtained from the mine have yielded from 7 to 10 per
Me . talllc Bismuth ; audit is somewhat strange that no practical steps
have been taken to develope so valuable a property.

331. Wolfram (Tungstate of Iron and Manganese) in Quartz from
Mount Bischoff. Exhibitor, Mr. W. L. Jenkin.
Note ?This Mineral is not very valuable, and being found in connection
with the Ores of Tin is the bane of Tin Smelters, as it largely diminishes the
ner-centage of metallic Tin obtained. It is composed of Tungstic Acid, the
Oxide of Manganese and Iron, with a little Silica. The separation of the
Wolfram is, however, now easily effected by Mr. Oxland?s process, which is
thus described : ?After crushing or otherwise pounding the mixed substances,
thev are roasted, and,?the Wolfram still remaining unaffected,?after again
washing, they are roasted with Carbonate of Soda, thus
Wolfram, and Tungstate of Soda being formed, the Tin Ore is then fitted for
further treatment in the smelting house.? (Sir H. T. De la Beche.) The
Tungstate of Soda is used as a mordant in dyeing, and also for making dress
stuffs incombustible.

Appendix A.
THE GOLD FIELDS OF TASMANIA.
[ Abridged from a Report by Mr. B. Shaw, Commissioner of Gold Fields.]
The existence of gold in Tasmania was ascertained early in 1852, almost
immediately after its discovery on the continent of Australia. The rich
auriferous drifts which at first attracted such numbers to Victoria and New
South Wales were not found in the Island, although gold in alluvial deposit
has been found in comparatively limited quantities in all quarters of the
Colony. After some unsuccessful attempts to establish mining in the
Fingal district, and at the Den, near Piper?s River, no effort to develope
our gold fields appears to have been made until 1869, when the discovery
of a quartz reef at Waterhouse led to the advent of some hundreds of
miners from the other colonies; and for some months a large extent of
country was prospected and numerous quartz reefs discovered. Consider-
able excitement and unwholesome speculation followed; but the reefs,
proving too poor to be remunerative, were generally abandoned. In
1870 richer alluvial deposits were discovered at Mathinna and Back Creek ;
but again the industry partially collapsed, and it was not until 1876 that
some rich yields from a reef opened at the Nine Mile Springs began to
attract attention, and gave an impetus to gold mining generally in dif-
ferent parts of the Colony, resulting in the establishment of the several
centres of mining now existing.
The gold of Tasmania varies greatly in quality, that from Nine Mile
Springs and Back Creek being the richest yet found in the Australias; and
some from Waterhouse and the Denison being the poorest, not worth more
than �2 12s. an ounce; whilst gold of all intermediate values has been
found.
An unlimited supply of timber of the best description for mining pur-
poses exists upon all the gold fields, and the supply of water is generally
abundant.
The greatest depth of sinking upon quartz has been reached at
Mathinna and the Nine Mile Springs, at both of which places it exceeds
600 feet. All alluvial gold hitherto found is in shallow deposit*

The following is a short description of the several gold fields in the
Colony :
Beaconsfield. ?On the west bank of the River Tamar, distant from
Launceston by road 25 miles, by river 30 miles. Steamers ply up and
down the river every day. There are numerous hotels and stores. Popu-
lation about 1200. There are numerous alluvial claims and several quartz
reefs. Amongst the latter the Tasmania reef has yielded since operations
commenced in July, 1878, �135,521 worth of gold. There is a large
deposit of brown conglomerate, locally termed cement, which when treated
in the ordinary battery yields from two pennyweights to half an ounce of
gold a ton. The country for several miles to the south and west of the
gold field is known to be auriferous; and at one spot?the Blue Tier ?4|
miles distant, several claims, both alluvial and quartz, have been taken up
recently, and are yielding very fair returns. It was here the largest nugget
yet found in Tasmania, weighing a pound and a half, was unearthed.
Nine Mile Springs.? On the east side of the Tamar, approached by
road 10 miles from George Town and 28 from Launceston. A coach twice
a week. Two excellent hotels and several stores. Population about 700.
There are several quartz reefs in full work, some yielding very handsome
returns.
Back Creek. ?Six miles north of Nine Mile Springs. Population
about 150. A quantity of alluvial gold was taken from this field in 1870,
and quite recently the industry has revived, some good leads having been
opened. Quartz reefs have been discovered, but have not yet been pro-
fitably worked.
Denison and Golconda. ?A reefing district, situate about 30 miles
from Launceston and 12 from Bridport, a harbour for small vessels, to
which two steamers trade regularly, and from which place there is a dray
road. Several reefs have been tested. There is one battery of 15 head of
stampers. Population about 200.


Waterhouse.? On the north-east coast, midway between Bridport and
Ringarooma Port, to both of which places steamers regularly ply. Several
auriferous quartz reefs have been discovered here.
Great Muscle Roe. ?On the north-east coast. Auriferous quartz
reefs are known to exist, but no attempt, beyond a little prospecting, has
been made to develope them.
Lisle. ?An alluvial gold field situate about 27 miles north cast of
Launceston, from which it is reached by a road. Gold was discovered in
January, 1879, since which time about 40,000 ounces have been procured.
The claims are principally in the valley of Bessell?s Rivulet, with the gold
in shallow deposit. A number of puddling machines are in use. At one
time the population exceeded 1500 : present population about 700.
Mount Barrow and Camden Plains.?A very large area of country
has been found to contain gold both in quartz and alluvial deposit, but in
no spot has it been found in sufficient quantity to attract much attention.
A few straggling miners and prospectors are employed. Distance by bush
track from Launceston, 30 miles.
Mount Horror and Boohyalla Plains.?A few miners are employed,
and although gold is known to exist in alluvial deposit for many miles
around, it has not been found sufficiently rich in any one place to encourage
more extended operations. Distance from Launceston about 55 miles.
Mathinna.? Situate 18 miles from Fingal, approached by an ordinary
bush road, was at one time the scene of actwe mining operations, and a
considerable quantity of gold in alluvial deposit was found. A few miners
only now remain. Numerous quartz reefs have been discovered, none of
which have exceeded an average degree of productiveness. One battery
has been working for some years.
Mangana . ?About five miles from Fingal. Several quartz reefs have
been taken up, and have proved more or less auriferous. One battery is in
full operation.
Scamander . ?On the East Coast several leases of auriferous reefs have
been taken up, but the discovery being a recent one no practical test has
yet been applied.
Devon and Wellington. ?ln the Counties of Devon and Wellington,
forming the north-western part of the Colony, gold has been found in


alluvial deposit, in quantities too small to attract any considerable number
of miners, at the Minnow River (a tributary of the Mersey), Mount Row-
land, the River Cam, Seabrook Rivulet, Table Cape, and at the ranges
about the River Hellyer. About 100 miners are scattered over the Dis-
trict, some obtaining very fair returns, and others prospecting. The
country is heavily timbered and is difficult of access, and a very small
portion has actually been prospected by practical men.
Pieman R.iver y West Coast . ?Gold of a superior quality has been
found in alluvial deposit over a large extent of country, and quartz reefs
have been traced in many parts. About 100 miners are scattered about,
some of whom are evidently carrying on mining operations with very
profitable results.
Port Cygnet. ?A small alluvial gold field, 35 miles south of Hobart
Town, supporting about 25 miners. The gold is in shallow deposit, and is
of superior quality.
Southport. Gold has quite recently been found here, almost the
extreme southern part of the Colony.
