PREFACE.
Evert teacher is aware that it is much easier to
implant good habits in the mind and conduct of a
pupil than to eradicate bad ones. This remark
applies forcibly to the art of reading aloud. The
faculty of imitation is strong and active in children.
The living model placed before them should, therefore,
be as perfect as possible ; for as is the instructor so
will be the instructed. They act and re-act on each
other. Now, the defect which largely characterises
the reading of young people is that of monotony.
They should, accordingly, be early taught to inflect
their voices in a manner calculated to give clearness
and precision to thought, and at the same time to
impart definiteness and exactness to spoken sound.
The readings and recitations now printed, have been
selected with the view of bringing the inflections of
the voice into constant play, as heard in correct
elocution and animated conversation.

Shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not ?
or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no
understanding ?
Can a man he profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be
profitable to himself ? Is it any pleasure to the Almighty that
thou art righteous ? or is it gain to him that thou makest thy
way perfect ? Will he reprove thee for fear of thee ? Will he
enter with thee into judg'ment ?
Is it such a fast that I chosen ? a day for a man to
afflict his soul ? Is it to how down his head as a bud rush, and
to spread sackcloth and ash a under him ? Wilt thou call this'
a fast and an accept'able day unto the Lord ?
Have ye understood all these things ?
Know ye what I have done to you?


Is it well with thee ? Is it well with thy hud hand ? Is it
well with the child ?
Has chance ?has this mysterious word, enacted the diurnal
and annual revolution of the globe, and consequently the season
of action, and the season of repose ? the gradual increase and
diminution of heat and cold ? with the grateful vicissitudes of
the seasons ? Did adcident hid all the trees of the forest wave
their stately heads on high ?
Look upon the tombs Are their inhabitants all old ? No ;
not all. Many ? no, not many ; the aged are a thinly scattered
number.
I an itching palm ?
You know that you are Brutus that speak this,
Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
Can ministers still presume to expect support in their infatua-
tion ? Can parliament he so dead to its dignity and duty, as
to give its consent to measures thus obtruded and forced
upon it ?
Is it come to this ? Shall an inferior magistrate, a governor,
who holds his whole power of the Homan people, in a Homan
province, within sight of Italy, bind, scourge, torture, with fire,
and red-hot plates of iron, and at last put to the infamous death
of the Cross, a Homan Citizen ?
Can?st thou draw out leviathan with a hook ? or his tongue
with a cord which thou lettest down ? Canst thou put a hook
into his nose ? or bore his jaw through with a thorn ? "Will he
make many supplications unto thee ? Will he speak soft words
unto thee? Will he make a covenant with thee? Wilt thou take
him for a servant for ever ? Wilt thou play with him as with a
bird? or, Wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?

Who is the hoary sexton that digs man a grave ? Who is the
painted temptress that steals his virtue ? Who is the murderess
that destroys his life ? Who is the sorceress that first deceives and
then damns his soul ? ? Sin. Who, with 'icy breath, blights the
fair blossoms of youth ? Who breaks the hearts of parents ? Who
brings grey hairs with sorrow to the grave ? ? Sin. Who, hy a more
hideous metamorphosis than Ovid ever fancied, changes sweet
children into vipers, tender mothers into monsters, and their fathers
into worse than Herods ?the murderers of their own innocents ?
Sin. Who casts the apple of discord on household hearths ? Who
lights the torch of war, and carries it blazing over happy lands ?
Who, by divisions in the church, rends Christ's seamless robe ? ? Sin.
Who is this Delilah that sings the Nazarite asleep, and delivers
up the strength of God into the hands of the uncircumcised ? Who,
with winning smiles on her face, and honied flattery on her
tongue, stands in the door to offer the sacred rites of hospitality,
and when suspicion sleeps, pierces our temple with a nail ? What
Siren is this, who, seated on a rock hy the deadly pool, smiles
to deceive, sings to allure, kisses to betray, and flings her arms
around our neck, to leap with us into perdition ? ?Sin. Who
petrifies the softest and gentlest heart ? Who hurls reason from her
throne, and impels sinners, mad. as Gadarene swine, down the
precipice into a lake of fire ? ?Sin. Oh ! Sin, thou art a hateful
and horrible thing, that abominable thing which God hates.
Brethren, surely the wonder of wonders is, that sin is not that
abominable thing which we also hate. ? Guthrie.

Having, then, gifts, differing according to the grace that is
given us, whether prophecy,* let us prophesy according to the
proportion of faith : or ministry, let us wait on our minister-
ing ; or he that teacheth, on teaching; or he that exhorteth,
on exhortation ; he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity ;
he that ruleth, with diligence ; he that showeth mercy with
cheerfulness.

Professing themselves to he wise, they became fools.
Now if we he dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also
live with him.
For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his

To he carnally minded is death; hut to he spiritually minded

"We are fools for Christ?s sake, hut ye are wise in Christ; we are
weak, but ye are strong ; ye are honourable, hut we are despised.
Now to him that wbrketh, is the reward not reckoned of grace,

that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.

MISCELLANEOUS SELECTIONS.
Illustrative of the foregoing simple Rules.
Are you desirous that your talents and abilities may procure
you respect? Display them not ostentatiously to public view'.
Would you escape the envy which your riches might excite ?
Let them not minister to pride, hut adorn them with humility.
There is not an evil incident to human nature for which the
Gospel doth not provide a remedy. Are you ignorant of many
things which it highly concerns you to know 1 f The Gospel
offers you instruction. Have you deviated from the path of
duty ? The Gospel offers you forgiveness. Do temptations
surround you ? The Gospel offers you the aid of Heaven. Are
you exposed to mis'ery ? It consoles you. Are you subject to
death ? It offers you immortality. .
There appears to exist a greater desire to live long than to
live well: measured by man?s desires, he cannot live long enough;
measured by his good deeds, and he has not lived long enough;
measured by his evil deeds, and he has lived too long.
To know by rote, is no knowledge, and signifies no more
than to retain what one has intrusted to his memory. That
which a man rightly knows and understands, he is the free
disposer of at his own full liberty, without any regard to the
author from whence he had it, or fumbling over the leaves of
his book. Mere bookish learning is both troublesome and un-
grateful.
Bended knees, while you are clothed with prCde; heavenly
petitions, while you are hoarding up treasures upon earth;
holy devotions, while you live in the follies of the wortd;
prayers of meekness and charity, while yo"ur heart is the seat
of spite and resentment; hours if prayer, while you give up
days and years to idle diversions, impertinent visits, and foolish
pleasures; are as absurd, unacceptable services to God, as forms
of thanksgiving from a person that lives in repinings and
discon'tent.


Can the soldier, when he girdeth on his armour, boast like
him that putteth it off'? Can the 'merchant predict that the
speculation on which he has entered, will he infallibly crowned
with success'? Can even the husbandman, who has the promise
of God that seed-time and harvest shall not fail, look forward
with assured confidence to the expected increase of his fields ?
In these and in all similar cases, our resolution to act can be
founded on probability alone.
A cheerful temper, joined with innocence, will make beauty
attractive, knowledge delightful, and wit good-natured. It
will lighten sicknesspoverty', and affliction ; convert ignorance
into an amiable simplicity, and render deformity itself agree-
able.
Good name in man and woman
Is the immediate jeivel of their souls.
Who steals my purse, steals trash ; ?tis something ? nothing;
?Twas mine, ?tis his, and has been slave to thousands:
But he who filches from me my good name.
Bobs me of that which not enriches him,
And makes me poor indeed.
Can?st thou not minister to a mind diseased,
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,
Eaze out the written troubles of the brain,
And, with some sweet oblivious antidote,
Cleanse the foul bosom of that perilous stuff
Which weighs upon the heart'?
The study of truth is perpetually joined with the love of
viCtue; for there is no virtue which derives not its origin
from truth''; as, on the contrary, there is no vice which has not
its beginning from a lie. Truth is the foundation of all know-
ledge, and the cement of all societies.


READINGS AND RECITATIONS.
HANG
UP HIS HARP; HE?LL WAKE NO MORE.
[eliza cook.]
His young bride stood beside bis bed,
Her weeping watcb to keep ;
Hush ! busb ! be stirr?d not ?was be dead,
Or did he only sleep ?
His brow was calm, no change was there,
Ho sigh bad fill?d his breath;
Oh ! did he wear that smile so fair
In slumber or in death ?
? Eeach down his harp,? she wildly cried,
? And if one spark remain,
? Let him but hear ?Loch Erroch?s side,?
? He?ll kindle at the strain.
? That tune e?er held his soul in thrall;
? It never breathed in vain ;
? He?ll waken as its echoes fall,
? Or never wake again.?
The strings were swept; ?twas sad to hear
Sweet music floating there;
For every note called forth a tear
Of anguish and despair.
? See ! see! ? she cried, ? the tune is o?er;
? Ho opening eye, no breath:
? Hang up his harp; he?ll wake no more;
? He sleeps the sleep of death.?


THE DEATH OF THE COLLIER?S CHILD.
[Farmer.]
The cottage was a thatch?d one,
The outside old and mean,
Yet ev?rything within that cot
Was wondrous neat and clean.
The night was dark and stormy,
The wind was howling wild;
A patient mother knelt beside
The death-bed of her child.
A little worn-out creature?
His once bright eyes grown dim;
It was a collier?s only child?
They call?d him little Jim.
And oh ! to see the briny tears
Fast hurrying down her cheek,
As she offered up a prayer in thought?
She was afraid to speak,?
Lest she might waken one she loved
Far better than her life,
For there was all a mother?s love,
In that poor collier?s wife.
With hands uplifted, see she kneels
Beside the sufferer?s bed;
And prays that He will spare her hoy.
And take herself instead.
She gets her answer from the child;
Soft fell those words from him?
? Mother, the angels do so smile,
And beckon little Jim!


? I have no pain, dear mother, now.
? But oh ! lam so dry;
? Just moisten poor Jim?s lips again,
? And, mother, don?t you cry.?
With gentle trembling haste she held
The tea-cup to his lips ;
He smiled, to thank her, as he took
Three little tiny sips.
? Tell father when he comes from work
? I said good-night to him ;
?And, mother, now I?ll go to sleep
Alas! poor little Jim.
She saw that he was dying ?
The child she loved so dear.
Had utter?d the last words that she
Might ever hope to hear.
The cottage door was open?d,
The collier?s step was heard;
The mother and the father met,
Yet neither spake a word!
He knew that all was over ?
He knew his child was dead,
He took the candle in his hand,
And walk?d towards the bed.
His quiv?ring lips gave token
Of grief he?d fain conceal;
And, see! his wife?has join?d him,
The stricken couple kneel!
With hearts bowed down with sadness.
They humbly ask of Him,
In heaven once more, to meet again,
Their own poor Little Jim.


THE GRAVES OF A HOUSEHOLD.
[Mrs. Hemans.]
They grew in beauty side by side,
They fill?d one house with glee:
Their graves are sever?d, far and wide,
By mount, and stream, and sea.
The same fond mother bent at night
O?er each fair sleeping brow;
She had each folded flower in sight?
Where are those dreamers now ?
One ?midst the forests of the west,
By a dark stream is laid?
The Indian knows his place of rest,
Far in the cedar shade.
The sea, the blue lone sea, hath one,
He lies where pearls lie deep ;
He was the lov?d of all, yet none
O?er his low bed may weep.
One sleeps where Southern vines are dress?d
Above the noble slain :
He wrapt his colours round his breast
On a blood-red field of Spain.
And one?o?er her the myrtle showers
Its leaves, by soft winds fann?d;
She faded ?midst Italian flowers?
The last of that bright band.
And parted thus, they rest who play?d
Beneath the same green tree;
Whose voices mingled as they pray?d
Around one parent knee.
They that with smiles lit up the hall
And cheer?d with song the hearth?
Alas ! for love, if thou wert all
And nought beyond, 0 earth!


THE POLISH EXILES.
[Miss Pardoe.]
Forth went they from their fatherland,
A fallen and fettered race,
To find, upon a distant strand,
Their dark abiding place.
Forth went they :?not as freemen go
With firm and fearless eye ;
But with the bowed mien of woe,
As men go forth to die.
The aged in their silver hair,
The young in manhood?s might,
The mother with her infant care,
The child in wild affright;?
Forth went they all?a pallid hand!?
With many an anguished start:
The chains lay heavy on their hand,
But heavier on their heart!
No sounds disturbed the desert air,
But those of bitter woe ;
Save when, at times, re-echoed there,
The curses of the foe.
When, hark! another cry pealed out?
A cry of idiot glee;
Answered and heightened, by the shout
Of the fierce soldiery!
?Twas childhood?s voice ! hut, ah! ?how wild.
How demon-like its swell!?
The mother shrieked, to hear her child
Give forth that soul-fraught yell!


And fathers wrung their fettered hands
Beneath their maddening woe,
While shouted out their infant hands
Shrill chorus to the foe !
And curses deep and low were said,
Whose murmurs reached to Heaven;
Thick sighs were heaved?hot tears were shed,
And mothers? hearts were riven;
As, heedless of their present woes,
The children onward trod,
And sang ?and their young voices rose
A vengeance-cry to God!
HUMAN GRANDEUR.
[Goldsmith.]
There is scarce a village in Europe, and not one university,
that is not furnished with its little great men. The head of a
petty corporation, who opposes the designs of a prince, who
would tyrannically force his subjects to save their best clothes
for Sundays; the puny pedant, wdio finds one undiscovered
quality in the polypus, or describes an unheeded process in the
skeleton of a mole, and whose mind, like his microscope, per-
ceives nature only in detail; the rhymer, who makes smooth
verses, and paints to our imagination when he should only
speak to our hearts ; all equally fancy themselves walking for-
ward to immortality, and desire the crowd behind them to look
on. The crowd takes them at their word. Patriot, philosopher,
and poet, are shouted in their train. ? Where was there ever
so much merit seen ?no times so important as our own ! Ages
yet unborn shall gaze with wonder and applause !? To such
music the important pigmy moves forward, hustling and swell-
ing, and aptly compared to a puddle in a storm.


LORD THURLOW?S REPLY TO THE DUKE OF
GRAFTON.
[The Duke of Grafton having, in his place in the House of Lords, re-
proached Lord Thurlow with his plebeian extraction and admission
to the peerage, Lord Thurlow, with great dignity, rose from the wool-
sack, and slowly advancing to the place from which the Chancellor
addresses the House, made the following memorable reply;?]
My Lords,? -I am amazed ; yes, my lords, lam amazed at
his Grace?s speech. The noble Duke cannot look before him,
behind him, or on either side of him, without seeing some noble
peer, who owes his seat in this House to his successful exertions
in that profession to which I have the honour to belong. Does
he not feel that it is as honourable, to owe it to these, as to
being the accident of an accident ? To all these noble lords,
the language of the noble Duke is as applicable, and as insulting,
as it is to myself. But Ido not fear to meet it single and alone.
No one venerates the peerage more than I do?but, my lords,
I must take leave to say, that the peerage solicited me, not I the
peerage ? nay, more ?l can say, and will say, that as a peer
of Parliament ?as Speaker of this right honourable House ?as
Keeper of the Great Seal ?as guardian of His Majesty's con-
science?as Lord High Chancellor of England ? nay, even in
that character alone, in which the noble Duke would think it an
affront to be considered?but which none can deny me ?as a
MAN, I am at this moment, as much respected, as the proudest
peer I now look down upon.
LOVE OF COUNTRY.
[Scott.]
Breathes thSre a man with soul so dead,
Who never to himself hath said,
This is my own, my native land!
Whose heart hath ne'er within him burn'd,
As home his footsteps he hath turn'd
From wand'ring on a foreign strand?


If shch there brSathe, go mark him well;
For Idm no minstrel raptures swSll;
High though his titles, prdud his name,
Boundless his wealth as wish can claim ;
Despite those titles, pSwer, and pSlf,
The wretch, concentred all in sSlf,
Living, shall forfeit fair renown,
And, doubly dying, shall go down
To the vile dust, from whence he sprung,
UnwSpt, unhonour'd, and unsung.
PORTIA?S SPEECH TO SHYLOCK.
[Shakspere.]
The quality of mercy is not strained ;
It droppeth, as the gentle rain from heaven
Upon the place beneath ; it is twice blessed;
It hlesseth him that gives, and him that takes :
?Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes
The throned monarch better than his crow'n ;
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
The attribute to awe and majesty,
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings ;
But mercy is above this sceptred sway,
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,
It is an attribute to God himself;
And earthly power doth then show likest God?s
When mer'cy seasons jus'tice. Therefore, Jew,
[Though justice he thy plea], consider this ?
That in the course of justice, none of us
Should see salvation : we do pray for mercy ;
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
The deeds of mercy.


THE ALAHIVL
[Anon.]
His eye was stem and wild ; his cheek was pale and cold as clay;
Upon his tighten?d lip a smile of fearful meaning lay.
He mused awhile?but not in doubt ?no trace of doubt was there;
It was the steady, solemn pause of resolute despair!
Once more he looked upon the scroll; once more its words he
read;
Then calmly, with unflinching hand, its folds before him spread.
I saw him hare his throat, and sieze the blue, cold, gleaming
And grimly try the temper?d edge, he was so soon to feel.
A sickness crept upon my heart, and dizzy swam my head;
I could not stir ?I could .not cry?l felt benumb?d and dead;
Black icy horrors struck me dumb, and froze my senses o?er ;
I closed my eyes in utter fear, and strove to think no more.
Again I look?d : a fearful change across his face had pass?d;
He seem?d to rave ?on cheek and lip a flaky foam was cast.
He raised on high the glittering blade ; ?then first I found a
tongue:
? Hold, madman ! stay the frantic deed!? I cried, and forth I
sprung.
He heard me, hut he heeded not; one glance around he gave ;
And ere I could arrest his hand, he had?begun to shave !
CASABIANCA.
[Mrs. Hemans.]
{Casabianca, a boy about thirteen years old, son to tbe Admiral of the
Orient, remained at his post, in* the Battle of the Nile, after the ship
had taken fire, and all the guns had been abandoned. He perished in
the explosion of the vessel, when the flames had reached the powder.]
The hoy stood on the burning deck
Whence all hut he had fled ;
The flame that lit the battle?s wreck
Shone round him o?er the dead.


Yet beautiful and bright he stood,
As bom to rule the storm, ?
A creature of heroic blood,
A proud, though child-like form.
The flames rolled on?he would not go
Without his father?s word ;
That father, faint in death below,
His voice no longer heard.
He called aloud ? Say, father, say,
If yet my task be done ? ?
He knew not that the chieftain lay
Unconscious of his son.
? Speak, father ! ? once again he cried,
? If I may yet be gone ? ?
And but the booming shots replied,
And fast the flames rolled on.
Upon his brow he felt their breath,
And in his waving hair,
And looked from that lone post of death
In still, yet brave despair ;
And shouted but once more aloud,
? My father ! must I stay ? ?
While o?er him fast, through sail and shroud,.
The wreathing fires made way.
They wrapped the ship in splendour wild,
They caught the flag on high.
And streamed above the gallant child,
Like banners in the sky.
There came a burst of thunder-sound ?
The boy?oh ! where was he ?
Ask of the winds that far around
With fragments strewed the sea !
With mast, and helm, and pennon fair,
That well had home their part;
But the noblest thing which perished there
Was that young faithful heart.


THE CONJUGATING DUTCHMAN.
[Anon.]
Jones (to Robinson), ? I say, Robinson, have you beard of tbo
arrival of tbe celebrated dwarf?
Dutchman ( methodically ). ? I arrive, tbou arrives!, be arrives ;
we arrive, you arrive, they arrive.
Jones (stepping up to stranger). ?Did you speak to me, sir?
Dutchman. ?I speak, thou speakest, be speaks ;we speak, you
speak, they speak.
Robinson. ?Do you mean to insult us, sir ?
Dutchman. ? I insult, thou insultest, be insults ;we insult, you
insult, they insult.
Jones.?This is too much. I will have satisfaction! If you
have any spirit you will fight. In fact you must and
shall fight.
Dutchman ( very coolly). ?I fight, thou tightest, we fight (makes a
thrust), you fight, they fight, (disarms his antagonist).
Jones. ? Well, you have the best of it, and I hope you are
satisfied.
Dutchman. ?I am satisfied, thou art satisfied, he is satisfied;
we are satisfied, you are satisfied, they are satisfied.
Robinson. ?I am glad everybody is satisfied; but pray leave
off quizzing us in this strange manner, and tell us what
is your object, if you have any, in doing it.
Dutchman. ?I am a Dutchman, and am learning your language.
I find it very difficult to remember the peculiarities of
the verbs ; and my tutor has advised me, in order to fix
them in my mind, to conjugate every English verb that
I hear spoken. This I have made it a rule to do. I
don?t like to have my plans broken in upon while they
are in operation, or I would have told you of this before.
Robinson (laughing heartily). ?A most amusing explanation
truly.


Jones. ?After this, the least you can do is to come and con-
jugate some dinner with us.
Dutchman.?l will dine; (taking the arm of Jones ) you will dine;
( taking the arm of Robinson ) he will dine ; (looking first
at one and then at the other , and bursting into a fit of
laughter , in winch Jones and Robinson join) we will dine.
\They lift their hats to each other , take arms again , and
retire .]
THE LAST MINSTREL.
[ Scott. ]
The way was long, the wind was cold,
The minstrel was infirm and old;
His wither?d cheek and tresses grey,
Seem?d to have known a better day:
The harp, his sole remaining joy.
Was carried by an orphan boy :
The last of all the hards was he,
Who sung of border chivalry.
For, well-a-day ! their date was fled,
His tuneful brethren?all were dead:
And he, neglected and oppress?d,
Wish?d to be with them, and at rest.
No more on prancing palfrey borne,
He caroll?d light as lark at morn ;
No longer courted and caress?d,
High placed in hall, a welcome guest,
He pour?d to lord and lady gay,
The unpremeditated lay.
Old times were chang?d?old manners gone?
A stranger filled the Stuarts? throne.
The bigots of the iron time
Had call?d his harmless art a crime:
A wand?ring harper, scorn?d and poor,
He begg?d his bread from door to door;
And tuned, to please a peasant?s ear,
The harp a king had loved to hear.


THE COMMON LOT.
[Montgomery.]
Once, in the flight of ages past,
There lived a man?and who was he ?
Mortal! howe?er thy lot he cast,
That man resembled thee.
Unknown the region of his birth;
The land in which he died unknown ;
His name has perished from the earth :
This truth survives alone?
That joy, and grief, and hope, and fear,
Alternate triumphed in his breast :
His bliss and woe?a smile, a tear :
Oblivion hides the rest.
The hounding pulse, the languid limb,
The changing spirits? rise and fall;
We know that these were felt by him,
For these are felt by all.
He suffered?hut his pangs are o?er;
Enjoyed?hut his delights are fled;
Had friends?his friends are now no more ;
And foes?his foes are dead.
He loved ?hut whom he loved, the grave
Hath lost in its unconscious womb;
Oh! she was fair, hut] nought could save
Her beauty from the tomb.
He saw?whatever thou hast seen;
Encountered all that troubles thee ;
He was?whatever thou hast been ;
He is?what thou shaft he !
The rolling seasons, day and night,
Sun, moon, and stars, the earth and main,
Erewhile his portion,?life and light;
To him exist in vain.


The clouds and sunbeams, o?er his eye
That once their shades and glory threw,
Have left in yonder silent sky
No vestige where they flew.
The annals of the human race,
Their ruins, since the world began,
Of him afford no other trace
Than this, ? there lived a man !
MARULLUS TO THE MOB.
[Shakspere.]
"Wherefore rejoice ? What conquest brings he home E
What tributaries follow him to Home,
To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels ?
You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things !
Oh, you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,
Knew ye not Pompey ? Many a time and oft
Have you climb?d up to walls and battlements,
To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,
Your infants in your arms, and there have sat
The live-long day, with patient expectation,
To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:
And when you saw his chariot hut appear,
Have you not made an universal shout,
That Tiber trembled underneath her hanks,
To hear the replication of your sounds,
Made in her concave shores ?
And do you now put on your best attire ?
And do you now cull out a holiday ?
And do you now strew flowers in his way,
That comes in triumph over Pompey?s blood E
Be gone!
?
Run to your houses; fall upon your knees,
Pray to the gods to intermit the plague
That needs must light gn this ingratitude.


THE HOMES OF ENGLAND.
[ Mbs. Hemans. ]
The stately homes of England !
How beautiful they stand!
Amidst their tall ancestral trees,
O?er all the pleasant land !
The deer across their green swards hound
Through shade and sunny gleam,
And the swan glides past them with the sound
Of some rejoicing stream.
The merry homes of England !
Around their hearths hy night,
What gladsome looks of household love
Meet in the ruddy light!
There woman?s voice flows forth in song,
Or childhood?s tale is told ;
Or lips move tunefully along
Some glorious page of old.
The cottage homes of England !
By thousands on her plains,
They are smiling o?er the silvery brook
And round the hamlet-fanes.
Through glowing orchards forth they peep*
Each from its nook of leaves;
And fearless there the lowly sleep,
As the birds beneath their eaves.
The free fair homes of England!
Long, long, in hut and hall,
May hearts of native proof he reared,
To guard each hallow v d wall.
And green for ever he the groves,
And bright the flowery sod,
Where first the child?s glad spirit loves
Its country and its God!


THE PRICE OF GLORY,
[Sydney Smith.]
Permit me to inform you, my friends, what are the inevitable
?consequences of being too fond of glory: taxes upon every
article which enters into the mouth, or covers the hack, or is
placed under foot; taxes upon everything which it is pleasant
to see, hear, feel, smell, or taste ; taxes upon warmth, light and
locomotion; taxes on everything on earth, and in the waters
under the earth; on everything that comes from abroad, or is
grown at home : taxes on the raw material; taxes on every
fresh value that is added to it by the industry of man ; taxes
?on the sauce which pampers man?s appetite, and the drug that
restores him to health; on the ermine which decorates the
judge, and the rope which hangs the criminal; on the poor
man?s salt, and the rich man?s spice; on the brass nails of the
coffin, and the ribbons of the bride; at bed or hoard, couchant
or levant , we must pay.
The school-hoy whips his taxed top; the beardless youth
manages his taxed horse, with a taxed bridle, on a taxed road;
and the dying Englishman, pouring his medicine which has
paid seven per cent., into a spoon that has paid fifteen per
cent., flings himself hack upon his chintz bed which has paid
twenty-two per cent., makes his will on an eight pound stamp,
and expires in the arms of an apothecary, who has paid a
license of a hundred pounds for the privilege of putting him
to death. His whole property is then immediately taxed from
two to ten per cent. Besides the probate, large fees are
demanded for burying him in the chancel; his virtues are
handed down to posterity on taxed marble; and he is then
gathered to his fathers?to he taxed no more.


THE HUSBAND?S PETITION.
[Bon Gaultier.]
Come hither, my heart?s darling, come sit upon my knee,
And listen -while I whisper a boon I ask of thee.
I feel a hitter craving?a dark and deep desire
That glows beneath my bosom, like coals of kindled fire.
Nay, dearest, do not doubt me, though madly thus I speak,-
I feel thy arms about me, thy tresses on my cheek :
I know the sweet devotion that links thy heart with mine,?
I know my soul?s emotion is doubly felt by thine.
And deem not that a shadow hath fallen across my love:
No, sweet, my love is shadowless, as yonder heaven above.
Oh, then, do not deny me my first and fond request;
I pray thee, by the memory of all we cherish best, ?
By that great vow which bound thee for ever to my side,
And by the ring that made thee my darling and my bride I
Thou wilt not fail nor falter, but bend thee to the task :
Tut buttons on my shirt , love ?that?s all the boon I ask.
THE VILLAGE PREACHER.
[Goldsmith.]
Near yonder copse where once the garden smiled,
And still where many a garden flower grows wild?
There, where a few torn shrubs the place disclose,
The village preacher?s modest mansion rose.
A man he was to all the country dear,
And passing rich with forty pounds a-year.
Ever to relieve the wretched was his pride,
And even his failings leaned to virtue?s side?
But in his duty, prompt at every call,
He watched and wept, he prayed, and felt for all;
And, as a bird each fond endearment tries
To tempt its new-fledged offspring to the skies,
He tried each art, reproved each dull delay,
Allured to brighter worlds, and led the way.


Beside the bed where parting life was laid,
And sorrow, guilt, and pain by turns dismayed,
The reverend champion stood. At his control
Despair and anguish fled the struggling soul;
Comfort came down the trembling wretch to raise,
And his last faltering accents whispered praise.
At church, with meek and unaffected grace,
His looks adorned the venerable place ;
Truth from his lips prevailed with double sway,
And fools, who came to scoff, remained to pray.
The service passed, around the pious man
With ready zeal each honest rustic ran ;
Even children followed, with endearing wile,
And plucked his gown to share the good man?s smile ;
TTia ready smile a parent?s warmth expressed,
Their welfare pleased him, and their cares distressed.
To them his heart, his love, his griefs were given,
But all his serious thoughts had rest in heaven :
As some tall cliff, that lifts its awful form,
Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm,
Though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread.
Eternal sunshine settles on its head.
NAPOLEON AT ST. HELENA *
[ Anon. ]
Musing on power departed, glories gone,
The conquered conqueror stands Napoleon!
Dark is that rock, yet darker still his brow,
Where chained ambition sits despairing now;
Gloomy that sky?yet gloomier far his fate :
The fiery desolator, desolate !
Beneath, the surges roll with sullen din,
As passion?s stifl?d murmurs swell within ;
Those winds that stir the everlasting sea
* University Prize Poem.


Are vocal to the captive, ?We are free! ?
? And I was free,? his inmost thoughts exclaim?
? Free in the path of conquest and of fame;
? Free as the lightning, when its lurid light
? Makes courage cowardice, and darkness bright;
? Free as the vulture, which, with eager sweep,
? Its victim snatches from the startled sheep ;
? Free as the hurricane, whose raging breath
? Sings loud the triumph of its master, Death!
?Yet loved I not to stain with human blood
? The verdant meadow, or the crystal flood;
? My thoughts, perchance, to softer mood would yield,
? And mourn o?er thousands slaughter?d on the field ;
? My cheek has felt the pensive tear-drop steal: ?
? Napoleon could as well as Xerxes feel!
*** * . *
? Have I not trampl?d the eternal snow P
? The valleys heightened, and the rocks laid low ?
? While giant Winter, on his mountain throne ?
? The ice his rest, the hardy pines his zone?
Shudder?d to see my fiery hosts intrude
? On the chill depths of his vast solitude ;
? And bow?d his hoary head those hosts to see
? Eush like an avalanche on Italy,
? And own a second Hannibal in me ?
? ? Yes! I?ve bid the Imperial Eagle fly?
? Blood on his wing, and lightning in his eye?
? Seize with his talons many a fluttering king,
� And drop, before my throne, the abject thing !
? But sad realities recall me hack,
? To bear the torture of my spirit?s rack.
? Thy fate, Prometheus, in mine own I view :
? To clank thy chains, and feel thy vulture too:
? But, hush ! my burning soul; nor speak to tell
?? Napoleon conquered ! never that he fell! ?


FITZ-JAMES AND RODERICK DHU
[Scott.]
Rod.?Bold Saxon ! to his promise just
Vich-Alpine has discharged his trust.
This murderous chief, this ruthless man,
This head of a rebellious clan,
Hath led thee safe, through watch and ward,
Far past Clan-Alpine?s outmost guard.
Now, man to man, and steel to steel,
A chieftain?s vengeance thou shalt feel.
See, here, all vantageless I stand,
Armed, like thyself with single brand :
For this is Coilantogle ford,
And thou must keep thee with thy sword.
Fitz I ne?er delayed,
When foemen hade me draw my blade ;
Nay, more, brave chief, I vowed thy death :
Yet sure thy fair and generous faith,
And my deep debt for life preserved,
A better meed have well deserved :
Can nought but blood our feud atone ?
Are there no means ?
Eon.?No, stranger, none !
And hear, ?to fire thy flagging zeal, ?
The Saxon cause rests on thy steel:
For thus spoke Fate, by prophet bred
Between the living and the dead ;
? Who spills the foremost foeman?s life,
His party conquers in the strife.?
Fitz. ?Then, by my word, ..,
The riddle is already read.
Seek yonder brake beneath the cliff, ?
There lies Red Murdoch, stark and stiff.
Thus Fate has solved her prophecy ;


Then yield to Fate, and not to me.
To James, at Stirling, let ns go,
When, if thou wilt he still his foe,
Or if the King shall not agree
To grant thee grace and favour free,
I plight mine honour, oath, and word,
That, to thy native strengths restored,
With each advantage shalt thou stand,
That aids thee now to guard thy land.
Kod.? Soars thy presumption then so high ?
Because a wretched kern ye slew,
Homage to name to Roderick Dhu? '
He yields not, he, to man nor Fate!
Thou add?st hut fuel to my hate :
My clansman?s hlood demands revenge.
Not yet prepared ? Ah, then, I change
My thought, and hold thy valour light,
As that of some vain carpet knight,
Who ill deserved my courteous care,
And whose best hoast is hut to wear
A hraid of his fair lady?s hair.
Fitz.?l thank thee, Roderick, for the word
It nerves my heart, it steels my sword ;
For I have sworn this hraid to stain
In the hest hlood that warms thy veins.
Now, truce, farewell! and ruth, hegone!
Yet think not that hy thee alone,
Proud chief! can courtesy he shown;
Though not from copse, or heath, or cairn,
Start at my whistle clansmen stem,
Of this small horn one feehle blast
Would fearful odds against thee cast.
But fear not, ?doubt not, ?which thou wilt, ?
We try this quarrel hilt to hilt.


ON STUDY.
[Bacon.]
Studies serve for delight, for ornament, and for ability. Their
chief use for delight, is in privateness and retiring; for orna-
ment, is in discourse ; and for ability, is in the judgment and
disposition of business. For expert men can execute, and
perhaps judge of particulars, one by one; hut the general
counsels, and the plots and marshalling of aifairs come best
from those that are learned. To spend too much time in
studies, is sloth; to use them too much for ornament, is affecta-
tion; to make judgment wholly by their rules, is the humour of
a scholar: they perfect nature, and are perfected by experience:
for natural abilities are like natural plants, that need pruning
by study; and studies themselves do give forth directions too
much at large, except they he hounded in by experience.
Crafty men contemn studies, simple men admire them, and
wise men use them; for they teach not their own use, but that
is a wisdom without them and above them, won by observation.
Bead not to contradict and confute, nor to believe and take for
granted, nor to find talk and discourse, hut to weigh and con-
sider. Some hooks are to he tasted, others to he swallowed,
and some few to he chewed and digested; that is, some hooks
are to he read only in parts; others to he read hut not
curiously ; and some few to he read wholly, and with diligence
and attention. Some hooks also may he read by deputy, and
extracts made of them by others ; hut that would be only in
the less important arguments and the meaner sorts of hooks;
else, distilled books are like common distilled waters, flashy things.
Beading maketh a full man; conference a ready man; and
writing an exact man; and therefore, if a man write little, he
had need have a great memory ; if he confer little, he had need
have a present wit; and if he read little, he had need have
much cunning to seem to know that he doth not.


TELL?S ADDRESS TO THE MOUNTAINS.
[Sheridan Knowles.]
Ye crags and peaks, I?m with you once again!
I hold to you the hands you first heheld
To show they still are free. Methinks I hear
A spirit in your echoes answer me,
And hid your tenant welcome to his homo
Again! 0 sacred forms, how proud you look!
How high you lift your heads into the sky!
How huge you are ! how mighty, and how free!
Ye are the things that tower, that shine?whose smile
Makes glad ?whose frown is terrible ?whose forms,
Eobed or unrobed, do all the impress wear
Of awe divine. Ye guards of liberty,
I?m with you once again! I hold my hands to you
To show they still are free! I rush to you
As though I could embrace you !
Scaling yonder peak.
I saw an eagle wheeling near its brow
O?er the abyss; his broad expanded wings
Lay calm and motionless upon the air,
As if he floated there without their aid,
By the sole act of his unlorded will
That buoyed him proudly up. Instinctively
I bent my how; yet kept he rounding still
His airy circle, as in the delight
Of measuring the ample range beneath
And round about; absorbed, he heeded not
The death that threatened Kim ?I could not shoot,
?Twas liberty. I turned my bow aSide
And let him soar away. ?
Heavens! with what pride, I used
To walk these hills, and look up to my God,
And think the land was free. Yes, it was free !
From end to end, from cliff to lake, ?twas free !


Free as our torrents are, that leap our rocks,
And plough our valleys, without asking leave ;
Or as our peaks, that wear their caps of snow,
In very presence of the regal sun !
How happy was I then !?I loved
Its very storms! ?Yes!?l have often sat
In my boat at night, when down the mountain gorge
The wind came roaring. I have sat and eyed
The thunder breaking from his cloud, and smiled
To see him shake his lightnings o?er my head,
And think I had no master, save his own !
On the wild jutting cliff, o?ertaken oft
By the mountain blast, I?ve laid me flat along;
And while gust followed gust more furiously,
As if twould sweep me o?er the horrid brink,
Then have I thought of other lands, whose storms
Are summer-flaws to those of mine, and just
Have wished me there; the thought that mine was free
Has checked that wish, and I have raised my head,
And cried, in thraldom, to that furious wind,
Blow on!? This is the land of liberty !
WOMAN.
[Bulwer Lytton.]
The man who sets his heart upon a woman
Is a chameleon, and doth feed on air;
From air he takes his colours, ?holds his life, ?
Changes with every wind?grows lean or fat,
Rosy with hope, or green with jealousy,
Or pallid with despair?just as the gale
Varies from north to south?from heat to cold !
Oh, woman! woman ! thou should?st have few sins
Of thine own to answer for! Thou art the author
Of such a hook of follies in a man,
That it would need the tears of all the angels
To blot the record out.


PATRICK HENRY?S SPEECH ON AMERICAN
INDEPENDENCE.
They tell us, sir, that we are weak, unable to cope ?with so
formidable an adversary. But when ?shall we be stronger ? Will
it be the next week, or the next year ? Will it be?when we
are totally disarmed, and when a British guard shall be stationed
in every house ? Shall we gather strength ?by irresolution and
inaction ? Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance, by
lying supinely on our backs, and hugging the delusive phantom
of hope, until our enemies shall have bound us? hand ?and foot?
Sir, we are not weak, if we make a proper use of those means
which the God of nature hath placed in cmr power. Three
millions ?of people, armed?in the holy cause of liberty, and in
such a country as that which we possess, are invincible by any
force which our enemy can send against us. Besides, sir, we
shall not fight our battles alone. There is a just God, ?who
presides over the destinies of nations, and who will raise up
friends to fight our battles for us. The battlp, sir, is not to the
strong alone ,? it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave.
Besides, sir, we have no election. If we were base enough to
desire it, it is now too late ?to retire from the contest. There
is no retreat, hut in submission and slavery I Our chains are
forged. Their clanking ?may he heard on the plains of Boston I
The war is inevitable ?and let -it come ! ?I repeat it, sir, let it
come ! It is vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen
may cry peace peace? hut there is no peace. The war is
actually begun ! The next gale that sweeps from the north, will
bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms ! Our brethren
are already in the field ! Why stand we here idle ! What is it,
that gentlemen wish? what would they have? Is life so
dear, ox peace?so sweet, as to he purchased?; at the price of chains
and slavery ? Forbid it, ??. Almighty God ?l know not?what
course others may take?hut as for me, give me LIBERTY or
give me DEATH!


THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RICH AND POOR.
[Bulwer Lytton.]
X want a confidant. Left fatherless when yet a boy, my
poor mother grudged herself food to give me education.
Some one had told her that learning was better than house
and land?that?s a lie. On the strength of that lie I was
put to school ?sent to college?a sizar. Do you know what
a sizar is? In pride he is a gentleman?in knowledge a
scholar?and he crawls about midst gentlemen and scholars,
with the livery of a pauper on his hack! I carried off the
great prizes?l became distinguished?l looked to a high
degree leading to a fellowship; that is, an independence for
myself? a home for my mother. One day a young lord insulted
me. I retorted ?he struck me?refused apology?refused
redress. I was a sizar! a Pariah ! a thing to he struck ! Sir, I
was at least a man, and I horsewhipped him in the hall before
the eyes of the whole college. A few days and the lord s chas-
tisement was forgotten; the next day the sizar was expelled
the career of a life blasted. That is the difference between rich
and poor: it takes a whirlwind to move the one ?a breath may
uproot the other.
LORD CHATHAM?S SPEECH ON THE AMERICAN
WAR.
I cannot, my lords, I w'ill not', join in congratulation on mis-
fortune, and disgrace. This , my lords, is a perilous , and
tremendous moment. It is not a time for adulation: the
smoothness of flattery ?cannot sav s e us, in this rugged, and


awful crisis. It is now necessary to instruct the throne, in the
language of truth. We must, if possible, dispel the delusion,
and darkness, which envelop it; and display, in its full danger,
and genuine colours, the ruin, which is brought to our doors.
Can ministers still presume to expect support in their infatua-
tion I Can parliament be so dead to its dignity, and duty,
as to give its consent to measures, thus obtruded, and forced
upon them ? Measures, my lords, which have reduced this late
flourishing empire?to scorn, and contempt! ? But yesterday,
and Britain might have stood against the world ; now, none so
poor, as to do her reverence." The people, whom we at first
despised as rebels, but whom we now acknowledge as enemies,
are abetted against us, supplied with every military store, have
their interests consulted, and their ambassadors entertained by
our inveterate enemy ?and ministers do not, and daub not,
interpose, with dignity, or effect. The desperate state of our
army abroad, is in part known. No man more highly esteems,
and honours the British troops, than Ido ; I know their virtues,
and their valour ; I know they can achieve anything, but impos-
sibilities ; and I KNOW that the conquest of British America IS
an impossibility. You cannot, my lords, you CA'NN'OT conquer
America. What is your present situation there I We do not
know the worst; but we know, that in three campaigns, we
have done nothing, and suffered much. You may swell every
expense, accumulate every assistance, and extend your traffic
to the shambles of every German despot: your attempts will
be for ever vain, and impotent?doubly so, indeed, from
this mercenary aid, on which you rely; for it irritates, to an
incurable resentment, the minds of your adversaries, to overrun
them with the mercenary sons of rapine, and plunder, devoting
them, and their possessions to the rapacity of hireling cruelty.
If 1 were an American, as I am an Englishman, while a foreign
troop was landed in my country, I never would lay down my
arms ; No ? Never, NEY'EE, nev'er.


A NOCTURNAL SKETCH.
[Hood.]
Even is come ; and from the dark park, hark,
The signal of the setting sun?one gun!
And six is sounding from the chime ; prime time
To go and see the Drury-Lane Dane slain, ?
Or hear Othello?s jealous douht spout out, ?
Or Macbeth raving at that shade-made blade,
Denying to his frantic clutch much touch ;
Or else to see Ducrow -with wide stride ride
Four horses as no other man can span;
Or in the small Olympic Pit, sit, split
Laughing at Liston, while you quiz his phiz.
Anon Night comes, and with her wings brings things.
Such as, with his poetic tongue, Young sung.
The gas up-hlazes with its white bright light,
Now thieves, to enter for your cash, smash, crash,
Past drowsy Charley, in a deep sleep, creep,
But frighten?d by Policeman B 3, flee,
And while they?re going, whisper low ?No go! ?
Now puss, while folks are in their beds, treads leads,
And sleepers waking, grumble ? Drat that cat!??
Who, in the gutter, caterwauls, squalls, mauls
Some feline foe, and screams in shrill ill will.
Now hulls of Bashan, of a prize size, rise
In childish dreams, and with a roar gore poor
Georgy, or Charley, or Billy, willy-nilly.
But Nursemaid in a nightmare rest, chest-press?d,
Dreameth of one of her old flames, James Games;
And that she hears, {what faith is man's !) Ann?s banns,
And his from Eeverend Mr. Eice, twice, thrice,
While ribbons flourish, and a stout shout out,
That upwards goes, shows Eose knows those hows? woes.
