Moreland Church of Christ
SILVER ANNIVERSARY SOUVENIR
1909—1934
PREFACE.
rHE compilation of the following information was
undertaken in order to pay a tribute to the service
of those Christian men and women, who, under the
guidance and blessing of our Heavenly Father, so truly laid
the foundations of the church of Christ at Moreland.
Another object was to concentrate in a small, brief but
accurate form information now obtainable more easily than
would be the case in later years, in order that the present
and future ‘‘younger generation” may be conscious of their
indebtedness to those now old in years and service in the
church, and in the hope that young Christians may feel
the mantle of past achievement upon their shoulders and
thus continue the work so faithfully begun by their pioneer
brethren.
No claim to completeness is made, although accuracy is
claimed. Should those in a position to do so supply in-
formation and time permits, it is quite likely that, by the
Grace of God, a fuller, if not more interesting, record of
the period 1909-1934 will be collated.
The reader is asked to be assured that it is firmly
believed that the Grace of God, the love of Christ and the
abiding of the Spirit of Truth in the hearts of Christians,
and those things alone have accomplished the things herein
recorded. To our Heavenly Father we are willing and
anxious to ascribe all the praise.

formation of the Church.
IN 1907 the church of Christ in Glenlyon Road, Brunswick, had in
membership many members residing in North Brunswick and
South Coburg, and at least one mile from the Glenlyon Road
chapel. After negotiation with the officers of the church, worship
meetings for the convenience of the northern-located members were
commenced in the home of Bro. J. Anderson, “Monaville,” 44 More-
land Road, East Brunswick. The first meeting was conducted on
Ist September, 1907. The attendance was 18; the offering amounted
to 15/9.
As the meetings continued attendances and offerings increased.
Encouraged by the early success of the worship meetings, the More-
land brethren held a meeting on 28th October, 1907, to consider
the advisability of commencing a cause separate from the Bruns-
wick church. The chairman of the meeting was Jos. Jenkins, and
on his casting vote the matter was held in abeyance.
Meetings at Moreland were always presided over by a brother
chosen by the Brunswick officers, who also chose the speaker for
the service. It will be clear, therefore, that at this time the More-
land brethren were an integral part of the Brunswick church, to
which all offerings were handed.
Agitation for separation and the launching out into the pro-
clamation of the Gospel was continued. Early in 1908 A. H. Paul
was appointed secretary to the Moreland group. On Bth April,
1908, a meeting at Moreland instructed their secretary to draw up
plans for the conduct of their meetings which were held, after that
date, in a hall in Davies Street, on the west side of Sydney Road,
the consent of the Brunswick officers to the change in the place
of meeting having been obtained on 6th April, 1908.
A resolution of supreme importance passed by the same meeting
reads as follows: “That we have ... a Sunday School to com-
mence first Sunday after . . . Brunswick Anniversary.” A
further resolution reads: “That Bro. Hunter be superintendent for
twelve months.” A third one reads: “That Bible Class be held
on Thursday, 23rd April, 1908.” Thus the early records indicate
the meetings and activities commenced, under the aegis of the More-
land brethren. It was not, however, until another twelve months
had elapsed that separation from Brunswick was effected. Until
9th May, 1909, efforts by the Brunswick church to delay the com-
mencement of a separate church at Moreland were successful. A
meeting on 18th March, 1909, brought indecision to an end with the
following resolution: “That the brethren meeting at Moreland have
decided to start a cause at Moreland on their own account the
second Sunday in May, 1909,” and further: “The secretary is in-
structed to write to the Brunswick church to that effect, and ask
all who wish to attend at Moreland.”
Correspondence in accordance with the above instruction was
sent, and a reply received at a meeting on 27th April, 1909, when
a temporary set of officers was appointed. On 9th May, 1909, the
inaugural worship meeting of the church of Christ at Moreland was
held. After the meeting W. Hunter was given authority to engage
a hall to celebrate the first anniversary of the Moreland church of
Christ Bible School. It will be observed therefore, that, at More-
land the Bible School is one year older than the church.

Development of the Church.
THE first Sunday School anniversary was held in May, 1909, in
the Congregational Hall, Sydney Road. The newly-formed
church hired a hall for meetings for worship, the preaching
of the gospel, and the conduct of its business.
Attention to each of the above matters is necessary to the develop-
ment of a church along normal lines. The first business meeting
of the church at Moreland took place on 3rd June, 1909. The meet-
ing was attended by 29 members. Seven deacons were elected, in-
cluding the treasurer with the secretary making the eighth officer.
The number of members received from Brunswick and other
churches on 9th May, 1909, was 38. After a successful year’s
work in the proclamation of the gospel and in Bible School work
the roll contained 64 names. The church was admitted to the
Victorian Conference of Churches of Christ in 1910. Progress was
maintained, and in April, 1911, the membership had reached 79.
In October, 1911, the church, which had been built up by the
time-honoured method of part-time or week-end preaching, desired
to reach out after larger experiences. Thirty-three homes were
represented in the total membership of 80. Thos. Bagley was asked
to conduct a mission in November. The venture was successful,
thirteen being added to the church. A yet more significant forward
move, however, was made. An instruction to the officers was “to
engage a full-time evangelist.” In due season, January, 1912, J. C. F.
Pittman commenced his ministry at Moreland. Always vigorous, the
growth of the church became even more pronounced. Changes in
the Board of Officers were occurring at each annual meeting; thus
is indicated the willingness of the man-power to be converted to
spiritual-power in supervising the affairs of a growing church.
It was not a difficult matter to congratulate the church upon its
growth and progress in 1913, and the chairman of the business
meeting in April of that year did so. The benefits of Brother
Pittman’s ministry of fifteen months were very real, and 190 persons
were on the roll. When the church met for its fifth annual meeting
in April, 1914, the increase in numbers had been so prolific that 216
names were on the membership roll.
The ministry of Brother Pittman came to an end on 30th Novem-
ber, 1914, after two years and ten months’ service to the church. All
regretted the transfer of this genial pastor to Ascot Vale. But with
foundations so well and truly laid, all were happy to say “Well
done” to the departing pastor. Thos. Hagger carried on the gospel
services until a successor to Brother Pittman had been secured
in the person of W. L. Ewers, who commenced his service with the
church on 18th April, 1915.
In 1915 the church ventured to appoint five elders, but after a
period of twelve months the method of church management which
included an eldership was not persisted in. The church was unfor-
tunate in having to part with Brother Ewers after a period of twenty
months. Western Australia called and Brother Ewers responded
It was with the utmost goodwill that the church said farewell to
him on 31st December, 1916.
P. Warhurst was the successor to Brother Ewers, and took up
work at Moreland in March, 1917, and remained till 14th April, 1918.
Progress had been maintained; 264 was the total membership. F. J.
Sivyer began his ministry at Moreland on 4th August 1918. When
the church gathered in annual meeting in April, 1920, it was then
eleven years old, and had a membership of 332. Indeed, a gratifying
result. At this time much thought to the internal management of
the church led to the reorganisation of the Officers’ Board. Another
change in the ministry occurred when F. J. Sivyer terminated his
service 6th March, 1921. It was not until July, 1921, that W. Gale
opened his ministry. A. B. Withers became assistant while Bro.
Gale supervised the Victorian Bible School and Young People’s De-
partment work. Pronounced increases in membership were reported
annually. In April, 1925, a membership of 375 was reported.
In April and May, 1926, the Baker-Clay mission added forty-one
souls to the church, and offerings to meet its expenses were suffi-
ciently liberal to produce a surplus of £56. The evangelist’s posi-
tion was vacated by Brother Gale on Bth January, 1927, after five
and a half years’ happy service.
4


H. B. Robbins entered on a part-time ministry on 15th January,
1927, and successfully carried on the work of evangelist till 28th
August, 1927. Much thought and prayer preceded the opening
of the ministry of J. E. Webb on 4th September, 1927. The church
was in good heart. Consequently, at the annual meeting in April,
1928, a record membership of 380 was reported. During the follow-
ing year a strict roll revision took place; 82 names were removed
from the active membership roll, but this was happily offset by the
addition of 56 for the year. By the time of the 1930 annual meeting
the roll contained 368 names. Brother Webb removed to Brighton
30th June, 1930, after a very successful building-up ministry.
Another part-time service was the lot of the church, H. G. Ras-
mussen filling the platform from 7th July, 1930 until Ist February,
1931.
R. L. Arnold (the present evangelist) commenced his service with
the church on Bth February, 1931. The conditions in the world,
which have so seriously effected this country, have made their re-
percussions felt in the church. Through it all, however, the sincere,
enthusiastic and unabated vigour of Brother Arnold’s spiritual
leadership has been fully appreciated. The church has been pleased
to offer a five-years’ engagement to Brother Arnold, which does not
terminate until April, 1937.
From the beginning the church membership roll has been kept
free of the names of those whose attendance and service has not
shown a true fellowship with the church. In the past four years
117 members have been lost through roll revision. Although this
has been tragic, the roll membership at the 25th annual meeting
was 337.
For all the blessings of the quarter of a century now past we
return thanks to our Heavenly Father.
Ldand and Buildings.
When the church held its inaugural meeting for worship on
Sth May, 1909, a small hall in Davies Street (west of Sydney
Road) was hired. Week-night services, business meetings (of which
there were many), and Lord’s Day services were held therein.
The foundation membership and officers, however, were fully
seized with the necessity of the church having a meeting-place—a
church home —of its own. No surprise, therefore, is experienced
when the early records show that on 10th June, 1909, the following
resolution was passed: “That the officers’ suggestion to commence a
building and land fund be adopted.’’ Joyful anticipation and con-
secrated effort lent power to the strivings of the newly-formed church.
On 15th July, 1909, the church authorised J. J. Anderson to purchase
on its behalf a block of land in Moreland Road (where the Moreland
P.O. is now located). Prior to this instruction being complied with
the land on which the chapel now stands was suggested as a more
suitable allotment, and by Ist August, 1909, a deposit had been paid.
A subsequent business meeting agreed to the substitution of the
Davies Street site for the previous choice. The 9th September, 1909,
saw £5O paid off the purchase price. Early in 1910 the land was
fenced by voluntary labour. Loans free of interest were supplied by
members, and when the first annual meeting was held the Trustees
reported: “The total purchase money has been paid and the deeds to
the land are in the hands of the solicitor.” The cost of the land was
£lBl/5/-. It was certainly a splendid effort for a church one year
old and comprised of only 64 members to raise that sum in nine
months.
Land without a building, however, did not assist in solving the
problem of overcrowded meetings of both church and Bible School
held in the hired hall. A loan for building purposes was suggested.
Unfortunately other difficulties than finance presented themselves.
In deference to the wishes of the Brunswick church, which sent
a deputation to a meeting held in June, 1910, urging Moreland to
re-unite with Brunswick or build a chapel further north than Davies
Street, it was decided to delay building operations for the time
being.
Matters remained in abeyance until February, 1911, when the
Trustees were authorised to raise a loan of £5OO for the erection of
a building, and plans and specifications were drawn and estimates
obtained. In March an estimate of £479 for a weatherboard struc-
ture was rejected in favour of one of £5BO/10/- for a brick structure
35 ft. x 45 ft. An additional loan of £lOO, making £6OO, in all, was
authorised. Brother F. E. Daws was appointed architect and
supervisor.

The building committee was J. J. Anderson and De Lacy Evans.
29th October, 1911, saw the completion and opening of the chapel.
Security by being in its own home was a blessing the church now
thoroughly enjoyed.
One of the joyful troubles with which the church was beset early
in its history (and not yet fully solved) was the efficient housing
of the ever-growing Bible School. The new chapel did not long
continue to provide sufficient room. Therefore, in January, 1913,
the officers were instructed to consider the question of erecting a
hall in the church yard. A building 30 ft. x 25 ft. was decided upon
in March. It was not till June, 1913, however, that the drawing of
plans was decided on. By that date £46 towards the cost of the hall
had been promised. A gift of £lOO towards the fund, made by
Brother L. Stokes, provided the hall was enlarged, was gratefully
accepted and recorded in the church records. Some delay caused
the opening of the new hall being held over till 21st April, 1914.
The kindergarten department of the Bible School grew in num-
bers, and caused the thought of those responsible to turn once more
to further building schemes. Plan after plan was considered and
rejected. Finance was very difficult, hence against the wishes of
the church and the officers no further building activity was indulged
in till November, 1921. Approval of plans to erect a kindergarten
hall and extend the chapel to the street alignment was then given.
A committee comprised of W. Gale, C. A. Sampson and W. Brown
was appointed to carry out the wishes of the church.
A special appeal for funds to defray the cost of the scheme was
responded to most nobly. The first section of the work undertaken
was the kindergarten hall which was opened in July, 1923. Its cost
was approximately £l,OOO, and the whole amount was subscribed by
the opening date.
Increased church membership and crowded meetings forced upon
the church the completion of the scheme to extend the chapel. A
further appeal was directed to the members in July and August,
1924. The splendid sum of £430 was contributed by members, the
balance being raised by the usual method —mortgage. In January,
1925, the completed chapel was in use. Since that year appeals for
funds to liquidate the building debt have been most liberally re-
sponded to, and to-day the amount remaining on mortgage is £640.
The Chapel as it Appeared from 1911 to 1925.

Coburg Church Comes Into
Being.
LEARNING lessons from its own early history, Moreland did all
it possibly could to plant a preaching centre in the Coburg
district. As early as June, 1915, a committee was appointed
to purchase land for a church to be established in Coburg at a later
date. Land in Bell Street, west of Sydney Road by about one mile,
was favoured. Much thought, discussion and time were given to
the projected opening of a church in the northern district. Land
in Bell Street, abutting the railway line, was suggested by P. G.
Lennox as a suitable site.
Authority to purchase was given in September, 1919. While the
land was being “spied out” the sum of £l7l had been collected in
cash and promises. The contract was signed, and £6O paid as a de-
posit on the purchase price of £360.
A meeting in the Masonic Hall, Bell Street, of members residing
in that area was held, and decided to commence meetings in
Coburg on 11th January, 1920. At the annual meeting in April,
1920, a petition signed by 33 members resident in Coburg was pre-
sented to the meeting, praying that they be granted their transfers
to Coburg to enable the commencement of a separate church as
from 2nd May, 1920. The prayer of the petition was granted unani-
mously. At the same meeting instructions were given to hand over
to Trustees, to be appointed by the Coburg church, one-half of the
then credit balance in the general fund at Moreland (and credit
balances in the general fund were anything but the rule), together
with the land purchased at Coburg by the Moreland trustees and
£BO in the fund known as the “Coburg account.” Indeed, a very
auspicious commencement, and marked by the abundant goodwill of
the parent church to its off-spring.
Sister's W ork.
THERE should be no hesitation in acknowledging the wonderful
part the women of the church have played during the quarter
of a century the church has been in existence. There were
about 20 women among the foundation members. As collectors for
the original building fund, visitors to absentee members and the
sick, investigation of and attendance to benevolent cases, discoverers
of ways and means to provide carpets and other chapel furnishings,
ready supporters of all the activities of the officers throughout the
years, as competent critics, and in a host of other ways they and
their successors have rendered a valiant and continuous service to
the church.
No little credit is due to the sisters for the financial and spiritual
condition of the church to-day. God bless our sisters as they con-
tinue in the Women’s Mission Band the work so ably carried on in
the Ladies’ Aid or Dorcas Society.
Auxiliaries .
Bible School. —The future church can be found largely in the
young people’s associations at present connected with the church.
This is true of all times. As earlier pointed out, the Bible School
at Moreland is one year older than the church. The first meeting
was held on 10th May, 1908. Its founders and indefatigable early
workers were L. Stokes and the late W. Hunter, and late Sister Mrs.
Paul. The teaching staff and scholars rapidly increased in numbers.
At the end of its second year, in 1910, a roll total of 60 scholars
and teachers was returned. The growth of the school can best
be gauged from the following periodic figures:—l9l3, 5 years old,
171; 1918, 10 years old, 307; 1923, 15 years old, 408; 1928, 20 years
old, 361; 1933, 25 years old, 435. From these figures no difficulty
10

will be experienced in the visualising of the accommodation pro-
blem that has consistently faced the church. Members have gradu-
ated from the school to important positions of trust in the church
at Moreland and in other fields.
Junior Christian Endeavour Society. —This auxiliary was founded
in May, 1912. The organiser and leader was Mrs. J. C. P. Pittman.
Its career has been one of continuous service and success. Its num-
bers, unfortunately, are not now so large as formerly. In April,
1914, the membership was 145. Success in the shield competitions
has marked this Moreland auxiliary as one that is highly efficient.
Young People’s Society. —This society has had a somewhat
chequered career. Commenced in May, 1912, it has had two revivals.
Happy indeed is the church because this auxiliary for the past few
years has been maintained in a flourishing condition. An excellent
training ground of our young people, it has been the school in
which some now serving the churches first commenced their Chris-
tian ministry and service.
Intermediate Christian Endeavour. —Formed in 1927, this society
has been in the hands of capable and consecrated young leaders, and
developed on sound lines. The spiritual training of its young mem-
bers has been of much value to the church.
Phi Beta Pi. —This girls’ club, successor to the earlier Girls’
Mission Band, was formed in 1917. Hence a seventeen years’ un-
broken record (to which about five years could be added) is to its
credit. Until March, 1934, the chaplain and leader was Sister Mrs.
Bray. Attention to the spiritual, social and physical needs of its
young women is supplied by the club. For the past several years
the junior girls have had supervision from the club in the junior
gymnastic class during the winter months.
Kappa Sigma Pi. —Activities were commenced on one or two
occasions with fluctuating results. For the last four or five years
it has been very much alive, and has supervised the activities of
the Junior Boys’ Club. Much benefit is accruing from this auxili-
ary’s present curriculum, which has the hearty support of the
church.
General. —For many years the sporting clubs, tennis, cricket and
football have been affiliated with the church. Success in its own
particular field has been won by each club in its respective com-
petition. It is believed that it can be proved through these young
people’s organisations that Christianity produces clean and pure
sportsmen.
Music. —There remains one class of valued service to be acknow-
ledged—the musical service. Since its inception the church has had
the services of its songsters in the telling of the story of salvation
and the Cross. An active choir has almost always been in service.
E. H. Paul, J. H. Barrett, E. Watson, Snr., and F. W. Barnden have
done yeoman service, brightening and inspiring the services with
talent and ability that were consecrated and dignified. For the
past five years orchestral accompaniments have brought into Chris-
tian service not a few of our young and talented musicians. The
present choirmaster is F. W. Barnden, who is heartily supported by
the present members of the choir and orchestra.
Conference and brotherhood associations have been heartily
supported by both substance and talent from Moreland. It is worthy
of note that Brethren Pittman, Ewers, Gale, Sivyer, Warhurst, Webb
and Arnold, whilst serving the church, have at the same time under-
taken brotherhood work. Two of our young men, A. Withers, of
Kaniva, Vic., and F. Daws, of New Zealand, have passed through the
College of the Bible; the former now serves as a full-time evangelist
and the latter renders valued help to the New Zealand churches.

Messages from Past Preachers.
Please accept my cordial congratulations and heartiest good
wishes upon the attainment of your 25th anniversary.
Though not with you when the new cause was inaugurated, my
ministry commenced three years later, upon the completion of the
building of your chapel. To erect a house of worship and engage
a full-time preacher was a venture of faith, but your subsequent his-
tory has fully justified the forward movement.—J. C. F. PITTMAN.
Now twenty-five years old, full grown and strong. Well do I
remember the childhood days of the church, and a very healthy
child it then was. Our ministry was very brief (20 months), yet very
happy and fruitful, with over 60 added to the church and over 100
to the Bible School. Then came the urgent heart-appealing call
from Western Australia for help, and the church graciously released
its preacher, and our ministry suddenly terminated.
In those days none of our Melbourne churches faced a more
glorious opportunity and none made more rapid progress. God’s
blessing has continued through the intervening years. May He lead
you unto greater victories in the coming years.—Wm. L. EWERS.
May I express the hope that this important event in
the church’s history will be very richly endowed with Divine bless-
ings, that all who participate may be inspired with a deep appreci-
ation of what is good and lovely in life, and a full realisation of
our true mission to our brotherman, thus strengthening the church
in its endeavour to fulfil the purposes of our Father God.
Thanking you for this opportunity; I send you all most cordial
greetings.-
P. F. A. WARHURST.
In affectionate remembrance of
F. J. SIVYER, 8.A.,
who passed to higher service on
2nd September, 1934.
Kindly convey my Christian greetings and hearty congratulations
to the good brethren at Moreland on the occasion of the Silver
Anniversary of the church.
I look back with much pleasure on the years I spent with the
church and the happy fellowship of those days. I went there in-
tending to stay for six or twelve months, but remained for nearly
six years, in which I formed many happy friendships. It is a splen-
did church of loyal and responsive people. May God richly bless
preacher and people.—W. GALE.
We look back upon our ministry at Moreland as days crowded
with worth-while incidents. A very pleasing feature was the uni-
formly large attendances at all church services. The appeal to
reduce the church debt met with a ready response, and in a few
weeks, by direct giving, the members of the church contributed £3OO.
For the past we thank God and take courage, and express every good
wish for the continued prosperity of the work. —J. E. WEBB.
WHAT OP THE FUTURE?
It is with feelings of pride and gratitude that we think of those
faithful brethren, who, twenty-five years ago, laid the foundation
and helped to build the superstructure of the present splendid work
at Moreland. We think also of those who, through the years, by their
love and loyalty to their Lord, have maintained and developed the
work so blessed of God. “They have laboured and we have entered
into their labours,” and gratefully we place upon their memory the
tribute of our appreciation.
The church to-day has a great heritage, and we intend to show
our appreciation to the “greathearts” of the past in the only real
way—by being worthy successors, showing the same loyalty, love,
zeal and sacrifice by not only maintaining the present work but by
the grace of God doing even greater things for Him.
The future of the church promises to be very bright. All our
auxiliaries are splendidly led, capably staffed, and are doing a good
work; we have looked to them for co-operation in the past and have
not been disappointed. Confidently we look forward to the future.
We intend to continue preaching the “old, old story,” “contending
earnestly for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints,”
pleading with all to be “reconciled to God through Jesus Christ.”
With hearts full of thankfulness to God for the past, and with
joyful anticipation, we face the future, and in spite of the memory
of splendid achievements we feel confident in saying that for the
Moreland Church of Christ “the best is yet to be.”-
R. L. ARNOLD.
