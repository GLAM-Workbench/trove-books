PREFACE. S**
?^X'Ksn
The Fifth Exhibition of Australian Manufactures and Pro-
ducts was organised by the Melbourne Metropolitan Committee
of the Australian Natives? Association to stimulate an interest
in and to promote the development of Native Industry.
Just as a shop window illustrates the character of the
goods within, so does the great Exhibition, now in triumphant
activity, demonstrate the capabilities of Australians and
Australia.
It is the visible expression of a grand ideal which claims
for native talent, skill and industry an intelligent appreciation
from the citizens of the Commonwealth.
Australia is a land of many climates, from humid to arid ;
possessing every variety of soil ; blessed with a wealth of
native verdure ; luxuriant in vegetation ; great in forest lands ;
rich in any and every mineral to make Australia a great
nation revered at home and respected abroad.
Its pioneers were vigorous enterprising men and women
of industry and perseverance, who delighted in any sacrifice
and dared any danger for their adopted country.
Their descendants to-day, with patriotic pride, have collected
together a vast array of manufactures and products for the one
great purpose of promoting confidence in the ? Made-in-
Australia? movement, and according the opportunity again for
a just, if not a generous, appreciation of the work of
Australians.

The Pure Healthful Juice
of the Apple.
You know that taste of a red ripe juicy apple-
how it hits against your palate with a stingy
zest ?the slight natural tartness giving such a
rare gusto to the fruit. And you know that as
a health food, the apple exceeds any other fruit.
Doctors all agree on this point.
Well, in
KITZ?S
SPARKLING
Apple Cider
All these properties of the apple fruit arc held
captive. Kitz?s Cider is no concocted drink it
is just the pure apple juice expressed from the
finest home grown apples and fermented.
Only the sugar of the fruit suffers any change
in this process - all the full generous flavour
and the health-giving properties remaining
intact.
W jJ&CA j As a summer beverage, Kitz?s Cider is to be
mh! preferred to ales, spirits, and other alcoholic stimu-
lants. Whilst all these tend to heighten the tempera-
i*,, ure � f the bod y? Kitz ? s Clder *cts as a Cooling
urrtt cou.i*� wmr otimulant.
?HBP It neutralizes the uric acid that gives rise to
rheumatism, gout and gravel, and is the only alcoholic
beverage that can be drunk with benefit and relish by those
who suffer from these ailments.
Kitz?s Cider is sold by all hotels, in baby bottles, at Go. and for home enn
sumption by ail Wine and Spirit Merchants, Stores, and Grocer*.

''l V HIS Page should be of special interest to all Australians,
* because it refers to a very recent Australian Invention,
Patented and Made only in Australia.
LEATHERUBBER
Is a Compound of Leather and Rubber, and is a NON-SLIPPING
and ABSOLUTELY WATERPROOF Material.
For Boot Soles and Heels Leathcrubber is unequalled-Quality,
Comfort, and Price will secure for it a large demand.
The ?Australian Leather Journal says:-? With Leathcrubber there is no
tendency to slipping ; it is durable in wear, is waterproof, and, above
all, we are informed, it will be placed on the market as cheap, if not
cheaper, than leather itself.
That is so! It is DURABLE! It is NON-SLIPPING!! It is
WATERPROOF!!! and it is CHEAP!!!
THEREFORE YOU SHOULD TRY IT.
ASK FOR IT, AND INSIST ON GETTING IT!
IMPORTANT.
Leathcrubber must not be confounded, or confused, with
any other material on the market of similar appearance.
Leathcrubber is made for Soles of BOOTS and SHOES (Hen?s and
Women?s), TENNIS SOLES, HEELS, MATS, FLOORING TILES,
INSERTION, MACHINERY BELTING, &c..
LEATHERUBBER TYRES (Solid), for Vehicles.
You arc cordially invited to inspect various samples of
Leathcrubber at the A.N.A. Exhibition. Our Stand is No. 76, in
the Main Hall, on the Right, as you enter.

AUSTRALIAN NATIVES? ASSOCIATION,
OBJECTS.
In forming the A.N.A., its founders were desirous of
combining the benefits to be derived from a Friendly Benefit
Society with those of a Mutual Improvement Association and a
National Association; and its first object is to instil into
its members the principle of Thrift, and to teach them that
in the days of their Prosperity it is their duty to provide
against the day of adversity, sickness, or death. The
advantages to be derived in this respect from membership
in the A.N.A. are at least equal to those offered by any
other Benefit Society, and members have the additional
advantage of joining a Society composed chiefly of young
men who have been sufficiently self-sacrificing to adopt the
sliding scale of payments, in accordance with the suggestion
of the Government Actuary, and so have placed the Sick
and Funeral Funds of the Association on a firm financial
footing.
Aa the Association has no formula to observe in carrying
on its business, each Branch, after the transaction of its
routine work, is able to devote a portion of its time to
the mental improvement of its members. We desire to im-
prove each other and to improve ourselves; to increase the
talents that nature has bestowed upon us; and by the
rubbing of mind with mind, to reap from some of our
members the advantages of an education that it has not
been the good fortune of all of us to enjoy.
As a National Association our power is now distinctly
recognised. We do not, and we never will, interfere in
questions of party politics; but in matters affecting Aus-
tralasia as a whole we have claimed to be, and have been
heard in the past, and we will certainly assert a similar
right if ever occasion demands in the future. We are non-
sectarian. We enquire into no man?s religion. We allow
no religious discussion. We have no secret signs. All our
meetings are open to the public.
BENEFITS.
Medical Attendance and Medicines are obtainable im-
mediately after payment of entrance fees. Sick Pay six
months after entrance, at the rate of �1 per week for the
first six months, ten shillings for second six months, and
five shillings for any succeeding period.
Funeral Donations to Members.?�2o payable at death
to nearest relative or assign, and �lO on death of wife or
widow if registered.

Any person desirous of joining the Association as an
