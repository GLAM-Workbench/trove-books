person qualified for the task shall take up this highly important
subject, the languages and the customs of an interesting primitive
people will be lost to science.
The languages spoken by the native inhabitants of the New
England district of New South Wales are quite different in vocabu-
lary and intonation from those found in any other part of New
South Wales which I have visited. Therefore I consider myself
very fortunate in being the first author to report their grammatical
structure.
In the following pages I shall endeavor to record and preserve
the elements of two aboriginal languages, with a vocabulary of one
of them. All of the materials of the grammars, and also of the
vocabulary, have been collected by me in the camps of the abo-
rigines, and were noted down direct from the mouths of the native
speakers, so that I can become entirely responsible for their
accuracy.
In common with other Australian languages reported by me, the
Anewan and Banbai tongues possess a double form, of the first
person of the dual and plural, in every part of speech subject to
inflection, by means of which the person spoken to may be
included or excluded. It may be stated here that I was the
first author to give full details of this peculiarity in the languages
of Australia, 1 although it had been observed to a certain extent in
some of the islands of the Pacific Ocean, and among the Amarinds
of North America. These two languages likewise contain a dual
and plural number in all parts of speech.
It is hoped that these efforts of mine may prove of some value,
by enabling philologists to compare the native tongues of Aus-
tralian tribes, not only among themselves, but with other languages
in the islands of Polynesia, Melanesia, and various parts of the
Pacific Ocean, as well as with the speech of other primitive tribes
in different parts of the world.
The space at my disposal in the Proceedings of this Society
render it necessary to describe only the leading elements of the
languages dealt with.
Orthography.
The system of orthoepy adopted is that which is recommended
by the Royal Geographical Society of England, but a few addi-
1 “The Gundungurra Language,” Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc., Vol. xl, p. 140.


tional forms of spelling have been incorporated, to meet the
requirements of the Australian pronunciation, as follows:
As far as possible, vowels are unmarked, but in some instances
the long sound of a, e and u are indicated thus, a, e, ti. In a few
cases the short sound of u has been marked thus, u.
Gis hard in all cases. R has a rough, trilled sound, as in the
English word “hurrah!” W always commences a syllable or
word.
Ng at the beginning of a word or syllable has a peculiar nasal
sound. At the end of a syllable or word it has substantially the
sound of ng in the English word “ sing.”
The sound of the Spanish n is frequent; at the beginning of a
word or syllable I have given it as ny, but when terminating a word
the Spanish nis used. Y at the beginning of a word has its ordi-
nary consonant value.
Dh is pronounced nearly as th in the English word “that,” with
a slight sound of d preceding it. Nh has also nearly the sound of
th in “ that,” but with a slight initial sound of the n.
T’is interchangeable with d;p with b ; and g with k.
Ty and dy at the commencement of a word or syllable have
nearly the sound of the English j, or the Spanish ch ; thus, dya or
tya closely resemble ja or cha. At the end of a word or syllable ty
is sounded as one letter, closely approaching the tch in the English
word “catch,” but omitting the final hissing sound.
In all cases where there is a double consonant, each letter is
enunciated.
The Anewan Language.
The remnants of the Anewan tribe are scattered over the southern
half of what is known as the “table-land” of New England, in-
cluding Macdonald river, Walcha, Uralla, Bendemeer, Armidale,
Hillgrove and other places.
ARTICLES.
The indefinite article, a, is not represented, but the demonstra-
tive pronouns, in their numerous modifications, supply the place of
the definite article, as “this man,” “that woman,” “ yonder hill.”
T.he English adverb, here , in its several native forms, is frequently
treated as a demonstrative, and is then also a substitute for the
definite article.


NOUNS.
Nouns have number, gender and case.
Number. —There are three numbers—singular, dual and plural.
Kana, a crow. Kanaburala, a pair of crows. Kananyeta, several
or many crows.
Gender . —Gender in the human family is denoted by different
words. Tana, a man. Kettyura, a woman. Romunna, a boy.
Kemika or nganda, a girl. Kwanga, a child of either sex.
Among animals gender is distinguished by using words signifying
“male” and “female.” Pwela, an opossum. Pwela rula, a male
opossum. Pwela imbarra, female opossum.
Case. —The principal cases are the nominative, causative, instru-
mental, possessive, accusative, dative and ablative.
Nominative: This case simply names the subject, as imboanda, a
kangaroo; naia, a yamstick, without any change in the noun.
Causative: When a transitive verb is used the noun takes a
suffix, as Tananda imboanda nyuna, a man a kangaroo is beating.
Kettyuranda pwela nyuna, a woman an opossum is beating.
Instrumental: This takes the same suffix as the causative. Ketty-
uranda tana nyuna naianda, a woman a man is beating with a yam-
stick. Tananda imboanda nyumbina arkananda, a man a kangaroo
hit with a boomerang.
Possessive: Tanango arkana, a man’s boomerang. Kettyurango
naia, a woman’s yamstick.
Accusative: This is the same as the nominative.
Dative: Rullagu, to a camp.
Ablative: Rullunge, from a camp.
It should be mentioned that in all the expressions illustrating the
several cases, both in the Anewan and Banbai languages, the demon-
strative pronouns are omitted, for the two-fold purpose of saving
space and of avoiding confusion by introducing any more words
than are really necessary to show the declension. For example,
where I have given “man kangaroo hit with boomerang”
would be fully expressed by the native thus: “Man this-on-my-
right kangaroo yonder-in-front boomerang struck-with,” or as the
subject might require.
These remarks apply to every example of aboriginal sentences
throughout both the languages dealt with in this article.


ADJECTIVES.
Adjectives succeed the nouns they qualify, and take the same
inflections for number and case.
Tana birkungirra, a man large.
Tanango birkungirrango arkana, a large man’s boomerang.
Tananda birkungirranda kwanga nyuna, a large man is beating a
child.
It is not necessary to give examples of the other cases.
Comparison of adjectives is effected by two positive statements,
such as, This is good—that is bad; runyerra indya—irrunga indy-
unda.
PRONOUNS.
Pronouns have three numbers, with inclusive and exclusive forms
in the first person of the dual and plural. The following table
exhibits the nominative pronouns:
l Ist Person I Yukka ,
Singular .... 32d “ Thou Indyukka
/ 3 d “ He Gambaua

The possessive and objective pronouns are as under

2 d *« ... Yours Nuka You Audumbinga
3d “ .. . Theirs Nambiga Them Nanya


There are forms of the pronouns meaning “away from me,”
“towards me,” etc., which must be passed over for want of space.
Interrogatives: Who, anunga. What, nyanga. What for,
nyangabura.
Demonstratives: This, indya. That, indyunda. The demon-
stratives are numerous, and of various forms, frequently taking the
place of pronouns of the third person in the singular, dual and
plural. This accounts for the great diversity of the third personal
pronouns, which have little or no etymological connection ivit’h
the others.
The demonstratives in this language, by the combination of simple
root-words, can be made to indicate position, direction, distance,
movement, possession, number, person and size. If space permit-
ted, I could show tables of these demonstratives which would be
most important for comparative purposes. This applies also to the
Banbai demonstratives.
VERBS.
Verbs have the singular, dual and plural numbers, with the usual
tenses and moods. There is a form of the verb for each tense,
which remains constant through all the persons and numbers of
that tense. Any person and number can be expressed by using the
required pronoun from the table given in the foregoing page.
Following is a short conjugation of the verb Nyuka, “ to beat
or strike.”
Indicative Mood—Present Tense.
{ist Person I beat
2d “ Thou beatest
3d “ He beats
and so on through the dual and plural.
Past Tense.

Reciprocal.
Dual. .. .We, exclusive, are beating each other, Tala nyutaka
Plural.. .We, exclusive, are beating each other, Nala nyutaka
ADVERBS.
The following are a few of the more commonly used adverbs:
Yes, ngeh. No, apala. Today, lunna. Tomorrow, yun. Soon,
lanabura. By and bye, loka. Long ago, toangga. Now, ilan.
Recently, irrandya.
How, thanggana. Where, renya. How many, thambula. Here,
awa. There, gamba. The two last are frequently used as demon-
stratives.
PREPOSITIONS.
In the rear, yanda. In front, gattanda. Around, lunggai. In
the middle, umunda. Up, dapai. Down, irrakirran. Between,
ilkongga.
CONJUNCTIONS. '
The general absence of conjunctions is attributable to the nu-
merous modifications of the different parts of speech, by means of
which sentences are brought together without the help of connect-
ing words.
INTERJECTIONS AND EXCLAMATIONS.
TheiSe parts of speech are not numerous.
NUMERALS.
One, nyoanda. Two, tuala.
The Banbai Language.
The aboriginal tribes speaking this language adjoin the Anewan
community on the north, and are located at Guyra, Ben-Lomond,
Wollomombi and Kookarabooka.


NOUNS.
Number. —There is no special declension for number, but the
noun is followed by words signifying two or several.
Gingger bulabulari, kangaroos two.
Gingger girrawa, kangaroos several.
Gender. —Man, thaimburra. Woman, burranyen. Boy, bod-
yerra. Girl, dillanggan. The sex of animals is denoted by words
meaning “male” and “female” respectively, placed after the
creature’s name, as, Margan dyillawara, a buck wallaby. Margan
kandura, a doe wallaby. Among birds, boro means a cock, and
ngapara, a hen.
Case. —There are the nominative, causative, instrumental, pos-
sessive, accusative, dative and ablative cases.
Nominative: Tua, a boomerang. Kunnai, a yamstick. Wan-
dyi, a dog.
Causative : Ginggeru nganya bittang, a kangaroo me scratched.
Burranyendu nganya buang, a woman me struck.
Instrumental: Thaimburradu nganya bindaimang tuandu, a
man at me threw a boomerang.
Possessive : Burranyengu kunnai, a woman’s yamstick. Thaim-
burrangu tua, a man’s boomerang.
In the Gundungurra, and in several other aboriginal languages
of New South Wales and Victoria, the article possessed takes a
suffix, as well as the possessor. For example, warrangan means a
boomerang, and murrin a man, but “ a man’s boomerang ” must be
expressed, , 1
this peculiarity of a double suffix in the genitive case of Australian
nouns had not been observed by any previous author.
Dative : Nguralami, to a camp.
Ablative: Nguranga, from a camp.
Accusative: This is the same as the nominative.
ADJECTIVES.
Adjectives take the same inflections as the nouns which they
qualify.
Thaimburra burwai, a man large.
Thaimburradu burwaidu nganya buang, a man large me struck.
Thaimburrangu burwaigu tua, a large man’s boomerang.

Comparison : Nyam dhurrui—nyam yonggo; this is good—that
is bad. Nyam dhurruiunba, this is very good.
PRONOUNS.
Pronouns have the nominative, possessive and objective cases, as
in the subjoined tables. There are two forms in the first person of
the dual and plural—one in which the person or persons addressed
are included with the speaker, and another in which they are ex-
clusive of the speaker. The following is a list of the pronouns in
the nominative case:
t Ist Person I
Singular .... J 2d “ Thou
l3d “ He

There are also forms meaning “ with me,” nganyumbulla. Ngaia,
as in the table, is used with an intransitive verb, as, ngaia nganggi,
I sit; but when a transitive verb is used, the pronoun is changed to
ngatya, as, Ngatya bonggi, I beat. These rules apply to the other
persons and numbers. Other forms of the pronouns are omitted
for want of space.
Interrogative pronouns : Who, wuttanya. Whom belonging to,
wuttanyannin. What, minya. How many, minya-minya.
Demonstrative pronouns: This, nyam. That, mumum. These
are frequently used as adverbs, and they mean “here” and
“there.”
VERBS.
The rules for the conjugation of verbs are similar to those of the
Anewan language. An example in the singular number of each
tense will be sufficient:
Indicative Mood—Present Tense.
T ist Person I beat
Singular .... J2d “ Thou beatest
(3d “ He beats
Past Tense.
Singular ist Person I beat
Future Tense .
Singular ist Person I will beat
Ngatya bonggi
Nginda bonggi
Ngurrung bo nggi
Ngatya boang
Ngatya bSanggo
The imperative, conditional, reflexive and reciprocal forms of
the verb will be passed over for want of space.
ADVERBS.
Yes, nge. No, wuna. Today or now, gillu. Tomorrow, gur-
lau. Soon, gurubilli. By and bye, kanga. Long ago, dhullumba.
Yesterday, nyukkumba. Certainly, yare. How, dyirrung. Per-
haps, dyirraugam. Where, dyota. How many, minya-minya.
Here, nyam. There, mundyaba. Yonder, mungga-munggara.
Mareda, far away. Close to speaker, tulbaia.
The adverbs “ here ” and “ there ” are often used as demonstra-
tive pronouns, and have the same meaning as “ this ” and “ that.”


PREPOSITIONS.
In front, munggara. In rear, wallungga. Between, pimita.
On the other side, kawatadyula. On this side, ilamgidda. Up,
kaba. Down, warri. Around, kokari.
Conjunctions and interjections are omitted
NUMERALS.
One, kurrukun. Two, bulari.
A Mystic or Secret Language
Before concluding this short article on the speech of the Austra-
lian aborigines, I wish to refer to a secret language, used by the
men at the ceremonies of initiation, but which is never spoken in
the presence of women, or in the presence of those youths who
have not yet entered upon the prescribed course of initiation.
Whilst the novitiates are away in the bush in charge of the elders
of the tribe, they are taught a mystic name for surrounding objects
of every-day life, for animals, for parts of the human body, and
short sentences of general utility. This language is different in
different tribes.
I was the first author to draw attention to this mystic tongue, 1
and during the past year I contributed to the Royal Society of New
South Wales some vocabularies of the secret languages of the
Kurnu 2 and other Australian tribes. I consider my discovery of
this secret form of speech is of great linguistic importance, and
invite my readers to peruse the vocabularies referred to.
In connection with this subject it maybe mentioned that in 1901
I contributed an article to the Royal Geographical Society of
Queensland, on some “ Aboriginal Songs at Initiation Ceremo-
nies,” 3 in which I published several sacred chants in the secret
tongue, which are the first songs of the kind ever set to music.
Vocabulary of Anewan Words.
The following vocabulary, containing about 210 of the most im-
portant words in general use by the Anewan tribes, has been pre-
pared by me from notes taken in the camps of the aborigines.
1 Journ. Anthrop. Inst., London, Vol. xxt, p. 310.
2 Journ. Roy. Soc. N. S. Wales, Vol. xxxvi, pp. 157-160.
5 Queensland Geographical Journal, Vol. xvii, pp. 61-63.


Every word was carefully written down by myself from the mouths
of the natives.
In a communication to the Royal Society of Victoria in the year
1896, 1 I gave a comprehensive description of the initiation cere-
monies of the Anewan, Banbai and other tribes. Again in 1897,
I contributed a paper to the Royal Society of New South Wales, 2
in which I described the Anewan laws of marriage and descent,
with lists of. their totems. On account of the two articles referred
to, it has not now been thought necessary to repeat the subjects
therein dealt with.
