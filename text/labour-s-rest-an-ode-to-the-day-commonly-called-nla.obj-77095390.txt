Habmir?s 3&cst.
My theme, the Sabbath ! Though it may seem strange
To choose such topic; still, in clays of change
Like these, when novelties are sought,
And old-world stories in new form are taught;
When modern wisdom, waking to new light,
Finds right is wrong, and wrong to be the right,
So that to minds erstwhile presumed well taught
Problems arise, with complex errors fraught,
Touching on subjects ne?er discussed before
(Contended for in way one might deplore).
When even the old history, how the world began,
And man was made, and woman formed for man,


Seems doubtful, if respect be duly paid
To wliat some sages latterly have said
Respecting the beginning of what we call the earth,
Which clearly goes to prove how very little worth
The first account in that most ancient story,
Describing so heroically creation?s early glory,
When all around, on earth, in air, or sea,
Appear?d responsive to the word of nature?s Deity?
Perchance my muse might venture her grateful song to
raise,
In honour of a day that men were wont to praise !

Now had th? Omnipotent ?creation?s work complete?
Received from angels and archangels adoring at His feet
New songs of joy, and hymns of praises high,
In honour of His work; as with approving eye


And condescending favour, benignly He surveyed
(Ended that evening sixth) all He had made,
And in that great and comprehensive view
Saw His grand work was good and true.
When He, with purpose high, proclaim?d in Heav?n
A rest should be upon one day in seven,
Wherein man, hereafter fallen from his first estate
Might?toil worn ?quit labour, and a moment contemplate
From whence he came, and, looking up to God,
Own all his fall, and owning, kiss the rod;
Which, though it smote vicariously earth?s soil,
Labour increasing yet gave rest for toil,
Thus judgment tempering with that mercy sweet
That Adam fall?n found, through Adam?s Paraclete.
Here, as in oasis ?midst Time?s desert drear,
Each son of man his weary heart might cheer;
Here pause, and for a space, calmly his path survey,
The road by which he came, and perils of the way;
Here, as from citadel, the path before him scan,
And, trusting in his God, mature life?s future plan;


Gathering fresh strength for conflicts sure to come
Upon the way he journeyeth towards that home,
For which full oft with striving he should yearn,
Like prodigal, as yet far oft?; still longing to return
Unto his father?s house, from whence no more
Should he desire strange countries to explore.
Yet had not Time?s revolving wheel turn?d long,
Ere signs of treason high reached that bright throng
Gathered around the throne of Deity,
From man late form?d in perfect loyalty;
And angels wept, if tears might mar or dim
Aught of the glorious host of Seraphim,
As with veiled faces they beheld the cloud
Of wrath divine, and heard the mutterings loud,
Precedent of storm and hideous devastation
Wrought by man?s fall and nature?s desolation,
When she convulsive groaned, as in despair,
Feeling the ruin wrought by man beyond repair.
Perchance till then as day succeeded night,
And Adam walked with God and angels bright


In that blest garden, special care of Heaven,
A Sabbath seem?d each day amongst the seven !
Nor aught proved toilsome, nor weariness opprest
A perfect man, whose Maker?s image blest
Shone full upon him, that in creation?s grade
He seem?d but little lower than the angels made.
But now, all changed, no more in honour clad,
Behold him fallen, wandering desolate, and sad!
Far from that favour?d spot to memory dear,
That unto God and Heaven once seem?d so near.
Each day now coming calls for work, that life
May be sustained amidst the war and strife
Of nature, punish?d for him, partaking in his fate,
Like him brought low from her primeval state;
Yet still from his offended Maker not wholly cast
away,
The law proceeds that working six, the seventh shall
be a day
Of rest to earth?s inhabitants, labour?s glad surcease,
Foreteller of that time of universal peace


When earth itself shall pass away, and her weary sons
tind rest
As they who after journeying long with sight of home
are blest.
Behold ?and see ! after long ages past
Prophetic narrative fulfill?d at last;
In form of man, the Son of God appear,
As oft foretold by prophet and by seer.
See Him, ye mortals ! as with sorrows riven
His nights and days to constant work were given.
Lord of the Sabbath ! yet to Him that day
Came, and was spent unlike in every way
To that of those whose virtue in the letter
Of the law was found; who owned no better
Nor higher standard, though God?s spirit strove
Incarnate to teach them how to love


That which should make them slaves no more?
Freemen in Christ, not bondmen as before;
That learning how the Spirit giveth life,
They should forbear their Pharisaic strife,
Nor show such eager arrogance each virtue to assume
And o?er more modest brethren their godliness to plume.
He had been present when the stars of morn
Sang joy together o?er the world new born;
He had assumed man?s nature, well could He declare
What was within him, and his feelings share !
Each better aspiration, each spark of Heav?n-born lire,
Each yearning towards their Father, God, in filial desire;
And knowing this, and striving still to lead by loving
word,
He sought in gentleness to fill their hearts with love to
God;
Leading them oft from City upon the Sabbath-day,
Forth into nature?s temple, there to praise and pray
Him whom the Heav?n of Heav?ns may not contain,
And yet is present ?neath each hallowed fane


Where two or three meet with sincere intent,
With purpose fixed and minds on worship bent.
Now ?midst the opening glory of that restful morn
He led them through each field of waving corn,
And some, being hungry, scrupled not to eat
Those ears of grain given to man for meat;
While the great Master, Himself the bread of life,
Forbade them not, but check?d the growing strife
Of catching words put forth by carping Pharisees,
Who bore Him company, their narrow minds
please
With swift detection of what might seem a flaw
In doctrines new, proclaim?d to supersede their law.
Anon He enters temple, fashion?d by human hand,
Built and erected by the Jews at God?s command.
Still working as??neath ceiled roof or open sky?
In doing good He spent His perfect ministry,
Teaching them yet that man, though after dire fall,
Was still in his Creator?s sight supreme and principal


Compared to nature?s other works, but ?stablished for
his use;
And thus He named the Sabbath, now turn?d to an
abuse,
And put above humanity, for whom at first in Heaven
Was set apart one day of rest sacred amongst the seven.
Sacred? Yea, doubtless! and a gift beyond compare
To man, born unto heritage of labour, toil, and care.
Sacred! Yet not as some may deem, with gloomy
turn of mind,
Who keep the day in austere way, nor aught of plea-
sure find
In that, ordained by God of love
As foretaste of the day above,
?Midst joys of which the Christian looks to spend
A Sabbath as in Heav?n?eternal, without end.
Yea, thou art sacred! Hay, or seventh, or first!
And without thee, fallen man were doubly curst;
But thou art sent his grovelling thoughts to raise
From earthly groping, and upwards lift his gaze !


So that his heart might sometimes turn away
From Mammon worship, and those gods of clay
To which he daily stoops, infatuate bowing down,
To images in gold, set up in every town;
Forgetting, in his vain pursuit of earthly things,
One, great God of Gods and King of Kings !
Yet, for true purpose of this weekly rest,
Man is not called upon to seem opprest
With irksome care, how best he may display
Formal and cold regard therefor, nor turn away
His feet from gladsome wandering under nature?s
dome;
Shutting out all joy, making prison of his home,
Teaching each little one committed to him here
To spend Christ?s Resurrection Day in wondering fear, ?
And not as thrice-blest festival, a season of delight ?
Shedding balm on wounded spirits, labour?s blest respite,
Whereon, with all created things, man may his anthem
raise,
Joining the angels as they sing the great Creator?s praise.


Hail, then, blest day of days ! Be own?d as first!
Since on thy morn the gates of death were burst,
And man?s Eedeemer, rising in His might
Left thee a witness and memorial bright;
Above all ancient festivals, best day amongst the seven,
Whereon man too should rise from earth anticipating
Heaven;
Keeping thee holy in a way unknown to those of yore,
By imitating in his life thy Founder more and moi?e.
