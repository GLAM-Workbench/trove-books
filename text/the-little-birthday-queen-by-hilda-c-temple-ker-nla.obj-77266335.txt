From blooms that fairest grow,
And fragrant in the breezes,

Onward, swiftly onward,
O?er hill and meadow green,
And we will in her garden,
Crown Marguerite our Queen.
Wake, oh wake from slumber,
Come all to join us, haste,
And of the day we've longed for
No precious moment waste.
The birthday morning sun on high
Appeared a shimmering globe of light ,
Veiled by a fleeting cloud that bore
The dew-kissed darkness of the night.
A little girl ?her years were few
Into the garden came to wait ,
And watch the road , there first to see
Her playmates trooping to the gate.

Near where the gum trees' tangled boughs
The bush road shadowed from her gaze ,
Smoke from a blaek man's gunyah rose
And softly melted into haze.
And soon were grouped round Marguerite
Of hoys and girls a happy throng;
Love's greeting on their rosy lips ,
Their voices rise to her in song.
We have eome to-day to greet thee-
Come to greet thee, Marguerite;
And in all the summer garden
We ean find no flow'r so sweet.
Dainty gifts we lay before thee,
All in homage at thy feet;
For thy playmates all adore thee?
All adore thee, Marguerite.
And around thee lightly dancing,
As our hands in circle meet;
We would ask that we may cyown thee
For our own Queen Marguerite.
She held no sceptre in her hand,
She wore no erown upon her hair;
Although a queen in childhood's land,
With face so innocent and fair
/ V; Now departing from thy presence,
Gath?ring flow?rs to make thy throne, ''
Leaving maids of honour with thee ff
y, So thou shalt not play alone.


See, before thee they are kneeling,
L
Chosen maids of honour three;
Now upon our errand speeding,
We will say farewell to thee.
Their laughter fell on other ears,
Daisy, the hlaek girl passing by,
Had stayed her little noiseless feet
And peeped at them with glances shy.
And as she lingers there unseen,
She listens while they plan their play ,
Waiting, until with willing steps
On love-set task they speed away.
She, too, will run to gather blooms,
The bush flow'rs all to her belong,
And in the white man's tongue she lifts
Her strangely plaintive voice in song.
1 will gather plenty flower
From the wattle tree ;
Someone scold me, 1 will whisper,
These belongs me.
Put them closely, so together,
Make them twist and twine,
No one now can take them from me,
For they all are mine.
Maybe pretty picaninnie,
Queen with eyes of blue,
Will, if I can bring her flowers,
Love the black girl too.

And so poor Daisy's simple song
She sings unheard , unheeded ends ,
Too far away , those tones , �o reach
The little white child and her friends.
Therein to rest with Marguerite
The girls a pleasant shelter found;
Where shady trees , their branches arched ,
Low' bending o'er the grassy ground.
Here one a pillow smoothly laid
Prepared the royal head to hold ,
And one a crown of roses made ,
And one a fairy story told.
Gay flowers onee in a garden bloomed ,
So bright and beautiful too
Just on the other side of the wall
Wide spreading a gum tree grew.


And all day long had those flowers sighed, ' v V
And said they would grow more fair,
s \ J
Out in the light of the golden sun,
If the gum tree were not there.
They had not heard a wieked old wind
y4s he hid behind the wall;
He was list?ning while the flowers complained
Of the gum tree proud and tall.
Blustering, angry, and rough and rude,
Next day he came back to blow;
He tossed the flowers aside and passed,
But he laid the gum tree low.
There in the glow of the summer sun
He had left the flow?rs to fade;
Too late to repine, so swiftly lost,
Forever the gum trees shade.
And whilst she listened to the tale ,
The Queen upon her eoueh reposed:
The crooning voice to slumber soothed ,
And sleep her eyelids gently closed.
Thd we did not see him coming,
And we knew not Sleep was near,
Still his pinions he has folded,
And a moment lingered here
Is he murmuring a message
To our little birthday Queen ?
When she wakes will she remember
What his mission here has been ?
In her dream see she is smiling,
If we whisper will she tell ?
Nay?l fancy that the fairy
On her lips has laid a spell.

Does she hear the happy twitter
Of the wild birds overhead ?
Or perhaps she still is listening
To our greeting song instead .
Hush ! so softly let us leave her ,
Undisturbed her peaceful rest ,
And for Marguerite we 11 gather
All the flow'rs that she loves best.
Bearing her off ring from the bush ,
With trembling hands and half afraid ,
In silence to the garden came ,
Daisy the little lone black maid .
With timid footsteps drawing near ,
She found the sleeper in the shade ,
And gently on the golden curls
Her wreath of wattle blossom laid.


Tho ? 7i<7M, 7oae7? 7*e e7?7/c7 awoke , V^n
From sleep her blue eyes opened wide ,
Where amongst the moonlit gum trees
Mourneful eurlews ery,
Land of kangaroo and emu , (a
There a queen am /.
Marguerite looked up and saw
Black Daisy kneeling at her side.
You have brought your wattle blossom
And have laid it on my brow,
See my erown of summer roses,
It is yours, so wear it now.
And 1 had forgotten, Daisy,
In the gladness that was mine,
When to-day for me was dawning,
That my birthday morn was thine.
You must stay beside me, Daisy;
Come my royal throne to share,
And they all will danee together,
Round the dark Queen and the fair.
Hand in hand we shall be waiting
To receive our courtly train ;
They will be surprised to see us,
When they all come home again.
Hear you not my own bush calling
That 1 linger long?
In the little white girl's garden,
List'ning to her song.


v
AW
If I loiter here beside you,
Lonely 1 must he;
All the pretty things you play with
Were not made for me.
Back again your merry playmates
Soon 1 know will eome ;
It is best to send the blaek girl
To her own wild home.
Though, when low behind the mountains
Many suns have set,
Marguerite no more remembers,
Daisy won't forget.
To Marguerite's entreaty kind,
Poor Daisy only whispered ? No,?
And as her playmates all returned
She watched the little wand'rer go.
Alone she sought the garden seat,
By bower of roses overgrown;
'Twas there the children found her soon,
Still wearing Daisy's golden crown.
We are laden with the gum boughs,
The wattle tree and fern,
And hidden 'neath their eanopy
We bring a thistle stern.
Some are seeking in the garden
The shamrock there to find,
Then thistle, rose and shamrock,
With gum and wattle bind.
And amongst our nation's emblems
We weave Australia?s gold;
For they all in strength united
Secure our throne will hold.

(i We are loyal subjects standing ] i
We are loyal subjects standing
Around our queen to-day;
And to guard her and defend her ,
We all our part will play.
Those birthday hours seemed winged indeed ,
And each beguiled by happy game ,
Through all that sunny afternoon
No cloud across the garden came.
Ah! there was music in the sound
Their careless notes of laughter made ,
Till Time unnoticed passing saw
The noontide into evening fade .
And then they came to Marguerite
All hand in hand to say farewell ,
On them, and Daisy's gunyah too,
The quiet night unfolding fell.

We gather round thee Marguerite,
?Tis time to say good-bye,
Above us see the Southern Cross
Is shining in the sky.
Within the summer night's embraee
The bush and garden hide,
And through the trees beyond the gate
Strange shadows seem to glide.
When four short seasons o'er us pass,
Our queen again thou'lt be;
Good-night, good-night, dear Marguerite,
And happy dreams to thee.
