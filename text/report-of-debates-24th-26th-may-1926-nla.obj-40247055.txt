COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT'S MEMORANDA.
SEPARATION OF COMMONWEALTH AND STATE FINANCES.
The following proposals provide for a settlement on sound Federal principles of the
vexed question of Commonwealth and State financial relationships. They constitute the first
step towards financial independence for the States by securing to each Government its own
field of taxation.
During the pre-Federal discussions, the difficulties of securing a proper apportionment
of the taxation field between the Federal and the State authorities were fully appreciated.
The taxation field may be broadly divided into two parts —direct and indirect. In
Australia direct taxation includes income taxes, land taxes, &c. Indirect taxation is imposed
by the usual method of Customs and Excise duties.
On the establishment of Federation, the imposition and collection of Customs and
Excise duties necessarily passed into the hands of the newly constituted Commonwealth
authority, as one of the main reasons for Federation was the need for a uniform tariff and
interstate free trade.
It was clear that, for some time at least, the Commonwealth would not require
for Federal services the whole of the Customs and Excise revenues then being collected by
the States. Accordingly provision was made for the payment of this surplus Commonwealth
revenue to the States. The framers of the Constitution, however, considered it undesirable to give
the States a permanent right to share in the Commonwealth revenues. Therefore the Constitution
limited the provision for the payment of at least three-fourths of the Customs and Excise
Revenue to the States to the first ten years after Federation, and thereafter until the Commonwealth
Parliament otherwise provided. This system was known as the “ Braddon Blot,” and universally
regarded as one of the defects of the Constitution, as it removed from the State Governments
the responsibility for raising their own revenues. It was accepted at the time in the belief that
a solution of the financial problems arising out of Federation must be based on experience, and
that the proper authority to determine the matter was the Federal Parliament.
The system was discontinued as soon as the Constitution permitted, and the Common-
wealth then decided to pay the States annually the arbitrary sum of 255. per head of the popu-
lation. A proposal to amend the Constitution to make permanent provision on these lines was
rejected by the people. The electors thus expressed their belief that the Commonwealth should
not be bound to a system of uniform capitation payments to the States, and affirmed the
existing Constitutional provision that Parliament was the proper authority to determine the
payments, if any, which should be made to the States. The Commonwealth Parliament then
passed the Surplus Revenue Act which applied this arbitrary basis to the States for ten years
from 1910, and thereafter until Parliament otherwise provided.
It is a notable fact that the initial payments to the States on the new basis were
considerably less than those under the original scheme. For 1909-10, the States were paid
£8,492,436. In 1910-11, the first year under the new arrangement, the amount was £5,196,424, a
reduction of £3,296,012. This reduction in the Federal payments to the States was necessary to
enable the Commonwealth to meet increased expenditure for Defence, and for a national system
of Old-age and Invalid Pensions. A continuance of the old system of paying three-fourths of
the Customs and Excise revenue to the States would have resulted in the Commonwealth raising
four times as much new revenue as it required for its expanding Federal services.
A system of per capita payments uniform to all States really never applied. Special
treatment was accorded to Western Australia from the outset, and in 1912—two years after
the adoption of the new basis for payments to the States —Parliament decided to grant special
financial assistance to Tasmania. All other Commonwealth payments to the States have been
apportioned on a different basis from that of the capitation payments.


Before the expiration of the second period of ten years, the war completely upset the
Commonwealth finances, and the Commonwealth revenue was not sufficient to meet the
war charges and the capitation payments. It therefore became necessary for the Common-
wealth to impose heavy direct taxation. This need arose before the Parliament had the right
to discontinue the capitation payments. The position would certainly not have been as
unsatisfactory as it is to-day if, when the war burden first fell on the Commonwealth, the
capitation payments had been discontinued and the States had been required to raise their own
revenues in full. It was anomalous that the Commonwealth should impose heavy taxation in a
field which had been always a State field, partly to enable it to continue the capitation payments
to the States.
Since the Ist July, 1920, the Commonwealth Parliament has had the right to discontinue
or to vary the capitation payments. Two proposals for altering the system have been made by
the Commonwealth to the States. The Commonwealth, however, has not been able to secure the
unanimous concurrence of the States in its proposals, and has not pressed them, even though the
Commonwealth could have legislated in the matter without the consent of the States.
The first proposal for an altered system of capitation payments was made in 1919 by the
Right Hon. W. A. Watt—then Acting Prime Minister. This provided for the gradual reduction
of the payment from 255. per head of the population to 10s. Subsequently, in 1923, the States
were asked to accept an arrangement providing for the discontinuance of the capitation payments
and the evacuation by the Commonwealth of portion of the field of income tax.
PRESENT ARRANGEMENTS UNSATISFACTORY.
The Commonwealth is now making payments to the States on the basis of 255. per
head of the population, with additional special payments to Western Australia and Tasmania.
The amount in 1924-5 was £7,473,635 (omitting £61,656 paid to Tasmania in adjustment of
Federal collections of tax on lotteries). In the current financial year, an additional special
payment amounting to £353,112 is being made to Western Australia, following an inquiry into
the State’s position by a Royal Commission. Further aid to Tasmania is also necessary.
The system of capitation payments is an unsound one. It is wrong in principle, unfair
in its incidence, and stands in the way of the Commonwealth evacuating the field of direct
taxation.
The system is wrong in principle, because under it one Government raises revenue
which other Governments spend. The Commonwealth must impose taxation beyond its own
needs, yet it has no control over the expenditure of that portion which it hands to the States,
.whilst the States, though they spend the money, have no responsibility for raising it. The States
have not that financial independence which is essential to good government, and there is not
such a salutary check on expenditure as would be the case if the States themselves had to raise
all the revenues they require.
That the capitation system is unfair in its incidence has been recognized from
the outset. This is shown by the fact that, at the inception of the system, special assistance
was granted to one State and within two years a second State established its claim for special
treatment. The system altogether ignores the needs of the different States, has no regard to the
disabilities of governing extensive territory which is sparsely populated, and applies in the same
manner to the undeveloped States as to the States in a more advanced stage of development.
In the result it favours the better developed and more populous States and, by giving them
unnecessary help from, Commonwealth sources, it stands in the way of the Commonwealth giving
necessary help to the less developed States. It thus impedes the development of the nation as
a whole.

The system is responsible afc the present time for the continuation of the Commonwealth
income tax on individuals, because the Commonwealth could vacate this field of taxation if the
capitation payments were discontinued. This would greatly simplify taxation work both for
the taxpayers and for the Governments, and would secure economy in administration.
Since the Surplus Revenue Act was passed the Commonwealth has contributed many
large sums for specific expenditure made by or in the States. In none of these instances was
the Commonwealth assistance distributed solely on the basis of population, but various methods,
designed to meet the actual necessities of each State, were adopted. The following table of typical
examples shows the amount actually provided for each State compared with the amount which
would have been allotted on a population basis :
PRACTICES IN OTHER FEDERATIONS.
The Australian system of uniform capitation payments, under which the needs of the
States are ignored, is not adopted in any other Federation. In other countries, though varying
methods are adopted, the needs and resources of the States are kept in mind. In Canada the
comparatively small Federal grants made to the less populous provinces are at a higher rate per
head of population than those made to the more populous provinces; in the United States of
America federal assistance is greater per head of population in the rural and sparsely-settled
States than in the industrial and more populous States ; whilst in Switzerland the contributions
of the cantons to the Central Government are fixed with due regard to the wealth and taxation
resources of the various Cantons.
SOLUTION OF DIFFICULTIES.
Previous settlements of the financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and
the States were based on expediency. Now circumstances and the experience gained in 25 years
of Federation make it possible to follow sound principles. Though the Federal Parliament has full
authority to vary the present arrangements without the consent of the States, the Common-
wealth Government desires to adopt a plan which will be acceptable, not only to the Federal
Parliament, but also to the States.


A complete separation of Commonwealth and State finances accompanied by the
discontinuance of double taxation would provide an ideal solution on sound Federal principles.
Each Government would then raise all its own revenues and the States would be freed from reliance
on the Commonwealth for any financial help, either by way of general payments or special grants.
At present a solution on these lines is quite impracticable, because the States cannot
proceed with the development of Australia on a well-designed and properly-balanced plan without
Commonwealth co-operation and financial aid. The assistance given by the Commonwealth
must be proportionate to the special needs of the States, because the development of the States
and the taxable capacityof the people in the respective States vary greatly. The sparsely-populated
States are faced with developmental and domestic problems which are far more difficult- to them
than the problems facing the more populous States. At the same time the people of the sparsely-
populated and less-developed States have a lower taxable capacity than those of the other
States. The capitation system at present in existence only aggravates these difficulties by
giving to the less populous States proportionately less Commonwealth aid than their problems
justify.
The Commonwealth Government has now determined, because of these considerations,
to discontinue the capitation payments, and to adjust its financial relationships with the States
on the following basis.
COMMONWEALTH PROPOSALS.
As the nearest approach now practicable towards the ideal solution, the Federal
Government proposes:—
fl) That the Commonwealth and State finances be now separated as far as possible,
on the principle that, normally, indirect taxation is the proper field for the
Commonwealth and direct taxation the proper field for the States.
(2) That as a first step towards this ideal, the Commonwealth evacuate the field of
taxation of incomes of individuals.
(3) That the capitation payments now made to the States under the Surplus
Revenue Act be discontinued.
(4) That temporary financial assistance be given to _the States to prevent undue
dislocation of the State finances under the new arrangements.
(5) That for the development of the national resources, the Commonwealth give
financial assistance, without regard to State boundaries or population, in
special cases where proper and necessary development cannot otherwise be
secured.
These proposals offer a satisfactory basis for a definite and final determination of the
present unsound system of capitation payments with its accompanying duplication of income
taxes.
Under this new system the States are freed from reliance on the Commonwealth in
finance, and the Federal principle is thus strengthened. The Commonwealth and State taxation
fields are delimited, and duplication in income taxation and collection from individuals is
abolished. The States are given full possession of the greater part of what is generally
recognized to be the most elastic field of taxation—the income tax. Each Government becomes
directly responsible to its own taxpayers for the imposition of taxes for its own needs—an
arrangement which conduces to Government economy.
The Commonwealth has already greatly reduced its income taxes. It now collects
£7,140,682 less than if did in 1921-2. The reduction in amount represents 42 per cent., whilst
the collections per head of the population have been reduced by 47 per cent.


Besides reducing income taxes, the Commonwealth has reduced postal charges, the
entertainments tax, and the tax on crown leaseholds, the annual value of the remissions being—
Postal charges £1,000,000, entertainments tax £360,000, and tax on crown leaseholds £lOO,OOO.
The responsibility for the reduction of indirect taxation rests entirely on the
Commonwealth, which has exclusive powers of imposing Customs and Excise duties. In
1901-2, the amount per head of the Customs and Excise Revenue was £2 ss. 6d.; in 1912-3,
£3 ss. Bd.; whilst in 1925-6 the estimated yield is £6 4s. This year relief from Revenue
duties to the amount of £750,000 per annum has been granted. As soon as the finances permit,
the question of giving further similar relief must be faced. Further relief would directly benefit
national development and enable Australian industries better to compete in the oversea
markets. A reduction of Customs duties or the substitution of bounties, resulting in the
lowering of prices and the stimulation of production, might well prove to be of more benefit
to some of the States than an equal amount provided by way of Commonwealth subsidy to the
State,
These sound general principles determine the Commonwealth Government’s attitude in
formulating these proposals for the establishment of Commonwealth and State finances on a
proper basis. What is proposed is not intended as a scheme for taxation relief nor as a
plan for increasing taxes. The responsibility for the reduction or increase of taxation rests
directly on the several State Governments and on the Federal Government, and is not a
matter for consultation between Commonwealth and State representatives. The respective
Governments are directly responsible to their Parliaments and to their electors for balancing
their Budgets.
The association of taxation reduction with a scheme for putting the financial
relationships of the Commonwealth and the States on a proper basis would serve only to cloud
the important issues involved. With a proper delimitation of taxation activities, and with Federal
and State finances separated as far as possible, the question of relief from taxation would become
a simple issue, and the people of Australia would be in a position to judge what relief ought
reasonably to be sought from the State and the Federal tax-gatherers respectively.
DETAILS OF PROPOSALS.
The effect of these proposals on the finances of the Commonwealth and of the States
must now be considered in detail. The Commonwealth Government which acts for the whole of
Australia, is concerned both in putting its own finances on a sound footing and in solving the
problem on a basis which will not dislocate State finances.
The taxation of incomes of individuals is the field of taxation in which the States can
operate to make good the loss of Federal capitation payments. It is continually increasing and
is the most elastic in which Governments operate. WTiat the States take from the field will
depend on the taxes they impose. They may, for example, collect in this field sums exceeding
their losses of Federal capitation payments, or they may limit their new taxes so as to collect
less than the amount of the taxes surrendered by the Commonwealth.
The reductions in the yield of the Commonwealth tax on individuals in recent
years have resulted from reductions in the rates of tax and increases in the amount
of the exempt income. The field of taxation which the Commonwealth now evacuates yielded
£12,990,339 for 1920-21, £12,632,589 for 1921-22, £9,072,924 for 1922-23, £8,458,340 for 1923-
24, and £7,572,632 for 1924-25. The yield in the current year may be expected to be less than
that for 1924-5 because of the reduction of 12| per cent, in the rates of tax made during


1925-6. The yield will, however, not be 12£ per cent, less this year than it was last year
because the gross taxable incomes of the people increase as the result of increased population and
production. In the five years ended 30th June, 1924, the population increased at the average
annual rate of 2•? per cent., whilst the average annual rate of increase in the value of
production was 6*7 per cent. In 1924-5, population increased by 2.15 per cent, whilst
the value of production increased by 14 per cent. These varying rates of increase must
be considered in estimating the rate of increase in the taxable incomes. It is clear that,
with production increasing more quickly than population, we may expect the rate of. increase in
taxable incomes to exceed the rate of increase in population. On the other hand, production alone
cannot be adopted as a means of measuring the increase in taxable incomes. A reasonable
assumption on the figures is that the average annual rate of increase in taxable incomes is 6 per
cent. Figures are not available to show the rate of increase because of frequent alterations in
the taxation laws, the figures of any year therefore not being properly comparable with those of
other years.
Estimates have accordingly been made of the taxes which would be collected from
individuals at the present Federal rates. For this purpose, the actual yield of the Commonwealth
income tax on individuals for 1924-5 has been taken as a base, allowance has been made for the
reduction of 12| per cent, effected this year in the rates of the Federal tax, and for an average
annual growth of 6 per cent, in the taxable incomes. On this basis, the yield of the tax for
1925-6 would be 7|- per cent, less than the yield for 1924-5. On the other hand, the Common-
wealth Statistician anticipates that, allowing for increased production, the averaging of incomes,
and the reduction in the rate of the tax, the Commonwealth will collect, in respect of 1925-6,
only 4 per cent, less than it collected in respect of 1924-5. It is evident, therefore, that the
Commonwealth estimates of the expected yield of the Federal Income tax have been prepared
on a conservative basis.
As portion of the Federal income tax is collected by the Central Taxation Office and
the exact amount thereof attributable to each State is not available, the collections of the Central
Taxation Office have been divided amongst the States in proportion to population.
On the basis indicated the yield of the Commonwealth tax on individuals, at the
rates now applying, may be set down at £7,023,616 for 1925-6, £7,445,034 for 1926-7, £7,891,736
for 1927-8, and £8,365,240 for 1928-9. These amounts have been apportioned amongst the
States on the basis of the actual collections in each State during the last five years after
allowing for the distribution of the Central Office collections on a population basis.
In addition to surrendering this field of taxation, the Commonwealth proposes to make
special grants to the States, designed to ease the State finances during the period required for the
adjustment of the State taxation laws. The proposed grants are :
1926- £970,000
1927- •. .. 600,000
1928- .. .. .. .. 400,000
For 1926-7, the position will be that the Commonwealth will surrender a tax field
in which it expected to collect £7,445,034, and will pay the States £970,000, a total of
£8,415,034. At the same time, the Commonwealth will discontinue the Surplus Revenue Act
payments which, if continued on the present basis, would total £7,687,500 in 1926-7.
Thus the loss to the Commonwealth revenues and the gain to the taxpayers of the States
may be estimated at £727,534 for 1926-7. For 1927-8, this loss to the Commonwealth
revenues and gain to the State taxpayers may be estimated at £651,736, whilst in 1928-9 the
amount may be set down at £767,740.

It is proposed to allot the grants as follow :
This allocation has been arranged so as to give each State a margin of approximately
£lOO,OOO in the first and £50,000 in the second year, whilst in the third year the aim has been to give
sufficient grants to protect the States from loss.
As the States will forfeit the regular monthly payments now made to them under the
Surplus Revenue Act and will receive in lieu thereof income taxes collectable mainly in the closing
months of the year, the Commonwealth Government is prepared to make arrangements to prevent
the dislocation of State finances which otherwise would occur. To this end, the Commonwealth
will make advances to the States pending the collection of the State taxes, such advances to be
repayable as the taxes are collected.
The amounts for Western Australia and Tasmania, as shown above, do not include any
special financial assistance which may be granted to those States by the Commonwealth
in respect of their claims for payments beyond those provided for in the Surplus Revenue Act
1910. The question of special assistance to be given to Western Australia and Tasmania will
be settled by the Commonwealth and the two States concerned. This does not affect the
settlement of the general financial relationships of the Commonwealth and the States as a
whole, and is dealt with in separate memoranda which have been forwarded to the respective
States.
The effect of these proposals may be estimated as under :

FEDERAL AID IN OTHER DIRECTIONS.
A settlement of this problem on the lines indicated is of special importance at the
present time because under existing conditions Australia is not being developed rapidly enough
nor are the States in a position to provide for its development under a well-balanced scheme.
Federal aid is essential for Migration, Main Roads, National Insurance, Health, Science and
Industry, Unification of Railways, and for other purposes. Facing these problems, it is necessary
first to stabilize the Federal finances and to free the Commonwealth from the burden of
raising revenue for the purpose of making huge payments to the States on an inequitable
basis. In 1910, the growing needs of the Commonwealth led to an adjustment of its financial
relations with the States which involved a reduction of £3,296,012 in the Commonwealth
subsidies. Now, however, the Commonwealth, though faced with great financial responsibilities
for the national development, and though still carrying the burden of £29,000,000 of war charges
offers a settlement which will not disturb State finances. In fact, the surrender of the taxation
of individuals coupled with the assistance the Commonwealth offers in other directions should
enable the States to look forward with confidence to better financial conditions. Every
Commonwealth project for developing Australia’s resources must in the end re-act favorably
on the finances of the States. Besides directly relieving the States of portion of the expenditure
which under other conditions would be borne solely by them, indirect benefits must accrue to
the States under the Commonwealth proposals in regard to Migration, Main Roads, National
Insurance, Health, Science and Industry, and Unification of Railways.
Under the migration scheme the Commonwealth provides organizations in Great
Britain and in Australia for the selection and reception of migrants, grants assisted passages to
Australia, aids in the establishment and upkeep of training farms, and agrees with the British
Government to lend £34,000,000 to the States at the rate of 1 per cent, per annum for five years
and one third of the cost for a further five years. The annual charges to the Commonwealth
Revenue for the purposes of this scheme may within a short period be expected to reach
£300,000, and ultimately the charges will be heavier. This scheme must benefit the States in
many directions, and will directly and indirectly relieve the States’ finances. The unsatisfactory
position of Migration in recent years, which cannot be allowed to continue, is the strongest
evidence of the need for Commonwealth assistance on a generous scale and in accordance with a
well-balanced plan.
Under the sole direction of the States, there has not been developed a comprehensive
main roads plan such as is necessary for facilitating the economical transport of products and
for opening up undeveloped lands. Commonwealth aid for main roads has been given for some
years, but our needs have now become so urgent that the Commonwealth Government has
decided to stimulate State action by the grant of £20,000,000 for main roads over a period of
ten years. Whereas the payments this year are estimated at £750,000, the new scheme provides
for grants totalling £2,000,000 per annum for the next ten years. Every State benefits largely
under the scheme, as will be seen from the following table: —


Besides assisting the States by providing a great proportion of the cost of establishing main roads,
the Commonwealth grants are calculated to aid in lowering the expenses of production and of
marketing, and the State finances should indirectly benefit as the result of the increased prosperity
which should follow.
The greatest transportation difficulty in Australia arises from the adoption of varying
railway gauges in the different States. This problem is annually becoming more difficult of
solution. A fact which stands out clearly is that, owing to the magnitude of the task, the
disabilities of the present system cannot be overcome without substantial Commonwealth
assistance. In conjunction with the New South Wales and Queensland Governments, the
Commonwealth has already made arrangements for a railway of the standard gauge from Grafton
to Brisbane. To provide this railway, linking up the capitals of New South Wales and Queensland
on the standard gauge, the Commonwealth has agreed to bear annual charges which, on the
completion of the line, are estimated to amount to £130,000. This is the first step in a scheme
for a system of uniform gauge railways connecting the main centres in the several States, and
the Commonwealth proposes to go on with the work in co-operation with the States as the finances
permit.
Another project upon which the Commonwealth is about to embark is that of the
provision of a national scheme of social insurance. Heavy financial responsibilities must be
faced by the Commonwealth in connexion with the scheme. A proper system of national
insurance, however, will improve the conditions of workers generally, will relieve the States of
some of their present responsibilities towards their citizens and, by bringing about better
conditions, will indirectly benefit the States.
The report of the Royal Commission on public health shows the urgent need for
co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States in a national policy designed to secure
a higher standard of public health in Australia. Until recently the responsibility for public
health was left entirely to the States, but it is now generally recognised that satisfactory progress
has not been made, and that, as recommended by the Royal Commission, Commonwealth aid
in this matter is necessary.
With a view to promoting efficiency in our primary and secondary industries on the
most scientific lines, the Commonwealth Institute of Science and Industry is now being re-organized.
Though this re-organization involves increased Commonwealth expenditure, the benefits to be
derived from the proper application of science to industry clearly justify the Commonwealth
proposals.
It will be seen that in all these national questions the Commonwealth is faced with
heavier financial responsibilities, that satisfactory progress cannot be secured without Common-
wealth aid, and that, directly 'or indirectly, the finances of the States will benefit as the
result of the increased Commonwealth assistance and the increased prosperity of the people.
A progressive Commonwealth policy in all these matters is in a large measure dependent on a
sound settlement of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States, and the benefits
accruing to the States in the directions indicated cannot be overlooked in considering the effect
on the States of the Commonwealth proposals for an adjustment of the direct financial
relationships.
TAXATION OF INTEREST ON LOANS.
The interest on all Commonwealth loans issued in Australia since 1918 and the interest
on all State loans issued in Australia since Ist January, 1924, is subject to Commonwealth income
tax, but is free of State income taxes. When the loans were issued, the rates of interest payable
were fixed with regard to these conditions in relation to taxation. Unless some special provision


is made when the Commonwealth discontinues the taxation of incomes of individuals, no tax
will be payable in respect of these loans because only the States will be imposing taxes on incomes
of individuals, and the States cannot impose taxes on these loans during their currency.
The Commonwealth proposes, though giving up the taxation of incomes of
individuals, specially to tax the interest on Commonwealth and State loans which are subject
to Commonwealth tax.
The Commonwealth does not propose to retain this tax for its own purposes, but
will pay an equivalent amount to the States.
AGGREGATION OF INCOMES.
In previous discussions regarding the discontinuance of Federal income taxes, the
States have expressed the belief that, under State laws, there would be a reduction in the yield
of income taxes even if they re-imposed taxes at the rates which previously had been in force
under Federal laws. The contention is that, in a case where a taxpayer derives income from more
than one State, each State could base its rate of tax only on the income received within its borders,
whereas the Commonwealth now bases the rate of tax on the total income in all States.
After due examination the Commonwealth finds that the additional taxation secured
by it through the aggregation of incomes derived from more than one State is not substantial
In any case whatever taxation is at 'stake can certainly be collected, and no loss need fall on the
States in this connexion. The States themselves could require a taxpayer deriving income from
other States, to give particulars of that income in his annual return, and the total income could
then be taken into account for the purpose of determining what rate of tax should be applied
to the income earned within the State.
CONCLUSION.
The financial position of the Commonwealth and the States is now fundamentally different
from that existing on the establishment of federation.
At that time it was impracticable to separate the taxation fields so as to give the Common-
wealth control only of the revenue it required. In the result the Commonwealth had revenue beyond
its needs, and paid the excess revenue to the States.
To-day the taxation fields can be separated without undue disturbance of either State or
Commonwealth finances.
The considered view of the Commonwealth Government is that it has now become clear that,
except in special cases, the system of subsidies to the States should be discontinued so that the
responsibility for raising revenue should be placed upon the authority which spends the money.
It is recognized that the problem to be solved is difficult. It must, however, be solved in the
interests of both Commonwealth and States. It is most desirable that the solution should be reached
by agreement, and it is with that object that the Commonwealth Government, instead of proceeding
direct to legislative action, invites the States to give these proposals their most careful consideration.


COMMONWEALTH PROPOSALS FOR REMEDYING THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF
WESTERN AUSTRALIA.
The requests of Western Australia and Tasmania for financial assistance from the
Commonwealth raise important questions with regard to the basis upon which such assistance
should be given to a State.
In the first place, Western Australia and Tasmania make claims upon the Commonwealth
upon the grounds that their States have suffered disabilities from federation.
In considering this matter it must be recognized that the Commonwealth cannot assume
responsibility for the varying degrees of prosperity and development of the several States arising
from their geographical situation.
It has not been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Commonwealth Government that
federation has substantially depreciated the position of Western Australia and Tasmania
compared with what their position would have been if federation had not taken place. On the
other hand, it cannot be denied that there are advantages due to federation which must in fairness
be set off against the alleged disadvantages.
The Commonwealth Government is satisfied that it is not possible to estimate in terms of
money on a proper balance of account the alleged federal disabilities. The position, however,
remains that the finances of Western Australia and Tasmania are in a serious condition, and that
the whole of the Commonwealth is interested in securing and maintaining the dignity and stability
of each of the States.
In order to deal with the question satisfactorily, it is necessary in the first place to lay
down the general principle that the mere fact that a particular State has had a deficit or indeed
a series of deficits for a number of years is not in itself a sufficient ground for granting federal
assistance. If the contrary principle were once admitted it would be an invitation to a system
of reckless and irresponsible finance. In the second place, it is essential to consider the causes of
the financial difficulties so far as such causes can be discovered.
The mere making of a money grant is not a solution of the problem. Such a grant is
in effect contributed by the several States of the Commonwealth, and it is proper for the
Commonwealth Government to consider the obvious fact that the mere granting of money, far
from removing the causes of the trouble, may in fact increase them. The true principle,
therefore, is to discover the causes of the financial difficulties and to seek to provide means for
their removal. If, for example, the difficulties are due to a condition of arrested development
the essential problem is to determine how development may be promoted, in order that
increased production may lighten the burden of taxation, and render further enterprise possible.
It is from this point of view that the requests of Western Australia and Tasmania have been
approached by the Commonwealth Government.
PAST FINANCIAL RELATIONS OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA WITH THE
COMMONWEALTH.
When the question of federation was discussed at various conventions prior to 1900, it
was clearly recognized that Western Australia must receive special financial treatment. The
framers of the Constitution accordingly provided that Western Australia should retain her own
Customs tariff for a period of five years. Further security was provided for ten years by the
bookkeeping provisions of the Constitution. When those provisions were superseded by the
per capita payments in 1910-11, special provision was again made for Western Australia. On
that occasion it took the form of a grant of £250,000, reducing annually by £lO,OOO. This grant
was made because the contributions of Western Australia to the Customs and Excise revenue
were much greater per head of population than the average of the other States.


Under the new arrangement, Western Australia, even with the assistance of the special
grant, did not receive the sums she expected. This was due to her population failing to increase
at the same rate as for previous years. The decline of the gold-mining industry, together with
the war, not only interfered with her growth, but, in addition, brought about losses of revenue
on the railways and elsewhere. As a result the deficit, which commenced in 1911-12, continued
to grow to a very large sum.
For several years past representations have been made that Western Australia has suffered
severely under federation. The Commonwealth Government accordingly appointed a Royal
Commission in 1924 “ to inquire into and report upon the effect of federation upon the financial
position of the State of Western Australia, and as to any special financial disability suffered by
that State as a result of federation which is not suffered by the other States of the Commonwealth,
and to recommend what steps should be taken to remedy such financial disability, if any,
suffered by that State,”
REPORT OF THE ROYAL COMMISSION.
The Western Australian Government appointed a special committee to represent its
disabilities to the Royal Commission. That committee submitted a series of claims for definite
losses said to have arisen from specific acts of the Commonwealth. Several other charges were
made against federation of a less tangible nature for which no estimate of losses was given. Claims
were submitted for compensation for definite losses to 1924. A claim was also made for an annual
grant as compensation for continuing disabilities.
Claims for definite losses were made in respect of—
(i) loss to Western Australian gold producers through acquisition of gold output by
Commonwealth during war time at pre-war prices;
(ii) loss to State railway and water supply revenue through decline of gold mining
industry brought about by such acquisition and by the high Customs tariff ;
(iii) loss to State revenue through diminution of dividend duty resulting from the
decline of the gold-mining industry ;
(iv) loss to State revenue owing to per capita payments falling short of anticipated
sums which led the representatives of Western Australia to sign the financial
agreement of 1909;
(v) loss to State revenue through payment of surplus Commonwealth revenue into
trust funds for old-age pensions and other purposes;
(vi) loss resulting from competition of the Commonwealth Savings Bank with that
of the State.
Claims (i) to (v) inclusive were rejected by a unanimous decision of the Royal Commission.
Claim (vi) was also rejected by a majority decision.
Of the other charges of a less tangible nature put forward as disabilities due to federation
the principal were these: —
(i) that Western Australia’s ability to carry out developmental works diminished
with entry into federation and the diminution was due to such entry;
(ii) that deficits have been general since the termination of the “bookkeeping” period
and have accumulated to a large figure ;
(iii) that the federal high Customs tariff is a very bad policy for Western Australia, since
it imposes heavy burdens on agricultural and pastoral industries ;
(iv) that these industries in the Eastern States are not affected to the same extent
because there the country fit for such purposes was taken up and developed
before the imposition of the tariff ;
(v) that since federation Western Australian secondary industries have had a hopeless
struggle against established secondary industries of the Eastern States;


(vi) that inadequate assistance has been received in respect of land settlement and
immigration ;
(vii) that the State has reached the end of its resources and can no longer carry out a
policy of development without assistance.
Further statements were also made to indicate disabilities of a general nature, viz. :
(i) Owing to her immense area, Western Australia has a rate of expenditure per head
very much higher than the Australian average.
(ii) The carrying out of the immigration and settlement policy of the State has been
the chief cause of her deficit.
(iii) Western Australia has spent £3,700,000 in the north to secure the safety of
Australia.
(iv) It is not possible for Western Australia to raise further revenue from her own
citizens by taxation.
In its request for an annual grant the official case did not mention any specific sum.
Subsequently the Assistant Under-Treasurer of Western Australia, in his capacity as State
representative to the Royal Commission, submitted the suggestion that the continuing disabilities
could best be met by a special grant equal to £1 per head. This suggestion involved the payment
of an annual sum commencing at approximately £360,000, beyond the provisions of the Surplus
Revenue Act which prescribed the present diminishing grant.
The Royal Commission failed to agree both as to the nature of Western Australia’s
disabilities and as to the remedies to be applied. One member expressed the conviction that
secession was the only remedy for the present disabilities of Western Australia. As an
alternative to secession, he joined wth another member in a majority recommendation
that Western Australia should be granted her own Customs and Excise tariff and
that, pending such tariff being conceded, Western Australia should receive a special grant
of £450,000 per annum. The third member strongly opposed a separate Customs and Excise
tariff and recommended an annual grant of £300,000 for ten years. In both recommendations
the grants proposed were made subject to the discontinuance of the present diminishing grant.
No data were furnished to show the precise manner in which the amounts of the grant were arrived
at. Neither is there a clear statement of the special disabilities suffered by Western Australia
not suffered by the other States.
The Commonwealth Government made a temporary grant to Western Australia of £450,000
during 1925-26, subject to a deduction of the present special grant.
INVESTIGATION BY THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT.
The Commonwealth Government has since investigated the whole position. Asa result
it is of opinion that the claims of injury by federation put forward on behalf of Western Australia
were overstated. It believes that the prosperity of the people of Western Australia under
federation compares most favorably with that of other States. This is evidenced by the
phenomenal growth of its agricultural industries since federation, as set out later. Nevertheless
the Commonwealth Government believes that the State finances of Western Australia have suffered
a heavy burden due partly to —(i) the disorganization of the war, (ii) the decline of the gold-mining
industry, and (iii) the large extent of its territory.
The disabilities arising from the war are common to all States, and Western Australia is
now suffering no greater burden in that respect than other parts of Australia.
The decline of the mining industry unquestionably brought about temporary financial
embarrassment. That decline was accompanied by a change-over to agriculture. During the
period of transition, the general position of the State finances was adversely affected. In
particular, railway revenue suffered heavy losses, which were largely reflected in the increasing
deficits. The change-over from mining to agriculture, the principal industry, has now been
successfully accomplished, and material prosperity has rapidly increased,in the past few years.


The position of the railways has improved, and the annual railway deficits have been converted
into surpluses. With further assistance to the agricultural industry, which will be afforded by
the migration and other national developmental policies of the Commonwealth, this progress
should continue.
WESTERN AUSTRALIAN PROGRESS UNDER FEDERATION.
In population, Western Australia increased from 180,000 at federation to 372,000 at the
end of 1925. This represents an increase of 3 per cent, per annum as compared with an average
for the rest of Australia of I*B per cent., and is prima facie evidence of material progress under
federation. A review of statistics affords further evidence of that progress.
Agriculture. —At the commencement of federation the area under crop in Western
Australia was I*l acres per head of population as compared with an Australian average of
2*3 acres. In 1924 this area had grown to 6*6 acres per head of population as compared with
an average of 2‘9 acres per head for all Australia. The area under wheat increased from
75.000 acres in 1900- 01 to 2,000,000 acres in 1925-26.
Pastoral. —Cattle in Western Australia increased from 339,000 in 1900 to 892,000 in 1924 ;
sheep from 2,400,000 in 1900 to 6,400,000 in 1924. Western Australia has at present 2*5 cattle
and 17*6 sheep per head of population compared with 2*3 cattle and 15*3 sheep per head for
Australia as a whole. In wool production for 1924-25 Western Australia produced 119 lb. per
head of population compared with 118 lb. per head for Australia as a whole.
Farmyard and Dairy Production. —Western Australia has been backward in this field,
but there has been a marked advance in recent years. Butter production increased from
500.000 lb. in 1913 to 3,000,000 lb. in 1924, and dairy cattle from 18,000 in 1913 to 39,000 in
1923.
Forestry. —Western Australia has a larger total output of timber than any other State
except New South Wales.
Factories. —Satisfactory data are not available prior to 1907. In that year, Western
Australia had 12,625 hands employed in factories as compared with 21,754 in 1924. These
figures show an increase from 5 per cent, of the population in 1907 to 6 per cent, of the
population in 1924. In the same period Australia’s proportion employed in factories increased
from 6 per cent, in 1907 to 7*4 per cent, in 1924. Increase in employment in factories in
Western Australia in relation to population has been in evidence during the period under review,
but the proportion is not so great nor is the increase so rapid as in other States.
Summary. —These facts clearly indicate that, in the period of federation, there has been
considerable progress in Western Australia which in many respects is more substantial than the
Australian average.
PRESENT DIFFICULTIES.
The present difficulties of Western Australia arise from the large extent of its territory and
from the burden of a heavy deficit, amounting to over £6,000,000. There is no doubt the
combination of extensive area and relatively small population tends to make all administrative
functions more costly per head of population than is the case in a more compact community.
The area of Western Australia is approximately one-third of Australia. In the case
presented to the Royal Commission by the Honorable Norbert Keenan on behalf of the Western
Australian Government, it was stated that the proper development of this large area was a task
beyond the resources of the present population of Western Australia. It is in this respect that
the Commonwealth Government sees a real need for assistance. That assistance is already being
afforded by the migration and other Commonwealth developmental policies. Under these
policies proposals will be introduced for assisting development in the southern areas. There
still remains the large tropical territory commonly known as the North-West.
F. 7376.—2


THE NORTH-WEST.
The large territory of Western Australia north of the 26th parallel of south latitude
contains about 528,000 square miles. Its population is less than 6,000, and is practically
stationary. In the development of this territory, Western Australia has expended loan
moneys amounting to approximately £2,700,000. It has also incurred losses up to 30th June,
1924, of £998,296 in connexion with railways, meat works and shipping services. The Honorable
Herbert Keenan, when presenting evidence to the Royal Commission on behalf of the
Government of Western Australia, stated that the services now rendered to the North-West
fell far short of what, was necessary if settlement were to progress. He also said that the burden
of rendering these services fell entirely on Western Australia, and that the resources of that
State were incapable of standing further strain in this regard.
The annual burden on the State finances of Western Australia, arising from the administration
of this territory, appears to exceed £150,000. This position prevents the proper development of
the North-West. The annual charge thus resulting from the present position of the North-West
impedes the development of the southern parts of the State, and the failure to adequately develop
both the North-West and the South reflects on the whole of the Commonwealth.
In the interests of both national and Western Australian development the Commonwealth
Government believes that the soundest policy is for the Commonwealth to assume the responsibility
for the development of this large territory. The Commonwealth Government is, therefore,
prepared to take over the whole of this territory and all Government assets therein, the con-
sideration to the State being that the Commonwealth Government assumes liability for the capital
indebtedness of approximately £2,700,000 of loan moneys expended in development in this
territory.
DEFICIT.
The outstanding difficulty that remains is the deficit, and if this can be overcome the
future of the Government finances of Western Australia can be assured.
On 30th June, 1925, the accumulated deficit stood at £6,200,000. This large sum
commenced to accrue in 1911-12. With the advent of war and the continued decline of the
gold-mining industry its growth was rapid. On 30th June, 1922, it stood at £5,500,000. Since
then the annual losses have decreased. Associated with the growth of the deficit is the position
of the railways. During the decline of the gold-mining industry and the change-over to
agriculture the railways showed heavy losses. In 1920-21 the loss was £450,000; since then
there has been a rapid improvement, and the railways are now self-supporting. Substantial
losses also arose from the gold-fields water supply.
It is recognized that Western Australia possesses a large sinking fund, and it is the aim of
the Commonwealth to encourage such provision. To the extent of about £3,000,000 the sinking
funds of Western Australia have resulted from a heavy but wise provision against gold-field
undertakings. In this they afford a substantial reserve against the losses that have resulted
from the decline of the gold-mining industry.
Though the financial position generally has improved, Western Australia is still faced with
the burden of past deficits. Unless relief is provided, this burden must remain a drag on her
resources and impede her progress. The Commonwealth Government believes that, if Western
Australia were relieved of this burden for a period, the State finances could be readily and
permanently stabilized. The Commonwealth Government accordingly offers to take over, for a
period of five years, the liability for payment of interest and sinking fund on a fixed amount of
£5,000,000. Under this proposal Western Australia will be relieved of an annual charge of
approximately £300,000 for a period of five years. At the end of that period the position will be
reviewed.


CONCLUSION.
It has already been shown that the present difficulties of Western Australia arise from two
categories, viz., (i) the deficit, and (ii) the large extent of its territory.
In the proposal now submitted the State finances of Western Australia will be considerably
benefited. The portion of the proposal affecting the deficit has the one and only objective of
relieving the present burden. With this relief the State finances can be placed on an assured
basis.
The offer to take over the North-West is primarily for the purpose of development. At the
same time it will immediately relieve the State finances of more than £150,000 per annum. In
addition the State Government will be freed from the responsibility of developing this huge
territory. Western Australia will thus be able to direct all its energies and resources to the
development of the southern parts of the State and the difficulties of the North-West will be faced
by the Commonwealth.
Towards the development of the southern parts further substantial assistance will be
obtained from the migration and other national developmental policies of the Commonwealth.
Summarized, the assistance which the Commonwealth now offers to Western Australia is
as follows :
£
(i) Relief from annual expenditure of the North-west, estimated at .. 150,000
(ii) Relief from interest and sinking fund on the deficit, estimated at .. 300,000
450,000
Less present diminishing grant, which will now cease .. .. 90,000
Net gain in 1926-27 .. .. .. 360,000
This net gain will increase annually by £lO,OOO in the succeeding four years, as the
present special grant of £90,000 in 1926-27 is subject to an annual deduction of £lO,OOO under
the provisions of the Surplus Revenue Act. In the fifth year the net gain will thus be
approximately £400,000.
The total assistance now offered substantially agrees with the amount suggested by the
representative of the State Government to the Royal Commission. The proposed relief from the
burden of the deficit is limited to a period of five years. The Commonwealth Government believes
that a progressive developmental policy may by that time enable Western Australia to adjust its
finances so as to render further assistance unnecessary.


COMMONWEALTH PROPOSALS FOR REMEDYING THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF
TASMANIA.
The requests of Tasmania and Western Australia for financial assistance from the
Commonwealth raise important questions with regard to the basis upon which such assistance
should be given to a State.
In the first place Tasmania and Western Australia make claims upon the Commonwealth
upon the ground that their States have suffered disabilities from federation.
In considering this matter it must be recognized that the Commonwealth cannot assume
responsibility for the varying degrees of prosperity and development of the several States arising
from their geographical situation.
It has not been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Commonwealth Government that
federation has substantially depreciated the position of these States compared with what their
position would have been if federation had not taken place. On the other hand it cannot be
denied that there are advantages due to federation which must in fairness be set off against the
alleged disadvantages.
The Commonwealth Government is satisfied that it is not possible to estimate in terms
of money on a proper balance of account the alleged federal disabilities. The position, however,
remains that the finances of Tasmania and Western Australia are in a serious condition, and that
the whole of the Commonwealth is interested in securing and maintaining the dignity and
stability of each of the States.
In order to deal with the question satisfactorily, it is necessary in the first place to lay
down the general principle that the mere fact that a particular State has had a deficit or indeed
a series of deficits for a number of years is not in itself a sufficient ground for granting federal
assistance. If the contrary principle were once admitted, it would be an invitation to a system
of reckless and irresponsible finance. In the second place it is essential to consider the causes
of the financial difficulties so far as such causes can be discovered.
The mere making of a money grant is not a solution of the problem. Such a grant is
in effect contributed by the several States of the Commonwealth, and it is proper for the
Commonwealth Government to consider the obvious fact that the mere granting of money, far
from removing the causes of the trouble, may in fact increase them. The true principle,
therefore, is to discover the causes of the financial difficulties and to seek to provide means for
their removal. If, for example, the difficulties are due to a condition of arrested development,
the essential problem is to determine how development may be promoted in order that
increased production may lighten the burden of taxation and render further enterprise possible.
It is from this point of view that the requests of Tasmania and Western Australia have
been approached by the Commonwealth Government.
PAST FINANCIAL RELATIONS OF TASMANIA WITH THE COMMONWEALTH.
The financial position of the Government of Tasmania has been unsatisfactory for some
years. During the first ten years of federation, when the bookkeeping provisions of the
constitution were in operation, Tasmania maintained that she did not receive the surplus
revenue to which she was entitled. It was claimed that customs procedure gave Victoria
benefits at the expense of Tasmania.
Since the bookkeeping provisions were superseded by “ per capita ” payments in 1910-11,
Tasmania has not derived the same progressive advantages as other States from the general
total increase of this payment, owing to the fact that her population has not increased at the
same rate as that of other States.
In 1912, a Royal Commission was appointed, which recommended a grant of £900,000
to be distributed over ten years ending 30th June, 1922. This recommendation was adopted
by the Commonwealth. A further grant of £85,000 per annum was continued until 1923-4.


Since 1922, successive Premiers of Tasmania have made appeals to the Commonwealth
Government for further special consideration. These appeals took the form of requests for an
annual grant of practically £200,000 per annum for a varying period of years, it being stated
that such a grant would secure the stability of the State finances.
In 1924, the Commonwealth Government again dealt with the position of Tasmania. It
surrendered to Tasmania the Commonwealth tax on lottery prizes which amounted to £lll,OOO
per annum. A special grant of £85,000, diminishing annually by £17,000, was also made, thus
giving to Tasmania for 1924—5 £196,000, which was practically the £200,000 then said to be
necessary to place her finances in a sound position.
PRESENT REQUEST FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.
Within eighteen months of the receipt of that assistance, Tasmania now asks for a grant
of £545,000 for ten years. This, added to the tax of £lll,OOO on lottery prizes already surrendered
by the Commonwealth, would be equivalent to a grant of £656,000 a year for ten years.
The following grounds for this request have been put forward in the official “ Case for
Tasmania ”: —
(i) that debt and interest liabilities have increased notwithstanding increased taxa-
tion ;
(ii) that continuance of abnormal taxation imperils maintenance of production and of
the revenue the taxation is designed to secure ;
(iii) that Tasmania has a taxable capacity per head much below the other States ;
(iv) that since federation many industries have closed down and others are languishing ;
(v) that owing to all Tasmania’s interstate trade being by sea, the high freights caused
by the Navigation Act are proportionately more severe on Tasmania than on
the other States ;
(vi) that taxation by means of the tariff is more severe on Tasmania than direct taxa-
tion, which is graduated in proportion to ability to pay ;
(vii) that since the advent of federation departures from Tasmania have exceeded
arrivals by 38,000 persons ;
(viii) that loss of population by migration was due to (a) high taxation ; ( b ) low exemp-
tions ; (c) lack of employment; (d) improved industrial conditions and better
educational facilities on the mainland ;
(ix) that while Tasmania shares the cost of protection she does not share equally in
the benefits ;
(x) that as the result of the State’s financial position the standard of living is much
lower than that of the larger and more prosperous States ;
(xi) that the causes of the financial and economic disabilities which have contributed
to Tasmania’s need for assistance are intimately associated with federation..
REPORT OF SIR NICHOLAS LOCKYER.
The Commonwealth Government appointed Sir Nicholas Lockyer to investigate the claims
made. His report indicated that there had been a general financial slackness in the administra-
tion of Tasmania’s internal affairs. He arrived at the conclusion that there had been inefficiency
and consequent lack of development in connexion with primary industries, especially agricultural
and pastoral pursuits, and quoted evidence that much of the depression in such industries
was due to soil exhaustion. He reprobated pessimism on the part of leaders of Tasmanian opinion
and suggested many directions in which reforms to increase production and improve efficiency
might be introduced. He made certain recommendations of a financial nature which in the
majority of instances involved Commonwealth supervision over Tasmanian administration and
finance.


The Commonwealth Government recognizes that there are weighty objections to the assump-
tion by the Commonwealth of any general control over the finances of a State, and it is not now
proposed that specific conditions should be imposed upon Tasmania in connexion with any
financial assistance. It will depend upon events whether such control may become necessary in
the interest of the general credit of Australia.
INVESTIGATION BY THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT.
The Commonwealth Government has now carefully examined the case presented by
Tasmania, and the report by Sir Nicholas Lockyer. As stated above, it has been claimed on
behalf of Tasmania that the State is subject to special disabilities arising from federation. The
Government has considered the matter carefully, but has come to the conclusion that the disabilities
suggested have not been shown by evidence to produce, on a balance of account, any definite
damage measurable in terms of money, that Tasmania’s present position is largely due to
internal rather than to external causes, and that these disabilities are in a great measure remediable
by local effort. It is satisfied from its general -examination that the leaders of public opinion in
Tasmania are unduly pessimistic in their outlook and utterances. It seems clear that the natural
advantages of Tasmania—its climate, its soil,’ its mineral resources, and water power—present
opportunities for a progressive developmental policy.
An examination of the most recent case submitted by Tasmania shows that the figures
quoted in support of the request for £545,000 from the Commonwealth are obviously overstated.
That amount is arrived at thus—
£
Estimated deficit for 1925-26 .. .. .. ~ .. 100,000
Additional sum which it is claimed should be charged to revenue .. 247,000
Amount required for relief of taxation .. .. .. .. 130,000
Amount of present special grant .. .. .. .. .. 68,000
Total subsidy required for 1926-27 and future years .. .. 545,000
Estimated Deficit for 1925-26, £loo,ooo.—The Budget estimate for 1925-26 made by the
Treasurer of Tasmania was a deficit of £62,000. It is now, however, stated by Tasmanian
advocates that this will reach £lOO,OOO, and will continue at that rate for future years. The
only ground alleged for this statement is “continued depression.”
Additional Charges to Revenue, £247,ooo.—This is made up of the following sums, which
it is now claimed should be charged to revenue in 1926-27 and subsequent years :
£
(i) Returned soldier settlement—estimated further losses .. .. 83,000
(ii) Provision for railway renewals and replacements .. .. .. 52,300
(iii) Interest on deficit to be funded, £564,870 .. .. .. .. 28,000
(iv) Sinking Fund, 5 per cent, on deficit funded and to be funded—
£9l4,27l 45,713
(v) Instalment to make good loss on loan to Tasmania Smelting Company,
£17,645 .. .. .. .. .. .. 4,000
(vi) Instalments for meeting sundry “ deferred ” charges .. .. 4,002
(vii) Depreciation, &c., Hydro-electric Works (balance) .. .. .. 18,892
’ (viii) Reduction in revenue under the “ Traffic Act ” .. .. .. 11,000
246,907
Item (i). This appears to be a claim that the Commonwealth should bear practically
the whole loss on soldier land settlement in Tasmania. At the outset of repatriation it was agreed
that these losses should be shared by the Commonwealth and the States. The Commonwealth’s


share of such losses was in the form of rebates and concessions of interest which were granted
over a period of years. Land settlement is essentially a State function, the immediate benefits
of which accrue to the States. The Commonwealth interest in soldier settlement arose from its
desire to provide for the repatriation of the soldiers in the States as a whole. Under the
arrangement agreed to by the States approximately half of the loss falls on the States and half
on the Commonwealth. In Tasmania, losses have arisen from interest concessions to the soldiers,
bad debts, and excessive valuations. Towards the losses the Commonwealth is contributing
to Tasmania £273,000 in rebates of interest, and is also writing off £262,000 from the loan due
by Tasmania as from October, 1925. The Commonwealth has also intimated its intention
to reduce its interest charges to the States, as from Ist January, 1931, from an average of 6| per
cent., which is the rate the Commonwealth paid for the money, to 5 per cent., irrespective of the
market rate.
Item {ii). —For the past few years £13,333 has been set aside annually from revenue for
railway renewal purposes. It is now proposed to supplement that provision by a further sum
of £52,300 at the expense of the Commonwealth.
Item {Hi). —A deficit of £564,870 is to be shortly funded. This deficit had accrued prior
to 30th June, 1925. It has been temporarily provided from the General Loan Fund, and
interest is already being charged to the revenue accounts of 1925-26. Despite this fact, it is now
claimed that the “ funding ” of this sum will create an additional burden of £28,000 in 1926-27
and subsequent years.
Items {iv and v). —lt is proposed to write off a revenue deficit of £914,000 by a special
sinking fund of 5 per cent, instead of the usual rate of one-half per cent. Another loss of
£17,645 is now proposed to be written off within four and a half years. These losses come
within the category of non-productive debt. If a sinking fund were provided on the same basis
as is now provided for other Tasmanian debt of that character, the annual charge would be
about £5,000 instead of £49,713 as proposed.
Item (vii).— A subsidy of £18,892 per annum for ten years is requested to make good
the annual loss on the hydro-electric works. This seems unjustifiable in view of the opinion
expressed by the manager of the works to Sir Nicholas Lockyer that this undertaking will be
self-supporting within two years.
The Commonwealth Government, after a full consideration of the figures submitted on
behalf of Tasmania, is clearly of the opinion that the position has been overstated, though it
recognizes that there are difficulties to be faced by Tasmania.
The Commonwealth Government, however, is not satisfied that a mere grant of a sum
of money is the true remedy for Tasmania’s position. What it desires to do is to ascertain the
real causes of Tasmania’s difficulties, and, if possible, to remove them, or relieve Tasmania in
such a manner as will enable the development of the State to proceed at a rate more nearly
approaching that of the rest of the Commonwealth.
DIFFICULTIES ARISING FROM THE PUBLIC DEBT.
One of the main causes of the financial difficulties of Tasmania is the very great burden
of public debt per head of population. The public debt of £24,000,000 includes three important
items, viz. :
(i) Hydro-electric works, £3,300,000.
(ii) Roads, bridges, harbours, &c., £5,700,000.
(iii) Railways, £6,400,000.
The net interest burden of Tasmania, after deducting the net earnings of its railways and
tramways is £4 4s. Bd. per head of population as compared with an Australian average of
£2 Bs. 7d. This suggests a means for giving assistance which will now be dealt with.


HYDRO-ELECTRIC WORKS.
During the period of its construction and working for the last ten years the hydro-electric
works have been a continual drag on the State finances. The manager of these works has stated
that within two years the State revenue will be freed from further charges. To give relief
in the meantime the Commonwealth Government proposes to continue its present special grant
at the rate of £68,000 for each of the years 1926-27 and 1927-28. This will be an advantage
to Tasmania of £51,000 during the two years.
In this undertaking Tasmania possesses a most valuable asset, and its very existence
must attract new industries, which will improve the general position of Tasmania.
ROADS, BRIDGES, HARBOURS, ETC.
The public debt arising from expenditure on roads, bridges harbours, &c., is not directly
reproductive. In Tasmania, the loan expenditure of £5,700,000 on these services represents 23‘8
per cent, of the total public debt as compared with an average of 8 ’54 per cent, for similar
services in the case of the other States. It amounts to £26 3s. per head of population for
Tasmania as compared with an average of £8 12s. lid. per head for the other States.
• For years Tasmania has adopted a policy of constructing its roads out of loan. In addition,
the Government contributes about one-third of the cost of maintenance, the balance being
provided by the municipalities. In most other States a much greater proportion is borne by
the local authorities. In interest, sinking fund, and maintenance arising out of the road policy
the State budget is clearly bearing a heavy burden. That burden will be substantially relieved
by the national main roads policy of the Commonwealth, and the Government is prepared to adapt
the scheme in order to meet the special conditions of Tasmania.
RAILWAYS.
The railways have for years been a serious embarrassment to the State finances of Tasmania.
Since 1893 the railways have never paid interest and working expenses. For many years
the loss was about £lOO,OOO a year. Since 1920-21 the position has rapidly become worse, partly
as a result of the competition of motor traction, and the loss for the present year, after charging
interest and sinking fund, will be about £250,000. This represents a tax on the people of over £1
per head.
To give relief from this heavy burden the Commonwealth Government is prepared to pay,
for a period of two years, the cost of interest and sinking fund on the present railway loan expendi-
ture of £6,400,000. The interest is approximately £280,000. The exact amount of sinking fund
contributions is not available, but it will probably represent a further sum of £30,000. Under
this proposal the Commonwealth will assist the State budget to the extent of about £310,000 per
annum for two years.
DECLINE OF PRODUCTION.
Associated with the position of the railways is the actual decline of production which
necessarily affects freight and all other revenues. Since federation the area under wheat has fallen
from 44,000 acres in 1901-2 to 13,000 acres in 1924-25. The area under crop of all agricultural
produce is lower per head of population in Tasmania than in any of the other States, with the
exception of Queensland. In Tasmania the average is 1.3 acres per head, compared with the
Australian average of 2.9 acres per head. Sheep have declined from 1,792,000 in 1901 to 1,614,000
in 1925. Comparing the yield per acre for the ten years ended 1924 with the ten years ended 1913.
Tasmania showed reduction in wheat, barley, oats, peas, potatoes, and hay. The reduction in
the yield of potatoes, per acre in ten years was actually 25 per cent. Fortunately the production of
butter increased from 724,000 lbs. in 1901 to 6,183,000 lbs. in 1923-24, while during the same
period cheese rose from 269,000 lbs. to 1,346,000 lbs., and bacon and ham from 530,000 lbs. to
2,271,000 lbs. The value of farmyard and dairying production per head of population in
Tasmania was £6.21 in 1923-24 compared with £7.32 for the Commonwealth as a whole.


The decline of production in Tasmania appears to be largely due to exhaustion of soil,
as well as decreased acreage. Exhaustion of soil is not irremediable. Every country has to
face this problem. In Australia as a whole, with the assistance of fertilizers and modern
methods of farming, the yields in many directions have been increased.
The total value of all minerals raised in Tasmania in 1901 amounted to £1,751,000. In
1921 the amount was £823,000. Since then it has risen annually, and in 1924 reached £1,326,000.
The total value of production of all recorded industries in Tasmania has grown from
£6,312,000 in 1908, the first year in which complete comparative figures are available, to
£11,026,000 in 1923. This, however, represents an increase of only 75 per cent., as compared
with the Australian average increase of 142 per cent.
The only effective remedy for this unfortunate position is to be found in increasing the
production of the Tasmanian community. An increase of production will lead to an increase
of revenue, particularly from the railways, without increasing the real burden upon the people.
In order to explore more thoroughly the causes of deficient production and to propose methods
for overcoming the present retrogression, the Commonwealth Government is prepared to make
available the resources of the Development Commission about to be set up, and of the reorganized
Bureau of Science and Industry, so that a full and scientific investigation may be made.
PROPOSALS OF COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT.
The Commonwealth’s financial proposals may be summarized as follow :
(а) Additional relief to the extent of £310,000 per year by taking over the railway
interest and sinking fund for two years ;
(б) The Commonwealth national roads policy, under which Tasmania will receive
£lOO,OOO a year ; and
(c) Continuance for two years of the present special grant of £68,000 without the
annual reduction of £17,000 provided by the Tasmania Grant Act.
The assistance which Tasmania will receive in 1926-27 and 1927-28 as a result of special
contributions from the Commonwealth is :
£
(i) Relief from interest and sinking fund on railway debt .. .. 310,000
(ii) Grant for roads .. .. .. .. .. .. 100,000
(iii) Present special grant .. .. .. .. .. .. 68,0 00
478.000
(iv) Taxation on lottery prizes (yielded in 1924) .. .. .. 111,000
589.000
These proposals are made by the Commonwealth Government with the sincere desire to
assist the State of Tasmania in overcoming the difficulties which at present exist. The
Commonwealth Government is satisfied that the difficulties can be overcome by resolute and
determined effort made in the light of full knowledge of the relevant facts and in pursuance of
an enlightened and progressive policy.
After the expiration of the two-year period the Commonwealth and the State Governmenls
will be in a position to reconsider the whole question.

FIRST DAY.—MONDAY, 24th MAY.
ADMISSION OF PRESS.
Mr. BRUCE. —Before the proceedings proper of the
Conference begin, there is one, question which it is
necessary for ns to settle —I refer to the admission of
representatives of the press. I may say that upon the
last occasion on which we held a Conference of this
character the press representatives were permitted to
attend the deliberations at one stage, but when we got
down to a detailed discussion of certain figures, with a
view to seeing if we could arrive at some arrangement
in regard to the financial relations between the Com-
monwealth and the States, we went into committee, and
the gentlemen of the press were then excluded. It is
really for the members of the Conference to decide
what course should be followed. I suggest that we
should follow the procedure which was adopted on the
last occasion, unless we wish to discuss any particular
matter in respect of which it may be desired to exclude
the press. •
Mr. McKELL.—Is a note being taken of the pro-
ceedings of the Conference ?
Mr. BRUCE. —Yes, a verbatim note is being taken.
FINANCIAL RELATIONS BETWEEN STATES
AND COMMONWEALTH.
Mr. BRUCE.—Before dealing with the matters
which the Commonwealth Government has called you
together to consider, I wish to express our very great
appreciation of the fact that all the States are repre-
sented here. We recognize that it is extremely in-
convenient for'many of the Premiers to make the
journey to Melbourne, and to remain in this city suffi-
ciently long to attend the whole of the sittings of a
Conference of this character. But the importance of
the matters which arc to he dealt with is some justi-
fication for the action of the Commonwealth Govern-
ment, and I can assure you all that in calling you
together our main desire has been to afford the States
a full opportunity to discuss the very important ques-
tions which have to be considered in relation to the
present position of Commonwealth and State finances.
This gathering is being held for that express purpose.
That is the basic reason why we have asked the State
representatives to meet us here. A previous Confer-
ence, which was held in 1923, dealt with some of the
questions which it is proposed to consider now, and
also with a great number of other matters. This
Conference is being held because, during the recent
Federal elections, the Commonwealth Government made
it perfectly clear that it considered the present basis of
the financial relations as between the States and the
Commonwealth to be quite wrong, and it was essen-
that something should be done to alter the existing
position. I stressed very strongly at that time the
fact that there was something inherently amiss in one
Government raising revenue to be spent by another
Government, whilst the spending Government had no
responsibility in the matter of raising that revenue.
That principle was one which, to a great extent, was
laid down at the Conference held in 1923. Upon that
occasion we had a very long debate upon the matter.
Later, I shall have to refer to what took place at that
But the underlying principle in regard to
this question was the same then as it is now, namely,


that we must get rid of the position which exists to-day
of two Governments collecting money in the same field,
and one Government collecting for the other Government
which has the expenditure of the money thus raised.
At the Conference of 1923 we failed to arrive at a final
decision upon this matter. This was largely due to the
fact that we had not then available, nor had we avail-
able in time for subsequent Budget statements, or
for the preparation of Budgets by the different States,
the actual figures for the previous years, upon which
we were endeavouring to base our arrangement. After
that Conference I telegraphed to all the States, pointing
out to them that we had not the necessary statistics to
enable us to arrive at a decision for the subsequent
year, that the collection of those statistics would prob-
ably take some three months, and that consequently
the Commonwealth Government did not propose to pro-
ceed with its proposals that year, hut would bring them
forward at a later date. We have now reached the
point when this question has again to he considered,
and the Commonwealth Government has asked the Pre-
miers of the States to come here and discuss it with
them. Of course, I recognize that this question of
per capita payments to the States is one entirely within
the discretion of the Commonwealth Parliament. But
I think it is essential that the State representatives
should come here and ho afforded an opportunity to
discuss any proposals which may he put forward by the
Commonwealth. To deal with such questions by corre-
spondence with the different States would he quite im-
possible, and the only alternative to a Conference such
as we are now holding world ho for the Commonwealth
Parliament to take such action as it thought wise, with-
out any opportunity being given to the States to put
their point of view or to discuss any' matters connected
with Commonwealth proposals which appeared to them
to work inequitably to the States. I wish to make it
quite clear that, when it went to the country recently,
the Commonwealth Government indicated that this
vicious principle had to ho got rid of, and that it was
necessary to take such steps as would bring about
the cessation of the system under which the moneys col-
lected by the Commonwealth had to ho returned to the
States. Wo hope to arrive at a basis which will
be reasonably satisfactory to the States, which
will not work inequitably to them, and which
will not cause any dislocation of their finances. The
problem of two authorities functioning in the
same field of taxation was referred to the Jloyal
Commission which was engaged for some time in
investigating the question of Federal and State taxa-
tion. That body was ashed to consider the possi-
bility of harmonizing our State and Federal taxation
schemes, and its conclusion in this connexion is sot out
in paragraph 240 of its report, which reads—
Any scheme of harmonization or amalgamation which still
leaves Commonwealth and State authorities both demanding
revenue from the same people by the same mode of taxation
can at best be only an imperfect remedy for the existing
disabilities. There was practical unanimity of opinion among
witnesses that a delimitation of spheres of taxation is desir-
able. The members of the Commission are of the opinion
that only by a delimitation of spheres or allocation of sub-
jects of taxation between the Commonwealth and the States
can an ordered and satisfactory system of taxation be brought
into being in Australia.
Everybody will agree that the vkhv expressed by the
Boyal Commission, whose report I have just quoted,
is the correct one, and represents the only practical
and efficient way of handling a system of taxation
inside a Federation. But there are certain factors
in connexion with the financial relations between the
Commonwealth and the States which have arisen since
(lie. Commonwealth was formed, and which have made
it necessary to determine whether there are any cir-
cumstances in Australia which render it imperative
to delimit the spheres of taxation as between the Com-
monwealth and the States. In order to ascertain
whether there are any such factors—and particularly
in view of the statement which I have seen oft re-
peated, that the States have an absolute right to these
per capita payments —it is necessary to examine the
position. 1 do not think it will bo suggested that
the States have any right under the Constitution to
receive these per capita payments. It may he argued,
of course, that they have a moral right to them, and
I hat is the side with which I now 'wish to deal, because
it is essential that we should find a remedy for the
existing position.
Whilst a great deal of what I am about to say has
been set out in the memorandum which the Common-
wealth has sent to the various State Premiers, it will
be necessary for me to traverse the ground again,
though not at very great length. There is, however,
one aspect of the matter which I desire to stress —
an aspect which we all have in mind. Upon the
establishment of the Federation it was found neces-
sary to adopt a uniform Customs tariff for the whole
of Australia. Wow, the only way in which such a
system could he effectively handled was by the Com-
monwealth levying that taxation, and administering
the whole system. But at that time the revenue
which was being derived from Customs was far in
excess of the requirements of the Commonwealth—of
the obligations which the Commonwealth was then
shouldering. Consequently it was determined that
three-quarters of that Customs revenue should he
handed hack to the States, and that the remaining
quarter would he sufficient for Commonwealth pui-
poscs, and would enable the Commonwealth to carry
out the functions contemplated by the Federation.
The payment which was then made to the States
was known at the time, and has been known ever since
as a payment of surplus revenue. There is no doubt
that the word “ surplus ” meant what was implied,
namely, that the Commonwealth had a surplus of
revenue which it was raising above its own require-
ments, and it was agreed that that surplus should be
handed back to the States. For the first ten year?
of the Federation it was estimated that that surplus
would represent three-quarters of the Customs and
Excise revenue. It subsequently proved that this
estimate was too low, as it was not three-quarters of
the Customs revenue, which the States were returned
by the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, they
received £6,000,000 in addition, because that money
was not required to carry out the functions of the
Commonwealth Government. By the time the ten-
year period had expired the position had changed;
the Commonwealth had taken over new obligations.
The main obligation which was then handed over
to the Commonwealth, and which the Commonwealth
had to meet, was that in regard to defence. It will
be remembered that about that time our new defence
policy and the establishment of an Australian Navy
became operative. It was also considered that there
should be a national old-age and invalid pension
scheme. The Commonwealth, I repeat, undertook
the obligation with regard to the further defence
programme which was considered necessary by the
whole of the .people of Australia, and it also shouldered
the national responsibility connected with old-age and
invalid pensions. It was recognized at that time
that those new obligations had reduced the surplus
revenue which could be handed hack to the States
It was perfectly clear that it was only the “ surplus”
which was to he returned to the States, and when
these new obligations were assumed by the Common-
wealth in 1010 the old basis disappeared, and the new
basis of per capita payments came into operation
Under that system 255. per head was to be returned
to tile States, and the amount in each case was cal-
culated in the same way as the three-fourths of the
Customs revenue previously returned to the States.
That this fact was recognized at the time, and that
there were no doubts upon it in the people’s minds is


shown by- the circumstance that in the year preceding
the arrangement the States received from the Com-
monwealth £8,492,000, whereas in the following year
they received only £5,196,000 —a drop of £3,290,000.
The new basis for the financial relationship between
the Commonwealth and the States was arrived at for
a period of ten years which, 1 presume, was
then considered a fair period to lay down in
regard to the amount of surplus revenue to be
returned to the States by the Commonwealth. At
that stage they did not want the per capita payments
for ten years only, but for all time. A referendum
of the people was taken upon the question of whether
the payments should be continued for all time, and the
electors quite definitely determined that they should
not. Accordingly, a measure was passed by the Com-
monwealth Parliament limiting the payments to a period
of ten years. When this particular 11 ill was being dis-
cussed in the Commonwealth Parliament, it was made
perfectly clear from the utterances of speakers upon
either side that it was not contemplated that the money
represented by these payments should continue to be
handed back to the States, irrespective of what might
happen in the future. it was recognized that the
Commonwealth might conceivably become involved in
war —the very thing which came about in 1914 —and
would not then be in a position to hand over this surplus
revenue to the States. A glance at the debates which
took place in the Commonwealth Parliament while the
measure in question was under consideration will'
clearly show that it was well recognized that these
per capita payments were not the inalienable right of
the States, and that their continuance must depend
upon the circumstances of the future. We all know
that war did break out in 1914, and that, as a result of
that terrible catastrophe, the whole position was com-
pletely altered. The obligation of the Commonwealth
was to provide for the defence of Australia, and for
the effort which Australia made during the war. The
Commonwealth shouldered that responsibility, Hut we
have to remember that there was nothing to prevent the
Commonwealth, so soon as its war expenditure went up
to the point where the ordinary revenues which it could
raise became exhausted, cutting off the per capita pay-
ments to the States. It had been visualized that such
a result might be brought about. The Commonwealth,
however, behaved with very great generosity to The
States. It did not cut off the per capita payments to
them, but stood up to the agreement which had been
made for ten years, and, in order to raise the revenue
which it required, it had to enter the field of direct,
taxation-—a field which had hitherto been reserved to
the States. It introduced a Federal income tax and
other forms of direct taxation. At no time have these
payments been regarded as anything but payments out
of the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth, and I
suggest that from the day when the Commonwealth had
to assume these great obligations in regard to the war
it ceased to have any surplus revenue which the States
were entitled to claim. We have, therefore, to consider
the actual position which we have now reached. In
1919, the fact was recognized that these payments could
not continue indefinitely in view of the increased obli-
gations of the Commonwealth, and Mr. Watt —then
Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer—brought down
the proposals, which are set out in the. report of
the Conference of January, 1919. Ido not intend
to dwell upon those proposals, except to point out .that
at the time they were put forward there was to bo an
annual reduction of 2s. 6d. per head in the per capita
payments to the States, and it was not suggested that
the Commonwealth was going to recoup them for what
they might lose. The State payments were to be re-
duced, but the Commonwealth was not evacuating any
field of taxation. However, these proposals were not
persisted in. Hut, in 1923, the present. Government
brought forward other proposals, the first of which was
liuil iln; Commonwealth should evacuate the field of
income tax on individuals with incomes under £2,000
a year and grant an exemption of £2,000 to other indi-
viduals. That proposal did not prove generally accept-
able to the States, and it was then suggested that the
best course would ho for the Premiers to confer amongst
themselves with a view to seeing if counter proposals
could not be brought forward. Subsequently, counter
proposals were, submitted. It was suggested that the
Commonwealth should retire from the whole field of
direct taxation of incomes. The State Premiers, how-
ever, said that they recognized that the Commonwealth
could not afford to do this, and consequently the States
would be prepared to make payments to it, which could
bo settled year by year between the Commonwealth and
the States, in order that the Commonwealth finances
might be kept upon a proper basis. 1 need hardily say
that that proposal was rejected. There were so many
obvious defects attached to it that I do not think the
Premiers themselves seriously thought that it would be
accepted. 1 am reminding those present of this fact
simply to bring borne to them that, in 1923, the States
recognized that, with the obligations which the Com-
monwealth had to carry, it could not possibly retire
from the field of direct taxation of incomes. The best
it could do would bo to withdraw from part of that
field. Of course, if some of the glowing pictures which
I have seen drawn of the Commonwealth revenue
which will be collected in the future are realized, it
will be able to retire from the entire field of direct
taxation, thus leaving it absolutely to the States. That
is the only point I wish to make in regard to the 1923
Conference. The Premiers at that time recognized
that the Commonwealth could not possibly abandon
the entire field of direct taxation of incomes.
There; is another matter with which I desire to deal,
and this will occupy only a few minutes. It is only
fair that all the State Premiers should realize the exact
position of the Commonwealth finances, how far it is
conceivable we should go in evacuating the field of
direct taxation, and what are the limitations which
prevent us going further. I have read of many things
which the Comraomvcalth ought to do—-things which
it is quite impossible for it to do. The Premiers of the
States will be able to get a better idea of the position
if I indicate bow the Commonwealth finances stand
at the present time. This is a comparatively simple
matter, because in the Budget-papers we see, under
the wide heading, “ ’Receipts and Expenditure,
Consolidated Revenue Fund,” a general statement
of the expenditure. The estimated expenditure of the
Commonwealth for the present year —I am speaking
of the ordinary general expenditure —is £54,575,233,
including our war expenditure. The Budget papers
also show other statements dealing with the business
undertakings of the Commonwealth which may be
reduced to two, namely, the Post Office and the
railways of the Commonwealth. There is a further
statement dealing with the Territories. Upon
these Territories there is each year a small
deficit, while in regard to. the Post Office and
the railways, taken together, there is a alight
deficit. It has been quite definitely laid down
by the Commonwealth Government, and I think it is
.accepted by every shade of opinion throughout the
country,' that the Post Office should not be a taxing
medium, but should be conducted on lines which will
enable it to pay its way, thereby charging the people
with the actual cost of the services rendered. ISTo
possible expansion of revenue, therefore, can accrue
to the Commonwealth from this source, whilst the
Territories are, if anything, an obligation on the
Commonwealth wdiich makes the position worse than
that indicated by the figures which I shall quote.
If we arc to continue to make per capita grants to
the Stales, and to simultaneously evacuate fields of
taxation in their favour, obviously we shall have to


reduce our expenditure very substantially, indeed.
Let me point to a few of the headings shown in the
Budget papers to which I have referred. The first
is, “War and Repatriation Services,” the estimated
expenditure under this heading for the current year
being £28,857,201. There may be some present who
will tell us that our war expenditure is diminishing,
because the war has been over for seven or eight
years, but I will outline some of the items which
make up the total of £28,857,201. One of these is
“Interest and Sinking Fund,” £20,574,000, the sink-
ing fund representing \ per cent. “War Pensions”
account for a further sura of £7,200,000. In regard
to the interest and sinking fund, there is no possi-
bility of the payment under this heading being re-
duced until the debt has been substantially paid off.
The present position is that, owing to the conversions
we have had to make in respect of loans for Avar pur-
poses, the interest burden is being increased by reason
of the higher rate that we have to pay. In regard
to soldiers’ pensions, oAving to the generosity of the
scheme of which avc all approve, the expenditure under
this heading is not a diminishing one, because in the
case of those Avho are receiving pensions, where chil-
dren are born, those children also become entitled to
pensions. Again, it will be some years before we
can look for any diminution in the next item, Avhich
reads, “ Repatriation of Soldiers,” and under Avhich
the estimated expenditure for the year is £BOI,OOO.
That expenditure is disbursed chiefly upon hospitals'
and other provisions which have been made for
soldiers Avho haA r e become. incapacitated as the I’esult
of the Avar. In that field, obviously, there is no room
for any reduction of expenditure. lam sure that
that fact will be generally recognized. The next
heading to which I invite attention is “ Department
of Defence.” The estimated expenditure under this
heading is £3,608,045, and there is a further special
defence provision of £1,000,000, which is designed to
coA T er the developmental. plan Avhich Avas adopted two
years ago. It Avill take five years to complete that
programme. I think that, generally speaking, the
people of Australia recognize that, if anything, our
Defence expenditure is too low, and that some steps
must be taken to increase it. The direction in which
this increased expenditure should be incurred is in
regard to air co-operation Avith our land and sea
forces. Whilst the programme which avo contemplate
deals fairly Avell, in view of our resources, with the
land and sea forces, it does not provide all that is re-
quired in regard to co-operation by air. Therefore,
the £4,608,045, which is represented by the tAvo sums
I have mentioned, so far from being capable of a
reduction, seems destined to be increased, particularly
Avheu avc remember the extended AT aval programme
which avc contemplate in the building of tAvo modern
10,000-ton cruisers to be completed Avithin the next
tAvo years. The items which I have enumerated absorb
£33,465,246 out of a total of £54,575,233. The next
heading to Avhich I invite attention is that of “ Special
Appropriations, other than War and Repatriation,”
accounting for a further expenditure of £17,654,686.
The main item under this heading is “ Invalid and
Old-age Pensions,” Avhich are estimated to cost this
year a sum of £7,780,000. That particular sum pro-
vides for an advance made in the amount of the
pensions paid from 17s. 6d. to £1 per Aveek for a
period of only five months of the year. In the
Budget for the approaching financial year the amount
which Avill have to be provided, in addition to this
£7,780,000, will be someAvhere in the region of
£1,000,000. This sum will be necessary on
account of the advance to which I have
referred, to cover the full financial year.
The other amount is made up of the interest and
sinking fund on the national debt, other than war
loans, and it cannot be diminished. If we closed down
all our developmental works, such as the Murray
River scheme, it would be possible to hold the figure
comparatively stationary; but the money has been bor-
rowed/ the interest is payable, and the sinking fund
has to be provided, so that there is no possibility of a
reduction. The maternity allowance! accounts for
£700,000, and Avliile it is conceivable, under the pro-
posals made by the Royal Commission on National
Health, which sat recently, that there aaull bo better
security for the children born in this country, there is
no possibility of the amount of the payment being re-
duced. On the contrary, if avc gave effect to the pro-
posals put fonvard, an increase Avould probably result.
The per capita payment to the States absorbs
£7,500,000, and Avliile the Commonwealth Government
is open to suggestions from the States that the amount
should be reduced, I am not too optimistic of receiving
any assistance in the matter. The indications are that
expenditure in that direction will not be decreased, but,
rather, if continued on the present basis, will automa-
tically rise, year by year, Avith the increase in popula-
tion. Another substantial amount is that of £613,000
for special appropriations, which embrace the Gover-
nor-General’s salary, the salaries of the Judiciary,
and of officers holding the statutory positions created
by the Comraonw’ealth Parliament. In A'iew of these
facts, it will be agreed that there is no direction in
Avhich the amount of £17,654,000 may be substantially
reduced, unless avc are to reverse policies which have
been accepted in this country for very many years. For
example, it Avould bo unthinkable to reverse our policy
with regard to old-age and invalid pensions, of giving
the pensioners progress increases, such as have been
given during the last few years, to keep pace Avith the
increased cost of living. It Avould appeal*, therefore,
that there is no scope for a reduction in the items in-
cluded under special appropriations. The total of the
items of Avar and repatriation services, defence, and
special appropriations, represents nearly £51,500,000 of
the total expenditure of the Commomv’ealth, £54,500,000.
Another item-is that of “Additions, neiv Avorks and
buildings,” for AAdiich the sum provided is £265,000.
That vote has been steadily diminishing for the last fiA'e
years; in fact, taking you entirely into the confidence of
the Commonwealth Government, I may say that it has
been reduced to such an extent that it is extremely doubt-
ful Avhether the right policy has been pursued, and
Avhether Ave shall not have to increase the amount, be-
cause the depreciation AAdiich has been allowed to occur
in regard to Commonwealth building has probably in-
volved losses Avhich could be avoided by a sufficient
amount being made available to carry out the neces-
sary works. The items Avith Avhich I haA*e dealt prac-
tically cover the field of expenditure of the Common-
wealth Government; but the ordinary votes of Depart-
ments amount to £2,740,000. Ho Avould, indeed, be a
bold man who could say that it Avould be impossible to
curtail expenditure in Government Departments, be-
cause I believe that it could be reduced. I hope that
all Governments are persistently endeavouring to bring
about greater efficiency with less cost in the running of
Departments. Still, AAdien you consider the ramifica-
tions of the services carried out by the Commonwealth,
you will agree that it is impossible to make any reduc-
tion in a total of £2,740,000 Avhich Avill affect the
relations of the Commonwealth and the States, or put
the Commonwealth in the position of having great
surplus revenues to hand oA’er to the States. Of the
amount of £2,740,000, the best part of £700,000 is
de\*oted to such services as lighthouses, &e., where the
revenue and expenditure just about balance. Thus
very little more than £2,000,000 is left to cover the
whole of the Commonwealth Departments, including
the Department of Customs, which, in the present year,
Avill collect a revenue of over £39,000,000. When you
remember the complexity of the Customs system in
Australia, you will realize that, in order to protect the
revenue, it is necessary to make a very considerable


expenditure. You will thus see that there is no margin
for obtaining any surplus revenue from the figures as
they exist. I come now to the other side of the
picture, concerning the moneys which the Common-
wealth is receiving. Taking the Customs first, in
order to balance the £54,500,000 to which I have re-
ferred, wc have estimated the revenue for the current
financial year at £37,200,000; but wo shall probably
receive over £39,000,000. It may quite legitimately
be said that it is a great source of revenue upon which
we can rely for ever; but, when I remind you that there
has been an increase of about £12,000,000 in the last five
years, you will see that it is dangerous to rely too much
upon the Customs revenue. We are certainly obtaining
maximum results at present; but it is very doubtful if
that position can be maintained. There are many fac-
tors to be taken into account. For example, there has
been a great loan policy in operation, and the raising
of loans overseas tends to increase imports into the
country. If, however, anything happened to stop the
loan expenditure overseas, there would lie an imme-
diate shrinkage of our Customs revenue. It must also
be remembered that the last five years, taken broadly
throughout Australia, have been years of uniform
prosperity, and, in addition, our producers have ob-
tained extremely high prices for their produce sold
overseas. Those factors have contributed towards
establishing a period of considerable prosperity in Aus-
tralia, which has unquestionably swollen the Customs
receipts. I would also remind you that we have re-
cently amended the tariff considerably, which we hope
will result in a stimulation of Australian manufac-
tures, and a reduction of imports from overseas.
A further point is that in the last budget we
reduced taxation on ordinary revenue items under the
Customs heading by three-quarters of a million pounds,
the idea being that the reduction would tend to bring
about a decrease in the cost of living generally.
However, putting on one side the very real possibility
of the present level of Customs revenue not being main-
tained, and assuming that it is, the Commonwealth will
require every penny to meet its obligations during the
next two or three years. I have endeavoured to show
that, on the basis of expenditure adopted for the present
year, there is very little hope of a reduction, and, in the
next two or three years, there are certain items which
will mean increased expenditure. As you know, some
three years ago we laid down a naval programme to
provide the Commonwealth with two modern 10,000-ton
cruisers, two ocean-going submarines, a seaplane car-
rier, and a floating dock, which latter is being con-
structed by the Government of Hew South Wales under
a Commonwealth subsidy. That programme involves
a sum of about £6,800,000, assuming that every esti-
mate is realized. We have, of course, let contracts for
the building 'of the cruisers and submarines. An
amount of £3,500,000 has been assured, because of the
fortunate circumstance that in the last two years we
have had a surplus as a result of the great prosperity of
Australia. -But even if the Customs receipts are main-
tained, we shall have to find £3,300,000 for the naval
defence of Australia. ■ That is an obligation directly
shouldered by the Commonwealth, but I suggest that it
is also a burden to bo shared by the States. Then we
recently had a report from the Royal Commission on
National Health, recommending certain expenditure,
and, in that connexion, I suggest that, before the Premiers
leave, it would be advisable to arrange for the State
Health Ministers to confer with the Commonwealth
Health Minister, to decide how far and in what way
the proposals outlined in that report can be adopted.
While 1 am hopeful that something will be done in the
direction of establishing a great national policy in
regard to health, it must be remembered that such a
policy will eventually impose an increased burden upon
the Commonwealth. There is also the obligation of
placing old-age and invalid pensions, which we took
over in 1910, upon a better basis, with a real national
scheme, which must inevitably increase the financial
responsibilities of the Commonwealth. Then we
have also to meet the rebate of interest which, with the
British Government, we have agreed to give to the
States in connexion with moneys expended upon deve-
lopment schemes, the greatness of the sum depending
upon the pace at which the States proceed. The con-
version of some of our loans will also involve the Com-
monwealth in an increased expenditure. All these
factors indicate that during the next two or three years
there is no likelihood of the Commonwealth having
surplus revenue, unless it increases taxation. We desire,
however, to get out of the field of direct taxation, leav-
ing that ground to the States, and that idea is the basis
of our present proposals. If all the forecasts made of
the cotfers of the Commonwealth overflowing with
revenue are realized —which I doubt very much —it will
then be possible for us to take further steps in regard
to evacuating the field of direct taxation. It has been
suggested many times that the Commonwealth is inter-
fering in a great number of activities which really
belong to the States, and that if the Commonwealth
would only keep out of those fields, it would be able
to hand over to the States the surplus revenue which
certain people suggest it does not know how to spend.
It must be remembered, however, that among the activi-
ties which we are conducting in the States, and for
which we are finding money, are such things as old-age.
pensions and, the maternity bonus. We have suggested
that wo are prepared to co-operate with the States in a
roads policy by the expenditure of £2,000,000 per
annum for a period of ten years. We have made it
perfectly clear that if such a policy is carried out, avc
shall have to raise the money from those Avho will gain
the most benefit, namely, the motorists, but we do not
propose to do somethiing Avhich will increase the
difficulties of transport in this country unless avc are
likely to obtain a benefit more than equal to the detri-
ment caused by the taxation IcA'ied. The point which 1
desire to stress is that roads do not come into this
matter. If we are to give any money for roads, it
should be raised in a specific Avay. Finally, I Avould
remind you that the surplus which the Commonwealth
is budgeted for in the present year is £117,000, against
which we have to meet the payment of £353,000 recently
agreed upon in the case of Western Australia, and the
increased amount in connexion with old-age pensions.
It Avill be seen, therefore, that if there had not been a
substantial increase in the Customs revenue for the
present year, instead of shoAving a surplus, the Com-
monAvealth Avould lula-c had a deficit. That, briefly, is
the story of the finances of the Commomvealth. I haA r e
tried to romoA T e the idea, Avhich appears to be general,
that the Commomvealth has an overflowing treasury,
and that it can do anything it Avishes to assist the States
financially. I ha\ r e also tried to shoAV that if you take
surplus revenue as meaning revenue which the Com-
monAvealth has beyond its requirements for the legiti-
mate functions Avhich it is carrying out, there is no sur-
plus reA T enue. Therefore, in order to make the per
capita payment of £7,500,000 which is budgeted for in
the present year, the Commonwealth must encroach
upon the field of direct taxation, Avhich legitimately
belongs to the States. In an endea\ T our to remedy an
unsound and anomalous position, the CommonAvealth
has put fonvard the proposals embodied in the memor-
anda forwarded to all the States. I desire to stress the
point that those proposals are designed to meet the
circumstances of the States, and to ensure that in the
change over, there will be no dislocation of finances,
and no unfair treatment. To that end the Common-
Avealth is finding an amount of £970,000 in the first
year, £600,000 in the second, and £400,000 in the third,
making practically £2,000,000 in all. The object of
the Commonwealth is to assist the States, but I want
to make it clear that Ave are looking forward to having


such an affluent treasury during the next three- years
that we shall be able to afford the £3,000,000. We
are taking practically the whole of the anticipated
surplus for the present year, and using it to help the
States. I quite admit that if 1 were a State Treasurer
I would have no desire to go out and raise for myself
taxes which someone else had raised for me in the past;
but still, the States must recognize that the Common-
wealth has tried to be reasonably fair in its proposals,
f remind them that, for example, when the cut took
place in 1910, the States had no field of taxation evacu-
ated to help them in their problem. .Vs a fact, they
had one of their fields invaded concurrently with the
reduction of about £9,000,000. The Common-
wealth then imposed a land tax, which yielded
approximately £1,300,000. When Mr. Watt’s schernc-
was introduced, it contemplated a steady reduction of
the amount paid to the States, but it did not provide
for any evacuation at all. Consequently, 1 venture to
say that the treatment which we are now suggesting
is very generous in comparison with the previous pro-
posals. Regarding the actual suggestions, it will be
seen by reference to the table that there will be a gain
to the taxpayers of the States of £727,000 in the first
year. I remind the Premiers that the taxpayers of the
Commonwealth and States are the same people, so that
they benefit from action taken by the Common-
wealth and the States. Under these proposals, the
amount to bo taken out of the pockets of the taxpayers
of the Commonwealth, will be cut down by £727,000,
while the taxation revenue of the States will be un-
disturbed.
Mr. McCOR MACK.—That is very doubtful.
Mr. BRUCE/ —It is not even open to doubt. Mr.
McCormack probably says that, as Treasurer, he will
not get every penny which the Commonwealth is getting,
but that does not affect the position. May I now deal
with one suggestion which has been made against my-
self. I have been told that lam trying to bring about
unification by means of a strangle-hold upon the various
States through the power ot the purse. Of course, J
have no such idea. If I wanted to bring about unifi-
cation, I would tell the people all about it, and say
that it was the best thing to do. I am certainly not
guilty of subterfuge in dealing with the financial re-
lations of the Commonwealth and the States.
Mr. McCORMACK. —You would not tell the people
until you had them in the right frame of mind.
Mr. BRUCE.—That is as it may be, but these pro-
posals are far removed from any such suggestion. lam
certainly not trying to bring about unification by leav-
ing to the States the whole field of taxation. There is
nothing to prevent the Commonwealth cutting off the
per capita payments without relinquishing anything, but
it intends to leave to the States an arena in which they
can tax, which is surely the very last position that is
likely to bring about unification. Take, for example,
the view put forward by some people that the present
basis of taxation in this country is entirely wrong, and
that the Commonwealth should not obtain two-thirds
of its revenue by indirect taxation, but should by means
of indirect taxation, through the Customs, only raise
one-third of the present revenue. What would be the
position of the States if the Commonwealth raised its
revenue in that way? A very poor field of taxation
would be left to the unfortunate States. Such a pro-
posal would really mean reducing the Customs revenue
by about £20,000,000, thus transferring the burden to
direct taxation. That, I agree, would bring about uni-
fication through the power of the purse and the strang-
ling of the finances of the States, but there is certainly
no suggestion of it in the proposals which we are mak-
ing. I now desire to deal shortly with some of the
objections and troubles which I know are in your minds.
You say that you cannot raise the revenue which the
Commonwealth is raising in this field, and I know that
you are worried with regard to loans, upon the interest
from which we are levying taxation. 'The Common-
wealth has power to levy such taxation, but the States
have not. Therefore, it may he suggested that the in-
dividuals handling the loan interest would be exempt,
but I say definitely that we do not propose to allow
those loans to become tax free. The CommouweaLh
Government has laid down most definitely that
it does not believe in tax free loans. We
believe that they create hideous inequalities be-
tween men with large incomes and men with
small incomes, so that, in an arrangement of this
character, we certainly do not intend to exempt loans
from income tax, but will continue to levy taxation upon
the interest derived from the loans, and will hand that
revenue back to the States. We propose to keep the
revenue from that source at approximately the figure
at which it stands at present. In order to do that,
and to avoid inequalities, we shall have to ask the
States to obtain certain information for us.. We shall
require from the taxpayers of the States a return of
(heir income, which will have to embrace not merely
income in one State, but aggregate income over the
whole of Australia. Having obtained that information,
we shall proceed to levy tax upon the interest received
from the loans, but at a rate applicable to the total
income of the' individual. With these changes, being
freed from the general field of taxation upon indivi-
duals, we shall bo able to simplify very greatly
the incidence of the taxation laws, and we
shall try as far as possible to come into line
with what is taking place in the States which are
dealing with the whole question of individual taxa-
tion. However, we certainly do not propose to allow
the loans to become tax free, and we are prepared to
hand over the revenue which we obtain to the various
States, so as to meet any deficit which may occur as
between the amounts they collect and the amount col-
lected by the Commonwealth. What I have said with
regard to loans applies also in connexion with aggrega-
tion. It is suggested that the States cannot raise
anything like the amount which we have been raising
in this field, because they do not aggregate incomes,
but only levy tax upon incomes in a particular State.
May I say first that the estimates as to what that in-
volves are tremendously exaggerated? One gentleman
wrote to the press the other day, and implied that it
would make a difference to one State of something like
£2,000,000, and similar statements were made at the
last Conference; but the actual fact is that the total
collections at the central office for the year 1924-25 only
amounted to £1,700,000. The nature of the exaggera-
tions is thus apparent. At the present time, the aggre-
gation is dealt with in the central office of the Com-
monwealth Department, and the returns go there, but
during the last few months, the Commonwealth has
been under very great pressure from the Public Service
Board, which points out that it is not the most efficient
or the cheapest way of dealing with the matter. It is
considered that the taxpayers in the States should be
required to forward their returns to the Federal agent,
who is, of course, the State Commissioner of Taxation,
showing their total income for Australia, and thus
obviate the necessity of running the central office. But
it is a matter for the States to determine whether or
not they will aggregate. If they -wish to do so, they
may, because the machinery will bn there. It will still
exist with regard to the loan interest which we propose
to tax. Some of the States are at present aggregating
in connexion with other matters, such as probate
duties, and leying taxation upon the assets actually
situated in one State at a rate applicable to the whole
of Australia, and there is no insuperable difficulty in
the way of the States aggregating just as the Common-
wealth has done in the past. If the States say that
they will not or do not desire to aggregate, I think
the Premiers must admit that is their business. They
cannot then say to the Commonwealth that this field
will not yield the amount of taxation estimated, because


they do not choose to aggregate. It is for the States
to determine what method they will adopt. All we are
asking them to do is to raise an amount substantially
less than that which we have raised in this .field, by
whatever methods appear to them to be wise, in order
to impose a fair incidence of taxation upon the whole
of the people over whom the various State Govern-
ments have control. No doubt there are many points
which the Premiers will desire to raise, but I
have dealt with only these two points because
I have seen them mentioned so often. If the
States will not aggregate, but desire to operate
in some other way, that is their business. When
you come to the final test, it will be found that we have
taken this money from the people of Australia in the
way which we thought was the most just and equitable,
and the States have not to take a penny more. In fact,
they have to take rather less, and they can do it in
any way which appears to them to be more just and
equitable than the system we have adopted. My
remarks have been rather lengthy, hut I feel that it
is necessary to give the States the fullest possible in-
formation, in view of the fact that the Commonwealth
Government has said quite positively that it cannot
continue indefinitely a system which is wrong, and
which there is nothing to justify—the method under
which one Government raises revenue for another
Government to spend. Even if there were any moral
obligation upon us to continue to pay this money to the
States in the way wo are doing, based upon the idea
that the States are entitled to some part of the surplus
revenue of the Commonwealth, I say emphatically
that there is no surplus revenue, as the facts over-
whelmingly demonstrate. Finally, I ask all the States
to seriously consider the matter. We are trying to
bring about the change with the least possible disloca-
tion of the finances of the States, and we have been
reasonably generous in our proposals to obviate the
States being placed in an embarrassing position. There-
fore, we ask the State Premiers to co-operate with us.
If they can suggest a better, more efficient and easier
way of doing what we propose, we shall be only too
pleased to listen to them, and to have their assistance.
It has been suggested that it will probably meet the
convenience of the States’ representatives if we adjourn
now, to give them an opportunity to discuss to-morrow
morning the position I have put before the Conference.
If that is the wish of the States, we shall be only 7 too
pleased to acquiesce in it.
Mr. McKELL. —Yes, I think that suggestion has
general approval.
Mr. BRUCE.—Very well. The Conference will be
adjourned until to-morrow afternoon, at 2.30.
Mr. LYONS.—With regard to the suggested con-
ference of Health Ministers, is it intended to hold that
conference immediately, in view of the fact that the
Ministers now present do not hold the portfolios of
Health?
Mr. BRUCE. —It is not intended to hold that con-
ference immediately, but I desire to obtain the consent
of the Premiers to their Ministers for Health meeting
together to consider the possibility of carrying out the
whole or any of the recommendations of the Royal Com-
mission on National Health.
Conference adjourned at 4.45 p.m.
SECOND DAY.—TUESDAY, 25th MAY, 1926.
FINANCIAL RELATIONS BETWEEN STATES
AND COMMONWEALTH.
Mr. McKELL.—It is just about seven weeks since
you, Mr. Prime Minister, announced that you desired
to meet representatives of the various States in confer-
ence in Melbourne. Yet it was only one day last week
that the proposals which you have submitted for our
consideration reached the Government of New South
Wales. Upon perusing them, we found that they strike
at the very base of the financial structure of the States.
Personally, I am of opinion that, in view of their
importance, the time given us for their consideration
has been totally inadequate. Seven weeks ago the Com-
monwealth Government knew that these proposals were
to be submitted to the States, and, consequently, it
might have disclosed them to us very much earlier. In
connexion with the holding of previous Conferences, the
practice has almost invariably 7 been to allow the States
three or four weeks in which to consider the proposals
that were to bo discussed. In 1923, as, doubtless, all
present will remember, it was discovered upon investi-
gation that the figures submitted by the Commonwealth
Government were totally 7 inaccurate.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—That is not so.
Mr. McKELL.—Th e view of the States, despite the
interjection of the Commonwealth Treasurer, is quite
different. As a matter of fact, those figures were
inaccurate.
Dr. EARLE PAGE. —No. At that Conference figures
in relation to the current year were asked for.
These figures were sought after the delegates arrived at
that Conference. They were not the figures which were
set out in the memorandum forwarded to the States by
the Commonwealth.
Mr. McKELL.—Even if that much be admitted, the
fact remains that the figures had to be reinvestigated,
and it is quite possible that the figures presented on this
F. 7376. —3
occasion need to be just as closely scrutinized. It is not
fair to say to the States, within three or four days of
the holding .of this Conference, “ Here are our
proposals. We want you to he ready to discuss them.”
The proposals submitted are of a far-reaching character,
and a reasonable time should have heen afforded the
States to undertake an investigation of the statistics
put forward in support of them. I do not suggest that
the Commonwealth withheld its proposals deliberately,
but I feel that, in the way in which they have been pre-
sented to us, it has shown a total disregard both for the
interests and the feelings of the various States. In
the Federal Constitution the States are recognized, and
in the nature of things they are entitled to much more
consideration than has been accorded to them on this
occasion.
Coming to the memorandum forwarded to us by the
Commonwealth authorities, I may say that, having
regard to the speech made by the Prime Minister
yesterday afternoon, the history of the per capita
payments has been carefully reviewed. When the
Federation was established, the Customs and excise
revenue was transferred to the Commonwealth Govern-
ment. How, Customs and Excise duties previously
constituted the most important branch of State
income. As a matter of fact, the States were almost
wholly dependent for their revenues upon those duties.
When they were handed over to the Commonwealth, it
was wall known that the Commonwealth would not need
all the revenue thus derived for its own requirements,
whilst the States would certainly want a fair proportion
of it to enable them to discharge the ordinary functions
of government. Upon page 1, the memorandum which
has been submitted to the States upon the present
occasion says —
The framers of the Constitution, however, considered it
undesirable to give the States a permanent right to share in
the Commonwealth revenues.


I propose briefly to deal with this particular statement,
but, before doing so, I desire to refer to section 87 of
the Constitution. That section reads —
During a period of ten years after the establishment of
the Commonwealth, and thereafter until the Parliament other-
wise provides, of the net revenue of the Commonwealth from
duties of Customs and of excise not more than one-fourth
shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth towards its
expenditure.
The prefatory words of that section, namely, “ During
a period of ten years after the establishment of the
Commonwealth, and thereafter until the Parliament
otherwise provides,” were not contained in it, when the
clause left the Federal Convention. The imposition
of this limitation was not affirmed by the Federal Con-
vention. The words in question were inserted by a
conference of State Premiers at a later date. I ask
all present to recollect that at that time there was no
Commonwealth authority in existence, and conse-
quently the State Premiers had not to consider the
interests of the Federation so much as the interests of
the various States which were represented at that
gathering. But, despite the statement made in the
Commonwealth memorandum on the present occasion,
the tone of the debates at the Federal Convention
conclusively proves that the States themselves earnestly
desired to permanently share in the Customs and
excise revenue. Since then, however, propaganda
work has been undertaken for the purpose of conveying
the impression that no such idea was in the minds of
the framers of the Constitution when the Federal Con-
vention concluded its labours. But one has merely to
consider the circumstances under which the States
entered the Federation, and to study the debates at
the Federal Convention, to learn that it was never
intended that the whole of the Customs and excise
revenue should be permanently transferred to the
Commonwealth. Had it been thought for a moment
that the States were being called upon to sacrifice the
whole of that revenue, I am very doubtful whether they
would have agreed to join the Federation. I
repeat that a perusal of the debates at the Federal
Convention will provide abundant confirmation of the
contention which I have put forward. I do not desire
to occupy the time of the Conference unduly, but one or
two quotations from different sources will suffice to
indicate the feeling which obtained at that time. Take,
for example, the remarks of Sir John Forrest, who is
generally regarded as one of the founders of the
Federation. When the Surplus Eevenue Bill was
under discussion in the House of Representatives in
1910, he spoke as follows—
At the Federal Convention of 1897-98 the division of this
revenue presented one of the most difficult problems to be
solved, and it was termed “ the lion in the path.” Eventually
an arrangement was come to for a perpetual —that is so far
as we could make perpetual anything under the Constitution,
every section of which is subject to the will of the people —
payment to the States of three-fourths of the revenue, the
Commonwealth retaining one-fourth.
In these remarks Sir John Forrest expressed the view
of the representatives of the different States, not only
at that particular period, but also at the period im-
mediately prior to Federation. This brings us to the
year 1910. Up till then, provision was thus made for
the States to be returned three-fourths of the Customs
and excise revenue, and also certain surplus revenue.
What happened in 1910? In that year the Federal
Parliament passed the Surplus Revenue Bill, the
important feature iu connexion with which is that it
was the outcome of a conference of Premiers with the
Prime Minister in 1909. In that year a definite agree-
ment was arrived at between the States and the Com-
monwealth, and without going through it word for
word, I propose to deal with its four leading points.
In that agreement it was laid down, first, that the
financial relations of the Federal and State Govern-
ments should be placed upon a sound and permanent
basis. It seems to me that that particular portion of
the agreement represented only “ a consummation
devoutly to be wished”—a sort of pious aspiration
when we think of the views which have been recently
expressed upon this particular phase of the subject.
The second point of the agreement set out that the
object was to assure to the States “ a certain annual
income ”•—an income which, under the proposals sub-
mitted by the Prime Minister, would he taken away
from them. The agreement, however, was quite
definite that one of its objects was to assure to the
States a “ certain annual income.” The particular
clause relating to this aspect of the matter reads—
That in order to give freedom to the Commonwealth in
levying duties of Customs and excise and to assure to the
States a certain annual income, the Commonwealth shall, after
the Ist July, 1910, pay monthly to the States a sum calculated
at the rate of £1 ss. per annum per head of the population
according to the latest statistics of the Commonwealth.
Thus they were to bo provided with “ a certain annual
income.”
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—For ten years.
Mr. McKELL.—If the Commonwealth Treasurer
will be patient I will deal with all phases of this matter
in good time. Despite his interjection, I say that there
is no mention made in that agreement of a ten years’
period. There is no mention in it of any limitation
whatever. It meant exactly what it said, namely,
that the per capita payments to the States were in-
tended to assure to them “ a certain annual income.”
It was an honorable understanding, hut instead of being
honoured, we got the Surplus Eevenue Act of 1910.
That act, as all present are aware, caused a return to
be made by the Commonwealth to the States of 255.
per capita each year. In connexion with that act, it
is interesting to observe. that it provided for the
abolition of the Braddon blot, and the substitution of a
per capita payment to the States, such payment being
limited to a period of ten years. But when the words
“ until the Parliament otherwise provides ” were in-
serted, it was not intended that Parliament should not
otherwise provide. There was a distinct implication
behind those words, that Parliament would provide for
the needs of the States, and that it would not cease the
per capita payments entirely.
Sir ALEXANDER PEACOCK.—They were not to
terminate at the end of ten years.
Mr. McKELL. —Those words imply that there is an
obligation on the part of the Commonwealth to do
something for the States, instead of doing nothing.
The suggestion that, because the ten years’ period has
expired, all obligations on the part of the Common-
, wealth have ceased, is untenable. Section 6 of the
Surplus Revenue Act of 1910 provides—
In addition to the payments referred to in section 4 of this
act, the Treasurer shall pay to the several States, in pro-
portion to the number of their people, all surplus revenue
(if any) in his hands at the close of each financial year.
Now the Treasurer of that time had in his hands
surplus revenue, hut it was never paid over to the
States.
Mr. McCORMACK. The surplus revenue
amounted to £10,000,000.’
Mr. McKELL.—Yes, and the States never received
it. In respect of this particular measure, it is diffi-
cult to ascertain precisely how the ten years’ period
came to he inserted. Certainly, the whole of the
Onposition in the Commonwealth Parliament was
absolutely against any limitation of ten years. Only
a little, while previously, the Senate, which is regarded
as the States’ House, definitely set its face against any
such limitation. Some of its members desired a
period of twenty years to be imposed, others favoured
twenty-five years, and others, again, an even greater
period. Yet, despite these views, a ten years’ period
was inserted. But Ido not for a moment think that
the imposition of a ten years’ period meant that, at the
end of that time, nothing was to happen. There is
a definite obligation on the part of the Commonwealth
to do something more than discontinue the per capita


payments to the States. Recollecting the conditions
which obtained before the establishment of Federation,
and the position of the States when they entered into
the Federal bond, I have not the slightest doubt that
it was intended that there should be some permanent
provision made for the allocation of moneys from the
Customs and excise revenue of the Commonwealth
for State purposes. When the Braddon blot was
abolished, and the Surplus Revenue Act became law,
there was a substantial decrease in the amount annually
returned to the States. Of that, I do not complain.
The Commonwealth took over certain other obligations
which, in a rough and ready way, made up for the
diminishing amounts returned to the States. But it
must be remembered that in 1910, when the Surplus
Revenue Act was passed, the Commonwealth Govern-
ment did not receive one penny from direct taxation.
In that year the Commonwealth Parliament enacted
legislation for the annual payment to the States of
255. per capita, and it also provided that the “ surplus ”
revenue, in addition, should be returned to the States.
Yet at that particular period the Commonwealth was
not receiving a single penny from the field of direct
taxation. The first act under which the Common-
wealth derived any money from direct taxation was
the Land Tax Act 1910, which had a retrospective
effect. Thus things went on until 1914, which marked
the outbreak of the war. I need hardly say that we
all recognize that the war made a very big difference,
not only to the finances of the Commonwealth, but
also to those of the States. As a direct result, the
Commonwealth became saddled with extraordinary
expenditure. Consequently, it became necessary for it
to invade the field of direct taxation. It was the war,
and the war alone, which made it imperative that the
Commonwealth Government should exploit that field
of taxation. I will go farther, and say that it was
never intended by the framers of the Federal Consti-
tution that the Commonwealth should enter the field
of direct taxation, except under the strain of some
great national emergency. That is the only justifica-
tion for the Commonwealth invading that avenue of
taxation.
Referring again to the memorandum submitted by
the Prime Minister, paragraph 3 of page 4 states —•
The Commonwealth Government has now determined, be-
cause of these considerations, to discontinue the capitation
payments, and to adjust its financial relationships with the
States on the following basis.
If the Commonwealth Government has determined to
■ discontinue the capitation payments, I ask, in all
seriousness, what is the object of our meeting bore?
I am pleased to note that the last paragraph of the
memorandum on page 11 concludes thus—
It is most desirable that the solution should be reached by
agreement, and it is with that object that the Commonwealth
Government, instead of proceeding direct to legislative action',
invites the States to give these proposals their most careful
consideration.
That certainly sounds a more reasonable and con-
ciliatory note than is contained in the paragraph to
which I have previously referred. I submit that, in
view of the position which we occupy in the scheme
of government—a position which is recognized by the
Federal Constitution—it is a fairer thing for the
Commonwealth to invite our consideration of its pro-
posals than to peremptorily inform us that it is deter-
mined to discontinue the capitation payments.
Coming to the proposals themselves, which are set
out on page 4 of the Commonwealth memorandum,
I find that proposals 2 and 3 read:—
2. That, as a first step towards this ideal, the Common-
wealth evacuate ■ the field of taxation of incomes of indi-
viduals.
3. That the capitation payments now made to the States
under the Surplus Revenue Act be discontinued.
I wish briefly to analyze these proposals. What do
they mean? They mean that the State Governments
ar« asked to relinquish a definite and a constantly
increasing income in the form of per capita pay-
ments, and to accept in lieu thereof a. revenue of a
fluctuating and doubtful character. In this con-
nexion, I desire briefly to refer to the figures in rela-
tion to Federal income tax. In 1922, these figures
were at their peak. In that year no leas a sum than
£1(3,790,682 was collected from this source. That
sum has since been gradually diminishing, not because
of a falling-off in the amount which could have been
collected, but because of a reduction of taxation. So
pronounced has been this reduction that, during the
current financial year, it is estimated that the collec-
tion from income tax will realize only £9,650,000.
That figure, I understand, includes the amount col-
lected from companies. I repeat, therefore, that what
the Commonwealth proposes to concede to us in return
for our foregoing all share in the Customs and excise
revenue, is an income of a fluctuating and doubtful
character. The per capita payments to the States have
increased on an average to the-extent of £64,000 per
annum, and with a further increase in our population
we may reasonably assume that the average mentioned
will be still further increased in the future. We all
know that the Commonwealth Government, in con-
junction with the Imperial Government, is giving
special consideration to the question of migration. If
the proposed scheme in this connexion becomes opera-
tive, the rate of increase in our per capita payments
will be even greater than it is to-day. It is interesting
to compare the amount collected from Federal income
tax, which is decreasing each year, with the Customs
and excise revenue annually collected by the Com-
monwealth. I do not wish to go into the whole of the
figures, but, taking the year 1922 as an example, the
revenue from Customs and excise amounted to
£27,630,359. That sum has gradually increased until
it is estimated that, during the current financial year,
£37,200,000 will be collected from this source, and if
I did not misunderstand the Prime Minister yesterday
afternoon, he is of opinion that it may reach something
like £39,000,000. It will be seen, therefore, that
whilst on the one hand the amount collected from
income tax has been a decreasing quantity, the sum
collected from Customs and excise duties has been a
steadily increasing one. Yet, it is proposed by the
Commonwealth that the one shall be used to off-set the
other. There is another feature connected with
receipts from income tax, which should not be over-
looked, namely, that to a large extent they are of a
seasonal character. A very great deal depends upon
the prices realized for our primary products and upon
the general prosperity of the country. The past two or
three years I regard as peak years, so far as the pros-
perity of the Commonwealth is concerned. I do not
know of any other period in our history during which
our prosperity has been greater. As good and bad
seasons are experienced in cycles, it is possible that,
during the next few years, we shall not enjoy the same
prosperity as we have experienced during the past two
or three years. Should that prove to be the case, the
sacrifice which the States are asked to make under the
proposals of the Prime Minister will be even greater
than they appear to be to-day.
If the State Governments are to be dependent
almost exclusively for their revenue upon income tax
collections, they will occupy a most precarious posi-
tion. As the result of two or three bad seasons, they
may find it almost impossible to carry on the ordinary
functions of government. Upon the other hand, these
per capita payments represent a stable and basic
arrangement. They are available to the States irre-
spective of whether the weather is wet or fine, or
whether drought or good seasons are experienced. They
are suificiently stable and basic to allow us to accurately
estimate our revenue from this source each year. A
similar remark is not applicable to income tax collec-
tions.


I have a few interesting figures in regard to the
position of Hew South Wales which, to a very con-
siderable extent, also indicate the state of affairs in the
other States. Tho total revenue of the State of Hew
South Wales at the present time, omitting industrial
undertakings, is £10,912,000. You will all appreciate
the reason why I leave out of consideration the indus-
trial undertakings of the State, and will admit that it
is fair and just, especially in view of the statement
made by the Prime Minister yesterday, that industrial
undertakings, such as Railways and the Post Office,
should be expected to pay their way, but no more. Of
•the total revenue of £10,912,000, the receipts from
income tax represent £4,662,000, and the per capita
returns £2,797,000. Adding together tho income tax
receipts and the per capita returns, we get the sum of
£7,459,000, so that, roughly speaking, 70 per cent, of
the. total revenue of Hew South Wales comes from these
two sources. Therefore, if the proposals put forward
by tho Commonwealth Government be adopted, it is
clear that the income tax will have to be increased to
such an extent as to bring in the 70 per cent, of revenue
at present received from tho two avenues, that I have
mentioned. 1 want the Conference to consider very
carefully what is likely to happen to a State dependent
for its revenue solely upon the imposition of income
tax, in the event of bad seasons being experienced.
When the season is a good one, the State is prosperous,
but there is quite a different aspect from the point of
view of revenue after a bad season or a succession of
bad seasons. It is quite easy to picture the position in
which the State of Hew South Wales would find itself
after one or two bad seasons if the proposals outlined
by the Prime Minister were adopted. Journeying from
Sydney to Melbourne for the purpose of attending this
Conference, I was forcibly impressed with the evidences
of the prosperity of the country, which were manifest
as far as the eye could reach. The country certainly
presents a beautiful picture, because wo are passing
through a period of prosperity; the people are happy
and contented. They are doing well and making money,
and, at the same time, they are largely contributing
towards the welfare of the State by augmenting the
revenue from income tax. But quite a different state
of affairs may exist in another eighteen months’ time;
there may be a considerable diminution of prosperity,
with a consequent falling off in the amount of income
tax paid by the people. Instead of the revenue of the
State from income tax increasing, it is quite probable
that many people will be looking towards the State
Government for assistance, and the State finances will
have to hear the burden of helping citizens, who were
previously contributing to the revenue, over a period
of stress. The adoption of the proposals of the Com-
monwealth Government would mean that the State
Government would have to depend entirely upon the
money received by way of income tax. Surely such a
situation is too serious for contemplation, having regard
to the effect of seasonal and other influences. The idea
underlying the Commonwealth scheme is that some-
thing stable, something basic, should be taken from the
States in return for something of a fluctuating and
doubtful character being handed over to the States.
There is no getting away from the fact that the
Commonwealth Government will be in a very happy
position if the proposals are adopted, because it will be
getting rid of an increasing expenditure in return for
the surrender of a decreasing revenue. There is the
further point to consider that, while the Commonwealth
Government proposes to surrender to the States the
of income tax so far as individuals are concerned,
it will be open to that Government to re-enter the field
at any time it so disires. Ido not say that the present
Commonwealth Government would be likely to take a
step of that nature, but I would emphasize that the
hands of any future Commonwealth Government would
not be bound in any way. There is the further factor
that tho giving up of the field of income tax by the
Commonwealth is not really a surrender at all, because
the States could operate in that field at tho present
time, if they wished to do so. Putting to one side foi
a moment the present proposals, I ask the Prime
Minister, “ What are tho taxation proposals of tho
Commonwealth Government' for the ensuing year? la
it intended to reduce tho income tax during the next
twelve months?” The question is an important one
from the point of view of the States, because we are
unable to realize that there is any urgency in regard to
the proposals now before the Conference. I am firmly
convinced that public opinion will force tho Com-
monwealth Government to further reduce the taxa-
tion of incomes. There has been reduction during
the past few years, and there will be greater curtailment
during the next four or five years. Income tax revenue,
from the point of view of the Commonwealth Govern-
ment, will, I have no doubt, bo a constantly-diminishing
factor, so that, if these proposals are left in abeyance
long enough, the stage will be reached when there will
be no taxation by the Commonwealth of the incomes
of individuals. If we look towards the future in that
way, we can clearly see that the present move of the
Commonwealth Government is a shrewd one, because
the acceptance of tho Commonwealth scheme merely
involves, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, the
giving up of something which must, whatever happens,
be gradually relinquished. In considering a matter of
this kind we should have regard only to the factors
operating during a normal period. I feel quite sure
that the Prime Minister will admit that conditions were
not normal when the Commonwealth Government
entered the field of direct taxation, because that step
was taken as a direct outcome of the war, and the war
period was certainly abnormal. In 1914 the Common-
wealth Government had not encroached upon the field
of direct taxation, and it was only war expenditure
which necessitated action in that direction. Tho Prime
Minister has told us that expenditure arising out of
the war is not diminishing very rapidly. Even if that
be so, it will be agreed that it is diminishing, and must
become smaller and smaller as time goes on, until it
roaches vanishing point.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—That will not be for fifty
years.
Mr. McKELL.—The Commonwealth Treasurer is
looking at the question from the Commonwealth point
of view. Still, I am surprised to know that he is so
optimistic, seeing that he is the custodian of Common-
wealth finances, as to forecast the vanishing point in
50 years.
Mr. COLLIER.—I think he is pessimistic.
Mr. McKELL.—I do not think Dr. Earle Page’s
estimate will bear investigation.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—It is merely a question of the
basis of the Sinking Fund.
Sir ALEXANDER PEACOCK.—We will all have
to get assistance if we cannot do better than Dr. Earle
Pago anticipates in 50 years.
Mr. McKELL.—Yea. If the income tax revenue
decreases in tho next five years in the same ratio as it
has decreased during the last five years.
Mr. COLLIER.—It has been reduced nearly half
during the past five years.
Mr. McKELL.—Yes; and there will be a further
gradual reduction as the years go on, until a normal
period is reached similar to that ruling prior to 1914.
When we get back to that normal state of affairs, we
will have increasing Customs and excise revenue, as
compared with a decreasing return from direct taxa-
tion. The return to normal conditions will eventually
find the Commonwealth Government out of tho field of
direct taxation, as in the period prior to 1914. The
proposals put forward by the Prime Minister can only
be considered on tho basis of a normal period, and I
am not prepared to admit that the present is a normal


period. Having regard to all tlie facts, I say tliat the
per capita payments should he continued until, at all
events, we see what the next few years bring forth.
There is certainly no justification for the Common-
wealth Government endeavouring to have this matter
definitely settled at the present stage. We have had
25 years’ experience of Commonwealth administration.
During that time, certain difficulties have been ad-
justed, and, therefore, it is fair to assume that many
of our present problems will he solved as the result of
the experience of the next few years. Eroqi the point
of view of the States, and from the point of view of the
Commonwealth, and in the interests of the people as a
whole, I urge the Commonwealth Government not to
persevere, for the present at all events, with its pro-
posals. I desire to stress some of the difficulties that
will be imposed upon Hew South Wales, if those pro-
posals are given effect to. In the first place, Hew
South Wales will require to raise a further sum of
£2,899,000 by additional taxation of the income of
individuals. In my State, at the present time, there
is a flat rate tax of 2s. 6d. in the £1 on companies;
therefore it would ho necessary to obtain the extra
£2,899,000 from the taxation of incomes f»f individual
taxpayers. The State income tax upon individuals
now brings in a revenue of £1,900,000, whereas by the
adoption of the Commonwealth proposals that impost
will bo increased by a further sum of nearly £3,000,000.
We will have to increase the income tax receipts from
individuals from £1,900,000 to £4,700,000. In other
words, the rate imposed will have to be two and a half
times the present rate. I ask you to consider seriously
what chance_a_ State Government will have of collect-
ing from individuals revenue based on a tax two and a
half times as great as the present tax. To carry out
the proposals put forward by the Prime Minister, it
will be necessary to alter the whole incidence of State
taxation. The Commonwealth Government has the
advantage of being able to aggregate the income earned
by an individual in various States, and to impose a
higher rate appertaining to that aggregated income. In
regard to the matter of the aggregation of income, we
find this statement at page 11 of the Commonwealth
scheme, relating to the separation of Commonwealth
and State finances:—
After due examination, the Commonwealth finds that the
additional taxation secured by it by the aggregation of
incomes derived from more than one State is not substan-
tial.
I tvould like to know exactly what is meant by “ after
due examination ”; wc should be told the nature of that
examination, and the results disclosed. "Again, the
meaning of the words “is not substantial ” is very
vague; something that may not he substantial from the
point of view of the man who has plenty may be very
substantial from the point of view of the man who is
out of work; "what may not be substantial from the
point of view of the Commonwealth Government, which
has enjoyed a succession of surpluses, may be very
substantial indeed to a Slate Government that has been
unfortunate enough to have a scries of deficits. Surely
we are entitled to know what was disclosed by that
“ due examination,” and exactly what is meant by the
words “is not substantial.” The statement continues;—
In any case, whatever taxation is at stake can certainly
be collected, and no loss need fall on the States in tin's con-
nexion. Ibe States themselves could require a taxpayer deriv-
ing income from other States to give particulars of that
income in his annual return, and the total income could then
be taken into account for the purpose of determining what
rate of tax should be applied to the income earned within
the State.
We are entitled to know from the Prime Minister
whether that can be regarded as a considered statement,
and to be informed whether the legality of that par-
ticular suggestion has been carefully investigated. I
do not think-that the suggestion is a moral one from
the State point of view. The jurisdiction of a State
is territorial, the Government being empowered to
make laws for the peace, order, and good government
of the people within the boundaries of the State. The
right of a State to collect income tax refers to the col-
lecting of the tax from individuals residing within its
boundaries. I do not know that it is within the legal
rights of a State Government, to order an Individual
to furnish a return of the income earned by him in
some other State, so that it may then say, “We will not
tax you directly on the income earned by you in the
other State, but we will take the amount of that income
into consideration in fixing the rate of tax in respect
of the income which you say you received in Hew
South Wales.” Under* such an arrangement, it cannot
be said that the individual is being directly taxed, but
he is certainly being indirectly taxed, in respect of all
the money earned by him outside the State limits. I
do not think that would be a strictly proper or honest
thing for a State to do, even if it had the requisite
legal power, the possession of which I doubt very
much.
Mr. BRUCE. —There is no doubt that the State has
the legal power.
Mr. McKELL. —That may be so, but I doubt it very
much. It appears to me that a State has no authority to
tax a citizen on income earned by him outside of that
State; the power is limited to the taxing of income
earned within the State.
Mr. BRUCE.—You are suggesting that it, is not
within the power of a State to levy taxation on any
basis it thinks fit?
Mr. McKELL.—I do not think there is any power
vested in a State to levy taxation on the income earned
by an individual outside its borders.
Mr. BRUCE. —It is within the power of a State to
levy taxation on any basis that it thinks fit. For,
instance, a State could say to a citizen, “ We are going
to tax you on the income obtained by you in Great
Britain, or any other part of the world.” Perhaps it
would be a most ill-advised thing for a State to do, hut
there is no doubt that it has the requisite legal power.
Mr. McKELL. —I doubt it very much. For in-
stance, the Commonwealth Government does not ask
taxpayers for returns of income earned in. Great
Britain.
Mr. BRUCE.—Ho; but there is ample power in the
Commonwealth to do so. The taxation of Great
Britain is based upon the flag, and there is nothing
to prevent the Commonwealth adopting a similar
basis.
Mr. McKELL. —The fact remains that the Com-
monwealth does not do that.
Mr. BRUCE.—Ho; but there is nothing to prevent
the Commonwealth adopting such a basis.
Mr. McKELL. —The point is that the practice is
not followed by the Commonwealth, but the States are
now being asked to adopt it.
Mr. McCORMACK. —Yes; that was definitely sug-
gested by the Prime Minister in his speech yesterday.
Mr. McKELL.—The Commonwealth is asking the
States to do something which it is not prepared to do
itself.
Dr. EARLE PAGE. —What is that something which
you say the Commonwealth is not prepared to do
itself ?
Mr. McKELL.—It is asking the States to do some-
thing in regard to income earned in Great Britain and
in other parts of Australia outside of the particular
State concerned.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—The Commonwealth proposals
only refer to Australia.
Mr. McKELL.—The fact remains that the Com-
monwealth has not adopted that basis. In this con-
nexion I refer the Prime Minister to the High Court
judgment in the case of the Attorney-General of the
Commonwealth against the State of Hew South Wales
and the Commissioner of Taxation, reported in C.L.R.


1920-1. It seems to me that that judgment makes it
clear that there is considerable doubt on the point.
Mr. BRUCE;—Probably; but that is a question of
the powers of the Commonwealth and the powers of
the States—quite a different problem from the one
to which you have just referred.
Mr. McKELL.—I candidly admit that I have very
grave doubt whether the States have the right to do
what is suggested should be done under these proposals.
Difficulties would arise in regard to the actual imposi-
tion and collection of the taxation. The Common-
wealth can arrive at the amount of income tax by the
aggregation of the income, but it would be very diffi-
cult for the States to collect a similar amount in that
way, or to collect as much as is being received by the
Commonwealth taxation authorities at the present
time. In New South Wales there is a flat rate of
2s. 6d. in the £1 in regard to companies, whilst indi-
viduals are not taxed in respect of dividends received
by them from companies. The Commonwealth system
is quite different, and, therefore, the position of the
Commonwealth taxing authorities cannot be compared
with that which the State taxing authorities would
occupy if the scheme outlined by the Prime Minister
were in force. I feel quite sure that the taxing authori-
ties of all the States will agree that there would be
insuperable difficulties in the way of the States col-
lecting the same amounts in income tax as are now
collected by the Commonwealth. At all events, that
fact has been strongly stressed by the officers of my
State who are charged with the administration of in-
come tax legislation. The figures which have been
quoted in regard to Commonwealth taxation do not
agree with the figures which have been prepared from
the point of view of my own State. The State figures
cover the year ended 30th June, 1925.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—Do they refer to income tax
received or assessed?
Mr. McKELL.—Actually received; that would pro-
bably account for some of the difference.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—Yes.
Mr. McKELL.—It is one thing to assess tax and
another thing to collect it.
Dr. EAELE PAGE.—Quite so. Do your figures
include arrears?
Mr. McKELL.—No; our figures are based on the
amounts actually received. There is no reason to
believe that the receipts for the present financial year
will be better than those for the last financial year;
as a matter of fact, I think they will be about the
same. Consequently, the estimate should be reasonably
correct. The Commonwealth figures, I understand,
are based Upon taxable incomes for the year ended 30th
June, 1924-25.
• Dr. EARLE PAGE.—Yes.
Mr. McKELL.—I understand that allowance has
been made for a 6 per cent, increase, and for a deduc-
tion of 12£ per cent, to provide for the reduction in
rates. My own view is that the basis adopted by New
South Wales is the more suitable, because the increase
of 6 per cent, must certainly he regarded as prob-
lematical. For 1925-26 the estimated amount of in-
come tax levied on individuals is £2,101,000 in the New
South Wales office, and £49.2,000 in the Central Office,
making the total tax on individuals in New South
Wales _ under the Federal income tax £2,593,0000,
of which it is estimated £2,463,000 will be collected.
The estimated amount of the per capita payment to
that State for 1925-26 is £2,850,000, making the excess
of the per capita payments, on the basis of £2,463,000,
a sum of £387,000. It will thus be seen that a con-
siderable difference exists in comparison with the Com-
monwealth figures.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—I take it that your figures
cover the actual collection and not merely the assess-
ment?
Hr. McKELL. —The greater part of the amount has
been actually assessed.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—But there are still some assess-
ments to come in.
Mr. McKELL. —There are certain amounts to come
in, but they have not been taken into consideration.
I think I have made it clear that quite a different com-
plexion can be put upon the Commonwealth proposals
from that outlined by the Prime Minister. A some-
what lurid picture of the finances of the Commonwealth
has been drawn by the right honorable gentleman, but
I would like to know what sort of picture he would
draw if he happened to be a State Treasurer. The
Commonwealth surplus for the six years ended 1924-25
amounted to something like £7,000,000, whereas for
the same period New South Wales had a deficit of
£3,186,000, or an average deficit each year of £531,000.
I feel sure that Mr. Bruce would have quite a different
tale to tell if he were operating in the State sphere
instead of being Prime Minister. Summing up, it may
be said that the Commonwealth proposals can be
characterized as premature, because the financial posi-
tion in which we find ourselves to-day is really due
to the international catastrophe which happened in
1914. I have no doubt that in a few years’ time, as
the result of increasing Customs and excise revenue,
together with a reduction of income tax, we shall ho
back to the plane that we occupied prior to the war
period, with the Federal Government right out of the
field of direct taxation. The Prime Minister stressed
the financial difficulties with which the Commonwealth
has to contend, but I have a vivid recollection of the
policy speech delivered by him only a short time ago,
in which he grew very eloquent in regard to the things
which he intended to do if returned to power. He
certainly did not give any indication that such drastic
proposals in regard to the per capita payments as are
now under consideration by this conference would be
put before the States. It is regrettable that there is
a growing tendency for the Commonwealth to encroach
more and more upon the domain of the States. I say
emphatically that these proposals cover matters which
should be left entirely under the control of the States;
the States should be allowed to conduct their own
business in their own way, and the Commonwealth
should only concern itself in matters which come
within its sphere. The scheme now before the Con-
ference is merely an attempt on the part of the Com-
monwealth Government to gain popularity at the
expense of the States; if it were carried out, the States
would be in the position of an Aunt Sally, for every
income taxpayer to have a shot at. The proposals
before us have been framed on a basis which has not
paid due regard to the real position of the States in the
scheme of things. I say definitely that, so far as New
South Wales is concerned, it is opposed to the sug-
gestion that the per capita payments should be with-
drawn. The Commonwealth has a stable form of
revenue, and, therefore, it should not interfere in the
domain of the States. Having regard to the spirit of
the Constitution, there is no doubt in my mind that the
per capita payments should be continued. I admit
that the Commonwealth may have the legal right of
withdrawal, but such action was not contemplated by
the States when they entered into the Federation.
Certainly the Commonwealth has no moral right to
discontinue these per capita payments. In conclusion,
I stress the fact that the withdrawal of such payments
would be a lamentable breach of the clear understand-
ing upon which the States federated.
Mr. ALLAN. —Mr. McKell has given the Conference
the benefit of his legal training in regard to the
terms of the Constitution in relation to the proposals
of the Commonwealth Government. I do not intend to
elaborate the arguments put forward by him, but I am
here to outline the very definite attitude taken up on
the subject by the Government of the State of Victoria.


I tell the Prime Minister frankly that my Government
totally disagrees with the proposals that he has put
forward, and I will give one or two reasons for that
disagreement. When the federation was entered upon,
I was rather younger than I am to-day, but I have a
vivid recollection of reading the reports of the Con-
vention debates in the press, and I well remember the
clear understanding, which I gathered from the
Convention proceedings, that the Commonwealth was
to have a definite field of taxation, comprising the whole
of the Customs revenue. I do not think one can find
any more definite field so far as taxation is concerned;
but if the people had been told at the time they were
asked to vote for or against federation that, after a
little while, the States would not receive one penny of
Customs revenue, whilst all the fields of taxation—both
direct and indirect —would bo the prerogative of the
Commonwealth, I feel quite sure that federation would
not have been carried, and consequently there would
have been no Commonwealth control to-day. I do not
think the Prime Minister fully realizes the position in
which the States find themselves. The Commonwealth
is taking over indirect taxation, which everybody has
to pay, and which, being indirect, is not a heavy burden.
It is a well-known fact that income tax is only paid by
a portion of the people, whereas the whole of the
citizens contribute towards Customs revenue. Yet under
the Commonwealth proposals, the States are informed
that each individual must be told the actual money ho
must pay towards State revenue. Let me illustrate
one of the difficulties in which the State of Victoria
finds itself by recalling what we have to pay to maintain
some of the Departments which have been left under
State control. The Education Department costs
£2,189,000, charities, &c., £948,000, police and penal
establishments £833,000, Law Courts (including build-
ings, &c.) £179,000, and Health £97,000. These items
with the Library, and one or two other Departments,
bring the total expenditure up to £4,294,000. It
must also be remembered that this expenditure must
gradually increase as the population of the State grows.
We have to educate our children, and the cost
of education is gradually rising, not only because
of the increasing number of children, but because we
are paying higher salaries and affording a better
standard of education. Further, we are paying the
sum of £5,901,000 in interest upon the loans -which we
have already floated. It is not my intention to discuss
the matter of loans, but Australia is bearing a terrific
burden of debt, and I do not think that we can con-
tinue to borrow very much longer unless we establish
a definite sinking fund. The Commonwealth
budget anticipates that it will take about 50 years
to pay off the war loan, but I sincerely hope that a
better sinking fund will be provided, because a war
loan should be repaid in much less time. I shall not
occupy your attention for very long, as I feel that we
should definitely tell the Commonwealth what we think
is fair. You can plainly see that the whole trend of
recent Federal legislation has been towards unification.
The Prime Minister said yesterday that the Common-
wealth would not do anything, inequitable to the
States, but unification can be brought about in a good
many ways. For instance, the States can bo strangled.
I do not know whether I speak for the whole of the
people of Victoria, but if it be the intention of the
Commonwealth Parliament to strangle the States, I
believe that the people will not allow it. They cer-
tainly will not do so if I can exert any influence with
them. Then Mr. McKell pointed out that the Com-
monwealth had raised in six years about £7,000,000
which it did not know how to spend.
Mr. McCORMACK. —That was the amount dis-
closed.
Mr. BRUCE.—We run our accounts quite re-
spectably.
Mr. ALLAN. —It certainly seems as though the
Commonwealth has had a good deal of money. The
amount at present collected from Customs is about
£39,000,000, and that revenue has been increasing at
the rate of more than £2,000,000 per annum, though
the Prime Minister stated yesterday that he doubted
if the Customs revenue next year would realize the
amount obtained this year. It is quite true that the
Commonwealth has been gradually increasing the
duties, but still the revenue continues to rise, and I am
of opinion that the increase next year will be in the
vicinity of £2,500,000. Notwithstanding that posi-
tion, the Commonwealth says that it will not give the
States one penny of the Customs revenue, but will
evacuate the income tax field. It is problematical
what we would obtain from income tax in any year.
In the event of a drought occurring all over Australia,
what would become of the income tax in the following
year? If the people cannot pay income tax, how arc
we to raise it? They have to pay the Customs imposts
without question, and when the Commonwealth takes
£39,000,000 out of their pockets it is obvious that,
there is not very much left for the States. The Com-
monwealth was making the per capita payments to the
States long before the war, and I realize that, as the
outcome of the war, it had to enter other fields in order
to obtain money for the conduct of its operations. It
then imposed taxation by means of income tax, pro-
bate duties, land tax, and amusement tax, with the
object of meeting interest on the war loans and re-
patriation expenditure. I do not desire to say much
about repatriation, though the Commonwealth has not
treated the States very generously in relation to the
settlement of soldiers, which is primarily a Common-
wealth affair, but which is costing the State of Vic-
toria a considerable sum of money. Owing to the
abnormal rise in Customs revenue, the Commonwealth
has more money than it knows how to spend, and it has
invaded certain spheres of operations, which could be
better conducted by the States, again with the object
of unification. I do not know exactly what the Com-
monwealth lost as a result of its shipping enterprises,
though I admit that it was a w T ar measure. Still, I
am inclined to think that it was a foolish one.
Mr. BRUCE.—Do not let us discuss foolish mea-
sures, or we shall be very busy.
Mr. ALLAN.—The Commonwealth has written off
a tremendous sum of money in connexion with ship-
ping, but I do not know the exact amount.
Mr. McCORMACK.—It is £8,000,000 —out of
surplus revenue.
Mr. ALLAN. —Yes; that is the point.
Mr. BRUCE.—That statement is inaccurate.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.'—It is not out of surplus
revenue.
Mr. ALLAN.—Then the Commonwealth proposes to
embark upon a housing venture, involving an expen-
diture of £20,000,000, but my view is that it has no
right to do such things. In Victoria, we are build-
ing houses under' the State Savings Bank scheme, and
I venture to say that we can build them better and
cheaper than can the Commonwealth. It is also in-
tended to spend £20,000,000 in connexion with a roads
grant, to which I was very reluctant to agree, partly
because the money is to be disbursed on the basis of
population and area.
Mr. COLLIER. —That was the only meritorious
feature of the suggestion.
Mr. ALLAN. —I had two reasons for my objection,
one being that the Commonwealth proposed to
impose a petrol tax, and (lie road users of Victoria
should not be compelled to provide money for the
making of roads in Western Australia and the other
States. Ido not mind the whole of the people of
Victoria paying something towards the upkeep of the


Northern Territory, hut I object to the motorists being
compelled to pay a petrol tax, because it is a tax
imposed upon a comparatively limited number of
people. The Prime Minister also mentioned migra-
tion. He told the States that the Commonwealth
will provide the money for ten years at a cheap rate
of interest; but we will have to father the scheme and
endeavour to make a success of it. If we are not suc-
cessful, we will have to bear the whole burden. I think
I have made it clear that, in accordance with the pro-
visions of the Constitution, the States have a right
to expect a definite field for taxation, and nothing
would be so satisfactory as the per capita payments. It
is true that the amount remains at 255. per unit,
although the value of the £1 has decreased 50 to
75 per cent. Still, we have not asked for an increase,
but have endeavoured to raise our revenue in other
ways.
Mr. COLLIER. —We have been extremely modest in
not pressing for an increase.
Mr. AULAH.—I think so, because the present value
of the 255. is little more than half what it was ten or
fifteen years ago. On behalf of the people of Victoria, I
press for a definite field of taxation, because I believe
that the Constitution laid it down —morally, at all
events —that we should receive the per capita payments.
If the Commonwealth seeks to strangle the States, as I
admit it has the power to do, I feel sure that the people
will tell it to keep to the big things which were placed
within its jurisdiction when Federation was established,
and leave the domestic affairs to the States. I support
the per capita payments, because I am of opinion that
there is is nothing elsse quite so fair, and I sincerely
trust that, as the war expenditure gradually diminishes,
which it must do, the Federal Parliament will abandon
the spheres of income tax, land tax, probate duties, and
amusement tax.
Mr. BRUCE.—Speaking for the State of Victoria,
you say that you want a definite field of taxation, but
what is that field?
Mr. ALLAH.—The present system of 255. per capita
payment is satisfactory.
Mr. BRUCE.—But it is hardly a definite field of
taxation.
Mr. ALLAH. —It is pretty definite.
Mr. BRUCE.—It is definite; but I do not think that
it is a field of taxation.
Mr. McCORMACK.—The Prime Minister made the
whole basis of the proposed change the principle that
one government should not raise revenue for another
government to spend. He did not say that it was the
need of the Commonwealth which brought about, the
desire for, a change. For the past 26 years the States
have been able to meet their commitments under the
system operating without any harm being done to any
one, and, because of an abstract principle such as that
adduced by Mr. Bruce, I do not see why such an extra-
ordinary change should be suggested. In addition, the
Commonwealth has introduced the principle of bargain-
ing, which it has no need to do, because it has legal
power to continue in the field of direct taxation if it
chooses to. do so, without any reference to the States.
I am at a loss to understand why the Commonwealth
proposes to bargain on this question, but the very
attempt at bargaining suggests that it is not quite sure
that it is doing the right thing. It proposes to take
away the per capita payments, which it can do in any
case, and, as a sop to us, suggests evacuating certain
fields of taxation. It seems that the Commonwealth
is not quite sure whether it can proceed with its idea,
and obtain the approval of the people. The whole issue
in this matter is whether the States have a moral right
to a portion of the Customs revenue, and, in order to
decide that question, it is necessary to go through the
history of the per capita payments. Mr. McKell did
that, and I do not desire to cover the same ground, but
I think every one is agreed that Federation would not
have been consummated if the States had felt that they
would lose the whole of the Customs revenue. One has
only to read the debates which took place when the
question was being discussed to realize that the States
have always considered that they had a moral right—
and it should have been a legal right—to a portion of
the Customs revenue. In a letter which Sir George
Reid wrote to the Premier of Victoria, he used , the
following words;—
I am more responsible than any man for the termination of
the Bratldon clause, but I never wished to allow the States
less than a fair share of the Customs and excise revenue,
which is the only way in which the States can receive revenue
from the masses of their inhabitants. The object of this
letter is to make that sure for all time.
The agreement made with the States in 1909 .deals with
the same question, and particularly mentions placing
the per capita payment upon a sound and permanent
basis. I think that every one present recognizes that
the States have always considered that they possessed
a moral right to the per capita payments, notwithstand-
ing the assertions made by the present Commonwealth
Government. It is well to examine the reasons for this
suggested departure. What are they? Since the Avar,
with all its obligations, the Commonwealth has been
able to meet its commitments, and, after making the per
capita payments to the States, has had money to burn.
I do not wish to introduce the suggestion that the Com-
monwealth is leaving the field of direct taxation for
political purposes, but, during the last five years, it has
been able to reduce taxation, and, with the Customs
revenue increasing, it should be able to make further
reductions while still meeting its responsibilities.
Therefore, what is the need for this, drastic altera-
tion, which will do so much damage to the States?
Is it because the Commonwealth intends to set about
a scheme of juccemeal unification, as suggested by Mr.
Allan?
Mr. ALLAH. —I am afraid so.
Mr. McCORMACK. —There must be some reason
for the proposals of the Commonwealth, but I hold that
if it keeps wi thin the ambit of its powers, there is no
need to take the capitation payments from the States,
though it may continue to reduce direct taxation. It
is admitted that the Commonwealth has had surpluses,
that it has found difficulty in dealing with them, and
that the taxpayers have pressed for a reduction of
taxation because of them; yet, having the same com-
mitments, it proposes to take away from the States the
sum of £7,000,000. If the Commonwealth wishes to
invade the field of State activities, it should do so
openly, with the consent of the people, and not in the
piecemeal manner which will result if the suggested
policy is adopted. I shall not agree to the proposal of
the Commonwealth to take action which will be of a
popular character unless it is prepared to accept
responsibility for State activities which are unpopular.
Mr. Bruce has said that he does not agree with the idea
of unification, but I feel that, in the minds of certain
members of the Commonwealth Government and
Parliament, there is a desire more and more to interfere
with those operations which rightly belong to the States.
It is an immoral thing for the Commonwealth to force
a proposal like this upon the States. We do not desire
it to engage in the construction of main roads, as we
can very well do such work ourselves. We do not want
the Commonwealth to create a duplicate organization
for the building of workers’ homes, because we already
have an organization which is carrying out its functions
very well. If we are to have unification, let the Com-
monwealth take the responsibility for the costly, un-
popular, and unproductive activities, as well as for those
which are popular and productive. It is not my desire
to enter into a discussion as to whether the proposals
are fair and equitable, as I believe that the whole basis


is entirely wrong. My Government is of opinion
that there is a moral obligation upon the Common-
wealth to continue the per capita payments. The idea
of federation w r ould never have been realized if the
people had felt that the Commonwealth Government
would do what is now suggested, so that the question as
to the manner in which the proposals would work does
not interest me. The Prime Minister’s statement makes
it appear first that there will be a concession to the
taxpayers, but, later it is said that it is not a scheme
to reduce taxation. It is difficult, then, to know what
it is. In order to appreciate the enormous extent to
which the Commonwealth has invaded tlie field of direct
taxation, one has only to look at the revenue which has
been obtained in this way since 1910. The land tax
has amounted to £32,179,000, the income tax to
£110,000,000, the estate duties • and death duties to
£12,000,000, and the amusement tax to nearly
£5,000,000, or a total of £173,500,000. In view' of those
figures, ■wo must regard -with some doubt the promise of
the Commonw'calth that it will go out of the field of
direct taxation. This Government may do so, but it
cannot commit future Governments. I am wholly
opposed to the proposals, because I think that the object
is cither unification —and Mr. Bruce has upificationists
surrounding him—or it is intended to interfere in
activities at present controlled by the States. There is
no financial need for the Commonwealth to do wdiat it
suggests, as is proved by its own budget figures. I
believe that Mr. Bruce does not w'ant unification, but
the Commonwealth Government will go a long W'ay
towards it if the States are deprived of their fair share
of the Customs revenue. It is a matter of surprise to
me that a Government, which has under its system a
Senate allegedly established to protect State rights,
could contemplate such action as this, and I shall
certainly watch with a good deal of interest the action
of the Senate when dealing with the proposals wdiich
the Commomvealth says it is determined to put through
Parliament. If there was ever an opportunity for the
Senate to justify its existence, that opportunity now
arises, and I believe that, in the last analysis, the
pressure of the people will prevent the Government
from carrying out its policy. I again emphasize the
point that there is no need to consult the States at all,
but, as the people who select the Federal representa-
tives are citizens of the States as well as of the
Commonwealth, I feel that, if we show our oppo-
sition to this scheme, pressure will be brought to bear
upon the Commonwealth Government to drop it, and
continue the system which has worked satisfactorily for
the last 26 years.
Mr. GUHH.—I think that it wmuld be w'earisome for
me to recapitulate the various arguments which have
been so ably advanced by the previous speakers, setting
out the moral claim of the. States to a continuance of
the per capita grant. The history of federation reeks
with abundant evidence that the States wore to get a
proportion of the Customs revenue, and I think that
Mr. Allan was quite right when he said that it was very
questionable whether federation would have been estab-
lished if it had not been for that definite assurance.
In presenting the case for the Commonwealth, Mr.
Bruce laboured two points as being the objectives of the
present proposals. First, it is desired to separate the
finances of the States and the Commonwealth, but Mr.
McCormack put the matter very well when he said that
that w r as merely an abstract principle, because the
Commonwealth is now' making largo grants to both
Western Australia and Tasmania. I venture to suggest
that, if these proposals become law, other States will put
forward claims for assistance. Ever since the States
have been in existence they have been making annual
grants to their local government bodies, so what
danger is there in the Commonwealth handing to the
States moneys which they do not collect themselves ? It
must be remembered that, when federation was accom-
plished, there was taken away from the States a
considerable source of revenue. Again, tbe State
Parliaments are subservient to the people, and they
cannot spend money unwisely without being brought up
with a round turn, because there are elections every
three years. The people would deal very drastically
with a Government which misused any money, whether
it was obtained by means of direct taxation, or from
the Commonwealth by way of a grant. Consequently,
there is not very much in the principle of separating
the finances of the States and the- Commonwealth, and I
do not wonder at the States resenting the implied feeling
in the mind' of the Commonwealth Government that
they are not spending the money wisely. It is then said
that there will be relief from taxation, but I am very
doubtful whether that objective will be achieved. There
will certainly be no relief so far as South Australia is
concerned. On the contrary, a greater burden will be
imposed upon the people, because the field which the
Commonwealth proposes to evacuate will not afford
ns an amount sufficient to recoup our loss. We know
the figures in South Australia, as we collect the income
tax for the Commonwealth, and it is estimated that
there will be a further burden of £209,725 imposed
upon the taxpayers in that State. lam probably right
in assuming that similar mistakes in calculation have
been made in regard to other States, though the
Treasurers in those States are not in the same happy
position as myself, in that the Commonwealth has its
own officers collecting the revenue.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—The figures which form the
basis of our memorandum were supplied by the Deputy
Commissioners in the different States.
Mr. ALLAH.—Our officers say practically the same
as Mr. Gunn is saying.
Mr. GUHH.—I would like to see the questions which
Dr. Earle Page submitted to the Deputy Commissioner
of Taxes in South Australia. He is with mo to-day,
and has supplied me with the figures.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—Wo asked for the total assess-
ments for the financial year 1924-25.
Mr. GUHH. —Evidently you were at cross purposes,
because, according to the officers who collect your taxes,
your figures are all wrong. Consequently, the second
objective of the Commonwealth will not be achieved.
Then it is stated that the desire is to make the altera-
tion without dislocating the finances of the States,
which would be a very laudable objective if the proposal
were sound. How, I think that I speak for all the
States when I say that every State is having the
greatest difficulty in balancing its accounts.
Mr. ALLAH.—That is true.
Mr. GUHH.—I do not know one State which is
financing as soundly as is the Commonwealth, which
is able to make adequate provision for all its com-
mitments in accordance with the strictest rules of
accountancy, because it has an overflowing Treasury.
It provides for sinking funds, and it meets interest
from revenue where it should do so, but I wonder how
many States are able to meet the great burden of
interest upon the Soldiers Settlement Scheme from
revenue. Is there one? I think it will be found that
in every State the interest has been capitalized, and
is still being capitalized, which cannot be called sound
finance. .
Mr. McCORMACK. —We are not doing that.
Mr. GUHH.—I am glad to hear it; but, on the other
hand, is Queensland providing an adequate sinking
fund? It is not. Therefore, I say that not one State
is financing in such a sound manner as is the Common-
wealth.
Mr. McCORMACK.—We are doing what the Loan
Council provides.
Mr. GUHH.—Rut that is only in relation to a few
loans during recent months.


Mr. ALLAN.—The States are not providing ade-
quate sinking funds, for the simple reason that they
have not the money.
Mr. GUNN.—I wonder how many States will he
able to carry on during the present year without in-
creasing taxation. I suggest that some States will find
it very difficult to do so. It will be seen, therefore,
that the States have so many of their own troubles
that the Commonwealth cannot impose this new burden
upon them without seriously dislocating their finances.
For these reasons, I submit that none of the objectives
of the Commonwealth will be achieved. It is apparent
from the speeches which have already been made that
the present proposals have no friends here, and I do not
think that they will obtain support in any part of Aus-
tralia. Who is asking for the arrangement, and what
need is there for it? The Commonwealth is not in any
financial difficulty. It has been stated with truth that
its difficulty is to find a use for the surpluses, which
many people believed would go to the States. I am
aware that, as a result of the High Court decision
defining the word “ surpluses,” the Commonwealth has
transferred such moneys to various trust accounts, and
the States have not received one penny, although, up to
1024, the surpluses have amounted to £10,000,000. In
this connexion, it is interesting to note what Mr.
Andrew Fisher said in his second-reading speech upon
the matter. He said —
Honorable members will see that there is a provision which
compels the Commonwealth to pay to the States any surplus
there may be over the sum necessary for the promised pay-
ment of 255. per head.
I suppose it will be said that I should read that section
in conjunction with the definition of “ surpluses ” as
laid down by the High Court, but the fact*remains that
Mr. Fisher told the States that surpluses would be
distributed among the States over and above the 255.
per capita. However, the Commonwealth sought new
uses for those surpluses, and so it indulged in helping
the States with roads, wire-netting, and many other
requirements, but I say that the money would be better
utilized if it were handed direct to the States in
accordance with the provisions of the Surplus Revenue
Act. If there be no need for these proposals, why
should they be inflicted on the States at the present
time, and cause great dislocation of State finances,
when nothing can be achieved. I submit that the
wisest course to adopt is to withdraw the proposals.
Surely the States have some right to the Customs
revenue. Income tax is a diminishing quantity, and
the figures prepared by the income tax officials show
that, instead of expecting the yearly increases shown in
the memorandum, we can expect quite the opposite
result. Account has not been taken of the fact that
the wheat harvest for this year is very much less than
it was in previous years, and that the price of wool
has fallen considerably. When we collect the income
tax for next year from the returns for this year, the
amount will have decreased, not increased. There will
be no reduction of the burdens upon the people from
the proposals, and I urge that they be withdrawn.
They will not achieve anything which you have set out
to achieve, but they will dislocate the finances of the
States and will have the tendency to drive more States
to the Commonwealth for assistance, as certain States
have already been driven. Therefore, I submit that
you should act very carefully and not proceed with
the proposals at this juncture. I wish to reiterate the
claim made by the other speakers that the States have
a right to a share of the Customs tariff. That is some-
thing which is fixed, but income tax is not. We might
reasonably ask for an increase over and above the sum
of 255. because of the added burdens on the States
consequent on the war. The great bulk of the soldiers’
settlement expenditure has fallen upon the States, and
the State Treasurers could have made quite as good a
case for the States as you did for the Commonwealth,
in asking for an increased grant from the Common-
wealth. As you make greater inroads into the func-
tions of the States, the Commonwealth will be con-
trolling more revenue which rightly belongs to the
States, until such time as the people say by a referen-
dum that those functions shall be handed over. The
question of the roads is an example of where more than
one State and the Commonwealth are at variance at
present. I am sorry that some States have agreed in
that matter, because the States will become dependent
on the Commonwealth in the future, and the Common-
wealth will dictate the expenditure of that money. The
State is the proper authority to control that expendi-
ture, because it knows its needs. I submit that the
proposals should be withdrawn, as they are not accept-
able to the States. I say that it would be a very serious
matter if you used the legal power you have to force
on the States something which they are unwilling to
accept.
Mr. COLLIER.—I am sorry, if only for the sake of
varying the line of argument that I am compelled to join
the chorus of dissent expressed by previous speakers.
However, it would serve no good purpose, except to
waste time, were I to go over the field which has already
been traversed by my colleagues. I suggest that the time
is opportune for us to survey the financial position of
the States and the Commonwealth during the past 25
years. If that be done, it will be seen that the
Commonwealth has found itself in the happy position
of having ample funds to meet all its legitimate
functions, and, as has been pointed out, in later years
it has had more money than was actually required for
the functions of government. It has been stated that
the surplus for the past eight or ten years has amounted
to something like £10,000,000. While that has been the
case on the one hand —that is, the Commonwealth has
been, what one might say, almost embarrassed with a
surplus of funds —it is an undeniable fact that during
the same period the States have been embarrassed in
an entirely opposite direction.. Most of the States have
found it very difficult to carry on, and I suppose the
majority of them have accumulated very considerable
deficits during those years. Without any close examina-
tion of the figures, it seems to me that, on the face of
it, the Commonwealth has been raising more funds
than have really been required, and that tbe States have
not been able to raise sufficient money for their
requirements. Without attempting to enter upon a
criticism of the policy of the Federal Government, I
think that the Commonwealth would not have embarked
upon some of the spheres of activity, which I contend
are an invasion of the State functions, if it had not
possessed money which it scarcely knew what to do
with. I refer to the money which is being found for
grants for roads to the States, and the proposal to enter
into housing schemes, each, I believe, to cost
£20,000,000, or a total of £40,000,000, during the next
ten years. That being the case since federation, and
bearing in mind that the only stable basis of income
on which the States have been able to rely has been the
per capita payments, I say that the whole of our history
points to the fact that it is entirely undesirable that any
alteration should be made at the present moment. As
has already been stated, the States have been able to
estimate tbe amount they will receive from the Com-
monwealth under the per capita payments, and that
has been a stable basis of income. If it be with-
drawn, we will have to depend upon the receipts from
income tax, which, as has been pointed out, are a
fluctuating quantity. That is especially so in the State
of Western Australia, which is a primary producing
State, with no manufacturing or secondary industries,
and there our income depends almost entirely on wool
and wheat, which are dependent in turn on tbe seasons
and upon the prices obtained overseas. If the per
capita payments are withdrawn, the States will be


embarrassed. I suggest that tbe Commonwealth would
bo able to withdraw in a very few years from this field
of taxation, which it is now proposed to leave to the
States, without withdrawing the per capita payments.
The figures show that the receipts from this source
have been reduced in the past five years by five and a
half million pounds, and, inasmuch as direct taxation
was a war measure, the liabilities and responsibilities
of the Commonwealth, so far as concerns expenditure
incurred during the war, must, as the years go by, bo
a diminishing quantity. The taxpayers of Australia
submitted to the imposition of this tax because of the
circumstances which rendered it necessary —that is, the
war —and I believe that the taxpayers will willingly
continue to pay that tax, in addition to the income tax
imposed by the States, so long as the expenditure of
what might be classed as war expenditure renders it
necessary for it to be imposed; but as that expen-
diture decreases—and it is a diminishing quantity
year by year—l believe the Commonwealth can con-
tinue to reduce the tax, as it did last year and in
previous years, until it disappears altogether. I believe
that the financial position of the Commonwealth will
enable it to do that and still continue the per capita
payments to the States. Ido not wish to reiterate the
arguments which have been advanced in regard to the
moral obligation of the Commonwealth to honour this
per capita arrangement, but I do not think any one
will deny that, had that provision been in the Consti-
tution, although only for ten years, wo would not have
achieved Federation at that period.
We know that the Prime Minister is opposed to unifi-
cation, but a very great advance can unconsciously be
made in that direction. If the Commonwealth, by
the use of surplus moneys, is able to go beyond what I
believe are the real functions of the Federation—and
certainly it has entered into a sphere which was never
contemplated by the framers of the Constitution—the
States will only accept that position because they have
not the money to defray further expenditure. We
would prefer to find the money ourselves for some
of the functions now undertaken by the Common-
wealth, but we have to accept the bounty of
the Commonwealth because we have not the means to
enable us to carry out that work. That being the case,
the alteration now proposed will undoubtedly weaken
the financial stability of the States. It will strengthen
the body which is already strong, will weaken the
bodies which are already weak, and, I believe,
will damage the Federal spirit. The Commonwealth
knows that it is giving up something which, in a sense,
is unsubstantial because a Federal income tax is not a
permanent impost. It has never been contended that
the Commonwealth has invaded the field of direct taxa-
tion permanently, consequently it would be
ing something which is only of a fleeting character that
must disappear with the years. In return, the Com-
monwealth asks the States to yield something which the
States, from the inception of Federation, have regarded
as essential to their very existence. I hope that the
Commonwealth will continue the per capita payments,
and I am certain that such a course will be to the in-
terests of all, because, if the States are weakened finan-
cially, the Commonwealth will suffer. I believe that I
am voicing the opinion of the whole of the people of
Western Australia when I say that they stand firmly
for the retention of the per capita payments, because
they know those payments form a suitable basis for
financing the State needs. If we are forced to increase
our taxation, our financial difficulties in Western Aus-
tralia will be much greater in the future than they have
been.
Mr. LYONS.—It would be idle for me to attempt
to add to the case which has been put forward by the
representatives of the other States, and were it not for
the fact that the proposals submitted by the Common-
wealth would be so far-reaching in their effects upon
the smaller States, it would not be necessary for me
even to place on record my attitude in regard to this
matter. Whatever effects those proposals may have
upon the more populous and wealthy States of the Com-
monwealth, they will certainly prove much more seri-
ous in the case of the smaller States. In regard to the
moral obligation upon the Commonwealth to continue
the per capita grants to the States, there can be no
doubt that, from the inception of the Federation, they
were of opinion that they had a right to some share of
the Customs and excise revenue. Mr. Allan put the
matter in a nutshell when he said that, had there been
any suggestion when the campaign was in progress for
the establishment of Federation that the Common-
wealth would, one day, withdraw from the States the
financial support embodied in the Constitution, and
that, in addition, it would even encroach upon the field
of income tax and other spheres which previously had
been the exclusive domain of the States, the people of
Australia would not have accepted Federation. What-
ever may have been in the minds of the framers of the
Constitution, and those who took part subsequently in
the various conferences, there is not the slightest doubt
that the taxpayers of the various States were of opinion
that this definite assistance would always be forthcom-
ing. You, Mr. Chairman, have said that the fact that
the Surplus Revenue Act was so named shows that the
contributions by the Commonwealth to the Stales were
to come out of any surplus revenue. I think that is only
half stating the case, because, in addition to the matters
already brought forward by Mr. McKell, it is necessary
to point out that the Surplus Revenue Act also con-
templated the alternative of the Commonwealth taking
over a portion of the State debts, and the payment of
the interest upon those debts. That is actually pro-
vided by the act. Had the Commonwealth done that
there would not have been any question of whether it was
at any time in a position to withdraw from its financial
obligations, because it would have had to continue
ro pay the interest on those debts. As has been pointed
out, the words, “ Until the Commonwealth otherwise
provides ” do not mean that the Commonwealth can
terminate the capitation payments altogether, and thft
view was that which was accepted by those who, at
the end of the first period set for the operation of the
Braddon section, had to deal with those words. They
did not terminate it, but they made substantial finan-
cial provision for the States. That shows that they
interpreted the matter in an entirely different way
from that which is now put forward. From whatever
angle these matters are viewed, we must recognize that
the people of Australia expected that the per capita
grant would be continued, and that the States would get
some portion of the Customs revenue. That is the main
point which we have to consider. Either the States
are entitled to these payments or they are not. We
have also to study the figures which have heen sub-
mitted to the States by the Commonwealth Government
in its memorandum to them. The figures which were
placed before my State will not bear examination, and
they cannot be accepted as accurate or reliable. Dr.
Page has said that the Deputy Commissioners of the
various States were asked to give the assessment
figures. But they could only obtain the figures for the
assessments within the States, and they could not do
anything with the assessments from the central office.
Apparently the collections in the various States have
been taken.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—The assessments have been
taken. Tasmania has been provided for by an extra
grant.
Mr. LYONS.—The memorandum states: “As
portion of the Federal Income Tax is collected by the
Central Taxation Office, and the exact amount thereof
attributable to each State is not available, the collec-
tions of the Central Taxation Office, have been divided


amongst the States in proportion to population.”
Nothing cruder could he imagined. If, as a basis, we
took the assessments within the States, and then dis-
tributed the Central Office collections on that basis,
wo should get somewhere near to justice, but I say
we could not do anything cruder than to take the
population figures. No one would contend that the
lax-paying capacity of Tasmania per head of popu-
lation is as great as that of Victoria, for instance.
Mr. GUNN.—The Central Office might deal mostly
with companies.
Mr. LYONS. —Yes. Even dealing with individuals,
it has been proved statistically that the tax-paying
capacity of my State is less than that of the bigger
States, and if we are going to deal with this matter
on a population basis, wo at once offset the field
that the Commonwealth is leaving to the States.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—In that case, will you argue
that you should receive a smaller per capita grant than
the other States?
Mr. LYONS.— No. One of the reasons why 1
adhere to the per capita system, is that it is a method
which is truly Eederal in principle. Under the per
capita system, the Commonwealth collects from all the
States and all the people of Australia, and, regardless
of the taxpaying abilities of the individuals in each
State, it returns the money on a per capita basis to the
States, which is a truly Federal system. That is one
of the principal points I think the States should ad-
vance for the retention of the per capita system. It
is suggested in the memorandum that in the case of
other federations, assistance is given to the smaller,
less populous, and poorer States. There is no proposal
here to do that, but there is a proposal to take away
from the States the per capita system, which automati-
cally gives to the smaller States that relief to which
the representatives of the bigger States are offering
no opposition, so we shall lose substantially, quite
apart from any principle which may be involved.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—You have found that relief is
not sufficient for your needs?
Mr. LYONS. —That is so, and it has not pre-
vented the Commonwealth, from generously granting
us further assistance to enable us to overcome our
financial difficulties.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—It is very difficult to find the
money for you when we are paying it to the other
States.
Mr. LYONS.—There does not seem to have been
any difficulty in the past, as you have had surpluses
which you have not known how to spend. Under the
present system a definite protection is afforded to the
smaller States. In Tasmania, we collect the taxation
on behalf of the Commonwealth, so that we know
exactly the amount assessed, and the amount received.
After allowing for the distribution of the central office
collections, taking the actual assessments of the State
within the State, we find that instead of the sum of
£201,000 indicated in the proposals as the amount of
taxation which is being handed over to us, we shall
only have a sum of £149,000. At the end of the
third year—l92B-9—under the proposals we shall
have to impose taxation to the extent of £130,000 upon
a population of slightly over 200,000, in order to
meet our obligations. That means placing upon the
people of my State an extra burden of over 10s. per
head at the end of two years. In the memorandum,
the years 1918 to 1924 have been taken in order to
show the annual rate of increase in the value of pro-
duction, which was 6.7 per, cent.; but it must not be
forgotten that in 1918 there began an extraordinary
rise in prices throughout Australia, which continued
until the middle of 1920. That five-year period, there-
fore, is specially advantageous, and it is upon it that
the percentage of 6.7 is fixed as a basis for the annual
growth of production in the future.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—-If we had included another
year, the figure would have been higher.
Mr. UYONS. —Yes, if you had included the year at
the end of the period, when there was an abnormal
increase in the price of wool throughout Australia,
it would have altered the calculation. As a
matter of fact, during the five-year period used
to establish the basis, almost the whole of the
increase occurred in the years 1920-1. From then to
1924 there was practically no increase—or less
than 1 per cent. Viewing the position from our
stand-point, it is clear that the field which is to be left
to us is entirely overstated. Under the proposals, our
position will be worse than it is at present, quite apart
from the fact that the principle involved is one
which cannot be accepted by the States. The point
that one authority should not raise what another
authority expends has been dealt with by the other
Premiers. It was pointed out by Mr. McCormack
that it is a bit late in the day to put forward that con-
tention. The Commonwealth has been raising ' the
money and handing it over to the States for the pa.st
25 or 26 years, and all'the States grant subsidies to
municipalities for the work which they carry out.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—But the Commonwealth pro-
poses to discontinue the payments.
Air. LYONS. —If the principle is wrong, we had no
right to . accept the reparation payments from Ger-
many. If it be right for one nation to raise the
money and for another to spend it, surely there is
nothing wrong in collecting at one centre revenue from
the whole of the people and spending it for the benefit
of the same people in six different States. The economy
which will be effected by the Commonwealth leaving
this field is so infinitesimal as to be unworthy of
consideration. I agree with the other Premiers that
this is not the time for the Commonwealth to come for-
ward with such a proposition. If it be contended that
this question was submitted to the people of Australia
at the last Federal election, as I understand it was, the
Prime Minister will, no doubt, admit that that election
was decided upon an entirely different issue, and this
matter was allowed to pass unnoticed by the electors of
Australia. It is still very easy for the Commonwealth
to ascertain the views of the people upon the subject.
The Commonwealth may say that, because it has the
legislative power to carry this proposal into effect, it
does not intend to refer the question to the people; but
I do not think that it should attempt to do anything
not approved by the people. Therefore, when the
Commonwealth takes the proposed referendum upon
other questions, these proposals should also be re-
ferred to the people, so that all the problems can
be dealt with at the one time. We know the questions
which were placed before the country when federation
was brought into existence, and I think that we should
tell the people of Australia the whole of the facts, from
the point of view of the Commonwealth and of the
States and allow them to decide.
Mr. GUNN.—The proposals could be made a third
question in connexion with the proposed referendum.
Air. LYONS.—Yes. So far as we are concerned,
we are opposed to the proposals. The Commonwealth
are supporting them, but, after all, the people are the
masters of the situation. I suggest that if the Prime
Alinister is not prepared to withdraw the proposals, he
should take advantage of the opportunity which will
present itself very shortly to place the whole situation
before the people.
Sir ALEXANDER PEACOCK.—AII the States
with the exception of Victoria are represented by their
Premiers and Treasurers, and the Victorian Cabinet


has asked me to attend as Treasurer. I do not
propose to traverse the ground which has been covered
by those who have preceded me, and I am generally
in accord with the views expressed by the Premier
of Victoria. I do not look on this Conference in the
same way as does the Premier of Queensland, who says
that you have invited us here for the purpose of bar-
gaining. We represent the same people in our re-
spective spheres. Upon the Prime Minister of the
Commonwealth there arc certain obligations imposed
by the Constitution, and we, in the States, have cer-
tain obligations imposed upon us. In my view, the
language of the concluding paragraph of the
memorandum states the spirit in which we
should approach this subject. I am sure that
it is not desired to place the governments
of the States in a different position. As we re-
present the same people, we should have in view
the interests of those people. The proposals now put
before us are based upon the principle of abolishing the
per capita payments. As lam the only delegate present
who was a member of the Convention which framed
the Constitution, I wish to remind you that there were
great difficulties to be surmounted. I think that the
greatest problem of all was that of finance.
The Convention sat in Adelaide for several weeks,
when an adjournment took place to enable the people
of the respective colonies to learn what the change
would mean. The State Parliaments discussed the
matter at great length, and then the Convention met
again in Sydney. Another adjournment was granted
so that the State Parliaments might bo further edu-
cated as to the meaning of the change, the principal
question still being that of finance. The Convention
finally met in Melbourne, when the Constitution was
accepted, and a referendum was taken. With regard
to the question of the capital site, there had to be a
conference of Premiers, after which another referen-
dum was held. I assure you that, at the Convention,
the main contention was that the States could not carry
on their work and meet their respective obligations
unless they had a share in the Customs revenue, which
was then their main source of revenue. Finally, what
is known as the Braddon clause was put into the Con-
stitution. The view put to the Convention was that
the Federal Parliament could be trusted, because it re-
presented the same people as did the State Parliaments,
but at no time was it suggested that the States would not
share in the Customs revenue. What happened in 1909-
1910 in connexion with the Surplus Revenue Act is fresh
in our memories. A conference was held at which
Mr. Watt, Acting Prime Minister, indicated that the
time had come when there should be a gradual reduc-
tion in the per capita payments. That scheme was not
persevered with for the reasons which have been stated
by the different speakers to-day. It would be just as
wrong for the Federal Government, with the undoubted
power it possesses, to bring down a measure wiping put
the payments altogether, as it wnuld be for it to intro-
duce a proposal to alter the site of the Federal Capital.
There is no suggestion to review that question at pre-
sent, nor has there been any point raised in regard to
the representation of the States in the Federal Parlia-
ment. It is wrong for the Commonwealth Government
to say that it has a right to claim the whole of the
Customs revenue, and that the States have no share in
it. To make any change without the people being con-
sulted appears to me to be unfair, quite apart from the
question of dislocating our finances. If the present pro-
posals are prosecuted, I am advised by my income tax
officials that, instead of there being a gain of £227,000
to Victoria, there will be a loss of £300,000. When the
proposals were first seen, it was thought by some people
that they would obtain relief from taxation, but there
is no hope of any decrease in income tax in Victoria
if the per capita payment ceases. The memorandum
points that there will be a check on expenditure if
the States have to raise their own revenue, as that
will be an inducement to economy. Therefore, if
the States are to have all the direct taxation, and the
Commonwealth all the indirect taxation, the criticism
against the Commonwealth in the matter of direct taxa-
tion will bo reduced to a minimum. Yesterday the
Prime Minister conveyed the impression that there had
been a referendum and that the people of Australia
had decided that the provision in regard to the annual
payment of 255. per capita to the States was not to be
continued indefinitely.
Mr. COLLIER. —It was not to he inserted in the
Constitution.
Sir ALEXANDER PEACOCK—It was not to be
inserted in the Constitution. At that time, numbers of
people voted against the proposal to embody the per
capita payments in the Constitution, because they did
not believe in the Commonwealth being hamstrung. A
great many others did so because they thought the
States were not getting a fair deal from the Common-
wealth. As we all represent the same people, and as
there was a contract made at the Convention which
every one of the State Parliaments adopted on three
occasions, it would be a breach of faith if the Com-
monwealth Government proceeded, with the proposals
set forth in its memorandum, without first having a
distinct mandate from the people. Rut I do not think
the Prime Minister is absolutely committed to that
memorandum. I read it as an invitation to attend this
Conference for the purpose of ascertaining what are
the views of the States as to how these proposals will
affect them. The Prime Minister has heard from the
six responsible leaders in the State Parliaments how
they view the Commonwealth scheme, and I hope—
although we cannot expect him to announce his decision
immediately, seeing that he will naturally desire to con-
sult his colleagues—that, at no distant date, he will
reconsider his position, and refrain from proceeding
with these proposals. It would be better for all if,
instead of extending the field of taxation upon which
the Commonwealth has entered Alice the outbreak of
war, it gradually reduced the area of its taxing activi-
ties, and left the States in undisputed possession of
their legitimate domain. Even if the Prime Minister
gives effect to this scheme, there is nothing to prevent
a future Commomvealth Government bringing down
other proposals. The matter rests entirely with the
Commonwealth, and I trust, after having heard the
views presented at this Conference, the right honorable
gentleman will give those views every consideration,
and that he will see his way clear not to proceed with
the proposals in regard to the cessation of the per
capita payments.
Mr. McKELL.—In reply to Dr. Earle Page, we con-
tend that there is a portion of the tax which is at pre-
sent collected by the Commonwealth which could not be
collected by the States.
Sir ALEXANDER PEACOCK.—I think that is a
matter for the exports to decide.
Mr. BRUCE. —In most cases, the Premiers of the
States are also the State Treasurers. I am not the
Commonwealth Treasurer, and it is only fair that the
Commonwealth Treasurer should put his views before
the Conference.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—As the custodian of the
Federal finances which impinge at so many points
upon the State finances, I congratulate the Premiers
and Treasurers of the various States upon the restraint
with which they have discussed this question to-day.
It is undoubtedly recognized that wo are all here for
a very definite purpose, viz., to improve, if we can,
the conditions of all the people of the Commomvealth,
because the various Governments are simply different
agencies for them, although we may differ amongst our-
selves as to the best method of dealing with this question
of finance. At the outset, it must be recognized that the


people themselves are not affected at all. A certain
amount of taxation has to be raised by the whole of the
Governments of Australia, and what we are really dis-
cussing is which Government, or set of Governments,
should collect that taxation.
I regret that though three years ago the principle
which we have laid down in this memorandum was
regarded as embodying a proper line of demarcation
between Federal and State finance, and one which was
practically accepted by five out of the six State
Governments, a complete change of attitude has been
witnessed to-day, no Premier or Treasurer having put
forward a constructive alternative to the proposals of
the Commonwealth Government.
Mr. GUXX. —At what Conference did five out of
six States agree to these proposals?
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—The Conference in 1923. The
official record of that Conference will bear out the
statement I have made. It is very interesting to hear
the men who, when they were previously discuss-
ing these proposals, said that they were completely
in favour of unification, now opposing the sceheme
which the Commonwealth has brought forward, on the
ground that they fear that it will ultimately lead to
unification. I ask members of the Conference whether
anybody really seriously thinks that the mere taking
away of the par capita payments from the States can
possibly bring about unification? If action in that
direction were a sine qua non to the bringing about of
unification, surely the other great federations of the
world would have been unified years ago. The United
States of America, which have -been a federation for
150 years, has never made any per capita payments to
its States, and yet it remains a federation. Canada
does not make payments upon this basis at all, while
Switzerland levies a certain amount from its cantons.
Mr. McKELL.—You do not suggest that we should
occupy a similar position to the provinces of Canada?
Dr. EARLE PAGE. —Xo; but I do suggest that the
States of Australia are in an identical position with
the States of the United States of America. The
suggestion that a proposition such as we are putting
forward can in any way tend to unification is obviously
absurd. The object behind our proposals is to secure
federation to the Australian States for all time, and to
insist that there shall be a proper Federal basis, which
will assuredly be brought about if there be a distinct
separation of their finances. The dependence of one of
the States, or of a series of .States, on the Common-
wraith, especially dependence such as we see it to-day,
which causes us to pay money to the States under an
Act, the time limit of which expired some six or seven
years ago, constitutes a very serious state of affairs
indeed. The position is one which can be altered in a
moment by the Commonwealth Parliament, but if legis-
lative action be taken, instead of the States maintaining
their present financial position they may find themselves
suddenly deprived of the per capita payments with no
field of taxation surrendered to them, and no conces-
tions whatever. The view that the proposal of the Com-
monwealth Government can lead to unification, or is in
any way a step towards it, is one which cannot be sus-
tained for a moment. When one examines the other
federations of the world, one naturally asks, “ Why
have they never had such a system as the one we have in
Australia ? ”
Sir ALEXAXDER PEACOCK.—Their circum-
stances are different.
Dr. EARLE PAGE. —If we look at the federation
of the American colonies, which took place after the
Revolutionary War, we find a very definite reason why
there _wa a no insistence on the part of .the States to
participate in the Customs revenue. That reason was
that each of those States had a war debt which was in-
curred during the fight for independence. Because the
Federal Government was taking over the States’ in-
debtedness in regard to that matter, the question was
not seriously discussed, and was not incorporated in the
American Constitution. That was the position in
the United States of America. What is the position
in Australia? When we federated, as the late Mr.
Alfred Deakin said on many occasions, we did not
do so under the stress of war or trouble as the
United States did, but under peaceful conditions. The
arrangement that wo are now discussing is one which
will apply to abnormal conditions. It is quite evi-
dent —and Sir Alexander Peacock will agree with me—
that, during the whole of the discussions" at the Federal
Conventions, it was always recognized that if a serious
catastrophe happened, such as war, the Commonwealth
Government should not merely have the amount it
derived from Customs, but all sorts of revenue at its
disposal, to enable it to properly carry out national
activities.
Mr. ALLAX.—Xono of us questions that fact.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—It is recognized in our Con-
stitution that the States are entitled to any surplus re-
venue that the Commonwealth has; but can anybody
seriously maintain that, when the Commonwealth Go-
vernment is loaded with an unproductive war debt of
over £300,000,000, it has surplus revenue? That is a
debt which differs entirely from the debt that the States
carry. They carry a debt which is, presumably, for
reproductive works. Though some of it is not very
reproductive the bulk of it has been borrowed upon the
assumption that ultimately it will bring about increased
wealth in the community; but the burden which the
Commonwealth carries is entirely unproductive, whilst
every effort that it makes—and I think it will be ad-
mitted that it has made efforts to reduce that debt—im-
proves the position of the States by enabling more
money at better rates to be made available for their
development.
Mr. GUXX.—This proposal will not liquidate that
debt.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—If we do what has been sug-
gested here to-day, surrender the field of income tax, it
will assist. But if we were to give up the collection of
income tax and continued to make the per capita pay-
ments to States, the chances of our being' able to pay into
a sinking fund for the extinction of our war debt would
be very remote. If one examines the position of the
Customs revenue in Australia it will be found that, at
the present time, it is, roughly, £39,000,000. The war
expenditure is £29,000,000 annually, of which over
£20,000,000 represents interest on our war debt, and
this amount is increasing, for the reason that a certain
number of tax-free loans were floated during the war at
4} per cent., which we now find it necessary to convert
at rates which go up to 6 per cent. The result is that
we have to take an increasing amount annually from
revenue for that purpose.
I would like to correct an impression which seems to
be abroad, that there is some prospect of this amount
being lessened. There is no such prospect, because,
under the provisions of our Sinking Fund Act, we pay
the interest on all cancelled debt into the Sinking Fund,
thus making it a compound interest proposition. So
that, right up to the time when we wipe out the debt,
we will bo practically carrying the same load on a 50
years’ basis. That is why I interjected that it will bo
50 years before the people of Australia can expect to be
free from the war debt which we are carrying at the
present time.
The other deductions from that amount are for war
pensions. The figures do not bear out the contention
which has been put forward that we have a declining
expenditure in this respect. The expenditure last
year was practically the highest that we have
had up to the present time. We are assured


by the Repatriation Department that there is
no indication of this expenditure lessening. It
keeps on demanding from me as Treasurer the same
sum, or a larger sum, each year, to meet that ex-
penditure. We have no indications that its demand
will decline, because relief from liability resulting from
the death of soldiers is more than offset by the number
of pensioners added to the list on account of births. Of
course, these new citizens are welcome, because they are
the class of immigrants required in this country. Those
pensions absorb three-quarters of the total Customs
revenue. Will anybody seriously maintain that, in
such circumstances, any Convention framing the
Federal Constitution would suggest that the Common-
wealth Government should return to the States three-
fourths of its total Customs revenue? It would be
impossible for anybody to suggest that for a moment,
because, even if we had not federated, we would still
have had to enter the war as partners of the British
Empire. We would have had to make the same sacri-
fices to keep the flag of freedom flying, and in the Im-
perial cause; we would still have the same war debt to
carry, with the resultant heavy interest bill. The
Commonwealth has met its obligations by increasing
taxation. Without Federation, the States, in order to
carry their war debt, would have had to raise the income
tax to the point reached by the Commonwealth.
The other expenditure which exhausts the balance of
the Customs revenue, is an obligation Avhich has been
taken from the States since the consummation of Fede-
ration —I refer to the payment of old-age pensions.
That burden was being carried by three of the
States, and, in order to make it uniform throughout
Australia, the Commonwealth, in 1908, agreed to take
over old-age pensions, which are costing us £9,000,000
a year. In other words, war expenditure and old-
age pensions, which, if we had not federated, no State
could have avoided, have absorbed practically the
whole of the Customs revenue up to the present time.
It is idle to suggest, when the whole of the Customs
revenue is absorbed by these two items, that the per
capita payments are made out of Customs revenue. No-
body can seriously contend that for a moment. If one
examines the Commonwealth departmental expenditure
—and we are charged with having made all sorts of
incursions into State activities, charges with which the
Prime Minister can deal better than I can—the record
of Commonwealth Government departmental expendi-
ture show that, ever since the war ended, we have con-
tinuously reduced that expenditure, the respective
figures being;—l92l-2, £2,952,435; 1925-6, £2,743,711.
This proves that, although the population of the Com-
monwealth has been increasing all the time, wo have
kept down the whole of the expenditure that we can
control.
Mr. GUNN. —The expenditure on Defence is kept
separately ?
Dr. EARLE PAGE. —The Defence expenditure is
kept separately, and amounts to £5,400,000. Of that
sum £400,000 is provided out of loan moneys. If we
add to the war expenditure of £29,000,000 a sum of
£5,000,000 for defence, and £9,000,000 for old-age
pensions, we get a total of £43,000,000, which is
£4,000,000 more than the Customs revenue. These are
essentially services which the States would have had to
provide, because, if they had not federated, they would
not have dreamed of remaining undefended after their
experience of the past twelve years.
It is also suggested that the Commonwealth Govern-
ment has enjoyed constant luxurious surpluses, when, as
a fact, during the last twelve years we have had five
deficits. Mr. McKell suggested that the Customs
revenue is a much more stable source of revenue than
the income tax. I think every economist will admit
that the income tax is the much more stable source of
revenue.
Sir ALEXANDER PEACOCK.—If that be so, why
do you not keep it?
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—Looking at the records of the
past five years, it will be found that, in the years when
prices declined —in 1921-1922, for example—there was
a drop of 16 per cent, in Customs revenue, whereas there
was a decrease in the amount of income tax assessed
of only about 3 per cent. Customs duties are the result
of two things—first of all exports, which are
dependent on the seasons, because the bulk are the
primary products of the country, and essentially
dependent on the season. Inside Australia we have
the secondary industries, which are independent, to
some extent, of the seasons. Thus, it must be manifest
to everybody that the income tax is a much more stable
source of revenue than are Customs duties. Another
factor in the collection of greater Customs duties is the
large sums of money borrowed abroad, but this is not the
most stable basis on which to build a system of taxa-
tion. One does not know what amount of money we
shall be able to borrow overseas during any year—many
Treasurers hope that it will be substantial, but there
must be years in which it will be difficult to control
conditions which may be responsible for a very consider-
able diminution in the amount of revenue collected from
Customs duties. I think anybody who has considered
this matter closely must come to the conclusion that the
income tax is a more stable field for the raising of
revenue than is the Customs Department.
Refore dealing with the figures which appear in this
memorandum, I would like to touch lightly upon several
matters. It has been suggested that the moral position
is such that the States, no matter in what condition the
Commonwealth finances may be, are reasonably entitled
to some portion of the Commonwealth revenue. I have
studied very carefully the history of events leading up
to the federation, and I know that this very financial
clause was the subject of most heated discussion, and
that it suffered many vicissitudes indeed. In Quick
and Garran’s Annotated Constitution of the Australian
Commonwealth, at page 198, it is pointed out that, in
Sydney, the Adelaide guarantee of permanence under
some arrangement such as this was completely thrown
to the winds. The whole matter of the future, relations
of the Commonwealth and States was left to the Com-
monwealth Parliament, and only the next day, in the
small hours of the morning, was the Braddon clause
inserted by a vote of 21 to IS of the Convention. Strong
opposition to the Bill developed in New South Wales,
and the late Sir George Reid, who was Premier of that
State at the time, secured the alteration of the clause
to make it operative for ten years, and to read as it
does at the present time. After that clause had been
inserted, the Constitution was adopted by the people
of all the States. They were satisfied that the Common-
wealth Parliament was the body to deal with this
matter. The ten years having passed, we reached the
period of the agreement between the Prime Minister of
the Commonwealth and the Premiers of the various
States, which Mr. McKell has read in detail. That agree-
ment was submitted for the ratification of the people
by way of referendum, and was defeated. It was
defeated largely by the efforts of the Labour party,
who attributed its rejection to the inclusion in the
Constitution of any per capita payments. If one reads
the debates which took place on the Surplus Revenue
Bill in the Commonwealth Parliament, it will be seen
that, in the first place, it was held that the defeat of
that agreement left the Commonwealth Parliament
absolutely free to deal with this matter. When dealing
with the per capita payments for the ten-years’ period,
references were made by members of the Common-
wealth Parliament of every shade of political opinion
to the effect that, if war developed, it would be com-
petent for the Federal authority to immediately cease


those payments or to alter the agreement it was then
making in regard to this matter.
During that debate the question of the Common-
wealth entering the field of direct taxation was raised.
Mr. Wilks, who was a member for one of the Sydney
constituencies, remarked that if the Commonwealth
invaded the field of direct taxation it would practically
amount to the withdrawal of the per capita payments
from the States. It is that position which we desire
to see corrected.
-Mr. McKell has stated that If the-arrangement sub-
mitted by the Commonwealth Government were con-
summated, it would necessitate the Government of
New South Wales raising 70 per cent, of its revenue
from income tax. I wish to put to Mr. McKell that
that is exactly what is being done at the present time.
Although it is true that there are not two tax collec-
tors operating, because the State Government is kindly
doing the work for the Commonwealth, there are two
Parliaments separately enacting taxation laws, and
issuing different rates of assessment, thus causing a
great deal of confusion and annoyance to taxpayers.
But from the people of New South Wales, Victoria,
or any other State, there is collected every year prac-
tically the amount of the per capita payments, and it
is that system which we say it is most foolish and
stupid to continue. I do not think I can adopt the
suggestion of Mr. Lyons to ask the people to express
an opinion on our proposals. They have expressed
their opinion many times. They think it is a ridicu-
lous system to continue.
Mr. LYONS.—Why not let them hear the other
side ?
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—Here is the position; Mr.
Hughes in 1919, Sir Joseph Cook in 1920, Mr. Watt
iu the same year, and Mr. Bruce in 1923, all pul
forward this proposition. It is not a proposal which
has been sprung upon the people of Australia, and I
venture to say that outside of a limited few, and those
mostly associated with the task of receiving this money
for their own purposes, there is not any deep-rooted
feeling against this sensible solution of the difficulties
with which we are faced at the present time. The
position is that if a man gets an income of £2,000 per
annum ho pays iu Now South Wales £B2 10s. to the
State Government and £lO5 to the Commonwealth Go-
vernment through the one collecting officer, and yet
it is suggested that some insuperable difficulty will
arise over (he collection of this money by the one
set of officers for the one Government. But surely, with
one set of officers, tho work can bo done on one set of
assessment forms.
Mr. GUNN.—It sounds easy.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—II ow can it load to hardship
when there is tho same sot of taxpayers and exactly
the same amount of money is collected? Nobody
would suggest that the incidence of taxation would he
exactly the same as at present except by superimposing
Commonwealth laws on State provisions.
Mr. McKell said that he thinks the present New
South Wales system of imposing a heavy company tax
and not following up dividends is equitable and just,
and should be continued. If the people of New South
Wales so desire, they can carry on the good work
right through and thus obtain the extra amount needed.
Mr. MeKELL. —That will prevent us collecting
something which you are collecting now.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—It will not alter tho position
at all, because you can adopt the Commonwealth laws
in part or in toto.
Mr. MeKELL.—We will bo careful about doing
anything like that; that is why you want to get the
proposals adopted.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—There is no doubt that the
question of aggregation will arise, but I do not think
it can be maintained that the sovereign States cannot do
anything they like. There is no reason why they
should not aggregate if they wish to do so. The Com-
monwealth Government says to the States “We will
overcome all your difficulties under aggregation by the,
provisions we make for the collecting of the war loan
interest.” If the war loan interest is to be collected
by the Commonwealth—and the Commonwealth de-
sires to collect it because it is the policy not to issue
tax-free loans —the Commonwealth will require that
there shall be returned in a separate column the total
amount of income earned in Australia, so that the
amount of war loan interest may be assessed at the
same rate as at the present time.
Mr. MoKELL.—That may result in a higher rate.
The State will have already collected -the ordinary tax,
whilst it will have to pay the war loan interest at a
higher rate.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—What we suggest to the States
is that they should do this work because their money
is involved. The fact that we are providing this
machinery for the collection of war loan interest makes
aggregation on the part of the States the simplest
matter in the world. We have all the information
necessary in regard to the taxation they wish to return,
and if they desire they can do the work themselves.
Mr. McKell suggests that aggregation is immoral, but
some States are doing it in some respects at the present
time in connexion with estate and probate duties. If
one State says the practice is immoral, then that State
must so arrange the incidence of taxation as to get
from the taxpayers the amount lost by aggregation.
Rut there is no fundamental objection to the arrange-
ment; in fact, we provide the machinery for you to
get the amount that you are raising at the present
time.
Sir ALEXANDER PEACOCK.—In the report of
the Royal Commission upon Taxation, at page 77, the
following paragraph appears—
“ The majority of witnesses agreed that the levying of income
tax would be more appropriate to the Commonwealth than to
the States, and in this view your commissioners concur.”
Dr. EARLE PAGE. —I understood that three years
ago, not only did you oppose that proposal, but such a
position has never been put up by the States, because
they would he very foolish to lose what is the most
elastic and adaptable form of taxation that they can
handle. The proof of that is the manner in which
the Commonwealth Government raises its taxation. It
has been said “ it is a marvellous thing to see Customs
taxation grow £10,000,000 in six years”; but the
Commonwealth revenue increased by £17,000,000 or
£18,000,000 during the four years in which the Com-
monwealth thought it necessary to impose the form of
taxation which can be most readily exploited, and which
is now being given back to the States. If it is found
impossible for the States to actually bring to account
every penny that we are collecting at the present time,
they can remember that this taxation field is the one
that we have ploughed and reaped to a very much
greater degree than it is necessary for them to do, and
it will be a very easy matter indeed to arrange the inci-
dence of taxation so that it will be just and equitable.
Mr. McCORMACK. —All these facts existed at the
end of the “Rraddon blot”?
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—No; because at that time wc
were not paying more than three-fourths of our total
Customs revenue for war interest.
Mr. McCORMACK.—Then why did you continue
the per capita payments?
111 - . EARLE PAGE.—I am glad that Mr. McCor-
mack lias raised that question, because it enables me to
compare the two positions—then and to-day—and to
compare the generous attitude of the Federal Govern-
ment now with the attitude then adopted. At that
time the Commonwealth found itself in the very happy
position of being able to keep back from the States
£8,500,000, being three-fourths of the Customs revenue,
and to substitute the 255. par capita payments. The


result was that, in the first year, there was a drop
of about £3,000,000 in the payments to the
States. There was plenty of money available at
that time for the Commonwealth. It had no debts,
except in regard to the transferred properties,
upon which it started to pay interest for the first
time. The experience of the Commonwealth Govern-
ment in this regard is one worth putting on record,
because it has never failed where possible to give relief.
Three years ago we put up the proposition that was
accepted by five of the States.
Sir ALEXANDER PEACOCK.—In the pro-
posals you then made you abandoned all direct taxa-
tion.
Dr. EARLE PAGE. —No. We only abandoned the
taxation of individuals. The suggestion was then
made by the State Premiers that this was a very good
line of demarcation. When the Prime Alinister men-
tioned that fact there was cordial agreement on all
sides.
Air. AIcKELL.—Whore is that Prime Alinister
now ?
Dr. EARLE PAGE. —He is here now. In 1910, de-
spite tho fact that there was this big surplus of revenue,
and a difference of £3,000,000 between the two-year pay-
ments to the States, the Government put on a laud
tax of £1,400,000, which curtailed the taxation field
of the States. But now the Commonwealth, despite
its huge commitments, says that it is prepared to leave
this field of direct taxation. If there is an occasional
surplus, it will be used in the same way as in the
past, to provide for defence expenditure without extra
taxation, or to pay off tho war debt, which must be
directly beneficial to every State in the Common-
wealth. I now wish to refer particularly to the case
of Tasmania. I do not appreciate the argument used
by Air. Lyons, because, of all the States, it seems to
me that Tasmania has come off rvorst under the per
capita system. That system was based on the idea that
there would be a continuous improvement in the
position and the population of each State. Tasmania
used to get nearly 5 per cent, of the taxation returned
under the 1910 per capita payments, but to-day actually
receives scarcely 3 per cent, of the total amount paid by
the Commonwealth, and, therefore, has had to come to
the Commonwealth, not for assistance on the Federal
basis, but for special assistance, because the Federal basis
does not favour an undeveloped State like Western
Australia, or a State which has suffered economic
loss, like Tasmania.
Mr. LYONS. —The per capita payments do not
account for our difficulties at present.
Dr. EARLE PAGE. —I am suggesting that it is a
bad basis for Tasmania.
Air. LYONS.—It is, unfortunately, a better arrange-
ment than the present proposal.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—No; because if you look at
these proposals you will see that the special payment to
Tasmania, in addition to any additional payment made,
will put Tasmania in the position of having a taxation
field of £IOO,OOO more than is levied at the present
time, to come and go in and make adjustments.
But even if Air. Lyons’s estimate is correct, the posi-
tion of Tasmania is quite different from that of New
South Wales. In New South Wales a return of
£IOO,OOO means something like 9d. per head, but in the
case of Tasmania, it means 10s. per head. Tasmania is
in the position of not having increased her population.
In the second year she would be £62,500 better off,
whilst the other States would be coming down to
normal. In the third year she would be £23,000 better
off.
Air. LYONS, —In the third year we should be
£300,000 down.
Dr. EARLE PAGE. —It is rather interesting to note
that every State representative at this Conference
affirms that his State does not get a fair share of the
F. 7376.—4
total taxation. Every State Premier declares that
the way in which the total taxation of the Common-
wealth is split up causes his State to be credited with
too much. If that be so, and every one gets more than
his share, it is a most extraordinary bit of mathematics.
Air, AlcKELL.—That is quite right. There is a
certain portion which the Commonwealth and the States
cannot collect.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—There is some of it that is
not collected at the present time. If every State says,
“ We are £300,000 down on the figures,” then surely
we are under a delusion in imagining that we are
collecting more than we actually do collect.
Mr. LYONS.—But you have taken the arrears and
put them into that year,
Mr. GUNN. —There is a £400,000 carry-over in our
State.
Dr. EARLE PAGE. —Wo asked the Deputy Com-
missioners for a very definite return, which was
secured from the assessments. The figures have nothing
to do with collections or arrears. That brings me to the
question which Mr. AlcKell raised. He doubts the
accuracy of the figures for New South Wales, and
says that this year the position is that they are
£300,000 down.
Mr. McCORMACK. —You are suggesting that we
arc turning down a generous offer, and that we do
not understand the proposals?
Dr. EARLE PAGE. —I think you are turning down
a generous scheme.
Air. McCORMACK. —Arc you suggesting that we
have not the intelligence to see it?
Dr. EARLE PAGE. —I do not put it that way.
Air. AlcKell has said that he doubts the accuracy of
the figures for New South Wales, because so far this
year the collections are £300,000 less than they were
last year. I remember that when those figures were
being made up we were very disturbed about the Queens-
land position. The Queensland collections seemed to be
hundreds of thousands less than they ought to be; but
we were greatly relieved to find that* her totals up to
last April brought in £187,000 in new assessments. As
showing how impossible it is to get all the assessments
during the current year —and that was the rock upon
which the Conference split years ago —we find that in
New South Wales up to December last, which repre-
sents the first six months after the close of the financial
year 1924-25, the amount of assessments equalled
£2,209,668, whereas the amount of assessments in that
State for the year 1924-25 now totalled £2,325,212, an
increase of £115,544 from December to May of this
year.
Air. EGGLESTON. —But you would not give us
that carry-over.
Dr. EARLE PAGE. —It is not a carry-over. It is
our own money. It is our own system of assessment
that I am dealing with.
Air. EGGLESTON. —But there will be practically
six months’ collections less.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—We are giving you something
like £2,000,000 in three years, which corresponds to a
great part of any carry-over there may happen to be
in the whole of the collections. I think that will in-
dicate to Air. AlcKell that the figures he has quoted
for this year are incapable of comparison in a legiti-
mate way with the figures for the previous year. That
is the position we tried to maintain at the last Confer-
ence, but when the States desired figures for the cur-
rent year wc found that as soon as it was a question of
guessing on the part of the New South Wales and Com-
monwealth officers, they were not able to guess anything
like the same amount.
Air. GUNN. —Can you tell us what advantage these
proposals will be to the Commonwealth in enabling it
to meet the obligations you speak of? Are you going
to get any more money out of it?


Dr. EARLE PAGE.—We are not going to get any
more money, but we will be able so to order our
arrangements as to be able to see exactly where we are.
Mr. GUEE.—I think you should accept the word
of the representatives of the States and examine the
position carefully, because the proposals mean such a •
serious dislocation of our finances.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—We recognize that, and in
order to obviate the trouble, we say that we will use the
whole of any surplus this year in that connexion.
Mr. GUEE.—But that involves the amount of
£200,000.
Mr. BRUCE.—That is rather getting down to the
details of the scheme. I think we should deal with
the broad principles before discussing actual details.
Mr. McCORMACK.—If the Commonwealth is
going to lose, and the States are going to gain, how
will the Commonwealth be in a better position 'i
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—We shall have to deal with
that matter in the way outlined by the Prime Minis-
ter yesterday.
Mr. GUNE.—You base your case on the obligations
of the Commonwealth. •
Mr. BRUCE. —I am the person responsible for
setting up that case. In future I shall not set up
the obligations of the Commonwealth as a reason
why this should be done, because the Commonwealth
will not be better able to meet its obligations under these
proposals. I was showing that the Commonwealth was
in the position of having no surplus revenue, but 1
was not suggesting that there was something in these
proposals which would enable us to meet our com-
mitments in the future.
Dr. EAELE PAGE.—In regard to the suggestion
made by Mr. Lyons that the Commonwealth deliberately
chose a certain period of five years because it suited its
purpose to do so, I can assure him that it was not our
intention to do anything of the kind. From our point
of view the figures would have been considerably better
if we had taken the last year mentioned, as having a
production value increase of 14 per cent. If we take
the years 1914 to *1924, we find that the rate per cent,
of annual increase in the value of production was 3.30
in 1914, 19.69 in 1915, 1.92 in 1916, 5.97 in 1917, 4.53
in 1918, 17.60 in 1919-20, 15.65 in 1920-21, 12.04 de-
crease in 1921-22, 9.88 increase in 1922-23, and 5.28 in
1923-24. If you look at the quinquennium period, you
will find that there is very little difference. I would
like to assure the visiting Premiers that the Common-
wealth has endeavoured, to put forward an absolutely
fair proposition. It is with the object of discussing the
possibilities of the proposals from every point of view
that the Prime Minister has called you together, and if
it can be shown that there is anything inequitable in the
scheme the Commonwealth Government is willing and
anxious to do everything possible to arrive at a solution
of the difficulties.
Mr. LYOES.—You have taken our population as
remaining stationary, while there is increased produc-
tion and the taxation field is expanding; then you say
that the average rate per cent, of production increase
for the quinquennium ended 1923-24 was 6.71.
Dr. EAELE PAGE.—We have got over the diffi-
culty so far as Tasmania is concerned by the additional
grant each year. If Tasmania has been credited with
too much, then all the other States, or some of the other
States, -must have been credited with too little. There-
fore, the figures would really be better than they
actually appear at the present time.
Mr. BRUCE.—It is perfectly obvious that there is a
broad principle underlying the whole question, a prin-
ciple in no way influenced by any alteration or adjust-
ment of the figures. I want to make it quite clear and
definite that there is no possible suggestion of a bargain
by the Commonwealth with the States so far as the
proposals which have been put forward are concerned.
Those proposals are based upon the view which I ex-
pressed very clearly during the last election campaign,
that it is essential that there should be a clear line of
demarcation between Commonwealth and State finances,
giving to each a very definite field in which to levy
taxation. These proposals have been framed in a spirit
of inquiry; we want to find some way by which that
demarcation can be brought about. I do not think that
anybody—ibe he State Treasurer, State Premier, or
Prime Minister of the Commonwealth—will deny
that the principle is a right one, although, of course, it
is very natural that the actual effect on one’s own posi-
tion must be regarded as having considerable influence.
It being accepted that the principle is a right and
proper one, the object is to carry it out in a manner
fair and equitable. to the States. To do that is not
likely to cause dislocation or serious embarrassment
to any of the States. The proposals have been framed
with due regard to that principle, and the object of
calling the State Premiers together is to give them an
opportunity of analysing the position from every angle.
I think it will be admitted that the discussion which we
have had has been extraordinarily useful. But a point
of view has been put forward which appears to me to
be of fundamental importance, and if it be consistently
maintained, the Commonwealth will have to say, “ It
would not be the right or proper thing for us to take
the course we contemplate; therefore, there is no neces-
sity to discuss or consider the proposals any further, or
to inquire how the figures affect the posi-
tion.” The fundamental point which has been
raised is in regard to the rights of the States under the
terms of the Federation. I think you will all agree
that is the principle that has been the real subject of
discussion this afternoon. I have listened carefully to
all that has been said, and I cannot accept the view
which has been put forward that there is a right, either
legal or moral, in the States to continue to enjoy the
per capita payments, or, as it has been put in another
way, for the States to receive some part of the Customs
revenue. I stress the fact that the point is a vital and
fundamental one, because we certainly cannot allow in
this country any departure from a moral obligation
upon the Commonwealth in connexion with the position
of the States. I do not think anybody has seriously
contended that there is a statutory or legal right in the
States to receive this amount, but the contention has
been based purely upon the moral right. It has been
argued that Federation would never have come about if
the States had not been assured that they would receive
for all time part of the Customs revenue. One can
quite imagine that being to some extent the
state of the atmosphere at the time when
the question of Federation was being decided.
The States could quite reasonably say, “We have
a source of revenue which we are going to give up to
the Commonwealth, and therefore we want to know
what is going to happen to us in the future.” After
a good deal of negotiation, various arrangements were
come to which have been given effect to for some years.
But I want you to realize that the fact that the Com-
monwealth might go to war was visualized at the time
of Federation, and various provisions were made so that
it would be able to meet the resultant obligations. It
was perfectly clear that the Commonwealth should
take over the task of defending Australia, and
the situation in which the Commonwealth would
then find itself was clearly visualized. Let us
assume that, as a matter of fact, the war situa-
tion had been created before Federation actually came
about. An analogy can be drawn in that connexion
with the position of the American Colonies, now form-
ing the United States of America. They passed
through a great war, each of the States playing its
part. As a result, there was an obligation upon the
States to meet the commitments arising out of the
war. I want to make it clear that the basis of Federa-
tion would have remained the same; the war obligations
would have been taken over, and the field of taxation


and the sources of revenue open to the Commonwealth
utilized for the purpose of meeting those obligations.
It is apparent that the prospect of war was visualized
and the way left open for the Commonwealth to assume
the burden, and raise the necessary revenue. War did
come, and, as a result, the Commonwealth was required
to take over a burden which, at the present time,
amounts to about £28,500,000. It must be admitted
that even the people who, at the time of Federation,
were apprehensive in regard to the Commonwealth
encroaching upon the revenue-raising activities of the
States, would have recognized that, if the Common-
wealth took over the obligations of the States, it should
be free from the necessity for making payments to the
States. That was the whole basis of Federation, and
the Commonwealth obligations have actually material-
ized from the cause that was visualized, namely, war,
the Customs revenue being absorbed in meeting those
obligations.
Mr. GUNN.—These proposals will not help you to
meet the obligations to any great extent.
Mr. BRUCE. —Certainly not.
Mr. GUNN. —Therefore that reason cannot be said
to be a good one.
Mr. BRUCE. —At the present time, I am only deal-
ing with the question of whether there is a moral right
in the States to receive these per capita payments, and
I am merely pointing out that the obligations assumed
by the Commonwealth more than absorb the source of
revenue that was made available to the Commonwealth,
namely, Customs and excise, without the Common-
wealth being required in any way to pay anything to
the States. At the present time the Commonwealth
liabilities include about £28,500,000 on account of war,
about £5,000,000 for defence, and about £9,000,000 for
old-age and invalid pensions; we do not require to go
any further to reach the £40,000,000 which is the
maximum amount suggested for the present or the near
future. The position to-day in regard to the moral right
of the States to a part of the Customs revenue is just
the same as it was in 1910, when everybody must have
been very clear in regard to the question. That period
was nearer to the time of Federation than the present
day, yet the payments to the States were reduced by
£3,000,000, the reason put forward by the Government
being that obligations were being taken over which
were part of the functions of the Commonwealth. I
venture to say that the point that there is a moral right
in the States to receive the per capita payments, •or
part of the revenue derived from Customs and excise,
cannot be sustained, and certainly is not borne out
by the arguments which have been put forward during
this Conference. The existence of this moral right has
been argued as constituting the basis of the case
of the States, and it certainly is a preliminary
basis which should be dealt with, one way or
the other, before there is any definite discussion
of facts and figures. I therefore think that
the wisest course to adopt would be for the Con-
ference to adjourn, in order to allow the State Premiers
to confer and decide whether they base their opposition
to the Commonwealth proposals upon the ground that
a moral right exists in the States to receive the per
capita payments. The question must be dealt with as
forming a direct issue between the Commonwealth and
the States, and must be decided before the proposals
can be further discussed. It is quite possible that
many important factors bearing upon the problem have
been overlooked; certainly it would be undesirable in
the limited time at our disposal this evening to attempt
to clear the matter up; therefore, an adjournment
would give us an opportunity of considering it from
every angle. The position now is, as I understand it,
that the Commonwealth has submitted certain pro-
posals to the States, and the States take the preliminary
objection that those proposals constitute an infringe-
ment of a moral right in the States under the Federa-
tion. The Commonwealth is told, in effect, “ You
are going back on the whole of the principles under-
lying the Federation.” If that be the ground upon
which the States intend to stand, they must accept full
responsibility. I say that such a position cannot be
maintained; still, the challenge to the Commonwealth
Government must be accepted, and a decision come to
one way or the other.
Mr. EGGLESTON. —We do not admit that there is
any inherent soundness in the definite separation of the
spheres of taxation.
Mr. BRUCE. —That point can be discussed after it
has been decided whether a moral right does exist.
We can then consider whether the Commonwealth
proposals, as submitted to the States, are along proper
lines, or whether there should be an alteration in cer-
tain directions.
Mr. EGGLESTON. —It is not really a question of
principle, but of the inherent soundness of the proposi-
tion.
Mr. BRUCE. —Quite so, but the problem we are
faced with now, and which must be dealt with at once,
is that the Commonwealth is told quite frankly by all
the States, “ You are betraying a moral right that we
enjoy.”
Mr. EGGLESTON. —I think it can be argued that
a good deal depends upon the needs of the Common-
wealth and the needs of the States.
Mr. BRUCE.—The question now is whether there is
a moral right.
Mr. EGGLESTON.—-The point at issue is not
merely as to whether one source of revenue returns so
much to the States, and another source of revenue
returns so much to the Commonwealth, but whether
the revenue so obtained is sufficient. I do not see that
there can be any objection to the proposals being con-
sidered along those lines. The real problem is whether
the States are entitled to a share of the Customs
revenue.
Mr. BRUCE. —I quite agree that it may be so, but
is not exactly the ease that has been put.
Mr. EGGLESTON. —That point was taken by Mr.
McCormack.
Mr. BRUCE.—I suggest that we adjourn now un-
til to-morrow morning, so that we will be able to think
the matter over during the night.
Mr. McCORMACK. —The trouble is that the Com-
monwealth takes up a very definite attitude in the memo-
randum, which says. “ The Commonwealth Govern-
ment has now determined, because of these consider-
ations, to discontinue the capitation payments, and to
adjust its financial relationships with the States on the
following basis.”
Mr. BRUCE. —We also say that we want to meet the
States and discuss the matter with them.
Mr. McCORMACK. —But if you are determined to
do this thing, where is the need for a conference? If
you intend to do it, and you are in the right, nothing
that the States can do will alter that intention, and
rightly so. If you are right, and the per capita pay-
ments are discontinued, the States will bo in no worse
position than if the Conference had not been held.
The Commonwealth cannot go on collecting direct
taxation in addition to withdrawing from the per
capita payments. The people would not allow that to
be done, and it is not suggested.
Mr. BRUCE. —You say that we have already deter-
mined to do this thing.
Mr. McCORMACK. —Yes, your memorandum
definitely states “ The Commonwealth Government
has now determined.”
Mr. BRUCE. —Let us- take the paragraph to which
Mr. McCormack has referred, ignoring the later para-
graph in which we say that we want to discuss the


question with the Premiers. Suppose that I deter-
mined to do a thing, and it was then put to me that it
would be morally wrong —a point which I had over-
looked—l would be perfectly prepared to retrace my
steps. The contention put forward on behalf of the
States has been that the Commonwealth contemplates
an action that is morally wrong. I submit that the
contention cannot, and has not, been sustained. Still,
I want to know definitely if the States base their case
upon the point that the Commomvealth propose to do
something that it has no power to do, and to disregard
a moral obligation of the Federation.
Mr. McCORMACK. —Nobody questions the power
of the Commonwealth, but we do question the moral
right.
Mr. BRUCE.—Quite so, but the point is that we
may be restrained from doing an act if it is immoral.
Restraints of that kind have an influence upon some
people.
Mr. McCORMACK. —1 do not question the morality
of the present Commonwealth Government in the
matter. The proposals may appear quite sound to
the Government of -which the Prime Minister is the
head, but from the point of view of the States, they
constitute a breach of a moral understanding or con-
tract entered into at the time of Federation. The
question is -whether the people of Australia at the
present time consider that there is a moral obliga-
tion upon the Commonwealth Government to hand
over portion of the Customs revenue to the States.
Mi - . BRUCE.—That is the very point I have been
trying to make. The Commonwealth has put for-
ward certain proposals, and listening to the speeches
made by the Premiers this afternoon I have gathered
that the Commonwealth action is being challenged on
the ground that something is being done -which is
morally wrong, and opposed to the right of the States
under the Federation.
Mr. McCORMACK. —"We believe that, under the
general terms of the Constitution, the States have a
right to participate in the Customs revenue. If the
Commonwealth considers that its proposals are sound,
what has prevented it from going on with those pro-
posals? There must be some very good and sufficient
reason for the indecision.
Mr. BRUCE. —The Commonwealth has had every
reason for going on with the proposals.
Mr. McCORMACK.—There must be some reason for
the hesitation.
Mr. BRUCE.—There is ample justification for the
Commonwealth attitude in the action taken in 1910.
Mr. McCORMACK.—This question has been raised
at previous Conferences, but something has prevented
the Commonwealth from going on with the proposals;
probably doubt as to the moral right.
Mr. BRUCE. —I do not think that has been the
reason.
Mr. McCORMACK. —At previous Conferences the
Commouwealth has been emphatic about its right to
withdraw the per capita payments, but it has hesitated
to take action in that direction for some good and
sufficient reason. We want to know what reason. We
believe it is because there is something in the general
terms of the Constitution giving the people of the States
the right to participate in the Customs revenue.
Mr. BRUCE.—Yo. The point taken now as to the
moral right has never been taken before.
Mr. McCOßMACK.—Perhaps not quite as openly,
but the difficulty has been raised.
Mr. BRUCE.—Yo. That is not what caused the
delay in 1923; the arrangements broke down then owing
to the fact that the necessary statistics could not be
obtained for three months. If the States stand on the
definite ground that they enjoy a moral right under
the Federation, then we know exactly where we are.
But, until that point is settled, it is not much use
arguing about the wisdom or justice of the proposals.
Mr. McCORMACK. —The point is that if you be-
lieve the Commonwealth attitude to be correct, what
stand can you take other than the one you have already
taken?
Mr. BRUCE.—We must, first of all, decide whether
what is proposed is morally wrong or not.
Mr. McKELL.—But if the Commonwealth right does
exist in regard to withdrawing the per capita payments,
what else is there to say; surely you are quite justified
in taking up your present attitude.
Mr. BRUCE.—Undoubtedly.
Mr. GUYY. —Even the existence of that right on the
part of the Commonwealth should not preclude the
States from stressing the difficulties that it will cause
and their view of the injustice of it. But the morality
of the whole thing is our first line of defence.
Mr. BRUCE. —Yes, and the States are basing their
case upon the morality of the scheme.
Mr. ALLEY.—The States also take up the attitude
that you have not justified the necessity for any depar-
ture from existing methods.
Mr. GUYY.: —The Prime Minister has stated that
the scheme will he of no advantage to the Common-
wealth, although it will cause a serious dislocation of
the finances of the States.
Mr. BRUCE.—We have not really threshed out the
question of the situation in which the States will find
themselves, or any of the other points.
Mr. GUYY. —But you have admitted that there will
be no gain to the Commonwealth.
Mr. BRUCE. —The Commonwealth is not looking
for advantage.
Mr. GUYY. —The point is whether there should be
a clear line of demarcation between the Commouwealth
and the States.
Mr. BRUCE. —Yes, and I go so far as to say that
for the purposes of good government it is essential.
Sir ALEXANDER PEACOCK.—After all, we'
represent the same people, and they cannot be
expected to worry about these fine points.
Mr. BRUCE.—We have to settle now whether a
moral right in the States does exist.
Mr. McCORMACK.—If the Commonwealth conten-
tion is right and just, how can you compromise with
the States? If the carrying out of your proposals will
be in the direction of good government, you cannot
compromise with us and do something that is wrong.
You cannot trifle with your conscience and give to the
States something that they should not get.
Mr. BRUCE.—I am not going to compromise or
trifle with my conscience. We say that the Common-
wealth has botli, a legal and a moral right to carry out
these proposals. But, of course, there may be certain
facts which wore not taken into consideration when the
proposals were framed, and, therefore, this Conference
has been held to consider the matter from every angle.
.We are perfectly prepared to discuss the figures con-
tained in the Commonwealth memorandum, as well as
their basis, together with the question of whether they
will in fact work equitably or inequitably so far as the
States are concerned.
The Conference adjourned at p.m.


THIRD DAY.—WEDNESDAY, 26th MAY, 1926.
FINANCIAL RELATIONS BETWEEN STATES
AND COMMONWEALTH,
Mr. BRUCE. —When the Conference adjourned last
evening, the representatives of the States had all put
their points of view with regard to the Commonwealth
proposals, and I had dealt with the main issue which
had been raised by them, namely, that there is a moral
right on the part of the States to some portion of the
Customs and excise revenue which is collected by the
Commonwealth. As I remarked upon first hearing the
case thus presented by the States, the Commonwealth
could not possibly accept that point of view, and cer-
tainly could not agree that there is cither a constitu-
tional, legal, or moral right on the part of the States
to receive anything from the Customs collections. But
I indicated that it would perhaps be wise for us to
think over the matter during the night. The Com-
monwealth Government has thought it over, and it is
quite clear that it cannot possibly accept the point of
view to which I have referred, namely, that there is
any moral right on the part of the States to share in
that revenue, or that any arrangement was arrived at
when the Federation was established, under which,
irrespective of anything which might happen in the
future, and in total disregard of any expenditure which
the Commonwealth might be called upon to shoulder,
the States have an inalienable right to some portion of
the Customs revenue. ft is quite definite upon that
point. That was the only point with which I dealt
last evening, although there are one or two other mat-
ters upon which I now desire to touch briefly. They
arc matters arising out of the discussion which took
place yesterday. One point raised by various speaker?
was, “ Why does the Commonwealth wish to do' this
thing; why not leave matters exactly as they are?” It
was said that the Commonwealth is not endeavouring
to advantage itself by the adoption of these proposals,
and that they have been brought forward only for the
purpose of giving effect to some abstract principle.
Mr. Gunn put that view fairly strongly. He said that
what was involved was merely an abstract principle
with which the Commonwealth Government appeared
to be obsessed, and because of that obsession it was
resolved to do something to which the States had ex-
pressed their keen dislike. I wish to clear up that
point. There is certainly no unreasoning desire on
the part of the Commonwealth to take the actioti
outlined in my memorandum, and to base that action
upon no practical grounds. The first ground, of course,
is that to which I referred in my opening address, when
I pointed out the great necessity which exists for a
clear line of demarcation between the taxation spheres
of the States and the Commonwealth; and when 1
urged that both authorities should be charged with the
responsibility of raising the revenues which they re-
quire in the spheres of taxation which are legitimately
open to them. I also stressed the fact that it is im-
perative that we should get rid of the farcical position
which exists at the present time. In this connexion, f
would remind the State Premiers that the Common-
wealth to-day is levying direct taxation in a sphere
which legitimately belongs to the States. But in order
to avoid unnecessary duplication and expenditure, the
States have been appointed agents for the Common-
wealth in the collection of that revenue. What really
happens? The .State officers proceed to collect the
money upon the basis of Commonwealth law, the money
passes into the Commonwealth Treasury, and is then
solemnly paid out to the different States. That is a
position which obviously it is desirable to end. It has
been suggested that I am endeavouring to bring about
the strangulation of. State finances with a view to
unification. Mr. McCormack said that I was sur-
rounded by unificationists. I have been looking for
them since, and perhaps he will be good enough to tell
me who they are. My reason for desiring to give effect
to the Commonwealth proposals is the very reverse of
that which has been suggested. It would be quite
wrong for unification to be brought about by the
strangulation of the finances of the States. If unifica-
tion is to come at all, it should come in the open day-
light, and should be the result of the decision of the
people of this Commonwealth. But the Commomvealth
Government sees very grave dangers to the States of
something of that kind being brought about. Let me
remind my hearers of what is the present position of
the States. They are receiving from the Common-
wealth per capita payments year by year. There is
not the slightest guarantee to them from one year to
another that they will receive those payments. Whether
they continue to receive them, is entirely subject to the
will of the Commonwealth Parliament, and the present
system may be altered at any time. The States have,
therefore, absolutely no safeguard upon the basis of
constitutional and legal rights, nor have they any claim
to a continuance of the per capita payments upon a
moral ground. Yesterday, the Commonwealth Govern-
ment made it perfectly clear that it could not accept
the view that they have any moral right whatever.
There can be no political party in power in the Com-
monwealth which can subscribe to that view. Thus
the States have no safeguard in connexion with the
payments which they are at present receiving from the
Customs revenue. There is a very grave danger that
in the future they may find themselves suddenly de-
prived of those payments without the compensating
advantage which would be conferred by the evacuation
by the Commonwealth of the field of direct income
taxation—without, in fact, any compensation what-
ever. That is what happened to the States upon a
former occasion—l refer to 1910, when the amount
paid to them per capita was reduced by £3,000,000, and
when, concurrently, there was an invasion of the direct
field of taxation by the levying of a Commonwealth
land tax to the extent of £1,400,000. I invite the re-
presentatives of the States to study a debate which
took place in this Parliament within the past two years.
When the 1924 Budget was under consideration, it was
put forward quite definitely by the Deputy Leader
of the Opposition in the House of Representatives, that
it was wrong for the Commonwealth to raise all the
revenue it derives from the Customs, and that, instead
of collecting two-thirds of its total revenue from this
source, and one-third from taxation, the position should
be reversed. He argued that it should collect only
one-third of its total revenue from the Customs and the
remaining two-thirds from direct taxation. What
would the States do if that course were followed?
I would further remind those present that every three
years a Commonwealth election takes place. At that
election, the different political parties go to the country
and put forward schemes to which they say effect will be
given if they are returned to power. Many schemes have
been put before the electors, the carrying out of which
would involve a tremendous expenditure by the Com-
monwealth. It has so happened that the party advo-
cating these schemes —which involve an expenditure, not
of £1,000,000 or £2,000,000, but of from £10,000,000
to £20,000,000 —has not been returned to power. But
if the political party which sponsored them were
triumphant at the polls, obviously it would have to
raise the money with which to give effect to them. So
long as per capita payments are made to the States—
payments which may be cut off at any time —the States
must recognize that when any political party is re-
turned to power in the Commonwealth Parliament, it


will have to raise the money required to carry out its
programme, and that money will have to be collected
from the people by taxation. It is the same people
who are taxed both by the Commonwealth and by the
States. The Commonwealth Government is not going
to increase indirect taxation—which is the primary
field open to it —in order to find the money necessary
to give effect to its programme; and it will not increase
its direct taxation, because that would be a further
invasion of the States’ field. Obviously, the proper
course to adopt is to cease the per capita payments,
and to allow the States to function in their own legiti-
mate sphere. I ask the States’ representatives to
seriously consider what would be their position in the
circumstances which I have just outlined. They would
not then be asked to make a slight financial adjust-
ment; they would not have the offer of a payment of
£2,000,000 during the next three years to help them
over any embarrassment suffered as the result of that
adjustment; but they would be under an absolute obli-
gation to raise in the taxation field, which has already
been fairly fully exploited, some £7,000,000 or
£8,000,000 to cover the -per capita payments
which they would be losing. I put this
point very strongly to the States, because it
has been suggested that the Commonwealth,
in the proposals which it has put forward, is endeavour-
ing to do something inimical to their interests. I abso-
lutely repudiate any such suggestion. We are not
attempting to bring about unification indirectly; but
we are endeavouring to place the States in a more
secure position financially in order that they may have
open to them the field of taxation which the framers
of our Constitution contemplated they should control
The State Treasurers may say, “ That is all very well,
but you are now putting upon us the unpleasant task
of raising revenue by taxation, which hitherto has
been undertaken by the Commonwealth.’ I have a
good deal of sympathy with them, and I think that
that consideration lies at the very root of their objec-
tion to the Commonwealth proposals. What is in-
volved is really a question for the State Governments
rather than for the States themselves. It has been
urged that, under the Commonwealth scheme, more
money will be taken out of the pockets of the taxpayers.
As a matter of fact, less money will be taken from
them, unless the States deliberately raise more money
than the Commonwealth has been collecting. Under
the proposals which the Commonwealth Government
has put forward, the State Treasurers will be faced
with the necessity of raising revenue for themselves. I
agree with them that that is a task which no Treasurer
cares to undertake if he can possibly avoid it.
But it is very essential that the State Treasurers
should think hard before rejecting these proposals.
That the objection of the States to the proposals put
forward is based, to some extent, upon a dislike to levy-
ing taxation, was made quite clear yesterday by differ-
ent speakers. Mr. McKell said that the proposals
would make the States the “Aunt Sally ” of the tax-
payers. That is possibly true; but, unfortunately, it
is necessary that the States should be in a position to
raise their own revenue. Mr. Allan said that the people
feel and resent direct taxation. These statements in-
dicate the views that, not unnaturally, the State Trea-
surers hold. Mr. McCormack said the Commonwealth
was seeking to avoid direct taxation for political pur-
poses.
Mr. McCORMACK.—I said what you are saying
now, only I applied it to you.
Mr. BRUCE.—Mr. McCormack qualified his state-
ment by saying that he did not like to suggest that the
Commonwealth Government was anxious to avoid direct
income taxation for political reasons; but he put his
point just as effectively by turning it round, as he would
have put it by stating it directly. Sir Alexander Pea-
cock, the State Treasurer of Victoria, said that this type
of taxation would make the States “ damned un-
popular.” It is perfectly clear that that is a reason
which must weigh very greatly with the State Trea-
surers. It would not be quite human if it did not influ-
ence them materially. But I am afraid we cannot
determine questions of this sort by studying the feel-
ings of the State Treasurers who have to raise taxation
for their own requirements.
I have already said that, under the Commonwealth
proposals, no more money will be taken out of the tax-
payers’ pockets than is at present extracted from them.
I want to make that point very clear and definite, be-
cause a suggestion was made yesterday that if this
scheme were put through, the taxpayers would have to
pay more. At the present time, we are making per
capita payments to the States. Under the contem-
plated arrangement, all that would be done would be
to substitute for those per capita payments, direct taxa-
tion by the States, with a considerable payment by
the Commonwealth, necessitating, during the first year
that the scheme operated, the raising of £700,000 less.
The question of the manner in which the States will
raise their taxation cannot alter the fact that not one
penny more will need to be raised. But, as a matter
of fact, less money will have to be raised. Hone of
the arguments about the aggregation of incomes or
companies’ taxation, or anything else, can affect that
fact, which is absolutely unassailable.
Mr. GUHH. —We do not think your estimates will
be realized, even if effect be given to the Common-
wealth proposals.
Mr. BRUCE. —That does not affect the question.
Mr. GUHH. —The scheme is based upon it.
Mr. BRUCE..—Ho; because the per capita payments
are made out of the taxation of the people.
Mr. GUHH. —In the case of South Australia, you
selected a State which had a £400,000 carry over from
the previous year.
Mr. BRUCE.—Hone of these things can affect the
position. We are paying to the States in the per cajnta
grants £7,500,000 annually out of taxation raised from
the people of Australia. Under the Commonwealth
proposals, it will not be necessary to raise more.
Mr. LYOHS.—It may be necessary in the case of
individual States.
Mr. BRUCE. —I will deal with that point in a
moment. The total per capita payments will be
replaced by the States collecting taxation equivalent to
the amount which they are at present receiving. To-
day, that sum is being collected by the Commonwealth.
In future, it is suggested that it shall be collected by
the States. There cannot be any increased amount
taken from the taxpayers. It must be the same amount,
or a less amount—and I suggest that it must be a less
amount, unless the States put themselves in a better
position than they occupy under the per capita pay-
ment system, because the Commonwealth, out of its
surplus for the present year, has agreed to find moneys
which will eliminate the necessity for part of this
taxation being imposed by the States. I think we
should get that point very clearly fixed in our minds.
I agree that it may, as Mr. Lyons has suggested,
affect individual States; but, provided that all the
methods which the Commonwealth has adopted can be
employed by the States to collect taxation if they so
desire, the total amount that will be realized must be
just as great as that which the Commonwealth has
received.
The question of the aggregation of incomes was dis-
cussed yesterday, and Mr. McKell went so far as to
say that the States would be doing something improper
if they aggregated their income tax, and that they have
not the power to aggregate.
Mr. McKELL.—It is questionable.


Mr. BRUCE. —As to their legal power to aggregate,
I do not wish to appear to be taking up a didactic
attitude; but it cannot be open to question that a
State has power to levy taxation upon its people in
any way that it may deem fit. There is nothing to
prevent it.
Mr. McCORMACK.—Do you suggest that we should
adopt that course?
Mr. BRUCE.—I am not offering any suggestion to
the States.
Mr. McCORMACK.—But you say that we can do
it, in order'to meet the objection which has been raised
to the Commonwealth scheme; so you must be suggest-
ing that we should do it.
Mr. BRUCE.—Mo. It would not be proper for me
to suggest how it should be done. It is for the States
to determine what is the basis upon which they can
most equitably tax their own people in order to raise
the revenue they require. The Commonwealth has done
it by one method.
Mr. McCORMACK.—Your proposals may compel
us to do a wrong.
Mr. BRUCE.—There is no necessity to do a wrong
It is for the States to determine what course they will
pursue. The Commonwealth has levied taxation oil the
aggregate income of the individual; there is no question
of right or wrong involved; it is simply a question of
whether the States think that is the most equitable way
of raising the revenue they require.
In regard to company taxation, Mr. McKell pointed
out that in Mew South Wales there was a flat rate of
2s. 6d. in the £l. He said: “You adopt another system
—that of taxing the individual on his dividends. We
do not do that.” But surely that is a matter for the
determination of the States concerned. The Common-
wealth, rightly or wrongly, has always taken the view
that it is grossly unfair to have a taxation system under
which a flat rate of 2s. 6d. in the £1 is levied upon a
company, whilst the dividends earned by that company
are paid in some cases to persons who are not subject
to income tax and in other cases to men with very large
incomes who should pay income tax at a very much
higher rate. The Commonwealth has said that it would
not be proper to levy the same rate upon a man who is
not liable to pay any tax, as upon one who is liable pos-
sibly to a rate of ss. or 6s. in the £l. The Mew South
Wales representatives say: “We do not levy taxation
in that way, and if we did we would not get the same
return as the Commonwealth is getting in that field.”
Surely the answer to that contention must be that it is
a matter for the State Government to determine whether
it will adopt such a system or not.
Mr. McKELL. —Dr. Earle Page will not suggest that
we should adopt that method, after his experience.
Mr. BRUCE.—That is a question of equity as
against the ease of collecting taxation, which must be
determined by the State itself. But that is not a reason
why the State cannot raise the same amount from the
same field, as the Commonwealth raised. Doubt has
been expressed as to whether it will be possible for the
States to obtain from this particular source a revenue
equal to that which the Commonwealth has been re-
ceiving. With regard to war loans and other loans
which have been issued by the Commonwealth, and
which the States cannot tax, the Commonwealth has
said quite definitely that it is prepared to tax those
loans and pay over the proceeds to the States.
It has been suggested that some States will be dis-
advantaged by the scheme that we have put forward.
Yesterday, figures were quoted to show that the various
States would get a very much less revenue out of the
Commonwealth scheme than they received from the per
capita payments. Obviously, that cannot apply to every
State. I agree that a case may be made out for some
of the States, but if one State receives less than it is
receiving now, some other State must get more. That,
surely, is a matter for adjustment by the States. We
have tried to solve this problem upon what we con-
ceive to be the most equitable basis. For example, in
regard to central office collections, we have taken as
probably the fairest basis, the population of the differ-
ent States. Mr. Lyons says that is a wrong basis.
Possibly the other States think that it is. If the States
think it is fair that central office collections should be
allocated on the basis of the taxation collected in the
different States, we are perfectly prepared to consider
it and to alter the scheme to that extent. It is a ques-
tion for the States to determine which they think would
bo the more equitable method of dealing with the
matter. They are in a better position to determine
that question now, because at present the collections are
carried out by the States on our behalf.
Mr. GUMM.—Mot central office collections. We
know nothing of them.
Mr. BRUCE.—The Commonwealth can supply all
the figures you require in regard to central office
collections, if the States desire them, to enable a
determination to be arrived at in respect of what is the
fairest basis upon which to allocate them. We know
in what State the individual who makes a return is
resident, and we shall be only too pleased to assist
the States in that way. The point I am making at the
moment is that there are central office collections. In
order to arrive at a basis upon which those collections
ought to be allocated to the States, we suggest that
a population basis should be adopted. If the States
say, ‘‘Adopt some other basis,” we are perfectly pre-
pared to fall into line with them. If there be any
inequity in the basis we suggest; if, for example. Mew
South Wales will get too much and Tasmania too little,
the Commonwealth is prepared to adjust matters upon
some other basis. But that does not touch the funda-
mental idea of the transference of the collections to
the States as against a Commonwealth levy.
Most of the points that have been dealt with are
points for the consideration of the States, and this
remark applies particularly to the question of what is
the fairest basis for the allocation to the different
States of the amount which the Commonwealth is at
present collecting. The broad basis of the Common-
wealth Government’s scheme is that it has collected a
certain amount in this field. It has allocated that sum
as best it can and in the way which it thought would
bo most satisfactory to the States. If the States do not
like that basis of allocation, it is prepared to consider
any suggestion for varying it.
The only point which I think is not a matter
for the States to consider and make suggestions
upon, is the general principle that has been
laid down in the Commonwealth memorandum in
regard to the probable growth of the taxable .field
year after year, which we have calculated at 6 per cent.
But I do not know that the basis laid down can be
accepted for Tasmania, having regard to the condition
of affairs in that State. Apart from the question of
the basis upon which we should operate regarding the
annual increase in the taxable area, all the other
matters are details upon which the Commonwealth is
prepared to meet the States. We have taken as our
basis the actual assessments for the year 1924-5. At the
last Conference we attempted to go right to the end of
the financial year which had just closed, and therefore
ft was necessary to estimate the figures. Those figures
were at once challenged by the States, and as definite
statistics could not be obtained in relation to the pro-
posals; it was necessary to abandon the scheme. But
at this Conference we are not dealing with problematical
figures, but with the actual - assessments for the finan-
cial year 1924-5. We have taken as our starting point
the actual and definite assessments for the year, and
have added a certain amount to allow for the annual
increase to be expected in the taxable area. The ques-
tion as to whether the basis adopted is a fair and


reasonable one is most important, and therefore I
suggest that it should be considered by the taxing
authorities of the different States, so that they will be
able to advise their respective Premiers in regard to it,
or as to whether they can recommend a better basis.
We are prepared to meet the States in that direction,
subject to the general principle that we have left the
whole field of individual taxation to them, and will
make them a payment of £2,000,000 over a period of
three years. The outstanding noint that has been
raised, however is that there is a moral obligation upon
the Commonwealth to continue these ]>er capita pay-
ments. I say quite definitely that we cannot accept
that contention. But so far as the scheme itself is
concerned, we are quite prepared to discuss it with the
States, and to alter anything that can be shown to be
inequitable. We say that there is nothing to prevent
the States collecting the amount that the Common-
wealth has been receiving.
Mr. McKELL.—During the course of the proceedings
yesterday, each of the States’ representatives stated
that he considered that an undoubted moral right
existed on the part of the States to participate in the
Customs and excise revenue. Following the taking of
that point, you asked us to give further consideration
to it, and you suggested that we should meet and
talk it over, so that we could notify you to-day
whether we still adhered to it. Accordingly, a meeting
of the Premiers was held this morning, at which I was
present as representing the State of New South Wales,
and T have been deputed by that meeting to convey our
views to you. We consider that we have an undoubted
moral right to participate in the Customs and excise
revenue, and there are also other reasons, as outlined in
the speeches delivered yesterday, why the proposals of
the Commonwealth should not be given effect to. We
are also of the opinion that the Prime Minister has
absolutely failed to justify any departure from the
existing arrangement.
Mr. BRUCE.—Do 1 understand that the States,
having said that they do not agree with the Common-
wealth proposals, are not now prepared to discuss the
question of whether those proposals are practicable from
the point of view of the States collecting the revenue,
and of whether, if the scheme be proceeded with, there
is a better basis for an adjustment between the Com-
monwealth and the States.
Mr. McKELL.—Expressing my personal opinion, it
appears to me that the proposals are certainly not ac-
ceptable to the States, for the various reasons that have
been enumerated.
Mr. BRUCE.—I can understand that point of view,
but would it not be advisable for us to consider the
practical side of the matter ? It is quite true that
yesterday, you touched upon the problem of aggregation,
but only to a very slight extent; there has been no
serious discussion of it. Mr. McCormack put the case
for his State on the basis that there is a moral obliga-
tion on the Commonwealth to continue the payments,
but he did not deal with the other aspects.
Mr. McCORMACK.—You raised the moral obliga-
tion basis.
Mr. BRUCE.—I gathered from your remarks that
you took as your basis the existence of a moral obliga-
tion.
Mr. McCORMACK.—No; you made a moral obliga-
tion the basis of your speech.
Mr. BRUCE.—I think to some extent I did; I
made it clear that, in my view, there is no moral
obligation on the Commonwealth. But, apart from the
question of a moral obligation, there is nothing to pre-
vent the States discussing whether there is any insuper-
able difficulty in the way of carrying out the Common-
wealth proposals; surelv we can consider the details of
the scheme, and see whether they are practicable, or
can be improved.
Mr. McCORMACK.-—I kept awav from the details
of the scheme, and dealt with the basic principle under-
lying it.
Mr. BRUCE.—Quite so.,
Mr. McCORMACK.—What was the use of going
into the details of the scheme when I opposed the basic
principle of it?
Mr. BRUCE.—Surely it is necessary to consider
whether the Commonwealth is wrong in its view that
the scheme is a practical one, and that the States can
do what it suggested, namely, raise all the revenue re-
quired in the field of direct taxation. Surely we can
also consider the whole question of the basis of the
allocations suggested between the different States.
Mr. GUNN. —Where the Commonwealth has failed
is in not showing the States who is going to be advan-
taged by the proposals.
Mr. ALLAN.—Not the taxpayers of the States.
Mr. GUNN. —We have been told all about the grow-
ing expenditure of the Commonwealth, but the pro-
posals are not intended to help the Commonwealth in
that direction. We have also been told that there will
be relief from taxation; therefore it is clear that the
Commonwealth will receive no advantage. The Com-
monwealth has certainly not shown that there is any
pressing need for the scheme outlined, and there is no
getting away from the fact that it will operate very
harshly so far as the States are concerned. It can-
not be said that the separation of the finances of the
Commonwealth and the States is a vital or pressing
problem, because the Commonwealth says that when
the proposals are effective it will hand over £2,000,000
to the States. The handling of money to subsidiary
bodies has been going on for years in Australia, so
that there is nothing new in that aspect of the matter.
Mr. BRUCE.—The Commonwealth has made it quite
clear that it is not seeking an advantage at the expense
of the States. Now we are told very definitely by Mr.
Gunn that if the proposals are carried out, South Aus-
tralia will not be able to collect as much revenue as the
Commonwealth has received.
Mr. GUNN.—In 1924-5 we collected £BOO,OOO, but
the assessments were only £509,000, so far as indi-
viduals were concerned.
Mr. BRUCE. —The States do not suggest that they
are entitled to more money, but only that they should
be able to raise the same amount as at present. If you
get less than that amount, the natural inference must be
that somebody ©lse -is getting more. If now taxation is
not imposed there will be an advantage from the point
of view of some one.
Mr. GUNN.—I cannot speak for the other States,
but I know that, so far as my own State is concerned,
yoUr figures are wrong.
Mr. BRUCE.—We are bound to discuss the figures
to ascertain whether they are right or wrong, and
whether there is uniformity or inequality between the
States and the Commonwealth.
Mr. GUNN.—The point is that the States are being
asked to make a sacrifice, to give something up, and
that sacrifice will entail increased taxation. It is well
known that the States are not financing on anything
like the sound lines enjoyed by the Commonwealth.
The Customs revenue is increasing, with the result that
the Commonwealth Treasury is overflowing, but the
States are out of the picture, and they will have to
increase the burden of taxation in order to be able to
finance their legitimate functions. The Commonwealth
is finding new uses for the Customs and Excise revenue,
and therefore is anxious to take away a portion of it
that rightlv belongs to the States. If that position be
accepted, there is nothing left for the States but to in-
crease the incidence of income tax in order to carry out
the legitimate functions of government.
Mr. BRUCE.—Surely that line of argument is obvi-
ously wrong.
Mr. GUNN.—I think it is quite a probability.
Mr. BRUCE.—Let us assume that the suggested
scheme is right and proper, and that we are going to
get increased Customs revenue—in my opinion a very


doubtful supposition. Obviously, if the Commonwealth
revenue is mainained at the present figure, the Com-
monwealth will have to take a further step out of the
field of direct taxation, because we are still functioning
in regard to probate tax, income tax, land tax, and
entertainment tax. The people of the country will not
tolerate the Commonwealth Government, because it
coffers happen to bo overflowing with revenue, embark
ing upon wild schemes of expenditure. It is quite cleai
that the demand all the time is in the direction ol
reduced taxation.
Mr. GUNN. —The trouble is that you will find uses
for your revenue which will result in the operlapping
of Commonwealth and State spheres.
Mr. BRUCE.—The only direction so far referred to,
in which that is suggested, is in regard to roads.
Mr. GUNN. —What about wire netting and prospect-
ing.
Mr. BRUCE.—The national roads question was dealt
with pretty solidly at the last election.
Mr. GUNN.—No.
Mr. BRUCE.—The people throughout Australia
showed that they were in accord with the principal that
a national roads policy is essential. The Commonwealth
cannot encroach upon a State function unless there is a
demand in that direction by the people of Australia.
The making of goods roads is undoubtedly a national
question, in regard to which the Commonwealth and
the States can co-operate. We have an instance of that
fact in the United States of America,, where it has been
necessary for the Federal Government to encourage the
creation of one of the greatest assets of the country—
national highways.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—Mr. Gunn fails to realize the
difference between the Commonwealth giving money to
a State and a State giving money to a. municipality.
Municinalities are the creation of the State Government,
to which they are absolutely subsidiary. Under the
Federal system the Commonwealth and the States are
separate and -independent entities, and therefore a re-
lationship that is quite right as between a State Govern-
ment and a municipality is quite wrong as between a
State Government and the Commonwealth Government.
It is necessary that the States remain independent under
the Federal system, and to that end separation of
finances is necessary and fundamental.
Mr. GUNN. —Even we grant that municipal govern-
ment is a creation of the State, the fact remains that,
as far as possible, maintenance is provided for by taxa-
tion ; but how do you square your action in that con-
nexion with regard to Western Australia and Tas-
mania?
Mr. BRUCE.—You are now referring to the special
payments ?
Mr. GUNN .—Yes.
Mr. BRUCE. —That point is a very important one,
and must be recognized. While there is no legal, con-
stitutional, or moral obligation upon the Common-
wealth to make automatic payments to the States out
of Customs revenue, the Constitution itself provides
that in certain circumstances relief shall be given by
the Commonwealth to the States. That is the principle
that is being acted upon with regard to Western Aus-
tralia and Tasmania, and I venture to suggest that in
the interests of the general development of Australia
it is much more desirable that the Commonwealth
Government should assist States which, like Western
Australia, are in the throes of development, than to
automatically pay an increasing amount out of revenue
to States whose increasing population and develop-
ment render such a system really unnecessary.
Sir ALEXANDER PEACOCK.—Certain functions
have to be carried on by the Commonwealth Govern-
ment, and certain functions by the State Government.
Mr. BRUCE.—Yes.
Sir ALEXANDER PEACOCK.—You say that the
Federal Government should be financed by means of
indirect taxation, and the States by means of direct
taxation.
Mr. BRUCE.—Yes.
Sir ALEXANDER PEACOCK. Under such a
scheme what scope would there be for criticism of the
expenditure of the Federal Government?
Mr. BRUCE.—I think the Federal Government is
likely to be the subject of the keenest criticism, be-
cause while income tax has a certain influence upon
the cost of living, it is net to be compared with the
influence of indirect taxation. lam quite certain that
the demand will increase for a reduction in indirect
taxation, in order to bring down the cost of living and
to increase the purchasing power of wages.
Mr. McKELL.—When that state of affairs is realized
we will find the Commonwealth in the field of direct
taxation again.
Sir ALEXANDER PEACOCK.—Yes, that is the
. trouble.
Mr. BRUCE.—That is a legitimate point to raise—
that if the Commonwealth invades the field of direct
taxation the position will be difficult and embarrass-
ing for the States. But at this Conference we are en-
deavouring to establish that it is not the function of
the Commonwealth Government to operate in a field
intended to be left to the States, namely, direct taxa-
tion. If that principle is accepted the States will be
in a very much better position, because it is of the
greatest advantage, from the States point of view, for
the Commonwealth to definitely leave the field of direct
taxation.
Mr. McKELL.—The matter which is of the greatest
concern to the States is that a resolution or decision
by this Conference will not have a binding effect on
any future Commonwealth Government. There will
be no obligation, when your Government goes out of
power, for the arrangement to be continued and hon-
oured.
Mr. BRUCE.—It must not Be forgotten that this
Conference* cannot Bind future Governments to con-
tinue the per capita payments. But there is a bigger
risk of the Commonwealth coming into the field of
direct taxation if the per capita payments are con-
tinued than if those payments are discontinued. If
the proposals be adopted, there will be no danger of
the Commonwealth raising revenue by direct taxation.
Mr. McCORMACK.—We have no guarantee to that
effect.
Mr. GUNN.—I do not think any Government would
take such an extreme step as to- further invade the
field of direct taxation.
Mr. BRUCE.—Such action has already been taken.
In 1910 the Commonwealth Labour Government took
from you over £3,000,000, and invaded your field of
taxation to the extent of £1,400,000.
Mr. McKELL.—That position has been altered.
Mr. BRUCE.—What has been done can be repeated.
It is of no use to ignore that fact.
Dr. PAGE.—It has not been repaired; on the other
hand, the Government has gone further into the field.
Mr. GUNN.—I do not think that any Government
would take away the per capita payment without leav-
ing the field of direct taxation.
Mr. BRUCE.—I can only say that what I have
stated has been done.
Mr. GUNN.—I do not think a Commonwealth
Government would do that in defiance of the wishes of
the States.
Mr. BRUCE.—That would bo hamstringing the
States, whereas our intention is to leave to the States
a field which will meet all requirements.
Mr. McCORMACK.—As the States have the re-
sponsibility for the non-paying functions of govern-
ment, such as education, the upkeep of charitable
institutions, and the police force, surely all the people


should assist with the burden, as is the case under the
per capita system. jSTo' system of income tax could
possibly reach all the people.
Sir ALEXANDER PEACOCK.—Hear, hear !
Mr. BRUCE.—You could make a calculation, and
put a poll tax on the whole of the people in the State
to meet the expenditure.
Sir ALEXANDER PEACOCK.—The position is
bad enough now; it would be worse then.
Mr. GUNN.—I think you are very daring, because
you are further away than we are from the people upon
whom the taxation is imposed.
Mr. BRUCE.—Mr. McCormack says that the States
are carrying the burden of the non-productive func-
tions of government, and he refers to the police.
Possibly police administration is a non-productive
function of government, but education cannot be so
described.
Mr. McCOßMACK.—Education is not a financially
pioductive function of government.
Mr. BRUCE.—And defence is not altogether
financially productive.
Mr. McCORMACK.—The States have never ob-'
jected to the Commonwealth Government entering the
field of direct taxation in order to meet necessary
defence expenditure, but the States are now complain-
ing because you propose to leave that field of taxation,
and at the same time deprive us of payments to which
we have a moral right.
Mr. BRUCE.—There has been consistent opposition
by the people of Australia to the Commonwealth con-
tinuing in the field of direct taxation. It was always
contemplated that the States should occupy that field.
Mr. McCORMACK.—If you consult the people who
have been complaining against the Commonwealth
Government operating in that field of taxation, you
will find that they prefer the temporary taxation now
imposed to the permanent taxation which will be ren-
dered necessary if the per capita payments are with
drawn.
Mr. BRUCE.—When differing views are expressed
by the same people, the final decision must surely be
based on a principle, and the principle we are enunciat-
ing is the demarcation of the spheres of taxation.
Unfortunately, no other demarcation can be obtained,
because the Federal Government is the only one which
can levy Customs taxation.
Mr. McCORMACK.—I would oppose your proposal
even if you intended to retire from the field of com-
pany taxation as well as of individual taxation,
although such an arrangement might mean more
revenue for the States.
Mr. BRUCE.—On the principle that you prefer the
Commonwealth to do the taxing ?
Mr. McCORMACK.—No, but on the principle that
while you collect the money from all the people there
is an equal distribution of the cost of the essential ser-
vices of the State.
Mr. BRUCE.—The revenue, is obtained from the
same people, and therefore it does not matter how it is
expended.
Mr. McCORMACK.—Then why all this discussion ?
Mr. BRUCE.-—-These matters are being discussed
for the reasons which I have given. Summarizing them
briefly, they are (1) that the present system is quite
wrong in principle, and (2) it forms a most appalling
danger to the finances of the States, because they do
not know what the exact position will be from one
year to another.
Mr. McCORMACK.—The point has been stressed
that a future Commonwealth Government may do
something different even if we agree to the proposals
now before the Conference.
Mr. BRUCE.—Yet it could invade your field of
taxation. ■ ■■»
Mr. McCORMACK.—It has been pointed out that
if the Commonwealth Government desires to give effect
to these proposals, there is no legal bar to it doing so.
All we can do is stress the fact that the people do not
desire a change.
Mr. BRUCE.—You would have a very much stronger
case if, while direct taxation was being levied by the
States for the necessary requirements of government,
the Commonwealth introduced a scheme for raising
£20,000,000 a year, involving further direct taxation.
The States would be seriously embarrassed in their col-
lections, and there would be no per capita payments to
make up any deficiency.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—At the 1923 Conference,
unanimous proposals were put forward by the State
Governments.
Mr. McKELL.—Those proposals do not bind the
present Governments, and, so far as New South Wales
is concerned, I am not subscribing to anything done by
my predecessors at the 1923 Conference.
Mr. McCORMACK.—During the last election in
Queensland I was frequently asked my views on this
question; but I am not saying that, because I won the
election, I have received a mandate from the people in
regard to it.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—The following unanimous pro-
posals were submitted by the States to the Common-
wealth :
(1) The Commonwealth retire from the field of income taxa-
tion . *
(2) Contingent on this being done, the States relinquish
claim to any share in Customs and excise revenue, and, if
necessary, recoup the Commonwealth on an equitable basis,
loss of revenue to the Commonwealth under these proposals—
the amount payable in each year by the several States to be
determined in conference with the Prime Minister.
(3) This arrangement to be embodied in a ten years’ agree-
ment between the Commonwealth and the States.
Apparently, at that time, the States had no doubt in
regard to the moral right, because they made definite
propositions to the Government.
Mr, McKELL. —That was in regard to income tax.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—Yes.
Mr. McKELL.—The statements in connexion with
the reduction refer to the £3.250,000 in the per capita
arrangement. Yesterday afternoon I admitted that
was a reduction in the payment to the States, but I
added that it was compensated for to a great extent by
the Commonwealth Government taking over old-age
and invalid pensions.
Mr. BRUCE.—The Government did not ask the
States to carry that burden, but reduced the payments
to the States to meet the necessary expenditure. Pos-
sibly the Commonwealth Government has delayed too
long from a mistaken feeling of generosity in deciding
to cut down the per capita payments. While it now
proposes to reduce those payments, we are giving the
States a field from which they can recoup their finances.
Mr. McKELL.—You regard the payments to the
States as a burden on the Commonwealth Government,
but we regard them as an obligation which the Common-
wealth Government owes to the States.
Mr. BRUCE.—I have in mind particularly the func-
tions the Commonwealth has taken over, such as the
whole of the war expenditure and the resultant obliga-
tions.
Mr. McCORMACK.—I do not think you put the
matter fairly when you said that the Commonwealth
Labour Government entered the field of direct taxation
by means of the land tax, seeing that you knew that
the obiective at that time was the breaking up of large
estates.
Mr. BRUCE.—I do not want to misrepresent the
position, but it certainly was taxation;
Mr. McCOßMACK.—Taxation was not the main
objective.


Dr. EARLE PAGE.—Then why was not the money
returned to the States under the Surplus Revenue Act ?
Mr. BRUCE.—The States got nothing back.
Mr. McKELL.—Why did not you give the money
back under section 6 of the Surplus Revenue Act?
Mr. BRUCE.—Because the High Court decided that
it would be a misappropriation, the money having been
appropriated for other purposes.
Mr. ALLAN. —I do not think that we shall come to
any definite conclusion from this discussion, because the
attitude of the different Premiers is that the essential
services of the States, apart from any moral obligation
on the Commonwealth, should be maintained to some
extent bv means of indirect taxation of the people of
the Commonwealth as a whole. If there had been no
war, and the tariff had been in the same position as it
is to-day, there would have been a revenue of
,£39,000.000 to the Federal Government. What would
it have done with that money ?
Mr. BRUCE.—The Government would have had a
large surplus revenue, and it would have carried out
the principles of the Surplus Revenue Act by paying
that money over to the States; but my opening remarks
were directed to show that we have ceased to have a
surplus revenue.
Mr. ALLAN.—I thought you put everything down
to the tariff. There is no reason why the war expendi-
ture should bo treated as a debit to the tariff. It
should be a debit to income tax or anything else which
comes along.
Mr. BRUCE.—-The reason why", in 1910, the States
did not get as much money as usual was because the
surplus revenue had been diminished by the obligations
taken over by the Commonwealth, such as defence and
old-age pensions. The whole basis of the Constitution
is not that the Commonwealth should pay money to the
States because it is a very nice thing to do, but because
the functions which the Commonwealth assumed at its
inception could not absorb anything like the full amount
of its Customs revenue. But as time has gone on, the
States have been relieved of old-age pensions and
defence, and of expenditure connected with the war,
burdens which the States would have had to shoulder
if federation had not been established. The expendi-
ture on those items has more than absorbed the -whole
of the revenue from the field of taxation given to the
Commonwealth.
Mr. McCORMACK. —It must not be forgotten that
manv of the States would have been financially better
off without federation. I do not suggest that federa-
tion is not a good thing, but the States would have been
financially better off if they had remained as separate
States. Of course, they could not have made the same
effort in the war as was made under the federation, or
have done the work which has been carried out by the
Commonwealth.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—Do you think that the sugar
industry in Queensland is better off under federation
than it would have been if federation had not been
established?
Mr. MoCORMACK.—Of course; and I think that
the bootmaking industry in Victoria is better off under
federation.
Mr. BRUCE. —That is a matter which could be argued
at great length, but I know that we are all pleased that
we have Federation. I do not think we are going to
get very far if we discuss all the points which crop up,
but it seems to me to be desirable that the States,
haying stressed the point that they have a moral right
to this money, should also state at some length their
objections to the scheme. For instance, I think that
the question of aggregation should be fully dealt with.
Mr. McCORMACK.—I know that you have a legal
right to carry your proposals into effect, and, if you
proceed along those lines, the States will have to do the
best they can.
Mr. BRUCE. —The better plan is for the represen-
tatives of the States to outline their objections to our
proposals, so that those objections can be analysed.
There would be no necessity for this Conference if we
were not open to conviction on these matters.
Mr. McCORMACK.—I do not say that the moral
right should be persisted in if the safety of the Com-
monwealth is involved, but such a position does not
exist. Our argument is that it does not exist, and
you have not proved that it does. As a consequence, we
believe that there should bo no change in the present
arrangement.
Mr. BRUCE. —Possibly we have come to this point,
that A have not proved that there is necessity for a
change, and you have not proved that it is not neces-
sary for something to be done.
Mr. ALLAN.—You are not very far out.
Mr. BRUCE.—If on reflection the States consider
that the course we propose is wrong or impracticable,
proper reasons should be given. It is most desirable
that the States should put forward all the points they
have against our proposal.
Mr. McKELL.—We did that yesterday, and Dr.
Earle Page dealt with our objections; you do not think
there is much in them.
Mr. BRUCE. —Not taking the case as it was put.
We cannot accept the statements in regard to the ques-
tion of aggregation in the limited way in which they
were put forward. We do not admit that because the
States have accepted a system which, incidentally, we
say is most inequitable, it is impracticable for them to
raise the money we have been raising from the mem-
bers of the public receiving dividends from companies.
I do not think that point has been put as fully as is
necessary.
Mr. COLLIER. —It has been put by the Prime Min-
ister that under these proposals the taxpayers will
not have to pay one penny more, but probably
less. Whilst that may be the case for the first
year, regarding the matter from the point of view
of the taxpayers —which is the only way in which
it should be viewed, your taxpayers being our
taxpayers —if the per capita payments are withdrawn
there will be permanent loss to the States, and any tax
imposed by the States to make good that loss will of
necessity he a permanent impost. Under the present
system, the tax in Commonwealth hands is a
diminishing quantity. • The receipts from individuals
have been reduced in five years by £5,500,000, so that
it is fair to assume that in the years to come there will
be a continuing reduction, the benefit of which will be
felt by the taxpayers. But, under these proposals,
there will be no such benefit to the taxpayers. If the
Commonwealth receives more revenue from Customs
and Excise than it requires, it wil not hand the
money over to the States, but will expend it in the
direction thought best. I say that relief to the
taxpayer will result from leaving things as they are at
present, with a gradual reduction of income tax on indi-
viduals as the needs, consequent upon the expenditure
arising out of the -war, diminish. Taxpayers cannot
hope for any such relief if the States are deprived of
this money, because the States must then impose addi-
tional taxation as a permanent impost.
Mr. BRUCE.—The fundamental mistake in that
argument is shown by examining our proposals. In the
first year the amount required by the States to recoup
payments discontinued under the Surplus Revenue Act
would he £7,687,500, in the second year £7,840,000 ,and
in the third year £7,997,500. In order to pay those
amounts to the States by way of a per capita allowance,
the Commonwealth will have to tax somebody in Aus-
tralia. Similarly, if the States are to find the same
amount, they will have to tax somebody, so that the
position will not he varied.
Mr. COLLIER. —But in so far as you raise the money
through the Customs, you will continue to tax the
people through that channel.


Mr. GUNN. You will not reduce your Customs
revenue.
Mr. BRUCE. —We reduced Customs taxation last
year by £750,000, and next year we may have to reduce
it again. We may continue to reduce it, or we may
leave the field of company taxation or land taxation.
Mr. COLLIER. —We are speaking of the Customs
revenue.
Mr. GUNN. The total income of the Common-
wealth is increasing.
Mr. BRUCE.—If it continues to increase, it is
obvious that we shall have to reduce taxation. Mr.
Collier’s point is that if we pay £7,500,000 to the
States, instead of them raising exactly the same amount,
there will be a reduction of taxation to the people of
Australia; but that argument cannot hold good for a
moment. There will be precisely the same result.
Mr. COLLIER. —No; you will continue to raise the
money through the Customs and Excise.
Mr. BRUCE. —In the past, we have raised a certain
revenue by means of Customs imposts, income tax on
individuals and companies, land tax, entertainment
tax, and probate duties. Our object has always been
to obtain just as much as is necessary to meet our com-
mitments, one of which is this amount of £7,500,000
to be paid to the States. If we have sufficient revenue
to pay that sum, and still reduce taxation, we do so;
otherwise, we have to leave the taxation alone. There-
fore, the position is exactly the same whether we raise
the money and pay it to the States, or whether the
States raise it. A certain amount has to be raised,
and there is only one body of taxpayers from which to
obtain it.
Mr. COLLIER. —But it is a different matter raising
the money through the Customs, to which all contri-
bute, from raising it, as is done in Western Australia,
for example, from only 13 per cent, of the population.
Mr. BRUCE. —I agree that there is a distinction,
but it does not make the slightest alteration in the
burden which is placed upon the people. Certain in-
dividuals may be affected, and, in that connexion,
there is an absolute difference of opinion. I have
already quoted the remarks of Mr. Anstey, who says
that the Customs revenue should be decreased by one-
half, and that the direct taxation should be increased
to about £130,000,000; but that is a question as to
which individuals and governments may hold divergent
views. Still, the amount of taxation which the people
have to pay is not affected.
Mr. LYONS. —Look at the situation which has
arisen since the last occasion upon which you made
proposals of this character. If we had accepted them
at that time, we would have been compelled to cling
to every copper of our,taxation in order to meet our
obligations; but we did not accept them, and the Com-
monwealth continued to collect the money. On one or
two occasions, it has reduced taxation, and, therefore,
the taxpayers in Tasmania have benefited.
Mr. BRUCE. Suppose that the optimistic views
which are held about Commonwealth Customs revenue
are realized, and we continue to get such heavy re-
turns, that next year we can abandon the company tax,
and in the following year the land tax, the entertain-
ment tax, or the probate duties. Those will then he
fields in which your State can levy taxation if it
chooses; and, surely, it is just as open to you to reduce
taxation when you are deriving an additional benefit.
Mr. LYONS.—I am referring to what has actually
happened since the last proposals were made by the
Commonwealth.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—If they had been put into
effect, what would have happened ?
Mr. LYONS. —We would have been compelled to
continue the high rate of taxation.
Dr. EARLE PAGE. —No; if we could have re-
duced taxation to the extend of £4,000,000, we would
have deducted the amount from probate duties or the
company tax, for instance, which would have been a
direct benefit to the States.
Mr. McKELL. —Or you might have put the surplus
into a trust fund!
Dr. EARLE PAGE. —The fact remains that we have
continued to reduce taxation, as we shall do in the
future, because it is our definite policy. Every one
seems to assume that the Commonwealth will be able
to evacuate the field of direct taxation immediately,
but 1 venture to say that if the per capita payments are
continued, there will be no possibility of the Common-
wealth leaving that field inside a couple of generations.
Already over £7,000,000 is being raised by direct taxa-
tion on companies, land, probate, and entertainments.
Mr. COLLIER. —The Commonwealth may not
abandon the field entirely, but it will, be reducing the
taxation, especially if it finds that there are sufficient
surplus funds to enable it to embark upon schemes in-
volving the expenditure of £20,000,000 in ten yhars,
as is the case in regard to roads and housing. It may
be said that the people are obtaining in return some-
thing which is essential; but it is possible that they
would prefer to manage without such advantages rather
than have increased taxation levied upon them.
Mr. BRUCE.—I do not think that the questions of
roads and housing enter into this discussion, for this
reason: We have made it perfectly definite that if the
roads suggestion is followed it will mean new taxation—
namely, upon the requisites of motorists and motor
transport generally. We shall only levy such taxa-
tion, because the benefits to the motor transport sys-
tem, and to the people generally, will be greater than
the increased burden imposed. Further, the question
of housing does not involve a liability upon the Com-
monwealth revenue. A scheme of that description
will be conducted through an agency of the Com-
monwealth, such as the Commonwealth Bank; but it
is not a question of large or small revenue.
Mr. COLLIER. —I may mention that we already
have a petrol tax in Western Australia, which we shall
be compelled to withdraw as soon as the Commonwealth
tax is imposed; but that is another matter.
Mr. McCOßMACK.—Referring to the remarks of
Dr. Earle Page, during the last five years the Com-
monwealth Government has been making the per
capita payments to the States, and it has slowly but
surely reduced direct taxation. We contend that as
time elapses the same process will continue, and, conse-
quently, we do not see any necessity to interfere with
the per capita payments.
Mr. BRUCE.—Let me put another side of the pic-
ture. Suppose that all cur prognostications concern-
ing the Customs revenue are falsified, and the protec-
tionist policy, which we have strengthened a good deal
by the recent tariff, has the effect of reducing the re-
ceipts, or suppose that times are not so good, so that
in order to make the per capita payments we have to
go further into the field of direct taxation. I think
that it would suit the States very much better to know
that we were right out of the field, and were under the
disability of not being able to return, rather than to
have us still further invading their domain.
Mr. McCORMACK. —If the protective duties did
really protect, the Commonwealth revenue would be
cut down, and you would be compelled to impose direct
taxation again.
Mr. BRUCE.—We would hesitate for a very long
time
Mr. McCORMACK.—You would not reduce the
duties so as to increase your receipts, after having once
established home industries.
Mr. BRUCE. —A mistake is often made in regarding
the revenue obtained through the Customs as arising
from the protectionist duties imposed to safeguard the
industries of the country. That is true as to a pro-
portion of the income, but excise duties on spirituous
liquors and duties on tobacco, &c., are responsible for
a total of about £12,000,000.
Mr. McCORMACK. —Suppose that prohibition were
introduced.


Mr. BRUCE.—It would then be necessary to slug
the smoker. The Commonwealth would have to cut its
cloth according to its circumstances at the moment.
Taxation would have to be raised in the best possible
way, and we would be compelled to reduce our ex-
penditure in every conceivable direction. Wo should
bo gravely embarrassed in attempting to return to the
field of direct taxation. There is another alternative.
The per capita payments may continue, and the Customs
revenue disappear, the vivid picture which has been
drawn in relation to the buoyant revenue not being
realized.
Mr. McCORMACK. —It is not a picture; it is a
reality.
Mr. BRUCE.—Then suppose that the reality
changes. Inevitably, a scheme such as that introduced
by Mr. Watt will be put into operation, and there will
be a gradual cutting down of the payment to the
States, for the reason that the Commonwealth revenue
will not be sufficient to enable them to be made. The
position of the States will then he very much worse
than under these proposals. It must also be remembered
that in such circumstances the Commonwealth would
not be able to make adjustments for the weaker States,
and would simply have to reduce the payments which it
could make.
Mr. GUNN.—Is the Commonwealth Government
determined to proceed with these proposals irrespective
of the views of the States?
Mr. BRUCE.—We are determined to adopt them un-
less we are shown that they are impracticable and can-
not be worked. It seems to me that we have devoted
very little of our time to that aspect of the matter. All
the discussion has centered round the question whether
there is a moral right to the payments, and very im-
portant points, such as aggregation and other diffi-
culties which may exist, have only been touched upon
cursorily.
Mr. GUNN.:—Bub to whom is there any advantage ?
The Commonwealth simply establishes what is, after
all, a very abstract principle.
Mr. BRUCE.—There is an advantage to the States
in safeguarding their future position.
Mr. GUNN.—But suppose that the States say that
they are prepared to take the risk?
Mr. COLLIER.—We are asked to agree to the pro-
posals because the same thing may happen years hence.
Mr. BRUCE.—No, not the same thing. This is
quite a good and fair proposition. Something very
disastrous may occur in the future.
Mr. McKELL.—You are actuated by a pure desire
to help the States ?
Mr. BRUCE.—To a great extent.
Mr. McKELL.—I wish that we could see the matter
in the same light.
Mr. BRUCE.—I can observe the immediate diffi-
culty facing the unfortunate Treasurer who has to levy
the tax.
Mr. GUNN.—Not only the present tax, but mofe
taxes.
Mr. BRUCE.—Not an additional tax.
Mr. GUNN.—Yes.
Mr. BRUCE.—There need not be a penny of addi-
tional tax. On the contrary, there should be a reduc-
tion.
Mr. COLLlEß.—Concerning the disaster which may
happen to us in the future, you are secure for three
years, so that I suggest the payments be allowed to con-
tinue until the three years have elapsed, and that we
consider the matter again before the impending dis-
aster comes upon us.
Mr. BRUCE.—I.do not admit that we are secure
for three years. In the event of a complete reversal
of the Commonwealth’s financial position, we tell you
quite frankly that we do not concede any moral right
on the part of the States to receive this money, and
we do not regard it as proper that we should go further
into the arena of direct taxation in order to raise
revenue for the purpose of making the payments. The
inevitable alternative, if things went wrong, would be
to reduce the per capita payments to the States.
Mr. COLLIER. —There is no indication that any-
thing will go wrong in the immediate future.
Mr. BRUCE.—Life is an uncertain thing.
Mr. COLLIER.—But you are pretty secure for
three years.
Mr. GUNN. —There are no indications that the
revenue of the Commonwealth will be affected immedi-
ately.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—We are never sure of the
position from year to year. The slump in 1921-22 was
not expected.
Mr. McCORMACK.—It happens every year that you
are better off than you anticipated.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—No. In 1921-2 the revenue
was £4,000,000 below that of the previous year.
Mr. McCORMACK.—There were very obvious rea-
sons for that.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—No one can tell what will
happen next year. There may be a big drought in the
country.
Mr. McKELL.—That is why we are chary about
accepting this proposal.
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—A drought would hit the Cus-
toms to the extent of 16 per cent, and the income tax
to the extent of only 3 per cent.
Mr. McKELL.—But have you contemplated what
would happen to the States, which would derive 70 per
cent, of their revenue from income tax, if there were
three or four droughts ?
Dr. EARLE PAGE,—We are obtaining practically
all our income from Customs duties, which are very
fluctuating-.
Mr. GUNN.—How do you arrive at the conclusion
that if there were a drought the Customs would be
affected by 17 per cent, and the income tax by only 3
per cent. ?
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—Because that is exactly what
happened in 1921-2, when the slump took place. The
income tax was scarcely altered, while the Customs re-
ceipts dropped £4,000,000.
Mr. GUNN.—I do not think that you can take one
year as a guide. The returns depend upon prices and
other factors.
Dr. EARLE PAGE. —But the considerations which
affect Customs also affect income tax.
Mr. McKELL.—What happened in the next year?
Dr. EARLE PAGE.—The revenue increased by
practically the same amount.
Mr. GUNN.—What surplus do you anticipate this
year ?
■ Mr, BRUCE.—We are not anticipating anything
yet.
Mr. GUNN.—I do not think that any one would dare
to ask such a question of any State Treasurer.
Mr. BRUCE.—But the State Treasurers seem to be
able to ask it at the Commonwealth.
Mr. COLLIER. —We envy the Commonwealth Trea-
surer.
Mr. McCORMACK. —Because we know the present
figures.
Mr. BRUCE. —Well, are there any further points to
be discussed, because I do think it very important that
the question of the method of raising this revenue, and
most certainly the matter of any inequitable result as
between the States, together with any other difficulties,
should be considered by the Conference before it con-
cludes ?
Mr. ALLAN.—It is evident that we have practically
reached a deadlock, which is partly because the States
feel that they will have to impose all the odious direct
taxation while the Commonwealth will be freed
from such an obligation. There is also the
point that thq States do not consider they


will be nearly so well oil as the Prime Minis-
ter’s statement would lead them to believe. As the
introduction of the Commonwealth scheme immediately
upon the termination of the current financial year
would necessarily involve undue hurry, I suggest that
another Conference be called at a later date, when
there may be a different atmosphere. At all events,
the Commonwealth will know its financial position much
better than it does at present, and the States will have
had time to consider where they stand.
Mr. BRUCE.—This cannot be called a new subject,
because it was brought forward in 1923, and it has
been more or less under discussion since then, so that I
do not think it can be pushed aside with the statement
that another Conference be held when the atmos-
phere may possibly have changed. I have heard the
remarks of the State Premiers, and I am not particu-
larly optimistic that their point of view is likely to alter
very much.
Mr. McCORMACK. —They may become more hostile.
Mr. McKELL.—Or there may bo a different set of
Premiers !
Mr. ALLAN. —If, for instance, the Commonwealth
were able to say at the next conference that it would
evacuate practically the whole field of income tax and
land tax, the atmosphere might be altered considerably.
Mr. BRUCE.—This discussion merely goes to the
point that the States would not be receiving quite
enough under the proposals, and that, if something more
attractive were offered, you would begin to take a dif-
ferent view.
Mr. McCORMACK.—That is not the position.
Mr. BRUCE.—I did not think that it was, but the
point was put by Mr. Allan. May I make another
suggestion. We now have all the taxation authorities
present, which very seldom happens, and, as they hold
certain views, in relation to the difficulties in the way
of aggregation of company taxation, for example, they
might hold a conference in order to make various points
perfectly clear to the representatives of the Common
wealth. I agree that it is difficult for a Premier or
Treasurer to submit to a Conference such as this all the;
technical considerations regarding the collection of
taxes, but. after the taxation authorities had threshed
out the matter, the different Premiers and Treasurers
could put very definitely the points raised.
Mr., ALLAN. —If we had been agreeable to the pro-
posal of the Commonwealth, when did you intend to
introduce the scheme?
Mr. BRUCE.—Next year, because the figures quite
definitely deal with the financial year 1926-7.
Mr. McCORMACK.—I have not brought my taxa
tion officials to Melbourne, for the simple reason that
my logical stand upon the question does not allow of
any investigation.
Mr. BRUCE.—No, because you say that you possess
a certain right which we are taking away.
Mr. McCORMACK. —If we accepted the principle
I would be prepared to discuss the difficulties in the
way; but, as we do not accept it, there is no necessity
for anv discussion. •
Mr. BRUCE.—I can see that point of view., but 1
think it very desirable that the Commonwealth, in pro-
ceeding with these proposals, should make the fullest
examination of the position of the different States.' We
have made our suggestion as we view the situation, and
have set out what we believe will give fair and equitable
treatment of the States; but if we obtain no further
information, or no discussion takes place 1 , there is very
little to indicate any direction in which the proposals
may be modified in order to ensure that fairer treat-
ment.
Mr. McCORMACK.—But cannot you see that if we
entered into such a discussion, we would be practically
admitting your contention.
Mr. BRUCE. —I do not think so. You have made
yo ir views quite clear.
Mr. McCORMACK.—The only way in which you
could shake what I feel to be the opinion of the citizens
of the States would be to show an absolute necessity for
the change.. It would then be necessary for us to con-
sider the matter from your point of view.
Mr. BRUCE.—In the interests of the States, I think
that it is rather undesirable lo wait until such time as
the Commonwealth is hard pressed, and then to force
upon them an arrangement which may not ensure the
liberal treatment indicated in the present proposition.
Mr. McKELL.—We are prepared to wait until the
Commonwealth is hard pressed.
Mr. BRUCE. —It is for the Premiers to decide, but
1 think it most desirable that there should be discus-
sion amongst the officials of the different States with
regard to the basis of these proposals.
Sir ALEXANDER PEACOCK.—It is now the end
of May, and I am sure that it will come as a great shook
to the people of Australia if an alteration in the whole
of the financial relations between the Commonwealth
and the States is made in the next financial year.
Mr. BRUCE.—There has been a great deal of dis-
cussion upon this subject, and it is really a matter of
adjustment between the governments concerned, be-
cause the same taxpayers are affected. There is no ques-
tion of an adjustment between the people.
Sir ALEXANDER PEACOCK.—But the effect upon
the people must be considered.
Mr. ALLAN. —My point was that, having regard to
the strong objection of the Premiers, it would.not be
serious to delay the matter for a year, when the atmos-
sphere may have changed.
Mr. McCORMACK. —If the Commonwealth feels that
it is right to proceed with its proposal, we will be in no
different position, because I do not think that it is in-
tended to do anything unfair to the States. We shall
then be compelled to re-organize our systems. I make
this statement in all seriousness, for the reason that the
Commonwealth would certainly not continue to collect
more revenue than it needed. Consequently, it would
evacuate certain fields of taxation, and we would be
compelled to enter them. In what way would our posi-
tion be made worse ?
Mr. BRUCE. —Take, for instance, a question such
as the allocation of the central office collections. We
have taken one basis, and some of the Premiers think
that we should have taken another. If, upon considera-
tion, the conclusion was reached that the latter basis
was more reasonable and fair, we would have no objec-
tion to altering our proposal.
Mr. McCORMACK.—But I think that you would be
compelled to go as far as you could to help the States.
Mr. BRUCE. —Quite. That is the whole basis of our
scheme.
Mr. McCOßMACK.—Consequently, you would be
taking the responsibility, and we would be involved to
that extent, whether we liked it or not; but it is another
matter to agree that you should put this plan into effect.
Looking at the question from the political point of
view, it may be said that I tax my opponents, so that I
am fighting for some people who do not support me.
Mr. Collier also says that the taxation is imposed upon
one class; but that is not the point. The question is
whether the proposal is right—whether there is a need
for it. If the Commonwealth can prove such a need, I
will withdraw my objection; but it has not done so. In
the event of another national catastrophe occurring, it
would be necessary for the Commonwealth to again
enter the field of direct taxation, and we would have to
cut our cloth accordingly. If it were found necessary
to take away the per capita payments it would be done,
and the States could not object; but there must be a
need for it.
Mr. BRUCE. —The difficulty is that the Common-
wealth has made this suggestion, but the States have
raised no point as to any of the bases which we have
taken being wrong ones. I had hoped to obtain such
views from the Premiers—taking the particular case of
the central office collections as an instance. It has been


stated clearly that the States do not like the proposition,
and do not think that it is necessary, but they have
simply put forward what is claimed to be a moral right.
Mr. GUNN.—The different Premiers have indicated
the dislocation which would result. For instance, the
Commissioner of Taxes in South Australia, who. is the
Deputy Federal Commissioner, has supplied figures
which show that you are wrong to the extent of over
£200,000.
Dr. EARLE PAGE. —He supplied us with the infor-
mation upon which our proposals are based.
Mr. GUNN. —He has no knowledge of it.
Dr. EARLE PAGE'.—The figures came from your
taxation office.
Mr. COLLIER.—You are wrong to the extent of
£IOO,OOO in the case of Western Australia, and the in-
formation which you obtained did not come from our
taxation office, although the same Commissioner controls
loth State and Federal taxation.
Mr. GUNN.—You may take my word that«bh'e intro-
duction of the scheme would mean a complete dislocation
of our finances in South Australia. It would be essen-
tial for us to increase the burden upon our people, as,
although a certain field may be open to the Common-
wealth because of its methods, it would not be open to
us. If the Commonwealth could show that there was an
outstanding national need for putting .us to the trouble
of imposing heavier taxes upon our people, we would
consider the matter in quite a different light, but we are
told that more revenue is not desired, and that there
will be a decrease in taxation, which we doubt very
much. I cannot see how any section of the community
will benefit.
Mr. BRUCE. —We rather part company when you
say that the proposals mean imposing greater burdens
upon the taxpayers, because, if anything, those burdens
will be reduced. If the matter were examined, and
it could be demonstrated that the finances of one
State would be dislocated, while another State would
do too well out of the arrangement, it would be neces-
sary for us to make an adjustment between the two
States; but, at present, we have not that information.
We can, of course, obtain further particulars from our
Deputy Commissioners of Taxation.
Mr. GUNN.—Do not you realize that the States are
facing very grave financial difficulties. Why throw
greater burdens upon their shoulders ?■
Mr. BRUCE.—Surely that is not what we are doing.
We are finding an amount of £2,000,000 in order to
obviate anything of the sort. That is our whole inten-
tion.
Mr. GUNN. —The proposal means a re-casting of
taxation legislation in every State.
Mr. BRUCE.—Is that an unmitigated evil ? - We
have several times tried to bring about uniform taxa-
tion in the different States, the rates to be determincd-
by the respective Parliaments, which would certainly
be a very desirable result.
Mr. GUNN.—It is impossible.
Mr. McCORMACK. —If one State secured an ad-
vantage in consequence of the scheme, do you think
that it would disgorge to a State which was placed at
a disadvantage ?
Mr. BRUCE. —If we obtained the facts, we would
revise the scheme, so that the fortunate State would
have to disgorge. Well, the only issue is whether you
consider it desirable for the taxation officers to meet.
The matter is entirely in the hands of the States.
Mr. COLLIER. —I do not think that there is any
need for them to meet.
Mr. McKELL.—Nor do I. My eonsidered view is
that the proposals should be withdrawn.
Sir ALEXANDER PEACOCK.—Not withdrawn;
but they should not be prosecuted at this stage.
Mr. McKELL.—I consider that we have a moral
right to a share of the Customs and excise revenue,
and I fear that these proposals would bring about in the
States a financial condition too serious to contemplate.
Mr. BRUCE.—Do you think that it is desirable for
the States officers to meet those of the Commonwealth,
Mr. Allan ?
Mr. ALLAN.—I do not offer any objection, because
I have maintained all through that we should get a
definite field of State taxation; and 1 admit that once
you evacuate a certain sphere it will be very hard for
you to return.
Mr. McCORMACK. —My views have been made
clear.
Mr. GUNN.—I do not consider that there is any
need to make this move, as it will upset the finances
of every State, while the finances of the Commonwealth
will not be dislocated if matters remain as at present.
There will be a surplus again this year, while many
States will terminate the year with deficits, and will
have to impose new taxation. They are not financing
correctly now, and, consequently, 1 feel that in their
interests the proposals should be withdrawn.
Mr. BRUCE.—Is it considered desirable for the taxa-
tion officials to meet?
Mr. GUNN.—I do not think that it is.
Mr. COLLIER. —1 see no need for them to meet. I
am opposed to the whole principle, and I do not feel
that any purpose would be served by examining the
matter.
Mr. LYONS.—That expresses my view. As the
States have definitely declared against the principle
involved, it is not much use having a further investi-
gation of the.figures.
Mr. BRUCE.—The attitude taken up by the State
Premiers is quite clear—they consider that no advan-
tage is to be gained by the Conference being continued.
The position, therefore, is that the States leave it to
the Commonwealth to decide what action it will take.
I am sorry that the Commonwealth and the States have
not been able to see eye to eye, but such a state of
affairs is quite conceivable having regard to all the
circumstances. 1 am greatly obliged to the Premiers,
and to the Minister representing the Premier of New
South Wales, for attending the Conference, and giv-
ing the Commonwealth the benefit of their views in
regard to these very important proposals. I do not
think that there are any other financial questions which
require to be considered at the present time at a con-
ference of the Commonwealth and States, but I would
, remind you that there is a meeting of the Loan Council
to-moffow morning at 10 o’clock. The only matter
remaining to be mentioned is that of health. Bast year
the Commonwealth appointed a royal commission to
investigate the problem of national health, with the
object of bringing about better co-operation between
State and Federal authorities. The report of that
royal commission has been received by the Common-
wealth Government, and I have no doubt that copies
have been made available to the Premiers. In view
of the recommendations made by the royal commission,
my Government considers it most desirable that a con-
ference take place between the Ministers administering
the portfolio of health in the various States and the
Commonwealth Minister for Health, Sir Neville Howse.
At such a gathering all the points raised by the royal
commission can be discussed, and it can be decided how
the co-operation between the States and the Common-
wealth can be advanced in a general scheme aiming
at the improvement of the national health in Australia.
1 do not ask the Premiers to express any views upon
the question of health to-day, but I certainly think
that a conference of Health Ministers would be pro-
ductive of benefit.
Mr. GUNN.—If a definite date is fixed for holding
that Conference the Minister of Health from my State
will attend.
Mr. BRUCE.—The Commonwealth will get in touch
with the different States in order to fix a date that
will be convenient.


Sir ALEXANDER PEACOCK.—I lake it that the
conference of Health Ministers will be held in Mel-
bourne.
Mr. BRUCE.—Yes.
Mr. ALLAN.—My Minister of Health will certainly
be present, particularly if the conference is held in Mel-
bourne.
Mr. BRUCE.—I think that concludes the business
of this Conference, although, of course, I will be quite
prepared to meet Premiers individually in regard to any
matters concerning their particular States.
Mr. McKELL.—On behalf of the Premiers, I desire
to extend to you our sincere thanks for your invitation
to attend this Conference, and for presiding over our
deliberations. Our thanks are also due to you for the
thoughtful and courteous attitude that you have adopted
throughout the proceedings.
Mr. ALLAN.—I heartily support the remarks just
made by Mr. MoKell. I would not say that this Con-
ference has not achieved something. I believe that the
atmosphere in regard to Commonwealth and State
finance is clearer now than it was before these proceed-
ings began. On behalf of my State, I thank you for
giving the Premiers the opportunity of meeting yon
to discuss the proposals, because it is fully realized that
the Commonwealth could have gone on with its scheme
without consulting the States. It is desirable and ad-
visable, of course, that there should be a continuance of
the between the States and the Com-
monwealth, and, therefore, your action in calling this
Conference is much appreciated. We are also grateful
for the way in whiefc you have presided over the pro-
ceedings, because you have not taken up a stand-and-
deliver attitude, such as, I regret to say, was adopted
on a previous occasion, and which must always result
in a deadlock. The discussion at the present Conference
has been quite amicable, there has been no bitterness,
and although we have not arrived at a definite and
clear understanding, nothing has hajipened to indicate
that we may not eventually come to an agreement.
Mr. BRUCE.—I am very much obliged for the nice
things that have been said about me. It certainly is
very desirable that the heads of the respective Govern-
ments in Australia —Commonwealth and State —should
be given an opportunity to meet together occasionally to
discuss matters of mutual interest. lam sorry that the
Coi' T n on wealth and the States have not been able to
see eyeN'->»eye at this Conference, but still we have the
satisfaction of knowing that we have all expressed our
views very clearly and definitely. Ido not think there
can be said to be any misunderstanding in regard to
what any of you think upon this somewhat difficult
subject. The Commonwealth Government appreciates
the action of the States in sending representatives to
the Conference in response to its invitation.
The Conference terminated at 1.15 p.m.
