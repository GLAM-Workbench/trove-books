A WOPPING MAN.
In early life lie made a complete Chopping Block of his reputation
and went to Sea for another, where, although the son of a Butcher,
he out up badly While in Chili it is thought probable that he cracked
several Spanish nuts, inasmuch as though the place was Chili, it turned
out to be too hot for him. The truth is that whenever he wanted to
get at a Kernel he didn?t stand upon trifles.
While young he had St. Vitus? Dance, but it is thought he gave it up for the Double
Shuffle. On his return to England he was weighed and found to be 15 stone, while the
boatswain of the ship, tested by the same Lever, turned out to be Peebles. He again
left Wapping. The Storey about him during the voyage was The Captain. On reaching
Hobart Town, he took to butchering, and became possessed of two enormous calves
which he has to this day.
It has been reported - that he was in the Brighton card case, if so it must have
been a ease of no ordinary dimensions. That he is fond of blacklegs is proved by
and that he knew Don Pedro is an established fact. For
many years he kept his (s) car, in which, however, despite its doubling [Dublin]
propensities he never rode. Horse dealing [mind the pronounciation] became his
favourite pastime, and here again his (s) Wapping propensities clung to him. At
this time, being hard up, he changed?his name. It was thought at this period that
he would have become a [hlaltered man.
He subsequently went to the Diggings, which for a man of his pretentions was, to say
the least, in for a dig [infra dig]. The Claimant believes he will yet turn up, and so does
every one else who is not a fool. Others said that he dyed, and others that it would have been a
good job if he had. The greater probability is that he returned to England,and that asharp eye
will yet detect him hanging about Newgate Market, for which he is known to have a decided
predilection. _ , , , , , ,
The <ï¿½l,ooo is lodged at the Bank of England, and may be had by
the discoverer of Arthur Orton or any other man on producing the
necessary voucher.
In order that justice shall not be defeated it is desirable that this Bill shall he posted here
there and everywhere. ....
