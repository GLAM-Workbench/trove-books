A HUMBLE TRIBUTE.
Dead ? No, not truly dead,
But simply passed to that dim bourne
Beyond our mortal ken,
A few brief moons before we, too, depart.
Broken Columns ? Nay, not broken,
But completed, rounded, grand;
Made doubly big and noble
By the beauty of the sacrifice.
A Laurel Wreath ? No wreath has yet been bound
That's meet to deck your brow ;
Your soul, so splendid in unconscious worth,
Will live though all else die. . . )
Big-hearted, big-souled men,
This earth will ne'er forget your death
Which gave us life,
And memory will bear you sacred.
And now in sorrow, love and honour
We bow our heads
To you, Our Heroes—-
Our Mates, who died.
—S. W. HODGE.

FOREWORD
TTAVING been asked to write the Foreword of this
J. J. the Third Volume of the " Yandoo," I must first
express my appreciation of the honour of following in the
footsteps of such able men and soldiers —Col. Macartney,
D.S.O., and Major Playfair, O.B.E., D.S.O., the writers
of the Foreword in the previous two volumes.
Being an original member of the yth F. A. Brigade,
and with it until the time of its demobilisation, I feel
I am in a position to know what a large amount of
splendid work has been done by this organ. Issues
have been printed, as you can see, right through our period
at the war, and under all sorts of conditions. At
times it was not possible to give the Editor and staff all
the consideration they deserved, and adversities occurred
which would have "knocked'''' any ordinary men, but they
always came up smiling with another issue, and no praise
can be too high for the unselfish and untiring efforts
displayed by the management.
By perusing the casualty list you will observe what a
large number of new men must have come into the brigade.
The motto of the " Yandoo " was " Esprit de Corps,"
and it was not long before these men were made to feel as
members of a large family. On all occasions it has
considerably helped to promote the feeling of good
fellowship, and the Management can rest assured its
original object has been more than fulfilled, and it has
not " lived in vain."

INTRODUCTION
j INTRODUCTION
vt- -'J
IN accepting the honour bestowed upon me of introducing the
third and concluding volume of " Yandoo," my thoughts
naturally wander back over the life of " Yandoo," even
further back still to a day on board H.M.A.T. " Argyllshire," in
May, 1916, when two " diggers "—Acting Bombardier S. E. Rohu
and Gunner E. Harding—first came and suggested its birth. I
remember voicing some of the difficulties likely to be met with,
but they were keen, and no difficulty seemed too great, and so they
commenced, and later enrolled to their number Gunners B. C.
Duckworth and S. W. Hodge, and throughout the four years the
good work well commenced has continued. All sorts of difficulties
were met with, great and small, ranging from the melting of the
wax sheets on the eve of publication when in the Tropics, the
freezing of the same sheets during publication in winter-time in
France, or the heavy hand of the censor removing the laugh from a
joke, to the loss of the whole outfit when the brigade was racing
south to fill the Somme gap, in March, 19x8, but fortunately the
management were not included in the outfit, so the " Yandoo "
still lived, and these persistent fellows, by their determination,
continued the publications, giving us Vols. I and 11, published
during the war, and now giving us Vol. 111, " The Daddy of the Lot."
They have provided something permanent to carry with us, some-
thing to act as a substitute for a pal when left alone, for I feel sure
that every member of the brigade reading through " Yandoo "
in years to come, will immediately be transformed back to a scene
amidst those friends and associates this war has given us; for
every page of "Yandoo" aims at and succeeds in fostering these
associations.
How much are we indebted to these four men—S. Rohu, E.
Harding, B. Duckworth and S. Hodge ? Think it out as you
read through and through in future years; the same answer will
come to us all.
Though the war is over, the brigade will live with us all for
ever, and with the brigade will live the " Yandoo." It was
impossible for associations such as were made in the 7th Brigade
to continue until 1920, and then to suddenly cease, and so the 7th
Brigade F.A.B. Reunion Club was formed, and is going " good
and strong," meeting periodically to talk over things that happened
or things that didn't, but always providing that same wonderful
opportunity when friends again meet and firmly shake. The
Committee has the active support of the "Yandoo" Management,
so keep in close touch, and keep other members in touch, for who
knows perhaps even yet Volume 111 may have a successor ?
T. A. J. PLAYFAIR,
Major.


Cr
PREFACE
v- -y
THE final production of " The Yandoo," so long looked
forward to, has at last become an accomplished fact.
Throughout the vicissitudes of the campaign, a gleam of light,
a ray of hope, could be discerned through the gloomy shadow of a
protracted and apparently unending struggle. Sometimes that
light,. or ray of hope, was dim; sometimes it was almost invisible,
and the effect was noted in the grim, dogged demeanour of the
troops. Then on occasions it was transcendent, dispersing the
dullness and monotony; and finally when our armies were victor-
ious, that light shone out unmistakably, and it was realised that
the dreams of home and return to the associations of the sunny
homeland were about to be realised. Throughout that long
period of ups and downs, that prolonged alternation of expectancy
and disappointment, " The Yandoo " continued its publications,,
advocating .a cheerful optimism, consistently looking forward to
the great event, the final volume of the paper which was to be,
coincident with the return of the brigade to Australia.
In the first publication of the paper after leaving Cape Town on
the voyage to England, the intention was announced of continuing
" The Yandoo" throughout the voyage, during the period of
training, and in the firing line. That plan has been fulfilled, and
the issues of the paper dealing with the operations in France are
herein produced to supplement Volumes I and II respectively,
chronicling the periods on the troopship and in training in England.
As far as we know " The Yandoo " is the only diggers' journal to
accompany its unit from transport to training camp, from training
camp to firing-line (there the paper was actually compiled
alongside the guns in action at Messines), and from firing-line
back to England and thence to Australia, to have its final part'
published and the entire publication completed in volume form.
With the idea of preserving the character of the paper as printed
and issued in the war zone, the whole reproductions of the original
parts have been done by photography.
The sketches were not executed in pen and ink, but by the
tedious process of cutting the outline into a wax sheet with a steel
§tilo, the sheet then being placed on the duplicator and run off in
the usual way. During the hot weathei the wax often melted,
necessitating new sketches, and causing much bad language. The
wax stencils for the typewritten sheets were often cut three times
before a sufficient number of copies could be got for issue.
The average number of copies for each issue in France was
1,200. comprising six or eight sheets making a total of anything
between 7,000 and 9,000 sheets to be turned out by hand through
the duplicator.
Sports and concert programmes, menu cards, etc. were also
printed by the aid of the Ellams duplicator A "speedometer"
was attached to the machine and registered, from the time we
purchased it at Capetown to the completion of our last issue
225,000 revolutions !!!!
It has been decided to place the Oliver Typewriter (which was
used for typing the " Yandoo") in the Australian War Museum
Difficulties innumerable were experienced. The matter of the
transport of the typewriter, duplicator, and other accessories, was


a constant concern to the Management, but thanks to the co-opera-
tion and loyal support manifested by a number of the brigade
officers, and not a few of other ranks, " The Yandoo " equipment
found its place on a limber in the line of march. On the occasion
of the great retreat (on the Somme) early in 1918, when the Hun was
pressing hard in his last despairing effort to pierce the Allied line,
" The Yandoo " equipment had to be sacrificed in the interests of
mobility, during the Australian's advance to meet the oncoming
enemy, and was left behind at Witternesse. Fortunately the
enemy was stopped before reaching the village, and some months
later, when the position was less critical, it was possible to return
per motor lorry and restore the equipment to the brigade intact.
Throughout its checkered career the paper has had the unreserved
support of Colonel H. D. K. Macartney, Major T. A. J. Playfair,
Captain L. J. Colquhoun, Lieutenant E. A. Cody, Lieutenant H. R.
Pountney, Corporal W. Ryder, Bombadier L. J. Boone, Gunners R.
Oakes, R. Kirkpatrick, Driver H. C. Neilly, as well as others too
numerous to mention, and the Management in placing on record its
obligation to these gentlemen confidently asserts that, without such
backing, the paper would long since have been defunct.
The photos, in the Roll of Honor include ex-members who were
transferred to other units, and there unfortunately met their deaths.
According to the data available to the management, the deaths
w'thin the brigade were 126, and, with 23 deaths of ex-members,
making a total of 149. We have been exceedingly fortunate in
securing 143 of those photos., and our thanks go to the next of
kin, and friends who supplied them-
The nominal rolls are as complete as it was possible to get them.
The photos contained herein are by K. Grieves, H. R. Jackson,
P. M. Herbert, F. S. Chapman, J. M. Allport, C. M. Gardner, W. C.
Fahey, C. Ross, S. E. Rohu, and the Australian Official Photo-
grapher.
The sketches are by B. C. Duckworth, and the Xmas cards by
G. Bleach and L. H. Browne.
We also record our appreciation for assistance to Mr. F. C.
Hilzinger for looking after " Yandoo" matters in Sydney, prior to
the Management's return; to Mr. and Mrs. J. McCann, of Padding-
ton, in placing an office at the disposal of the Management; and
to the National State Government, Brigadier-General Grimwade,
Major Playfair, and those members of the 7th F. A. B. whose
financial assistance rendered possible this publication.
Its mission now accomplished, " The Yandoo extends its
heartfelt sympathy to the relatives and friends of those noble com-
rades who gave their lives in the great cause, hoping that its pages
will assist in handing down to posterity the memory of their glorious
life and still more glorious death. To those who have returned we
wish the happiness and prosperity they deserve after the experiences
in the Great War, and the hope is expressed that the comradeship
of active service will continue in civil life; that the experiences in
the 7th Field Artillery Brigade will better fit them for playing the
part of true men in upholding, in this country, the principles for
which they fought abroad.

THE HUMOUR OF IT
In most of the incidents .of everyday life runs a vein of humour.
It is found to a more or less degree in every individual, and asserts itself
at most unexpected times and in most surprising places, quite irrespective
of circumstances. It knows no barriers. Despite popular theory Scotsmen
pre not exemptT and traces have been known to percolate even unto the
Serjeants' Mess.
The Intelligence Branch of this paper has tapped sources prolific
with humour, and it is significant that in such localities, good-fellowship
and optimism are dominating qualities.'
The silver lining in the darkest cloud is not always apparent; but
even in q desperate case, it is not to ones advantage to admit it. The
humourous aspect will often afford welcome relief arid make optimism easier.
A large Australian mail arrived. For one gunner there were no letters, and
to add insult to injury, he was detailed for main guard in the ordinary
weather, viz. driving sleet, bitter cold and S inches of mud. Saturated
from undershirt to breakfast-time, seated in a drenched bell tent, he learn-
ed that his forthcoming leave was cancelled. Unperturbed by such adversity-
he consoled himself v/ith the fact that "the first 10 years of this Army will
be the worst".
We contrast this v/ith a man who is seemingly weighed with all the
woes and worries of a weary world, whose disposition is-no'acquisition to his
job or ornament to his environment. Create a spark of humour, and make that
sordid sage of stunted vision smile.' If tired of life and sick of the whole
affair,. so afflicted with ennui that humour will not cure, we suggest a visit
to the D-A-C. where they juggle live ammunition. If he stands sufficiently
close to a few cases as they hit the ground after a .drop of 50 ft. or so,
without being seized with the value of life, his case is hopeless.
A little nonsense now and then serves to lift one above dull monot-
ony. . it does not subvert stern duty, but is rather a system of recoil whion
alleviates the strain of the daily round and common task, dismisses dullness
and despondency, and promotes that buoyancy of spirit which has made the
British soldier what he is - cheerful tenacious, and unconquerable.
OUR COMFORTS FUND
We chuckled with glee as we
opened the Xmas parcels from the
-th F. A. B. Comforts Fund.
The contents of these and
subsequent consignments, were a
revelation of the kind thoughts
of our y/ell-wishers who have
given their time and labor in
promoting our welfare.
"Excelsior" appears to be their
motto, sound commonsense their

29/12/16. Reveille at 2 A.M. hordes fed and fast broken. We, miserable
objects'in a mass of equipment, were man-handled on to wondering horses well
laden guns and wagons, and before daybreak; isolated stragglers (and they
were fe#) witnessed through the falling snow, a procession of overcoats,
"gaspirators," tin hats, haversacks, .full bandoliers, leather jackets', etc.
etc., the occasional glisten of an eye in the darkness or a muffled growl
about confounded gear, being the only indication of htiman presence. A
few remarks (by no means affectionate) about LARKHILL and the Plains were
occasionally audible. Cpl. Patrick's (H.Q.) horse was the exception that
proved the rule, and showed his regard for the mud hill, by making for his
late stables (or elsewhere) at a gallop, taking all equipment except Cpl.
Patrick.
31/12/16. Slept during transit across ditch and woke at 6 a.m. to tell
French post card sellers to go to Holbom. Disembarking here (LE HAVRE) we
collected drivers and horses who had already arrived, got aboard train with
all paraphernalia and steamed out at 1 p.m. '
1/ 1/17. Passed through the French towns of ROUEN, BOULOGNE, CALAIS,
ST OMER, HAZEBROUCK to BAILLEUL. Wheri trains stopped en route it was invar-
iably lined by French children calling for "biski." Several of our boys
attempted conversation with them in French, but the youngsters did not appear
to understand their own language. By the aid of acetylene lamps we emptied
the train at 10 p.m. and during the 10 kilo ride to STRAZEELE a staff man found
that to maintain a centre of gravity while asleep on horseback needs practice.
Throughout the ride the roar of the guns was distinctly audible. Arriving
at the village of STRAZEELE, horses were picketted, watered and fed, and we
retired to the old barn which was to be our habitation. Pigs resented our
intrusion, but the application of boot to bacon proved effective. Horse
lines were in a cultivation paddock, and armed with shovels, we slimily
crawled there three times a day to dig the neddies out for their meals.
We quickly located egg and chip shops, where the French scholars among us
volunteered the information that "Je desire five oofs" meant "I can do five
eggs." Happening to be eating eggs after hours one evening long after the
• 8 o'clock fini" I was saved from the clutches of the M.P's by the mediation
of Madeline. Fortunately W.O. Macartney and-Sgt. Buckle were also there,
and even had I been captured I was not on my own.
g/ 1/17. Signallers and some of the gunners left for ARMENTIERES front
to benefit by a few days initiation by the Tommies. The latter told
terrible tales of the horrors of war. I thought it as well to write home
and to send my money away, but the R.F.A. lads were probably pulling our legs.
16/ 1/17. The Batteries left in sections for their respective positions
at 10 a.m. in a snow storm, which added to other discomforts and continued till
late in the afternoon. Guns were installed after dark and the teams arrived
at wagon lines at midnight, tired drivers turning into bunk at 1 a.m.
18/ l/ 17. Took over definitely from the Tommy Battery which had been
covering our infantry. This day also marked the start of French ice 'works
It was gratifying, after our long training, to be at last assisting to hold

THE FOUR PHASES.
The military experiences of the 7th. may he divided into four phases -
"The Warren," "The Argyllshire," "Larkhill," and "France."
We are now in the' midst of the fourth phase.
The first stage is a pleasant memory. ' "The Warren" training and dis-
cipline were rather "Keystonian" in comparison with later and more serious
affairs. The work was delightful - especially the daily slumber under the
trees at Riverside park. Every evening into town hy the seven to five,
every week end off: what a dream, what a vision of bliss! Presents poured
in on us, sox and cake galore. Let us conjure up some pictures:- "The
Block," "The Corso," "King Street," and in the pictures let us Include
those clanking, dazzling spurs, those beautiful shining boots, and the lads
whistling "So Long Letty" music. Can't you feel all the old delight
again? Can't you feel your pulses tingle? Let us turn over the "Warren"
page; the only dark spots on its happy sheet - are fleas.
The next phase is the boat. Here we had many and novel experiences
during our 63 days on board, and, at times we required to bring to our help
the Australian characteristics of humour and "making the best of things."
We made our own amusements, and deliberately made the most of our opportun-
ities for fun, as those popular members of the crew, "Steve" and "Lamps"
can testify. The Port niggers also afforded us some fun, and as they look-
ed rather cold in their exceedingly brief costumes, we gave them a couple
of quick hot luncheons of peppered pudding. They shrieked a lot of language
afterwards, which presumably consisted of words of gratitude. Our old
friend "Lamps" will go down to fame as the "Greatest Living Exponent of the
Easy Art of Growling." His best known works are:- "The Dope," and "Bully
Beef Again for Dinner." "Lamps" is now the nickname for the chap who thinks
that the war will end in the spring of 1921 and looks-it.
The next phase is in England. This phase includes the serious moulding
and making of the Batteries and or the Brigade. We had our noses to the
grindstone. We hope we acquired some degree of military efficiency.
Unfortunately our camp was pitched in a rather Inaccessible spot, as many
a chap found out to his sorrow, when, after returning from London leave, he
had to "pad the hoof" from Amesbury to the camp, the large amount of money
in his pockets making the walk very laborious. One of the favorite evening
pastimes was a game Introduced by the drivers and called "chaff pinching".
This game required to be played after sunset, and in a particularly dark
part of the forage store. Owing to a defect in his sense of humour, it-was
never played near the sentry. The horses enjoyed their part of this game
Immensely, and would like the game to be Introduced into French stables.
If, however, only for the introduction to our now Intimate friends, Frost,
Ice and Snow, we shall long remember Larkhill.
We are now deep in the fourth phase. We have weathered the worst
winter within the memory of that inveterate Ananias, "The Oldest Inhabitant"
and it has taken from us all hankerings after Polar Expeditions or Picnics
to Lapland. Mud has been a close and lingering friend. Many a time when
in nice, open air horse lines, we felt when sinking through the mud, that we
were taking a short cut home. The three previous phases have led up to
this phase, and in this one we must keep our optimism as handy as our gas
masks. We must preserve our national faculty for making the best of things
and we must remain the same cheery fellows, no matter what the future
holds for us. Also, we must not forget the Ideals that we keep at the back
of our brain, but seldom talk, about the traits and ideals which have already
won Australia fame in this war. We" have entered the arena, a Brigade of
mates ready to act according to our several abilities, staunch to each other,
regardless and defiant of the future, proud of our Brigade, and proud of
that sunny Homeland, where our thoughts are always wandering, way down in
the Southern Ocean. ' S.W.H.

So Eill most gravely said,

DI ? G0 S AILy CHRONICLE by one of the local heroes
The c6th of Jan. has gone for another year, and thoughts fly homeward
as they are ever prone to do. Reminiscences of last year recall the kangaroo
drive at Dingo Flat, when Long Joe's blue cattle dog was ripped up by an old
man, and Thirsty Theo's cart horse beat Ginger Jim's thoroughbred in the race
from' the home paddock slip rails to the bore drain back of the shearing shed.
Anniversary Day in France was a different scene. Instead of the ruddy
summer sunset, the overmantling mist of a dreary winter evening; Instead of
tall gums, the shattered trunks and stumps of a former wood; 'instead of a
waving expanse of long grey grass, a white stretch of uneven territory of
Shell craters partly filled by ice and snow. In spite of all this, however,
we were fortunate in being billetted in evacuated houses at ARMENTIERES with
all the comforts of home such as tables, chairs, stoves and spring mattresses.
Even sideboards, crockery and kitchen utensils were at our disposal, and
as shops were handy we amplified our menu by cooking our own porridge,
cocoa, potato pies, pancakes etc. according to our individual cooking abil-
ities. At the wagon lines the drivers had a home away from home in the huts
That our guns should thus be located in the midst of civilian life seemed
to us most incongruous, but we were yet new in our experience of these
tenacious peasants, and were shortly to see them working their farms heedless
of bursting shells of the enemy on every hand. As we expected, our town
life was too good to last.
ARMENTIERES for PLOEGSTEERT WOODS. It was with great regret that on
15th. March we left where we were and came to where we are. Took over from
the New Zealanders. The Maoijilanders and Aussies are cobbers. The former
call one another "Digger" which in Australianese is "Cobber" and in Tommy
tongue "Chum." "PLUG STREET WOODS" were a relief to the eye, and our lines
being on higher ground than those of the enemy, we were afforded good
observation of his movements, making the new sector much more interesting.
We were interested in a log cabin once occupied by Capt. Bruce Bairnsfather.
On the ends of the logs and on the door are carved the badges of the
numerous regiments which have taken part in the very heavy fighting in this
vicinity since the commencement of thfe war.
On 17th. March news reached us of the revolution in Russia. We can only
hope that the outcome will be an enthusiastic prosecution of the war, and
the establishment of a liberty founded constitution.
The theoretical, if not the actual termination of the winter arrived
at last, and on the night of March 24th. clocks were put on one hour. The
scheme to our mind is economic, and a boon to recreation. After our
experience of last summer in England, we wonder at the antagonism to a
similar measure adopted in Australia.
Here in France we seldom know the date or even the day of the week, but
one day was an exception. Officers picked up unaddressed envelopes to see
IST APRIL before them in large characters, and troops stood to attention in
front of officers who had not demanded their presence.
Fritz beoame active with his heavy artillery, but considering his
expenditure of ammunition, damage was slight and casualties few. Peasants
continued plowing and sowing undeterred by heavy shelling of their
cultivations.
Easter we spent as other days. The weather became much warmer.
Hedges and woods behind the lino showed signs of bursting into leaf, and we
renewed our acquaintance with the lark and cuckoo. Crops began to show
above ground but many were late owing to scarcity of labor and absence of
up-tp-date agricultural methods. (Continued in our next.)
HOBBIES AHP PASTIMES.
As the war drags on and things
become a trifle monotonous (for
some) officers and men alike by
their different and peculiar
dispositions adopt very curious
and questlonable customs as time-
killers. So much data of this
kind stares the management in
the face that we feel it our
bounden duty to dedicate space
each issue to chronicle these
doings:--

A bath is a luxury. A man who olaims a both as o right would expect
sugar in his tea, meat in his stew, or "thank you" from his Sergeant.
Seldom is a man heard to oomplain that he is detailed for a bath out of his
turn.
A march of 4 miles over oobbles ; and the H.C.O. halts his party outside
an old distillery, from which volumes of smoke pour through a tall chimney
stack. Parties of Australians, Canadians, Hew Zealanders and Tommies belong
lug to Artillery, Engineers, A.S.C., A.M.C., and Inf., all wait their turn
That tho baths are well within the range of Fritz's shells troubles them
not at all. The establishment of baths so olose to the trenches 18
typical of the many wonderful provisions that are made for the oomfort and
well being of the troops.
"What are you, Cpl?" queries the doorkeeper*
"Umptyumpth Battery".
"Sow many men?"
"Ten".
The doorkeeper counts the ten men as they pass, but when inside the addit-
ion of sevoral "hoggets® has unaccountably swelled the party to 14. Here an
Orderly, like the almost extinct town-orier, monotonously bellows-"Turn
your tunlo end breeches Inside out and hand them in at the first window for
brushing* Leave your hat, gasmask, lack-knife, boots and other valuables
at the second window. Nothing must be left here as you go out another way",
Scantily clad figures with "valuables" dockets hanging beside identity
disjs, rush along the duckboards to a large steam-clouded room. Here they
transfer remaining garments to their arms, are glanced over by an A.M.C. mar
and enter a race with bins on either side. Casting dirty clothes to left,
they receive clean ones from the right. After pigeon-holing the latter
according to number of docket, over go the troops into a large woodeb vat
of 4ft to sft of hot disinfected water. Like the oooupants of other tubs
in the large room, they flounder about, duok one another, and perform tho
almost impossible feat of holding one foot above water level during soaping
operations. As one by one they clamber out, they present a tempting target
and bearing numerous impressions of the red hand, rush for their shirts.
"Good-oh" a grinning gunner grunts, "tho towel I chucked in was one I
picked up, tho shirt had the tall clipped off for harness cje-aning, and the
othor clobber came from The Warren.

IKE REST TOUR
On Saturday 14th April we withdrew from the firing line for a rest. A
rest in the Army means a change of work, and generally the change is of
the proverbial brick-juggling "variety.
The Brigade assembled at where those who had been with the
guns renewed their acquaintance with morning stables, and also with steak
and chips on top of fried eggs. '• e were on th 3 road early next morning and
glad to be together again: the sane old Brigade, though here and there the
gaps which we noted with a tinge of regret.
Passing through v/e camped for the
night at . As far as the eye could reach, between tho
tall trees on either side of the road, could be seen horses, guns and va/vons.
Next days trek was made less agreeable by hail, rain and snow, but °
towards' evening weather improved. Vfe bivouacked at a small village called
, from which we visited the town of , several kilometers
distant.
On the afternoon of April 18th, we took our saddles off at
and in no time had bought the small village out of biscuits, chocolate, bread
butter and everything eatable. We moved next day to vicinity of
small villages a few kilos away. These villages sit-
uated in a picturesque rural valley, v7here creeks of transparent water ran
through a network of fresh leafed hedges which bordered small farms of newly
sown crops and verdant pasture. On every hand were the quadrangled farm
buildings, with manure dump in centre, in which pigs and poultry rooted and
scratched for their daily sustenance. Ait the rear df one of the buildings
was the Inevitable 10ft trackwheel, along the inner circumference of which
a large sized poodle plodded through his morning work of turning the separ-
ator. Hot; we appreciated the rural tranquility of the beautiful vallev
after the roar of guns and rushing of shcllsi By the side of one of the
surrounding hills, in a distant comer of the valley, rose the tall chimneys
During our 12 days stay in the locality we had one all day turnout
for manoeuvres, but on the whole our duties were not arduous. Some of the
more fortunate troops came by a trip to Boulogne. A general rush was made
for the coast to have a look at Blighty.
On Ist Kay, ne took to the trail, heading towards the firing line.
One of the Battery Staffs, being unable to carry sufficient gear on their
saddles", armed themselves with wire-cutters, picks , shovels, jack-knives,
rope, also cart horse and harness. After twilight, many kilos from camp,
they commandeered a likely looking cart, after surmounting indescribable"
difficulties, such as hedges, dogs, ditches, etc. etc.. Next morn'ing to
their chagrin, the ordinary looking vehicle turned out to be a tip-dray
with gigantic wheels and painted a bright blue - once seen, never to be
forgotten. Black kiwi altered the color, and nothing daunted the advent-
urers got away well in advance of the Battery. The turnout was laughable
in the incongruity of military mode and vehicular antiquity. 30 kilos
distant the Jehus drew rein and joined camp with the Battery. That evening
a platoon of. French cockles, numerous interpreters, police, H.Q.Staff, etc.
arrived. After much jabbering it was compreed that the Froggies weren't
going home without the cart, and the staff then realised that they had
come a "Guttzyr". Damages 40 francs-
Next night v/e bivouacked ne3r - but no leave to look round the
town was granted. Like other French towns we have encountered, it has
the cobbled square and Hotel do Villa in centre, with little other pretence
at design.
We are back at our shooting job again and hoping to see the completion
of it this year.

THE ONE YEAR YOUNG YANDOO
If egoism is at all pardonabls, it is on one's birthday. His Yandoo
came to light on 19th Juno 1916, at sea. Somebody• says we have been at
sea'ever sinCe, but we do hot 'bite'.
The Yandoo s original object was to constitute itself a medium for
the promulgation of news, interchange of humour, and other services pro
bono publico. The "hope was expressed that the paper would serve the
Brigade throughout the voyage, during the period of training, and' in the
fifing line. That hope has been realised.
A further end in view was to establish a record to be of interest in
years to come, a reminder of the varied experienced and happy associations
with the congenial comrades who had the good fortune to be throvm together
ir. this Brigade. We believe that The Yandoo has been instrumental in
promoting comradeship and' esprit de corps, and trust to witness the con-
summation Of its mission in life-long friendships on returning to civil
life.
A third and valued ideal has been to create 'a link with those at home.
We have had the gratification of perusing many appreciative letters from
home folk and friends, and that in itself Is sufficient encouragement to
carry on.
We regret that present strenuous times render it impracticable to
issue regular publications, but with the co-operation of our readers, we
hope, as opportunity offers, to present further chronicles of the. brigade,
for the Brigade.

A FRENCH "COOKIE'S" WEDDING.
During our rest at Bruneriburt some of the boys had the good fortune
to witness the above.
Old Sol was for once ploying the game, and Spring was in the air
(that's din! urn). Before the ancient village church a goodly number of the
lads loitered, and devilry v;as in their midst'. At the appointed time, down
the country road came Henri and his bridq, resplendent in the glory of
their borrowed glad rags, and followed by a bevy of chief mourners, also
arrayed in some of Mrs Wolfe's best misfits. The advance guard, on sight-
ing the Billjims, "got the wind up", and retreated in disorder to a nearby
estaminet in the hopa that the onlookers would soon disperse. The pleas-
antness of the day forbade, however, and the boys hung on- So the party
essayed once more to reach the "knot-tying merchant", who was waiting inside
the Church to do the deed. This time they succeeded, and to their great
astonishment received full military honors from the group in khaki who lined
up at the salute on either side of the pathway.
The bridesmaids, who were evidently professionals at the game, and
wore the regulation skeeter-de-chene with dandelion trimmings over a bodioe
of ninon chiffon) met the procession midway in the "stiff's paddock"
(graveyard) with two saplings' decorated with ribbons and surmounted with
candle's. To these the bride attached two rosettes, and the sapling
carriers about-turned and led the way down the aisle to the footlights.
There being no charge for admission, the Billjims naturally followed
and took up their possies on the flank- The "splicing specialist" in his
nightie, here took charge, and rattled off the bye-laws, which of course
we all compreed? At intervals he slaked his thirst with pulls at the holy
water jug, and his understudy, a nipper of tender years, decked in a scarlet
skirt and hobnailed boots, rang a bell. At this all the "femmes" dived
down their stockings (which greatly agitated Billjlm) and the Bridesmaids
did the rest with the plates, not forgetting the happy couple. Again the
bell went, so the plate juggling came for an encore, and the troops got
stung. A third time the bell rang, but Cpl. Russell saved the situation,
by asking the kid if he had any muffins to sell. Whilst gathering in the
gate-money the bridesmaids were glad-eyed muchly.
The wedding ceremony lasted the best part of on hour, during which
time much cold water was sprinkled around. As the party left the Church,
they were greeted with three hearty cheers from the boys, who again lined
up at the gate. The cookie grinned, the brida grinned -we all grinned.

A LITTLE CHAT - A Tale of
High Life.
01 When you're tired, and full of sleep
And long to sink in slumber-deep;
Remove your tunic, p'raps your "strides"
And wrap your blanket roupd your sides.
'Tis then,, my boys, they set to work,
And ne'er a 'chat' was born to shirk;
They seek all ticklish spots of skin;
And irritate from toe to chin.
* »
They creep, by ones, around your baok,
They dream they're on a cycling track;
A crawler stops to kiss and woe -
You quake and stadder, through and through.
•» 'f
The hours go by; you only doze;.
You seeci engulfed in all the woes
Of all mankind; you scratch and.pitoh,
And beg a pal to rub .you.'re itch-
« h •';(
Unrested, dull,. Morn comes at last-
You're thankfui that the dark- is.-past;
Then slipk away Where all is stili,
Unrobe yourself and start to kill-
ft l»
You' search you're fctmA'c, -pants and sh'irt,
And marvel that such speCks oan hurt;
Determined-like, you search.yo.u're h'at>
And, shiv'ring, chase the wily chat.
it* !'/ it*
A knavish chap observes you 'starl-.',
And sneaks along to have a lark;
And fellows laugh 'That's not a dud'
And o'er your back explodes the mud!
<:• n it
You turn and smile a sickly smile,
Yet keep on 'searchln' all the while;
With nettles armed-, some 'creatures'rush
And stain your skin a crimson blush!
« it
Some c.reosole you then purloadn,
And wash each, se.am and shelt'ring join;
At last 1 , you cry,. 'They're done! By gad! •
But nigh.tf.al comes - 'life's' just as bad.
J t it,.
Alas! from chats you're never free -
They cling like Fate or Destiny;
But Peace and- Change will come some day -
And jolly soon, wo hope and-pray.- S.W.H.

BILLJIM AND POLITICS
The association of the above names is quite inappropriate because
politics are quite beneath the concern of the average Billjim- He knows
little about them, and, as he will picturesquely tell you, he cares
infinitely less. He judges broadly of Politics and Politicians. He
thinks banquets and Self Interest are not nearly as worthy as Sacrifice
and Honesty^
Billjim is faced with elemental, things now, such as, for instance:
"What's for dinner?" "Are you chatty yet?"; "Swop you two little 'uns for
a big "un"; "Is it an outer or an inner?"; "Got the wind up?"; "Archies
stilf at it-", "Hoy; many letters did. you get?" "Poor old Dick got skittled'.'
"Got any Kiwi?", "When's pay-day?", "How is it for five francs?", "Are you
set?", "Wish I was a Gunner", "Wish I was a bloomin' Driver", "Damn bully
beef", "That's a dud". These are questions and remarks relating to things
that really matter. They indicate the boundaries of our lives and thoughts
They are more impprtant than "Who wj.ll I vote for?" or "Who y/cm?".
Politics are now quite foreign to us - as much outside our lives as aspar-
agus, kidneys on toast, whiskey-and-soda, back-answering or flirting.
"Who got in?" concerns us hardly at ,all. What matter to us if
they pass Daylight Saving Bills and immediately repeal them.7 Such things
cannot affect either Australia or the "dYiration" - therefore ?re dismiss them
What matter if the States are disappointed in their loans? The word "Loan"
makes us shudder a little, because "Billjim" is nothing if not self-reliant.
We also know that Australia is the best place on earth; the most prbmising
both of men and products: so, surely, we argue, they can "keep going" with-
out continually pawning, cap in hand, their country's future.
But though v,e are not concerned one iota about Party or Politics,
wo are concerned, to the heart, about Australia. Australia is cur Idol end
our Ideal. We left it beoauso v;e loved it; and we left it, confident that
those who were precluded from joining'the-forces would strive, and maybe
suffer, for, and in the interests of Australia. They - the nation's
trustees - would be loyal; they would be true; they would be "dlnkum"
trustees. That is all v;e'still ask. That is all that concerns Billj in.
"Party" and "Platform" are but words to us. There should be but
one end to all parties, all'platforms,-- Australia. If he lives through
it all, Billjim is going back to Australia to take up again his gapped life,
and he requires to know that Australia will be none the worse for his
absence. "Red Flags" and "Class Legislation" are outside Billjims area -
and he doesn't wish to understand them. He wants to know one thing: is
Australia - the big Australia - the sole thought of those in command? That
is the one question we ask the politician, irrespective of party. Billjim
still grasps the plough of war and there is no time for turning back or
hesitancy
Besides, Billjim is awfully busy. He is also very determined to
finish well- his present job. But, some day, when dreams come true, he v;ill
go back to the Land of Wattle and 3olden Beaches, ar.d Billj im, who is sac -
rificing his yeabs, some prospects, and, occasionally, his life; will seek
out the Politician, the Keeper of the Vineyard, and casually ask "How's
things?". - 3.W.H.

Dear Egbert,-
Your letter of January 12th only reached me to-day, Ist August -
over 6 months In transit- lam sure you must have carelessly carried it
in your pocket for a long while, as the Officers never take more than 3
months to tensor letters.
I am sick of writing, writing, writing, and only getting an
answer every 6 months, and won't do it any longer. A New Zealand hoy
writes to me 3 times every week and also sends postcards and whiz-bangs,
So you need not bother calling when you get your Blighty leave, as I won't
be "at home".
My New Zealand friend was on the next sector to your unit, and
I asked him if you were really too busy to write. He says you fill in
most of your time "chatting". If you can't knock off your little chats
to write to me, I do not wish to hear from you.
Your former friend,
VIOLET
Egbert has sent us the -above letter asking our advice as to his
b?st course of action. Will readers kindly forward suggestions as to
how his troubles can be adjusted. We hope the case of Dvr. S. D's 21

Russian Rejroiuli2.n_The welcome news reaches us that the Russians
are again attacking on the Eastern front. These reports, sparse and
indefinite, are intermingled with hints of political unrest and mutiny in
■certain Russian Regiments. The new democracy is confronted with enormous
problems, but we do not think that the lovers of freedom, who gave their
oountry self-government, will quit in a'struggle for the world's emancip-
ation.
Ee&th £f_G£n£r&l_P2lae2 General Holmes met his death while
escorting Hon. W. A. Holman, Premier of N.S.W. on a tour of inspection In
our part of the line.
Xh£ KlJlg* On 4th July we lined the roadway adjacent to the
Wagon Lines and saw the King go by at a range of 59.37 inches. He was
followed by the Prince of Wales looking fresh and alert. Conspicuous In
the Royal Party, arrayed in top hat and frock coat, was Hon. W. A. Holman
who', we understand, came to Europe for the purpose of interviewing Uncle
rke. Nothing doing in Blighty, we surmise, so the Hon. Bill proposes
passing round the hat among the troops in France. The old war-worn phrase
"Australian beaucoup money" has evidently been wafted to his ears. We
.waited in vain to see his top hat and clavf hammer ooat in the trenches.
£hflll Uoie_C&uQtEy. After a few days the Brigade again went
into aotlon, this time in a position which'was formerly enemy trenches.
The landscape here Is a perfect network of shell holes. Approaching the
former battle field, we notice ahead a stretch of devastated country of
shell holes, mine oraters, smashed dugouts, and anihilated woods. In the
foreground is a strip of green grass, daisies, poppies and other wild
flowers - the former site of No Man's Land. The soene behind is a contrast
Flourishing woods, verdant pastures, and red-roofed farm buildings enable
us to comprehend what this oountry was like before the invasion by the
Boohe. Relios of the battlefield lie everywhere, among which are enemy
rifles and ammunition which are useful for miniature rifle ranges in
llesure moments. Little wooden crosses denote the last resting place
of those who "died that the nation might live".
Fritz dugouts are constructed of reinforced concrete about 4ft
in tnickness, and even they may sometimes be seen hurled out of position
by the heavy shells from our guns. Heaps of briok, and an occasional
cabbage or turnip are all that remain of a former farm. In this locality
we are enabled for the first time to note the results of our own fire.
The enormity of the shell holes made by our heavy shells, the vast number
of 18 pdr casings, the complete destruction of enemy trenohes and strong
points, show beyond doubt the truth of a German officer's words "To know
what a bombardment is really like, it is tfecessary to be on our side of
the line".
Eiii£i£ n This took place on 22ttd July. In the
list of prize winners our Brigade was well represented. Riding along a
road between Wagon Lines and the Battery, we noticed a smiling face sur-
mounting the hill ahead. "Well doneJ" was the response to our salute.
It was the C.0., Col. Macartney.

ONCE MORE INTO THE BREACH
. After returning from the rest tour, the respective batteries
took up positions in the neighbourhood of steenwerk. . It was early
in May, and the raspberry, strawberry and gooseberry bushes adjacent to
the deserted famns in rear of our trenches, showed signs of an abundance
of fruit later in the season. Being ahead of time, however, we made the
bast of rhubarb as on adjunct to our rations.
Anniversary of Leaving Sydney. On May 11th, we saw the Harbour
scene on the day or our departure, over again. The ribbons, the ferry
boats and Th® Heads were as vividly before us as though we saw them In
reality instead of in imagination. Circumstances necessitated the indef-
inite postponement of celebrations of the Ist Anniversary of our service
abroed.
Iha JlPgoa LiQea were located within reasonable walking distance
ofßac-sur-Kor.near which is a canal. The latter was taken over for many
miles of its course, by Australiansfor swimming purposes. The overarm
stroke excited general wonder and admiration among local inhabitants.
"Australian plenty swim" they said.
EiC.kE2UAxsE.ua,. Printed in large characters on a gate in Dinkum
Avenue, where our wagon lines were situated, is the familiar sign, "14,000
miles to Griffiths Bros, for Tea, Coffee and Cocoa". Where was it we saw
something similar before? On the North Shore Line? From the Melbourne
Express? Or was it up Newcastle way?
2h£ £,tuni A oduple of weeks elapse and the guns of the
whole Brigade point ominously at the enemy from the vicinity of
. Something big is doing. Ammunition comes forward in unlimited
supplies, and facilities for transport are being perfected. The roar of
gunfire daily increases in intensity; tanks and heavy artillery continue
to arrive. The enemy retalliates with his artillery, and from time to
time tremendous explosions indicate that he has located one of our ammun-
ition dumps. In spite of our suffering from enemy field guns, heavies,
shbaphel and 'gas, it is obvious that Fritz is subjected to a bombardment
infinitely more terrible. One night in particular will ever live in the
memory of those engaged in this great attack. For 9 hours on this night
we wore gasmasks with sallver accumulating within and the band pressing
almost unbearably on the forehead. The gas on this night. (3rd June)
constituted an experience which tried the patience and nerves more than
eny other which has yet fallen to our lot.
Still we were ready for the Boche. Throughout the few days
prior to the advance each man was confident and expectant. In the early
hours of June 7th, tremendous explosions intimated that the mines had gone
up, and the Infantry went over the top protected by a barrage which they
afterwards described as a wall of steel. In fact, they said they could
lean up against it. In a, much shorter space of time than had been allowed
the important ridge where once stood the towns of I.lesslnes and V/ytschaete
was in our hands, and our Infantry continued to advance taking objective
after objective, until the whole plan of operation had been successfully
executed.
Great was the victory, but it had demanded of us tremendous
sacrifices in the loss of comrades who willingly laid down their lives for
the beloved homeland, and in the great cause for the world's emancipation.
That they have not died in vain, we are resolved. Great though our loss
may be, it is for the bereaved at home that the intensity of our feeling,
and our unspoken sympathy go.
We came out of the line on 26-6-17, and learned that a general
parade of the Division had been ordered for the following day for the purpose
of inspection by Major General Monash.
tl a iPZ General. JJonajsh congratulated our Divisional Artillery on
the wonderfully creditable turnout that afternoon, taking into consideration
the little time for preparation and the strenuous times just past. He
commended them for the efficient manner in which they had played their
part in the important Messines attack- In this operation the standard of
Officers and men was shown to be of the highest- The Trench Mortars, he
said, had destroyed barbed wire through which the Infantry could not other-
wise have passed; the 18 pdss had put up a barrage whioh was a veritable
fence of steel. The howitzers had wrought havor on enemy defences of the
second line.
The work of the Artillery as an arm of the service came less in
the lime light than that of the Infantry. The Division was proud of its
Artillery, and the Division itself was of the highest standard.
In the words of an eminent Artillery Commander in this country, "The
highest compliment that can b9 paid any Artillery, is the praise of its

THE LIAR
I'm just an "OSSY"soldier,
As happy as a King;
Because I've got all comforts,
And lack not anything.
r-
I like the dear old Army,
It's discipline and ways;
And I air. being treated,
Beyond all human praise.
I like the breath of winter,
It makes one feel so fit;
I like all Sergeants Major,
Their chivalry and wit.
a "■
I like the falling snowflakes,
On trees they look so nice;
Quite pleasant is the frost bite,
And beautiful the ice.
I like H.E.and Shrapnel,
I think they sound so sweet;
Especially when they droppeth,
Just underneath ones feet.
I like my old Gas Helmet,
It fits me toa T;
I can breathe quite freely in it,
And perfectly can see.
I like all kinds of duties,
I rush each chance for guard;
I never find it irksome,
And never find it hard.
■ y t f- v-
I like my turn at Picqiiet,
It's quite a little treat;
Ecstatic in the winter,
With wet and frozen feet.
I like all brands of "Bully",
I'm very fond of stew;
McConachies delightful,
My biscuits I can chew.
I like the little Insects,
That o'er my body roam;
They keep my mind from thinking,
Of all my cares at home.
I like the French Farmhouses,
Because they are so clean;
I like the pleasant people,
And never find them mean.
In short I love the Army,
And peace I'll sadly taks'
And when I leave the- Army,
My heart will surely break.
Perhaps I'd better tell you,
That in my early youth,
A clumsy nursemaid dropped HIS.
And broke my bump of truth.

dear Causlr Marjorie,
I am very sorry to tell you that the "fiver" Aunt
Sent me has been blown up with my tunic. Tell Aunt not to bother to send
any more. However, if she insists, tell her I am thinking of Blighty leave
-and as a lot goes a little way" there. She had better please make it
a "tenner".
Since writing you last, we "pulled out" from Wessines on 31st Aug.
at first we did not like Messines, but, by comparison with later
experiences, it was not too bad. 'While in aotion at Messines, the "Order of
iHard-Thinking Wagon Liners"(of which I ar a member) had some anxious days.
Fritz oeoasionally sent some over and snoilt the usual slumbering serenity
of the Wagon Lines.
On the Ist Sept. we started out for the muoh-looked-for rest. We
stayed at Staples the first night; the second night, we "lobbed at" our
destination, Merck-St-Levien, south of St Oner, a very pretty little villag
'with plenty of historic associations, and a very quaint stone Churoh
■penohed on a high hill overbooking the village and the surrounding country.
Fruit trees were plentiful and we helped ourselves. Altho' Autumn was in
the air, we had many swims in the fine little .brook, running through the
orchards. The days were sunny, but the leaves were beginning to turn
golden, and the Autumn breezes whirled them, one by one,to the ground.
'We were expecting to have a very long rest; but, dear, we came suoh an
awful "Gutzer". (Gutzer is a word taken from A-ustralslatlguagee meaning a
set-back and is accordingly much used by we "Ossies"). After being four
days out, we were suddenly told to go baok Into action. It is awful,
-dear, to be so indispensable.
The return march occupied three davs. we left Merok-St-Levlen on the
morning of the 7th Sent. First stop plechln, the second Morhecque, and
the last night we stopped at Dlokebusch. The oonoentration of Wagon Lines
and Camns told us that something was doing. We made ourselves as oom-
fortable as a fen canvas coverings would allow; but the following morning
brought us a terrible blow - a blow which by it's very suddenness sent
the Brigade reeling* Whilst the lads of the 26th Battery were grouped
together at breakfast, a high velooity shell burst In their midst. It
was an unlucky shot (for usj, and was the only one of a series that did
any damage; but It did terrible wofck, and by it we lost many old mates
who had been with us all the time, and many others were wounded.
That night our guns and their orews went into action in front of
Zlllebeke Lake, The proximity of the "possv" to the Menln Road made it
an attraction for old Fritz, to fling his "Ironmongery" about. Needless
to say the Batteries got more than their share, particularly the 25th Bty,
After having given Fritz a good "kick in the ribs", we received orders
cm the 21st Sept. to advance and take up apposition on westhoek Ridge, in
front of Chateau Wbod. Hare the Batteries were under observation
from enemy balloons and suffered accordingly from concentration of fire;
but the determination of the lads was more than what old Fritz had
rookoned on And still the gundsoontlnued to fire, in spite of being put
on their baoks more than once.
Another advanced "possy" to the north, this time on priezenburg
Ridge near St Julian, which we occupied on 30th Sept,
A week later, we again advanced, this tire to Borry Farm, which
afforded the gunners their first opportunity to use the Telescopic sight
t>y laying direct on Passchendaele Church as their Zero Point.
However, the positions occupied by the Brigade were very unfortunate.
Unfortunate as it seems, our casualties would have been greater had it
not been for Fritz's thoughtfulness in providing us with his substantial
"Pill Boxbs" to live in.
For a sample of the vandalism, of the Hun, we were astounded at the
Sight of Ypres. Ypres? - Well, hardly fpres, for l all that remains are heaps
•of brloks indicating that houses - homes onoe stood there. The country
between Ypres and the Ridges (for the battles were fought for possession
of the Ridges) was the most desolate, hellish scene, the human imagination
oan picture. Imagine a large plain, so pitted with shell holes, that the
holes are all joined together and filled with muddy water, all the visible
land, mud, q shell-torn tree here and there, mud-covered Tanks dotting the
plain; and haunting it all, the Ghost of Death.
The road over which the traffic passed, and ammunltionwas carried
was a river of mud and slush, on either side in the shell holes lay horses
saddles, limbers, and G.S,Wagons.
But I won't go oh Marjorie. It was an unlucky "possy" for this
Brigade, but the mates who have gone - that is what saddens the chaps.
As for their endurance and pluck - well Marjorie, like you, they were


My
Australians, and we are proud to be Australians.

It has been decided to create
the above conest upon the solici-
tation of some of the older members
of the Brigade. This inspiration
is du9 no doubt to their keenness
for humour, and we agree with them
that the possibility for humour in
such a contest is unlimited. The
difficulties and pitfalls that con-
tinually confront the drivers arc
very numerous, but perhaps their
greatest night-mare is the ditches
that are always in company with the
roads in Northern France and Bel-
gium. Shell-hole country also
presents many obstacles; clearing
°f gate-posts and ramps across
ditches also gets a bit of lime-
light in the daily routine of a
driver's many duties. In a great
many of these- shall we call them
accidents?- the driver is to blame
as much as the horse.

splendid horsemen, but we also

Uy daer Valerie,
Here goes for that promised letter. In spite of the many
"furphles" which you get in Australia, PEACE has NOT teen declared, at
least not in our vicinity. Of course Russia has thrown in the towel
hut that only evens things up a hit. You know we want to spin this
war out another few years yet, and it would not do to dlsoourage old
Fritz too much. We troops would feel so lonely without the whiz of
the shells and the lovely mudJ I say Val dear, aren't we fortunate
to he away from such places as Sydney and Melbourne where you have
those heastly dust storms?
Now I must tell you all about our doings. I have Just
returned from Blighty leave - of oourse you ere not interested in what
I did there. After going through a partioular brand of Hades at Ypres,
we pulled out on 22nd. Oct* and proceeded to our wagon lines, which were
situated within oooee of the delapldated little village of Vlamertinghe.
Speaking of this place reminds me that Fritz had the habit of visiting
us eaoh night with his "birds" and disturbing our rest by dropping
"eggs." And you can take it from me those birds were never "broody."
On 23rd. Oot. the 7th. Brigade got up early and set out for
fresh fields and pastures new. It happened to be a very wet and oold
day, and the Comforts Fund woollens worked overtime. We travelled
via Diokebusch, Kemmel Hill and Neuve Eglise to Ravelsburg, and settled
down near by. We were only left in peace for a few days however, but
during that time we pulled ourselves together a good deal. Wounds and
sickness had thinned our ranks to an alarming degree whilst at Ypres,
Footle matches were played and on half-holidays the troops were granted
leave. Everybody headed for Ballleul, there to have a good feed of
eggs and ohlps and to look at the post-oard shops. My word Val, these
Froggles nrlnt some daring post-oards!
On the evening of Oth. Nov; without any warning we were
told to be ready lo go Into action at daybreak the following morning.
So you see poor old 7th. came another "Gutzer. * Needless to say we
didn't have breakfast in bed that day. The Batteries took up positions
round about dear old "Plug St." (Ploegsteert Is the proper name you
know,) and the Le Bizet area -and quite near the "possies" we oooupled
for that bally MeSslnes stunt where we got a double issue of Hun gas
last June. Our wagon lines roved in the direction of Steenwerok the
following day, llere we stayed till about 20th. Deo. generally
worrying Fritz, and doing our best to sidestop his return compliments.
The Divvy football comp. was played during this period behind the line.
Our Brigade was represented by the 26th» Battery who managed to pull
off the final by defeating the D.A.C. and so getting a silver oup which
was presented by Brig. General Grlmwade. The scores were 23 to nil.
For the Brigade Competition which the same Battery won, Lt. Colonel
Macartney presented another cup.
On 20th» Dec, we pulled out but went into action again
Immediately. I bet you couldn't guess where! In Armentleres of all
places. This was rather a ooinoidenoe because almost twelve months
ago we were In this same town. It is not the same Armentleres now.
The Huns have strafed lt unmercifully and few undamaged houses remain.
All the civies have cleared out - just put the mat Inside and slammed
the door.
Christmas and New Year were spent in action here, but really,
we couldn't growl. The season was typical of France, snow all day and
a bit on the cool side. Plenty of provender hod been secured, suoh as
sucking pigs and poultry. Champagne being very cheap in this oountry
a goodly stock was obtained, and that, together with some "borrowed"
red and white wines from the oellars in Armentleres which people had
forgotten to lock up, kept us merry and bright. In addition each man
was issued with a £lb. allowance of plum duff. Both sides of the
line were pretty quiet that day, evidently our enemies were celebrating
too. Early in the New Year we pulled out of action for a little while.
That Is all I can tell you this time. Oh! I forgot to mention that our
Christmas parcel mall did not reach us till quite rooently. Still,
better late, than never. I got suoh a beauty from you.
Now I think I"ll go over to the Y. Emma for a oup of tea.
Did you know the 7tb. has a Y.M.C.A. now? Rather! We have got a
"gohanno" too and at night the boys give lt glp.
Well old pal, au revoir,
Yours till the mud dries up, maCHONOCHIE.

fc-loiv few are the troops at some stage of the Campaign have not wished for
a, "Blighty". For the relief from nerve strain, for the rest from the
monotony, of the sight of the ever-present khaki, for the companionship
of British civilians, for the food, the recreative gaiety of life in _
Blighty. It nay he when the shells are raining thlokest, when Ellljlm
has oeased to duck, when he is in that grl», dogged and pugnacious mood,
which is dangerous to the Hun who comes his way>
Our Brigade well remembers the hlow it received so unexpectedly at
Dickehusoh on 11th Sept., when a shell (a lucky one from Fritz 3 stsnd-
point) accounted for 43 casualties. It descended among the 26th Battery
at breakfast time. All hands were on the spot as the guns had. not gone
into action in the new position. Officers and men alike rallied round
their comrades, and in spite of the continued shelling, rendered first
aid, attended to eveby want, and, in every way sought to help those who
wer. unable to help themselves. It was a splendid example of comradeship,
of the unity between Officers and men, "of that spirit of combination,
which was responsible for the prevailing good-fellowship, and so instru-
mental in the Brigade's success asa fighting foroe. In a very short space
of tine the wounded were removed to the Dressing Station, thence to the
Casualty Clearing Statlor), whore system and thoroughness are paramount
qualities. It Is the C.CiS. which handles the great inrush of more or
loss seriously wounded when a stunt is in progress. The Doctors and
Nurses with the XF.ay operating and other equipment are magnificent. It
Is here that we went "over the top", or in other words, saw the Merchant
of Venice at "the Theatre when Shylock gets his pound of flesh.
The first sensation after Coming out of the anaesthetic is an appre-
ciation of the comfortable bed. How many long months Is it since We were
between sheets? A Battery cohher is in the neatt bed, also just been
* over the top". "How are you Harry?" "Tres Bon. Do me for the
duration!" "My oath. A man who wants more than this would ask
for flowers on his grave or portholes in his coffin"!
Then comes the Nurse J a real dinkum civilised English girl. Bon
Jour Ma'mselle. Avez-vous"—-We suddenly remember and look sheepish.
"How are you feeling now"? And she smiles. "A drink"? "Most certainly".
•Port wine, champagne , stout or hot milk?" First we think it's"kid-stakes
but "jerry" that it's dinkum and say "Cold water".
A few days pass, our temperature drops to normal and we join the
convoy. The stretcher-oases are placed in a long row awaiting the ambu-
lances to take them to the station. Aboard the train and we are between
the sheets again. A sleeping berth "buckshee". Last one was between
Sydney and Melbourne and cost ten bob.
j Next we find ourselves at a General Hospital on the coast# We are
puzzled at the Nurses arrayed in white from Shoes and stockings upward
with the exception of a little red cross on the chapeau. The young Doctor
wearing a silver har on each shoulder, a hat like the Waorilanders ana
U.S.A. on his collar, comes in sasuallysmoklng a pipe, and sits on the bed
So we are in an Amerloan Hospital. An Orderly comes to the bedside. Say
Pard. Have you seen Any cf the States Chaps up in the line? You re an
Australian eh? A guy in the ward over the road comes from Australia too.
I changed him out of his blues Into a Yankee uniform and we had a night
in the town. Champagne? 1 guess we did?"
Sammy has been Charged with opening conversation by I guess we ve
come to finish thlswar you started three years ago". He have not met that
Sammy. From our experience he is keen, free, of fine physique and rodestli:
realizes the gravity of his task. The young Doctor, eager to glean know-
ledge from any source, joined in the conversation, remarking:- You chaps
who have been there know. One can't get much from the papers!"
A word for the Australian Red Cross. In each of the various Hos-
pitals we have been in, the Australian Red Cross has been ably represented
Even the Tommy Hospital had a Sister specially appointed to issue Red
Cross gifts to Australian patients. Every conoeivable article for the
comfort and convenience of the troops is available for the asking.
After the elapse of several days we are once more in a convoy. The
train pulls up'right alongside the boat. We are somewhat chagrined to
note that the stretcher-bearers are German prisoners. When several cases
are placed aboard the boat without rough handling or being drooped into
the spa our f'j&rs are allayed. The" little Hospital Ship makes good head-
way across the Channel and in little over an hour, we sight the renowned
white cliffs of Dover. In no time we are in England, travelling in an
excellently fitted Hospital Train, among' Englith orchards, fields, hedges
and above all, English people.


(Blighty Craok Contd.)
We wonder where we are going. It may be the V.A.D.Hospital where
Nurses will pin flowers in -our"oozrts, hold our hands and press our clothes
bping us lemon drinks and cake. It may be the British Military (capital
M for Military) Hospital, where we will be at attention at the approaeh
of a berlbbonod Matron and spend our days in perpetual perturbation lest
wa should unwittingly get wrinkles in the quilt-. -It may be an "Aussie"
Hospital where the Sisters will greet us with "How's this boy? Are you
a Gum-suokar, Crow-eater, Sand-groper or Bananalander? How's our 'Arbour?
The same Sisters will hepp us to get our leave, may be, to get back
to Australia. But who knows? (E.H.)

Marjorle Dear, .THE CHEVALS* CHATEAU. 50th June 1910
Here we are again! This time my letter Is being written far from
the scenes of last year's strenuous doings. V7e are now on the famous
River Somme and this is how we got there. You will probably remember
that our Christmas was spent strafing the Hun on the Armentieres Sectors.
On Jan Gth the 7th pulled out and took up lines in the Merris-Steenje
arep. Here we had rotten weather,(snow, blizzards and floods), and it WAS
cold. The Brigade remained here until Jan 30th and then went back to the
line at Ploegsteert and Le Bizet. We took part in a number of raids, and
generally harassed and sniped old Fritz until 11th March. The weather
during this period was very tricky, snow, frosts, rain, fog and mud all
doing their best to keep up Flanders' Winter reputation. Ask our Drivers
how they enjoyed packing "Ammo" to the guns three nights "in concussion"
per week!. She was no bon, believe moi!
Our next move was to Vleux-Berquin via Ballleul. We Just got nicely
settled there with good weather and the prosnect of some sports when the
Brigade oame a sudden "crash". On the afternoon of March 23rfl an order
came through for us to paok up "at the toot" and get on the road. Two
hours was the time allowed and we did it, but gee the troops had to get a
wriggle on. Owing to lack of transport a few tons of surplus gear had to
be left to the tender mercies of the villagers. That night we oarped near
Morbecque, Hun planes stirred up the locality somewhat with their honhs,
but none fell dangerously close to our lines.
The following morning after saying goodbye to our spore blanket and
kitbags we started on the march South. Our destination we did not know
but guessed our objective would be the advancing Huns. For five days we
journeyed on, each night picquetlng the horses and finding shelter for
ourselves in barns and outhouses. On the morning of the seoond day our
scurrulous rag the "Yandoo" came a "gutzer". The printing outfit had to
he dumped and also the Battery Canteens. All "buckshee" carts, spare
harness and other equipment had to be loft behind. Never before had the
7th Brigade travelled so "light".
The furtner South we went, the more congested became the roads with
traffic and troops. Fortunately the weather held fine. Space does not
allow for a detailed account of the long march, but the chief towns and
villages through which we passed were Morbecque, Aire, Lambres, Pemes-en
Aitois, Valhoun, St Pol, Prevent, Doullens, Pas en Artois, Puohvlllers
and Behenoourt. As the column neared Doullens strange sights met our
Remnants of Regiments, all toll-worn and dishevelled, Batteries, gunless
and practically horseless, straggled by. Often we heard this warning from
the retreating troops:- "Look out Chum, Jerry's comln'." But it was not
until another 24 hours "marching had been done that we aotually did meet
Jerry. That was on the night of March 27th. As we neared the line,
streams of refugees kept passing, all laden with household goods or
driving great farm carts stacked high with furniture, fodder and the
family, and with the farm-yard roped to the tail-board.
Our guns went into action near the village of Helllynnear the junc-
tion of the Somme and Ancre Rivers, It was there that we found Fritz.
The days following found the Brigade "bogging in" for all it was worth.
Of course there were casualties and we found the style of warfare vastly
different to that we had been accustomed to in Flanders. For instance,,
there were no gun-pits, dugouts, or trenches, and the guns stood out in
the open ana were camouflaged when not In action. At times the layers
used open sights. Soon the troops discovered that the gun possies weie
not the healthiest places to linger at after a shoot. Fritz had the
"mad woman" habit with his Artillery, so it was necessary for the crews
to scuttle for cover immediately a shoot was finished. Still there were
some compensations. The country instead of being flat and uninteresting
and ohurned up by the continuous shell-fire, as was Flanders, was beau-
tifully fresh and green, and mostly under cultivation. The gently rolling
landscape was dotted with thick woods, and in the valleys nestled villages
of red-tiled and thatched-roofed cottages. The shell-holes were few and
far between (at first). When it rained we forgot the beauty of nature.
Our homes were holes cut out of the earth with a sheet of iron or canvas
overhead to keep out the elements, (the elements generally won). When
it rained the odds were that the sides of your burrow would collapse and
you would be washed out. Once wet you remained so until a fine day chose
to come along. The towns and hamlets close to the line had all been
hurriedly evacuated by the civilians, so great was their haste that many
had not time to collect the cov:s and chickens. However, diggers collected
them instead, and for some time the oamp cookhouses were filled with


savoury odours. Pigs, calves, fowls and tame rabbits were rm down or
show down and in the cellars of old houses were found wlrtes ond cham-
pagnes, but Fritz seemed to have a special spite on these localities
and sometimes much Ironmongery had to be dodged before one could get at
the goods.
This land of plenty was soon stripped of its riches and the troops
had to take In thoir b3lts and exist on Army rations again.
On April Ist the 7th suffered a great loss in the deaths of Liaut-
Oolonel W. Churchus, Capt. Greenshields and Lieut..Radford, all of whom
were Killed by one shell which burst In the Officers' Quarters at N H<?illy.
Major James now became Acting C.O. of the Brigade. About this time there
was unusual aerial activity. It Was not an uncommon sight to see a score
of planes "boxing on". The 21st April saw the downfall of the crack Ger-
man Aviator, Capt. Baron Von Richthofen. His machine was forced to a
low altitude by British fliers and then accounted for by an Australian
Maqhine-Gunner from the ground. The plane crashed not very-far .from some
of our guns. Every night bombing raids took,plaoe by hostile raiders and
heavy oasualties were oaused among the horses and somo of the men alsd' fell
victims to the bombs.
On April 4th the enemy commenced a very heavy bombardment on our
front line and back areas, following It up v/ith an Infantry attack and
succeeded In ocoupylng Harael and Bouzencourt. On account of the Boschs
taking ground it was necessary to switch the guns at right angles to
the usual front and so enfiladed his hard-won positions. Me was driven
out after losing heavily.
The capture of Villars-Bretonneux by the Germans took place on ths
24th April. The same night our Infantry by great daring and initiative
made a silent attaok without the usual Artillery assistance and drove
the enemy out at the point of the bayonet, and, with maohlne-gun fire,
capturing many prisoners in the operation. That day hostile artillery
was very aotive, great quantities of gas shells and high explosives being
'put over". Some of our guns were knocked out and the entire Headquarters
Staff with three or four exceptions was gassed. One of the gas casual-
ties was Major James, and his place was taken by Major Irwin.
Tho 7th Brigade went into reserve soon after the Vlllor-Brotonneux
stunt and the wagon lines moved to Freohenoourt. Some Yank Engineers
were billeted in this village and baseball matches were soon the rage.
Thq Brigade team did very creditably, considering our players were tr.ck-
llrtg the Yank at his Rational game.
On May the 9th the guns went back Into aotlonnln the vicinity of
Braslo near Albert, but were relieved again on the 14th. Next morning
the Brigade wa3 on the "wallaby". After two days travailing we arrived
at our destination which was the village of Coquerel on the Sonne Canal,
Spring was merging into Summer and the weather was fine and warm. The
country through which the Brigade travailed was vary picturesque and
fertile. For miles the road followed the valley of the Somme River,'
Now end again we oame to the swift-running Canal with its many Looks
arid bridges. Rloh young crops of velvety, green grew right tp ..the road-
side.and the fields were divided by luxuriant hawthorn'hedges, and, here
and there woods of tender green cast deep shadows, forming cool glades.
The air was laden with the scent of flowers, the Lilac, ths Elder apd
Acacia all bloomed along the country lanes, and, in the. oottnge gardens.
On the eve of the first day the Brigade occupied wagon lines on the out-
skirts of Bourdon, a'one-horse" village, where-every second house appeared
to be an Estaminet. Tho following morning the journey was continued and
the towns of Fllxeoourt and Long werp passed through en route. The country
gradually became steeper and with the exception of thick woods was all
under cultivation. Coquerol was reached at about three in the afternoon
and after "feed-up" a rush was made to the Canal which.flowed near at
hand. Here the troops enjoyed the luxury of a swim, a pastime wo rarely
had the opportunity to indulge In. The Canal at this point averaged 30
yards in width, and the water was very deep and swift. A tow-path
followed the bank and both sides of the stream were overhung with heavy
filiage. At the lower end of the town the Canal was spanned by a bridge.
The village Itself was. ancient and tumbled down,and the majority of the'
villagers looked as old as the village.. There were a few exceptions
and they were"vory nice too", Ahem.
Now old girlie I must stop - tho Editor wont allow.me any more
space. In my next I shall tell you all about our spell at Coquerel
(voted the best spoil ever) and our subsequent doings in tho line..
Sink one for me at Farmers and accept best love

7th P.A.B. R&-UMIOM CLUB.
The news of the forming of the 7th P.ft.B. re-union Club In Sydney, by
Eric Harding, Harry Stltt and also our esteemed original organiser,
Lt. Col. Pearoe V.D. and other returned pals, is viewed with a great
amount of satisfaction and appreciation, by the Members of the Brigade,
who have shown such comradeship as possessed by the 7th»
However, there is a certain field for controvesy aS to the
best ways and means of making this Club a distinct success. Per instance,
it would hardly do» to have It a permanently situnted affair in the City,
as there are so many members of the 7th, who come from the Never Never
country, and then again, to be considered are the GUKSUCKERS, CROWEATERS,
C-ROPERLANDERS, BANANALAffDERS, not forgetting those from "TATT'S" land.
A better scheme or suggestion would be to have an annual
re-union, say at Easter time, for a period of a month, the Easter Raoes
and Royal Sydney Show would have an added attraction for visitors.
It could be arranged to have a meeting house, for that
period, by the rental of a huge flat or flats, In some central part
of the City, where we oould meet and make appointments any old time.
It would possess great drßwing_ powers, when they knew the
possibility of meeting so many old comrades of fighting d3ys. One oan
imagine the social side, when "Driver'' Reginald do Jossiyn, Bank-
Manager, grips "Gunner" Bill Bdwyang, the Bricklayer'by the hand,
with a hall-fellow, well met spirit, that was so characteristic of
by-gone days, or the change when "Gunner" Bill GrogginS, who owns
half Bananaland, shakes hands with .Captain Pitzhugh who- was
clerking "Avant la Guferre".
Dinners, banquets and theatre parties could bo arranged
and so make this month, a re-union, something to bo looked forward
ta, which would keep ever—green the sterling friendships found
and formed between men , who have fought and suffered hardships,
together, throughout the great world war.

N? A FRITZ'S WEST,
My dearest Effle, 30th SEPT# IP IS#
Onco more an opportunity presents itself, for ire to
continue with little episodes of our doings.
In my last letter I mentioned to you, that we had
pulled out for a rest, to a village called COCQUEREL, and although we
had to carry on with the usual routine, of feeding e-id grooning our
Chevals, each afternoon we devoted to sport. Being right on the river-
bank and the weather gloriously warm, one had only to go down there and
see the boys getting about, even minus the proverbial "figleaf".
Swimming oamivals were soon arranged end proved great
successes. Many laughable incidents oocured: one worth recalling, is
where a couple of the boys stopped in the water, although cold, when
along oame two old French damos, who vera highly amused with their antics,
squatted down on a log, near their olothes. The boys,' French failed to
move them. Then everything got t±ue, the air, as well as the diggers;
then they'cor.pread" and moved at the "tout".
Baseball games were also indulged in with some
Americans, who were camped in the Army Training School close by,
Horseracing was quite the fashion now, as the 3rd Dlv
Artillery held their meeting ESPAYGNE, at which, our Brigade was
fully represented. There were many notable celebrities there and also
a goodly number of Aussie Nurses from the 3rd A.G.H. ABBEVILLE and
W.A.A.C.s. Oneof the ohief features of the day were the Bookies, who
were all dressed up in Civilian and fancy costumes of all colors. It
was necessary that they do this, to denrlve the scene of it's army
aspect. There were Pierrots, Tall hats and Frock coats, "Talkative"
cheok-suits and other quaint rigouts and the bulsness was very brisk
throughout the meeting. Everything was ideally managed and everybody
oame away more than satisfied, even the punters.
A party of our Brigade talent visisted the 3rd Aust
General Hospital, ABBEVILLE, and the conoert that eventuated was
much appreciated, by the Chums, diggers and Staff.
There was much sadness in store for the Brigade on
the 20th May, as the D.R. arrived, which signified going back lntc
action. This was viewed with regret, as the few days spent at
COCQUEREL were easily the most enjoyable holiday we had had so far.
During our stay, Fritz used to pay regular nightly
visits and paid a great deal of attention to ABBEVILLE. The people
there used to go out and sleep in fields and hedges at night, re-
turning to their homes the following morning.
On the 31st May we left COCQUEREL behind, bringing
away with us, pleasant memories of a pleasant rest. Our return routo
passed through FONTAINE and AIP.ANES that day, camping at HANGEST SUR
SOMME for the night. Our journey was continued the next morning down
the Somme Valley, through PICQUIGNY, A ILLY SUR SOMME, ARGONNES, AMIINS*
CANON and LONGUEAU, finishing up with Waggon lines at a little village
ealled Gllsy. They could not have ohosen a more dellgbtful spot, as it
was right on the Somme River, with beautiful swimming pools everywhere,
also punts in galore. Everyone was delighted, when they found them
selves, in -surroundings so congenial.
The guns went into action, just in rear of VILLERS
BRETTONEUX, on the right of CORBIE. Around this part the diggers did
wonderful work, when FVitz was trying to reach AMIENS in March and
April. Fritz used to veritably swamp the place with gas each night,
and of a morning, the air was thick with it. Most of our work h9_re was
harrasslng fire, on enemy trenches and back areas.
Great sniping work was done by soma of our guhs,
placed right in the village of VILLERS BRETTONEUX and only about 400
yards from the front Trenches and with the Observation Post near the
front line. When a Hun was sighted, it was only a matter of seconds
before shrapnel and H.E. was bursting all around him. The men do-lrvg
this sniping, say, it was the most interesting work imaginable. /
A few minor raids were successfully carried out, on
different occasions.
July 4th (American Independence Day) was commemorated
by a combined attack, on Fritz territory, by Australians and Arorlcans,
thi3 being the first time the Yanks' Infantry had been mixed with the
Diggers. It was a great suocess; the village of Hamel, also KANEL WOOD
and VAIRE WOOD falling into our hands. Over 1500 prisoners and numerous
aehlne Guns were also oaptured. (Continued next page).


was SaILL? LAURETTE, the guns going into action the following night in front
t)f MALLARD WOOD. At 4.45 a.m. on the 22nd, an attack was made, which proved
bightv successful; the objective was the out-skirts of BRAY- The guns were
Hived forward to a place called HAPPY VALLEY, which proved to be c. mis-
■noaer, es fritz strafed it to such an extent that the order was given to
pull back t.o the old position. Next afternoon, the guns moved forward
ajain- 2.30 the following morning, the barrage opened and our Infantry
captured BRAY. At 6.30 a.m. the Brigade moved forward to ETINHEIM, but
did ->ot fire from this position as the Infantry advance had been too
rapid.
Our next novo wasthrough BRAY, the Batteries taking up their
position on the other side of the town.
I will leave you here Effle, andin my next, hope to give you
some exciting experiences that occured afterwards.
Yours affectionately,

Whippet Tanks also ably assisted the Infantry in mopping up Fritz,
whilst Aeroplanes annoyed him a great deal more, flying very low and
riring on the retreating enemy. The front lifts was adavanced about a

back sixteen prisoners. ~ .
On July 10th, we took up another position near CORBIE, and
in rear of FOUI-uLQY, and kept Fritz annoyed by constant harrasslnm
fire, usually cross-roads dumps and C., about a dozen bursts (each
20 or 30 rounds) being sent over nightly, per Battery*

passed close by what wasonce, the village of SAME L, but now a heap
of shattered ruins. 1
a"®! - passing this village, we crossed the front
line of the night before. While going along, Fritz opened up-at very
ihort range with H.E. and things looked serious for a few minutes,
but, owing to inaccuracy of laying, a v.ery tight corner was passed,
with only a few caSualities oceuring to the Brigade.

Relief from the Summer heat,

The Queen of the folden sun.

Directing the Joys of life.

• OUR LAST BURROW
Deer Beryl, HOHTBREHAIH. 10/12/1
Row that old Fritz has ceased throwing Iron at us, I have more
opportunities of continuing my correspondence, hence tnis letter following
the other co qulekly.
I finished up at BRAY In my last, the guns were then on the Nortn
side. I did not tell ynu about our passage through the town. It simply
reeked with gas and everybody was shedding'tears. Fritz had thrown this gas
over the night before- Everywhere there was wreckage, the Town and Rail-
way being under bombardment so many times. The position we took up here
was fairly good, as the men had decent dug-cuts to sleep in. Our fire here
was mainly harrassing and the 3rd Divisional Infantry went on and oaptured
the village of SUZARKE. Great dumps of all sorts of war material were left
behind by the enemy in his haste to get away from our men.
On August 24th the guns sent forward, taking up a position
of SUZANNE near UPPER WOOD. Very little firing was done from here, mainly
observed shooting from the O-P's (Observation Post). The Battery Commanders
reconnoitred a position still further ahead.
On the morning of August 28th» under a heavy Artillery Barrage,
the Infantry oaptured CURLU, and the Batteries advanoe-i to a position in
pear of VAUX WOOD and again very little firing was done, the reason being
that the enemy was continually moving back.
On August 29th. the guns moved forward N.E. of CURLU. Practioally
nothing remained to show that a village had once stood there, as-every-
thing was battered to the ground. The Waggon-lines took up a position at
VAUX, a small village snugly Situated at the toot of a very steeo hill
which overlooked the SONME VALLEY. Fritz had gone to a lot of trouble
hero, building comfortable huts and Bungalows on the side of the hill. It
would have been quite an ideel spot for a sest, as everything around was
so beautiful. Tho Batteries from their position managed some good observed
Shooting on hostile Infantry movements.
On August 30th, after another attack had been made In the
morning, the guns moved forward near HOWITZER V7COD, the positions being
about 1700 yards in rear of front line. Here the oountry was quite open.
The Infantry was meeting with much stronger resistance now at CLERY COPSE,
an isolated Wood. It was a thiok nest of Machine gun posts. One had only
to move over tho rise just in front of the guns, to get a good view of the
Infantry fighting. The 0-P parties carried rifles and ammunition- and en-
Joyed muoh sport-, sniping at the German Maohine-gunners. Continuous har-
rassing fire was extensively carried out by the Batteries on thss9 "Hoiwiet
Nests" and one after another were knocked out by direot hits, this made
the work much easier for cur Infantry. Continuous firing was carried out
all day and toward evening, the big ridge which the enemy was holding at
the rear of QLERY COPSE, was cleared. During the day Fritz strafed Battery
positions and roads without oessatlon, the 25th Battery having a partic-
ularly rough time of it, with the loss of men killed end wounded. The 107 th
Battery also was harrassed with shells of heavy callbre.nThe Infantry ad-
vanced aboui 2000 yards during the day,
Arotxnd this part of the country there was one thing that oaught
the eye very forcibly, that was, the absolute absence of any Fritz graves
severing earlier periods in the war. In 1916 especially, very heavy fight-
ing between French and Bcsche ooeurred in this looality, as one could see
by the many French graves bearing dates of thatnperiod. No Fritz graves
word visible however, and this led one to think that the much read and
talked about, "German Corpse Utilization Scheme", of rendering the dead
bodies down for oils and fats, was not mythical but reality. Otherwise
therebwould havtf.been some, signs to show the killed in aotion. It would
be madness to think that the Hun escaped soatheless in these heavy en-
Oounters, so it leaves one imagining what he really did with the dead.
On August 31st our Infantry made another determined attack,
carrying the line forward about another 1500 yards. Batohes of prisoners
kept dribbling back our way all day long, bony of them were set to work
in'the rear, digging graves to bpry their dead who had fallen during the
last few days. Observed shooting from the different o'Ps was still being
carried out' with wonderful euooess. Comjmsiloations between Batteries and
O.p's were causing a great deal of Homage anxiety, as the lines wore being
continually cut by enemy shell fire. Fritz telephone wire was in great
demand; evry available pleoe being "salved" and made use of in maintaining
communications. Rifle sniping from the O.P's was still kept going.
Rather a fumy experience happened at the 26th Battery position. Major—
Gneral Jelllbrand, G.O.C. 3rd Dvlslon, was around one morning inspecting
the positions. The guns were firing at the time and suddenly the piece
of 1f0.4 Cun left the oarrlage landing some distanoo away. Ro one was

TO THE MEMBERS OF 7TH. F.A.B.
Our Sojourn 6° this side of the world Is slowly Hearing It's termination,
and before the Members of this Brigade become separated too much the
Yandoo Management will place a few facts before the readers, re-
garding final issues of the "Yandoo".
It is proposed, as in the case of Vol. 1 4 2, i.e.(to bind in
Eook-forn, all parts published in France and homeward journey) to make
No. 3 Volume a keepsake worth having.
To do this, the Management is procuring photographs whereever
possible, of thevarious battlefields and of little incidents thathave
occured concerning the Brigade. If any of the lads can bring or send
along photographs of interest, the Management will be more than pleased
to receive them for reproduction. An "Honor Roll", with photographs
of our comrades who have fallen, will occupy a conspicuous place, and
here again we shall be thankful for photographs of those who have paid
the supreme sacrifice-
As the Brigade is composed of representatives from all the
states, the task of ascertaining the number of volumes that will be
required, is going to be a hard one, and, to be able to cope with this,
the Management would like to get an idea from the Memoers as to how
many they will require. When more definite news of our demobilization
is, obtained, the Management will be only too pleased to accept early
orders. This refers mainly to members of the Brigade, who reside
away from Sydney, and will save them all bother when the volume is
printed. The cost, as near as can be calculated, will be about 2/-
per complete copy. For those who do not order early but would require
copies later on, the following Sydney address, 14 Moore St. will al-
ways bring a hearty response from the Management. The. three Yandoo
Volumes will bring forth many pleasant memories in years to come,
to those who have taken an interest in different happenings during
the Brigade's existenoe.

STATEMENT OF "YANDOO* ACCQUHTS AS AT 31-12-1918.


Fritz replying with high velocity and heavy calibre guns from Ms back
area. Some of these shells fell close to the WagonLlnes and oaused a
general "hands down*.
On Sept.24th, the Batteries were relieved at night by "Tommies".
The following evening the Brigade left HERVILLY area and travelled
towards TINCOURT occupying new lines close to this village. As it was
very dark great inconvenience was caused and to make matters worse, no
lights were allowed on ecoount of hostile aircraft.
Through the country which we were now travelling, we could not
help noticing the vandalism of the Hun, during his retirement to the Hin-
denburg Line in 1017. Woods, orchards and beautiful avenues of trees
■were absolutely ruined; the tree-trunks being ring-barked and partly
chopped through. Everywhere was mutilation, purely wanton destruction on
the part of the Hun, and this method of devastation was no doubt a hit at
the future commercialism. Certainly lt had little of military value. The
Hun had no limit as regards ravaging the country and villages.
I think this is just about as far as I am allowed to go this
issue, as I am limited to space.
In my next, I shall tell you all about my experiences in
crossing the famous Hindenburg Line, with lt s wonderful tunnel system.
For the present, Cheerio.
Yours affectionately,
Reginald.

Injured and the Major-General laughingly thanked the men for the exhlhlt<
ion.
On the following morning, Sept. Ist, another attack was made end
our Infantry ran up"against a very determined resistance, made by Prussian
Guards, who, we learned later, had volunteered to stop the advance of the
Australian troops. The Guards failed miserably, being shot down and bay-
onetted in great numbers and most of those who escaped being killed were
brought back prisoners. The objectives for the day were MQRT ST QU2JTTN
and the town of PERCMNE. Immediately the barrage was fired, the guns
moved fprward on to the slope that commanded PEROWRE. The Diggers were
not to be denied and after very bitter and severe fighting, the Germans
were driven back from these places, our boys gaining the admiration of
all, by their determined and successful effort.
The next day was very quiet, Pritz not having heart left for
serious retaliation. On 3rd Sept. an early morning attack took place on
our Immediate sector, our guns taking part in the strafing. The enemy
fell back and for the remainder of the day the guns ware out of range. On
the following day the guns cane out of action; the Batteries going back to
the rear of SUZANNE and were held there in reserve. On Sept.sth, orders
were received to go forward again, and the Brigade proceeded back to
CLERY, still being in reserve.
The roads leading to PERORNE were now absolutely packed with
traffic, Mile after mile of Motor-lorries laden with Australian and
English troops, passed steadily on towards the line.
On Sept.Bth the Brigade got on the move again, passing the
ruins of HALLE, PERONNE & DOINGTtDoing-it" as the Diggers called it)tak-
ing up Waggon-lines around the village of COURCELLES. We passed over dur-
ing the day the famous battlefields of 1916.
The town of PERONNE had suffered considerably, though not
actually razed to the ground. Then there was MOST ST QUENTQT a little to
the North West, commanding a magnificent- view of the country all around.
Its' slopes were literally covered with barb wire and solid machine gun
posts were everywhere. Countless German dead were strewn all over the place
Whole camps were absolutely burnt to the ground by Fritz on his retire-
ment, all of which had been built by the British before th famous March
drive. At COURCELLES, almost alonslde the Waggonlines flowed a splendid
little stream, called the "COLOGNE RIVES", a branch of the famous SOMME.
The country around here was practically free from the ravages of war,
very few shsllholes and plenty of green grass. Bombing 'Planes made
their usual night attacks, trying to locate the Waggonlines and main
Roads. The Brigade was kept here in reserve and enjoyed a well-earned
rest, as it had had a very strenuous time during the last month. Hardly
a day passed without the Guns or Waggonlines being shifted to different
positions. Field manoeuvres were carried out in the mornings during our
stay here, and the afternoons were devoted to improving the conditions
around the camp. At nightime, it was quite a fine spectacle to see a
score or more of Searchlights playing on the Hun Bombers. The night
of 13th Sept. brought forth cheers. Some of our night-flying "Scouts"
succeeded in accounting for three of these terrors of the air. It was
a glorious sight watching the Hun trying to get away from the Search-
lights, then to see the "phosphorous tracer bullets* from our own ma-
chines spitting fire at the enemy, then his crash to eacth in flames
accompanied by a display of colored "Verey" lights.
The Civilian graveyard at DOINGT, about a mile from the Waggon
lines, created much Interest, as all the tombs had the appearanoe of being
opened and the lead and metal taken from the coffins. Skeletons and broken
ooffins littered the tombs and it appeared as if the Huns had robbed them
all.
On Sept. 17th the guns went into action again, taking up a pos-
ition near the village of HERVILLY. During the night there was very heavy
rain and the gun positions were anything but cosy. Fritz strafed tlxs
positions the whole of the night with gas and high explosives. The fol-
lowing morning at 5a,M. a barrage was opened up and the Infantry went
over. The Waggonlines moved forward ready to take the guns further along
to a position near CARPEZE YVOOD. Owing to gas and fog, things were not
100 cheery after getting to the positions and Fritz absolutely rained
shells on then. It was marvellous how any one escaped withba whole skin-
When the hostile fire died down, the guns were withdrawn, taking up a rear
position again and still being only 2500 yards from the front line. The
following day, Sept.l 9, observed shooting was carried out with marked
success. The O.P's now, were conducted in outposts of the Hindenburg Line.
On Sept.2lst at 5.40 a.m. a covering barrage was put down*
the Infantry getting into a position where they could overlook the
Hindenburg Line. Harrasslng fire was the daily routine from this "possie".

14.3.19.
Deer Old Sadie,
By now I expect you have read my letter to Beryl In the last
"Yandoo". I promised to write to her again this time hut she's gone "stone
fache" on me because of a certain paragraph In our "Scurrilous Rag". Oh
well "Ce ne fait rlen", I'll scratch a few lines to you Instead.
In the last letter I got as far as September 24th, when we were
at TINCOURT. On the 28th the Brigade set out after the 'Orrible 'Un
again 4we made waggon lines near ST EMILIE. We pulled In here or) one of
the blackest of black nights 4 Fritz thumped the vicinity well and truly
until daybreak. Then our stunt omened and Fritz got the thumping. This
was the first major operation in which the Amerloans 4 Australians had
fought side by side. The Yanks made the initial hopover but being a bit
inexperienced they got too far ahead without mopping up. Fritz then cr-
awled out of his burrow 4 began to make trouble. About 800 Yanks were
cut off, so the Aussles then"hopped the bags" 4 after mopping up went on
4 gained the objectives 4 succeeded in rescuing the lost Yanks. The cas-
ualties in this operation were very heavy, especially with the Americans.
Before the attack we were on the fringe of the great Hindenburg
Line. Tou have read in the papers how the Hun was forced to give up this
strong line of defence, so I wont bother repeating it here. Talk about
barbed wire! The country was literally sown with it. There were five sep-
arate belts of thiokly laid entanglements, eaoh about 25 yards in width
with a "Ho Man's Land" of 100 yards or so between eaoh line of wire. The
shell craters, mighty big ones at that, were linked together, so numerous
were they. Dereliot tanks dotted the landscape, some scrawled on their
baoks, others with noses pointing skyward, for all the world like some
kind of defunct mammoths. Mine fields had been responsible fcr their down
fall.
Battered 5.9 4 4.2 guns were to be seen here and there ani as
often as not the German gun-crews alongside, the latter as full of holes
as the former. The trench systems behind the wire belts bristled pith
machine-gun posts 4 strong-points; many of which were connected by under-
f round passages. Behind and parallel with this defence zone ran the ST.
DENTIN SCHELDT CANAL. The width of the canal was approximately 25yards,
4 the water level 100 feet below the ground surface. The sides of the
Canal cutting rose at an angle of something like 60 Degrees, and were
thiokly covered in scrub. A narrow tow-path ran along the bottom of the
cutting close to the water's edge. The steep banks were honeycombed with
tunnels, 4 ooncrete machine gun posts. Some of tie tunnels led
out under the barbed wire systems to the trenches. All the tunnels had
been strongly timbered 4 had off-shoots which terminated in spacious
chambers many feet underground. Electric light had been installed in all
the tunnels.
Near the town of BELLICOURT the canal disappeared into a great
tunnel, similar in size to a double-line railway tunnel. At the entrance
a oonorete wall 4 feet in thickness, reaching from oeiling to river-bed
had been constructed, with a heavy iron door opening on to the tow-path.
Another great concrete barrier was built several hundred yards away down
the tunnel. The walls of brick and oonorete were everywhere pierced 4
passages led from the entrances to workshops, engine rooms & Cookhouses.
Some of the passages ascended steeply in continuous flights of steps 4
cane out along the canal, top. The exits were inconspicuously small 4
well concealed. In the water in the tunnel lay many huge barges 4 these
had been converted into living and sleeping quarters, but all were
scuttled by the Hun before he was driven out. An electric light plant
was also installed, but at this time the place was plunged in darkness,
4 one wishing to see the tunnel had to do so by torch and candle-light.
The air underground was foul, 4 the barges 4 dug-outs indescribably
filthy. How human beings could eat, live 4 sleep there and still renain
in a healthy condition, has one guessing. An army of soldiers could he
easily accomodated in that tunnel and could he perfectly safe from all
flying ironmongery ever invented. The length of the St.QUENTIN Tunnel was
approximately 3jmlles. It was close to this tunnel that our waggon lines
were made on Ootoher 7th, and from there the Batteries went into action
again.
At 3.30 a.m. on the Bth, at WIANCOURT another barrage was
fired; the cavalry and armoured cars broke through, and a couple of
hourslater, the enemy was reported to be in full retreat. The" Battery
gasi«T®ns were bombed almost every night, and also the traffic-laden rosds
Brigade moved on via ESTREES, RAMICOURT, MONTBREHAIN,
BRANCOURT, PREMONT, to BSCQUIGNY. On the outskirts of the last mentioned
village, waggon lines'were taken up.


RETROSPECT-IN-BRIEF.
ARMISTICE IS SIGNED! sounded very "bon" when it came through "dlnkum" on
Nov. 11th.eh? Of course we had been anticipating It any moment for days be-
fore;- and the "Furph Kings" had been continually giving out the "good oil"-
But at last it was honest "din;)in" fact, and it was at first somewhat dif-
ficult to realise fully all that it meant.
In now looking back over that era, there is little doubt that the
desolate and impoverished region in and around MONTBREHAIN where we were
billeted was the "fly in the ointment", the factor of our individual and
collective calm. Infinite thoughts crowded one's brain. Few, if any, had
that "push-a-tram-over" feeling-Armistice in itself "was not sufficient to
breed it. Inspiration was necessary, and it wasn'\ about,-especially in
"pints".
Y/e had been in this village previous to going on and covering the
Scotties in their Oise Canal stunt, and had returned to clean our varied
paraphernalias when the great news hit us. And times changed indeed. The-
war-worn-living-for-the-day" idea naturally gave plaoe to some meanderings
into the future, to glorious, soul-stirring anticipations. Home & all it's
associations seemed to suddenly come almost within touch; dreams of years
past appeared on the brink of materialisation. These thoughts were well-
aired over the billet fire, and soon it was "Wonder how long it will be be-
fore we get a start on with demobilisation and "What will we be doing mean-
time?" Both problematical,-and who of us did not ponder over them? All
would have desired to be off home at the "toute", but that was well under-
stood to be Impossible, the shipping difficulty, in Itself, being fully
realised.
Withal, the dull monotony of waiting, ekeing out existence the while
in villages destitute of sparkle, would periodically play on the nervous
tension & draw a squeal out of some of us, but everyone knew that everyone
else was a Jolly sight more philosophic than he sounded.
For a time, Football took hold, and there was many a good game &
thumping afternoon at Rugby, Aussie Rules, and Soccer.
On two occasions there were brushes in connection with the details
of "Carrying on", & it is sufficient comment so far as these notes are
concerned to mention, that the "Heads" readily removed any established
source of grievance.
Soon after the move to HAUTMONT towards the close of the Year,
papers relative to Demobilisation, and also the Educational Scheme began to
appear in their thousands, & on them we severally sratched a kind of "Mil-
itary auto-biography". Things wre moving in the right direction, and even
though slowly, it was highly gratifying. The huge Demobilisation Machine was
in operation, and everyone hoped that Divinity in it's wisdom would keep on
suggesting to the Engineers all manner of improvements toward that solution
of primary importance-Speed.
Meanwhile, there were veritable thunderstorms, deluges of brains. A
Sohool was set up and classes formed in the various Arts for the benefit
of the keen and uninitiated. Those not over addicted to the mental
tearlngs of fagging, remained in ambush, and in anticipation of a soft
"cop" and sheets in Blighty, most emphatically Impressed on themselves
(and their application for Non-Military Employment paper) that it would be
to their benefit for ever and ever amen if they had a course of -say,
"Shipbuilding". But the majority of us came "proverbials"- u Sandbag Mary
Ann".
There were murmurs of a draft gclng off. Y/ho? How manybon it? Cal-
culations were ripe. 'Twas refreshing, invigorating, rejuvenating, almost
too good to be true. Do you recall the tears you shed on the sth & 6th.
March as you looked upon our first departing quotrs, or were you "touring"
Blighty, France & Belgium?" Our religious Editor" could no longer contain
his pathos when someone suggested to him that they were about to leave the
dear, kindly, motherly care of the Army, and howled suitably to the occas-
ion.
But how about LOBBSS. Wasn't teo dusty living the life of a retired
"Beef King" out in the country, and doing the 4 or more Kilos, to parade
by Car Electrlque, What! Kiwied & otherwise generally polished, one stepped
from his "Maison" on to the line, manicured whilst going along to the
Arret Fixe" nearby, boarded the on-coming tram and prooeeded to "Here Sir,"
Who said "Portholes."

The cftuntry passed through after leaving the Hlndenburg Line was not very
badly shell-holed & some of the villages were very little damaged. The
BEC QUIGUY wagonlineS were very close to the fir lng line 4 well within
the range of the German 4.2 guns & these treated the countryside to a
generous sprinkling at odd hours of the day 4 night. The batteries went
Into aotion a few kilometres further on.
Everywhere were signs of the enemy's hasty retreat. All the
bridges had been mined, some were total wreoks, but others were Intact 4
the mines still in position though disconnected. The railway lines were
blown up leaving great chasms 4 tangled masses of twisted rails 4 splint-
ered sleepers. In some of the railway yards were stored large quantities
of ooal 4 thesehad been prepared for destroyal by fire, but time 4 the
advancing troops had been a bit too pressing, so we derived the benefit
of the coal. We also had to thank Fritz for a good supply of fresh
vegetables. Cabbage patches, acres in extent some of them, were to be
found distributed about the country. These had no doubt been planted by
French civilian labor under Hun rule. The horses lived well too, for
many of the huge barns were stacked to the roof with the Hun's winter
fodder supply.
On the morning of the 17th an attaok was made, but a heavy fog
hampered the Infantry 4 prevented observation 4 the rsult of the oper-
ation was not wholly satisfactory. The following morning a barrage was
put down 4 the Yanks "hopped the bags" 4 gained their objectives, but
were forced to relinquish their hold. A second attempt was made assisted
by another Artillery barrage, but still the result was not achieved.
As the guns gradually moved forward, so followed up the wagon
lines, first to LA KAIE MENERESSE 4 then to ST.SOUPLET. On til e 20th the
Americans were relieved by British Troops. In the last few attacks
there had been much killing 4 the dead were strewn everywhere 4 the road-
sides were lined with the carcases of horses and mules. Rain fell con-
tinuously 4 the ground soon became very boggy. "Dug-out life" was cert-
ainly "no bon" 4 there was a rapid evacuation of sick men. On the 21st
at 3.30 a. fi. Fritz began a heavy area shoot 4 a counter-attack was expect-
ed. However the Hun satisfied his spite with the bombardment as no In-
fantry attaok followed.
Next night it was full-moon 4 at 1 a.m. our Artillery opened
fire, Proteoted by the barrage the Infantry attacked 4 this time it wa3
very successful. Perhaps the enemy was oaught napping-theusual hour for
attaok being day-light. The Artillery bombardment lasted several hours.
This time the guns of the Brigade remained statloary 4 on the eve of the
23rd withdrew to the wagon lines at St.Souplet.
On the morning of the 25th we retraced our steps as far as
Montbrehaln. The town of ST.SOUPLET was shelled by a long-range gun as
the last of the column passed through.
The majority of the "oivles" had evacuated Montbrehaln 4 al-
though two-thirds of the village was awreck, still there were many houses
which could be converted Into good billets & the troops had the luxury
of stoves, beds 4 furniture. After a few days of easy living wo began
to think that perhaps there was a chance of getting that long promised
rest, but no such luck. On the last day of the month orders came through
for the Brigade to go back to the line.
November Ist saw us making our way to a village called LA VALLEE
MULATRE, 4 from this place the Batteries went into action. The weather
again "turned dog on us", cold winds 4 driving rain prevailing.
At daybreak on the 4th Nov. the stunt whloh we were sent back to
the line to take part in, opened. This attack extended 50 miles albng
thellno 4to an approximate death of three miles. All went well 4 the
total bag was 13000 'Kunsand 250 Guns. Fritz's heavies pounded the
area oocupied by the Brigade, whloh made it necessary for everyone to
keep a low back. After the Barrage the hostile shelling ceased 4 the
enemy was soon driven out of the range of the Field guns. Then it did'nt
take long for the "souvenir Kings" to get busy over the territory just
evacuated by the Huns.
Evidently the Bosche had the "wind well up", for gear 4 sets of
equipment lay everywhere, shewing that he preferred flight to fight.
The Brigade pulled out the following morning 4 on thesth reurned to NONT-
BREHAIN via BOHAIH.
Five days later the Armistice was declared, 4 the "guerre flnl"
as far as we were concerned.
The news of the cessation of hostilities did not create any un-
due excitement throughout the Brigade.
For several days previous to the Armistice, the air was full of
"furphles",. and it was not until our Official announcement was made on
mßre.de thatthe trocns accepted the fact as "dlnkum".


Sore said "C-oodo"j Others, "Sow we'll have to roll up the barbed wire S.
fill in the shell-holes!"
Certainly the momentous news was accepted In a very matter of fact
way.
Headquarters that night held a hit of a corrohoree, and a few of
the diggers had an argument with a jar of rum; that's about all that
happened.
Practically all our letters from Aussie written after the sign-
ing of the Armistice, expressed thewish how much the folk would have
liked to have been with the troops to witness the great excitement on Nov.
11th. They would havegone home very disappointed I am afraid.
Vie' stayed in MORTBREHAIN for a month and during that period
took things easy. About Nov.llth Lt.Col.StClair became our C.O.
On 15th Nov. General Grimwade left the 3rd Division & was suc-
ceeded by Lt. Col. Allsop.
Ever since Sen. the 3rd Div. Artillery has been"motherless"- in
other words hasbeen separated from the remainder of the Div., which went
to ABBEVILLE after the'BELLICOURT stunt. This separation has many dis-
advantages, In so much that, stores, especially Canteen goods & clothing:
come to us in dribs and drabs, and even our allotment of leave seems to>
get lost at times.
A few days aft6rthe signing of the Armlstloe, each Battery and
Headquarters, had a bunch of "Squareheads" attached for fatigue duty. All
agreed this was an excellent idea, but why wasn't it thought of whllstthe
"Guerre" was in progress?
Rumours soon began to reach us of a move, and we half expected
that lt would be as part of the Army of Occupation to the RHINE towns.
So there was much polishing & shining to which the Diggers did not tak®
too kindly. We saw to lt that our Huns did their share of the "Yakka"„
needless to say!
Hearly every afternoon Football Matches were played & some ver.
fine games resulted.
On Deo.l2th we said good-bye to MOHTBREHAIH & travelled until
the 14th, passing through BOHAIN. VAUX, ANDIGNY, MOLAIN, MAZINGHEIM,
CATILLOH, GROISE, PRECHES, AVESNES, ST. HILAIRE, finally pulling up irr
HAUTMONT, a manafaoturing town, situated astride the River SAMBRE, south
of HAUBUEGE. The residents extended a hearty welcome to the Aussie
troops, and the latter were soon"well dug-ln", and from then on were
treated like'one of the family".
Shortly after arrival the 3rd Div.Artillery Concert Party, "The
Courtiers Costume Comedy Co.", which had been working hard at rehearsals
etc . whilst the Brigade was at MONTEREHAIN, gave their first performance.
The company was formed from Memebrs of the Div.Art. & Droved a very
popular success.
Christmas Day was celebrated in various ways by the BATTERIES, •
but the Inevitable "recofeeries" were moreor less the same, ahem! The
townsfolk ably assisted by the Diggers, sung and danced the New Year
into being.
On the 2nd January, H.R.H. the Prince of Kales, inspected the
3rd Div. Artillery, and men who had gained Military Honors were presented
with their medals.
On Jany.sth, General Grimwade returned to the Div. as C.R.A. &
Lt.Col.Macartney as C.O. of the 7th Brigade. Ten days later Col. Macart-
ney became Acting C.R.A. & Major Fanning became 7th Brigade's C.Q.
During our stay in HAUTMONT much time was devoted to sport, such
as horse racing & Football and our nights were pleasantly whiled away,
either at the"Courtlers", The Cinema, Euohre Tournaments or the Batta-y
Dances. Each Battery held danoes in turn &in spite of the absence of
fine raiment &. dancing slippers, these little affairs went off most
happily. There was no lack of female partners either! (oh it's quite
alright Aussie Girls-only a very small percentage of the boys got mar-
ried in Hautmcnt)!
At last the day we were ail waiting for, arrived. The day on
which we were to be rid of some of our four-footed pals-the horses!
They were"the one fly in the ointment"-war or no war they had to be
watered, fed & groomed. Did I say groomed?
Every few days saw a decrease in their numbers, but still they?
did not disanpear fast enough for us.
We had some good snowfalls about this time, and the troops &
oivies had some ding-dong snow fights, and for several days Hautmont was
convened into a miniature "Western Front".
An epidemic of Spanish Influenza showed itself In January, and
for some weeks lt raged. Illness was rife in the Units, and deaths
from "Bronco-Pneumonia" were numerous. Funerals passed through the town

March saw a gradual disappearance of the "Flu", for which every
one was thankful.
The first repatriation draft left 7th Brigade on sth March en
route fpr England. This quota consisted of approximately 130 men.
Orders were received for the 3rd.Artillery to move into an-
other area on the 11th. This move did not appeal to the majority; as
they hap settled down and made many friends in HAUTMONT.
The goodbyes were very touching & of course copious tears were

WAR TO ? S A C
Inexpressible was the Joy that filled, not only the British Empire
but also the whole universe, when it became known that hostilities had '
ceased. Almost every home was represented in that universal conflict
on both sides, in our enemies and Allies alike with the exception of
the small neutral powers, and even to the latter the cessation of
hostilities meant a good deal. Although not directly involved in
conflict, their commerce was cut off from the rest of the world and
then retarded or praotically brought to a standstill for that lone
period of five years during whloh the brains and lnventitive genius
of ©very, nation was directed toward the one and only purpose and that
of achieving victory. ' »
Just think of the heart-broken fathers and mothers turning grey
headed by the loss of one or several sons and their anxiety from day to
day, awaiting news either good or bad, till at last that day of all days
»K V6 ?L ePfaced t TOm i not only th9lr memories but also from those"
who-bore the brunt of battle backwards and forwards over ground that
even Nature itself was almost forbidden to take a hand till finally
the 11th November 1918 brought PEACE for the time beiAg to everything
human and inhuman on land, sea, and in the air. Pre-war days it was"
not common for the blind pauper to earn anhonest living from a stringed
kerosene tin but not till hostilities had actually ceased did that tin
express openly the feelings of Joy in hearts of old and young alike
Those who could not carry it, sat on it and drummed out what noise they
could, not knowing why, but purely and simply to harmonize with the
? S f 9ld9rs . The wholß w °rl<i for the time being went mad
and why? To celebrate the fact that the dogs of war were once again '

the crossing of the Atlantlo by air. This feat was left open'as a "
matter of contest to the world at large our enemies .excluded The
first attempt although a failure sent all England into a state of mad
enthusiasm, and the competition became keener. The feat was finally
aooompllshed and the first mall from New Poundland to England carried
by aeroplane in a comparatively short space of time thus bringing the
mastery of the air to a more deolslve accomplishment. All this goos
to stow in what a stort period of time the hearts, heavy with the pangs
of grief caused by the horrors of war, were made joyous by the glorious
deeds of national accomplishments

In sight, of the Southern Crass,
12th. July, 1919, '
Dear "Canary Legs, *
My last letter (which was written to a fair damsel mused
Sad_) gave an account of the wanderings of this not until the occupation
of LOBBES Belgium, We blew in on 11th. March and held that front until
30th. April, In faot the last of the Brigade did not leave until well
into May. Several drafts left for England during our stay and by the
end of April only a mere handful of the 7th remained, LOBBES was any.
thing hut a lively Joint and we had to make our own fun. Dancing in the
estaminets with the Eelgian "tabs* to the rasping strains of automatic
"Blood organs", hopping the tram to Anderlues to the colliery haths,
where one enjoyed a first rate hot shower, and consuming "oeufs and chips'"
were our chief pastimes. The "Heads" gave us a very fair "burl" as far
as Buck she e leave was concerned. The last day of April saw e large draft,
consisting of 3rd, Div. Artillery and Sigs. Siege Artillery, 6th, Mobile
and 2nd. Div. Artillery, trucking at CHARLKROI for LE HAVRE. Tlx® Yandoo
Management and Outfit were on the strength of the draft so ny letter will
now deal only with the doings of the 7th. boys who were oa that draft.
We shunted, bumped and jerked our way to LE HAVRE and after going through
the "delouser" camp marched into 25%. 2 Australian Divisional Base Depot.
From 2nd to 6th. May we stayed In this camp playing our national gam® of
"Two.up, exchanging old uniforms for new and receiving new underclothing,,
I must not forget to tell you that each man was issued with a beautiful
bright new Jack-knife and was told by the Q M. not to spoil it because it
had to be handed in to the Camp Q. M, in England as soon as we arrived.
We are still wondering if that was a little joke by the Military Author-
ities or Just a cunning means of saving transport?
We crossed the Channel during the night of the 6th. and
entrained at SOUTHAMPTON for SUTTON VENY, Wilts, on th® 7th. SUTTON
VENY camp is very similar to any other permanent military camp, simply
acre after acre of corrugated iron huts, concrete pathways and ragged
cabbage patches. The nearest town was WARMINSTER two miles away but
after spending an afternoon there one was quite fed up. However the
surrounding country was beautiful the season being Spring. Tender
green crops were showing and the hedges and woods were covered with new
foliage. The beauties of Nature ceased to appeal on the morning of
14th. May, for it was then that the quota wont,on its final fourteen
days leave, and if you turn the pages and scan our columns carefully, you,
will glean considerable information regarding the doings of those "bold
bad Aussies" of the 7th. Brigade. Those days went at""the toot" but on
return to camp some of the more fortunate, or should I say the biggest
liars oontrived to scrounge a few extra days. Then things became mono-
tonous, the general routine toolng "beaucoup dornl" ono parade and three
meals per diem plus "severeal" visits to the "Salvos" or "Y, Emmas" for
morning and afternoon tea, and a stroll to "Greonhille" or "The Manor
House" finishing up the day with- "a coupls o-'whasls on 'is 'eads" or a
"deener" on the "old Sergeant Major." As you will not "compree" tho
above I'll take the trouble to explain that they are merely expressions
used In "Two-up" and "Crown and Anchor "
By the way old dear wo did have excitement. Bosssiimes.
That' was when there were innoculatior.s and inspections by tho "Quack* for
whooping cough, sandy blight and similar complaints, and also at raro
Intervals there were pay days.
Our boat roll was made up on 30th. June and at 2 a.m. on
the Ist. July reveille blew us out of bed (those of us who got there) and,
we toddled off to WARMINSTER at 4-30 with packs up In the drizzling rain.
Had a comfy, trip to DEVONPORT and marched on bop.rd S.S. "KARMALA" the
same day. Approximately 1500 men boarded her altogether and the next
morning we oast off and steamed out into the stream where wo dropped
anchor for three or four hours. DEVONPORT and PLYMOUTH HARBOUR were
studded with war-ships of all classes and as we steamed by them, the
"lads in blue" lined up and gave us throe hearty British cheers. On
shore bugles blew and flags dipped and taking it all round we got quite z
decent send off.
The "KARMALA" Jerked up the old "mud hook" at noon and
passing through the breakwater faced the open sea, and we drew deep
breaths of fresh salt air and said to one another "At last we're in thfc
straight." The shores of England slowly receded and by five o'cioet:
were out of sight. (aver)

To.day is our tenth J ay on the bosom of the mighty deep
and with the exception of a distant, view of the CANARY ISLANDS no other
land has been sighted. For the first five days we had a calm sea and a
stern wind and our old packet (beg pardon Captain Armitage) bowled along
at a great rate, the log one day registering 349 knots. As we neared
the Equator the weather changed and on the afternoon of the 10th. we
bumped a bit of a monsoon but this blew Itself out in a couple of hours
Each day was Increasingly hot, but a strong head wind followed the squail
and somewhat cooled the atmosphere. Our troopship is excellently fitted
up and the "tucker" wellcooked and good. Military discipline is to a
great extent relaxed and after the morning parade we are free to do as we
please, The Y.M.C.A. provides the troops with a library and the canteen
with luxuries. There are educational classes on a score or more subject:
and these and deck sports fill in the long hours of the day. We have to
thank the Quota Orchestra and the Divisional Concert Party for some very
pleasant evenings. Take it from me there is nothing like a bit of music
to help gladden the heart. The mere fact of being homeward bound should
be sufficient to fill our hearts with joy and if there's any Digger with
"the skanks" well he may as well join the porpoises the "Quack"
cannot cure him. '
Each night we dance, at least some of us do the others
try. On the morning of the 12th. July wo crossed the line'and that
evening those on board celebrated the event by holding a Fancy Dress Jazz
The promenade deck was alive with gay colours and here let me whisper
that the dances were not all buck sets for we have with U3 ten of the
sweetest, dinkiest, ' lkkle Sisters you ever saw. Oh, la la.ll i
Now I've to hand this over to the tender care of "Lamps"

famous exponent of growling "Lamps AB."

At last we are aboard the ship heading for Australia. What a
little while ago it is. when seated against the sand bags in Prance we
reflected that a berth aboard a homeward bound would dispell all

psychological quiet which leads to ennui? It was over-indulgence in the
spirit of peaceful contentment that made Britain so dangerously unprepared
for the present scrap. The same type of intrepid tranquility led to the
arrest of Private Swingthelead at the Ansae Buffet the other day. He had
been absent without leave for three months obtaining his food from the

HISTORY OF THE SEVENTH F.A.B. A.1.?
CHAPTER I.
SYDNEY - TROOPSHIP.
In writing a history of any military body, it is well to gather some
facts as to the reason why the men enlisted and the spirit of the country from
which they enlisted. This may he done by picturing a scene. , t ~
Let us imagine that it is a spring morning and the whole ofAustralia
is pionioing by the beach or lolling on the green banks of tne near-by ri .
These pleasure loving Australians have never nationally known sorrow have
rarely known distress. They have spent their leisure, of which'they have had
goodly quantities, in sport and pleasure, and they have earned their money
easily by comparison with wage earners of other nations, and this spring
morning, they are gambling on the sands in bathing costumes, youth is making
love to youth; ho?ses art galloping in races along the green sward; cricket
halls are being skied; a football soars above the tree tops; coins are
spinning upward in the enchanting game of w two-up. n All is joy, all is
eSftuSihsm- everyone is nationally care-free ana nationally secure.
I ™ratine'them from the old world, the cauldron of perpetual trouble is an
ocean eStnse of ten thousand milesj What security! What peace! War could
never soar them and theirs at such a distance. How and then knots of men
eather about the booth and toast each other in foaming glasses while musio
from sweet voices women and children float to them on the gentle breeze and all
the while youth is dancing it's joyful dance over the golden sands; but as the
waars on. a black cloud, little more than a dark speck at first
starts out over the horizon ana slowly makes across the sky. It is the troub-
le with Servia. Following that came other clouds, ana then a sudden, though
verv^distant rumbling as lough one of the outposts of the world ls sufferrng.
The'nHhe sky becomes overcast and the men cease their sports golf clubs are
laid down, the two-up pennies cease to spin, the cricketer sits onhis bat
the dreamy youth releases the maiden's hand, the women and children hurriedly
seek shelter, old men are grouped together, and according to their education

TOREIBS OF THZ WARRIE.
The Artillery camp of New South Wales was at this time under the
oommand of It.Colonel Pierce and located at The Warren, one time a convent in'
the suburb of Marrickville on a rocky eminence at the foot of which may he
traced Cooks River the course of which may be traced till it empties into
Botany Bay. On the shores of this bay Capt. Cook had landed nearly a century
and a half ago, discovering for the British 3mpire a new country which had
« great and prosperous dominion a lana of sunshine inhabited bv a free
™+s r9li ? nt people. As Marmalade's eye traversed the panorama and rested
on the spot wnere this great discoverer set foot in the name of the King of
England he wondered at the enterprise, hardihood and devotion of these
i ex P lorers > at the grit and determination of his f-thers who pioneered
resolved in his turn to continue the illustrious cycle, to
emulate the grand example and leave a history for his generation worthy of
those who went before him.
the m + Tllos e grim grey walls of the ola convent building, within which were
. ers of tsle officers and the orderly room, now onoe more echoed with
oBaig§§±BH§j I§§§ reliable no doubt than in former times, for it did not profit
a man to tell the truth when he had been absent without leave for nearly a week
without good reason. A sentry paced up and down the verandah in front of the
building, his duties being to prevent unauthorised persons from gaining
admittance to the august presence of the colonel, and to salute all officers
presenting arms to field officers ("anything above a major" as the vernacular
of the Sgt. of the guard had it) and bestowing a dexterous wink on an
oooasional gunner who entered the doorway to gain access to the telephone under
the stairs. When the Colonel and "stripy" (H.Q. Sgt.Major) were well out of
sight he would even venture to look around the door to watch the distressed
gunner endeavouring to learn from the girl at Manly or Chatswood where he was to
meet her for dinner, above, the noise made by the field service boots coming at
the double down the oarpetless stairs overhead.
In front of the building was an 15 pounder gun as used in the boer
war, now serving the dual purpose of adding dignity to the artillery camp and
rousing the troops by firing the day in at 6.a.m. reveille. On the first and
several mornings succeeding, the latter purpose was fulfilled, some of the
gunners even strolling out in pyjamas to see the gun fired, but a3 future
experience fully illustrated in Prance, the slumbers of tired healthy warriors
soon beoome impervious to even the firing of a gun. At first too the report
frightened the horses ploquetted on the slope of the hill below the gun park.
They strained at their head ropes, pulled out the pegs securing the heel ropes
and caused the tired and sorely tried pioquet a considerable amount of trouble
and a great deal of language to restore equanimity and order.
The leading spirit of the horse lines was "Big Stretch," length 6'5".
His big stentorian voice sounding like the safety valve of a locomotive struck
l£ ar „ 0 the h9arts 01 the troops, installed into them devotion to duty when
the Sergeant was looking, and a disposition to throw boulders at him when he
+w ßn v , "Stretolx" knew more about military procedure than did Marmalade or
xne bulk of the new soldiers, his qualifications for the three stripes being
tbe terror-striking propensity of his voice, a number of years handling kanakas,
nis longitude ana his knowledge of horses. He could sit an unruly horse by tie
simple prooeaure of putting his feet to the ground alternately to preserve his
oalanoe as the horse swerved one way or the other. No stirrup leathers were
T 9 9 l on g enough for "Stretch." It sometimes became necessary for him. acting
in the capaoity of an H.C.O. to put a pioquet of working party through some
"iSffiSßtary footdrlll. This was by no means his long suit, but "Stretch" was
ready though rough. On one occasion the orderly officer directed him to move
his party a little to the right. What did it matter to "Stretch" about the
correct military order so long as his party was moved) Throwing his chin
forward and with his whip rapping .his leggings in staccato he bellowed
"Party 'shun. Three strides to the right! So! "Stretch" as nay be
expected, never became a sergeant on the guns, but went to France about the
same time as the rest of the Brigade and beoame a Jaokeroo over munitions, and
was frequently seenriding a lanky horse bearing a singular resemblance to
himself, a ohestnut, long and gaunt of 18 hands or so and with a stride like a
camel.
The recruits at this time knew little of matters military. Most of
the citizen forces were already fighting on Gallipoll or occupying some staff
position in Australia. N.C.Os therefore were seleoted for accomplishments
other than military knowledge; some for personality, some for sheer hide.
The former qualification secured quality and the latter quantity. A plausible
P 9 " TO ° allt y ln a orei3 ulous community profits by impressing those around him
with his own importance. This is how "looky" another N.G.O. rose above the
little band of comrades with whom he enlisted and became their Sergeant Major,


"Locky" bad self satisfaction and inventive genius. He was educated
-lmost to perfection. He knew and believed he was Sergeant Tvlajor by
Divine Right and it was only modesty which caused him to lurk in
obscurity when Lord Kitchener's Job was being filled. "Locky" was
educated at Edinburgh University and it was a pleasure to the troops to
hear him address the parade "Get filled in, the whistle's blew."
Experiences many and wonderful did "Locky" relate to his admiring
underlings; hair breath escapes in the Boxer Rebellion, tales of bravery
in the Boer Uar, deeds of daring in Mexico and hand to tooth fights with
ferocious animals in the Indian Jungle. Locky was an inventive genius.
Be related how when touring the continent, a Balkan princess fell
violently in love with him, but the King her father, refused his consent
to their marriage. He had recently received a lawyer's letter calling
upon him to pay £30,000 for cattle, an amount already settled, but the
receipt unfortunately was lost. This touched the hearts of the hearers
who resolved to call for subscriptions to ameliorate their Sergeant
Major's distress. The following will be recognised by many who we re at
the Uarren at the time and saw it exhibited on the notice board in front
of the old building;-

The types of N.C.Os herein depicted were commonly met with at the
period described, but fortunately for the future of the brigade they were
not all of that stanp. Many gained promotion through Stirling worth .tact,
firmness in handling men, ardour for the efficiency of the Brigade and
good solid work. It was the former type, however, that began by losing
the respect of the troops, lost influence over them, exposed themselves to
ridicule and were largely responsible for the inception of the wily art
of swinging the lead or the science of avoiding work without detection."
Pew of us ever dreamt that the opportunity would present itself for us
to see any country other than Australia. Firstly because we were so far away
from all other lands and secondly because in our Isolation, in the Great
Southern Ocean, we grew to love our own land so well that we lost the desire to
travel. Australia's myriad aspects sufficed for all temperaments and tastes,
hut when the war clarion sounded over the earth, the Australian buckled on his
armour and set forth on his grim pilgrimage to the earth's end. It was on the
morning of the 11th.May 1916. that we, as members of the 7th. F.A.B. set forth
on our great pilgrimage, the step into the great unknown.
Who will ever forget the '•Reveille" at "The Warren" as it sounded
that Autumn morning? In most of our memories it will echo while we remain on
this mortal coil. It soundea at 3.30.a.m. that alone is enough to make one
remember it. Very few had slept, many had not even attempted to woo gentle
slumber, hut all hurried to the Cook House for a plate of the everlasting "stocV*
and then, with our kit hags and overcoats, we were drawn up in front of the
historic building, fnow demolished,) addressed for a few seconds by the
C.O.lt.Colonel Pearce, while the Y.M.C.A. Chaplain, with a few words thrown
into the darkness, touched a sympathetic note in every fellow's heart, and put
us in good cheer for our farewell. t
We marched to the tram, any old -ay, and an old lady, wrinkled, care-
worn and bowed down with the weight of sorrow and years, was among the crowd at
Marrickville that cheered us, and she came to each compartment and wished each
one tearfully, "Good Luck." We got on our boat, "The Argyllshire" "A.8," at
6in the morning, and immediately put out into the stream. Leaving the wharf
was a vivid experience, bands playing, crowded wharf, the breaking of Autumn
dawn, streamers flying and vociferous cheering. We lay at anchor in the harbour
for some hours, while launches crowded with people cruised around us, and the
passing steamers "Cock-adoodle-dooed" unceasingly.
We hauled up anchor about 4 in the afternoon, the boatb nose was
turned towards the Heads, and we were off. The last scene we saw was a small
launch which we had outpaced, falling away to the stern, on which was a broken-
hearted girl, sobbing her eyes out and despairingly waving a spiritless nand.
As we passed through the Heads and turned South, what memories flllea
our brains, what emotions pushed into our hearts. Our minds were haunted wi h
memories of Australia, the men who had lived and died for it in the P^
and the patriots who had striven to guide the young developing land through all
it s early trials.

CHAPTER 2.
STOMP - FRATOE - AKMENTIEKBS.
Of our life at Lark Hill Salisbury Plains, much might he written.
Ve, undoubtedly, were knocked into shape as a Brigade on that cheerless place.
We'obtained our horses while there, horses which some of the fellows were
destined to look after, and alternately ourse and love during the whole
progress of the war. The gunners received special instruction in gun laying
and for open warfare; the drivers were taught the dexterous use of brush and
currycomb, and the exact tone in which to pitch the accompanying and usual
grooming whistle; the battery staff learnt the many parts of their job, end
each battery learnt to work in unison like the combination of a go'od football
team, and in a similar manner the Brigade learnt to work together.
During the time we were in England, Dt. Colonel Pearce was replaced
by Lt.Colonel Spencer, and later he was replaced by Lt. Colonel Macartney.
The latter officer took the Brigade to Pranoe and remained in charge of it
through a long period of it's operations. But in passing, it is necessary to
IfltSFßOlate a word about It.Colonel Pearoe. This officer was in charge of
"The Warren" camp when the Brigade was formed, and exercised such caution in
the seleotion of the personnel of the Brigade. He encouraged take an
interest in our tasks, and used the motto which the "Yandoo" so worthily and
constantly maintained, "Esprit de Corps." One cannot forget him in such a
record as this, because he really picked the personnel of the Brigade.
Although Colonel Pearoe left the Brigade in England, through the disability of
age he has always preserved a tremendously keen interest in it's welfare: and
the'boys, and now that the Brigade has been disbanded he is shewing a marked
interest in the reunions.
At Lark Hill 7/e had our first aoquaintanoe with mud and snow and ice f
an aoquaintanoe tha.t was destined to grow into olose intimacy in Pranoe.
Many memorable incidents occurred during our training. The most
memorable being the periods of leave and our first journeys to London and the
provinces.
As a wartime measure the daylight saving act was in vogue and this
combined with the English Twilight, made the day exceedingly long, football was
first* favourite and many a match was played on th.fe 'hill adjacent to camp 17,
The Brigade T s Gymkhana took place in October and every event was
keenly contested.
At the end of 1916 we left England for the Front. Entraining at
Araesbury, went to Southampton, and there embarked for Le Haure. At Le Haure
we again entrained and journeyed through days and nights to Bailleul.
Alighting at Bailleul we hitched horses to the limbers, formed up into column
and marched to Strazeele where the var occupied "Billets" in
barns with pigs and fowls for company, and the guns were parked in fields that
were rapidly transformed into Bogs. Here it was that the batteries were
reformed and made into six guns batteries, viz:- 25th, 26th, 27th and 107bh.fr--
battery. The original 27th. was cut up and the even allotted to the other
batteries, and a new 27th. battery was formed out of the disbanded 2?rd.
Brigade. ' While at Strazeele we were introduced to "Yin Blancx, Yin Rouge,
Bock and champagne, "oeufs," chips ana other commodities dear to the digger s
palate. Snow was lying everywhere; mud was deep, horses were continually
bogging. Horse picquet duties in those days were far different to the
"larisez faire" methods observed at Lark Hill. The fellows were busy the
whole night long digging- out the horses which were bogging up to their planks.
sh§ins became like so much frozen mettle, nosebags like so much mud.
The village saw us every night. We as always, prodigal of
cur cash and were accordingly popular with the village people. Ye learnt to
knov; "Mamselle," and "Monsieur," Garcon and Madame, and we picked up our bits
of French which never got much farther than "tout de suite," "sil vous plait
"Un franc " "beaucoup chips," "no ton," "Hapoo' t etc., but we knew also that we
were nearing the Front. Armentieres was only a few kilometres away, and each
night could see the flares going up llluminatingthesky, and on calm days, see
the observation baloons poised above the line steadily watching movements.
Then often would hear fierce bursts of cannonading, telling us that the fl ays
of training were nearly over, that our time was nearly up. We had neared the
Arena* our coats would soon be off, and we would hop into the ring, bearing
before us the remembrance of Gallipoli and what our boys had done there, ana
acquit ourselves to the best of our abilities. They were eager days days in
which all were straining at the lashes* like so many dogs restrained from
pursuing their quarry, hut we did not have to strain long.
In thqse days, the early days of the New Year, (1917) Armentieres and
the sector immediately Before it was what the'boys termed a "Home. " It was,
in point of fact, a species of training ground where the students of warfare
were flrfet afforded the opportunity of putting their theperatlcal.knowledge,
gainfully acquired during many monotonous months, into practice.

Our visit to Cape Town, in most oases, was not so happy,-still we
managed a couple of visits ashore during the week that we were there and saw
many historic places. It was while we were nearing Cape Town that we first
heard the news of the death of lord Kitchener. It stunned us, of course we all
considered it at first a rumor, hut the wireless soon confirmed the news.
In Table Bay we were Joined by three other Australian Transports
tne Beltana," "Benalla," and "Marathon" and we left Table Bay together '
H.M.S. "Kent" escorting us, and we had again to settle down to another'phase
of tne voyage. As we went north of the African coast the heat gradually grew
worse, and most fellows slept on deck, anywhere would do for a "possv." The
nights began to get long on account of the "no lights on deck" order and most
went below to play cards or yarn. After Durban and The Cape, amateur
pnotograp'ners almost took charge of the ship. In every dark corner would be
some enthusiast straining his eyes oyer a developing- dish. It was during
tnese hot aays and nights in the tropics that one of the holds developed a
decided stench. Ho one could discover the cause, though the "stink" was
pretty well located. The only trouble was that it could not be confined to
its one plaoe, it permeates the hold and at times became unbearable. Erudite

The submarine alarms now occupied some of our time. Large guards
were posted, and at last it was decided that every man should wear a life belt.
It was at this stage of our life as a Brigade that "The Yandoo" first saw light.
From the first it was popular, ana the first editions were much too few in
number, men actually scrambled for a copy, only to read perhaps some little
part "blowing them up."
We called at the French Naval Base, Dakar, where the niggers amused
us diving for coins, but as we were not allowed ashore, our interest in the
place was not particularly keen. At Dakar" the "Kent" left us and went back
to Cape ±own and H.MS. "Swiftsure" accompanied us for the rest of the voyage.
p„>- 11 wU2I i B J mornin g. 11th.July, we saw first the green shores of
Cornwall, then of Devon, and later entered Plymouth Harbour. We had been
sixty three days on board, with only a couple of days on shore to stretch our
legs. It says a lot for the equable temperament of the Australian for his
innate sense of humor and his power of adapting himself to any circumstances
that during the whole of that time, foul weather or fine, cold or hot bad
food or good, two thousand troops crowded aboard, there was never a fie-ht
never a disturbance, nay, hardly so much as a petty quarrel.

his request for a '"/Voodbine," nearby, a man who from his circular color patch,

The fellows outside, separate into knots of two or three and saunter
billetwards, continuing the arguments that never end. t
A little later, standing in the darkness of the deserted street,
other and graver sounds arrest the ear. The splitting crack of an 18-pounder
reverberates hollowly among the houses down the Chapelle d'Arinentieres, in the
distance the ring of iron hoofs on the hard cobble road, and the rumble of
wheels tell of the Infantry transport on its way up to the trenches with rations
and material for the maintenance of the line. Suddenly a party of men swing
round the corner, the sound of their marching feet echoing in an eerie- manner
from house to house. Talking, grumbling, joking, they are off to carry out a
relief to the Front Line; a match struck by their Corporal, gleaming on his
"tin* lid" and pack end gasmask suggests an armoured knigfit of old.
As the night grows older, the town became more and more like a place
of tombs, long dead and forgotten. Oft-times one could walk the whole length
of its §ilent and deserted streets as completely solitary as if he paced the
weed choked ways of some African city of a bygone age.
The strange colored, instant blaze of a gun flash or the throbbing
incandescent glare of a verey light, made the quick following darkness, more
impenetrable; it seemed to press upon one from all sides like a sentient thing,
tangible and evil, and conjured up all the visions of spies and murders that
rumor spread broadcast In the months of January and February. To tread at
midnight, the narrow, twisting alleys that led from street to street, shut In
by high walls with dark doorways and forbidding tunnels leading to mysterious
courtyards, was to conjure up the vision of one of the many mysterious dis-
appearances of soldiers then so common.
In the light of day, free from the glamor and mystery of the night,
life in Armentieres is steely hard and business-like. The train routes are
crowded v *ith traffic, nearly all connected v/ith the business of war; men In
twos and threes and formed parties, some fresh from the trenches, their putties
protected by irregularly torn sand bags, their breeches smeared with clay,
tramp wearily back to billets, others with tunics open at the neck and hats
dn the back of their heads, stroll along from nowhere in particular, to
a destination just as vague, the inevitable cigarette adhering to their lower
lip or dangling lazily from the corner of the mouth,
General service waggons filled with brick rubble from the battered
Church near Chapelle d'Armentieres rattle along on their way to some wagon line.
An ambulance wagon driven at a great pace weaves a precarious way
through the traffic, giving one a glimpse of muddy boots protruding from under
the blankets sheltering shattered bodies. Presently along comes an essentially
Frenoh contrivance, a vehicle running on broad tired wheels and driven by a
Frenchman in very dirty clothes, followed by a great cylindrical tank on wheels
with a glass gage on the side. This "turn out" has a very intimate association
with the City's sanitary arrangements. Once seen, perhaps forgotten, onoe
smelt, never forgotten. Fortunately, however, it never enters shelled areas,
as the effect of a direct hit would be appalling.
If we turn to the right and follow train line, we soon come to a main
road branching to left, leading to Chapelle d'Armentieres. The buildings here
display dilapidation in varying stages. Here one can see the effect of modern
war. What was once a prosperous and good residential quarter of the town is now
little but ruins, a place to get rubble from to form horse lines.


These foraging expeditions allowed us to forget the bitterness of
the cold sleety rain and snow, and gave a spice to the operations. Almost
always, the story was told of the figure darting from one room to another in
the lonely dark house, the inevitable and übiquitous spy. The cold at this
time was intense. English papers averred it was the coldest winter within
human recollection, we believed them. After these long night pilgrimages to
the guns in rain, frost or snow, fingers and toes became almost insensible,
though every movement hurt. The cobble stones made riding and driving
dangerous, unsteady, nd frost made stones slippery and full of peril, but there
was that spirit of "devil may oare" exhibited through it all. It was all in
the days job,of course, we growled, fwhat soldier never growled!) but the
work seemed to get done just 1 the same.
"'e had only been in the line a few days, the 23rd. of Janusry when
tne 87th. Battery was spotted, registered by aeroplane, and shelled with
-* 2 _ £ nd 5.9 H.B. about 120 rounds being poured into the battery. One
p3Hi3§F=§«O.Came-ron wes killed, -nd two others woulded, Gunner J. Mitchell and

R.M.Fowler, 26th. Battery, hit in the leg while walking up to the line.
Immediately prior to taking over the sector, the infantry" had carried out one
raid, which had been successful from an intelligence point of view, though the
objective, the enemy front had been reached and found to be unoccupied.
It was now decided that raids should'be carried out on an average of
one per week. In order to permit of this .additional guns were brought to
bear on the sector and a redistribution of groups made. The 7th. Brigade now
became the centre group, the Bth. on the left 1 or north, the 175 th. R.F.A. on
the right or south, the whole being under the command of Brigadier General
Grlmwaae C.M.G.C.R.A. 3rd. Divisional- Artillery.
The brigade supported the 10th. Australian Infantry Brigade in a
successful raid on the 28th. Januaiy, and an unsuccessful one made by the
11th. Australian Infantry Brigade on Ist. February. A partially successful
raid was made on 19th. February by the 11th. Australian Infantry Brigade, but
the trenches were unoccupied and full of water. On the 24th. February, the
9th. Australian Infantry Brigade bombed and destroyed nine enemy dugouts in a
successful raid and captured some prisoners, while three days later, a
composite battalion in another successful raid, captured searchlights, machine
guns, stores etc., as well as seventeen prisoners. On 13th. March, the
11th. Brigade undertook another raid which was unfortunately not verv
successful.
It was by means of these raids that the Infantry gradually built up
the supreme confidence in their own powers that is one of the essentials in
the launching of operations on n large scale.
Briefly, their objects were these:- By- constant repitition to
practise our troops in methods of assault and build up and crystallise their
morale, to obtain material for the Intelligence section, documents, prisoners
etc., to harass the enemy and weaken his morale, to inflict casualties upon
i ■ * 9B * r °y ' n ts material. Raids meant an enormous amount-of work for the
Hillary in support, shooting had of course to be of extreme accuracy, errors
in synchronisation of lifts in the barrage reduced to the mere fraction of a
second s and as the operation usuallytook place in a limited section of trench,
many fresh registrations had to be made. 'Consequently, .they were of
inestimable value fro'm the view point of the work to be performed in th.e later
e-reat offensives.
After the raid on 13th.March, the situation remained quiet, the only
incident of note being the destruction by fire of the Brigade Headquarters in
the Rue Denis Papin. This fire was occasioned by a too large fire in one of
the rooms, and broke out after most had retired, but fires and floods were
now regarded as rather daily occurrences, and we were not deeply stirred at
Headquarters being burnt out.


Terrace houses are split in twain, an iron bedstead hangs suspended
over the flooring of the top story, a silent vritness to the breaking up of a
home. In all houses the, same desolation and devastation can' be seen. Shells
had torn walls away, revealing the furniture of the homes, dust stained and
rain swept, while the wearing apparel was still suspended on walls, indicating
that the occupants had made a hurried exit. Street after street it was the °
same story; the relentless search of the shell and the inevitable and oruel
pitiless result of war. '
A of hundred yards from the railway line we enter the grounds
of a splendid chateau. It stands in 4or 5 acres of land with massive fences,
ornamental trees and an imposing entrance, drives encircl-e the mansion. The *
house has evidently been the residence of a wealthy man, large staircases,
splendid large and numerous rooms, with carriage houses and gardening houses
at rear. This is, the first position the 25th. Battery occupied in Trance.
At the foot of the gardens you'look straight into the German lines, but to
prevent possible observation, it is crossed at intervals by screens of wire
netting and neutral colored cloth.
At this time the 'first essential of a battery position was
invisibility, particularly fromthe air, both from balloon and aeroplane. All
immediately set out to make their various gun pits harmonise with their
immediate surroundings as one blade of grass harmonises with another.
The batteries formally moved into their positions on the 17th.January
1917. The 25th. Battery as stated, occupied Chapelle d'Armentieres, the 25th.
were up a side street not far from barbed wire square, the 27th. were down the
Houplines Road in a large spinning mill, with its pits concealed among the
many buildings, and the 107 th. Howitzer Battery occupied the gas works in the
Rue d'Houplines.
By the 20th. the relief of the 175 th. Brigade was'complete, and the
command passed to Dieut.Colonel Macartney. The Divisional Artillery now
covered the front from the Dys F.iver on the north to a little village, 77ez-
Maoquart, on the little Road. The ordinary routine of trenoh warfare was
immediately embarked upon, -calibration of guns, registration of enemy front
line -and of special targets in support, subsidiary and back areas, preparation
for concentration at likely points liable to strong enemy assault, temporary
moves of one or two guns for special tasks, firing of S.O.S, barrages to repel
hostile raiding parties, support of our own infantry in small operations of
the same nature.
This meant that every day,a battery officer tramped to some
observation post close to the front line, and if the day was dull or the
registration required one of delioaoy, he went to the front line and registered
from there and observed from a hay of the trenoh. Often communications did
not exist, and battery telephonists had to lay out and take up some hundreds
of yards of wire under arduous and dangerous conditions. When one considers
that this routine went on day after day with monotonous regularity in raud,
sleet, snow and bitter cold, one appreciates the fact that the specialist had
no cushy job.
Indeed, throughout the whole time from January to the middle of March,
the gunners had a comparatively easy life, not so, however, the drivers. The
wagon lines were in the neighbourhood of Jesus Farm on the Armentieres - Croix
du Bac Road, quite four miles from the guns. The billets here were only party
constructed so the drivers and spare gunners as well as grooming horses,
washing vehicles, cleaning harness and carting ammunition,had to convert
themselves into a species of labor Corps. They laid down horse standings,
built kitchens and incinerators, forage rooms and mess huts, dug drains and
made roads. At night when frost had made the roads iron hard and slippery as
glass, there was the long Journey to the batteries. To sit for three, four,
five hours ih the pitchy dark, on the hack of a pulling horse, whose feet might
fly from unlet him at any instant, with the stiff leather of the reins bruising
fingers numbed with cold, faces stung by an ioy wind that hurt like the lash of
a whip, hoots almost frozen to the stirrup irons, toes impossible to move -
suoh was the common task of these men, week after weary week. Then at
midnight to arrive back "home" unharness the horses, and if not on "pioquet",
tumble into a rough bed of straw with the prospect of a morrow of feed and
water and groom, groom, feed and water.
But witb characteristic adaptihility, the drivers made some fine
homes at Jesus Farm. The wagons seldom went to the guns without the bringing
baok of. some furniture or domestic utensils for the "home."
The wagons would pull up in front of a likely looking establishment,
•a couple of the drivers and the gunners would disappear through the dark
gaping doorway, to return later with chairs, tables, pots, pans, oups etc.

CHAPTER 3.
PXiOESSTEERT - HESS IKES - YPF-3S - PASSCH3IIDABX3.
On the 16th, tnd 17th., the batteries left good nomes in
Armentieres and moved into positions further north to cover a front extending
from ''Pear Tree Farm" on the south to a cutting before St. Ives Post Office on
n ° rtll ' This move c i oS ed for the time being, the brigade's operations in the
Armentieres sector and took it into the preparatory stage of the operations
against Messines Ri&ge. ...
The tract of country on which were to be constructed the gun positions
was roughly in the shape of a very blunt wedge. Its base was on the Leinster
Road, which runs from the town of Heuve Eglise through Le Romarin to the
neighbourhood of Le Rossignol, its northern edge abutted oil the ridge whicn runs
from ITeuve Eglise east, to the crest of Hill 63, at that time the most lofty
ground in our possession opposite the Messines sector. Its southern boundary
was a line from Oostove Farm North Rast of Dele Telle Farm, its blunt point lay
along the Messines Road from Hyde Park corner to Le Bizet. At this period our
front line ran practically parallel to the Messines Road about 2,500 yards in
front The greater part of this area was flat and lowlying, rarely exceeding
11 elevation of 2o metres. Divided into farms of varying sizes, it was
criss-crossed in all directions by hedgeb and shallow ditches, with here and
there a clump of trees.
The batteries occupied the following positions in Ploegsteert
The 25th. Battery occupied four sunk gun pits near a laundry at
le Bizet the balance of two guns being at the Houplines as a detachea section.
* The 26th. Battery had four guns in a terraoe on the main road to the
north of Ploegsteert village, ana two guns in a farm.
The 27th. Battery had their whole six guns in a terraoe in Ploegsteert,
The 107 th. Battery had four guns in Delevelle Farm, ana two guns at
Boup ® S *j, rom the 17 th. March to 2nd. April, activity was normal, nothing
worthy of note occurred, save that the enemy became daily more active and
aggressive in the air, perhaps already being suspicious of the concentration.
On 2nd. April the 26th. Battery was shelled with aeroplane observation, 150
rounds of 5.9 being hurled at positTbns. Ho damage was done and no casualties
occurred to battery, though infantry and transport parties using the road,
suffered unfortunately, to some extent. Again on the sth., the same battery
again had 120 rounds of 5.9's let loose on them and again without loss, though
the transport suffered once more. The road intersection on which these
casualties occurred, from this date on, became a very dangerous locality and
was known as suicide corner. .... v
Onthe 6th. the 107 th. Battery was shelled with aeroplane observation,
and on the 9th. it was again bombarded with H. 2. and gas shall. -It was on this
latter day that the first decoration was won by the Brigade. After engaging
the battery for soma 3/4 of an hour, the enemy ceased fire, a fitter sergeant
and another man took advantage of the lull to visit a pit that had been damaged,
and while examining the gun carriage, hostile shelling recommenced, a 5.9 burst
on the pit and both men dropped unconscious from the shook and concussion.
From another position this was observed by it.Shelley,-Jones and
Gunner C. Klrton, ana although two hostile batteries were actively firing on the
position at the time, these two darted out and brought back the unconscious men
to safety. For this aot of bravery, Lt. Shelley-Jones was mentioned in
Divisional Orders, while Gunner Klrton received the Military Medal.
After these bombardments, the Howitzer Battery moved to a position
near the Ploagsteert Churchyard, the guns being under camouflage. This change
for the time, successfully baffled the enemy observers, and the batteries
oarried out ordinary routine work unmolested.
On the 14th. the brigade was relieved by the Bth. Brigade under
It. Colonel Allsop, ana on the 15th., the guns proceeded to the wagon lines
and remained there one night. The 14th. March however, will be SQ dly
remembered as it took from us one of our most popular and capable officers,
Major Patterson, commanding at the time, the 107 th. Battery. The waB
killed by a shell while Indicating the sector to an officer of the 108 th.
Major Patterson was beloved by the boys for his "bigness of heart and vision,
and respected by them for his undoubted ability.
The 16th. March saw the brigade en route for the rest area via
Wallou Oappel and longuenesse.arriving at Bournonville on the evening of. the
18th. Bournonville ie a small village to the west of St._oaier about five
miles from the mining town of Desvres, and some thirteen miles from Boulogne.
It is situated in a large cup-like depression amid hills, known as ueque
'pronounced oake) Valley, the whole area being well watered and thickly wooded.


By the end of the first week in May, the great concentration was
practically complete. On the 12th. May, commenced an artillery bombardment
that showed a gradually increasing intensity until the attack was launched
on 7th. June, a bombardment which, up to that time, for duration, weight and
thoroughness, had not been surpassed for so limited an objective.
The bombardment covering the major attack was timed to open at 3.10.
a.m. on the morning of 7th. June 1917, and punctually to the second, the guns
commenced firing. Every battery within hearing seemed to be having a hand in.
1 an( * 18 - pounders, blending with the boom of the heavies,
made the night a hideously memorable one. At the same moment that the attack
was launched, Sixteen mines at different points on the Messines, !7ytsohaete,
were simultaneously fired. The flashes from the innumerable guns, the lights
from star shells, Verey lights and signal rockets of all colors, made the nic-ht.
as bright as day.
The gas that the enemy had been putting so liberally over the lines,
fade the gunners' task a harder one, on account of the necessity of wearing
gas-masgg, The firing ceased at 10.30.a.m. and the guns were then nearly red
hot.. The batteries were again engaged during the day, in breaking up enemy
counter attacks, but our attack was splendidly successful, as the infantry
gained all objectives and held them.
Some 7,000 prisonere were taken from the enemy on this day, the
greater number of them being unwounded. Prom conversation with some of them,,
we learned that our attack was irresistible, a3 the infantry was on top of
them before they could recover from the staggering shook of the tremendous
explosions. The battery wagon lines were later moved to Kent Camp near the
junction of the Bailleul and Neuve Snglise Roads. It was here, on the night
of the 24th. of that month, that the brigade bad its first bombing raid. The
long days and short nights served admirably for the bombing planes. Hardly a
night passed but the heavy drone of Pritz's Gothas oouia be heard, sometimes
during the whole night from twilight until early dawn, and when the "Cargo"
was unloaded in the vicinity of the lines, the horse picquet would roar "stand
to your horses," and drivers in all stages of undress would dash for the horses:
and on several occasions it was necessary to temporarily evacuate the lines.
On 26th. June, the batteries drew out of action and on the 27th.
during an inspection. General Monash congratulated the brigade on its good work:
during the Messines offensive.
On the following day. General's Monash and Grimwade attended a sports
meeting arranged by the "Boys," but on the evening of the 2nd.July the batterie
again went into action on Messines Ridge.
A special word must be here said for the drivers for their clever wort
in getting the guns into action on account of the heavy nature of the ground
and the numerous muddy shell holes and the incessant shelling by the enemy.
The whole ridge looked a desolate sight. Every yard of ground bore
the trace of our artillery fire, end the wonder of it all, was how any living
thing could havs survived, the devastating onslaught. Ammunition had to be taken' 1
to the pits almost nightly, and the constant enemy shelling resulted in
casualties both by night and day.
On the 27th. July, pack horses were introduced, especially for getting
shells to the detached sections, and a considerable amount of labor was saved.
On the morning of the Ist. September, the batteries moved out for the
second spell which was e-xpected to cover a period of at least, four weeks.
- , Th ® first night was spent at Staples, a small village some three or
four KilSmetres from Hazebrouok, the men being billeted in the usual barns, and.
the horse lines being in open paddocks.
Upon the second day after a very long march of 25 mlle3, the
destination, Herok-st-Lievaln was reached. . The daily routine here was the
usual round of parades, grooming and harness cleaning, with piequets and guards:
to fill in the long hours of evening,
0n v 7th. September, after a very lengthy spell of five days,
preparations were hastily made for a return to the line the following morning.
It was an unexpected and unpopular change of arrangements, as the "Furphy"
had it we were to be out for "anything*Up to two moTfths," However, the
fellows took it as they took most things, with a curse and a smile, and at
8 O'clock on Bth, September, the batteries were-in column of route and the first
night gained Flechem, and the following night Morbeoque was reached. That
night the batteries were told they were going in for a warm corner, so the
fellows made the most of their opportunities and made merry with wine and song
in Aires and Morbeoque. •
Reveille sounded at 4.30 the next morning, pitch dark and in strange
barns and lines, but the batteries were soon in"oolumn of route"again, and that
day passed through Hazebrouok, Abeele and Renlnghelst, and Dickeblisch was
reached in the ldte afternoon of 10th. September.


, Dickebuseb wagon lines were in open and well worn paddocks
situated near the main Pickebusoh-Ypres Poad, and marked by dugouts and
humpies and tents that soldiers improvise out of nothing for their comfort

direct hits.


Oil the 22nd. September, the guns we re again advanced to Bellewaarde
Ridge, and so thick was the mud that dragropes and men were mostly employed,
horses being impracticable. These days were full of hard work for the
battery, no man was spared. The gunners were having a very difficult time,
little sleep, and endless toil, and one by one their old mates were being taken
from them. The drivers had little better, the nightly trips to the gun posit-
ions on the "packs" were nightmares! Myriads of muddy shell holes under foot,
bombing machines overhead, and on all sides the screeching of 4.2*s and 5.9 T s.
The total number of rounds fired by the batteries of the 7th. and Bth. Brigades
for the period from 12th. till 27th. September was 153,456 rounds.
At 60'Glock on the morning of the 4th. October, 1917, the 3rd. stage
of the Battle of Yores commenced, the guns beinr situated on Frecenberr Ridge,
and at 10.55.p .m. the batteries were instructed to cease firing.
On the 6th. the batteries again moved forward to Borry Farm near
positions were reconnoitred by Major T. James (25th.) and
Major Playfair (26th.) Owing to the shell-torn state of the country, great
difficulty was experienced in moving- the guns, and. rain also aggravated the
difficulties. Here pill boxes afforded cover for a few, though the major
portion of the personnel had to find shelter in shell holes and trenches.
Group headquarters also moved forward and occupied a pill box in order to
establish better communications with the batteries.
On the 7th. the weather was very bad and the enemy succeeded in
causing many casualties along the Ypres-Zonnebeke Road, as well as
disorganising the traffic, but the engineers were successful in their efforts
to make the road passable the same day. Owing to the number of casualties to
our guns, the brigade was forced to obtain the loan of nine 18-pounders and
four 4.5" Hows, from the 66th. Division, and they were brought into action on
the 7th. The enemy on Passchendaele Rid/re was all this time active, and
several guns were put out of action, but he again directed much attention to
the Main Road, realising, doubtless, that if he made that impassable, supplies
would be cut off from the batteries, as no alternative road was possible of
preparation.
Onthe Bth. at 7.30.a.m. the 4th. stage of the Battle of Ypres opened,
and shortly after 8 O'clock, lit. Rutledge (107 th.) who was going over with the
infantry was killed, and at 9.45 it was stated that all objectives had been
gained.
On the 10th. October, hostile artillery fire was above normal, with
the result that the rather long list of battery casualties was increased.
Guns v/ere also reported among the casualties. Cn account of the severe
rruelling undergone by the group in this sector ,48 trench mortar personnel v/ere
posted to the group for duty as gunners, but as these men were only partially
trained, the work and responsibility of the gunners was only relieved to a
small extent.
At 5.25. on the morning of the 12th,the sth. stage of the great battle
was begun, but this stage proved unsuccessful, one of the great difficulties
being the amount of mud and water. The attacking parties often being waist
high in water.
During this period, the batteries were subjected to a great shelling,
resulting in a large number of casualties. The numbers of gun layers and
telephonists were, by this time, depleted to such an extent,that in case of
several batteries, only two or three were left. It was impossible to fill
responsible positions by partially trained men, and as a consequence, it
was necessary for the highly trained specialists to do greatly increased work.
In some batteries, drivers were doing work as signallers and as gunners, and in
many instances, officers were acting- as gun layers in the endeavour to keep all
eruns in action. Throughout the whole operation, drivers were almost
continuously at work in the most difficult and dangerous task of packing
ammunition to the guns. In no case however, was it necessary to report that
the group could not maintain the quantity of ammunition which it was ordered
should be up at the guns.
Drivers and gunners were alike careless of danger, being concerned
only in maintaining as many guns as possible of the batteries in action.
On the 20th. the enemy subjected the battery positions to a
tremendous bombardment, with 8", 5.9", 4.2" and 77in. in H.B. Shells rained
at the rate of at least -60 per minute for approximately an hour. A large
quantity of ammunition was destroyed, but the casualties were light, due
largely, to the ingenuity of the men in finding cover in the pill boxes
captured fromthe enemy in the previous attack.
As a result of this shooting and the bad weather,the ground in the
vicinity of the batteries was rendered a quagmire, while the roads in the rear
of the positions were almost totally destroyed. The shell holes had rapidly
filled with water, and the sruns appeared as though they rested on little islands.

On the 9t"h. February the brigade assisted the 10th. Infnntry Brigade
"by covering a successful raid on Wameton. The rate of fire on this occasion,
was 75 rounds H.E. and 25 rounds shrapnel, per battery, per hour. One battery,
the 27th. fired a total of 636 rounds in the 45 minutes allotted for the hop
•over" and return. From information gleaned from prisoners, an offensive was
exoected from the enemy and a short bombardment of H.E. and gas was anticipated.
In"preparation the batteries had orders to "stand to" from 3.a.m. on several
occasions, and at the same time the pioneers were carting back everything likely
to be of service to the enemy.
In the air, the allied aircraft were markedly superior, and this
superiority was commented upon in all observation reports. Though the enemy
rarely succeeded in crossing our lines for bombing purposes, our machines,
nightly if the weather conditions were propitious, invaded his territory, and
the reports of the exploding bombs could be distinctly heard. The brigade
also instituted a scheme of building "Dummy" gun pits adjacent to '^ ie
oamouflae-ed pits, with the object of 'drav/ing the enemy fire. In anticipation
also of a tank offensive from the enemy, tne gunners were re-instructed in
"BB S B sights" laying.
On Ist. March, General Birdwood paid an unceremonial visit to the
batteries and expressed satisfaction with what he saw.
Enemy artillery was at times, particularly heavy, and on several
occasions, 1,000 rounds were reported as having fallen within the group sector.
On the 12th. March the sth. A.F.A. Brigade relieved the brigade, which
moved back to wagon lines at Sec Bois near Straze.ele, the scene of our first
encampment in France. '
TThile passing through Nieppe and Bailleul, the enemy shelled the towns
with a H.V. 24 c.m. gun, but the brigade was fortunately out of the line of
fir e.
The usual "Rest" schools of instruction were speedily introduced, and
special attention given to open warfare. A large signal school was established
ten men from each battery attending. The "Cooees" the 3rd Australian Div.
Pierrots commenced on the 14th., a series of entertainments lasting a week, in
the Hall Sec Bois. This troupe came along for the special benefit of the
Div.Artilleiy who had had very little opportunity of seeing concert parties
while in the line. To show the appreciation of the Boys for a little "music
and mirth," in the midst of the drab surroundings of war, the "House Hull"
notice was posted up each night.
Arrangements were also made for brigade sports and for polo matches,
in fact, recreation of all sorts was the order of the day. The percentage of
men on "Blighty" leave was greatly inoreased; as the brigade was in reserve,
as many as three battery men per day going on leave to England for -the usual
periob of fourteen days.
Then suddenly, "the enemy gave the Allies the greatest shock of the war.
Inthe Brigade the blow fell on Saturday, March 23rd. and a blow indeed it was.
A blow that was to shake and terroise the world only second to the first
stunning shock of the announcement of war. The Saturday just mentioned, had
been proclaimed a half holiday, and a large number of local leave passes had
been issued. The lucky owners of these passes were well on their way when a
despatch came from headquarters giving orders for the batteries to move off at (
4.p.m. It was then 2 O'clock. Heavensi only two hours to pack up a brigade
and be off! Several guns were at ordnance in the vicinity of Eeuve Egliso,
many kilometres distant, and a mounted orderly was despatched to hurry men and
guns back. They arrived after the main column had left. All leave was
Stopped. Men who had not actually reached England were brought back, but as
the brigade was on the march, they floated about for days before being able to
find their units. The brigade was on the road again. And why? Rumor had
been persistent for a day or two previous to the opening of the enemy's big
offensive. Signs were not wanting of the foe's activity. Even in the
neighbourhood of Sec 3ois, enemy shelling could be seen and heard in the
distance, Hazebrouck, Merris and Meteren each receiving a share of hostile
ironmongery, while night and morning, Le Bassie was subjected to a constant
"rueiling. Bailleul! The seventh's old time friend! had been evacuated for
3ome days, , ~
The clock tower, onthe Hotel de Ville, a most noticeable feature of the
town was hit by a shell and had crashed into the Market Place. This"hit" was
read'as an omen of disaster by the inhabitants, who hurried away in that
frightened, heartbreaking pitiable manner known only to refugees from war areas.
Bailleul had been a sort of home during the past year, but now the shops
were shattered, and the goods strewn about the streets, brick du£& and broken
bricks littered the pavements. Desolation had stepped into the City and
gripped in its black and cruel hands, the heart of the one-time, gay and
prosperous town.

HEILLY - TILLERS BRETOHHEAOX - BRAY - P3RONNE - HER TILLY
BELLIOOHRT - HOKTBREHAIN - BUS3ICKY - MAZEMHEDI.
In conjunction with the 3rd. Australian Div. Infantry patrols, the
guns were taken into position in some fields to the north and east of Heilly„
the guns were unlimhered, the poles of the firing hattery wagons were dropped,
alongside their respective guns for ammunition supply, gun limbers were
unloaded and retired to .a spot not far from Franvillers, where forward limber
lines were established.
In readiness for an immediate move, horses always stood by fully
harnessed, and communication was continually maintained with the guns both by
day and. night. It was a time of great moment, great anxiety, the personnel
of the brigade knew but little of previous happenings, and "hold on "or forty
eight hours at all costs" was a warning and an indication of "breakers ahead.""
Batteries were given a full hand to engage all opportunity targets
end to seize every opportunity of killing the enemy as well as to harass him
and his operations day and night. The brigade quickly adapted itself to
these conditions and the position was soon firmly established.
The expected attack came to pass on the 30th. Kerch, when fritz
prepared for a further advance on our right by putting down a very extensive
area shoot with artillery otv all kinds. A battalion of the 10th. Australian
Infantry Brigade was holding this sector whioh withstood the brunt of the
attack . The 7th. Brigade batteries lent valuable help in smashing up the
attack by switching their guns around 70 degrees right and pouring an
enfilading fire into the masses of German Infantry which we re making every
effort to break through. Several companies of the enemy succeeded in reaching-
our .front line, but were subsequently driven out by the 3rd. Australian Div.
Infantry. Fritz suffered heavy losses without gaining any territory.
On the Ist. April, Brigade Headquarters was very heavily shelled, and
unfortunately, the C.O.lt.Col.W.Churchus D.S.O. the adjutant Capt. G.J.
Greenshields and the orderly officer, lieut K.C.Radford, were killed by the
same shell. That afternoon, a new headquarters staff was appointed,
consisting of It.Col.T.B.W.James D.S.O. C.O. It.R.R.Smith M.C. adjutant and
lieut. W.R.Bates orderly officer.
During these, days, the last few days of March and the earlydays of
April, the batteries constantly shelled the enemy. Hundreds of rounds were
puured over every day and the guns were never silent nor the men ever silent.
The villages were, of course, deserted,and as the domestic animals and birds,
pigs and chickens and such like were roaming around homeless and friendless,
the "Wagon-line Kings" appropriated them and made profitable use of them. It
was just as well that Providenoe had sent them along,as many a time the "lads"
had known what it was to be downright hungry, and also the "menu" chiefly
eonaisted of bully and biscuits. Chicken -made a pleasant break.
These were busy days for the batteries, day and night they poured
the shells into Fritz and gave him no peace. Three hundred shells bad to be
fired each day by each battery in addition to special shopts and gas
bombardments ordered, whioh were frequent. .
The 21st. March marked "The end of cavalry Captain Baron Ton
Riohthofen." This account is by .Flight lieut,Malcolm Sheehan, an Aussie.
"As you know we are a two seater squadron - R.E. Bs, the Fords of the
air. We are what is known as a Corps squadron, that is we oarry out
corps work - reoonnaisenoe, photography, "bomb-dropping, low strafing,
contact patrol, flash reoonnaisenoe, co-operation with artillery and
infantry and any special jobs whioh Corps B.Q. require. For months we
have been promised better machines and some day they will turn up. You
will see our special feature is not aerial- combat, but although only a side
line,one never does a patrol without a sorap or mix-up with a Hun or Huns
of some description. The reason it is a side line is that officially we
are not supposed to look for bother*and our machines are not the
healthiest in the world to take into a mix-up. last Sunday we had a
day out. Onthe down patrol, my Flight Commahder met three Hun soouts,
well over Hun-land. After a tidy sorap he sent one down in flames, the
other two pushed off and we got home safely. At 11.a.m. two-of our
machines were taking photos of the Corps Front when five Hun red triplane
soouts declared war. The leader who was very bold left his formation and-
after a short mix-up with one of our busses, was seen to have more than
his issue of .303 and go down and crash on our side. The other machines
did not fancy further scrap on our side,- so they beat it for home and
reported this. Hext we heard by telephone that the Hun triplane whioh-
was seen to crash, was none other-than Cavalry, Captain Baron Von Riohthofen.

The attitude of the enemy remained quiet on the whole, excepting the!
moraine of 9th. June when he "put over" a heavy bombardment of ras end H.E.
upon the aivisonal front. This bombardment from the enemy was in support of
his attach upon the French between Hoyon and liontdidier. However in spite'
of the tremendously heavy concentration of gas the brigade was subjected to,
no casualties, luckily, were reported. _ .
During this period, defensive measures were pusned ahead in
preparation of I German attach against Amiens. Deep gas-proof dug-outs were
constructed at battery positions into which a detachment could be withdrawn
during a oreliminary bombardment. Hear battery Portions were selected and
reconnoitred to cover the AUhigny end Blangy-Tronville lijesof defence while
"notes on withdrawal" were Issued by the brigade, laying down the procedure
to be followed bv batteries in case the front line system was driven in
to be followed o £ gpaniah influenza. fortunately however, in a mild
form, possessed the Brigade, and although there were numerous oases of
sickness, the evacuations were few.
On 4th. July a noteworthy operation took place. The 4th, 11th &
15th. Australian Infantry Brigades attacked on a front of approximately
7 000 yards between the Sonme and Tillers Brettoneux, and captured the enemy
positions to an average depth of 3,500 yards, taking Hamel, Vaire and Hamel
Woods. Tanks and aeroplanes successfully co-operated, whilst a few
companies of American Infantry also took part.
On the same day, the 7th. I.Brigade under a barrage put down by
the 3rd. Australian Div. Artillery, advanced their lines slightly astride the
main St. auentin-Amiens Road to conform with the general line and thefollowing
week by silent operations end daylight patrol work drove the enemy out of his
entire forward system including Monument Wood. The brigades guns afforded
effective support during these minor operations by increased harassing fire
and by engaging all enemy movement and opportunity targets. Onths 16th.July,
the Pouilloy position ua3 taken over from the 4th. Australian Division.
The Howitzer batteries continued to fire gas on all occasions when
the weather was favorable. _ , , t ,
August was a particularly strenuous one witn the A.I.P and the
brigade was kept very busy. The first part of the month from Ist. to 7th.
was a period of preparation. The policy of direotlng continued harassing
fire upon the enemy was maintained. The utmost., seorecy was observed.
Ammunition was carted by night and carefully hidden at th ® f
near Hamel. The task was a particularly hazardous one, as these positions
could he easily seen by the enemy in daylight. ~
Everything was brought to concert pitch for the attack on the Bth.
August, and the eneSiy was quite oblivious of the impending operations. The
order if the day issued by It. Can.Sir John Honash, the Aussie Commander, ran
as follows
Australian Corps.
Corps Headquarters,
7th. August, 1918.
"To the soldiers of the Australian Army Corps." ,
Por the first time in the history of this corps all five Australian
Divisions will tomorrow engage in the largest and most important battle
operation ever undertaken by the Corps. . na
They will be supported by • exceptionally powerful Artillery and
oy Tanks and Aeroplanes on a scale never previously attempted. The
full resources of our Sister Dominion, The Canadian .orps, will al
operate on our right, while two British Divisions will guard our left
flank The many successful offensives which the Brigades and Battalions of
this Corps have so brilliantly executed during the past four months have
been but the prelude to, and the preparation for, this greatest and
culminating effort.
Because of the completeness of our plans and dispositions, of the
magnitude of the operations, of the number of troops employed and of the
depth to which we intend to overrun the enemy's positions, this battle
will he one of the most memorable of the whole war; and there can he no
doubt that, by capturing our objectives, we shall infliot blows upon the
enemy which will make him stagger, and will bring the end appreciably
Beare j* entertain no sort of doubt that every Australian soiaier will
worthily rise to so great an occasion, and that every man, imbued with
the spirit of victory, will, in spite of every difficulty
confront him, he animated by no other resolve than a grim determination
to see through, to a clean finish, whatever his task may be.


I offer my heartiest congratulations and warm thanks to all ranks of
the Australian Corps, though I feel that whatever words I may use, all
Australians realise that "Victory is her own reward." Tt was a splendid
performance and as fine a feat of arms as any that even this war can
produce.

Fourth Army:-
August Bth. was a great day for the Artillery.
Will you please convey to all ranks of the Artillery under your
command, my admiration and appreciation of their work.
I consider the following points to be particularly noteworthy:-
I. The manner in which difficulties were overcome in putting guns and
ammunition into position.
2. The aocuracy and effect of the barrage fire and heavy artillery
bombardment without previous registration.
3. The effective counter-battery work'.
4. The bold and suocessful way in which the advance of the Artillery in
support of our Infantry was carried out.
In forwarding this to you, I wish to add my sinoerest thanks and
appreciation of 77oifc and energy displayed by those under your command
in carrying out of the many tasks which confronted you.
My best congratulations and wishes for continued success to you and

The brigade took up a position north of the SommeJ on 21st. Auguso,
between Bray-Gorbie Road and Malard Wood in support of an attaok by the
3rd• Division Infantry on Bray.
On 22nd. August, the barrage was opened at 4.45.a.m. The Infantry
captured and held the high ground north and west of Bray. Orders were
received to take up an advanced position in support of a further attaok on
Bray. Some of the batteries actually got to their positions, but owing to
a powerful counter attack on the front on our left held by the "Tommies,"•
Fritz had succeeded in regaining ground. The situation caused some anxiety
until the section of Australian Infantry from their newly won trenches, cut
in behind the advanced Fritzsand cut them off,this smart move of the Aussies
added more prisoners to their bag.
On the morning of the 24th. at l.a.m. another barrage was firod, and
with this support, our 3rd. Div, Infantry took Bray, on the following morning
at 2.20. another barrage was put down so that the infantry could capture the
hills beyond Bray,in the valley 107 th. Battery had four men killed and several
wounded.
Everything being: succesful, orders were received for the Brigade to
move forward, but owing to the density of fog, the gun teams had some difficult
In locating the guns. The guns came into action on the hill to the east of
Btinehem, hut no shots were fired. Before midday another move was made in
the vicinity of the Bray Railway Station which was on the east of the town, but
before reaching Bray, the guns and teams had to negotiate a fast trot on a
etretoh of road for a couple of miles which was in full view of the enemy,
fortunately no shells fell near. Passing through Bray, everybody got a small
issue of gas, as the village was reaking with it.
On the 27th. our next position to be occupied was to the north of
Suzanne, this village was, prior to Fritz's drive in March 1918, G.H.Q. for
British Army. On the morning our advance oarried the Brigade to a position
well to the east of the village.
About noon on the 29th. saw the guns again on the road, this time our
course ran along side the River Somme to Curlu and we came into aotion to the
east of this.that was , as only a few bricks mark where the village once stood.
This description also applies to Hem and Clery. It was a common sight to
see at almost every vantage point that covered the approaches to these places.

The oheers that were sent up by the troops around could he heard for
miles. the 17th. the guns were pulled into a positiorf a little north west
of Hervilly at night, ammunition had heen carted to this possy the preceding
day. Throughout, this was anything hut a comfortable place on account of the
continuous rain and the heavy strafing Fritz put down of H.E. and gas.
fText morning at 5.20.a.m. the barrage was fired and at 7.a.m. t:he , guns
were moved forward jSst to the west of Hesbecourt, and continued to fire in the
barrage. barrage was fired at 5.40.a.m. on the 21st. with good results,
causing Fritz to retreat to his carefully prepared positions in the Hindenburg
lin6 ' On the 24th. the guns were pulled bach to Tincourt and spelled till
the 28th. At 7.p.m. the brigade moved off in the direction of Fonssoy whioh
place was reached after midnight after many halts caused through the heavy
traffic on the roads. The different batteries had been told off to report to
the various infantry battalions of the 3rd. Australian Division. At 6.30.awp.
on the 29th. the advance for that morning did not adventu-te on account of
failure of the American organisation in the "mopping up" process. On
particular occasion, the Americans were to follow up the barrage and reach the
first objective, the 3rd. Div. Infantry were to go through then and take the
2nd• ana 3rd. objective. The Amerloans went on as the barrage lifted and
reached their objective, but through the faulty mopping up, (this mopping up
process is the bombing of dugouts, smashing enemy machine guns end generally
demolishing strong posts and rounding prisoners. A very large party are
always being detailed off for this job in an advance.) they lacked thoroughness
in this department so much so, that when our infantry moved up to go through
the Americans, they had to fight all the way to the first objective instead of
simply walking up to it, owing to all the strong points being strongly maned by
the enemy who had oome out of oonoealment. The Americans lost heavily, they
had the Huns not only in front but at the back as well.
After the batteries had been "standing to" for over ten hours right up
with the Infantry, they were ordered to take up a position about a mile ana
half to south east of Ronssoy. After being exposed to enemy machine gun
quite a number of casualties from this weapon were reported among the personell
The same open warfare methods, as prevailed in August, were again made
U3S ° f * The weather throughout September was changeable and showery, though
fine days occurred at intervals. The ground was good and dried quickly, so
that the rain did not hamper the fighting to any great extent. The open
warfare methods proved far more exacting than trench warfare and towards the
end of the month after four months of almost continuous and heavy fighting the
effect was beginning to be seen on men and horses and a good rest was badly
need9d " October opened, the batteries were meeting strenuous fighting in
the vicinity of Bony, whioh place was captured by the 10th. and 11th. A.I.
3rd , October, the brigade fired a barrage at 5.50.a.m. and then
moved forward to a position'between Bony and Bellicourt, where the fighting of
the previous couple of days had occurred. It was perhaps the worst sight that
one could have looked upon, every where were piles of dead bodies,
unfortunately the greater number being those of the Americans.
Being on S.O.S. work only, the brigade withdrew to Villaret on sth.
October. October, freeh positions were taken up in the valleys
north, east and south east of Wianoourt, while on the road to take up their
position, the 107 th. battery was heavily shelled and suffered casualties to men
Und Hnder the cover of a barrage whioh started at 5.20.a.m. the villages
of Premont, Ilontbrehain and Brancourt were captured on the Bth, October, a™
when the towns were entered, many of the inhabitants emerged from hiding places
in cellars. Their gratitude for their relief knew no bounds, as for four
weary heart-breaking years they had been under the heel of the German.
On the 13th. the brigade took up positions in the Busigny area, and
while here, the enemy shewed considerable artillery activity as well as deluging
the batteries with gas.
Orf the 14th. the guns were moved to a position north of ana
at 5.20.a.m. on the 17th. the barrage was opened, and during the afternoon, the
brigade took uo a position to the north of la Hale Menneresse. From here, two
small barrages were fired, and on the morning of the 19th. a new position was
taken up to the north east of B'Arbre ae Guise whioh was reached about midday.


"The 30th. saw us once mora on the "Wallaby" this time we passed
through Hem and came in action about midway between Hem ana Clery. The
impromtu bridges, the railway line and the traffic on the roaa, drew a very
intense fire fromthe enemy who was no aoubt, getting excellent observation
from Mont St. Quentin. Whilst shooting in the barrage for the attach on
Clery, the 27th. battery were unfortunate in having twenty four men gassed,
the 25th. battery also lost heavily by receiving a direct hit on one of their
guns by a hostile shell, resulting in the death of three and severely
wounding several others.
During all these operations the 7th. F.A.B. was acting in close
support to the infantry covering advances by creeping barrages, engaging
opportunity targets and all movements and putting down all enemy concentrat-
ions.
The 2nd. German Guards Division newly brought into the line, offered
a stout resistance to our advance, but the resistance was finally broken down
on Ist. September after very severe fighting. The Brigade's guns afforded
excellent support on these occasions, firing continuously from daylight till
dark, and time and again broke up enemy counter attacks.
The brigade lent valueable support In the 2nd. Australian Divisions
attack on Mont St. Quintln, although this famous hill was off the sector.we
were covering, excellent shooting was done, and severe casualties Inflicted
on the enemy in his retreat from the Mont. In this open warfare, all the
O.P. (observation post) parties were armed with rifles for sniping purposes.
One battery commander pjit several knoohes on the stock of his rifle for the
enemy machine gunners he bagged during his ramble well forward looking for
targets.
The country round about Clery was in a very much battered condition,
it being the old front line In 1916 & 17, the ground was literally covered
with graves of French "soldats" who had paid the supreme sacrifice.
August gave the brigade its first opportunity of putting into
practloe its early training at Lark Hill in offensive open warfare. After a
long spell of trenoh warfare, minor mistakes were made at first but were soon
rectified, and towards the end of the month, August, batteries had become
quite efficient in this new mode of warfare.
The operations called for great endurance on the part of both men
and horses, the former displaying splendid qualities of courage ana
oheerfulness on all oooasions,
August 1918 will long be remembered as the greatest month in the
history of the Australian Corps when its fine divisions combined to reap the
full results of all the hard and wearisome fighting astride the Somme 3inoe
Apr 11.
- During the first half of September the brigade did not take a large
part in eotive operations. After the barrage which started at 5.a.m. on
the Ist. September, the guns were moved to a slope of a hill north east of
Clery. Hext morning the usual barrage being fired the guns did not advanoe
but engaged opportunity targets. There .were "Furphles" in the air that a
spell was on order, and this came about on 4th. September when camp was
shifted back to the west of Suzanne. This was a real treat, as the brigade
had been continually in aotion for fifteen days. The country traversed, the
amount of ammunition expended, and the excitement crowded in these days/made
it seem more like a couple of months. However, the spell afforded all'hands
an opportunity of a decent wash and a chat hunt and a change of under clothing
Here was experienced perhaps, the only taste of a truly Aussie
thunder storm, and when it had passed over, the horse llne3 were one huge
lake, the horses standing up to their knees In water. It might here he
mentioned that the 107 th, Battery did not have the pleasure of this spell
they were In aotion to the east of Peronne, but joined the brigade a couple
of days later near Clery, to whloh place we moved on the 6th. September. We
had another spell here until the Bth, every body had bivvles in shell holes
and old trenches.
On the Bth. the brigade were on the way for Courselles, about five
miles to the east of Peronne. Here, training for open warfare was carried
out again. During this spell, several Inter battery football matches were
played. At this time, the nights were unusually clear, and of course, enemy
Gothas took advantage to nightly scattered bombs about the countryside. Our
air methods by now had undergone a change for the better, the authorities
had instituted high night flying soout machines for dealing with the bombing
pests.
The night of the 13th. saw two Gothas brought down in flames by our
dare devil pilots. These Fritz's planes were caught in the rays of 82 of our
search lights, and with such light on these targets, our scouts who were above
in the darkness, pnured in incendiary bullets with the above results.

H.Q. Fourth Army,
14th. October, 1918.
This proved to be -the last barrage the brigade took part in which
lasted six hours, but there were sundry shoots during the balance of the day
and on the morning following (the sth.) at 5.p.m. the guns were pulled out.
On the 6th. November the brigade retired to Montbrehain, this
withdrawal which took place in heavy rain was a most unoomfortable operation
but in the light of a possible "spell," the unpropltlous elements were
speedily overlooked and forgotten.
The position at Sambre et Oise Canal was destined to be the last the
brigade was to occupy in the "Great War."
Rumors of peace and an Armistice were flying everywhere, falling from
every tongue, but still, so extraordinarily disappointing had boon "good news"
at all times, that the rumors were hardly credited.
At night, allied bombing planes passed overhead in droves and on one
or two occasions even enemy planes graoed the neighbourhood with their
presenoe. But they were like the last Roses of Summer, soon to fade and
disappear for ever.
At midday on 11th. November, upon the dismissal of the stable parades,
It was given out that an order was to be read and all who oared to remain to
hear the reading could do so. As dinner was ready, however, many rushed away,
helter skelter for their dixies. To those who remained fell the glad tidings
that the Armistice was offlolally announced but so great was habit, so great
the needs of the moment, and so casual the Australian, that he only made a
dash for his place in the queue at the oook house, and that's dlniomj
So ended the brigades part in breaking down the resistance of the enemy
A part that, we hope, was dona nobly and well. A part that was done, for the
love of Austra!ia and Empire; a part that was done, we hope, to make Peace
secure upon this earth for generations.
The brigade had, like all Australians, tried to "do its bit," That
"the <l bit" was well done, may be gleaned from the congratulations received from
brigade and oorps commanders and the respect and friendship gained from the
infantry and other arms of the service.
Our time during our sojourn in uontbreham was taken up mostly
preparing for the "All too frequent" Spit & Polish Parades, this was undoubtedly
the cause of so much discontent within the Brigade at this time, onoe this was
rectified things were smoother running.
After parade, football was easily first favourite, and, some games
resulted.
The A.l.F.Educational scheme was now introduced,but being in the
embryo the nights were only set aside for lectures whioh were well attended.
The 12th. December brought a change, we were on the road ono'a. again
Hautmont was our destination, it being just a little south of Maubuege this
latter town was beseiged by the Huns In the early days of the war, the'fortress
held out for eleven days and then surrendered wiih 49,000 French soldiers but
not before the French had blown up all the Forts,
Hautmont was onoe a town of considerable importance for its
manufacture but alas.' Nothing remains hut empty sheds and smokeless ohimney
stacks Fritz having appropriated all the machinery for his own use in
Germany.
The 3rd# Div.Artillery Y#M.C#A# soon established a oinema and a
couple of weeks late f r our own Concert Party "The Courtiers" "bloomed." These
were the real live faotors that kept the idle minds out of misohief.
4 4.C. x P l 6 Batter y Dai *oes *ore a huge suooess, but the one thing upper most
in the minds of all was. who was to be on the first quota. However, the
7 rS ii mon left the village on the sth#Maroh en route for Aussie
via the camps in England.


The 11th. March saw the balance of the "Brigade mailing for LobbeS
which was to be our last home In Belgium till repatriated, but the friends lef
behind in Hautmont weretoo great an attraction for some of the members of the
7th. so much so, that it was only on pay days that the Batteries could report
a fall muster.
Here again, the Aussie's love for seeing something fresh took a hold,
Touring parties were off in all directions. Many a time a pass for thre©
days to Srussell, a two hours Journey, (sometimes no official passes at all)
would find the holder touring through the remote parts of Belgium or the
occupied territory of Germany, and even as far as Southern Prance and- Italy,
•only to return 14 or 15 days later and then only perhaps, on account of the
treasury being depleted*
Batches of 100 or more men continued to be repatriated 'fortnightly,
so smoothly was "the. demobilization machine running that ' the 30th.April
saw the balance of' the Brigade listed on the 44th. Quota and on the Ist.May
the departure from Chaleroi took place. A horse box truck as in days of
yore was allotted to 16 men. The army ration lavishly supplemented, by the
_iustralian Comforts Funds goods .was placed aboard for the two days Journey to
Le Havre - the A.I.F. base In France,- where the order on arrival was baths,
changing of clothing and handing in of equipment. Here the handling of such
huge bodies of humanity was ia revelation in the matter of speed, the business
like methods in comparison to the usual Military routine was distinctly
pleasing*
After the usual stay of five or six days, blighty was reached only
to stay another six to eight weeks for about to be allotted.'
By a singular coincidence, the first and second Quota of the Brigade
(about 200 men) sailed for Australia on the "Borda" and "Zealandia" on the
11th. May, it being exactly three years to the day that this Brigade left
God's own country, Australia*
The last batoh of the Brigade sailed in the "Karmala on 2nd* July
and arrived in Sydney on 18th. August 1919, and as the discharges were
available immediately, it sounded the death knell from a military point of
view, of the existence of the 7th. F.A.B. but the social side of the Brigade
for the future, Will be well cared for by the Brigade reunion clubs of
Sydney and Melbourne*
We do not wish to add laudatory remarks about ourselves, and our
Brigade, of which we have always been proud, but we must say that the
camaraderie of all ranks, the "esprit de corps" manifested at all times in the
Brigade, will remain a thrilling memory and lead us to the fond hope that the
same good feeling of kinship and comradeship may be awakened in our own loved
land Australia* And as all arms of the servioe then fought to conquer a
redoubtable foe, so may we all, in the days of peace and pro,sperity # learn to
foster and kindle and engender a noble feeling of brotherhood among our own
people.
' , W© went to France to fight for Australia and the Empire and we have
returned with Peace and Yictory to Australia.
0* may we all live at peace with each other and have one ideal, one
purpose - betterment in happiness and prosperity of Australia and her people.
