PREFACE.
In pursuance of the policy of reviewing and epitomizing for the information
of Quarantine Officers and others interested in the subject recent literature
concerning diseases with which the Quarantine Officer may in the course of his
ordinary duties be called upon to deal, Dr. Cox has collected all recent infor-
mation concerning Typhus Fever and Acute Anterior Poliomyelitis. Each
of these diseases demands attention at the present moment.
Typhus Fever becomes epidemic in Northern China every spring, and a
severe outbreak occurred during 1914 in Japan. The unusual conditions
arising from the existence of a state of war have greatly aggravated this
disease, and it is not unlikely that the great movements of human population
occurring after the termination of hostilities will tend to spread this disease
still more widely.
Acute Anterior Poliomyelitis has recently been extensively prevalent in
America, and past experience justifies the apprehension that it may make its
appearance in epidemic form in Australia at almost any time in the near
future.
New Zealand has already suffered, having had a serious outbreak during
1916. S

I. TYPHUS FEVER.
I. THE DISEASE IN PAST AGES.
In following the history of typhus fever during past ages, it has been
found convenient to take that of the British Isles first as an example ; and
then to follow the course of the disease throughout the Continent of Europe
and the rest of the world generally, so far as it is possible to do so.
Great Britain and Ireland.
The prevalence of the disease in Great Britain and Ireland has been
closely followed by Creighton, and recorded in the second volume of his
“ History of Epidemics in Britain.” He shows how, prior to the year 1666,
the presence of typhus fever in Great Britain and Ireland was dominated by
the endemicity of plague, which “ had been continuous in England from
1348, at first in general epidemics all over the country in certain years,
thereafter mostly in the towns, either in great explosions at long intervals,
or at a moderate level for years together. The final outbreak, in 1665, which
was one of the most severe in its whole history, had followed on an unusually
prolonged period of freedom from plague in London, and was followed, as it
were, by a still longer period of freedom, until at last it could be said that the
plague was extinct.”
But, though so overshadowed, there can be no' doubt but that typhus
fever was present in London and other parts of Great Britain (and also in
Ireland) prior to the extinction of plague.
Creighton records epidemics that occurred during the Civil Wars between
the Cavaliers and the Roundheads.
In 1643 both Oxfordshire and Berkshire suffered from attacks of typhus
fever the disease apparently originating at the siege of Reading, where,
on surrender, the garrison was found to be in a most deplorable condition.
The disease first attacked the troops, but soon apparently spread throughout
the countryside. An outbreak also occurred in 1644 at Tiverton, in Devon-
shire, which was occupied by both armies that year, and was apparently
infected by them.
Creighton states that fever in the London bills is a steady item from
}ear to year, seldom falling below a thousand deaths, and in the year 1741,
during a general epidemic of typhus, rising to 7,500. The fevers were a
composite group But the bulk of them perennially
appear to have been typhus fever. Where the words 4 spotted fever ’ are
given, there can be little doubt. Every year the bills have a small number
of deaths from spotted fever, and the number of them always rises in the
weekly bills in proportion to the amount of fever in general, sometimes
reaching twenty in a week, when the other fevers reach a hundred. It would
be a mistake to suppose that only the fevers called 4 spotted ’ were typhus,
the other and larger part being something else. The more reasonable sup-
position is that the name of 4 spotted ’ was given by the searchers where the


spots were especially notable. If a score or a dozen or
half-a-dozen deaths in a week are set down to spotted fever, it probably
means that a large part of the remaining one hundred or seventy or fifty were
really of the same kind, namely, typhus.”
This conclusion is justified by Creighton in the following words :—“ If
there had been any reason to suppose that the London of the Restoration or
of the time of Queen Anne or of the first Georges had enjoyed better public
health in its crowded ‘ liberties ’ and outparishes than we know it to have
done when the authentic accounts of Lettsom and other dispensary physicians
begins ” ( i.e ., about 1770) “ then one might err in assuming the perennial
existence of typhus fever, and in assigning to that cause the bulk of the
deaths under the heading of ‘ fevers ’in the parish clerk’s bills. But it was
undoubtedly worse.”
After 1666 the deaths from “ fevers ” remained stationary for several
years, when a large epidemic occurred in the country and the towns of
England in the years 1685-1686, following two years of severe droughts in
the summer months, and frosts in the winter months, causing great poverty.
Then there followed a few good years ; and, later, seven years of bad seasons,
with the result that the deaths from fevers in general, and from spotted fever
in particular, were high. These seven ill years were 1693-1699. In London
the worst year was 1694, when the “ fever ” deaths totalled 5,036. Scotland
suffered most of all during this period. Then there followed a series of good
seasons, and general prosperity, only to be followed by a drought in 1709.
An epidemic of typhus followed in the autumn of that year, and lasted into
1710.
The next great epidemic occurred in 1714, after the peace of Utrecht
had terminated the Duke of Marlborough’s campaign in France. There
was a great rise in the price of wheat (probably owing to a drought),
and consequent great increase of poverty. Then the epidemic occurred.
Following the defeat of the supporters of the Old Pretender, at Preston,
in 1715, 450 of them were imprisoned in Chester Castle, lying all huddled
together in straw. The result was that a great sickness (which appears,
from the description given, to have been typhus fever) broke out among
them, and four or five died every night during a period of several weeks’
duration.
After 1715 a great era of prosperity occurred in Great Britain. This was
largely owing to the great increase of trade with the Colonies, with the
Continent, and with India. Improved methods of farming and stock-raising
benefited the country districts, and the upper and middle classes enjoyed
great prosperity. But it did not reach the poorer classes of the towns.
Prior to this period, typhus fever had attacked even the highest classes
to a large extent. Amongst others the Queen of England was undoubtedly
affected with this disease in 1662. But from now onward it was practically
limited to the poorest classes of the population —members of the better
classes being attacked only sporadically. In this connexion it is interesting
to record the fact that the quarters occupied by the rich gradually became
detached from those occupied by the poor in the towns of Great Britain
during the first half of the eighteenth century.


The working classes continued to live in great squalor, and were still
grossly overcrowded. In the reign of William 111. a tax was levied on
windows and in 1747 was made more stringent, in that each was taxed
separately. This naturally made the poorest people look on light and air
as a luxury, with the result that the number of windows in each house was
reduced to a minimum. The Act of 1747 was not repealed till 1803, when
the old Act of William 111. was again substituted. Under these conditions
of defective hygiene a drought was all that was necessary to cause severe
epidemics throughout England, Scotland, and Ireland, by increasing the
price of food, and by adding to the general poverty. Thus, during these
years of unexampled prosperity (1715-1765), epidemics of typhus and
relapsing fever broke out in the years 1718, 1728, and 1741. But in these
epidemics only the poorest classes were affected.
During the eighteenth century typhus fever always particularly affected
the gaols and the navy, where the overcrowding was greatest, and the condi-
tmns of life the most deplorable. Epidemics of typhus fever frequently
had their origin in the District Assizes, and it was often noticed that only
those who were present in the Court were first affected The best known
instance of this was that of the Old Bailey Sessions, in April, 1750 in
London ; altogether over fifty people perished, but it was remarked that, on

not sufficient space in the wards to enable all to lie down on the floor so
that many had to sleep in hammocks. The stench was terrible' as 'the
prisoners were often compelled to “ease nature within the room” The
windows were reduced to the minimum, for the gaolers had to pay the window
extreme M ’ f °° d pr<mded for them was insufficient in the
Prisoners were often moved directly from the gaol to ships of war and
carried the contagion of typhus fever to the vessels, with the result’that
thereat , ts of Howard , the gaols were greatly improved and
thereafter typhus fever was rarely heard of in those places.

well-equipped. Consequently, although food was dear, wages were high,
and there was an era of general prosperity throughout Great Britain, with
very few cases of typhus fever.
On the Continent, on the other hand, war was being waged, with resultant
misery and famine, and during all these years epidemics of many diseases
(including typhus) were always prevalent.
When Sir John Moore’s army, in 1809, retreated from Corunna, and was
hastily placed on transports, and taken to Plymouth, in an exhausted state—
the men ill, worn out, and not properly fed—an epidemic of typhus fever
broke out amongst them, but apparently did not spread to the civil
population.
After the declaration of peace, in 1815, and the bad harvest, in 1816,
wages declined greatly, and food became much dearer, with consequent
general misery. An epidemic followed in 1817-1819. It was most severe
(as usual) in Ireland, but Great Britain also suffered very much from
typhus fever.
During the period, 1831-1842 (a time of great distress and want) typhus
again became epidemic throughout the whole of the Kingdom, but more
particularly so between 1837-1842.
In Ireland during the years 1845 and 1846 the potato crop was almost
completely lost through blight, while the state of distress was prolonged by
the potato disease in 1847 and 1848. The result was to cause a great famine
throughout Ireland. The usual outbreak of diseases followed— typhus
fever and relapsing fever being pre-eminent. The number of deaths recorded
from fever was very high. The epidemic lasted from 1846 to 1850.

The epidemic attacked England and Scotland in 1847 and 1848. With
a good season in 1848 the epidemic ended suddenly in England. But
probably the contagion mainly came from Ireland.
In 1856 there was a considerable increase of typhus fever m London
at the close of the Crimean war.
In 1862-1869 an epidemic again broke out in Great Britain and
Ireland owing to the “ cotton famine ” of the American Civil War

Since 1869 the following causes have aided in abolishing epidemics of
typhus fever : —“ First, the population is better housed ; we have got rid
of the window tax, rebuilt the houses in regular streets, opening upon wide
thoroughfares, pulled down most of the back-to-back houses, dispersed the
working population over square miles of suburbs easily accessible from the
heart of the town, by tramways and railways, perfected the sewerage and
water supply. Secondly, food has for a long time been cheap, and wages
good.”—(Creighton.)

It consequently appears, as pointed out by Creighton in the Preface to
the second volume of “ History of Epidemics in Britain,” that the “ amount
o typhus fever and relapsing fever has always been a curiously correct
index of the condition of the working classes, the unwholesomeness of
e towns, . . . . . ~ the state of the gaols and of the navy, the
seasons of dearth, the times of war prices or of depressed trade, and all the
other vicissitudes of well-beino- ”
O
Europe.
On the Continent, in Hirsch’s opinion, the history of typhus fever was
recorded scientifically, especially from an epidemiological standpoint, for
e first time at the beginning of the sixteenth century. But its history
always has been written in those dark pages of the world’s story, which
tell of the grievous visitations of mankind by war, famine, and misery of
every n . n every age as far back as the historical inquirer can follow


the disease at all, typhus is met with in association with the saddest misfor-
tunes of the populace ; and it is, therefore, a well-grounded surmise that the
numerous pestilences of war and famine in ancient times and the Middle Ages,
which are known to us, not from medical sources but mainly from the
chronicles, had included typhus fever as a prominent figure among them.”
In the sixteenth century, from the writings of the Italian physicians of the
period, Hirsch concludes that typhus fever was present over a great part of
Italy, in epidemic form, between the years 1505-1530. Shortly following
this are records of the presence of typhus fever in the form of epidemics
over almost the whole of Europe. The worst epidemics of this century have
been summarized by Hirsch in the following order : —-
In 1505-1508 there was a famine in Italy, which was accompanied by a
very severe outbreak of typhus fever. Fracastori, of Verona, a con-
temporary physician, believed this disease to have been imported at that
time from Cyprus. He stated that this disease was known for a long time
to have been endemic on that island, but was now, for the first time, noticed
in Italy.
In 1528-1530 another great epidemic of this disease occurred. This
was definitely associated both with war and famine. During the years
1540-1545 epidemics were repeated in Savoy, France, and the different
German States.
Extensive epidemics occurred in both France and Spain in the year 1557.
In the latter country the disease persisted for many years, and became known
as “ tabardillo ” and “ pintas.”
In 1566-1568 an outbreak occurred in Hungary in association with war
and famine, and this epidemic spread through Austria, Italy, Bohemia, all
the German States, and the Netherlands.
In 1572-1574 (again associated closely with total failure of the crops, and
with war) extensive epidemics occurred throughout the Netherlands, the
German States, France, and Switzerland. Again, as a direct consequence
of the failure of crops and war, the disease was excessively prevalent through-
out all Italy, Sicily, most of the German States, and Sweden (1588-1597).
During the seventeenth century typhus fever occurred in great epidemics
over the entire Continent. They were always closely associated with
famines or wars, or with both.
At the beginning of this century the disease was excessively prevalent
in Spain for several years ; but the worst outbreak recorded was that which
occurred in Germany during the “ Thirty Years’ War ” in that country,
and from there spread over practically the whole of the Continent.
It was also exceptionally prevalent in the southern provinces of France,
which formed the battlegrounds of the Civil Wars waged between the
Huguenots and the Roman Catholics during the earlier part of this century.
Between 1649-1666 large epidemics occurred in Prussia ; some of these
epidemics owed their origin to the wars waged there by King Charles Gustavus,
of Sweden. The Swedish troops, returning from Germany, introduced an
extensive outbreak in Scandinavia.
In 1666, a great famine occurred in Sicily, and was accompanied by a
severe outbreak of typhus fever.


Other extensive outbreaks recorded occurred in Germany during the period
1673-1717, while the war was being waged by Holland, England, and
several German States against King Louis XIV. of France ; in Austria-
Hungary during the wars fought there against the Turks, between 1683-1718 ;
and finally in Sweden during 1695-1697, in consequence of a severe famine.
During the eighteenth century epidemics of typhus fever seem to have
occurred practically every year in some place or other on the Continent, but
Hirsch distinguishes four periods during which the disease was excessively
prevalent.
(1) The first period was a continuance of the outbreaks already stated
as having occurred in Germany and in Austria-Hungary as a
result of wars waged in those countries. The epidemics died out
about the year 1720.
(2) During the second period (1734-1744) the disease ravaged Central
and Eastern Europe. It was first noticed amongst the Polish
troops engaged in the War of the Polish Succession. It spread
throughout Russia, Prussia, Silesia, the Central German States,
and the Netherlands. The English and French troops engaged in
these wars were also affected.
(3) The third period lasted from 1757 to 1775. It owed its origin to
the “ Seven Years’ War,” starting in 1757, between England and
France. The epidemic began in Prussia, extended all over
Germany, and then spread to France and Spain. In 1764 and
1767 extensive epidemics occurred over most of Italy, as a result
of a total failure of crops in each case.
(4) The fourth and most extensive period began in 1789 in France, during
the Revolution, and from there spread over the whole of Europe.
The disease persisted in epidemic form throughout the duration
of the Napoleonic Wars, and did not begin to subside until the
conclusion of peace, in 1815, after the battle of Waterloo.
In Hirsch’s opinion this was the severest epidemic of typhus fever ever
recorded on the Continent. The disease was always most severe in those
places where the various battles and sieges occurred. But it spread to many
places far removed from the sites of war. There can be no doubt that the
general poverty and distress—the results of the war —aided greatly in the
spread of the disease to these localities.
The Nineteenth Century. —After the severe epidemic of 1789-1815 over
the whole of Europe had come to an end, no general epidemic occurred till
the years 1846-1847. This was a period of great misery and poverty, and
typhus fever became very widespread again over the entire Continent.
Since 1847 many severe epidemics of typhus fever have been recorded,,
but they all have been circumscribed. Most appear to have started in
certain well-defined endemic areas. (See p. 19.)
In Russia a very severe outbreak occurred in the Crimea amongst the
troops of the nations fighting there during the war of 1854-1856. The
epidemic spread throughout most of Southern Russia.


In 1874-1876 the whole of this Empire (including Siberia) was ravaged by
a severe epidemic of this disease. The Russian troops engaged in the war of
1877-1878 against Turkey suffered severely from this disease.
In Germany an extensive -epidemic occurred in Silesia in 1855-1856,
following closely on a severe famine. Between 1855-1856 there were a
series of sharp, circumscribed epidemics in different parts of Germany.
Another severe epidemic occurred throughout the whole of East Prussia
between 1867-1869. The inhabitants were living in a state of great misery
following an extensive famine and the Austro-Prussian War of 1866.
Severe epidemics (limited to the poorest classes of the population) occurred
in different parts of Prussia in the years 1873, 1878, and 1879. Berlin was
especially severely affected on those occasions. In 1876 an epidemic
occurred in Silesia. Several severe outbreaks occurred in various
districts of Prussia during the “ eighties.”
The statistics of Austria-Hungary are very uncertain, but it is clear that
epidemics were constantly occurring in all parts of the Empire as late as
1880. Since that date they appear to have attacked chiefly Galicia and
Hungary. There occurred 121 deaths from typhus fever in Budapest in the
year 1899.
In Italy, between the years 1816-1873, no fewer than 51 epidemics are
known to have occurred.
In France since 1846 only four epidemics are known to have occurred.
The first broke out in Marseilles and the southern provinces in 1856, on the
return of the French troops from the Crimea. The second occurred in the
Department of Morbihan during the years 1869-1871. It owed its origin to
an endemic focus in Brittany. The third outbreak occurred amongst the
population of Metz during its siege by the German troops. In 1891 some
80 cases were reported in Tudy, an island off Cape Finisterre (Brittany),
whilst in 1892-1893 an outbreak, starting in the Departments of Finisterre
and Morbihan, spread through Northern France. In 1893, Proust recorded
the presence of 684 cases in fifteen towns, of which Paris gave a total of
156 and Amiens one of 150.
No large epidemics have been recorded in Switzerland, Denmark, or
Norway since 1846.
In Belgium, Holland, Sweden and Iceland, the last recorded outbreaks
appear to have occurred during the “ sixties.
The statistics from the Balkan Peninsula are of so unsatisfactory a nature
as to make it uncertain how many epidemics occurred there during the
nineteenth century. It is certain that many outbreaks did eventuate there
during this period.
Asia and Africa.
The history of typhus fever on both Continents appears to be most
incomplete, for the first epidemics recorded by Hirsch are those that occurred
in Persia in 1857 and in Cairo in 1836 respectively. There seems to be little
doubt, however, that the greater portion of subtropical Asia and the whole
of the Mediterranean littoral of Africa have been attacked by many epidemics
of this disease in the past.


Australia.
Hirsch states that on several occasions prior to 1866 typhus fever has
been introduced into Tasmania by persons landing there from vessels ; but
that the precautionary measures adopted have always prevented the disease
from spreading over the island.
Cases have occurred on vessels (especially on immigrant vessels) arriving
in Australia, but no outbreak has ensued on the mainland.
America.
In Canada and the United States typhus fever appears to have been
unknown, or at any rate very rare, prior to 1820.
Since that date it has been introduced on numerous occasions, chiefly by
immigrants from Ireland and Southern Europe.
Between the years 1820-1870 several outbreaks have occurred in various
cities on the Eastern coast. But the virulent form of the disease was always
quickly stamped out, and so apparently never obtained a footing.
But recently it has been shown that a disease known as Brill’s Disease,
which is fairly common in most of the large cities of the Atlantic portion of
the United States, is in reality an extremely mild form of typhus fever.
There does not appear to be any record of the time when this disease was
introduced into the United States.
In Mexico the first recorded epidemic was in the year 1570, when Fran-
cesco Bravo reported a very serious outbreak of the disease “ tabardete,”
the name then current in Spain for typhus fever.
Many subsequent epidemics have been recorded amongst the inhabitants
of the highlands. Notable outbreaks occurred in the years 1576, 1736, 1762,
and 1813, and many have arisen since.
This disease in Mexico is now known as “ tabardillo.”
In Peru severe epidemics of this disease are reported to have occurred
amongst the inhabitants of the country soon after the conquest by the
Spaniards.
Hirsch assumes that, both in Mexico and Peru, typhus fever was
introduced by the Spaniards ; but it appears to be possible that it was present
in both countries before their arrival. The general poverty and misery of
the inhabitants and of the Spanish troops during the wars would then aid
in the dissemination of the virus of the disease, and so facilitate the occur-
rence of extensive epidemics.
In later times epidemics have occurred in the various republics of South
America, mostly during revolutions and wars.
In the West Indies a few cases appear to have been imported by vessels
from Europe during the first half of the nineteenth century ; but in no case
has an extensive outbreak resulted.

II. PRESENT DISTRIBUTION OF TYPHUS FEVER.
Castellani and Chalmers state that “ typhus fever is essentially a disease
of temperate and cold climates.” In tropical regions it only occurs in places
situated at high altitudes where the temperature after sunset is low, as, for
example, in Mexico ; or else in places where there is a cool season. In these
latter the immediate disappearance of this disease on the onset of the warm
season is most pronounced (1).
I. Africa.
It appears to be endemic along the whole of the Mediterranean littoral-
cases occurring in Morocco, Algeria, Tunis, Tripoli, and Egypt. It is also
endemic in Nubia (1).
In these places epidemics occur periodically. E. J. Maxwell was present
in the City of Tripoli during the conquest of the country by the Italians, and
records an epidemic in the city at the time, which also infected the Italian
troops (2).
In Tunis an epidemic broke out in 1909. In the City of Tunis there were
836 cases, with 272 deaths ; in the remainder of the country there were some
4,000 cases. From 1909 onwards Nicolle has pursued a vigorous anti-louse
campaign in the city, with the result that in 1914 only three cases occurred
—two imported from Morocco, and one from Algeria (30).
In Algeria outbreaks are constantly occurring. For instance, in the old
town of Algiers there were reported 384 cases, with 76 deaths, in 1909 ; and
363 cases, with 90 deaths, in 1910. In the province of Algiers between
March and May (inclusive) 220 cases were notified in 1914 (30).

The disease is unknown in tropical Africa (1).
11. Asia.
It occurs periodically as epidemics in Asia Minor and Syria. G. H-
Corbett records a recent severe epidemic that occurred in Palestine in the
years 1913 and 1914, and which later spread to Asia Minor (3).
Since the outbreak of the present war several epidemics of typhus fever
have occurred in Asia Minor. In the winter of 1914-1915 a severe outbreak
occurred in Armenia, following the massacres of the Armenians by the Turks,




and the commencement of hostilities on the Caucasus between the Russians
and Turks. Between October, 1914, and May, 1915, it is estimated that 6,000
persons perished from this disease at Trebizond (32). At the beginning of
1915 Bruce Low states that, according to a Greek paper, 1,000 deaths a day
occurred at Erzerum from typhus and small-pox. The disease was also
present at Constantinople and throughout Syria (30).
During the winter of 1915-1916 a recrudescence of the disease occurred in
Syria. At Aleppo 200 deaths daily were stated to occur during November,
1915 (33), and 1,000 cases, with 150 deaths, were estimated to have occurred
amongst the Turkish troops at Damascus during February, 1916 (34).
It is endemic in Persia, Beloochistan, probably in Afghanistan, and in
the ** hill districts ” of India.
It is also found in Indo-China and in Japan, and is endemic in
Northern China, where it becomes epidemic every spring (1).
A severe outbreak of typhus fever occurred during the months of March
and April in the year 1914 at Tokio. During this period there were 1,750
cases, of which 12 per cent, proved fatal (4). By the end of September,
1914, the total number of cases reached 4,119. The disease had then
been brought well under control. The mortality for the whole period was
not stated (5). Previous to the epidemic the following figures were issued by
the Japanese Bureau of Hygiene :

These figures refer to the whole of Japan.
The disease is also present in Formosa (30).
Castellani and Chalmers emphasize the fact that the only cases occurring
in Ceylon have been found in vessels from other ports (1).
The United States health reports for 1915 record the presence of a few
cases of typhus fever in Java—notably in Batavia and its environs (6).
This appears to have been an unusual outbreak, as Batavia is in a tropical
-zone, with no cool season.


In October, 1914, typhus fever of the mild variety, “ Brill’s Disease,”
was stated to be present in the Philippine Islands, in endemic form.
Twenty-three cases were reported (7).
III. America.
It is very prevalent in Mexico, but Anderson and Goldberger have shown
that it is only present in places having an altitude of over 6,000 feet, where,
of course, the nights are always cool (8). Ricketts and Wilder have stated
that cases of this disease (or “ tabardillo,” as it is called there) occur most
frequently in the early spring (9).
As an illustration of its prevalence in this country, it may be noted that
official records show that in November and December, 1915, in Mexico City
the number of cases recorded were 3,241 and 2,199 respectively ; and the
deaths 305 and 400 respectively (10).
The disease is common in Peru and Northern Chili, but is generally absent
in the West Indies, the Guianas, Colombia, and Venezuela. It is rare in
Central America and Brazil —presumably the cases occur in these places only
at great heights (1).
The disease at one time was considered absent in the United States,
except for cases imported by immigrant vessels from the south of Europe.
An example of this type was furnished between November, 1913, and April,
1914, when no fewer than nineteen immigrant vessels (mainly from Southern
Europe) were quarantined on arrival at ports on the Atlantic coast of the
United States (11). But N. E. Brill, in three papers, published in 1898, 1910,
and 1911 respectively, described an “ acute infectious disease of unknown
origin, ” which came to be known as “ Brill’s Disease.” He recorded 255
cases occurring at the Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, between the years
1896 to 1910 (inclusive), of which 34 occurred during the year 1910. It is a
very mild disease, only one case of this series proving fatal (12), (13). Since
then it has been found to be fairly prevalent in other large cities in the
United States of America. R. Lee has concluded that in the Massachusetts
General Hospital there occurs one case of “ Brill’s Disease ” to every 47 of
typhoid fever during the ten years, 1902-1912. This is the probable ratio
in most of the large cities of the Eastern States of the United States of
America (14). But Anderson and Goldberger, by their inoculation and
immunity tests on monkeys (to be referred to later), showed conclusively
that this disease and typhus fever are identical (15). The mildness of the
disease is probably influenced by the hygienic conditions prevailing in the
United States of America.
It is obvious, then, that “ Brill’s Disease,” or mild typhus fever, is fairly
common in the larger cities of the United States.
IV. Australasia.
The disease is unknown in Australia, in New Zealand, and in the islands
of the Pacific (1).


V. Europe.
As has been seen, typhus fever used to be exceedingly prevalent both
in Great Britain and Ireland, especially in the latter country. A few
scattered cases still occur, as the deaths recorded in the Registrar-General’s
returns show: —

The last deaths from typhus fever in London occurred in the year 1903.
In 1912 an epidemic occurred in Glasgow, amongst some aliens, in one of
the most densely-populated parts of the city (16). This outbreak, it is
interesting to note, was considered by Dr. Chalmers, Medical Officer of
Health for the city, to have been associated with the sale of second-hand
clothes (17).
Up to the end of 1915, during the present European War, there had not
been recorded any increase in the number of cases in Great Britain. In
England twelve cases, with two deaths, were notified, of which eleven
occurred in Liverpool. In Scotland thirteen cases were reported—six
from Dundee (including one fatal case) and seven from Glasgow (35).
In Ireland an outbreak occurred in the City of Londonderry. Every
person affected (with the sole exception of the district nurse, who pre-
sumably attended the sufferers) had been present at a “ wake ” held on
the 19th December, 1914, where apparently they were all infected (18).
In 1915 sixteen cases were reported in Dublin (with one death), and
one case in Cork (35).
So far, then, Great Britain and Ireland have not suffered from any increase
of typhus fever as a result of the war ; indeed, these figures (obtained from
the United States Public Health Reports) indicate that there has been a very
decided diminution in the number of deaths resulting from this disease. It
is probable, however, that the number so recorded is not complete.
On the Continent typhus fever has well-marked endemic centres through-
out the Russian Empire (notably in Poland and in the Baltic provinces),
in Galicia, and in the Balkan Peninsula.


In France 209 deaths from typhus fever were recorded between
1903-1912 (inclusive) :

The following figures show the prevalence of the disease in the Russian
Empire (European and Asiatic), but it is essential to remember its enormous
population. In 1911 it amounted to 167,520,069 persons, of whom, roughly,
134,000,000 were in Europe, and more than 33,000,000 in Asia.

These figures have been compiled by Bruce Low from various sources (30).
A few sporadic cases are occasionally recorded as occurring in Scandinavia,
Denmark, Holland, and Belgium (30), (31).
A sharp outbreak occurred at Madrid, in Spain, in March, 1913, some
hundred cases being reported. The first case occurred in a night-shelter for
the poor of the city. No connexion with the outbreak in the Balkans in
the same year is noted (20).
At the conclusion of the second Balkan War, early in 1913, an outbreak
of this disease occurred among some Turkish prisoners of war in Serbia, which
spread to the Serbian population, an epidemic following throughout the
country; and cases developed in the adjoining Balkan States. The number
of cases reported in Serbia, as shown by the United States Public Health
for that year, amounted to 445. The mortality of this epidemic was low—
-2-3 per cent, amongst the Serbians, and 8-10 per cent, amongst the Turkish
prisoners of war (21).
Several vessels from the Balkan States had cases of typhus fever on
board on arriving at Trieste, in Austria, where a few cases occurred in the
June of that year (22).
The fact that the whole of the Mediterranean littoral of Europe was badly
infected at that time with typhus fever is shown by the large number of
immigrant vessels from these parts being quarantined on arrival at the
United States, America, during the winter and early spring of 1913-14, on
account of typhus fever. This has been already referred to.


On the outbreak of the present war, the fighting on the Eastern front took
place in Galicia, Poland, and the Balkan States—all well-known endemic
foci of typhus fever. In addition, there had been the epidemic in Serbia, in
1913, already mentioned. Consequently, it was not very surprising that
typhus fever should again become prevalent. Two great epidemics
occurred—one in Serbia, and the other in the German and Austrian Con-
centration Camps.
The Serbian outbreak occurred early in 1915, during the winter months.
It is difficult to estimate the total number of cases that occurred. The
epidemic was of an intensely virulent type, and it is believed that during its
height the number of deaths that occurred daily numbered 500 (6).
B. W. Caldwell, the Hospital Administrator to the American Red Cross
Sanitary Commission to Serbia, states that, conservatively, one person in
every five throughout the country was attacked—the total population of
Serbia being 2,500,000. Certainly 135,000 persons died from typhus fever.
The mortality ranged from 19 to 65 per cent, in the different hospitals.
He points out how circumstances favoured the epidemic. Belgrade, the
capital, which has a normal population of 100,000, had no more than 30,000
persons living in it at the time ; the remainder of the population having
emigrated to the south of Serbia, which, consequently, was grossly over-
crowded. In addition, there were 70,000 Austrian captives, who were
exhausted and infested with lice, scattered throughout the country towns
and villages. The Serbians were living in deplorable conditions, and were
mostly infested with lice. The mortality was exceedingly heavy amongst
the medical men and nurses attending the cases; out of 340 Serbian
doctors, 160 perished (23).
The Wounded Allies’ Relief Hospital reached Nish, the temporary capital
of Serbia, in March, and the disease was got under control. “On sth April
there were 8,198 cases in hospital; on 18th April, only 948.” (24). On
26th July the United States Minister at Bucharest visited 75 per cent, of
the Serbian hospitals, and found the disease entirely checked. But the
physicians in attendance at the hospitals considered it might re-appear
later on (25).
Caldwell believed a few sporadic cases were occurring in the northern
districts at about that time. He considered that the outbreak owed its
origin to occasional cases persisting since the previous epidemic (23).
The second great outbreak, in 1915, occurred early in the year in the
German and Austrian Concentration Camps. It was officially announced to
be present in ten of these camps by the United States Ambassador at
Berlin (26).
Two medical men —Major P. C. T. Davy and Captain A. J. Brown, of the
R.A.M.C., captured by the Germans—were sent on 11th February to the
prison camp at Gardelegen. The total number of prisoners there was between
11,000 and 12,000 ; of these 230 were English, 800-1,000 Belgian, and the
remainder Russian and French troops, but chiefly French.
Soon after their arrival typhus fever broke out, and in all 2,000 captives
were attacked. They considered the disease mild in type, but the death
rate was 15 per cent, of those attacked.


They state that in other camps the disease was far more malignant
notably at Cassel and Wittenberg—where the death rate was far higher (27).
Similar outbreaks have occurred in the Austrian Concentration Camps.
Lindner states that in one camp of 9,000 Russian prisoners of war, 300 cases
occurred in one week alone (28). Skutetsky also records an outbreak amongst
Russian prisoners in Austria (29).
It appears to be impossible to ascertain at present either the number of
cases of the disease or of the deaths that occurred in the prison camps of
Germany and Austria during 1915.
Typhus fever, therefore, has been (and undoubtedly still is) far more
prevalent than it has been for many years past.

III. EPIDEMIOLOGY.
Typhus fever has many synonyms, the best known of which are famine,
gaol, camp, siege, war, ship, and Irish fevers.
It occurs amongst people who, either from ignorance or inability, neglect
the ordinary decent methods of living. The continual wearing of the same
clothing (especially if no change is made at night), the want of personal
cleanliness, the want of sufficient self-ablution, and gross overcrowding, are
the main factors in the spread of this disease.
Typhus fever used to be excessively prevalent both in Great Britain and
Ireland ; but very few cases have occurred in recent years. This improve-
ment is the result of the better conditions prevailing in both countries in the
housing of the working classes.
The disease in the British Isles was always one that affected the poorer
classes ; if some member of the better class contracted the disease it never
spread amongst the members of his family. This was not due to natural
immunity, for it has been shown that the relative mortality to the disease
has always been higher amongst that section of the community than amongst
the poorer classes (1).
Famine, by increasing the poverty of the whole population, naturally aids
in the spread of typhus fever.
An excellent illustration of the relation of typhus fever to overcrowding,
and the inability of the people affected to keep themselves decently clean, is
afforded by the report of Davy and Brown of the epidemic of this disease
that broke out amongst the captives of war in the German Prison Camp at
Gardelegen, in the beginning of 1915.
Each person in this camp had only about 20 cubic feet of air space in the
barracks. The hospital had 200 beds, although the utmost number of patients
that should have been accommodated was 90, so that the whole camp was
grossly overcrowded. There was no possibility of the captives changing
their clothes. One bath-house, containing 24 showers, was provided for the
12,000 odd captives, so that the men had to wait from one to three months
to get a bath. Further, hardly any soap was provided. The buildings
were not properly ventilated, and the disposal of sewage was most in-
adequate. Every captive is stated to have been swarming with lice.
No precaution was adopted by the Germans to keep the disease from
spreading (2).
Davy and Brown also note that those people who were in the most
direct contact with the patients were most liable to be attacked by the
disease, and also that the mortality was considerably higher amongst them
than amongst the general prison population. Thus, of ten French abbes,
who volunteered to act as nursing orderlies, eight contracted the disease, and
five died.
There were sixteen medical men at the camp; twelve of these became
infected, and two died. Of 22 British nursing orderlies, twenty were attacked
by the disease, and two died. The figures for the nursing orderlies amongst
the Russian and French troops were very similar (2).
Typhus fever has always been noticed to appear amongst troops at war.
It has already been noticed to have occurred in the present war, in the Balkan


War, and the Italian campaign in Tripoli. It is also believed to have occurred
amongst the Japanese troops in their fight against the Russians in Man-
churia (3).
It has also been the experience of troops at war that they cannot keep
themselves free from lice, owing to want of sufficient bathing facilities, the
necessity of wearing the same clothes for long periods, and overcrowding
in camps. This was even the case in the South African War of
1899-1901, where the fighting took place to a large extent in the open
veldt (4).
These factors all tend to show that infection does not ordinarily take
place by droplet infection, or by infection by fomites.
Nicolle, in 1908, was the first to demonstrate that the infective virus of
typhus was present in the blood of the patient. First of all he injected the
blood of a patient suffering from this disease into a chimpanzee, which, after
a few days, became ill, with a temperature which persisted for several days.
He then injected the blood of this chimpanzee to a Macacus sinicus monkey,
which reacted similarly. Body lice were allowed to bite the Macacus monkey
while its temperature was elevated, and then to bite a healthy monkey, which,
after a few days, contracted the disease. He thus demonstrated the fact that
body lice are capable of transmitting typhus fever (4a), (5).
Anderson and Goldberger, in 1909-1910, working at Mexico City, were
able to infect Macacus monkeys directly by injection with the defibrinated
( blood of patients suffering from “ tabardillo,” or the typhus fever of Mexico
—the injection being made either intravenously or intraperitoneally, or by
both methods. After an incubation period of five to eleven days the monkeys
became ill, with a raised temperature, which persisted for some five to twelve
days. The fever usually ended by crisis, or else by rapid lysis. The animals
appeared ill, and had a marked thirst, ruffled hair, and poor appetite, but
had no discernible eruption. An animal which recovered was found to be
immune to other injections of defibrinated blood from patients suffering
from “ tabardillo.”
They also found that the defibrinated blood of a monkey suffering from
typhus fever can, by injection, be made to infect another Macacus monkey.
Further, they were able to infect a monkey by allowing lice (which had
fed on the blood of patients suffering from tabardillo) to bite the monkey
repeatedly (5), (6), (7).
Similar results were obtained by Ricketts and Wilder, who also experi-
mented with the blood of patients suffering from tabardillo. They found
that monkeys could be infected both by direct injections of the patient’s
blood, and by the bites of infected body lice (8), (9). They succeeded in
infecting a monkey by rubbing the abdominal contents of body lice (which
had been allowed to feed on an infected monkey) into scarifications made in
the skin of the animal. The lice had last been fed on the infected monkey
three days previously (9).
Anderson and Goldberger then proceeded with experiments from the
blood of patients at Mount Sinai Hospital, New York City, suffering from
“ Brill’s Disease.”


Brill has described the disease as follows :—“ An acute infectious disease
of unknown origin and unknown pathology, characterized by a short incuba-
tion period (four to five days), a period of continuous fever, accompanied by
intense headache, apathy, and prostration, a profuse and extensive erythe-
matous maculo-papular eruption, all of about two weeks’ duration, whereupon
the fever abruptly ceases, either by crisis in a few hours, or by rapid lysis in
a few days, when all symptoms disappear.” Anderson and Goldberger
succeeded in infecting Macacus monkeys with this disease, which ran a
very similar course to those infected with tabardillo.
Further, they found that monkeys that had recovered from an infection
with “ Brill’s Disease ” were immune to an infection with virulent blood
from Mexican typhus fever, and vice versa. Hence, they considered it
proved that Mexican typhus and “ Brill’s Disease ” are identical; and, as
they believed “ Brill’s Disease ” to be derived from the typhus fever of
Europe, they concluded that typhus fever and Mexican tabardillo are
identical (10).
Anderson and Goldberger have shown that a large proportion of monkeys
possess a natural transient immunity to typhus ; for, though immune once,
they often develop the disease on a later inoculation of infected blood. About
3 per cent, appear to be entirely naturally immune. This may explain
Nicolle’s failure to originally infect monkeys from human infective blood.
He succeeded later in doing so. Anderson and Goldberger conclude that,
in order to prove a given case is typhus fever by inoculating a monkey,
not only must a typical reaction follow, but that this monkey, on recovery,
must be immune to subsequent inoculations of virulent typhus blood (11).
Two monkeys experimented on by Bicketts and Wilder died in the course
of the illness following inoculation. The post-mortem findings were very
similar to those found in human beings dying of typhus fever, viz., cerebral
congestion and oedema, congestion of abdominal viscera, slight to moderate
enlargement of the spleen, doubtful enlargement of lymphatic glands, and
total absence of any localized inflammation (8).
In monkeys the disease does not appear to be severe, as these are the only
fatal cases recorded.
It has thus been conclusively proved that the virus of the disease resides
in the blood of the infected person during the febrile period, and that monkeys
can be experimentally infected with typhus fever by the bites of body lice
which have been allowed to feed on the blood of infected men or monkeys.
Epidemics of this disease always attack people living in deplorable
hygienic surroundings—the chief of which are the want of sufficient personal
ablution, the constant wearing of the same clothing, and gross overcrowding.
These are the very factors that favour the presence and rapid spread of body
lice.
Consequently, the body-louse (Pediculus vestimenti) may be regarded as
the chief (if not the sole) agent of transmission of typhus fever.
In Mexico, Anderson and Goldberger noted that the disease was limited
to altitudes of over 6,000 feet, and that body-lice only occurred in places
situated above this height.
They also observed that the head-louse (Pediculus capitis) was very
prevalent in the lowlands of Mexico.


They reported that on one occasion they were successful in producing .
fever in a monkey by allowing P. capitis (previously fed on infected typhus
blood) to feed repeatedly on this animal. It subsequently proved to be
immune to injections of infected typhus blood (12).
This experiment may indicate that P. capitis may carry the infection at
times ; but the available evidence does not suggest that Pediculus capitis
plays any very important role in the spread of typhus fever.
Head-lice are very prevalent in the lower classes in all tropical districts.
The only recorded outbreak in such a district (with no cool season, and at
sea-level) is the one already referred to in Batavia and its environs, where
some 60 odd cases of this disease appear to have occurred (13). It is to be
hoped that this outbreak will be thoroughly investigated.
Kreibich has stated that Pediculus pubis may also act as a carrier of
typhus fever, as, in one case, the disease was apparently transmitted by
this insect (14).
Anderson and Goldberger consider the bed-bug not to be a carrier of the
disease ; as, in that case, typhus fever would resemble yellow fever, as a
“ house disease ” ; for the bed-bug notoriously lives in the house, and not
on the clothes of human beings. Further, it is found at times in the houses
of the wealthier classes (5).
Experiments carried out by Anderson and Goldberger, in order to try to
infect monkeys by the bites of these insects, have failed (11).
Anderson and Goldberger consider the flea to be too übiquitous to act as
a carrier of this disease, for they state it may be found in all the classes of
the community (5). Ricketts and Wilder also adhere to the same opinion ;
they further state that in Mexico tabardillo is most prevalent in the spring,
and the flea is most common in the summer (8).
In this connexion it is interesting to note that Davy and Brown state
that, whilst the concentration camp in Germany, in which they were interned,
was swarming with body-lice, they never noticed a flea or bed-bug throughout
the whole epidemic (2).
Another question that has been discussed is how long the blood of a
victim of typhus fever remains infectious, and, consequently, how long it
may infect body-lice.
Nicolle considered the blood was infectious for three days before the onset
of fever, and remained infectious from 32 to 48 hours after the return of the
temperature to normal. Anderson and Goldberoer’s experiments did not
support this view ; but they concluded the blood might still be infectious
from 24 to 32 hours after the return of the temperature to normal (15).
On the other hand, Davy and Brown state that patients in the concen-
tration camp in Gardelegen apparently remained infectious until three weeks
after defervescence. All lice on these patients were killed, and yet they
infected other prisoners of war on their return to the general barracks, pre-
sumably through the medium of freshly-infected lice. They state, however,
that they could not be definitely certain that all the original lice had been
killed before the patients' return to the general camp, owing to lack of proper


facilities for killing lice, so that possibly the infection came through the
medium of some original lice not killed. Patients returning a month after
defervescence did not infect fresh cases (2).
In view of the extremely rapid spread of typhus fever in grossly over-
crowded buildings it is possible that droplet infection may be occasionally a
mode of the spread of this disease.
It is of interest to note that Ricketts proved conclusively that Rocky
Mountain fever was totally distinct from typhus fever. It presents a
different clinical course to the latter disease when injected into certain animals,
notably guinea-pigs and monkeys. Later, Anderson and Goldberger showed
that an attack of typhus fever gave no immunity to monkeys as regards
Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and vice versa (11).

IV. CAUSATIVE VIRUS OF THE DISEASE.
Nicolle, Ricketts and Wilder, and Anderson and Goldberger all failed to
obtain any growth by inoculating ordinary culture media with infected
blood.
Anderson and Goldberger and Ricketts and Wilder found that the virus
could not pass through the pores of a Berkefeld filter (1), (2).
The nature of the virus has been much discussed. Some investigators
have believed it to be a protozoon, and others to be of a bacterial nature, but
the recent work of Plotz, if corroborated, would seem to have finally decided
the question.
Plotz first of all isolated an anaerobic micro-organism from the
blood of eleven out of twelve cases suffering from Brill’s disease. In the
negative case the blood was taken from the patient after the crisis had
passed.
Injections into the peritoneal cavity of guinea-pigs of a pure culture of
this micro-organism produced a rise of temperature in the animals in from
24 to 48 hours. The temperature remained high for the next four or five
days, and then abruptly fell. Serum taken from convalescent typhus
patients was bactericidal to the organism, while normal serum was found
to have no effect (3).
A later paper has been published in July, 1915, in the Journal of Infectious
Diseases , Chicago. “In the experiments cited it has been shown that a
bacillus, identical with that recovered from patients with typhus, was isolated
by the authors from the blood of animals in which the disease had been repro-
duced by inoculation of typhus blood. In such animals the frequency of the
bacilli in the blood was directly proportionate to the severity of the illness.
In individual animals it was greatest at the height of the disease. It was
also noted that, with the bacilli isolated from epidemic cases of typhus, it is
possible to reproduce the disease in animals. And, furthermore, at the
height of the disease in such animals, the identical organism can be recovered
from the circulating blood. Finally, it was found that typhus blood is only
infective if it contains a sufficient number of these bacilli. From these
observations, and the results of the bacteriologic and serologic studies, the
authors believe themselves justified in concluding that this bacterium is the
causative agent in typhus exanthematicus.
“ The organism is a small, pleomorphic, obligatory anaerobic Gram positive
bacillus, not motile, not encapsulated, and not acid-fast. Its length varies
from o*9 to 1 *93 microns, its breadth being from one-fifth to three-fifths of
its length. Most of the organisms are straight, occasional ones are slightly
curved. Coccoid forms also occur. The ends are rounded or slightly pointed.
In smears from solid media the organisms lie end to end, side by side, or at
angles to one another, there being no definite arrangement. Degeneration
and involution forms appear early, so that after repeated transplants the
organism may assume a different morphologic appearance from the bacilli
in the original culture. The organism produces no spores. Polar bodies
are occasionally demonstrable with the pyoktanin, acetic acid, and Bismarck
brown stain. When present they usually appear at one end of the bacillus,
but may appear at both ends. The organism grows much better in solid


than in fluid mediums ; in solid mediums it requires carbohydrate and serum ;
the optimal medium in the studies thus far made is 2 per cent, glucose serum
agar. For keeping the organism alive, however, 0-5 per cent, glucose serum
agar was used, as the larger glucose content was presumed to decrease virulence
to a greater extent.” (4).
Plotz and Baehr performed a series of inoculations, with the object of
immunization against typhus fever in Serbia, Bulgaria, and Yolhynia
(Russia) during the winter and spring of 1915-1916, working under the
auspices of the American Red Cross. The disease was prevalent in all three
countries during this period (December—May), though no official figures were
available. Some 3,000 cases of typhus fever were treated in the Bulgarian
military hospitals in Serbia and Bulgaria during this period. The vaccine
employed by Plotz and Baehr for prophylactic immunization consisted of a
suspension of fifteen strains of the bacillus (that they believe to be the cause
of the disease) “ in physiologic sodium chloride solution which had been
subjected to a temperature of from 58° to 60° C. for from half-an-hour to one
hour. After being tested aerobically and anaerobically as to its sterility,
the vaccine was then diluted so that each cubic centimetre contained about
two billion bacteria, and 0 ’5 per cent, phenol (carbolic acid) or tricresol added.
Three injections, consisting of o*s, 1, and 1 cc. respectively, were given in
five-or six-day intervals.” Altogether 5,251 men in Bulgaria and Serbia,
and 3,169 men in Yolhynia were vaccinated by this method by Plotz and
Baehr, and by army physicians working under their directions. The men
selected for this prophylactic treatment were those most exposed to the risk
of infection. “ The vaccine was, therefore, administered to the orderlies and
members of the hospital staffs who came in contact with the patients, on or
before admission to the hospital, when they were still infested with lice, and
also to the men whose duty was to remove the clothing, and bathe and shave
the patients on admission, or who were concerned in the sanitation of villages
or towns in which typhus fever was epidemic. In addition, many entire
hospital units were vaccinated, and, in a few instances, small military groups
in which typhus fever had broken out, and was in danger of spreading.”
The result was considered favorable, as out of 8,420 persons vaccinated, only
six developed the disease (9).
Topley, working in Serbia during the epidemic of typhus fever that
occurred in that country in the early part of 1915 was successful in obtaining
a diplococcus from the blood of patients suffering from the disease. He was
able to grow it successfully in broth, or in ascitic fluid broth, or on blood agar.
It was readily sub cultivated. It is an aerobe, but can also grow anaerobi-
cally. It is Gram positive, usually occurring as a diplococcus, but may
occur in clumps or small chains. Its most striking characteristic is its
pleomorphism; on subculture the bacteria become smaller, coccoid and
bacillary forms occur, and, finally, it consists of a Gram positive mass,
without any distinct appearance. But, even then, the Gram positive
diplococci do not completely disappear.
Topley then proceeds to review the past literature on the subject. Pre-
jetchensky, during an epidemic in Moscow, in 1910, obtained short
bacilli with polar staining, showing involution forms on subculture. On
subculture on agar the growth consisted of diplococci.


In an epidemic at Tsingtau Fiierth isolated a similar organism in sixteen
cases out of 52. It showed involution forms ; was at first Gram positive,
and later Gram negative. Later, the organisms degenerated into a granular
mass.
Muller, in 1913, isolated a similar pleomorphic organism from the blood of
five cases out of thirteen. It had also a tendency to develop into degenerative
forms. At first the micro-organism was Gram positive, and later Gram
negative (5).
Hort and Ingram, in Belfast, obtained very similar pleomorphic organisms
from the blood of patients suffering from typhus in the year 1914 (6).
These different authors have thus isolated organisms very similar to that
obtained by Topley from the blood of patients suffering from typhus fever
in Serbia.
Topley states he is now endeavouring to ascertain whether his organism
represents a different phase in the life history of the organism discovered
by Plotz. He admits, however, that for this to be possible the organism
would have to possess an extraordinary degree of pleomorphism (5).
Sergent, Foley, and Vialette have found cocco-bacillary forms in the
organs of lice fed on persons infested with lice, and not in the organs of lice
fed on the bodies of normal persons, or of persons affected with relapsing
fever. These micro-organisms are more numerous in the fluid contents of
the gut than in the organs of the lice (7).
Penfold is of opinion that the balance of evidence is in favour of the
causative virus of the disease being a coccus. He refers to the work of Wilson,
in Belfast, who found diplococci in the blood of fifteen out of 33 patients.
These cocci at times showed some slight degree of variation, but were often
identical. Similar results have been obtained by other observers.
Penfold, in 1914, investigated four cases in Belfast. At the times
the specimens were collected two cases were convalescent, one was passing
through the crisis, and one was acutely ill, but had not yet reached
the crisis. He gives the following summary of his investigations:—
“ (1) The same coccus was found in the blood and urine of two patients
suffering from typhus, and also in the urine of a convalescent
of nine days’ standing.”
“ (2) European typhus blood causes the same types of fever reaction in
monkeys as American and North African typhus.”
“ (3) The coccus above mentioned has been isolated from the blood of
infected monkeys.
“ (4) Fever has been produced after a six days’ incubation by the
inoculation of a pure culture of the above coccus into two
monkeys.
“ (5) The above coccus is fairly closely related to cocci described by
other authors, as far as the published data admit of a com-
parison.”
The best medium for the growth of this coccus obtained from infected
blood or urine was found to be human blood agar. If human blood peptone
agar was used, the colonies had a green halo around them. Sub-cultures
of the organism were made on ordinary agar and on serum agar (when the


growth was denser). The organism was essentially a tetrad, was Gram
positive, did not liquify gelatine at room temperatures, and was not affected
by long exposures to a temperature of 2° C. The five strains all gave similar
fermentative actions on 21 different carbo-hydrate media (8).
Penfold points out several contradictory statements contained in Plotz’s
two papers that appear to discount his claim to have isolated the specific
micro-organism of typhus fever—
(l) In his preliminary communication 4t he stated his organism occurred
in the blood of eleven out of eleven cases of typhus examined ;
six of these cases being epidemic typhus, and five being endemic
cases—the so-called Brill’s disease. In the second paper (1915)
he says that in a total of 34 cases of Brill’s disease examined
in the febrile stage, he has obtained his organism in eighteen
cases. If from this series we deduct the five cases of the first
series, we find he had thirteen successful blood cultures in
29 cases : that is, his first series showed 100 per cent, successes,
and his second, 45 per cent, approximately.
(2) In his first paper, the organism was alleged to be anaerobic on
isolation, and to become aerobic on cultivation; in his second
paper this is denied.
(3) Plotz, in his first paper, described bactericidal substances in the
blood of typhus patients, whilst in his second paper it is stated
that bacteriolysins and bacteriocidins could not be demon-
strated in immune typhus sera.
“ (4) In his first paper he stated guinea-pigs reacted to injection of his
organisms by a fever which set in 24 to 48 hours after injection,
and lasted from four to five days, and then suddenly ceased.
In his new paper, two guinea-pigs are described as reacting
specifically to the injection of his organism, but in neither case
did the type of fever bear any resemblance to that described
in his first paper.
“ (5) In the first paper he stated that antigen, made from the bacillus
from cases of Brill’s disease, binds complement in the same
manner as antigen made from the bacillus isolated from cases
of typhus fever. In the second paper, this is shown to be
only partly correct ” (8).

V. HABITS OF THE BODY LOUSE (P. VESTIMENTI).
Since it has been shown that the body louse is the chief (if not the sole)
cause of the spread of typhus fever, the study of the habits of this insect
is of peculiar importance.
PEDICULUS VESTIMENTI, Male (D’apres Piaget), from Les Insectes, Piqueurs et Suceurs,
by Dr. Edmond Sergent, page 29, figure 33.
It- belongs to the Order Siphunculata (synonym Anoplura) of tbe class
Insecta.
Its head is clearly defined, is oval and elongated in shape, and is dis-
tinctly narrower than the thorax. It is provided with a pair of antennae,
each of which is five-jointed.
The thorax is considerably narrower than the abdomen and is provided
with three pairs of legs, but has no wings. There is some degree of segmenta-
tion. Each leg has four segments, the terminal one of which is provided
with a strongly curved claw, suitable for clinging on to objects. This caw
is more developed than it is in the case of P . capitis.
The abdomen is very definitely segmented, and is about five times as long
as the thorax, and is decidedly broader. The last abdominal segment is
rounded off and prominent in the male and deeply notched at the apex m
the female. The margins of the abdomen are of a darker colour than the
rest of the body.
The whole of the body of this insect is covered with hairs. Its integu-
ment is unusually thick. Its colour is taken from the skin of its host, as
was pointed out by Murray. Thus the body louse found on African negroes
and Australian aboriginals is black ; that found on Asiatics is ye ow isn
brown ; that found on the Indians of North and South America is dark brown ;
and that found on Europeans is a dark-grey colour.
The female insect is larger and stronger than the male The former
measures 3*3 mm. in length and I*4 mm. in breadth; whilst the latter
measures 3 mm. in length and about 1 mm. in breadth (1).


The body louse has its habitat on the inner side of those garments worn
next the skin of the host, the seams being the favorite site. It is there
that the female lays her eggs. Even when taking a meal out of the blood
of its host, the louse never entirely lets slip its grip of the garment, so that if
a lousy person is stripped entirely of his clothes, his body is generally free
from these vermin, although that part of the clothing worn next the skin
may be alive with them.
On the other hand, Shipley states that doctors who have returned from
Serbia have often observed on the bodies of wounded Serbians masses of
these vermin of as large a size as half a crown (2).
He records the results of experiments made in regard to the habits
of lice by C. Warburton at the Quick Laboratory, Cambridge, at the request
of the Local Government Board. “ After a great many experiments, Mr.
Warburton succeeded in rearing these delicate insects, but only under
certain circumscribed conditions—one of which was their anchorage in
some sort of flannel or cloth; and the second was proximity to the
human skin. He anchored his specimens on small pieces of cloth
which he interned in small test tubes plugged with cotton wool, which
did not let the lice out, but did let air and the emanations of
the human body in. For fear of breakage, the glass tube was enclosed in
an outer metal tube, and the whole was kept both night and day near the
body. Two meals a day were necessary to keep the lice alive. When feeding,
the pieces of cloth, which the lice would never let go of, were placed on the
back of the hand, hence the danger of escape was practically nil, and once
given access to the skin, the lice feed immediately and greedilv.”
The life of the P. vestimenti is summarized by Warburton as follows :
Incubation period, 8 days to 5 weeks.
From larva to imago, 11 days.
Non-functional mature condition, 4 days.
Adult life. —
(a) Male, 3 weeks.
(b) Female, 4 weeks (2).
The number of eggs laid by the female during her adult life appears to
average five a day (2). Castellani and Chalmers estimate the total number
of eggs laid by each female insect as 70 to 80. The diameter of each egg
is stated to be *7 to -9 millimetres (1). It is of a dirty white colour, of ova!
shape, and is truncated at one end. From this end the young louse emerges.
The other end is attached by means of a sticky substance to the inner side
of a fibre of the underclothing worn by the host (7).
The louse is an extremely delicate insect, and unless it gets its meal of
uman blood regularly it soon dies. It is also a sluggish animal, as it prac-
tically only travels from the garments worn by its host to his skin to feed
and back again (3). Shipley states it requires at least two meals of blood
each day.
Nits have a greater power of resistance, for Warburton has succeeded
in hatching them out after they have been kept for over a month at room
temperatures, which at times fell to below zero (2).

It will thus be seen that unless a person “ accidentally ” picks up a body-
louse, he can only become infested with these vermin if he is in very close
association with a lousy individual or if he or his clothes come into contact
with clothes infested with them. Hence these insects are never found on
the clothes of people who live in ordinarily clean surroundings, or, if acci-
dentally acquired by one individual, are soon got rid of and never tend to
spread in his household.
Factors favouring the spread of body lice are overcrowding, wearing
the same clothes day and night, and want of ordinary cleanliness.
These factors were all markedly present among the poorest classes of
Great Britain and Ireland and of the Continent of Europe till comparatively
recent times, and were always most marked in the most insanitary gaols.
They still exist amongst the poorest classes in many countries at the
present time.
Famines, by increasing the poverty of the people affected, always increase
the total number of people infested with lice.
In times of war, especially in sieges and trenches, the troops rarely get a
chance to get baths or to change their clothing and are all huddled close
together. It is not surprising, therefore, to find that in such conditions
they almost all get infested with lice. This has been found to be the case
in the present war, and was also noted during the South African, Russo-
Japanese, and also the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913. Peacock found that
95 per cent, of all troops examined who had been in the trenches on the
Western front for six months were lousy (9).
During the present war, it has been noted that the unfortunate prisoners
of war in the grossly mismanaged German and Austrian concentration camps
have been badly infested with these vermin (4), (5), (6), (8).
It is, therefore, evident that all those factors that help the development
of body-lice are identical with the factors that favour the spread of typhus
fever.
Zlatogoroff has stated that the naked negroes carried on slave-ships were
never attacked by epidemics of this disease, although they were often
attacked by the other prevalent maladies. This immunity appears to be
due to the" fact that they wore no clothes, and, consequently, provided no
habitat for the Pediculus vestimenti (10).
Nicolle reported that, in order to keep lice alive, it was necessary between
feeds to maintain them at a temperature of between 16°-20° C. This was
confirmed by Anderson and Goldberger, who discovered that, if P. vestimenti
were kept at higher temperatures approximately to that of the body, they
soon perished. They further noted that in Mexico typhus fever is
confined to altitudes of over 6,000 feet, where the climate is temperate.
By inquiries they ascertained that natives infested with body-lice,
coming down from the high altitudes, lose all these parasites in a few
days, though the number of head-lice present on them is unaffected (3).
Head-lice (P. capitis) are very common amongst the lower classes in all
tropical countries (1).

VI. PREVENTION OF TYPHUS FEVER.
(1) Personal Prophylaxis.
This is of especial importance for all medical men, nurses, and attendants
looking after a typhus fever case. They should wear some form of overalls,
in order to prevent infected lice from biting them, and so transmitting to
them the disease.
Flugge suggests the use of rubber gloves and a rubber suit covering the
entire body, including the back of the head. Adhesive plaster should be
worn round the wrists and neck, to keep out the vermin (1).
Davy and Brown recommend a whole suit of overalls, with trousers tucked
into rubber boots ; and rubber gauntlet gloves, extending to above the lower
end of the overalls on the arms (2).
The treatment of cases of the disease in the open air undoubtedly will
tend to diminish the infection amongst the attendants, besides improving
the chances of the patient. Sir Clifford Allbutt, in a letter to The Times ,
stated he had often heard the late Professor Rolleston, of Oxford, advocating
the open-air treatment of typhus. He himself tried it in Leeds during an
epidemic there in the “ sixties,” with the result that the mortality fell
from 16-17 per cent, to 6-7 per cent. (3).
In the outbreak of typhus fever in the City of Tripoli, during the Italian
campaign, the cases were treated in open-air tents, with favorable results (4).
There is no doubt the cool fresh air will prevent the body-lice from moving
about to any great extent.
(2) In a Town infected with the Disease.
In order to stamp out an epidemic of typhus fever in a town the one
essential problem is to free the population entirely of all lice and their nits.
In Tunis, in the year 1909, there were 836 cases of typhus fever. In
1912 systematic destruction of lice and their eggs, found on the clothing and
persons of people infected with typhus fever, and of people living in their
vicinity, was energetically carried out. As a result, according to Nicolle,
the number of cases in that year fell to 22 cases (5).
In 1914 not one case occurred within the town of Tunis itself, though one
case was imported from Algeria, and two from Morocco. Nicolle main-
tained his anti-louse campaign during the whole period (6).
Anderson summarizes the methods to be employed for the destruction
of lice and the consequent eradication of typhus fever, as follows :
“ (1) Measures for the reduction of lice-infestation among the population
in general.”
“ (2) The destruction of all lice and their eggs found on the bodies,
clothing, bedding, and surroundings of all cases of typhus,
typhus suspects, and contacts.”
To carry out this measure there must be prompt notification
to the health authorities of all cases suspected to be typhus.
The house should be visited, and, if found to be louse-free, the
patient may be treated in his own home ; though it would be
probably more satisfactory to send him to an isolation hospital.
AH contacts should, further, be kept under observation for
fourteen days.


“ (3) The adoption of measures, by persons in the vicinity of cases of
typhus, to reduce or prevent the possibility of their being
bitten by lice.”
In this case it is to be remembered that the louse can be
found only in places recently and intimately occupied by the
person affected.
“ (4) Inoculation with the mild type of the disease (Brill’s Disease) by
persons contemplating entering localities where typhus is
prevalent. Should Plotz’s work be confirmed the use of a
vaccine prepared from the typhus fever germ may be sub-
stituted for this.” (7).
(3) In Trench Warfare.
The following rules will be of value in keeping the number of lice present
under control, and so minimizing the risk of typhus :
(1) Clothes should be changed as often as possible. If practicable,
different clothes should be worn at night time.
(2) Clothing worn next the skin should be boiled as often as practicable.
(3) A hot iron pressed along the clothing kills the lice and their eggs.
Special attention should be given to the seams—the favorite
haunt of the parasites.
(4) Failing everything else, picking the lice off the clothing is of some
slight service.

VII. LIST OF PEDICULICIDES.
Castellan! and Jackson record results obtained by the use of various
substances for the destruction of lice and their eggs. These trials were all
carried out on a very large scale amongst the troops and prisoners of war
in Serbia during the epidemic that prevailed in that country in the first half
of the year 1915.
I. Heat.
(1) Steam. —It was found that steam kills lice and their nits in 10
minutes if properly applied. If failure resulted, it was invariably found
to have been due to faulty technique —for the question is simply one
of proper exposure to and penetration of the articles by steam. The
articles to be treated should be spread out to enable the steam to reach
all recesses. For instance, it was found that lice, if placed in the centre
of a large bundle of woollen clothing very tightly packed, could survive
steam under moderate pressure (1). Bacot has recently demonstrated that
lice and their eggs are killed either by exposure to any heat or by submersion
in water at a temperature of 55° C. (131° F.) for a period of 35 minutes.
He further found that dipping pieces of cloth into water at a temperature
of 98*4° C. (209-1° F.) killed nits within half a minute. The eggs turned
opaque white, presumably as a result of the coagulation of their albumen (2).
11. Gaseous Pediculicides.
(1) Castellani and Jackson found that sulphur fumes proved a most
efficient liceicide, provided the room (in which the articles were to be treated)
was rendered approximately air tight by pasting up all openings with paper.
Further, the articles should not be packed too tightly.
They also state that the articles must be exposed for a sufficient time to
the sulphur fumes, and that a sufficient amount of sulphur must be burnt,
They do not specify either the amount of sulphur per 1,000 cubic feet of air
required, or the time during which the articles should be exposed (1)*
They state, however, that sulphur fumes have no effect on nits. A
second fumigation carried out several days later would be necessary to kill
these after they had developed (1).
A paper by' Galewsky, describing experiments undertaken by himself
at Konigsbruck for freeing war prisoners’ camps from lice, shows, however,
that sulphur fumes under proper conditions do kill nits. He selected a
building occupied by Russian prisoners of war, nearly all of whom were
infested with lice. The floor space of this building was 450 square metres ;
the height was not recorded. All corners and crevices were first sprayed
out with a 3 per cent, solution of cresol soapy disinfectant, and 25 kilos of
sulphur were then burnt in sixteen sulphur burners made on the style of
the Bunsen burner. The men’s clothing was hung up loosely, with the
exception of two bundles of shirts which were tied up tightly. After an
interval of three hours the door and windows were opened, when it was found
that the lice and their nits had been killed everywhere. The only exceptions
were found to be the two bundles of tightly packed shirts (3).
If the height of this building be taken as 10 feet, then Galewsky succeeded
in killing all lice and their nits, in the loosely arranged clothing, by burning
one pound of sulphur to each 1,000 cubic feet of air space in three hours.


It would appear probable that the time of exposure (eight hours) to
sulphur dioxide (3 lbs. to every 1,000 cubic feet of space) required by the
Regulations made under the Quarantine Act 1908-1915 of the Commonwealth
of Australia, is more than sufficient to kill all lice and nits present in loosely
arranged clothing.
(2) Hydrocyanic acid gas has been recommended as a pediculicide.
From experiments carried out at the Boston Quarantine Station, Grubbs
believes that all lice in unopened hand baggage will be killed by 30 minutes’
exposure to this gas, generated from 3 ounces of sodium cyanide to each
100 cubic feet of air space, if combined with 15 inches of vacuum. At the
end of this time air should be admitted.
In the case of large unopened trunks, the amount of sodium cyanide used
should be increased to 4 ounces and the vacuum to 20 inches of mercury (6).
111. Solid and Liquid Insecticides.
The following results were obtained by Castellani and Jackson
(1) Kerosene, benzine, and gasoline were all found to kill lice at once.
The obstacle to their use is the objectionable smell they possess.
Nevertheless they were largely used in Serbia—being sprayed
on to the naked bodies of the troops. Little dermatitis was
observed to follow their use (1).
(At the Boston Quarantine Station, gasoline is used for
spraying the bodies of typhus fever suspects.
The formula used is composed as follows :
Parts
Soap chips or laundry soap .. \
Soft water .. _ #
Gasoline .... 4
Dissolve the soap by boiling in the water, remove from the
fire and add the gasoline. Stir the mixture until it becomes
a creamy mass of even texture without signs of either gasoline
or soap. This hardens in a few hours to the consistencv of
stiff jelly. J
For spraying, this stock is mixed with five to ten parts
of hot water and used while warm, in order to lessen the chilling
effects of the spray on the body.”
After this spraying, each person is thoroughly washed by
walking for 10 feet under a shower, at a slow rate, for the water
in the bath is always kept knee deep (6).)
(2) Vaseline, lard, and lanoline were also found to kill lice instan-
taneously.
(3) Guiacol (mixed with zinc oxide in the proportion of 2 to 100) is a
powerful insecticide. It kills lice, bed bugs, or fleas in from
... A 10 t 0 15 mlnutes - Again the main objection is its smell
(4) Amse preparations (onethol and aniselte) mixed with zinc oxide
in the proportions of 2 to 100, kill body lice in from 30 to 60
... , “ e \ % also kill fleas and bed-bugs in a few hours.
(5) locioform. It kills body lice within 40 minutes; its action on
bed-bugs and fleas, however, is feeble.


(6) Carbolic acid (in the strength of 5 per cent.) kills body lice within
20 minutes. Its effect on fleas and bed-bugs is not known.
Cyllin, izal, and lyson have a similar action on lice to car-
bolic acid.
(7) Napthaline. —This is considered the best liceicide amongst troops
on a large scale. Its smell is not objectionable, and it kills
these insects within 3 hours. Its action on bed-bugs is feebler.
It must never be mixed with zinc oxide.
(8) Camphor. —This substance kills lice within 6 hours.
(9) Menthol powder. —If mixed with zinc oxide in the proportion of
gr. X to 1 oz. it was found to be fatal to lice within an
hour. It is also a powerful insecticide against fleas, but is not
so deadly to bed-bugs.
It is considered by Castellani and Jackson to be the best
liceicide amongst the better classes.
(10) Pyretham was shown to be of little use against lice, but was found
to kill bed-bugs within 8 hours.
(11) Oil of citrondla is fatal to lice within 3 hours.
They record that boric acid, sulphur, perchloride of mercury, and sulphate
of zinc had no fatal effect on lice at all (1).
It is of interest to note, however, that Eysell, head physician to the War
College of Cassel, considers that precipitated sulphur ( not “ flowers of sul-
phur ”) is of great value as a pediculifuge. To use this remedy as a pro-
phylactic agent against body lice, the garments worn next the skin should
be “ turned inside out, and some of the precipitated sulphur loosely but
liberally sprinkled over a small smoothed out area, and then the powder is
evenly rubbed into the texture of the fabric. Proceeding thus from spot
to spot the entire garment is liberally impregnated with the pedrcuhfuge
“ Or a small bag, made of two thicknesses of muslin, is half-filled with the
sulphur, and then the garment is pounded with it, very evenly of course.
Socks, abdominal band, and neckwear must also be treated, but ‘he impreg
nation of outer garments is useless. Ordinarily, a well applied loading of
sulphur will last about i weeks, but Dr. Eysell advises that in the case of
persons who perspire freely, the process may have to be repeated every two
weeks” (4).
Peacock considers the best pediculicide to be “ N.C.I”, composed of-
Napthalene .. • • • • ' * * * 2°/°
Creosote . • • • * * * ’ * * no/
lodoform . • • • • * * * ’ *. 0
One complete application of this preparation to the clothing acts as a
de * Vermicelli and “Crude Oil Ointment” (composed of 4.ounces
of crude tar oil added to 2 pounds of soft melted paraffin) are both most
believes the best results to be obtained by during the clothes
with “ N.C.1.” and applying either ointment to the seams. Thi
should be repeated every five days or so. ~ ~ r
Soaking in cresol solution (1J per cent.) for one hour or in chloride of
lime (7 per cent.) cold solution for 24 hours is quite effective (5).

VIII. IMMUNE CARRIERS OF INFECTED LICE.
Kantor states that during the years 1914 and 1915 three cases of typhus
fever have developed amongst immigrants from the Continent of Europe
within fourteen days of their arrival in the United States. In each case the
vessel which brought them was over fourteen days out on arrival. It would
appear, therefore, that they were infected on the vessel, and not on shore,
before embarkation. Kantor considers it probable that they were bitten
by infected body-lice on board ship, and it is probable that they acquired
these lice from some fellow-passengers—themselves immune to typhus fever,
probably through a previous attack of the disease. He believes that a good
method of preventing this happening would be to detain all immigrants from
places known to be seriously infected with typhus fever for fourteen days
(the period of incubation of the disease) at the port of embarkation ; and,
during that time, take the necessary measures to destroy all lice on them and
on their clothing (1).

IX. CLINICAL HISTORY.
The incubation period is usually stated to be from four to fourteen days ;
but it almost invariably lasts about twelve days.
Ker records a case in Edinburgh where he believes the incubation period
to have lasted seventeen days (1) ; whilst Skutetzky, who was in charge of an
Austrian Concentration Camp at the beginning of 1915, when an outbreak
occurred among some Kussian prisoners of war, states that the maximum
period of incubation is sixteen days (2).
The onset is almost invariably very abrupt, the first symptom being an
extremely severe frontal headache. It is usually accompanied by great
prostration and chilliness, and a slight shivering or even actual rigors may
occur. These symptoms are often accompanied by nausea and vomiting.
The temperature begins to rise with the onset of the headache, and is
usually accompanied by anorexia and insomnia. There is mental dulness
from the first; and the patient rarely keeps on his feet after the second day.
At this time the facies of the patient bears some resemblance to that of a
person suffering from yellow fever—the face being very red and swollen and
dull looking, whilst the conjunctives are very markedly congested. Enlarge-
ment of the spleen usually occurs very early in the course of the disease.
The temperature attains its maximum on about the third or fourth day,
when it reaches 104° or 105° F. Thereafter it retains its continued high
level, with little or no remission in the mornings.
On the first evening of the period of invasion the temperature rarely
exceeds 100*5 F., but often remits the next morning to nearly normal.
After this it generally rapidly rises to the high level, though it may reach it
by step-like rises, after the manner of typhoid fever.
The eruption appears between the third and fifth day of the disease
usually the fourth.
Ker describes three main elements in the rash “ First, spots appear
on the surface of the skin. In appearance they resemble very closely those
of enteric fever. They are rose pink in colour, and, for the first few hours
of their existence, are distinctly raised above the surface of the skin, and fade
easily on pressure. Afterwards, however, they lose their raised character,
and within a couple of days become a dirty brown colour, and cease to dis-
appear on pressure.
As regards distribution, this rash is present all over the bodv except the
face, but is usually most profuse on the trunk, particularly on the back. The
spots are somewhat irregular in outline, and give a measly appearance to
the skin of the patient.
The second element of the eruption consists of similar spots, lying not on
the skin, but faintly seen, as it were, beneath it, and causing that marbled
appearance which is known as ‘ subcuticular mottling.’ This is well seen
on the trunk, and perhaps best of all in the axillae, and may be best appreciated
in a shaded light.
“ Lastly, true haemorrhage may occur either into existing spots, or inde-
pendently of them, giving rise to dark purple “ petechia?,” exceedingly like
flea bites, but lacking the central scar.
“ All these elements, taken together, form what has been described by
Jenner as the ‘ mulberry ’ rash of typhus ”•(!).


The severity of the disease is usually in proportion to the amount of the
eruption. Petechiae often do not appear in very mild cases, whilst true
purpuric haemorrhage only occurs in severe cases.
In mild cases the whole eruption is very slight, but the raised spots and
subcuticular mottling occur in all cases, though they may be but poorly
developed. In mild cases amongst coloured races the first two forms of
eruption may not be noticed, and the disease may pass unrecognised in the
absence of petechiae (3).
The rash begins to disappear about the eighth day of the fever, but the
staining (particularly if the petechiae have been numerous) may persist for
several days after the fall of the temperature to normal.
During the height of the disease the patient has a very characteristic,
unpleasant odour, resembling that of rotten straw or of mice (1).
The temperature maintains its high level of 103° to 105*' F., with little
or no morning remissions till the period of defervescence begins. This occurs
between the twelfth and seventeenth days of the fever, usually between the
thirteenth and fifteenth. It generally takes two days to reach normal,
falling by rapid lysis. Occasionally it falls by crisis within a few hours to
normal. A sign of impending death is a rapid rise of the temperature.
Occasionally about the tenth or eleventh day a sudden fall -in the tem-
perature occurs, but this only lasts for a few hours, and it then regains its
old level.
A leucocytosis is usually noticed after the appearance of the eruption.
The headache, which almost always ushers in the period of invasion, persists
into the period of eruption. The patient is usually apathetic and dull during
the day, and restless and sleepless at night. There is almost invariably some
delirium, which, during the first week, may be of a very violent type. In
the second week he passes into the typical typhoid state.
The stage of convalesence is rapid, with no complications. “ A week after
the crisis the patient is quite willing to get out of bed, and is apparently
perfectly able to do so. Many patients have no recollection of their fever
at all. Others, however, carry with them for life a vivid memory of the
hallucinations which haunted them in their delirium ” (1).
Relapses appear to be unknown, and the only common complication is
parotitis.
Morbid Anatomy.
“ Th e spleen is enlarged and engorged if the post mortem takes place up
to the middle of the second week, but not later. There is oedema of the
lungs and hypostatic pneumonia, cloudy swelling, and fatty degeneration of
the°heart, cloudy swelling of the liver and kidneys, and hypersemia of all the
organs ” (3).
Differential Diagnosis.
The diseases that may be confused with typhus fever are—
(l) Lobar Pneumonia. —The physical signs of the disease, the rusty
sputum, and the absence of the “ mulberry ” rash of typhus
should be sufficient to distinguish this disease.


(2) Cerebrospinal Meningitis. —ln this disease the petechise are fewer
in number, widely scattered, and there is no subjacent rash.
In addition, the head retration, the presence of Kernig’s sign,
and the result obtained on lumbar puncture, should sufficiently
diagnose this disease.
(3) Malaria. —The presence of the parasite of malaria in the blood,
and the remissions of the temperature, should easily enable
this disease to be excluded.
(4) Yellow Fever. —During the first stages of both these diseases the
flushed face and congested conjunctivse may cause confusion ;
but otherwise there is no resemblance between these two
diseases.
(5) Relapsing Fever. —This should be easily distinguished by finding
the spirochsetes in the blood, and by the relapse.
(6) Influenza may be difficult to distinguish from a mild case of typhus
with a poorly-developed rash.
(7) Plague (especially the septicsemic form) may resemble typhus
closely. It should be distinguished by finding the plague
bacilli in the blood, the sputum, or the buboes, as the case may
be.
(8) Small-pox is easily distinguished by the fact that the rash occurs
on the face.
(9) Measles, especially if the rash is fading, may closely resemble
typhus. But the coryza and bronchitis of measles, and the
fact that the rash invades the face, should enable a conclusion
to be arrived at. The spots of measles are more raised, have
a brighter colour, and are more likely to assume crescentic
arrangements.
(10) Typhoid Fever. —A severe case of typhoid fever, with copious
spots, may simulate typhus ; a mild case of typhus, with few
spots, may resemble typhoid.
Ker gives six points to be remembered :—-
(1) A very definitely sudden onset is strongly against typhoid.
(2) The appearance of the patient; the absence of the flushed face
and “ drunken expression ” in the case of typhoid.
(3) The pupils are often dilated in typhoid ; they are usually con-
tracted in typhus.
(4) The congestion of the conjunctivse, in the case of typhus, and its
absence, in the case of typhoid.
(5) The failure of the temperature of a case of typhus to show the
“ morning remissions,” so characteristic of typhoid.
(6) The absence of subcuticular mottling, and true petechise, in the
case of typhoid fever (1).
It may also be noted that the rash of typhoid fever always comes out in
crops. This is not the case in typhus fever.
Further, it is a very rare thing for the typhoid rash to invade either the
arms or the legs of the patient.


Remlinger, in common with other French workers, has noticed that,
whilst a patient suffering from either typhoid or paratyphoid fever can
easily protrude his tongue, a typhus patient could only do so at the cost of a
very great effort.
It would appear as if the tongue was stuck to the palate, or drawn back-
wards to the larynx (4).
In addition to these points, there are two bacteriological tests to be made
in a case of typhoid fever, to distinguish it further from typhus.
(1) Typhoid bacilli are almost always demonstrable in the blood of
patients suffering from typhoid fever during the first week
of the disease ; and in most cases during the second and even
the third weeks, or during a relapse.
The bacilli can also be recovered from the stools, but with
more difficulty ; and, after the third week, in the urine, in a
certain proportion of cases of this disease.
(2) The Widal reaction is obtained in almost all cases of typhoid
fever after the end of the first week of the disease.
One fallacy to this test is that a patient suffering from typhus fever
may have had typhoid fever some time before ; but this fact can usually
be discovered on inquiry.
These two tests are conclusive for all practical purposes.

II. ACUTE ANTERIOR POLIOMYELITIS.




II. ACUTE ANTERIOR POLIOMYELITIS.
I. SYMPTOMATOLOGY.
A. Period of Incubation.
Wickman considers it may last one day ; Batten believes, upon clinical
grounds, it is less than four days, although he states that from experimental
findings it should last for five or six days ; whilst Romer considers its average
duration to be a week or rarely longer than ten days (1).
B. Prodromal Symptoms.
Paralysis may set in suddenly without any prodromal symptoms, sug-
gesting the term “ paralysis of the morning ” adopted by West in 1852 ;
but usually the period of incubation lasts from one to seven days, on an
average two or three days (1).
The symptoms most commonly noticed are restlessness, irritability, and
pain on being touched (usually most pronounced if one of the lower limbs be
moved). A temperature of 100°-103° F. is usually recorded. The fever is
most often constant, but may remit when paralysis occurs.
Other symptoms noted are vomiting, sometimes constipation, sometimes
diarrhoea, stiffness of the neck, headache and convulsions. Occasionally
the most pronounced symptom is catarrh of the respiratory tract.
Frost records that, out of 68 cases investigated in lowa, U.S.A., in 1910,
the following symptoms were present: —

(17).
C. Various Forms.
Wickman has described eight types of the disease. Many individual
cases are intermediate between two of these types.
(1) Abortive Type. —This consists of the prodromal symptoms entirely
without any subsequent paralysis. Romer distinguishes a
type between this form and the ordinary spinal form in which
a temporary weakness of a muscle or group of muscles occurs,
but clears up entirely without any trace of paralysis (1).


(2) Spinal Type. —This is the classical variety of the disease, and is
most frequently met with.
It is usually ushered in with prodromal symptoms, but
occasionally paralysis is the first sign met with.
It is generally noted that the child cannot stand or run about
(owing to involvement of the lower limbs) or that it is unable
to move one arm or one leg.
In this form the paralysis is of the lower motor neurone
type, with flaccid paralysis of the affected muscle groups.
At first the paresis met with may be very general—quite often
all four limbs are affected.
Usually the constitutional symptoms disappear within a
day or two of the advent of this stage, but pain on movement
of the affected part may persist for ten days or a fortnight.
Retention of urine may occur for the first day or two. The
deep reflexes are depressed or abolished during this stage,
the superficial reflexes are preserved unless the muscles
affected are themselves paralyzed. Cutaneous sensibility is
not diminished at all. This stage of general paresis generally
begins to disappear after the first few days, and movement
in all limbs (except the paralyzed parts) begins to reappear.
The paralyzed limb, however, hangs helpless and is now noted
to be definitely colder than the rest of the body.. By this time
the deep reflexes will have reappeared everywhere except in
the affected limb or limbs. During the stage of general paresis,
far more muscle groups appear to be affected than is subse-
quently found to be the case.
At the end of three weeks, the stage of repair begins and
lasts for about eighteen months. Very often many muscles,
apparently quite paralyzed at the end of three weeks, regain
their functions and finally only one or two muscles may remain
affected. The electrical reactions of the affected muscles are
of great importance during this period as regards prognosis.
“ Those muscles which, although paralyzed, never completely
lose their faradic excitability may be confidently expected to
recover their function. Muscles which lose their faradic
excitability, and in which the galvanic response is slow and
more easily produced by the anodic than the cathodic closure
current, have undergone the reaction of degeneration. Their
fate hangs in the balance until either (1) the galvanic response
becomes quicker and more natural, which is of good omen
and precedes the return of voluntary contraction and faradic
excitability; or (2) the galvanic response becomes gradually
more difficult to obtain and finally disappears, denoting a
complete and permanent destruction ” (2).
The lower extremities are far more often affected than the
upper.
If more than one limb be affected, there is no symmetry as
regards the muscles paralyzed on each side.


The peronei and the quadriceps extensor are the muscle
groups most frequently affected; others often paralyzed
include those of the shoulder and buttocks. The abdominal
muscles are often affected but are frequently overlooked.
Those affected least of all are the muscles of the neck and
back (1).
During the stage of repair “ some muscles gradually shrink and
become useless, others after a period of paralysis and atrophy
slowly become restored to a condition approaching, if not equal
to, their former competence, and the effect of the disease on
the growth and nutrition of the limbs becomes more and more
apparent. Examination now reveals unmistakable wasting of the
affected muscles resulting in almost complete loss of soft tissue
in certain regions, or in other cases, chiefly young children,
in the replacement of the muscles by fatty deposits. The
skin over these parts is generally colder, more purple in hue,
and either more dry or more clammily moist than elsewhere.
Lax muscles lead to alterations in joints, and with the occur-
rence of permanent shortening in other muscles, combine to
produce serious deformities. The chief factor in the pro-
duction of the shortening is the unopposed action and tone
of a healthy muscle, its antagonist being paralyzed. This
may be assisted in an increase in the connective tissue of the
muscle due to the degeneration of some of its fibres when it
has not completely escaped. Bones to which many paralyzed
muscles are attached cease to grow in children, although in
rare cases, actual elongation of a bone, due probably to traction
on the epiphyses, may take place. As a general rule, shortening
is present and trophic changes in the bone may be demon-
strated ” (2).
The most common resulting deformities are “ talipes equino-
varus and valgus, pes calcaneus, contractions of the knee in
a flexed position, scoliosis and lordosis. The growth of healthy
parts emphasizes the small size of the paralyzed member or
members ” (2).
(3) Type resembling Landry's Disease. —This is either of the ascending
or descending type. Most commonly it starts with paralysis
of the lower extremities ; then paresis of the bladder and
bowels occurs ; then paralysis of the upper extremities. Finally
the muscles of respiration become affected, owing to the
medullary centres becoming involved and a fatal termination
of the disease occurs in the course of a few days.
Sometimes the paralysis involves the upper limbs first and
then the lower, so that the disease is simultaneously ascending
and descending (1).
Wickman and Romer appear to be convinced that this
type of the disease and Landry’s Disease are always identical,
but Neustaedter believes them to be different entities (3).


(4) Bulbar or Pontine Type.— ln this the nuclei of one or more cranial
nerves are involved with consequent paralysis of the muscles
supplied. The nerve most frequently affected is the facial.
The hypoglossal, the abducens, the motor oculi, and the tri-
geminal nerves have also been affected.
Nystagmus has been noted on several occasions (1).
(5) Ataxic Type. In this group the ataxia resembles the ataxia of
Friedrich s Disease. ‘ Zappert .... prefers to classify
such cases in the pontine group. Wickman, on the other
hand, holds that all the ataxic cases are not due to a lesion
in the pons or medulla, but that some are caused by lesions
of the cerebellum, mid-brain, or Clarke’s column ” (1).
(6) Polyneuritic Type.—ln this variety the cases show very definite
sensory symptoms with slight paralysis, soon tending to dis-
appear.
(7) Cerebral Types.— The lesions are in the cells of the cerebral cortex
with consequent spastic paralysis of the affected muscle groups,
sometimes paraplegia and sometimes hemiplegia.
% ( 8 ) Meningitic Type.— The symptoms produced in this type of the
disease vomiting, headache, pain in the neck, pain and
stiffness in the spine, and a slight degree of opsithotonos ”
are due to marked infiltration of the pia mater during the
course of the disease. This type is clinically very difficult
to distinguish from cerebro-spinal meningitis (1).
In all these types, characteristic changes take place in the cerebro-spinal
fluid. It is almost always clear and definitely increased in amount so that
on lumbar puncture it comes out under varying degrees of pressure. Exami-
nation of the smear for organisms gives negative results. The albumen and
globulin present are increased in amount. There is usually well-marked
reduction of Fehling s solution. The cellular increase varies from slightly
above normal to over 900 cells per cubic millimetre. In the early stages of
the disease the polymorphonuclear cell may predominate. But soon the
small mononuclear cells or lymphocytes form a large majority (up to 90 per
cent, or even higher) of the total number of cells present. Abramson is of
the opinion that the presence of the large mononuclear cell in appreciable
numbers in a clear fluid is extremely suggestive of poliomyelitis (46), (47).
Abramson considers the clear cerebro-spinal fluids of the following diseases
require differential diagnosis from that of infantile paralysis
(1) Meningism accompanying pneumonia, the acute infectious diseases,
and some cases of gastro-enteritis. The fluids obtained in
these cases show “ no increase in cells, no albumen or globulin,
and a prompt and heavy reduction of Fehling’s solution.”
(2) Epidemic Cerebro-spinal Meningitis.— ' The spinal fluids of
patients recovering from epidemic meningitis present con-
siderable difficulty in differentiation. They are, however,
distinctly more turbid than the poliomyelitis fluids ; there
is a persistence of a high polymorphonuclear count; high
albumen-globulin test. These findings in conjunction with
the clinical features of the case tend to clear the diagnosis.”


(3) Tuberculous Meningitis. —The tubercle bacillus can only be dis-
covered in the fluid in about 50 per cent of cases. There is
a very great preponderance of small mononuclear cells (85 to
100 per cent, of the total count), and the large mononuclear
cell is rarely seen. There is generally a higher albumen-globulin
content and decidedly less Fehling-reducing substance present
than in the poliomyelitis fluids.
Further the clinical history is of great value ; an acute
onset with a high fever of 103° F. very strongly suggests
infantile paralysis (47).
Abramson considers that it is impossible to say too much of
the value of the examination of the cerebro-spinal fluid obtained
by lumbar puncture in the differential diagnosis of poliomye-
litis. “ The albumen and globulin content is graded in +
signs, beginning with zb and ascending to 4+, depending on
quantity of precipitate. A zb is considered as that very faint
haze present in normal fluids, and 4 + , the maximum, repre-
sents the very heavy precipitate obtained most commonly
in purulent fluids. The reduction of Fehling’s solution is
graded, negative when there is no red precipitate at the end
of fifteen minutes ; Izb when there is a slight precipitate at
the end of that time ; 2 + when there is a moderate precipi-
tate ; and 3+, the maximum, when there is an immediate
and heavy reduction. This latter reaction is encountered in
practically all normal fluids ” (47).
D. Morbidity Kate.
This varies greatly in different epidemics according to whether many
“ abortive ” cases are reported or not.
Wickman found—
In children up to 11 years —Morbidity rate, 10*5 per cent.
In patients over 11 years —Morbidity rate, 27 ’6 per cent ” (1).
Batten believes it to average 11 to 12 per cent. (4).
In the epidemic in New York of 1916, the rate was approximately 23 -5
per cent. (5).
Apart from death resulting from the involvement of the respiratory
centres by the virus, the commonest causes of a fatal termination are bronchial
and pulmonary complications (2).
E. Recovery from Paralysis.
Wickman believes that at least 20 per cent, of all cases recover without
any permanent paralysis (1). From cases investigated in England during
1913, Newsholme is of opinion that fully 70 per cent, of all cases either
perish or remain permanently crippled for life (6).
II. MORBID ANATOMY OF THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM.
The same pathological changes are found both in fatal cases of acute
poliomyelitis in human beings and in the experimental poliomyelitis of
monkeys.


In each the change may not he limited to the spinal cord, but may also
be found in a disseminated condition in the cerebrum, cerebellum, pons
medulla, and meninges. ’ ’
The changes are usually more marked in the case of monkeys than of
human beings.
Microscopically the changes may not be at all obvious, but in monkeys
especially they are often very definite. “On removal of the skull cap, the
pressure within the dura is found to be raised, there is an excessive flow of
clear cerebro-spinal fluid when the dura is turned down. The pia-mater on
the surface of the brain is congested, the surface itself is shiny and moist.
... The convolutions are often flattened. On section the brain is
markedly oedematous.
“The changes in the spinal cord are more constant. The dura is more
distended than usual, and an excessive amount of fluid escapes when it is
opened. In quite acute cases only is there a slight opacity, with a corres-
ponding increase in the number of cells present (lymphocytes). Generally
it is quite clear. The pia mater is congested. The cord is moist, smooth,
and in some cases softer than normal, although without any true softening
being present. The grey matter is distinctly more red than normal; this is
most marked in the segments corresponding to the paralysis. The Interior
horns are most aflected, but frequently the whole grey matter stands out in
a red-violet colour. On looking closely, minute drops of blood are seen in
the grey matter ; microscopical examination shows that these are almost
always haemorrhages into the substance of the cord. The white matter
appears quite normal or perhaps slightly oedematous ” (1).
Microscopically the pia mater, both of the spinal cord and of the brain,
may be affected. The change is usually most marked in the lumbar enlarge-
ment of the cord, is more definite on the anterior than on the posterior surface
of the cord, and usually most marked of all in the anterior fissure of the cord.
The. change consists of a round-celled infiltration, partly diffuse and
partly in connexion with the walls of the blood vessels. These infiltrated
blood vessels can often be seen running outwards to the anterior
horns.
Similar changes may be seen in the pia mater of the brain, particularly
in monkeys experimentally inoculated.
In the substance of the brain and the spinal cord, the changes are seen
to affect mainly the grey matter. Even in monkeys infected by intra-cerebral
inoculation, the spinal cord is far more often and more profoundly affected
than the brain, and the parts of the cord most affected are usually the lumbar
and cervical enlargements.
Although the posterior horns are often affected, yet the greatest changes
are always observed in the anterior horns.
The most marked change is a diffuse round-celled infiltration around
the blood vessels, especially the veins. Patches of round cells may also be
seen in the grey matter apart from the blood vessels. The vessels are full
of blood corpuscles, and haemorrhages into the substance of the grey matter
are often observed. It is also noticed that the cord in the affected part is
oedematous.


The other change noticed in the grey matter affected is an alteration in
the ganglion cells. Homer distinguishes three varieties of change that may
occur. In the first, the ganglion cells simply disappear—probably owing
to oedema. In the second, they lose their polygonal shape and the nucleus
stains badly. In the third variety they are invaded by round cells, “ the
latter devour the former until nothing is left of the substance of the ganglion
cells and only the swollen round cells remain.” This process is called
“ neuronophagy.” It is far more commonly observed in monkeys than in
human cases, and Homer believes this to be due to the acuter nature of the
illness in the former.
Tissue infiltration in the neighbourhood of the central canal is only slight,
but the blood vessels (especially the veins) are usually much infiltrated.
Similar changes in the grey matter of the medulla, pons, cerebrum, and
cerebellum may be found, but the affected areas are usually smaller and
more scattered. In monkeys experimentally inoculated, the changes are
usually seen in the cerebrum at the site of inoculation.
III. EXPERIMENTAL POLIOMYELITIS IN MONKEYS.
Landsteiner was the first (sth April, 1909) to succeed in transmitting
the disease to monkeys. He inoculated two monkeys intraperitoneally with
an emulsion of the spinal cord of a child who had died on the fifth day of an
attack of poliomyelitis. One became ill on the sixth day, and died on the
eighth ; the second gradually developed paralysis between the twelfth and
seventeenth days, which became complete in both legs. It was killed on the
nineteenth day (1).
The pathological changes were more marked in the first than in the second
monkey, and, in each case, were those of typical poliomyelitis.
In the November of the same year Homer, Flexner and Lewis, Leiner and
V. Wiesner, and Landsteiner and Levaditi, all independently succeeded in
infecting monkeys with poliomyelitis, by inoculating them intracerebrally
with emulsions of spinal cords obtained from children who had died from
acute attacks of poliomyelitis. Further, they were all able to infect a second
series of monkeys with emulsions of the spinal cords of the first monkeys.
This definitely proved that the infective matter in the spinal cord was not a
toxin, but a living virus.
In only about 60 per cent, of inoculations with emulsions of infective
human cord was poliomyelitis produced in monkeys ; whereas, when the
emulsion of an infected cord of a monkey was inoculated, the percentage of
successes was over 90. Flexner and Lewis believe this to be due to the virus
having to undergo in the first case some biological alteration in changing its
host. In intracerebral inoculations of monkeys the period of incubation
appears to average about nine days (from 3 to 33 days) (Homer) (1).
Certain prodromal symptoms may appear, such as general dulness or
irritability ; occasionally gastro-intestinal symptoms may be noticed. The
paralysis generally appears suddenly, and, in spite of the fact that the
monkey was inoculated intracerebrally, it is almost always of the flaccid
type, and begins at the lower extremities.
Homer found that the paralysis started either in the opposite leg to the
side of the brain inoculated or in both legs simultaneously in nineteen cases
out of twenty.


The lower extremities are also usually more severely affected than the
upper. Romer found that 76 per cent, of monkeys inoculated died of para-
lysis, 6 per cent, survived paralyzed, and 18 per cent, completely recovered.
Death usually occurred two to six days after the paralysis was first noticed.
Several instances of bulbar paralysis (of the facial, oculomotor, and
hypoglossal nerves) have been observed. One monkey experimentally
inoculated by Flexner and Lewis showed definite nystagmus (1).
Romer has observed two cases in which slight transient paralysis occurred,
but soon after disappeared. He regards these as definitely “ abortive ”
cases, and further considers that it is very difficult to recognise an abortive
case, as the paralysis must be fairly well marked before it can be observed (1).
The most certain way of producing the experimental form of the disease
is by intracerebral inoculation. Monkeys can also be infected by inoculation
into nervous tissue (such as the sciatic nerve or the anterior chamber of the
eye), or by rubbing the nasopharynx with infected material. In the latter
case, the surface of the nasopharynx must be slightly damaged. It is con-
sidered by Flexner and Clarke that the infected material reaches the brain
and spinal cord in this case via the olfactory nerves (7).
Romer records that Leiner and V. Weisner have infected monkeys by
inoculation into the trachea. They have also infected them through the
alimentary tract, by first starving them for 12—24 hours, and giving opium
to diminish the peristaltic action, and then by feeding them with infected
material. Further, they produced the disease by direct injection into a loop
of small intestine (1).
It is much more difficult to infect monkeys by intravenous injection ; a
far larger dose has to be given (250 cubic centimetres of the emulsion instead
of -2 or *3 c.c. intracerebrally). In such cases the incubation period is
greatly prolonged if the operation prove successful. But there is a larger
proportion of unsuccessful cases in intravenous injections, even with such
massive doses of infective material (7).
Monkeys are the only animals that can be used for experimental produc-
tion of the disease.
With the exception of the rabbit, all other animals have proved complete
failures. Krause and Meinicke have produced paralysis by injecting infected
material into rabbits.
Romer does not consider this paralysis to be true anterior poliomyelitis,
because—
(l) Rabbits are notoriously liable to be affected easily by any morbid
process.
(2) They are more easily affected by intravenous than intracerebral
injections of infected material.
(3) The spleen pulp and the blood of human cases have also produced
this form of paralysis in rabbits, whereas they always fail to do
so in monkeys, even by intracerebral injections.
(4) The injection of B. coli or of streptococci or of other morbid material
also produces similar experimental paralysis in rabbits.
Romer, therefore, concludes it is impossible to produce true poliomyelitis
ia rabbits (1).


IV. THE SPECIFIC VIRUS.
The virus is found chiefly in the central nervous system of cases of human
infantile paralysis and of poliomyelitis experimentally produced in monkeys.
It occurs more often in the spinal cord than in the brain and most commonly
of all in the lumbar and cervical enlargements. It is almost always found
in the grey substance and particularly in the anterior cornua of the cord.
It has also been found in the mesenteric lymphatic glands, by Flexner
and Lewis (1).
Further, during the Swedish epidemic of 1911, Kling, Wernstedt, and
Pettersson found the virus to be present in the secretions of the mouth, the
nasopharynx, and of the intestine of acute cases of the disease, of convalescents,
and of apparently healthy persons who had been “ contacts.” In one case,
the secretions of a convalescent case remained infective for seven months,
but usually they become free from virus in the course of four weeks (8).
These results have been corroborated by other observers. Sawyer
demonstrated the presence of the virus in intestinal secretions sixteen days
after paralysis occurred during an epidemic in Northern California in
1913 (9).
Outside the human body the virus has been demonstrated in the dust of
the rooms of patients presumably contaminated by their secretions by
Neutstaedter and Thro (17).
Howard and Clark have shown the presence of the virus on the bodies
and in the intestines of flies that had been allowed to feed on infected cords
or on materials containing the same. Its presence on the bodies of the flies
was demonstrated for at least 24 to 48 hours, and in the intestines for six
hours afterwards (10).
Properties of the Virus. —Flexner and Lewis and Landsteiner and Levaditi
were the first to demonstrate that the virus would pass through the pores of
a filter (such as the Berkefeld) sufficiently small to hold back ordinary
bacteria (1).
Eomer has shown that it will remain active after having been kept
in v concentrated glycerine for 142 days (1) ; Flexner has shown it will
keep in 50 per cent, glycerine for over a year at a temperature of 2 to 4°
C. (H).
The virus has been proved by various observers to be little affected by low
temperatures ; it is destroyed by heating for half an hour to a temperature
of 50° to 55° C. Romer found that the virus contained in the spinal cord
of an infected monkey retained its virulence after having been dried in
vacuo for 28 days at room temperature and guarded from light. Similar
results were obtained by Flexner and Lewis and also by Landsteiner and
Levaditi. “ Kraus investigated the influence of carbolic acid on the virus.
He found that the filtered emulsion is more easily killed than the unfiltered;
this is due to the presence in the latter of coarser particles of the spinal cord,
which enclose the virus and prevent the carbolic from acting on it. Contact
with a *5 per cent, solution of carbolic acid lessened the virulence and in
some cases destroyed it. A 1 per cent, solution did not kill the virus in
one to three days, but it was efficacious in four to five days ” (1).
Flexner and Noguchi were successful in obtaining growths from infected
spinal cords kept in 50 per cent, glycerine for over a year at 2° to 4° C. on


Noguchi’s special medium. Fresh pieces of the brain or of the spinal
cord of patients dying of acute anterior poliomyelitis or of monkeys
suffering from the experimental form of the disease also yielded these
growths.
The cultures were incubated at 37° C., when an opalescence was mani-
fested at the end of five days. At the end of a fortnight, the growth fell
to the bottom of the culture medium by spontaneous precipitation. On
examination of the growth they found the organism to be a globoid
body occurring in pairs, chains, or masses. Its diameter varied from *ls
to *3 fi. It is difficult to stain. The best methods of staining were found
to be those of Gram and Giemsa. They succeeded in infecting monkeys by
intracerebral injection of the cultures, but only exceptional specimens were
found to possess sufficient pathogenicity to cause experimental poliomyelitis.
From pieces of the central nervous system of these cases a similar growth
could always be obtained on the culture medium (11).
Noguchi s culture medium was similar to that used by him for the growth
of spirochaetes. Essentially it consists of unheated, sterile ascitic fluid, to
which has been added a piece of sterile fresh tissue—a fragment of rabbit’s
kidney being most often used. It must be incubated anaerobically—the
medium being covered by a thick layer of sterile paraffin oil. To obtain
the first growth from infected nervous tissue, an anaerobic jar may have to
be used (12).
The usual method of the spread of infection would be for the virus to
lodge on the mucous membrane of the nasopharynx, the trachea, or the
alimentary tract, and from there travel by means of the nerves supplying
these tissues to the central nervous system and so produce the disease.
In experimental poliomyelitis it has been noted that, if some infected
material be injected into the sciatic nerve, the paralysis is always first noticed
in the leg of the same side. Romer records a case in which the sciatic nerve
was first ligatured, an injection of infected material made into the nerve
below the ligature, and then the nerve was cut above the ligature. No
poliomyelitis followed in this animal. Romer believes the lymph spaces in
the nerve bundles may act as the paths of infection (1).
When a massive dose is injected intravenously and paralysis follows,
Flexner considers the virus reaches the central nervous system by way of
the choroid plexus and the cerebro-spinal fluid (13).
The biting stable fly (Stomoxys calcitrans) was at one time supposed to
play some part in the spread of the disease. Rosenau found that out of
twelve monkeys in a cage exposed to the bites of flies previously infected,
six became infected with poliomyelitis, and of these three died. They had
typical lesions of poliomyelitis (14).
Anderson and Frost allowed stable flies to bite two monkeys inoculated
intracerebrally with the virus and three healthy monkeys for several days.
The three latter all developed poliomyelitis (15). From their account it would
seem as if the cages were kept close together, so that it is possible in these
cases that the infection spread by direct or indirect contact and not by the
bites of the stable flies. Similar experiments carried out by Anderson and
Frost at a later date all gave negative results (16).


It is now generally thought that the bites of the stable fly play little (if
any) part in the spread of the disease. It is commonly supposed that the
virus from the infected discharges of a case, or of an abortive case or of a
“ contact ” of poliomyelitis lodges directly on the mucous membrane of
the respiratory tract or the alimentary canal of a human being, and by
means of the nerves (or rather of the lymphatics contained in the nerves)
supplying that part, travels directly to the central nervous system and so
gives rise to the pathological changes causing infantile paralysis.
V. SPECIFIC ANTIBODIES.
(1) Serum Diagnosis.
Romer found that if the emulsion of an infected spinal cord of a strength
of 5 per cent., repeatedly passed through a filter-paper, be mixed with equal
portions of the serum of a monkey that had suffered from experimental
poliomyelitis, and 0-6 to 0-8 cc. of the mixture (after standing for one hour
at 37° C. and 23 hours in an ice-chest, or at room temperature) be injected
intracerebrally into a monkey, that animal does not contract the disease.
A control animal, in which normal serum is used instead of the paralyzed
monkey’s serum, mixed in the same proportions with the infected emulsion,
and injected as above, was found to develop the disease.
Therefore, the serum of a paralyzed animal contained a specific antibody
against the infective virus, and, mixed in the above proportion, was sufficiently
powerful to neutralize it completely. Flexner and Lewis and Leiner and
von Weisner obtained very similar results (1).
Netter and Levaditi further proved that the serum of a child recently
recovered from an “ abortive ” attack of the disease, also possessed the
power of rendering the virus innocuous, by means of a similar experiment
(17).
Anderson and Frost similarly showed that protective properties against
the virus of infantile paralysis were contained in the sera of —
(a) A person recovered from a typical case of infantile paralysis.
(b) A person who developed spastic paralysis, and was believed to
have suffered from the cerebral variety of the disease, and
(c) Six out of nine persons who were believed to have suffered from
the abortive variety of the disease (17).
(2) Active Immunization.
Flexner has made a series of experiments on monkeys to produce an
immune serum by injections of emulsions of the spinal cord of an infected
monkey, variously attenuated, but, so far, without any certain success, unless
the animal contracted the disease (18).
(3) Passive Immunization.
By transferring the blood of monkeys who have recently suffered from
poliomyelitis to normal ones, some degree of passive immunity has been
produced. But it is most uncertain, and is of brief duration, so this method
would be useless as a prophylactic during the time of an epidemic , (19).


(4) Serum Treatment.
“ the other hand, a measure of success has been achieved in the experi-
mental serum treatment of inoculated monkeys. For this purpose blood
serum, derived from either recovered and protected monkeys, or human
beings, has been employed. The serum is injected into the membrane about
the spinal cord, and the virus is inoculated into the brain. The injection of
serum must be repeated several times in order to be effective.
Use of this method has been made in a few instances in France, where
the blood serum derived from persons who had recovered from infantile
paralysis has been injected into the spinal membrane of persons who have
just become paralyzed. The results are said to be promising. Unfor-
tunately, the quantity of the human immune serum is very limited, and no
other animals than monkeys seem capable of yielding an immune serum,
and the monkey is not a practicable animal from which to obtain supplies ”
(19)

Sex Incidence.
More males are affected than females, though they are not greatly in the
majority.
Social Condition.
The disease does not appear to attack the children of the poorer classes
any more than those of any other class (1).
It has been noted by Wickman, in the Swedish epidemic of 1905, and by
other observers, however, that the disease generally attacks people living in
country districts a great deal more severely, and in a far larger proportion,
than those living in large cities.
This may be due to some special agent, such as an insect found more
commonly in country life. The more likely reason appears to be that
children living in the country are more susceptible to the disease, those
living in large cities having mostly acquired some immunity to it (Frost) (17).
Latitude.
It has been pointed out that the most extensive and severe outbreaks
have occurred in the colder latitudes both of Europe (i.e., Scandinavia)
and of North America (17).
Season.
Outbreaks of infantile paralysis may occur at any period of the
year; but the greatest incidence is in the late summer and early autumn.
In some cases the outbreak, though starting in the late summer, may not
reach its maximum till the late autumn or early winter. Usually, however,
the advent of cold weather marks the end of the epidemic.


Frost has pointed out that “ on the Pacific coast of the United States,
where the difference between summer and winter is more of rainfall than of
temperature,” the greatest incidence of poliomyelitis is usually found during
the dry season. The arrival of the wet season appears usually to terminate
the epidemic (17).
Methods of Spread.
It is now generally recognised that the disease is spread by the
infected virus from the buccal, nasopharyngeal, or alimentary secretions
lodging on the mucous membrane of a healthy person, and from there
travelling to the central nervous system, by means of the peripheral
nerves (or rather, the lymphatics contained within the bundles of the nerves)
supplying that part (1).
This infective virus may come from a person suffering from the disease —
either from a case having definite symptoms, or from an abortive case ; from
a person convalescent from the disease ; or from a healthy “contact.” The
healthy “contact” is now considered to be the most important factor in
the spread of infection.
Very interesting figures are given by Frost of cases investigated by him
during the years 1910, 1911, and 1912, in various outbreaks that occurred
in the United States :
“ The following is a summary of the number and proportion of investi-
gated cases of paralytic poliomyelitis, giving histories of contact with previous
definite suspected cases, including the cases in which satisfactory histories
were obtained :
1. History of Direct Contact — No. %
(u) With previously paralyzed case of poliomyelitis 31 .. 6*84
( b) With previous abortive case of poliomyelitis 7 .. 1 ‘54
(c) With previous suspected case of poliomyelitis 16 .. 3 *53
(d) Contact probable ; not definitely established 10 .. 2 *2O
2. History of Indirect Contact (through third Person) —

bable, direct or indirect with previous paralyzed,

Total, giving no history of any contact with any
previous case .. .. .. .. 348 .. 76 ‘B3 ”
So that a history of contact was established in less than a quarter of all
cases in which a satisfactory history was obtained (17).
In all outbreaks of poliomyelitis it is remarkable how seldom a second case
occurs in a household where one member has been attacked by this disease.
Frost gives the following figures :

So that the percentage of definite secondary paralyzed cases was 0'67 per

of all exposed in the same dwelling to infection (17).
The number of cases occurring in the same family has been investigated
in New York during the present epidemic.

Flies and possibly dust may act as passive carriers of the disease, but it
is noteworthy that infantile paralysis is usually not more prevalent in the
poorer and denser parts of a city (where it would be expected that these
factors would cause a relative increase in the incidence of the infection)
than in other places. It is probable that neither flies nor dust play much
part in the spread of the disease.
In view of the positive results obtained by Rosenau and by Anderson
and Frost, it is possible that the bites of the stable fly may play a minor
role in the spread of the disease, but the later negative results obtained by
the latter observers do not support this theory. The fact that the disease
can only be reproduced in monkeys by intravenous injection when massive
doses are given is also much against it. Further, Flexner has recently pointed
out that only in monkeys (and never in human beings) has the virus been
recovered from the blood (19).
It is generally now accepted that neither domestic drinking water nor
milk plays any part in the spread of the disease. If either did it would be
expected that the outbreaks of the disease would be far more explosive than
they usually are. When epidemics are investigated it is almost always
found that no particular dairy and no particular water supply is
incriminated by reason of the consumers comprising a larger percentage of
cases than the rest of the population.
Occasionally, however, it is found that several of the cases have a common
milk supply. This was the case in West Kirby (England) in the autumn


of 1914 when out of four definitely paralyzed cases scattered over the town,
three had been getting milk from the same dairyman. The population of
West Kirby was then 14,000. It is a seaside watering town (20).
Wickman was the first observer to emphasize that infantile paralysis is
an infectious disease during the extensive epidemic that occurred in Sweden
in 1905. The disease mostly spread in country districts and sometimes
the history of contagion was very definite.
As an instance :
Wickman’s “ observations in the little parish of Traestena have become
specially celebrated, because they form a classical example of his theory
that the disease is infectious. Out of 500 inhabitants living in 102 houses,
mostly isolated from one another, 49 persons (10 per cent.) became ill,
26 of these (5 per cent.) had definite paralysis. The source of infection
in most cases was the school. The disease was carried to the different houses
by the children, some of whom became ill themselves, while others remained
well. Wickman, therefore, arrived at the important conclusion that the
disease could spread by means of ‘carriers,’ as in the case of many other
infectious diseases. Where it was not possible to trace the infection directly
to the school, it could be proved that visits had taken place to houses which
had already been infected from the school. The infection spread from this
parish in a radial manner, in the same way as was observed in larger affected
areas ” (1).
Frost records a similar small epidemic. In a rural district in Hancock
County, lowa, U.S.A., during April and May, 1910, an outbreak occurred
amongst the families whose children attended a small country school. There
were twelve families, numbering 70 persons, of whom 23 attended the school.
In all, five cases of definite infantile paralysis occurred (7 per cent, of the
total population), five cases of definite abortive cases, and thirteen suspected
abortive cases.
He gives the following history of contact with previous cases :
A. —Total Paralyzed Cases , 5.
(a) Direct contact with previous paralyzed case .. .. 3
(b) Direct contact with previous abortive case .. .. 1
(c) Indirect contact with previous paralyzed case .. .. 1
B. —Total Abortive Cases, 5.

the community) .. .. .. .. .. 1
C. —Suspected Cases, 13.
(a) Direct contact with previous paralyzed case .. .. 9
(b) Indirect contact with previous paralyzed case (and also
direct contact with previous abortive case) .. .. 4
(17).
It is a great deal easier, as Frost points out, to get histories of contact
in small rural communities than in large cities.
C. 1181—3


Usually in a large city it is noted that the majority of cases first affect
one area and then another. When the disease spreads into country districts,
the cases can often be traced along railways and roads. These facts all
point to the human carrier as the principal factor in the spread of infection.
As experimental poliomyelitis can be produced only in monkeys (Romer)
it would seem as though the paralysis noted as occurring sometimes in ordi-
nary domestic animals during epidemics is only a coincidence and is no
cause in the spread of the disease. This view is shared by Flexner (19).
Factors favouring the Occurrence of Epidemics.
It is difficult to say whether an epidemic arises from a fresh infection
brought into the country concerned or whether it arises from sporadic cases
(perhaps unrecognised) that have already been occurring there for years
past. For instance, Flexner considered that the New York epidemic of
1907 originated as a result of infection brought from Scandinavia. Romer
considered it more probable that it arose from the sporadic cases that had
occurred in the United States for many years previously (1).
It would appear probable that, as sporadic cases are always occurring
in most countries, epidemics arise when there are a large number of children
present who are susceptible to the disease. Flexner considers the variation
in the virulence of the virus as a further factor of great importance in the
outbreak and spread of epidemics. “ The virus is subject to fluctuations
of intensity which can be best illustrated by an example. The virus as
ordinarily present in human beings, even during severe epidemics, has low
infective power for monkeys. But by passing it from monkey to monkey,
it tends to acquire after a variable number of such passages, an extraordinary
activity. However, occasional samples of the human virus refuse to be thus
intensified. But once rendered highly potent, the virus may be passed
from monkey to monkey through a long but not indefinite series. Finally,
in some samples of the virus at least, a reverse change takes place—the virus
begins to lose its virulence until it returns to the original or even to a
diminished degree of infective power. In this respect the behaviour of the
virus corresponds to the onset, rise and fall in the number and severity
of cases as observed in the course of epidemics of infantile paralysis and
other epidemic diseases. Hence either a new active specimen of the disease
may be introduced from without, which, after a certain series of passages
from person to person, acquires a high potency, or a specimen of virus already
present and left over from a previous epidemic after a resting period and
similar passages again becomes active, and reaches an infective power which
equals or even exceeds that originally possessed ” (19).
Apparently in most epidemics the advent of cold weather in the late
autumn or early winter has a deteriorating effect'bn the virus.
VII.—DISTRIBUTION OF THE DISEASE.
Underwood, who lived in the middle of the eighteenth century, is generally
considered to be the first physician to have recorded the existence of this
disease, but Romer does not consider his description accurate. Jorg (1816)
gave a reliable account of the disease, but It was not till 1840 that v. Heine
recognised the disease as a definite clinical entity. His description of the


spinal variety of the disease is considered by Romer to be masterly. From
this date onwards the disease was definitely recognised. But the cases
recorded were only sporadic (1).
Hirsch does not record any epidemics of the disease (21).
Batten states he has heard of an epidemic in the United States as far
back as 1841 —recorded by Colmer—but he is unable to trace any references
regarding it (4).
Excluding this doubtful outbreak, the first recorded was a small
epidemic in Sweden in the year 1881. Scattered cases have been recorded
in Italy in 1883, and in France, Norway, and Germany in 1886. Medin
described an outbreak in Stockholm in 1887 in which 44 cases were
observed (4).
Lovett finds that during the “ eighties ” nine outbreaks have been noted
in the State of Massachusetts (United States). The total number of cases
was 116 (22).
During the “ nineties ” small scattered outbreaks occurred in Sweden,
Norway, Germany, Austria, Italy, and England.
The most important epidemics in Europe occurred (1) in Stockholm
(which was investigated by Wickman) in 1899, when 54 cases with four
deaths were recorded ; and (2) in Vienna, where 42 cases were noted (4).
In the United States 27 small outbreaks occurred during this time in
Massachusetts; 496 cases were reported in all. The largest outbreak
was recorded in 1894, with 132 cases. This outbreak was investigated by
Caverly and McPhail (22).
The Twentieth Century.
During the present century many outbreaks have occurred, but the
severest recorded have been reported in Scandinavia and in the United States
of America. It has been stated that the disease is now met with on every
continent, and has probably an almost universal distribution (2).
Europe.
Outbreaks have been reported amongst almost all the Continental nations
during this century (i.e. Sweden, Norway, France, Russia, Italy, Holland,
Switzerland, Spain, Germany, and Austria).
In 1905 an extensive outbreak in Sweden was carefully investigated by
Wickman. The cases occurred mainly in rural districts, and altogether
1,031 cases, with 145 deaths, were recorded (4). At the same time some 1,000
cases occurred in Norway (1). As a result of his investigations during this
Swedish epidemic, Wickman strongly urged the infectivity of poliomyelitis,
and emphasized the importance of “ healthy carriers ” as a mode of spread.
In 1911 another severe epidemic raged in Sweden (again chiefly in rural
districts). Some 3,520 cases occurred (25), (26).
The most important outbreaks recorded, apart from those in Scandi-
navia, were in Germany in 1909, when some 900 cases developed in West-
phalia and Rhineland (1) ; and in Austria in 1908, when Zappert investigated
266 cases, with fourteen deaths in Vienna (4) ; and again in 1909, when some
600 cases were found in Upper Austria (1).
32


Since that date many cases have been reported, but Romer considers
it noteworthy that Southern Europe appears to be very little affected by the
disease (1).
In Great Britain no extensive outbreak has occurred. From the records
of several hospitals, Batten discovered that 45 cases of infantile paralysis
were amongst the patients of these institutions during 1904.
One of the most important epidemics recorded in England was that
investigated by Reece in Devonshire and Cornwall in the summer of 1911.
It mainly affected the rural districts; when more densely populated communi-
ties, such as New Quay, Falmouth, and Barnstaple were attacked, the disease
did not spread as readily. It is interesting to note this was an exceptionally
dry and warm summer. Altogether there were some 224 cases. The death
rate was over 20 per cent. (23).

America.
The first outbreak recorded in the United States during the present century
was investigated by Woods in San Francisco in 1901 (4).
The first very extensive epidemic occurred in New York in 1907, when
Starr recorded some 2,000 cases there, with a death rate of 7 per cent.
In the following year, some 1,200 cases occurred in New York (4).
Since then, extensive epidemics (mainly affecting rural districts) have
occurred in different parts all over the United States. Amongst others,
the Massachusetts outbreaks of 1907, 1908, and 1909 may be mentioned;
as also those occurring in Minnesota and Nebraska in 1909 (4); in lowa
in 1910, in Ohio in 1911, in Buffalo (New York) in 1912 (17), in Northern
California in 1913 (9) and in Vermont in 1914 (27).

In the year 1916 the most extensive epidemic ever recorded raged in
New York. Between 4th June and 25th September approximately
8,934 cases, with 2,255 deaths, were recorded. The mortality rate was
approximately 25 per cent. (29).

Probably a part of the apparent enormous increase of the number of
cases reported annually is due to improved methods of diagnosis.
In Alaska , a few cases of infantile paralysis were noted in the summers
of 1908, 1910, and 1912 (28).
No statistics previous to the year 1916 indicating the prevalence of the
disease in Canada have been noted, but Forbes, in 1911, described the surgical
treatment practised by himself at various hospitals in Montreal, so that it
is evident that poliomyelitis was well known there (30). Following the
recent epidemic in New York, sporadic cases have been reported from
all parts of the country, with several deaths. “An outbreak recently
in Montreal made it necessary to close some of the schools. In the
Province of Ontario, during the month of September, 76 cases and seven
deaths were reported, and nineteen cases during the first nineteen days of
October ” (48).
In Ecuador, three fatal cases were recorded during the year 1912, and
it was then stated to be increasing there. No particulars have been
observed showing the presence of the disease in any other part of South
America (31).
Africa.
Batten records the presence of poliomyelitis in Pietermaritzburg, South
Africa, in 1902 (4).
Australasia.
(1) Australia. —Cleland and Ferguson have analyzed the history of the
disease in Australia (32). They consider that it is most probable that sporadic
cases occurred for some considerable time before any outbreaks of the disease
were recorded, but state that no trace of these cases can be found in current
medical literature.


The first sporadic cases mentioned were in the year 1887 ; one case (of
Landry’s disease, presumably poliomyelitis) was described by Hood as
occurring on the Clarence River, New South Wales ; and one case, the type
not specified, was recorded by Altmann as occurring at Port Lincoln, in South
Australia. In 1890 three sporadic cases (all of the type of Landry’s disease,
and all fatal) were recorded in New South Wales. In 1893 Stokes recorded
three cases occurring in one family at Port Macquarie, New South Wales.
The first case was the spinal variety of the disease, and the others the variety
known as Landry’s disease (both fatal).
The first small outbreak recorded in Australia occurred at Port
Lincoln, South Australia, in March and April, 1895 (Altmann). Fourteen
cases (all of the classical spinal type) were noted. There were no
deaths.
The second outbreak of the disease started in Sydney in the summer of
1903-1904, and from there spread over the greater part of New South Wales
and Queensland. Litchfield recorded 35 cases in Sydney between November,
1903, and March, 1904 —-most of which occurred in December and January.
It is of interest to mention that the summer was wetter and cooler than
usual. During December, 1903, and January, 1904, Wade noted 34 cases
in Sydney. These cases were of the classical spinal type, and the great
majority of the patients were under two and a half years of age. Six cases
were recorded by Blackall as occurring in Queanbeyan early in the year ;
one (Landry’s paralysis) fatal, was noted by Page at Grafton, and eight cases
were noted at Young by MacPherson (one fatal).
Falkiner stated that cases occurred in two other country districts of New
South Wales—Armidale and Glen Innes —and from there spread to Too-
woomba, in Queensland, in April, 1904. Burnett Ham, then Commissioner
of Public Health for Queensland, noted that 104 cases, with four deaths,
occurred in Queensland in that year. The outbreak was widely scattered —
cases being reported in Toowoomba, Ipswich, Brisbane, Maryborough, and
Townsville. The epidemic ended in February, 1905, most of the cases reported
occurring in October. One fatal case of Landry’s disease was noted in
Brisbane by Byrne.
In the autumn of 1908 H. D. Stephens described an outbreak in Victoria.
One hundred and eight cases, with six deaths, were recorded. Most came
from the more densely-populated suburbs. The summer was an exceptionally
dry and warm one. The outbreak began in April, and ended in June. One
case resembled Landry’s paralysis. A small outbreak occurred about the
same time at Bendigo.
In 1909 Gill mentions the occurrence of twelve cases in Sydney, in March.
Towards the end of that year twenty cases occurred on the Richmond and
Tweed Rivers, New South Wales.
In March, 1909, in his annual report to the Department of Public Health,
1908-1909, Elkington mentions 41 cases, with five deaths, occurring in various
country districts of Tasmania. Two of these cases were regarded as doubtful.
In the report for the year 1911-1912 Purdy referred to the presence of
at least twelve cases in the Upper Huon district of Tasmania, in January,
1912.


Cleland and Ferguson record the number of cases of infantile paralyses
admitted to the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children, Camperdown
Sydney, for the years 1891-1913 :

These figures give a total of 206 cases, with but one death (32). It is
remarkable that no cases were admitted to the hospital in the year 1904,
when there was an undoubted outbreak of the disease. The increase
in the number of cases admitted during the last five years given is also
noteworthy.
During the year 1914, 79 cases (of which 64 occurred in Sydney), with one
death, were notified in New South Wales (33).
Thomson records an outbreak that occurred in Brisbane in 1914. A few
sporadic cases were recorded in July and September, but it was not till the
beginning of October that the disease became epidemic. The outbreak
ended in December. In all, 207 cases, with 29 deaths, occurred in Brisbane.
The cases started in some of the central portions of the city ; then spread to
the outlying suburbs, and finally to towns some distance away, such as
Sandgate and Ipswich, which are directly connected to Brisbane by railway.
Thus, this outbreak ran the typical course of epidemics of infantile
paralysis (34).
It is of interest to note that this epidemic and that of 1904-1905, in
Queensland, occurred during the dry season. The climate of Queensland
is better divided into wet and dry seasons than into the spring, summer,
autumn, and winter of temperate regions. It is, therefore, comparable to
that of the Pacific coast of the United States, where Frost has noted that
epidemics of this disease occur most often during the dry season. (See
page 63.)


Outside the metropolitan area 125 cases were reported for the year —
Ist July, 1914-30th June, 1915 (35).
During the preceding year six cases were notified in Queensland, of which
three occurred in Brisbane (36), whilst for the twelve months before that
16 cases were reported in Brisbane, and 22 throughout the rest of the
State —a total of 38 (37).
(2) New Zealand. —Some 49 cases of poliomyelitis occurred at Taranaki,
North Island, early in 1914 (38).
An outbreak developed in New Zealand in 1916. Three sporadic cases
were first reported in Auckland, in December, 1915. The disease spread
over both the North and the South Islands. The epidemic was at its height
during February, March, and April. By the end of June it had practically
died out. In all, 960 cases were recorded, of which 865 occurred in the
North Island, and 95 in the South Island.

It should be mentioned that the Health District of Wellington includes-
the provinces of Marlborough and Nelson in the South Island (44).
The epidemic began in the city of Auckland, and, at first, most cases
occurred there. Later on, very few cases were reported in the city or the
suburbs, and the majority of the cases were found in country districts. The
death rate was about 10 per cent, of those affected (39).
VIII. PREVENTION OF THE SPREAD OF THE DISEASE.
Since it is generally considered that the disease is spread mainly by means
of the “ healthy carrier,” or by abortive cases, it is obvious that it is an
exceedingly difficult matter to prevent the spread of an epidemic.
4 The only known method of ascertaining which contacts contain the virus
in their secretions is by intra-cerebral inoculations of monkeys. Its practical
value is discounted by the difficulty of obtaining these animals, and by the
length of the period of incubation, which may last as long as 33 days.
Besides, it has already been noticed that monkeys do not acquire polio-
myelitis on injection of infected human material in a large proportion of cases.
Compulsory notification of all cases. of infantile paralysis is essential in
combating an epidemic. In addition, the patient must be kept in strict
quarantine for a certain period, with disinfection of all discharges (both
naso-pharyngeal and intestinal), and also of all articles used by the patient.


during the period of infectivity, and of all contents in the occupied room on
the raising of the quarantine. Further, all “ contacts ” should also be
quarantined or released under surveillance, under special conditions, to
prevent the spread of infection, for a definite period.
During the Vermont (U.S.A.) epidemic of 1914 the following preventive
measures were adopted. The patient was strictly quarantined for four weeks,
with terminal disinfection. Contacts were quarantined for two weeks after
the last known exposure to infection. Further, all schools, Sunday schools,
and moving picture shows (as places where children were likely to meet
together) were closed during the epidemic (27).
In spite of these drastic measures the outbreak continued to spread until
it was checked by the advent of cool weather. It thus followed the usual
course noted in most epidemics (40).
The following measures were adopted by the Health Department in
dealing with the extensive epidemic that occurred in New York in the summer
and autumn of 1916 :
At the beginning, when about fourteen cases had been reported, it became
evident that a focus of the disease existed. The area of the focus was mapped
out, and submitted to inspection, the inspectors being medical men. Every
case of slight illness in the focus was investigated, and it was found that
about three times as many cases of poliomyelitis existed as had been reported.
The medical inspectors filled in full particulars of each case on a card, a
specimen of which is given hereunder :

Result


In combating the epidemic, notification of all indefinite slight illnesses
was encouraged.
In the administrative control of the epidemic two types of medical men
were employed, in addition to the permanent staff of the Health Department.
Hirst, medical inspectors, who went and examined all cases of reported
illness. About one hundred such inspectors were employed in the height
of the epidemic. If these inspectors were perfectly satisfied as to the nature
of the case it was treated in accordance with their view. If they were not
satisfied the second type of medical man was called in—the diagnostician.
The diagnostician visited the patient, examined the case over again, and
usually proceeded forthwith to take a sample of cerebro-spinal fluid, unless
it was obviously unnecessary. The cerebro-spinal fluid was sent direct to
the laboratory for examination. About 25 diagnosticians were employed
during the height of the epidemic. The material was examined at the
laboratory by special workers engaged in this work almost exclusively.
During the epidemic a constant press campaign was conducted. The
object of the press campaign was educational, in reference to preventive
measures which might be adopted by the general public, and a list of the
new cases notified, with the addresses of same, was published each day in
fche newspapers. A small article appeared every day in the newspapers
leafing with interesting and important aspects of the disease.
Conferences were held with general practitioners, regarding means of
early diagnosis. Lectures were given to school teachers.
A vigorous campaign was started against flies. All householders were
compelled to keep their refuse in proper receptacles, provided with fids.
Prosecutions, whenever necessary, were freely laid against defaulters (45).
The following minimum requirements for the control of the disease were
indorsed by the Conference of State and Territorial Health Authorities with
the United States Public Health Service at Washington, on 18th August,
1916 :—•
“1. Reports. —Every physician, attendant, parent, householder, or other person
having knowledge of a known or suspected case of acute anterior poliomyelitis (infantile
paralysis) must immediately report the same to the local health authorities.
2. Placarding. —Whenever a case of acute anterior poliomyelitis is reported to the
local health authorities, they shall affix in a conspicuous place at each outside entrance
of the building, house or flat, as the case may be, a warning card.
Defacement of such placards or their removal by any other than the local health
authorities or the duly authorized representative of the State Board of Health is strictly
prohibited.
3. Quarantine of Patient. —All cases of acute poliomyelitis must be quarantined for
at least six weeks. Quarantine must not be raised, however, until the premises have
been thoroughly disinfected by or under the supervision of the health officer. All persons
continuing to reside on the infected premises shall be confined to the infected premises
until quarantine has been raised, except as hereniafter provided.
No one but the necessary attendant, the physician, the health officer and repre-
sentatives of the State Board of Health may be permitted to enter or leave the infected
premises. Upon leaving they must take all precautions necessary to prevent the spread
of the disease. The nursing attendant may leave the premises only on permission granted
by the local health officer.
4. Quarantine of Exposures. —Members of the family over sixteen years of age may
be removed from the infected premises upon permission granted by the local health
officer, after thorough disinfection of person and clothing.
Children of the family may be removed from the infected premises upon permission
of the local health officer, after thorough disinfection of person and clothing. Such
children may be removed only to premises upon which none but adults reside, and must


be confined to the premises (in the house) for two weeks from date of removal, during
which period they must be kept under close observation by the local health authorities,
and no child shall be permitted to visit or otherwise come in contact with them during
this period. They must not return to the infected premises or come in contact in any
way with the patient or attendant until quarantine has been terminated.
All children who continue to reside on the infected premises must be held under
close observation for at least two weeks following termination of the last case on the
premises.
5. Exclusion from the Schools, &c. —All children who continue to reside on the infected
premises must be excluded from the schools and other public gatherings for at least two
weeks following date of raising of quarantine.
All children who have been exposed to the disease and who have been removed from
the infected premises, in accordance with th e provisions o f Rule 4, must be excluded
from the schools and from all public gatherings for at least two weeks from date of last
exposure.
The patient must be excluded from the schools and all public gatherings for at least
two weeks after quarantine is raised.
School teachers and other persons employed in or about a school building who have
been exposed to the disease must be excluded from the school building and grounds for a
period of two weeks following date of last exposure, and until persons and clothing have
been thoroughly disinfected.
Whenever the schools are closed on account of an outbreak of acute poliomyelitis,
children under sixteen years of age shall be excluded from Sunday schools, churches,
picture shows, and all other public gatherings, and shall be confined to their own
premises.
6. Precautions. —No person, except the necessary attendant, the physician, and
the health officer may be permitted to come into contact with the patient. Such persons
must not handle or prepare food for others, and their intercourse with the other members
of their household must be as restricted as possible.
The infected premises, especially the sick room, shall be thoroughly screened against
flies, and any such insects as may enter the sick room shall be exterminated therein.
All toilets used by the patient or attendants and those in which discharges from the
patient are deposited must be thoroughly screened against flies and freely treated with
an approved disinfectant.
7. Removals. —No person affected with acute anterior poliomyelitis shall be removed
from the premises upon which he is found unless consent to such removal be first obtained
from the local health authorities of the State Board of Health, and then only after strict
compliance with the provisions of these rules. Under no circumstances shall permission
be granted for the removal of any patient or article from the infected premises to any
premises upon which milk or other foodstuffs are produced, sold, or handled.
No person affected with acute anterior poliomyelitis shall be removed from any
city, village, township, or county in which he is found unless consent to such removal
be first obtained from the State Board of Health.
8. Sale of Milk and other Foodstuffs from Infected Premises Prohibited. —Whenever a
case of acute poliomyelitis shall occur on any premises where milk or other foodstuffs
are either produced, handled, or sold, the sale, exchange, or distribution on such premises
in any manner whatsoever, or the removal from the infected premises of milk, cream,
any milk products or other foodstuffs until the case has been terminated by removal,
recovery, or death, and the premises and contents and all utensils have been thoroughly
disinfected under the supervision of the local health authorities, is prohibited :
Provided, that in the event of acute anterior poliomyelitis occurring on a dairy farm
the live stock, the properly sterilized milk utensils and delivery outfit, may be removed
to some non-infected premises, and the milking done and milk cared for and sold from
such other premises by persons other than those of the household of the person so affected,
upon obtaining permission to do so from the local health authorities or the State Board
of Health.
Whenever a case of acute anterior poliomyelitis shall occur on premises connected
with any store, such store shall be quarantined until the case has been terminated by
removal, recovery, or death, and the premises are thoroughly disinfected :
Provided, however, that if the premises are so constructed that the part in which
the case exists can be and is effectively sealed, under the supervision of the local health
authorities, from the store : And provided further, that the employees and all other
persons connected with the store do not enter the part of the premises where the case
exists and do not come in contact with the patient, his attendant, or any article what-
soever from the quarantined premises, the store attached to the quarantined premises
meed not be closed.


9. Delivering of Milk, Groceries, and other Necessities. —Milk, foodstuffs, and other
necessities may be delivered at the quarantined premises, but there must be no contact
between the patient or attendant and the delivery agent. The householder must provide
a sterilized container (a freshly-sealed bottle or pail) to receive the milk, and the delivery
agent must not handle this bottle or pail in making the delivery.
No milk bottle, basket, or other article whatsoever may be taken out of or away
from the infected premises during the period of quarantine. Before milk bottles are
removed from the premises after quarantine is raised, they must be sterilized under the
direction of the local health authorities. Mail which has been handled by the patient
or attendant must not be taken from the premises.
10. Disinfection. —All articles taken from the sick room must be disinfected upon
removal. Exposure in the open air of carpets, rugs, curtains, bedding, and similar articles
from the infected premises for the purpose of airing, shaking, beating, or sunning is
strictly prohibited, unless, in the opinion of the local health authorities, such may be done
without danger of the spread of the disease.
Books, toys, and other similar articles used to amuse the patients are best disposed
of by burning. Under no circumstances should borrowed toys or books be returned.
Library and school books should not be returned; they must be burned.
Bed and body linen which has been in contact with the patient, and handkerchiefs
or cloths which have been used to receive discharges from the patient, must be immersed
in an approved disinfectant before removal from the sick room, and after removal should
be boiled.
All discharges from the patient must be thoroughly disinfected before removal from
the sick room.
No article of clothing or other article may be removed from the infected premises
to a laundry or other place for washing unless previously disinfected by immersion in an
approved disinfectant and the approval of the local health authorities has been obtained.
House animals, such as cats, dogs, or any other household pets, and all other animals
or fowls must be strictly excluded from the infected building, house, or flat, as the case
may be, during the entire period of quarantine. Any such animals which have been in
contact with the patient must be subjected to a thorough disinfecting bath before removal
from the infected building, house, or flat, and must not be permitted to re-enter the
same. Such animals must be confined in an outbuilding. Dogs and cats running at
large should be destroyed.
Before quarantine is raised, the infected premises and all articles of furniture and
clothing therein must be thoroughly disinfected by or under the supervision of the local
health authorities in a manner approved by the State Board of Health.” (41)
Additional measures recommended were —
(1) Whenever possible the patient should be removed from his (or
her) home to a hospital.
(2) In the case of death from poliomyelitis, the funeral should be
strictly private.
(3) Whenever the disease is unusually prevalent, meetings of children
in public places should be prohibited.
(4) Whenever the disease is unusually prevalent, “ schools should
not be opened without thorough medical inspection by a health
authority. When schools are opened, beginning should be
made with high schools, and proceeding to lower age groups
no more rapidly than complete medical examinations can be
made.”
(5) The use of the common drinking cup should be prohibited ; a
special campaign against flies should be adopted ; and parents
should be warned that the disease is infectious, and that it
is especially important to keep their children’s mouths and
noses clean (42).
The same Committee also considered the necessary methods for pre-
vention of the spread of poliomyelitis from one State to another. It con-
sidered that the first step proper to be taken by a State health authority
believing its territory to be in danger of an invasion of poliomyelitis from


another State or part of a State, is to call the attention of the United States
Public Health Service to the situation believed to be dangerous, and to request
the United States Public Health Service to take whatever steps are necessary
to prevent the inter-State spread of the disease.
The Committee disapproved of quarantine by one State against another
State or quarantine by one community against another community in the
same State. It considered that the necessary steps ordinarily to be taken
by the United States Public Health Service in such a contingency to be—
“ (1) Investigation of the infected area.
(2) Notification concerning the removal of persons 16 years of age
or under from an infected area to a named point of destination
in another State, said notification to be addressed in every case
to the State health authority of the State of destination.
(3) The forms of notification and of health certification and of
permits to travel should include the following information
and specifications, with such additional information and
specifications as the United States Public Health Service
deems necessary—
Identification of each traveller, the exact location of present
or usual residence, and record of premises as to freedom from
poliomyelitis during the preceding three months ; or as to
latest date of infection if less than three months ; or as to
renovation or cleansing of premises after infection.
(4) Permits to travel shall be void unless the journey shall
begin within 24 hours after issue of the permit.
(5) Single permits shall not be issued for several persons, except
for family or household groups coming from the same domicile.
(6) The collection of fees, by health officials, from applicants for
permits, whether resident or non-resident, should not be per-
mitted.
(7) The certificates of private physicians will not alone be a sufficient
basis for the issue of a permit to travel. Permits for inter-
state travel will be based on medical inspection.
(8) Permits for inter-State travel should be signed by an officer
of the United States Public Health Service, or by the State
health officer, or by an officer authorized by the State health
authority ” (42).
The following is a copy of a card issued by the California State Board of
Health for the use of passengers travelling from an infected State into
