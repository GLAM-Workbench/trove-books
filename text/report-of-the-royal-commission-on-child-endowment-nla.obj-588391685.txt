COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.
REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONERS.
To His Excellency the Right Honorable John Lawrence, Baron Stonehaven, Knight
Grand Cross of the Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George,
Companion of the Distinguished Service Order , Governor-General and Commander-
in-Chief in and over the Commonwealth of Australia.
May it please Your Excellency : ■ .
We, the Commissioners appointed by the Royal Letters Patent (the Terms of which
appear on page iii) have the honour to report as follows .
As soon as possible after our appointment, we assembled in Melbourne to make necessary
arrangements for the conduct of our inquiry.
The matters referred to us for inquiry and report involved among other things
an examination of existing legislation and administration relating to Child Endowment, Wage
Fixation. Maternity and Child Welfare Services, and Charity Organizations, &c., throughout
Australia. In order to ascertain the nature and extent of these activities, and also in order
to allow interested bodies to place their views before the Commission, it was found necessary
to take evidence in all the States of the Commonwealth.
Prior to the visit of the Commission to each State full publicity was given by advertisement
in the principal newspapers. Formal invitations were extended to all interested public bodies
or persons, to place their views before the Commission.
Witnesses who appeared and gave evidence before the Commission included official
representatives of Commonwealth and State Government Departments, members of Professional
Staffs attached to the Departments of Economics and Commerce at various Universities, members
of the medical profession connected with Maternity and Child Welfare activities, representatives
of a number of large commercial undertakings (including banks), also of organized bodies, chiefly
organizations of emplovers and of workers, women s leagues and associations, charitable and
philanthropic bodies, nursing societies, kindergarten unions, baby health centres, &c.
The Commission is indebted to witnesses for much carefully prepared and valuable evidence.
The places visited and the number of witnesses examined were as follows :
Sydney .. • • • • .. 75
Melbourne .. .. •. .. 51
Brisbane .. • • • • .. 17
Adelaide .. •. 24

Discussions of the subject, together with opinions and recommendations of the Members
of the Commission are embodied in two separate reports. The first of these (the majority report)
is signed by the Chairman and Commissioners Evans and Mills. The second (the minority report)
is signed by Commissioners Mrs. Muscio and J. Curtin.
We wish to place on record our appreciation of the conscientious services rendered by our
Secretary, Mr. T. F. Lyons.

MAJORITY REPORT.
The Chairman and Commissioners Evans and Mills.
PREFACE.
The investigation of the question of Child Endowment is attended with peculiar difficulties.
Announced as anew evangel, with power to “ banish real poverty from every employee’s home ”
(The Next Step, p. 45) it created around itself an atmosphere of warm emotion.
For a large number of people, including some text writers, and many witnesses before this
Commission, Child Endowment ceased to be a socio-economic problem, to be dispassionately
studied, and became a passionately-voiced dogma, any criticism of which renders one “ suspect ”
as lacking the capacity to recognize, and the will to grant, justice.
Beneath the claim, seldom avowed, there was in many instances a clearly perceptible
hope that the appealing suggestion of child happiness would make Child Endowment an easy
means of bringing about a “ vertical ” re-distribution of wealth.
To understand the question, sympathy is essential.
To surrender to the sway of a sympathy which usurps the place of patient thought and
careful tracing of causes and effects, is to defeat the very purpose which sympathy hopes to
achieve.
The lure of the short-cut, of the generous-sounding formula, made deceptively simple by
the omission of vital factors, is strong.
But, if the cause of a firmly-based social justice is to be served, that lure must be resisted.
INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT.
This brief statement is placed at the threshold of our report in order to answer in advance
the first question likely to arise in the minds of readers : —Do the writers of this Report recommend
child endowment or not ? While the statement answers that first question in the negative, it
leaves untouched many important points connected with the subject, which we hope will be
elucidated by a perusal of the succeeding pages.
The scheme contemplated in the Terms of Reference is one in which the necessary funds
would be provided from public revenue, or from industry, or from both sources. The assumption
seems to be (and this was the point of view of numerous witnesses) that this provision of funds
should be wholly an addition to’tlie sums now paid as wages.
In our opinion, such a scheme should not be adopted. Some of the reasons for that
conclusion are that :
(1) The claim that child endowment in this form is necessary on the ground that
wages are insufficient, has not, we think, been established.
(2) The additional taxation necessary to finance from public revenue a scheme for full
maintenance of dependent children as claimed, would cause disastrous reactions.
(3) If “ industry ” were directly levied upon to provide the funds, or an important
proportion of the funds, the result would be not less injurious. An immediate
effect would be an increase in the cost of living, partially defeating the object
of the levy. Also there would be great danger of adding to unemployment,
and so increasing rather than diminishing the total of distress in the community.
(4) The basic wage contains elements of child endowment much more than sufficient,
if directly applied, to provide for all existing dependent children. If the basic
wage be not reduced by the elimination of those elements, and if public funds
be applied to provide a general scheme of child endowment, the result, in our
opinion, would be a marked flush of extravagant spending and a sharp rise
in the cost of living, shortly followed by a check in prosperity, by a more or
less severe collapse in values, and by serious unemployment.
(5) By removing from parents all financial responsibility for their children, parental
responsibility would be weakened, incentive to effort reduced, and the sense
of unity of interest between parents lessened.


(6) Any available public money could be more beneficially used than m providing
child endowment. So far as the residual cases in the community which need
some assistance are concerned, we are satisfied that the expenditure of sums
much less than those required, even for a small measure of child endowment,
would, if applied to the extension and perfecting of existing social services,
secure greater benefits.
(7) We are of opinion that essential conditions precedent to the establishment of any
scheme of child endowment should be—
(1) that the Commonwealth Parliament should have first obtained full and
exclusive power —
(a) to control wage fixation, and “ industrial matters ” as defined
in Industrial Statutes ;
(b) to establish and control child endowment.
(2) that any existing State legislation instituting a scheme of child
endowment be repealed.
(3) [a condition of another order] that the basic wage should be reduced
by elimination of the provision for children which is now an integral
part of that wage.
(8) Unless both Child Endowment and wage fixation were under the exclusive
control of one tribunal, new and prolific causes of industrial discontent and
disputes would be created.
SECTION 1.
CONSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS.-COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATIVE POWER WITH REGARD
TO CHILD ENDOWMENT.
1. Under Paragraph 9 of our Terms of Reference, we are required to inquire into and
report upon the legal methods of giving effect to any system of child endowment recommended,
with particular reference to the existing distribution of Commonwealth and State powers.
2. We had, therefore, to consider whether, if the Commonwealth Parliament desired to
legislate for the establishment of Child Endowment, it possesses the necessary powers, and if not.
what further powers it should obtain.
3. On this question we sought the assistance of learned Counsel, viz., Sir Robert Garran,
Solicitor-General for the Commonwealth ; Sir Edward Mitchell, K.C. ; Mr. Owen Dixon, K.C. ;
and Mr. Maurice Blackburn. We have included an opinion of Dr. Evatt, K.C., of the New South
Wales Bar, expressed in his capacity as a member of the Legislative Assembly of that State.
4. Sir Robert Garran was of opinion that under Section 96 of the Constitution,, the
Commonwealth could hand over moneys to the States, “earmarked” for the purpose of Child
Endowment, just as it has done with regard to roads. He was also of opinion that under Section
81 of the Constitution, Child Endowment could be declared one of “ the purposes of the
Commonwealth ”, and a Commonwealth scheme instituted. But in that event, the legislation
of the Commonwealth on the subject would have no effect on State legislation of a similar kind.
He thought that in order to carry out a scheme which would be Commonwealth-wide, the
Commonwealth could proceed only by way of aid to the States, controlling all necessary details
through agreements with the States. Sir Robert Garran was of opinion that under the general
power the Commonwealth could devise a system of child endowment payments without reference
to Arbitration Statutes, or to other Federal or State laws, “ but always on the assumption that
the appropriation power is good.”
5. On the question of the power of the Commonwealth Parliament to appropriate moneys
(under Section 81) for purposes which it declares to be “ purposes of the Commonwealth,” Sir
Robert said that he has always considered Section 81 as conferring “ an absolute power of
appropriation for general purposes, and the Commonwealth Parliament has always acted on that
supposition.” He cited a number of Acts such as the Precious Metals Prospecting Act 1926 ; the
Oil Agreement Act 1920-23-26 ; the Science and Industry Endowment Act 1926 ; the Federal
Aids Roads Act, and many others.
6. He further mentioned a number of items taken from annual Appropriation Acts, in
which the Commonwealth had voted money in respect of matters which at first sight do not
appear to be directly referable to any particular one of the specific powers of the Commonwealth
Parliament.


Sec. 1. —Constitutional Aspects.
7. Sir Robert pointed out that the Commonwealth might acquire complete power over
industrial matters, either by means of an amendment of the Constitution, in accordance with the
provisions of Section 128 of the Constitution, or by a transfer of legislative power from the States
under Section 51 (xxxvii.)
8. Sir Robert said, with regard to the latter method : —“ My own opinion is that any
such reference is irrevocable, and when a power is referred by the States to the Commonwealth,
it is something like an amendment of the Constitution. Thereafter the Commonwealth has
that power, and the States cannot take it away.”
He said, however, that the question is a very difficult one, and he did not like to express
an opinion with any great confidence.
9. Questioned as to whether it would be possible for the Commonwealth to legislate for
Child Endowment under Section 51 fxxiii) of the Constitution, which gives authority for the
Commonwealth Parliament to legislate with regard to Invalid and Old-age Pensions, Sir Robert
said he did not think that provision gives the Commonwealth power to deal with the matter.
10. If the Commonwealth appropriated money for the purpose of Child Endowment,
there is doubt as to whether a Commonwealth Statute dealing with that subject could validly
enact provisions regulating the proper administration of the money, and imposing penalties
upon persons acting fraudulently in connection with applications.
11. Sir Edward Mitchell, K.C., was of opinion that the Commonwealth has no power
to enact such a Statute. “ unless and until ‘ references ’ were made by one or more of the State
Parliaments to the Commonwealth Parliament under section 51 (xxxvii) of ‘ matters ’ which
would enable such legislation to be validly enacted. Under that section ‘ the law * so enacted
would only extend to States by whose Parliament the matter was so referred or which afterwards
adopted that law.”
Sir Edward also said : —“ It is possible that the High Court might hold there was power
to enact such legislation under Section 51 (xxxviii) —although I do fiot think it would.”
He said further that he does not agree with the view held by some lawyers, “ that
legislation of the kind suggested could be enacted upon the ground that the Commonwealth can
dispose of its moneys as it pleases and accompany gifts with the imposition of conditions and
penalties for the breach of such conditions —practically as done in the ‘ Baby Bonus ’ legislation.”
His reason for dissenting from that view was stated thus : —“ I do not agree with this
view—which would necessitate giving to the words ‘ the purposes of the Commonwealth ’ in
section 81 of the Constitution—a much wider meaning than I think would be upheld, although
no doubt, if the Commonwealth Parliament simply confined its legislation to distributing money,
it may be impracticable to attack the legislation for the want of a competent Plaintiff who could
show it or he was injuriously affected by such legislation. But where any rule of conduct is
imposed enforceable by some sanction like a penalty in respect of matters which the Commonwealth
Parliament has no power to legislate about —I think that any person upon whom such penalty
was imposed would be a competent Plaintiff to successfully challenge the constitutionality of
such legislation.”
12. Mr. Owen Dixon, K.C., dealing with the same point by way of a concise answer to a
specific question, said : —“ The Commonwealth Parliament has not power to legislate for the
establishment of a complete system of Child Endowment, including the raising by taxation or
otherwise of the moneys necessary to pay such endowment, and providing for the imposition
of penalties for breaches of the Act.”
13. In a fuller discussion, Mr. Dixon said, inter alia: —“ The subjects of legislative power
confided by the Constitution to the Parliament of the Commonwealth include none which would
enable it to enact a law directly providing a complete scheme of child endowment. If the
Parliament determined on a policy of child endowment, its purpose might perhaps be sufficiently
accomplished by the indirect use of the following powers : —
1. The power to make laws with respect to taxation, but so as not to discriminate
between States and parts of States (Section 51 (ii)).
2. The power which the Parliament has long assumed to authorize the expenditure
of moneys without limitation of subject matters.
3. The power to make laws with respect to census and statistics. (Section 51 (xi)).
4. The power to make laws with respect to matters incidental to the execution of
any power vested by this Constitution in the Parliament or in the Government
of the Commonwealth. (Section 51 (xxxix))


Sec. 1. —Constitutional Aspects.
“ But the real difficulty lies in the question whether in truth the Parliament does possess
a power to authorize the expenditure of revenue upon child endowment.”
“ It has assumed from time to time that it possesses a power to appropriate revenue for
any purpose without regard to the limitation of subject-matter which the Federal system imposes.”
14. Mr. Dixon then cited some Commonwealth Statutes of the kind referred to, including
the Maternity Allowance Act 1912, and expressed the view (in agreement with that of Sir Edward
Mitchell, though contrary to that of Sir Robert Garran) that such appropriations are invalid. He
quoted from a memorandum on the subject composed by a sub-committee of the Committee of
Counsel of Victoria (of which Mr. Dixon was a member) and submitted by him to the Royal
Commission on the Constitution of the Commonwealth. In that memorandum American cases
were discussed and it was pointed out that the United States Congress, like the Commonwealth
Parliament, has disregarded theoretical objections, and has acted on the view that Congress
may appropriate money in aid of matters which the Federal Government is not constitutionally
able to administer and regulate. The Victorian Committee concluded that:—“ Upon its true
interpretation the Commonwealth Constitution restricts the power of Parliament to appropriate
money to subjects assigned to the Federal legislative power.”
15 Their opinion includes the following points : —
Appropriation of money is an exercise of the power of law-making, and not a separate
power.
A Statute to be valid must deal with one or some of the enumerated subjects of
Commonwealth legislative power.
Child Endowment is not one of those enumerated powers, and, therefore, it is not
competent for the Parliament to appropriate money for the purpose of such
endowment.
•
16. Mr. Dixon said that, upon Sir Robert Garran’s view of the power of appropriation,
the Commonwealth could proceed by the indirect methods above suggested.
17. With regard to the point mentioned by Sir Edward Mitchell as to who would be a
competent Plaintiff to attack the constitutionality of a Statute appropriating money for a purpose
outside the legislative competence of the Parliament,
Mr. Dixon remarked that: “ since the repeal of section 4-7 of the Surplus
Revenue Act 1910, by the States Grant Act 1927, it would seem that the States could not.”
18. It appears that the point is discussed more fully in the evidence submitted by Mr.
Dixon to the Royal Commission on the Commonwealth Constitution.
19. Mr. Maurice Blackburn summarises his opinion on the question of the powers of the
Commonwealth Parliament to legislate on the subject of Child Endowment as follows : —
“ In my opinion the Commonwealth Parliament can —
“ (a) validly impose taxation having as its motive the provision of a fund for Child
Endowment;
“(b) validly grant the proceeds of that taxation to the States upon terms and
conditions constituting a Scheme of Child Endowment to be administered
by the States ;
“ (c) validly (except as against the States) itself apply the proceeds of the taxation
to a scheme of Child Endowment to be administered by the Commonwealth ;
“ (d) validly (except as against the States) make the verification by solemn declaration,
according to the State law of the declarant’s residence, a condition of the
payment by the Commonwealth of Child Endowment payments.”
20. Mr. Blackburn’s argument with regard to Clause (c) above, is that—
“ If the Parliament votes money for some purpose not within the legislative
competence nor authorized by the Constitution, I think that it will be ‘ surplus revenue ’
(see section 94) and that the States, or any of them, could claim that it belongs to the.
States (see the expressions on this point in New South Wales v. the Commonwealth
—1908—7 C.L.R. 179). If the suggested application is assailable,it is assailable on the
part of the States only.”


Sec. 1. —Constitutional Aspects.
21. With regard to clause ( d ), Mr. Blackburn’s explanation is in tiiese words : —
“ But if the Act were to impose penalties for breaches of its provisions, persons
affected might successfully question the Act’s validity, provided that the penal clause
objected to could not be severed from the rest of the Act, i.e., struck out without
impairing the completeness of the remainder.”
“It is conceivable that the only breaches of the Act would be breaches of
the obligation upon a claimant for payment, truly to answer questions and make
statements. As State laws provide for the making, on practically any subject, of
extra-judicial declarations, false statements in which render the declarant punishable
as for perjury, it appears to me that the Commonwealth Parliament might validly
enact that each claimant of an endowment payment must verify his claim by
Statutory Declaration according to the law of that State in which he might reside.”
22. Speaking in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly on the New South Wales
Child Endowment legislation, Dr. Evatt said : —
“ So far as Federal Legislation is concerned, I think Mr. Bruce is right. (He w
had quoted a statement made by Mr. Bruce at the Premiers’ Conference in 1927 :
* It can only be dealt with, nationally and by co-operation between the Commonwealth
and the States ’). I do not think the Commonwealth Parliament could of its own motion
pass a law of this nature. It has no power to legislate with respect to pensions with
the exception of invalidity and old-age pensions ; therefore, legislation on the part of
the State Parliaments will be needed.” (Page 1173) .
• “As I read the Constitution, one way in which the scheme can be made a national scheme
covering the whole Commonwealth is for the States to refer the question to the Federal
Parliament # ”
Mr. Arkins.—“ Do I understand you to say that Mr. Bruce could not move in
this direction ? ”
Dr. Evatt. —“ I do not think he could of his own motion, but he could give
money to the States .
Recently, the High Court in the Roads case decided that although the Commonwealth
Parliament cannot make a direct allowance in respect of the main roads of the
Commonwealth, it can pass a law giving money to the States to carry out such a
scheme. Similarly it has power to pass a law allocating money to the State
Parliaments so that the States can proceed with Child Endowment according to
their several constitutions.” (Page 1174.)
23. Another question submitted to counsel was as follows : —
“ Has the Commonwealth power, as part of any such scheme or independently of
any such scheme, to establish a tribunal for the purpose of fixing a basic wage for the
Commonwealth ?”
24. Sir Robert Garran, Sir Edward Mitchell, K.C., Mr. Owen Dixon, K.C., and Mr. Maurice
Blackburn were all of opinion that the Commonwealth Parliament has no such power.
25. All the counsel were also of opinion that a Statute introducing Child Endowment
could not be validly passed under the provision of Section 51 (xxiii), which gives power to the
Parliament to legislate upon Invalid and Old-age Pensions.
26. To the question whether the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration
has power to include in an award a direction that all employers in an industry covered by the
award shall in addition to specified wages pay, say £13 per annum, in respect of each dependent
child of the employees covered by the Award, Sir Edward Mitchell’s opinion was thus expressed : —
“ I think there might be a valid £ inter-state ’ dispute as to such a matter—
within Section 51 (xxxvii) in which case such a direction might be inserted in a valid
Federal award, and if it happened that all the employers in the industry were parties
to this award they would be all bound. No employer in the industry not a party
would be bound. There would be no power to make a common rule in the industry
—to the effect stated in the query.”


Sec. . 1 . —Constitutional Aspects.
27. Mr. Owen Dixon replying to the same question said :—
“The Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration could not include in
an award a direction that in the industry all employers bound by the award shall,
in addition to specified wages, pay say £13 per annum in respect of each dependent
child of the employees covered by the award, unless this was incidental to the
settlement of an industrial dispute extending beyond one State.”
28. Mr. Maurice Blackburn answered the same question by saying : —
“If such a payment as is suggested in this question were claimed in an
industrial dispute, I think that such a direction might validly be included in the
award made in settlement of the dispute.”
29. It will be seen that on some important points the learned counsel consulted are not
all in agreement. The only undoubted legislative power of the Commonwealth Parliament
with regard to the subject of Child Endowment appears to be a power under Section 96 of the
Constitution to “ grant financial assistance ” to the States, and, by agreement, to secure the
application of the moneys handed over, in accordance with specified terms and conditions.
30. Sir Robert Garran appears to be of opinion that the Parliament could act under
Section 81 of the Constitution, and in effect, make Child Endowment a “ purpose of the
Commonwealth ” under that section, by appropriating money for the purpose, and (although
this is not stated unreservedly) could pass a machinery Act regulating the administration, and
imposing penalties for breaches of the Act. On this point, the other learned counsel consulted
held a contrary opinion.
31. Tt may be noted that among the many Acts passed by the Commonwealth Parliament
appropriating money (the Maternity Allowance Act is an example) for a purpose not* within
the enumerated powers of the Parliament, and which Acts in the opinion of the Victorian legal
witnesses are void, not. one has ever been attacked in the High Court. Perhaps the principal
reason for this immunity may be found in the view that most of those Acts effect purposes which
are generally approved by the community, and impose no direct burden or disability on any
individual.
32. In view of the conflict of legal opinion as to the power of the Parliament to deal
comprehensively with the subject of Child Endowment, the existence of a power to legislate on
that subject, in the same way as was done in the case of the Maternity Allowance, must be
regarded as, at best, doubtful.
33. It is not for this Commission to attempt to solve this difficult problem. If at any
time a Commonwealth Government considers that a Commonwealth scheme of Child
Endowment is desirable, and economically possible, it might choose to act on the view that it
possesses the necessary legislative power to effect its purpose. If it is of the opposite opinion,
it will no doubt seek the necessary power by existing constitutional methods.
34. It would, in our opinion, be calamitous for a Commonwealth Government to introduce
a scheme of Child Endowment, unless the validity of the necessary legislation was beyond dispute.
35. From the evidence submitted to us, it appears that there are only two possible ways
in which the Commonwealth Parliament can obtain power — (a) to control wage fixation, and
(b) to establish and control a scheme of child endowment * These two methods (equally applicable
to both matters) are :—
(1) By an alteration of the Constitution under the provisions of Section 128.
(2) By reference of such matters to the Parliament of the Commonwealth, by the
Parliaments of all the States, pursuant to the power conferred by Section
51 (xxxvii) of the Constitution.
36. It is not necessary to elaborate the question of the obtaining of such powers by an
alteration of the Constitution, but in our opinion, the Commonwealth Parliament should not
act upon a reference of the proposed powers by a State or States, unless all the States joined in such
reference.
37. A possible objection by the States to surrender either power, without knowing the
details and incidence of the scheme which the Commonwealth Parliament proposes to adopt,
could be overcome by all the States agreeing to surrender the power to pass an Act setting out a
scheme mutuallv agreed upon by all the States. From Sir Robert Garran’s evidence, it would

Sec. 1. —Constitutional Aspects.
appear there are some difficulties in adopting this method, and in any event it would probably
prove too rigid. Circumstances might arise rendering amendments desirable. A further
surrender of State powers might be necessary before the Commonwealth Parliament could
validly effect those amendments.
38. An alteration of the Constitution by the prescribed method of a referendum (under
Section 128) is, in our opinion, the better method.
SECTION 2.
SOME ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS.
39. A series of witnesses, chiefly, but not wholly, representative of Trade Union
Organizations, urged the institution of a Commonwealth Scheme of Child Endowment providing
the full cost of maintenance for every dependent child under the age of fourteen. A few witnesses
desired to extend the age to sixteen, or even beyond, if the child were continuing some educational
course, technical or otherwise. Without exception the Trade Union representatives urged that
over and above the basic wage as determined in accordance with present methods, the rate of
endowment should be sufficiently high to cover the full cost of maintenance of the child, and
that the funds required should be provided by Commonwealth taxation. Stated in money, the
majority of such witnesses considered that 10s. per week per child (or more) should be paid. In
our opinion that claim can only be considered as applying to the first child. If there is more than
one child, the cost per child would diminish (see para. 601.)
40. The annual amount necessary to make such a payment in respect of all dependent
children in the Commonwealth who are under the age of fourteen, would be about £50,000,000,
or more than double the amount collected in 1925-26 by both Commonwealth and States as
Income Tax ; that is, assuming the amount were to be raised by means of Federal and State
Income Tax, the present return from those taxes would require to be trebled. Expressed in
another form, this sum of £50,000,000 is equivalent to over 57 per cent, of the total taxes
(£87,000,000) raised in the financial year 1926-27 by both Commonwealth and States,
including the large revenue (over £43,000,000) from Customs and Excise. If, as many witnesses
appeared to think both desirable and practicable, that sum of £50,000,000 were to be raised by
means of increases in the Federal Income Tax, the yield of that Tax would have to be about
three and a half times as great as it was in the peak year 1921-22 (when the maximum rate
was 8s. 6d. in the £) and about five and a half times as great as the average yield for the last
four years. For further discussion of this matter, see paragraphs 515-521.
41. Witnesses favoring such a large scheme of endowment were, for the most part,
disinclined to enter upon a consideration of the practicability, or of the economic reactions of so
enormous an addition to the burden of taxation. A reply commonly made to questions upon
the subject was that if Australia could afford to raise hundreds of millions for the War, it could
afford to raise the sums required for Child Endowment. In one or two instances, the witnesses,
on being pressed, admitted that the production of the country would need to be increased in
order to provide the necessary funds. Others were content to urge what in their opinion is the
social desirability of Child Endowment, while disclaiming any competence to discuss the financial
difficulties or the economic effects.
42. Such proposals necessitate a general view of the present economic position of the
Australian community.
43. The first and most important fact is the magnitude of the Australian (Commonwealth
and state) Public Debt, which at the 30th June, 1927, stood at £1,043,481,224.* The 1928-29
Budget Papers show that during the financial year 1927-28 the net increase in the Public Debt
was £33,000,000. This includes “ Loans for States and Federal Capital Commission,” the
amounts of which are not separately stated.
44. In 1914 the total Public Debt of Australia was £318,000,000, so that in thirteen years
the amount has more than trebled. Nearly £300,000,000 of the increase is War debt, but if that
be left out of account, it will be seen that the public debt more than doubled in the years 1914-1927.
45. The five years 1929-1933 will be critical years in relation to the Public Debt, for
the reason that huge sums of debt mature during those years, and will have to be redeemed
or converted. In 1930 alone, the debts maturing (Commonwealth and States) amount to
£107,000,000, while during the five years 1929-33 inclusive, the amounts falling due total about
£256,000,000, of which £152,000,000 represent State loans, and the balance Commonwealth
loans. None of the Commonwealth loans redeemable during that period were raised over-sea,
but State over-sea loans maturing during the same term, amount to over £39,000,000.
* This is exclusive of Municipal Debt totalling about £40,000,000.

Sec. 2. —Economic Considerations .
46. Not only are the five years 1929-33 of critical importance with regard to the maturing
debt, but if we look a little farther ahead, we find that in the ten years succeeding 1933, additional
amounts totalling £276,000,000 must be redeemed or converted. During the fifteen years
1929-1943, a total of about £532,000,000 of debt falls due, or an average of about £35,500,000
per annum.
47. The annual interest on the total public debt as at 30th June, 1927, is £52,000,000.
Of that sum £31,000,000 are payable on account of State debts, and the balance on account of
Commonwealth debts. Roughly about 50 per cent, of the total interest payable is in respect
of loans raised in Australia.
48. During 1926-27 the amount paid out of revenue by the Commonwealth Government
for Sinking Funds in respect of Commonwealth Public Debt was £3,310,426. Under the recent
Financial Agreement between the Commonwealth and the States, the Commonwealth, in respect
of the year 1927-28 contributed towards the Sinking Funds on State debts, a sum of £820,274.
The commitment of the States in this respect was £1,650,000.
49. The following table shows the rapidity with which the Public Debt of Australia has
grown during the five years, 1922-23 to 1926-27 : —
It will be seen that during the four years 1923 to 1927 the total Public Debt increased by
£138,000,000, or at an average rate of £34,500,000 annually. In the two years of greatest increase,
1923-24 and 1925-26, the State debts were increased by £41,000,000 and £38,000,000 respectively.
50. Looking at the immediate pre-war period, we find that from 1909 to 1914 the average
increase in States public debt was about £13,000,000.
51. From 1914 to 1919 (War period) the average was £15,800,000; from 1919 to 1924 the
average was £38,000,000 ; while for the two years 1924-26 the average was £24,500,000. The
average increase in Commonwealth Public Debt for the same two years was about £21,500,000.
52. It is impossible to forecast at what rate the Australian Public Debt will be added to
from year to year by loans of “ new money ”, though a decline in the rate of increase appears
inevitable.
53. The inclusion in the recent Financial Agreement between the Commonwealth and
the States, of permanent and properly safe-guarded provisions for a Sinking Fund applicable
to all debts, suggests that the obligations of the community may be stated in the form of yearly
payments. The rate of Sinking Fund chosen, one-half per cent., will extinguish the debts to
which it is applied in a period of about 53 years. The present total of interest, as shown above,
of Commonwealth and State debts is £52,000,000 per annum and Sinking Fund payments about
£5,750,000.
54. The indebtedness of Australia may then be stated in the form of an obligation to provide,
during 53 years, an annuity of nearly £58,000,000. Presuming the continuance of the Sinking
Fund payments for that period, the present aggregate indebtedness will, at the end of the period,
be extinguished.
55. The provisions for a Sinking Fund, in respect of each future loan, are on the same
lines, that is to say, the sinking fund payments, accumulated at compound interest, will, in 53
years after the date of issue of the loan, amount to the principal sum to be repaid.
56. Of the total volume of State debts about 48 per cent, is represented by Railways and
Tramways ; nearly 15 per cent, by Water Supply, Sewerage and Water Conservation ; 9 per
cent, by Harbour and River Works ; 12 per cent, by land for Settlement, and advances to settlers ;
per cent, by Public Buildings, and the balance chiefly by other public works and purposes.
57. While many of the works carried out by means of State loans are earning income,
in some cases sufficient to pay the whole of the interest, there is a large and growing balance of
interest, particularly in connection with the Railway Services, which, during the last SIX years,
has had to be provided by way Of taxation. In most State Railway Services, the growth of motor


Sec. 2. — Economic Considerations.
competition has been an important element in reducing the capacity of the undertaking to pay
full interest on its capital expenditure, as well as working expenses. An item of cost which has
grown rapidly, and which has borne heavily upon Railway finance, is the increase in wages
determined by Arbitration Courts. More recently, costs have also been added to by reduction in
working hours.
58. With regard to Australian Railways generally, the position for a number of years has
been financially unsatisfactory. As to State Railways, the amount payable as interest on
expenditure from loans on construction and equipment, which in 1917 was £7,865,153, had
risen in 1927 to £14,059,909. A disquieting fact is that for the same eleven years, taking the
whole of the States as a unit, there has been a large and growing net loss each year after debiting
full working expenses and interest. The aggregate net loss under this heading is over £27,000,000,
or an average of about 2,500,000 per annum. It appears certain that the amounts of net loss
thus shown would not fully represent the actual deficit, if the undertakings had been charged
to the proper extent with necessary appropriations for depreciation and obsolescence. For
example, in the table from which the above figures are taken (Bulletin No. 19, “Transport and
Communication,” Commonwealth Statistician) it is shown that in Victoria, for each of the six
years ending 30th June, 1927, there has been a net profit. The evidence of Mr. Harold Clapp,
Chief Commissioner of Victorian Railways, shows that those surpluses would have disappeared,
and would have been replaced by deficits, if the revenue had been debited with proper charges
for depreciation, &c.
59. Mr. Clapp said that for several years it has been impossible to provide, out of revenue,
the large sums which, in a healthy condition of the undertaking, would be set aside annually for
depreciation and obsolescence. He stated that for the year ended 30th June, 1927, the estimated
depreciation amounted to £426,000. This was excluding from consideration the accrued
depreciation of past years. The provision made out of the year’s revenue for the 1927
depreciation was £200,000, thus leaving £226,000 as a debit, which presumably will ultimately
be written off, or form part of a “ funded ” debt. Mr. Clapp subsequently forwarded a statement
in which he said —
“ Since I gave evidence before your Commission, it became necessary to
investigate the question of accrued depreciation in more detail than had been done
before, and when giving evidence before the State Royal Commission on the Railway
Department I stated that the estimated accrued depreciation was £16,536,000.”
60. With regard to the amounts added by wage-fixing bodies, Mr. Clapp stated that between
30th June, 1919, and 30th June, 1927, wage-fixing tribunals had increased the annual pay-roll
of the Victorian Railway Employees by £2,275,000, and he estimated that at the 30th June,
1928, that sum would be increased by another £200,000.
61. The estimate submitted by the Victorian Railways Commissioners to the Commonwealth
Arbitration Court during the hearing of the 44-hours case, showed that the increased cost in labour
and material due to the proposed reduction of hours to 44 per week, would be £636,256 per annum.
62. With regard to the Federal Railways, each of the eleven years in question, 1917 to 1927,
has shown a net loss, after payment of working expenses and interest. The trans-Australian line,
however, has for the last eight years, shown a steadily decreasing amount of net loss, and appears
to have nearly reached the point at which the revenue will be at least sufficient to cover working
expenses, and interest on loan expenditure. The North-Australian line exhibits no such promise,
the annual deficiencies having largely increased during the last three years.
63. As to New South Wales Railways, it is probable that the position is somewhat similar
to that of Victoria, but the Commission was unable to obtain full information from the Department.
Published figures show a loss for the year ended 30th June, 1928, of £1,609,267.
64. With regard to South Australian Railways, the evidence submitted to the Commission
showed that for the year ending 30th June, 1927, the deficit on current operations was £1,118,252.
It was stated that increased wages, decreased hours, and improved working conditions had added
over £900,000 per annum to the cost of working the Railways, as compared with 1915, and that
the application of the 44-hour week decision of the Federal Arbitration Court, would add another
large sum to the working cost. It was further said that at the date of evidence (February, 1928)
a case was before the Commonwealth Arbitration Court which, if it resulted in granting the
Union demands, would cause a further addition to the Wages Bill of about £200,000 per annum.
Witness also said (Q. 10761) that “ when we say the deficit of the last year was £1,118,252, that is
without taking depreciation into account.” And in reply to further questions he made it clear
that accumulated sums in respect of depreciation, which had not been provided for out of revenue,
amounted to £1,562,719.

Sec. 2. — Economic Considerations.
65. The Railway Commissioner, Mr. W. A. Webb, in his Annual Report, dated 30th
August, 1927, made a frank disclosure of the financial position of the South Australian Railways.
He says : —“ Since the beginning of the Railways, for more than 50 years, no provision has been
made, prior to the previous year, for debiting to each year’s operations the proper depreciation of
assets, nor has any reserve been created to take care of the necessary charges for renewals and
replacement of obsolete plant, rolling-stock and equipment
The present balance sheet for the first time presents the true situation.”
66. Mr. Webb showed that the total capital expenditure on the Railways at the 30th
June, 1927, was £18,728,256, and that the annual interest on that sum is £1,352,516.
67. “ The accumulated deficit in working to the 30th June, 1926, was £3,981,099. Due
to the debiting of accumulated depreciation charges, as previously mentioned, the accumulated
deficit to the 30th June, 1927, is £7,061,430.”
The Commissioner said : —“ A sum of £3,596,303 represents the cost of assets which are
no longer in existence and also the depreciation of rolling-stock
still in use. The Railways are debited with interest on this amount.” Some of the causes of
the losses have been already mentioned (paragraph 64). Others are, increases in the cost
of coal (which has added over £250,000 to the working account compared with 1915) and increased
rates of interest. “ The Railways are debited with full interest on all capital expenditure on new
and developmental lines, although most of this added mileage does not even earn sufficient to pay
working expenses.”
68. Published figures in respect of the year ended 30th June, 1928, record a deficit of
£999,862.
69. As in other States, road motor competition takes from the Railways a considerable
volume of high-class traffic.
70. In a paper recently presented to the Victorian Branch of the Economic Society by
Sir Lennon Raws, the accumulated deficit upon Business undertakings, Commohwealth and States,
up to 30th June, 1927, was stated at nearly £60,000,000. Of this sum Railway deficit,
Commonwealth and States, accounts for nearly £44,000,000, more than half of which (£24,000,000)
is the Queensland figure.
71. In all States the position taken up by Railway witnesses was that the Railway services
are in a position in which it is impossible for them to bear the cost of any child endowment
scheme superimposed upon wages.
72. Taking the States as a whole, the balance of interest on State debts which has to be
covered by taxation (largely due to losses on State Railways) has grown from £6,600,000 in
1921-22 to £12,300,000 in 1926-27. The evidence suggests that this item will increase year by
year.
73. While the total debt of Australia has been rising so rapidly, as above indicated,
taxation has risen even more rapidly. A table, prepared for the Commonwealth Arbitration
Court in the forty-four hours case, and quoted by His Honour Judge Lukin, gives a comparison
of the Public Debt; Taxation ; Interest on the Total Debt; and the value of production in
Australia in the years 1911-25 : —
Percentage increases between these years for each :
254 ... 302 .. 429 .. 138
“ That is to say that while our net total debt in 1925 was three and a half times, our
taxation four times, our interest on net total debt five and a quarter times, our production
was only two and one-third times what each respectively was in 1911.” {See also
pagragraphs 87-89).
74. Several witnesses referred to reductions made since 1922 in the rates of Commonwealth
Income Tax, and took the view that it is both desirable and justifiable to restore the high rates
then in force, or even to raise those rates materially, in order to provide funds for Child
Endowment.

Sec. 2. —Economic Considerations.
75. The amounts raised respectively through the medium of Commonwealth Income Tax,
and of the State Income Taxes, for the financial years 1920-21 to 1926-27, are shown in the
following table : —
76. It will be seen that 1921-22 was the financial year in which the Commonwealth Income
Tax collections reached their maximum. The rates of Commonwealth Income Tax, first imposed
in 1915 during the War, had been raised by successive percentages until they stood at a point
more than 70 per cent, above those first prescribed. During the years subsequent to 1921-22,
several reductions in the rate were approved by Parliament, and the scale of rates at present
is about 8 per cent, above the scale originally prescribed in 1915. These reductions in rates caused
corresponding reductions in the collections. The amount collected in 1926-27, £11,126,278,
is about 34 per cent, less than the collections of the peak-year.
77. It will further be observed from the Table, that the successive reductions in amounts
levied under Commonwealth Income Tax have been increasingly off-set by additions to levies
made under State Income Taxes. The combined Commonwealth and State Income Tax
collections for 1926-27 exceeded the collections for any previous year. Successive additions
to State Income Tax levies have gradually absorbed the whole amount by which the Commonwealth
collections have been reduced.
78. With regard to the Land Tax of the Commonwealth and of the States, the position
may be more shortly stated. The Commonwealth collections of Land Tax have varied from
about £2,200,000 at the beginning of the six-year period (1920-1921 to 1925-26) to £2,500,000 at
the end of that period. The State collections on account of Land Tax during the same period
have increased year by year from £1,100,000 in 1920-21 to £1,400,000 in 1925-26.
79. In considering the pressure of taxation, it is essential to take account of the sums
collected from the community under the heading of Customs and Excise, as well as under the
so-called “ direct ” taxes upon incomes and upon land values. The following table shows the
Customs and Excise collections for the six-year period 1921-22 to 1926-27 :
80. It will be observed that while the Excise Revenue has increased gradually until in
1926-27 it was about 14 per cent, higher than in 1921-22, there has been a large and rapid increase
in the Customs Revenue, the difference between the figures of the final year compared with those
of the initial year exhibiting an increase of about 84 per cent. The Customs and Excise collections
for the year 1927-28 showed a decline of £2,106,000 as compared with the figures of the previous
year.
81. The Customs and Excise collections are of great importance in relation to the cost of
living, since the amounts paid as Customs and Excise Duties are more certainly “ passed on ”
to the ultimate consumer, with profit additions, than are payments made by way of direct
taxation.


Sec. 2. — Economic Considerations.
82. Production. —One of the questions of greatest importance is whether production in
relation to population is, or is not, keeping pace with the great increases in the community s
liabilities.
83. In a study of Australian Productive Efficiency by Mr. C. H. Wickens, the
Commonwealth Statistician, published in the Economic Record for November, 1927, Mr. Wickens
gives a table of the productive efficiency Index, 1908 to 1924 inclusive, seventeen years in all.
Comparing the first five years of the period with the last five years, Mr. Wickens concludes that
there is evidence that in respect of all industries combined there has been in the twelve years,
from the middle of the first five years, to the middle of the last five years, an increase of 1.66
per centum in the productive efficiency per person engaged. That table was in evidence before
the Commonwealth Arbitration Court in the 44-hours case (see page 66 of Report of that case).
His Honour Judge Lukin, who quoted the table, with Mr. Wickens conclusions based upon it,
quoted also from a memorandum prepared by Sir George Knibbs, in which, referring to the same
table, Sir George said : —“ It was apparently admitted that for the purpose of comparing the
productive efficiency at different dates, the four years, 1910, 1911, 1912, and 1913 might very
appropriately be compared with the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. The indexes for the
two sets of years are given as 1058, 1000, 1008, 1053, the total being 4119, or average 1030 ;
and 1032, 999, 976, and 1079, the total being 4086, or average 1022.”
He adds“ Thus one sees that despite all advance in technical organization, despite
all improvements in machinery, and all reactions which tend to more efficient production, there is,
according to these figures, a retrograde effect, taking the four years into account.”
84. The increase in equipment referred to by Sir George Knibbs, and particularly in the
unit of horse-power, which is commonly used in making comparisons m these matters, does
not appear in Mr. Wickens’ discussion of the question, his table apparently being based merely
upon the money value of production of the different industries, with the necessary corrections
for variation in numbers of persons engaged, and changes in price level.
85. In evidence before this Commission, Mr. P. J. Pringle, representing the Victorian
Chamber of Manufacturers, referred to the table in question and to the use made of it in the
Arbitration Court. Quoting the manufacturing production for 1911, per head of the estimated
population, namely £41 5s., Mr. Pringle took the corresponding figures for the years 1921-22 and
1925-26, showing that they produced an average result of £39 6s. 2d., as the value of manufacturing
production per head of the population. This, he said, means that every inhabitant has produced
5 per centum less than in 1911. He also said that while the wages paid to employees in
manufacturing industries in the Commonwealth increased on the equated value of money from
£92.26 in 1911 to £109.61 in 1925-26, or 18.82 per centum, the value added per employee to
materials in the process of manufacture rose from £164 to £176, or only 7.31 per centum,
notwithstanding that each employee had at his command 2.96 horse-power in 1925 as compared
with 1.10 horse-power in 1911, or an increase of 169 per centum.
86. It may be noted that in Mr. Wickens’ discussion of this matter, he gave separate
figures for agriculture and kindred industries for the same period of seventeen years, and
concluded from an examination of those figures, that, comparing the first five years of the period
with the last five, there is evidence, for the interval of twelve years,, of an increase in productive
efficiency per person engaged of 3 per centum for this group. As already indicated, different
results may be obtained from the figures of this period of 17 years, according to whether the
average of the whole of the years is taken, or whether, as in comparisons by Mr. Wickens and by
Sir George Knibbs, separate groups within the period are selected. In any case, the figures
appear to take no account of the great increase in the instruments of production, particularly
in horse-power, referred to by Mr. Pringle.
87. It is difficult to take any other view than that there is, at the best, a lack of advance
in productivity where, as in manufacturing industries, the aids to such advance have been most
liberally supplied.
88. On the pastoral and agricultural side, we find the foundation of Australian prosperity
in two great staple products —wool and wheat. These are almost entirely dependent upon the
movement of world markets. While prices have been satisfactory for some years, no prophecy
can be made as to the continued stability of those prices, particularly as to wheat. Expert
opinion communicated to the Commission suggests that the trend of wheat prices will probably
be such as to emphasize the need for caution in Australian finance.


Sec. 2. — Economic Considerations.
89. Summarizing, we find as the chief features of the present economic situation in
Australia
(1) A very large total of Public Debt.
(2) A very large annual interest charge.
(3) A large and increasing total of Public Debt unrepresented by existing assets, or
represented by assets not earning full interest upon their cost.
(4) A high and growing taxation. Taking the years 1921—22 to 1925—26, we find
that Commonwealth taxation increased by £5,000,000 and States taxation
by £6,000,000. For the years 1926-27, the combined total of Commonwealth
and State taxation was £87,000,000.
(5) In production, an absence of advance such as might reasonably have been expected.
90. This slight reconnaissance of the Australian position seems to us to lead to the
Inescapable conclusion that any proposals, (such as for Child Endowment) involving a serious
addition to taxation could only claim acceptance, if it were possible to demonstrate that their
adoption would produce benefits more than compensating for the difficulties and disadvantages
which such additional taxation would inevitably bring in its train.
91. In our opinion, that has not been demonstrated, and study of the evidence does not
suggest to us that such a demonstration is possible.
92. Some of the specific proposals involving taxation are discussed in paragraphs 40 and
518-524.
SECTION 3.
CHILD ENDOWMENT OR FAMILY ALLOWANCES—EXISTING SYSTEMS.
A. EUROPE.
93. Child Endowment or Family Endowment, as a part of the social or industrial scheme,
of modern life, has a short history. So far as it has formed a part of Government administration,
it appears to have had its beginning in France, in 1862, in the reign of Napoleon III., when by an
Imperial decree an allowance of 10 centimes a day for each child below the age of 10 was granted
to seamen up to the rank of Quartermaster of over five years’ service. In 1908 this allowance
was transformed into a house bonus for all married seamen, without consideration of the number
of dependent children. In 1913 the principle was applied to officers, non-commissioned officers,
and soldiers attached to civilian offices and the Ministry of Marine, as well as to members of the
gendarmerie employed by the Ministry for the Colonies. The allowance in these cases was 200
francs a year for each child after the first, and up to the age of sixteen years.
94. Various grants to employees of specified departments had been made from 1899 onwards,
apparently without any decision to extend such a system to Government Departments generally.
The effect of the war upon prices, and consequently upon the cost of living, created difficulties
which in 1917 caused the French Government to deal with the matter in a more complete way.
For all civil servants whose annual salary did not exceed 4,500 francs, an allowance of 100 francs
a year was granted for each child under 16 years of age. Where there were not more than two
children the maximum qualifying salary was 3,600 francs. Following some minor changes it
was prescribed in November, 1918, that salary limits should be abolished, and the amount of
allowance fixed at 350 francs for each of the first two children, and 480 francs for each subsequent
child. This increase in the amount of allowance where there were more than two children in the
family was avowedly based upon the desire to encourage large families, and the belief that such
allowance would have an effect on population increase. The 1918 increase of allowance was not,
however, the final increase, for in 1924 the scale applying to officials was increased from 350
francs per year for each of the first two children to 495 francs, and to 840 francs for the third and
any subsequent child. The example of the State was widely followed by other authorities and
by the governing bodies of French cities.
95. According to Professor Douglas, “ Wages and the Family ,” page 50, it seems probable
that the 1,000,000 persons who are in government service receive annually over 400,000,000
francs in the form of allowances. This total of 1,000,000 persons appears to include about 220,000
employees of municipal and other authorities who, in the narrow sense of the word, are not State
employees.


Sec. 3. —Child Endowment. — A. Europe.
96. The family allowance movement in France is notable, not only because of its adoption
by the Government and by municipal and other authorities created by the State, but also because
of the wide range of voluntary action to effect the same purpose. Two of the great Railway
Companies instituted family allowance in 1890, and a third in 1892. The four other great
railway companies in France had also established similar systems by 1916, but there were great
differences, both as to the amounts paid and the conditions of benefit. In 1916, at the instance
of the Government, the railway companies agreed upon a uniform system with an- increase on
the general scale of allowances then current. All employees who were heads of families and in
receipt of salaries less than 6,000 francs a year, were granted allowance for every dependent child
under sixteen years on the following scale : —
For the first child .. .. .. 50 francs per annum
For the second and third child .. .. 100 francs per annum each
For each of the following children .. 200 francs per annum each
97. In 1919, the Ministry of Labour subsidized the funds from which allowances were being
paid to Railway workers, to an extent sufficient to make the scale the same as that for all
Government employees. The number of children of railway employees in that year who
benefited from the allowance was 327,000, and the total amount of allowance about 120,000,000
francs, or an average of 366 francs for every dependent child. Of this total, 65,000,000 francs
was contributed by the State, and 55,000,000 by the railway companies. The total number of
employees affected was 416,700. *
98. Many of the tramway services and other public utilities adopted the system of the
Railway companies and that formerly prevailing in the Government Service, namely, an annual
grant of 330 francs for each of the first two children, and 480 francs for each child beyond the
second..
99. In another branch of industry, namely, coal-mining, some of the companies had, even
before the war, voluntarily introduced schemes of family allowances. The movement was
greatly extended during and after the war, and in that industry is now almost universal. Many
of the allowances are the result of agreements between employees and employers. The rates,
however, have not been unified as they were in the railway systems. In the north, and in
Pas-de-Calais, the allowance was fixed in 1920 at one franc for each dependent child for each
day worked by the father, but most of the allowances in the mining industry are lower than this.
In some cases the payment of the allowance is made conditional upon the miners working a certain
number of days per month, excluding those lost through illness. In many cases, allowances
are made for dependent wives as well as children.
100. In 1924 the total amount paid out in allowances by the mining industry was
approximately 80,000,000 francs, equivalent to between 5 per cent, and 6 per cent, of the wages
paid. It may be noted that, while the amounts originally fixed by way of child allowances in
the mining industry were the result of agreement by joint committees representing the employers
and employees, as time went on these rates were occasionally altered in connection with the
settlement of industrial disputes. On a number of occasions when such disputes arose, arbitrators,
appointed by the Government, were called in, and their awards frequently embodied provisions
for family allowances and generally at a level higher than that fixed by the joint committees.
The 1927 scale for State employees in France was : —
For the first child .. .. .. .. .. 604 francs per annum
For the second child .. .. .. .. 806 francs per annum
For the third child .. .. .. .. .. 1,209 francs per annum
For the fourth and each subsequent child .. .. 1,411 francs per annum
101. Apart from the adoption of a system of Family Allowances by the State, and by
such great groups as the Railway Companies and Coal Mining Companies, a very considerable
movement took place among manufacturers and other employers, who individually controlled
much fewer number of employees. The movement among this section of the community appears
to have owed its origin and incentive to M. Romanet, the manager of the Joya Engineering
Works at Grenoble in 1916. In that year M. Romanet, as a result of investigation into the
domestic conditions of his employees, satisfied himself thatfthe wages were then insufficient
to meet the needs of married workers having children. On his recommendation the proprietors of
the Works granted allowances on the following scale for children under the age of thirteen years:—
First child .. .. .. .. francs per month
Second child .. .. .. .. 18 francs per month
Third child? .. .. .. .. 31J francs per month
Fourth child ,. .. .. .. 48 francs per month


Sec. 3. — Child Endowment. — A. Europe.
102. The movement met with favour among other engineering employers in the district
and was unanimously adopted. In 1918, the rates were raised, and in order to prevent any
prejudice to the chance of employment of the married man, a so-called Compensation Fund was
instituted, into which all contributions by the employers were paid and thence distributed to the
workmen entitled. It thus became a matter of indifference to an employer whether he engaged
single men or those with family responsibilities. The movement grew with great rapidity through
France until, in 1925, the employers who had adhered to this scheme numbered 11,200, their
employees 1,210,000, while the total benefits paid in that year amounted to 160,000,000 francs.
103. At a Conference held at Grenoble in 1926 it was stated that the total number of
employees in France working under a system of Family Allowances was about 3,500,000, or
about five-sevenths of the total population industrially occupied. This total includes State
and municipal employees.*
104. A computation made in 1926 by Mr. J. H. Richardson, of the International Labour
Office, gives in British currency the equivalent of the average family allowance in France as
follows :— s r ]'
First child : .. .. • • 5 0 per month
Second child .. .. .. .. .. 12 6 per month
Third child .. .. .. .. .. 22 0 per month
Fourth child .. .. .. .. .. 34 0 per month
These figures apply to the workers in industries governed by the so-called Compensation
Funds. The allowances paid to those who are not in the funds are somewhat larger. The
extremely rapid spread of the voluntary movement for the payment of family allowances among
manufacturers and other employers in France has been attributed, partly, to an attempt made
in 1920 to make it compulsory for all employers to pay family allowances.
105. In that year M. Bokanowski introduced a Bill in the Chamber of Deputies for the
compulsory payment by all employers of family allowances. This proposal was strongly opposed
by organizations of employers. It was urged that any form of State compulsion would lack the
necessary flexibility and adaptation to local needs and conditions. It was also objected that
the cost would be considerably augmented, as the Bill proposed allowances considerably larger
than those then customary. It was said, too, that cost of administration of State funds would
be greater than that of local funds, and much emphasis was placed upon the desirability of giving
opportunity for further free development of private initiative. The trade union influence on the
other side was, and is, in favour of the introduction of State compulsion. The Bokanowski
Bill was referred to a committee of deputies, but it was never passed into law.
106. In Belgium the family allowances system has also taken root. Beginning in a small
way during the war, it received considerable impetus about 1921, partly through the example of
France, and partly because it was found that a considerable migration of Belgian workers to
France was occurring, especially among family men who were anxious to secure the extra allowance
for dependants then being paid by French employers. In 1926 it was estimated that there were
400,000 persons in private employ who were benefiting by family allowance plans in Belgium,
and the annual amount being paid was about 40,000,000 francs. There are in addition 230,000
persons employed by the State to whom allowances may apply. In Belgium, as in F ranee, some
action has been taken to make payment of such allowances compulsory. The Federation of
Trade Unions drew up a Bill providing for a monthly payment of 30 francs where there is one
child under fourteen years, or invalid, or one incapable of earning, of —
45 francs for the second child.
60 francs for the third child.
65 francs for the fourth child.
107. The proposal was that the scheme should be financed by contributions of employers
60 per cent, of the total, workers 10 per cent., and the State 30 per cent. The socialist members
of the Belgian Parliament voted against the introduction of the Bill, and nothing has yet been
done. Both in France and in Belgium, there is evidence of much divergence of opinion, not
only upon the major question of establishing a system of child endowment by law, but also on the
numerous matters of detail which inevitably arise in connection with such systems. Although
compulsion has been demanded in France, Belgium and Holland, and in each case with a greater
or less measure of State subsidy, everything actually achieved so far has been by individual
initiative or by the initiative of public bodies.
* In a report issued in February, 1928, by the International Labour Office, M. Crehange, Assistant Director at the French Labour
Ministry is quoted as estimating the number of wage-earners in France who are entitled to family allowances at 4,000,000, made up as
follows : 1,500,000 workers belonging to Compensation Funds ; 1,500,000 employees of the State, the Departments, and Communes ;
and finally a group of 1,000,000 wage-earners, consisting chiefly of miners and railwaymen.

108. In Germany before the War, the Government had been accustomed to provide special
allowances to those of its officials who had dependent children, but such a system had not
extended into industry except in a few special cases of semi-monopolistic concerns. During the
war, the practice of paying allowances to workers in private industries was extended, but at the
time of the Revolution in 1918, after the Armistice, the Trade Unions who had been opposed to
such allowances succeeded in having them abolished. With the rapid rise of prices in 1919 and
1920, the system was to a considerable extend reintroduced in private employment,-and in 1920
was extended to all branches of governmental employment. For reasons which are not apparent,
the system has not been completely adopted in industry, there being a sharp division in this
respect between different groups, and to some extent within certain large groups. Since the
stabilization of the currency, its application has been very much restricted. For example, it
is said that the payment of allowances has been adopted by approximately half of each of the
following industries :—Stone, clay and glass, printing, commerce, transportation (other than
railroads—the system is universal on the State railroads), sugar, dairying, slaughtering, and baking.
It has scarcely found a foothold in the clothing, shoemaking, leather, building, wood-working,
brewing, milling and tobacco trades.
109. At the beginning of 1927 the number of recipients was as follows :—
T , . Number of
Industr y* recipients.

Breweries and flour-mills .. .. .. .. .. 8,365
Paper manufacture .. .. .. .. .. 21,200
(a) Mining Industry. —The mining industry is the only one in which the payment of
family allowances is altogether general. The current rates paid vary to some extent from one
district to another, and this also applies to the proportion of the wages represented by the
allowances. The following table gives the rates of allowances and wages for top rippers in
certain districts in June, 1927.
Rate of Wages and Family Allowances for Top Rippers in June, 1297.
(6) Metallurgical Industry. —Of the 484,416 workers in this industry in receipt of
allowances, 221,000 are heavy metal workers ; 56 per cent, work in the Rhenish-Westphalian
basin, and 20 per cent, in Bavaria. The rate of the allowance varies considerably from one
district to another. The following table gives the rates in force in the principal districts at the
end of June, 1927 :
The allowances paid for a wife and two children represent approximately from 3| to 6 per cent,
of the wages of a skilled worker, and from 5 to 8 per cent, of those of an unskilled worker.


Sec. 3.— Child Endowment. — A. Europe.
(c) Other Industries. —The system of family allowances is much less general in the other
industries. Twenty-one collective contracts, covering 168,809 workers in the textile industry,
provide for the payment of family allowances. At the end of June, 1927, the rates of the
allowances paid for the wife and for each child were : —
Pfennigs.
Frankfort-on-Main .. • • • • .. 3 per hour
Berlin and Cologne • • • • • • . . 2 per hour
Bremen .. .. • • • • .. 1 per hour
Essen . . .. .. • • • • • • 100 per week
In the chemical and soap-making industries, the rate of the allowances varies from two to four
pfennigs per hour and per dependent member of the family. In the paper industry, the rates
are from one to two pfennigs per hour. In the breweries, the weekly rates are 2.30 marks at
Cologne, Dortmund, and Essen, and three marks at Aix-la-Chapelle.
110. The system of family allowances was introduced into the banks in 1919, and became
general from 22nd October, 1920, when a national collective contract, valid for every part of the
Reich, was concluded. The number of bank employees affected is between 80,000 and 90,000
(including commercial employees and workmen attached to the establishments) and the number
of recipients of allowances is approximately 45 per cent, of this figure. Some 36,000 wives and
44,000 children are beneficiaries.
111. The rate of allowances for the wife and each child is 20 marks a month in the case
of employees in the large cities. In smaller places, the allowance is 4, 8, 12 and 16 per cent,
below this figure.
112. With regard to officials and employees of public administration, the position in
Germany, according to the latest report on the subject issued by the International Labour Office
is as follows :—
113. The payment of family allowances is general in the case of the officials and employees
of municipal and State authorities, including the national railways. The general rate of the
allowance paid to employees is at present 3 pfennigs per hour for the wife and each child under
sixteen years of age. Government officials receive in respect of dependent children an allowance
of 16 marks per month for each child under six years of age, 18 marks for each child between
six and fourteen, and 20 marks for each child between 14 and 21. The allowance is not paid
after the child is sixteen unless it is attending a secondary school or university, is receiving
vocational training, or is suffering from some physical or mental disability which prevents it
from earning anything, or unless the child’s own income does not exceed the amount of the
allowance including the cost-of-living bonus. If the child’s income exceeds the amount of the
family allowance, including the cost-of-living bonus, but is less than twice the amount of the
family allowance, the parents receive one-half the allowance. Should the child’s income be more
than twice as much as the family allowance, including the cost-of-living bonus, the allowance is
stopped.
114. These allowances are granted in respect of legitimate, legitimated, acknowledged
or adopted children, or children of a former marriage living at home. Married officials also receive
an allowance of 10 marks per month for their wives, in addition to which a supplementary
allowance of 2 marks a month has been granted for the fiscal year of 1927. Officials employed
by the State and communes receive the same allowances, whether they work for an actual
administration or for a public industrial undertaking.. The same allowances are also in force
on the State railways, and postal, telegraph, and telephone services.
115. The number of workers employed by the Reich and by the States, provinces, districts,
and communes, who are entitled to family allowances is 825,000, the total number of officials
being 885,000.
116. Herr Leipart, head of the National Federation of German Trade Unions, is quoted
by Professor Douglas as opposing the reduction of the wage of single men, on the ground that
they should be given enough to provide for marriage, and to meet their needs for education and
recreation. As a substitute, he proposes that the State should grant subsidies to those with
families, in the form of lower taxes, free clothing, free milk for the child, together with an
extension of free public school education. The Christian or Catholic Trade Unions, on the other
hand, have favored the system of cash allowance.


Sec. 3. — Child Endowment. — A. Europe.
117. The payment of family allowances to State employees has been adopted in a number
of countries, including Austria, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,
Greece, Holland, Irish Free State, Italy, Norway, Poland, Servia, Sweden, and Switzerland.
With regard to many of these countries, however, the evidence appears to show that so far as
the system has been introduced into industry generally it does not promise to be permanent.
This remark does not appb to France and Belgium.
118. In a letter received by the Commission from the International Labour Office, Geneva,
dated November, 1927, the Chief of the Intelligence and Liaison Division says : —“ The general
situation may be summarized by saying that in France and Belgium, the equalization fund
system, introduced by the employers, has increased in importance during recent years. Also,
the State, especially in France, has introduced important provisions for the benefit of private
persons with large families, and pays allowances to its employees. In other Continental
European countries, family endowment has declined in importance during recent years, especially
in private industry ; in a number of these countries, however, the system is still applied in some
industries, and for the employees of public authorities. In Great Britain there is no important
application of the principle, although the Family Endowment Society is focussing public attention
on the subject, and various political parties are examining it; the Independent Labour party
has declared itself in favour of a system of allowances provided from State revenue. Outside
Europe, except in Australia and New Zealand, the system has attracted little attention.”
119. The information given as to the development of family allowance schemes in Europe
must be read with the knowledge that in none of the countries where these schemes are in operation
is there any system of fixation of wages by law. This constitutes a fundamental distinction between
those schemes, and the schemes which are now in operation in New Zealand and in New South
Wales.
120. It is further to be borne in mind that while there is evidence of the existence of
humanitarian motives in the initiation of many of the European schemes, it is also patent that
another motive in their inauguration was that a grant of family endowment avoided the necessity
for an all-round increase of wages, applicable both to married and unmarried workers. This
could be shown by public admissions made by leading members of some of the great equalization
funds. It might be argued that this view is economically sound, and justifiable on the ground
that the actual needs of unmarried men, or of married men without families, were already met
by the existing wages. Indeed, there appears to be no evidence that such schemes would have
come into existence at all had it not been for the accepted insufficiency of current rates of wages
to provide a suitable standard of living for workers’ families, especially those in which the numbers
of children exceed two.
CHILD ENDOWMENT OR FAMILY ALLOWANCES—EXISTING SYSTEMS.
B.—FAMILY ALLOWANCES IN NEW ZEALAND.
121. In 1926, the New Zealand Government introduced and passed an Act providing for
family a'lowances. The amount of the allowance was fixed by the Act at 2s. per week for each
child (under the age of fifteen years) in excess of two, provided that the average weekly income,
including the amount of allowance, if any, payable under the Act does not exceed £4 plus 2s.
for each child in excess of two. For example, an applicant with eight children under fifteen
years of age, whose weekly income does not exceed £4, is eligible for an allowance of 12s. weekly,
i.e., at the rate of 2s. weekly for each child in excess of two. In the case of an applicant with
the same number of children, but whose weekly income is more than £4, the allowance will be
at the rate of the difference between his weekly income and £4 12s., e.g., if his income is £4 5s.
weekly, then his allowance will be 7s. weekly.
122. The benefits of the Act do not extend to illegitimate children, nor to any child not
maintained as a member of the family of the applicant, nor to any child to whom a pension is
paid out of public moneys. In computing the average weekly income, there are computed all
moneys or money’s worth received during the preceding year, exclusive of payments made from
any registered friendly society. The average income is also taken to include interest at 5 per
cent, on the value of the beneficial interest of any member of the family in real or personal property
(other than residence, furniture, or personal effects). Allowances under this Act, save in exceptional
cases, are paid to the mother. The allowances must be expended exclusively for the benefit
of the child or children.
123. The residence conditions which qualify applicants are :—
(i a ) That the applicant and his wife have been permanently resident in New Zealand
for one year ; and
(. b ) That the children to be benefited have been resident in New Zealand for one year,
or have been born therein.
No allowance is payable in the case of aliens or Asiatics.


Sec. 3. —Child Endowment. — B. New Zealand.
124. In his second reading speech in the House of Representatives (see New Zealand
Parliamentary Debates, August, 1926, page 527 et seq) the Honorable Mr. Anderson, Minister in
charge of Pensions, said that the Ministry had carefully considered a scheme on a contributory
basis, but had decided that such a basis would not be satisfactory in New Zealand.
125. On figures deduced from particulars in the most recent census, the Ministry estimated
that the cost under the Act would be £260,000 per annum, based on round figures of 20,000
children. The Ministry was satisfied that the principle of the Bill was a strong one.
126. There was much criticism by Opposition members of the smallness of the amount
to be granted, 2s. per week per child. In reply to this, the Prime Minister, the Right Honorable
J. G. Coates, said : “ It may be small, and, incidentally I may say in candour it was the intention
to give more, but on account of the somewhat hazy position of the future, it is not thought wise
to do so.”
127. In the course of the Debate, the view of the Opposition was stated by Mr. Parry
(page 600), thus : —“ The principle of the Bill is good. At least it will establish a precedent in
this country that will be pushed—make no mistake about that—at every conceivable opportunity,
with the object of giving to the children, in every family of more than two, full maintenance.
Before this Government, or any other Government can say it is doing a fair thing by the children
of New Zealand, we have to see to it that provision is made for full maintenance for every child
in our country.”
128. With regard to the limitations of the allowance to children in a family exceeding two
it was shown in the debate that the unit adopted by the New Zealand Arbitration Court in fixing
wages is man and wife and two children.
129. The Right Honorable the Prime Minister of New Zealand kindly supplied the
Commission with the following information : —
“ For the period of twelve months ended the 31st March, 1928, the number of
applications lodged was 3,980, of which 3,154 were granted and 579 were declined.

When introducing the Bill in the House of Representatives in 1926, the
Honorable the Minister of Pensions estimated the annual liability in respect of
Family Allowances at £250,000, this estimate being based on figures supplied by
the Government Statistician from information collected at the 1926 census relating to
the weekly income of breadwinners. From these figures, it was deduced that
approximately 23,000 fathers of families of three or more children with 50,000
children under fifteen years (i.e., children in excess of two) were eligible for the
family allowance on the father’s earning power. Experience has shown, however,
that this estimate of the annual liability will be by no means realized for some
time at any rate, and the discrepancy may be reasonably accounted for by the
following:—
(a) The Government Statistician did not allow in his computation for income
other than that shown on the census papers, whereas the Act provides for
the charging as income of 5 per cent, on all property owned other than that
used as a home, quite apart from the actual receipts of the family ;
( b) No allowance was made for other disqualifications under the Act;
(c) Many people apparently under-stated their income on the census papers ;
. (d) The experience of the Department in respect of pensions generally is that
with regard to a new class of allowance many people do not apply
immediately the law becomes operative ;
(e) The low rate of the allowance has no doubt deterred many people from
applying who would have become applicants were the allowance larger.

The administration of the Act has been placed under the control of the
Commissioner of Pensions, and, with the existing machinery for administration of
pensions generally, the investigation of family allowance applications has proceeded
smoothly. While no particular record has been kept of the cost of administration of
family allowances, as distinct from other activities of the Department, it is safe to
assume that the cost has been well within the percentage shown last year as the total
cost of administration, to the total payments of the Department, namely 2.48 per cent.
It will be seen that the expenditure under the Act is likely, at any rate for the
first year or two, to be considerably less than that estimated by the Government in
submitting the matter to Parliament. One of the principal reasons appears to be that
a great number of persons who were supposed to have incomes low enough to make
themljeligible as applicants under the Act have in fact, incomes beyond the limit
allowed.”


iSec. 3. —Child Endowment. — B. New Zealand.
130. In his annual report (to 31st March, 1928) the Commissioner administering the Act,
referring to this matter, said : —“ It must be remembered that the experience in connection with
the old-age pension and the widows’ pension law was that in the early years of both these schemes
there was on the part of certain classes of people either a lack of knowledge of the legislation
passed to benefit them, or a diffidence to take advantage of such legislation. In regard to the
family allowance at least another full year’s working will be required to enable anything like
reliable estimates to be adduced.”
CHILD ENDOWMENT OR FAMILY ALLOWANCES—EXISTING SYSTEMS.
C.—CHILD ENDOWMENT IN NEW SOUTH WALES.
131 While schemes for child endowment were considered by the Legislature in New South
Wales earlier than in New Zealand, it was not until after the New Zealand Act had been placed
on the Statute Book that the New South Wales Legislature took effective action.
132. In 1919, under the Premiership of the Honorable W. A. Holman, K.C., the
Government introduced a scheme for child endowment. At that time, in New South Wales a
living wage was fixed year by year, on the inquiry of a body called the Board of Trade, into any
increase or decrease in the cost of living. In 1919, the current basic wage was £3 per week, and
the Board was conducting an inquiry into the cost of living with a view to further determination
of the wage. The Government learned that in all probability the Board would declare a basic
wage of £3 17s. in lieu of £3. This would have meant a very heavy increase in wages expenditure
by the Government, especially on railways and tramways, while private enterprises would, of
course, have been affected in the same way. There was also a fear that the large sudden increase
in wages would cause a serious amount oi unemployment.
133. The party then in power in the State was committed to the principle of child
endowment, and thought the time opportune for introducing a Bill on the subject, which
accordingly they did. It was proposed to alter the unit—man, wife, and two children —used
by the Board of Trade for the purpose of determining the basic wage, and to adopt the unit of
man and wife only, the basic wage to be fixed in relation to the cost of living of a married pair.
This basic wage was to be supplemented by a payment of 7s. 6d. per week in respect of each
dependent child, and on the statistical ratio of children to employees at that time, it was
estimated that a payment by employers of 8s. per week per employee would provide the necessary
funds. The amounts so provided were to be paid into a pool from which distribution was to be
made to each wage-earner according to the number of his children.
134. The Bill met with opposition both from employers and from trade unions. The
opposition of the employers was not removed by the argument that the passing of the Bill would,
in fact, reduce the total amount of wages they would probably be called upon to pay. The
increase under the endowment scheme (regarding the endowment payment as part of wages)
would be from £3 to £3 8s., while, without endowment, it seemed likely that wages would be
increased to £3 17s. The unions opposed the Bill chiefly because it was regarded as depriving
the workers of some part of the expected increase in wages. The Bill passed the Legislative
Assembly, and also the second-reading stage in the Legislative Council, but was defeated on
the third reading. Subsequently, the Board of Trade declared the basic wage at the expected
amount of £3 17s.
135. In the following year, the Holman Government was defeated, and was succeeded by
a Labour Government, which in 1921 introduced a Bill to give effect to a scheme of family
allowances. This Bill prescribed a family unit of man, wife, and two dependent children, instead
of man and wife only, as in the 1919 Bill. In view of the enlarged family unit adopted it was
proposed that allowances should be paid in respect of each child exceeding two in the family.
This Bill also passed the Legislative Assembly, but was rejected by the Council.
136. In 1926, Mr. Lang’s Government introduced a Family Endowment Bill, which, after
lengthy debates in both Houses, was passed into law in jMarch, 1927, and was brought into
operation on the 22nd July of that year. The Act provides for payment to the mother of 5s.
per week for each dependent child under the age of fourteen years. The fund from which these
payments are made is derived from a tax, levied upon every employer, of 3 per cent, upon
the total amount of wages paid by him.


Sec. 3. — Child Endowment. — C. New South Wales.
137. The levy was continued for three months and one week after the Act came into
operation. It had then become probable that claims upon the fund would be so much less than
at first anticipated that continuance of the statutory levy for the whole year would be unnecessary.
The levy was therefore suspended. We understand that the amoimt collected during the first
fourteen weeks proved approximately sufficient to cover the cost for the whole financial year.
That cost was about £1,250,000. This included cost of administration, and an amount of special
non-recurring expenditure of, roughly, £50,000.
138. These figures are in striking contrast to those given in the statement of the then
Premier of New South Wales, the Honorable J. T. Lang, in a foreword to a pamphlet issued by
the Government in August, 1927, outlining the objects of the Act.
He said : —“ The fact that about 596,000 children will be endowed, and that
about £5,000,000 per annum will be paid to mothers for the maintenance and education
of their children has fully justified the Government in accepting the measure as it left
the Legislative Council.” ( See paragraphs 146-148.)
139. One note-worthy feature of the Act is that, although endowment is payable in respect
of the children of non-wage earners as well as of wage-earners, the Act only provides one source
of revenue, namely, the levy of 3 per cent, on wages.
140. The Act provides that the Crown shall be considered as an employer. This provision
imposes liability upon the great State enterprises such as railways, tramways, and other forms of
public undertaking.
141. The Act limits the full amount of endowment to cases where the combined family
ncome, that is the incomes of both parents and of children under fourteen, does not exceed the
living wage. This wage is, at the time of writing this report, £4 5s. per week for 52 weeks, or
£221 per annum. If the family income exceeds the living wage (£221)' the total of that income
is deducted from the amount of the full endowment for each child, £13 per annum plus the amount
of the living wage £221, and the balance is the (reduced) endowment payable. For example,
a claimant having five children, where the family income is £230 would receive £56 a year in respect
of endowment for the five children, made up in this way : —
£
Basic wage .. .. .. .. .. . . .. 221
Plus £13 per annum for each of five children .. .. .. 65
286
Less the amoimt of family income .. .. .. .. 230
Amount payable as (reduced) endowment .. .. 56
This shows that in such a case the endowment of £13 per child would be reduced to about £11.
142. The result can be reached in another way. If the amount by which the family
income exceeds the living wage (£221) is deducted from the amount of the full endowment for the
number of dependent children in the family, the balance, if any, is the amount of endowment
payable. This is necessarily less than the full endowment of £13 per child. Thus, in example
above, where the family income is shown as £230, the excess of that amount above the living
wage (£221) is £9. The full amount of endowment for the five children would be £13 x 5=£65.
Deduct £9 from that sum, and we have again the amount of £56 as the amount of endowment
payable in the case where there are five dependent children. If the income for a family of that
structure were £286, no endowment would be payable.
143. Figures supplied to the Government when forming estimates of the cost of the
scheme, indicated that there were in the State 712,000 children under the age of fourteen years.
144. From this number certain deductions were made as follows: —
Dependent children otherwise provided for or illegitimate .. .. 72,000
Dependent children of Federal employees (who were completely excluded 15.000


Sec. 3. — Child Endowment. — C. New South Wales.
145. The income limitation included in the Bill as introduced was £364, plus any endowment
payable. When the Bill reached the Legislative Council, however, an amendment was carried
reducing that income limitation to £221 (the amount of the basic wage) plus any endowment
payable.
146. In connection with the original limit of £364, it was estimated that this income limit
would exclude about 12| per cent, of the dependent children who otherwise would be eligible.
147. After making all these deductions the total estimate of dependent children
considered likely to become claimants upon t. endowment fund was about 550,000. The
extent to which this estimate has been affected by the amendment of the Act, reducing the
income limit from £364 to £221, cannot be exactly stated, but evidently, that effect has been
considerable.
148. Experience gained during the first twelve months of the operation of the Act, suggests
that a large proportion of those who were nominally eligible are never likely to come within the
scope of the scheme.
149. Evidence given by Mr. A. T. Treble (the Commissioner administering the Act),
supplemented by later information, shows that up to 30th June, 1928, the number of endowment
claims received was 48,000. Of these, 5,000 were duplicate claims wrongly submitted, or merely
additional to accepted claims ; 7,000 were rejected or withdrawn; 28,000 had been granted,
and 8,000 had not been completely dealt with. The average number of children represented
by each endowment was 2 -6. Mr. Treble expressed the opinion, based on twelve months of
experience, that of the 712,000 children under the age of fourteen years within the State, no
more than 200,000 would be likely to become a charge upon the fund, that is, roughly that only
two-sevenths of all those who, but for the Statutory income limit, might have come within the
scope of the Act will ever become claimants. The chief reason assigned by Mr. Treble for this
remarkable fact was that only a small proportion of the families having dependent children were
receiving incomes low enough to make them eligible as claimants under the Act. That opinion
is supported by the information relating to coal miners and others in paragraph 487.
150. A minor cause stated by Mr. Treble as operating in the same direction is a
disinclination of some parents to apply for the benefits of any scheme of Government assistance.
151. On Mr. Treble’s estimate of the maximum number of children likely to become a
charge on the fund, the approximate maximum expenditure under the Act, apart from the gradual
increase due to increase of population, would be about £2,600,000 per annum. If further
experience proves the approximate accuracy of Mr. Treble’s view, and assuming (what is roughly
true) that the population of New South Wales is 40 per cent, of that of the Commonwealth, it
would appear that a Commonwealth Child Endowment scheme, subject to the New South Wales
income limitation, and providing the present New South Wales rate of benefit, 5s. per week per
child, could be established at a cost, at least in the earlier years of about £6,500,000 per annum.
152. The New South Wales experience as to the actual expenditure necessary for financing
such a scheme, as compared with what appeared to be necessary on the statistical figures relating
to the number of dependent children, corresponds approximately with the experience of New
Zealand, where the actual cost of the scheme for the first year was £45,000 as against the estimated
cost of £250,000. In any such scheme, it is no doubt true that a great many people, who are
eligible as claimants, fail to make claims in the early stages of administration, partly through
complete ignorance, or through imperfect information as to their rights ; partly through
disinclination to comply with the detailed requirements of the administration ; and partly for
other reasons, such as the desire to maintain their complete independence of assistance from the
State.
153. The New South Wales and New Zealand figures show the difficulty of ascertaining
beforehand the cost of any such schemes, and the probability that estimates made before
administrative experience has been gained will be in excess of the reality. It has yet to be learned
to what extent the applications made during the first year’s operation can be accepted as
accurately defining the limits of charge upon revenue which may finally be made in respect of
any such scheme, apart altogether from any increase which may be made in the rate of benefit.
154. A complete analysis of the information in the possession of the New South Wales
Commissioner for Child Endowment would be valuable. We should have liked to obtain such an
analysis, but after consultation with Mr. Treble, we were satisfied that it could not be prepared
within the time at our disposal.


CHILD ENDOWMENT OR FAMILY ALLOWANCES—EXISTING SYSTEMS.
D. CHILD ENDOWMENT IN THE COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC SERVICE.
155. For a number of years there has existed in the Commonwealth Public Service a
scheme of Child Endowment which differs in important respects from the New South Wales
scheme. The history and operation of the Commonwealth scheme were described to us by
Mr. Atlee Arthur Hunt, C.M.G., Commonwealth Public Service Arbitrator.
156. Shortly after the report of the Basic Wage Commission of 1920 had been considered
by the Government, a speech on the subject was made in the House of Representatives by the
then Prime Minister, the Right Honorable W. M. Hughes, and a resolution was passed to the effect
that it be an instruction to the Government to take into consideration the wages of public servants,
and to do something to improve them. On that the Government announced an allround increase
of pay of £l2 per annum within the Public Service, and also a child allowance of ss. per week
for each dependent child of employees in the service.
157. In December, 1920, a Regulation was issued under the Public Service Act, which
provided for each married officer in the Commonwealth Public Service, whose salary did not
exceed £3OO, a sum of £l3 per annum in respect of each dependent child under the age of 14 years.
A proviso was included under which this payment of £l3 per annum was to be reduced by £l
for every £l6 by which the rate of salary exceeds £3OO per annum. By an amending regulation
of 20th January, 1921, the scheme was made more liberal by fixing £SOO as the limit which any
officer should receive including both salary and endowment. For example, an officer whose
salary was £487 per annum and who had one dependent child would receive the full endowment
of £l3 per annum in respect of that child, bringing his salary up to £SOO. If, however, in the
same family another child were born, no further endowment would be payable under the
Regulation limit. By an amending Statutory Rule of Ist August, 1921, while the allowance
of £l3 per annum, and the salary plus endowment limit of £SOO were left unchanged, an
amendment was made which admitted of payment to female officers having the relation of mother
or step-mother to dependent children, and also, in the case of male officers, rendered a step-father
eligible as well as a father.
158. The rate of payment by way of endowment, namely ss. per week or £l3 per'annum,
has remained unchanged. At the beginning, and for some time subsequently, this payment was
directly an addition to existing rates of pay. In 1923, the Arbitrator dealt with a claim by the
Australian Postal Electricians Union for anew scale of salaries. In connection with that claim
the union asked that all allowances except the child endowment allowance, should be merged
in salaries, and the Arbitrator acceded to that request. The action taken by the Arbitrator
in the matter is described by him as follows :
“ I had then to consider the fixation of the basic wage. I took the Harvester
Wage as fixed in 1907, and brought it up-to-date by the application of the Statistician’s
index numbers. That gave the result of £205 Bs. I discussed the position as follows :
“ If then, £205 Bs. would be a fair basic wage outside, if wages were now
as formerly claimed calculated on yearly figures, how far is it applicable to the
Service ? What is the basic wage intended to cover ? It was originally
stated that it was intended to provide for a household of about five persons ;
that has come to mean a man, his wife, and three children. Neither inside
nor outside the Service is the average family three children, and it would be
more correct to say that nowadays the basic wage is intended to cover the
requirements of the average household. In New South Wales the basic wage
is nominally to provide for a man, wife, and two children, but the difference
between the basic wage as laid down by the New South Wales Board of Trade
and those where the three children are nominally allowed for is not marked.
Under the system which I am asking Parliament to endorse, it is proposed
that a separate payment shall be made for children, and it would, therefore,
be unjust to include any payment for children in the basic wage on which to
calculate service rates of pay.
Now the question is what amount should be deducted from the basic
wage to get such a fair sum as will provide a definite foundation on which to
build up a scheme of salaries for the Service ?


Sec. 3.— Child Endowment. — D. Commonwealth Public Service.
It was stated in the course of this case that the average number of
children under fourteen years was in proportion to adult males . 7 only. That
is the figure obtainable by taking the total numbers of adult males and of
children under fourteen in the whole Commonwealth. I am informed that
taking the number of adult males in the Service and the number of children
in respect of whom child endowment is paid, the figure will be .84. The
number of adult males includes a comparatively small number of men receiving
salaries of over £500 per annum who draw no child allowance. In most cases,
these are men of mature age whose families will have passed the fourteen-year
limit. On the whole it may be taken that. 84 fairly represents the proportion
of children per adult male in the Service. Is it not fair, therefore, merely
to deduct the sum represented by .84 of the Government allowance for
children and regard the balance as the proper amount payable to an adult
male. The rate of the allowance is £13 per annum ; the actual cost of
maintenance of a child may be and probably is higher, but I think it fair to
make a deduction only of the amount that will be received if there are children.
.84 of £13 is £10 18s., and deducting that from £205 8s. gives £194 10s., say,
for purposes of convenience, £195, as a first foundation on which to build.
Salaries were then fixed with £195 per annum as the basic wage in the Public
Service.”
159. It will be observed that the Arbitrator’s determination above described introduced
an important change of principle in connexion with the payment of child endowment in the
Commonwealth Public Service. Up to that time, the endowment had been a bounty granted by
the Government, but from that time onwards the whole amount necessary to provide the
regulation payment of 5s. per week for each dependent child under fourteen was drawn from a
fund made up by a deduction of about £11 per annum from the salary of every officer, married
or unmarried. Consequently, as the Arbitrator informs us, “ the Government pays precisely
the same with the allowance as they would pay without the allowance ; the only difference is
that the amount which the Government pays is distributed differently.”
160. When in 1923, the Arbitrator, as above shown, had to consider the fixation of the
basic wage, he was not concerned with the family unit which that wage was supposed to represent.
In evidence before the Commission he said : —
(Q. 11955). —“ Therefore, the unit which you have employed is more than a
man and wife, but is less than a man, wife, and one child ? —You can put it that way,
but I prefer to put it the way I have already explained, that I adopted as the basis
wage the general wage which was current outside, irrespective of its foundation.”
(Q. 11956). —“ You ignored the foundation ? —Yes.”
(Q. 11908) —“ When you took the action you describe on page 5 of your
statement you were determining a basic wage, but you did not take single men directly
as the unit ? —No. I wanted to put them as nearly as I could on the same basis as the
men outside, and therefore, I took the wage which was current outside, excepting the
3s.*, which I have never regarded as justifiable on any grounds.”
161. Mr Hunt informed the Commission that the scheme of endowment in the Public
Service has worked satisfactorily and that the rate, 5s. per week, appears to have been accepted
by the Service Unions as a reasonable compromise.
162. Questioned as to the economic and social effects of this scheme of Endowment within
the Public Service, Mr. Hunt said : —
“ As to the economic effect, the position is that since the adoption in 1923
of the method described in paragraph IX., the cost to the country has been practically
nothing. The general scale of wages has been reduced by an amount which suffices
to pay the cost of the allowance. If the allowance were now to be withdrawn, the
basic wage of the Service would have to be brought up at least to the level of the basic
wage outside the Service, less the 3s. weekly which for some years has been added by the
Arbitration Court to the Harvester Wage equivalent. That is a contention which could
not be opposed. With the allowance, those whose needs are greatest, i.e., the public
servants on low or comparatively low salaries, receive more than those whose needs
are less, without this allowance those men would suffer hardship.”
* This 3s. is an amount added to the Basic Wage by Mr. Justice Powers in 1921, ostensibly to compensate the wage-earners
for the “ lag ” which was said to occur between the date of operation of increased prices and the date upon which the increase in wage,
based upon a higher price-index-number, comes into operation.
F.24/28. —3


Sec. 3. — Child Endowment. — D. Commonwealth Public Service.
163. “ As to the social effect ; it is not easy to express this in precise terms. For the
past six years it has been my duty to see public servants of all grades at their work in addition
to hearing the evidence and arguments that have been addressed to me in court and at conferences.
During the earlier portion of that period it was my frequent custom to ask men when talking
to them about their jobs what their views were in regard to the allowance and found that there
was an almost universal opinion in its favour. At times some of the younger men thought it
rather hard that they should receive less than others doing the same work merely because the latter
had families, but that view was not expressed with any special vigor, as it always seemed to be
modified by the possibility that some day they might find themselves in the same position as
the others mentioned. For the last few years I have made no inquiries as all parties seemed to
regard the matter as permanently settled.”
“ My last public utterance on the subject was made in 1926 (Vol. 6, page 330), when I said: —
* There is no doubt, as I have frequently stated, that experience has proved that this innovation
has been of great benefit, particularly to men on humble salaries who have many children.’ ”
164. In many respects the institution and continuance of a system of Child Endowment
in a large Public Service presents few difficulties as compared with an application of the same
idea to organized industry outside the service. The unity of management, continuity of
employment, and other special conditions which apply to the Commonwealth Public Service,
remove many of the difficulties which might arise in the application of the system to enormously
greater numbers of employees, owing service to a great many different employers.
165. In making determinations of the basic wage, the Arbitrator, as already shown above,
has been guided chiefly by the current rates awarded by Arbitration Courts, and applying outside
the Public Service. From the basic wage determined by the Arbitrator, he deducts a sum per
annum per employee sufficient to provide endowment at the rate of £13 per annum for each
dependent child. At the highest point yet reached that deduction represents something less than
5s. per week per employee.*
166. This method of treatment is essentially different from the proposal made to us by
many witnesses that the wage of the single man should be determined by deducting from the
present basic wage the amount considered to represent the proportion of child allowance (full
maintenance) which it includes, for two, or as in Federal and some State awards, for three children.
The deduction which would be made upon that basis would at present be much greater than
that made by the Public Service Arbitrator. The deduction made by the Arbitrator provides
funds for an endowment which does not purport to provide the full maintenance cost of a child.
On the evidence brought before us, that endowment represents about 60 per cent, of full
maintenance where there is only one child. The cost per child diminishes as the number increases.
167. It is of high importance to observe that a scheme of child endowment possessing the
following features has been successfully established, and is working without friction
(1) The fund from which the endowment is paid is provided by an all-round flat-rate
deduction from wages and salaries.
(2) Neither the employer (in this case the Commonwealth Government) nor the
general taxpayer is required to contribute anything to the fund.
(3) The benefits of the fund are distributable only among a section of those who.
contribute. (Contributors having more than one dependent child derive
benefits in excess of their contributions.)
SECTION 4.
INTER-RELATION OF WAGE FIXATION AND CHILD ENDOWMENT.
168. We are required to consider systems of child endowment in relation to wage fixation ;
we have felt compelled to consider systems of wage fixation in relation to child endowment.
This has meant examination of industrial Statutes of the Commonwealth and of the States. It
also involved a study of Industrial Judgments. Some of these judgments enunciate principles ;
some describe methods ; some set in high refief defects of practice, difficulties of interpretation,
conflicts of jurisdiction.
* Unless —
(а) the rate of endowment were raised, or
(б) the percentage of children per adult male rose considerably,
this amount could not be exceeded.


Sec. 4. — Inter-relation of Wage Fixation and Child Endowment.
169. The imprecision and nebulousness of Parliamentary directions to Industrial Tribunals
leave Industrial Judges moving continually through areas of cloud and low visibility. In the
Statutes, much imperfectly implicit as to child endowment, little perfectly explicit. The
general impression is one of vagueness. Even skilled interpreters are often in doubt; the
indications are. faint, like the shadows in a skiagram. Rare the sharp outline, product of
micrometric focussing and crystal clarity of thought.
170. A review of Commonwealth and State industrial legislation and practice, and of
underlying principles, is long overdue.
171. Such examination should be carried out with the object of evolving a uniform system
which is simpler, less expensive, and more clearly defined than the present medley of systems.
This, of course, is on the assumption that the continuation of a system or systems of wage fixation
is desirable, a question outside the terms of reference, and on which we, therefore, express no
opinion. So far as we are aware, no authority has attempted to present a complete statement
either of principles or methods.
172. The phrase used by several witnesses that “ wage fixation is an industrial matter and
child endowment a social obligation,” though open to criticism, is useful so far as it suggests
the necessity (if child endowment be adopted) of keeping the two subjects apart in thought and
in practice.
173. In our systems of wage regulation (apart from recent New South Wales legislation)
the two have been blended into one, every basic wage containing elements of endowment, though
these elements have not been separately and accurately evaluated.
174. Industrial tribunals, in prescribing wages, have hitherto found it convenient, whatever
family structure is assumed, to consider the family as an entity, and to provide a family wage.
This mode of dealing with the subject maintained, if it did not create, the view that there is a
chemical affinity between wage and endowment. It is now seen that the combination is a
mechanical mixture, and not a chemical union.
175. If child endowment be set up as the discharge of a “ social obligation ” of the
Commonwealth, wages should be stripped of endowment elements, and well-considered safeguards
be devised to keep separate the factors which so many people are interested in bringing together.
To use a colloquialism, many people are interested in “ having it both ways.” They wish to retain
as an “ industrial matter ” all the endowment content of the present wage, and add a whole
scheme of endowment, designated as “ the discharge of a social obligation.” Unless guided and
restrained by very clear Statutory declarations, wage-fixing tribunals may, more or less
consciously, aid in the effectuation of that purpose.
SECTION 5.
INDUSTRIAL LEGISLATION AND PRACTICE OF ARBITRATION TRIBUNALS.
A.—COMMONWEALTH.
176. The powers of the Commonwealth Parliament in respect to industrial Arbitration
are contained in Section 51 (xxxv). Power is given to make laws for the peace, order and good
government of the Commonwealth with respect to “ conciliation and arbitration for the
prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State.”
177. Pursuant to this power, the Commonwealth Parliament has established the
Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. For the present purposes, the aspect
of importance is the power of that Court to fix a basic wage to operate in those industries which
become the subjects of awards of the Court.
178. From the evidence, it would appear that the awards of the Commonwealth Court
govern the wages and conditions of about 50 per cent, of the employees who are subject to awards
of any tribunals.
179. Unlike the Statutes creating State Industrial Tribunals, the Commonwealth
Arbitration Act makes no express provision for the fixation of a basic wage. Nor does it indicate
the family unit to be adopted, or the standard of living on which the basic wage is to be founded.
In practice, the Court, in the exercise of its jurisdiction to settle industrial disputes, declares a
basic wage for the industries with which it deals. As a subject of that wage the Court has selected
a man of “ the humblest class ” or “ unskilled worker ”. The established practice of the Court
is to consider the family unit as consisting of a man, wife, and three children. The “ standard


Sec. 5. — Industrial Legislation and Practice of Arbitration Tribunals. — A. Commonwealth.
of living ” adopted by the Court is “ the normal needs of the average employee (the unskilled
worker) regarded as a human being in a civilized community,” the wage being sufficient to provide
“ food “ shelter ”, and “ clothing ” “ and a condition of frugal comfort estimated by current
human standards.” (2 C.A.R., page 3-4.)
INDUSTRIAL LEGISLATION AND PRACTICE OF ARBITRATION TRIBUNALS.
B.—NEW SOUTH WALES.
180. New South Wales was the first State in which legislation was enacted to constitute
a Tribunal to deal with the fixation of wages and industrial conditions generally. Partly for that
reason, and partly because of the special manner in which both legislation and judicial methods
have developed, it seems to us desirable to trace the course of events in that State. During the
last two years especially, the introduction of a system of Child Endowment; the statutory
prescription of a family unit of man and wife only ; and subsequent action by the Industrial
Tribunal, have created a situation so different in important respects from that existing in other
States as, in our opinion, to justify a relatively detailed examination.
181. The original New South Wales Arbitration Act of 1901, which established the first
Court, dealt only with the actual settlement of industrial disputes. The Court, entering an
entirely experimental field, was left to evolve its own principles; as the basic wage, the Court
adopted the average wage paid by reputable employers.
182. An Act passed in 1908 transferred the regulation of industrial conditions from the
Court to Boards (though the Court was retained as an appellate body), and every well-defined
industry secured a special tribunal to deal with its conditions. These Boards were composed of
representatives of employers and of employees. As a rule each Board had a different Chairman.
As the Boards acted on different principles in arriving at minimum wages, confusion and
overlapping occurred.
183. The Court then instituted a search for some general principle for the guidance of the
Boards and their Chairmen. It finally arrived at the conclusion that the basic wage of all
industries must bear relation, not to existing average standards, but to the actual needs of the
workers.
184. On the 16th February, 1914, Mr. Justice Heydon, in the first judgment following
a general inquiry into the cost of living, accepted the decision of Mr. Justice Higgins in the 1907
Harvester Judgment, that the standard should be “ the normal needs of the average employee
regarded as a human being in a civilized community ”, and that the average employee must be
regarded as carrying the responsibilities of an average dependent family. .Accepting this class
as between the ages of 20 and 59, the average family was fixed as comprising a man, wife, and
two children. A basic wage of £2 8s. per week was declared.
185. Mr. Justice Heydon further indicated that the main element for consideration in
future applications should be fluctuations in the cost of living.
186. These principles were applied until 1918. In that year, by an amendment of the
Industrial Arbitration Act which become operative on the 22nd March, 1918, the Industrial
Court was superseded, and a new tribunal called the Board of Trade was created. This Board
was given power to declare from year to year the living wage to be paid to adult male employees,
and to adult female employees. Special provision was made for separate inquiry and declaration
in respect of workers in rural occupations.
187. On the 5th September, 1918, the Board held its first public inquiry. At the request
of the Board the representatives of the parties went beyond the mere inquiry into the rise or
fall of the cost of living, and placed before the Board their respective views as to the amount
of the living wage for adult males. The Board found that the living wage should be £2 18s. 6d.
(a rise of 3s.) but thinking that “ under the very special circumstances of the present time ” and
for the present time only, something might be done for the lowest paid class of workers, added
Is. 6d. per week, and fixed the living wage at £3.
188. On the 8th October, 1919, the Board made its living wage declaration-for that year.
The Board stated the construction it placed upon Section 79, the section enacted in 1918, as to
public inquiry into the cost of living. The Board held—
(a) that the public inquiry directed as to the cost of living, referred to the system for
ascertaining the living wage established by the judgment of the 16th February,
1914, and “ which system had the force of law ” ; and
(b) that the Statute imposed upon the Board the duty of carrying out the principles
underlying that judgment.


Sec. 5. —Industrial Legislation and Practice of Arbitration Tribunals. — B. New South Wales.
189. The Board re-stated (and re-affirmed) those principles in the following terms: —*
(1) The average cost of living should be calculated upon the basis of the average
responsibilities of the lowest paid class of workers.
(2) This calculation should be made upon the requirements of a family of husband
and wife and the average number of dependent children in the families of the
said class.
(3) The standard of living should be such as to provide a worker, of the said class
and his said dependent family with the normal requirements of a member of
a civilized community.
190. In accordance with the above construction of the Statutory direction, the Board
held the public inquiry required by Section 79, and fixed the living wage at £3 17s., an increase
of 17s.
191. Representatives of employees contended that the dependent family should be taken
at the Commonwealth Arbitration Court basis of three children, instead of the New South Wales
basis of two children. Having made a statistical inquiry, the Board refused to follow the practice
of the Commonwealth Court.
192. The Board of Trade in its declaration of 8th October, 1921, which lowered the 1920
living wage of £4 5s. to £4 2s., said : —“ The maintenance of a standard for those who are fortunate
enough, in a general state of economic disturbance, to get wages, is not the public purpose for
which the Board was appointed. The maintenance of a standard relative to a general
equilibrium of industrial and economic relations is rather the Board’s business, and the intention
of Parliament.”
193. It was suggested to the Board that its declaration should be based on the needs of a
male adult worker, taking into consideration his family obligations, if any.
194. The Board adhered to the family basis on the ground that “ there seems little doubt
that the legislature entrusted the Board with the duty of fixing the general living wage on the
assumption that the well-established principle would continue.”
195. On 24th August, 1925, after re-adjusting the method of calculating the rent item
and allowing a higher sum for rent, the Board fixed the living wage for the family unit of four
at £4 4s.
ESTABLISHMENT OF INDUSTRIAL COMMISSION.
Direction to Declare a Standard of Living.
196. In 1926 the Industrial Law was further amended. The Board of Trade was abolished
and a new tribunal set up called the Industrial Commission.
197. The Commission was composed of the Industrial Commissioner, four representatives
of employers and four representatives of employees.
198. By the 1926 Amendment, Section 79 (1) of the Act of 1918 was repealed, and the
following Section 7, sub-section (1) (b) substituted : —
“ The powers and functions of the Commission shall include the following : —
(6) Not more frequently than once in every six months to determine a standard
of living , and to declare what shall, for the purpose of this Act and the
Principal Act, be the living wages based upon such standard for adult
male and adult female employees in the State. ’
199. The Industrial Commission made its first report on the 15th December, 1926.
200. That Commission had, on the 29th October, 1926, decided that only one living wage
could be declared for the whole of the State. This decision was important, as the evidence
disclosed a substantial difference in cost, in various items, between country and metropolitan
areas.
201. The Commission pointed out that the powers and functions conferred on it represented
a new departure in the duty prescribed by Parliament, and that no “ definite mandate ” from the
legislature had been hitherto given to the Commonwealth Court, or to any of the State
Arbitration or wage-fixing tribunals, “ to determine expressly a standard of living.” It also
pointed out that “ various Arbitration authorities, including the Commonwealth Arbitration
Court, have from time to time announced what they considered the cost of living to be for families
of a defined structure, but without any fully itemised finding of the constituents going to make
up a standard of living.”
*ln October, 1921, the Board again re-stated those principles with slight changes. The term “ unskilled ” was used in place
of “ lowest paid,” and the number of children to be provided for (two) was definitely stated.


k sec. 5. —Industrial Legislation and Practice of Arbitration Tribunals. — B. New South Wales.
202. It appears to us that the Statute made no real change in the existing system.
203. The wage-fixing tribunals of New South Wales (since 1918) Queensland, South
Australia, and Western Australia, under the construction placed upon the Statutes prescribing
their respective duties, or by the practice they have established, could have exercised, if they
had thought fit, powers as wide as the powers conferred by Section 7 sub-section (1) (b).
204. The Commonwealth Court assumed similar powers, when it adopted the Harvester
judgment as a rule to be followed in framing its awards.
205. The findings of the Industrial Commission on the determination of the standard of
living seem to us to have such an important bearing on the question of Family Endowment, as to
justify the insertion of a short account of them here.
206. Up to the 15th December, 1926, New South Wales tribunals had continued to accept
a family unit of man, wife, and two children. The Industrial Commission, however, took
evidence and made its finding on the basis of man, wife, and three children. No reason was given
for changing from the four-unit family to the five unit, other than the following : —
“ In order to determine a standard of living, it is essential that some hypothetical
structure of family be taken as a basis for evidence, though it does not matter what
selection is made, because by known statistical methods the cost of providing the standard
of living once ascertained for domestic unit or family of one structure can be converted
into the cost necessary for any other domestic unit.”
207. It was also said that the fact of evidence having been directed to the cost of living of
a family of five, did not necessarily involve the declaration of the basic wage as for that unit.
208. The Commissioner first dealt with the contention of the employers, that the family
unit of four, which had been laid down in 1914 and continued ever since, should be adhered to, and
pointed out that with that unit the employers in New South Wales would be compelled to pay
for 488,000 non-existent children, but that 288,000 existent children would be inadequately
provided for.
209. The Commissioner then dealt with the contention of the employees, who had again
claimed the adoption of a new family unit of five, and pointed out that with that unit the
employers would be compelled to pay for 973,000 non-existent children, while 183,000 existent
children would be inadequately provided for.
210. With regard to the Statement of the Industrial Commissioner that “ It does not
matter what selection is made of the hypothetical structure of family to be taken as a basis,” we
suggest that at least on the rent item, it makes a considerable difference. For example the Board
of Trade in its Declaration of 7th September, 1923, had expressly, declared that its “ standard
of shelter ” for a four-unit family was a four-roomed house, but the Industrial Commissioner
stated that “ on the hypothesis of a family of five, four rooms and a kitchen is the minimum
that can be accepted according to Australian standard of reasonable comfort in respect of housing.”
211. As a consequence of discarding the four-roomed standard and adopting a five-roomed
standard, the rent item in the standard of living was increased from £l 0s. lOd. to £l 8s., or by
7s. 2d. per week.
212. The housing standard was declared to be “ a five-roomed house in sound tenantable
condition, not actually cramped as to allotment, situated in decent surroundings and provided
with bath, copper and fixed tubs.”
213. The Industrial Commission, in fixing the standard of comfort, worked on the cost
of living in the metropolitan area alone, and discarded from consideration uncontradicted evidence
that the cost of living was lower in the rural portions of the State, notwithstanding that their
determination of the standard of living was applicable throughout the whole State.
214. The representatives of employers claimed that the previously accepted unit of husband,
wife, and two children should be adopted ; that some allowance should be made for lower cost
of living in rural portions of the State, and that the determination of the standard of living, afid
the declaration of what should be the living wage, based on such standard, were parts of one task,
and did not impose two separate and distinct duties.
215. The representatives of employees apparently agreed that only one duty was imposed
on the Commission, but, accepting a five-unit family, they claimed that an adequate standard
of living could not be provided on a wage less than £6 10s.


Sec. 5. —Industrial Legislation and Practice of Arbitration Tribunals. — B. New South Wales.
216. The Industrial Commissioner determined the “ standard of living ” for a hypothetical
domestic unit of five persons at £5 6s.*
217. In dealing with the amount of the living wage the Commissioner said “ It is
thus evident that a change over must be made from the present system of a flat-rate living wage
on a fictitious domestic unit, to a flat-rate living wage coupled with separate and elastic provision
for real family life.” Without referring to any definite family unit, he then stated that, regarding
the present position as transitional, he declared the living wage “ at its then present figure of
£4 4s., which will as it happens provide the standard of living for a man, wife, and one child.”
218. The Industrial Commissioner coupled with that determination his “ recorded decision
that early legislation by the State Parliament is imperative to secure family allowances. ”f
219. The Commissioner proceeded to indicate a specimen family income scheme. A
schedule exhibiting that scheme showed a “ uniform living wage paid by employers to all adult
male employees, single or married, with children or without ”, of £4 4s. and an assumed addition
of endowment at the rate of 6s. per week for each dependent child. A note appended to the
schedule reads as follows : —
“ It is not suggested that the amount of 6s. per week is enough for the full support
of a child, but the schedule as a whole has to be considered .”
220. The Commissioner in setting out that schedule said : —“ It is distinctly understood
that it is not put forward as a proposal J but as a specimen.”
221. The note above quoted is significant in the light of the fact that the starting point
of the illustration, viz., the “ uniform living wage of £4 4s to all adult male
employees, single or married, with children or without ”, was 6d. higher than the amount which,
if the practice of the previous twelve years had been followed, would have had to be fixed for a
man, wife, and two children. In other words, the £4 4s. really included : —
(a) a sufficient sum of money to provide for the comfort of two children, on the basis
of the 1925 living wage declaration, or
(b) the sum of 11s., being the amount included for one child in the new standard of
comfort determined by the Commission in the present judgment.
222. The employers’ representatives claimed that the living wage should be declared at
£3 19s. The employees’ representatives claimed that it should be £6 10s., but the Industrial
Commissioner declared the living wage at the same sum, £4 4s., as in 1925, and this became the
declaration of the Commission.
223. The position of the 1926 Judgment was that the Commissioner had determined that
the amount necessary to provide the proper standard of comfort for a man, wife, and three
children was £5.6s. He then declared the living wage at £4 4s., which sum he stated would provide
that standard for a man, wife and one child. The difference between those two sums was, therefore,
due to the fact that the £5 6s. related to a five-unit family and the £4 4s. to a three-unit family,
or to analyse the position still further, the £5 6s. standard of living was made up of £3 13s. for the
man and wife, and 11s. each, or £l 13s. in all, for the three children.
224. An increase of the living wage from £4 4s. per week to £5 6s. would have imposed
upon employers an increase in their wages bill, for 475,000 adult male employees, of about
£27,000,000 per annum, also a large additional sum in respect of adult female employees and
juniors of both sexes.
225. On the other hand, had the Commission (without making any alteration in the rent
item) adapted the £5 6s. standard of living to a four-unit instead of a five-unit family, the result
would have been to increase wages cost by £13,500,000, plus the large addition in respect of adult
female employees, and juniors of both sexes.
226. The mere statement of the above figures makes it reasonably certain that the all-
important factor of capacity to pay was one of the reasons, if not the only reason, which barred
the way to a declaration of £5 6s. as the living wage.
* This standard is higher than that of the finding of the Basic Wage Commission 1920, which was then declared to be beyond
the productive capacity of the country to pay. The 1920 finding, reduced in accordance with the cost of living figures, was at the date
of the 1926 judgment equivalent to £5 Is. 6d.
•f The Family Endowment Act passed shortly afterwards provided for the payment of ss. per week for each dependent child, but
subject to an income limit.
+ Notwithstanding the definite pronouncement that the above-mentioned schedule was “ not a proposal ” but an illustrative
specimen of a hypothetical family endowment scheme, it was treated by the Commissioner himself, only six months later, as an actual
decision. He said in his declaration of the 27th June, 1927 “ The schedule headed in the first column ‘ Uniform Living
Wage ’ .... £4 4s. amounted to determining the living wage at £4 4s. on a standard of living appropriate to any male adult employee
apart from any question cf children. In that sense the judgment raised»the standard of living, for it allocated to a smaller domestic unit
the same amount of wage which would have been allocated to the larger domestic unit of the Board of Trade at that Board's standard.”


Sec. 5. — Industrial Legislation and Practice of Arbitration Tribunals. — B. New South Wales.
227. The Industrial Commissioner, in referring, in his 1927 determination, to the 1926
declaration, said:—
“ Assuming that the Commission had in December last adhered to the standard
of living of the Board of Trade, and had also adhered to the domestic unit of the Board
of Trade (a man, wife, and two children, which had been formerly established for twelve
years), the actual wage that must have been declared in December, 1926, would have been
£4 3s. 9d ”
228. The Industrial Commissioner might have added that, eliminating one of the two
children from the family unit (as he claimed power to do), the actual wage that must have been
declared for a man, wife, and one child, on the hitherto accepted standard of living, would have
been £4 3s. 9d., less cost of one child 11/-, (see para. 221) that is £3 12s. 9d.
229. Child Endowment legislation and change of family unit for basic wage— In the
interval between the date (16th December, 1926, on which the standard of living was determined
at £5 6s., and the living wage declared at £4 4s.), and the meeting of the Industrial Commission
(27th June, 1927), to declare and determine the 1927 standard of living and living wage, the New
South Wales Legislature passed three new Acts dealing with the subjects under review.
Their short titles are respectively : —
The Industrial Arbitration {Living Wage Declaration ) Act 1927.
The Family Endowment Act 1927.
The Finance {Family Endowment Tax) Act October 1927.
230. The Industrial Arbitration {Living Wage Declaration) Act April 1927, Section 2 —
(1) Any declaration of a living wage for male adult employees made on or after the
fifteenth day of June, One thousand nine hundred and twenty-seven shall
be in accordance with the provisions of this Act, but any determination of a
standard of living made on or after that date shall be in accordance with the
provisions of Section 7 of the Industrial Arbitration {Amendment) Act 1926.
(2) In any declaration of a living wage for adult male employees, such living wage
shall be based upon a standard of living in accordance with the provision of
Section 7 of the Industrial Arbitration {Amendment) Act 1926, and on the
requirements of a man and wife without children.
231. By sub-section (3) of Section 2 the Commission was enjoined to declare afresh between
15th June and 30th September, 1927, the living wage for male workers. Thereafter the provisions
of Section 7 as to date applied, viz., that the living wage is not to be declared more frequently
than once in every six months.
232. An important change effected by the 1927 Act permitted the making of a declaration
of a separate living wage for rural employees, or any section thereof.
233. The Industrial Commissioner pointed out that the most important change effected
by this Act was that up to the date of its passing “ the legislation in New South Wales upon living
wages had not prescribed any domestic unit, nor indeed had there been any definition of the
contents of a living wage.”
234. It appears to us, however, that a family unit consisting of husband, wife, and two
children had been consistently accepted by the wage-fixing tribunals in New South Wales from
1914 to the passing of the Act of 1926. And though no definition of the contents of the living
wage had been prescribed by legislation, Mr. Justice Heydon, in his 1914 judgment, had accepted
as the standard to be declared, such a sum as would be necessary to provide for “ the normal
needs of the average employee regarded as a human being in a civilized community.”
235. Following this new legislation the Industrial Commissioner, although in December,
1926, he had found that £4 4s. provided the necessary standard of comfort for a man, wife, and
one child, and although he found that the cost of living had only risen lOd. per week, declared
the living wage at £4 5s. for the new statutory unit of man and wife without children.
236. The employers’ representatives claimed that on the Industrial Commissioner’s own
judgment in 1926,11s. for one child, at least, should be deducted. This reasoning appears to us
to be sound.
237. The employees’ representatives were in favour of declaring a living wage of £4 17s.
238. Under the circumstances (in view of the conflicting opinions of the representatives),
the judgment’of the Industrial Commissioner, as provided by the Act, became the judgment of
the Commission.


Sec. 5. — Industrial Legislation and Practice of Arbitration Tribunals. — B. New South Wales.
239. The 1927 Act by express words substituted the new unit of man and wife for the
theretofore judicially accepted unit for New South Wales of man, wife, and two children.
240. Industrial Arbitration (Amendment) Act 1927.—The above Act altered the
Constitution of the Industrial Commission by omitting representatives of employers and
employees, and providing for the appointment of three members, one of whom was, by his
commission, to be appointed President. Each member must possess legal qualifications. The
Act conferred upon each member the same rank, title, status, &c., as a Puisne Judge of the
Supreme Court.
241. Pursuant to the Act, Piddington, J., was appointed President, his colleagues being
Street, J., and Cantor, J.
242. The Act also provided that the decision of the majority should be the decision of the
Commission.
243. Since the foregoing resume of New South Wales industrial legislation and practice
was written, we have perused the individual judgments of the Commission delivered on the
25th September, 1928, a pronouncement by the full Bench on the same date, and statements
made by the members of the Commission on the 5th November, 1928.
244. The judgments were delivered upon an application based on the ground that the
declaration of living wage made in June, 1927 (see paragraph 235), “ was based upon wrong
principles and was not made in accordance with the directions contained in the Statute, and
that, therefore, this Commission should re-consider the whole position,and hold a fresh inquiry ”.
245. The actual questions of law argued were apparently accepted as submitted by Mr.
Flannery, K.C., as follows : —
“ That the duty of the Commission in declaring a living wage for rural employees
should be discharged by the Commission determining upon a standard of living in
accordance with the provisions of Section 7 of the Industrial Arbitration (. Amendment )
Act 1926, and having determined upon such standard of living by fixing the requirements
of a man and wife without children, which would secure the attainment of such standard
of living for them, and by declaring thereupon a living wage adequate to such
requirements.”
246. As a result of the argument, the Industrial Commission was divided in opinion,
Piddington, J., adhering to his 1927 Living Wage Judgment. On the other hand, Street, J., and
Cantor, J., arrived at a conclusion which is clearly stated in the following quotation from the
judgment of Cantor, J. : —
“It is plain that His Honour, and in my opinion without any justification,
departed entirely from the principles laid down in the Judgment of June, 1926, which
I have already quoted, and in determining the standard of living, and fixing the living
wage, adopted methods which had already been condemned by the Federal Royal
Commission on the Basic Wage, and which, with every respect, were in my mind,
fundamentally wrong ”.
247. On another point, the learned Judges constituting the majority apparently agreed
with the view expressed by Piddington J., in his 1926 Judgment, that the standard of living
to be determined “ should be one and the same throughout the whole zone of industrial life.”
248. As we have pointed out (paragraphs 303 and 376) this apparently involves the
discarding of the “humblest class of worker” or “the lowest paid class of worker” as the
class for which the living wage is to be fixed.
249. It would further appear from the judgment of the majority that the determination
of the standard of living was intended by the Act to be “ entirely independent of the
determination of the cost of providing that standard ”. This, in our opinion, results in an
impossible position.
250. The judgments under review afford a good illustration of the difficulties we foresee
in any scheme involving one tribunal for wage fixation (in New South Wales, the Industrial
Commission) and another tribunal for child endowment (in New South Wales, the Parliament).
251. One such difficulty results from the view expressed in the minority judgment. It
would seem to follow from the majority judgment that on account of children being dissociated
from the fixing of the living wage, a sum of 11s. per week would have to be deducted from the
existing wage. The suggestion by the minority judgment is that as the 11s represents
full cost of maintenance of one child,. and as Parliament has only endowed that child to the
extent of 5s., only 5s. instead of 11s. should be deducted from the living wage. This would still
leave childless adult workers with an allowance of 6s. for a non-existent child.


Sec. 5. — Legislation and Practice of Arbitration Tribunals. — B. New South Wales.
252. Street, J., emphasized in his judgment the fact that “ the Commission is the sole
judge of the extent of its own jurisdiction and powers. There exists no Appellate Court or
Tribunal which oan review a decision of this Commission
253. The above judgments stress the following
(a) the necessity of using definite and clear language in enactments conferring
jurisdiction on industrial tribunals.
(b) the question whether the decisions of industrial tribunals should not be subject
to appeal.
INDUSTRIAL LEGISLATION AND PRACTICE OF ARBITRATION TRIBUNALS.
C.—QUEENSLAND.
254. Prior to 1925 all matters under the Industrial Arbitration Acts were dealt with by
the Court of Industrial Arbitration, but by the amending Act of 1925 such Court was abolished
and a Board of Trade and Arbitration substituted.
255. Section 8 of the Industrial Arbitration Act 1912 (as amended) provided that the
Board of Trade and Arbitration “ may make an award with reference to a calling or callings
(i) Fixing the quantum of work or service to be done, and the lowest prices for their
work or rates of wages payable to employees other than aged or infirm workers:
Provided that in fixing rates of wages in any calling—
(а) The same wage shall be paid to persons of either sex performing the same work or
producing the same return of profit to their employer ;
(б) The Board of Trade and Arbitration shall be entitled to consider the prosperity of
the calling and the value of an employee’s labour to his employer in addition to
the standard of living, but in no case shall a rate of wages be paid which is
ower than the minimum wage declared by the Board of Trade and Arbitration.
256. Section 9, sub-section (3) provides that the Court may from time to time make
declarations as to —
(a) The cost of living ;
(b) The standard of living ;
(c) The minimum rate of wages to be paid to persons of either sex ;
{d) The standard hours :
Provided that—
(i) The minimum wage of an adult male employee shall be not less than is sufficient
to maintain a well-conducted employee of average health , strength , and competence,
and his wife, and a family of three children in a fair and average standard of
comfort having regard to the conditions of living prevailing among employees
in the calling in respect of which such minimum rate is fixed, and provided that
in fixing such minimum wage the earnings of the children and wife of said
employee shall not be taken into account.
(ii) The minimum wage of an adult female employee shall not be less than is sufficient
to enable her to support herself in a fair and average standard of comfort
having regard to the nature of her duties and to the conditions of living
prevailing among female employees in the calling in respect of which suck
minimum wage is fixed.
257. These sections of the Act were considered before the Full Bench of the Court o.
Industrial Arbitration in February, 1921. The Court in considering the sections pointed out
that the terms “ Basic Wage ”, “ Living Wage ” and “ Minimum Wage ” have not always been
used in the same sense, and referred to the New South Wales Living Wage Declaration of 1920
{New South Wales Industrial Gazette, page 620), where the Board of Trade remarked, “ Interested
parties fail to distinguish between the living and the minimum wage. The minimum wage
is fixed by Arbitration Courts after consideration of the general conditions of each industry ;
the living wage fixed by this board controls all industries irrespective of their ability or otherwise
to meet increased labour cost.” The Full Court then continued as follows—“We are asked
to determine ‘ Ihe minimum rate of wages to be paid to persons of either sex ’ ”. If what we
are to determine is the living wage the Court would be required to fix a wage below which no
industry in the State may be permitted to go ”.


Sec. 5, —Industrial Legislation and Practice of Arbitration Tribunals. — C. Queensland.
258. The Court interpreted its powers thus :—
“We think it is permissible to lay down a minimum wage which shall be applicable
in industries of average prosperity ; reserving to the Court the right to fix a lower
minimum in industries which are unable to bear that minimum, and to fix a higher wage
where the prosperity of a calling renders such higher wage proper (Section 8 (i) (b)).
We are aware that in adopting this course we are departing from the generally
recognized custom of Courts of Arbitration, and particularly of the Commonwealth
Arbitration Court. The alternative would be to retain the existing minimum and fix
a higher wage after consideration of the prosperity of each particular industry. This
would involve an examination of the profits or financial position of each industry and
lead to varying minima which would become a source of friction. We think it better
to lay down a wage which shall be the minimum in industries of average prosperity,
avoiding the need for an inquiry into the financial position of a particular industry
unless the employer contends that he cannot pay the wage, or unless the employee
contends that the prosperity of the industry demands a wage still higher ”.
259. The Court then declared the wage at £4 5s. per week, and proceeded as follows :• —
“ This minimum will not be automatically applicable to all industries, but upon application duly
made, the Court will apply it to an industry unless it can be shown that the special circumstances
of the industry justify a lower minimum. In considering whether an industry is sufficiently
prosperous to permit of the adoption of the minimum wage, the Court will take into consideration
all circumstances incidental to the industry, including its freedom from strikes. With regard to
wages well above the minimum, the Court will on each award consider whether they should be
raised to the same extent as the basic rate, or at all
260. It would seem from evidence before this Commission that neither the Court, nor the
Board which took the place of the Court of Industrial Arbitration of Queensland, has ever
exercised the power of declaring a minimum wage conferred by Section 9 (3) (c). From the
same evidence it would also appear to be arguable that the declaration of a minimum wage was
intended by the Legislature to be a condition precedent to the exercise of the power to give effect
to the words “ the minimum wage of an adult male employee shall not be less than is sufficient
to maintain a well conducted employee of average health, strength, and competence, in a fair and
average standard of comfort.” From a consideration of these powers and limitations, it would
also appear that in the absence of any declaration by the Court of a minimum rate of wages,
the Court may have power in its awards to fix rates of wages without any necessary reference
to any particular standard of comfort. But it is certainly clear that, if a declaration is made
by the Court, the minimum fixed must be not less than sufficient to provide the statutory standard
of comfort, and also that no rate of wages may be paid, lower than the declared minimum.
261. The decision of the Full Court'may have been arrived at by construing the proviso
as being such in form only, and as being in substance an evidence of the paramount intention
of the legislature that under no circumstances should less than a minimum wage providing the
statutory standard of comfort be paid to any adult male of average strength and competence.
Or it may be that the Full Bench deduced from Section 8(1) (6), which cuts down the limitation
as to the minimum wage imposed by the proviso to Section 9, that the legislature contemplated
that a declaration of a minimum would precede every award, and to avoid defeating that
anticipation, the Court felt constrained to act as if the declaration had in fact been made. • ( Vide
the statement of the learned President, Q. 2120.)
262. From evidence placed before the Commission it would appear that the Court, in
the exercise from time to time of its functions in dealing with the fixation of the minimum wage,
never made an independent inquiry into what ought to be the statutory standard of comfort.
263. It would further appear that the Court fixed the minimum wage from time to time
“ at a point indicated by the New South Wales basic wage, but never below the ‘ Harvester ’
rate adjusted to date. These two rates apparently marked the limit upwards and downwards
respectively of the Queensland basic rate. Further, as the Queensland basic wage was fixed
only for industries of average prosperity, and a higher or lower wage was paid for industries
conspicuously above or below average prosperity, it followed that the Court also took into account
general capacity to pay.” {ib.)
264. In 1925, as has been pointed out, the Court was abolished and its functions were
transferred to the Board of Trade and Arbitration. The Board has adopted the late Court’
methods without restriction.


Sec. 5. — Industrial Legislation and Practice of Arbitration Tribunals. — C. Queensland.
265. In Olir opinion it follows from the above considerations that the accuracy or otherwise
of the contention that the minimum or basic wage of Queensland (these terms being used inter-
changeably) is sufficient to provide a reasonable standard of comfort for a man and his wife and
three children, rests to some extent on the accuracy or otherwise of the same contention in
relation to the Commonwealth basic wage for Queensland. That wage is fixed on the
Harvester equivalent adjusted to date but without addition of the Powers’ 3s. The
Commonwealth basic wage for Queensland for first quarter 1928 is £3 18s. 6d., but the
Queensland basic wage is £4 5s., which is 6s. 6d. higher than that of the Commonwealth. The
present Board has pointed out in the basic wage judgment ( Government Gazette , 22nd March,
1927) that the late Court “ appears to have felt at liberty to fix the Queensland basic rate at
that point between the Commonwealth basic rate and the New South Wales basic rate, which
was determined by general capacity to pay, and further that the Court was always able to fix
a basic rate well above the ‘ Harvester rate ’, because the cost of living in Queensland throughout
remained comparatively low. Workers on the Queensland basic wage have an advantage over
workers on the Commonwealth basic wage, not only in nominal wage but also in effective wage ”.
266. Industrial Boards in Queensland. —Provision is made under the Industrial Arbitration
Acts 1916 to 1925, for the appointment of Industrial Boards for any calling industry, or
undertaking. These Boards are appointed by the Minister charged with the administration
of the Acts, on the recommendation of the Board of Trade and Arbitration.
267. The functions of these Boards are twofold : —
(1) The making of an award in any industrial cause remitted to the Board by the
Board of Trade and Arbitration ; or
(2) The making, after inquiry, of recommendations—as to the regulation of any calling
for the purpose of enabling the Board of Trade and Arbitration to make an
, award ; or inquiring into and reporting to the Board of Trade and Arbitration
on any matter remitted by such Board. (Section 39.)
268. The declarations of the Board of Trade and Arbitration as to cost and standard of
living, minimum rate of wages, and standard hours, are binding on industrial boards, and an
appeal lies to the Board of Trade and Arbitration against any award, or part of an award, of
an Industrial Board.
269. Outstanding Differences of Queensland System Compared with Systems of Other
States —
(1) The practice adopted in relation to the fixing of the minimum wage.
(2) Express power to consider the prosperity of the calling. (Section 8 (i) (6).)
(3) Express power to consider the value of an employee’s labour to his employer.
(Section 8 (i) ( b ).)
(4) The direction that the same wage shall’be paid to persons of either sex performing
the same work or producing the same return of profit to their employer.
(Section 8 (i) (u).)
(5) Express power to make declarations as to —
(a) The cost of living.
(b) The standard of living (the New South Wales tribunal has this power).
(c) The standard hours. (Section 9 (3).)
(6) The standard of comfort to be provided by the minimum wage has to be arrived
at after having “ regard to the conditions of living prevailing among employees
in the calling in respect of which such minimum wage is fixed ”. (Section
« (d) (1).)
(7) Although the Board of Trade and Arbitration, like the New South Wales
Industrial Commission, [See para. 230) has power to declare the standard
of living, it apparently does not exercise such power.
INDUSTRIAL LEGISLATION AND PRACTICE OF ARBITRATION TRIBUNALS.
D.—SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
270. The Industrial Court was constituted by the Industrial Arbitration Act 1912, and
Section 22 enacted that the Court should not have power to order or to prescribe wages which
did not secure to the employee affected a “ living wage ” which was defined as a sum sufficient
for the normal and reasonable needs of the average employee living in the locality where the work under
consideration is done or to be done.


Sec. 5. —Industrial Legislation and Practice of Arbitration Tribunals. — D. South Australia.
271. The jurisdiction of the Court was limited to employers and employees in industry,
and industry was defined as meaning any business, trade, manufacture, undertaking, occupation
or calling (except agriculture) in which persons are employed for hire or reward. Agriculture
(without limiting its ordinary meaning) includes horticulture, viticulture, and the use of land
for any purpose of husbandry, including the keeping and breeding of live stock, poultry or bees,
and the growth of trees, plants, fruits, vegetables, and the like. It followed that persons engaged
in the great primary industries of wool, wheat, wine, fruit, &c., were definitely excluded from
the operation of the Act.
272. The Industrial Arbitration Act was repealed in 1920 by “ The Industrial Code 1920.”
The Industrial Court constituted by the Act of 1920 was continued.
273. The Code provided for the appointment of a Board of Industry consisting of a
President, or a Deputy President of the Court, and four Commissioners, two to be representatives
of employers, and two of employees. One of the functions of the Board is, after public inquiry
as to the increase or decrease in the average cost of living, to declare the living wage to be paid
to adult male employees and to adult female employees, with full power to fix different rates
to be paid in different defined areas. While the “ living wage ” is declared by the Board, the
Industrial Court determines secondary wages and labour conditions generally.
274. “ Living wage ” was again defined as meaning a sum sufficient for the normal and
reasonable needs of the average employee living in the locality where the work under consideration
is done or to be done.
275. In 1920, in The Living Wage (Printing Trades) Case 3 S.A.I.R., page 215, the learned
President after hearing elaborate arguments, and giving consideration to previous judgments
of the Court, construed various expressions in the above definition of the “ living wage ” as
follows “ Dealing with the expression ‘ the normal and reasonable needs ’ he said, “ I have
frequently said that such needs cannot be interpreted without reference to national income and
national output .” 0
276. Dealing with the construction to be placed upon the words “ average employee,”
the learned President referred to the fact that Gordon J. in the Brushmakers’ Case (1908) expressly
laid down that the living wage was a family wage, and that he based his decision on data with
respect to a man, wife, and three children. The learned President also referred to the fact that
the New South Wales tribunal avowedly proceeded on the basis that the adult male wage should
be a wage for an average family, and had concluded that it was only permissible to assume a family
of four. Referring further to a previous judgment of his own in 1918, the learned President
sa id ; “ I think it desirable at once to state that my judgment did assume the existence of a
man, wife, and three children.”
277. The final conclusion arrived at by the learned President on the construction of the
statutory expression “ average family ” is as follows : —“ I arrive then at the general conclusion
that both in law and commonsense, the “ living wage ” should be such as to support a family of five.”
278. Ever since the date of the above judgment the Board of Industry in South Australia
has acted in accordance with this interpretation of the Statute.
279. In South Australia, as in Western Australia, the “ living wage ” is fixed on the assumption
that it is the wage for the unskilled worker.
INDUSTRIAL LEGISLATION AND PRACTICE OF ARBITRATION TRIBUNALS.
E._WESTERN AUSTRALIA.
280. Under Section 121 of the Industrial Arbitration Act 1912-1925, the Court of Arbitration,
which consists of a Judge and a representative of employers, and a representative of employees,
is required to determine before the 14th day of June in each year the basic wage to be paid to male
and female workers. The same section also provides that “ the expression ‘ basic \wage ’ means
a sum sufficient to enable the average worker to whom it applies to live in reasonable comfort having
regard to any domestic obligations to which such average worker would be ordinarily subject”
281. The difficulties of construction arising out of the language used by the legislature
are apparent on the face of tbe section.

Sec. 5.— Industrial Legislation and Practice of Arbitration Tribunals. — E. Western Australia.
282. After an exhaustive analysis, the Arbitration Court on the 11th day of June, 1926,
arrived at the following conclusion, upon which it fixed the basic wage for Western Australia
for the year 1926-27.
(1) The “ average worker ” is the “ unskilled worker.” (This construction was
unanimously accepted.)
(2) The expression the domestic obligations to which such average worker would
be ordinarily subject ” means a wife and two dependent children. (This was
a majority judgment), the dissentient member holding that the expression
means a wife and three dependent children.
283. The material section of the Industrial Arbitration Act, so construed, placed upon
the Court the obligation to determine a basic wage to be paid to each unskilled adult male worker,
sufficient to enable him, with his wife and two children, to live in reasonable comfort. Every
adult pale worker to whom the act applied would receive not less than the declared basic wage,
quite irrespective of his actual family obligation.
284. The Members of the Court all differed on the question of the amount to be declared.
Mr. Justice Dwyer, after considering the evidence, the Commonwealth award, various State
awards, and the report of the Basic Wage Commission, arrived at the sum of £4 5s. The
representative of the employees gave no actual figure, but it is obvious from the report of his
judgment that he favoured a higher amount. The representative of the employers favoured an
amount of £4 Is.
285. The Act required a majority decision, and, as a compromise, the representatives of
the employers and employees accepted the figures of the learned President.
286. In 1927, the Court of Arbitration fixed the basic wage for Western Australia at the
sum of £4 5s., on the same family unit of husband, wife, and two children. No alteration was
made in 1928.
INDUSTRIAL LEGISLATION AND PRACTICE OF ARBITRATION TRIBUNALS.
E. VICTORIA AND TASMANIA.
287. These two States have no Industrial Courts, but have adopted the wages board
system. The evidence indicated that in practice the boards in these two States, in fixing wages,
use the basic wage of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court as their starting point.
288. An essential difference between the practice of these two States, is that the wages
boards in Victoria include an element of the Commonwealth basic wage, known as the “ Powers’
3s.”, but in Tasmania this amount is not included.
289. In Victoria, many of the Boards provide for quarterly adjustments of the wages fixed,
in accordance with the rise or fall in the Commonwealth cost of living figures. Such adjustments
are not provided for in Tasmania.
SECTION 6.
REGULATION OF WAGES AND WORKING CONDITIONS-VARIATIONS IN STATUTES
AND IN PRACTICE OF TRIBUNALS.
290. The multiform methods adopted in Australia for the regulation of wages and conditions
of labour impose an unnecessary burden upon both employees and employers.
291. A few of these (differences may be indicated ; there are many more.
1. The Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration operates in each
State, and by its awards, regulates many industries, or branches of industry.
2. The coal-mining industry has a special Commonwealth tribunal of its own.
3. The employees in the Commonwealth Public Service have a separate tribunal.
4. In addition to the Commonwealth system, each State has at least one system,
while some of the States have more than one, and one State has four. *


Sec. 6.— Regulation of Wages and Working Conditions. —Variations in Statutes and in Practice of
Tribunals.
5. The powers, duties and functions of the various tribunals exhibit many points
of difference (some of which we have already referred to). In some of the States these
variations are not clearly apparent on the face of the Statute, but depend upon the
construction placed by the Tribunal on vague and indefinite words and phrases.
6. The over-lapping of, and variations between, Commonwealth and State Awards
are serious matters, as is also the power of parties to invoke the jurisdiction of a State
tribunal, and if not satisfied to endeavour to obtain a more favorable award from the
Commonwealth Court or vice versa. An attempt has been made in the Commonwealth
Conciliation and Arbitration Act of 1928, Sections 17 and 32, to deal with these
matters, but the amendments do not cover the whole of the field.*
7. The question of hours of labour.
8. The Commonwealth Court in general fixes its basic wage for any industry
where no special conditions exist, by ascertaining the Harvester equivalent, and adding
thereto 3s. per week. (See paragraphs 444 and 452.)
9. The direction contained in the New South Wales and Queensland Acts to
declare the standard of living. Special reference is made to this in paragraphs
198-255 of this report.
10. The powers of State tribunals are not co-extensive, e.g., the New South Wales
Industrial Commission controls rural industries ; the South Australian Industrial Court
does not.
292. Further specific differences of detail follow.
293. Capacity to Pay.—Under the Commonwealth system f and the systems of South Australia
and Western Australia, capacity to pay is theoretically, at least, disregarded by the Industrial
Tribunals. If an industry cannot pay the declared basic wage, it must go out of existence.
294. In Queensland (and in that State alone) the Statute expressly empowers the tribunal
when fixing wages to consider the relative prosperity of industries, and the value of the employee’s
labour to his employer. That is, the Court is expressly empowered to consider capacity to pay.
(See also paragraphs 257 and 269).
295. The Family Unit. —The family unit, as prescribed by Statute or adopted in practice
by wage fixing tribunals, varies as follows : —
Commonwealth . 0
Queensland .. .. VMan, wife, and three children
South Australia .. .. J
Western Australia .. Man, wife, and two children
New South Wales. . .. Until 1927, man, wife, and two children, but since the
. passing of the Family Endowment Act 1927, man and
wife only
Victoria .. .. . .\No statutory unit, but the five-person unit may be
Tasmania .. ’ .. J said to be in operation
296. Standard of living — Commonwealth. —“ The normal needs of the average employee
regarded as a human being in a civilized community,” and the wages to ensure such standard
were wages “ sufficient to provide these things (food and shelter) and clothing, and a condition of
frugal comfort estimated by current human standards. ’ ’ (Higgins, J. , in the Harvester Case, 1907.)
297. South Australia. —The standard of living is represented by a wage sufficient to provide
for the normal and reasonable needs of “ the unskilled man ” and his wife, and three children, living
in the locality where the work under construction is done or to be done.
298. Western Australia. —The standard of living is represented by a wage sufficient to
enable “ the unskilled worker ” and his wife, and two children to live in reasonable comfort.
299. Queensland. —The standard of living is represented by a wage not less than sufficient
to maintain “ a well conducted adult male employee of average health, strength and competence ”
* Under Section 17. —“ If it appears to the Court that any State Industrial Authority is dealing or about to deal with an industrial
dispute, or with a matter which is provided for in an award of the Court or is the subject of proceedings before the Court, the Court may make
order restraining the State Industrial Authority from dealing with that dispute, or any part thereof, or with that matter as the Court thinks
fit, and thereupon the authority shall, in accordance with that order, cease to proceed in the dispute, or part thereof, or in that matter.”
Section*3Bc (Section 32 of the Amending Act) is as follows :—“ The Court shall, in the case of every industrial dispute consider
in the course of the hearing and as promptly as possible if there is anything in the nature or circumstances of the industry, or any other
reason, which makes it more desirable that the dispute or any part of it should be dealt with by the Court than by any State Industrial
Authority or by State Industrial Authorities in the several States, and unless the Court so declares, it shall dismiss or refrain from further
hearing or determining, the dispute or part.”
f By an amendment of the Commonwealth Arbitration Act, assented to December, 1928, the Court is empowered to consider
(except as to the basic wage), the probable economic effect of its determinations. The Section in question reads as follows :—“ The
Court shall, before making any award or certifying any agreement, and in proceedings for the variation or cancellation of an award or
agreement, take into consideration the probable economic effect of the agreement or award in relation to the community in general and
the probable economic effect thereof upon the industry or industries concerned :—Provided that this section shall not affect the practice
of the Court infixing the basic toage."


Sec. 6. — Regulation of Wages and Working Conditions.—Variations in Statutes and in Practice oj
Tribunals.
and his wife, and a family of three children, on a fair and average standard of comfort having
regard to the conditions of living 'prevailing among employees in the calling in respect of which the
minimum rate is fixed.
300. New South Wales. —In 1926 the Amending Act empowered the Industrial Commission
“ not more frequently than once in every six months to determine a standard of living, and to
declare what shall be the living wage based upon such standard.” This has been described by
the Industrial Commissioner as representing “ a new departure in the duty prescribed by
Parliament.”
301 The new statutory provision has been construed by the New South Wales Industrial
Commission as follows: —“ The standard of living . . . . was to be a standard of living as to which
the intention cannot be ascribed to the Legislature that it should be a standard of living suitable
to males, and not to females ; to seniors and not to juniors ; to men with families and not to
men without families. The intention was that what may be called an Australian standard should
be determined by ordinary methods of investigation and that this standard should be one and the
same throughout the whole zone of industrial life.” (30. 1. G., page 1441.)
302. The above conclusion was amplified by the Industrial Commissioner in the Living
Wage Declaration of 27th June, 1927 (xxxii I. G., 49), as follows:—“An Industrial Arbitration
authority in New South Wales could have declared a living wage on the footing of bare subsistence
.... or upon the standard of living of a skilled or a professional worker, or upon a standard
of luxury, not comfort. The new Act .... leaves as it was, the liberty of the Commission
to adopt whatever standard of living it finds to be just. No other restriction is placed upon the
judicial principles of action the Commission should adopt.”
303. The New South Wales .Commission, therefore, apparently discarded “ the humblest
class of worker ” or “ the unskilled worker ” as the type for which in accordance with the previous
practice of the New South Wales tribunals the living wage has to be declared, and reverted in
effect to the declaration of the Basic Wage Commission, that their duty was not to discriminate
between the standard reasonable for one type of employee and that which is reasonable for
another type. {See per Higgins, J., 15. C.A.K. 106.)
304. To attempt to determine a standard of living which in any real sense would be one
and the same throughout the whole zone of industrial life is to attempt the impossible.
305. Logically, that would involve {a) a reduction of the whole industrial community
(skilled and unskilled, industrious and lazy) to the dead level of a communistic identity of wage ;
(6) an entire disregard of the value of services in production; and ( c ) the impossible condition
that every worker shall be part of a family unit of the same structure.
306. But the determination of the New South Wales Commission is not subject to appeal
and therefore, whether right or wrong, has the force of law, until altered by legislation. Until
so altered it represents a marked and important difference in wage-fixing method, as compared
with the methods of the Commonwealth and of all the other States. It is to bring out and
emphasize this difference, which is a matter of cardinal importance, not only with regard to wage-
fixation, but also with regard to the consideration of any scheme of Child Endowment, which is
not entirely separated in operation from wage-fixation, that we have ventured to analyse and
criticize the interpretation of the Statute, adopted by the New South Wales Industrial Commission,
and the consequential effects.
307. Determination of Basic Wage—Time intervals.— There are also essential differences
in the legislation of the Commonwealth and of those States (Queensland, New South Wales,
South Australia, and Western Australia) which have industrial tribunals, as to the statutory
period which must elapse before a change can be made in the basic or living wage, and, therefore,
in the standard of living.
308. Those statutory periods are as follows : —
Commonwealth. —No time is specified. The Court does not declare a basic wage applicable
to all industries. It fixes a basic wage in connexion with each award. On application by either
party to an award the Court may vary that basic rate.
309. New South Wales. —Not oftener than once in every six months. (Act No. 14 of 1926.)
The first declaration was made under that Act on the 16th December, 1926. The second
declaration, which raised the standard 11s. per week, was made on the 27th June, 1927 (six
months and eleven days after the first declaration). In connection with the 1927 declaration,
the Industrial Commissioner said : —“ It is a mistake to suppose that the Commission is to
re-determine the standard of living and to re-declare the living wage every six months ....
A standard which changed every six months could hardly be called a standard.”


Sec. 6. — Regulation of Wages and Working Conditions—Variations in Statutes and in Practice of
Tribunals.
310. Queensland. —From time to time, i.e., whenever the Court thinks fit.
311. South Australia. —The Board is required to hold “ an inquiry for the purpose of
declaring a basic wage whenever a substantial change in the cost of living, or any other circumstance
has, in the opinion of the Board, rendered it just or expedient that the question of the living
wage should be re-opened or reviewed.” But no new determination may be made until the
expiration of six months from the date of the prior determination.
312. Western Australia. —Before the 14th June in every year.
SECTION 7.
CONFLICT OF INDUSTRIAL LAWS—JUDICIAL COMMENT.
313. The Industrial Keports contain frequent judicial comments and complaints on some
of the aspects above-referred to.
314. The following are illustrative quotations: —
“ The avowed policy of the Commonwealth which has remained unchallenged for many years is
to impose on all industries the obligation of providing at least a living wage for all employees. There
have been and there are undoubtedly to-day imperfections in the legislative devices for the carrying out
of this policy.” (The President, New South Wales Board of Trade, Declaration 8th October, 1920.)
315. “ The various States in declaring a living wage have to consider the question of interstate
competition. Mr. Justice Higgins has pointed out the fact, and has expressed in unambiguous terms, his
opinion as to the propriety of the States paying due respect to this limitation of their powers. The
limitation points to the desirability of providing some machinery which will fix the living wage for Australia,
with due regard to the problem as a whole, and to particular conditions, such as the cost of living in each
State or locality. While such machinery need not involve a sacrifice of Industrial Court autonomy, it would
simplify materially the complexities of the industrial situation as it prevails now, and as it prevailed in
1916.” (The President, Board of Industry, S.A., in the Living Wage Judgment, 2 S.A.I.R. page 114.)
316. “ The confusion between the principles adopted by different Australian tribunals is serious,
and some uniformity in fundamentals is most desirable. The disconnected systems of wage fixing of the
continent require national co-relation, but pending public appreciation of this need, the Board can only
carry out to the best of its ability the duties imposed upon it by the Statute. The wages paid in Adelaide
are largely fixed by the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. They are without exception
higher than the 13/4 which has hitherto been the basic wage in this State. Here again is a fertile source
of dissatisfaction and irritation industrial peace is not to be promoted by marked
disparities in rates of wage for similar types of work done in the same State.” (The President, S.A. Board
of Industry, 7 S.A.I.R. page 209.)
317. “ The Board feels impelled to draw the attention of the Minister of Industry to the menace
involved to industrial peace, stability, and efficiency, as a result of the non-existence of machinery for harmonizing
basic wage rates throughout Australia .” (The President, S.A. Board of Industry, 7 S.A.I.R. 222).
318. “ No wage-fixing authority in any State can afford to disregard wages and conditions applying
in other States of Australia, as.the Commonwealth Constitution prescribes that commerce and intercourse
shall be free, and finally when we have two independent bodies fixing wages binding on employers and
workers in the same area, each must to some extent bear in mind the possible effects of differentiation of
wage rates.” (The President of the Court of Arbitration, W.A. Basic Wage Declaration, 1927-8, page 13).
319. “ Another important consideration is that the industrial world is now sensitive throughout
to changes in any of its parts. This used not to be so, when the bargains of the unions with their employers
were not published, but the operations of the Industrial Courts during the past seventeen years have
altered that. To raise one set of wages now ivithout affecting the whole is something like trying to create a
column of water in a lake by pouring water in one spot.” (New South Wales Board of Trade Declaration
of 17th December, 1919).
320. “ A word of caution is necessary about the Federal basic wage That
wage contains an amount of three shillings which is known to be a spurious ingredient from the point of
view of any logical connection with the living wage standard of the Commonwealth Arbitration system.
It came into a certain award fortuitously ; it was repeated in one or two other awards fortuitously, and
has come to be frequently added into the true living wage declared on the Commonwealth Arbitration
Court’s principles. It is not, however, included in all awards. For example, Federal awards concerning
railway men omit this spurious ingredient.” (New South Wales Industrial Commissioner, Declaration
27th June, 1927).
321 “ It is generally conceded that, as the national corollary of inter-State free trade, the machinery
for fixing wages and conditions of employment throughout Australia should be co ordinated.” (Court of
Industrial Arbitration of Queensland, 15th February, 1921.)
322 “ We think it is permissible to lay down a minimum wage which shall be applicable to industries
of average prosperity, reserving to the Court the right to fix a lower minimum in industries which are unable
to bear that minimum, and to fix a higher wage where the prosperity of a calling renders such higher wage
proper. We are aware that in adopting this course we are departing from the generally recognised custom
of Courts of Arbitration, and particularly of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court.” (Court of Industria
Arbitration of Queensland, Declaration February, 1921).

323 “ But although I dismiss the application, this case puts in a glaring light the inconvenience
and danger of the constitutional position. Here are two tribunals—one constituted by the Commonwealth
and one constituted by a State—handling the same subject matters independently as* if the other tribunal
did not exist. There is no co-ordination, no inter-dependence between the Courts, and the disputants
are only too apt to treat the Courts as rival shops. This 'position involves grave danger to industrial peace,
and to the continuity of operations in industries. But I cannot see how the position can be altered without
a change of the Constitution.” (Mr. Justice Higgins, 14 C.A.R. 364, at page 369).
324. “ There are two Commonwealth awards operating in the same field as the Determination.
The resulting complications are chaotic. If it were desired to design such a situation it might he conceived by
the disordered mental efforts of a commission of lunatics. Not only are there two living wage rates arrived
at by different methods and different authorities, but the very bases of the two jurisdictions also differ.”
(Mr. President Hewitson, Brassworkers Board Appeal Case, S.A.I.R. 28.)
SECTION 8.
BASIC WAGE COMMISSION, 1920—JUDICIAL AND OTHER COMMENTS.
325. Serious increases and relatively rapid changes in the cost of most commodities and
services during and immediately after the Great War, and numerous complaints as to the inadequacy
of wages to meet the continually rising cost of living, led the Federal Government, in 1920, to
appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into “ the actual cost of living at the present time according
to reasonable standards of comfort, including all matters comprised in the ordinary expenditure
of a household for a man, with a wife, and three children under fourteen years of age, and the
several items which make up that cost.”
326. That Commission became known as the Basic Wage Commission. It instituted a
series of minute inquiries into the cost of articles of food, of clothing, and of rents. The result
of these inquiries was crystallized in an elaborate report with lists* of articles which, in the opinion
of the Commission, were necessary to maintain reasonable standards of comfort.” The Commission
set down the then money values in the capital cities and in the city of Newcastle, New South
Wales, of the items which they had selected as constituting a “ reasonable standard of comfort.”
The amounts ranged from £5 6s. 2d. in Brisbane to £5 17s. in Sydney.
327. It was not the duty of the Commission to declare a basic wage, but in the opinion of
two of the members, expressions were used in the report which seemed to imply that the findings
of the Commission as to the cost of living must necessarily become the basic wage. Those two
members were of opinion that the Harvester decision (see paras. 349 and 442) represented a
fair and reasonable remuneration for employees. The money findings of the Commission were so
much above the rates of wage then existing as to cause a great amount of discussion. The Prime
Minister of the day, the Right Honorable W. M. Hughes, immediately called fora report from
the Commonwealth Statistician, Mr. (now Sir) C. H. Knibbs, as to the possibility of paying to all
adult male employees the amount of £5 16s. per week which was roughly the average of the amounts
found by the Commission as the cost of living. Mr. Knibbs reported that such a wage cannot
be paid to all adult male employees, because the whole produced wealth of the country, including all
that portion of produced wealth which now goes in the shape of profit to the employers, would not, if
divided up equally amongst the employees, yield the necessary weekly amount .”
*
328. In the result, the standard suggested by the findings of the Commission was nowhere
applied by any wage-fixing authority as the basic wage. When read in conjunction with the
explanation given by the Commission, it did not purport to represent a basic wage in the sense
of being a wage adequate merely for the “ humblest class of workers.”
329. The inquiry and report of the 1920 Basic Wage Commission have had a great and
continuing effect upon the expectations and demands of organised workers, as to the amounts
which should be awarded by way of a basic wage.
330. Mr. Justice Higgins (15 C.A.R. 306) made the following comment:—“ What the
Commissioners have reported on is not a ‘ Basic Wage ’ at all There is no
meaning in * basic ’ except in relation to something higher Yet, though for
a basic wage one had to find the wage adequate for the humblest class of ivorker the Commissioners
expressly say that their duty was not to discriminate between the standard reasonable for one type
of employee and that which is reasonable for another type It would obviously
be much better for all parties—union and employers —to begin again and press for an inquiry
that will replace the Harvester judgment on scientific lines rather than to press for payment of
this so-called ‘ basic wage ’ of the Commission, which is not a true basic wage, but a will-o-the-
wisp that will lead them into the ditch.” (15 C.A.R. 306)
* The Terms of Reference necessitated compilation by the Commission of detailed lists.


Sec. 8. — Basic Wage Commission 1920. — Judicial and other Comments.
331. Mr. Justice Powers, in the Federated Gas Employees Case, 1921, pointed out that
“ the difference between the Harvester judgment and the finding of the Royal Commission arises
from the fact that this Court [i.e., the Commonwealth Arbitration Court] has to fix a minimum
wage for an unskilled worker with a wife and family of three and the members
of the Royal Commission set themselves the task of finding out the cost of living of a typical
family under the highest standard set out in that report, namely, any man, his wife and family of
three, whether he was a wage-earner or not.” His Honour also said : —“ The Royal Commission
in question was not appointed to find out what the basic wage of an unskilled worker or of any
worker should be. It admittedly called itself a Basic Wage Commission, but it was not appointed
as such.”
332. The very use of the term “ Basic Wage Commission ” appears to have caused a
confusion of thought as to the real limits of the inquiry, and that confusion has not been
dissipated by explanations since made.
333. Mr. Justice Powers, in the case previously mentioned, pointed out that notwith-
standing a widespread belief to the contrary, the 1920 Commission—
(1) did not find what the basic wage should be ;
(2) did not report to the Government what the basic wage should be ;
(3) did not recommend that their finding should be adopted by the Government
or by the Courts as a basic wage.
334. His Honour quoted from an address by the Chairman of the Commission, in which
he said : —“ The Basic Wage Commission itself in its second report swept away the notion that
it recommended what it found necessary for five persons should be made the basic wage.”
335. The Commission, basing its finding upon lengthy lists of commodities and services,
adopted standards applicable to other than basic wage workers.
336. Referring to the Commission’s clothing lists, His Honour said : —“ The Commission
allows ‘ the typical family ’ a quantity and quality of clothes which 1 know from my experience
in this Court are not necessary for men, women, and children to live in reasonable comfort, even
when in receipt of £400 a year.
337. Mr. Justice Powers emphasized that the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, when
fixing a minimum wage, was limited to considering the unskilled worker. This point was
emphasized also by Mr. Justice Higgins in the Amalgamated Society of Engineers’ Case, 1921
(C.A.R. Vol. 15, page 297). His Honour said :—“ If there has been one thing that has been
made clear in all the Australian tribunals, it is that the basic wage is the wage of the base —
the wage for the unskilled worker, and that the secondary wage for skill, and other necessary
qualifications, has to be added to the basic wage. The basic wage must not take into account the
conditions appropriate to the skilled workers at all.”
338. The indicator lists for clothing promulgated by the Basic Wage Commission enumerated
21 separate items for the husband, 40 for the wife, 21 for each of the first two children, and 18
for the third, at an average cost, for all the States, of £70 per annum. The food list detailed 25
items, although the Unions’ claim covered 58.* The miscellaneous list comprised 25 items,
the Unions having claimed 459.
339. The following is the comment of the Basic Wage Commission on its own clothing
“ indicator list ” : —“ It is to be distinctly understood that the Commission in no sense regard
this indicator list as being likely to be invariably followed or as setting any model to be followed.”
(Page 32).
340. The wife of the “ humblest class of worker,” though probably astonished, would
certainly rejoice in a standard of “ frugal comfort ” which provided her (as the indicator list
sets out) with a costume costing £11, silk blouses and gloves, a 35s. golfer, and 35s. shoes.
341. The Basic Wage Commission’s indicator lists were practically adopted by the New
South Wales Industrial Commission, in determining the standard of living, and the living wage,
in 1926.
342. Mr. Justice Dwyer, of the Western Australian Arbitration Court, in the course of a
judgment given in June, 1926, in which the Court declared the basic wage, referred to the report
of the Basic Wage Commission. He said that “ while the amount allowed for food seemed to be
fair when we consider that whatever class of society the worker belongs to, the food regimen must
practically remain the same, but when the items for clothing and miscellaneous are weighed and
considered the findings of the Basic Wage Commission appear to be in excess of the requirements
of the unskilled worker on the basic wage.”
* This food scale, all calories and no vitamins, is symbolic of the mechanization of socio-economics which is tending to extinguish
individual initiative and ostracize parental responsibility.


Sec. 8. — Basic Wage Commission 1920. — Judicial and other Comments.
343. Though no tribunal felt itself in a position to give effect as a basic wage to the findings
of the 1920 Commission, the scale adopted by that Commission continued to be urged before the
Arbitration Tribunals (as it has been urged before this Commission) as one representing the proper
minimum wage for unskilled workers. A typical illustration of the answer which the tribunals
have felt bound to give to this contention may be cited from the judgment of the learned President
of the New South Wales Board of Trade, Judge Beeby, in the declaration of the basic wage for
New South Wales in 1920. His Honour said : —“ It is necessary to again point out that the
function of the Board is the fixing of the basic wage, i.e., the lowest wage to be paid to an adult
citizen carrying average responsibility. Appeals to sentiment and arguments as to the necessity
for a more equitable distribution of wealth cannot assist a tribunal which is discharging a duty
carefully defined hy Parliament. The Board has not the power to say what wage it would like
to see every citizen receive, or to set up an ideal standard of comfort.”
344. How remote from reality were the findings of the Basic Wage Commission, as material
upon which a tribunal could found a basic wage, may be gathered from the facts that—
1. A few months before the Commission made its report, Mr. President Brown, of the
South Australian Court, after full and independent inquiry into cost of living,
declared a basic wage (covering a five-unit family) for South Australia at £3 15s.
2. In December, 1920, a few weeks after the date of the Commission’s report, the
New South Wales Board of Trade, also after an independent inquiry into cost
of living, declared a basic wage of £4 5s.
3. It was officially stated by the Commonwealth Statistician that the whole production
of the country was not sufficient to pay a basic wage in accordance with the
findings of the Commission.
SECTION 9.
THE BASIC WAGE—STANDARD OF LIVING, CONDITIONS, ETC.
345. In order to guard against possible misconception, we think it desirable to preface
this section of the report by a repetition of the statement made in paragraph 171 that as the
question whether a system or systems of wage fixation should or should not be continued is
outside our terms of reference, we express no opinion upon that point. The inevitable reactions
between existing Australian systems of wage fixation and any system of child endowment, and
the necessity for a single exclusive control of both, have supplied the leitmotiv for this section.
346. Not a little confusion has, in our opinion, been introduced by a somewhat
indiscriminate use of the terms “ Basic Wage”, “ Living Wage ” and “ Minimum Wage ”. These
terms are not always used in the same sense either in Industrial Statutes, or in the decisions of the
various tribunals.
347. “ Basic wage ” appears to us the best and most expressive term. The wage is to
be the “ base ” or bedrock wage, below which it is not deemed fitting that a normal adult male
worker should be asked or allowed to work. The chief object of legal fixation of wages was to
protect the worker against being compelled to accept a sweating wage.
348. In New South Wales Statute and practice, the term “ living wage ” apparently has
not the same meaning as “ basic wage ”, though in the South Australian Statute and practice
it has.
349. The basic wage system, as Australians understand it, arose through the adoption
by the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, in the Marine Cooks Case (2 C.A.R.
53) of the principles of the 1907 Harvester Judgment.
350. It has been said that since then “ all the old economic theories of wages must be
cast aside.” The theory of a “ living wage is based on rights in distribution, not services in
production.” {The Next Step , page 28).
351. If, in that passage, the expression “ living wage ” is used in relation to the wage of
workers other than the “ unskilled ” or “ humblest class ” the passage is, in our opinion,
inconsistent with the judgments and practice of all Australian Arbitration tribunals, except that
of New South Wales since 1926.
352. If “needs”, or “rights in distribution”, constitute the principle upon which the
basic wage is founded, then it appears that the actual or accepted limitations of jurisdiction of
Arbitrations Courts prevent them from giving that doctrine a logical application.


Sec. 9. —The Basic Wage.—Standard of Living, Conditions, &c.
353. If “ rights in distribution ” limited by “ needs ” and having no relation to “ services
in production ” constitute a title to a part of the total production of the community, it is obvious
that children and others who are incapable of adding to the aggregate of that production must
have their needs considered.
354. To give a large part of the children’s share (as is done under the present system) to
those who are not responsible for, and who contribute nothing to, their maintenance, is clearly
both illogical and unjust, and is a root cause of many of the industrial disturbances which occur
and of the social evils which exist.
355. The basic wage is designed to ensure provision for the “ needs ” of the unskilled
worker. The skilled worker is protected by the addition to that wage of a sum, based on the
extra value of his services in production, and known as his ‘ margin for skill ”.
356. Reference is continually being made to the heavy burden placed upon industry by
the adoption of a flat rate wage, fixed, not upon consideration of the value of services in production,
but by reference to the family needs of the worker. But, it is fair to say that a flat rate wage for a
given class of work is not a new invention of Australian wage tribunals. Apart from piece-work,
which must always have had a place in wage-systems, flat rates were universal long before the
idea of creating such tribunals became viable. Undissected and undiscussed, those rates must
yet have included amounts going beyond the actual needs of the individual worker, since
otherwise the married worker with a family could not have lived upon the wage.
357. The new aspects of wage fixation introduced by Australian methods were : —
(а) The public announcement of family obligations as the leading or the only factor
to be considered in determining basic wage rates.
(б) The dismissal, or the relegation to the background, of the fundamental notion
that a wage is really and properly based upon the value of “ services in
production ” of the worker.
(c) The ousting of the “ iron law of wages ” which was supposed to depress the lot
of the worker, without injury to the employer,, and its replacement by the
Draconian Decree of a tribunal, which consigns employer and employee alike
to a common industrial extinction, if their joint “ industry ” fails to provide
for the payment of a prescribed basic wage.
358. Rigidity of the Basic Wage. —The inflexibility of basic wage law, in our opinion,
requires consideration. In times of emergency and of national or local stress, the whole community
may be forced to lower its standard of living. Or a local lowering of standard may become
unavoidable, as the result of stresses affecting a particular industry only. When such conditions
exist, Industrial Tribunals should have express power —
(а) to review, and if necessary, to reduce the basic wage ;
(б) to direct that part time should be worked ;
(c) after having ascertained the views of the workers as distinct from those of union
officials, to sanction agreements between employers and employees, providing
for a temporary reduction, of wages, even of the “ basic wage ”, and/or a
temporary alteration of conditions.
359. The greater flexibility of industrial regulation, thus attained, would in our opinion—
(a) tend greatly to prevent or reduce unemployment; and (6) to lessen the necessity (if any such
necessity exists) for special assistance to the families of workers.
360. Uniformity necessary. —Uniformity is in our opinion necessary in respect of the
following matters : —
(1) the class of workers for whom the basic wage is to be fixed ;
(2) the family unit;
(3) the standard of living (if such term be retained) (paragraphs 414, 415) ;
(4) the basic wage (which logically depends on the family unit adopted, and the
standard to be provided for that unit.)
361. The evils arising from over-lapping of industrial awards, and absence of uniformity
in Commonwealth and State systems, have been the subject of frequent comment by the learned
Presidents of State tribunals, who have urged the need for co-ordination or uniformity,
especially in relation to the basic wage. ( See paragraphs 315-324). We have carefully considered


Sec. 9.— The Basic Wage.—Standard of Living , Conditions , ffic.
whether, and to what extent, those evils are capable of being effectively remedied by the
adoption of uniform State systems, either alone, or in conjunction with Commonwealth
legislation within the present competence of the Commonwealth Parliament. Whether such
competence exists is at least doubtful.
362. What is implied in the word “ co-ordination ” might, if it could be given practical
operation, effect important improvements. A study of the situation convinces us, however,
that such improvements (mainly based, as they would necessarily be, upon amending legislation
in each of the six States) would have no promise of completeness, and in any event, would lack
the essential quality of permanence. Especially would this be the case if statutory provisions
relating to child endowment were added to the catena of industrial legislation. Any such
statutory provision would always be liable to be defeated by decisions of tribunals which, acting
indirectly, could render nugatory the intention of the Legislature.
363. In considering the question of ensuring uniformity of methods of basic wage-fixation,
we may mention two suggestions to which our attention has been directed. One is that a
conference should be arranged between the heads of Commonwealth and State tribunals
364. It may be noted that Section 29 of the Commonwealth Amending Act 1928, opens
the way for the holding of a voluntary conference between a Judge of the Court and a State
industrial authority, with a view to securing co-ordination between the Court’s awards or orders
and the awards, decisions or orders of the State industrial authority.
365. A difficulty which immediately presents itself is that Victoria and Tasmania
have no “ State Industrial Authorities ” other than wages boards, and a voluntary conference
between a Judge of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court and the Wages Boards
of Victoria or Tasmania does not seem feasible. In any event such conference could not in the
light of the proviso to Section 22 of the Amending Act affect the matter which we consider of vital
importance, viz., the declaration of the basic wage.
366. Co-ordination of Commonwealth and State basic wages as a result of the holding
of voluntary conferences is excluded by the terms of the proviso to Section 22aa, and the relevant
sections of legislation of the States.
367. More serious objections are the inherent difficulty of securing uniform legislation
to give effect to any conclusions arrived at, and the continuing power of State Parliaments to alter
such legislation, and so to destroy the essential uniformity. With regard to the Commonwealth
an added difficulty would probably be an absence of legislative power to give effect to the
conclusions of any such conference.
368. The Other suggestion, made by Dr. Jethro Brown, a former President of the Industrial
Court of South Australia, is that an appellate tribunal should be established, to which an appeal
could be made from the basic w T age declaration of any State. Objections to this system include
the difficulty of conferring jurisdiction on such a body, and the great cost involved in appealing.
Either the tribunal would have to travel extensively, covering places as far apart as Brisbane
and Perth, or witnesses would have to be brought from great distances. Obviously, also, such
a tribunal created by State legislation would have no jurisdiction to review a determination
of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. We do not consider that either of these suggestions
should be adopted.
369. We have considered whether the problem could be solved by conferring power on the
Commonwealth Court to declare a basic wage operative throughout Australia, while retaining
all other powers of the State tribunals.
370. The following quotation from the Judgment in the Living Wage (Storemen and
Packers’) Case (2 S.A. I.R. at p. 114) is relative. The President of the Industrial Court of South
Australia referred to “ the desirability of providing some machinery which will fix the living wage
for Australia with due regard to the problem as a whole, and to particular conditions, such as the
cost of living, in each State or locality. While such machinery need not involve a sacrifice of
Industrial Court autonomy, it would simplify materially the complexities of the industrial
situation as it prevails now and as it prevailed in 1916.”
371. A study of that question has led us to the conclusion that the retention of “State
Industrial Court autonomy ” might easily prevent the effective operation of the Commonwealth
basic wage. For example, if, in accordance with present practice, the Commonwealth tribunal
fixed the basic wage as applicable to “ unskilled ” workers, the State tribunals might determine
with regard to almost all industries, that there were no employees in such industries to whom the
Commonwealth wage was applicable.


Sec. 9. —The Basic Wage.—Standard of Living, Conditions, &c.
372. It would be impracticable, in the Statute conferring power to fix a Commonwealth
basic wage, to enumerate every occupation to which such wage is to apply.
373. The State tribunals might “ find ” some degree of “ skill ” in all the classes of workers
appearing before them, or some other reason for granting a margin above the Commonwealth
basic wage, thus practically leaving that wage entirely without effect.
374. In our opinion, .therefore, authority to declare a Commonwealth basic wage could
be made effective only by vesting in the Commonwealth Parliament exclusive power of industrial
legislation.
375. Class of worker. —The term “ basic ”, as Mr. Justice Higgins pointed out in his
criticism of the finding of the Basic Wage Commission of 1920, implies that it is a wage which
will afford a reasonable standard of living for the “humblest class of worker.” In the decisions
of some of the State tribunals, the term “ unskilled worker ” is used, but the concept is the same.
376. It would appear, however, that since the amending legislation of 1926, this
distinction has been discarded in New South Wales, and that the Industrial Commission, in
determining the standard of living, has accepted the view of the Basic Wage Commission, viz.,
that the standard should be determined “ not by reference to any one type or group of employees,
but by reference to the needs which are common to all employees.”
377. This involves a vital departure from the hitherto accepted theory of basic wage-fixation.
The nominal standard* of living of an unskilled worker, and of a skilled worker, each of whom
has a wife, and three children, cannot be the same unless each receives the same wage. This
being impossible, for obvious reasons, industrial tribunals fix the basic wage on that family unit
for an unskilled worker.
378. The skilled worker is given a higher wage which will enable him to live on a higher
standard, money being the only common measure which can be applied by wage-fixing tribunals.
How much higher this standard will be depends entirely upon his capacity, willingness, and
opportunity, to increase his margin of skill, or the value of his service.
379. It follows that if some tribunals determine the standard of living for the “ unskilled
worker ” and other tribunals determine the standard for a “ skilled worker ”, the results arrived
at would be very different. This difference, when reflected in wages, would inevitably result in
discontent, and consequent industrial unrest.
380. From these considerations, we arrive at the conclusion that basic wages throughout
Australia should have reference to the needs of unskilled workers.
381. Family unit. —Witnesses appearing before this Commission repeatedly claimed that
child endowment should be kept entirely separate from wage-fixation, on the ground that
“ wage-fixation is an industrial matter ”, whilst child endowment is a “ social obligation ”.
382. In making this distinction, those witnesses have, however, not been actuated by any
puristic desire for merely literary accuracy. Their aim is sharply practical. They seek to
establish as a right that child endowment shall be super-imposed upon basic wages fixed
in accordance with existing methods. The claim is illogical, because, while asserting the
necessity for a divorce between child endowment and wage-fixation, they cling to a wage, an
important part of which consists of an allowance for children. They neglect the implication,
necessarily involved in their claim, that the allowance should be struck out of the wage.
383. A great objection to existing methods of basic wage-fixation (including as they do
full endowment for some children) is that they require the choice of a family unit as an essential
preliminary to the determination of the wage.
384. Whatever unit be chosen, the wage fixed for that unit necessarily gives to workers,
whose family obligations are less than those of the adopted unit, a wage more than sufficient to
provide for the needs of their families on the assumed standard. (The chief advocates of child
endowment have not complained of this result.) But, in the case of workers whose family
obligations are greater than those of the adopted unit, the wage fixed is, ex hypothesi,
insufficient to provide for the needs of their families on the same standard. Inequality at this
end of the scale is the foundation of the claim presented to the Commission for the establishment
of a scheme of child endowment for all dependent children, super-imposed on the endowment
already provided in the basic wage.
* The real standard varying indefinitely between families with the same money income, is greatly dependent upon the health,
energy, efficiency, and general outlook upon life of the family.


Sec. 9. — The Basic Wage.—Standard of Living, Conditions, <&c.
385. Since the adoption by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court of the principles of the
Harvester Judgment in 1907, thebasic wage which provides for the needs of a man, wife, and three
children is also the basic wage paid to the unmarried worker ; to the married worker without
children ; to the worker with one child ; to the worker with two or more children. It follows
that the single man receives for his labour a wage sufficient to provide, not only for his own needs,
but also for the needs of a non-existent wife, and three non-existent children. In the case of a
married couple with no children, the wage is sufficient to provide for the needs of three non-existent
children. The wage for a married couple with one child is sufficient to provide for the needs of
two non-existent children, and where there are two children, for the needs of one non-existent
child.
386. To give effect to the claim for the complete separation of wage-fixation from child
endowment, it would be essential to abolish the power, possessed and exercised by all tribunals,
Commonwealth and State,* to assume the existence of children when fixing the basic wage. To
include in the basic wage an allowance for two, or for three children, and in addition to endow all
children is to provide double endowment for the children whose needs are provided for in the
wage.
387. As we have pointed out (paragraph 179), the established practice of the Commonwealth
Court is to assume that the basic wage worker has to provide for himself, wife, and three children.
The Queensland Statute expressly requires the Court to adopt this family unit of man, wife, and
three children. In South Australia, the tribunal has interpreted the Statute as necessitating
the adoption of the same unit. In Western Australia, the Court has construed the Statute as
necessitating the adoption of a family unit of man, wife, and two children. It follows that
elimination from existing basic wage systems of provision for children would require an alteration
in the Statute law of Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia, and a legislative
•direction to the Commonwealth Court to adopt a unit in which children are not included. The
evidence of Sir Robert Garran (Q. 20193-20198) seems to indicate a lack of legislative power in
the Commonwealth Parliament to give such a direction.
388. Victoria and Tasmania have no Industrial Tribunals, but have adopted wages boards
systems. These States could, if they so desired, pass legislation appointing wage-fixing tribunals,
and conferring powers similar to those possessed by the tribunals in other States.
389. As to the family unit, and the class of worker for whom a basic wage is to be declared,
we have arrived at the conclusion that these should be definitely fixed once and for all, not by a
judicial body, but by legislation operating throughout Australia. Even if (under existing
conditions) the different States passed uniform legislation prescribing a certain unit and class
of -worker, each State would retain power to alter such legislation at any time, thus imperilling
the whole system.
390. In our opinion, uniformity in the determination of—
(1) the family unit, and of
(2) the class of worker for whom the basic wage is to be declared, is of cardinal
importance. These determinations should be made under exclusive power
by the Commonwealth Parliament.
391. Standard of living. —In the Industrial Statutes of New South Wales and Queensland,
and in judgments of Australian basic wage fixing tribunals, the term “ standard of living ”
occupies a prominent position.
392. The phrase was coined by Industrial Tribunals in the course of the evolution of the
living wage doctrine, which followed the adoption, by the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation
and Arbitration, of the principles of the Harvester Judgment. Finally, the phrase appeared
in State Industrial Statutes, first in the Queensland Act, and then in the New South Wales Act
of 1926.
393. The Commonwealth Court, having selected “ the humblest class of worker ” as the
type, and the family of a man, wife, and three children, as the unit, proceeded to ascertain the
“ needs ” of such a family. Mr. Justice Higgins indicated the nature of those “ needs ” as
follows : —“ Surely the State in stipulating for fair and reasonable remuneration for the employees
means that wages shall be sufficient to provide those things (food and shelter) and clothing, and a
condition of frugal comfort estimated by current human standards.” (2 C.A.R. page 4).
394. Otherwise defined, the “ needs ” of the “ humblest class of worker ” are represented
by the “market basket” of the “[above-mentioned] commodities and services.” (Stabilizing
the Dollar. —Irving Fisher, 1920.)
* New South Wales, since 1927, is an exception,


Sec. 9. —The Basic Wage.—Standard of Living , Conditions, <&c.
395. The basic wage is nominally the sum of money which will enable the worker to
purchase that “ basket ” of commodities and services.
396. In order that the Tribunal may be in a position to arrive at a conclusion, it may be
necessary to hear evidence as to what the contents of the “ basket ” should be, and as to cost.
397. The Australian “standard of living ” is commonly conceived as something which,
if not actually tangible, is at least definitely measurable or ascertainable, and theoretically is
more or less uniform and permanent.
398. But the inclusion of that item in Statutes, or its adoption in practice by Industrial
Tribunals, has produced unfortunate results.
399. The meticulous compilation of lists of commodities and services seems, with
apparent inevitability, to lead to claims being continually asserted which go beyond the bounds,
not only of justice, but of possible realization.
400. Extravagant and indefinitely extended lists are submitted, proceedings unduly,
prolonged, and expense unreasonably increased.
401. These extravagances and exaggerations are by no means wholly due to any real
necessity for supporting claims by evidence. They will be stimulated and enlarged in cases
where the tribunal 'publishes in its judgment a detailed schedule of the items which it selects
as constituting the “ standard of living.”
402. However appropriate such a method might be for estimating the cost and scale of
supply for institutions of a military or bureaucratic character, it seems unsuited for use in
determining the requirements of private households. It appears to disregard the elements of
flexibility and individual skill, of efficiency and adaptability, which characterize the activities
of competent housewives. Again, it ignores those varieties of individual taste and choice which
are inseparable from the management of their homes by a free people. There is at all times a
high degree of elasticity in the individual interpretation given by members of the community, of
what constitutes for them a desirable and practical regimen within the limits of a given income.
403. The method also tends to ignore the absolute change in regimen which at time
occurs in a marked degree. A striking example of this has taken place in the United States where
according to recent statements, the consumption of meat has decreased during the last few years
to the extent of about 16 lb. per annum per head of the population. The foods substituted are
said to be cereals, fruit and vegetables.
404. Regimen examinations by Tribunals, the construction of detailed lists with prices
and the continual re-opening of such matters, have the effect of deflecting public opinion from
the desirability of encouraging “ homecraft ” (one of the most valuable of all our arts) and of
setting up as the desirable aim what may be described as the “ factory-made and delicatessen
standard.” Particularly is this the case where the tribunals give detailed prominence in their
judgments, to the items upon which they declare the basic wage.
405. The President of the Industrial Court of South Australia dealt with this matter
as follows : —“ The appellants (employees) argue that while adjustments of the living wage might
be made by reference to the cost of the more important items, such as food, groceries, and rent,
a more detailed allocation of the living wage into its constituent elements was both practicable
and desirable It was conceded, that as a matter of expediency, any
detailed allocation made by the Court need not be incorporated in a final judgment.” (3 S.A.I.R.
at page 264).
406. As far as the evidence discloses, no tribunal, other than the New South Wales
Industrial Commission, has ever published details of its determinations, beyond a dissection of
the declared basic wage under the heads of Food, Clothing, Rent and Miscellaneous.
407. To “ determine,”* is, we submit, not synonymous with to “ declare ”* that is to
announce publicly.
408. But in any case, a separate announcement of the money cost of the items in the
“ indicator list ” of the so-called standard of living does not appear to serve any good purpose.
If the items comprising the standard are necessary to provide for the “ needs ” of the worker,
the cost thereof must, ex hypothesi, be the basic wage.
409. Some of the factors which should be taken into account when fixing the basic wage
are the items representing “ needs,” capacity of industry to pay, the possible effect of the
declared wage upon inter-State trade, upon unemployment, and upon production.
* Vide the New South Wales Act.


Sec. 9. — The Basic Wage. — Standard of Living, Conditions, &c.
410. A Statute* which imposes a duty upon a Tribunal to “ determine ” a standard, and then
to “ declare ” a living wage based upon that standard may be prescribing an impossible process.
The unrealities which may follow an attempt to apply such a process are illustrated by the action
of the New South Wales Industrial Commission in 1926, when it “ determined ” a standard of
living at £5 6s., and “ declared ” a basic wage of £4 4s.
411. The duty to “ determine a standard ” is, in any real sense, a duty to fix a basic wage.
A standard is wrapped up in every wage. Apart from crystallization in a wage, the
“ determination ” of a “ standard ” is as impermanent and futile as a decree “ writ in water.”
But, the announcement of an unrealizable “standard ”, though fleeting and useless for any
good purpose, is permanent and dangerous in its fatal power to excite discontent and bitterness.
412. So long as it is a real or assumed duty of Industrial Tribunals to “ determine ” a
“ standard of living,” provision must be made for periodic re-consideration of the “ standard.”
As aptly pointed out by the New South Wales Industrial Commissioner, to re-determine the
standard of living say every six months, “ would be to deprive both employers and employed
of the stability and security which it has been from the outset one of the objects of industrial
arbitration to achieve A standard which changed every six months could
hardly be called a standard ” (1927 Judgment.)
413. We are of opinion that except under stress of serious emergency, a Standard of living
(i.e., a basic wage) once fixed should not be capable of being altered oftener than once in five years.
Even after the expiration of five years, it should be left to the tribunal to decide whether an
alteration of the standard is necessary and economically desirable.
414. The disappearance of the term “ standard of living ” from Industrial Statutes, and
from Industrial litigation, would constitute a minor, but not a negligible reform. We recommend
the elision of the term.
415. If, however, it be decided that determination of a “ standard of living ” be continued
as a part of the process of basic wage fixation, it is, in our opinion, essential that all powers in
relation to that determination be vested in a Commonwealth Tribunal, exercising the exclusive
industrial jurisdiction throughout Australia, which we recommend.
416. The Doctrine of Vested Rights. —A doctrine has been promulgated in the June, 1927,
Judgment of the New South Wales Industrial Commissioner that, once a standard of living has
been “ expressed on the living wage level ”, the worker obtains a “ vested right ”f to the
enjoyment of that standard. Expressed more concretely, this means a vested right to receive
not less than that declared basic wage. It would also appear (to be contended) that such
“ vested right ” -cannot be interfered with except by legislation. In our opinion, the application
of this doctrine involves the impossibility, apart from price index adjustments, of ever reducing
a declared basic wage, except by express legislation.
417. Since that judgment, we find claims made by employees, echoed in speeches delivered
in the New South Wales Parliament, accepting and pressing this doctrine.
418. We deemed it advisable to obtain the opinion of learned Counsel, and accordingly
placed the matter before Sir Edward Mitchell, K.C., Mr. Owen Dixon, K.C., and Mr. Maurice
Blackburn, as follows : —
A Statute gives a Tribunal the power and function to determine not more
frequently than once in every six months a standard of living, and to declare what shall
be the living wage based upon such standard.
Pursuant to the Statute the tribunal determines a certain standard and in the
following year again sits to exercise such power and functions.
Can the employees who are affected be said to have a “ vested right ” to enjoy
the standard of living determined in the previous year, so that while such standard
may by the new determination be maintained or increased, it cannot be lowered.
419. In reply, Sir Edward Mitchell said, in effect, that such a vested right would not exist,
unless it had been explicitly granted by a legislature possessing plenary powers.
420. Mr. Owen Dixon said, that in the circumstances stated, the employees who are
affected cannot be said to have any legal right, vested or contingent, “ to enjoy the standard
of living determined in the previous year, so that while such standard may by a new determination
be maintained or increased, it cannot be lowered.”
* e.g., the New South Wales Amending Act No. 14 of 1926.
f This term has been defined as “ the legitimate right to obtain something for nothing.” (Veblen —Place of Science in
Civilization .)


Sec. 9. — The Basic Wage.—Standard of Living , Conditions , &c.
421. Mr. Maurice Blackburn said : —“ I should not say that the employees affected would
have “ vested rights ” as suggested by this question.”
422. We accept those statements of the law.
423. The following illustration shows how unfairly the “ vested right ” doctrine would
operate. The Queensland Tribunal on one occasion fixed a higher basic rate for the sheep
industry, on account of its prosperity being above the average, and a lower basic wage for the
cattle industry, on account of its prosperity being below average. The higher basic wage allowed
the recipients to enjoy a higher standard of living. The lower wage necessarily entailed a lower
standard. If the prosperity of the sheep industry changed for the worse, and the prosperity
of the cattle industry for the better, the wage and the standard of living for the cattle industry
could be raised, but an application of the “ vested right ” doctrine would prevent the tribunal
from lowering the wage and the standard of the sheep industry.
424. It seems to us that the worker can no more be said to have a “ vested right ” in a
certain wage (assumed to represent a particular standard), than can the employer be said to
have a “ vested right ” to obtain the labour of the worker at a wage which shall never exceed
the wage so fixed.
425. In our opinion, the doctrine of “ vested right,” as applied to wages, is so dangerous
that its application to industrial determinations should be excluded by appropriate legislation.*
426. Basic Wage. —Even if all tribunals set out to declare a basic wage for the same class
of workers, the probability of their arriving at different conclusions can be readily understood.
Those conclusions might differ, not only as to the “ commodities and services ” deemed necessary
to provide a “ frugal standard of comfort,” but also as to the amount of money which will purchase
such services and commodities.
427. The variations in basic wages declared from time to time by Industrial Tribunals
would probably have been much greater but for the expressed disinclination of State tribunals
to create differences great enough to affect interstate trade.
428. Each of the seven different tribunals has independent power, either expressly or
implicitly, to determine a standard of living, from which to deduce a basic wage. The difficulties
created by the independent and unrelated powers of those tribunals are discussed in some of the
industrial judgments. We quote from a judgment of Dr. Jethro Brown (when President of the
South Australian Board of Industry) : —“ The Board feels impelled to draw the attention of the
Minister of Industry to the menace involved to industrial peace, stability, and efficiency, as
a result of the non-existence of material for harmonizing basic wage rates throughout Australia.”
(7 S.A.I.B. paragraph 219 at page 222). See also paragraphs 317 and 324.
429. One Tribunal Necessary. —Whatever criticism may be made of details in relation
to determination of the basic wage, the salient fact which emerges from our examination of
industrial legislation and practice, is that (unless the system of compulsory wage fixation is
to disappear altogether) uniformity, i.e., determination of the basic wage by one tribunal
(necessarily a Commonwealth tribunal) for the whole of Australia, is a primary necessity.
430. The legislation creating that tribunal should confer power to determine a basic wage,
and in subsequent proceedings to maintain, to increase, or to lower such wage as the tribunal
thinks just.
431. In conferring the necessary powers and functions on the tribunal, language should
be used much more definite and explicit than that used in the existing States’ legislation. Such
an expression as “ the normal and reasonable needs of the average employee ” can only lead
to an endless discussion and disagreement as to the conclusions arrived at. 4 Normal ’ is difficult
to interpret with mathematical precision. ‘ Beasonable ’ is a question-begging epithet. In
any case, the two terms have to be read as complementary. The term ‘ average employee ’
is an abstraction comparable in elasticity with that concept of the ‘ average ’ man to which
generations of judges in Civil and Criminal Courts have sought to give a workable approximation.”
(Dr. Jethro Brown, 3 S.A.LR. page 221.)
* Since the above was written, we have read the judgment of the New South Wales Industrial Commission, composed of
three judges, which replaced the Industrial Commission appointed in 1926.
Piddington, </., re-affirmed his 1926 Judgment from which we have quoted. Street, J and Cantor, J., expressed a contrary opinion.
Street, J., said:—“ The doctrine of ‘ vested right ’ seems to me to be wholly inapplicable in this case.” Cantor, J., said :—“ My
view is that the question of what standard of living should be adopted as a living wage standard was left .... entirely to the
Commission and , , , , the principle of ‘ vested right ’or the reason underlying it has no application whatever.”


Sec. 9.— The Basic Wage.—Standard of Living, Conditions, &c.
432. Once a basic wage is determined, it should automatically be re-adjusted periodically,
in accordance with the rise or fall in the cost-of-living figures. The tribunal should have power,
whenever it thought proper, to review the method adopted in arriving at such figures, so as
to ensure the adoption from time to time of the best possible method.
433. The tribunal should also have exclusive power to determine hours of labour and to
establish systems of payment by results.
434. If it should be said that the consideration of these questions is outside the terms
of reference, we would submit the following :—
435. It seems to us that the claim for Child Endowment rests on the doctrine of “ needs.”
It is said that the “ needs ” of the children are not provided for because the income of the wage-
earning parent is not sufficient to provide such “ needs.” The adoption of any reasonable means
of increasing the effective wage of the parent will obviously decrease the necessity of calling
upon the community to assist in providing for the “ needs ” of the children. The proper
maintenance of his children is, in the first place, an obligation of the father, and it is only after
he has done his best to provide for his children and has failed, that an obligation is cast upon the
community to come to his assistance. It is better that the worker should be given the opportunity
of earning more money and thus by his own efforts providing for the needs of his children, than
that he should seek the assistance of the community. Such assistance, granted in the form
of payment of money not earned, and even though the terms “ charity ” or “ dole ” are not
used, remains, in fact, a gift.
436. In substance, “ wage fixation ” (under existing methods) and “ child endowment ”
would react upon each other, and hence, for the present purpose, may be considered branches
of the same subject, rather than two distinct subjects.
437. In order to prevent a somewhat irresponsible competition of one branch with the
other, as would inevitably happen if one tribunal dealt with Child Endowment, and another
with basic wage fixation, it is essential that both should be placed under the exclusive control of
one tribunal.
438. That such competition would certainly operate, is shown by the following extracts
from speeches made when the Child Endowment Legislation was before the New South Wales
Parliament: —
439. Dr. Evatt. —“ On the assumption that 5s. per week is allowed in
respect of each child, .then Mr. Piddington in making future awards will have to consider whether
5s. a week is sufficient in respect of the children of employees in industry. It will certainly
be contended before him and probably be admitted by him that it is not sufficient, and if he does
decide that, his award will be made accordingly ....... we need not consider
what Mr. Piddington may do in the future, but he will still have to decide whether the 5s. a
week allowed by the State in respect of a child is a sufficient allowance, and if he decides that it
is not sufficient, then he will have to increase the basic wage accordingly.” (page 1172.)
440. A persistent claim has been made before the Commission that a system of child
endowment should be super-imposed upon the existing basic wage. No particular basic wage
was selected. The difference in range at the present time is considerable, the lowest wage
apparently being about £3 15s. 6d., and the highest about £4 8s. 6d.* We consider, quite apart
from the financial aspect, that such a claim is illogical and unjust.
SECTION 10.
HAVE EFFECTIVE WAGES INCREASED?
441. The affirmative answer to this question (which appears to us the correct answer) is
relevant to a discussion of the capacity of wage-earners to provide for their children without
additional payment in the form of child endowment.
442. Several witnesses appearing before the Commission, in referring to wages fixed by
Arbitration Tribunals, complained that increases granted have been based only upon increases in
the cost of living, and therefore, do not represent any improvement in the effective wage. This
position is contested by Mr. P. J. Pringle, on behalf of the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures,
who said that, since June, 1922, the standard created by the Harvester Basic Wage has been
gradually raised by the Arbitration Court, so that, at the present time, Basic Wage Workers are
enjoying an increase in effective wages amounting to nearly 15 per cent.
* See Q. 24691.


Sec. 10. —Have Effective Wages Increased.
443. Before proceeding to Mr. Pringle’s proof of his statement, we may refer to two
matters relating to the Harvester Judgment, 1907, mentioned by Mr. Justice Powers in the Gas
Employees Case (1921). His Honour pointed out that “ the 7s. per day then declared by the
Court was not a finding by the Judge against the claims of the Unions, but one against the claim
of the employers The Unions claimed 7s. per day as a fair and reasonable
living wage at that time. The President granted the full claim asked for.” His Honour also
said that, by that determination the President of the Court had raised the standard of living by
about 27 per cent.
444. The items composing the increase of 16 per cent, were stated by Mr. Pringle as follows
“ (1) In June, 1922, Mr. Justice Powers added 3s. to the Harvester Basic Wage,
for which there was no justification whatever.
(2) The Basic Wage is still being varied according to the cost of food, groceries,
and rent, which constitute approximately 60 per cent, of a workers’ expenditure.
Since 1922 the cost of clothing and miscellaneous, representing the 40 per cent, balance
of expenditure, has been increased or varied at a very much lower rate than the above
60 per cent., yet the basic wage has been fixed on the assumption that the cost of
clothing and miscellaneous has exactly followed the variations in the cost of food,
groceries, and rent.
(3) The awarding of a weekly wage has required the payment of full wages on
all Public Hobdays when no work is done.
(4) Certain awards of the Court (and the practice is extending) provide for six
days per annum sick leave without any loss of wages.
(5) The provision of annual holidays on pay has now become general. The value
of this cannot wholly be classed as an increase in effective wages ; it, however,
constitutes some increases in the same.”
445. Mr. Pringle went on to say that the effect of the above items on the Harvester Basic
Wage for Australia (30 towns) is to cause increases in effective wages, with the weekly values as
set out: —
Increase in Effective Wages, Third Quarter, 1927.
0/ o Weekly Value
Increase. S. d.
1. Due to commodities other than food, groceries, and rent,
having risen at a very much less rate .. .. 6.67.. 53
2. Due to unjustifiable addition of 3s. per week to Harvester
Basic Wage .. .. .. .. .. 3.80 3 0
*3. Due to nine days Statutory Holidays per annum on pay .. 3.18 .. 2 6
13.65 .. 10 9
*4. Due to provision of six days sick leave per annum .. 2.11 .. 1 8
15.76 .. 12 5
446. “ Applying Nos. 1, 2, and 3 to Melbourne only, the increase in effective wages and the
weekly value is increased to 15.49 per cent., and 12s. 5d., respectively, and applying Nos. 1, 2, 3
and 4, the figures are further increased to 17.67 per cent, and 14s. 2d.
447. “ The above increases in effective wages amounting to 12s. 5d. per week provide
additional endowments for two to two and a half children, based on 5s. per week per child. The
Melbourne basic wage gives a still greater provision.
448. “ The recent practice of the Federal Arbitration Court is approximately the standard
adopted by State Industrial Tribunals.
449. “ The above examination only relates to the basic wage man. All increases in
* Margins for Skill ’, which are constantly occurring, constitute a further material increase in
effective wages the cost of which is not included in the above calculation.
* Money values assigned by Mr. Pringle to these items are not taken into account by the Commonwealth Statistician in calculating
the movement of wages.


Sec. 10. —Have Effective Wages Increased.
450. “ If the items 1 to 4 were generally in force, it would represent approximately some
£40,000,000 per annum increase in real or effective wages, which has accrued to the workers
during the last six years, making no allowance for unemployment or margins for skill. As a
conservative estimate take it at £30,000,000. In other words, this additional huge sum has been
available to them per annum to purchase commodities and luxuries which they have never
previously enjoyed. Obviously, this amount is a tax on industry.”
451. The above statements by Mr. Pringle were confirmed, at least as to the main contention,
by Mr. C. H. Wickens, the Commonwealth Statistician. Mr. Wickens said 1 “ In actual fact
in recent years, the main increases have been in the selected 60 per cent., the remaining 40 per
cent, being very nearly constant. The effect of this has been to produce the type of result
described by Mr. Pringle. Mr. Pringle has pointed out that conversely if the selected 60 per
cent, decreased by Is., the corresponding wage would decrease by Is. 8d. This again is quite
equitable if the excluded 40 per cent decreased proportionately, for then there would be
diminished cost over all of Is. 8d. If, however, the 40 per cent, remained constant in price, a
reduction in cost of Is. would be accompanied by a reduction in wages of Is. 8d There
is no doubt that there is a good deal of force in what Mr. Pringle has to say, and I am entirely
in accord with a great deal of it. I have not checked his figures through, but there is undoubtedly
a great deal of truth in the principles which he is enunciating. The effect is what he says it is,
but it only has that effect under the peculiar circumstances operating at present. In the days
before the war, clothing, which was not included as one of the items for changes in the cost of
living, was rising more rapidly than other items, and there was a strong claim that clothing
should be included. Since 1920, clothing has been either standing still or coming down a little,
while the other things have been going up since the big slump in 1921, and there has been no
serious urge that there should be an alteration made.”
452. Mr. Wickens’s comment does not touch the item known as the “ Powers ” 3s. per
week (para. 444), which Mr. Pringle considers to be an unjustifiable addition to the Harvester Basic
Wage. With regard to this, Mr. Atlee Hunt, Public Service Arbitrator, said (Q. 11908) : —“ I
took the wage which was current outside, excepting the 3s., which I have never regarded as
justifiable on any grounds.”
453. The New South Wales Industrial Commissioner, in his Declaration of the 27th June,
1927, spoke of this 3s. in the Federal Basic Wage as a “ spurious ingredient” which “came into
a certain award fortuitously.”
454. In a case before the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, August, 1928, in which a
claim was made by employees in glue and gelatine factories for an alteration of the basic wage,
His Honour, Judge Lukin said : —“ The sooner the question is inquired into and a determination
is arrived at, the better ; particularly in regard to not only the basic wage, but also the 3s. extra,
so that the Judges will be able to give some reason for imposing that 3s. It may be quite all
right. It may be that the basic wage is insufficient and that the 3s. is necessary to bring it up
to the proper rate, or it may be even that the 3s. is insufficient; but if the basic wage is correct
now and there is no present justification for the 3s., the 3s. would have to go.”
455. In view of the evidence of Mr. P. J. Pringle, and the confirmatory statement of Mr.
C. H. Wickens, the Commonwealth Statistician, there seems no room for doubt that effective
wages have increased.
SECTION 11.
ENDOWMENT FOR WIVES AND CHILDREN EMBODIED IN BASIC WAGES AND IN
TAXATION SYSTEMS.
456. Basic Wages— As we have pointed out, the various wage-fixing methods of the
Commonwealth Arbitration Court, and of all the wage-fixing tribunals of the States (except
New South Wales since the passing of the 1927 legislation) provide for the endowment of
the children of wage earners.*
457. These tribunals have not deemed it necessary, when declaring the basic or living wage,
to say definitely that so much of the sum determined represents the allowance made in respect
of the children comprised in the family unit for which such wage is declared. It appears to US
that no good purpose would be served by making such an allocation, and, as these decisions are
final and not subject to appeal, the making of an allocation, in which different tribunals might
conceivably work on different lines, could only lead to fruitless arguments and comparisons, to
uncertainty and discontent.
*The distribution is so unequal that while provision is made for many non-existent children, many existent children are
inadequately provided for. (See paragraph 556, also paragraph 595.)


Sec. 11. — Endowment for Wives and Children embodied in Basic Wages and in Taxation Systems.
458. In our opinion, Family Endowment to the extent indicated under the heading “The
Family Unit ” (paragraph 295) is incorporated in the basic wages fixed by the various Industrial
Tribunals. (The special position in New South Wales is discussed in paragraphs 233-239).
459. The present position has been well stated by the New South Wales Industrial
Commissioner (I.G. Vol. 30, p. 1441)“ Both in the Federal system of Arbitration and in the State
system the employer does now finance Motherhood Endowment, but the fact is camouflaged.
Motherhood Endowment is paid by the employers for two children in the New South Wales and
Western Australian systems, but for three children in the rest of our Arbitration systems. This
is because the law now compels the employer to pay a wage to each adult employee, in which wage
is wrapped up the Child Endowment to two or three children.”
460. Taxation systems. —In arriving at the amount of the taxable income, concessional
deductions on account of children are allowed in the Commonwealth and all State taxation schemes.
In some States a deduction is allowed on account of a wife. The amount of income tax which is
thus saved can, we think, be regarded as equivalent to Family Endowment.
461. The amounts of such deductions from taxable income are: —
Commonwealth—
£50 for each child up to sixteen years of age.
New South Wales—
£50 for each child up to eighteen years of age.
Victoria—
£50 for each child up to sixteen years of age on incomes up to £801.
£50 for a wife if —
(a) her income does not exceed £100 per annum ; and if
(b) the husband’s income does not exceed £800 per annum.
Queensland —
£50 for each child up to sixteen years of age on incomes up to £801.
£40 for a wife if—
(а) her income does not exceed £26 per annum ; and if
(б) the husband’s income does not exceed £800 per annum.
South Australia—
£30 for each child up to fifteen years of age on incomes up to £651.
£50 for a wife if —
(а) her income does not exceed £50 per annum ; and if
(б) the husband’s income does not exceed £650 per annum.
Western Australia—
£62 for each child*up to sixteen years of age.
Tasmania—
£39 for each child up to sixteen years of age.
462. These deductions from taxable income if limited to persons possessing incomes not
exceeding, say £300, would have no great effect as Family Endowment. But if, as many
witnesses have urged, there should be no limitation of income, the deductions would become of
importance in cases where the family is large and where the income exceeds, say £400. *
SECTION 12.
CHILD ENDOWMENT.
A. BASIS OF CLAIMS—HOW FAR SUPPORTED.
463. Our Terms of Reference require us to consider the desirability of instituting a system
of Child Endowment or Family Allowances.
464. The term “ Family Allowances ” connotes endowment—
(a) for a wife ; and
(b) for dependent children.
465. Evidence submitted was almost entirely confined to consideration of child endowment
466. While not recommending Child Endowment, we have reached the conclusion (paragraph
600) that if Child Endowment be established, the most suitable family unit to be adopted in
determining a basic wage is man and wife. This excludes the idea of treating the wife as a separate


Sec. 12. — Child Endowment. — A. Basis of Claims.—How far Supported .
economic unit on the pay-roll of the State. As Professor Gray points out ( Family Endowment ,
page 106), that idea involves a claim that —“ It is to the State that the woman renders a service
in bearing a child, and it is to the State that she is justified in looking for sustenance and reward
while she is doing the State’s work.” He further says (page 108) :—“ Once it is definitely
accepted that child-bearing is a service rendered to the State, a very powerful solvent is
introduced into family life as we know it.”
467. For that, and other reasons stated by Professor Gray in the work cited, and for other
practical reasons, we are opposed to a scheme which would treat a mother as a salaried servant
of the State, by virtue of her child-bearing. In the sections of this report which follow we have,
therefore, invariably used the term, and discussed the subject of, Child Endowment.
468. The nominal basis of the claim in Australia for a scheme of Child Endowment is the
alleged insufficiency of wage or income to provide adequately for children of large families.
469. The Commission found a tendency on the part of many witnesses to assume that
all, or nearly all, the people with large families were on the basic wage, or had incomes not greater
than that wage. The facts placed before the Commission did not, in our opinion, justify that
assumption. The President of the New South Wales Board of Trade, in the Declaration of the
8th October, 1920, pointed out “ that by far the larger proportion of the population received
a wage rate higher than the prescribed living wage. The wage rates for mechanics and the
majority of their assistants and of nearly all partially skilled labour are above the basic declaration.
Those in receipt of the basic living wage are confined mainly to limited numbers of employees
in comparatively regular employment in hotels, restaurants, and businesses engaged in the
supply and distribution of foodstuffs, to lift attendants, watchmen, and men engaged in the
least skilled forms of labour in continuous industries. In the majority of well-defined industries
in the State (New South Wales) by far the larger proportion of employees are paid at rates
higher than the declaration.”
470. Figures relating to the State Railway systems and those supplied by other large
employers show that the great majority of employees receive more than the basic wage. In the
New South Wales Railway and Tramway systems, for instance, with more than 52,000 employees,
13,595 receive from £4 10s. to £4 15s. per week, and 38,839 receive over £4 15s. per week.
Somewhat similar proportions apply to the Railway systems in other States. In Victoria, with
over 20,000 employees, about 3,000 receive the basic wage, and all others receive much more ;
13.000 receive more than £4 15s. per week.
471. With regard to South Australia, striking figures were supplied as to the whole of
the male employees of the Government, numbering 104,553. Of this total 7,209 are receiving
the State basic wage of £4 5s. per week, 13,598 have a wage between £4 5s. and £4 10s. per week,
20,192 from £4 10s. to £4 15s. per week, and 63,287 receive over £4 15s. per week.
472. In a number of large enterprises conducted by companies, the figures of which were
supplied, it appears that the adult male employees receive more, often much more, than the
basic wage. It seems quite the exception to find adult male employees in private employ who
do not receive more than the basic wage.
473. The figures quoted (para. 487) relating to the number of applications for Child
Endowment in New South Wales, in respect of the families of such groups as coal miners, coal
lumpers and wharf labourers, suggest that the incomes in these groups must, in the majority
of cases, exceed the basic wage, plus £13 per annum for each dependent child under fourteen
years of age.
474. In each State, the Commission sought evidence which might support the suggestion
that insufficiency of wage is a general cause of any existing distress amongst children. The
Chairman, at the request of the Commission, made in each State a public statement to the following
effect: —
“ The Commission wishes to refer to a question to which little attention has
been given by witnesses, viz., whether the dependent children of workers, with large
families, in reasonably constant employment, receiving the basic wage or thereabouts
are, to any appreciable extent, affected by the inability of their parents to provide for
their reasonable requirements. The Commission feels that there may be societies
or persons working amongst, or interested in the welfare of, the poorer classes of the
community, who would be able to give valuable assistance in this respect. We are
particularly anxious to obtain evidence on these lines, and we thought that by calling
special attention, as we have done in each of the cities at which we have sat, we might
get some good results by mentioning the matter.”


Sec. 12.— Child Endowment. — A. Basis of Claims. — How far Supported*
475. Not only was that announcement made, but in each State capital the Commission
sought out witnesses who would otherwise not have attended, in the endeavour to secure evidence
on the lines indicated in the above statement. As a result, evidence was obtained from a number
of organisations working among the poorer classes of the community, but that evidence failed
to support the view that mere insufficiency of wage is a cause of distress among the children of
workers in reasonably constant employment. Many witnesses in each of the States spoke as
to the existence of distress among children, but nearly all of them negatived insufficiency of wage
as the cause. They assigned other definite causes such as unemployment, sickness, accident,
gambling and extravagance, drink, want of suitable housing accommodation, excessive rent,
widowhood, and wife desertion.
476. Inefficiency of the mother was mentioned as frequently affecting the well-being
of her children.
477. The term “inefficiency” was, however, not to be taken as implying that in the
majority of cases the mother was not desirous of doing her best for her children, but that through
lack of knowledge and training in domestic economy, hygiene, and food values, she was unable
to make the family income go as far, or produce as good results, as it would have done had she
the necessary knowledge.
478. It is apparent that payment in cash would not provide a remedy in cases where
distress among children is due to drinking, gambling, or extravagant habits of one or both of the
parents. It might even happen that, in such cases, the receipt of money would accentuate the
evil. No estimate is possible of the number of cases coming under these three heads, but they
are probably not insignificant in number.
479. Where distress among children is caused by sickness of, or accident to, the bread-
winner, we are of opinion that the remedy should be sought under a scheme of insurance, in
preference to granting relief under a scheme of Child Endowment.
480. Two of the causes most deeply affecting family well-being are the 'difficulty of
obtaining suitable housing accommodation and the excessive rents which often have to be paid.
Witness after witness spoke of the evil effects attributable to these two causes.
481. The first requires no elaboration, as it is obvious that slum conditions prejudicially
affect family life, not only from the point of view of health, but also from the point of view of
character and moral well-being.
482. Under the second head, it is clear that the necessity of diverting a large proportion
of the family income to pay for shelter, makes a serious inroad into the amount otherwise
available for food and clothing. The amounts paid for rent vary in the different capitals, but
generally speaking, rents are high.
483. Unemployment, including casual employment, is a much more difficult question.
484. Dealing first of all with casual employment, it must be remembered that wage
tribunals when fixing the wage, take into account the seasonal or casual nature of the occupation.
For instance, the pay of wharf labourers is determined on the basis of 44 hours’ pay for 30 hours’
work. The worker is, therefore, paid for 14 hours each week during which it is assumed he will
not be employed.
485. Such groups of workers as wharf labourers, coal miners and coal lumpers represent
relatively intermittent forms of employment. The fact of such intermittency is often assumed,
without sufficient justification, to be an inevitable cause of more or less chronic distress among
the families of such workers.
486. Instances of this occurred when the Child Endowment Legislation was before the New
South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1927, as shown by the following quotations from Hansard :—
“ The coal miners for the last two years have not earned an amount equal to
the basic wage, so what is going to become of their children ? ” (Per Mr. Lysaght, page
1187.)
“ Many of these people do not earn the basic wage every week, many are casual
workers such as wharf labourers, coal lumpers, many who work in and around the mines.”
(Per Mr. Tonge, page 1187.)
“ The coal miners have no basic wage, they are not averaging £3 10s. a week,
and there are 30,000 of them.” (Per Mr. Lysaght, page 1306.)
F.24/28. —5


Sec. 12. —Child Endowment. — A. Basis of Claims.—How far Supported.
487. The [Commission was induced by the above' statements to ask Mr. Treble, the
Commissioner administering the Child Endowment Act, to furnish the respective numbers of coal
miners, coal lumpers and wharf labourers in New South Wales, and the percentage of those
persons whose wives have applied for Child Endowment. The figures supplied were as follows:—
1. (a) Number of coal lumpers in the State .. .. .. 800
(b) Number whose wives have applied for endowment .. 129
Representing a percentage of .. .. ..16.125 per cent.
2. (a) Number of wharf labourers in the State .. .. 6,404
(6) Number whose wives have applied for endowment .. 421
Representing a percentage of .. .. .. 6.577 per cent.
3. (a) Number of coal miners in the State .. .. .. 24,000
(b) Number whose wives have applied for endowment .. 1,650
Representing a percentage of .. .. .. 6.874 per cent.
488. After making allowance for the percentage of unmarried and childless workers in
those industrial groups, the figures seem strongly to support the Endowment Commissioner’s
opinion, that the-chief cause of the low aggregate of applications under the Act is that the great
majority of wage-earners have incomes exceeding the basic wage, plus £13 per annum for each
dependent child.
489. In our opinion, the claim for Child Endowment based upon alleged insufficiency of
wage among workers is untenable.
490. In the Australian community, as elsewhere, there is a residuum of cases in which
special assistance to children is needed. Those cases can be dealt with by existing agencies,
extended where necessary, as recommended in another part of this report. (See section 14.)
491. To set up a general scheme of Child Endowment to deal with this small residual
percentage in the community would, in our opinion, be both unnecessary and unjustifiable.
B. OPINIONS OF ECONOMISTS.
492. Witnesses, representing many interests, who have urged upon us the adoption of
a scheme of child endowment, have generally looked to Commonwealth taxation as the source
of the necessary funds. Some of the schemes propounded have been fantastically irresponsible,
and impossible to treat seriously.
493. Within the region of studied moderation, we have had the valuable assistance of
several learned economists. The theoretical foundation of much of their evidence is to be found
in their acceptance of the doctrine which was thus stated by Professor R. C. Mills of the University
of Sydney : —“ The general effects upon distribution must be pronounced good from the economic
point of view in so far as inequality of income is reduced, for it is generally admitted that the
present high degree of inequality [of income] is economically bad. But, those effects are only
good, if on balance, they are not outweighed by other effects upon production.”
494. Professor Pigou in his “Economics of Welfare,” page 78, referring to the increase
in the aggregate sum of “ satisfaction ” which might be brought about by transference of income
from a relatively rich man to a relatively poor man of similar temperament says : —“ The old
law of ‘diminishing utility ’ thus leads securely to the proposition : any cause which increases
the absolute share of real income in the hands of the poor, provided that it does not lead to a
contraction in the size of the national dividend from any point of view, will, in general, increase
economic welfare.”
495. In another work, “ Wealth and Welfare ” Professor Pigou, speaking on the same
subject says: —“ Generally speaking, a transference of resources from the relatively rich to the
relatively poor brought about by interference with the natural course of wages at any point, is
unlikely to do otherwise than to injure the national dividend and therewith in the end the real
income of the relatively poor.”
496. The question of the amount of transference of income which might be made without
affecting adversely the total of the national dividend, or producing other unwelcome effects,
was dealt with by several of the economic witnesses.


Sec. 12. — Child Endowment. — B. Opinions of Economists.
497. Professor Alcock of Brisbane, for example said, (Q. 1678) “ Allowances to be worth
making at all should be fairly substantial, but they should not be so large as to destroy
responsibility. I am disposed to regard 2s. 6d. to 3s. per week per dependant, as a fairly satisfactory
figure, having regard to the preceding sentence Responsibility is learned
at home. Under universal suffrage the only guarantee of stability is in the personal sense of
responsibility.”
498. Professor Alcock thought that for such a provision, contributions would have to be
drawn both from industry and from general revenue. His reasons for thinking tax-subventions
necessary were, to relieve wages of cost of administration, to reduce inequality of contribution
between efficient and inefficient industries, and also for the purpose of providing for non-employees
with inadequate incomes. The Professor also said, (Q. 1726) that he was not convinced that
it is necessary at all to have a system of child endowment, but a wisely-framed system with
suitable safe-guards, might cause an improvement in standards.
499. With regard to the effects of taxing industry to provide endowment, Professor Alcock
pointed to the dangers of increasing unemployment to an extent that would outweigh the gains
.of endowment. He said : —“ An extra 5s. added to the basic wage might cause anything from
a 30,000 to an 80,000 increase in the number of unemployed.”
501. Professor J. B. Brigden (Hobart) thought that no scheme of Child Endowment is
practicable that does not transfer something from wages, but that taxation is also required. He
pointed out that what is known as the “ Powers 3s. ” which has been added to the Harvester
equivalent, is a sum available for transference, as tc it is not at all necessary on any cost of living
basis for man without dependants.”
502. He did not, however, suggest the transference of more than 2s. of that amount from
the weekly wage, partly because, in his opinion, that might be sufficient to begin with, and partly
because workers might be called upon for other contributions by way of provision for health
and unemployment insurance. This amount of 2s. per week, or £5 per annum per wage earner,
would produce, he estimates, about £5,500,000 per year if it could all be collected, and provisionally
he suggested an addition of £2,000,000 from taxation to provide endowment of 2s. per week
for children of non-wage-earners. Questioned as to whether the scheme advocated by other
witnesses, which would involve doubling the present income taxes, was practicable, he said:—
(Q. 12887) “ Certainly not. I do not think you would get the money. Any attempt to get
it would bring chaos into our economic system.” (Q. 12888) “ Including unemployment ? ”
(Answer) “ Yes, very much so.”
503. Mr. G. L. Wood, Senior Lecturer in Economics, Melbourne University, was of
opinion that “ the diversion of portion of the National dividend for the purpose of increasing
the efficiency of the poor, would yield a return exceeding that received on the part of the dividend
invested in capital goods.” He said, however, that there was no guarantee as to any amount
provided by way of Child Endowment being used in the best possible way to promote the
efficiency of the recipients and their families.
504. On the question of the transference of the “ Powers 3s.” from wages to endowment
fund, Mr. Wood thought that (Q. 22621) “ the worker having received
3s. for so long, it has come to be regarded as part of the wage. I believe the industrial friction
which would arise from any attempt to tamper with it, for this or any other purpose, would
be serious.”
505. Mr. Wood thought that additional Commonwealth taxation amounting to say
£6,000,000 for the purpose of providing Child Endowment was “ a sum which appears to be well
within the resources of the community.”
506. His proposal was that such a sum should be used to provide Child Endowment as a
flat rate of £10 per annum per dependent child, excluding the first two children in a family. The
sum of £6,000,000 would be sufficient to provide endowment at that rate for 600,000 children,
a number a little in excess of all dependent children in Australia, irrespective of the parents’
income, if the first two in each family are excluded. (See paragraph 566.)
507. Professor D. B. Copland, Professor of Commerce, Melbourne University, thought
that a scheme of endowment going rather beyond the scale of Professor Bridgen’s proposal (which
involves £2,000,000 from taxation) might be adopted. He thought also that (Q. 23986) ....
“ if you are going to have a Child Endowment system based on taxation, there should be some
re-distribution of wages for single men That would make the thing fair
in its incidence.”


Sec. 12.—Child Endowment. — B. Opinions of Economists.
508. We have carefully considered these opinions of economists as well as those of other
witnesses, and think that as to schemes dependent upon funds provided by additional taxation,
the question resolves itself into a dilemma.
509. If additional taxation is to be the source of the necessary funds a scheme of Child
Endowment on a scale sufficient to provide full cost of maintenance, appears to us to be
practically an impossibility. If attempted, it would, we think, cause economic disturbances
and losses (especially through unemployment) greatly outweighing any possible benefits derivable.
If on the other hand, the so-called “ modest ” scheme commencing with say 2s. or 2s. 6d. per
week, were adopted, we are of opinion that the effect would be simply to bring into being a neW
and prolific cause of industrial disputes, with incessant demands for increases, either direct as
endowment, or through manipulation of the basic wage. This matter is further referred to in
paragraph 645.
510. One statement with regard to the additional amount of taxation which might be
raised in Australia should be mentioned. That is contained in a passage in Mr. (now Dr.)
Benham’s recent book “Prosperity of Australia,” page 80, where the statement is made that
£50,000,000 per year might be raised in additional taxation without imposing an undue burden.
Dr. Benham did not appear before us, but this statement in his book was referred to by more than
one witness.
511. Professor R. C. Mills (who first mentioned Dr. Benham’s statement) was questioned
as to the amount of taxation which might be imposed for endowment purposes. We quote
from the evidence :* (Q. 17151) —“ As you consider £4,500,000 would not be immediately
practicable, what portion of that sum would you consider within the competency of the nation
to find immediately ? ” (A.) “ That is a very hard question to answer. For this particular
purpose I think we could find something not more than £10,000,000, or less than £5,000,000 ;
it is very vague I know.” (Q. 17164) “ If we had only £8,000,000 to spare I think at any rate
the greater part of it would be better expended in a scheme of unemployment insurance.”
(Q. 17168) “ I simply said from £6,000,000 to £10,000,000, because it is an extraordinarily
difficult thing to estimate.”
512. Professor Mills also expressed the opinion that if such a sum as £10,000,000 were
raised by additional taxation, probably the best proportions in which that money might be
expended would be say £6,000,000 for unemployment insurance, and £4,000,000 for child
endowment, or £7,000,000 for unemployment insurance and £3,000,000 for child endowment.
(Q. 1765.)
513. Professor Copland (Evidence page 2248) referring to Dr. Benham’s proposal said: —
“ Expenditure upon public works from funds raised by taxation has many advantages from this
point of view, and Dr. Benham was doubtless thinking of this when he made the assertion that
£50,000,000 a year might be raised in taxation without imposing an undue burden.”
“ I think the figure of £50,000,000 is quite out of the question, because the community
as a whole would not be seized with the national importance of this method of financing public
works and would probably feel that sound developmental works were being unduly unrestricted.
Without agreeing to this high figure, I think Mr. Benham’s contention is in general terms sound
and that Australia should save a greater proportion of her national income.”
514. We quote further from the evidence of Professor Copland : —(Q. 23983) “ You will
not have Professor Benham’s £50,000,000 a year taxation ; have you any idea of the extreme
limit as to the amount that could be raised ? ” (A.) “ No, I have not come to any definite
figure at all, and I think that a definite figure is out of the question, because, as I have already
explained, the limit will be altered according to a number of different conditions, one of which
is the community’s belief in the expenditure proposed.” (Q. 24038) “ With regard to Mr.
Benham’s views on the capacity to bear further taxation, you suggest that he is thinking primarily
of desirable objects of expenditure. With regard to direct taxation, particularly, do you think
any objects of expenditure whatever, would justify increasing the direct taxation to the extent
he suggested ? ” (A.) “I should say not during peace time.”
515. The text (p. 80) of Dr. Benham’s proposal reads as follows : —
“ There is another course possible, but it would be most unpopular. It is,
compulsorily to increase the actual saving of the community by greater taxation. At
present little more than 12 per cent. (£75,000,000) of the home produced income
of Australia is paid in taxation. In England the percentage is said to be nearly 20 ;
* Copies of the book were not then available.


Sec. 12. — Child Endowment. — B. Opinion of Economists.
and in other countries such as France, to be still greater. Australia probably has a
larger possible ‘ margin for saving ’ per head than such countries. This indicates that
an additional £50,000,000 a year might be raised by taxation without imposing an undue
* burden. ’ (It is not suggested that the whole of this additional sum need be raised
for immediate purposes.) Part of it could be used to reduce the debt and part for
purposes indicated in the final chapter of this work. ”
516. We suggest that the premise in the above argument that, for the purpose in question,
Australia can be properly compared with such countries as England and France, cannot sustain
the conclusion which is based upon it. A relatively small, densely populated country, the capital
equipment of which may be said to be. complete cannot, in our opinion, be reasonably compared
with a very large, scantily occupied country like Australia, so much of the capital equipment
of which has yet to be created.
517. Dr. Benham goes on to deal with the sources from which the money might be raised.
He says : —“ As I have mentioned the somewhat staggering figure of £50,000,000 a year, it is
perhaps advisable to go further and indicate the chief sources from which it might be raised.
At present, nearly half the total taxation is provided by customs and excise duties. Although
these duties ‘ pluck the goose with the least squealing 5 they are regressive ; they impose a heavier
proportionate burden upon the poor than upon the rich. Additional taxation should be direct
rather than indirect, and should fall most heavily upon those best able to bear it. This points
to greater income taxation (yielding at present less than £4 per head of population per year)
and to greater estate, probate, and succession duties (yielding about 10s. per head at present).
Income taxation is at present much less steeply ‘ progressive ’ than in England for example.
It might well be made much heavier in the upper reaches, and especially upon incomes of £5,000
a year and more. ”
518. It will be seen that Dr. Benham turns to direct taxation upon incomes of £5,000
a year and more, as the chief source from which to raise the additional sum of £50,000,000 per
annum.
519. Let us consider first the State probate and succession duties “yielding about 10s.
per head at present.” The present population of the Commonwealth being about 6.3 millions,
and the total Commonwealth and State tax collections in connexion with estates of deceased
persons being about £4,300,000, that figure of 10s. per head is not quite accurate. It would
be more correct to say nearly 14s. per head. But in respect of taxes of this kind, a statement
of the amount per head of population is almost meaningless. The combined rates of Commonwealth
and State taxation upon estates of deceased persons reach fairly high figures. If we assume
that those rates were even doubled (and it is unlikely this would be suggested by any responsible
authority) the utmost additional return from those sources would be about, say, £4,500,000,
leaving, say, £45,000,000 of the suggested amount to be raised from other sources.
520. Companies are not specially mentioned as subjects of the suggested additional
taxation. From that fact, and from the emphasis upon the “ steeply progressive ” scale (under
the taxation laws of the Commonwealth and of most of the States, companies are taxed at a
flat rate) it may be inferred that Dr. Benham had in mind incomes of individual taxpayers, as
the source from which most of the additional £50,000,000 should be raised. Another fact
supporting that inference is that every increase of taxation upon the profits of companies is
likely to reduce pro tanto the taxable income of individuals.
521. We assume then, that as to income taxation, we are to look to the individuals “ in
the upper reaches ” and especially to those having taxable incomes exceeding £5,000 per annum.
If, by nearly doubling their present taxation, absentees were called upon to provide an additional
£1,000,000, resident individual taxpayers would be called upon to furnish the balance, say
£44,000,000. Let us examine the capacity of those individuals to provide that sum in addition
to the present taxation.
522. For the latest information we turn to the eleventh Report of the Federal Commissioner
of Taxation (page 40) which shows that the total taxable income of resident individuals for the
year 1925-26 was £107,000,000. Of the incomes exceeding £5,000 the total taxable income was
£16,000,000. Of that sum about £2,700,000 is taken by Commonwealth income taxation, leaving
only £13,300,000 from which any additional tax could be drawn. Hence, if the whole of that
balance of taxable income were confiscated, it would provide less than one-third of the amount
whch Dr. Benham thinks might be raised “ without imposing an undue burden.”
523. If incomes of £5,000 and upwards are exhausted, obviously we must go further
down the scale.


Sec. 12. — Child Endowment — B. Opinions of Economists.
524. Additions to the present rates, equivalent to an all-round increase of 10s. in the
£, would perhaps constitute the utmost limit which even tax fanaticism would suggest. If we
assume the imposition of such a scale, we find that in order to raise the balance, £44,000,000
{see para. 521), it would be necessary to apply those new additional rates to all individual incomes
exceeding about £350. The stupendous assumption that such a scale is practicable, ignores the
great diminution in taxable capacity of the individuals concerned, which would immediately follow
its imposition. It ignores also the paralysis of enterprise which would ensue, and which would
cause an overwhelming flood of unemployment.
525. Many other modes of analysing the proposal suggest themselves, but it is probably
unnecessary to develop them.
526. Dr. Benham’s proposal is not lacking in audacity. It drives a salient of excess into
the territory of moderation. No subtle penetration was needed to perceive its psychological
effect upon some of our witnesses.
527. That is one of the reasons why we have thought it necessary to treat the text au
grand serieux and to subject it to the disintegrating impact of ineluctable facts.
528. That duty discharged, we view the text from another angle.
529. A learned and public-spirited doctor looks out upon his world. He sees his fellow-
citizens narcotized by indulgence in a prolonged course of borrowing, and needing to be startled
into the re-assertion of their virile capacities. Shock seemed the only tactic.
530. But bomb-throwing, even of economic bombs, is a dangerous pastime.
531. It might destroy some things which even the most humourous of economists would
wish to preserve. It might shatter the confidence of the community in the sanity and wise
insight of its leaders in economic science.
532. That would be a serious loss to the community.
533. It would not be a gain to the economic leaders.
C. IF CHILD ENDOWMENT ESTABLISHED SHOULD THERE BE A COMMONWEALTH
SCHEME OR SEPARATE STATE SCHEMES?
534. Witnesses appearing before the Commission, who supported the establishment of
Child Endowment, unanimously favoured a Commonwealth scheme in preference to State schemes.
With few exceptions, they expressed their preference for schemes involving cash payments such
as that operating in New South Wales.
535. No witness before the Commission supported the establishment of State systems of
Child Endowment.
536. One of the main objections to separate State systems is the strong probability,
amounting almost to certainty, that there would be a lack of uniformity. Diversities of system
would create difficulties similar to those created by the lack of uniformity in wage fixing legislation
and in the practice of industrial tribunals. In addition, those diversities would accentuate the
difficulties now resulting from varying systems of wage fixation.
537. In the 1926 Living Wage judgment in New South Wales, the Industrial
Commissioner said : —“ It may be said at once that the question of motherhood endowment is
ultimately one for the Federal Parliament rather than for any of the State Parliaments, because
of the obvious difficulty of any one State providing a full system of family allowances as an
adjunct to the living wage, and thus putting its own producers and manufacturers at some
competitive disadvantage under a Constitution which postulates inter-State free-trade.”
538. The argument in the above passage for Federal, rather than State control, applies
equally whatever form State schemes may take.
539. New South Wales witnesses claimed that even the comparatively small sum, £l ,250,000,*
actually levied on industry to finance the provisions of the New South Wales Child Endow-
ment Act for the first year, placed industry in that State at a disadvantage in competing with
adjoining States. The estimated cost of the scheme as originally introduced was £7,750.000.
The effect of such a burden placed upon industry in New South Wales and not placed upon industry
in Victoria, need not be discussed.

wai suspended after the first fourteen weeks.


Sec. 12. — Child Endowment. — C. Should the Scheme he Commonwealth or State.
540. The difficulty mentioned by the Industrial Commissioner would be obviated if all
States were prepared to establish Child Endowment schemes with uniform rates and conditions,
but in that case a much simpler method would be for the States to refer the matter to the
Commonwealth Parliament pursuant to the provisions of Section 51 (xxxvii) of the Constitution.
541. For the reasons stated above, we are opposed to State schemes of Child Endowment.
If, however, the States, or some of them, are desirous of establishing their own schemes (which
are very unlikely to be uniform in character) they should, in our opinion, carry the consequential
financial obligation. We think that the Commonwealth Parliament should not grant assistance
to the States in the financing of State schemes of Child Endowment.
542. While, as between a Commonwealth scheme and separate State schemes, a
Commonwealth scheme would, in our opinion be preferable, we are also opposed to a Commonwealth
scheme of Child Endowment, because we believe that public moneys, if any available, can be more
beneficially expended upon welfare services, (paragraph 698.)
543. But if, contrary to our view, a Commonwealth scheme be proposed, then, in our opinion,
conditions precedent to its establishment should be
(1) that any existing State legislation instituting a scheme of Child Endowment
should be repealed ;
(2) that the Commonwealth Parliament should have first obtained full and exclusive
power —
•(a) to control wage fixation, and “industrial matters ” as defined in
Industrial Statutes ;
(b) to establish and control Child Endowment.
D. PROVISION OF FULL MAINTENANCE.
OBJECTIONS.
544. The institution of a system of Child Endowment, which, as a supplement to wages,
would provide the full cost of maintenance for each dependent child, is open to grave objection.
Involving, as it would, a high increase of taxation, almost certainly of direct taxation, we are
satisfied from the evidence, and from a consideration of the present economic position of Australia,
that the result would be to check progress, to increase unemployment, and to reduce the sum of
human welfare in the community.
545. On the social side the main objection is, that if the State relieves parents of all
financial responsibility for every dependent child in the family, the sense of parental responsibility
and the incentive of parents to do their best to prepare their children for the full life of citizens
in a free State would be seriously weakened. That incentive is so invaluable, and if removed, so
irreplaceable, that any course likely to have the effect of destroying it, in whole or to a material
degree, would be a sacrifice of one-of the best elements in the character of the people.
546. On the economic side, the effect on the father would be much more apparent
in a probable slackening of energy, than in the case of the mother. It would be
dangerously easy for many fathers to slacken off in their own efforts, and to pass into a condition
of careless acquiescence in a system which made their children, at least from the financial point
of view, wards of State. The price of this easy acquiescence would be the loss of much of that
virile and strenuous independence of character, and ready acceptance of the whole responsibility
for his children, which are among the most admirable characteristics a man can possess.
547. A scheme of Child Endowment may indeed eorrode incentive just where it is
particularly desirable for incentive to be maintained in full strength, that is among skilled workers.
Under the New South Wales scheme, for example, a skilled worker with three children, receiving
the basic wage, plus a margin for skill of 15s. per week, or in all, £260 per annum, finds that the
unskilled worker with three children would receive, in wage plus endowment, exactly the same
sum. The skilled worker with that rate of pay is debarred from participating in the endowment
fund.
548. From the point of view of the mother, many instances might occur in which the
financial relief brought about by the payment to her of the sums granted by way of Child
Endowment, would be seriously discounted by a withdrawal from her of portion of her husband’s
wages, which formerly he had always handed over for the up-keep of the household. No one
contends that this would be the universal experience, or that it would be likely to happen in the
majority of cases. But, in the opinion of several witnesses, and in our own opinion, it would
probably happen in so many instances as to create a new evil in family life and would lower,


Sec. 12. — Child Endowment. — D. Provision of Full Maintenance — Objections.
instead of raising, the standard of independence of the mother, and the standard of comfort of
the family. We believe also that it would cause a diminution in the sense of unity of interest between
husbands and wives, and an increase in the number of deserted wives. Opinions of witnesses on
this point are somewhat conflicting. This is not surprising, as the results of such an experiment
cannot be predicted with an approach to certainty.
549. If the rate of payment in any scheme purporting to provide endowment for each
dependent child is avowedly, or obviously, insufficient to provide the estimated full cost of
maintenance, it seems certain that there will be an unceasing demand for an increase up to the
point of full cost. Where, indeed, a scheme is founded on a re-distribution of wages, so that the
unit of wage-fixation is the individual worker, it would be both logical and necessary to provide,
in addition, the cost of maintenance of each existing dependent child.
550. It is clear from the Parliamentary Debates which occurred in New Zealand and New
South Wales when the respective Endowment Statutes were under consideration, that in spite
of the endowment-components in the basic wage, continuous pressure would be brought to bear
upon Governments to increase the amount granted under the Child Endowment Act, up to the
estimated complete cost of maintenance of each child.
551. In New Zealand, for example, where the scheme is designed to provide for endowment
(not whole cost of maintenance) for each child in the family beyond the second, it was
emphatically stated in Parliament, that the Labour Party would use every possible opportunity
to push the scheme further, with the object of giving to the children in every family (of more than
two*) full maintenance.
552. In Australia, evidence submitted to this Commission in every State, on behalf of the
Labour movement, includes definite claims that no reduction whatever shall take place in the
basic wage for the purpose of providing endowment, and that in addition to the basic wage, which,
admittedly, is partly made up of provision for children, there should be endowment of every
dependent child to the amount necessary for its complete maintenance.
553. Every Industrial Tribunal in Australia has experience of the manner in which the
needs of large families are continually urged, as a reason for raising the wage of the family man,
which wage, however, under the present system, must also be granted to the single man. One
form in which this claim is often presented ifc that the Tribunal should adopt a higher family unit
(three children instead of two, where two has been the basis.)
554. If Child Endowment as a gage of battle, is to be tossed into the arena of the present
Industrial Tribunals, disputes will inevitably increase in. number, and in intensity. Such results
will indeed follow, although the schemes may differ in detail; for example, they may embody
endowment for all children in excess of one, of two, or of a greater number. (A note on another
phase of schemes of this kind appears in paragraphs 581-584.)
555. It may, we think, be regarded as certain that if a scheme of Child Endowment be placed
upon the Statute Book, providing endowment for dependent children at a rate less than the full
cost of maintenance, it will be only a matter of time when incessant pressure will cause the raising
of the amount up to full cost.
556. This point is further illustrated by the following extracts from the New South Wales
Parliamentary Debates (1927) on the Family Endowment Bill.
557. The Honorable A. C. Willis, speaking on behalf of the Government in the Legislative
Council, 23rd February, 1927 {see New South Wales Parliamentary Debates page 1473) said : —
“The allowance per child should be at least 11s. if the basis is adopted of what is regarded as
right for a family allowance. Some have criticized us from that point of view ; they say the
scheme is not scientific. Well, there had to be a jumping-off place But if under
this proposal the single men may be getting something more than what would be their rightful
proportion, on a scientific basis, they are getting it at the expense of children who are not getting
what they are entitled to. Those children are getting not 11s., but only 5s., and it is at their
expense that the single men are getting more.”
558. Mr. Willis also said 1 “ You have built up for a single man a basic wage higher than
is scientifically warranted. What is more, the Commissioner holds that under your basic wage
system, you are providing for thousands of children who do not exist. But as against that,
and because of your system, you are unable to provide a proper allowance for those who do exist.”
* The New Zealand scheme is designed {see paragraph 121) to provide assistance in the maintenance of children beyond the
number of two in any family.


Sec. 12. — Child Endowment. — D. Provision of Full Maintenance — Objections.
559. Dr. Evatt, K.C., a Ministerial supporter., had previously said in the Legislative
Assembly that: —“ Mr. Piddington does not commit himself to the principle that 5s. per week
is sufficient to properly provide for a child. This Government has not said that. If this
Government could provide more it would do so.”
560. If the conception of “ needs ” which plays a dominating part in both the theory and
the practice of our basic wage tribunals, is to retain its dominant position, it should be applied
with more justice and discernment. The “ needs ” of the numerous family (at one end of the scale)
has long been the main lever by which the unmarried and childless man (at the other end of the
scale) has succeeded in raising his own wage to the present level. But if justice is to rule our
conception of wage distribution, and if the measuring rod of “ needs ” is to be applied to the
family unit consisting say of five persons, it must equally be applied at the opposite end of the
scale to the single man and to the married man without children.
561. Using the familiar idea of an index number, and taking the number 100 as representing
the needs of a family of five persons, it requires no argument to support the assertion that the
index number representing the needs of the single man would be much less than 100 ; perhaps
•not exceeding the number 60.
562. We cannot think otherwise than that, if a general scheme of child endowment
supplementary to an unreduced basic wage, and providing full cost of maintenance be established,
it will not be very long before the question of fully preserving parental incentive in relation
to the children will be a lost cause.
563. This compels us also to the further conclusion that an essential condition precedent
to the establishment of any scheme of child endowment provided by public funds, should be a
reduction of the basic wage by elimination of the provision for children which is now an integral
part of that wage.
564. Logically the reduction should be carried to the point at which the wage would
reasonably provide "for the needs of the individual worker only. Blit for practical reasons,
[see paragraph 600) we think the unit to be adopted for the purpose of such reduction, should
be man and wife.
E. ENDOWMENT SCHEMES, EXCLUDING ONE OB MOBE DEPENDENT CHILDBEN.
565. Suggestions have been made by witnesses before the Commission that a scheme of
Child Endowment might be established, which would exclude those children whose needs are
provided for in the basic wage.
566. Exclusion of the first two children. —The result of a Commonwealth scheme of Child
Endowment which excluded the first two children would be as follows. We deal first with the
Commonwealth and all States other than New South Wales.
567. In families covered by Commonwealth Arbitration Court Awards, by Awards of the
State Tribunals in Queensland, and South Australia, and by Wages Boards Determinations in
Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania, the third child would be fully provided for
in the family wage and would in addition be specifically endowed.
568. To avoid double provision, it would be necessary for the Commonwealth, Queensland,
South Australian, Victorian and Tasmanian Wage Tribunals to reduce their respective basic
wages by the amount included therein for the third child.
569. If the amount included for each child in the basic wage be taken at 11s. (as implicit
in the 1926 determination of the New South Wales Industrial Commission) it follows that the
basic wages of the Commonwealth, of Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania
would have to be reduced by 11s. per week so as to cover the needs of two children only instead
of three as at present. This would place the basic wage of these tribunals at £3 14s. or thereabouts.
570. Summarizing, the effect on basic wages would be : In Commonwealth Awards, and
those of Queensland, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania, a decrease from say £4 5s. to £3 14s.
571. In Western Australian Awards, the present basic wage of £4 5s. would be unchanged.
572. Dealing now with the position in New South Wales.— In all families covered by State
Awards and Determinations, the first two children would be excluded, not only from provision
in the wage, but also from endowment.
573. The legislative change necessary would be to amend the Industrial Arbitration
{. Living Wage Declaration ) Act 1927, by including two children in the Statutory family unit
which at present consists of man and wife only.


Sec. 12. — Child Endowment. — E. Endowment Schemes, excluding one or more Dependent Children.
574. As we have mentioned above (paragraph 223) the New South Wales Industrial
Commissioner in his 1926 judgment pointed out that the basic wage then declared at £4 4s. per
week provided a standard of living for a man, wife, and one child. The legislature in amending
the Act, might, of course, give a specific direction to the Tribunal that the provision for one
child in that wage should be eliminated and that (in accordance with present index figures)
provision should be made for two children in the family unit. If the absence of specific Statutory
direction on that point, the Tribunal might, perhaps, feel bound to. act as if such a direction were
already sufficiently supplied, and provide an amount of maintenance for two children on the basis
above-mentioned, 11s. per week per child.
575. If such an elimination were not effected, but provision made for two children, the
present basic wage of £4 5s. would be raised by 22s., making that wage £5 7s.
576. Exclusion of the first three children.— The result of excluding the first three children
from a scheme of child endowment would be as follows : —
577. The Commonwealth, Queensland, South Australia, Victorian and Tasmanian basic
wages would remain as at present, say £4 5s. or thereabouts (some are slightly higher.) In
Western Australia an allowance for the third child of 11s. per week would have to be added to the
present basic wage of £4 5s., making a new basic wage of £4 16s. In New South Wales, while
the family unit provided for in the basic wage is nominally man and wife only, the rate of wage
is said by the Industrial Commissioner {see paragraph 223). to include provision for one child.
578. We must, however, in this case, as in the case above where two children were
considered, assume that the Commission would adopt the Statutory family unit of man and
wife only and make the additional provision for the relevant number of children, here assumed
to be three. This would necessitate an addition of 33s. per week to the present New South
Wales Basic Wage of £4 5s., making a new basic wage of £5 18s.
579. We have already expressed the opinion (paragraph 295) that the basic wages of
Australia generally contain provision for the first three children in a family. We, therefore, think
that if any children are to be excluded from the benefits of a child endowment scheme such a
scheme should begin with the fourth child and not with the third.
580. The difficulties which would arise in a scheme which excluded one or more children
in a family were thus commented upon by Dr. Evatt, K.C., M.L.A., in the New South Wales
Legislative Assembly : —“ I repeat that if the first child is omitted from the scheme, we may as
well tear the Bill up. It will not be a child endowment scheme, but simply the removal of the
effect of the State basic wage, in an attempt to devise a new scheme to equalize that basic wage, on
the one hand providing for one child, and the Federal Basic Wage on the other hand providing
for three children. It will lead to all sorts of inconsistencies, and if the amendment is agreed to
the Bill will be the most incoherent Bill we have ever seen. It will be absolutely impossible
to understand it either in principle or in application.”
581. At whichever of the two points in the family scale endowment began, that is, with
the third child or the fourth child, considerable alteration in the legislation of several States would
be necessary.
582. Even if, as is improbable, the great difficulties of obtaining legislation in all States
prescribing the same family unit could be overcome, the further problem of inducing a number
of independent tribunals to prescribe the same basic wage for that unit would remain unsolved.
583. Not less important would be the necessary action by the Commonwealth.
584. But here the difficulty is of a different order. The Commonwealth Parliament appears
to lack power to take its share in securing by legislation the adoption of a uniform family unit.
Even it it could legislate for that purpose, the Commonwealth Court might prescribe a basic wage
for that unit differing materially from the basic wage or wages prescribed by State Industrial
Tribunals.
585. These considerations emphasize the essentiality of a unified control of industrial
legislation.
586. Even unified control of industrial legislation by the Commonwealth Parliament would
not of itself remove the probability of friction and difficulty if—
{a) The Commonwealth Arbitration Court could make provision in the basic wage
for the first two or three children in a family, and
(6) Child Endowment for the remaining children in the family were
(1) directly enacted by Parliament as in New South Wales
or
(2) granted through a tribunal (other than the Commonwealth Arbitration
Court) established by Parliament for the purpose.


Sec. 12. —Child Endowment. — E. Endowment Schemes, excluding one or more Dependent Children.
587. That is, that friGtion and difficulty could not be avoided if there were two controlling
bodies, one-to fix a basic wage which might include provision for two or three children, and the
other to grant endowment for such of the children in a family as were not specifically provided
for in the basic wage.
588. The probable result of the existence of two independent tribunals would be the creation
of a “ vicious spiral ” of the type referred to in the 1926 report of the Tariff Board, from which
we quote the following : —
“ Immediately following upon the increase in the Tariff in regard to woollen
piece goods, passed by the House of Representatives, on the recommendation of the
Tariff Board, with a view to relieving certain sections of the industry which
were suffering detriment from external competition, the Industrial Union embracing
the operations in this industry lodged an application before the Federal Arbitration
Court for heavy increases in their wages and modified working conditions
This action of the Textile Workers Union seems to have been influenced by the judgment
of Mr. Justice Powers, wherein it was laid down that his Court would take no cognizance
of the capacity of an industry to pay certain wages, but would fix what wages it thought
necessary and the industry would then have recourse to the Tariff Board which had
been created by the Federal Parliament to make recommendations for the granting
of whatever protection was necessary. In this case, the various unions appeared before
the Tariff Board to assist the employers in obtaining necessary increases in order to
make it possible to work the mills at a profit instead of at a loss and then immediately
approached the Arbitration Court for their share of these increases.
In this way a precedent is created for passing back and forth between the Federal
Arbitration Court and the Tariff Board for increments in wages and duties, which can
only result in an ever-increasing wage rate, and an ever-ascending tariff. This course
must ultimately defeat itself, and by continually raising the cost of living bring about
an industrial paralysis.”
589. The matter is further illustrated by the following extracts from the debate on the
Child Endowment Bill 1927 in the New South Wales Parliament
Dr. Evatt. —
590. “ On the assumption that 5s. per week is allowed in respect of
each child, then Mr. Piddington in making future awards will have to consider whether 5s. a week
is sufficient in respect of the children of employees in industry. It will certainly be contended
before him and probably be admitted by him that it is not sufficient, and if he does decide that,
his award will be made accordingly We do not need to consider what
Mr. Piddington may do in the future, but he will still have to decide whether the 5s. a week in
respect of a child is a sufficient allowance, then he will have to increase the basic wage accordingly,
(p. 1172.)
591. Whether Child Endowment began with the third child or the fourth child, wage
tribunals would, in our opinion, be continually pressed to restore (at least) any part of the basic
wage which had been eliminated for the purpose of preventing double provision for one or more
children. As a consequence, the present confusion and industrial unrest caused by variations
in existing methods of wage fixation would be extended and intensified.
F ENDOWMENT .SCHEMES WITHOUT GOVERNMENT AID—UNIT FOR BASIC
WAGE- COST OF ENDOWMENT.
592. In the present Australian system, wage tribunals determine the basic wage in relation
to the “ needs ” of the worker as measured by ceitain assumed family obligations. The unit
adopted is a family unit. The logical unit for that wage, however,is the individual worker. The
adoption of that unit would involve a system of supplementary allowances, in the first place for a
wife if the worker marries, and later for each child born into the family. The allowance for
the child would be continued throughout the years of dependence, which are usually taken as
terminating at the age of fourteen. Some guide as to the relation which the allowance for the
wife should bear to the wage, may be found in a consideration of the relative food requirements
of a man and wife, as determined by physiological authorities. One the the best known of these
determinations (Atwaters’), taking the figure one as representing the food requirements of the
man, fixed . 8 as the requirements for the woman.


Sec. 12. — Child Endowment. — F. Endowment Schemes without Government Aid.
593. As an' illustration, if we take the average of the present Commonwealth and States
Basic Wages as approximately £4 5s. per week, and assume that three children at the average rate
of 7s. each are provided for in that wage, the amount remaining as representing the remuneration
for the unit of man and wife, is £3 4s. per week. That sum, distributed according to the Atwater
co-efficients for man and wife, would give £l 15s. 7d. per week as provision for the man, and
£l 8s. 5d. per week as provision for the wife. On the logic, and on the arithmetic of the case,
with the assumptions of the preceding paragraph, the wage of the single man, if the “ needs ”
theory is to govern, would be £l 15s. 7d. per week, and th$t of the married man without children,
£3 4s. per week.
594. But human affairs are not wholly controlled by logic and arithmetic. Even though
the single man is not always so conspicuous an upholder of the standard of saving as he is of the
standard of enjoyment*, there was much agreement among witnesses that he should have a margin
above the amount deducible from the Atwater co-efficients.
595. At present the wage of the single man not only includes a substantial amount for
non-existent children, but also for a non-existent wife. This is sought to be justified on two grounds
— first, it is said that the single man has to pay for some services which a wife renders her husband
without money payment. This is doubtless true, but the cost of maintaining, housing, and
clothing a wife is substantially more than the single man pays for board and lodging and clothing.
&c., plus the amount paid for other services.
596. The second ground is that the wage of the single man ought to provide a sufficient
margin to allow him to save in contemplation of marriage. The Savings Bank returns were
referred to as showing that the single man does save in contemplation of marriage.
597. We have examined several sets of Savings Bank statistics, and are of opinion that the
large extension of amounts upon which the Savings Banks allow interest, and the ever-growing
use of Savings Bank facilities made on behalf of their clients by solicitors, trustee companies, and
other finance companies, are the principal causes of the increase in deposits. It is no doubt
true that some single men save a portion of their wages, but the figures of attendances at race-
courses, theatres, picture shows, and other forms of amusement, as indicated by the amounts
paid in amusements tax, and the heavy expenditure upon tobacco and liquor, provide an
argument against the assumption that there is large and systematic saving for marriage on the
part of single men who are wage-earners.
598. The following pertinent statement on the matter was made by Dr. Arthur during the
debate on the Child Endowment Bill in the New South Wales Parliament ( Hansard , page 1177):—
“ When in 1919, the basic wage went up 17s., and every single man and married man without
children received that wage, next year it was found that the drink bill had gone up £3,000,000.”
599. While it is regettable that a large proportion of the single man’s wage seems to be
devoted to purposes less praiseworthy than that of saving for marriage, we are not unsympathetic
towards the idea that a margin for that special saving should be allowed.
600. For that reason and for other reasons of a practical character, we are of opinion that
if an Australian scheme of Child Endowment were adopted, the family unit for the purpose of
determining the basic wage should be taken as a man and wife. The single man would then
receive more than he would strictly be entitled to, as a matter of allocation of the wage to actual
“ needs,” but the scheme would approach more nearly to the idea of justice than it does at present.
601. If, therefore, the unit of man and wife were adopted in fixing the basic wage,
provision for existing children would have to be considered. In our opinion, the evidence given
to the Commission justifies the statement that maintenance for each existing dependent child
would be fully provided by payment upon a scale commencing with 8s. for the first child in the
family, the amount diminishing by Is. for each subsequent child, up to and including the fifth,
with 4s. for each child beyond the fifth. From figures kindly supplied by the Victorian Government
Statist, it appears that a fund established by a contribution from existing wages of 7s. per week
per adult male worker, would enable payment to be made in accordance with that scale, f If,
then, the wage could be re-distributed in that way, results would be as follows
(1) A basic wage of say £4 5s. would be reduced (by 21s.) to £3 4s. for each adult male
worker, married or single.
(2) Of the 21s. thus deducted from the wage, 7s. would be paid by the employer into
a fund to provide an endowment on the above scale for all existing dependent
children.
* One witness was of opinion that the special function of the unmarried wage-earner is to raise and keep flying high the standard
of “ enjoyment The unfortunate point about that doctrine is that the high standard of enjoyment of the unmarried wage-earner
in kept up at the expense of parents and children, especially in families where the children are numerous.
f The basis of the calculation is the fact that the average number of children per adult male worker is less than one, (about .9).


Sec. 12. — Child Endowment. — F. Endowment Schemes without Government Aid.
(3) Every married worker having dependent children would receive endowment in
accordance with the above scale.
(4) There would be a considerable balance in the wage-fund (using that term as
meaning the amount now paid in wages) which would be “ saved to industry.”
That amount would be 14s. per week per adult male worker. The question of
the effect (if any) upon wages of females and juniors would be a matter of
investigation.
602. A number of witnesses put forward the view that the amount so “ saved to industry ”
would simply be an addition to the profits of the employers, at the expense of the employees. This
we think is a misconception. Except in the few and probably negligible cases, where effective
competition is absent, it seems certain that a reduction in the total amount of wages paid would
quickly result in a reduction in prices, and of the cost of living, to that extent raising real
wages and improving real standards.
603. From political as well as from industrial points of view, the difficulty perhaps would
be the considerable initial reduction which this scheme would involve in the actual wage now
received by persons without family responsibilities, and to a lesser extent by those whose family
responsibilities are more than covered by the endowment elements contained in the present
wage. This difficulty is mainly outside the economic sphere. Within that sphere, material
benefits would result, and the apparent loss to a section of the wage-earning community would
be at any rate partially compensated by a decided reduction in the cost of living, while the benefits
to persons with large families would be very great. The sum of human welfare would, in our
opinion, be increased.
604. But, it might be necessary to consider an alternative. Assume that the aggregate
wage-fund is to remain undiminished, but that for the purpose of providing endowment for
children, a degree of re-distribution of that fund is agreed upon. Assume also that the degree
of re-distribution is to be the least possible consistent with providing the necessary funds for
child endowment. Using the same figures as in paragraph 601, above, a contribution from wages
of 7s. per week would provide endowment for all dependent children of workers on the scale
mentioned in that paragraph.
605. The basic wage, now averaging about £4 5s.* would then be reduced to £3 18s., the
difference 7s. being paid by the employers into a fund for endowment.
606. This we suggest opens a wide door for a scheme which in effect would be a voluntary
scheme, as it is unlikely that it will be adopted without some initial evidence of goodwill on
the part of the wage-earners.
607. We suggest that such a Ghange in the distribution of wages deserves the most earnest
and favorable consideration of wage-earners and of industrial tribunals.
608. That change, with somewhat smaller figures, has been effected in the Commonwealth
Public Service, with results which (we are assured) are considered to be highly satisfactory. We
are fully conscious of the special conditions in that service which made it easier to bring about
such a change than it would be in connection with industry generally.
609. Even in relation to the Public Service, the Tribunal might have hesitated to order
the necessary deduction from wages and salaries, unless there had been some evidence that the
change would commend itself to the organizations whose members would be affected. A
Tribunal having jurisdiction over industry throughout the Commonwealth (and this jurisdiction
would be a necessary condition) although convinced of the beneficial results that would follow,
would perhaps also hesitate to make the change, unless satisfied that it would be received with
a reasonable amount of goodwill by wage-earners. With that goodwill, founded upon a recognition
of the importance of introducing a higher degree of justice into a system which is now marred by
fundamental injustice, a valuable reform would be effected.
610. A challenge of such a reform would probably come from those who claim that Child
Endowment is a “social obligation”. By that term they intend to imply that over and above
the highest wages obtainable by negotiation, or by contests between parties in the Industrial
Courts, the community as a whole should be taxed to provide endowment for children of all
workers, at rates sufficient to provide full maintenance. A phase of the same claim is that if
the “ needs ” of the children of workers are met, or the provision for those “ needs ” supplemented
by contributions from wages of all workers, those contributions amount to a class levy, from
which members of the community better able to bear such a levy would be exempt. Such an
* The adoption of this method would not affect any movement of the basic wage either by way of adjustment in accordance with
price index figures, or as altered for other reasons.


See. 12.— Child Endowment. — F. Endowment Schemes without Government Aid.
argument has an obvious appeal, and affects the mental attitude of many. After the most serious
and sympathetic consideration of that view, we believe that it is founded upon an erroneous analysis
of the causes affecting the general level of prosperity of the workers. The heavy increase in
taxation which some of their representatives advocate for the purpose of providing Child
Endowment in addition to present wages, would not only fail to purge the present wage system
of the elements of injustice which it now contains, but would, we believe, reduce, rather than
raise, the general standards to which workers have attained.
611. If the method indicated in paragraphs 604-605 were adopted, the benefits from the
point of view of child endowment would be the same as in the scheme indicated in paragraph
601. i. e., every dependent child of workers in organized industry would be fully provided for.
But as the total wage-fund would remain undiminished, there would be no reduction in the cost of
production, nor prima facie, in the cost of living. Such a reduction in our opinion is very desirable.
612. If such a scheme were adopted, we suggest that the Commonwealth Parliament should
assist by providing the machinery and defraying the cost of administration.
613. In conjunction with that provision, the Commonwealth Parliament would probably
be impelled to consider the application of that administrative machinery to the cases of those
who,, though receiving wages, are not subject to awards ; to self-employed persons ; and to
persons who by reason of their family obligations and the limitation of their, income might,
reasonably claim to be included in a scheme. ( See paragraphs 647-648).
SECTION 12.
G. BIRTH RATE IN RELATION TO CHILD ENDOWMENT.
614. In Australia, as in France and other places, the movement for the payment of Child
Endowment has derived a large part of its strength from faith in its probable effect in increasing
the birth rate. That rate has been falling for nearly seventy years. In 1860 it was 25 per 1,000 ;
in 1926 it was 13 per 1,000.
615. A few years ago, Mr. McGirr introduced an Endowment Bill in the New South Wales
Legislative Assembly, and in the course of his speech said : —“ Motherhood endowment is based
on the fact that we want population in Australia.”
616. In The Next Step Mr. A. B. Piddington, K.G., holds the view that payment of
Child Endowment Will increase the birth rate. “ We maybe sure that reasoning from the past
into the future, when every child has an adequate living ready for it, thousands would welcome
children who now avoid them If organized on a sensible scale, the
principle of Child Endowment could, therefore, revolutionize, in a country so ill populated as
Australia, the whole outlook as far as the natural increase is concerned.”
617. Most of the witnesses who advocated Child Endowment before this Commission
expressed the opinion that it would cause a desirable increase in the birth rate.
618. In Great Britain, however, where a diminution rather than an increase of population
is desired, the advocates of Child Endowment endeavour to show that the payment of Child
Endowment will NOT increase the birth rate.
619. Miss E. Rathbone states* that “ the most reasonable and reputable objection urged
against family endowment is the fear that it may encourage early marriages and large families
especially amongst the very poor.”
620. She proceeds to consider whether the objection is justified. She states as an in-
indisputable fact “ that up to now, once the bare minimum necessary for existence has been
reached, every improvement in the standard of living of any class, has been followed by a decrease,
not an increase, in its birth rate. This is, I believe, admitted by practically every authority on
the subject.”
621. After examining the various authorities, Miss Rathbone concludes that the balance
of expert opinion is against the view that Child Endowment would cause an increase in the birth
rate.
622. Professor Vibart (Oxford)! sums up as follows “ On the whole, so far as any
conclusion may be reached, there appears to be but little reason to anticipate that the family
allowance will have any very considerable direct effect on the birth rate.”
623. Professor Alexander Gray (Aberdeen)} deals with the arguments pro and con and
appears to regard the actual result of Child Endowment upon birth rate as highly speculative.

% “ Family Endowment,” page 95 et teq.


Sec. 12.— Child Endowment. — G. Birth Rate in relation to Child Endowment.
624. It is generally accepted that the Australian standard of living at the present time
is higher for all classes than it was at the time when wage-fixing tribunals were first established.
Notwithstanding that increase in standard, the birth rate is steadily falling year by year.
625. The rapid development of contraceptive methods, and the world-wide tendency
to reduction in the number of children in a family, will probably be stimulated rather than
checked by any general increase in family incomes.
626. There seems, therefore, no reason to assume that a further increase in the standard
of living, whether made possible by an increase in wages, or by the payment of Child Endowment
in addition to present wage rates, would increase the birth rate, or even check its decline.
H. EUGENIC CONTROL.
627. If public funds are to be applied for the establishment and maintenance of a scheme
of Child Endowment and especially if such endowment is designed to provide full cost of maintenance
of dependent children, eugenic considerations which have not hitherto been regarded must be
taken into account.
628. The children who would be beneficiaries by such a scheme would, by that fact, become
in an important sense of the term “ wards of State,’ and “ assets ” entering in a somewhat direct
fashion into the national balance-sheet.
629. The authorities responsible for the expenditure of large sums of public money in
building up such assets, could hardly fail to attempt some form of eugenic control which would
tend to assure that the recipients of the national bounty shall be born of healthy parents, and
therefore, shall start life without any unfavorable handicap. This, of course, means some degree
of selective control of candidates for marriage.
630. We quote the following from evidence given by the Commonwealth Director-General
of Publio Health, Dr. J. H. L. Cumpston : —
(Q. 12,022.) —“ If the Government undertakes any system of child endowment it
must be assumed that this is an expression of the Government’s intention to treat children
as national assets . If this assumption be correct, then it is
clearly economical for the Government to concern itself with two considerations :• —
(a) that so far as possible, the right kind of children shall be born ;
(b) that so far as possible, the children who are born shall be preserved as assets to
the State.
“ In the question of assuring the birth of the right kind of stock, there is much
general misconception. The rules of heredity have not been sufficiently clarified to
permit of the enunciation of any general principles upon which a universal system of
eugenics or selective mating could be devised. In terms of general application,
therefore, it is not practicable to consider any scheme of control of marriage for the
purpose of the production of good stock. On the other hand, there are certain steps
which might be considered practicable. It might, for example, be quite possible to
require that no person with the condition of demonstrable syphilis shall be permitted
to marry ; such recognizable conditions as deaf-mutism, feeble-mindedness, &c., would
also be considered as declared barriers to legal marriage. There would be no serious
difficulty in accomplishing this in practice It is realized that such a
system would not infallibly prevent marriages of this kind, but for the most part it
would prevent the undesirable marriages under consideration
For this purpose it would be necessary that the Commonwealth should exercise its
Constitutional powers in relation to marriage and divorce, as such legislation could
only be effective if it were applicable over the whole Commonwealth. It would also
be desirable that revision should be made of the position in respect of feeble-mindedness
and the segregation and control of those individuals declared to to be feeble-minded.’>
631. Accepting that evidence as a correct .statement of the present state of knowledge
with regard to eugenics, it appears that while there may be a large difference of opinion as to
how far eugenic control could safely be carried at present, there is no doubt that up to a certain
point, expert opinion would be practically unanimous with regard to the possibility and the
desirability of applying that control. The unmistakably feeble-minded ; persons unmistakably
tainted with practically incurable forms of disease, or affected by other serious and transmissible
defects, should be prevented from reproducing their species.


Sec. 12.— Child Endowment. — H. Eugenic Control.
632. Important as this subject is, it is, in a sense, only a side-issue in our inquiry. Our
investigation was not particularly designed to elicit evidence which would form a scientific
foundation of a definite scheme of eugenic control. We think, however, that within the limits
above suggested, the creation of eugenic control should be regarded as one of the necessary
concofiiitants of any scheme which removes the financial responsibility for the maintenance
of children from their parents, and places that responsibility upon the State.
633. Within those suggested limits, such eugenic control should, in our opinion, be established
whether or not Child Endowment be accepted as a feature of national policy.
SECTION 13.
TERMS OF REFERENCE—CLAUSES 2 TO 10—GENERAL COMMENT.
634. Our Terms of Reference require that, if we recommend the institution of a system of
Child Endowment or family allowances, we shall report upon a number of matters (Clauses 2
to 10 inclusive, of the Terms of Reference.)
635. Although we do not recommend the institution of such a system, we think that, in
view of the range of evidence submitted, and in view of the possibility of the establishment at
some future time of such a system, we should briefly comment upon some points covered by
those Terms of Reference.
636. Possible varieties of family allowances may, for the present purpose, be divided into
two main groups, namely those which are independent of, and unaided by public moneys or
by moneys in any way derived from taxation, and those which are, to some extent at least,
dependent upon such aid. The methods in use in some European countries, of which we have
given a short account in the section headed “ Family Allowances in Europe,” are examples of
schemes formed outside Governmental control and assistance.
637. The scheme in operation in the Commonwealth Public Service (while it is in one
sense closely connected with the Government) is another example, as the fund from which endow-
ments are paid consists wholly of amounts deducted from salaries and wages. A special feature
of that fund is, that the deductions are imposed by authority, that is by a judgment of the Public
Service Arbitrator.
638. We read the expression “ Child Endowment or Family Allowances ” in our Terms
of Reference as meaning a system which falls within the second of our two divisions, that is, a
a system in which endowment is provided from public funds. The case in which the endowment
fund is subsidized from, but not wholly made up from, public moneys would be a variant.
639. Nearly all the witnesses who favoured the establishment of Child Endowment,
contemplated a scheme in which the fund should be wholly provided by the Commonwealth
Treasury, and be supplementary to existing rates of wages. That is the form (which while we
do not recommend it) v/e are considering in the following comments upon Clauses of the Terms
of Reference.
640. Clause 2. “The methods by which such a system could be established.”
641. This system .(assumed to be a Commonwealth system) would necessarily be
“ established by a Commonwealth Statute.
642. That statement takes for granted that the Commonwealth had acquired full powers
of legislation. Alternatively, if the Commonwealth Parliament, with its present restricted powers
of legislation, thought proper to provide the money for an endowment scheme covering the whole
Commonwealth, it might give effect to its intentions through the medium of identical agreements
made with each of the State Governments. But (see Para. 541) we think that the
Commonwealth Parliament should not finance State schemes of Child Endowment.
643. Clause 3. “The relation of such a system to wage-fixation, having regard to the
interests of the wage-earner, of industry generally, and of the community.”
644. Under other headings in this report we have dealt at length with the relation of
systems of Child Endowment to wage-fixation. We refer specially to Sections 3d, 4, and 5b.
645. A perusual of those paragraphs will show that we regard a system of Child Endowment
as closely related to wage fixation. The present system of wage-fixation definitely includes
payments which must be regarded as representing Child Endowment or family allowances. We
have shown also that in our opinion, before any system of Child Endowment should be considered,
it is imperative that exclusive control of industrial legislation be secured by the Commonwealth ;
that certain matters related to wage fixation, such as the selection of the class of workers to


Sec. 13 —Terms of Reference. —Clauses 2 to 10. —General Comment.
whom tne wages should apply, and the family unit, should be determined by the Commonwealth
Parliament. We have further concluded that the determination of the “ standard of living ”
(if, contrary to our recommendation, it be decided to retain that practice), and the declaration
of the basic wage, should be exclusively within the control of a Commonwealth tribunal. To
introduce a system of Child Endowment, while the present conflict of jurisdiction as regards
industrial matters remains, would, in our opinion, greatly aggravate the difficulties already so
keenly realized in relation to industrial matters.
646. Clause 4. “ The application of a system of Child Endowment or family allowances
to persons whose wages are not regulated by law, or who are not engaged in industry as wage-
earners.”
647. The application of a system of Child Endowment to self-employed persons and persons
who do not come within the jurisdiction of wage-fixing tribunals, offers certain difficulties which
do not exist in connection with persons whose wages are regulated by law. It would, however,
seem unwise to devise a scheme applicable only to that section of the community whose wages
are determined by Statutory Tribunals.
648. The fact that administration would be rendered more difficult by the inclusion of
persons whose wages are not so determined, should not be decisive against them. Their exclusion
would rightly be regarded as an injustice, and in our opinion, provision should be made for them
in any proposed scheme.
649. We do not doubt that the Commonwealth Treasury would be able to cope with
any consequent administrative difficulties.
650. Clause 5. “The limit of income, if any, subject to which payments by way of Child
Endowment or family allowances should be made.”
651. There was considerable diversity of opinion among witnesses who appeared before
us as to whether a limit of income should be fixed, beyond which no payments by way of Child
Endowment, of Family Allowances should be made. Those who advocated that no income limit
should be introduced, argued that the administration would thereby be greatly simplified and
cheapened, and that if an income limit were fixed, the proportion of persons having incomes
beyond that limit would be so small, in proportion to the total number of claimants, that the
added expense need hardly be considered. The absence of income limit in connection with
Maternity Allowance payments was repeatedly cited as affording a precedent which should be
followed in dealing with Child Endowment.
652. Many witnesses expressed the view that if an income limit be fixed, the endowment
payments would be regarded as a “ dole ” or “ charity.” We do not see why it should be so
regarded, and the evidence tendered to us with regard to the New South Wales scheme, in which
there is an income limit, shows that no such stigma attaches.
653. Further, it was contended that the whole claim for Child Endowment is based on the
alleged insufficiency of family income to provide for the “ needs ” of the children of families,
in which there are more than three children. A necessary consequence of the acceptance of this
contention is that there could be no justification for making endowment payments where the
family incomes are sufficient to provide for those “needs.”
654. One of the objections urged to a scheme of Child Endowment, limited to persons having
a relatively low income limit, is that the unskilled worker, with several dependent children, may
receive a total income larger than that of a highly skilled worker with fewer children, or with
none.
655. The argument is that in these circumstances, the margin for skill disappears, and that
the incentive to acquire, or to maintain and increase skill is destroyed. Such a result is felt to
be an injurious anomaly.
656. A method of avoiding this result suggested by some witnesses, would be to raise
the income limit, or to abolish it altogether.
657. The following comments may be made :—
(1) With regard to the effect upon margins for skill, it may be stated as a preliminary
point, that Child Endowment can only be regarded as having any effect upon
the margin for skill, if it is assumed that the endowment payment is part of
the wage. Viewed (as in our opinion it should be) as an independent payment
by the community to the mother of children for the benefit of the children, it
cannot, of course, be regarded as having a direct relation to wages, and
consequently, can have no effect upon the additional wage which is the reward
of the skilled worker.
F.24/28. —6


Sec. 13. — Terms of Reference. —Clauses 2 to 10. — General Comment.
(2) Further with regard to the assumed effect upon skill, two things may be said,
namely :
(a) The strongest influence operating against the acquisition of skill by
young workers is the bribe of the high wages granted to young
unskilled workers. The apprentice to a skilled trade is, of course,
gaining knowledge and manipulative ability which will be of value
to him throughout his subsequent life, but in the early stages he
must be content with less money than his unskilled contemporary
receives. Perhaps a partial solution of this difficulty may be found
by reducing the difference between the rates of pay for skilled
workers during the apprenticeship years, and for unskilled workers
of about the same age.
( b) Endowment payments are limited to the period of dependency of the
children in a family, but this limitation does not apply to the rewards
for skill.
658. Anything that stifles or reduces the incentive to acquire, or to maintain and increase
skill, is an injury to the community, and lowers the intrinsic value of the individual affected. So
far, therefore, as the introduction of a system of Child Endowment would reduce the incentive
to acquire, or to continue the application of skill, it would create an evil.
659. But, to set up a fund at the expense of the community, ostensibly for the purpose
of meeting urgent needs, but which would, in many cases, merely supplement incomes already
adequate, would be a still greater evil, and would generally be indefensible.
660. On balance then, we reach the conclusion that an income limit of eligibility should
be an essential part of any scheme of child endowment.
661. A measure of that limit may be found by assuming that, in accordance with our
recommendation (see Paragraph 600) the Child Endowment component of the basic wage has
been eliminated, and a family unit of man and wife only has been adopted, with a correspondingly
reduction of that wage. If the family income, apart from any endowment payable, does not
exceed the wage fixed for that reduced family unit, the parents should be eligible to receive full
Child Endowment, but not otherwise.
662. We refer to paragraphs 141-142, where numerical examples are given. If for the
amount of £221 shown in those examples, there be substituted the amount of the basic wage
as suggested in the preceding sentence, those examples will indicate the mode of calculating the
amount of endowment, either full or reduced, at any selected rate, and with regard to any number
of dependent children.
663. Clause 6. “ The methods of financing and giving effect to a system of Child Endowment
or Family allowances, with particular reference to the practicability and desirability of providing
the necessary funds from public revenue, from industry, or from both sources, and in what proportion
and upon what principle.”
664. The scheme we have been discussing is one which, as urged by many witnesses,
depends entirely upon provision of the funds from public revenue. In such a case, some form
or forms of taxation would, of course, be the only means of procuring the necessary moneys.
Some witnesses were of opinion that the direct taxes —Income Tax and Land Tax —should be used
for the purpose. Others expressed indifference as to whether the money were raised by those
direct taxes, or through the Customs and-Excise Revenue. The method to be pursued would,
doubtless, be always dependent upon the aggregate sums to be raised. Those sums, if the requests
of Labour representatives were granted, would be so large (see Paragraphs 39-40) that perhaps,
no single source of revenue could be depended upon.
665. A small increase in direct taxation would have a correspondingly small effect as a
factor of disturbance of business, but as their evidence shows, those advocates of Child Endowment
would not be satisfied with a small scheme. The financing of a large scheme by increased taxation
would, in our opinion, have injurious reactions, and by its effect upon unemployment and the cost
of living would, to an appreciable extent, defeat its own object.
666. An alternative would be to raise the necessary funds by a tax payable by employers
on the amount of wages paid. This is the scheme of the New South Wales legislation, which
levies a tax of 3 per cent, on wages, the payment to the fund being an obligation of each employer
of labour. This method, unless the percentage were quite small—say not exceeding 1 per cent.
would, as the evidence makes clear, have an immediate effect in raising the cost of production,
which it is at present so essential for Australia to reduce. Almost the only merit of that form of
levy is its simplicity, especially as applied to industries where large numbers of men are employed.


Sec. 13. — Terms of Reference. —Clauses 2 to 10 — General Comment.
667. But it is just in those cases that the ratio of wages to turnover is apt to be very high,
and the effect of that form of taxation to be specially undesirable.
668. It would of course, be possible to make an allocation of the total obligation, imposing
say a moiety upon industry, the balance being provided from Commonwealth revenue.
669. That division of obligation would, in our opinion, but slightly lessen the injurious
effects upon industry, and upon cost of production, which would certainly result from any but
a scheme of very small proportions. A very small scheme though in itself of very little value,
would be used as a precedent, and become the centre, especially at election time, of continuous
and urgent propaganda for extension. Such a scheme would be one of unstable equilibrium,
pressure being continually exerted to transfer all obligations to public revenue. Holding this
view, it does not seem necessary to express any opinion as to the proportions upon which an
allocation of cost between the public revenue and industry should be made.
670. As to the principle upon which the necessary funds are to be provided, it may be said
in abstract terms, that so far as the public revenue is drawn upon, the justifying principle can
only be that the effectuation of the purpose to which the money is to be applied will, upon balance,
confer substantial benefits upon the community. Such a substantial balance of benefits would
also, we think, be the sole justification for imposing upon industry the duty of providing the
whole, or part, of the funds required. But in both cases detrimental effects would be produced
which, in our opinion, would greatly outweigh the benefits sought to be attained.
671. This is a phase of the inquiry in which little or no assistance is derivable from the
evidence. The majority of witnesses confined their statement of opinion either to a claim that
Child Endowment should be wholly provided by public funds, or on the other hand, that while
it is not desirable to establish the system at all, if as a necessary evil* it had to be endured, the
application of public moneys would be less objectionable than any direct levy upon industry,
either for the whole or part of the needed moneys.
672. With regard to the endowment of dependent children of persons whose wage is not
subject to awards or determinations, or of persons who are carrying on business on their
own account, no system of specific contributions, such as is applicable in the case of organized
industry, is practicable. There are, however, no valid grounds for the exclusion of the children
of such persons.
673. Clause 7. “The methods of administering such a system.”
674. The evidence of Mr. J. T. Heathershaw, Secretary to the Commonwealth Treasury,
shows that the Treasury already possesses, in the Invalid and Old-Age Pensions and Maternity
Allowance Branch, an organization that could be adapted to the administration of a scheme
of Child Endowment. We do not think it necessary to discuss details of the administration.
675. Clause 8. “ The cost of such a system, including administrative expenses, and reserves,
if thought necessary.”
676. The cost of the system would depend largely upon the rate of endowment. To an
important extent it would depend also upon whether any limit of income were fixed, beyond which
parents would not be eligible as applicants. Using round figures, it may be said with an approx-
mation to accuracy, that for each shilling per week of endowment for every dependent child
under fourteen within the Commonwealth, the cost would be about £4,750,000, or say, £5,000,000*.
This cost, however, as the short experience in New South Wales indicates, would probably be
considerably reduced if a low income limit were fixed. The income limit in New South Wales,
we may repeat, is the amount of the basic wage, now £221 per annum, plus any amount payable
as endowment. ( See paragraphs 141-142). But, it is necessary to remember the caution which
we quote (Para. 130) from the New Zealand report, to the effect that the experience of the first
year is of small value as a basis for an estimate of the permanent cost of a scheme.
677. On the question of whether reserves would be necessary, we think there is not at
present a sufficient quantum of experience on which to found a confident answer. It seems
reasonably certain that for the first year or two at least, the proportion of applicants would be
considerably less than might be expected from the statistical figure, with the consequence that
any provision based upon the statistical estimate would probably be in excess of requirements.
The result would be that if money had been raised on those theoretical requirements there would
be a surplus during the first year or two. The strain upon the fund if there were an income
limit, might increase very considerably in a year of much unemployment.
* If, as suggested by many witnesses, the age were extended to 16, the additional cost would be about £700,000 per annum.


Sec. 13.— Terms of Reference. —Clauses 2 to 10 — General Comment.
678. As to administrative costs, the Secretary to the Commonwealth Treasury gave as
a rough approximation of the administrative costs of the scheme, the sum of £55,000, to which
he thought would have to be added about £100,000, to be paid to the Postmaster-General’s
Department as commission for work connected with the distribution of payments, that is a total
of £155,000 per annum.
679. Clause 9. The legal methods of giving effect to any system recommended, with
particular reference to existing distribution of Commonwealth and State powers.”
680. Under the heading of “Constitutional Aspects,” we have quoted the opinions of
learned Counsel, as to the existing distribution of Commonwealth and State powers. These show
that the Commonwealth at present has not the complete powers of legislation which in our
opinion are necessary. In Section 12 (Paragraph 543) we have expressed the opinion that an
essential condition precedent to the establishment of any Commonwealth scheme of Child
Endowment is, that the Commonwealth Parliament shall have acquired exclusive powers of
industrial legislation. It would be necessary also for the Commonwealth Parliament to
acquire complete and exclusive power of legislation with regard to Child Endowment. With
such powers the legal methods of giving effect to any system adopted would be matters of detail.
681. Clause 10. Any matters of public interest which may arise as the result of the institution
of a system of Child Endowment or Family Allowances.
682. The general reactions resulting from the establishment of a universal scheme of
Child Endowment, providing full maintenance from public funds for dependent children, are
difficult to predict. But, it seems reasonably certain that there would be a decided weakening
of the sense of parental responsibility, and of the stimulus to self-improvement and vigour in
craftmanship. On these points, however, much would depend upon whether the scheme were
one in which the large additional sums necessary for full maintenance were distributed without
corresponding, or at least partial, reductions being made in the basic wage. Without such
reduction, the result, in our opinion, would be a marked flush of extravagant spending and a
sharp rise in the cost of living, shortly followed by a check in prosperity, by a more or less
severe collapse in values, and by serious unemployment.
683. An injurious effect of a different kind which would need consideration would be the
greater impulse towards strikes likely to be created.
684. This could and should be counteracted by a provision that on the occurrence of a
strike, any right to endowment on the part of the strikers, should be suspended. In that case
parties affected should be at liberty to apply to the authority appointed for that purpose, for a
certificate that a particular cessation of work was a strike, or on the other hand was a justifiable
cessation. If the authority certified that such general cessation of work was justifiable, the
right to endowment should revive, and should be regarded as not having been interrupted. If,
on the other hand, the cessation of work were held to be a strike, no endowment should be payable
to the strikers in respect of the period covered by the strike.

SECTION 14.
WELFARE SERVICES.
685. The evidence exhibited a perpetual conflict of opinion between the relative advantages
of the expenditure of public money, by way of Child Endowment through cash payments to parents,
and by way of the establishment and improvement of forms of public service contributing more or
less directly to the health and well-being of the population, particularly of mothers and children.
686. An inclusive “ Insurance ” formula for dealing with the whole problem was suggested
to US by Mrs. J. M. G. Street, of Sydney. This witness advocated grouping together, underthe term
“ social benefits ” all the systems of relief and amelioration maintained at present by public funds
or private subscriptions, such as old-age pensions, invalid pensions, widows’ pensions, children’s
relief, hospital grants, orphanages, homes, and every other channel through which the people
are aided in sickness and poverty. Add to the above benefits that of Child Endowment. Let
ali these contingencies then be considered as “ risks ” and worked out in the form of insurance
policies. With regard to the cost, Mrs. Street suggested that if the amount that industry pays


Sec. 14.— Welfare Services.
in wages for non-existent children were added to the sums provided by Governments, and to those
subscribed by private persons for the social benefits mentioned, and if the annual amount paid
in Workers’ Compensation Insurance premiums were also added, the total would probably be a
sum much in excess of that required as premiums for the most generous benefits and bonuses.
Mrs. Street was of opinion that such a scheme might be worked out to give a measure of relief
much beyond that which is achieved by present methods.
687. Some of the difficulties which suggest themselves in connection with Mrs. Street’s
scheme are : —
(1) Our Terms of Eeference do not include power to make investigations which would
be necessary before an opinion could be expressed upon the technical validity
and other matters connected with the wide application of insurance methods
to welfare services.*
(2) The suggestion that a deduction be made of the whole amount now included
in wages, which provides for non-existent children, would prove very difficult
in application.
(3) Such a general scheme of insurance against the ills of life would in our opinion
necessarily be a Commonwealth scheme. The fact that it was a scheme of
the central Government might lead to a cessation of the appropriations now
made by State Governments to such forms of community welfare, and also
might cause almost a complete cessation of the private benefactions now
devoted to the same purposes. The amounts at issue under these two heads
are approximately, appropriations by the States, about £4,750,000 per annum,
and voluntary subscriptions from the public, about £4,000,000.
688. While not attempting to discuss exhaustively the above difficulties, we are of opinion
that the mere enumeration of them is sufficient to justify us in refraining from a recommendation.
689. More than one form of Child Endowment was advocated. Trade union witnesses
invariably favoured cash payments to the mother. Other witnesses preferred the free supply
to mothers of certain commodities, especially of milk.
690. Mrs. Adela Constantia Mary Walsh, of Sydney, submitted another view. In her
opinion assistance to families on incomes approximating to the basic wage would best be rendered,
not by money payments, but by provision of certain services. Mrs. Walsh said that she had
presented her scheme to the Victorian Labour Women’s Conference about three years ago and
they were very favorable to it. (Q. 16627.) The outline of the scheme is as follows : —
(1) Exemption from taxation, according to the size of the family.
(2) Concessions to heads of families, mothers and children, when travelling to work,
business or school, or for holidays.
(3) Housing schemes to enable families to secure homes under decent conditions,
with proper facilities for women’s work on reasonable terms. The community
ought definitely to aim at making it easy for families to leave slum areas and
go into outer suburbs. When building its houses, the State ought to encourage
healthy family life, and the use by mothers of labour-saving appliances, in
the interests of their health.
(4) Better provision for kindergarten and play centres for children.
(5) Provision for dental and medical attention to families at reduced fees (or free
if necessary).
(6) Free ante-natal treatment for expectant mothers, and other special help to
mothers, on the recommendation of a medical advisor.
(7) Establishment of rest homes and holiday houses for parents and children; of
maternity homes and home-nursing services.
(8) Improvement in educational facilities, including the raising of the school-age.
691. The more important of Mrs. Walsh’s suggestions are among those discussed
in the following pages, coming within the general heading of welfare services.
* We are, of course, aware of the special inquiry made by the Royal Commission on National Insurance, and of the introduction
by the Federal Government of a Bill to deal with some of the questions investigated by that Commission.


Sec. 14. — Welfare Services.
692. Cash payments for Child Endowment may or may not be used for the intended purpose.
In some cases the money received will inevitably be directed into channels of expenditure tending
to increase rather than to remove any existing distress among children. In other cases, while
the money may not be actually misspent, it may be wholly or partially diverted from the purpose
intended. ✓
693. It may be objected that as the scheme of the basic wage (using the unit adopted by
the Commonwealth Court, i.e., man, wife, and three children) does not purport to provide for
a family of more than five persons, the families in which dependent children exceed, three must,
in the absence of a scheme of cash endowment, or other form of special assistance, live on a
reduced standard, or, in extreme cases, suffer some hardship. If equal capacity to use a given
income in the most efficient way be postulated, the statement that the more numerous family
will have a lower standard of comfort than the less numerous is, of course, provable by the most
elementary arithmetic. It may be admitted also that the parents of the more numerous
families, taken as a group, are not likely to be sensibly superior in skill and household management
to the parents of the less numerous families.
694. We grant, therefore, that there is some ground for the objection that the present
system of basic wage fixation does not, and cannot, provide the same standard for a family of
eight as for a family of five.
695. But the assumption is too often made, and without justification, that in all these
cases the father is on the basic wage. A point that should not be left out of account is that
many parents are stimulated by the coming of children to increase their earning capacity, and
to be more watchful for opportunities of improving their financial position. Often too, the
stimulus acts in the direction of creating greater ingenuity in devising means for more
effective use of the income they have.
696. While the statistical information we have been able to obtain is not sufficiently
definite to warrant us in stating as a deduction of fact, that wage-earners having large families
invariably succeed in improving their position to a stage commensurate with their larger
responsibilities, the figures certainly suggest that as at least a possibility.
697. The Australian “standard of living,” often spoken of as if it were one and
indivisible, a tangible concrete fact, is in reality a pure abstraction. We have already pointed
out {see paragraphs 354, 380, 558, 595) that the basic wage system, so far as it creates a high
standard of living does so only at one end of the scale, that is among young and unmarried
workers, and that the comparative lavishness of their monetary reward, with the accompaniment
of lavish expenditure, is gained at the expense of the children in families at the other end of the
scale.
698. Special value is realized from the wisely-controlled expenditure of public money upon
such services as those which deal with hospitals, child welfare, adequate provision for training
and assistance to mothers, before, during and after the births of childrenbush nursing ;
kindergarten ; training of girls in domestic economy and hygiene ; and similar services.
699. The health and efficiency of the mother are of vital importance. The chances of
the infant surviving the perils of the first year of life must depend greatly upon the mother’s
vigour and skill.
700. The sombre tragedy of Australian family life is the high rate of maternal mortality
and the high infantile mortality during the first year of life. Dr. J. W. Springthorpe, President
of the Society for the Health of Women and Children of Victoria, said (Q. 24576) : —“As regards
the condition of affairs in Victoria, we had in 1927, 35,074 births, with some 200 mothers dying
in confinement, and some 2,000 babies dying within the first year, while 36 per cent, of the
gynaecology of our chief obstetric hospital—the Women’s Hospital—followed confinement ”.
701. In the same proportion to the population, the deaths of mothers, arising from
confinement, would for the Commonwealth exceed 600 per annum.
702. Services which tend to preserve the life of the mother and expectant mother, and to
make child-bearing “ not a disease, but a natural function ” must be regarded as in the first rank
of importance.


Sec. 14.— Welfare Services.
703. The effect of the efficiency of the mother (of which sound health is the natural
foundation) was the subject of an interesting research, conducted by a number of doctors during
a period of seven years. We quote from The World’s Health , October, 1926 : —
“ The objects of the investigation were various. In the first place the pre-school
child population in the slums of three large cities, Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Dundee,
was studied and compared with a similar population in agricultural and rural
coal-mining areas. Comparison between town and country children was thus possible.
At the same time the relationship between income, diet and home conditions and the
nutrition of the child in all these districts received careful investigation. Lastly the
parental factors concerned were all carefully analysed. The health of the mother
during pregnancy, the occupation of the mother during pregnancy, the influence of
suckling during pregnancy, and the ‘ efficiency ’ of the mother were all statistically
considered with regard to the growth and nutrition of the child. The father was also
studied but in a more limited manner. The results obtained were not at-all those
expected by the investigators. In the first place, although there is some evidence of
retardation in the growth of the town infant as compared with children living under
almost similar conditions in the country, after the age of eighteen months the town
child begins to grow more rapidly and the growth curves run fairly parallel. There
is some evidence that the small size of the town child is in part an inborn characteristic ;
it may even be that this is an adaptation to environment, for the smaller type of individual
is more suited to industrial life, while the large brawny man gains his livelihood in the
fields or in the mines in country districts. Over-crowding, diet, and the family income,
do not bear the relation to the state of nutrition of the child which is generally
attributed to them. In other words, the saying that ‘ what is wrong with the poor
is poverty ’ is not confirmed by these investigators. The only factor which appears
to have any significant relationship with the nutrition of the child is the character of
the mother. Is she ‘ efficient ’ ? Is she a c good ’ mother ? If so, then the child’s
growth and nutrition will be normal or above the average. The ‘ inefficient ’ mother
will have poorly-nourished children. To some extent the health of the mother and the
material with which she has to work in form of income and accommodation will affect
her ‘ efficiency ’, but a direct relationship between the condition of the child and such
economic factors as ‘ poverty ’, ‘ overcrowding ’, and undernutrition ’, is not
substantiated by the investigators. Such a conclusion is of wide-reaching importance.
It does not appear to matter greatly what the family income is ; if the mother is
efficient the children will grow up normally. The justification for the various schemes
referred to from time to time in these columns for the training of young girls in the
principles of motherhood is amply supplied. The role of the voluntary worker in
establishing a more satisfactory standard of nutrition among children of all classes
is clearly indicated. The so-called economic facts are apparently no longer the
obstacle ; ignorance is the main enemy to be combated. The pressing need for further
investigation in other countries along the lines of this brilliant pioneer work here
summarized must again be emphasized. £ The slum child tends to develop along the
lines of its parents ’ (p. 304). It is in raising the intelligence of such parents more than
in the bettering of the environment of the child that improvement lies
704. The State, municipal, and other local authorities have already done much, and their
efforts to raise the standard of community health show a continuous expansion.
705. The total expenditure of the Australian community upon welfare services and
organized charities is about £27,000,000 annually.
706. There is a further expenditure of nearly £10,000,000, under the heading of education,
science and art. Almost the whole of this is expended by the States for the purpose of primary,
secondary and technical education .
707. The expenditure by state Governments upon welfare services and organized charities
is about £4,750,000 per annum. Public contributions to services of that kind amount to over
£4,000,000 per annum.
708. The Commonwealth also provides about £700,000 per annum for maternity allowances
and nearly £10,000,000 for old-age and invalid pensions. There is also an expenditure of nearly
£8,000,000 for war pensions. This expenditure upon pensions, while not strictly coming within
the same category as other welfare services, no doubt does much to relieve the additional
strain which would otherwise be imposed in connection with those services.

Sec. 14. —Welfare Services.
709. The following table gives details of Commonwealth and State expenditure on welfare
services, pensions and education:—
711. At this stage we may mention the Federal Health Council, a body which is composed
of the Chief Executive Health Officer of each State, two medical officers of the Commonwealth
Health Department, with the Commonwealth Director-General of Public Health as ex officio
President. The existence, and harmonious working of this body conduce to effective action
in many important matters affecting the health and welfare of the community.
712. The evidence disclosed that in addition to Government institutions and agencies,
there are many valuable and widely distributed organizations with similar aims, which were
created, and are maintained by voluntary effort.
713. The members of the Commission were deeply impressed with the earnestness and
capacity of the voluntary workers, chiefly ladies, who devote their time and talents to the
organization and operation of these aids to public welfare. It is, we think, extremely desirable
that nothing should be done to check the stream of their concerted and effective beneficence.
714. It is, however, advisable that some action should be taken to co-ordinate the work
of official and non-official organizations dealing with these matters. In every State we found
evidence of some over-lapping. This has two aspects. Privately-supported welfare organizations
sometimes over-lap one another, and sometimes also over-lap the work of official bodies. There
is need for a comprehensive survey of official and non-official efforts, with a view, while
preserving to the community the enthusiasm and invaluable services of voluntary workers, to
ensuring that the money and effort now being expended shall produce the best results. In one
State, Victoria, and in one State alone, a body has been created by statute, namely the Charities
Board, which has the necessary power, and possesses the necessary machinery to make a survey.
715. The Chief Executive Officer of that Board informed us that up to the present, the
Board has been mainly occupied with the study of questions relating to the hospitals of the
State, public and private. A comprehensive scheme for the improvement of the hospital system
has been prepared, and is being worked out. The Board recognizes that a survey of all the
benevolent activities of the public and private institutions of the State would be of considerable
value and such a survey may be undertaken at an early date.
716. We suggest that other State authorities be invited to undertake a similar survey. This,
perhaps, would preferably be preceded by discussion of the subject in the Federal Health Council,
with the view of enlisting the co-operation of the official representatives of Public Health of
all the States, and through them, of their Governments. We would emphasize, however, the


desirability, in our opinion, of avoiding action which might be deterrent to private efforts though
everything possible should be done to unify those efforts, and to prevent the over-lapping and the
proportion of waste which to some extent are now occurring.
. 717. It may be noted that, with regard to one branch of voluntary work, namely that
of the free Kindergartens, many municipalities subsidize the free kindergarten movement for
the special purpose of establishing branches in districts under the Council’s control. This is
mentioned as indicating that, in the opinion of those qualified to judge, the work conducted
by the free kindergarten authorities is efficiently conducted, and that it is in the extension of work
of that kind, rather than by the creation of new and competing public institutions, that the
welfare of children of kindergarten age, that is from two and a half to six years, may best be
served.
718. Some witnesses favored alteration of Kindergarten practice, to take children at an
earlier age. Others were more impressed with the necessity for uninterrupted parental care of
the children in the early years. One witness said : —“ The pre-school age child should be left
at home ; should not be brought under educational control, but should be the subject of annual
medical inspection as a compulsory measure, this inspection (as a matter of convenience) being
made at school.”
719. Other evidence, however, showed that opportunities now exist, to a limited extent,
for mothers to leave their children in the care of competent persons during the day—The mothers
being necessarily absent from home in various gainful occupations. These facilities, in the case
of very young children, and children, say, between the ages of three and four years up to the
school age of six, are a necessity, at any rate, of metropolitan life, and are among the institutions,
the extension of which would probably be justified. This is one of the matters which would be
ascertained by the survey of charitable and benevolent efforts which we have recommended.
720. With regard to the children who have reached school age, valuable work is being
done in every State, through the Education Department, in the way of dental and medical
inspection at the cost of the State. Some of the medical evidence is to the effect that this is a
direction in which any moneys made available by the Commonwealth by way of a subsidy to the
States, might be usefully allocated. This also is a branch of Public Welfare in which the advice
and assistance of the Public Health Council would, in our opinion, be useful.
721. The evidence submitted has satisfied us that the expenditure of relatively moderate
sums far below those which would be required even for a small measure of Child Endowment
by cash payments, would be sufficient, if continued during some years, gradually to bring the
special public services to which we have referred, into the condition in which they could fully cope
with the needs of the community.
722. In this connection we may refer to evidence given by medical witnesses with regard
to the Commonwealth Maternity Allowances Act, wffiich provides a bonus of £5 to mothers at
the birth of each child. The amount annually expended in this way is at present about £700,000.
The view expressed was that this expenditure would secure greater benefits to the community
if diverted to the services we are discussing. Much of the evidence submitted by those who are
responsible for the administration of hospital work or of voluntary efforts, such as Baby Health
Centres, &c., was to the same effect.
723. There is some evidence to show that a portion at least of the Maternity Allowance
is effectively used in the way of payment by mothers for the services rendered to them by hospitals
in which their confinement takes place. The evidence satisfies us that an important proportion
of the sum of £700,000 expended tor Maternity Allowances is probably diverted to uses which
have no direct bearing upon the comfort or welfare of the mother or of the child.
724. One of the outstanding advantages of expenditure of public money under the effective
supervision of the Federal Health Council would be, that no such diversion to purposes alien
from the main object could occur.
725. The Commonwealth Director-General of Public Health (Dr. Cumpston) expressed
the opinion that additional grants of money, commencing perhaps with an amount between
£200,000 and £300,000, and gradually increasing up to a possible maximum in five or seven years
of £500,000, would place upon a satisfactory footing all the public services relating to Maternal
care, Infant Welfare, the care of pre-school-age children, and of school-age children.
726. Dr. Cumpston informs us that following the report (1926) of the Koyal Commission
on Health, a conference of Ministers of Health was convened. “At that Conference it was
decided that subsidies, and generally speaking, the formulation of standards in relation to infant
and maternal welfare, should be subject to deliberation of the Federal Health Council.”


Sec. 14. — Welfare Services.
727. The methods which would be followed if further funds were placed at the disposal
of the Council for expansion of this group of public services would, the witness states, take the
following course : “ After discussion by the Council, a preliminary survey would be made ; full
discussion of the data obtained by that survey would then take place at the Federal Health
Council; standards of procedure would be formulated, and thereafter the payment of any
subsidies which might be provided, would proceed smoothly along well-ordered lines.”.
728. In our opinion, such a course would be satisfactory both to the Commonwealth and
to the States. It would ensure that every step of the necessary extension of these special public
services, or the creation of auxiliary services, would be preceded by a competent examination
of all the essential data, and would be carried out under expert guidance.
729. The perfecting of such services would achieve nearly all that is aimed at by advocates
of Child Endowment. It would also avoid the disadvantages associated with cash payments to
individuals, and would ensure a higher degree and wider range of community welfare.
730. This view involves the rejection of a system of Child Endowment by way of cash
payments provided from public funds.
731. Other reasons for that rejection appear in our Introductory Statement, p. 9.
SECTION 15.
SALIENT POINTS.
732. With reference to the existing distribution of Commonwealth and State powers in
relation to child endowment and wage fixation, the Commission consulted learned Counsel. (Para.
30
733. On some points there were differences of opinion. The Commonwealth Solicitor"
General, Sir Robert Garran, was of opinion that under Section 96 of the Constitution, the Common"
wealth could hand over moneys to the States ear-marked for the purpose of child endowment?
just as it has done with regard to roads. (Para. 4.)
734. Sir Robert said also that he has always considered the power of the Parliament to
appropriate moneys under Section 81 as conferring “ an absolute power of appropriation for general
purposes, and the Commonwealth Parliament has always acted on this supposition.” (Para 4.)
735. The Victorian Committee of Counsel, on the other hand, concluded that “ upon
its true interpretation, the Commonwealth Constitution restricts the power of Parliament to
appropriate money to subjects assigned to the Federal legislative power.” (Para 14.)
736. Child endowment is not one of the subjects so assigned, hence if that is the “ true
interpretation ” of the Constitution, the Commonwealth Parliament could not validly establish
a scheme of child endowment under its own legislative control. (Para 12.)
737. As to who would be a competent plaintiff to attack the constitutionality of a Statute
appropriating money for a purpose outside the legislative competence of the Parliament, Sir
Edward Mitchell thought that any person upon whom a penalty was imposed under such
legislation, might successfully challenge the constitutionality. (Para. 11.)
738. Mr. Owen Dixon was of opinion that “ since the repeal of Section 47 of the Surplus
Revenue Act of 1910 by the States Grant Act 1927, it would seem that the States could not
be [“ a competent plaintiff for that purpose.”]. (Para. 17.)
739. Mr. Maurice Blackburn took another view. He thought that money so voted would
be “ surplus revenue,” and that the States could claim that, as such, it belongs to the States.
(Para. 20.)
740. The only undoubted legislative power of the Commonwealth Parliament with regard
to the subject of Child Endowment, appears to be a power, under Section 96 of the Constitution,
to subsidize State schemes, the necessary money being appropriated under that section as
“financial assistance to the States.” (Para. 29)
741. Another question submitted to Counsel is this : “ Has the Commonwealth power,
as part of any scheme of Child Endowment or independently of any such scheme, to establish
a tribunal for the purpose of fixing a basic wage for the Commonwealth.” (Para. 23.)
742. All the learned Counsel consulted were of opinion that the Commonwealth Parliament
has no such power. (Para. 24.)
743. There are two methods by which the Commonwealth Parliament might acquire power
to deal fully with Child Endowment and industrial legislation. (Para. 35.)


Sec. 15. — Salient Points.
744. Those two methods are :—
(1) by alteration of the Constitution under Section 128, and •
(2) by reference of those matters to the Parliament of the Commonwealth by the
Parliaments of all the States under Section 51 (xxxvii.) (Para. 35.)
745. In our opinion, the Commonwealth Parliament should not act upon a reference from
State Parliaments unless all the States take the necessary action. (Para.- 36.)
746. Alteration of the Constitution by referendum under Section 128 is, in our opinion,
the preferable method. (Para. 38.)
747. The claim made by numerous witnesses was that a Commonwealth scheme of Child
Endowment should be instituted providing full cost of maintenance for every dependent child
under the age of fourteen years. (Para. 40.)
748. Many witnesses stated that cost at about 10s. per week per child. (Para. 39.)
749. That, however, would appear to apply only to the first child in the family.
750. Provision Of full maintenance cost for all dependent children under fourteen years
of age at the rate of 10s. per week per child would involve a new expenditure Of about £50,000,000
per annum. (Para. 40.)
751. If that additional sum were to be raised through the Federal Income Tax, the yield of
that tax would have to be about five and a half times as great as the average yield for the four
years ending 30th June, 1927. (Para. 40.)
752. Claims of this order necessitate some consideration of the economic position. (Para.
42.)
753. A fact of the first importance on the economic side is the magnitude of the Australian
public debt, which at 30th June, 1927, amounted to £1,043,481,224. The net increase in the
public debt during 1927-28 was £33,000,000. (Para. 43.)
754. The annual interest on the total public debt as at 30th June, 1927, is £52,000,000.
Sinking Fund payments 1926-27, in respect of Commonwealth public debts amounted to £3,310,426
(Para. 47.)
755. The accumulated deficit upon railway and other business undertakings of the
Commonwealth and States up to 30th June, 1927, was nearly £60,000,000. (Para. 70.)
756. This deficit tends to grow larger every year, particularly in connection with State
and Commonwealth railways. (Para. 58.)
757. During the five years 1929-33, public debt maturing amounts to £256,000,000. In
the ten years succeeding 1933, additional amounts totalling £276,000,000 fall due.
758. The present indebtedness of Australia may be stated in the form of an obligation
to provide, during 53 years, an annuity of nearly £58,000,000. (See Para. 54.)
759. Any proposal such as that for Child Endowment, involving a serious addition to taxation,
could only claim acceptance if it could be demonstrated that its adoption would produce benefits
more than compensating for the disadvantages which such additional taxation would bring in its
train. (Para. 90.)
760. That has not been demonstrated, and study of the evidence does not suggest that
it can be. (Para. 91.)
761. In Australian systems of wage fixation, apart from recent New South Wales legislation,
the basic wage contains elements of Child Endowment much more than sufficient, if directly
applied, to provide for all existing dependent children. (Para. 173.)


Sec. 15. — Salient Points.
762. Child Endowment exists in France and Belgium on a considerable scale, and in some
other European countries on a much smaller scale. (Para 93 et seq.)
763. The system has been rather widely extended to State employees. (Para. 103.)
764. In France and Belgium, however, the development has been perhaps most important
through what are called the Compensation Funds. These have been voluntarily formed by
organizations of employers. (Para. 102.)
765. The latest information is to the effect that outside France and Belgium, family
endowment has declined in importance, during recent years, especially in private industry.
(Para. 118.)
766. In considering what has been done in European countries, it is necessary to remember
that in those countries there is no system of fixation of wages by law. (Para. 119.)
767. In 1926, family allowances were instituted by Statute in New Zealand.- (Para. 121.)
768. The amount of allowance is 2s. per week for each child (under fifteen years of age)
in excess of two. (Para. 121.)
769. The allowance is payable only where the average weekly income including the
amount of the allowance if any does not exceed £4 plus 2s. for each child in excess of two.
(Para. 121.)
770. In reply to criticism of the amount granted, 2s. per week, the Prime Minister, the
Right Honorable J. G-. Coates, said in Parliament: —“ It may be small; and incidentally I
may say in candour it was the intention to give more, but on account of the somewhat hazy
position of the future, it is not thought wise to do so ”. (Para. 126.)
771. The view of the Opposition was thus stated: —“ It will establish
a precedent in this country that will be pushed— make no mistake about that— at every
conceivable opportunity with the object of giving to the children in every family of more than
two, full maintenance ”. (Para. 127.)
772. Information supplied by the New Zealand authorities shows that on the first full
year’s experience, the number of claims upon the fund is likely to be much less than was at first
anticipated. The chief reason seems to be that the general level of incomes is in excess of the
limit fixed by the Act. (Para. 129.)
773. A system of child endowment was brought into operation in New South Wales in
March, 1927. (Para. 136.)
774. This provides for payment to the mother of 5s. per week for each dependent child
under the age of fourteen years. (Para. 136.)
775. The fund from which these payments are made is derived from a tax levied upon
every employer of 3 per cent, upon the total amount of wages paid by him. (Para. 136.)
776. The full amount of endowment under the Act is limited to cases where the family
income does not exceed the living wage, now £4 5s. (Para. 141.)
777. Reduced endowment is payable where the family income, though exceeding the
basic wage, does not exceed the basic wage plus full amount of endowment payable under the
Act. (Paras. 141-142.)
778. As in New Zealand, the number of claims received during the first full year of
operation was much less than had been anticipated. (Para. 149.)
779. The Commissioner administering the Act expressed the opinion that the chief reason
for the relatively low percentage of claims is that the general level of income among workers is
higher than was supposed. (Para. 149.)


Sec. 15. — Salient Points.
780. It would appear that, if the short experience in New South Wales and New Zealand
could be accepted as a guide, a Commonwealth Child Endowment scheme subject to the same
income limitations as in New South Wales, and providing the rate of benefit of the New South
Wales Act, namely 5s. per week per dependent child under the age of fourteen, could be established
at an initial cost of about £6,500,000 per annum. (Para. 151.)
781. It is too soon, however, to form a definite opinion as to the extent to which claims
on these funds, both in New Zealand and New South Wales, will grow. (Para. 153.)
781a. If no income limit were fixed, the payment of endowment at the rate of 5s.
per week per dependent child under the age of 14, would cost about £24,000,000 per annum.
(Para. 676.)
782. A sectional scheme of Child Endowment has existed for a number of years in the
Commonwealth Public Service. (Para. 155.)
783. This was originally granted in December, 1920, as in substance a bonus of £13 per
annum for each dependent child under the age of fourteen years. The recipients were limited
to those whose salary did not exceed £300, later raised to £500. (Para. 157.)
784. In 1923 the Public Service Arbitrator put the scheme on a new basis. In effect,
this basis is that the whole fund required for payment of the amount of endowment, 5s. per week,
is provided by a deduction from wages and salaries of all Commonwealth employees. (Para. 158.)
785. This deduction is somewhat less than 5s. per week per employee. (Para. 158.)
786. The Commonwealth Public Service Arbitrator informed the Commission that the
system of Child Endowment within the Commonwealth Public Service is working without
complaint, and is regarded by the Service unions as a reasonable compromise. (Para. 161.)
787. In practice the relation between Child Endowment and wage fixation is very close,
and there are inescapable interactions. (Para. 168.)
788. In Australian systems of wage regulation, apart from recent New South Wales
legislation, the two have been blended into one, every basic wage containing unanalysed elements
of endowment. (Para. 173.)
789. The inter-relation of Child Endowment and Industrial Regulation led us to devote
attention to industrial legislation, and practice of arbitration tribunals. (Para. 168.)
790. The tribunals are numerous ; the methods are multiform. (Para. 290.)
791. Each State has at least one system, while some States have more than one, and one
State has four. (Para. 291 (4).)
792. The Commonwealth Arbitration Court, operating upon some industries in every
State, appears to govern the wages and conditions of about 50 per cent, of the employees who
are subject to awards of any tribunals. (Para. 178.)
793. There are two special Commonwealth tribunals apart from the Arbitration Court,
namely, one for the coal-mining industry, and one for the Commonwealth Public Service.
(Para. 291 (2-3).)
794. The manner in which inter-action may occur between Child Endowment and wage
fixation is strikingly illustrated by the following sequence of events in New South Wales : —
795. Up to December, 1926, the family unit accepted for wage fixation was man,
wife, and two children. (Para. 206.)
796. On that date the Industrial Commissioner declared the living wage at
£4 4s., which sum, he stated, would provide the proper standard for a man, wife, and
one child. (Para. 217.)


Sec. 15. — Salient Points.
797. By an Amending Act of April, 1927, the family unit was prescribed as man
and wife only. By other legislation at the same time, family endowment of 5s. per
week per dependent child was provided. (Para. 230.)
798. After the passing of these Acts, the New South Wales Industrial
Commission met, on 27th June, 1927, to determine the 1927 standard of living, and to
declare the living wage. The Industrial Commissioner declared the living wage at
£4 5s. for the new statutory unit of man and wife only, although—
(a) in December, 1926, he found that £4 4s. provided the necessary standard
of comfort for a man and wife and one child, and
( b ) that the cost of living had in the interval risen onlv bv lOd. per week.
(Para. 235.)
799. The Industrial Commission having in the meantime been re-constituted,
and now consisting of three Justices, a majority judgment of 25th September, 1928,
adjudged the June, 1927, decision to have “ departed entirely from the principles laid
down in the judgment of June, 1926,” and to be “based upon methods which are
fundamentally wrong ”. (Paras. 241, 242, 246.)
800. The Queensland Industrial Arbitration law contains provisions not found in the
industrial legislation of other States.
801. These special provisions enable the tribunal, when fixing rates of wages, to consider
the prosperity of the calling, and the value of the employee’s labour. There is, however, a
datum wage fixed independently of those conditions. Above that datum, wages may be fixed
in accordance with the opinion of the tribunal as to the relative prosperity of the industry.
(Para. 255.)
802. The Queensland basic wage is £4 5s. This is 6s. 6d. higher than that of the
Commonwealth in that State. (Para. 265.)
803. The family unit adopted in Queensland is man, wife, and three children. (Para.
256.)
804. In South Australia the “ living ” or “ basic ” wage is fixed upon a family unit of
man, wife, and three children. (Para. 277.)
805. The assumption is that the living wage is the wage for the unskilled worker. (Para.
279.)
806. In Western Australia, also, the unskilled worker is the assumed recipient of the
basic wage. By construction of the Act, the Court has determined the family unit as being
man, wife, and two children. (Para. 282.)
807. In Victoria and Tasmania, there are no Industrial Courts, but the Wages Boards system
prevails. (Para. 287.)
808. The Victorian Wages Boards Rates include the element of the Commonwealth basic
wage known as the “ Powers 3s. ”. In Tasmania this is not included. (Para. 288.)


Sec. 15. — Salient^Points.
809. Under the Commonwealth system, and the systems of South Australia and Western
Australia, capacity to pay is, theoretically at least, disregarded by the Industrial Tribunals.
(Para. 293.)
810. If an industry cannot pay the declared wage it must go out of existence. (Para. 293.)
811. The periods between successive declarations of the basic wage differ in different
States. In New South Wales and South Australia, declarations may not be made oftener than
once in every six months. In Queensland, the Court is free to use its own discretion. In
Western Australia, the wage must be declared before 14th June each year. (Paras. 308-312.)
812. The anomalies, and conflicts of determinations, in Australian Industrial Courts,
urgently need harmonizing.
813. This has been repeatedly emphasized by Industrial Judges. (Para. 313.)
814. For example, this conflicting jurisdiction has been described (we quote from various
industrial judgments) as, “ a menace to industrial peace, stability, and efficiency ”. (Para. 317.)
“ The machinery for fixing wages and conditions throughout Australia
should be co-ordinated.” (Para. 321.)
“ There is no co-ordination, no inter-dependence between the Courts, and the
disputants are only too apt to treat the Courts as rival shops, and this position involves
grave danger to industrial peace and to the continuity of operations in industry.”
(Para. 323.)
“ Eesulting complications are chaotic. If it were desired to design such a
situation, it might be conceived by the disordered mental efforts of a Commission of
lunatics.” (Para. 324.)
815. The methods and results of the Basic Wage Commission 1920 have been much
misunderstood, and the misunderstanding has caused many difficulties. (Para. 328.)
816. The Commission was required to give in detail the commodities and services, with
their cost, which in its opinion would constitute a reasonable standard of comfort. (Para. 338,
footnote.)
817. The cost so found varied from £5 6s. 2d. in Brisbane, to £5 17s. in Sydney. (Para.
326.)
818. This was interpreted in many quarters as equivalent to a declaration of the basic
wage. (Paras. 327-328.)
819. Mr. Justice Higgins, commenting on the report said : —“ What the Commissioners
have reported on is not a basic wage at all This so-called basic wage
of the Commission is not a true basic wage, but a will-o’-the-wisp that will lead them into a ditch.”
(Para. 330.)
820. Mr. Justice Powers, referring to the clothing list drawn up by the 1920 Commission,
said : —“ The Commission allows the typical family a quantity and quality of clothes which I
know from my experience in this Court are not necessary for men, women, and children to live
in reasonable comfort even when in receipt of £400 a year.” (Para. 336.)
821. The frequent compilation by Industrial Tribunals of lists of commodities and
services, leads to claims being asserted which go beyond the bounds of possible realization.
(Para. 399.)
822. It also has the undesirable effect of deflecting public opinion from the desirability
of encouraging home-craft, one of the most valuable of our arts. (Para. 404.)


Sec. 15. — Salient Points.
823. On evidence submitted by Mr. P. J. Pringle, on behalf of the Victorian Chamber
of Manufactures, it appears that, since 1007, effective wages have increased by 12s. to 14s. per
week. Mr. Pringle says that, as a conservative estimate, the resulting aggregate increase in
wages paid since 1907 may be taken at £30,000,000. (Para. 446-450.)
824. Mr. Pringle’s statements were confirmed, at least as to the main contention, by Mr.
C. H. Wickens, the Commonwealth Statistician. (Para. 451.)
825. The basic wage system, as understood in Australia, arose through the adoption by the
Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration of the principles of the 1907 Judgment
known as the Harvester Judgment. (Para. 349.)
826. The basic wage is designed to ensure provision for the “ needs ” of the unskilled
worker. (Para. 355.)
827. The new aspects of wage fixation introduced by Australian methods were : —
(a) the public announcement of family obligations as the leading or the only factor
to be considered in determining basic wage rates;
(b) the dismissal, or the relegation to the background, of the fundamental idea that
a wage is really and properly based upon the value of “ services in produc-
tion” of the worker;
(c) the ousting of the “ iron law of wages ” which was supposed to depress the lot
of the worker without injury to the employer, and its replacement by the
Draconian Decree of a tribunal, which consigns employer and employee alike
to a common industrial extinction, if their joint “ industry ” fails to provide
for the payment of a prescribed basic wage. (Para. 357.)
828. The rigidity of the basic wage is one of its great defects. There is urgent need for
the introduction of greater flexibility. (Para. 358.)
829. In times of stress, or of economic emergency, either national or local, Arbitration
Tribunals should have express power to meet the situation by review, and if necessary by reduction,
of the basic wage, or to adopt other measures calculated to prevent unemployment. (Para. 358.)
830. In fixing the basic wage, the standard of living throughout Australia should have
reference to the same class of workers, namely, the “ unskilled ” or “ lowest paid ” class. (Para.
380.)
831. It is also essential that, so long as the basic wage includes provision for marital or
family obligations, the family unit upon which the wage is based, should be uniform throughout
Australia. (Para. 390.)
832. Uniformity, both with regard to the class of worker, and the family unit, should, in
our opinion, be determined, under exclusive power, by the Commonwealth Parliament. (Para. 390.)
833. Except in times of emergency, the standard of living and the basic wage founded
upon that standard, should not, except as to cost-of-living adjustments, be altered oftener than
say once in every five years. (Para. 413.)
834. If compulsory wage fixation is to continue in Australia, it is in our opinion, essential
that determination of the basic wage should be made exclusively by a Commonwealth tribunal.
(Para. 415.)
835. As, under the existing system, “wage fixation ” and “child endowment” would
react upon each other, both should be under the exclusive control of one tribunal. This would
be necessary in order to prevent a dangerous competition.
836. In a judgment of June, 1927, the New South Wales Industrial Commission declared
in effect that the worker obtains a “ vested right ” to the declared basic wage. (Para. 416.)
837. The doctrine is in our opinion dangerous, and in the opinion of learned Counsel
consulted by the Commission, is legally untenable. (Paras. 416-424.)


Sec. 15. —Salient Points.
838. The majority of the New South Wales Industrial Commission, as now constituted,
has over-ruled the 1927 judgment on that point. (Para. 425, footnote.)
839. The application of the doctrine of “ vested right ” to industrial determinations should,
in our opinion, be excluded by appropriate legislation. (Para. 425.)
840. The basis of the claim to Child Endowment is an alleged insufficiency of the wage
to provide for children in large families. (Para. 468.)
841. Many witnesses assumed that all, or nearly all, workers with large families were
on the basic wage, or had incomes not greater than that wage. (Para. 469.)
842. Much evidence was tendered in disproof of that assumption. (Paras. 470-472.)
843. To give one extract only —in South Australia, out of 104,000 male employees of
the Government, 7,000 are receiving the State basic wage, £4 5s., 34,000 have a wage between
£4 5s. and £4 15s., and 63,000 receive over £4 15s. per week. (Para. 471.)
844. In private employ (as the evidence show's) it is the exception to find adult male
employees who are not receiving more than the basic wage. (Para. 472.)
845. Evidence of witnesses representing organizations of a charitable pr. benevolent
character almost invariably negatived insufficiency of wage as the cause of existing distress.
(Para. 475.)
846. Those witnesses assigned other causes, such as unemployment, sickness, gambling,
drink, wife desertion, &c. (Para. 475.)
846a. A remedy for distress among children, caused by sickness of, or accident to, the
bread-winner, should be sought under a scheme of insurance rather than under a scheme of
Child Endowment. (Para. 479.)
847. In our opinion, the claim for Child Endowment based upon an alleged insufficiency
of wage among workers is untenable. (Para. 489.)
848. To set up a general scheme of Child Endowment to deal with the small residual
percentage of persons in the community who need some assistance, would be both unnecessary
and unjustifiable. (Para. 491.)
849. Economist witnesses favored the doctrine that generally a lessening of present
inequalities of income is economically good, if, on balance, the effects of any given re-distribution
are not outweighed by adverse effects upon production. (Para. 493.)
850. Various sums were suggested by economists as possible additions to taxation for
purposes of Child Endowment. These sums ranged from £2,000,000 to £10,000,000, but, “ it
is an extraordinarily difficult thing to estimate ”. (Paras. 500, 502, 505.)
851. It was pointed out that there would be a great danger of increasing unemployment
to an extent that would outweigh the gains of endowment, (Para. 499.)
852. Professor Alcock (Queensland) said : —“ An extra 5s. added to the present basic
wage might cause anything from a 30,000 to an 80,000 increase in the number of unemployed.”
(Para. 499.)
853. Professor Brigden (Hobart) and Professor Copland (Melbourne) thought that an
essential element in any endowment scheme would be some re-distribution of wages for the purpose.
(Paras. 501, 507.)
854. Professor Brigden suggested that 2s. per week out of the so-called “ Powers 3s.”
should be transferred from the weekly wage. That would produce about £5,500,000 per annum
“ if it could all be collected.” (Paras. 501-502).
F.24/28. — 7


S*,c. 15. —Salient Points.
855. Professor Mills (Sydney) said : —“ If we had only £8,000,000 to spare, I think at
any rate the greater part of it would be better expended in a scheme of unemployment insurance.”
(Para. 500.)
855a. Dr. Benham, in a recent work, “The Prosperity of Australia,” expresses the
opinion that an additional £50,000,000 a year might be raised by taxation without imposing
any undue burden. That statement is commented upon in paras. 510-533.
856. In our opinion, the imposition of large additional taxation for a scheme of Child
Endowment, leaving present wage rates untouched, is practically an impossibility. (Para. 509.)
857. If on the other hand, a small scheme commencing with say 2s. per week (as suggested
by a witness) were adopted, the effect would simply be to bring into being a new and prolific
cause of industrial disputes and political conflict. (Para. 509.)
858. Witnesses supporting the establishment of Child Endowment were unanimously in
favour of a Commonwealth scheme, rather than of independent and differing State schemes.
(Para. 534.)
859. As between a Commonwealth scheme and separate State schemes, we agree with
the views of witnesses that a Commonwealth scheme would be preferable. (Para. 542.)
860. But for reasons appearing above we are opposed to State schemes of Child
Endowment. (Paras. 536-539.)
861. In our opinion, the Commonwealth Parliament should not grant assistance to the
States in the financing of State schemes of Child Endowment. (Para. 541.)
862. But, for reasons set out in our introductory statement, we are also opposed to
a Commonwealth scheme of Child Endowment.
863. We repeat some of the reasons for rejecting that scheme.
864. The burden created by additional taxation to finance the scheme from public
revenue or by way of a direct levy upon industry would, in our opinion, increase cost
of living; increase unemployment; check prosperity; cause a collapse in values.
(Para. 544.)
865. By the removal of financial responsibility from parents for their children,
both economic and domestic incentive would be seriously reduced. (Paras. 545-546.)
866. If Child Endowment as a gage of battle be tossed into the arena of the
present Industrial Tribunals, disputes will inevitably increase in number and in intensity.
(Par. 554.)
867. That result could not fail to follow the introduction of a Commonwealth
scheme of Child Endowment, unless the Commonwealth possessed exclusive control
of industrial legislation. (Para. 543.)
868. Friction and difficulty could not be avoided if there were two controlling
bodies (one to fix a basic wage which might include provision for two or three children)
and the other to grant endowment to such children as were not specifically provided
for in the basic wage. (Para. 587.)
869. Each would be the subject of pressure to supplement the grants made by
the other, thus creating a “ vicious spiral ” similar to that which the Tariff Board has
denounced as created by the “ passing back and forth between the Federal Arbitration
Court and the Tariff Board.” (Para. 588.)
870. Any available public money could be more beneficially used in perfecting
social services. (Paras. 727-729.)
871. If (contrary to our view) a Commonwealth scheme be proposed, then, in our opinion,
conditions precedent to its establishment should be —
(1) That the Commonwealth Parliament should have first obtained full and exclusive
power—
(а) to control wage fixation, and “ industrial matters ” as defined in
Industrial Statutes;
(б) to establish and control Child Endowment.
(2) That any existing State legislation instituting a scheme of Child Endowment
should be repealed. (Para. 543.)


Sec. 15. — Salient Points.
872. An income limit should be an essential part of any proposal for the establishment
of a scheme Of Child Endowment. (Para. 660.) A family income not exceeding a re-adjusted
basic wage should be the datum with regard to the payment of full endowment. For a reduced
endowment eligibility could be calculated by the method shown in para. 141-142.
873. The inclusion of persons whose wages are not regulated by law, or who are not engaged
in industry as wage-earners, in any scheme of Child Endowment, would, in our opinion, be both
just and necessary. (Para. 648.)
874. Assuming provision for Child Endowment to be made from public funds, direct
taxation appears to us the preferable form.
875. The principle justifying the provision of public funds for the purpose of Child
Endowment can only be that, upon balance, substantial benefits would be conferred upon the
community. (Para. 670.)
876. Such a substantial balance of benefits would also, we think, be the sole justification
for imposing upon “ industry ” the duty of providing the whole or part of the funds required.
(Para. 670.)
877. But, in both cases, detrimental effects would be produced which, in our opinion,
would greatly outweigh the benefits sought to be attained. (Para. 670.)
878. The logical unit for wage fixation on the “ needs ” theory is the individual worker.
(Para. 592.)
879. We are of opinion that, for practical reasons, if an Australian scheme of Child
Endowment were adopted, the family unit for the purpose .of determining the basic wage should
be taken as a man and wife. (Para. 600.)
880. In our opinion, the evidence justifies the statement that full maintenance for each
existing dependent child, on a scale commencing with 8s. per week for the first child in each
family, the amount diminishing by Is. for each subsequent child up to and including the fifth,
with 4s. for each child beyond the fifth, could be provided by a contribution from wages of about
7s. per week. (Para. 601.)
881. This we suggest opens a wide door for a scheme which in effect would be a voluntary
scheme, as it is unlikely that it will be adopted without some initial evidence of goodwill
on the part of wage-earners. (Para. 606.)
882. We suggest that such a change in the distribution of wages deserves the most earnest
and favorable consideration of wage-earners and of industrial tribunals. (Para. 607.)
883. That change (with somewhat smaller figures) has been effected in the Commonwealth
Public Service, with results which (we are assured) are considered to be highly satisfactory.
(Para. 608.)
884. If a voluntary scheme of Child Endowment were adopted, under which the funds were
provided by means of a redistribution of wages, we suggest that the Commonwealth Parliament
should assist by providing the necessary machinery, and defraying the cost of administration.
(Para. 612.)


Sec. 15 —Salient Points.
885. In Australia, where a higher birth-rate is generally desired, many witnesses expressed
the opinion that an increase in that rate would result from the establishment of a scheme of
Child Endowment. (Para. 617.)
886. In Great Britain on the other hand, where an increase in the birth-rate is feared
rather than desired, many advocates of Child Endowment argue that the introduction of the
system will not increase, but rather decrease, the birth-rate. (Para. 618.)
887. A study of the evidence, and of the works of writers on Child Endowment, leads
us to the conclusion that there is no reason to assume that a further increase in the standard of
living, whether made possible by an increase in wages, or by payment of Child Endowment, in
addition to present wage rates, would increase the birth-rate, or even check its decline. (Para. 625.)
i
888. A logical consequence of the establishment of a Commonwealth scheme of Child
Endowment would be the creation of some form of eugenic control. (Para. 627-629.)
889 Expert witnesses appeared to be unanimous that up to a certain point, such control
is both practicable and desirable. (Para. 631.)
890. The unmistakably feebleminded, and persons tainted with serious and transmissible
diseases or defects, should be prevented from reproducing their species. (Para. 631-633).
891. Within such limits, in our opinion, eugenic control should be established, whether or
not Child Endowment be accepted as a feature of national policy. (Para. 631-633.)
892. The administrative cost for a Commonwealth scheme of Child Endowment, as estimated
by the Secretary to the Commonwealth Treasury, is about £155,000 per annum. (Para. 678.)
0 893. The general reactions resulting from the establishment of a universal scheme of Child
Endowment, providing full maintenance from public funds for dependent children, are difficult
to predict. (Para. 682.)
894. But. it seems reasonably certain that there would be a decided weakening of the
sense of parental responsibility, and of the stimulus to self-improvement and vigour in craftsmanship.
(Para. 682.)
895. On these points, however, much would depend upon whether the scheme were one
in which the large additional sums necessary for full maintenance, were distributed without
corresponding, or at least partial reductions being made in the basic wage. (Para. 682.)
896. Without such reduction, the result, in our opinion, would be a marked flush of
extravagant spending, and a sharp rise in the cost of living, shortly followed by a check in prosperity,
by a more or less severe collapse in values, and by serious unemployment. (Para. 682.)
897. An injurious effect of a different kind which would need consideration would be the
greater impulse towards strikes likely to be created by the introduction of a general scheme of
Child Endowment. (Para. 683.)
898. This should be counteracted by a provision that on the occurrence of a strike, any
right to endowment on the part of the strikers should be suspended, and, in respect of the period
of the strike, should not revive unless the Court certified that the “ strike was a justifiable
cessation of work. (Para. 684.)


Sec. 15. — Salient Points.
899. No expenditure of public money realizes such special value as that upon wisely
controlled services, such as hospitals, maternity training, maternity homes, child welfare, training
of nurses, bush nursing, kindergarten, training of girls in domestic economy and similar services.
(Para. 698.)
900. The expenditure by State Governments upon welfare services and organized charities
is about £4,750,000 per annum. Public contributions to services of that kind amount to over
£4,000,000 per annum. (Para. 707.)
901. The States also expend nearly £10,000,000 per annum under the heading of Education,
Science and Art. (Para. 706.)
902. The Commonwealth expenditure upon Old-Age and Invalid Pensions is about
£10,000,000 per annum ; upon War Pensions nearly £8,000,000 per annum, and upon Maternity
Allowances about £700,000. (Para. 708.)
903. Apart from the maintenance of public hospitals, (which in every State are- partially
supported by Government funds) the amount necessary to extend and complete services relating
to maternal care, infant welfare, care of pre-school-age children and of school-age children, is
estimated as £300,000 per annum, increasing up to a possible maximum of £500,000. (Para. 725.)
904. We do not recommend the method of Child Endowment by way of cash payments
provided by public funds, as we believe that any public money available can be more profitably
devoted to the extension of services of the nature we have mentioned. (Paras. 698 and 729.)
905. We are satisfied that the expenditure of relatively moderate sums, far below those
which would be required even for a small measure of Child Endowment, would suffice to secure
superior benefits to the community. (Para. 542.)

ADDENDUM TO MAJORITY REPORT.
Many passages in our Report tend to indicate the desirability which, in our opinion, exists
for a thorough investigation into the Australian system of industrial regulation by means of
Arbitration Courts and similar tribunals.
It was not within the powers conferred by our Terms of Reference for us to make such
an investigation, although the interrelation of industrial regulation generally with such a subject
as child endowment became continually more evident as our inquiry proceeded.
At many stages of our work the closeness of that interrelation and the increasingly
compelling reasons for inquiry into the Australian system of industrial regulation, created in our
minds a firm opinion that a study of industrial regulation must be regarded as the major
question, with child endowment occupying a minor position.
From some points of view, of course, it is possible to discuss child endowment as
separable from the subject of industrial regulation, and capable of being dealt with as an
independent self-subsisting mechanism
But, unless a radical alteration in the distribution of the power of industrial regulation
take place, and a unifying of the perplexingly diverse methods which now exist side by side be
effected, the probability of the successful working of any scheme of child endowment would, in
our opinion, be negligible.
In view of the nature of the Terms of Reference, we did not feel at liberty to make a
‘ recommendation” on the subject in our Report, but we suggest that a comprehensive
investigation of the Australian systems of industrial regulation is a matter of prime and urgent
importance.

MINORITY REPORT
OF
COMMISSIONERS Mrs. F. M. MUSCIO and JOHN CURTIN.
May it please Your Excellency :
1. We dissent from the finding of the majority of the Commission that no consideration
be given to the payment of allowances to dependent children until the Commonwealth has
absolute control over the whole field of industry and wage regulation, and that even when this
is effected the allowances should be contingent on the adoption of the revolutionary innovation
indicated in their report. To delay what we regard as a measure of justice for the families
hereinafter specified, while the body politic is engaged in a protracted and highly contentious
constitutional struggle, involving a re-casting of the powers of the Commonwealth and the States
in regard to industrial sovereignty, is not only unnecessary, but unjustified. The people of
Australia on several occasions have by popular plebiscite rejected the proposal. We do not
regard it as an essential feature of a system of family allowances.
CHILDREN’S ALLOWANCES FOR THE LARGER FAMILIES.
2. While agreeing with the recommendation that services such as pre-natal and maternity
treatment, dental and medical attention should be made accessible to all families as soon as
possible, and that a scheme of housing within the resources of large families on a low wage should
be introduced in those cities where housing is a difficult problem (particularly in Sydney and
Melbourne), we are of opinion that such measures alone, even if widely extended at an early
date, would not meet the special difficulties of the larger families.
3. Such schemes as these apply equally to all children. Medical and dental attention
are already provided to some extent, and the various States are gradually widening the area of
such services. It is highly desirable that all mothers and children should have their teeth and
their bodies generally kept in sound condition, but these things do not augment the family income.
On the other hand a family income that is too small for reasonable needs may help to produce
the ill-effects that these services seek to correct. The provision of stout boots and warm clothing,
for example, may reduce the need for medical attention. Ability to pay the rent for a decent
house, to buy the foods needed for building up young bodies and the clothing needed to protect
them, keeps away physical ills as well as the psychological ills of undue strain and anxiety to
the father and mother, which strike at the very roots of family well-being.
4. Some witnesses have stressed the need for sacrifice in the family, but the value of
“ doing without ” can be exaggerated. No one would deliberately lower the standard of the family
basic wage, for the purpose of improving character by increasing sacrifice, and such loose
assertions should not be made without reference to some standard accepted as a reasonable
minimum. Arbitration authorities have decided that for the family beyond the unit specified
in their awards the reasonable minimum is not provided and the services of doctors and
dentists will not provide it.
5. The provision of instruction in food values and housecraft generally is a most desirable
one, and this national service should be within the reach of all girls. But such teaching will
not provide the tools with which the mother is to do her work ; at best it shows her how to use
those tools well. The tools she needs are those which will procure suitable foods and the means
of cooking them, adequate clothing and reasonable home conditions from the point of view of
health and comfort. It is probable that the more efficient she becomes, the more she will demand
these things. Ignorance may be the reason for purchasing unsuitable foods, but the suitable
foods and suitable cooking of them may prove more costly than the provision of less suitable
foods.


6. Housing schemes under which satisfactory homes may be rented or purchased by
workers are badly needed, especially in the larger centres of population, but the larger the family
on any given wage the less, generally speaking, will be its chance of securing such a house. Such
a family needs a larger house than the smaller family, and at the same time can spare less for
rent than the smaller family because more has to be expended in food and clothing for its members.
To make the family income among workers more nearly proportioned to family needs is an
essential precondition of any national housing scheme, if the larger families whose need of such
provision is the greatest, are really to benefit by it. Otherwise, they will, as a rule, have the
poorest houses, those which are rejected by the smaller families. Mr. George Emery (General
Manager of the Government Savings Bank of Victoria) in giving evidence with regard to the
housing scheme operated by the Bank, said that of 1,396 borrowers during the year ended 30th
June, 1928, 859, that is nearly 62 per cent, of the applicants, had wages exceeding £5 per week.
Of these 1,396 borrowers, 718 had no children, and only 229 or 16 per cent, had three or more
children. Evidently, this scheme is not being used to any great extent by fathers of larger
families on a low wage. Mr. Emery considered that outside this scheme houses could not be
got more cheaply unless of a poor type, but that at the same time these houses (of timber) were
beyond the reach of many workmen with families.
7. These considerations make it clear that extension of services, whether medical or dental,
or the teaching of housewifery or the building of decent houses, which benefit families irrespective
of their size, will do nothing to abolish the hardships of the larger families as compared with the
smaller ones. It will not give the larger families the wherewithal to reach the minimum standard
of comfort which is considered by the Courts as the inherent right of every family.
8. The problem of Child Endowment or of Children’s Allowances is primarily one of
disparity between the standards of families of different size on the same wage.
9. In the Industrial world different standards of comforts have definitely been allotted
by basing the wage for all families on the cost of supplying the needs of an average family. As
the standard implied for this average family is the minimum standard which should be adopted
according to current social theory, it follows that the families of wage-earners which are largei
than the average live on a lower standard than the one supposed to be allowed by the wage.
10. Some system of family allowances is thus the logical corollary of the living wage
doctrine which is in theory the principle underlying our present methods of wage fixing.
DEPENDENT CHILDREN.
11. The Commonwealth Statistician estimates that approximately 92 per cent., or about
1,035,000 of the children dependent on parents who are wage and salary earners, belong to families
with an income of less than £3OO per annum ; of the children dependent on employers, workers
on own account, and other non-employees 85 per cent., or say 595,000, have parents whose annual
income is under £3OO.
12. There was agreement among witnesses that any system of allowances should not be
restricted to the wage-earning community, but should extend also to the families of non-employees.
It is worthy of note that both the New Zealand and New South Wales systems operate irrespective
of the occupation of the father on whom the children are dependent.
13. The importance of the well-being of children to the nation is not confined to any
class ; it involves all children. It is the family life which furnishes the two elements that more
than any other contribute most powerfully to the development of human beings, viz., heredity
and environment during the formative period. The sociological function of the family is to
ensure as far as possible that children will be well and healthfully born and well and healthfully
nurtured.
14. To differentiate between families, in any system of family allowances, because of
the occupation of the breadwinner, would diminish the national benefit and also be unjust to
a large number of children.
15. There never has been any doubt of the value of the services, infinite in variety and
extent, which the family renders to the nation. Primarily it is the source of national continuance ;
it has supplied the human material indispensable for the production of the means of subsistence ;
it provides for the replacement of the old and the dead, and is the sole guarantee for the
redemption in the future of those obligations which previous and present generations have
found it desirable to incur in order to enjoy the fullest attainable measures of security, comfort
and civilization.


16. The Commonwealth Statistician’s tables indicate that the 92 per cent, of the children
of the wage and salary earners whose parents are said to have an income of less than £3OO and
the 85 per cent, of the children of non-employees similarly restricted, constitute nearly 90 per
cent, of the total dependent children in the Commonwealth. The figure implies the correctness
of Mr. Sutcliffe’s estimate (see The National Dividend) that 83 per cent, of the people in 1921
had incomes of less than £250 per annum.
17. Within the groups of male wage and salary-earners those families which had two or
more children in that year were 58.4 per cent, of the total membership of the workers’ households,
counting the unmarried males and the families in which the children had grown up. (See The
Next Step, page 18.)
THE STANDARD OF LIVING.
18. It is extraordinary that the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration
has never made any general inquiry into the standard of living except the admittedly inadequate
investigation conducted by Mr. Justice Higgins 21 years ago when he laid it down that the
standard of remuneration of a worker should be “the normal needs of the average employee
regarded as a human being living in a civilized community,” and that wages should be “ sufficient
to provide these things, (i.e., food and shelter) and clothing and a condition of frugal comfort
estimated by current human standards.”
19. “ Since then,” says the Commonwealth Statistician (Labour Report No. 17 page 88)
“ only one comprehensive attempt has been made by the Federal authorities to ascertain
specifically what the actual requirements were in the various States according to reasonable
standards of comfort, including all matters comprised in the ordinary expenditure of a household
in respect of a family consisting of man, v r ife and three children under fourteen years of age.”
This was the inquiry conducted in 1920 by a Royal Commission composed of three representatives
each of employers and employees w T ith Mr. A. B. Piddington, K.C., as Chairman.. It is important
to note that the findings of the Commission were unanimous.
20. Evidence was submitted to us to show that had Mr. Justice Higgins in the Harvester
Case in 1907 declared the merits of the issues on the equivalents in that year of the findings of
the Commission, the basic wage for unskilled labour would have been fixed at 535. lOd. instead
of 425. per week.
21. In reply to Question 11,733, Mr. C. H. Wickens (Commonwealth Statistician) testified
that Mr. Piddington had pointed out that as a fact it would be found that the wage fixed by
Mr. Justice Higgins, instead of being sufficient to provide for a man, wife and three children,
was sufficient to provide for a man, wife and but one child. Mr. Wickens further said that this
contention was the. justification for the equity of the reduction of the allowance cost of one child
which the Commonwealth Public Service Arbitrator makes from the ascertained basic wage
in order to provide the fund for'the Commonwealth Public Service scheme of child endowment.
22. It is, therefore, difficult to escape the conclusion that probably even in the families
with two children, and more definitely in those with three or more children, there has been
awarded a wage rate for the parent less than that needed to provide the standard of life which
would satisfy the demands of healthful nurture for the children.
23. Significantly enough, the wage paid by reputable employers prior to the declaration
of the Harvester Judgment, and arrived at independently of any professed domestic unit was
7s. per day, the amount declared in the judgment. The pre-“ Harvester ” standard emerged
from the competition of all workers, whether unmarried, married and childless, or married with
varying numbers of dependent children, for employment. The average number of dependent
children per adult male worker was then, as now, approximately one.
24. One child was, therefore, the economic reality, and it would appear was the natural
domestic appendage which, with the wife and mother, such worker would have to earn a wage
to maintain, and it would appear that the real fact of the obligation of a wife and one child as
the domestic unit of the workers as a class arose historically by the natural law of supply and
demand and constituted the economic foundation for the price at which labour would be
available. No judgment altered the reality. Judicial pronouncements, however, which were
not reflected in judicial findings, have led to the fiction that wages have been and are computed
on the assumption that each worker has a wife and three dependent children to maintain, but
no basic wage adjudication will bear dissection on this hypothesis. No court has divided its
group wage into the proportions that would be required for its alleged mathematical units.


DEPRESSING THE STANDARD.
25. Whatever may be thought of the standard actually provided by the Harvester and
succeeding iudgments, it is obvious that to provide for all families by providing for the average
family is an injustice to those families which are larger than the average. The money which
will provide a frugal standard of comfort for a family of four or five can provide only a lower
standard for say, six, seven or more persons.
26. As the family on the basic wage grows larger, its standard becomes more meagre
until the children are old enough to become wage-earners. The larger the family the
greater the pinch, and the greater the pressure on the child to become as early as possible an
unskilled labourer. This is not only a hardship to the child, but involves ultimate loss to the
community.
27. Even with the most efficient management, present standards of wages leave little
or no room for provision for sickness or accident, or for saving, in the family to which they applied.
The larger the family the less the possibility of any margin even at the lowered standard which,
notwithstanding equal efficiency in management, larger numbers in the family will automatically
produce. When President of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, Mr. Justice Powers said,
“ The present basic wage . . . allows the workers who have more than three living children
under fourteen years of age to live without the necessaries of life as a human being.”
28. One measure of progress in civilization is the advance made in protecting classes
of the community who by reason of old age or youth or sickness or misfortune are unable to
provide for themselves. The child is the most important of all these, for the children are the
future citizens, and to the case of children the doctrines of independence and self-help cannot
be applied.
29. It is becoming more and more an accepted principle that every child has a right to
opportunity for full physical, mental, and moral development. The first responsibility is upon
the parents to provide the means for this opportunity, but the precedent is well established
for the State supplementing the efforts of parents to obtain the possibility of full development
for their children. The provision of schools and of medical attention, and the insistence on
some recognition of family responsibilities in wage-awards, are examples of the State’s
participation in the parents’ task.
30. It is not only because of the disparity in standards, due to the varying sizes of families,
that a system of allowances to children is recommended as an act of justice, but also because
we are assured that the establishment of such a system would be a sound national investment.
31. In considering the transference of any part of the national income from one section
of the community to another, careful consideration must be given to the results likely to arise.
There is every reason to believe that, considering the present distribution of the national dividend,
the diversion of part to those who, it is assumed, will expend it on the better maintenance of
children who will later be a large proportion of the workers, will, if carefully done, justify the
expenditure on strictly economic grounds. The theory and practice of modern wage-earning
which treat the father as the sole economic unit have tended to obscure the importance to the
community of the money and services expended in rearing and training children. The exemptions
allowed in income tax returns on account of dependent children are some recognition of these
services, being in fact a form of family allowances.
32. Money may profitably be invested by society in children as well as in machinery,
buildings, transport and so on. Mr. G. L. Wood, Lecturer in Economics at the University of
Melbourne, dealt with this point in his evidence before the Commission, saying :—“ There
is no doubt that the ordinary play of economic forces tends unduly to limit investment in the
persons and capacities of wage-earners, with the result that the marginal returns to resources
invested in the poor and their children would promise to be higher than the marginal return
to resources invested in machinery and plant. The ground for this belief is that the wage-earners
are nearly always without sufficient funds to invest adequately in their own or their children’s
capacities .... Emphasis should be laid on the fact that the proportion of Australian
children who pass their earlier years in comparative poverty, or at least some portion of their
earlier years, is much larger than the proportion of families who are in that condition at any
one time . . . Despite our boasted prosperity, far too large a proportion of the children
of our wage-earners pass some portion of their school-age in households where the standards
of life, health and decency do not measure up to any reasonable optimum. Properly
administered help to these children constitutes our best form of investment.”


33. The weight of expert evidence suggests to us the correctness of this view. Support
for it was given by Mr. Peter Board, ex-Director of Education, in New South Wales, who, giving
evidence as Chairman of the Soldiers’ Children’s Education Board under the Repatriation
Department, spoke of an “ extraordinary waste of ability in the community, and when asked
whether it was due to poverty or lack of direction, replied that he considered it due to both,
but mostly to poverty. We further agree with Professor Shann s belief that ‘the human capital
of the country is as likely to respond to further investment as its fields and factories. Provisions
that will materially benefit the health and growth of children and the well-being of mothers may
be considered a true national economy. It may be expected that the quality of child life will
improve and that many mothers will be relieved of anxieties which now impair their health
and efficiency.
34. The gain to the nation from the resulting improvements in family life would be very
great; child labour and the labour of mothers with dependent children would become less
frequent; the improved health of mothers would probably be reflected in a reduction of the
infantile and maternal death rates ; that portion of social and industrial discontent now arising
from the necessities of the larger families carrying on an unequal struggle because of insufficient
income would be greatly modified. In short, by this widening of the ambit of social justice,
a valuable contribution would be made to the peace, order and good government of the
Commonwealth.
35. The diversion of a part of the national income to the mothers would probably increase
on the whole the expenditure on consumption goods more desirable in the interests of the
community, e.g., on food and clothing and household necessities. It was pointed out that such
purchasers use a large proportion of goods made in Australia in primary or secondary industries.
Professor Copland also stressed this point when discussing the reduction in saving which
is involved in taxation, pointing out that not all the funds would entrench on savings, as part
of the taxation would have been spent by the taxpayers on consumption goods, probably less
desirable from a national point of view. He offered the opinion that an economist on the
whole considers a limited application of child endowment as economically sound.
A COMMONWEALTH SCHEME.
36. Any scheme of family allowances should be controlled by the Commonwealth. Control
by Federal authority is recommended in the first place because of the difficulty of ensuring uniform
or similar action by the various State authorities, and in the second place because it seems wiser
for the Commonwealth to control what is more a question of social reform than one of wage
fixation.
37. Though the question of family allowances cannot be wholly dissociated from the
question of the amounts of wages fixed by the various arbitration authorities, particularly in
view of the consideration of family responsibilities already implied in the various awards, yet
in their essence family allowances-belong to the class of provisions such as the old-age and invalid
pensions and the maternity allowances which are already administered by the Commonwealth.
38. Any reform which represents a direct development of the social conscience and
expresses itself in provision for certain categories of citizens, who by reason of youth, old age
or disability beyond their control have received less than the degree of justice recognized in
current social theory, should be a measure which affects all Australian citizens falling within
the particular category defined. State Governments may lead the way in proposals which show
some definite development of social theory, but ideally such measures should be for the benefit
of all Australian citizens. Moreover such action by one State, if not adopted by its neighbours,
penalizes that State industrially in competition with the others.
39. To make any system of child endowment wait either upon its adoption by all the
legislative bodies in Australia, or upon special agreement between the several State Governments
and the Federal Government, would be to delay it indefinitely. Even if a measure of agreement
were secured regarding the introduction of the scheme, there might be deviation from the normal
practice by different States at a later date. To wait for a change in the Constitution which
would give the Commonwealth power to regulate all industrial matters would be to shelve the
proposal.
COMMONWEALTH POWER.
40. A scheme, simple and uniform in character, of allowances paid by the Commonwealth
need add no further confusion to the confusions already existing in industrial arbitration in
Australia, and might even tend towards simplifying the fixing of wages. The Commonwealth s
power to fix wages is limited to cases where the parties concerned have come under the


jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration for the settlement
of inter-State disputes. It has, however, power to expend money for such a purpose as
allowances for children.
41. Sir Robert Garran giving evidence before the Commission stated as to the powers
of the Commonwealth in taxation : “It seems to me there is no difficulty in collecting by means
of taxation on any basis whatever provided it complies with the requirement of being uniform
throughout the Commonwealth.” In regard to the power of appropriation he said : “ Generally
speaking, I have always considered that section 81 was an absolute power of appropriation for
general purposes and the Commonwealth Parliament has always acted on that supposition.”
42. And again : “ There is in the Commonwealth Constitution no limitation whatever
of the purposes for which money may be raised by taxation. The Commonwealth Government
can increase its taxation to any extent, and what constitutional or other reason there can be
for limiting its power to spend the money so raised, I confess lam unable to see.” On the other
hand, dealing with Child Endowment as a part of the industrial law and involving a readjustment
of the wage system, Sir Robert said : “It seems to me that there are great difficulties in the
way of the Commonwealth controlling the rate of wages or making a readjustment of the wage
system by means of Child Endowment.”
43. It is clear from these statements that in the opinion of the Federal Solicitor-General
the Commonwealth can both raise money and disburse money for the purpose of children’s
allowances, though it cannot under its present powers base such a system on any readjustment
of wage fixation.
THE FINANCIAL PROVISION.
•*
44. It is our opinion that money for children’s allowances should be a charge on the
Consolidated Revenue of the Commonwealth. The Commission has considered suggestions made
by witnesses that the money should be raised by a special tax, direct or indirect, as for example
a tax on luxuries or a poll tax, but we consider that any extra taxation rendered necessary should
be obtained through an increase in Federal income tax which has lately been reduced, and that
the other types of tax suggested would not be scientific in their application.
45. Income Tax is more difficult to pass on than other forms of taxation and less likely
to be reflected in an increased cost of living. It may be noted that the Colwyn Report (“ British
National Debt and Taxation ” Part 1, Section IV., 3-4) endorses this view. Professor Mills
argued that “ to make child endowment clearly depend upon a fund raised by additional taxation
is to make clear the issue and to define both the cost and the benefits.” Indirect taxation
would affect more certainly the cost of living, as it would certainly be passed on in the increased
cost of products. It should be noted that one advantage of using the Commonwealth Income
Tax to meet the cost of children’s allowances is that the poorer States would pay relatively less
in taxation, but would receive the same endowment per child as the other States. This type
of procedure assists in the automatic adjustment of disabilities experienced by some States.
46. Under the New South Wales Family Endowment Act the money required is raised
by a tax on industry as a percentage payment of the total amount paid out in wages. This
method we reject as unjust. Obviously it must act as a discouragement to the payment of high
wages, and to the employment of skilled men. As a rule the greater the average amount paid in
wages per employee by any firm the greater the tax paid by that firm, while at the same time the
smaller the benefits received by its employees. It seems unfair, also, to burden industry alone
directly in order to pay allowances to children whose fathers are not employees in industry. But
even for those in industry, a crude percentage tax on the wages bill is inequitable in its incidence.
Not only is it to the advantage of employers to pay lower wages, but no account is taken of their
profits. A large amount paid in wages may go with small profits and vice versa. This type
of tax offends the economic principle of “ ability to pay ” which we consider the right foundation
on which to raise money for family allowances.
47. Further, the enactment of a system of family allowances through a Federal law,
and the payment of such allowances from the consolidated revenue of the Commonwealth would
make much easier the extension of the benefits of the allowances to the families of those who
are not employees. The desirability of this has already been stressed, and it appears to us
essential that no system should have the effect of encouraging fathers to prefer wage-work to
self-employment as would happen were the benefits confined to the families of wage-earner?


WAGE RE-DISTRIBUTION.
48. The recommendations above outlined involve the rejection of any scheme of family
allowances which would depend upon a reduction in the wages now paid under any award, State
or Federal, to workers without children. It has been contended by many witnesses that the
only logical way to establish family allowances, at least for the families of employees, is by a
re-distribution of the present wage-fund. Those representatives of employers who have not
rejected child endowment have advocated that it should be established in this way. They
assume that under the living wage theory the single man and the married man and the man
with fewer children than the unit provided for are being paid too much, while the man with a
family larger than the specified family is obviously receiving too little to attain the standard
implied in the award of the Court. Some advocates of Child Endowment have referred to
mythical wives and children who are being paid for by industry while other real children are
not being paid for. It is supposed that in the net result over 2,000,000 children above the number
actually existent are, as a matter of fact, being paid for in the wages disbursed by employers,
in addition to over 1,000,000 wives who do not exist.
49. On examination this is not so clear. In the first place it is assumed in making this
calculation that all workers are working under awards, whereas, as a fact, large classes of workers
work outside the jurisdiction of any tribunal. It may be that many receive wages equal to
those working under awards, but there are no figures to show how many, and a large number
certainly receive less. The Commonwealth Statistician’s figures indicate that on an average
about 8 per cent, of workers are always unemployed.
50 Secondly, these numbers of mythical wives and children assume that all wage awards
provide for a man,’wife and three children, whereas State awards in New South Wales (until
recently) and in Western Australia have purported to provide for a man, wife and two children.
The basic wage m New South Wales since June, 1927, is supposed to provide only for a man
and wife Thirdly it has been assumed that the Federal basic wage does, m fact, provide for a
man wife and three children, although this has been denied by critics of the data on which the
Harvester Judgment was made. The only careful standard of living inquiry for the whole
Commonwealth, viz., that made by the Basic Wage Commission of 1919-20 arrived at a cost
considerably higher than the Harvester Basic Wage for keeping a man, wife and three children.
Mr. J. T. Sutcliffe, in a paper read before the Science Congress m Adelaide in August, 19*7,
discussing the basis of wage-fixation said :
“ Enough has been said to show that the Harvester basic wage was not determined
as the result of a complete inquiry into all the items of necessary expenditure but as
the result of a partial investigation and the adoption of a daily wage being paid by
what Mr. Justice Higgins described as reputable employers. It is clear, therefore, that
it was the adoption of a rate which had been secured by workers as a. result of
competition for jobs. Such a rate, one would expect, would bear some relation to the
average requirements of the workers. Such average requirements would be arrived at
by the competition between single men with no family responsibility, married men with
no children, and married men with varying numbers of dependent children. Statistics
show that if the number of children be divided among all workers, single and married,
the average would be approximately one.' Therefore, it might be expected that the
average wage secured as the result of competition would be about sufficient to provide
for that average family of a man, wife, and one child. It is possible to determine the
requirements of a family of any particular composition according to the Basic Wage
Commission s findings, and it is remarkable to find (a) the cost of a family comprising
man, wife and one child is approximately 79 per cent, of the cost of a family comprising
man’ wife and three children, (b) that the Harvester Wage in 1907 was approximately
79 percent, of the Basic Wage Commission’s finding calculated on 1907 prices. The
Harvester Wage, therefore, was not, in 1907. an adequate wage for the expenditure
of a family of five.”
51. Thus, on closer examination, many of the mythical children disappear even as myths.
The advocates of a re-distribution of the wage-fund are on firmer ground when they argue that
even if the wage provides only for a man, wife and one child, even so all children are included,
seeing that the proportion of children dependent on employees is roughly . 9 to every adult male
employee. To provide the full cost of keeping all workers’ children, it would be necessary to
subtract from the wage of each worker only the cost of keeping one child. If it be proposed to pay
as endowment only part of the cost of keeping a child, still less would need to be subtracted. *ive
shillings from each wage would provide ss. for each child. The man with one child would get


Ins ss. back so that only the childless would really suffer reduction. The man with two children
would get 10s. back and be ss. to the good ; the man with three children would receive 15s. and
be 10s. to the good ; and so on.
52. Not only employers’ representatives, but at least two other witnesses (Professor Brigden
and Mr. Sutcliffe) have advocated child endowment by re-distribution, considering it an essential
part of any scheme. Some assume that the total wages fund is the workers’ share, and that the
problem is one of allocating that share more equitably, in the light of the doctrine of the living
wage. Mr. Sutcliffe expressly dissociated himself from any opinion that the national dividend
was justly distributed as between workers and others, but considered that child endowment should
on no account be made the occasion of any vertical re-distribution of national income, should such
be thought desirable. Such injustice, if it exists, should, in his opinion, be remedied in other ways.
53. On the other hand, Mr. G. L. Wood, of Melbourne University said : “ Child Endowment
and labour cost must be regarded as distinct questions, the former as a social recognition of the
service of motherhood or of the rights of the child, and the latter as a recognition of the service
of work. And again, “ I would stress most emphatically the danger of any such manipulation of
existing wages as has been proposed in connection with the temporary cost of living bonus of 3s.
(Mr. Justice Powers’ 1921 award) which was added to the Harvester Award. Such manipulation
would cut right across my belief that the question of wages and child endowment should be kept
separate.”
54. Professor Brigden proposed, in addition to raising £2,000,000, by taxation, to take 2s.
of this 3s. “ lag ” which he considered has been reflected in the State awards, although it
has been added expressly only to the Federal Awards. It may be said in passing
that this “ reflection ” was not obvious in New South Wales where, before the reduction
in 1927 of the family unit to man and wife, the Federal Basic Wage was £4 9s. 6d. and the State
wage £4 ss. It is true that the Federal wage nominally provided for a man, wife and three
children while the State wage provided nominally only for a man, wife and two children. As
these wages did, in fact, provide for families of every size, it w r ould be absurd casuistry to contend
that a wage could be made more generous by reducing the unit for which in theory it provided.
New South Wales with the highest cost of living had the lowest effective State wage, and there is
no proof that the 3s. allowed by the Federal Court to cover the “ lag ” of wages behind prices was
reflected in the New South Wales Basic Wage, nor indeed, in wages in Western Australia, South
Australia, or Queensland. ✓
55. It has been pointed out that this method of approach, viz., the creation of a Child
Endowment Fund by a deduction from wages, whether that deduction be nominally from the
“ lag ” money or any other part of the wage, would tend to limit the application of any system of
child endowment to workers under awards, but, even accepting that limitation, the objection has
been offered that injustice would be done to the worker whose wage is reduced. Witnesses have
contended that the worker’s wage is his own which he has earned as payment for work done at the
value at which that work is currently estimated. Considering himself as a member of the
community in receipt of a certain wage he asks why only such as himself receiving a low income
should be taxed to provide for certain children, while men with much higher incomes pay nothing.
If he can afford to help to pay for this social reform, surely richer men can afford to do so much
more easily. When considering the equity of the transference of income he does not consider
himself as a member of a special class of wage-earners, but as a member of the whole community.
It has been pointed out in rebuttal of this argument, viz., that what a man earns is his own and
should not be taken from him, that income taxation does, in principle, take from a man what he
has earned. The single man, or the childless man, would, however, not feel the same objection if,
by a lowering of the income tax level, he found himself contributing along with others reached by
the same machinery towards the fund for family allowances.
56. Whether Child Endowment be regarded as a necessary benefit to certain classes of
citizens or as a social investment, it appears to us more equitable to provide it out of income tax
levied in proportion to individual capacity to pay. The broadest backs should bear burdens
carried in the interests of the community as a whole. At times when wages were rising it might
have been wise to divert some of the increase to the larger families instead of continuing the flat
rate scale of payments which re-act harshly on such families, but such opportunities have been
missed (as in New South Wales, in 1919, when the Maintenance of Children Bill was defeated,
and in Queensland, in 1925, as recommended by the Queensland Economic Commission.) The
difference, however, between receiving what might or might not have been given, and losing
what one already has is a wide one.
57. The successful application of a system of re-distribution of income to provide children’s
allowances within the group of employees of the Commonwealth Public Service has been quoted
to controvert the argument against re-distribution of wages. i\n experiment which worked


without opposition or discontent within a limited group under one employer, marry of whom enjoy
assured employment for life, together with gradual increments in salary, might not so easily
be applied to a large heterogeneous mass of workers living under widely different conditions and
working for different employers.
s£. To one of such workers without children a positive reduction of wage might appear
simply as a loss because the future compensation of possible payments to himself would seem too
remote, in his less secure economic life, to be balanced against immediate loss. He might feel that
he was simply paying for the other fellow’s children out of a comparatively small income and
that he might be affected by future legislation or change in his status wherein he became
self-employed, or not employed, so as to lose future compensation even if he did become the head
of a family. But, even granting for the moment that it would be posssible to re-distribute the
existing wage fund, the chief objection to it would still remain, that such a scheme could touch
only those wage-earners who are affected by basic wage declarations. There is also the objection
that the present generation of older men would suffer the reduction after they had brought up
their families on the flat rate wage, an obvious injustice from every point of view.
59. Another strong objection to this course would be the practical difficulties of putting it
into operation. The volume of casual and contract work in Australia is considerable and a good
deal is piece work. These factors, in our opinion, would add seriously to the administrative
complications of the system. Until there is but one industrial authority in Australia and all
workers are subject to its awards, with adequate provision for the hazaids of unemployment,
any system of wages re-distribution would be full of unjust anomalies and unworkable. The
comparison with insurance schemes is, in our opinion, invalid, as the having of children is not
an unavoidable “ risk ” in the sense in which fire and accident and illness are risks.
THE DOMESTIC UNIT.
60 The evidence available indicated, as stated, that in those cases where there are three
children, the basic wage is doubtfully capable of providing a reasonable standard of comfort.
It is of significance that in the three decisions (1926-27-28) of Mr. Justice Dwyer, of the Western
Australian Arbitration Court, the domestic unit contemplated as covered by the basic wage
is a man, wife and two children and not three. Yet the 1926 Award was for Perth £4 55.,
compared with the Federal wage for the same city of £4. On the index numbers for food,
groceries, and rent (all houses) the Perth £4 ss. was then equivalent in purchasing power to
£4 13s. 4d. in Melbourne and £4 15s. 6d. in Sydney, although the Federal Award rate for those
two cities was only £4 7s. 6d. and £4 11s. respectively. At the present time the comparison
is not substantially different.
61. Clearly, if the Western Australian State award provided for but two children, it is
difficult to support the claim that the Federal Awards provided for three. In our judgment
all the families on the basic wage with more than two children were being denied the standard
affirmed by the Courts as the declared minimum standard. Indeed, but for the “ Powers Lag ”
and the use by the Court of index figures for food, rent and groceries only (omitting clothing
and miscellaneous), the Federal wage would, as already stated, provide on the Basic Wage
Commission standard for a family with but one child. In Western Australia there were
10,293 male workers, each of whose families exceeded two dependent children, and their children
totalled 31,708 who were thus inadequately provided for. The number represented 66 per
cent, of the total of all dependent children in the State. In the Commonwealth the children
in families in excess of two total 1,177,297, or over 64 per cent, of the whole. If in the future
the basic wage provides for man, wife and two children, then the number left in each family for
whom other provision should be made is 582,264. By a declaration directing the Courts to
fix wages for a family of four, the legislatures could cover all the dependent children by a
system of family allowances commencing where the Courts’ average ceased, the number of
children affected being as stated fewer than 600,000.
62. Why should wages be computed to provide for a man, wife and two children ? Why
not fix wages on the basis of an unmarried man, or that of a man and wife, or man, wife and
one or three or five children ? Here is where considerations of practice and workability cannot
be thrust aside. Neither economics nor sociology is an exact science and their relation to each
other in the problem of life and living is such that what would appear as logical principles are
not always capable of rigid application. Men and women must live, and if worthy of employment
at all, deserve to be paid enough to permit them to go on working. An industry that does not
pay its workers enough to enable them to maintain themselves is extracting more vitality from
its employees than it is returning to them. It is, therefore, parasitic, and either other sources
are bearing the burden of supporting its workers, or the workers themselves are making severe
inroads on their strength.


63. The declaration by Mr. Justice Higgins that industry ought to pay a living wage not
only recognized these dicta, but involved the corollary, as he affirmed, that an industry which
could not comply with the obligation ought not to exist. The right of men and women to live
obviously implies much more than the mere right of their own personal subsistence. The normal
life includes the reproduction of the species; it postulates the right of marriage and the coming
of children. When industry is said to have an obligation to pay enough to its workers to enable
them- to continue working and maintain reasonable health and well-being, there is involved
the well-being of the worker’s natural state which is not that of himself alone, but includes his
wife and their dependent children. Furthermore, industry has not only an obligation to pay
a living wage to the worker to include the normal family conditions of the worker as being
merged in his own being—it has no other source of supply from which to draw the continuous
flow of its labour agent. The provision, therefore, of children to grow up and replace the
worn-out units in the labour army is an economic necessity, and should be included in full
current “ cost of production ” just as surely as replacement charges for other producing agents.
The worker’s normal life cannot be separated from the life of his wife and children.
64. Therefore, the claim that wages be computed on other than a family basis is
negatived from the point of view of industry as well as from that of purely family considerations,
and if this were not adequate for its rejection, there are the problems inherent in its application
which make it undesirable.
65. Should wages be based on the circumstances of the unmarried worker, as has been
suggested in evidence, then other provision would have to be made for the full maintenance
cost of wife and children. This course is neither socially desirable nor economically workable.
To begin with, it means that the male breadwinner will no longer be responsible for the financial
cost of the subsistence, first of his wife and then of any children who may be born to them.
The State out of its revenue must assume the whole obligation. No mere subvention will meet
the case, as the worker will be paid solely for what suffices for himself. If the unmarried man
is taken as the wage unit, it will mean that allowances will need to be paid not only in respect
of each of the 1,824,742 children, but also in respect of the wives of the adult wage-earning
population as well.
66. This colossal proposal is not administratively practicable. It entirely reverses the
established principles of social and industrial practice as they concern relationship with the
State, and it would revolutionize the organic unity of the family and involve a financial contract
which the State would effect with wives and children in their individual right, apart from the
husband and fatheT ; they would be independent of his exertions, and the probability is that
by the effacing or even the minimizing of his incentive to provide for them the State would be
ultimately unable to meet the obligations which this plan of wage fixing would transfer to it.
One further and crucial objection may be stated ; those who would allow the existing position
of the larger families to continue until the present industrial system is revolutionized by the
adoption of the unmarried worker as the wage unit are merely sacrificing those who now suffer
in order to plan theoretical utopias.
67. It was submitted in evidence, however, that the unit of man and wife would be a
sound wa<>e basis with a system of allowances for children superimposed. The weakness in
this proposition is that it would involve the same objection in principle as that mentioned earlier
the State would have to make full financial provision for the maintenance of the children.
As stated, we reject as wrong any proposal that would transfer to the State the whole financial
responsibility for children. Children are not liabilities only, but assets of their parents even
while dependent. They are a source of enjoyment and happiness, and the work of the father
out of the home and of the mother within the home should pay the price of that enjoyment. It
is when the price exacted is too heavy to be tolerable and inflicts damage on the family that
allowances for children should supplement the father’s efforts.
68. Chiefly it was urged by these witnesses that during bachelorhood, which ends on the
average for the Commonwealth at the age of 29, ample provision should be included in the wage
to save for equipping a home and marrying at an early age. But, if single men are moving
towards marriage, they are also moving towards fatherhood. The average number of
dependent children per" male householder, married and unmarried, in the Commonwealth is
1.45 ; in the case of married male householders the percentage is 1.64. The male adult wage
and 5 salary-earners who are married and heads of families total 633,149, and the number
of dependent children is 1,111,291, the average for each working out at 1.74. The only
practicable alternative to the unmarried worker unit is the average family unit. Once it
is conceded that the former is undesirable, the latter becomes the only logical formula.


69. But if the average number of children under 14 years is shown to be 1.74 per cent,
per married worker, why fix two children as the number to be associated with the man and wife
in the computing of wages ? The reason is found at once in the meaning of the term
“ dependent children.” It is extraordinary that the assumption that the dependency of
children ceases at 14 years should be entertained by Courts or Statisticians. To contend
that children are wholly self-supporting at 14 years is not justified by the facts. Of those
between 14 and 21 years of age, 40 per cent, are not classified either as wage and salary-earners
or working on their own account, or as employers, or assisting. Many of them are continuing
school and other instructional courses, a number are physically unfitted to maintain themselves,
and a number*are prohibited by law from being industrially employed. In the case of those who
are working, no authority has determined what the minimum wage for self-support is ; the
rates for apprentices differ substantially from those fixed [for non-apprentices ; thousands of
youths move from job to job in dead-end occupations and their periods of intermittent
employment are numerous and not statistically ascertainable.
70. Arbitrarily to select 14 years as the abrupt ending of the period of dependency for
children, therefore, is unjustified, and a refusal to fix two children as the average number of those
dependent on the average married worker because the precise figure at 14 years is 1.74 would
be to compel the wage to bear an obligation beyond its range. The extent to which the
earnings of children over 14 fall short of full maintenance is the measure by which the domestic
obligation of the parent is increased, and his wage should be computed to meet it. The need for
this margin is emphasized when it is remembered that the natural dependants of the wage-earner
include also classes of adults for whom the State does not provide full maintenance, such
as old-age and invalid pensioners, workers temporarily unable through sickness or unemployment
to earn wages, and fathers and mothers or other relatives deprived by various means of a
livelihood, who, not being in receipt of State assistance, are by the circumstances of their lives
dependent on their wage-earnihg families. All these classes, generally speaking, are ranked
as having natural claims on their family groups. They rank with the children under 14 years
as sharers in the family pool, and a family wage should not be computed in such rigid sharpness
as to exclude them absolutely, which would happen were wages restricted to the bare needs of
the unmarried worker or the childless married worker.
MAN, WIFE, AND TWO CHILDREN.
71. That a man and wife and two children is the normal average measure for a family
wage in Australia is further demonstrated by the fact that two Courts which specially investigated
the question of the domestic unit decided on the four-unit family. In 1914 Mr. Justice Heydon,
of New South Wales, on an analysis of statistics found that the average number of dependent
children under 14 years per family in the Commonwealth was between 1.7 and 1.9. After
making an allowance for those over fourteen not working or self-supporting, he fixed the standard
at two. In 1926 Mr. Justice Dwyer, of Western Australia, made a similar investigation. He
said : “ The Court has an obligation imposed upon it to ascertain specifically apart from
precedent or practice in any other Court, what the domestic obligation of the average worker
should be. Having decided that the average worker should be taken to be the average' married
worker the next matter for consideration was : What were the domestic obligations of the
average married worker ?” Having quoted the latest census “Bulletin” (1921) showing that
the average issue of husbands for Australia was 3.38, the learned Justice summarized the
statistical data submitted by saying that it was established that “ The average number of
children under 14 years of age per married male between the ages of 21 and 60 in Australia
was 1.8, and the average number of children under 16 years of age per married male aged 21 to
60 was 1.99.” The figures confirm almost to a decimal point those indicated by Mr. Justice
Heydon twelve years previously.
72. Both authorities declared dependency did not cease at 14 years and both decided
that the domestic obligations of the average worker should be regarded as including a wife and
two dependent children. Investigation, therefore, has confirmed the appropriateness of a
wage which will provide for a family of four. The adoption of this course would not involve
any disruption of the general principles of existing practice, except in a limited sense, in New
South Wales and Queensland State Awards. For the rest of Australia, the four-unit standard
would not necessitate any appreciable change in arbitration procedure ; it would not call for
any re-distribution of wages ; nor would it in the case of the Commonwealth Court require
any alteration in the law, or in the relation of State Industrial Tribunals to the Commonwealth
Court of Conciliation and Arbitration.
F.24/28. —8


73. All proposals that the Commonwealth should be the sole source of industrial control
depend on the doubtful prospect of far-reaching changes in the Commonwealth Constitution
being effected. To delay justice for the families in excess of two while this protracted struggle
for industrial sovereignty for the Commonwealth and the entire evacuation of the industrial
sphere by the States is being waged is, in effect, to deny it. The Commonwealth Parliament
has power, immediate power, to enact a system of allowances for children. The logical
corollary to a wage that provides but for two children is that assistance shall be given to those
families which exceed two in proportion as they do exceed it.
PAYMENT BY RESULTS.
74. A number of witnesses, especially representatives of employers, have maintained
before the Commission that the present wage-fixing system is wrong in principle and that they
would prefer some method of payment by results. But even were such a system brought into
general use, there would still appear the need for a minimum wage for the unskilled worker
and for those in occupations where piecework rates cannot be applied. In fixing this minimum
should family responsibilities be taken into account ? A wage which would merely keep an
unskilled worker from starvation and would not enable him to marry and have children, would
not be tolerated in a community which has gone so far in recognizing the normal needs
of the individual in the legal fixing of wages.
75. Even if it could be shown that fewer families would need child endowment under a
system of payment by results than under a flat wage system, some families would still need it.
A man’s earning power is not necessarily commensurate with the size of his family, and with
the best will in the world a father of a large family might find himself amongst the slowest
workers. 111-luck and ill-health, as well as lack of ability, are factors which lower capacity
even when there is no lack of zeal.
PAYMENT TO THE MOTHER.
76. Almost all witnesses who have favoured any scheme of children’s allowances at all
have suggested payments being made to the mother. This has generally been advocated on
the ground that the mother is the direct provider for the child, knows its needs, and is, as a matter
of fact, in charge of the expenditure in the home.
77. There was a consensus of opinion that the mother should receive the payments
direct, and that they should not be identified with that part of the wage paid directly by the
employer to the employee, even were the allowance to be provided out of some fund established
within the industrial world. We entirely agree with this view.
PAYMENT IN KIND.
78. Several witnesses urged that any payments made on behalf of children should not
be in money, but in kind, e.g. food or clothing. Their contention was that when money is given
there is no guarantee that it will be spent on the child, or, if so spent, that it will be wisely and
economically spent, whereas, if food or clothing is supplied, it is much more probable that
it will serve the purpose for which it is intended. Objections offered to this suggestion were
that this would be much more a “ charity ” or a “ dole ” than cash payments; that
“ standardized ” food and clothing could hardly be supplied to cover a very wide variety of
cases ; and that such a system would be much more difficult to administer than one of payments
by money.
79. Some witnesses had in mind the giving of orders on tradesmen as is done, for example,
by various benevolent societies where the recipient is given a limited choice of goods which may
be ordered up to a certain value. This point of view would appear to be founded upon mistrust
of the capacity of the mother to use the money wisely. A number of witnesses who took this
view, either in their statements or in reply to questions, were connected with various
charitable or benevolent agencies and accustomed to dealing with cases of acute distress and,
probably, often with cases of a less degree of efficiency in household management than is usual
in the average home. Other witnesses directly acquainted with homes run on low wages were
emphatic that the mother is, on the whole, a better judge of the needs of the individual child
than a staff of officials or technical experts dictating a standardized regime.
80. In our opinion, there is no reason to differentiate between the expending of the part
of the income received as family endowment and that received as wages which the mother
already expends. Some families would not apply for relief in kind, though they might be willing
to comply with legal regulations leading to the payment of endowment as a social right.


UNEMPLOYMENT AND CHILDREN.
81. The need for research into the causes of, and for some organized attempt to deal with,
unemployment, is glaringly obvious in our communities. Allowances paid for children would
have at least the effect of assuring to the home some regular income during shorter or longer
spells of unemployment. Since allowances would help to meet rent and the cost of essential
foods and so keep the home together for the larger families, they might also ultimately do
something, by securing a better standard of nurture in the home, to reduce unemployment
in the next generation by raising the physical and mental standard of those who will be the
employees of the future.
82. More than allowances for children is needed to meet the problem of unemployment
but any scheme of social insurance that may be devised will need to be supplemented when
the breadwinner is out of work, by allowances proportionate to the size of the family so insured.
Children s allowances are not an alternative to unemployment insurance, but an essential
supplement to it. It has been asserted before the Commission that some scheme of
unemployment insurance is essential before even the causes of unemployment can be classified
and understood A scheme of unemployment insurance with even small benefits combined
with a system of allowances for children would dispel a great deal of misery in our communities.
Until some unemployment insurance scheme is framed, the payment of the allowances for
children would take off the sharpest edge of want and anxiety during a season of unemployment.
WIDOWS WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN.
83. The first great class of sufferers relieved by the charitable societies is that of the
unemployed and their families ; the second great class is that which includes families with no
male breadwinner, or whose breadwinner is unable by reason of ill-health to earn any wage or
only an inadequate wage. There is undoubtedly an urgent need for the establishment of pensions
ror widows left without means, or with small means, who have children to support. In these
cases allowances for the children should be supplemented by some allowance for the mother
In New South Wales, the Widows Pensions’ Act of 1925 provides for a payment of £l a week
for a widow who has any children dependent on her, and 10s. for each child so dependent, there
bemg deducted from this amount one pound per annum for each one pound per annum by which
the widow’s income exceeds £7B per annum. (The amount actually paid in rent not exceeding
£7B per annum is deducted from the income of the widow). These amounts do not provide
adequate maintenance for families deprived of the male breadwinner and need to be supplemented
by the mother s efforts, but they have made things much better for such family groups and have
often enabled the widow to keep her children with her instead of having them boarded out
elsewhere by the State.
84. The case of the deserted wife is similar, and when the desertion is undoubted and
she has young children to care for, she should receive similar assistance. It is recommended
that any system of allowances should include payments at a higher rate in such cases, together'
with a payment for the mother at a standard at least equal to the payments provided for widows
with dependent children under the New South Wales Act.
THE SICK OR ABSENT FATHER.
85. The case of a breadwinner who is chronically ill is met to some extent by the Invalid
Pensions paid by the Commonwealth Government, and in some cases also by allowances from
the various State Child Welfare Departments. Temporary sickness of the breadwinner should
be provided for under a system of compulsory Health Insurance. In these cases the allowances
for children would be especially valuable and should be augmented in the absence of income
m t e home through unavoidable causes. As a matter of fact, this is what happens now in
the absence of the male breadwinner when the Child Welfare Departments in the various States
board out children to their own mothers at rates which have been stated before the Commission
as varying from ss. to £l per week, or even to larger sums in very special cases. It is
interesting to note, by the way, that when children are boarded out to persons other than their
own mothers, the payment made is usually 10s. to 12s. a week, (though in some States it may
vary from 7s. to 30s. in certain cases) and a home is selected which is comfortable and well-kept
The evidence pointed to the conclusion that the standard of comfort for such children boarded
out by the State is often distinctly higher than that which can be enjoyed by the children of
a man on the basic wage who has more than three children to support.
86. One effect of the payment of special rates for the children who are without an adult
male breadwinner may be to reduce the number of children living in institutions. Dr Harvey
Sutton, Chief Medical Officer of the New South Wales Department of Public Instruction o- aV e
as his opinion “ A second-rate family is better than a first-rate institution. A third-rate


institution is almost worse than any type of family we know.” These considerations apply
particularly to the children of widowed or deserted mothers. In such cases, the waste of potential
health and ability is obvious when the mother struggles on endeavouring to earn money and
care for her children also. Where she fails to do this (and the task is more than can reasonably
be expected), it is a better investment for the community to supply her with the means for
providing for her children than to take them from her and place them in an institution. The
gain to the happiness of the mother and her children also is obvious.
OBJECTS TO SEEK.
87. It is desirable that any scheme adopted should be as uniform throughout the
Commonwealth and as simple in operation as is consistent with the effective spending of the
money to obtain —
(a) a standard of living for members of the larger families which is the standard
recognized as a minimum standard according to current theory, and
(b) the encouragement as far as possible, having regard to the sum which can be
spent and the need for securing the standard of necessaries implied in (a),
of special training beyond the primary school-leaving age for children who
can profit by it.
Any scheme evolved should be such that, if only a small sum of money can be spent on
it at first, it can easily be extended to cover more adequately the objects in (a) and (b).
88. As the primary object of any system of family allowance is to secure a standard of
maintenance for families beyond a certain size, it appears clear that the lower the income, the
more necessary the allowance. It follows, therefore, that those families who are in receipt of
less than the basic wage have paramount claims, in that their standard of living is inferior to
the accepted minimum standard. Widows with dependent children should be included in this
category. Secondly, families with more than two children whose income does not exceed the
basic wage have the next claim. As it is desirable to prevent the scheme of payments, as far
as possible, from destroying the value of margins for skill, it is our opinion that the scheme of
allowances should be extended to overcome the disparity in standards of men of equal skill arising
from differing sizes of families. The extent to which this can be done will depend upon the
amount of money the Government of the day can make available.
THE RESPONSIBLE AUTHORITY.
89. The question arises whether the amount of the allowance should be. left to the
Commonwealth Parliament or to an Industrial Tribunal to determine. It is objected that if
Parliament fixes the amount its increase may be used as an election “ bribe ” by politicians
without regard to the capacity of the revenue to meet it. But an Industrial Court, too, may
fix an amount or change an amount without close regard to the capacity of the community
to pay. In view of the contention that endowment should be kept apart from wage fixation,
it would seem better to fix an amount by statute to be reviewed, if necessary, at the end of a
certain period. The difficulty associated with “ bribery ”at election time would be no greater
than at present exists in other ways, and it seems to us that in accordance with the principles
of representative government the interests of the community would be amply safeguarded
by the assurance that any change in the amount of the allowance would be made by the authority
on whom would be cast the responsibility of finding the money. A policy to increase taxation,
is not, after all, a favorite election cry with any party. Provision might be made in the Act
for a flat rate to be reviewed at the end of a term of years, and only to be altered then if
the index figures of the cost of essential commodities showed marked change at the end of that
period.
LIMIT OF INCOME.
90. One very difficult point is the question of the family income limit at which the
payment of children’s allowances should cease. Witnesses whose opinions are worthy of respect
have urged that in the interest of administrative simplicity, allowances should be paid to all
children of the prescribed age without regard to the income of the parents. It has been argued
that not much would be saved if allowances were paid to all, and that, both in order to secure
administrative simplicity and in order to avoid any stigma of charity, it is not worth while to
exclude the comparatively few children whose fathers have an income, say, of over £3OO a year


91. The experience so far obtained from the administration of the New South Wales Act
and of the New Zealand Family Allowances Act (1926) would tend to prove that such estimates of
the number of children in income groups below a certain figure do not accord with the number
shoswn in applications actually made for endowment. The only figures of income available are
thooe obtained from income tax returns, and it is probable that a good many returns are not
made when the income is just above the taxable level. Then, further, there are no actual returns
of income along with the sizes of families, except those obtained by noting the number of children
included in allowances for exemption from tax for each dependent child where the income is
not otherwise below the taxable limit.
92. The distribution of families of varying sizes for the whole population is applied, to
any one income level as a theoretical measure of the number of children in families receiving
incomes at that level. Such estimates must be hypothetical only. If only a limited sum of
money can be expended, therefore, and it is desired to expend it on families where the need
of the children is probably greatest, it cannot be recommended that allowances be paid
irrespective of income. There may be other considerations such as the importance of encouraging
the fullest opportunities for children of thrifty and devoted parents whose incomes may not be
amongst the lowest incomes group, and the importance of not reducing the incentive of workers
to acquire skill. But even if such problems as these deserve attention, they cannot remove the
fundamental principle of such allowances, viz., that all children in the community should, as
far as possible, have the possibility of the minimum standard of living implied in current wage
awards. To pay money to families for whom this standard of living is already assured, and so
to be obliged to pay less to those where the standard of living is lacking, would be a use of funds
not easily to be justified by reference to any principle of mere universality in the payment of
such allowances. The principle of expediency has been appealed to, but it might prove a costly
expediency. Both economy and social justice would point to the need for an income limit,
though it has, indeed, been argued that social justice demands payment ,to all. On the
principles set out in this report, social justice could not be invoked to support universal payments.
As to the fear that allowances may be regarded as charity if confined to those with lower incomes,
experience of the working of the New South Wales Act goes to prove that payments of this kind
assured by law are soon regarded as a right of citizenship, even when an income limit is set.
93. The case of the Maternity Allowance which is paid on the birth of all children
irrespective of the parents’ income has been quoted by a number of witnesses, but the payments
in that case are much smaller and less frequent and the sum involved is not comparable with
that needed to provide any scheme of children s allowances that would be worth while.
94. Both in New South Wales and in New Zealand the numbers receiving payment as
endowment for children have proved to be much smaller than was anticipated. It is I- 1116
that the former Act has not been in operation long enough for all claimants to have been
discovered, but it is anticipated that even the final number will not exceed two-thirds of the
original estimate. In the case of the New Zealand Act the payments are much smaller (2s.
for each child beyond the second on an income limit of £4 per week), so perhaps more of those
entitled have not troubled to apply. In the New South Wales Act the upper limit is not a fixed
one, but varies with the size of the family, being the basic wage plus ss. for each dependent
child. Thus the New South Wales basic wage being £4 55., the family income of any family
with three dependent children would be made up to the sum of £5 by whatever sum it fell short
of £5 provided that sum did not exceed 15s. (i.e., £4 ss. plus 15s. being ss. for each of three
children.) Endowment is paid for all dependent children within the income limit fixed m this
way. There are difficulties associated with this method, notably the difficulty of ascertaining
the true income of applicants who are casually or intermittently employed and also the difficulty
of the possible reduction of the margin received by the skilled man as compared with the
unskilled'. The scheme does reach the families whose resources are scantiest for the maintenance
of their dependent children.
THE COST.
95. The question of the income limit beyond which allowances shall not be paid, and also
of the type of scheme to be adopted, is entirely governed by the total sum which the Common-
wealth Government will devote to the purpose.
96. To provide allowances for all children at the rate of £lO per year per child, excluding
the first two in any family would cost about £6,000,000 ; on the only statistics available it would
appear that by restricting the payments to children of parents receiving less than £3OO per annum
this scheme would cost about £5,400,000 ; by making the income limit £250 a year, the cost
would not exceed £4,500,000. Although an exact figure m this connection is not deducible
from the evidence available, the probability is that the cost would be considerably lower.


97. If the scheme were restricted to an application to the Commonwealth of the system
now operating in New South Wales, the cost would be about £4,152,000 according to the estimate
of Mr. Waites, the New South Wales Government Statistician.
# 98* A modification of the New South Wales scheme by which allowances would only
be paid commencing at the third child in each family, except in cases where the income is less
than the basic wage, would cost under £2 000,000.
99. To meet the cost of our recommendation that allowances be paid to widows with
dependent children on the principles of the New South Wales Widows’ Pensions Act, we estimate
that the sum required would be about £1,520,000.
100. As, in our opinion, it is important that encouragement should be given to children
to proceed with instruction, either technical or otherwise, beyond the age of 14 years, we propose
that the definition of dependency should be extended to include such children up to the age
of at least 16 years in the dependent group ; this would increase the cost of each type of scheme
proportionately, but not to any burdensome degree.
101. If payments are as a rule to be made only after the birth of the third dependent
child, it is clear that in justice payments should be made in certain cases for the first and second
child when, even with those payments, the family income does not exceed the basic wage adopted.
The cost of this addition would depend on the extent of the recognition of the claims of these
children. It may be noted that the estimate of the New South Wales Family Endowment
Commissioner is that in the case of 60 per cent, of the applications the family income is below
the basic wage.
METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION.
102. In its Invalid and Old-Age Pensions and Maternity Allowances Departments, the
the Commonwealth Treasury has already an organization capable of being used to administer
a system of allowances. This organization operates in all States and, by using the Post Office
for effecting individual payments, a satisfactory service would be assured. Considerable work
would be involved in determining the initial claims on the fund, but in principle this would not
be more exacting than that now experienced by the Old-Age and Invalid Pensions Department.
The type of scheme operating would influence considerably the magnitude of the work.
COST OF ADMINISTRATION.
103. No precise estimate of the cost of administration is practicable until a particular
scheme has been decided on. Generally speaking, the experience of the Treasury in respect
of pensions payments is that every 100 payments cost 18s. 6d., which is now paid to the Post
Office Department as commission. We estimate that with an income limit of £3OO in respect
to children excluding the first two, and payments to widows with dependent children, there
would be about 250,000 family claims. It would not be necessary to pay for each child in the
family separately. If payments were made fortnightly this would entail about 6,500,000
payments per annum, costing about £60,000. The administrative costs including office rent
and salaries we estimate, on the data supplied by the Secretary to the Commonwealth Treasury,
would be about £33,000 or a total administrative cost of about £lOO,OOO. It would seem wise
to review the income of applicants more often than once a year ; returns every six months ought
not to make the administration too difficult once the scheme is working.
RELATIONSHIP TO EXISTING SYSTEMS.
104. Two systems of family allowances are already operating in Australia, one for the
Commonwealth Public Service and the other for the State of New South Wales. Each is
distinctive in scope and principle. In the case of the Commonwealth Public Service a
payment of ss. a week is made in respect of all the children of every officer up to an income limit
of £5OO per year, the money being found by a re-adjustment of the basic wage which deducts
ss. from the wage of each adult male officer. The New South Wales scheme applies only to two
children out of every seven, the payment of ss. per week being made only where the family income
does not exceed the basic wage plus ss. for each dependent child in the family, the computation
of income being made annually. The provision of the fund involves a percentage tax on the
wages paid by each employer. We are unable to recommend either of these systems for general
application, the objections thereto being set out in previous paragraphs. The question that
arises here is whether or not these schemes should be superseded or merged in the general scheme
recommended in this report.


105. The New South Wales difficulty can be met either by a repeal of the State law
directing the Industrial Commission to fix wages on the basis of a man and wife and a reversion
to the Hevdon declaration that wages should provide for a man, wife and two children, or,
alternatively, by leaving the State law as it stands, the State paying allowances as now, but
excluding children beyond two in each family, these to be paid for by the Commonwealth.
106. The Commonwealth Public Service scheme operates in pursuance of the
Commonwealth Public Service Regulations, the practice being to gazette as a regulation the
award of the Arbitrator. We see no reason why there should be a distinctive scheme for public
servants, but if these latter desire to continue the present arrangement the proposals put forward
herein constitute no impediment to their doing so. In regard to the Widows’ Pensions Act of
New South Wales there would be no need to continue it as a state law once the Commonwealth
enacted legislation providing for at least similar allowances.
CAN THE COST BE MET ?
107. Having indicated that the selection of a particular type of scheme will be largely
decided by the amount of money which the Government is prepared to find for family allowances,
the question emerges as to whether it is practicable to appropriate funds for this purpose. The
evidence tendered to the Commission on this point was exhaustive and varied. Witnesses
representing commercial and employing interests urged that any scheme would impose an
intolerable burden on the community, a contention that has been made in respect of almost every
reform that has been introduced in our history.
108. The amount required for the application of the widest scheme indicated in this
report would not exceed £6,000,000 per year, or less than £l per head of our present population.
109. It is significant that for other purposes Commonwealth and State Taxation was
increased for the period 1922-23 to 1926-27 by £2 Is. sd. per head. Much was made of the
interest burden on the people arising from the Public Debt which for the year ended June, 1927
was for the States and the Commonwealth £52,122,334. But £20,353,931 of this amount was
not a charge on taxation at all, having been earned by revenue producing assets. Moreover,
of the total interest burden more than half was payable within Australia representing merely
a transfer of funds from the taxpayer to the debt holder.
110. The Secretary to the Commonwealth Treasury, Mr. J. T. Heathershaw, testified
that the States paid over £19,000,000 of their £31,000,000 of interest obligation without recourse
to the proceeds of taxation, and it would appear that but for the interest payable on loans raised
by the Commonwealth for war purposes, the burden leviable against taxation in this connection
should not be deemed excessive. The point is generally overlooked that the Commonwealth
has now found more money for war services out of revenue than has been expended for the same
purpose from loan funds, the amounts respectively at 30th June, 1928, being £310,000,000 and
£306,000,000. About £30,000,000 a year is expended out of revenue for this purpose. This
represents more than half the annual amount raised in taxation during the past five years ;
in the financial year ended June last, the Commonwealth revenue from taxation was £56,600,000
while the expenditure out of revenue for war services amounted to £36,900,000. It will,
therefore, be seen that, when there is added the yearly expenditure on defence and the provision
made in recent years for special defence, the greater part of the Commonwealth taxation is
absorbed in meeting the burdens bequeathed by the Great War.
111. The cost of the war services is an honourable obligation which should be met to the
full, but it appears to us that there is no adequate reason why the nation should not now find
money for the positive purposes of the health and welfare of children. Statesmanship should
be capable of devising ways and means to cope with the situation if only it is inspired by the
will and the courage to do so.
112. The real test of the burden is the capacity to meet it. Payment of interest upon
that portion of the Public Debt which was raised within the Commonwealth or repayment
of part or all of the principal involves only the transfer of Australian produced revenue to
Australian holders of debt securities. The total of the internally produced revenue is not
diminished by these transactions —the money does not leave the country thereby reducing
taxable capacity. (See The Prosperity of Australia by F. C. Benham, page 65). More
than one-half of the Public Debt has now been floated within Australia, whereas in the year
1901 only one-sixth of the total had been so raised.


113. That portion of taxation required to pay interest on the internal public debt may
in practice actually increase savings and thus add to the capital resources of the country. The
Australian holders of the national debt who receive interest payments probably save a greater
proportion of these “ funds ” than would the ordinary tax-payers had they not been compelled
to pay taxes. Professor D. B. Copland informed us that for these reasons it is conceivable that
so far from drying up the sources of capital a part of the taxation to be imposed for a system
of family allowances may actually replenish them.
114. In present circumstances the provision to meet over-seas interest obligations appears
to us to be a more reliable indication of the national burden of taxation. Contrary to the general
belief the real burden of the external debt (per head) is appreciably less than at the beginning
of the century, while the capacity to pay is greater. External interest payments take only about
5 per cent, of home-produced income now as compared with about 8 per cent, at the beginning
of the century, and the real burden is considerably less. (See Benham’s Prosperity of Australia,
page 218). This burden, therefore, is not an insuperable impediment to the increased use of
public funds for social purposes in Australia. It could, however, easily become one, if the amount
of taxation required to pay interest on capital sums expended in unproductive works was
appreciably increased.
115. We consider that the right test to apply to any form of Federal expenditure is the
objects on which the funds are to be spent. All too frequently, this point is over-shadowed by
considerations of less importance. Australia has never hesitated to increase taxation to meet
necessary charges for the development of public utilities and works. We are unable to discern
any sound reason why there should not be the same readiness to expend money in promoting the
health and welfare of the children of the country. At present about 12 per cent, of the home-
produced income of Australia is paid in taxation ; in England the percentage is nearly 20, and in
other countries such as France it is said to be even higher. The evidence given by economists
before the Commission indicated that there was no reason why taxation should not be increased
to provide for a moderate scheme of allowances for families.
116. From the standpoint of Australian production it would appear that support is given
to this reasoning. A comparison of relative productive activity for the period 1871 to 1925-26
(see the latest issue of the Commonwealth Year Book, page 983) furnishes evidence that the value
of production per capita is increasing. In the latest year for which statistics are available, it
equalled nearly £72 per head. Surely one of these pounds may be used to provide for the proposals
set out in this report, more particularly when it is recognized that the proportion of workers
engaged in industry compared to the whole community is diminishing. The Statistician declares
(page 984) that if the figures comparing the relative productive activity of Australia were based
on persons engaged in the industries rather than on total population, they would be increased
in more recent years compared with the position in 1911.
117. In these circumstances, we submit that a refusal to do justice to the larger families
of the workers is unjustified. Mr. J. T. Sutcliffe (see The National Dividend, page 68) states
that in Australia, 58 -7 per cent, of the breadwinners received less than £2OO per year at 1920-21
prices. Yet fewer than 4| per cent, received nearly 22 per cent, of the national dividend. The
inequity of this distribution is self-evident. Mr Sutcliffe’s admirable brochure on the subject
concludes with this paragraph :—“ They (the various tables and statistics quoted) show that for
a very large proportion of the people the income received is barely sufficient to provide for
maintenance on a moderate standard of life. If it were possible to further analyse the tables and
give married and single separately, it would probably show that for a large number of married
men with families the income received is inadequate to provide the moderate standard of life
upon which the computations have been made.” The remedy is in our opinion a system of
allowances to be paid to families for each child beyond the second child in all cases where the
income does not exceed £3OO. That the nation is capable of finding the provision for these
payments we have no doubt.
118. In recommending even a moderate measure of family allowances, we recognize
that it may have to be introduced gradually. The allowances for widows without means who
have children dependent upon then stand in a class by themselves. Beyond this, the provision
of allowances for families whose income is below the basic wage, and for families on or near the
basic wage where the number of children exceeds the standard number, would be a valuable
measure of assistance. The provision for the children of widows would naturally be more costly
proportionately than for the other group, but it is estimated that an expenditure of approximately
3|- millions would cover the allowances to both these groups as outlined in the Minority Report.
Should part of the burden of payments to widows be taken over by a National Insurance scheme,
as seems possible, an expenditure of from 2f to 3 millions in allowances would probably cover
these classes.


A BUREAU OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC RESEARCH.
119. We wish strongly to recommend that the Federal Government establish some
organization for the study of social and economic conditions in Australia, so that accurate and
intelligently compiled information may be obtainable by Governments to guide them in
introducing measures for social reform. A large quantity of interesting data in the Statistician s
office is not worked up, and other data could be obtained. As members of the Commission, we
felt strongly the lack of expert investigation into many of the questions which came up in the
course of the inquiry, and in the absence of such impartial expert research a good deal of the
evidence tended to‘be mere opinion. Every social reform is an experiment, and intelligent
observation should accompany all experiments. This applies not only to “ social ” reforms,
but to developments of economic policy also. The industrial and social legislation of Australia
offers a rich field for research. The returns made under the Family Endowment Act of New
South Wales, to take a recent and closely relevant example, must be bringing into existence a
bodv of information making possible a survey of the problems facing families on low incomes in our
community. Amongst other things, such a survey would help to throw light on the incidence
of unemployment and its effects on family life. The time has arrived when a Bureau of Social
and Economic Research should be set up in Australia, and we would recommend that yhis be done.
Even one trained economist with an adequate clerical staff attached to the Statistician s office
or to the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research could render valuable service, though the
establishment of an independent Bureau would be better. Such a Bureau would co-ordmate
and evaluate not only information obtained through the Census and other official returns, but
also the data obtainable through social workers whether Government officials or otherwise.
Wider economic questions, too, such as the relation of economic policy to national prosperity,
to amount and distribution of income, to cost of living, to unemployment and so on would be
material for research by such a Bureau. The advice of a body such as this would be invaluable
in helping the Government to decide in what way to amend or enlarge any preliminary scheme of
family allowances after it had been in operation some time.
INCIDENCE OF INCOME TAX.
120. We would suggest that in order to increase the amount to be raised by income tax
for the payment of family allowances, the limit of exemption from tax should be lowered to £2OO
a vear for persons without dependants, if an exemption of £IOO were allowed for a wi*e and
£SO for each child under fourteen or o + her bona fide dependant, income tax would be paid as now
bv childless married men if earning over £3OO a year, by married men with one child if earning
over £350 a year and so on. Generous exemptions for dependants make clearer the principle
of “ capacity to pa} 1 ” —and £2OO a year is a sufficiently high level of exemption for unmarried
men without dependants.
121. In addition, the rate of tax should be graded more steeply for the higher incomes
in order to raise the sum required for these allowances.
' SERVICES FOR FAMILIES.
122. The members of the Commission were all impressed by the work of the various welfare
agencies which are gradually, through Government or private channels, though chiefly through
the former, canno for children in essential ways. It is strongly urged upon all State Governments
that services which ensure expert medical and dental attention to children, and to their parents
also, and especially which afford all aid possible to the mother before, during and after the birth
of her child, should be so extended that no mother and no child should suffer deteriorated health
for lack of those services.
123. During the past five years Australia lost by death over 35,000 infants under twelve
months of life. The dearh rate per 1,000 births was 55 -54. Although there has been a decline
in the death-rate this improvement applies only to the cases where the children have survived
the first month of life. Even in New Zealand, despite the excellent general rate in that country,
the mortality rate under one month of life is remaining stationary. In Australia the data available
indicate that the death-rate under one month is higher in the industrial areas than in those described
as residential areas. It is also significant that the percentage of deliveries which have had medical
supervision is lower in the former than in the latter districts. If our death-rate be taken at 56,
dissection shows that the deaths under one week were 22 -6, from two to four weeks 8 -7 (or a
total of 31 -3 for the first month) and 24 -8 for the remaining eleven months.
124. The maternal death rate has remained extraordinarily high, averaging about one
death in every 175 confinements. Although slight improvement has been noted in the past
twenty-five years the rate has recently begun to rise. This is the case in nearly ah the states.
Two-fifths of the mortality is due to puerperal infection or puerperal sepsis. There is an


undoubted close association between maternal mortality and the still-birth and early infantile
death-rates. Diseases caused by maternal ill health during pregnancy are an important factor
in both cases. That the potential fertility of married women is not now yielding its former
relatively high proportion of births, while partly due to social and economic causes, is also
explained by the continuing gravity of the hazards of child-birth. The evidence indicated that
mothers over 35 years and those under 20 years have the greatest hazard, the former due to
lessened physical vitality, and the latter to immaturity and an increased proportion of operative
deliveries. The highest maternal death-rate among married women occurs in the case of those
who have already borne children. Ante-natal supervision by doctors in respect to this category
of mothers is said to be difficult owing to indifference because previous confinements were normal,
or because family and domestic ties prevent regular medical consultation.
125. The number of women who suffer chronic ill health after child-birth is far too great,
it being testified by Dr. Marshall Allan (Ex-Director of Obstetrical Research in Victoria) that
no fewer than 50 per cent, of mothers suffer some weakening of bodily function subsequent to
delivery. The records of the Melbourne Women’s Hospital show that 36 per cent, of all the
admissions to the gynaecological department have been due to the effects of a previous confinement.
When to this is added the realization that diseases responsible for infantile mortality cripple
more persons than they kill, it becomes apparent that the present national burden of sickness and
invalidity is in great measure due to lack of proper care in infancy and the neglect of proper
treatment for child-bearing women.
126. A fact to consider in this connection is that the numerical burden of child life on the
community is progressively decreasing. The proportion of children up to the age of 15 in 1871
was 42 per cent, of the total population ; at the 1921 census it was 32 per cent.
127. Despite the awakening of the public conscience regarding the vital importance of
the problem of child welfare, much yet remains to be done. Pre-natal and post-natal clinics
and medical and dental inspection of kindergarten children and children attending primary
schools are merely indicative of the field that awaits energetic and comprehensive
expansion. At present there is no inspection of about 200,000 children attending primary,
denominational and other private schools ; nor is there any medical or dental inspection for
the children of pre-school age ; thousands of young children do not attend kindergarten schools ;
the number of infant health centres, although increasing, is entirely insufficient; more
mothercraft training centres are necessary. All the activities associated with infants and young
children should be brought together and co-ordinated in each locality. To the busy mother
with a family who is restricted by the routine of her daily domestic duties this would mean less time
away from home, whether it was her own health or that of one of the children which required
attention.
128. Obstetric hospital accommodation is not satisfactory, the private hospitals being
chiefly at fault. Out of 435 hospitals registered and examined in Victoria to admit these cases,
only 16 per cent, were found to be good, 56 per cent, fair, and 28 per cent, poor to bad (by
Dr. Marshall Allan who investigated them in 1925-28.)
129. While the methods used in the various States in respect to the routine medical and
dental inspection at schools are deserving of the highest commendation, the evidence disclosed
the imperative need for an enlargement of treatment services in order to ensure that ascertained
defects will be properly dealt with. Statistics, although incomplete, suggest that more than
50 per cent, of the children examined suffer physical defects. Out of 146,453 recorded as
defective in New South Wales in the triennium ended March 1925, the number treated subsequently
was only 80,876. In the latest year for which complete figures are available in that State 102,000
were examined, nearly 43,000 were notified for treatment, and only 21,000 were treated. In
all the States there are large numbers who for various reasons do not undergo necessary
surgical, medical or dental treatment, and even though in each capital city, and in certain larger
towns, free treatment is available for children of indigent parents, the pressure on the hospital
or the cost of transportation, together with the exigencies of a household in which there are
other children, accounts for many children not being dealt with. What is overlooked is that
“ free ” treatment at a central hospital does not mean no expense to the family.
130. That the failure to treat children for physical defects is productive of national loss
is attested by the results of the Citizen Forces medical examination of the 1908 quota for the
half year ended June 1926. The number of youths examined was 18,463, of whom 12,531 were
passed as fit and 5,932 were unfit, the percentage being 67 -9 and 32 -1 respectively. All things
considered, the latter rate is grievously suggestive ; the probability is that were the girls of a
similar age also subjected to a medical examination the figures would be repeated. Therefore,
one-third of the population may be said to enter adulthood physically unfitted for the normal
demands of the struggle for existence.


131. Associated with any national programme of child welfare and maternity services
is the need for assisting the potential mothers of the future to gain a sound knowledge of
household economy and mothercraft. Before a woman is considered qualified to teach arithmetic
or secure employment as a stenographer she requires to undergo a course of special training,
but thousands of women become wives and mothers without having had any preparation at
all for a career beset with tremendous problems and demanding at all times a maximum of
competency and devotion. The State which has control of all potential mothers, at least until
they are 14 years of age, should see that all are instructed in the obvious principles of home-craft
and mother-craft which can be learned by its charges. Such general training would help to
make the factor of inefficiency in the home referred to by some witnesses more evident and more
censurable where it did exist.
132. All the expert testimony agreed that the health of children is a purchasable
commodity, the principal question being whether the community is willing to pay the price
involved in assisting the child and its mother in overcoming various physical handicaps that,
in the main, are preventable and remediable.
MATERNITY ALLOWANCE.
133. Some witnesses suggested that the money now spent annually on Maternity
Allowances, viz., £5 at each birth (some £700,000 per annum) would be more profitably employed
in the provision of maternity hospitals and infant health centres and that the allowance should
be discontinued and the money used for these purposes. We consider that this course would
not be justified.
134. In the first place this matter was carefully considered by the Federal Royal
Commission on Health (1925), and these experts did not recommend the abolition of the Maternity
Allowance. Further, the percentage of women attended in confinement by medical practitioners
has increased from 68 in 1911 (the year before the allowance was instituted) to 90 in 1926. It
appears certain that the allowance has been the principal factor in this satisfactory improvement.
135. Many individuals are not within reach of Maternity Hospitals and ante-natal clinics,
so that payment to these individuals is the only way of ensuring to them the means of expert
assistance. Of the 90 per cent, or more of mothers who now get medical attention in confinements,
a good number already spend the whole or part of the allowance at public maternity hospitals
or private maternity hospitals of good standard, or for the best private medical and nursing
assistance. Inferior hospitals and inferior nursing may be expected to disappear gradually; the
great need is for the establishment of enough ante-natal clinics and well-equipped maternity
hospitals and the increase of properly qualified medical men and midwives, so that mothers
having now the wherewithal to expend on these services shall also have the right services
obtainable in return for their expenditure.
HOUSING.
136. There can be no question but that bad housing accommodation, particularly in
the larger cities, has been responsible for much ill health and hardship to children and mothers.
Witnesses of undoubted standing were emphatic that the housing conditions for the poorer
families are far from satisfactory. Dr. Purdy (Officer of Health for the City of Sydney) said
there could be no disguising the fact that in Sydney domestic discomfort and insanitary
conditions existed which made for inevitable disease and degeneration of race. There were,
he said, 179 families consisting of from two to nine persons in that city living in one-roomed
dwellings ; in addition there were living in one-roomed tenements and flats 514 families of from
two to ten persons. In effect, these two groups of one-room families totalled 1,596 persons who
were living in 693 one-roomed homes—if the word home may be used.
137. The shortage of houses is attested by the present practice of sub-letting rooms and
the multiplication of small flats. In many of these places there is insufficient air and yard space
and as a consequence the children are cramped and deprived of fresh air, sunlight, and opportunity
for play. That their health suffers is undoubted. It appears that economic conditions are
at the root of the concentration of families in these habitations ; many wage-earners, particularly
those on the lowest incomes and dependent on casual or intermittent work, congregate in
proximity to shipping, large factories and big industrial works. Their circumstances explain
the demand for house accommodation in these localities and provide opportunity for much
exploitation. Instances were cited of houses being rented at £2 ss. per week and sub-let room


by room for £8 10s. ; in one such room, a man, wife and four children lived, while a daughter
fifteen years of age slept on the balcony; they paid 255. per week for , the room. The number of
families living in this way was very many and in most cases they had to use a gas ring for
cooking, there being no other convenience. Poor conditions, though not to the same degree,
operate in other capitals, Perth and Brisbane being little affected. It should be noted that
the Industrial Commissioner for isew South Wales when fixing a standard of living in December
1926, allowed 28s. per week as rent in Sydney for a “ five-roomed house in sound tenantable
condition, not actually cramped as to allotment, situated in decent surroundings and provided
with bath, copper, and fixed tubs.” Witnesses testified that in Sydney and suburbs from 255.
to 355., or even more, was a rent commonly paid by working men. The amount allowed by
the Commissioner would not appear to be too high, but it is a heavy charge for the man on the
basic wage.
138. Reference to the report by the Inter-State Commission in 1919 on Rents and the
report by the Basic Wage Commission of 1920 suggests that there is urgent need for an effective
housing scheme. The various systems by which people may have advances made with a view
to acquiring their own homes do not appear to touch the root of the matter ; what is required
is provision by means of which houses of a moderate type may be rented in reasonably close
proximity to wharves and other centres where casual labour tends to concentrate ; so long as
the basic wage is about £4 55., the rent has to be kept within bounds or the provision for food
will be inadequate. At present families pay as much for a barely furnished room as should
be paid for a dwelling. The conditions are not precisely similar in each city and it would appear
that the remedy is to be found in local municipal initiative supported in the interests of national
health by Commonwealth subsidies.
FINDINGS.
We find :
1. That for workers in industry some system of family allowances is the logical corollary
of the living wage doctrine.
2. That on the whole the basic wage as determined by the Commonwealth and State
Tribunals has provided a frugal standard of comfort for a family of man, wife and two children.
3. That for families of wage-earners where the children number more than two, the
standard has been generally lower than is reasonable, having regard to the definitions implied
in the awards of the courts, the disparity increasing with the size of the family.
4. That in equity any system of allowances to improve the standard of living for the
larger families of wage-earners should be extended to similar families of those who are not
wage-earners.
5. That in the case of widows with dependent children and other families without a male
wage-earner there is urgent need both in the interests of these families and of the community
for the payment of allowances.
6. That it is undesirable to make allowances for the families of wage-earners part of the
system of wage fixing, and that although it may be desirable for all wages to be fixed for the
same family unit, it is not essential that any scheme of family allowances should be delayed
because the Commonwealth Government has not at present sole control of industrial matters.
7. That the country can at present afford to inaugurate a moderate system of family
allowances.
8. That such an expenditure of part of the national income would be a good investment
for the community.
9. That according to the evidence of the Federal Solicitor-General (Sir Robert R. Garran)
the Commonwealth Parliament possesses the constitutional power to enact legislation providing
for a system of allowances to families.
10. That the present services in respect of maternity and child welfare are inadequate
and need considerable extension to ensure that all mothers and children who need them have
these facilities available.
11. That in the larger cities the supply of rented houses is inadequate for families on
a low income.


recommendations.
We recommend :
1. That the Commonwealth Government pay to widows with dependent children and
also to other families of dependent children where there is no male bread winner allowances
equal to those paid under the New South Wales Widows’ Pensions Act of 1925, i.e., £l per week
for the mother and 10s. per week for each dependent child, with a similar limitation of income
to that adopted in the New South Wales Act.
2. That the Commonwealth Government pay to the mother in each family where there
are more than two children an allowance of £lO per annum for each dependent child excluding
the first two in each family, provided the total income of the family shall not thereby be
increased beyond the sum of £3OO per annum.
3. That this allowance be paid also for the first and second dependent child in families
where the income falls below the basic wage to an extent which makes it necessary or t e
allowance to bring the income up to the basic wage. In the case of non-wage-earners or of those
not working under specified awards it is recommended that the wage level used as a basic wage
for the purposes of the computation of income be the Commonwealth Basic Wage adjusted to
the 30 towns weighted average, or the State basic wage, whichever is the lower.
4. That for the purposes of these allowances the definition of the age of dependency
(taken usually as under the school leaving age, at present 14 years of age in all States) be
extended so as to include all children attending school or other instructional courses until the
age of at least 16 years.
5. That in the computation of wages Industrial Tribunals adopt the family unit of man,
wife and two children.
6. That until all tribunals so adopt a similar unit, it be assumed by the Commonwealth
Parliament in legislating to establish family allowances that the wages paid at present for
unskilled workers do provide for a family unit of man, wife, and two children.
7 That, to obtain funds for family allowances, the Federal income tax be reviewed in
order (a) to lower the limit of taxable income for persons without dependants to £2OO, and
(b) to grade more steeply the rate of tax for incomes at the highest levels.
8. That the Federal Government establish a Bureau of Social and Economic Research,
either as an independent organisation or attached to some existing Department.
9. That the State Governments extend as quickly as is practicable the provision now
being developed for :
(а) Pre-natal clinics and Infant Health Centres,
(б) Maternity hospitals,
(c) Schools for mothercraft, ...
(d) Dental and medical services for school children (including treatment for those
who require it) so that these services shall be within the reach of all.
10. That children of pre-school age (from two to five) be examined once every twelve
months by school medical and dental officers.
11. That the Commonwealth Government subsidize the services above mentioned as
recommended by the Federal Health Council which is representative of the States and the
Commonwealth and has already laid the foundations of a joint policy in these matters.
12 That the Federal Health Council arrange for a survey of the housing of the people
to discover the extent to which the health of children suffers by reason of unsuitable living
premises and make recommendations for reform.
13. That the Department of Education in each State extend as rapidly as possible the
teaching of domestic economy for all girls attending primary schools.
