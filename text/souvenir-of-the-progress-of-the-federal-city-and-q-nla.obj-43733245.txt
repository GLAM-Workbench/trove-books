SOUVERNIR
OF THE PROGRESS
OF THE FEDERAL CITY
AND QUEANBEYAN
DISTRICT


INTRODUCTORY NOTE.
I
O numerous have been the inquiries from all parts of Australia, United Kingdom, and other
? Nations respecting the nature of the Federal Capital area, and information regarding the
building and growth of the Federal City, that the Author feels justified in placing before
the Public this Souvenir Book of Photographs taken in and around the Federal City —" Canberra.
They will convey some idea of the nature of the country surrounding the site chosen for the
Federal City, and the growth in so short a time of the city itself, which can only be fully appre^
ciated by a visit to the locality itself. Those who have done so speak highly of the beauty of the
surrounding country. It is undoubtedly an ideal spot for the Federal Capital.
