INTRODUCTION.
The Cricketers of Australia having favorably received the
first volume of our Guide , we have been again induced to
venture upon our task. We do so with a feeling of gratitude
to those who have given us their support, though the specu-
lation has not been successful in a pecuniary point of view.
The urgent solicitations and renewed promises of many
cricketers in the several colonies, have inclined us to continue
the publication annually, in the hope that the lovers of the
game will generously countenance a work intended to be a
faithful epitome of the progress of the game in Australasia.
In various parts of the work we have taken the opportunity
of making suggestions to our friends by which they may
materially assist the Editor in improving the work. The
importance of keeping correct records cannot be too strongly
urged, as upon this the interest of the game mainly depends.
The press of Victoria, especially Bell’s Life, has given much
attention and devoted considerable space to the game, readily
inserting communications and reports of matches. Con-
siderable correspondence has been thus carried on by various
members of clubs, which it is not our purpose to dwell upon,
as many of the subjects are only of passing interest, and thus
come more legitimately within the sphere of a journalist. Our
pages are intended for a general register of cricket.

NOTICES TO CRICKETERS.
A conference of members of chibs has been held in Melbourne, at which
the new law (No. 10) of the Marylebone Club, was agreed to. The several
colonies have mostly consented to adopt the same.
The following rule has been passed by the Coast Club, and we recom-
mend its consideration to the attention of cricketers: —“That pending any
general rule which may be adopted by the cricketers of Victoria, this club,
in playing matches with other clubs, play only with the resident members
of such clubs, or persons who belong only to the club plaj r ed with, except
by agreement, in which case other cricketers played with shall be declared
to be given in to strengthen the playing 11.”
The Editor would respectfully intimate that he will he glad to receive
any suggestions, either from the officers or private members of Cricket
Clubs, to assist him in improving this work.


GRAND CRICKET MATCH.
NEW SOUTH WALES v. VICTORIA.
The third grand contest between the picked cricketers of
the above colonies took place at Melbourne, on 12th, 13th and
14th January, 1868. The original challenge emanated from
Victoria, and was accepted by New South Wales, who sent an
eleven from Sydney to Melbourne, the game resulting in favor
of New South Wales. In February, 1857, the second match
was played at Sydney, when they again achieved a victory,
with 65 runs to spare. The movement set on foot in the
metropolis of both colonies to inaugurate an annual match
was carried out, and it is understood that they will be con-
tinued.
The result of this match (won by Victoria with 171 runs to
spare), though unexpected by those who had previously
carried the palm, gave universal satisfaction. The best feeling
was engendered, and the reception met with by the New South
Wales players was highly gratifying. Before the game a
Breakfast to all engaged, with their friends, was given by, and
at the residence of D. S. Campbell, Esq., M.L.A., President of
Melbourne Cricket Club. Theatrical entertainments were
performed under the .patronage of the cricketers, a Dinner
was given to the New South Wales eleven, presided over by
the Hon. W. C. Haines, M.L.A., and the two elevens were
invited to dine with H is Excellency Sir H enry Barkly, who
had taken great interest in this important contest.
THE MATCH.
VICTORIA.— First Innings.
M‘Kone bowled the first over. Bryant commenced with a
forward drive for 3, and cut the second to the off for 4. O,
Lewis bowled at the other end with a maiden over to begin
with. Wray made a capital leg hit for 4 off M'Kone, and
afterwards a drive for 4, M‘Kone’s bowling being rather over-
pitched, Bryant drove the ball forward for 4 in Lewis’s second
over. M‘Kone being taken off, Gilbert supplied his place, and
tried his “insinuating slows.” Wray soon managed to
get his leg before the wicket, and was given out. (One
a 2


wicket down for 20 runs.) Elliott followed Wray, and took the
liberty of “spooning” the had into the hands of Mills, who
was pleased to accept it. Marshall drove the ball in the air,
and it fell into Gilbert’s hands. The two last out without
adding to the score. (Three wickets down with three successive
balls.) The deceptive style of Gilbert’s bowling, taking a long
run and then stopping short, evidently puzzled the batsmen.
Hammersley now presented an appearance, and narrowly
escaped the loss of his wicket the first ball, by being caught by
the bowler. Bryant was still steadily returning the balls back
to Gilbert in the most exemplary manner. Hammersley made
a line drive off Gilbert forward for 3 in the following over, and
in the succeeding one from Lewis was given out, leg before
wicket. (Four wickets down for 28 runs.) Pickering now
joined Bryant, and the first ball from Gilbert was sent nearly
out of the cricket ground for 3 by Pickering, followed by a hit
for I. Unfortunately the next was slipped by Bryant to 0. Lewis,
when Pickering ran and not being able to cross, was run out.
(Five wickets down for 82 runs.) Wills, the captain of the
Victoria eleven, succeeded to the post, and sent the first ball to
long field on from Gilbert, and in the next over from Lewis a
draw for 1. In the following over from Gilbert, Wills showed a
good specimen of play by a square leg hit for 1 only, being
beautifully fielded by Thompson, and Bryant with a cut for 2
and a drive for 1. 0. Lewis now bowled a maiden over. Wills
stepped out to meet Gilbert, and succeeded in lifting the ball
over the bowler’s head towards the Governor’s pavilion for 5,
amid great cheering, but was deceived by a twister from Lewis
in the next over, causing him to retire with 12 runs. (Six
wickets for 47 runs.) Rees followed Wills, Bryant still playing
in his usually excellent style. The latter however, drove the
ball into the hand of Mills in the next over from Gilbert.
(Seven 'wickets for 47 runs.) Morres became a companion of
Rees, and made a leg hit for 2, when the bell announced
dinner, after which Rees and Morres resumed their position at
the wickefs, Gilbert commencing the bowling. Rees was
obliged to succumb to Thompson, who made a capital catch at
square leg. (Eight wickets for 53 runs.) Hamilton joined
Morres, the latter making a capital square leg hit for 2, fielded
nicely by Thompson, and a drive for 2 off Gilbert. Hamilton
made. 1, W'hen Morres was run out, the ball being returned by
Thompson to Hilliard in splendid style. (Nine wickets for 69
runs.) Butterworth made the eleventh, but was unable to
trouble the scorers, having been disturbed by one of Lewis's
deceivers. Total of the innings, 59.
SYDNEY. — First Innings.
Elliott and Wills took up the bowling. Hilliard and Beeston
were the first representatives of New South Wales. The


former, in the over from Elliott, made a very pretty leg hit
for 1, being well returned by Hamilton, Beeston slipped a
ball towards Wills, but was not able to take the liberty of
running while Marshall was so close. Hilliard afterwards was
run out, the wicket-keeper again showing great dexterity.
(One wicket down for 1 run). Howell followed, and retired
for nil, having given Elliott the chance of a catch. (Two
wickets for 4 runs.) Gilbert, the Captain of the Sydney
eleven, was at this time welcomed to the wickets. A number
of maiden overs were afterwards bowled. Beeston made a
nice cut for 3, and the next ball was one of Wills's “ rippers,”
which disturbed the wickets. (Three wickets for 7 runs.)
M‘Kone was the next man, who tried to get a ball into the
slip to commence a score with, but he found the next from
Elliott encroach upon the wickets; E. Murray, a left-
handed player, succeeded M‘Kone, and slipped the first ball
from Wills for 3. Gilbert, who was well in, cut to point for 2,
and was nearly run out in trying for a second run. Murray hit
Elliott to the leg for 5, the Sydneyites “ looking up,” hut in
the next over he unfortunately sprained his wr’st (an old
hurt), which compelled him to retire for a time. Thompson
took his place, and he, with Gilbert, made some pretty hits,
but the fielding was too good to allow of many runs. Elliott
retired from the bowling in favor of Morres, who was sent to
the off the first ball, only one being obtained, as- Pickering
had managed to meet it. Wills here commenced his slows,
but they were not continued long. Gilbert made a good leg
hit for 1, and Thompson a slip for 2. After obtaining a few
more, Morres reached Thompson’s stumps. (Five wickets
down for 34 runs.) Oswald Lewis now appeared, and made a
cut from Morres for 3, and in the next over from Wills was
out, leg before wicket.' (Six wickets for 37 runs.) T. Lewis
followed his brother, but was bowled the first ball by Wills.
Vaughan came next, and Gilbert, after making a fine leg hit for
3, was obliged to retire in consequence of Wills having got
amongst the timbers with one of his “trimmers.” (Eight
wickets for 51 runs.) Mills was the last but one, Vaughan
defending his wicket at this time in gallant style. Mills
drew a ball for 1, when he was caught and bowled by Bryant,
who had taken up the bowling at Morres’s end. Murray
again presented himself, and the excitement was intense—the
last wicket, and eight runs to vie with their opponents.
Vaughan made another neat cut to point for 2, after which
Murray had a narrow escape from being run out, the ball
having been returned to Marshall by Pickering, but the former
missed it. In the next over Murray was bowled by Bryant,
leaving the total score 67,—being only 2 short of the
Victorians.


VICTORIA. —Second Innings.
Bryant and Wray, as in the previous innings, presented
themselves first. Gilbert began the bowling, Bryant cutting
the first for 2, and the last in the over a fine leg hit for 4.
0. Lewis took the bowling at opposite end, Wray taking the
advantage made a out for 3, past the point. Wray managed
to steal one from Gilbert’s slows in the following over, and in
the succeeding one, from Lewis, Wray nearly gave M’Kone a
catch. Wray now effected a splendid leg-hit for 5 off Lewis.
Several singles were obtained by Bryant and Wray, when the
former made a capital leg-hit off Lewis, the batsmen having
run 6 ; but, according to a prior arrangement, 4 only were to
count for balls sent into any of the pavilions. Bryant scored
a 1 and 2 to the off, when he cut a ball to point, which was
thrown by Mills to Gilbert, who was mid-wicket; he having
missed it, an overthrow was run, and a wicket saved. M‘Kone
took up the bowling at Lewis’s end, the second ball being hit
by Wray to square leg for 4. Wray made a drive off M'Kone
for 3, well fielded by Mills, and in the succeeding over, from
Gilbert, was scarcely saved from being run out through the
fine fielding of Gilbert. Bryant made a few more singles,
when Wray, who was over anxious, ran him out. (One wicket for
39 runs.) Hamilton followed Bryant, and defended his wicket
well for a little time, but unfortunately drove the ball back to
Gilbert after getting 2. (Two wickets for 45 runs.) Pickering
was the next batsman, and after joining Wray the latter made
another square leg, after which Pickering cleanly picked up
some of Gilbert’s slows, nearly all forward drives. Wray noW
tried to play the ball forward, but was hit on the leg, and
having touched the bat, it was caught by Mills at point.
(Three wickets for 54 runs). Hammersley succeeded Wray,
and immediately commenced his usual style of hitting down
at the slows, his good defence being much admired. Picker-
ing made another drive for one, when the bell announced that
the luncheon was ready; the game then showing 62 runs,
with only three wickets down. 0. Lewis commenced the first
over after the repast, when Pickering made a fine drive for 5,
Hammersley having a narrow escape of being run out, but
was saved by the ball being thrown too high for the wicket-
keeper. Murray took the bowling from Gilbert. Pickering
drew a ball beautifully to leg, off' Lewis, for 5, and in the fol-
lowing over, from Murray, Hammersley made a fine drive for 4.
Beeston was put on to bowl instead of Lewis, the third ball
being driven by Pickering for 3. Hammersley made another
drive, to the off, for 5, from Murray, and in the following over,
from Beeston, Pickering was nicely caught by Mills, having
scored 26 runs. (Four wickets for 98 runs.) Marshall was
next man, and began to play very carefully. He made several
pretty hits and in the last ball of Gilbert’s first over Marshall


drove tlie ball with great force back 'to him, but lie could not
hold it. Hammersley was still playing first-rate, but, in an
endeavour to make a hard drive, lifted the ball in the air, and
was caught by M’Kone for 21 runs. (Five wickets for 113
runs.) Wills next put in an appearance ; he and Marshall for
some time playing carefully together, completely killing the
bowling. At this juncture Gilbert placed Thompson to bowl
instead of Beeston —which displayed good generalship. Mar-
shall now struck one of Gilbert’s slows into the air, and was
admirably caught by Mills at long field. (Six wickets for 13-5
runs.) Morres and Wills now became companions, and for
upwards of an hour the field was kept continually at work,
the bowling occasionally being changed. The batters
both displayed great judgment and skill. Morres made
a fine drive out of the ground for 6, and after a capital
innings for 47, was caught out by 0. Lewis at short slip.
(Seven wickets for 209 runs.) Bees succeeded Morres, but
was soon sent back to the pavilion for 3, Elliott followed,
and made some pretty hits, when he was stumped by Hilliard
for 10. Butterworth now took the bat, and in trying to get
back to sweep at a ball from Gilbert hit his wicket. (Ten
wickets for 238 runs.) Wills carried out his bat for 49;
making a total of 297, and leaving the New South Wales
players 241 to get to win.
SYDNEY.—- Second Innings.
Thompson and Beeston were sent in to commence the game.
The first hit was by Beeston, nicely fielded by Marshall, for 1,
off Elliott’s bowling. Wills bowled the second over, a maiden.
Six overs were bowled for 5 runs, the second ball in the
eleventh over from the beginning taking Beeston’s leg stump,
bowled by Elliott. (One wicket for 6 runs.) Hilliard followed
Beeston. Thompson made a cut for Ito cover point, fielded
by Bees, but thrown over Marshall’s head, and 3 more were
obtained. Hilliard slipped for 1, beautifully fielded by Morres.
Hilliard then tried to hit Elliott to leg, but the ball bounced
and struck his hand, and was caught behind the wicket by
Hammersley. (Two wickets for 12 runs.) Gilbert next ap-
peared in the field, and was greeted with loud plaudits. The
second ball received by him was hit to Pickering, who threw
it in well, and Elliott soon had the wicket down. The umpire,
thinking Thompson was not out, gave him the benefit of the
doubt. Thompson made a neat draw for 2, and a second
time managed another, but was very well fielded by Wray.
Gilbert made a good drive to the off for 3, touched by Picker-
ing, and afterwards a cut to cover point for 1. Another drive
by Gilbert, past Bryant, who was standing point, but unable
to reach the ball, followed by another drive for 2, and leg hit
for two. Bryant was at this time placed on to bowl instead of
Elliott, Gilbert beginning with a cut for one, and Thompson a


draw for one. Gilbert was playing in gooi earnest; fne
bowlers, Wills and Bryant, evidently keeping the balls “we
on the spot,” when a fast trimmer from Wills disabled Gilbert
for a time. Play was soon after resumed, Howell taking
Gilbert’s place, with Thompson. Howell began with a drive
for 2, and leg hit for 1 from Wills, the third ball in the over
was too near Thompson’s timbers, he having again tried to
draw; his score was 10. (Three wickets for 33 runs.) Vaughan
succeeded Thompson, and in attempting to run for a ball hit
by Howell was run out without scoring. (Pour wickets for 33
runs.) Murray took the bat from Vaughan, and made some
pretty cuts and slips, Howell still playing in good style, and
with great care. The latter made a hard hit for 4 to the
boundary, and a out past cover point for 4, Morres was put on
to bowl instead of Bryant, notwithstanding which Murray and
Howell maintained a good stand, but in the second over from
Morres he bowled Murray’s wicket down, the umpire crying
out “no ball.” Murray cut for 3 the next chance he had.
Wills tried his slows for a little time, but soon returned to his
old style, and brought Murray’s wicket down for 12 runs.
(Five wickets for 59 runs.) M'Kone succeeded Murray, and in
the first over from Elliott was sent back, through one of his
trimmers. (Six wickets for 60 runs.) 0. Lewis followed
M‘Kone, and commenced with a drive for 2, and after two
more hits had scored 6, when Elliott got in contact with the
sticks. Gilbert, who had partially recovered, again appeared,
receiving the hearty greeting of the spectators, bringing
Vaughan to field for him. Gilbert made a pretty leg hit,
when he ran as well as Vaughan, and Marshall put Gilbert's
wicket down before Vaughan returned, consequently Gilbert was
out. Mills was next to Gilbert, who had no chance of scoring,
as T. Lewis, who' had succeeded his brother, gave Bryant a
chance at point, finishing the game for 69 runs, which, with
57, made a total of 126, being 171 runs short of their oppo-
nents.
REMARKS ON THE MATCH.
The principal features in the Victorian eleven in the field
were —the long-stopping of Butterworth, wicket-keeping of
Marshall, and bowling of Wills, Elliott, Bryant and Morres, —
all the latter being first-iate. The fielding generally was
good, and a very great improvement on any previous match :
but where all did their best, and did well, further remarks will
be unnecessary. In batting, their second innings displayed
great skill. On the Sydney side, which we believe was as
strong as at either of the previous matches, there was great
credit due to the admirable management of the field by Mr.
Gilbert, who kept the players in their respective positions with
skill, changing as required. The general impression at the
earlier part of the game was much in favor of the Sydney

players, and the peculiar but safe system of fielding called
forth repeated manifestations of approval from the on-lookers.
Everything seemed to delight players and audience ; beautiful
weather, crowds of people, and good temper on each side
amongst the players. In the first innings of the Victorian
side, only three bowlers were placed, Gilbert, 0. Lewis, and
M'Kone ; but in the second seven were tried. The underhand
was not effective. It was admitted on all hands that the
match had given universal satisfaction ; and the good feeling
created by the players and their friends will enhance the im-
portance of the game more by this match than anything else
which has occurred. The following is the
The Victorians thus winning by 171 runs.

TASMANIA AGAINST VICTORIA.
An eleven of Victoria, members of the Melbourne Cricket
Club, played with all Tasmania, on Thursday and Friday,
25th and 26th February, 1858. The match was a complete
triumph for Victoria. For Victoria, 116 runs were obtained?
in one innings, G. Elliott contributing 28, T. Butterworth 24,
G. Marshall 20, T W. Wills 16. For Tasmania, 38 first and
62 second innings, of which G. F. Evans scored 3 and 20, E.
Still 3 and 12, Tabart (not out) 8 and 8, Elliott’s bowling
was first-rate, 2 runs only were obtained from 76 balls, with
which he took 9 wickets. We regret our inability to publish
the score, for want of space. The success of this match,
together with the succeeding one at Launceston with the
Melbourne players, inspired a feeling of emulation in the
islanders, and it may be hoped, in future matches, their
victory will be as great as their opponents has been in these
contests. (Particulars of Clubs, &c., in Tasmania, elsewhere.)
CRICKET IN ENGLAND.
Cricketers’ Fund Friendly Society. —This institution has
been established in London for the purpose of “ affording relief to
cricketers, who from old age, illness, or accident, are incapable of
following their profession; also the temporary assistance of widows
and children of cricketers (members of the Society) who hare been
left destitute.” Subscriptions will be received and forwarded by
the Editor of this work.
Averages. —During last season the highest average of runs in
England was again obtained by George Farr, well known as the
“ English Pet.” For several years (with the exception of 1856,
when John Lillywhite was in the ascendant) this brilliant batsman
and excellent cricketer has occupied the proud position of carrying
the palm for batting. Next to Parr, Messrs. J. Makinson, A. Hay-
garth, E. C. Tinley, John Lillywhite, H. H. Gillett, and Catfyn are
pre-eminent In bowling, J. Jackson has been the most successful;
he averages a very little over one an over, and much more than
half of his overs bowled were maidens; every five overs he got a
wicket, averaging six an innings, bowling in 5B, Griffith, Willsher,
Wisden, Caffyn, Grundy, and Martingell, stand next in order.
Scores. —We perceive that Mr. F Lillywhite intends publishing
a work in 1860, entitled a “National Work of Cricket Scores,”
containing the history of cricket, with particulars of players, &c.,
from 1712, price two guineas.

Though nearly all of ihe above Clubs had the Circulars of Information
sent to them at the termination of the past season, the only Clubs who
have returned the Averages, &c., are marked above. Those to which t ar ®
attached have supplied us with the Averages of Batsmen and Analyses ol
Bowling; those with * have sent the Averages of Batsmen only. Ihe
excuse from those who have not returned the necessary information has m
most cases been that “ the records of the play during the season have not
been properly kept.” We hope, for the future, that all Secretaries ot Clubs
will see the propriety of having the Scores of each Match preserved, and
made up at the end of the season, in order that this annual Guide may be
issued within a few weeks after the termination of the cricketing campaign,
for which purpose new forms will he sent to the various Clubs in the month
of May. Particulars of matches played by each club above-mentioned will
Ed. C. G.
be found under the head of Review of the Season.-


Who have played in three or more Matches, and whose average is 1-0 or more.

REVIEW OF THE SEASON.
The rapid development of the game of Cricket in Australia,
and especially in Victoria, during the past year, is a fact
which already indicates that this healthy and truly English
game will speedily take rank as the national sport of these
colonies. By a glance at the list of clubs in another page this
steady increase will be apparent. Reports of the several Grand
Matches are given elsewhere, and the following Review of the
Season is founded upon notes taken by the Editor of this work,
and extracts from the newspapers, more especially Bell's Life in
Victoria. Some matches may have been overlooked, and
consequently omitted, but in order to prevent that for the
future it is our intention to issue a set of forms to be filled up
by the Secretaries from the Club Scoring Books (two of which
should be used, one for scratch and the other for more
important matches with various clubs), which will, if properly
kept, give a succinct account of all events worthy of record
during the Season.
MELBOURNE CRICKET CLUB MATCHES.
(1.) At Melbourne, M. C. G. v. I Zingaki. The first match
of the season in connexion with the above club, took place on
Saturday, September 26,' 1857- The game was announced as
being between I Zingari v. County of Bourke, but was really a
match with the Melbourne Club. The victory was gained by
I Zingari in one innings, with 40 runs to spare, the score being
111 against 71. For I Zingari, W. L. Rees contributed (not
out) 29, Mr. A’Beckett 24, W. Hammersley 16, and J. Clark
12. For the Melbourne, G. Elliott scored 14, and J. M. Bryant
12 and (not out) 5.
(2.) At Melbourne, M. C. C. v. Ballaarat. This match
occupied two days, and terminated in favor of the Melbourne
Club, in one innings, with 160 runs to spare. The highest
scores on the Ballaarat side were obtained by Black (not out)
19 and 1, Wade 19 and 2, Cox 17 and 1. For the Melbourne
Club, Marshall contributed 67, Wills 87, Hammersley 42,
Wray, 21; Dick, 21. The bowling on the Ballaarat side by
Black and Saunders was rather inferior, while that of Wills,
Bryant, and Morres was first rate. The game was one-sided
all through, the Ballaarat men being disheartened, and not
having anticipated so strong a team against them.

(3.) At Ballaarat, M. CC. v. Ballaarat. In the return
match the Ballaarat Club went in first and scored 57, followed
by the Melbourne Club for 135. The score of the second
innings of Ballaarat amounted to 68, total 125, the Melbourne
Club again being the conquerors in one innings. For Bal-
laarat, H. Smith scored 10 and 19, D. Sweeney 13 and 7, B.
Watson 15 and 2. For Melbourne, Bryant contributed 50,
Hammersley 31, Butterworth 14, Bennett 11, and Wills
10. The contest was of a similar character to the former
match at Melbourne. The analysis of the bowling is as
follows: —
(4.) At Melbourne, New South Wales ». Victoria. The
annual grand inter-colonial match was played on the Mel-
bourne ground, ten out of the eleven players on the Victorian
side being members of the Melbourne club. The game was
won by Victoria with 171 runs to spare. (Full -particulars in
other pages.)
(5.) At Launceston, Tasmania ®. M. C. C. This grand
contest was decided in favor of the Melbourne Club eleven, in
one innings and 20 runs. The most remarkable event in con-
nexion with this match was the fact that Elliott, in the first
innings, secured 9 wickets in 72 balls, off which only 2 runs
were obtained. (Full particulars in other pages.)
(6.) At Hobart Town, M. C. C. v. Hobart Town. The
eleven from Victoria left Launceston for the above place, and
met with similar success, as at Launceston.
(7.) At Castlemaine, M. C. C v. Castlemaine. An important
match between two elevens of these clubs was played at
Barker’s Creek. As in previous battles, the Melbourne Club
was in the ascendant. The Castlemaine players were out of
practice, the ground being very rough, and the first innings
only amounted to 31, while the second was 74, Bell contribut-
ing 24, Morris 15 and 1, Bradshaw 9, J. Amos 8. The
Melbourne Club obtained 139 in one innings, Burchett scoring
86, Marshall 53. The wicket-keeping of the latter was a theme
of general admiration. Wills secured 9 wickets in the second
innings of Castlemaine Club.
(8.) At Maryborough, M. C. C. v. Maryborough. The eleven
from Melbourne proceeded from Castlemaine to the above
township, success still attending their efforts. For Mary-
borough, Coulstock contributed 12 and 9, Garland 27 and 8,

ceicketeb’s guide.


the first innings being 43, the second 63. For Melbourne, C.
Morgan scored 44, Wills 28, E. Mackenzie 22, Hammersley
10, Burchett 10, the total being 141, and winning, in one
innings, with 35 runs. A match was afterwards got up with
the eleven from Melbourne, against twenty-two of Mary-
borough, hut there was only time to play the latter innings,
being 60, the metropolitans not going in. The bowling of
Wills and Elliot was very effective.
(9.) At Melbourne, Gentlemen ®. Players. A contest
under this head, principally confined to M. C. C., came off for
the benefit of E. Coulstock. The event proved highly intere -
ting, though the gentlemen were so successful as to win in one
innings and 63 runs. For the players, J. M. Bryant contri-
buted 20 and 3, Coulstock (not out) 19 and 2, Elliot 1 and
15, S. S. Eennie 17, the total being—first innings 61, second
do. 68. For the gentlemen, W. Hammersley scored 64, T.
Morres 23, Wills 17, Wray 18, Patterson 12, and T. But-
terworth 63, the innings being 192. We cannot allow any
remarks on this match to appear without recording our opinion
on the want of taste displayed in drawing the above invidious
distinction in the two elevens selected. It may be considered
unobjectionable in England, but in these colonies such notions
ought not to be tolerated, as they tend to prevent that general
equality amongst cricketers which the nature of the game is
calculated to engender.
(10.) At Melbourne, M. C. C. ». I. Zingaei. The return
match was won by M. C. C. on the first innings.
(11.) At Melbourne, Emerald Hill v. M. C. C, This contest
originated with a challenge from the E. H. C., in consequence
of the M. C. C. having won nearly every match during the
season. The offer was accepted, on condition that twenty-two
of the Hill should meet an eleven of their opponents. It
should be stated that only five of the first Melbourne eleven
thought it necessary to attend in this game during the two days,
which may partially account for their having been defeated by
six runs. For Emerald Hill, W. H. Cardwell contributed 14
and 6, J. Evans 10, H. N. Warner 14, J. Thornton 9 and 3,
the totals being 49 and 65. For Melbourne, Bruce scored 22,
Evans (of Tasmania, not out) 12, Bryant 9 and 6, J. B.
Thompson 9 and 3, the totals being 66 and 44, six short.
The most remarkable feature of this match was that 22
actually batted in both innings, for the first time, though
many attempts had been previously made by various clubs.
(12.) At Melbourne, Emerald Hill v. M G. C. This was the
return match, and again occupied two days, A change was
effected by the Melbourne Club turning the tables against
their opponents. For Emerald Hill, Warner contributed 6
and 26, Kidson 12 and 1, Eobinson 1 and 11, Thornton 9, the
the totals being 66 and 66. For Melbourne, Wills scored 59,
Bryant 43, Gillott 20, Bruce 19, Thompson 14, Marshall 10,


the total being 195, and winning in one innings with 64 runs,
in addition to playing an up-hill game. Some dissatisfaction
was manifested by the E. H. C., in consequence of Wills
not being given out by the umpire when caught by the wicket-
keeper, after obtaining six runs; he afterwards remained at
the wicket till his score reached 59. According to the law of
the game he was not compelled to retire though conscious of
his being out.
(13.) At Melbourne, Collingwood v. M. C. C. The second
eleven of the Melbourne made an appearance against the first
eleven of the Collingwood Clubs, when theforxner found them-
selves over-matched bv the latter. The result was that the
Melbourne Club obtained 54 and 60, total 114; while the first
innings of the Collingwood reached 95, only 19 short of their
opponents two ; the match having been made for one innings
only. For Collingwood, G. Gillott contributed 22, Warner
15, Tuer 12, Chandler 11. and S. Gillott 10. For Melbourne
J. Mackenzie jun. obtained 6 and (not out) 14, Power 13 and 4,
T. M. Harrington 7 and 8.
(14.) At Melbourne, M, G, C. v. Collingwood. The first
eleven of the Melbourne Club commenced a contest with the
Collingwood, but it was not played out Wills played with the
latter and six wickets fell for 89, whilst the M, C. C. obtained
186. For Melbourne, G. Elliott contributed (though unwell) 69,
Patterson 13, A. M. Dick 12, H. Mackenzie 10.. For Colling-
wood, G. Gillott obtained 34, T. W. Wills 17, J. Eevely 11.
(15.) At Melbourne, St. Hilda o. M. C. C. A very unsatis-
factory contest between sixteen of the St. Hilda Club against
the first eleven of Melbourne Club. The first innings of St.
Hilda was 82, and in the second eight wickets fell for 28. The
one innings of Melbourne Club was 115, out of which Cumber-
land contributed 87, Morres 21, Wray 11, Grindrod 9, Wills 9.
For St. Hilda, not a double score was obtained throughout, the
highest figures being Sircom 2 and 9, Eees 8 and (not out) 1,
J, H. Webb 5, Elmslie Stephen 2 and 5.
(16.) At Melbourne, St. Hilda v. M. C. C. This match was
arranged for between the eleven selected to play for Victoria
against New South Wales (though only five presented them-
selves), against sixteen of St. Hilda Club. Only nine wickets
fell for St. Hilda, the score being 40, out of which Pickering
contributed 8, Abbott 7, J. H. Webb (not out) 6. For Mel-
bourne, Wray obtained (not out) 74, Marshall 60, Hamilton
28, Patterson 11, G. F. Burgoyne 11, the total number of runs
in the innings numbering 238.
(17.) At Melbourne, I Zingari v. M. C. C. An eleven of
the Melbourne Club (selected by Wray), only one innings
being played by them for 69, Cumberland obtaining 24, Dick
13, Wray 10. For I Zingari, Wills contributed 1 and (notout)
31, Patterson 2 and 15.
(18.) At Melbourne, Sixteen of Countt of Bourke v.

being 19(i.
RICHMOND CRICKET CLUB MATCHES.
(1.) At Richmond, Eennib v. Barter’s side. The opening
match on the 10th of October took place under the above
•auspices. Barter’s side of twelve contributed 113, Marshall
scoring 42, Barter 23. Rennie’s side of ten obtained 82, Coul-
stock making 33, Gillott 17, Brooker 13. A dinner was pro-
vided by Mr. Howe after the match.
(2.) At Collingwood, Richmond v. Collingwood. A sharp
contest, the result being 101 against 100. Much discussion
transpired in reference to one or two disputed points, respect-
ing which it is not in our province to advance an opinion
the only topic to be mentioned being that Warner retired
(sick) when only one run was wanted, for the Collingwood,
the scores being Wills 25, Reveley 19, Ross 19, Bryant 16.
For Richmond, Marshall made 39, Wray (not out) 22, Patter-
son, 19.
(3.) At Richmond, University v. Richmond. Several of the
oest players of the University Club were absent from this
match, the total innings amounted to 106, out of which Rees
obtained (not out) 53, Garrett 10, Harriman 6, Irving 5. For
Richmond, Marshall contributed 60, Clark 45, Williams 24,
Gillott 22.
(4.) At Richmond, Victoria r. Richmond. A match for
which the first innings decided the game, i esulted in favor of
the Victoria Club. For Richmond, Rennie obtained 15,
Shacklock (not out) 12, the total score being 56. For Victoria,
Bodill obtained 5 and (not out) 22, E. Mortimer 21 and 3,
Grave 12, the first innings amounting to 66, and the second
innings, with 5 wickets down, 56.
(5.) At Richmond, St. Kilda v. Richmond. This contest
created considerable sensation amongst those interested, and
was commenced October 31st. The St. Kilda team was very
strong, including Wills, Bryant and Butterworth. The sides,
however, were evenly balanced. The Richmond players
were unfortunate ; having two of the best bowlers in Victoria
against them, the wickets fell rapidly. Marshall maintained
his ground well and contributed 37, and Patterson 15;
others were very small in numbers. The innings closed for 76.
On the St. Kilda side, Bryant saw most of his compeers come to
and retire from the wickets, carrying out his bat for 45, Wills 13,
and Roberts 15. The innings amounted to 89. The match
was continued on November 21, when the St. Kilda players
scored 53, out of which Roberts contributed 16, and A’Beckett 10.
B


The Richmond had 66 to go in against, but only reached 36,
the wickets falling fast through over-anxiety; only two were
bowled, and four were run out.
(6.) At St. Kilda, Richmond v. St. Kilda. The return match
was played on April 17th. Though the score of the Richmond
was only 32, the innings lasted some time, Meyer alone making
a fair score, 14. Wills for St. Kilda contributed 38, and
H. Ryder 14; others did but little. The innings closed for 81,
giving St. Kilda a majority of 49 runs.
(7.) At Hawthorn, Richmond ®. Hawthorn. A very close
contest, the report given being 108 for Hawthorn and 107
for Richmond. A dispute arose in consequence of the score
having been incorrectly kept, and a discussion in J Hell's hife
followed between Mr. Barter and Mr. Lewis. . For Hawthorn,
W. L. Rees contributed (not out) 44, and T. Sunderland 27.
For Richmond, Marshall scored (not out) 57, S. S. Rennie 9,
and E. Binney 8.
(8.) At Richmond, Emerald Hill v. Richmond. The result
of this contest was given in favor of the Hill by their first
innings. For Richmond, no double figures were scored, the
innings closing for 35. For Emerald Hill, 92, and three wickets
down for 67, Kidson scoring 21, Moore 4 and 36, Easby (not
out) 26, Hopkinson 6 and 18, Stephens 11. The victory for
the Hill was principally owing to the excellent bowling of
Evans.
(9.) At Emerald Hill, Richmond ®. Emerald Hill. This
match was drawn in consequence of there not being time to
play one innings each. Emerald Hill scored 127, Hopkinson
making 41, and Kidson 80. The Richmond had seven
wickets down for 75, Patterson contributing 43, and Barter 9.

REMARKS UPON PLAYERS.
GRAND CRICKET MATCH —NEW SOUTH WALES V. VICTORIA.
VICTORIAN ELEVEN.
As onr opinions upon those gentlemen who played in the
previous Grand Match have not been controverted, we think
it desirable, with a few exceptions, to give similar remarks in
reference to those who likewise played in this contest.
Buttebworth B.— Long-stopping is the grand feature in
his play, and certainly could hardly be surpassed by the best
at home. His style of taking and returning the ball isparti-
cularly neat, there is no one in the colony can come near
him in this respect. As a batsman his play is rather slow,
and wanting in nerve and confidence ; his best hit is a forward
drive, style pretty good, and plays with a straight bat. All he
requires is practice in good matches to give him more
confidence in himself.
Bryant, J. M.— ls a very fair bowler, a good bat, and at point
his fielding is unequalled by any player in the colony. The
great fault in his play is slowness in hitting : a seeming want of
energy and life. His favorite hit is the cut, for which he is always
on the look out, and often loses the chance of making other-
hits. His defence is good, and he plays with a very straight
bat. As a bowler his delivery is particularly good: his
bowling is deceitful, being faster than it seems; but he is
not certain for any length of time.
Elliott, G.—Like Wills, is a most excellent bowler, the
batsman requiring a quick eye to dispose of his shooters and
leg twisters. He is true to the wicket, and his pace is fast.
For a swift bowler, he has excellent command over the ball; has
played in many up-hill games, with a bad field to second him,
and many of his best balls, from the hardness of the ground,
have not told when they would have done so on ground
not so lively. Is a good quick fieldsman, and never tires.
As a batsman he has been under-rated: his weak point is to
leg, but having a good eye he has one of the chief requisite
for a first-rate batsman.
* For particulars of Match, see Contents.


Hamilton, T.—An excellent field, with a capital defence in
batting. He was selected from several for this match, but
owing to want of practice was not so successful as anticipated.
Hammersley, W.—ls a sure player, and having been one of
the Cambridge University eleven, his opportunities for practice
have been numerous. His batting is neat and has always
been admired. H e is a formidable adversary, having a very
great command over the ball. Leg hits are great favorites
with him, and he drives with much power. In bowling he is
effective, and has a singular but pretty delivery ; we hope he
will cultivate this point of the game more. In the field has
generally been point, where he is very good.
Marshall, G. —Is one of the best wicket-keepers we have seen.
His style of taking the ball is especially good, and there is no
one in the colony who can compete with him in this point ot
the game. As a batsman he is a fine free hitter, but his defence
is bad ; he hits very much across, and is fond of taking liberties
with the bowling, often to his cost. With loose bowling he is
dangerous and will score rapidly. A shooter is a very fatal
ball to him. If his defence were equal to his hitting, he
would rank very high. As a cricketer he is well up in every
respect, and is a great acquisition in any eleven. He is en-
gaged this season to coach the Emerald Hill Club. His portrait
forms our frontispiece,
Morrks, T.—A. very superior bowler. Has a fair and steady
delivery, pace rapid, and it is generally admitted a very
excellent style of bowling. As a batsman he is at times
loose, but a very hard hitter; when well in is a dangerous
opponent. He is also good in the field, and should never be
left out of a grand match.
Pickering, W.—A great favorite with cricketers, and a
capital player at all points. Is a native of Sydney, a left hand
batsman, and an excellent underhand bowler. Is too easy in
batting, frequently allowing the ball to run up the bat, and
being caught behind the wicket, but severely punishes loose
bowling.
Rees, W. L. —ls a first-rate field, returning the ball
in a neat manner As a batter his style is cramped
at present, but his defence is good, aud he plays with
a straight bat; can hit also very fairly, but requires more
freedom in his style of batting. After practice, and when he
acquires a command over the ball, he will make a very fair
bowler ; his delivery is good, and his pace very fast, but he is
random and uncertain. His fielding is now the best point in
his play.
Wills, T. W.—As a batsman his style of play is inelegant,
but to make up for this his defence is good. He hits hard
and well at all points, and unless the bowling is very good
will score rapidly; is a very active fieldsman in any place.
His bowling is difficult to play. He bowls much with his


head, varies his pace considerably (with as much speed as
wisdom), and soon finds out a batsman’s weak point: is very
good with slow underhand, and can put on a considerable
twist. He can undergo any amount of exertion without
tiring, and as a general player is not excelled in this colony.
In England he was Captain of the Rugby and also of the
Cambridge University eleven, and acted as captain during this
match with New South Wales.
Wrat, T. P. —Very safe and at the same time free batsman,
possessing a good eye, very firm in his manner at the wickets—
practises what is called pendulum batting, cuts well, and
hits to leg prettily. He is very good in the field, and takes
great interest in the game.
NEW SOUTH WALES ELEVEN.
Beeston, J. L.—A pretty bowler and steady bat, cutting
well and hitting hard to leg. In the field very efficient.
Gilbert, George.—His batting is very effective but want-
ing in finish, and he would do more if not so fond of hitting
to leg. Is a good change round-arm bowler. His fielding is
good, being capable of covering a large space of ground and
running fast to stop or catch the ball. Altogether he is one
of the best and truest cricketers in this hemisphere. He acted
as captain of his eleven in this match, as well as at Sydney,
being in every way qualified for that important position.
Hilliard, H,—A sharp player, and is one of the best
cricketers New South Wales has produced. Possesses a good
defence, is a fine off-hitter, and would with more practice at
round arm howling, become a most formidable antagonist.
Is a good underhand bowler and an active field.
Howell, G.—Good, steady, and cautious bat; if his hitting
were as fine as his defence, would be indispensable in any
eleven, but in this respect requires more confidence and
freedom. He has very much improved, and evidently desires to
be a master of the game.
Lewis, o. — Has an easy delivery with good pace and length,
very true to the stumps, and evidently bowls much with his
head. In batting can score rapidly against the like bowling,
but wants more practice at the round arm style. Is a good
steady field.
Lewis, T.—A fair cricketer, is a very fast run-getter at loose
bowling, but is a random hitter and has not a good defence,
his belief seeming to lie in “ a short life and a merry one.”
Like the generality of the native players is a most active field.
M'Kore, J.—His forte is in underhand bowling, though his
style is very different from that of Lewis, and not so productive
of real cricket; it depends on the nature of the ground for


its effectiveness, being what has been termed the “ subterranean
touch.” Is a hard hitter and good in the field.
Mills, J.—A very promising player, being a superior field
and possesses fair capabilities for becoming useful in all
respects. Little was seen of his batting in this match.
Murray, R.—Plays freely and obtains large scores against
underhand bowling, but wanting more practice against the
round arm to score largely. Is a good change bowler, and
in the field is alike excellent with the remainder of the eleven.
Thompson, N.—A very good round arm bowler, having a
neat style of delivering the ball, which was much admired in
this match. As a batsman he is excellent, and fitted in all
respects for a first-rate cricketer.
Vaughan, R.—A hardy player, and like most natives cut
out for a cricketer. In the first innings he batted remarkably
well, carrying out his bat with a good score.
Having witnessed the Grand Match during the three days, the Editor
offers the above remarks on the players, trusting that the candid
opinions expressed may be indicative of the feelings which actuate
them. With reference to the following, the criticisms have been sup-
plied to us by the kindness of the Secretaries; only one local club
having favored us. We trust this part of the work may be considerably
extended in future issues.
EMERALD HILL CLUB.
Biers, H. —Knows the game well, and would be a good player, if
he were not shortsighted. A first-rate slow bowler.
Cardwell, W. H. —Is a very free hitter, especially to leg, but has
not a strong defence, and is rather too inactive in the field.
Glementson, E. —Evidently knows how to bat well, but having been
out of practice for four or five years, has been unfortunate this season;
is a splendid field.
Daish, W. —-Has fallen off in his batting this season ; but is steady
and painstaking.
Eashy, H. —An excellent wicket-keeper, and would be a very fair
bat if steadier.
Ellis, B. — Is a very promising young bowler, and a tolerably free
hitter, but has no defence; very good in the field. '
Evans, J. —ls one of the best underhand bowlers in the colony, is
also a good bat, but rather too fond of the draw.
Hall, H. —ls an exceedingly steady bat, and good in the field.
HopJcinson, S. —ls a difficult man to dispose of, if he overcomes
one or two overs; is also very useful in the field.

field at mid-wicket, and a good general cricketer.
Millidge, F. —Has improved considerably in batting since the com-
mencement of the season; still room for improvement in the field.
Moore, T.— Possesses a very good style of batting, and when once
well in, his wicket is a difficult one to obtain: fields well in his place,
mid wicket off.
B* 2

excellent cricketer, has a good defence, and cuts a ball neatly and
effectively ; bowls slow.
Thompson, W. —Has a very neat style of batting; and is a splendid
field, especially at long leg.

as a long-stop not to be excelled, and is a fair under-hand bowler.
DUTIES OF AN UMPIRE.
Before giving the instructions and duties of an umpire, we beg to
call attention to some excellent remarks taken from a late number of
Bell’s Life in London, written by Mr. F. P. Fenner, the celebrated
player of Cambridge. In a letter on the new law respecting bowling,
he refers to umpires as follows :—“ It has struck me that before any
marked improvement can be expected in the application of fresh rules,
it behoves the metropolitan law-makers to urge upon all cricketing
communities the necessity of having quick sightedand clear headed men
for umpires. Umpires may have character, and their respectability
may be irreproachable, but I would not stop there. They should
know cricket thoroughly—be conversant with all the minutise of the
game —be able to interpret , almost intuitively, the intention of any
law, however ambiguously expressed. Generally, umpires are well
paid, and so they deserve to be, for the office is a thankless one; but do
they —I am speaking of the provinces—as a rule know as much of
their duties as they ought, and very easily might ? Many really good
umpires, I am aware, are to be found in connection with country clubs,
who might be favorably compared with the same genusat Lord’s,but I


contend that such men are the exceptions—my own experience con-
vinces me they are not the rule. Let it not be supposed that I wish
to underrate the umpire—a glance will show that such is not my
meaning. I want to elevate—to introduce a higher standard, and
make men who wish, or are ambitious of becoming umpires to know
first, that an umpire is not required for ornament, but for vital service.
I want him to be qualified and made justly cognisant of his own im-
portance. I will appeal to the experience of any real cricketer whether
lie has not had upon some occasion to smother his indignity at palpably
false conclusions, resulting either from ignorance of the laws, or what
is worse, a carelessness in their administration. There are difficulties
of many kinds to contend with. It is a common thing for clubs to
have some gentleman connected with them who is not only an ad-
mirer, but a warmhearted supporter of the game, and who, perchance,
wishes, with the very best motives I am satisfied, to ‘ stand ’ for his
party in order to save expense, or. perhaps, more frequently
to be in a position where he can carry on an agreeable com-
munication with his friends throughout the match. It is
very difficult to refuse in these cases; but there is such a thing as
duty, and I would enforce upon all clubs, as a rule, that umpires
must, above all else, be acquainted with the laws of cricket to such an
extent as to he confided in as fair interpreters and exponents of their
meaning. This feeling need only be promulgated to produce reliable
umpires—men who, knowing the game, would, on that very account,
take a pride in the discharge of a trust, the importance of which can-
not be over-rated when we reflect on the sociabilities and great results
that betimes hinge upon its exercise.”
HINTS RESPECTING THE DUTIES OP AN UMPIRE.
The duties of an umpire require practice. Many a good judge of
the game is wholly incompetent to be umpire. Mr. Brunei, with all
his talent, deposed that he could not command his attention in any-
thing so mechanical as the driving of an engine; equally unfit is' a
sanguine and enthusiastic cricketer, for the patient and routine duties
of an umpire. “How’s that, Umpire?” we once heard, “’Pon my
word I wasn’t looking! ” was the reply. Now this was not at all more
stupid, though rather more candid, than “amateur umpires” in gene-
ral. Therefore either employ professionals, or experienced umpires,
or else make up your mind for blunders enough to spoil a match. For,
to say nothing of occasional inattention, and hardly knowing what
point to look out for, many a man, even among good players, is neither
so cool nor so sharp-sighted as to be able to decide a nice case of
stumping, or of running out.
In pitching wickets, see that your brother umpire does not choose
the ground, so as to favor a particular bowler; much advantage may
be taken in this instance. Pitch upright wickets, —fairly 27 inches out
of the ground, and 8 inches in width. Take as much pains about the
wickets as if you yourself had to bowl.
To count the overs correctly, use “pence” or “pebbles,” and drop
one after each ball from one hand into the other (some experienced
umpires will count with their fingers), as it is of importance that the
bowler should bowl no more than the four or six baits.


In calling “no ball,” call the moment the toe is over, or on the line
(ball delivered), or immediately the ball leaves the hand in case of
violation of the 10th law, or the batsman loses the chance of a “hit.”
If the toe is not over, or on the line, do not trouble yourself about it
seeming lifted at the moment of delivery, for it is impossible for
a bowler to deliver a ball iinless his toe is actually on the ground.
To be out “leg before wicket,” —first the ball must pitch straight
{straight, that is, not merely from hand to wicket, but straight actually
from wicket to wicket); secondly, you must be satisfied that no
“breaking” away or sudden rise should have prevented the ball from
hitting the wicket, if not stopped by the leg. Such is the law. With
round-arm bowling “leg before wicket” can very rarely occur, —much
more rarely than is commonly decided. On this point opinion differs,
so let every round-arm bowler join the near stump of his own wicket
with the opposite stump of the other wicket by a white thread, and
then try if he can ever hit the wicket with a good length ball that does
not pitch outside that line, and, consequently, not straight from
wicket to wicket. Without a “break-back” the thing is impossible
with any but an over-pitched ball, provided the bowler do not deliver
“over the wicket.”
Leg-byes should be called aloud to the scorers, by the umpire at
the bowler’s wicket, as soon as the run is made. The bowler’s umpire
also is the proper party to give notice of byes to the scorers, best done
by holding up the hand. A good umpire will avoid the necessity of
questions being unpleasantly screamed out from the scorer’s table.
“Wide balls” depend not on the crease, but on being out of the
reach of the batsman, a point left entirely to the umpire to decide.
Take great care that the bowler does not deliver wide of his return
crease, this, in effect, gives the batsman wrong guard, and will spoil
any match. Umpires should consider that the real interest of a match
is destroyed by one single blunder; the odds of 12 wickets to II may
result from a single mistake.
In “giving guard” calculate at the spot from where the bowler
delivers.
The question of a catch, either umpire may refer to the other, if he
himself could not decide.
The umpire at wicket-keeper’s end should narrowly watch the foot
of the batsman, especially in the “draw” or in “forward” play. He
must see that the wicket-keeper does not stump when his foot is
before, or head over the wicket, or where the ball has been taken
before the wicket.
The wicket-keeper’s umpire will stand with most advantage between
the two creases, at least 12 yards off, —if nearer, and if no* between
the two lines of the two objects, his eye cannot so easily take in the
foot of the batsmen, and the hand of the stumper at one view. Look
well to “ball in hand,” see that the stumper does not shake off the
bail with his toe, and observe narrowly that the wicket-keeper does
not violate Rule 35.
The umpire should call for roller (with consent) immediately the
last wicket is down. After one minute has elapsed, an objection may
be raised.
The runner cannot be out for running round his ground instead of
through, because the popping-crease is unlimited.
The hitter cannot make his partner “out” by striking the ball


through his wicket, unless his partner is off his ground, and the ball
touches (and therefore may be supposed to be guided by) the hands of
one of the opposite party.
A man may be fairly out by his “ arm before the wicket.” It is
enough to he allowed to save your wicket with gloves and hands,
without allowing arms.
An umpire should not enter into any conversation with either party
in a strict match; it gives him tbs appearance rather of a partisan
than of an impartial umpire.
RULES FOR THE FORMATION OF A CRICKET CLUB.
A set of Rules prepared to assist persons in the formation of a
Cricket Club was inserted in page 43 of our first volume.
PAYMENT OF SUBSCRIPTIONS.
Cheetham Hill Cricket Club. —At the Manchester County
Court, in England, before R. B, Brandt, Esq., judge, Ephraim
Sparrow was sued by the Cheetham Hill Cricket Club, of which
he was a member, for the recovery of f 1 Is., a year’s subscrip-
tion. The question whether such a club can recover has often
been discussed, and the Broughton Cricket Club, having some
time since brought a similar action, lost it; but they did not
take the same grounds as were taken in the present cose. The
defendant had been a member of the Cheetham Hill Club two
years, and in the first year he paid his subscription, which
was due in advance, on the 1st of January. In the second
year, however, he refused to pay his subscription, although
occasionally sitting on the committee; his objection being
that he had left the neighborhood, and did not consider him-
self a member. By the 14th rule of the club it was provided
that any person desirous of withdrawing should give a written
notice to that effect to the secretary before the 1st of January;
and, having done so, he should be considered to cease member-
ship at the end of the year. The defendant, however, had not
given any such notice. Mr. Brandt gave judgment for the
plaintiff’s, with costs. The defendant objected to pay the
costs, on which his Honor reminded him that “ the giblets
always went with the goose.” - Bell’s Life in, London.
Longsight Cricket Club v. Mr. T F . —This was
also an action brought in the above court, on Friday, March
19, before E. Brandt, Esq., for the recovery of £1 Is., being
one year’s subscription due for the season 1857. The club
was represented by the Treasurer and Secretary; the defendant
appearing through an agent. The defence raised was “ not
liable,” never having consented to become a member, or never-
having taken part in any match or game. The membership
being clearly proved, his Honor ordered “ payment forth-
with ” on the production of a note received from defendant
promising faithfully to pay the amount claimed on a date
named, — lAUywhite’s Gkiidefor 1858.

TABLE OF MATCHES.
The following will show at a glance the number of Matches
played by the Emerald Hill Club during the Season 1857-8.
We give this Table as a sample of one which would be found
very useful to Clubs in general:—
N.B.—Though we feel deeply indebted to the various Secre-
taries for their kindness in supplying us with the Batting
Averages, Bowling Analyses, and h ames of Members, we beg
to request that more care may he taken in the calculation of
the figures ; in many cases they had to be re-compiled. We
hope, however, that the new Forms for Information with which
we shall supply the Secretaries will be perfectly easy to fill up
from the Scoring books, and avoid the trouble we have had,

THE
LAWS OF CRICKET,
As revised (with the latest Alterations) hy the
Marylebone Club, London.
I.
THE BALL
Must not weigh less than 5J ounces, nor more than 5J
ounces. It must not measure less than 9, or more than 9J
inches in circumference. At the beginning of each innings
either party may call for a new ball.
11.
THE BAT
Must not exceed 4J inches in the widest part; it must
not be more than 38 inches in length.
111.
THE STUMPS
Must be three in number, 27 inches out of the ground,
the hails 8 inches in length; the stumps of equal and
sufficient thickness to prevent the ball from passing
through.
IY.
THE BOWLING CREASE
Must be in a line with the stumps; 6 feet 8 inches in
length, the stumps in the centre, with a return crease at
each end towards the bowler at right angles.
y.
THE POPPING CREASE
Must be 4 feet from the wicket, and parallel to it; un-
limited in length, but not shorter than the bowling crease.


VI.
THE WICKETS
Must be pitched opposite to each other, at a distance of
22 yards.
YII.
Neither party during a match, without consent of the
other, shall alter the ground by rolling, watering, covering,
mowing or beating, except at commencement of each
innings, when the ground may be swept and rolled at the
request of either party made to one of the umpires within
one minute after the former innings. This rule not to
prevent the striker from beating the ground with his bat
near the spot where he stands during the innings, nor the
bowler from filling up holes with saw-dust, &c., when the
ground is wet.
VIII.
After rain the wickets may be changed by consent.
IX.
THE BOWLER
Shall deliver the ball with one foot on the ground behind
the bowling crease, and within the return crease, and shall
bowl 4 balls before he change wickets; which he may do
once only in the same innings.
X.
The ball must be bowled; if thrown or jerked, or if the
bowler in the actual delivery of the ball, or in the action
immediately preceding'the delivery, shall raise his hand or
arm above his shoulder, the umpire shall call “ No ball.”*
XI.
He may require the striker at the wicket from which he
is bowling to stand on that side of it he may direct.
XII.
If the bowler shall toss the ball over the striker’s head,
or bowl it so wide that in the opinion of the umpire it shall
not be fairly within the reach of the batsman, he shall
adjudge one run to the parties receiving the innings, either
with or without an appeal, which shall be put down to the
score of wide balls; such ball shall not be reckoned as one
* Law repealed. —“ The ball must be bowled, not thrown or jerked, and
the hand must not be above the shoulder in delivery ; and if the bowler
infringe on this rule, so that it is difficult for the umpire at the bowler’s
wicket to judge whether the ball has been delivered according to this rule,
theumpire shall call “ No ball.”

of the four balls ; but if the batsman shall by any means
bring himself within the reach of the ball, the run shall not
be adjudged.
XIII.
If the howler deliver a “ No Ball” or a “ Wide Ball,” the
striker shall be allowed as many runs as he can get, and he
shall not be put out except by running out. In the event
of no run being obtained by other means, then one run shall
be added to the score of “ No Balls” or “ Wide Balls” as
the case may he. All runs obtained for “ Wide Balls” to
be scored to “ Wide Balls.” The names of the bowlers who
howl “ Wide Balls” or “No Balls” in future to be placed
on the score to shew the parties by whom either score is

keeper’s or bowler’s hand, or shall have passed through the
hands of the wicket keeper for the bowler to resume bowling,
it shall be considered dead; but when the bowler is about

his bat in hand, or some part of his person, be within the
popping crease.
c 2


XXX.
The striker shall not retire from his wicket and return to
it to complete his innings, after another has been in, with-
out the consent of the opposite party.
XXXI.
No substitute shall, in any case, be allowed to stand out
or run between wickets for another person, without the
consent of the opposite party; and in case any person shall
he allowed to run for another, the striker shall be out if
either he or his substitute be oif the ground in manner
mentioned in laws 17 and 21, while the ball is in play.
XXXII.
In all cases, where a substitute shall be allowed, the
consent of the opposite party shall also be obtained as to
the person to act as substitute, and the place in the field
which he shall take.
XXXIII.
If any fieldsman stop the ball with his hat the ball shall
be considered dead, and the opposite party shall add five

XXXVI.
THE UMPIRES
Are sole judges of fair or unfair play; and all disputes
shall be determined by them, each at his own wicket; but
in case of a catch which the umpire of the wicket bowled
from cannot see sufficiently to decide upon, he may apply
to the other umpire, whose opinion shall be conclusive.


XXXVII.
They shall, in all matches, pitch fair wickets, and the
parties shall toss up for the choice of innings. The umpires
shall change wickets after each party has had one innings.
XXXVIII.
They shall allow two minutes for each striker to come
in, and ten minutes between each innings. When the
umpires shall call “ Play,” the party refusing to play shall
lose the match.
XXXIX.
They are not to order a striker out unless appealed to
by the adversaries.

behind the bowling crease, and within the return crease
when he shall deliver the ball, the umpire at his wicket
unasked must call “ No Ball.”
XLI.
If either of the strikers run a short run, the umpire must
call “ One Short.”
XLII.
No umpire shall be allowed to bet.

if they have obtained eighty runs less than their antagonists,
except in all matches limited to only one day’s play, when
the number shall he limited to sixty instead of eighty.
XLYII.
When one of the strikers shall have been put out, the
use of the bat shall not be allowed to any person until the
next striker shall come in.
Note. —The committee of the Marylebone Club think it desirable
that previously to the commencement of a match, one of each side
should be appointed captain; and, that the new laws with
respect to substitutes may be carried out in a spirit of fairness and
mutual concession, it is their wish that such substitutes shall be
allowed in all reasonable cases, and that the umpire should inquire
if it is done with the consent of the manager of the opposite side.
Complaints having been made that it is the practice of some
players, when at the wicket, to make holes in the ground for a
rooting, the committee are of opinion that the umpires should be
empowered to prevent it.
LAWS FOR SINGLE WICKET.
I.
When there shall be less than 5 players on a side, bounds
shall be placed 22 yards each in a line from the off and leg
stump.
11.
The ball must be hit before the bounds to entitle the
striker to a run; which run cannot be obtained unless he
touch the bowling stump, or crease—in a line with his bat,
or some part of his person, or go beyond them; returning
to the popping crease, as at double wicket, according to
the 21st law.
111.
When the striker shall hit the ball, one of his feet must
be on the ground and behind the popping crease, otherwise
the umpire shall call “No Hit.”
IY.
When there shall be less than 5 players on a side, neither
byes nor overthrows shall he allowed, nor shall the striker
be caught out behind the wicket, or stumped out.


V
The fieldsman must return the ball so that it shall cross
the play between the wicket and the bowling stump, or
between the bowling stump and the bounds; the striker
may run until the ball be so returned.
YI.
After the striker shall have made one run, if he start
again he must touch the bowling stump and turn before the
ball shall cross the play to entitle him to another.

the same number for ball stopped with hat; with reference
to the 28tb and 33rd laws of double wicket.

11.
If the runs of one player be betted against those oi
another, the bet depends upon the first innings, unless
otherwise specified.
111.
If the bet be made on both innings, and one party beat
the other in one innings, the runs of the first innings shall
determine it.
IY.
If the other party go in a second time, then the bet must
be determined by the number on the score.


REMARKS ON THE LAWS OF CRICKET.
1. “At the beginning op each innings, either parti may
call pob a new bali.” —It is not customary to do so now; but,
before the days of John Small, a ball would not last a match.
3. “The popping crease is unlimited in length.” —In
the famous Nottingham Match in 1817, Bentley, on the All
England side, was well in, when he was given “ run out ” for
having ran round his ground. The umpire was changed, but
the blunder lost the match.
6. Pitching the wickets. — The umpires did not formerly
pitch the wickets. David Harris used to think a great deal of
pitching himself a good wicket, and took much pains in suit-
ing himself on a match day.
9. “The bowler shall deliver the ball with one foot
on the ground behind the bowling crease.” —If the foot is
not on or in front of the crease, there is no doubt of the ball
being fair, as no man in the full swing of bowling can deliver
the ball without his foot touches the ground.
10. “ The ball must be bowled, not thrown or jerked.” —
It must be left absolutely to the umpire to say whether this
rule is broken or not; also, as to height of delivery. • As to the
latter subject, Pycroft rules that the hand must not be above
the shoulder at any period of the act of bowling; others think
that the rule is complied with if the hand is sufficiently low at
the moment the ball leaves the hand. In case of “doubt ” as
to fair bowling, the umpire must decide against the bowler, so
the hand must be clearly “ not ” above the shoulder, and the
ball, as clearly, “ not ” thrown or jerked.*
12. “Wide balls.” —Some persons think there should be
a mark, making the same ball wide to a man of five feet or
one of six. It is competent for the players to agree upon such
a mark, if they please, before the commencement of the game;
but if there are really competent umpires, the rule is
better as it is. Pycroft says, “ a ‘ wide ’ does not depend on
whether the ball is pitched straight or not, but on the. distance
at which it passes the batsman.” We differ from him here,
and think, that if a ball is bowled straight a run ought not to
be scored against the bowler.
18. “Ip in striking at the ball.” —“In striking,” not
in running.
19. The umpire must say whether the striker shall use the
pretence “ for the purpose of baulking the catcher; ” if so he
is out.
* In reference to this law an alteration has been notified.


20. “ Wilfully strike it again.” —This obviously means,
when a man blocks a ball and afterwards hit it for the pur-
pose of making runs. This law was applied, very properly,
with rather a wide reading, in a match at Sheffield, in 1822,
when T. Warsop, while running, hit the ball to prevent it
coming into the wicket-keeper's hands. Clarke, who was play-
ing, thought that Warsop was deservedly given out.
21. “ With ball in hand.” —lt must be in the same hand
that puts down the wicket.
22. “If any part op the striker’s dp.ess, &c.” —lf in
the act of guarding his wicket, or striking at the bail.
24. “Any part op his person.” — A player was once given
out who, stooping his head, was hit in the face, and prevented
the ball taking the wicket. This rule raises the “ vexata
questio ” of “ Leg before wicket,” for remarks upon which,
see Duties of an Umpire.
29. The ball is not “dead” until the wicket-keeper shall
commence to return it to the bowler; but he must not pretend
to return it for the purpose of taking the striker off his guard.
The ball is “ alive ” again when the bowler starts to deliver it.
31. A discussion on this law has existed for some time, but,
at present, no definite regulation has been fixed. See remarks
in another page on this subject.
35. We have noticed two or three amateur wicket-keepers
who have either head or hand over the wicket. In such cases
should the bowler even take the wicket, if the umpire
is appealed by the striker, he must declare him “ not out.”
36. We must here remark upon the carelessness which is
too universally shown in the appointment of umpires in
the suburban matches, in many of which either one or both
have little, if any, knowledge of the game or its laws.
One or two wrong and ignorant decisions create a feeling of
dissatisfaction and wrangling, which is anything but in the
spirit of Cricket; and the better it will be for the advance-
ment of the game if more care is taken in this respect.
41. “ Short run.” —The bat must be grounded inside the
crease, not on it, or it is “short.” The same applies to a
bowler’s or batter’s foot, which if on the crease and no part
inside, makes a “ no ball ” in the first instance, and the striker
is out in the latter one.
44. “ After the delivery of four balls,” or six, as may
be agreed upon before the commencement of the match.
45. This rule is not rigidly enough adhered to, probably for
the reasons mentioned in our remarks on law XXXVI., and
is another proof of their necessity.

MANAGEMENT OF A MATCH.
We have noticed much want of interest in matches by the members
generally. The players selected should appoint a captain, who should
have the confidence of the field. A great deal of discontent and
disturbance has been created during the last two seasons by incom-
petent umpires; several gentlemen have made pretensions to the office
who, not having made the game a study, failed in giving satisfaction.
In making a match, bear in mind the old adage, “A match well
made is half won,”
As a general rule choose first innings; because it is easier to stop
runs than to make them, at the critical part of the match. Still you
may take into consideration that the dinner often spoils the bowling,
and some men have better sight and are less nervous after fielding
first. If you go in first, let two of your most safe batsmen be put in,
that you may “kill” the bowling in the early part of the game. When
a player is put out, and the bowling becomes loose, put in a resolute
hard hitter; also when two players have been at the wicket some time,
and become warm, and one is put out, take great care to fill the vacant
place immediately, lest the other should become cold and stiff, A fine
off hitter and a fine leg hitter together puzzle the field.
Take care when you put in one of those half-bred cricketers who
cannot judge a run. He may run your best hitter out.
As two free hitters must rim each other out of breath, if possible
manage to get in a steady bat and a hard hitter together.
Before playing a match, let your eleven practise together, each in
his own place, and each going in in the same order as in the match.
If your party take the field first, let your bowlers take full time
between the delivery of the balls. If your opponents get well in, and
are getting runs too fast, change the bowler from whom most runs are
obtained, taking care that the bowler you put in his place is opposite
to him both in delivery and speed.
You should avoid indulging nervous practices—if asked to go in
first, go immediately; never decline through prejudice and super-
stition. There is nothing like bringing yourself continually to think
(whether you have been at the wicket an hour or not), that you are
just beginning again.
If your side have to go in for a certain number of runs in your last
innings, always keep back two or three of your best and steady bats-
men for the last wickets. Timid or hazardous players seldom do so
much, when the game is well contested, as those who are steady and
scientific players.
Never put in all your best batsmen together, otherwise “the tail” is
worth nothing.
In choosing your eleven, if five or sis bat by the eye, without any
settled principle, choose the best fieldsmen; good bowling is sure to
equalise bad batting.


CRICKET—ITS HISTORY.
[ln our first volume of the Cricketer's Guide for Australasia, we
inserted “ Instructions to Cricketers, by Pycroft, the author of the
Cricket Field.” In this, our second issue, we give a similar article,
taken from an old English Guide (Lillywhite’s), and we strongly
recommend it to our colonial players as well worthy careful perusal.
The Editor will be glad if friends will communicate with him in
reference to any matters of interest to Cricketers, which would be
adapted for insertion in the annual guide.]
Cricketing, under its present denomination, is altogether a modern
amusement, and is neither mentioned nor described by any writer
earlier than the commencement of the last century.
There is reason, however, to believe that club-ball was first practised
by the Saxons, and afterwards adopted by the Normans. It is certain,
however, that the works of our earliest poets, who so frequently drew
their images from the pastimes and common occupations of men,
contain no passages which can be supposed to allude to this amusement.
Shakespeare, whose plays abound with similes drawn from the
noblest and meanest diversions, nowhere mentions “Cricket,” and
Massenger, Shirley, Marlowe, and the other dramatists who followed,
being likewise silent on the subject, leads us to the necessary conclusion
that during the reigns of Elizabeth and lames the amusement was not
practised. The latter monarch, in his written directions for the
amusement of his son and his nobility, describes certain “exercises and
games as very commendable, as well as for the banishment of idleness; ”
but does not include in his list the game of “ Cricket.” Burton, in his
learned work, the “Anatomy of Melancholy,” recounts the amusements
of the people, “ which are not to be winked at,” lest they should do worse
than attend them, as foEows: “Binging, bowling, shooting, playing
with reel pins, tronks, quoits, pitching of bars, hunting, wrestling,
leaping, running, fencing, mustering, swimming, foil, foot-ball, balloons,
running at the quintain,” and other games; but “Cricketing” is not
amongst them. The first time the appellation is mentioned by an
English writer is in Strutt’s “Sports and Pastimes where it occurs
in one of the songs of Tom B’TJrfey, the royal poet, “Pills to Puree
Melancholy: ”
“Herr was the prettiest fellow
At football or at Cricket,
At hunting chase, or nimble race
Bow featly Herr could prick it.”
In the time of Edward 111. (from 1312 to 1377), club-ball, played
by two persons, a bowler and striker, was very common.
It is worthy of remark that the next writer who has been indebted
to Cricketing for a metaphor or comparison, is George Canning (late
prime minister of England). It is contained in a small periodical
work, “Microcosm” which was written by Canning at the age of


fifteen, assisted by bis school-fellows of Eton. It is, perhaps, the only
passage in English literature, where Cricketing and reasoning are so
pleasantly commingled, Tiz.: —
“In like manner as the human mind is everywhere strongly
analogous to the natural system, a Cricketer will, in poring over a
page of Horace, lose the trophies which await him as hero of Hamp-
shire, and bulwark of White Conduit,* and exchange the invigorating
commendations of a Small, Shock, White, and Lumpy,f for the dull
drudgery of blundering through ten long years of scholastic labor.
The poet will be equally circumstanced in the field; no innate
consciousness of knowledge can console him for the ridicule of an
unforeseen trip; no muse of Parnassus secure his wickets; nor Minerva,
however serviceable she might have been formerly on similar occasions,
avert an all-levelling bowl from the nervous arm of his Boeotian
adversary.”
Since the above beautiful passage has been published, “Cricketing”
has become the game of the people; the village green and the noble-
man’s park are alternately the place where it is practised, and, in
pursuit of the generous amusement which it affords, the sturdy peasant
and the peer, who considers he is not disgraced by being athletic, are
seen contending together. Hampshire has the honour of having been
the first county where the game of Cricket was brought to perfection.
Morton, in his Play of “ Speed the Plough,” written many years since,
causes his farmer to confess “We Hampshire lads can bowl a bit, or
thereabouts.” Their pre-eminence, however, was sometimes disputed
by Kent; but in several matches played against all England, about
forty years since, Hampshire gained the victory, and her* Hambleton
Club became the terror of all its contemporaries. Surrey and Middle-
sex next cultivated the sport; and the two maritime counties, Sussex
and Norfolk, afterwards followed their example.
The first inland county in which the game was introduced, is,
perhaps, Nottinghamshire; and the players in the principal town
(Nottingham), so soon acquired reputation that, with double numbers,
they ventured, thirty-five years since, to challenge Marylebone. Two
matches were played by them; one in Xxmdon, and the other in
Burleigh Park; but they were defeated. Cricketing was now estab-
lished in the heart of the country; and from the exertions of our
celebrated slow bowler of Nottingham, it has become more so, since
first rate artists travel some hundreds of miles to contend against some
other club not so much instructed in the game; consequently players
of various degrees of merit are to be found in every town and village
in the kingdom.
The learned and indefatigable Strutt was the first and only author
who wrote a work expressly to describe the sports of the country;
and he says—
“ Cricketing has of late years become exceedingly fashionable, being
much countenanced by the nobility and gentlemen of fortune, who
frequently join in the diversion.” He goes on to say: “ This game
which is played with a bat and ball, consists of a single and double
wicket. The former requires five players on each side, the latter
eleven; but the numbers may be varied on both sides at the pleasure
* The two celebrated clubs at that time. f Four noted players*


of the parties. At single wicket, the striker with the bat is the
protector of the wicket; the opposing party stand in the field to catch
or stop the ball; and the bowler, who is one of them, takes his place
by the side of a small baton or stump, set up for that purpose 22 yards
from the wicket, and from thence delivers the ball with the intention
of beating it down; if ho prove successful, the batsman retires from
his play, and another of his party succeeds.
If, on the contrary, the ball is struck by the bat, and driven into
the field, beyond the reach of those who stand out to stop it, the
striker runs to the stump at the bowler’s station, which he touches
with his bat, and then returns to his wicket ; if this be performed
before the ball is thrown up, it is called a run, and one notch or score
is made upon the tally towards the game. If, on the contrary, the
ball be thrown up, and the wicket beaten down with it by the opposite
party before the party (striker) is at home, or can ground his bat
within 3 ft. 10 in.* of the wicket, he is declared to be out of his play,
and the run is not reckoned; he is also out if he strikes the ball into
the air, and it he caught by any of his antagonists before it reaches the
ground, and retained long enough to be thrown up again. When,
double wicket is played, two batsmen go in at the same time, one at
each wicket; there are also two bowlers, who usually bowl four balls
in succession, alternately. Both parties have two innings, and the
side that obtains most runs in the double contest, claims the victory.
These are (says the writer), the general outlines of this noble pastime,
but there are many other particular rules and regulations by which it
is governed, and those rules are subject to variations, according to the
joint determination of the players.”
This description of the game is merely to he understood as that
given by the spectator for the instruction of those who never saw the
wickets in the field. The laws of the game, and their alterations from
time to time, are, by general consent of provincial cricketers, always
received from the Marylebone Club.
If the assertion of celebrated writers be true, that the character of a
people may be discovered by observing the nature of their amusements,
every Englishman must feel gratified that the sport denominated
“ Cricket,” after having been for a number of years the favorite pas-
time of the inhabitants of many parts of England, has at last become
national. “ Cricketing ”by common consent, has gained the appella-
tion of noble. The qualities necessary to those who practise it are
courage, activity, and perseverance; and we may justly be proud, if
foreigners judge of our national habits and disposition in reference to
an amusement of such an excellent character. The objections which
some men raise against the public practice of sports, that they are
generally too puerile for the adult, and perpetuate the pastimes of our
infancy, cannot be applied to “ Cricketing.” Manliness is the charac-
teristic of the game; and in the practice of its various parts, those
qualifications which form and adorn the soldier are necessarily culti-
vated and acquired by the player. The batsman must learn to meet,
with firm nerves, an object propelled against him with great force,
and, by the union of strength and skill, strike it with his utmost force
amongst his antagonists. The bowler must acquire the art of pitching
* Two inches less than now used.


a length ball 5 and in doing this must alternately depend on stratagem
and strength; and the fielders, like sentinels, follow the ball with the
rapidity with which it cuts the air, and grasp it in the hands, though
at the risk of being overturned by the impetus with which it fafls.
The highest pleasure which is felt by generous persons contending in
sport against each other arises from the knowledge that they are the
cause of gratification to those who behold them. Amongst cricketers
the pleasure is heightened by the conviction that their pastime is
untainted by vulgarity and cruelty; and that their fair countrywomen
may witness the prowess of a brother, a lover, or a husband, without a
blush, or the painful sense of impropriety. He, indeed, must hold
pleasure to be a thing altogether forbidden—must be insensible to the
charms of nature and the beauty of manliness—who could behold a
Tillage green, where the young contended and the old admired, without
acknowledging that a cricket match, with its attendant circumstances,
formed the most pleasing picture which the holidays of the people of
any country can produce.
Most sports in their decision create heart-burnings and jealousies,
and, in proportion as the winner triumphs, the loser becomes splenetic
and depressed. This, however, cannot be said of “ Cricketing.” The
defeated party leaves the field without diminution of honor or reputa-
tion ; for the winners may have been indebted for their superior score
to chance, or the good fortune of one man 5 or, perhaps, the play
might have been pronounced better on the losing than the winning
side, notwithstanding the result.
It is likewise worthy of remark that Cricketing is seldom made the
object (at least among “ Cricketers” themselves), of gambling specula-
tions ; it being notorious that tbe best players contend merely for
honour; while the game, including so many as twenty-two persons,
prevents the unfair sportsman being enabled, with tbo least tolerable
certainty, to bet on any positive event, unless it could be supposed that
the players, as a body, were all dishonest, and that an individual, if he
possessed the inclination, could find a purse of sufficient depth to bribe
them all,
THE NUMBER OP PLAYERS
Is twenty-two, eleven on each side. The following pages will give
a description of the different stations in the field, and of the importance
of each in his station.
The young cricketer, for the purpose of having practice, should
enter some club, which, from the late increased popularity of this
national game, he will have no difficulty in accomplishing. He will
then require the cricketing dress, composed of flannel. A belt round
your waist is far preferable to braces. Pads and gloves, to guard tbe
legs and hands, must also be obtained.
CHOICE OP GROUND.
In choice of ground it is not necessary to look for a level or smooth
piece to pitch your toickets , but where tbe ball (or thereabouts) should
be pitched ; at that spot you should look out a smooth piece, as near
the centre as possible. It should be well rolled, and the grass kept
short by being fed by sheep. If the club which you have joined should


have to contend against another, it is the Umpire*s duty to choose the
ground. (Laws from 36 to 45 deserve particular attention respecting
Umpires). These should he men of sufficient judgment on all points
of the game; also of good character for honesty of mind, and free
from partiality and bribery*
THE BOWLER.
At the present day the ball is delivered with the greatest precision
and style, so different to that formerly, which was easily playable by
all of quick sight and resolute mind, so that often the merest tyro
would baffle for hours the skill of an accomplished bowler ; now, to so
nice a point has it been brought, that no game is more trying to the
scientific accomplishment of the player than the game of Cricket. A
very few overs from such bowlers as Hillyer, Day, Wisden, or Lilly-
white, and many others, will convince the sceptical of this fact; and
since the round-hand bowling has been substituted for the under-hand,
and become one of the laws of the game, it is necessary for the young
cricketer to begin practising it, and against it, as early as possible.
Mr. Willes, a Kent gentleman, first introduced round-hand bowling,
and E. Budd, Esq,, and Lambert first practised it, in a match played
at Goodwood Park, forty years ago, when Messrs. Aislabie, Ward,
Osbaldeston, Beldam, Robinson, and the Broadbridges were in their
prime. It was this match that first excited Lillywhite and James
Broadbridge, from Sussex (who were then spectators), to apply them-
selves to the round-hand bowling, and to their complete success may
mainly be attributed the lasting innovation upon the under-hand
bowling. The improvement became too obvious for any opposition
long to prevent its becoming general, although for several years the
Marylebone Club resolutely opposed it. In the year 1823 Lillywhite
went to reside at Brighton, and it was then that Broadbridge and him-
self, for their county, achieved the complete mastery for many years over
all other counties by the severity and superiority of their round-hand
bowling. That gave the tone to Surrey, Kent, Hampshire, Notting-
hamshire, and other counties. The result has been closer application
to practice by our eminent batsmen—Pilch, Parr, Mr. Eelix, Mr. C.
H. Hoare, Caffyn, Sampson, Box, Guy, John Lillywhite, Baldwinson,
Martingell, Mr. Vernon, the Messrs. Walker, and a great many more,
too numerous to mention. Not only have their talents and still
reduced the bowling of the present day to be comparatively easy, but
well-nigh gained that ascendency over it which for many years the
bowling obtained over the batsman; therefore, if the game is less
interesting to the generality of spectators than formerly, to those who
at all understand it, it has become a game of greater excellence, more
scientific display, and exciting rivalry.
- it is very necessary to keep the body upright, as the
pitch of the ball depends very much upon your pace, as well as the
batsman’s style of forward or backward play.
Practise taking a short run to deliver your ball; you will by so
doing save yourself much unnecessary fatigue. After bowling your
oyer, accustom yourself to short slip, or the draw, neither of which
situations are likely to distress you at the time you are wanted to bowl
again. Deliver your ball from full six inches behind the bowling


crease; accustom yourself to do so, and you will avoid giving a
“ no ball.”
Try every manoeuvre to make the ball twist and shoot after it
touches the ground; one such ball will often do more' service for you
than a hundred well-delivered rising ones, however true. The ball
should be held with the fingers and thumb merely firm enough to have
command. Advise with the wicket keeper as to the position of the
fieldsmen ; he can best assist your wishes by silently shifting the men
unknown to the batsman.
Do not make a point of appealing to the umpire, unless you feel
confident the reply will be favorable; it becomes unpleasant to all
parties if the appeal is made frivolously. Always start to bowl with
an object in view—a result in your mind to accomplish, and bowl with
decision. Do not over-bowl yourself by random bowling; although
you should begin bowiing resolutely. Do not commence at the top of
your speed and strength. If you begin like a lion you will soon end
like a lamb. Nothing disconcerts a bowler so much, and prevents
him carrying out his object so readily, as losing his confidence or his
temper.
A good length ball now and then pitched a little wide of the off
stump will often turn to great advantage, for it may produce a catch
when a straight one would be stopped with ease.
THE BATSMAN.
Place both hands on the middle of the handle of the bat near* to each
other, but not so as to touch; if the hands are far apart one will act
against the other, and the playing will be weak.
In taking the position at the wicket, inquire from which side the
bowler will deliver the ball; also ask the umpire from whence the ball
is delivered to give you guard. The best guard for the young cricketer.
to take is between the middle and leg stump, commonly called “ two
leg” (that being, generally, a cricketer’s weakest point); if the bowler
should change his side you will require another guard, which, by
asking the umpire, he will give you. Place your bat upon the spot
upright, and make a mark on the ground, so that you may know it
again. This will prevent you from getting your leg before the wicket.
The toes should incline towards the opposite wicket. Fix your right
foot just near enough to the crease to be on your ground, and as near
the blockhole as you can, without being before either stump; then fix
your left foot lightly on the ground, as wide as you conveniently can,
immediately between yourself and the bowler. Never mind appearing
awkward, as you are constrained to play correctly. You will find that
you have more power to hit on the “off side” than on the “on.”
When at practice stand fixed according to these directions, and poke
away as clumsily as may be till you have played some eight or nine
hundred balls, taking care never to allow the point of your bat to be
turned the least upwards. A little of this exercise will bring you in
the proper position of keeping the left elbow well up, and nearly in
the direction of the bowler. Attempt but one thing at a time. Get
in the position as above stated, but with your bat upright, and its
point never as near the bowler as its shoulder.


Never think of making any particular hit before the ball is bowled;
should you do so, a ball that does not suit your purpose will often
cause a mistake; also a bowler who is a good general will take
advantage of it, and lay open his field in a point where he sees the
hitter fond of hitting, and immediately give him a ball of just the
wrong sort for the purpose, to tempt him to strike across the wicket.
A few days’ practice, without one risk intentionally, will take off all
unsteady propensity when in a game. Stepping in to hit is a style of
play that many have tried, though few have found it answer. Never
leave the ground to play at any ball; if so, you will not have occasion
to repeat it with a good wicket-keeper; or the bowler, on seeing you
leave, will “ drop one short.”
.When at practice with merely a bowler, you should play as if the
eleven men were stationed in the field. The bowler should be the
judge where the men ought to stand, and may decide all chances given.
Forbear to run beyond your strength, and pay due regard to that of
your partner; being out of breath or fatigued is incompatible with
steady hitting.
THE WICKET-KEEPER *
Holds the place of most consequence in the field; he stands at the
wicket to receive the ball from the bowler should the batsman not stop
it. This place enables him to have a full view of the field, more so
than any other player, and consequently he is the proper person to
direct the fieldsmen, simply by the motion of the hand; it is done with
perfect silence, and therefore the striker is not aware of the change.
This cannot be effected without proper attention is paid to him on the
part of the fieldsman, when arriving at his appointed place. The
bowler has an advantage in noticing the particular points of a bats-
man, and therefore has occasion to move the fieldsman; he can have
no difficulty in communicating his opinion to the wicket-keeper.
When it is slow bowling the field must be arranged differently,
extending them considerably over the field.
The position of a wicket-keeper should be with his left leg extended,
so that he may move in an instant in any direction he pleases, and
feel himself easy. The upper part of the arms to the elbow should
hang down easily by the body; from the elbow they should incline
upwards to the chest, both hands being open, and the left rather
higher than the right. He should stand a little distance from the
wicket, but close enough to stump the batsman should he be off his
ground.
The wicket-keeper should be active in eye, mind, and body, and be a
sufficient judge to decide quickly the exact situation of every fieldsman
for the purpose of saving runs.
Should there be no fieldsman placed at the draw the wicket-keeper
is required to move from the wicket; this is generally a safe run; the
slip should then take his place to receive the ball. This run can
sometimes be saved by the wicket-keeper starting before the ball is
struck.
When the batsmen are running the hall should be thrown generally
* See Frontispiece.


to tlie wicket-keeper ; but it requires judgment, as it may sometimes
be requisite to throw it to the bowler. He should stand in a position
to receive the ball, so that he may draw his hands back and put the
wicket down in one motion. This should be done steadily ; if done in
a hurry the wicket is seldom put down with the ball in hand. The
ball should be tossed easily and quickly home to the bowler; and if
wet should be wiped before it is returned to the bowler.
HOW TO PLAY A BALL THAT RISES TO THE
SHOULDER OF THE BAT, OR A “BAILER.”
Immediately on seeing the pitch of the ball throw back the bat’s
point towards the top of the wicket, by the ply of wrist, and play the
ball down before you; by this manoeuvre the hat rather meets than
follows the ball, and has therefore greater quickness; but great
judgment is required, which may be accomplished by practice, in
making a mark that shall be visible to yourself; use your judgment as
to when the ball is pitched nearer, and when further than this mark;
if further from you, your play must be back; if nearer, forward.
Here again the left elbow must be in its proper position. If the ball
should rise higher than the wicket, let it pass by removing the bat.
HOW TO PLAY A SHOOTING BAL£.
These are the most destructive of all others, and defend almost
entirely on the ground, and not the least on the will of the bowler.
As soon as you see the length of the ball prepare yourself for its
shooting, as if it were more to be expected than rising; you will then
drop your bat much more quickly than if you expect it to rise, and
need be under no apprehension of being too slow for the “ bailer.”
This will not require any length of practice if you take pains, but will
never be acquired without.
HOW TO STOP A STRAIGHT AND GOOD LENGTH BALL.
When you see the ball pitch, move the left leg forward about three
feet, so as to meet the ball with a full face; by continual practice you
will gain the power of reaching forward. The advantage of reaching
forward consists in smothering the ball with all its shooting and
twisting propensities. You must be careful in reaching out thus far
that you do not get the toes of the right foot over the popping crease;
if so, and you do not stop the progress of the ball with your hat, a
good wicket-keeper will stump you out. A good length ball depends
entirely upon the size and reach of a batsman.
The exercise of rowing considerably increases a man’s reach; there
is also a gymnastic exercise, of which the object is to touch the feet
with the hands without bending the knees. I believe that most men
could, by practising a long reach with the bat, or exercising in the
above manner, increase their span nearly a foot. This will enable
you to stop good length halls, and play them back.


HOW TO PLAY AT A BALL DROPPED SHORT OF A
LENGTH ON THE OFF SIDE.
You must play perfectly upright and straight at halls that arc wide,
as well as those in a direct line for your wicket; all these hits will
follow by practice, and no rule can help you much. If your left elbow
is not kept well up and the bat upright, the ball will fly up in the air
by touching the off edge of the bat. To play this ball with an upright
bat you must move your right leg across the wicket; this action will
give the striker great power and command. Practise these balls
continually, and you will rarely “ let pass” any off balls much short
of those given “wide.” If it is a good length ball and a little wide it
is better to play it down, as it is not a safe hit. When you have
accomplished this task you will have no difficulty in playing “ cover or
slip hits;” but always prepare steadily, coolly, and with decision; and
the bat, in stopping as well as in hitting, should strike the ball, and
not the ball the bat.
Avoid playing with a bat too heavy to handle comfortably. Bats
from 21b. to 21b. 2oz. are generally used. The hand can never be so
quick as the eye, and a heavy bat will increase your difficulties very
considerably.
The system of cutting and playing by eye and guess, rather than by
judgment of the length, causes a man’s play to vary with the state of
the ground and the bowler’s delivery. The proof of the best batting
is, staying in the greatest length of time and gaining most runs with
fewest foul hits.
HOW TO PLAY A BALL THAT IS PITCHED ON THE
INSIDE OF THE LEG STUMP, SHOOTING.
I here again state that you should place your right foot just within
the crease; it is not only intended for your reaching forward, but that
you may retain a clear space between your foot and the wicket. I
also mentioned that at the moment of the ball being delivered the bat
should be pointed towards the bails, for the convenience of stopping
shooting balls; this is also useful for leg hitting; your wrist will thus
be a little behind you, and only a slight turn of your body will be
required to let you block between your leg and the wicket, which is
called “drawing a ball.” You must direct the outside edge of your bat
slightly towards yourself. The ball will go in the direction of the
umpire, and is a safe run if a fieldsman is not placed to stop it. The
young batsman should well practise this point, as it weakens the field
to place a man there, and in consequence, gives an advantage to the
batsman.
If the ball is wide to the leg, and it would be advantageous to turn
to it, then attend to the position I have directed—the left foot merely
light enough on the ground to balance yourself—and you have no
difficulty in turning to hit round as hard as you can along the ground.
Above all, never turn to a ball which you might play nearly straight
back for one or two runs; leg balls are most apt of any to turn to the
wicket, and the best hitters often miss them.
Before concluding this department of my instructions I will direct
you in the most advantageous exercise of this skill. On taking the
bat be in no hurry about making runs; devote the first “ over” or two


to getting your eyes open, and surveying the mode of your opponent’s
attack; and suppose that hereupon you find the bowler has discovered
your weak point—say the leg stump—and directs every ball to it; in
that case endeavour not to let one overpitch or wide ball go un-
punished ; prefer playing for a certain one or two to the chance of
making a splendid hit. Nothing puts a bowler so much off his tack as
sure hitting, however gentle.
A good general will often place three men instead of two on the
“on” side, and make other alterations to suit your play; when you
see this make all the use you can of the opening thus caused; this
may bring the man back to his place, and allow you your favorite hit.
Consider sometimes how many times you have been out when you
might have kept in by more steady play.
THE POINT.
The young fieldsman who is appointed to this situation should
possess a quick action; if it is slow bowling he should stand about five
yards, or five yards and a half from the batsman, and particularly
watch the pitch of the ball. In slow bowling you may sometimes be
required to run in and almost take the ball from the bat. If it is fast
bowling he should stand at least seven yards. In backing up, this
fieldsman should always keep behind the slip.
LONG FIELD, STRAIGHT OFF.
In this position of the field he should be able to throw well; his-
station is to cover the bowler and middle wicket, and Out far enough
to save two runs.
THE LONG FIELD ON
is on the opposite side of the wicket, also covering the bowler, and out
sufficiently far to save two runs. This point also requires an excellent
thrower.
THE LONG LEG
for a “square leg hitter” should stand parallel to the wicket. Some
batsmen will hit later at a leg ball than others; if so, this fieldsman
must stand deeper. He should be able to throw well, and run well,
and should begin to run as soon as the ball is struck.
THE LONG STOP
is placed behind the wicket-keeper; if the ball pass the wicket-keeper*
it is his place to return it as soon as possible to him. He should
practise to throw with a quick action to the top of the wicket, or a
“bye” will often be obtained. In addition to this he is required to
cover many slips from the bat, both to the leg and off side.
SHORT SLIP.
The situation for the slip is between the wicket-keeper and point,
but nearer to the former, as it affords more play for his right hand.
The position of the body and the distance from the wicket are the
same as given to the point. •
This fieldsman should be constantly on his guard, as the balls
usually come from the bat with considerable swiftness. In backing up,
the slip should come next to the wicket-keeper. A third man in the
slip at times is required.


THE LONG SLIP
is generally placed between the short slip and point, but is sometimes
required behind the slip. This is a station of great difficulty in fast
bowling.
THE MIDDLE WICKET (OH OR OFF)
should stand about eleven or thirteen yards in a line with the bowler’s
■wicket. This situation requires a person of good judgment and
activity. There is no place in the field where so many struggles occur
to get a run, as also catches and severe hits. The eyes, legs, and
hands are never unoccupied.
LONG FIELD, COVERING MIDDLE WICKET AND
POINT,
is a situation where many hard hits are made. He should always get
the motion of the batsman; he will then get the start of the ball.
The fieldsman is sometimes brought in to save the one run, but the
bowling must be first-rate. He should not wait and let the ball come
to him, but dash to meet it, fielding it with his right hand, and
throwing it with a quick motion at the top of the stumps to the
wicket-keeper’s or bowler’s hands, whichever may be required; if
done neatly and quickly, it has a beautiful effect, and is the very
essential part of good fielding.
THE SCORER
Has an important duty to perform, and his attention must be sus-
tained from the beginning to the end of the game. Generally speaking,
members are not sufficiently attentive to the importance of correct
scoring; and from the inadequate manner in which many of the clubs
have supplied the information to us it is evident there never will be
proper records kept until the Scoring and safekeeping of the books be
rigidly adhered to. W e have referred to this in another part of the work.
The following are the Instructions to Scorers given in the “ Scoring
Books,” published by the Editor of this Guide, Melbourne, and wiU
be found, we hope, most useful to those who really wish to give a
complete and lasting record of the game
“First column shews the order of going out. Second column : the order
of going in, with names of Batters. Third column : place a figure down
for the number of runs the Batsman gets each hit—the top line to be
used if the score more than fills the bottom one. Fourth column : how the
Player is out. The Fifth column : who howled the ball; if the player is
stumped, put “St.” and the Wicket-keeper’s name: if caught, “ C.,” and
the catcher’s name in the fourth column, and the Bowler’s name in the
fifth: in the case of a run out, put “run out,”and the name of the person
who put down the wicket, in the fourth column, —and “ thrown,” with the
name of the person who returned the ball, in the fifth column. The Sixth
column shows the total of runs obtained by each player. The first horizontal
column is for the bowler’s name, from whom is obtained “ Byes,” &c.; but
in making up the analysis only “ Wides ” and “No balls” should be taken
into account in the bowling analysis. “ Runs at fall of each wicket ” can
be easily ascertained by adding up the total scored, when the player goes
out, —at which period, also, the time of the fall of each wicket should be
registered.”


POSITION OP THE MEN TO EOUND-AEM SLOW
BOWLING (AS GILBEET OP SYDNEY).
It is necessary for this bowler, as well as others, to change their men
according to the style of the batsman’s play. The foregoing sketch will
enable the bowler to place his men when the game commences. After-
wards his own judgment must be used. The batsman may, perhaps, have
no idea of drawing a ball, but is a slashing hitter . You must then take the
draw man away, and place him in the long field. Again, another may hit
late at a leg ball ; if so, you must send your Square-leg man much sharper,
which is termed Long-Leg. If Long-slip is required, take the Third man
away, and not let your Short-slip remain so sharp. The positions in the
above sket.h are for a right-handed batsman.


POSITION OF THE MEN TO UNDEE-HAND SLOW
BOWLING (AS WILLS).
An under-hand slow bowler should be a very excellent judge of a man’s
style of play, or a great many runs would be got before his favourite hits
are found out. If free in hitting, and you have an efficient wicket-keeper,
take away your Long-stop and place him in the long-field, “on” or “off.”
Pick your men for point, long fields, and mid-wicket off, they being, to an
under-hand slow-bowler very useful men.


POSITION OF THE MEN TO FAST BOWLING
(AS BBYANT OB ELLIOTT).
Long-slip and Leg should assist each other in “backing up” the Long
top, to prevent byes.
