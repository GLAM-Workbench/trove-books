THE PBAIRIE
THRASHING MACHINE
Ilus machine is small, and of little weight, having the necessary strength, so that it may be
easily carried from place to x>lace, It requires fewer hands than any other kind, is extremely
simple, easily put to work, durable, and, while thrashing clean, does not injure the grain in any
way. Like the horse-works, all its parts are niade to standard images, and are so fitted that when
necessary , they may he renewed without the assistance of a mechanic. The power is convoyed from
the horse-works to an intermediate motion, and thence to the thrashing machine by a strap direct
If any accident occurs through carelessness or over-feeding, or from a stone or a horse-shoe being
fed in with the straw, the strap flies off the pulley, and everything stops. There is therefore less
liability to any breakage.
The horse-works are constructed so that they cannot be deranged by shrinking or swelling. 1
The spindles are wrought iron, turned true, and running in good brasses.
The intermediate motion will suit any small machines—such as chaffcutters, saw tables, &c,—
and are fitted with strong framing, turned wrought spindles, and brass bearings.
In making any statement of the quantity of work that a thrashing machine will perform it
must he borne in mind that it takes as much power to thrash bad yielding corn as good and that
if the straw is long or damp the crop cannot be thrashed out as fast as when short or dry Much,
also, depends bn the skill of the feeder: an expert man will keep the machine so supplied that the
straw comes out in an almost uniform stream, and the corn thoroughly separated ; an inexpert one
is apt to feed irregularly, alternately choking the machine and letting it run empty, which wastes
the power, and prevents the com from being thoroughly separated. With reaped wheat of good
quality, an average produce for a two horse machine may be stated at twenty bushels per hour.
Mr. Hicks, of Orange, says, in eight hours, with one pair of horses, I can thrash clean 240 bushels

A Certain Cure for all Diseases of the Liver and Stomach.
These Pills, carefully prepared from the Recipe of an eminent English Physician, are composed of
the purest and most expensive Vegetable Extracts, and are entirely free from all Mercurial prepara-
tions, which are so destructive to the system. They are coated with Sugar by a new and patent
method, by which they are rendered totally free from the nauseous taste which usually attend such
preparations.
As all the preparations used in their composition are purely Vegetable, not the slightest danger of
cold following their use need be apprehended.
Persons suffering from Liver Complaints, Constipation, Biliousness, Nervousness, Headache,
Indigestion, or Bile, will find certain and speedy relief from their use, and as a purifier of the Blood
they are invaluable. IN BOTTLES, Is., 25., and ss. EACH.

A Valuable Preparation for the Destruction of Worms in Children.
The great difficulty mothers invariably meet in administering nauseous Medicine to children, has
induced several to make such preparations as are agreeable, but at the same time effective; among
these the Cherry Worm Syrup will be found the most useful. On account of its sweetness it is easily
administered, it will relieve the restlessness caused by the Worms, entirely remove them from the
system, and give a healthy tone to the body. IN BOTTLES, Is. fid. BACH.
HOOD’S CORN SOLVENT,
Extensively used in Melbourne and all parts of Victoria. It possesses the extraordinary virtne of
totally dissolving the Com, without injuring the foot, and will effect a perfect cure in two or
three days.

NOTES ON SAXBY’S WEATHER
[ SYSTEM,
day after,
the day marked prove calm and still, distrust the
and especially the
second day after.
The changes vary in intensity, but even at quiet periods they may be plainly
traced in the scud flying with a velocity totally at variance with the state of
the air at the earth’s surface, and the clouds at such times generally have a
liny or stratified appearance, which usually indicates approaching rain.
In bringing the above to the test of experience, a few memoranda may prevent
./unintentional injustice towards the system.
1. Do not consider the prediction a failure if the weather prove moderate. The
above days are dates of chanye, not of necessity periods of bad weather.

NOTES ON SAXBY’S WEATHER SYSTEM (Continued.)
2. Watch for changes of wind at such times, and what sailors call its uneasiness
flying about from point to point with unsteadiness. ....
3. A characteristic of these lunar periods (when they prove quiet) is Jog and haz?,
very often setting in the day before or a few hours before the date given.
4 When the mercury falls for a day or two before a lunar day, expect its enecta
to last just about so long afterwards. The lunar period being the middle of the
time of disturbance.
5. The barometer is not always affected by those lunar periods—but there is a
tendency in the mercury to either change its direction up or down at such times, or
the apex of a curve projected by it will happen at such period.
6. The rising of the barometer on or after the ‘ second day after generally in-
dicates the return of fine weather.

STATISTICAL INFORMATION.
The Registrar-General's Report for the year 183 i, states that 30,286 names were
inscribed on the registers of the colony during that period ; 6960 persons married;
16,881 births were recorded; 6145 deaths, at all ages, were registered. The
marriages and births exceeded those of the preceding year by 166 and 1202 res-
pectively, while the mortality was 1 ss by 208 than that of 1863.
The estimated population at the middle of the past year was 383,893, calculated
upon the excess of births over deaths (9.834), and arrivals over departures seaward
(4869), shewing an increase on the year of 14,733 to the vital strength of the
colony. Upon this basis of population, the persons married were at the rate of
I‘Bo per cent., the births i'37 pu' cent., and the l'67 per cent.
MELBOURNE IN 1836.
The above, a correct representation of Melbourne 30 years ago, is from a sketch
taken by one of the first settlers, who still resides there. The Victorian capital
has progressed with a rapidity unequalled by any city of modern times. The three
hark huts of 1836 have disappeared, and their site is now occupied by a city con-
taining over 100,000 inhabitants, and possessed of public, mercantile, and other
buildings, bearing favorable comparison with any city of equal extent, in any part
of the world.

Aote. -Upon property in trust, or for religious or charitable purposes, no duty

as for a conveyance.
Exemptions from Duty.—Articles of clerkship or apprenticeship; mortgages, bills
of sale over chattel property; preferable liens or liens on crops; Customs
bonds and administration bonds. Also grants from the crown, and certifi-
cates of title from Registrar-General under Real Property Act.
Penalties.—The following particulars require careful attention in reference to the
use of the above-named instruments. Any person issuing or paying a bill of
exchange, promissory note, draft, or order, without a proper stamp, is liable
to a penalty of £5O. When an adhesive stamp is used for such an instru-
ment, or for a bill of lading, policy of insurance, or receipt, the person signing
or issuing the instrument must obliterate the stamp by writing his name or
initials thereon, under a penalty of £lO. The fraudulent removal or second
use of a stamp incurs a penalty of £2O. The holder of a foreign bill must,
under a penalty of £5O, affix the proper adhesive stamp to it before nego-
tiating it, and write his name on the stamp. For drawing bills payable out
of the colony, purporting to belong to sets, and not drawing the whole
number, the penalty is £lOO. The person who pays a bill, draft, or order,
must write “ paid ” on every stamp upon the instrument, or be liable to a
penalty of £2O.
The operation of the Stamp Duties Act is limited to three years and a half
namely, from Ist July, 1865, to 31st December, 1868.

able with the rate of one shilling under'this Act.

and gin), there shall be charged in addition to such duty twenty pounds for every
hundred pounds thereof, and in proportion for any lesser or greater amount of
such duty.

or a-t any time after such day of any article whereupon any additional duty shall
be payable under the provisions of this Act, shall be at liberty to add to the price
contracted for so much money as will be equivalent to the additional duty which
shall, by reason of such provisions, have been paid or made payable on such articles,
and shall be entitled by virtue of this Act to be paid the same accordingly by the
purchaser of such article, and to sue for and recover the same against such pur-
chaser. Provided that it shall be at the option of such purchaser, by notice in
writing under his hand, to be served on the other party to such contract within two

The following additions have been made to the descriptive flags already in use—
A red flag denotes a strange barque ; red, with blue cross, a Government barque ;
red and blue perpendicular, a private colonial barque; red and blue diagonal, a
foreign barque.
A conspicuous black conical signal, hoisted between the northern yard-arm and
mast-head of the northern staff at Fort Phillip, will in future be shewn to indicate
the expected approach of a southerly squall.
The place from which any vessel may arrive is signalled as soon as it can bo


ascertained, and before she enters the port; the entrance of the vessel into port is
denoted by the hanling down of the ball at the yard-arm, and her anchoring by
the lowering of the whole of the flags.
An emigrant ship is denoted by the numeral pendant hoisted above pilot’s report.
’ When troops are on board any vessel arriving, the numeral pendant is hoisted
without the pilot’s report.
When a vessel returns to port, the white numeral flag is hoisted alone, under
the descriptive flag.
At any time the Governor arrives, the Union Jack is hoisted above the descrip-
tive flag.
W hen the Mail steamer arrives at Adelaide, the P. and 0. Company’s flag is
hoisted at the semaphore mast head, and kept flying one hour ; when she arrives
at Melbourne, the same flag with a ball under it is kept flying the same time. .
When any vessel arrives with troops, the numeral pendant is hoisted under the
pilot’s report.
In order to distinguish steamers of the Peninsular and Oriental and Australian
Pioyal Mail Companys’ vessels from any other, a ball will be hoisted with the
signals at Fort Phillip. Whenever a ball is placed between the descriptive flag
and the numerals, it will denote that the vessel signalled is a mail steamer.
s*>Note. —The numbers on the flags may easily be known from their being com-
posed of as many stripes, or stars, as they are intended to represent. When any
number higher than nine is to be represented, one flag is hoisted over the other,
as 3 over 4is 34, from China ; the substitute flag being used as a duplicate—for
instance, No. 3 over the substitute flag would be 33, from Calcutta.

Brasses, Britannia Metals, Tins, Copper, Ac., are cleaned with a mixture
of rotten-stone, soft soap, and oil of turpentine, mixed to the consistency of stiff
putty. The stone should be powdered very fine and sifted ; and a quantity of the
mixture may be made, sufficient to last for a long while. The articles should first
be washed with hot water, to remove grease. Then a little of the above mixture,
mixed with water, should be rubbed over the metal; then rub off briskly with
dry clean rag or leather, and a beautiful polish will be obtained.
Agreeable Effervescent Drink for Heart-Burn, Ac. —Orange juice—(of
one orange) water and lump sugar to flavour, and in proportion to acidity of
orange bicarbonate of soda about half a tea-spoonful. Mix orange juice, water, and
sugar together in a tumbler, then put in the soda, stir, and the effervescence ensue*.

Sweetening Casks.—Half a pint of vitriol mixed with a quart of water, aud
the mixture poured into the barrel, and roll about; next day add one pound of
chalk, aud roil again. Bung down for three or four days, then rinse well with hot
water.
Curing Hams and Bacon.—lt is simply to use the same quantity of com
mon soda as saltpetre—one ounce and a half of each to the fourteen pounds of ham
or bacon, using the usual quantity of salt. The soda prevents that hardness in
the lean of the bacon which is often found, and keeps it quite mellow all through,
besides being a preventive of reast. This receipt has been very extensively tried
amongst my acquaintance for the last fifteen years, and invariably approved.

Appetite.— Appetite is frequently lost through excessive use of stimulants,
food too hot, sedentary occupation, costiveness, liver disorder, and want of change
of air. The iirst endeavour should be to ascertain and remove the cause. Change
of diet, and change of air, will frequently be found more benelicial than medicines.
Bad Butter may be improved greatly by dissolving it thoroughly in hot water ;
let it cool, then skim it off, and churn again, adding a little good salt and sugar,
A small quantity can be tried and approved before doing a larger one. The water
should be merely hot enough to melt the butter, or it will become oily.

GARDENING.
[We are indebted to Messrs. Law, Somnkr, and Co., for permission to extract
the following from their “ Handbook to the Garden.”]
JAHUAET.
Kitchen Garden.- —When this month proves hot and dry, very little sowing
or transplanting can be done excepting where facilities for irrigation exist. In
private gardens, a succession of crops may be raised by a liberal and judicious use
of the water-pot. On the occurrence of suitable weather, or with an artificial
supply of moisture, the following may be sown successfully, viz., paas, early kinds;
kidney beans, of the earlier varieties ; lettuce, in drills where intended to stand ;
a few early-horn carrots; onions, for salads ; celery, a good sowing; turnips, both
white and yellow; and round spinach, in small quantity. Seed of quick-heading
sorts of cabbage and cauliflower may be sown to provide for autumn planting. A.
few marrows may be sown for late use. Thin former sowings of spinach, carrots,
turnips, and lettuce ; and in doing this, single them out at once to the full distance
at which the plants are intended to stand. Plant out cabbages and cauliflowers,
choosing none but strong plants. Celery may be planted in trenches if water be
available, care being taken to leave as much earth as possible about the roots.
Tomatoes and capsicums, if any still remain in pots, may be planted out early in the
month. Cucumbers, melons, marrows, pumpkins, &c., will need attention in
thinning out the shoots, stopping, and watering. Plant early varieties of potatoes.
Fruit Garden. —For disbudding with the finger and thumb, the season is
almost too far advanced, but a partial thinning of superfluous shoots may be given
with the pruning knife to peach trees and to some varieties of plums. Apricots,
when inclined to throw long naked shoots, should be stopped. The British Queen
Strawberry may be kept in bearing by copious waterings during dry weather, and
by mulching the bed with spent tan. This is a fine flavoured and prolific variety,
and can be obtained in quantity in the colony. Budding may be proceeded with
when the shoots are in proper condition, which is when the bark separates freely
from the wood. In dry weather a heavy soaking for a night or two previously
will put them in order, and mulching will serve to keep them so. Prepare com-
post for planting and dressing fruit trees. All fruit trees maybe budded now, in-
including oranges, lemons, shaddocks, &c.
Flower Garden. —The dryness of the weather usually prevents the sowing of
flower seeds. As a fine autumn show' is desirable, weather permitting, vacant
spaces should be sown with annuals, or planted w r ith such as have been raised in
beds in shady places. Roses may be budded, regard being had to the sorts wdiich
do best when budded, for some kinds succeed best when thus grown, and others
upon their own roots. Dahlias, chrysanthemums, phloxes, and all tall-growing
plants should be carefully staked and tied. Finish taking up bulbs that may
r q lire to be parted, but every other year is often enough if the bulbs were pro-
perly planted in the first instance. Pot plants will require shading during the
heat of the day, and water morning and evening.
FEBRUARY.
Kitchen Garden. —On the occurrence of moist weather, the ground, it is pre-
sumed, having been previously well prepared, the following may be sown largely,
viz., cabbages, cauliflower, lettuce, spinach, turnips, and swedes. On a limited
scale, sow early-horn carrots, onions, spinach, and peas of early varieties. Plant
out largely of cauliflowers and cabbages. Sow brocoli, Brussel’s sprouts, and
other winter greens. A few kidney beans may be sown upon chance for a late
crop. If the ground be too dry to sow or plant, all spare time should be employed
in preparing land for future crops. Plant out celery in trenches. Radishes and


■small salads may be sown as required at any time if a supply of water be at com-
mand ; little, however, can be done in that way during the hottest season of the
year. Leeks may now be planted out.
Fruit Garden. — The work of this department consists chiefly of gathering and
storing fruits, many of which are ripe at this season. Budding fruit trees generally,
and the orange tribe, as directed for last month, may be continued. Look over
the early budded plants, and let those that have failed be worked again. Prepare
ground for planting
Flower Garden. —Take advantage of moist weather to sow hardy annuals.
By this we do not mean such only as are usually termed hardy, but all except the
very tenderest. By sowing early in autumn, most annuals get strong enough
before winter to stand well, and give the flnest bloom in spring. Those who wait
until August or September to sow rarely see them in perfection. Dry lying ground
should be chosen for annuals at this season. Stake and tie dahlias, chrysanthe-
mums, and other tall growers, and, if needed, supply them with water or liquid
manure. Continue to bud roses, perpetuals, hybrid chinas, noisettes or bourbons,
which were budded early and have become firmly set, may be headed back to a
joint beyond the bud ; they will then make a fine autumn growth. Prune back
slightly the autumn-blooming kinds, and give them a good soaking of liquid
manure. Cut back fuchsias to within one or two eyes of the stem as they cease
flowering. If the weather be dry, a little liquid manure will be of service to
chrysanthemums. If the weather be dry, gladioli, tigridias, and liliums will need
watering occasionally ; gladioli should also be staked. It is now time to make an
early planting of bulbs, such as anemone, ranunculus, crocus, tulip, hyacinth,
narcissus, iris, sparaxis, ixia, watsonia, tritouia, and the spring blooming kinds
of gladiolus.
MAECH.
Kitchen Garden. —Most of the hardy vegetables may be sown this month to a
considerable extent. Turnips, both white and yellow, peas, of early varieties,
broad beans, and spinach, lettuce, cabbage and cauliflower; carrots of the early-
horn variety, onions, and red beet, in limited quantity for use. As soon as large
enough plant out cabbage and cauliflower, also a full crop of celery, and draw a
little earth to any former plantings that may be large enough. Thin advancing
erops of spinach, lettuce, onions, turnips, &c. Radishes and small salads will
now do well. Plant out any leeks that may remain in the seed bed. Those who
wish to grow water cress may plant them in a trench, in the bottom of which a
layer of thoroughly rotten dung should be placed. A little water until they have
fairly rooted is indispensable, after which they will produce very well through the
winter by the aid of casual showers. Either seed or cuttings may be used in
forming the bed.
Fruit Garden. —Now is .the best time to make strawberry plantations, using
for the purpose runners of the present season. Prepare for planting fruit trees by
trenching the land. Trees always succeed better on land that has been worked a
couple of months previously than upon newly turned soil; and, we may add, there
is always work enough to be done at the planting season without having also that
• of trenching to perform.
Flower Garden.— The first work of the month should be bulb planting. The
kinds suitable for planting are those mentioned in the last month’s calendar, to
which, therefore, we refer. A few hyacinths and early varieties of tulips, of
which the double kinds are best, may be planted in pots, for indoor decoration
when in bloom. The soil for pots should be tolerably rich and have a fair admix-
ture of sand; there should also be plenty of drainage. If the weather prove
moist, evergreens of many kinds may be planted more advantageously than later
in the season, to which end trenching and otherwise preparing the land should be
proceeded with as above recommended. Sow annuals as directed in the February
calendar. Plant cuttings of pinks, carnations, and the hybrid varieties of dianthus.
Propagate pansies, sweet-williams, and other perennial plants by divisions or by
cuttings. Towards the end of the month rose cuttings may be planted. Summer
Blooming bulbs may be taken up and stored as soon as the foliage turns yellow.


Now is the time to plant the tuberous kinds of Tropoeolum. Chrysanthemums,
see last month.
APRIL.
Kitchen Garden. —Sow peas of early varieties, broad beans, spinach, parsnip,
carrot, and radishes ; sow and transplant largely of lettuce, cabbage, cauliflower,
and brocoli. Plant rhubarb and seakale in ground deeply trenched and well
manured. Earth up celery, and make a further planting. Turnips may be sown
largely, and former sowings be singled out to suitable distances. It is now time
to plant potato-onions, garlick, and shallots. Earth up advancing crops of
potatos, and let late crops of peas be staked, as they do not pod well in w inter
when trailing on the ground. Keep down slugs among cabbage and cauliflower.
Fruit Garden. — The work of trenching and digging is the chief work of this
department; draining also should be attended to where requisite. The gathering
and storing of late fruit should now be completed at once. Begin planting goose-
berries, currants, raspberries, almonds, plums; anything, in fact, which has gone
to rest, which may be known by their having shed their leaves. The date of this
occurrence varies greatly, according to the character of the season. Strawberries
may still be planted, or indeed at any time during autumn and winter. This is
the best month for planting out the orange tribe, provided the weather be favour-
able. Fruit pips and stones should now be sown for raising stocks.
Flower Garden. —Pot plants are the proper kind of stock with which to
commence the season’s planting, and next, a great variety of evergreens. Tie up
chrysanthemums and secure against winds. The division of perennials recom-
mended last month may still be carried out. Boses and rose-cuttings may be
planted, and when pot culture is intended, now r is a very good season to begin.
Bemove all suckers from the root and stem of budded roses. Sow a few hardy
annuals and perennials, especially stocks and wallflowers on vacant spots, or plant
out a few from the seed beds. Carnations, &c., may still be piped or struck from
•cuttings ;itis a certain mode of propagation and far better than layering. Make
a further planting of bulbs. Pot hyacinths in good rich soil in six inch pots. As
rain may be expected this month look well to drains.
Kitchen Garden.— To get early peas and beans, May is the best month for
sowing. At first sow the earlier varieties of peas, but towards the close of the
month, some of the finer kinds, such as climax, will do well. Sow moderately of
quick-heading kinds of cabbage and cauliflower, and plant out further from the
seed beds ; but be sure that the plants are young and in free growth, for old plants
will be very liable to run when they ought to head. A fe-w brocoli may be planted;
also spinach, radish, and lettuce. Onions may be sown for transplanting or for
use green. Plant garlick, shallots, and potato-onions Clear the haulm off
asparagus, rhubarb, and sea-kale beds, and make new beds of the two last. Apply
a good dressing of manure to the old beds, and to asparagus a dressing of salt in
addition. Perennial herbs may be divided and replanted. Prepare a hot-bed
on which to raise cucumbers and melons. Commence to force rhubarb, asparagus,
and sea-kale, for which hot dung, duly prepared, will be required. Continue to
transplant celery. Clear away all decayed plants, weeds, and other rubbish.
Fruit Garden. —The work of planting and preparing land will be the same as
for last month, except that planting should now proceed in earnest. Oranges,
lemons, and this tribe in general, if planted this month, should be w ell protected
from prevailing winds. Pruning may commence on trees that have fully shed their
leaves, but to prune them before that has happened would be highly injurious.
Flower-Garden.— The planting of ornamental shrubs and trees may proceed,
remembering that early planted ones have by far the best chance of succeeding.
Alteration in the plan of grounds, or the work of laying out new ones, should be
completed forthwith. Continue last month’s work amongst roses. Dahlias may
be lifted and stored. Annuals may be sown, care being taken that the ground
•does not w r ant for drainage. Chrysanthemums being now in full bloom, advantage
should be taken to mark the colours, with a view to proper regulations, where this


desirable object has been previously neglected. Bulbs may be planted, and very
late ones lifted. The directions for the last two months are equally applicable to
the present one. Tropceolums, tricolor , Jarrattii, &c., may now be planted.
JUNE.
Kitchen Garden. —Sow largely of peas, both early and late varieties. Broad
beans also may be sown largely. Sow cabbage and cauliflower; also plant out.
Sow Brussels sprouts, carrots, and spinach. Plant out lettuce, and sow again.
Earth up celery. Thin onions and transplant. Turnips may be sown, but not to
any great extent, for the success of this crop will depend upon the character of
th», season. When forced sea-kale and rhubarb are required, the plants must be
covered with pots or boxes, and over and around these a bed of hot dung, pre-
pared as for a hot bed. Those who wish to grow early cucumbers and melons
should now sow them on a hot-bed. A one-light frame will serve to raise the seed
in pots, and whilst the plants are getting ready the permanent bed must be pre-
pared. Make a hot-bed towards the end of the month, on which to sow capsicums,
tomatoes, and tender herbs early in July. Prepare ground and plant asparagus.
Fruit Garden. —Where the cuttings from vines intended to be planted,,
let them be gathered up on the day they are cut, and be laid in the ground in
rows ; let each sort also be kept separate, and carefully labelled. All kinds of
fruit trees may be planted, and new strawberry beds made, but these will not
bear the first season as good a crop as will the earlier planted ones. Pruning
should be prosecuted with vigour.
Flower Garden.— Transplanting is still the chief work of this department,
and whilst this is extensively proceeding it is a difficult matter to keep the garden
perfectly neat, still this point should never be lost sight of altogether. Grass plots
may now be made, and edgings and hedges planted. Plant out annuals and
biennials from the seed beds ; prime and plant cuttings of roses early in the
month, and attend to last month’s directions generally. Bulbs may still be
planted, but the Dutch kinds, which are natives of a cool climate, should be
planted at once.
JULY.
Kitchen Garden. —lf the season promises to be early and dry, the sowing of
main crops of carrots, parsnips, scorzonera, salsify, beet, onions, and leeks, should
be proceeded with earlier than would otherwise be advisable. If sown too early,
and the season prove a growing one, these crops are very liable to run to seed ;
from the end of this month, therefore, to the middle of next, is generally regarded
as the safest time. This, however, will be modified by local conditions, snch as
soil, exposure, &c. Carrots, onions, and leeks, may, at any rate, be sown to a
moderate extent early in the month. Former sowings of onions, thin and trans-
plant. Sow small salading. Peas and broad beans may be sown to any extent;
advancing crops may be earthed up a little. A few potatos of early varieties
may be planted on a piece of well-worked dry-lying ground ; and the new dung-
heap may be utilized by covering with soil and planting upon it some early potatos.
Cabbage, cauliflower, and lettuce may be sown and transplanted as required.
Spinach may be sown, and former sowings may be thinned ; sow parsley and
other herbs, and divide the perennial kinds if more plants are needed. Any
garlick, shallots, or potato-onions still out of ground should be planted at once.
Attend to forcing of sea-kale, asparagus, and rhubarb, as recommended last
month. New beds may also be made; old ones should be forked lightly over,
and put in order for the growing season. Sustain the heat of cucumber beds by
occasional linings of hot dung. Sow capsicums, chillies, and other peppers,
tomatoes, and tender herbs on a gentle hot-bed. Globe artichokes may be planted,
and old beds be dug over. Jerusalem artichokes may also be planted at convenience.
Fruit Garden. — Continue and finish pruning generally, taking the kinds in
the order of their earliness. Trim off the dead leaves of strawberries, and fork
over the beds, giving at the same time a light dressing of well-rotted dung, if th«
soil stands in need of it. All kinds of fruit trees may be planted, but this wood
bave been better done earlier. Grafting may also now be done.


I 1 I'Owek Garden. —Prune and plant roses ; if a succession of bloom be required,
prune at various times, say, first one-fourth, and ten days later another batch,
•and so on ; they will thus bloom in succession. A few tender annuals may be
sown on a hot-bed for future transplanting, and hardy ones to be sown as required
in the open ground. Phloxes, chrysanthemums, hollyhocks, and many other
perennials may be divided. Shrubs of various kinds may be transplanted. Some
■of the late kinds of Cape bulbs, such as amaryllis and alstroemeria, should now be
planted, ami a few of the choice kinds of gladioli, the bulk of these last being
retained until later in the season.
AUGUST.
Kitchen Garden.— Complete the sowing of main crops in the following order:
leeks, carrots, parsnips, salsify, scorzonera, and beet (both red and
silver.) Sow largely of peas and broad beans, but more sparingly than before.
Still sow and transplant cabbages and cauliflower. Plant the principal crop of
potatos as soon as possible. Sow spinach, lettuce, radishes, and salads generally.
Carry out last month’s directions with regard to asparagus. Rhubarb ami sea-kale
may be forced by simply covering with dung. Forward potatos should be earthed
up as they grow, and a few fern branches stuck over them will help to protect
■them from frost. On a warm border, and in early situations, a few vegetable
-marrows and dwarf French beans may be sown on tiie chance of an early crop.
Cucumbers on hot-beds must be kept growing by a liberal supply of bottom heat.
More may be sown in pots for planting out. Sweet potatos may be started into
growth upon a hot-bed. Sow also capsicums and tomatoes in heat, and a few of
the latter on a warm border.
Fruit Garden.— This is a very favourable month for planting the orange tribe,
and the planting of other fruit trees should not be delayed ; indeed, in a forward
season it is now almost too late for early peaches, almonds, &c. Strawberries and
raspberries may still be planted, as also vines and viue-cuttimrs. Oranges may-
be grafted ; the grafting of apples and pears should be brought to a close°early in
the mouth.
Fx.owkr Garden. —Seeds of all kinds may now be sown, the tenderest kinds,
such as balsams and cockscombs, on a hot-bed, or towards the end of the month
a few may be tried in the open ground. Thin and transplant annuals and biennials.
Dahlias may be planted, but reserve some for November, in order to insure a fine
autumn bloom. Propagate fuchsias, heliotropes, and other soft-wooded plants as
required. Roses may still be planted as directed last month ; also early ami late
•blooming varieties of Cape bulbs, including tigridias. Divide and transplant
phloxes, &c., and sow the annual kinds. Plants in pots Mull now require a good
deal of attention ; they must be shifted into larger pots as they grow, and water-
ing must be closely looked after. Azaleas and rhododendrons in pots should receive
-now and then a little weak guano water when coming into bloom. Japan lilies
may be planted. Digging and cleaning in all departments should be brought to a
close.
SEPTEMBER.
Kitchen Garden. — If the sowing of main crops be not completed, it sh old
take precedence of all other work. Onions, leeks, carrots, parsnips, beet, surd
other roots, are the kinds to which we allude. Potato planting also should I**
finished early in the mouth. Peas, sow largely ; broad beans may still be fried.
The main crop of kidney beans may be sown this month. Lettuce should l>e sown
where they are intended to stand, as the weather may not be suitable for trans-
planting. The forcing of rhubarb and asparagus may be discontinued, but sea-kale
must be attended to as before directed. Plant Jerusalem artichokes if not alre dy
done. Cabbages may still be sown and planted out largely ; cauliflowers also may-
be planted, but sowing should be done upon a limited scale, as they do not succeed
•well during summer. Turnips may he sown now, but as they will have to be
user! as soon as ready the area should be proportionate to demand. Asparagus
beds, if not already put in order, should be done at once, as the shoots begin to
show early in the month. A light sprinkling of salt and guano during showery


•weather would prove beneficial. Clear away the dung that has been used in
forcing rhubarb and sea-kale, excepting sufficient to dig in, which should be clone
at once. Sow and plant out capsicums, chillies, tomatoes ; sow also vegetable
marrows, cucumbers, melons, pumpkins, gourds, and squashes, being guided as to
date by the appearance of the weather. Protection at night may be required for
the tenderest of these. Cucumbers on hot-beds may be more freely supplied -w ith
air as the season advances. Leeks may be planted out; and now is the time to
sow sugar maize.
Fruit Garden. —No deciduous trees can safely be planted unless the season
be backward, but loquats, oranges, lemons, shaddocks, citrons, and guavas, may
be, and will succeed better than when planted during winter. Newly-planted
trees may need watering should the season prove dry, and the evergreen kinds
above mentioned would be the better for protection from wind, such as a hour
barrel without top or bottom would afford. All newly planted trees should be
securely staked if not already done. Oranges and lemons may now be grafte
Head down trees budded last season. When vines have begun to grow freely,
i.e., when the first leaf or two on each shoot are fully developed, they may be
grafted if required, the scions for the purpose having been kept back by being
plunged in a border on the south side of the house. Underground grafting is the
best, and usually the most successful. Be particularly careful to destroy weeds
amongst vines at this season, the damage from spring frosts being always greatest
when weeds are present.
Flower Garden.— Shrubs and flowering plants may be planted out of pots
with every prospect of success, choosing fine settled weather for those that have
been kept under glass. Plant out the rooted cuttings of carnations, pinks, and
hybrid dianthus. Sow balsams, cockscombs, phloxes, thunbergias, petunias, and
all kinds of annuals, both hardy and tender. Thin and transplant former sowings.
Dahlias may be planted ; and let the planting of roses be finished. Plant bulbs,
such as gladiolus, amaryllis, tuberoses, tigridias, Japan lilies, &c. Let climbing
plants be trained as they grow. The present is a good time to plant tritoma
uvaria, perennial phloxes, and other perennials. Loosen the soil either with fork
or hoe, which will not only benefit the plants, but add to the neat appearance of
the garden. Keep down weeds.
OCTOBER.
Kitchen Garden. —If the season has become dry, little can be done in sowing
or planting; otherwise, the following may be sownonions, leeks, carrots,
parsnips, beet, salsify, peas, kidney beans, lettuce, spinach, turnips, and radishes,
the remarks in the preceding month being still applicable. Sow and transplant
cabbages largely, for summer crop. Sow the clasp-knife and other climbing beans ;
afford sufficient room for stakes or other support. Plant potatos and earth up
the forward crops. All the above work should have been previously done unless
the weather was unfavourable. Early thinning of root crops is essential; this
and hoeing being the principal work of the month. Sow and plant out marrows,
squashes, gourds, pumpkins, cucumbers, melons, the varieties of peppers, and
tomatoes. Celery may be sown largely and planted out as convenience for water*
ing may dictate. Rhubarb will be improved by liquid manuring. Sugar maize
may still be sown.
Fruit Garden. —The chief work of the month should be thinning fruit and
disbudding or rubbing off with the finger and thumb the superfluous and misplaced
shoots, chiefly of peach trees, but of other trees also would time permit of it.
Vine shoots also will need thinning to the permanent number when danger of
frost has passed away. The shoots should be tied to prevent damage from wind
as soon as they are long enough to reach the stake or trellis. Strawberries should
now be mulched with tan or short grass, or straw, which is better. Continue to
plant out from pots well established oranges and other evergreen fruits, using the
precautions suggested last month.
Flower Garden. —lf the weather of the previous month has been unfavour-
able, the work of sowing tender annuals will still remain to be done. The chief
work, however, will be attention to newly-planted stock, in watering, staking, and


tying. The same kinds of bulbs and tubers may be planted as last month. Rosea,
may need syringing for the green fly, and picking for the leaf-rolling caterpillars •
newly planted ones will require w'ater should the weather prove dry and all
suckers removed as they appear. Cinerarias and calceolarias will require shading
when the sun becomes too bright. Geraniums, fuchsias, and all pot plants will
require a free use of the syringe to keep down red spider and maintain a healthy
growth. J
NOVEMBER.
Kitchen Garde^.— The raising of seeds, if the weather proves dry, demands a
little ingenuity on the part of the gardener. Few need be sown this month. All
the cucumber tribe will require special attention in stopping, watering, &c. ; they
may still be sown, but melons sown now will hardly ripen in ordinary seasons.
Tomatoes and peppers of sorts may still be sown and planted ; thin and stop the
shoots of tomatoes occasionally, and let the plants be supported off the ground, or
the .w’uit will be damaged. A few' peas may be sown in low moist situations, also
kidney beans. Sow largely of Brussels sprouts, savoys, brocoli, cabbages, and
cauliflowers, the two last towards the end of the month. Lettuces may be sown
as the weather suits, and the same may be said of spinach, radishes, and small
salads. Sow largely of celery, and plant out former sowings. Towards the close
of the month the cutting of asparagus should cease ; let the beds be weeded, and
receive a dressing of salt. If weather suits, potatoes may be planted, c;.Trots and
red beet sown. Sugar maize may still be sown. This crop will come in when
much w'anted. Rhubarb will require a good supply of liquid manure. Clear
away old crops as they become exhausted. Attend to neatness and cleanliness.
Fruit Garden.— For mulching strawberries, nothing is better than tan, short
grass, or straw; this should have been done last mouth, or even earlier. In the
absence of these hay bands may be used to keep the berries from coming into
contact with the ground. Remove all runners except those required for furnishing
plants for new plantations. Disbudding may still be practised on fruit trees ; the
thinning of fruit should be finished early in the month. Vines will need a great
deal of work in thinning, tying, and stopping the shoots, weeding, &c. In trelised
vines the upper or stronger shoots should be stopped first, and subsequently the
others.
Flower Garden. —Early bulbs, whose tops have become yellow, may be taken
up and stored, or else their position in the ground should be marked by a tally, so
as to prevent disturbing them in digging the beds. Plant out the rest of the
dahlias, as well as the gladioli, tigridias, and other bulbs that have been kept for
late autumn blooming. Vacant spaces may be filled by sowing or transplanting
annuals. Roses may now be budded when it is desired to have more plants of
certain sorts. Hybrid perpetuals that have done blooming for the present may be
cut back a little, but unless bloom be urgently required it will be better not to
force them into grow r th by watering at this season. Azaleas and camelias that
have set their flower buds may be plunged in a cool sheltered border, where they
must not however be neglected as regards water. Plant out chrysanthemums, and
thin out the shoots of established plants. Mow lawns, and keep verges, walks,
and gutters clean.
DECEMBER.
Kitchen Garden. —lf the sowing of the cabbage tribe directed last month has
not been done, it should at once be attended to. As the weather suits, sow peas
and spinach. A few French beans and marrows may be sown for the late autumn
crop. Let the ground between root crops be kept well stirred and free from weeds.
Swedish turnips may be sown, or the Aberdeen yellow. Cucumbers and melons,
may still be planted out of pots at the beginning of the month, and the tribe
generally will require stopping, thinning, and watering with liquid manure. Celery
may be planted out, and more may be sown. Early planted crops may be earthed
up as the}' require it, a little at a time. Keep weeds down, and on no account
allow the seed to ripen, as one year’s seed gives seven years weeding.
Fruit Garden. —Vines will now demand the chief share of attention ; the
thinning both of sin ots and bunches may 1 e fully proceeded with. Top them and


secure them to stakes or trellises. Peaches, plums, apricots, ar.d fruit trees
generally may be budded at any time during th s month or the next. Strawberries
will require a thorough soaking twice a week during dry weather, and this will
sustain them in bearing, if of the right sort. The British Queen is an excellent
late bearer. Look carefully over orange trees for the caterpillar of the emperor
butterfly.
Flower Garden.— lf anything in the way of bulbs, dahlias, &c., remain
implanted, let them have precedence of everything else. Continue to lift bulbs as
they ripen, or else mark them as previously directed. Roses may be budded
whenever the stocks may be in proper order, which may be known by the bark,
separating easily from the wood. Carnations, picotees, &c., should be propagated
by layers and pipings. Let dahlias, hollyhocks, chrysanthemums, phloxes, and
all tall growing plants be neatly staked as they throw up their flower stalks. Pot
plants will require much attention in syringing, watering, shading, &c., and all
pots out of doors should be plunged in sand, tan, or in the soil; in either case they
should be turned round once a week to prevent their rooting through the bottom
of the pot. Mow, hoe, rake, and let cleanliness be the order of the day.

MES33IO-A.L CARD.
DR. VAN HEEKEREN,
Consulting Physician and Surgeon,
A Graduate and duly qualified Member of the Royal Medico-chirurgical
Academy of Bonn (Prussia), formerly of the Hospitals of Paris, Vienna,
Prague, and Berlin, Member of the University, and late Surgeon to the
Belle Yue Hospital, New York,
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
Respectfully informs the inhabitants of Sydney and suburbs that he is daily
to be consulted “confidentially” on all diseases.
All Nervous Disorders or Prostration of the System, Nervous and
Physical Debility, Skin Diseases of all kinds, stricture, Yenereal Affec-
tions, and all neglected Complaints, and those arising from exposure, im-
prudence, or excesses in youth, are cured radically in both sexes.
Dr. Yan Heekeren’s great experience in the Hospitals of Paris,
especially at the Lourcine, and at the Hospital du Midi (des Yeneriens)
where he was intern and disciple of the great Philippe Ricord, and his
long practice in the United States of America give him the guarantee
of great success also in these colonies.
The victims of misplaced confidence in quacks, or unprincipled
medical pretenders, can call with a certainty of being cured in the short-
est possible time.
All cases given up in hospitals or by other physicians as incurable,
will be attended to with the utmost care.
Dr. Yan Heekeren would remind all those of either Sex, who are
suffering from diseases of a delicate nature, which require particular
skill and professional knowledge, that they can apply either personally
or by lettter to him, with a certainty of restoration to health and vigor.
Medicine sent to any part, however distant, packed safe and secure
from observation.
N.B.—Those suffering from the effects of self abuse,
by consulting Dr. Van Heekeren can, under his treat-
ment, renovate both mind and strength.
