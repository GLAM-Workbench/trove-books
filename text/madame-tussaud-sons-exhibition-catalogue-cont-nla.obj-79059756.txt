Restorer, in being composed of harmless elements,

fading hair, re-establishing the vital forces, giving

brightness of colour. The ORIENTAL TOOTH PASTE gives a peculiar sweetness to the breath, and, if used regularity,
will preserve the teeth and gums in a sound and ornamental state to old age. Sold in Pots at is. 6d., or Double Size, 2s. fid.

TYPHUS, SCARLET and other FEVERS, SMALL-POX, MEASLES, and ERUPTIVE or SKIN
COMPLAINTS, and various other altered conditions of the blood.
Dr. ALEX. MILNE. —“In searching for the best
combination of Salines we alighted on that * Lamp -
lough. Its utility as a REMEDY IN FEVERS and as
a cooling drink in diseases of children, such as Scarlet
Fbvbr, Measles, &c., has been testified to by the leading
members of the profession. ,, “ I prescribe it to my
natients frequently.”—May 19, 1880.
Dr. SPARKS (Government Medical Inspector of
Emigrants from the Port of London) writes : —“ I have
great pleasure in bearing my cordial testimony to its
efficacy in the treatment of many of the ordinary and
chronic forms of Gastric Complaints and other forms of
Febrile Dyspepsia.”
CAUTION. Beware of Spurious Salines and Effervescing Salts containing injurious elements put

CATALOGUE.
MADAME TXTSSAXJD, the foundress of the Exhibition, was bom at Berne,
Switzerland, in 1760. Being left an orphan at a very early age, she was sent to Para
and placed under the care of her uncle, M. Curtius, an eminent artist of the pcnod
(artist to Louis XVI.), from whom she learnt the art ol modelling in wax. Madame
Elizabeth, sister to the king, engaged her to instruct her in modelling, and she resided
with this amiable but unfortunate Princess at the Tuileries and at Versailles until 1789.
Here she became acquainted with the leading personages of the Court of Louis XVI.
and Marie Antoinette. Deprived of her position by the Revolution, she left i ranee
and established herself in London, where her collection of figures attracted great atten-
tion. She exhibited them in all the principal cities of the United Kingdom, and
ultimately in Baker-street, where the exhibition, justly considered one of the “ * l g“ ts
of London, remains to this day, after a lapse of over half a Madame
Tussaud’s Memoirs have been frequently published, and the Morning Post, December,
1881, in a long article on the subject, pronounced them to be “ a most valuable contri-
bution to the history of the French Revolution.” The best specimen of Madame
Tussaud’s art in this collection is decidedly the figure of Voltaire, modelled by her from
life. Died April 15, 1850, at the great age of 90.
1. CHARLES DICKENS, the most popular humourist and novelist of our
age, was born at Landport, near Portsmouth, February 7, 1812. He embraced the
journalistic career as a reporter on The True Sun , and the Momtnsr Chronicle. His
novels are masterpieces of English literature. He died at Gad’s Hill, June 9, 1870,
and is buried in Westminster Abbey, in Poets’ Corner, within a few steps of Chaucer s
grave. 44 His name is as familiar in our mouths as household words.” His works are a
living monument to his memory.
ROOM OPPOSITE THE ENTRANCE.
2. KING HUMBERT OF ITALY. Bom, March 14, 1844; married, April
22, 1868, Princess Marguerite of Savoy. Succeeded his father in 1878. The Queen of
Italy is considered the most beautiful sovereign in Europe. Their Majesties have
only one son, the Prince of Naples.
3. THE LATE VICTOR EMMANUEL, the first King ot United Italy
(in the full uniform of a General, taken in 1856), was the son of Charles Albert,
King of Sardinia, and of the Princess Theresa of Tuscany. He married, in 1842,
the Archduchess Adelaide of Austria. His father abdicated in his favour at the
Battle of Novara, in 1849, and he resisted the pressure of Austria to repudiate
Constitutional Government in his kingdom. He joined France and England in the
Russian War in 1855, and his troops did good service in the Battle of Tchernaya.
His dominions were attacked bv Austria in 1859, but the Emperor of the French
hastened to his assistance. In the Battles of Magenta and Solferino the Austrians
were totally defeated, and Victor Emmanuel was established King of Italy by the
treaties of Villafranca and Zurich, and took up his residence in Rome, December
31, 1870. Bom, March 14, 1820; died, January 9, 1878.
4 GARIBALDI was a native of Nice, where he was bom in 1807. At an
early age he embraced a seafaring life, and displayed considerable bravery during the
South American Revolutions; on the French entering Italy he raised a considerable
force, and harassed the Austrians during their retreat before the French. He took
Naples in xB6o. To him and to the Emperor of the French the Italians are mainly
indebted for the consolidation of their kingdom. When, in the course of the war in
1870 (between Germany and France), the latter country became a Republic, Garibaldi
placed his sword at its disposal. He visited London in 1864, and was most enthusiast! -
cally received. During the latter part of his life he lived in retirement at Caprera, a small
island in the Mediterranean, where he died June 2, 1882. Taken from life in 1861,
after his triumphal entry into Naples on the unification of Italy. [There are also on
view some interesting relics of the General, the gift of Dr. McGrigor Croft, late Staff-
Surgeon of H.M. Army.]


5. THE LYING IN STATE OF HIS LATE HOLINESS PIUS IX.
His Holiness Pius IX., the descendant of a noble family, was bom at Simgaglxa, in the
Romagna, May 13, 1792. After receiving an education suitable to his high rank, he
entered the Noble Guard, but soon after left it to embrace the ecclesiastical career, of
which he became one of the brightest ornaments. This representation of the scene
at St. Peter’s is as nearly as possible a facsimile. The Swiss Guards on each side are
habited in their usual uniforms originally designed by Michael Angelo.
6. LEO XIII., the present Pontiff, and 257 th successor of St. Peter, is the son
of Count Ludovico Pecci, by his wife Anna Prosperi. Bom at Carpineto, in the diocese
of Anagni, in the States of the Church, March 2, 1810, he entered the Jesuits’ College
of Viterbo, 1818, and after a most distinguished career was nominated a Cardinal,
December 19, 1853, and at the death of the late Pope, February 7, 1878, was elected to
the Papal See. His Holiness is one of the most learned men of our time. His printed
works upon Theology, History, Art, and Science, fill over thirty volumes.
7. FIGURE dressed in the garb of the Misericordia Society. This costume
is assumed by members of the Society when engaged in the performance of works of
charity, or the burying of the dead, so as to render their identification impossible.
8. HIS EMINENCE CARDINAL GIACOMO ANTONELLL late
Secretary of State to Pope Pius IX. Bom of the respectable middle class at
Sonnino, April 2, 1806. He entered the Church, and was employed in several ways
by Pope Gregory XVI. He was made a Cardinal Deacon by the late Pontiff,
in June, 1847. He held the offices of Secretary of State to the Pope, President
of the Council of Ministers, Prefect of the Sacred Apostolic Palaces, of the Sacred
Congregation of the Loretto, and of the Consulta, &c. Died November 6, 1876.

Nawab is justly renowned for his military abilities; These men were officered by their
feudal chief, the Nawab, and did excellent service under Major-General Careton. They
were in conflict with the enemy upon 158 occasions, 'and their conduct at Bareilly highly
extolled; the Nawab has been on the Commander-in-chiefs staff, was appointed one of

opened out the great resources of that country by military roads and canals. In the
great Indian Mutiny he was at the right hand of Sir Colin Campbell as Chief Engineer,
and threw the bridge across the Goomtee which contributed greatly towards the success
of the attack, and he acted as second in command under Sir Hugh Rose against
Tantia Topee. He served in the same capacity in China under Sir Hope Grant.

Londonderry, and at the East India College, Haileybury. In 1829 he obtained his
nomination to India as a writer, thus early entering upon a career that subsequently
opened up before him much noble work. After having held many subordinate offices,
he at length attracted the attention of the Governor-General, Sir H. Harding, and his
promotion from that period, 1845, was very rapid, until the Indian Mutiny brought
him into full public notice. In 1869 he was elevated to the peerage. At the first
election for the London School Board in 1870 he was elected Chairman, a position
he resigned in 1873. Died June 27, 1879.

was most enthusiastically welcomed. On July 2, accompanied by his numerous
suite, he visited Madame Tussaud’s Exhibition, and expressed himself highly pleased
with the various figures represented. On leaving, the Shah wrote in Persian the follow-
ing, which, with a correct translation, is on view : “ Whilst staying in London I visited

considered among the most brilliant military exploits of the present century.
21. YAKOOB KHAN, successor to Shere Ali, Ameer of Afghanistan,
22. SIR LOUIS CAVAGNARI, late Envoy at Cabul, who was barbarously
murdered with the principal members of his suite at Cabul. This circumstance

31. HR.H. DUCHESS OF ALBANY, PRINCESS HELEN OF
WALDECK Helen Frederica Augusta was born on February 17, 1001, ana is
eight years younger than the Duke of Albany. She is the fouith daughter now iving
of the reigning Prince George Victor and Princess Helen Wilhelmina Henrietta of
Waldeck-Pyrmont. The sovereign house of Waldeck is of great antiquity, and its
pedigree can be clearly traced to Wltikind 1., living in 1120. The princess has our
sisters surviving—Princess Pauline, Princess Mary, Princess Adelaide, and Princess
Elizabeth, the latter unmarried. She has one brother, Frederick, hereditary Prince,
bom January 20, 1865.
32 PRINCE LEOPOLD* Duke of Albany, is the fourth son of Her Majesty,
and was born April 7, 1853 ; married April 27, 1882, Helen Frederica Augusta, Princess
of Waldeck. He speaks both German and French with great facility, and has a fair
knowledge of Italian. With no taint of flattery it may be said of the Duke of Albany
that he is “a scholar, and a ripe and good one. ,, On May 24, 1881, the dignities of
Baron Arklow, Earl of Clarence, and Duke of Albany were granted to him by his royal
mother. He took his seat in the House of Lords on June 20, 1881. The title, “ Duke
of Albany,” is a very ancient Scottish one. “The etymological root of the word is Alb,
or Alp, primarily signifying white; then, high hills covered with snow ; third, any high
mountain range; fourth, it was applied to Britain as a mountainous island; and is still
an old name for the mountains of Scotland.” The title was first conferred in Oll
the second son of Robert 11. while he was Regent of Scotland. The second Duke of
Albany died on the Castle Hill of Stirling, and the title was forfeited. It was sub-
sequently revived and conferred upon the second son of James 11. It was next be-
stowed upon Darnley, shortly before he married Queen Mary, and afterwards held
successively by the second son of James VI. and the second son of Charles I. As a
British title, it was borne by Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, second son
of George HI. It is also associated with Prince Charles Stuart, who for a time
assumed the title of Count of Albany, and throughout four centuries it reappears in
the most stirring episodes of Scottish history.
33. LORD VISCOUNT NELSON in the uniform ot an admiral. (From a
cast taken from his face after death.) Horatio Viscount Nelson was the fourth son of
the Rev. Mr. Nelson, Rector of Burnham Thorpe, in Norfolk, at which place Horatio
was born, September 29, 1758. His victories, like those of Wellington, produced the
most important consequences to this country; and the fame they have procured for him
is so great that it is almost superfluous to name them. He first went to sea at the age
of 12, under his uncle, Captain Suckling. After many glorious victories, Nelson died
at the memorable battle of Trafalgar, October 21, 1805.

eventually separated himself from the great Conservative party in February, 1851, after
Lord Palmerston’s death became leader of the House of Commons. Mr. Gladstone

this period he was the advocate of Catholic Emancipation, and the supporter ot the
liberal policy of Canning. In 1830 he became Minister for Foreign Affairs, and
as such, was instrumental in forming the Kingdom of Belgium and the celebrated
Quadruple Alliance. For a period he resigned the -foreign seals, only to resume them
again, when he threw the ajgis of England over the Turkish Empire, threatened by
Mohammed Ali. For some years after Lord Palmerston was in opposition dining the
administration of Sir Robert Peel, when the Corn Laws were abolished; out upon
the fall of the latter, the Whigs returned to office, and again Palmerston became
Foreign Minister, and pursued a policy of non-intervention during that critical period,
when every country in Europe was more or less convulsed by revolutions. In 1809,
Lord Palmerston again assumed the helm, Lord John Russell talcing the foreign sea s,
and Mr. Gladstone becoming the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Died October 18, 1860.

The following ffgures are placed in the new room called the “HALL OF KINGS," because it
contains a series of portraits, in oil, by famous artists. On the walls are placed a number of
pictures which deserve to be carefully observed. There is a portrait (full-length) of Her Majesty
Queen Victoria, in her robes of State, painted with her gracious permission, by Sir Georgs
Haytkr ; Prince Albert, by Fatten; William IV., by Simpson; George HI. and Queen
Charlotte, by Sir Joshua Reynolds, two of his best pictures, and purchased by Madame
Tussaud, at the sale of the effects of Queen Adelaide; George IV., by Sir Thomas Lawrence ;
George 11., by Hudson ; George 1., by KNEi.LER(a superb picture, considered one of this famous
artist’s masterpieces); Queen Anne, by Sir Peter Lely, also much admired by connoisseurs.
The Allegory over the door is by Thornhill, and represents the Duke of Cumberland. Ike
ceiling of this chamber is also by Sir James Thornhill.
151. EDWARD 111. (1327 —1377), in the costume of the period ; eldest son of
Edward II.; born at Windsor, 1312 ; married Philippa, daughter of William, Earl of
Hainault, Holland, by whom he had seven children, the eldest of whom was afterwards
celebrated as the Black Prince. Edward claimed the crown of France in right of his
mother Isabella, daughter of Philippe IV. of France, which led to much bloodshed. He
instituted the order of the Garter in 1349. Under his reign oil painting was invented
by John Van Eyck; gunpowder and artillery by a monk at Cologne; and paper-
making also was introduced. In this reign also the brothers Blankett, of Bristol, first
wove the material of that name. Edward died of a broken heart, and was buried in
Westminster Abbey.
152. PHILIPPA, Queen of Edward 111., wearing the girdle of the Order of
Knighthood, conferred on her for her bravery at the battle of Neville’s Cross, near
Durham, fought against the Scotch, whose king, David, she took prisoner, October 17,
1346. According to Froissart, “15,000 were slain, the total number of men engaged on
both sides being about 50,000.” She also gained imperishable fame for her humanity.
153. GREEN JOAN OF NAVARRE, daughter of the King of Navarre and
Dowager Duchess of Bretagne, second consort of Henry IV. She was arrested on a
charge of witchcraft, and imprisoned at Pevency Castle. Died, 1437.
/
154. HENRY IV. (reigned 1399—1413). Surnamed Bolingbroke, grandson of
Edward 111., and eldest son of John of Gaunt. Born at Bolingbroke, in Lincolnshire,
A.D. 1367. His usurpation of the throne was the cause of the civil war between the
Houses of York and Lancaster, in the reign of Henry VI. He married first Mary de
Bohun, and afterwards Joan, daughter of the King of Navarre. Worn out by the
reverses of fortune, and broken-hearted with grief, he died suddenly in the Jerusalem
Chamber at Westminster, March and was buried at Canterbury. He was
the first English king who burned persons on account of their religious opinions.


155 HENRY V. feigned 1413—1422). Son of Henry IV., and surnamed
Monmouth ; born in Monmouth, in 1388. In his youth he was gay and dissipated, and
associated with loose companions, which conduct, however, lie redeemed when the reins
of power were placed in his hands. Pie revived the claim lormerly made by irciwaru
111. to the crown of France, asserting that it was the right of the Kings of Pmgland
ever since the death of Philip the Pair, whose daughter was mother oi Edwaic ii
Pie is renowned as the conqueror of France. Pie fought and won the great battle ot
Agincourt in 1415. He permitted the persecution ct the Lollards, on his return to
England, many of whom were burnt at Smithfield during this icign. The Piench
being glad to make peace with him on any terms, it was agreed that he should marry
Princess Catherine, daughter of Charles VI., and succeed to the throne of Prance on
the decease of the French monarch. Catherine was crowned at Westminstei Abbey,
1421. He died in the thirty-fourth year of his age, and was buried at Westminster.
156. ISABELLA OP VALOIS, first wife of, Richard IP. I
" -i •
With her husband in great extravagance. She had 300 women in her seivice ; the king
prided himself in surpassing all the sovereigns of Europe in splendour, and, it is said,
entertained 10,000 persons daily.
157. RICHARD 11. (reigned 1377—1399), son of the Black Prince, born at-
Bordeaux, 1367. He was deposed by the Duke of Hereford, son ot the Duke of
Lancaster, who got himself crowned under the name of Henry IV., 1399. During his
reign the memorable insurrection on account of the poll tax was raised by the cele-
brated Wat Tyler ; cards were invented, and peers first created by patent. Richard was
vain, frivolous, and inconsistent, and a dupe to flattery. Richard was imprisoned in
Pontefract Castle, and died there, it is believed by violence, within a year of his
compulsory abdication.
158. EDWARD, usually called the Black Prince, born 1330 ; died, 1376 ; son
oi Edward HI. and Philippa of Plainault. The King, his father, having invaded
France to regain the crown that he claimed in right of his mother, Isabella, Edward
displayed extraordinary valour, and at the battle of Cressy, when he was only sixteen
years old, with a small force, he defeated the French, and won his knightly spurs. Ten
years later, at the battle of Poictiers, the Prince again completely routed the French,
taking their king, John, prisoner, who, with King David of Scotland, defeated by his
mother, made two captive kings in London. A large ransom having been demanded
for John, he was permitted to return to France to raise the money, but failing to do so
he returned to England and surrendered himself. He died at the palace of Savoy,
in the Strand, which, at that period, abounded with gentlemen’s houses and parks.
The motto chosen by Edward was ich dikn (I serve), being the words on the helmet of
the blind King of Bohemia, who fought on the side of the French at Cressy, and was
here slain.
159. JANE SEYMOUR, third wife of Henry VIII., and mother of Edward
VI., was maid of honour to Anne Boleyn, whom she supplanted in 1536. She died
the following year, two days after the birth of her son. Her brothers were the
founders of the Duchy of Somerset and the Earldom (now the Marquisate) of
Hertford.
160. IE COMTE DE PAEIS, in a costume made expressly for H.R.H.
161., ANNE OE CLEVES, fourth wife of Henry VIII., was the sister of the
Duke oi Cleves. Henry had remained unmarried nearly two years when, deceived by
flattering portraits and descriptions, he sought Anne in marriage, whom he no sooner
saw in a stolen interview at Rochester than his heart recoiled against her, and from
that moment he determined to get rid of her, which he did in that cruel manner natural
to him. She was divorced immediately, but continued to live in England, where she
died, 1557.
162., CATHARINE OF ARRAGON, the fourth daughter of Ferdinand
and Isabella, first Queen of Henry VIII, She was the widow of Arthur, Henry’s
brother, to whom she w r as espoused in her sixteenth year, and with whom she lived for
a short time at Ludlow, where he died of the plague in 1502, at the age of sixteen,

but was divorced after seventeen years’ maniage, Her mother, Queen Isabel of Spain,
had been raised to the throne of Castile by the Cortes, and Catharine first saw the
light in the town of Alcald de Henares in 1485. She was an exceedingly upright
and dignified woman. Her only daughter was Queen Mary I. Queen Catherine died
in 1536, and was buried in Peterborough Cathedral.


163. EDWARD V. Modelled from the work of Strutt, who gives his authority
as “Taken from a folio MS. on vellum, in the Archbishop’s library, Lambeth.”
Eldest son of Edward IV., whom he succeeded at the age of twelve; born at the
Sanctuary, at Westminster, 1471. Reigned only two months and twelve days of the
year 1483 ; although proclaimed king after his lather’s death he was never crowned.
He and his younger brother, the Luke of York, were smothered and buried in the
Tower by Sir James Tyrrell and his three associates, at the instigation of their Uncle
Richard, Duke of Gloucester, afterwards Richard 111.
164. CATHERINE HOWARD,
Henry VIII., was a daughter of that illustrious house ol which a niodern writer thus
eloquently remarks What family pervades our national annals with such intense and
brilliant interest as the Howards ? ” She perished on the same scaffold as did Queen Anne
Boleyn at the Tower, and died in the flower of her age, eighteen months after her
marriage to the king.
165. KING EDWARD VI. (1537

nine years, 1547, under the government of his uncle, the Duke of Somerset, who ruled
as Lord Protector, and was afterwards beheaded on Tower Hill. Christ’s Hospital (the
Blue Coat School) and St. Thomas’s Hospital, as also a large number of grammar
schools in all parts of the land, which are still popularly known as Ring Edward s
Schools, were founded by him. He died, July 6th, 1553, in the sixteenth year of his
age, leaving the crown to Lady Jane Grey, who reigned only ten was then
beheaded, together with her husband. Lord Dudley, on February Bth, 1554.
166. EDWARD IV. (reigned 1461—1483). Dressed in the Coronation Robe,
wearing the crown and Order of the Rose ; eldest son of Richard, Duke of York. Born
at Rouen, in France, 1441. During this reign lived the beautiful Jane Shore, the wile
of a goldsmith in Lombard Street, whom the king induced to leave her husband ; at
the king’s death she was compelled to do penance in a white sheet in St. Paul s Church-
yard ; she afterwards lived in wretchedness, and, it is said, died in a ditch (Shoreditch).
It is erroneously supposed that this originated the name of Shoreditch. ihe
word is reallv a corruption of the word Shew . Edward laid claim to the Lnghs
crown in opposition to Henry VI. The Earl of Warwick being anxious that the king
should connect himself in marriage with some powerful' European sovereign, went over,
by Edward’s desire, to France, to solicit the hand of Princess Bona of Savoy, a sister ot
Louis XI., for his master. During his absence Edward secretly married Elizabeth
Woodville, daughter of Sir Richard Woodville, afterwards Earl Rivers, which enraged
Earl Warwick, who now determined to depose him in favour of Henry VI. Ihe iJuise
of Clarence, afterwards supposed to have been drowned in a butt ot ilalmsey, wo a
married a daughter of the Earl, entered into an alliance with them, an a reconci la ion
was effected between them and Queen Margaret. Henry VI. was re stored to power
for a short time. The battles of Barnet and Tewkesbury, 1474, placed Edward agam
on the throne. Died, 1483.

son of * Henry VII. Thismodel is costumed as the King is represented in a

first to Lord Burghe and afterwards to Lord Latimer, and had g
escape a violent death by surviving the King. Her fourth and last husband was
Admiral Sevmour, who was beheaded under Edward vl. 1 ie c ( S4


170. ANNE BOIEYN (1507—1536, the second wife of Henry VIII.,
its she appeared in festival costume on the day after the death ot Queen
Catherine. She wore on that occasion, say the historians, a yellow dress in
token of joy at the demise of her rival. Anne Bolevn was the daughter of Sir
Thomas Boleyn, who was created Viscount and the Earl of Wiltshire. In her girl-
hood she was sent to France, where she was in attendance upon the Queen of Louis XII.
Returning to England she acted in a similar capacity to Catherine of Arragon, the
first wife of the king. Thus she attracted Henry’s notice, which was favourable in
the highest degree. When he had divorced Catherine, he married Anne, and she
became the mother of a child, afterwards our great Queen Elizabeth, hour years after
her marriage she was accused of unchastity, both before and after the king marrying her,
and was condemned and beheaded. The day after the execution of Anne the king was
guilty of the cruel indecorum of marrying Jane Seymour.
171. HENRY VI. (reigned 1422-1471). Only son of Henry V., succeeded
his father when only nine months, his uncle, Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, being
Protector. Born at Windsor, in 1421, crowned King of England and Trance at West-
minster, and reigned nearly thirty-nine years. Married to Margaret of Anjou. The
civil wars of the Roses between the Houses of York and Lancaster, which lasted thirty
years, and resulted in the victory of the House of York, took place during this reign.
Richard Nevill, Earl of Warwick, called the king-maker, and considered the last of the
great feudal barons of England, supported the cause of the Duke of York. Slain at
Wakefield, and succeeded by his eldest son Edward, Earl of March.
172. WYCKLIFFE, the first translator of the Bible into English.
173. CARDINAL WOISEY, in the dress of a Cardinal, born at Ipswich,
in March, 1471 ; son of a butcher; became a student at so early an age as to enable
him to take the degree of B.A. when only 14 years of age. He won the favour
of Henry VIII., who raised him to the highest position in the state, and whom he
ultimately eclipsed in splendour and ostentation. He built Hampton Court Palace, and
kept a retinue of eight hundred persons. In opposing the divorce between Henry VIII.
and Catherine of Arragon, he was disgraced by the king, and died as his persecu-
tors were dragging him towards London, at the Abbey of Leicester, November 18,
1530.
174. WILLIAM OF WYKEHAM, born in 1324, died in 1404, Chancellor
and Bishop of Winchester. Founded Winchester School in 1387, and New College,
Oxford. He was distinguished for his piety, love of learning, and taste for architecture ;
he built a great portion of Windsor Castle.
175. GEOFFREY CHAUCER, poet-styled the father of English literature,
because he was the first who wrote in the common language of the people; born, 1328 ;
died, 1400. Various accounts have been given even of the place of his birth; but he
himself, in one of his prose pieces, his “Testament of Love,” seems expressly to inti-
mate that he was a native of London. Of his family nothing whatever can be said to
be known. Some suppose him to have been of noble descent, while others, judging
by the name—which in old French signifies “ breeches maker”—conclude that he must
have sprung from a plebeian stock. A common tradition is that his father was one
Richard Chaucer, who kept a tavern, according to Stowe, in the Royal Street, at the
corner of Kirton Lane, and was buried in 1348, in his parish church of St. Mary
Aldermary, to which he left his house and appurtenances. The works of Chaucer are
very voluminous, consisting, besides several prose treatises, of his famous “Canterbury
Tales,” a poem extending to above 17,000 lines, without including the portion of
which the genuineness is doubted, or the “Parson’s Tale,” which is in prose ; the
“ Romaunt of the Rose,” a translation from the French of William de Lords, of
which there are nearly 8,000 lines; a poem of “Troilus and Cressida,” in five books;
“ The House of Fame,” in three books, and many minor pieces. Nearly all the pro-
ductions are rich in beauty, and of those which are less known, the “ Romaunt of
the Rose,” the “ Troilus and Cressida,” the “ Flower and the Leaf,” and the
“ House of Fame,” may be specially recommended to the attention of the lovers
of poetic inspiration, as evincing all of them an affluence of imaginative genius
equal, perhaps, to anything that is to be found, even in the “Canterbury Tales ”
themselves.
176. RICHARD 111, (1483-1485). In a magnificent suit of armour of the
period ; last of the Plantagenet line which reigned from Henry 11., son of Geoffrey
Plantagenet, 330 years. (The likeness, taken with th£ kind permission of his Grace
the Duke of Norfolk, from the original picture in his Grace’s possession at Arundel, is
believed to be the only one for which the King ever sat.) Richard was the fourth son


of Richard, Duke of York, and was long known under the name of the Duke ot
Gloucester, brother of Edward IV., first Prince of York, whose cause he supported
against the partisans of Henry VI. With the connivance of King Edward IV. he
murdered their brother George, Duke of Clarence, then married his widow, Warwick*s
daughter; was conquered and slain at Bosworth, 1485, by Richmond (Henry VII.)
He was the last king of the House of York, and the “ Wars of the Roses ” thus came
to an end. It is supposed that he caused the two sons of Edward IV. to be smothered
in the Tower. In this reign the Post was first established.
. 177. WILLIAM CAXTON,
printing press into England, in or about the year 1473. The first work printed in this

of his triumphant struggle with France was the complete achievement of German unity,
which was typified by the assumption of the imperial title, and by his solemn corona-
tion at Konigsberg after the termination of the war.
186. ALEXANDER 11., LATE EMPEROR OF RUSSIA, assassinated on
March 13. 1881. The history of this well-intentioned but unfortunate sovereign is but
too well known, and his recent and awful death is still fresh in the public mind. Like
Louis XVI. of France, he was the victim of the errors and crimes of his predecessors.
187. EDINBURGH (ADMIRAL THE DUKE OF), H.R.H. Prince
Alfred Ernest Albert, K.G., K.P., Duke of Saxony, and Prince of Saxe-
Coburg Gotha, second son of Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen; bom at

courtship brought the matter to a favourable crisis, for Matilda, being conymcea ot
William’s passion by the violence of his behaviour, consented to become his wile, hne
worked the famous Bayeux tapestry.
193. WILLIAM OE NOEMANDY (1066-1087), sumamed the Conqueror
from having gained the great battle of Hastings, at which place he landed with me
intention of compelling Harold, the last of the Saxon Kings, to perform his promise to
yield him the throne of England. Natural son of Robert 11., Duke ot Normandy,
sumamed the Liberal (though in certain romances of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries he is called Robert le Diable), was bom at Falaise in 1027. He came by the
injuries which caused his death at Mantes-sur-Seine, in an expedition undertaken
against Philip 1., King of France, in order to punish that prince for some pleasantries
as to his corpulence. William was of a cruel disposition, and ruled the English with an
iron hand. He introduced the Curfew bell, at whose signal, at eight o’clock at night,
every Are and light was extinguished. This custom, however, prevailed in Spain, Ital),
and several other countries, in order to prevent the terrible conflagrations which at
times took place when buildings were mostly constructed of wood. He left thiee sons ,
to Robert, the eldest, he bequeathed Normand} 7 ; William was to succeed him to the
throne of England ; and to his son Henry he left 5,000 marks. He died in September,
1087, at the Priory of St, Gervais, near Rouen, and was buried in the Abbey Church ol
St. Stephen’s, at Caen, in Normandy.
194. WILLIAM 11. (1087—1100), in the costume ot the period, sumamed
Rufus, or the Red, not, as is commonly but erroneously stated, from having red hair,
but on account of his florid and ruddy complexion. The second son of the Conqueror,
he ascended the throne by his father’s will, to the exclusion of his elder brother
Robert, to whom he gave Normandy. William was bom in Normandy, a.d. 1057,
crowned at Westminster, and reigned thirteen years. He never married. He was killed,
by accident, by Sir Walter Tyrrel, whilst hunting in the New Forest. When the
barons and attendants who were with him saw him fall dead, they cut boughs and
saplings, which they hastily made into a litter by means of their belts and saddle-girths.
On this they piled fern fronds and wild flowers, placing thereon the body of the King ;
and laying at the same time the cloak of one of the barons under him, and covering
him with that of another, thev conveyed him to Winchester for burial. He was
courageous,but intemperate and covetous.


195 HENRY I (reigned 1100 to 1135), surnamed Beauclerc, or the Scholar,,
in a suit of mail, bom at Selby, in Yorkshire, a.d. 1068, crowned at Westminster, and
reigned thirty-five years. Youngest son of the Conqueror; seized on the vacant
throne contrary to the agreement between him and Robert, Duke of Normandy, that
whichever of the two brothers survived the other, should succeed to both crowns.
Robert who was in Normandy at the time, was thus a second tune deprived of his
hereditary right. He married Matilda, daughter of Malcolm 111. of Scotland, and
niece of Atheling; thus uniting the Norman and Saxon interests. He acquired
the name of Beauclerc from translating FEsop’s Fables. He died from gorging himself
with lampreys, while on a hunting expedition in the JB orest of Laon, near Rouen, o
which place he was taken,
196. XING STEPHEN (1130-1154). Stephen of Blois, Ring of England
son of a daughter of William the Conqueror and the Count de Blois. At the death of
Henry 1., in 1135, Stephen usurped the throne of England, setting aside Matilda,
daughter and heiress of Henry I. After a long struggle with her and her son Henry,
assisted by David, King of Scotland, Matilda’s uncle, it was agreed that Stephen
should have undisturbed possession of the kingdom for Ins life, and that Henry should
succeed him. Died at Dover 1154, in the 50th year of his age, and buiied neai is
consort in Faversham Abbey, Rent.
IQ7 (LINE OF PLANTAGENET.) HENRY 11. (reigned iis4-iiB9),

by Matilda, daughter of Henry I. Fie was born at Le Mans, in Normandy, A.D. 1133,
and crowned three times, at Westminster, Lincoln and Worcester. The name of
Plantagenet, in Latin Planta Genista, is derived from the crest of the family, which
was a bunch of broom. He married Eleanor, daughter of William, Duke of Aquitaine,
and divorced wife of Louis VIE, King of France, by whom he had issue Wilham, who
died an infant; Henry, who married Margaret, daughter of Louis YU., Geoffrey,

201. HENRY 111. (reigned 1216—1272), son of King John, dressed in the
costume of the period. Born October 11, 1207, at Winchester ; died at Westminster,
November 16, 1272, of natural decay; interred in the chapel of Edward the
Confessor, in the Abbey Church of Westminster, where his tomb is still to be seen.
His heart lies at Fontevrault. He was gentle and credulous, warm in his attachments,
and forgiving in his enmities, without vices, but also without energy; he was a good
man, but a weak monarch. Henry married, on January 4, 1236, Eleanor of Provence,
who, on her mother’s side, was of the house of Savoy (the present head of which is the
King of Italy), and who had scarcely completed her fourteenth year. This reign is
generally considered as the commencement of our English House of Commons. In
1258 he was virtually deposed by the 44 Mad Parliament,” and a Council of State was
formed under Simon de Montfort. In 1262 Civil War began. The first Parliament to
which elected representatives were summoned was held in 1265. Carpets and tapestry
were introduced by Eleanor from Spain as preferable substitutes for rushes and straw.
A charter was granted to the inhabitants of Newcastle-on-4yne to dig for coal, which
had not previously been used as fuel.

111., born, 1232; crowned, 1274; died July, 1307, at Burgh-upon-the-Sands, in
Cumberland, in the 69th year of his age, and was buried at Westminster. His character
was cruel, but brave and warlike. He conquered Wales, and added it to England. He
also conquered Scotland, and such was his determination to subdue it, that he left a
dying order to his son to bear his bones in procession at the head of the army every
time that the Scotch attempted to rise against England, and to carry fire and sword into
the country till its final subjection. Edward was the first king of England that quartered
the arms of England and France, and the first sovereign that was called Lord of Ireland
on his coin. He was much attached to his queen, Eleanor of Castille, whose son
was the first Prince of Wales. At her death, at Grantham, in Lincolnshire, in 1290,
he caused crosses to be erected at each place where her corpse rested, namely,
Waltham, St. Albans, &c., and Charing Cross.
203. EDWARD 11. (reigned 1307 — 1327), surnamed of Carnarvon, eldest son
of Edward 1., born at Carnarvon in 1284, was the first English Prince of Wales. He
married the daughter of the King of France, Philippe IV., and had issue two sons and
one daughter. Regardless of the dying requests of his father he discontinued the war
in the North ; the Scotch recovered the towns they had lost. He afterwards renewed
the war when too late, and was totally routed at Bannockburn by Robert Bruce. His
fondness for favourites disgusted his Queen and nobility, who drove Edward into Wales,
where he was seized by the Earl of Leicester, and imprisoned in Kenilworth Castle; he
was afterwards removed to Berkley Castle, where he was cruelly murdered in 1327, with
the connivance of his Queen. Edward was the first English King deposed by his sub-
jects. He was buried privately in the Abbey Church of St. Peter’s, Gloucester.
204. ISABELLA, wife of Edward 11., surnamed La Belle, or the handsome, in
the costume of the period, daughter of Philippe IV. of France. Her brother, Charles
the Fair, gave her as her portion Guienne. She was a woman of violent passions, and
becoming weary of her effeminate husband, caused him to be put to death. She then
married her paramour, Mortimer, but he in turn was executed by order of Edward 111.,
and the Queen was banished to Castle Rising, where she died at an advanced age.

engrossed with the politics of his adopted country, and is now justly regarded as a most
distinguished statesman.
. 216. BISMARCK (Prince Yon), SCHONHAXISEN OTTO- Bom, 1816.
This distinguished Prussian statesman entered at an early age the diplomatic seivice, ana
speedily showed that he had no small amount of ability in the conduct of affairs. In
1851 the Ring of Prussia appointed him his representative in the Diet of h rankfort.
Subsequently he was despatched on a special mission to Vienna. On his return to
Berlin he applied himself to home politics, and took the side of the Crown in the
disputes which arose between the Ring and the Chambers on the Constitution ot
Prussia. In 1862, after an unfavourable vote in the Chambers, the Ministry resigned,
and the Ring called in new councillors, and on the resignation ot the chief of them-
M. Von der Heydt—Bismarck was chosen by the Ring as President of the Cabinet and
Minister of Foreign Affairs, but he had a hard battle to tight, not being so popu ar as

1831. In 1832 he was a candidate for a seat in Parliament, as Radical representative
of the borough of Chipping Wycomb, a few miles from his father s resi ence a
Bradenham, Bucks. He unsuccessfully contested this borough three times. On the
third accession of Eord Derby to power in 1866, Disraeli a second tnne ecame
Chancellor of the Exchequer, and in 1868 he attained the Premiership, whie i ie resigae ,
but only for a short time. His orations ranked high for political invective, epigiamma ic
subtlety, daring originality, and often true thought; and in short, combine
the genius of Boling broke, the wit of Canning, and the eloquence of Bui ce. o e
regret of the Queen and nation, Lord Beaconslield died April 19, 1881, after a short
illness.
218 THE RIGHT HON. THE MARQUIS OE SALISBURY, bom

the succession to the throne as a bastard. The marriage of Mary Queen of Scots (who
was considered by the Catholic party as the rightful heir to the throne) to the Dauphin
of France induced Elizabeth to ally herself with the Reformers. In 1588 Philip of
Spain equipped an expedition for the purpose of invading England, which, from its

Parliaments which refused him subsidies, or had presented him such as the
“ Petition of Rights ” (1628). Roused his Scottish subjects by endeavouring to impose
upon them a new Liturgy, composed by Laud. The Presbyterians rose and drew up

don. Before her death, 1671, she espoused the Catholic religion, and James’s open
avowal of the faith led to a change in the Government called the “ Revolution,” by
which the male line of the Stuarts lost the sovereignty of England, which was bestowed
by Act of Parliament on William of Nassau, Prince of Orange, who married Mary, the
King’s eldest daughter. In 1671, James espoused the Princess Mary of Modena.

command o 1 the Emperor for the Palace at Fontainebleau. Purchased by Mr. Stirling,
in Paris, at the Restoration.
Mr. Stirling’s Letter to Mr. Tussaud.— 44 Dear Sir :In answer to your inquiry respecting the Portrait
of Napoleon, which you purchased of me, I have to state that it is considered to possess the pecu-
liar characteristic of that extraordinary man ; also, that it was not only painted by the Emperor’s
express command, but that he sat for it to Robert Le Fevre, and when finished, declared himself
perfectly satisfied with it as a painting and likeness,
44 I am, dear sir, yours faithfully,

Robert Le Fevre’s Letter to Mr. Stirling.— 44 1, the undersigned, attest that the full-length Portrait of
Napoleon, in the Imperial robes, that Mr. Stirling has bought in Paris of Madame Blanquieres,

Letter from Dr. O’Meara to Mr. Stirling.— 44 In reply to yours to know my opinion of the Portraits
of the Emperor Napoleon and Maria Louisa, now in your possession, I have to state that I con-
sider that of Napoleon to be the best whole-length likeness I have seen of him, and one that
conveys a very faithful idea of the original. With respect to the Empress Maria Louisa, Ido not
feel myself well qualified to pronounce an opinion, only having seen her once in Parma; but if my
recollection serve me right, it is a good likeness. I remain, dear sir, very faithfully yours,

“To Thomas Stirling , Esq.” 44 Surgeon to the Emperor Napoleon.”
THE EMPRESS MARIA LOUISA, full-length Portrait painted by com-
mand of the Emperor by the Baron Gerard, and which may be considered his master-
piece. The Emperor was so much pleased with it that he ordered it to be worked in
tapestry; this was exhibited in the Louvre. Both the pictures were exchanged by
French authorities for a collection of antiquities.
Baron Gerard’s Letter. — 44 1 pray Mr. Stirling to allow me to express my regret for the trouble he had
in calling at my house. Not being at home, I went to Madame Blanquieres as he requested. The
full-length portrait of Maria Louisa is precisely the one I presumed, and the one I took occasion
to speak of to Mr. Stirling; found it in a state of perfect preservation, as it left my house, never
haying been varnished. Mr. Stirling may therefore rest perfectly satisfied on the subject of it
being my work. I shall feel happy if this assurance can further his views. I have the honour to
remain, with the most perfect consideration,
44 Your very humble and obedient servant,

Second Room.
la which is placed the Carriage takea at Waterloo, purchased, with
the authority of the British Government, from the Prince Regent
by Mr. Bullock, for £2,500.
TPIE celebrated highly curious Military Carriage of the Emperor Napoleon, in which
he made the Campaign of Russia, and which was captured on the evening of the
Battle of Waterloo, and sent with the officer that took it to the Prince Regent, from
whom it was purchased by Mr. Bullock, of the Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly, for £2,500.
The interest excited by it as an exhibition was never exceeded in these kingdoms,
I 800,000 persons having paid to see it. It accompanied Napoleon in many of his cam-
| paigns, and was used by him as sovereign of Elba, and from its peculiar internal fittings,
cannot prove otherwise than highly interesting to the rising generation and to those
that recollect the excitement that it caused on its arrival, at the glorious termination of
the war. (See Letter from Air, Pullock.)
Mr Bullock’s Letter.—“ Dear Sir : The French Repeating Watch which you had of me I bad from
Monsieur Mali, of Paris, who was Valet of the late Emperor of France and accompanied him in
his Russian Campaign, and declared it to have been presented to him by Napoleon on bis leaving
him after the battle of Leipsig ; and I paid him the same price that I now charge you. He sold
it to* me with the celebrated Surtout, lined with sable, as he attested in the presence of Monsieur
August© Letbiere, son of the President of the French Academy of Rome, and Mr. Jean Horne,
who was for many years military Coachman to the Emperor Napoleon, and lost his right arm,
when the celebrated Carriage was taken by the Prussian Troops, about fifteen miles from Water-
loo on the evening of the great Battle, that was afterwards purchased by me from his late Majesty
George IV., for the sum of £2,500, and exhibited by me at the Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly, London,
as well as in the principal cities in Great Britain and Ireland, by the authority ol the Government,
and is the identical carriage I have just seen in your possession. The Diamonds found* in the
carriage of Napoleon, taken in Waterloo, were purchased by Mr. Mawe, diamond merchant in
the Strand, from Baron Von Keller, the officer who captured them. The present ones with others
were purchased by me from Mr. Mawe. ~
I am, dear Sir, your most obedient Servant,

From the Montietir Beige of Oct. 15, 1842 “ There was lately at Brussels an historical curiosity,
which is now removed to London. It is the carriage that conveyed the Emperor Napoleon to the
field of Waterloo ; was taken by the English during the rout, and while for a moment abandoned
recaptured, and concealed near Charleroy by some peasants. It was afterwards exhibited in the
Church of the Augustines, Brussels, and was publicly recognised. It was purchased and brought
to London, and bought by Messrs. Tussaud from Monsieur Bourden.”
“Brussels, April 23, 1841.
“ I, the undersigned, certify having this day seen at Brussels a Berlin, bearing the No. 12, which is pub-
licly recognised as being the one which conducted the Emperor Napoleon on the field of battle,
Waterloo. Some speculators having purchased this carriage, for the purpose of exhibiting it in
London and Berlin to the former enemies of France, it is to be wished that the French Govern-
ment had purchased it. The carriage that conducted Napoleon to Waterloo should, undoubtedly,
have had a suitable place in the National Museum.

NAPOLEON GROUP.
Forming a SERIES OF NATIONAL REMINISCENCES ot great interest. The authenticity of
the relics was declared at the public offices in the Court of Chancery, Southampton Buildings,
before the following Masters J. W. Farrar, Esq.; and Sir George Wilson, Knight.
It is almost needless to state, that everything connected with the first Emperor Napoleon Jel©ngs to
British history; it therefore follows that these extraordinary relics cannot but be highly interesting
to evexy reflecting mind, as they are such as ought not to be with propriety in private hands v but
should take their place in the “ INVALIDES ” in Paris, where rest the remains of the great
Soldier, General, Consul and Emperor of the French, amidst his companions m arms. It is well
known that relics, when authenticated, bring the period to which they belong imraediatelyto the
imagination: and as all those which were Prince Lucien’s (Napoleon s brother) are anirmea
before Masters in Chancery, and were intended by Bonaparte to have been the property ot his son
the King of Rome, but never having reached him, were sent to the Prince on the death ot his
mother, Madame Mere, there can be no doubt of their authenticity* With respect to toe rest,
certificates of their genuineness may be seen.
In order to give interest to the arrangement of the rooms in which the relics arc displayed, they are
fitted up exactly in the style of the period, with ceilings and picture-frames made expressly to show
the peculiar fashion of Napoleon s time.


Copy of a letter in The Times, January U, 1853.-“ Sir,-A paragraph appeared in ,of
December 11, purporting to be an extract from al' rencli paper, the i af>te, statin,, that It u
known that the Emperor Napoleon,left by his will to Queen Caroline dinerent articles, among
thera the bed on which he died,’ &c. Now, on reference to Napo.eon s will, it appears that the
only article left to his sister Caroline is a small Turkey carpet. Ine camp bedstead, mattresses
covered with silk, and silk coverlid (the latter articles said to be stained with Napoleon s blood),
with several other relics-araong them the cloak he wore at the battle of Marengo -were, m 1837,
transmitted from Paris to the late Lucien Bonaparte, Prince of Can.no, who was then residmg m
this country, in whose possession they remained until the year 1832, when he left England, and
shortly afterwards died. The several articles above mentioned were then at the Prince s residence
under the charge of his solicitor (one of our firm), by whose direction they were afterwards disposed
of to the Messrs. Tussaud of Baker Street, where they have ever since remained.. The statement
copied from the Patrie is, therefore, erroneous; and as it iscalculated _to injure tlle. Messrs.
Tussaud, we have to request, on their behalf, that you will do them the justice to publish this con-
tradiction of it.

1. MAESHAL ST. AENAXID, in the uniform of a French General, wearing
the Star of the Legion of Honour. Was the right hand of .Napoleon in his
Coup d'Etat, and selected by him to command the French Army in the Crimea. Born
in' 1801 ; died September 29, 1854.
2. GENEEAL TEOCHU, ex-President ot the French Republic, Governor
of Paris, and Commander-in-Chief ol the forces collected for the defence ot
that brilliant city during the Franco-Prussian War, was universally acknowledged to he
(if not absolutely supreme iu public estimation) one of the most abffi and, at the same
time, among the youngest French officers. He was a pupil of the military school of St.
Cyr and the staff school. He served in Algeria, being for some years on the staff of
Marshal Bugcaud. He was afterwards one of Marshal St. Arnaud’s aides-de-camp
during the Crimean War. After that commander’s death he was raised to the rank of
General, and commanded a brigade of infantry until the end of the Russian "War,
During the Italian campaign of 1859 he served with distinction in command of a
division.

Perigord was born of a noble family in Paris, 1/54 ; his parents not being affluent, he
was educated for the priesthood. He was successively Minister of State under the
Revolutionary Government and the Bourbons. Died 1838.
4. THE EX-EMPRESS OF THE FRENCH. Consort of Napoleon 111.
Eugenie-Maria de Montijo and Countess de Teba, is the second daughter of Donna
Marie de Manuela Kirkpatrick, of Closeburn, Countess Dowager of Montijos, and a
noble officer in the Spanish army, now deceased. She was bom May 5, 1826. On
January 29, 1853, she was married to the late Napoleon 111. at Notre Dame. The
sad story of the last few years is so well known that it would be superfluous to recapitu-
late the history of the many misfortunes which have befallen Her Imperial Majesty.
Suffice it to say that she lives amongst us, honoured for her virtues and pitied for
sorrows borne with truly Christian meekness and resignation.
5. THE LATE NAPOLEON 111., formerly President of the French
Republic ; elected Emperor 21—22 November, 1852 ; surrendered himself a prisoner to
the King of Prussia, at Sedan, September 2, 1870. Deposed at Paris, September 4,
died at Chiselhurst, England, January 9, 1873, buried January 15. His Majesty was a
faithful ally of England, and as such, and on account of his kindly disposition, he was
universally regretted here.

6. NAPOLEON BONAPAETE, in the uniform of a chasseur of the Guards,
with the Star of the Legion of Honour. (Taken from life in 1815.) This extra-
ordinary man was born at Ajaccio, in Corsica, August 15, 1769; he was the son of
Charles Bonaparte (descended from a family of Tuscany), and Letitia Raniolini. In
1795 he was appointed General in the army of Italy, and married Madame Beauharnais.
After a series of the most brilliant successes, he was finally defeated at Waterloo, June
18, 1815, which led to his surrender and deportation to St. Helena. He died May 5,
1821. He is buried in the Hotel des Invalides, Paris.
7. THE LATE PRINCE IMPERIAL
~ .. , » . .i
son of the late Emperor Napoleon HI. He pursued his studies during and since the


exile of the ex-Empress Eugenie at King’s College and Woolwich. His Imperial
Highness started for the Cape, having expressed his determination to fight by the side
of his comrades at the seat of war in Zululand, where he met his death, being caught
in an ambush and killed by the Zulus on Whit-Monday, June 1, 1879.
8. DUG DE EEICHSTADT (King of Rome), son of Napoleon and Maria
Louise, was born on March 20, 1811, and died of consumption on July 22, 1832.
He is represented in the uniform of the Austrian Guards. His death gave rise to the
report that he was poisoned, but this seems a very doubtful charge
9. A FAVOURITE MAMELUKE SERVANT OF NAPOLEON I. who.
it is believed, saved his life in Egypt. He is represented in the costume of the country.
10. MARSHAL NEY, as a Marshal ot France. Born January 10, 1769.
Marshal Ney was, perhaps, next to Napoleon, the greatest of the generals produced by
the French Revolution ; the estimation in which he was held by those to whom he
was known, for his amiable qualities as a man and his transcendent talents as a general,
leave him second to none. At Waterloo he commanded the centre, and had five horses
shot under him. Having left the restored Bourbons and joined Napoleon on his return
from Elba, he was found guilty of high treason, and shot December 7, 1815.

“HE IS A SHALLOW CRITIC,” pithily remarked^^^elgraph
in its leading article (March 20, 1868) on the Todmorden murder, “ WHO WONDERS
AT THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN GREAT CRIMES. AND FINDS FAULT
WITH IT.”
In consequence of the peculiarity of the appearance of the following highly interesting Figures and
Objects, they are placed in a separate room. The sensation created by the crimes of Rush, the
Mannings, &c., was so great that thousands were unable to satisfy their curiosity. It therefore
induced Madame Tussaud and Sons to expend a large sum in building a suitable room for the
purpose : and they need scarcely assure the public that so far from the exhibition of the likenesses
of criminals creating a desire to imitate them, experience teaches them that it has a direct ten-
dency to the contrary.
1. CHARLES PEACE, the notorious Banner-Cross assassin and Blackheath
burglar, as he appeared on his trial. He was tried and sentenced to be hanged on the
4th of February, 1879, for the murder of Mr. Dyson at Banner-Cross two years previous.
2. ROBINSON, the policeman who apprehended Peace, the burglar.
3. PEACE as Mr. Thompson.
4. LEWIS JAMES PAINE, convicted of the manslaughter by alcoholic
poisoning of Miss Annie Mac Lean at a coffee-house in Seymour Place, Marylebone
Road, November 17, 1879.
5. EDWARD OXFORD, who conceived the diabolical act of murdering the
Queen and Prince Albert, whom he shot at in their progress up Constitution Hill, on
June 10, 1840, was a lad some seventeen or eighteen years of age, and either a consum-
mate villain or a maniac. He was tried July 9, declared insane, and condemned to in-
carceration for life. At last he received a free pardon, subject only to the very proper
provision that he should expatriate himself, and never return to British shores.
6. JAMES GREENACRE, the murderer of Hannah Brown, whose body he
mutilated, and the remains of which he dispersed in various parts of the metropolis. He
was executed May 2, 1837. On the dock, the knife may be seen that was used by
Greenacre to cut up his victim.
7. DANIEL GOOD. (Taken from life.) The murderer of Jane Jones at
Gamard Lodge, Roehampton. The murder was discovered by accident, Good having
been charged by a pawnbroker with stealing a pair of trousers. The police went to search
the premises ; but on the officers entering the stable, Good being coachman, he be-
came greatly agitated, and when they entered the fourth stall he rushed out and locked
them in. Beneath some hay they found an object they could not understand, but which
on examination proved to be the trunk of a female. It was impossible to identify the
remains, but from evidence produced at the inquest, the jury found the body to be that
of Jane Jones, or Good, and that Good had wilfully murdered her. Good evaded detec-
tion for about two weeks, when he was discovered working as a bricklayer’s labourer at
Tunbridge. He was committed to Maidstone Gaol, and being identified, was conveyed
to London, tried, and found guilty on May 14, 1842. He was executed on May 23,
1842.


8 and 10. MAMA MANNING and GEORGE MANNING. It would
be impossible to describe the astonishing effect produced on the inhabitants of the
metropolis by the horrible murder of Mr. O’Connor; few would credit that a man and
wife could kave fallen so low in infamy. They were tried at the Old Bailey on
October 25, 1849. The trial lasted three days, and after the most conclusive evidence
they were convicted, and executed at Horscmonger Lane Gaol, November 13, 1849.
9. MILES WETHEBILL, executed at Manchester, April 4, 1868, for the
murder at Todmorden, of the Rev. A. Plow and his housemaid. The latter he shot dead
on the spot. The reverend gentleman died from the wounds on the 12th, and the infant
on the same day. Mrs. Plew died in March following, 1869.
11. WALTER MILLER, the murderer ot the Rev. Mr. Huelin and his
housekeeper, Mrs. Ann Boss, at 15, Paulton Square, Chelsea, on May 11, 1870. The
murder was discovered by a van proprietor named Piper, who was employed by Miller
for the purpose of removing a box said to contain a variety of goods. The box was
found to contain the body of Mrs. Boss, the housekeeper of Mr. Huelin. On his being
given into custody a portion of his clothing was identified as having belonged to Mr,
Huelin, also several deeds relating to property possessed by that gentleman. Miller
was tried on July 14, found guilty, and executed on August 1, 1870. Piper the carman
was rewarded with a sum of £5O.
12. FREDERICK HINSON. Executed at Newgate, December 18, 1869, for
the murder of his paramour, Maria Death, at Wood Green, Middlesex.
13. DTJMOLLARD AND HIS WIFE.. These fiends lived by decoying
young women, under the pretence of getting them situations, into a wood near Lyons,
in France, and brutally murdering them by garotting, and after taking all they possessed,
clothes, &c., put their bodies into a new-made grave, previously prepared. In this
manner they despatched seventeen or eighteen ; but at length, being detected, Dumollard
suffered death, and his wife was sentenced to the galleys for life.
14 PIERRI a native of the Roman States, participated in the attempt
on the life of the late Emperor Napoleon, for which he was guillotined on March 13,
1858.
15. GIOVANNI PIANORI, in a camisole-de-force, worn by criminals (to
prevent suicide), was executed on the morning of May 14, 1855, for attempting (April
28, 1855) the life of the late Emperor of the French, at the corner of the Rue Balzac,
by twice firing at him with a double-barrelled pistol.
16. ORSINI was a native of the Roman States, and oi noble family. At an
early age he became affected by revolutionary doctrines, which ended with the sacrifice
of his life. He was guillotined in Paris, on March 13, 1858, tor attempting the lives of
the late Emperor Napoleon 111. and the Empress, on their visit to the Italian Opera.
17. WILLIAM HENRY WALTER, the notorious forger, whose name is
associated with the De Goncourt turf frauds, and who was sentenced by Mr. Justice
Denman to twenty years’ penal servitude for feloniously altering a certain order
for the payment of £905. This was only one of the many acts of forgery with which
he was charged.
18.
19. HARRY BENSON was sentenced to penal servitude for perpetrating the
notorious De Goncourt turf frauds.
20. WILLIAM FISH, executed
Blackburn, on the 28th March, 1876, was bom at Darwen, April 1, 1850. A sketch ot
the antecedents of Fish, and the full account of the tragedy, is to be found in a pamp e
published by Mr. Toulmin, of Preston.
21. DR. COTJTY DE LA POMMERAIS, poisoner guillotined. From
a photograph and other authorities, by Frisquart, 23, Rue Louis le Gran , a


22. WILLIAM GODFREY YOUNGMAN, found guilty of the foul
murders, in his father’s house, Manor Place, Walworth, of his sweetheart, a young
woman named Mary Wells Stretter, his mother, and two brothers, by first stabbing them
and then cutting their throats. He was executed at Horsemonger Lane Gaol,
September 4, 1860, in presence of nearly 30,000 spectators.
23. JAMES BLOOMFIELD RUSH. (Taken from life at Norwich, dressed
as he appeared on the occasion of his trial.) Executed at Norwich on April 21, 1849,
for the murders of Mr. Jermy and his son at Stanfield Hall, on November 28, 1848.
At his execution an immense black banner was unfurled from the battlements of Norwich
Castle, to mark the extraordinary guilt of the prisoner.
24. MARGUERITE DIBLANC, the murderess of Madame Reil in Park
Lane, April 6, 1872. Diblanc was tracked through France by the English detec-
tives, and arrested at a charbonnier’s shop at St. Denis, at the very moment she had
confessed her guilt to the charbonnier, who was then deliberating about giving her
into custody. A portion of the missing property being found in her possession, she
was brought to London, on Monday, April 20, and on Wednesday committed for trial.
Was tried, June 14, found guilty, and sentenced to death, but the juiy recommended
her to mercy. She was reprieved, and ordered to be detained during Her Majesty’s
pleasure.
25. 14 ST. LUKE’S MYSTERY.”—FELIX STUMM, 34, a German baker,
was sentenced to ten years’penal servitude on Dec. 11, 1882, for forging a mortgage
deed, having relation to the property of Urban Napoleon Stanger, another German
baker, who mysteriously disappeared in November, 1881, and who has never since been
heard of. On hearing the sentence the prisoner, in an impudent tone, said, “I thank
you, my Lord.”
, 26. WILLIAM. HERBERT, convicted oi the wilful murder of his sister-in-
law, Jane Messenger, with whom he had previously absconded, by shooting her with
a revolver in Finsbury Park on October 22, 1880. He afterwards tried to commit
suicide by shooting himself. He was tried and sentenced to death, November 24,
and executed December 13, 1880, the same day as George Pavey, the Acton
murderer, having by an extraordinary coincidence been tried on the same day, before
the same judge, Mr. Justice Hawkins—an unprecedented occurrence in the annals of the
Old Bailey.
27.. RICHARD COATES, the artilleryman, aged 21, convicted of the murder
of the little girl, Alice Boughen, was executed within the county gaol of Springfield,
near Chelmslord, Essex. "The circumstances of the brutal atrocity of which he was
guilty are but too well known to the public.
28. GEORGE PAVEY, convicted of the murder of Ada Shepherd, 10 years of
age, under most atrocious circumstances, at Acton, on October 22, 1880. He was tried
and sentenced to death November 24, and executed December 13, 1880.
29. MRS. CATHERINE WILSON, “ The Poisoner, ” executed at
Newgate, October 20, 1862, for poisoning Mrs. Soames, of Bedford Square.
30. WILLIAM SHE WARD, convicted on his own confession, and privately
executed at Norwich, for the murder of his wife, Tuesday, April 20, 1869. He had
murdered her many years before, and concealed the remains. He voluntarily gave
himself up, saying he could keep the secret no longer. After committing the murder, he
was base enough to marry a second wife, by whom he had several children.
31. WILLIAM PALMER. The annals of crime have not produced a more
cold-blooded murderer. Under the guise of love and friendship, he sacrificed his
victims to gratify his lust for gold; and, callous to the voice of nature, he coolly smiled
at the torture he inflicted, calculating the effect of each dose f of poison, and the time
that it would take effect. Palmer was educated as a surgeon. He was executed at
Stafford, for the murder of J. P. Cooke, June 14, 1856. . ; ‘
32. CHARLOTTE WINSOR, better known as the 44 Baby Farmer.”
Tried at Exeter with Mary Jane Harris, for the murder of the infant child of Harris, a
servant girl, on March 17, 1865. The jury, after being locked up, could not agree, and
were discharged ; but the judge ordered the prisoners to be detained in custody. They
were again brought up for trial on July 25 ; but the capital sentence was from time to
time deferred until a decision could be arrived at, which was their consignment to prison
for the term of then* natural lives.
33. DE TOURVILLE was tried and condemned to death for the murder
of his wife by pushing her over a precipice in the Austrian Tyrol.


34. FIESCHI. (Taken from life in Paris, 1835.) Represented in the act of
applying the match to the infernal machine. Fieschi, the demen who attempted the
lives of the King of the French and his sons, was a native of Corsica. He fired an
irffernal machine, as the King rode along the lines of the National Guard, on the
Boulevard du Temple, accompanied by his sons and suite. The king and his sons
escaped, but Marshal Mortier was shot dead, and many officers were dangerously
wounded. He and his confederates in the plot were tried, July 28, 1835, in the Court
of Peers, and condemned to the guillotine. Fieschi died as he had lived, a miscreant,
February 19, 1836.
85. MARY ANN COTTON. The series ot cold-blooded murders for which
this wretched woman was hanged on the morning of Monday, March 24,1873, are crimes
which no punishment in history can atone for. The child she rocked on her knee to-day
was poisoned to-morrow. Most of her murders were committed for petty gains; and
she killed off husbands and children with the unconcern of a farm-girl killing poultry.
86. THE EXECUTIONER.
37. JOHN JONES, alias OWEN, the murderer 01 the Marshall family,
at Denham, Uxbridge, was apprehended on May 24, 1870. The victims were
Emmanuel Marshall, Mrs. Marshall, Mary Ann Marshall, his sister, Mary Marshall, the
grandmother, and Gertrude, Theresa, and Mary, three children, aged eight, six, and four
years. The inhuman monster despatched his victims one after another with a large
smith’s hammer. Was tried at Aylesbury, on July 22, 1870. At the conclusion of the
Judge’s address the prisoner stepped from the box saying in a jaunty manner, “ Thank
you, sir.” He was executed at Aylesbury. The murdered family were buried in Denham
Churchyard, amid many outward tokens of the grief excited in the neighbourhood by
the perpetration of the terrible crime, on May 27, 1870.
88. JAMES MULLINS, tried at the Old Bailey, October 25, 1860, for
tta murder of Mrs. Emsley, an aged widow lady of considerable means, but parsi-
monious habits, residing in Grove Road, Stepney. From information given by Mullins,
a neighbour named Emms, who collected the rents for the deceased, was arrested, and
some of the stolen property was subsequently found in an outhouse. Mullins was tried,
found guilty, sentenced to death, and executed at Newgate, November 19, 1860, having,
however, first written a statement, declaring his belief that Emms was innocent.
39. THE PENGE MYSTERY GROUP, representing Patrick, Lewis, and
Mrs. Patrick Staunton.
40. CATHERINE WEBSTER,
i i • . r . 11 p 1 Jj
for the murder of Mrs. Thomas, at Richmond, under circumstances of unparalleled
atrocity. She endeavoured during her trial to incriminate other persons, but previous
to her execution confessed that she alone had committed the deed.
41. HENRY PERRY, sentenced to twenty yearn’ penal
receive thirty lashes with the cat-o -nine tails for the known o g
Underground Railway.
42. HENRY W AIN WRIGHT , executed at Newgate Dumber 12, 1875,
for the murder of Harriet Lane, at his warehouse in the Whitechapel K.oaa.
A q Tjpivy MTTT.T.'R'R (From life.) Corrected from the original cast, taken
with of Mr. Sheriff Dakin, by Dr. Donovan, of the School of
111, Strand. Franz Muller, the murderer of Mr. Bnggs in a railway carnage on the
North London Line, on Saturday, July 9, 1864, was a native of Gemany, and had
resided in London a considerable time, where he worked at his trade as • •
culprit was traced by the police to New "York, brought back, tned, an
the clearest evidence, and executed November 14, 1864.
44 TRAUPMANN, executed at Paris on January 19, 1870, for the murder of
the Kinck fairly at Rmrin , under circumstances of brutality which language cannot
describe. The family, six in number, were decoyed one by one and despatched m


detail and buried in a field. The discovery was made on September 22, 1869. The trial
lasted four days. The prisoner, on hearing his sentence, smiled and bowed to the court.
He walked to the guillotine in a most agitated manner.
45. LEFROY MAPLETON, convicted and executed for the murder of Mr.
Gold in a first-class railway carriage oh the Brighton railroad, June 20th, 1881.
46. EMANUEL BARTHfILEMY, * French refugee, whom, notwithstanding
his ferocious professions of Republicanism, other French refugees always suspected to
be in the pay of the French police, was tried and sentenced to death for the murder of
George Moore with a loaded cane, in his own house, Warren Street, Marylebone. He
died impenitent and unbelieving. 44 I don’t want forgiveness of God,” he often said,
44 1 want forgiveness of men. I want these doors to be opened.” He was executed
December 22, 1854. '
47. LUIGI BURANELLI. An Italian by birth, executed April 30, 1855, for
the murder of Joseph Latham (or Lambert), Foley Place, Marylebone, by shooting him
through the head, and also attempting to murder Mrs. Lambert, by wounding her in
the head and neck. At his trial a plea of insanity was set up, but the jury unanimously
found him guilty.
48. HARE.
49. BURKE. (The model of Burke, taken within three hours after his exe-
cution ; and that of Hare from life, in the prison of Edinburgh.) The annals of crime
can scarcely exhibit two agents equal in atrocity to the subjects of this group. Allured
by the prospects of gain held out by the professors of anatomy in Edinburgh, they
undertook to furnish from time to time a number of subjects for the practice of the
students. This practice was carried on for upwards of ten months, during which
numbers of persons disappeared in a manner that could not be accounted for. A dis-
covery was at length made; Burke was convicted on the evidence of Hare, and executed
at Edinburgh, January 27, 1829. Hare, in consideration of his having turned King’s
evidence, was again let loose upon the world.
60. GUITEAU. This miscreant, who murdered President Garfield, boasts in his
44 Autobiography,” that he descends from the famous Nicholas Guiteau, Court Physician
to Catherine de Medicis. He was bom about forty years ago in New York, of a respect-
able family. As a boy he embraced the peculiar tenets of the Oneida Creek community,
but was finally expelled. He then tried preaching, journalism, and even politics, but
everything he did failed from his lack of stability and honesty. He conceived a great
hatred of Mr. Garfield, because that gentleman would not appoint him Consul to Paris,
a position he was wholly unqualified to sustain. It was doubtless in a spirit of revenge
that the wretch assassinated the estimable President, the details of which infamy are only
too fresh in the minds of all. Executed June 30, 1882.
51. DENNIS COLLINS. He attempted the life of William IV., at Ascot
Heath races, on June 19, 1832 ; was sentenced to transportation for life, but died on the
way out to the penal settlements.
52. MARAT. (Taken immediately after his assassination, by order of the
National Assembly.) Jean Paul Marat, one of the atrocious leaders of the French
Revolution, was bom at bawdry, near Neufchatel, in Switzerland, 1744; assassinated
by Charlotte Corday on July 13, 1793.
53. THE GALLOWS.
53a* JOHN THURTELL, whose love for gambling led him to commit the
murder of Mr. Weare under circumstances of great atrocity. After his sentence to
death he designed this gallows, on which he was executed at Hertford.


Models and Relics.
54 MODEL OF THE BASTILLE.
« • t J 1 A *
surrounded by a river or moat, and mounted by cannon, which under the despotism of
successive sovereigns of France, was the scene of the most unheard-of cruellies. Among
the prisoners released at the destruction of the Bastille, were a Major White, a Scotch-
man, and the Count de Lorge, who had been confined thirty years.
55. MODEL OF STANFIELD HALL (used during the Rush trial at
Norwich), the scene of so many remarkable events and fearful crimes, and one of the
oldest manors in England. As will be remembered, in the year 1849, it was in the
possession of Mr. Jermy, whose murder, with others, by James Bloomfield Rush, under
circumstances most atrocious, is familiar to many,
66. MODEL OF MRS. EMSLEY’S HOUSE.
57 THE MODEL OF THE GUILLOTINE, from the original drawings
by Monsieur Sansom, of Paris. It may not be generally known that the amly o
Sansom were the hereditary executioners for many generations. This is an exact
model of the original guillotine, and of that which is now in use.

Heads.
HUBERT. (Taken immediately after hit the French
National Assembly.) Jacques-R6n6 was a native 9 » „ an a^us j ve
Revolution raised to consequence. As the writer ® against Queen Marie
paper, he acquired popularity ; and by and cruelty winch he had acquired
Antoinette he maintained his character for brutality an e-ni-mher In attempting
by defending the horrors of August 10, and the murders of September In
to oppose the Commune of Paris to the authority of the Convention, he drew up
himself the vengeance of Robespierre, and was guillotine


FOURQUIER TINVILLE. (Taken immediately after his execution by order
of the National Assembly.) Antonio-Quentin-Fourquier Tinville, a Frenchman of in-
famous memory, bom near St. Quentin; from a bankrupt he became the friend of
Robespierre, and so sanguinary was his conduct that he was deemed by that tyrant
worthy to be the public accuser. In this office he displayed the most vindictive
character; the young, the aged, and the innocent were hurried with insulting indif-
ference to the scaffold. In one instance, in four hours, eighty individuals were
devoted to immediate death; when one of the gaolers observed that a person before
the Tribunal was not the accused, Fourquier said with unconcern that one was as good
as another, and the victim was marched to the guillotine. His hand was not stayed by
the fall of Robespierre, and on the day of the arrest of the latter, he coolly remarked
as he affixed his signature to the condemnation of forty-two individuals : “ Ah! Robes-
pierre arrested. What does it matter ? Justice must be done ! ” Punishment came,
though late; and in November, 1794, he too was guillotined.
LOUIS XVI. AND MARIE ANTOINETTE—See Nos. 106-108.
ROBESPIERRE. (Taken immediately after his execution, in 1794, by order of
the National Assembly.) Maximilien-Isidore Robespierre, a sanguinary demagogue
during the French Revolution, was born at Arras, of poor parents, in 1759, and edu-
cated at the expense of the bishop of the diocese. After studying at Paris, he applied
himself to the law, and in 1784, obtained the prize of the Academy, at Metz, by his
discourse on the disgrace which attends the relations of criminals. At the meeting of
the Constituent Assembly, he obtained a seat, but was distinguished more by the
originality of his observations than by his eloquence. Such was the influence of this
monster, that France forgot her honour and her religion at his command. After he had
seen the altars insulted, the churches thrown down, and the public worship abolished, he
claimed the merit of restoring to the Supreme Being some share in the government of
the universe ; and appeared in the name of the Convention, as the priest of a new
religion, and decreed with great solemnity that a God existed in the world. He was
guillotined with seventy-one others on July 28, 1794. The fall of Robespiere closed
the Reign of Terror.
CARRIER. (Taken immediately after his execution by order ot the National
Assembly.) Jean-Baptiste Carrier, an infamous revolutionist, bom in 1767, was bred
up to the law, and while deputy to the National Convention was sent to La Vendee
with a number of assassins. At Nantes, he often in one day caused twenty-four
persons to be put to death, though young and innocent. After perpetrating every crime
of cruelty, lust and avarice, he was recalled, condemned to a deserved death, and
guillotined in 1794.

this great metropolis so admirably pourtrayed, and that it would hardly have been possible
for the great French artist to have found a gentleman better qualified than Mr. Blanchard
Jerrold to accompany him on his sketching pilgrimages about London, and to write lor the
book the descriptive matter. Mr. Jerrold had happily explained and elucidated the
pictures, linked them together, and appropriately rounded oft and completed the work as a
grand illustration of London as it presents itself to the artistic and to the thoughtlul mm .

IN THE BATTLE OF THIS LIFE, END’S FRUIT SALT IS AN IMPERATIVE
HYGIENIC NEED, or Necessary Adjunct; it keeps the blood pure, prevents fevers, and acute
inflammatory diseases, and removes the injurious effects arising from stimulants and narcotics, such
as alcohol, tobacco, tea, and coffee. By natural means it thus restores the nervous system to its normal
condition, by preventing the great danger of poisoned blood and over cerebral activity, nervousness
irritability, worry, &c.
PALPITATION OF THE HEART, caused by Liver Derangement and Indigestion, frequently
called (or mistaken for) HEART DISEASE “On the 14th of April I purchased a bottle of
your FRUIT SALT, not feeling very well at the time, and it had an effect that I never anticipated
I bought it. I had suffered more or less since the year 1841 from Palpitation of the Heart, but
when
H
very badly during the last few years. The least tiling would produce it during the day, and at night my
sleep was very much disturbed. Strange to say, after the first dose of FRUIT SALT Palpitations
suddenly ceased, and have not since returned. Out of gratitude for the benefit which I have received, I
have recommended it to all my friends both in London and Yarmouth; at the same time, I feel it a
duty to state the above facts, of which you can make whatever use you please.—l am, dear Sir vours
respectfully, Truth.” 7
OW TO PREVENT THREE GREAT SCOURGES OF LIFE—CONSUMPTION,
. BLOOD POISONS, AND EPIDEMICS—by pleasant, simple, and natural metfihs.
In an able paper published in the pages of the British Medical Journal, Dr. W. R. Ross states
that liver derangement almost invariably precedes Consumption. By using the FRUIT SALT the blood
*?keptpure (ty natural means), and the deposit of poisonous matter in the lungs prevented. ENO’S
FRUIT SALT is particularly valuable. No traveller should leave home without a supply, for by its
use the most dangerous forms of fever, gouty, rheumatic, and other blood poisons, very often causing
apoplexy, heart disease, and sudden death, &c., are prevented and cured. ENO’S FRUIT SALT is
one of Nature’s own products. It contains all the valuable saline constituents of Ripe Fruit in a portable,
agreeable, and simple form, and is in every respect as harmless as the juices of fruits from which it is
obtained. In Pimples and Blotches on the Face, Sallowness of the Skin, and Depression of Spirits,
Euious Headaches, Wind or I latulence, Constipation, Heartburn, &c., it is most useful, for not the least
of its recommendations is its resemblance to fruit in the natural way in which it relieves the system of
effete and poisonous matter (the groundwork of fevers and other dangerous diseases), which, if retained,
poisons the blood, and its advantage over fruit is that it can be always at hand when required. Its pre-
paration has been truly styled one of the triumphs of modern chemistry. In hot or foreign climates it is
m valuable. b
QUCCESS IN LIFE.”— A new invention is brought before the public, and commands success. A
KJ score of abominable imitations are immediately introduced by the unscrupulous, who, in copying

profit.— Adams. r

Dbab Sib,—We congratulate you upon
the widespread reputation this justly-
esteemed medicine has earned for
itself all over the East. As a remedy
of general utility, we much question
whether a better is imported, and we
shall be glad to hear of its finding j
place in every Anglo-Indian home. Th
other brands, we are happy to say, are
now relegated to thd native bazaars,
We have never used any other form
of this medicine than Collis Browne’s,
from a firm conviction that it is deci-
dedly the best, and also from a sense of
duty we owe to the profession and the
public, as we are of opinion that the
substitution of any other than Collis
Browne’s is a deliberate breach of faith
on the part of the chemist to prescribes
and patient alike.—We are, Sir, faith-
fully yours, SYMES & CO., Members of
the Pharm. Society of Great Britain , Ets

of the Cabana Cigar Co. in the
shape of a brand of cigars known as
‘EI Precio Princessas/ and con-
sidering the quality of the tobacco
from which they are manufactured
(which we consider excellent), the
price is absurdly low.”

Tobacco says:—“A good foreign
cigar at a low price is a luxury sighed
for by thousands. The Cabana
Cigar Co. are supplying a cigar
under the name of ‘EI Precio
Princessas/ at ns. per 100, which
should meet the requirements of
the million, which for delicacy of
aroma can vie with the numerous
brands on the market.”
The American Traveller says
“Those who appreciate a good cigar
should not fail to visit the Cabana
Cigar Co. Among the specialities
supplied by them are their well-
known ‘ El Precio Princessas/ and
the remarkably low price at which
these cigars are sold should not fail
to create an immense demand.
