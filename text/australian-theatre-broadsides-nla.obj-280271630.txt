A “BOOM” IN GRANUMA.
The sudden and great demand for Granuma
has been somewhat of a surprise to us, and
we have now to apologise for delayed delivery
in some instances. The incoming week will en-
able us to overcome all difficulties, and our good
friends must be a little patient in the meantime.
The Public has evidently recognised the value
of Granuma as a natural food. Being a natural
Food, it is therefore an absolute cure for indi-
gestied. It will not work miracles, but where
there is no organic disease, when all prejudicial
habits are dropped and the ordinary rules of
health observed, we can guarantee the cure of
the worst form of dyspepsia and all kindred dis-
orders. Besides this, Qranuma is a delicate,
pleasant food that everyone enjoys, from the
baby to the centenarian. TRY A 41b.PACKET

An editor’ wrote a leading article on
the fair sex, in the course of which he
said, Girls of seventeen or eighteen are

that an unfortunate typographical error
had made him say, “ Girls of seventeen

THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT.
“WHAT THE PAPERS SAY.”
“ The very greatest ingenuity and
enterprise have been brought to bare to
provide beautiful and astonishing tab-
leaux. The building of the house is
an exceedingly clever and most original
idea in stagecraft.” S. M. Herald.
“ A distinctly successful pantomime,
full of novel and beautiful effects. The
staging is of the best, the acting of the
ladies and gentlemen in the cast spirited,
the music lively and taking. The cos-
tumes are superb.” —Daily Telegraph.
“ Mr. Rignold has a bigger claim than
■ever on public favour. The enthusiasm
with which “ The House that Jack
Built” was received indicates that it is
going to be one of the chief attractions
of the holidays. The piece is gorgeously
mounted. The Fire Ballet is splendidly
effective.” —Diverting News.
“ Mr. Rignold has paid the strictest
attention to the minutest detail. Every-
thing has been carried out on a scale of
magnificence; the elaborate ballets are
faultlessly executed. The Fire Ballet
two wonderful to be described, and is
certainly one of the strongest effects yet
contrived in Australia.” — Star.
“ Mr. Geo. Rignold has done many
good things in the way of pantomime
but it is doubtful if he has hitherto
given the public any one which is
throughout so good as “ The House that
Jack Built.” There is not a dull mo-
ment.” —Sydney Hail.
Smoking does not agree with every-
body, but York’s Musical Instruments
do.
“ If there is one time more than ano-
ther,” says an experienced married man,
“ when a woman should be left entirely
alone, it is when a line full of clothes
comes down in the mud.”
We are constantly sampling some new Sum-
mer beveridge, something to neutralise the
exhausting effects of a hot climate, something
to put one straight, something to revive a
Corpse, but of all the strengtheners, straight-
ened and corpse revivers, there is nothing to
equal that popular nutriment called Bovril.
It will neither go to your head, nor your legs
but will fill a stomach vacuum equal to a
whole counter lunch.
The man who had “an iron will” ap-
pointed a blacksmith as his executor.
Bathing is often answerable for aural
dincase when ducking the head is prac-
ticed. It should be born in mind that
the ear is in tolerate of cold water.
An Irish Magistrate, censuring some
boys for loitering in the streets, asked,
“ If everybody were to stand in the
sti cuts, how could anybody get by P”
The happy medium —gentleman be-
tween two ladies.
The moral effect of being well-dressed
was shown in the answer of a child who
was asked why she wasn’t as good as a
little girl of her acquaintance. “ Per-
haps 1 should he quite as good,” she
answered, “if my dress had little pink
bows all over it.”
The only witness of geographical
knowledge the Shall has in his palace at
Teheran is a 12-inch globe, upon which
the parts of the world are set out in
jewels of various colours —England with
rubies, India with diamonds, and the
sea with emeralds.

A young lady of New York, who is
partially deaf, is in the habit of saying
‘ Yes ’ to everything when a gentleman
is talking to her, for fear he might pro-
pose to her and she did not hear it.
“ I do love dress !” exclaimed a young
society belle. —“ Then I should think you
would wear more of it,” replied a cynical
bachelor.
“Why, Uncle Dewlittle, how dew you
dew ? Come in and rest a little while,
dew. How does Hannah dew, and what
is she dewing ? Dew tell us all the
news. Come, dew sit down to the table
and dew as we dew ; help yourself; dew
talk now, and dew not make me dew all
the talking, for I sha’n’t dew it. Now
dew dew something, dew.”
An Alabama editor mildly alludes to
his rival as “ a reservoir of falsehood
and an aqueduct of mendacity.”
In order to keep up with the progress
of the age, Time is said to have aban-
doned the scythe and hour-glass and
purchased a mowing-machine and a
watch.
“ I go through my work,” reprovingly
said the needle to the idle boy. : —“ But
not till you’re pushed through,” triump-
hantly replied the boy to the needle.
Mistress : I don’t want you to have so
much company. You have more callers
in a day than I have in a week.” Domes-
tic; “ Well, mum, perhaps if you’d tried
to bp a little more agreeable, you’d have
as many friends as I have.”
PEMELL’S
“ A.8.C.” Granulated
WHEAT MEAL.
Unexpected. —A German settler in
Ohio, found guilty of selling liquor con-
trary to law, and sentenced to be im-
prisoned in the county gaol for thirty
days, protested as follows : —“ Chail
Go to chail ! Me go to chail! But I can’t
go ! Dere’s my piziness,—my pakery.
Who bakes my bread when I ben gone P”
Then casting his eyes about the court,
appealingly, they fell upon the good-
natured face of jolly Chris Ellwaner, a
fellow-countryman, wbo had no “ pizi-
ness,” and forthwith a brilliant idea
occurred to kim. Turning to the judge,
he said, in sober earnest, “ Dere’s Chris
Ellwaner ! He’s got nothing to do ; send
him !”
“ It is a great misery,” says La Bru-
yere, “to have neither enough wit to
talk well, nor enough judgment to keep
quiet.” But the misery is oftenest the
experience of the other fellows.
Two young carpenters, named respec-
tively Robert Brown and Thomas Jones,
were very fond of dropping into Mr.
Smith’s parlour and spending an hour
or two with his only daughter Mary.
One evening, when Brown and Mary
had discussed almost every topic, Brown
suddenly, in his sweetest tones, struck
out as follows : —“ Do you think, Mary,
you could leave father and mother, and
this pleasant home, with all its ease and
comforts, and emigrate to the Far West
with a young carpenter, who has but
little besides his strong hands to depend
upon, and with him search out a new
home which should be your joint duty
to beautify, and make delightful and
happy like this ?” Dropping her head
softly on his shoulders, she whispered
—“I think I could, Robert.” “ Well,”
said he, “ there’s Tom Jones, who’s
going to emigrate, and wants to get a
wife; I’ll mention it to him.”

THE SONG- OF THE PRESS.
With fingers weary and thin,
With eyelids heavy and red,
An editor sat in his high-backed chair
When he ought to have been in bed.
Write, Write, Write,
’Mid ink, and paste, and mess,
And then, in a voice that had once been bright,
He sang the “ Song of the Press.”
Write, write, write,
Till his head begins to swim,
And write, write, write.
Till he achs in every limb.
Ink, paper, and pens,
Pens, paper, and ink,
And a thirst that is burning his glottis out—
But his screw won’t run to a drink.
Oh ! men with sweethearts who read,
Oh ! mothers-in-law and wives,
It isn’t the papers you eagerly take,
But human editors’ lives.
Write, write, write,
Till he really can’t see any more.
And his head sinks ’low on the desk below
With a loud and sonorous snore.
Write, write, write,
From early morn till late,
And write, write write,
At a supernatural rate.
It’s oh, to be out on the main !
Away on the sea for a blow.
But there’ll be no fun in his weary life
Till he’s sent where all editors go.
With fingers weary and thin,
With eyelids heavy and red,
The editor sat in his high-backed chair
When he ought to have been in bed.
Write, write, write,
’Mid ink, and paste, and mess,
And, still in a voice that had once been
bright—
Would that its tones had been gay and light!
He sang this “ Song of the Press.” —Judy

The discover}' of the process of tinting
white paper was the result of sheer care-
lessness on the part of the wife of a
paper maker, who accidently dropp'd
shrieked out, “ Let it drop !”
“ Now, my little boys and girls,” said
a teacher, “ I want you to be very still,
so that you can hear a pin drop.” In a
moment all was silent, when a little boy I

absent-minded that he knocked at his
own door, when the servant, not recog-

Lessing, composedly walking away, ‘‘ I

A travelling man dining at a restaur-
ant ordered a boiled chicken for his din-
ner. It was placed before him, ajad he
tried in vain to make an incision with his
knife and fork. Turning to the girl who
had waited on him, he said, “ I was here
five years ago and ordered a chicken for
dinner.” “ Oh, yes,” answered the girl,
flippantly. “ I remember. It was I who
waited on you.” “ How strange,” re-
marked the man in a low, awe-struck
tone. “ Why is it strange? ” inquired
the girl. “ It’s more than strange, it’s
wonderful such a coincidence could
hardly happen twice —same girl, same
chicken,” and he looked reverently at the
specimen before him, while the girl
made a hasty retreat.
