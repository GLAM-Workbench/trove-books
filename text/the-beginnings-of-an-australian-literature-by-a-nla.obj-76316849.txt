PREFACE
This discourse on The Beginnings of an Australian
Literature was delivered at South Place Institute,
London, on Sunday afternoon, March 27th, as one
of a series of lectures on ? Greater Britain ? subjects.
An excellent and almost verbatim report appeared
in the British Australasian of March 31st, but
numbers of persons interested in the development
of colonial culture have been kind enough to sug-
gest to me that a separate publication might be
helpful as a means of familiarising the British public
with the names and work of the ?few writers who
reflect the life, describe the scenery, and reveal the
social conditions of Australia.?
In consenting to the publication of this lecture,
I wish distinctly to state that it is in no sense an
exhaustive (and, I trust, not an exhausting) ex-
position of the subject. Much might have been
added on the more serious and philosophical writers,
such as the late Dr. Hearn and Professor Pearson,
whose speculations were largely influenced by their
colonial environment and experiences. But my


PREFACE
object was to deal merely with the belles-lettres?
with the little, scanty band of prose-writers and
verse-men who, preserving the literary traditions
and culture of the mother-land, under novel con-
ditions and circumstances, have been laying the
foundations of a fresh branch of English literature
in this far-off Austral world.
As the publicist who first introduced Adam
Lindsay Gordon to the knowledge of English
readers, I hope I am not presumptuous in claim-
ing for the most popular of Australian verse-
writers a distinct place among the poets of our time.
There is, at all events, every sign of his growing
fame and ever-widening popularity. Gordon would
now appear to occupy an envied place in the affec-
tions not only of Australians, but of those poetry-
loving Britons, who are at the same time men of
adventure and travel, and whose hearts throb with
pride of race and true patriotism, I venture to
hope that the estimate here given of Adam Lindsay
Gordon, and the view taken of his sad, but not
ignoble career, may prove acceptable to all who have
grown to love the Bush Ballads and Galloping
Rhymes.

THE BEGINNINGS OF AN AUSTRALIAN
LITERATURE
In the strict logical sense of the words, there is?
and there can be ?no such thing as Australian
literature; any more than there can be a South
African, a Canadian, or even an American literature.
Should some free and enlightened citizen of the
United States feel outraged by this assertion, let
him calmly consider for a moment the case of the
Ancient Greeks. That wonderful race, it will be
admitted, were our supreme guides as well as fore-
runners in civilisation, our superiors in the science
of colonisation, and our masters in the art of
literature and all other arts.
From a small centre about the size of Yorkshire,
or the Scottish Lowlands, the Greek spread his ex-
quisite language, his beautiful creeds, his arts, his
commerce, and his warlike arms from the Pillars
of Hercules to the Sea of Azof. He converted the
Mediterranean into a Greek lake, and his colonies
extended from Massilia ?the modern French city of
Marseilles ?and from the coasts of Africa on the
west, to those extensive and troubled lands which
we call Asia Minor on the east.


THE BEGINNINGS OF AN
Even under the subsequent Roman dominion,
Greek remained the literary language of the civilised
world. St. Paul?s very Epistle to the Romans, as
well as the rest of the sacred books on which the
Christian religion is based, was written, not in the
local tongue of Judea, nor in that of Imperial Rome,
but in the language of Greece. The whole of the
seven apostolic churches of Christendom arose in
what were Greek Asiatic colonies, and the speech
and culture of this marvellous people long outlived
the political downfall of the mother-country.
But, when we speak of Greek literature, we do
not narrow the phrase to the works of those writers
born and bred within the circumscribed area of
Greece itself. According to tradition, Homer, the
first of Greek poets, was an lonian colonist of Asia
Minor; so, too, Herodotus, the father of history,
and Sappho, the first and greatest of Greek poetesses,
were ?colonial? Greeks. It is as though Shake-
speare had been born in Sydney, or Bacon in San
Francisco.
It should never be forgotten that the United States
of America, though politically independent ?at times,
I fear, hostile?are still, in the old Greek sense,
England?s greatest colony. The Greek colonies, in
fact, generally began their career with a declaration
of independence, but they remained Greek just the
same. As Carlyle put it (speaking of England and
America), ?we are both alike the subjects of King
Shakespeare!? Longfellow?or Walt Whitman?
in so far as he is a genuine poet and has produced


AUSTRALIAN LITERATURE
verse that appeals to us by sincerity of thought and
beauty of form, is equally with Tennyson one of
the glories of our common English literature, and
it matters not a whit that the one should have
been born and bred in Old England, and the other
in New England.
But it is convenient to speak of ? American ?
authors and 4 American ? literature; and in that
spirit, when I use the phrase 4 Australian literature,?
I mean the works of those few writers who reflect
the life, describe the scenery, and reveal the social
conditions of Australia. If these writings should
be found to appeal to the critical judgment and to
touch the. higher emotions of our widely-scattered
race, they must, in due course of time, take their
place among the permanent treasures of English
literature. I regret very much that I shall not
have the pride and pleasure of bringing under your
notice an Australian Homer or Sappho?these
Greek 4 colonials? are altogether high as the heavens
above us. In fact, I remember Sir Charles Dilke
once saying that the only real book of genius yet
produced in a British colony is Olive Schreiner?s
Story of an African Farm. That may be so,
although I think Sir Charles Dilke, contrary to his
custom, makes here a somewhat too sweeping
assertion. I trust, at any rate, before I conclude,
to have shown that the English settlers in Australia
have, at least, made a 4 beginning,? and may even
now claim a place in the ranks of English letters
and culture.


THE BEGINNINGS OF AN
I would, however, at the outset, like to point out
that a good deal of sheer nonsense is habitually
talked, both at home and in the colonies, on such
subjects as Australian literature and colonial genius.
I read the other day the report of an address in
which a colonial lady boldly proclaimed Mrs. Hum-
phry Ward to be the bright particular star in this
Australian literary galaxy. Mrs. Ward, the grand-
daughter of the famous Dr. Arnold, of Rugby, and
niece of the late Matthew Arnold, is, by the accident
of birth, a Tasmanian. She was born at Hobart,
from which town, at the early age of five, she was
taken to England. But what has Tasmania or
Australia to do with Robert Elsmere or David
Grievel These well-known works are English
novels of the day, which have achieved a vast
popular success, though whether that success be
lasting time alone can show.
My point is that Mrs. Humphry Ward, despite
her birthplace, has nothing whatever to do with
Australian literature.
A gifted and very charming Irish lady?a valued
friend of my own?a few years ago accompanied her
husband, an English doctor, to Melbourne, and while
resident in that city wrote A Yellow Aster, which,
on her return to London, she published, under the
nom de plume ?lota.? Mrs. Caffyn is, therefore, at
once pounced upon as ?an Australian novelist.?
What has A Yellow Aster to do with Australia,
or Australian letters ? Absolutely nothing! How-
ever, unlike her colonial-born sister-novelist, who


AUSTRALIAN LITERATURE
can know nothing personally of Australia, Mrs.
Caffyn can, if it please her, utilise her colonial ex-
periences, and being a woman of literary ability, and
with that rare gift in her sex?an original vein of
humour?she may yet produce some work which
will entitle her to rank among the founders of this
still unformed school of Australian fiction.
All this wild and foolish kind of talk about
Australian genius and colonial poets and novelists
is as though one should dub the Marquis of Salisbury,
because his lordship happened to visit a certain
famous gold-field at the time of the first rush, in
the early fifties, ?the great Bendigo statesman.?
Having, tried to show what I do not mean by
that Australian literature, of which I fancy I can
trace the beginnings, it is full time that I should
come to close quarters with my subject, and show
what I do mean.
The late Marcus Clarke, in his fine preface to the
collected poems of Adam Lindsay Gordon, makes a
significant critical remark. ?The student,? he says,
?of these unpretending volumes will be repaid for
his labour. He will find in them something very
like the beginnings of a national school of Australian
poetry.?
He who wrote these words was, in my opinion,
not only the best all-round man of letters that
Australia can yet boast, but the only first-class
literary critic in the colonies who thought it worth
his while to devote any serious attention to the


THE BEGINNINGS OF AN
works of local writers. Marcus Clarke was inti-
mately acquainted with all that had been done, both
in prose and verse, by the earlier generation of colo-
nists. But he was a man of letters and a critic, not
an antiquary or a stamp-collector. He knew quite
as well as Professor Dryasdust that a certain pre-
historic Sydney judge, Barron Field, the friend and
correspondent of Charles Lamb, had scribbled some
lines on a kangaroo before Adam Lindsay Gordon
was born; only Clarke considered the 4 Lines on a
Kangaroo ? merely a quaint piece of doggerel verse,
and not ?the beginnings of a national school of
poetry,? or of anything else. Also, while proclaim-
ing his friend Gordon to be the pioneer of Australian
poetry, he knew perfectly well that Charles Harpur
had written fairly good sonnets and still better
Australian descriptive verse long before Gordon
ever dreamt that such a country as Australia
existed. Since Mr. Douglas Sladen devoted his
boundless energy to the compilation of Australian
anthologies?a labour for which, in my opinion, he
deserves far more thankful recognition than he has
received ?Charles Harpur has attracted some faint
amount of attention, both in England and America,
as the Chaucer (in point of time) of Australia I Mr.
Alfred Miles, in his Poets and Poetry of the Century ,
includes Harpur, and gives some specimens of his
verse, as does Mr. Edmund Clarence Stedman, the
well-known American poet and critic, in his superb
Victorian Anthology , recently brought out in New
York.


AUSTRALIAN LITERATURE
Charles Harpur was born as far back as 1817,
in the bush township of Windsor, New South Wales,
and spent almost his whole life among the lonesome
primeval gum-trees and the rough human surround-
ings of that locality. ?He was,? writes his admiring
disciple, the poet, Henry Kendall, ?a son of the
forest, a man of the backwoods, a dweller in un-
quiet and uncouth country, and his songs are ac-
cordingly saturated with the strange, fitful music
of waste broken-up places.?
In my opinion, it is the utter absence of this
? strange, fitful music ? which prevents Harpur from
being the actual founder of an Australian school of
poetry, and ?despite the efforts of the antholo-
gists?leaves him a mere name, and nothing more I
You might wander from one end of Australia to
the other and mix with every class of society,
without hearing a line of Harpur quoted. His
bush descriptions, faithful enough in the main, have
none of the music of Henry Kendall?s, beside whose
melodious lyrics Harpur reads like so much dis-
jointed prose.
Harpur?s successor, Henry Clarence Kendall, was
also a native of New South Wales, and although he
survived Adam Lindsay Gordon by some years, he
and the author of the Bush Ballads and Galloping
Rhymes were actual contemporaries, and they may
be regarded as the first writers of verse in Australia
who made any real impression on the public.
Mr. Douglas Sladen, who has devoted a great
deal of attention to the study of Kendall, considers


THE BEGINNINGS OF AN
?and I think rightly ?that as a bush landscape
painter, Kendall, who was native and to the manner
born, is a truer and more delicate artist than Gordon,
who was Australian only by adoption.
Though I should be the last to detract from the
well-deserved local fame of Henry Kendall, many
of whose poems ?such as * September in Australia,?
? The Grave of Leichardt,? ? At Euroma ??will always
be admired in the land of their birth, I still hold with
Marcus Clarke that Adam Lindsay Gordon, if only
by reason of his stronger Byronic personality, and
the much more profound human feeling in his writ-
ings, is the true pioneer poet of Australia.
But before I speak at any length on Gordon and
his Bush Ballads and Galloping Rhymes , it will be
more according to the sequence of events if I attempt
to unfold the origin and beginning of the Australian
novel.
Prose fiction is generally held to be the charac-
teristic form of literary expression of the Victorian
era as the acted drama in blank verse was of the
Elizabethan era. Our novel in prose takes the
place of their five-act play in verse ! We loiter
through our play 4 by our own fireside, as Sir
William Harcourt would say, whereas our vigorous
forefathers sweltered or froze in the playhouse pit
to get the gist of theirs.
Shakespeare, we are told, had he lived in the
present time, would have catered for Mr. Mudie?s
subscribers. From the standpoint of those sub-


AUSTRALIAN LITERATURE
scribers, I can only say that if this be so, they
have a perpetual grievance! Certainly the novel
dominates the modern bookshelf; but God forbid
that we should regard the ordinary novel as having
any necessary connection with Literature. One
might just as well consider a row of jerry-built
suburban villas as having some relationship to the
art of Architecture. These modern novels, as a rule,
are jerry-built indeed; constructed to sell, if haply
they do not fall to pieces before the purchaser
appear. For all that, prose fiction, from the days
of Sir Walter Scott to our own, has been the one
form of literary art that appeals to a really wide
public. Amid the immense heaps of rubbish that
are daily turned out from our teeming presses,
we come every now and again upon the work of a
true artist in fiction ; a novelist who can portray for
us human life, who can give us actual transcripts
of human society, who is a master of the difficult
arts of narration and description, and who possesses,
it may be, the supreme Shakespearian gift of humour!
Such a writer, though his medium be but the barren
prose of our epoch, will produce lasting work, genuine
literature.
Regarding fiction as an art, let us ask, Has Aus-
tralia yet produced, or inspired, any work of lasting
importance, any novel which shows us the actual
phases of colonial life in these remote new settle-
ments ?
Before we can answer this question, it is necessary
to have some picture in our minds of what we mean
Ti jy


THE BEGINNINGS OF AN
by Australia as a community, or, I should say, as a
set of communities; for Australia, young as she is,
has already passed through three or four distinct
epochs. First of all, there was what may be called
the Convict Epoch.
Captain Cook having discovered the country, Pitt
and his political successors determined to make it
a kind of huge over-the-sea prison reformatory. So
we had a ?society? in New South Wales and Van
Dieman?s Land almost without a parallel in ancient
or modern times. Following very sharply on this,
and indeed mingling with it at first, came the
Pastoral or Patriarchal Epoch. And this was suc-
ceeded in turn by the Gold Era, heralding, and,
in fact, creating, the present widespread Australian
Democracy.
With regard to that early criminal period, we have
in Marcus Clarke?s powerful but revolting story, For
the Term of His Natural Life , a work of singular, I
may say of cold-blooded, power, which is actually
based in the main on official papers regarding the
early penal settlements in Van Dieman?s Land. This
book must always occupy a foremost position, per-
haps I should say a unique position, in Australian
literature. It can never be superseded or rewritten.
It was when Clarke was completing its final revision
that I first made his acquaintance in Melbourne,
and I remember, as a youth, being struck by the
immense amount of labour which he bestowed on
the gruesome details of this terrible tale. He told
me that when he went over to Tasmania on a visit


AUSTRALIAN LITERATURE
in order to see with his own eyes Port Arthur, he
was shown at Government House the unpublished
ms. diary of a prison chaplain named Rogers. Readers
of His Natural Life will remember the strangely
pathetic figure of the Rev. James North and the
frequent extracts from the diary of this weak, sore-
distressed, pitiable, and yet not unlovable man. All
this portion of the book was an actual transcript
from the diary??written up,? so to speak?which
Clarke found in the archives of Government House,
Hobart. And sad as it is, I thought, when re-reading
the book the other day, that these pathetic pages
about the Rev. James North are almost the only
portion of the book not calculated to give a sensitive
reader the horrors.
Such chapters in His Natural Life as those
headed * One Hundred Lashes,? and the absolutely
horrible one called ?The Valley of the Shadow of
Death ? ?to my mind the most revolting thing in
English fiction?are almost too ghastly to dwell
upon. But if you ever want to meet a man who
really enjoys horrors, you should always search
amongst professional jokers and comedians. I was
not at all surprised, therefore, to find, in an in-
terview with a colonial reporter in Sydney, that
Mark Twain gave expression to his intense ad-
miration of His Natural Life , and to his especial
delight in the repulsive character of Gabbett, the
convict-cannibal. His Natural Life has also proved
a rare solace to another recent antipodean tourist
Mr. Michael Davitt.


THE BEGINNINGS OF AN
No single book, unless it be Gordon?s Bush
Ballads , occupies the same position in the popular
estimation of Australians as this powerful story.
It has been read all over Australia, and dramatised
and acted in all the chief cities and bush townships.
Yet I remember vividly my own feelings when,
many years ago, I first read His Natural Life. I
confess that those feelings were largely made up of
regret ?a kind of patriotic regret ?that a man so
gifted as Clarke should have devoted such an im-
mense amount of labour to this compendium of
crime. It seemed to me a hard thing, too, that the
free and untainted population of Australia, which
has had no connection with those terrible times of
Port Arthur and Norfolk Island, should have this
national stigma recorded in indelible ink. And I
remember expressing these sentiments to Marcus
Clarke himself, and suggesting that as he had spent
a couple of years on an ?up-country? station, he
should write another novel dealing with what I
have called the ?Pastoral Epoch? ?the period of
the pioneer squatters. When we next met, Clarke
took me aside and said, ? The thing you suggest?
the writing of a novel describing the life of that
splendid body of men, mostly gentlemen and
younger sons, who were the real pioneers of this
colony ?has been already done. Henry Kingsley
did it once for all in Geoffrey Hamlyn ! ?
The Recollections of Geoffrey Hamlyn was written,
or rather published, by Henry Kingsley, brother of
the more famous Charles Kingsley, on his return to


AUSTRALIAN LITERATURE
England after a five years? sojourn in Australia, in
1859 ?nearly forty years ago! With the companion
book, The Hillyars and Burtons , it contains the
best permanent literary record in the form of
fiction of what I have termed the Pastoral Epoch
of Australia. And from these two books, which, of
course, were written many years before His Natural
Life (though they deal with a later phase of the
country?s social development), we may trace the
actual beginnings of an Australian school of fiction.
I do not propose to make any careful analysis or
elaborate criticism of these well-known novels, es-
pecially as they are just now very accessible, having
been lately republished in London under the com-
petent editorship of Mr. Clement Shorter. This
fact itself ought to be sufficient to show that I am
not overstating the claims of Henry Kingsley to a
place in the permanent literature of the country;
for how few novels, after an interval of forty years,
are ever heard of again, much less reissued in a
popular and attractive form, and with the editorial
care befitting a classic.
Concerning Geoffrey Hamlyn and the Hillyars and
Burtons , Mr. Clement Shorter makes this true and
pertinent remark: ? Henry Kingsley alone among
novelists has focussed for us in two of these books
the early life of a new country, the first building-up
of a great Commonwealth. His name must be writ
large indeed in the annals of Australia; and in the
Old Country there are critics of diverse tastes ?
critics like Mr. Swinburne, Mr. James Payn, Mr.


THE BEGINNINGS OF AN
Andrew Lang, Mr. Augustine Birrell who are
united in appreciation of Geoffrey Hamlyn .?
I am sorry to say that so far as my personal
experience goes, Geoffrey Hamlyn is not nearly so
widely read in Australia as it deserves. For ten
persons who have read His Natural Life , there is
not one who would be found familiar with the
characters and episodes of this fascinating story of
early squatting life.
Among Australians no one has more warmly
appreciated Geoffrey Hamlyn than Henry Kingsley?s
foremost living disciple, the well-known Australian
writer, Mr. Thomas Alexander Browne, who, under
the name of ?Rolf Boldrewood,? has produced in
recent years a series of very entertaining and
attractive bush stories.
If you would really enjoy the true flavour of
Kingsley?s two fine novels, I would strongly advise
you, first of all, to read a little book by ?Rolf
Boldrewood,? entitled Old Melbourne Memories ?
which, not being a work of fiction, is likely to be
overlooked. I read these sketches of the ? Old
Colonial Days,? as Gordon fondly called them?the
? Days before the gold ? ?as the early squatters used
to say ?a dozen or more years ago; and nothing
that ?Rolf Boldrewood? has since done has given
me quite so much pleasure. The title, Old Mel-
bourne Memories , is a misnomer; the book should
have been called In the Days of the District or
Old Provincial Days, for ? Rolf Boldrewood ? here
describes the ? up-country ? social life among the


AUSTRALIAN? LITERATURE
delightful sheep and cattle stations of the Western
District of what is now the colony of Victoria, but
which was then the Port Phillip province of the
mother-colony ?New South Wales. In Old Mel-
bourne Memories , you will see the actual records of
these early pastoral settlers, whom Henry Kingsley
turns to such brilliant account in Geoffrey Hamlyn
and the Hillyars and Burtons. One feels that
they must have been about as fine a set of well-bred,
high-spirited gentlemen as ever were raised in this
wonderful little Britain of ours. These adventurous
younger sons were irresistibly attracted to the newly-
discovered pastoral runs in Port Phillip by Sir
Thomas Mitchell?s account of his memorable ex-
ploration journey across what he termed ? Australia
Felix.? They found large tracts of virgin territory,
admirably adapted for flocks arid herds, and in the
matter of labour they had at hand the pick of the
huge convict population, who were let out as ser-
vants and workmen on a system of ticket-of-leave
by the Sydney Government.
No one has given a truer picture of these pioneer
squatters, whom Henry Kingsley has immortalised
in Geoffrey Hamlyn , than Sir Charles Gavan Duffy
in an article entitled ? Port Phillip : A Preliminary
Chapter in the Political History of Victoria,? which
I had the honour of publishing for him in the Mel-
bourne Review (October 1876), then under my
editorship. Sir Charles writes: ?To estimate this
community by its numbers alone would give a very
inadequate gauge of its power and resources. Every


THE BEGINNINGS OF AN
fifth man you met had done some successful work.
He had made a prosperous business, or reclaimed
and fenced wild land, or imported valuable stock,
or explored new country, or at lowest had built a
house and planted an orchard and vineyard, when
orchards and vineyards were in effect nurseries for
the whole community.
?These early settlers were trained by the nature
of their pursuits to frank, fearless lives, at a time
when men travelled with no other guide than the
firmament, and the landmarks of nature, and no
protector but their right hands. Highways or
bridges and punts there were none; and houses of
entertainment in the Bush were far apart; but
hospitality was universal, and if there were no
question of their ?rights,? of which they were as
jealous as Alabama planters, these big-bearded, sun-
burned men were pleasant hosts and good fellows;
and for any adequate public need would have
furnished such soldiers as rode after Stonewall
Jackson.?
This, then, was the community, and this, so to
speak, the raw material out of which Henry Kingsley
worked up the Australian chapters of his two great
novels. He himself went out to Australia a few
years later than this glorious early pastoral period.
He went out fresh from Oxford, with two young
friends, in 1853, to seek his fortune on the gold-
fields. As might have been expected, he found no
nuggets, and was altogether an unsuccessful colonist.
Despairing of making his fortune on the gold-fields,


AUSTRALIAN LITERATURE
he drifted into the Mounted Police, a post which
he is said to have resigned on account of the
horror he felt at having to attend the execution
of a criminal.
It is a somewhat singular fact, that Gordon,
whom Marcus Clarke ranks as the founder of
Australian poetry, and Henry Kingsley, whom I
consider to be the founder of Australian fiction,
should both have been Mounted Policemen. Aus-
tralian literature, it would therefore seem, originated
not in the student?s library, but in the trooper?s
saddle.
There can be no doubt that, judged by the
ordinary worldly standards, Henry Kingsley was,
as Mr. Shorter declares, ?on the whole a failure.?
After his return to England he married and
wrote half-a-dozen or more novels, in most of
which may be found evidence that he possessed
in a high degree the true genius of the story-
teller.
But Henry Kingsley was completely overshadowed
by the brilliant success and European fame achieved
by his elder brother, who was novelist, romancist,
poet, historian, social reformer, and theologian, all in
one. It is singular that the very name of Henry
Kingsley should be completely ignored in the well-
known Life and Letters of Charles Kingsley. ? And
yet,? adds Mr, Clement Shorter, 4 it is not too much
to say that when time has softened his memory for
us, as it has softened for us the memory of Marlowe
and Burns, and of many another, the public interest


THE BEGINNINGS OF AN
in Henry Kingsley will be stronger than that in his
now more famous brother.? 1
Australians, in my opinion, ought to be in the
very forefront of this movement, to render some
measure of tardy justice to this too-long neglected
novelist. Australia, indeed, owes a real debt of
gratitude to the brilliant young Englishman who,
in those far-off years, settled for a while in the bush,
and in that time learned to love and appreciate the
country almost better than any ? native-born ? writer
I could mention. Save for Henry Kingsley, no
enduring literary record would have come down
to us of those early pioneer settlers, who are the
true founders of the present Australian common-
wealth.
In Geoffrey Handy n and the Hillyars and Bur-
tons we may see these men in their habit as they
lived; and I would add that in the hands of this
gifted romancer the Australian women and girls of
those early times are as faithfully and beautifully
presented as are the old pioneer squatters themselves
and their sturdy sons.
These two books should be in every Australian
library, and certainly no squatter of the present day
should fail to have his Henry Kingsley on his
shelves, if only for the benefit of the inquiring
1 Mr. Louis Becke would doubtless assert that Dr. George Kingsley,
the youngest brother of this gifted family, should not be ignored. It
was Dr. Kingsley who accompanied the late Earl of Pembroke on his
antipodean voyages, and wrote in conjunction with him that delightfully
amusing book of travel. South Sea Bubbles, by the Earl and the Doctor.


AUSTRALIAN LITERATURE
English globe-trotter, who may be desirous of
knowing how Australia as a community has been
evolved.
Kingsley?s most popular disciple and follower is
4 Rolf Boldrewood,? whose novels of bush life and
incidents have achieved a well-deserved popularity
in England, as well as in Australia. His novels are
wholesome out-of-door stories, full of movement and
fresh air; although I have heard an eminent Aus-
tralian judge complain that Robbery under Arms
had a tendency to popularise bushranging among
idle ?up-country? youths, in the same way that
Jack Sheppard was said to have increased thieving
in London. But, compared with the so-called
4 Detective Story,? in which the author cudgels his
brains to invent ingenious crimes, and to depict
the devices by which our secret police outwit the
criminal, or are outwitted by him, such a book as
Robbery under Arms is perfectly wholesome in its
moral tendency. 4 Rolf Boldrewood?s ? stories are
all of this class vigorous and thoroughly Aus-
tralian, with plenty of movement and much excel-
lent description of bush scenes. He is not by
any means a great or original writer, nor is he in
any sense a profound or subtle artist in words; but
he deserves his place as the head of the present
Australian school of fiction founded on Henry
Kingsley.
In my opinion, Mrs. Campbell Praed is a much
more artistic novelist, and she has done in her early
stories for North Australia what Kingsley and 4 Rolf


THE BEGINNINGS OF AN
Boldrewood ? have done for the South. She is, par
excellence , the novelist of Queensland. Born in
Brisbane, the daughter of Mr. Murray Prior, an
early squatter and well-known local politician, Mrs.
Campbell Praed from her childhood saw much of
the inner political life of the Northern colony. No
Australian novelist is so political; and the hero of
perhaps her finest novel Policy and Passion
? Longleat of Koralbyn,? is, in my opinion, the most
lifelike picture ever drawn of the typical, self-made,
Australian statesmen of the masterful democratic
type, such as London recently beheld in the great
Jubilee procession. As a companion volume to
4 Rolf Boldrewood?s ? Old Melbourne Memories , I
would advise every one interested in the social and
political development of Australia to read a little
volume of Queensland sketches by Mrs. Praed, en-
titled Australian Life: Black and White. The
book is plainly autobiographical, and teems with
vivid descriptions of colonial life and manners.
Mrs. Campbell Praed has resided for many years
in London, but in all her best Australian work there
is that unfailing touch of truth which bespeaks one
who is ?native and to the manner born.?
Another lady novelist, Mrs. Cross, the wife of a
Victorian clergyman, has written several pleasing
stories of Australian life and society. Under her
now familiar maiden name, ?Ada Cambridge,? she
has, indeed, become one of the popular lady novelists
of the day?a remarkable achievement for one whose
novels are always moral and decent.


AUSTRALIAN LITERATURE
One could go on naming quite a number of other
more or less well-known writers who have found
inspiration in Australian wilds, or from the new
social conditions of colonial city life. Madame
Couvreur, the late correspondent of the London
Times in Brussels ?under her pen-name ?Tasma?
(which, like that of ?Melba,? discloses the lady?s
former habitat) ?has written some admirable stories
and sketches, both of Tasmania and Australia, while
Miss Ethel Turner, of Sydney, has made quite a
speciality of Australian children, and is altogether
a fresh and entertaining writer.
It is somewhat singular that from Henry Kingsley
downwards the writers of Australian fiction have
given their best work to the description of the
squatting or pastoral life of the community. The
great country of gold fields and diggers has not
produced its Bret Harte. Not one single tale of its
myriad mining camps has been written that could
for a moment be mentioned beside Tennessee's Part-
ner and the Luck of Roaring Camp , those immortal
masterpieces in miniature, compared with which
such a book as 4 Rolf Boldrewood?s ? A Miner?s Right
is as heavy as lead.
Having roughly sketched my views on Australian
fiction, I propose to bring under your consideration
that genuine, if unequal, poet, Adam Lindsay
Gordon, whom I rank as the chief figure, and as one
of -the founders of an Australian literature.
Let me say, once for all, that in making this claim
for Gordon I have no wish to overlook or underrate


THE BEGINNINGS OF AN
the many gifted colonial verse-writers, some of whom
have an undeniable title to be considered poets.
Kendall, as I have admitted, is often far more artistic,
and almost always describes the scenery of his native
bush more faithfully than Gordon. Mr. Brunton
Stephens, the Queensland poet, in 4 Convict Once,?
has shown himself capable of a more sustained effort,
and in his lighter verse displays a distinct vein of
humour (strange, indeed, the foolish may think,
in a Scotsman!) which Gordon lacked. My old
Melbourne friend, Mr. George Gordon M?Crae, a
man of fine mind and wide culture, has published
at least two epic poems based on the traditions and
mythology of the poor native races whom we have
ousted. But you cannot write epics on the Aus-
tralian blacks; you might as well compose a sonata
on a monkey.
Far beyond any of these stands Alfred Domett,
that remarkable man, who suddenly grew wearied of
London, and wandered off to New Zealand, to the
utter surprise of his friend, Robert Browning.
? What?s become of Waring
Since he gave us all the slip.
Chose land-travel or seafaring,
Boots and chest, or staff and scrip,
Rather than pace up and down
Any longer, London town ? ?
This * Waring,? otherwise Domett, not only became
Prime Minister of New Zealand, in which colony he
remained for some thirty years, but on his return to
England in 1871 he published his great Maori epic,


AUSTRALIAN LITERATURE
?Ranolph and Amohia,? a poem of marvellous
descriptive power, replete with deep philosophic
thought; a poem which, I have been informed, no
less a personage than the Empress Frederick ranks
among the literary glories of her illustrious Mother?s
reign. But for all that, ? Ranolph and Amohia ? must,
I fear, be considered dead ; no one reads it or quotes
from it; nor has it in any way influenced the mind
or heart of Young New Zealand.
When we have urged all that can be said with
regard to these colonial poets, it will be found, I
think, that Adam Lindsay Gordon, at least in the
estimation of his fellow-colonists of Australia (who
are, after all, the best judges of the matter), stands
in a totally different position from any of them. I
hold that the highest aim of Literature is to reveal
human personality; it is the Enchanted Mirror in
which we may catch stray glimpses of the human
soul. No one can read a page of Gordon without at
once feeling the presence of his powerful indi-
viduality.
?Every book,? says Robert Louis Stevenson, ?is,
in an intimate sense, a circular letter to the friends
of him who writes it. They alone take his meaning;
they find private messages, assurances of love, and
expressions of gratitude dropped for them in every
corner. The public is but the generous patron who
defrays the postage.?
It is undeniable that Adam Lindsay Gordon
appeals, not only as no other colonial verse-writer
does, to Australians, but also to those high-spirited


THE BEGINNINGS OF AN
and untamable soldiers of fortune to be found in all
lands, wherever the English race has settled. His
philosophy of life is perhaps not profound, but it is
very moving:?
? Life is mostly froth and bubble,
Two things stand like stone?
Kindness in another?s trouble,
Courage in your own.?
It is the philosophy of the old Border moss-trooper,
and of the soldier and comrade-in-arms. Adam
Lindsay Gordon, as his name declares, was of
Scottish extraction. He came of the ?lightsome
Lindsays ? and the ? gallant Gordons,? whose daring
deeds shine out in so many of the songs and tradi-
tions of the North. The clan has given to our
Empire many a brave heart and stout arm, and in
the immortal hero of Khartoum the most noble
figure in our modern annals.
The author of Bush Ballads and Galloping Rhymes
was the son of Captain Adam Gordon, a scholar as
well as a soldier, who had married his cousin, Miss
Harriet Gordon, a lady of fortune. The future poet
first saw the light at Fayal, in the Azores, over sixty
years ago. The story of his life has been too often
told for me to repeat it; suffice it that, after a good
education at Cheltenham College, where his father
was Professor of Oriental Languages, he, at the age
of twenty or twenty-one, found himself in Adelaide,
South Australia ?strange to say, in 1853, the same
year that Henry Kingsley arrived in Victoria; and,


AUSTRALIAN LITERATURE
like our pioneer novelist, Gordon joined the Mounted
Police. Like Kingsley, too, as a colonist Gordon
was a complete failure. He tried his hand at every-
thing ; he was, as well as a policeman, a horse-breaker,
a landowner, and member of the South Australian
Parliament (this as the result of a legacy from the
old country); then, crossing over the border into
Victoria, he became a livery-stable keeper at Ballarat,
and all the while he scribbled verses, and was the
best gentleman steeplechase-rider in Australia. His
poems were written chiefly in the Mount Gambier
district of South Australia, on the Victorian border.
He published three slender volumes afterwards in
Melbourne; but here also, judged from the world?s
standpoint, he was a failure, for the proceeds did not
pay the printer?s bill. Finally, utterly broken down,
it is said, by his inability to secure the Esslemont
estate, in Scotland, to which he had claims, Gordon,
worn out with debt and disappointment, blew out
his brains on the Brighton beach, near Melbourne,
June 24, 1870. He was then well under forty years
of age ?a sad story, in truth. He left a widow, but
no children, having lost his only child in Ballarat.
Gordon was not only the son of a soldier, but
came of a race of warriors. No English poet ?not
Byron or Sir Walter Scott, not even Mr. Kipling?
glories more openly in the fighting qualities of the
race. If Count Tolstoi be right, and War and
Patriotism be alike unchristian, then is the poor
e Bush Bard ? little better than one of the heathen.
For truly, in him there was much of what the pious
c 33


THE BEGINNINGS OF AN
term the ?Old Adam,' which comes out strongly in
such lines as those describing the man who rode by
his side in the hunting-field, up to and over the
stone wall, ?With the stream on the ?take-off?
side:?
? I remember the laugh that all the while
On his quiet features played:?
So he rode to his death with that careless smile
In the van of the Light Brigade.
So stricken by Russian grape, the cheer
Rang out when he toppled back
From the shattered lungs, as merry and clear
As it did when he roused the pack.
Let never a tear his memory stain.
Give his ashes never a sigh,
One of many who perished not in vain
As a type of our Chivalry.?
Such verses as that rattling English racing ballad,
? How we Beat the Favourite,? or the pathetic Aus-
tralian lament, ?The Sick Stock-rider,? are now
almost as familiar in London drawing-rooms and on
suburban platforms, as in the remote sheep-stations
or bush shanties of the Antipodes. They are not
perhaps of the highest form of art, but they have the
qualities which appeal to the mass of mankind. In
Australia itself they are rather better known, at least
in sporting and racing circles, than anything in the
Bible or Shakespeare.
Gordon?s poems, which were of so little use to him
in the battle of life, have indeed now become almost
household words in the land of his adoption ; and he


AUSTRALIAN LITERATURE
appeals, as I have said, to a certain class of adven-
turous men all over the world, as few, if any, of our
greater poets do.
A short time ago, when one of our unending
little wars had broken out in Africa, it was reported
that the officers of a regiment carried with them
into the desert the poems of Gordon. High Indian
authorities, such as Sir Mountstuart Grant Duff and
Sir Alfred Lyall, bear testimony to Gordon?s wide
popularity in the remote military stations of Hindu-
stan. It could hardly be otherwise; for the light of
battle is in his verse, and Gordon is, indeed, the
laureate of the soldier?s true friend?the horse.
You may open Gordon?s poems anywhere, at
random, and the effect is as though some erratic but
masterful genius were confiding to you personally
his most intimate thoughts. From an aesthetic
point of view, many of his lines, like Byron?s, may
be poor and halting; but even in his feeblest effort
the feeling is borne in upon you that he who wrote
it was a man , and not a whining, long-haired weak-
ling. 4 Written as they were,? says Marcus Clarke,
4 at odd times and leisure moments of a stirring and
adventurous life, it is not to be wondered at if they
are unequal or unfinished. The astonishment of
those who knew the man and can gauge the capacity
of this city [Melbourne] to foster poetic instinct, is
that such work was ever produced here at all.?
My own experience in first introducing Gordon
to the knowledge of the English public by an article
in Temple Bar, written some fourteen years ago


THE BEGINNINGS OF AN
(February 1884), was suggestive. My little article
landed me in a correspondence with some two hun-
dred strangers, all, like Oliver Twist, clamouring
4 for more,? and requesting to be informed where they
could procure copies of Gordon?s poems. In that
article I made in no sense a careful or critical
estimate of Gordon as a poet; and I remember that
the late Francis Adams?whose untimely death we
all deplored?subsequently took me to task for what
he considered my excessive eulogy. My astonish-
ment may be imagined when I came to read Mr.
Adams?s own appreciation, entitled * The Poetry of
Adam Lindsay Gordon,? and lighted upon the fol-
lowing passage:?
4 What I find so admirable in Gordon, and in
almost all his characters, is that they are men. I
mean men , as opposed to dreamers or students. His
Lancelot is Lancelot, the knight who has lived and
loved largely. Lord Tennyson?s is not. I must
confess that I think that ?The Rhyme of Joyous
Garde ? is worth all the other ? Idylls of the King,?
save 44 Lancelot and Elaine? and 44 The Passing of
Arthur,? put together.?
It is, perhaps, worth pointing out that Adam
Lindsay Gordon, who is now considered the national
poet of Australia, often falls into curious errors in
describing the land of his adoption. I think that this
may have arisen from the fact that Gordon?s muse
was the product of two such very different climes as
the South of England and the South of Australia.
None of his verses are more familiar than the


AUSTRALIAN LITERATURE
Swinburnian dedication to Major Whyte-Melville of
the Bush Ballads and Galloping Rhymes , which
begins thus:?
? They are rhymes rudely strung with intent less
Of sound than of words,
In lands where bright blossoms are scentless.
And songless bright birds.?
As we all know, many of these bright blossoms have
corresponding strong odours, and the very wattle,
which, in a later stanza, he so beautifully charac-
terises, possesses a special and most exquisite per-
fume. As to the ? songless bright birds,? what are
we to say to the screech of the cockatoo and the
guffaw of the laughing jackass ? The truth is, that
in writing such verse, Gordon, in spite of his own
disclaimer, is like his master, Swinburne, simply
carried away by the rush of sound and the music of
the words. Still, with this patent blemish on the
very face of it, this 4 Dedication,? as such, is almost
unsurpassed. What can be finer than the oft-quoted
lines descriptive of the Australian spring :
f In the Spring, when the wattle-gold trembles
?Twixt shadow and shine.
When each dew-laden air draught resembles
A long draught of wine ;
When the sky-line?s blue burnished resistance
Makes deeper the dreamiest distance.
Some song in all hearts hath existence?
Such songs have been mine.?
There is a beautiful little lyric of Gordon?s, called
?A Song of Autumn,? in which the poet seems to


THE BEGINNINGS OF AN
me, if I may say so, to be in England and in Aus-
tralia at the same time:?
? Where shall we go for our garlands glad
At the falling of the year,
When the burnt-up banks are yellow and sad,
When the boughs are yellow and sere ? ?
? The burnt-up banks ? doubtless came from his later
experiences of the dry Australian bush, but the
yellow boughs of autumn are very English, while
the sad refrain :
1 1 go where the last year?s lost leaves go
At the falling of the year/
was clearly a reminiscence of his earlier life in
Gloucestershire, for, as you know, the all-prevailing
eucalyptus is an evergreen !
Despite these blemishes, almost all of Gordon?s
shorter poems, even when they echo too closely
his two masters, Browning and Swinburne, go
straight to the heart; in fact, we do not pause to
take note of their defects. Swinburne himself has
written nothing on the Sea finer than some of the
lines in Gordon?s poem, ?The Swimmer,? where, if
the ? form ? be Swinburnian, so also is the ? force ?:?
? I would that with sleepy soft embraces
The sea would fold me?would find me rest
In luminous shades of her secret places.
In depths where her marvels are manifest;
So the earth beneath her should not discover
My hidden couch?nor the heaven above her?
As a strong love shielding a weary lover.
I would have her shield me with shining breast.
38


AUSTRALIAN LITERATURE
? Love of my life ! we had lights in season?
Hard to part from, harder to keep?
We had strength to labour and souls to reason,
And seed to scatter and fruits to reap.
Though time estranges and fate disperses.
We have had our loves and our loving-mercies;
Though the gifts of the light in the end are curses,
Yet bides the gift of the darkness?sleep !
? O brave white horses ! you gather and gallop.
The storm sprite loosens the gusty reins;
Now the stoutest ship were the frailest shallop
In your hollow backs, or your high-arched manes.
I would ride as never a man has ridden,
In your sleepy, swirling surges hidden,
To gulfs foreshadowed, through straits forbidden,
Where no light wearies and no love wanes.?
To be quite truthful, one must confess that
Australia was a harsh stepmother to poor Gordon.
Like all unsuccessful men of genius, he was a very
difficult person to help or to befriend. Proud, shy,
sensitive, and retiring?how could any one really aid
him ? And yet it makes one?s heart ache to hear
of his lonely life in the South Australian bush. The
Rev. Tenison Woods, a cultured and sympathetic
Roman Catholic priest ?whose scientific writings
and monumental work on Australian Exploration
and Discovery will hold a permanent place in the
annals of Australia ?was almost the only com-
panion of his own class whom Gordon possessed
in the colony at that time. The kindly cleric re-
lates how he would ride and talk about Horace and


THE BEGINNINGS OF AN
the classics with Gordon for hours in the bush, until
they pulled up at the homestead of some squatter,
where the priest would be received by the family
in the best parlour, while the poet would be sent
to the men?s hut. One thinks, too, of the young
ladies of a certain bush township who were horrified
at Gordon?s claim to enter as a ? gentleman ? rider
for the Ladies? Purse.
Tenison Woods observes: ?Gordon was much
insulted by the refusal, but I don?t think he said a
word on the subject except to myself, and what he
did say was very characteristic of the man. He
remarked that I used to blame him for not mixing
more with the people of the district, and said iron-
ically what little he would gain by consorting with
such society. It happened, moreover, that the
coveted prize fell that year to the son of a squatter,
who, a few years previously, had been a publican.
It was quite a disappointment to the Ladies? Com-
mittee, who expected the bag to fall into the hands
of one who was better known and much more
admired. They gave a practical effect to their
dissatisfaction by taking the most valuable things
out of the bag before it was given to the winner.
This Gordon knew, and his comments upon it
were very cynical.?
However, these trifles could only cause a passing
annoyance to so manly a man. It was his persistent
failure in everything to which he put his hand which
at last wore him completely out. When he left
South Australia and passed over the border into


AUSTRALIAN LITERATURE
Victoria, his hopes seemed for a time to revive.
His fame?not as a poet, but as a steeplechase-rider
?had preceded him, and when he won for Major
Baker the Cup Steeplechase, on Babbler, he became
quite a local hero. But such things are not lasting.
His livery-stable experiences in Ballarat were dis-
astrous, and by the time that he had settled near
Melbourne, his life-story was almost at an end.
It was then that he published his slender books of
verse, and having an undoubted claim to the Essle-
mont estate, he instituted legal proceedings to assert
his rights. This meant borrowing money at ruinous
interest. He and his wife lived in a fisherman?s hut
on the Brighton beach, some nine or ten miles out
of Melbourne, and Gordon walked in and out nearly
every day to save the railway fare, in order to see
his lawyers and to look up the ?Wanted? advertise-
ments in the papers.
Then came the final crash. By some alteration
in the Scottish law of inheritance, Gordon?s claim
to Esslemont was void. This sad news was brought
to him by the June mail, 1870. On the 23rd of
June his new book of poems appeared, but to him
this meant only so much the more debt in the shape
of an unpaid printer?s bill. The next morning he
rose early, kissed his sleeping wife, then slipped out
of the hut with his loaded rifle, and turning into
the scrub by Picnic Point, Brighton beach, put
an end to his troubled existence by a bullet in his
brain!
Gordon?s death took place nearly thirty years ago,


THE BEGINNINGS OF AN
and it was in August 1881, getting on for twenty
years ago, that I stood beside the grave of Marcus
Clarke, who was buried in the Melbourne Cemetery
when only thirty-four years of age. What has the
younger generation of Australia achieved in litera-
ture since the death of these two remarkable young
Englishmen; for both Clarke and Gordon were
Australian only by adoption? I fear that the
youthful vigour and ability of the colonies have
been displayed on the cricket-field and the mining
market rather than in the poorly remunerated ser-
vice of the Muses.
Within the last few weeks a book has been
published in London by the eminent firm of Long-
man & Co., entitled The Development of Australian
Literature , written in collaboration by Mr. H. G.
Turner and Mr. Alexander Sutherland, of Mel-
bourne. The volume consists of an introductory
sketch, followed by biographical articles on Gordon,
Kendall, and Clarke. The manner in which Mr.
Sutherland, from the lofty attitude of a blame-
less suburban existence, dilates on the weaknesses
and foibles, the shortcomings and sins of the two
unfortunate Australian poets, is enough to make
Lord Tennyson turn in his grave. I would strongly
advise Mr. Sutherland to study the late Laureate?s
unpublished lines on ? Reticence,? which he will find
in the Memoir of the great poet. Mr. Turner
also displays very poor taste in his severe strictures
on a number of Australian authors in London, who
have attained some measure of public recognition?


AUSTRALIAN LITERATURE
Mr. Louis Becke, Mr. Guy Boothby, and Mr. Hume
Nisbet, for instance ?while at the same time he
belauds his collaborator for some utterly unknown
verse, which he compares favourably with Enoch
Arden. Such criticism has justly provoked hostile
comments in the London Press; it is, indeed,
essentially parochial in spirit, with a strong leaning
in the direction of ? log-rolling.?
With regard to the younger school of ?native-
born ? Australian writers, Mr. Turner contemptu-
ously classifies them as ? the Bulletin school.? In
doing so he unconsciously pays the highest tribute
to that remarkable Sydney journal. The Bulletin
may justly lay claim to the distinction that above
all other colonial journals it has done its utmost to
foster a native school of writers in verse and prose.
Nor have its efforts been so barren as Mr. Turner
would have us believe. In the case of Mr. Louis
Becke, a native of New South Wales, with his
strange and romantic experiences as a supercargo
in the South Seas, the Bulletin first brought to light
those vivid sketches, republished under the title
By Beef and Palm , which won the hearty and sin-
cere admiration of the late Earl of Pembroke (who
knew the South Seas well), and have since achieved
a wide popularity in England. It is not Mr. Becke?s
fault if foolish admirers have declared him to be the
superior of R. L. Stevenson ; nor should Mr. Turner
speak of such a comparison as an ?outrage.? Mr.
Becke?s By Reef and Palm can quite well stand on
its own merits, and though there may be a want of


THE BEGINNINGS OF AN
variety in his South Sea sketches, it is impos-
sible not to feel their literary skill and dramatic
power.
In the matter of verse, the Bulletin has done
even more to bring to light unconventional local
genius, which would otherwise have remained ? mute
and inglorious.? Mr. A. B. Paterson, known to all
Bulletin readers as ? Banjo,? has attained the greatest
success of any writer of Australian verse since Gordon.
His volume, The Man from Snowy River, went
through four editions in Australia (an unparalleled
achievement), and has recently been published in
London by Macmillan.
Like Gordon, the new Australian poet is de-
cidedly ?horsey,? and his verses are said to be the
delight and solace of the leisure moments of Lord
Rosebery, who has always been an appreciative
reader of Australian literature such as it is.
Paterson?s poem, ?On Kiley?s Run,? is the most
thoroughly Australian set of verses I know; and
those verses have a beauty and pathos of their own,
infinitely surpassing the best suburban imitations
of Wordsworth and Tennyson. For in Literature,
as in Life, nothing is easier than to imitate?to
follow some one else?s lead?nothing so difficult as
to originate.
There are other Bulletiji poets of less popularity
than Paterson, but who are not without merit. Mr.
Henry Lawson presents us with aspects of Aus-
tralian life from the standpoint of the ? overlander ?
and the wandering stockman. Some of his verse is


AUSTRALIAN LITERATURE
very graphic and vigorous. I could name others
?Mr. Victor Daly and Mr. Edward Dyson?
both well known to the readers of the extra-
ordinary journal which has fostered them and their
kind.
One of the earlier Bulletin poets, Mr. John
Farrell, who is a Reformer as well as a Rhymster,
and altogether a kind of uncouth Shelley in his
political and ethical creeds, once sent a volume of
his somewhat violent verse to Lord Tennyson.
Tennyson?s acknowledgment was eminently char-
acteristic. He wrote: ?By every post I receive
volumes of verse, and hardly ever a book of prose!
I have received your poems, but, unlike John
the Baptist , I cannot live on locusts and wild
honey'
Yes, that is the real defect of the Bulletin and
its poets; too much ?locusts and wild honey??an
absence of lucidity and an excess of expletives. All
the same, I, for one, recognise in these young Aus-
tralian poets and writers of ? the Bulletin school ? a
certain native vigour and originality ; they, at least,
are ? racy of the soil.?
I frankly admit that the ?literary output? of
Australia is small?a couple of novels written forty
years ago by a half-forgotten English novelist; some
half-dozen other stories, including Marcus Clarke?s
For the Term of His Natural Life ; and Adam
Lindsay Gordon?s collected poems. If to these you
add a few selections from Kendall and the best of
Mr. ?Banjo? Paterson?s racy ballads, there is little


AUSTRALIAN LITERATURE
else to be recognised as distinctively Australian.
But in these few strangely assorted volumes and
scattered selections I venture to assert that the
fair-minded and the far-seeing may possibly discern
?The Beginnings of an Australian Literature.?

articles in periodicals and papers in transactions?a large proportion belong to Colonial publications which
have never been included in any general catalogue before. An examination also of early and later files
of Australasian newspapers and other Colonial periodical publications, has resulted in the discovery of the
names of many writers who long been forgotten, and of a mass of Colonial literature political,
