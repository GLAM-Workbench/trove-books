TO THE COLONISTS OF QUEENSLAND,
Sydney, July Ist, 1875.
Fellow-Colonists and Friends, —On the 14th September, 1860, within
nine months after the separation of Queensland from New South Wales,
a vote to the following effect was unanimously passed by your first Par-
liament, on the motion of the Honorable Charles (now Judge) Lilley—
viz.; “That the thanks of this House be given to the Rev. John
Dunmore Lang, D.D., for his able and successful efforts for the separa-
tion of Moreton Bay from New South Wales, and to found the colony of
Queensland.”
Now, as the population of Queensland, which at present amounts to
upwards of one hundred and thirty-five thousand souls, did not exceed
twenty-five thousand when the separation of the colony from New South
Wales was finally effected on the 10th December, 1859, by far the larger
portion of the inhabitants must in all likelihood be unacquainted with
the circumstances to which that vote refers. Permit me, then, to detail
these circumstances for the information of those whom it concerns ; as I
am confident, from what has taken place in certain other countries,
which were once colonies of England, they will be intensely interesting
to the future inhabitants of your noble colony.
In the month of November, 1845, I visited the Moreton Bay district
of New South Wales, now Queensland, for the first time; its population
at that early period being under five thousand souls. I was then con-
templating a voyage to England, which I effected accordingly in the
following year; and my sole object in that visit was to ascertain, from
my own personal observation and inquiries, the capabilities of the district
for the settlement of a numerous, industrious, and virtuous population
from the mother-country—an object which, for various reasons, I was
anxious to promote, during my intended visit to England, by every
means in my power. I ascertained, accordingly, during my visit, the two
following important particulars—viz.: Ist. That the Moreton Bay dis-
trict presented a splendid field for the immigration and settlement of a
numerous, industrious, and virtuous population from the mother-country,
and 2nd. That it had been found, from an experience of upwards of
twenty years, that every description of labor, whether mechanical, agri-
cultural, or pastoral, could be pursued in that district by British workmen
with perfect safety. As Moreton Bay was in a much lower latitude

these circumstances for the information of those whom it concerns ; as I
am confident, from what has taken place in certain other countries,
which were once colonies of England, they will be intensely interesting
to the future inhabitants of your noble colony.
In the month of November, 1845, I visited the Moreton Bay district
of New South Wales, now Queensland, for the first time; its population
at that early period being under five thousand souls. I was then con-
templating a voyage to England, which I effected accordingly in the
following year; and my sole object in that visit was to ascertain, from
my own personal observation and inquiries, the capabilities of the district
for the settlement of a numerous, industrious, and virtuous population
from the mother-country—an object which, for various reasons, I was
anxious to promote, during my intended visit to England, by every
means in my power. I ascertained, accordingly, during my visit, the two
following important particulars—viz.: Ist. That the Moreton Bay dis-
trict presented a splendid field for the immigration and settlement of a
numerous, industrious, and virtuous population from the mother-country,
and 2nd. That it had been found, from an experience of upwards of
twenty years, that every description of labor, whether mechanical, agri-
cultural, or pastoral, could be pursued in that district by British workmen
with perfect safety. As Moreton Bay was in a much lower latitude


(27|° S.) than any of the other transmarine possessions of Great Britain,
to which British emigration had ever been directed, the latter of these
points was necessarily a vital point in my inquiries.
There were two other matters, however, of transcendent importance to
the welfare and advancement of the Moreton Bay district, which pre-
sented themselves to my view on that visit, and to which my attention
was thenceforth very strongly directed. A few seeds of the Gossipium,
or cotton plant of commerce, and a few sugar-canes, had some time before
found their way into Moreton Bay, and had been sown and planted—
merely, however, as articles of curiosity—in the gardens of some of the
leading colonists of the time, and particularly in that of the late Dr.
Ballow, then Colonial Surgeon j and I found, most unexpectedly, and to
my own great gratification, both of these very important botanical pro-
ductions of the intertropical regions growing luxuriantly in Moreton
Bay. Combining this circumstance with the fact I had previously ascer-
tained—viz.; that all descriptions of labor could be carried on with perfect
safety to their health by British laborers in that district—it appeared to
me that I had made a great discovery in the cause of humanity,—the
discovery that cotton and sugar, which were everywhere else the products
of slave labor, could be grown successfully, and to any conceivable extent,
by means of British free labor in Moreton Bay. I picked a few speci-
mens of the cotton from the plants I found in Dr. Ballow’s * garden,
which I took home with me on my return to Sydney; and on confer-
ring on the subject with a few friends in that city, and particularly with
the late Dr. Bland, who was then, like myself, a member of the first
Legislative Council of the colony, we all concluded that the discovery
I had thus made was one of the utmost importance to the interests of
humanity.
The other matter that impressed itself very strongly on my mind, on
the occasion in question, was the idea that the Moreton Bay district
ought, as speedily as possible, to be detached from New South Wales,
and to form another colonial system; the great inlet of Moreton Bay
being, in my humble opinion, as evidently marked out by nature for such
a destiny as either Port Jackson or Port Phillip. In short, although the
population of the Moreton Bay district was, at the period of my visit in
1845, somewhat less, as I have already stated, than five thousand souls,
I then conceived the idea—which I never lost sight of afterwards, and
for which I never ceased to agitate till it was at length happily realized
in the year 1859, fourteen years thereafter—the idea of the separation
of the Moreton Bay district from New South Wales, and its erection
into a distinct and independent colony.
I happened, during my stay in the Moreton Bay district on the occa-
sion in question, to be dining, along with the late Captain Wickham,
E.N., then commandant, and one or two other gentlemen, at the house
of the late Dr. Simpson of Red Bank, to whom I suggested the idea of
the prospective separation of Moreton Bay from New South Wales.
They all acknowledged that such a consummation would be exceedingly

desirable; but they were all strongly of opinion that its realization was
utterly hopeless. I had my own opinion on the subject, however, and
resolved to act upon it on the first opportunity.
My views, therefore, as contemplating a voyage to England for the
purposes I have indicated, were thus not only strengthened, but greatly
expanded, by my visit to Moreton Bay; and I resolved accordingly to
devote my efforts, during my stay in the mother-country, to the three
following objects, viz.: —
First, to demonstrate the practicability of growing both cotton and
sugar by means of free white labor in the Moreton Bay distinct of New
South Wales—hoping and trusting that I should thus be instrumental
in creating a powerful antagonistic influence to the baneful system of
negro slavery which was then prevalent in America.
Secondly, to originate and urge on an extensive emigration of the
industrious and virtuous classes of the mother-country to Moreton Bay,
for the settlement of the country generally, and particularly for the
growth of cotton and the sugar-cane in that district; and
Thirdly, to do whatever might be practicable, in the way of ensuring
the prospective separation of the Moreton Bay country from New South
Wales, and its erection into a distinct and independent colony.
With these views and objects, which I proposed to combine together,
and to make mutually helpful, I proceeded to England in the year 1846,
and arrived in London towards the close of that year.
These, however, were all merely subordinate objects, and were regarded
by myself merely as means to an end ; my grand motive and object in
undertaking a voyage to England on this occasion being to give a great
impulse to Protestant emigration to the great colony of New South Wales,
and especially to- its two extremities, Port Phillip, now Victoria, and
Moreton Bay, now Queensland. A few words of explanation, however,
are requisite on this subject.
Previous, therefore, to the year 1839, the revenue arising from the
sale of the Waste Lands of the colony—which was then a Droit of the
Crown, and devoted exclusively for the promotion of immigration from
the United Kingdom—was administered for the governor, the late Sir
George Gipps, by the Land and Immigration Commissioners in London.
These functionaries employed experienced surgeons in the Navy to select
and carry out suitable emigrants for the colony, for whom a free passage
out was provided from the Land Fund, viz.: mechanics of all descriptions
for the colonial towns, and agricultural laborers and shepherds for the
country and the interior. And to distribute the boon implied in the
free passage out as equally as possible among the humbler and industrious
classes of the United Kingdom, these gentlemen were directed to select
and carry out their emigrants respectively from the different shipping
ports of the Three Kingdoms—from Dundee and the Highlands of Scot-
land, from Dublin and Londonderry in Ireland, and from London, Liver-
pool and Plymouth, in England. The benefit conferred by this arrange-
ment both on the mother-country and on the colony was incalculable;
and the rapid advancement of the colony, not only in the increase of its
population, but in their industrious character and moral worth, was
gratifying in the highest degree and almost miraculous.
In the year 1839, however, when the Land Fund had attained gigantic


proportions, and this process had been in progress in a constantly in-
creasing ratio for a series of years, the cupidity of certain long-headed
merchants in Sydney was strongly excited to get the administration of
that fund into their own hands. For this purpose, a hue and cry was
got up in Sydney against the Government system of immigration ; and it
was confidently asserted by these gentlemen, and unfortunately believed
by the public, that if the administration of the Land Fund were only
transfei'red to themselves, they would bring out a much larger number
of immigrants and at a much smaller cost. Sir George Gipps, then the
sole administrator of the fund on behalf of Her Majesty, having unfor-
tunately, and I conceive most unwarrantably, allowed himself to be
overpowered by this pressure from without, instead of strenuously resist-
ing it, a system of Bounty or Head-money was forthwith established at
the instance of the merchants, of which the results were most disas-
trous to the colony at large.
For these gentlemen and their London agents soon found that it would
not pay them to employ men of character and standing, and especially
of general acquaintance with the colony, like the surgeons of the Navy
employed by the Commissioners, to select and carry out emigrants from
the distant ports of the United Kingdom. Ascertaining, moreover, that
the cheapest market for the commodity they required was the South and
West of Ireland, they sent thither as their whippers-in men of no stand-
ing or character, and destitute of all colonial experience, to collect
emigrants by the hundred at so much per head, and with very little
inquiry as to character or qualifications, and to forward them by the
Irish steamboats from Dublin and Cork to their emigrant vessels in
Plymouth Sound; where these vessels, after embarking their cabin pas-
sengers with their stores and cargo in the London Docks, were directed
to touch for their Irish emigrants at the mouth of the channel. I hap-
pened to make a passage out to the colony myself by one of these vessels,
and saw the whole process. It was one of the most heartless and
unprincipled proceedings for the moral welfare of the colony I ever
knew. Immediately after my return to the colony, I published a
pamphlet on the subject, which created a great sensation in the colony at
the time, entitled “ The Question of Questions; or, is this Colony to be
transformed into a Province of the Popedom 1” There was surely good
reason for such a question at the time; for vessels with immigrants,
brought out passage free, were then arriving from Plymouth Sound both
in Sydney and Melbourne, at the rate of seventeen Homan Catholics
to one Protestant; and though it was notorious that four-fifths of the
Land Fund wei’e derived from the purchases of land by English and
Scotch Protestants, the benefits of the free passage out were so much
monopolized by Irish Roman Catholics that of upwards of 25,000 immi-
grants who arrived in the colony passage free from the Ist of January,
1841, to the 30th June, 1842, when immigration ceased for a time from
the temporary exhaustion of the Land Fund, upwards of 16,000 were,
from Ireland, almost exclusively from the West and South, and only
8,000 from England and Scotland together. In short it was confidently
and exultingly believed by many at the time that New South Wales would
very soon become an Irish Roman Catholic Colony. There were some at
that time who thought there was a regular Romish conspiracy to Romanize


desirable; but they were all strongly of opinion that its realization was
utterly hopeless. I had my own opinion on the subject, however, and
resolved to act upon it on the first opportunity.
My views, therefore, as contemplating a voyage to England for the
purposes I have indicated, were thus not only strengthened, but greatly

Moreton Bay, now Queensland. A few words of explanation, however,

that time who thought there was a regular Romish conspiracy to Romanize


the colony. There was nothing of the kind, however * the men who con-
ducted the movement were almost exclusively Protestants; and all they
had to say for themselves was that, on the well-known mercantile prin-
ciple, they merely went for their goods to the cheapest market.
It was in these circumstances that in the year 1846, when there was
a fair prospect of a revival of immigration, I went home to England to
give a great impulse, if possible, to Protestant immigration to Australia.
My first efforts in the cause in which I had thus embarked, in subordi-
nation to the grand object of my voyage to England—the promotion of a
Protestant emigration to New South Wales, and particularly to Moreton
Bay—were made in rather a high quarter; for, in the year 1847, I was
examined by a Select Committee of the House of Commons, which was
then sitting on some inquiry on the subject of Negro Slavery, and of
which that distinguished statesman, now the Right Hon. John Bright,
who has ever since honored me with his friendship, was Chairman. For
both Mr. Bright himself, and his illustrious friend and fellow-laborer in
the great field of humanity, the late Richard Cobden, took a special
interest in the affairs of these Australian colonies; insomuch that, on
one occasion, when I was afterwards in England in the year 1853, I had
the honor of spending a whole evening, at the instance of Mr. Cobden,
with these two distinguished men—answering questions and giving them
information about Australia, for three hours together—in Mr. Bright s
own house in London. But I found Mr. Bright’s Select Committee of
1847 altogether sceptical as to the practicability of growing either cotton
or sugar by means of British free labor in any part of the world. They
seemed to regard me —and in particular the late Sir Robert Inglis, who
was one of the members—as a sort of hair-brained enthusiast, although
they were much too courteous to say anything of the kind.
I then visited the principal cotton-manufacturing’ districts of the
mother-country, Manchester and Glasgow—as I did also on a subsequent
visit to England in 1852 and 1853—exhibiting a whole series of speci-
mens of Australian cotton which I had carried home with me for the
purpose, on the latter occasion more especially; but I found the cotton-
lords of these great emporia of commerce and manufacture quite as
sceptical on the subject, on both of these occasions, as the members of
Mr. Bright’s Select Committee of 1847. They admitted that my speci-
mens were of a superior quality; but they regarded them merely as one
would do some rare exotic plant which had been grown in a flower-pot
in a drawing-room; it was acres upon acres of the plant, they alleged,
that they wanted to see in cultivation, and they refused to believe that
anything of the kind was practicable without slave labor in Australia.
In short, satisfied as I was that the object I had in view was a good
object—one whose successful accomplishment would be fraught with
benefits and blessings incalculable to myriads yet unborn in my adopted
country —I had to endure all the misery of hope deferred, from the
heartless reception which I met with from those who had it fully in their
power to have forwarded the object, and to have crowned my humble
efforts with success.
Determined, however, notwithstanding these rebuffs, not to give up
the idea I had deemed of such transcendent importance, not only to my
adopted country but to the interests of humanity, I then betook myself


the colony. There was nothing of the kind, however * the men who con-
ducted the movement were almost exclusively Protestants; and all they
had to say for themselves was that, on the well-known mercantile prin-

Determined, however, notwithstanding these rebuffs, not to give up
the idea I had deemed of such transcendent importance, not only to my
adopted country but to the interests of humanity, I then betook myself


to the platform and the press—delivering lectures on Australia as a
field of emigration from the mother-country, and on the practicability of
growing cotton and sugar by means of British free labor in that country.
And during the whole three years of my stay in the mother-country, I
wrote numberless letters and papers on the same general subject, which
were published from time to time in various influential journals in the
United Kingdom. All this, it will readily be supposed, subjected me to
great expense; the hiring of a room for the delivery of a single lecture,
with free admission, at Exeter Hall, London, having cost me as much as
seven pounds, besides advertisements; while I had to pay for many other
halls, throughout the United Kingdom, at a lesser cost.
In the meantime, in order to afford an additional stimulus to all who
were likely to embark in the undertaking, I had published, in the year
1847, a work entitled “ Cooks!and, in North Eastern Australia, the
future Cotton-Field of Great Britain.” For as the country had received
no appropriate name at the time, I thought it could have none more
appropriate, at least from amongst the lesser stars of the political firma-
ment, than that of its famous discoverer, Captain Cook. This idea, I
may state in passing—and I do so on the authority of Lady Franklin,
the relict of the unfortunate Sir John, with whom as well as with her
late husband I had become acquainted in Tasmania, in the year 1841—
was highly approved of at the time by the naval officers and attaches of
Somerset House.
I found, however, that something more than all this was necessary to
originate a stream of emigration of a superior character to a place so
remote, and so unheard of in England, as Moreton Bay. It was neces-
sary, still further, for the working out of my problem, for some person
to lead the way, by making a great effort to originate that very peculiar
form of emigration. And as I could find no person disposed to under-
take either the risk or the responsibility, I had to do so myself. With
this view, I succeeded at length, in the years 1848 and 1849, in sending
out from London three vessels—the “ Fortitude,” the “ Chasely,” and
the “ Lima”— with about six hundred emigrants, young and old, to
Moreton Bay ; these emigrants being all selected by myself, and consist-
ing of reputable families and individuals, bearing certificates of character
and membership from the various Evangelical Protestant communions
with which they were respectively connected in the mother-country. And
I may add that it was only with the greatest difficulty, and after sacrifices
and exertions that would now perhaps be deemed incredible, that so
large a body of emigrants could be gathered together, and induced to
emigrate to a place in so low a latitude, and. so utterly unheard of before
in England, as Moreton Bay.
As a specimen of the difficulties I had to contend with, and the personal
sacrifices I had to make on the occasion, I may mention one or two of
the cases that occurred in making up the complement of emigrants by the
ship “ Fortitude,” the first of the three vessels I sent out to Moreton
Bay in the year 1848. One of the intending emigrants by that vessel, a
tradesman from * * * *, with his wife and family of twelve or thirteen
children, agreed to pay for his passage out £2OO ; but on the eve of the
vessel’s sailing, he came to me crying, to tell me that after disposing of
all his effects he could only pay one-half of the stipulated amount, and


to the platform and the press—delivering lectures on Australia as a
field of emigration from the mother-country, and on the practicability of
growing cotton and sugar by means of British free labor in that country.
And during the whole three years of my stay in the mother-country, I
wrote numberless letters and papers on the same general subject, which
were published from time to time in various influential journals in the
United Kingdom. All this, it will readily be supposed, subjected me to
great expense; the hiring of a room for the delivery of a single lecture,
with free admission, at Exeter Hall, London, having cost me as much as
seven pounds, besides advertisements; while I had to pay for many other

vessel’s sailing, he came to me crying, to tell me that after disposing of
all his effects he could only pay one-half of the stipulated amount, and


requested that he might be allowed to embark on the payment of that
sum, binding and obliging himself to pay the remainder as soon as possible
after his arrival in Moreton Bay. But the other half of the debt has
never been paid to the present day; and this is only one of a whole
series of cases of the kind in that vessel. In another case the intending
emigrant who had recommended himself to me as the writer of an essay
on the Sabbath, was a poor but very industrious and exemplary man,
with a large and increasing family, which the overseers of the poor in
the place he came from, who had been sent up to London to confer with
me on the subject, conceived might eventually become a burden on the
parish. To prevent this consummation, the parish authorities agreed to
contribute £35 towards his passage out, and this was all that was ever
paid on account of that large family, whose passage cost me more than
four times that amount. I also gave a free passage out to a University-
bred and evangelical minister,* who was accompanied with his sister, by
the “ Fortitude,” to act as chaplain on board ship during the voyage out,
and to dispense the ordinances of religion among the emigrants, which he
did for a series of years after their landing. In short, in so far from the
case of that vessel being a mere case of unsuccessful speculation, as it has
been actually represented by people who perhaps knew no better, it was
evident from the first that the ship could not have been filled up with
her complement of emigrants, so as to go to sea at all, without entailing
a very large and serious loss on the person concerned. William Pettigrew,
Esq., J. P., of Brisbane, who came out by the “ Fortitude,” in the capacity
of surveyor, has, with a perfect knowledge of the whole affair, and with
perfect disinterestedness, calculated that the amount of unpaid passage-
money, in the case of that vessel, amounted to not less than fourteen
hundred pounds ; and the whole of that loss I have had to sustain till
this day. But as I had fully determined to originate a stream of emigra-
tion of a superior character from the mother-country to Moreton Bay,
with a view to the settlement of an industrious and virtuous population,
and the growth of cotton and sugar in that district, I was prepared to
carry out the undertaking at all hazards.
By the second of the three ships I sent out with emigrants to Moreton
Bay in the year 1848—besides providing a free passage out for another
minister and his family, as in the case of the “ Fortitude”—l gave a free
cabin passage out for himself and his family to a person who had been
strongly recommended to me as an experienced planter from the West
Indies, who, I was told on what I deemed reliable authority, would be
able to cultivate the sugar-cane, and to superintend the process of manu-
facturing its juices into sugar. And in letters which I wrote from Lon-
don to certain friends in Moreton Bay, I strongly recommended the forma-
tion of a company or association in Brisbane for the cultivation of the
sugar-cane and the manufacture of sugar. The idea was taken up warmly
at the time ; and canes were procured for carrying on the requisite pro-
cesses of cultivation and manufacture, under the management of the per-
son to whom I have just alluded. But the company or association, which
went on vigorously for a time and promised well, speedily collapsed—as
I was afterwards informed on the spot —through the extravagance and

mismanagement of the superintendent. I had consequently to bear the
whole loss incurred in his passage out ; and the process of cane cultivation
and the manufacture of sugar in Moreton Bay had consequently to be left
in abeyance for twenty years thereafter,
Such then were my humble efforts, in the infancy of your great colony,
to originate a stream of emigration of a superior character to Moreton
Bay, with a view to the cultivation of cotton and the manufacture of
sugar by means of British free labor in that district. The immigration
that was thus effected occurred at the most important period in the his-
tory of the future colony ; and the influence for good which it exerted
upon its society is evident even to the present day. And as to the great
idea which I first suggested in Brisbane in the year 1845, and main-
tained in England during the years 1847-8-9, in the face of discourage-
ments of every kind and from almost every quarter—the idea that both
cotton and sugar could be grown by means of British free labor at
Moreton Bay—how splendidly has that idea been realized in your great
colony during the comparatively short period that has since elapsed !
“ The greatest yield of cotton in Queensland ” (I quote from an able
report on the subject contained in the Sydney Empire of 23rd July,
1873) “was in the year 1871, when between 8000 and 9000 bales were
exported. This year (1873) a fair crop is expected : perhaps it will
amount to 7000 bales. The quantity of land under cotton cultivation in
the whole country is estimated at 13,000 acres.”
Now this large quantity of cotton has been grown almost exclusively
by British free labor—by small farmers and their families, having each
not more than from two to fifteen acres of land. And as to the cultiva-
tion of the sugar-cane and the manufacture of sugar in Queensland —
“During the year ending 31st March, 1873” (I quote from the same
report) “ there had been produced in Queensland 6266 tons of sugar
from 5017 acres of land.” It would be difficult to find, in the whole
history of colonization, a single instance of an idea which was univer-
sally scouted, and treated with scorn in the first instance, being realized
so splendidly in so short a period of time.
The third of the three great objects I had in view, on embarking for
England in the year 1846, was to ensure the prospective separation of
the Moreton Bay district from New South Wales, and its erection into a
distinct and independent colony.
I had fortunately been instrumental, very shortly before my first visit
to Moreton Bay, in effecting the separation of Port Phillip, now the
great colony of Victoria, from New South Wales. I had been elected
one of the six representatives of the district of Port Phillip in the first
Legislative Council, or semi-representative Legislature, of New South
Wales, in the year 1843 ; and in 1844 I submitted a motion in that
Council to the effect, “ That a humble address should be presented to
Her Majesty the Queen, praying that Her Majesty would be pleased
to take the requisite steps for the separation of Port Phillip from
New South Wales, and its erection into a distinct and independent,
colony.” That motion was singularly unsuccessful; for in addition to
those of the six Port Phillip members, who were all strongly in its favor,
the only vote for the motion, from all the thirty members of New South
Wales proper, whether elective members or nominees, was that of a


mismanagement of the superintendent. I had consequently to bear the
whole loss incurred in his passage out ; and the process of cane cultivation
and the manufacture of sugar in Moreton Bay had consequently to be left

the only vote for the motion, from all the thirty members of New South
Wales proper, whether elective members or nominees, was that of a


gentleman now of European fame, the Right Hon. Robert Lowe, recently
Chancellor of the Exchequer in England, but then merely a nominee
member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales.
The result of this motion was received by the Separation Committee
of Melbourne and the people of Port Phillip, who were all at the time
intensely desirous of separation, with feelings almost bordering on
despair. But as the six Port Phillip members had been unanimously in
favor of the motion, I suggested that they should petition Her Majesty
on the subject themselves, in their own names and on their own behalf;
and that suggestion having been adopted, I was deputed to draw up the
petition, which I did accordingly. It was forwarded to Her Majesty
through His Excellency the late Sir George Gipps, to whom it was pre-
sented by the six members, early in the year 1845; and in the month of
October following a favorable answer, conceding the prayer of the
petition, was received from Lord Stanley, afterwards Earl Derby, who
was then Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies. The actual
separation, indeed, was not effected till the Ist of July, 1851, in conse-
quence of the unexpected delay that took place in the passing of the Act
of the Imperial Parliament, which eventually authorized it; but financial
separation, a great step in the matter, took effect at once.
From the strong opposition which had been shown by the Legislature
of New South Wales to the separation of Port Phillip, I saw very
plainly that there would be no hope in that quarter for any proposal of
the kind in reference to Moreton Bay. The only idea on the subject
which had then been suggested to the colony was that of the late Sir
Thomas Mitchell, Surveyor-General of New South Wales, viz.: that that
colony should extend from Bass’ Straits to the tropic of Capricorn or
Rockhampton; alleging that the colony was like a Spread Eagle, of
which Sydney was the head, New South Wales proper the body, and
Port Philip and Moreton Bay the two wings. I had suggested, indeed,
in amendment of this magnificent idea, that it was high time that one of
the wings, Port Phillip, should be lopped off, and that, if it were, Moreton
Bay would soon follow, as it did within ten years thereafter.
On my first visit to Downing-street after my arrival in England, in
December, 1846, Mr. Under-Secretary Hawes informed me that Earl
Grey, who was then Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies, in-
tended very shortly to submit to Parliament a bill for the better govern-
ment of the Australian Colonies, in which the separation of Port Phillip
and various other matters of importance would be provided for ; and he
assured me moreover that, as I was an old colonist and a member of the
Colonial Legislature, Earl Grey would be glad to receive any suggestions
I might be disposed to offer on the subject. On this invitation, I
addressed a series of letters to the Colonial Office, during the three years
I remained in England, offering various suggestions for the forthcoming
Act of Parliament; of which some were adopted, while others were not.
For although Earl Grey’s bill was read for the first time in the House
of Lords in March, 1847, it was withdrawn for that session, after it had
reached the House of Commons, and it reappeared in a subsequent
session with considerable alterations and amendments. I watched its
progress with intense interest during my stay in England ; but it was
not finally passed till the month of August, 1850, some time after I had

returned to the colony; and this unexpected and vexatious delay was
the reason why the actual separation of Port Phillip did not take place
till the Ist of July, 1851.
It is unnecessary to advert to the suggestions I offered in my letters
to the Colonial Office, in regard either to New South AVales proper or to
Port Phillip ; but the suggestion I offered, in reference to Moreton Bay,
was simply that a clause should be inserted in the forthcoming Act of
Parliament, authorizing Her Majesty to separate from New South Wales,
and to erect into a distinct and independent colony, whenever she might
deem it expedient to do so, the territory extending northward from the
thirtieth parallel of south latitude. I submitted a series of reasons for
this recommendation, which it is unnecessary to detail ; and, as I had
observed, with extreme disappointment for the moment, that, in the first
and second editions of the bill (for, if I am not mistaken, there were
three in all), there was no such clause as I had suggested for the pros-
pective separation of Moreton Bay, I urged my suggestions afresh, with
additional reasons, before leaving England; and the matter having been
referred to the Commissioners of Land and Emigration, who were fortu-
nately satisfied of the propriety of the recommendation I had made, the
following clause, to the exact effect I had suggested, was inserted in the
final edition of the bill, and forthwith passed into law.
“If shall be lawful for Her Majesty, from time to time, upon the
petition of the inhabitant householders of any such of the territories in
the said recited proviso, mentioned, as lie northward of the thirtieth
degree of south latitude, to detach such territories from the colony of
New South Wales, and to erect such territories into a separate colony or
colonies, or to include the same in any colony or colonies to be established
under the powers of the last-mentioned Act.”—l3th and 14th Yic.,
Chapter LIX., Section 34.
This, then, was the Magna Charta of the Moreton Bay country, now
Queensland ; for had this clause not been inserted in the Imperial Act
of 1850, the colony of Queensland would not now have been in exist-
ence. The _ thoroughly selfish Squatting Legislature of New South
Wales, which had so strongly resisted the separation of Port Phillip,
would never have consented to that of Moreton Bay. And had I not
remained in England, at a great sacrifice to myself, to plead for my
adopted country, at the proper time when its destinies were in the
balance, there would have been no such clause in the Imperial Act, and
you would still have been, what the people of Port Phillip very fitly
described themselves before their separation was effected, “ the miserable
dependency of a dependency.” The late Duke of Newcastle told your
first governor, when taking leave of him in Downing-street in the year
1859, as Sir George Bowen himself stated to one of your officials shortly
after his arrival in the colony, that “he would not have been Governor
of Queensland but for Dr. Lang.”
You will observe that the line of separation between the colonies of
New South Wales and Queensland was fixed, in the Imperial Act of
1850, agreeably to my original suggestion, at the thirtieth parallel of
south latitude.
Had that boundary line been maintained, the city of Brisbane, with all
the public buildings of your colonial capital, which are now so awkwardly


returned to the colony; and this unexpected and vexatious delay was
the reason why the actual separation of Port Phillip did not take place
till the Ist of July, 1851.

to the Colonial Office, in regard either to New South AVales proper or to
Port Phillip ; but the suggestion I offered, in reference to Moreton Bay,

first governor, when taking leave of him in Downing-street in the year
1859, as Sir George Bowen himself stated to one of your officials shortly
after his arrival in the colony, that “he would not have been Governor
of Queensland but for Dr. Lang.”
You will observe that the line of separation between the colonies of
New South Wales and Queensland was fixed, in the Imperial Act of
1850, agreeably to my original suggestion, at the thirtieth parallel of
south latitude.
Had that boundary line been maintained, the city of Brisbane, with all
the public buildings of your colonial capital, which are now so awkwardly


twenty pounds ; and I arranged with the emigrants accordingly that they
should receive that extent of land on their arrival at their destination.
But the Commmissioners of Land and Emigration, being extremely
jealous of anything like interference with their proper province, and
smarting under an exposure I had made of their ignorance and folly as
a witness on Emigration before a Select Committee of the House of
Lords,* actually wrote out to the local Government, after the sailing of
the “ Fortitude,” recommending, or rather insisting, that no land should
be granted to or for the emigrants by that vessel; and only those of my
emigrants by the third of the three vessels I sent out received land at
* On my arrival in England in December, 1846, shortly after the passing of the
famous Squatting Act of that year, giving fixity of tenure and rights of pre-
emption to the squatters, but making no provision for the acquisition of land to
any extent by the great body of the colonists, I ascertained that there were certain
Orders in Council to be passed by way of supplement which were to be of equal
force with the Act; and Mr. Under-Secretary Hawes told me that Earl Grey would
be pleased if I, as an old colonist and member of Council, would make any such
suggestions as I might think of importance to be embodied in these Orders in
Council. I suggested, accordingly, that two miles should be reserved from the
operation of the Squatting Act from all navigable water, that is from all navigable
rivers and lakes. Such a reservation would have been of no disservice to the
squatters, as land on the banks of rivers or other navigable water is seldom fit for
pastoral purposes, while it would have been of incalculable value for the settlement
of an agricultural population. Its adoption would have taken the sting out of the
Squatting Act, and given a prodigious impulse to the settlement of the country.
But the Land and Emigration Commissioners, to whom my suggestion was referred,
instead of adopting it simply, pretended to refine upon it by making it an Order of
Council that two miles should be reserved for the settlement of an agricultural
population along the banks of the Richmond and Glenelg Rivers, both of which I
had indicated particularly, for twenty miles from the sea. But both of these rivers,
as is the case with bar-mouthed rivers generally, are only five miles from the sea
at twenty miles from their mouth, and the whole of the intervening country con-
sists only of mangrove scrubs utterly useless either for man or for beast.
I had mentioned this case to Lord Monteagle, who had applied to me to give
evidence before a Select Committee of the House of Lords on Emigration, of which
he was Chairman—in 1848 I think; and in the course of my examination His
Lordship asked me, “ Do you mean to say that the Commissioners gave all the good
land to the squatters and reserved only the worthless land for the settlement of an
agricultural population?” “Yes, my lord,” I replied, “that is precisely what I
have said,” and Lord Wharncliffe, one of the Committee, laughed heartily at the
absurdity of the thing.
In short, every piece of eligible land was sure to be covered by some squatter’s
right of pre-emption, and none worth having was left for the rest of the colony.
Take only two instances of the results : A squatter on the Clarence River took his
right of pre-emption on 640 acres of land, the full extent allowed him under the
Act, which authorized him to purchase it at a pound an acre. But as there was no
eligible land for the townspeople to purchase in small quantities, he sold it to them
at the reasonable rate of £3O an acre—thereby demanding and receiving from the
humbler classes of the people £19,200 for the very land which the Government
had allowed him to purchase for £640 ! But the case of the Richmond River was
still worse for the people. There were at one time many cedar-cutters on that
river, some of them with large families, squatting in the bush, earning large wages
and anxious exceedingly to purchase a piece of land to settle on the river bank.
But the river banks, with all the good land, were covered by some squatter’s right
of pre-emption, one of whom, taking offence at a cedar-cutter on his run who had
not only a large family but £BOO which he had saved from his earnings, ordered him
off, and the poor man in despair went at once to the nearest public house and spent
the whole of his money before he left it. Such was government by and for the
squatters in the olden time in New South Wales. No wonder they hate me, as I was
always protesting against the iniquitous system.


all. Had the governor of the day, the late Sir Charles Fitzßoy, been
a man of any discernment, he would at once have recognised the suicidal
character of such a course, and authorized the granting of the small por-
tion of land required to fulfil my engagements with these emigrants in
circumstances so very peculiar. But His Excellency was a mere incapa-
ble who had no mind of his own ; and the people about him, to whom I
had been strongly opposed during four previous sessions of the Legisla-
tive Council, and in the face of whose utmost antagonistic efforts I had
effected the separation of Port Phillip, were actuated by no friendly feel-
ing towards myself, and were rather glad of any opportunity of damaging
my reputation, at whatever loss to the community.
Had I been permitted, at the period in question, by the Government
of New South Wales, to carry out the principle I had advocated, by
ensuring to reputable families and individuals sixteen acres of land foi
every twenty pounds they had paid of passage money, I could, with the
utmost facility, have collected and sent out to Moreton Bay as many as
twenty thousand of as reputable and industrious families and individuals
as ever landed on these shores. But the comparatively small portion of
land, for which I had stipulated in the case -of the emigrants by the
“Fortitude” and “Chasely,” was refused, and the country was left to
stagnate under the then miserable Government of New South Wales,
during the period in question, for other ten years.*
But a noble testimony was at length rendered to the character and the
value of my humble efforts for the welfare and advancement of my
adopted country ; for one of the first acts of the Government of Queens-
land, after the separation of that colony from New South Wales had
been finally effected, was an Act of Parliament guaranteeing as many as
thirty acres of land to every adult emigrant who should be landed cm its
shores; and on submitting to Parliament a bill to that effect, it was
stated by your first Premier, Mr. Herbert, that the principle on which
that bill was based was the one that had been advocated by Dr. Lang.
Acting on that principle, your colony quadrupled its population within
the short period of eight years from 1859, while New South Wales, by
repudiating it, as was done during the whole of that period, and con-
tinues to be so to the present day, was dependent almost exclusively on
the natural increase of its population, and thus exhibited, in melancholy
contrast with the lif® and energy and progress of Queensland, its regular
and accustomed process of stagnation.
Such, then, have been the services I have rendered to your noble
colony, ’ not only in demonstrating the practicability of growing both
cotton and sugar by means of British free labor within its ample terri-
tory, but in effecting its final separation from New South Wales, and in
introducing into it at the most critical period of its history about 600
thorough Protestants to assist in laying the foundations of its futuxe
greatness. . ,
It is surely quite unnecessary for me to say a single word as to the
character and services of the thorough Protestant immigrants whom I

situated at the southern extremity of your coast line, would have been
most conveniently placed at its very centre, while the noble district of
the Clarence River would have been part and parcel of your territory.
But the Squatter Government of New South Wales, annoyed at my
having suggested the thirtieth parallel of latitude as the only proper
boundary line between the colonies of New South Wales and Queens-
land, which I still maintain it was, got the following apparently harmless
proviso inserted in the Constitution Act of 1855, “Provided always that
nothing herein contained shall be deemed to prevent Her Majesty from
altering the boundary of the colony of New South Wales on the north
as to Her Majesty shall seem fit;” and by a species of political legerde-
main they succeeded, with Sir William Denison, the governor, to back
them, in getting the boundary line removed from its only proper place,
the thirtieth parallel of latitude, to Point Danger at the twenty-eighth,
thereby depriving you of so much of the territory assigned you at my
suggestion in the Imperial Act of 1850.
The people of all classes in the Clarence River district were strongly
opposed at the time to this change of the line, and were unanimous in
their strong desire to form part of Queensland, At their earnest request,
I drew up and carried to England two different petitions for annexation
to Queensland —the one before and the other after separation—both of
which were signed by almost every inhabitant of the district; but the
New South Wales Squatter Government of the day got the Duke of
Newcastle, who was then Secretary of State for the Colonies, to carry
out their wishes by rejecting, most unfairly, most tyrannically, the peti-
tions of the Clarence River people. It was a prodigious loss both to
them and to Queensland.
There is only one other point to which I would advert. I found it
necessary, therefore, in organizing a scheme of emigration to Moreton
Bay, with a view to the cultivation of cotton and sugar by means of
British free labor in that district, that the emigrants should not go out
in the Commissioners’ ships, to which they strongly objected, as .being a
system of pauper emigration, but in other and private vessels. When I
had, therefore, made some progress in organizing a body of emigrants to
embark in London for Moreton Bay by the ship “ Fortitude,” I went to
Brighton, where Mr. Under-Secretary for the Colonies, the late Mr. Ben-
jamin Hawes, was then residing during the parliamentary recess of 1848,
to confer with that gentleman on the subject; carrying with me a large
map of the Moreton Bay country which I had caused to be constructed
for the purpose. Mr. Hawes received me very cordially; and after ex-
plaining to him my views and objects, and pointing out to him on the
map the more prominent features of the country, I asked him whether,
in the event of my sending out a large body of emigrants of a superior
character for the very important purpose I have indicated, the local
Government would grant the emigrants a portion of land equivalent, in
every instance, to the cost of their passage out ? Mr. Hawes assured me
he believed they would, as the matter was entirely in the hands of the local
Government, and as my proposal asked nothing more than the Govern-
ment were actually doing at the time in another form. For all I proposed
was that the emigrant should receive eighty acres of land for every hun-
dred pounds of passage money he had paid, or sixteen acres for every


twenty pounds ; and I arranged with the emigrants accordingly that they
should receive that extent of land on their arrival at their destination.
But the Commmissioners of Land and Emigration, being extremely
jealous of anything like interference with their proper province, and
smarting under an exposure I had made of their ignorance and folly as
a witness on Emigration before a Select Committee of the House of
Lords,* actually wrote out to the local Government, after the sailing of

was thus instrumental in introducing into your colony at the very impor-
tant period of their arrival in its territory. Their influence was flrst felt
pretty strongly during the anti-transportation conflict, when the squatters
were almost to a man mad for the resumption of transportation and the
degradation of Queensland into a convict colony. Individuals, moreover,
of their number have been in both houses of Parliament in Queensland,
and in the House of Assembly, before separation, in New South Wales.
It was chiefly to their efforts and agitation, also, that the entire separa-
tion of Church and State was due in their adopted country. And when
it was the usual practice of gentlemen squatters when they came to
Brisbane to appear on the streets on Sabbath in their blouses, or sitting
at tables under the verandahs of public houses, during the hours of divine
service, drinking brandy and water and smoking publicly on the Lord’s
Day, they introduced the decent and becoming practice of appearing in
their Sunday’s clothes and attending divine service regularly on that
sacred day, and were thus instrumental in civilizing the veritable aristoc-
racy of the colony. On one of my voyages to Moreton Bay, I was
asked by a fellow-passenger, a Scotch squatter in the north, how it was
that there were no Jews in Moreton Bay? I replied that I was not
aware of the fact, and could not therefore assign a reason. But having
made a tour on horseback in the interior during my stay—riding up
Cunningham’s Gap to Warwick, then along the Darling Downs to Drayton,
and returning by the northern route—l happened to be asked to deliver a
lecture on the colony on my return at Ipswich. In the course of the
lecture I took occasion to repeat the question that had been put to me
on my way down from Sydney, as to how it was that there were no Jews
in Moreton Bay, stating that I had been enabled to solve the mystery
during my tour; for I had learned that each of the gentlemen squatters
in the interior had a sort of huckstery shop on his run, at which he had
all sorts of commodities for sale to his servants and employes that were
required on a station, all of which he disposed of at fifty or a hundred
per cent, above their fair market price. It was evident, therefore, that
there could be no room for Moses in Moreton Bay, for they were all
Jews there already. Now my immigrants were instrumental in putting
an end to this state of things, by the establishment of honesty and fair
dealing even in the regions of Squatterdom.
If it should be asked how a mere Presbyterian minister could afford
the means of making such sacrifices and exertions as I have detailed, I
may answer that the family of which I was a member arrived in New
South Wales as free emigrants, at a comparatively early period, partly in
1821 and partly in 1824. At that time they acquired a pretty large
amount of valuable property, when it was easily procurable; the whole
of which I inherited, in addition to the portion I had in the mean time
become possessed of myself. That property, which, if I had only re-
tained it, would now have been worth at least from £50,000 to £70,000,*
I have expended in a series of efforts for the welfare and advancement
of my adopted country, extending over a period of upwards of forty years.

have detailed, formed the latest of these items, and subjected me to an
expenditure of not less than five thousand pounds, which is still repre-
sented in a mortgage on my remaining property.
But, strange as it will doubtless seem to every intelligent and candid
person, in the face of the following unanimous Resolution of the very
first Parliament of Queensland, passed 14th September, 1860, on the
motion of that eminent and patriotic colonist, Mr. Justice Lilley, who
was then a leading member of Parliament, “ That the thanks of this
House be given to the Rev. John Dunmore Lang, D.D., for his able and
successful efforts for the separation of Moreton Bay from New South
Wales, and to found the colony of Queensland” —in the face, I say, of
this unanimous Resolution of your first Parliament, the members of the
Legislative Assembly, or, in other words, the squatting majority of your
present Parliament, who negatived the recent motion of my friend Mr,
John Douglas on my behalf, publicly and most decidedly declared that I
never rendered any services whatever to Queensland, either in founding
the colony or in effecting its separation from New South Wales. Now
I cannot possibly receive this decision of these gentlemen as an expres-
sion of their own deliberate opinion—far less as that of the people of
Queensland. They knew better, every man of them ; and the whole
affair was a mere expression of the bitter personal hostility I have almost
uniformly experienced from the whole squatter tribe, with only a few
honorable exceptions, these twenty-five years past.
It is a remarkable fact that there is no man in all these colonies to
whom the squatters are more indebted than to myself. It was I who got
them the franchise, so early as in the year 1844, when both Victoria and
Queensland were part and parcel of New South Wales. I then moved, in
the Legislature or Parliament of New South Wales, for a Select Committee
on the Representation of the Colony, of which Committee I was elected
Chairman ; and my Report, which the Committee adopted, recommended
the granting of the franchise to the squatters, which they never had
before, and which the previous governor, Sir Richard Bourke, would
never have given them. But they no sooner obtained that boon than
they regularly banded together for the advancement of their own exclu-
sive interests, and virtually usurped the government of the country.
And because I uniformly advocated the rights and interests of the people
against the unreasonable and enormous claims of the squatters —which
were unfortunately maintained and promoted, in the grossest injustice to
the great majority of the people, both by the Local and the Imperial
Governments —I Was regarded as their enemy, and treated accordingly.
Squatter Government, in my long-cherished and fixed opinion, has
been the curse of all these colonies to the present day. In New South
Wales—its head-quarters from the first—it seized upon and appropriated
for local purposes the waste lands of the colony, which were recognized
as the property of the people of England, and devoted again and again
by the Imperial Government, for the promotion of immigration from the
United Kingdom. Hence we have had no immigration to speak of in
that colony for twenty years past; and although our resources are at
least doubly valuable, as compared with those of Victoria, we have had,
from that very circumstance, to play second fiddle to that upsetting and
pretentious colony for a series of years past. And what has New South

the people of the Clarence River, it managed to deprive you of your
southern boundary, and the valuable territory which had been assigned
to you by the Imperial Parliament at my suggestion exclusively.
Had that boundary been maintained, the thirtieth parallel and Dawes
Range would now, without question, have been your boundaries, south
and north; and Rockhampton would have been the capital of another
noble colony to the northward years ago.
I cannot therefore receive the ultimatum of the squatter majority of
your Parliament as at all the expression of the views and opinion of you,
the people of Queensland, in reference to myself. Appello populum —l
appeal from the squatters to the people. If they should think otherwise
than the squatters, and act accordingly—good and well. But even if
they should not, it will not break my heart; for I have too long been
accustomed to the spoiling of my goods for the best interests of the
people of my adopted country to care much for it now. lam well aware
I have no claim on your community in point of law; but I have surely
a strong claim in point of equity. It is not, therefore, either an act of
charity or even of benevolence that I look for at your hands, but an act of
simple justice, in expecting that the people of Queensland will assist in
paying some portion at least of the large amount of debt I incurred in
what your first Parliament unanimously acknowledged as my “ able and
successful efforts for the separation of Moreton Bay from New South
Wales and to found the colony of Queensland.”
I remain, Fellow-colonists and Friends,
Your sincere well-wisher,
JOHN DUNMORE LANG.

Wales Squatterdom done for Queensland also ? Why, by a species of
downright chicanery, and in direct opposition to the unanimous voice of
the people of the Clarence River, it managed to deprive you of your
southern boundary, and the valuable territory which had been assigned
to you by the Imperial Parliament at my suggestion exclusively.
Had that boundary been maintained, the thirtieth parallel and Dawes
Range would now, without question, have been your boundaries, south
and north; and Rockhampton would have been the capital of another
noble colony to the northward years ago.

your Parliament as at all the expression of the views and opinion of you,
