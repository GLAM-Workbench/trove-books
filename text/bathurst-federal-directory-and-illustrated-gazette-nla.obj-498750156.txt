Preface.
¥he expressed intention of establishing the capital of Federated Australia in the State
of New South Wales, has been the cause of directing public attention to the inland
towns of this State. The Great Western City of Bathnrst has more than ordinary
claims to be considered as suitable for the Federal City, and a distinct effort has been put
forward hr the publishers of this volume to advocate its indisputable advantages as a
centre.
Bathurst is dealt with from a Directory point of view; giving lists of householders as
they reside in the streets, and a specially compiled list of the Land-holders of the District,
with their addresses, sub-divided into respective sections of sheep farmers, graziers, wheat
growers, dairy farmers, &c. Beaders will find herein a complete alphabetical list of the
-foregoing, and the arrangement of professional gentlemen, merchants, importers, banking
institutions, educational establishments, general storekeepers, skilled mechanics, &c., under
separate headings. Scenes of places of interest in and around Bathurst are pourtrayed by
artistically arranged views on high-class photo process blocks, which are interspersed
through the volume.
Experienced compilers have been engaged in collecting the information, and arranging
the same for publication, whilst the thanks of the publishers are due to the gentlemen of
the Progress Association, Federal Committee, and City Council, for valuable assistance
rendered.

The City of Bathurst.
[By a Visitor from the Land of the Moa.]
The first impressions on the voyageur are, as
a rule, the most lasting, and certainly those
received by any visitor to the city of the
Western district are very favorable, the
opening view from the railway as Bathurst
is approached suggests the habitation of a
healthy and vigorous people ; the city looks
sound, its people give one the impression
that they are satisfied with their locality,
and the actual contact with them proves the
formulated idea as correct, and, further,
that they are proud of their city, and justly
so too, as it is a monument reflecting the
efforts and skill of a self-reliant well-to-do
community. Like all Australian cities those
who have been responsible for its laying out
have conserved for the public good; reserves
and parks for recreation, &c., and in this
respect Bathurst is well supplied, all are
planted with ornamental trees and well
kept, the parterre of the city is Machattie
Park, situated in its very heart. There are
several means of ingress, all of which open
up vistas of beauty of the floral world.
That those whose business it is to tend the
place make it a labor of love is evidenced on
every hand w’hen once the foot of the visitor
treads the clean garden path, on every side
beds of flowers welcome the admirer in the
pride of their life, a handsome compliment
to their guardians. A pretty lakelet bears
on its bosom water birds of various families,
who appear to have a charmed existence,
happy and contented. In the centre of the
park is a large, handsome fountain, which
in full play suggests a scene from fairyland,
whilst in shady positions, under graceful
trees, rustic seats are placed, which of an
evening accommodate the wealth and beauty
of the city, whilst music is discoursed in the
well appointed rotunda by the famous band
of the district. The streets of Bathurst are
all fine and broad, and cut each other at
right angles, so that the city is one of
squares. The principal buildings are fine
structures, and the designs of the Post De-
partment, Courthouse, Telegraph Depart-
ment, &c., are happily conceived. H.M.’s
Gaol, which is some two miles away from
the city, covers an extensive area, and is
healthily positioned, as is also the Hospital,
which is one of the finest in the State. The
Educational structures—All Saints and St.
Stanislaus’ Colleges— which have a great
reputation, are replete with all the require-
ments for instruction, and are presided over
by highly cultured gentlemen, who have as-
sociated with them competent assistants.
These two colleges have given Australia
some of her ablest men, who now hold high

and honored positions in the ladder of fame
in statemanship, law, medicine, in the
journalistic world, and commerce. The
State School occupies a central site, has
great accommodation, and is ably managed,
as are also the several private schools, and
the Roman Catholic Convent School. Two
noble Cathedrals represent the heads of the
great religions—Roman Catholic and Angli-
can—the former is most sumptuously fur-
nished, and has splendid seating accommo-
dation, and the latter, although not so large
as the former, is every bit as well appointed.
The Presbyterian, Wesleyan, and Baptist
denominations have fine places of worship,
and a capacious Barracks ministers to the
followers of the Salvation Army belief.
Bathurst is a great music centre, and the
hall of the School of Arts, which is very
spacious and well ventilated, provides the
city with its locale for amusement. Located
in the main street is a School of Mines,
Museum, and Technical Education branch,
all of which are well patronised. Bathurst
is well provided with hotels, which are man-
aged by sterling men, the principal ones
being as well appointed as any in Australia.
The great Banking Institutions have branches
in the city, and the commercial houses on a
business day exhibit brisk activity, as well as
the various ironfoundries and manufactories,
Ac. The three well conducted, up-to-date
newspapers, the “ Bathurst Free Press,”
“ Daily Times,” and the “National Advo-
cate,” which are published daily, chronicle
events of local interest, as well as give
telegraphic news of importance from all
parts of Australia, the United Kingdom,
and other parts of the world. The
Macquarie River meanders through the
grazing and farming lands of the dis-
trict, and skirts the northern end of the
town. It is a placid stream, and great
sport is to be obtained on it by those pisca-
torially inclined. Go where you will beyond
the actual business area but in the city
boundary, and the eye is pleased with pretty
villas, each one having its own flower garden,
neatly and well kept. On the outskirts
are the stately mansions of the wealthy
wool kings of the West, embellished with
all the accessories of a country gentleman’s
demesne. Bathurst is, indeed, a model city,
and its people are earnest and go-ahead.
There is nothing unnecessary or make be-
lieve about the place ; it is solid, and more-
over, what the city undertakes to do it does
well—there are no half measures. The
hospitality of its residents is proverbial, and
the beauty and grace of its women has been
universally acknowledged.

Claims to Federal Capital.
One of the first questions to be settled by
the Federal Parliament is the selection of a
site for the capital city, and the claims of
the Bathurst district are by no means of the
least importance. Much has been said in favor
of other parts of the State of New Wales
but none can compete with this district for
all-round excellence of position either from
a sanitary point of view, a health resort, or
from immunity to assault by an enemy
landing with aggressive intentions on the
shores of Australia. It must be apparent
that the State capital should be so placed
that attack on it would be almost impossible,
and it is also of vital importance that the
capital should be in a self-supporting district,
and not depend for the absolute existence of
its inhabitants or defenders upon the trans-
portation of supplies with an active enemy
against it. Nature, when placing the vast
dividing range of the Blue Mountains,
seems to have conceived in the plains of the
west a certain and secure spot for a great
city. The great mountain fastnesses of the
Transvaal and Philippines have demon,
strated the immense advantage held by a
defending army. That wars of the future
will be short, sharp, and decisive, as regards
battles at sea, has been proved both in the
China-Japan and the Spanish-Atnerican
wars, but that where the contest comes to a
decision on land the trial will be protracted
and wearying—how much therefore is it
necessary to have the State capital built in
an almost impregnable position, and that
position is in the Western district supplied
by the Bathurst Plains. On the land side
of the Blue Mountains bounteous Nature has
provided all that man wants to sustain life.
The great plains, with their vast undulating
areas of grass, bear huge flocks of sheep and
cattle ; they are well watered, and below the
surface have untold millions of wealth in
coal to heat and melt the iron from the
mountain fringes, the metal from which man
makes his implements to wrest from the
earth her secrets and stores of wealth, his
machines of commercial industry, &c., as
well as his relentless engines of war. Agri-
cultural statistics prove that the Bathurst
plains support acres of wheat, maize, oats #
barley, potatoes, &c., and live stock, pigs,
sheep, cattle and horses. The claim of
Bathurst, therefore, is such that with the
whole of the coast from the Tweed to the
Bega in the hands of a devastating enemy,
she could repose in the security of her posi-
tion buttressed by the great dividing range,
and defy assault, her people in the meanwhile
carrying on the industries necessary to sus-
tain life, as well as the operations to repel
invasion of their territory. From a strate-
gical point of view the position of Bathurst
is unassailable.

Material for Building.
For years the greatest architects of the
world have had the master pieces of their
constructive plans spoilt by not having been
able to command the use of the finest stones
of the earth except at an enormous cost—
granite and marble. The great halls of
aucient Koine were built of marble. The
finest sculptured models of the day are of
marble. The embellishments of latter-day
buildings are of marble and granite. Rome
obtained her marble from the famous quar-
ries at her door, and hitherto the Italian
quarries have supplied the world with marble,
but Rome is not the only place in the uni-
verse where marble is to be obtained.
Quarries of an extensive area exist close to
the city of Bathurst, producing some of the
finest varieties and specimens known. Any
sound-minded man, given a healthy locality
with the necessary favorable conditions to
sustain life, would not be idiotic enough to
travel miles away and leave the good things
at his feet, nor does it seem feasible that the
sober mi tided, stolid, sound statesmen, to
whom will bo delegated the onerous duty of
choosing a Federal capital, will wander away
from a district possessing a gift of the gods
in]the marvellous stone deposits oE granite
and marble which abound around the city
of Bathurst.

Room for Expansion.
The City of Bathurst, to any mind not
politically distorted for some especial per-
sonal or communal gain to l>e obtained,
presents undoubtedly the first claim to
consideration as a federal capital on account
of the magnificent area at the command
of the present city for expansion. The
city has been termed by some writers the
“ City of the Plains,” and in that respect
they are correct. No one has come forward
to deny or, by abstruse argument, demon-
strate that Bathurst is not a city built
on the plains, these plains being the
plains of the western district of the State
of New South Wales. That being so, it
is beyond cavil that there must be room
for expansion. Australia is a wealthy
continent, but not so wealthy that it can
afford to experiment on virgin lands, and
Bathurst affords every facility for the
building of a great city. It would seem
absurd for the Commonwealth surveyors
and architects to spend valuable time in
laying out a city on a site the subterranean
formation of which would not stand the
erection of a pile of buildings suitable for
the requirements of commercial purposes,
let alone those necessaries for the conduct
of a great industrial enterprise or the
palatial offices that would be demanded
and expected by the *peopleTof Australia
for the conduct of the affairs of theyfede-
ration and the royal housing of the go-
verning representative of the Imperial
authorities. The land round the city of
Bathurst has been proved to be the top
strata of a very solid substratum, and for
squares of miles around the present con-
ditions exist. That being so, no difficulty
should exist in choosing this much favoured
place for the federal city. Comment is
unnecessary. No unbiased mind could
have but one conclusion, and that is in its
favour.

Mining.
Alluvial mining is a great source of re-
venue to any country, and in that respect
Bathurst is especially blest. Sixty years
ago gold was found in the sand and in the
hills on the Fish River, and from that day
onward gold mining has flourished through-
out the territory. Copper has also been
discovered, as well as silver. It is quite
within the bounds of possibility that greater
discoveries in minerals will be made, and
that this industry will flourish tenfold. Now
that the Federation of the States' of Aus-
tralia has been accomplished, a large influx
of speculators, Ac., will exploit the continent
of Australia. Gold mining has always been
a seduction to the people of the world, and
that industry is bound to receive a great
deal of attention. There are hundreds of
miles of alluvial country about Bathurst,
and with the increased population eager,
active, and determined, the mineral wealth
of the plains will be secured.

Bathurst as a Sanatorium.
Healthy surroundings make a healthy
people. Bright, clear air makes bright,
clear minds. The district of Bathurst
possesses the surroundings and the air.
The close of the nineteenth century wit-
nessed business conducted at high pressure.
The twentieth, which is now opened, will,
no doubt, witness a feverish haste in the
amassing of wealth. It has always been
the main object of founders of new cities to
study the hygiene of the site chosen, all
due regard being given to the fall of the
land for the carrying away of all foul
matter and refuse. The federal city of
Australia will undoubtedly be very populous,
and in time will carry a citizenship as
large as the cities of the old world. The
lessons to be learned from the city of Wash-
ington, U.S.A.—“ the city of distances”—
the laying out of the streets of which was
ridiculed as being too long and too broad,
is still fresh in our minds. The streets of
Washington are now found not in any way
too long or too broad, as the city has grown
to enormous proportions. The Australian
federal city surveyors will probably arrange
for even wider streets than those which
exist in Washington for the reason that
where plenty of air is catered for there must
be also health. The plains of Bathurst
have been visited for many years past by
those in search of recuperation for debili-
tated constitutions, and, except where the
case has been absolutely hopeless the de-
sired cure has been effected. The mean
altitude of the city of Bathurst is approxi-
mately 2300 feet above the level of the sea,
and the mean summer temperature for four
years was 84, whilst that for the winter
months was G2—a truly equable and in-
vigorating climate. The air on the plains
is clear and dry, and even on the hottest
summer day there is an absence of that
depressing humidity which is so trying.

The following reports were submitted to Mr.
Oliver, Commissioner, when recently taking evi-
dence for the Federal Capital site: —
BY W. PRITCHARD BASSETT.
This is a question of the greatest importance to
the future Federal Capital, and as no town in New
South Wales that is over 100 miles from Sydney
has at present an adequate supply for the Federal
city, it will be necessary for the Federal Parlia-
ment to provide same, hence it is of the greatest
importance to have the capital placed in a locality
where practically an unlimited supply can be ob-
tained. In this respect Bathurst is most favorably
situated, as there are two sources of supply within
a short distance of the city, one by gravitation, and
the other partly gravitation and partly pumping.
The gravitation scheme is what is usually known
as the Winburndale supply, in this instance high
dams would have to be buiit to conserve the water,
which would then be brought in open trenches
and pipes to the town, a distance of between 12
an l 1') miles. The water for this supply would be
obtained from the Winburndale and Gulf Creeks
at a point about (>OO feet above the city. This
source of supply was favourably reported upon by
the late j\lr. Clark, but the estimated cost was more
by £lO.OOO than the scheme carried out by the
Government. The other scheme is to dam Camp-
bell's Fiver at the Lagoon, a dam here about fifty
feet high and about quarter mile long in the
bottom, and not more than three quarters mile
long at the top, would impound as much water in
the Prospect dam from which the Sydney supply
is drawn, and in order to increase the supply it
would only be necessary to increase the height of
dam, which could be done up to 100 feet. The
water would be supplied by Campbell’s Fiver and
its tributaries, some of which have never been
known to be dry, and which drain an area of over
400 square miles. It would have to be brought
about 0 miles by pipes to town, and would supply
all places in the city not more than 50 feet above
the Town Hall by gravitation. For the higher
positions of the town the water would have to be
pumped to the present or new reservoirs. The
nature of the country about the site of the pro-
posed dam is of granite formation.
Sewerage.
This is a matter of as great importance as water
supply, and in this respect Bathurst is also favor-
ably situated, as the whole slope of the city and
land adjoining the same is to one point, viz., the
junction of the Jordan Creek with the Fiver, and
from this point the sewerage can be carried by
gravitation any distance down the river it may be
thought desirable, but about five miles down the
river there is an admirable place for a sewersge
farm, where the whole of the matter could be satis-
factorily dealt with, and should, if arranged pro-
perly, be a source of profit.
Statement in Reference to the Capabili-
ties of the Bathurst District for
Grazing, Raising, and Fattening
Stock—from Personal Experience.
BY JAMES CASSIDY
Auctioneer, Bathurst, and
Jno. J. Sullivan, Grazier, Allowat
Bank, Bathurst.
Cattle Raising. —Every facility for this object.
Grazing and Fattening Stock. —Good rich
pastures, abundantly supplied with natural and
artificial grasses ; plenty water and shelter.
Market Supplies, Fat Stock, Cattle, Sheep,
Pigs —The Bathurst fat stock market is un-
doubtedly the best outside Flemington, Holding
sales twice a week can always command a never-
failing supply of fat cattle, fat sheep, and pigs.
In addition to the cattle fattened in the district
there are several graziers owning large stations in
the West who make their properties in this dis-
trict depots for keeping their stock before sending
to market. This stock can always be available if
required. Very many stock-owners in the far
west prefer sending their stock to this market, it
being so centrally situated, easy of access either by
road or rail.
Fruit Growing.
BY A. PATTERSON.
The capabilities of fruit growing in the Bathurst
district are most favorable, especially as regards
English fruits, such as apples, pears, cherries,
strawberries, raspberries, plums, &c. The whole of
the country around Vetholme, Kirkconnell and
Peel is the most suitable part of the district for
fruit growing, both as regards the suitability of
the soil, consisting as it does of mostly volcanic
soil, as well as position of aspect. The lainfall
in those parts of the district renders the locality
favorable for establishing this industry.


Mineral Products and Capacity of the
Bathurst District to Support Popu-
lation, also Conditions Favourable
to Commercial and Industrial De-
velopment.
This district is undoubtedly rich in minerals.
Large numbers of persons have earned their living
by mining for many years past, and it has the
honor of being the first place where gold was dis-
covered. On the Fish River, about 15 miles from
Bathurst, near Locksley, on the 16th February,
1823, gold was found in the sand, and in the hills
convenient to the river. (See Assistant-Surveyor
James Mcßrian’s field book as per “ The Wealth
and Progress of New South Wales, 1897-8,”
page 214.)
In 1841 the Rev. W. B. Clarke found gold in
the Macquarie Valley.
In 1851 Mr. E. Hammond Hargraves found
alluvial deposits in the Lewis Ponds and Summer
Hill Creeks, through the Messrs. James and
William Tom, of Springfield, Byng, and Mr. John
Lister.
According to “The Wealth and Progress of
New South Wales, 1897-8,” page 219, out of the
whole of the districts shown for alluvial mines the
Bathurst district stands first, being over 1000 ozs.
ahead of the next place in the total, and shows the
splendid average of 11 dwts. 6 grs. per ton, as
against the next place, the Southern district, with
only 5 dwts.
In addition to the alluvial mines, the district
takes a good place in the reefs, standing fourth on
the list in 1897, as published in the same authority
named above.
Copper was found in large quantities, years ago,
at the Icely and Carangara and Bunnamagoo
mines, later at Low Flat and Blayney, aud more
recently at Burraga.
Silver was found in large quantities at Sunny
Corner and Lew is Ponds.
Conditions Favourable to Commercial
and Industrial Development.
Cheap coal, lovely climate, large population, and
railways connecting numerous large centres, with
splendid facilities for further improvements.

ing table

omitting Coast, Sydney,
Hunter, and Hawkesbury

Building Material.
Report of Building Material procurable in the
locality of Bathurst.
BY J. J. COPEMAN.
Stone. —Within a radius of one mile of the city
there exists an inexhaustable supply of Basalt
suitable for coursed rubble walling and found-
ations. Granite also abounds in large quantities,
the value of which, as a building stone, rs unsur-
passed.
Within a distance of 30 to 40 miles splendid
sandstone quarries could be opened up.
Marble. —Quite close to Bathurst marble quar-
ries have recently been opened up, producing some
of the finest varieties and specimens in the world.
Bricks, Ac. —With the unlimited supply of
suitable soil at our disposal Bathurst produces a
bright, red brick of close texture, impervious to
water, and second to none in the colony.
Also a soil which will produce pottery and red
rooting tiles equal to imported manufactures.
At a depth of 100 feet below the Basalt pre-
viously referred to, there exists a large deposit of
white clay, which produces an excellent cream
building brick, and also fire clay and tire bricks;
these latter have been tested by Government ex-
perts, and preferred to imported materials; large
quantities are already being supplied to the Gov-
ernment Railways, Gasworks, Ac-
Lime. —During the past fifty years lime has been
burned in the vicinity of Bathurst, and for build-
ing purposes is equal to any in the colony,
Sand. —In the bed of the river there is an unex-
haustable supply of clean, sharp sand, also large
quantities of gravel suitable for concrete.
Iron.— At Lithgow the large iron woiks can
supply galvanised roofing iron, and all descriptions
of iron required for building purposes.

ST. STANISLAUS’ COLLEGE,
Telephone No- 39- BATHURST.
CONDUCTED BY THE VINCENTIAN FATHERS.
r Under the patronage of the Right Rev. Dr. Byrne, Lord Bishop of Bathurst.
THE CLIMATE of Bathurst is the most HEALTHY and INVIGORATING in New South Wales-
The COLLEGE, in EXAMINATION RESULTS, takes rank among the FIRST ; but THE PRINCIPAL
END the Vincentian Fathers have in view is to impart a TRAINING that will enable their pupils to fulfil
both SUCCESSFULLY and HONORABLY the duties of the various states of life. This SYSTEM of
Education is THOROUGH ;it is MODERN. Boys are prepared for Every Position—Professional, Com-
mercial, &c.. &c. Special arrangements have been made to meet the requirements of the Civil Service
Competitive Examinations. NO SUBJECT of the comprehensive course of studies is an EXTRA.
A Library, well supplied with select authors ; a Physics Hall, containing a collection of instruments
second to none in the colony ; a Laboratory, fully equipped for the practical study of chemistry ; and a
Museum, in which the exhibits are various and instructive, testify to the care that is taken to have the
pupils supplied with everything necessary to acquire an education suitable to the times. There is also a
Spacious Indoor Recreation Hall. The Fathers who.conduct the college pay the strictest attention to the
Social, Moral, and Religious Training of their pupils. Reports of Conduct and Studies are sent periodical-
ly to Parents and Guardians. Three months’ notice or equivalent pension required before withdrawal of a
pupil. For Terms and Further Particulars, apply to THE PRESIDENT.

Colleges.
ALL SAINTS’ COLLEGE,
BATHURST.
The College founded in 1875, is on a hill o ver-
looking Bathurst, and stands within its own
10 acre block. Being essentially a Church of
England school, the visitor is naturally the
Lord Bishop of Bathurst; whilst the religious
instruction is chiefly in the hands of the Very
Rev. the Dean of Bathurst, and the Bev. E.
H. Lea. Under the control of the Eev. Ed-
win Bean, M.A., All Saints’ became the most
important Anglican School of the great west-
ern districts, and after a management extend-
ing over eleven successful years, Mr. Bean
returned to England, and the Bev. F. Tracey,
M.A., reigned in his stead. Under the new
regime, All Saints’ continued to progress, and
to gain a high percentage of passes in all
University examinations. The number of
students increased steadily and satisfactorily,
till the long continued succession of droughts
began to make its evil effects felt in the whole
of the central parts of the colony. But the
School’s good name, built up by Mr. Bean and
maintained by Mr. Tracey, together with
Bathurst’s growing reputation as a health-
centre, enabled Mr. Tracey to weather the
storm. After steering the school safely
through its crisis, and seeing it once more on
its way to prosperity, 'Mr. Tracey resigned
and went homo to England, returning after
two years to Bathurst, where as Warden he
continues to take an official interest in the
school. The present head master served un-
der Mr. Bean for one year, and under Mr.
Tracey for ten. He is assisted by three resi-
dent masters, each of whom is a graduate and
an honor man, and two visiting masters.

Bathurst is the best starting place for the famous Jenolan Caves, which occupies a
journey of less than G hours. This route is the finest for scenery, and the road is perfect.
Leaving Bathurst the Macquarie River is traversed for about 12 miles. Passing through
O’Connell, the surrounding agricultural country is the finest in the West. The historic
Black Mick Mountain is ascended, then the town of Oberon noted for its farming and Gold
mining ; then from the Duck Maloy River to the Caves, through the wild rugged mountain
passes, hold the traveller spell-bound at the awful magnificence of its surroundings. In-
tending visitors should travel by this route, as it is acknowledged to be the best. Parties
arranged at very moderate terms.

Flour Millers.
CRAGO, F.,
National Roller*
Flour Mills.
Complete Gradual Reduction Roller System.
In March 1899, the National Mills, Bathurst,
were converted into Roller Mills, and from
time to time the latest and most improved
machinery has been added, making it one of the
best and most complete mills in the Colony, its
present capacity being fifteen sacks per hour.
At this Mill the celebrated SNOWDRIFT flour is
manufactured. Finding his business very rapidly
increasing Mr. Crago erected the Federal Mills in
1896, where the far-famed DIAMOND flour is made,
the joint capacity of the two mills being four
hundred and thirty tons per week. A ready
market is found for these brands of flour from
our Wanaaring in the North West to Bega on the
South Coast, and branch offices have been estab-
lished in Newcastle, Brisbane and China.
