LETTS?S
CATALOGUES OF MAPS, CHARTS, &c.
MESSRS. LETTS, as agents to H.M.'s Board of Ordnance and the Geological Society, have during the
last 40 years been unceasingly collecting the best works of the above description from every approved
source, both at home and abroad. The tourist, the civil and mining engineer, the railway promoter, the
merchant, the gentleman, and the instructor of youth have all been equally considered, and the adver-
tisers believe their collection will repay inquiring into its merits. In reference to the Ordnance and
Geological Maps of England, Scotland, and Ireland, few works of their character approach them in value,
especially when their easy access and extremely moderate price are taken into consideration. But the
productions of France, Austria, Switzerland, and Prussia, with some others, have their respective merits,
and no pains have been spared to arrive at a correct estimation. The Atlases and Globes are all of
them either modern productions or corrected up to a late date, and in the present state of intelligence
should always go hand in hand with the daily newspaper. Globes, although but seldom used, are the
best channel to convey a Just notion of relative positions, sizes, distances, and climates.
The following Catalogues and Lists (any one of which will be forwarded on application) of Maps,
Atlases, etc., embrace the selection of every good Publisher in this and Foreign Countries, regardless of
price or scale:?

The President said, before he called upon the Secretary to read the com-
munications (which were exclusively upon Australia), it was his painful duty
to announce the failure of two African expeditions, upon the success of which
geographers had set their hearts. Those who had attended the meetings of the
Society would recollect that the greatest importance had been attached to
an expedition fitted out by Baron Charles von der Decken, a Hanoverian
nobleman, to explore the interior of Africa from the east coast, proceeding
from Zanzibar and ascending one of the rivers of that coast. For this purpose
he had fitted out two steamers entirely at his own expense, and provided the
expedition with every sort of material to enable it to succeed. This was the
same vigorous explorer who was the first to really settle that great question
of a snowy mountain under the equator, the mountain of Kilimandjaro. The
news which has just been communicated by Col. Playfair, our Consul at
Zanzibar, now in England, was to the effect that the Baron had lost both his
steamers on the bar of the River Jub ; was nearly dead himself with cholera
or dysentery; and that his party had been in collision with the natives.
The other, but much more partial failure, was that of M. Du Chaillu, who
had most nobly appropriated all the little fortune he had gained by the
sale of his work to the fitting out of a fresh expedition. He had been in the
first place delayed because his instruments were lost by the upsetting of a
canoe; but he waited for fresh instruments, and in the mean time devoted him-
self to the collection of objects of natural history. After shipping these to
England, and thus supplying the British Museum with numerous fine speci-
mens of the gorilla and other animals, he at last proceeded upon his travels
into the interior; and all that was heard of him was that he had penetrated
into the Ashira country, and gone far beyond the point he attained during his
former journey. He had undergone great difficulties, apparently ; but nothing
further had been communicated until the receipt of a telegram on Saturday
evening last from Dartmouth, in these words : 45 Obliged to fight my way
back to the coast; wounded twice; astronomical observations and journals
saved; will be in town on Monday. ?? Notwithstanding this calamitous
result, he (the President) was very happy to find that the conclusion of the
telegram assured us that this adventurous explorer had preserved his observa-
tions, which would undoubtedly be of great value, and the Society would
hope to hear shortly from his own lips, at one of its meetings, the knowledge
he had obtained in this expedition.
The following Papers were read ?
1. An Overland Expedition from Port Denison , Queensland , to Cape York ,
under the command of Messrs. F. and A. Jardine. By Mr. Richardson,
Surveyor to the Expedition.
(Communicated by Sir George Bowen, Governor of Queensland, through
the Colonial Office.)
Tins was an account of a remarkable journey undertaken for the
purpose of discovering a route whereby live stock could be


taken by land from the interior Queensland pastures to supply the
new settlement of Somerset, at Cape York. As the country to he
travelled over, namely, the central and western portions of Cape
York peninsula, was totally unexplored, a surveyor, Mr. Eichard-
son, was attached to the party; and this gentleman, besides writing
the account of the journey, had furnished a minute and elaborate
map of the route, which was exhibited to the meeting. The party
left Eockhampton on 14th of May, 18C4, and reached Somerset on
the 11th of March, 1865. In the months of October and November
they traversed the country watered by the rivers Lynd and
Mitchell, of which they report very unfavourably. Further to the
north most of their horses died, apparently from eating a poisonous
herb : death was preceded by excessive sweating, blindness, and
contraction of the stomach. On leaving the west coast of the Gulf
in January (lat. 14� s.), and striking eastward, good pastoral country
was discovered?a great relief from the wretched region they had
traversed since leaving the banks of the Lynd. Numerous creeks
were crossed, the intervening spaces covered with long, coarse,
dense grasses and sweet-smelling herbs. On the 24th of January
they discovered a new river flowing westward into the Gulf, which
they named the Jardine. The site of the town of Somerset is said
by the explorers to be admirably selected, on the south west side of
the channel (800 yards wide) which separates the mainland from
Albany Island.
This paper will be printed in extenso in ?Journal,? vol. xxxvi.,
with a map of the route.
2. On the Lstablishment of a New Settlement , Cardwell , in Rockingham
Bay , and the Discovery of a Route over the Coast Range to the Valley of
Lagoons. By George Elphinstone Dalrymple, Esq.
(Communicated by Sir George Bowen, Governor of Queensland.)
The new settlement (Cardwell), promoted by Sir G. Bowen, Go-
vernor of Queensland, was founded in the month of January, 1864,
by Mr. Dalrymple and his party, on the site previously marked out
by Captain G. 11. Eichards, R.N., in Buckingham Bay. The shores
of the bay?in the tropical parts of Queensland?are described as
mountainous, together with the islands of various sizes which lie
ofl its entrance. The mountains rise to the height of 3500 to 4000
feet, and their slopes and the plains at their feet are clothed with a
dense and luxuriant tropical vegetation, resembling the most pic-
turesque parts of Ceylon. The pastoral districts of this part of
Queensland, to which Eockingham Bay should naturally serve as


an outlet, lie on the table-land and in the elevated valleys beyond
these precipitous ranges; it was, therefore, a vital object with the
new settlers to discover a route capable of being made into a dray-
road between the uplands and the port. An attempt had been made
the previous year, b} r Mr. Dalrymple and Mr. A. J. Scott, to reach
the coast from the interior, but it had failed, owing to the density
of the forest and the steepness of the ravines in the mountains. Mr,
Dalrymple, after establishing the colonists near Point Hecate, pro-
ceeded, with a party of troopers and natives, to make another attempt
from the port, directing his course towards a gap in the wall-like
range. He found that here the ridge was surmountable, and on the
opposite side discovered a river, which he named the Herbert,
flowing from the table-lands through a fertile valley to the coast,
leaping into the plains beneath in a magnificent cascade. Reaching
the cattle stations in the Valley of Lagoons, he returned to the
settlement, and invited all the men to assist in making a road fit for
wheeled vehicles. This was eventually accomplished. The dis-
tance by the road is 96 miles, and this road now connects all the
interior country, and the banks of the Flinders, Lynd, and Burdekin,
with the shores of the Pacific.
This communication will be printed entire in the ? Journal,? vol.
XXXV.
3. Boat Voyage from Adam Bay to Champion Bay, along the North and
West Coasts of Australia. By J. P. Stow, Esq., J.P., Adelaide.
My last letter closed on the sth of May, and I fear its contents were
anything but cheering to those interested in the Northern Territory.
I am able now to give you news of the party, of whom I was one,
that sailed from Adam Bay in the Forlorn Hope. On the departure
of the Bengal, about fifty persons were left in the settlement. Of
these, about forty were intending to leave by the first opportunity.
It was well known that the time elapsing before the next advices
from Adelaide would be wasted. The universal depression occasioned
by the disappointed hopes and dreary prospects of the settlers and
members of the expedition was relieved by the excitement of the two
days on which the Forlorn Hope left the Cliffs and the Narrows.
The main object of most of the members of the crew of this little
craft was, of course, to return to Adelaide; but several, including
myself, wished to visit different parts of the coast of our own
territory. After this was effected, we were to proceed to Camden
Harbour, and if a vessel was there bound for Swan River, Melbourne,
or Adelaide, to sail by her; if not, to continue coasting till we fell


in with, a vessel, or reached Fremantle, when the voyage of our boat
was to end. We thought we should meet with numerous places of
shelter about the coast and among the islands, but found, to our cost,
how little we knew of the character of both. A few, and among them
sailors, prognosticated a fatal issue fo our voyage; but the unutter-
able disgust with which we contemplated the prospect of months of
forced inactivity, determined us to venture. We purchased the boat
on the 4th from the Bengal , and brought her on shore. She was
23-J feet in length, 6 feet across the beam, and 2 feet deep. She
had two masts and spritsails, to which we added a jib. On the sth
wo had washboards added to her, and a little decking and tarpaulin
on the bows and stern, thus guarding as far as possible against
shipping water, and at the same time making lockers for our pro-
visions. On the 6th, after the departure of the Bengal, we got our
luggage and provisions on board. We had 200 lbs. of bread and
biscuit, some cheese, 20 G-lb. tins of beef, a few medical comforts,
some cakes, about 70 gallons of water, and some firewood. We
carried as little luggage as possible, and a chest with photographic
apparatus belonging to Messrs. Hamilton and Hake.
In the course of the afternoon all preparations were completed,
and the people of Adam Bay collected to bid us farewell. At 10 a.m.
on the 7th we went on board, and I may as well give here the pas-
senger-list : ?J. P. Stow, Arthur Hamilton, and Wm. McMinn (sur-
veyors), John White and James Davis (seamen), and Chas. Hake
and Francis Edwards, men of the survey parties. Messrs. Hamilton
and McMinn were to determine our course, and John White, an
experienced boatman, who had been in the pilot service in Victoria,
and was well-known at Port Adelaide, was to have the management
of the boat. Francis Davis was also an able seaman. We had maps
from Melbourne, tracings from the charts of the captain of the Bengal ,
two sextants, and several pocket compasses. We took leave of our
fellow-victims on the banks of the Adelaide, and on pushing off wore
encouraged on our way by great and continued cheering, while
parting volleys were fired from carbines and revolvers. Some of the
camp, including G. McMinn, C. Hulls, W. Stow, and others, accom-
panied us for some distance in a dingy. They hoisted a blanket for
a sail, but not being able to steer very close to the wind, we took
them in tow, and sailed down the river against the tide, through the
mouth, and for some miles towards Point Charles, across the bay,
leaving the Beatrice and the Cliffs far to the right. Soon we ap-
proached the open sea, and it was necessary for the dingy to return.
What a parting that was on the waters of Adam Bay between friends
and brothers! ?some embarked on an adventure full of novelty, and


not destitute of peril; others doomed to months of weariness and
monotony.
We passed the Vernon Islands early in the afternoon, taking the
inner channel, and going over shoals. Good winds most of the day.
After sundown weather looked threatening, and we had a stiff breeze ;
but about 7 p.m. the weather cleared, and the wind abated. We had
pleasant breezes most of the night. How beautiful when the moon
rose, and spread its silvery light upon the calm water. We became
sentimental. The everlasting ocean could never really become
monotonous ; one could never tire of gazing upon its broad expanse
and watching it in its various moods. Waking and sleeping, in
dreams and reverie, the first night passed away.
At daylight on the Bth we saw the mainland, and during the day
sailed over a reef marked on our chart, and passed the entrance of
Port Paterson, coast low and dreary. Native fires all along the
coast. At about 8 p.m. were stopped by reefs, and turned to the
west, when we were again stopped and anchored. At 1 a.m, on tho
9th, at low water, found ourselves surrounded by reefs, and were
thankful for our escape from shipwreck. At high-water the reefs
were all out of sight, and we sailed pleasantly enough for three or
four hours, when the wind shifted, and we went to seaward till tho
sea became so rough that we tacked to the east and ran in shore,
anchoring about 11 a.m., two miles from a sandy beach, free from
breakers. Heavy rain and wind. Remained at anchor till the
morning of the 10th. We had a rough sea and high wind with a
good deal of rain. We were saturated with rain and spray, and
some of our bread was injured. An uncomfortable night, but all
slept a good deal?some soundly. At 7-30 steered for the main-
land. At 3'30 Cape Blaze bore s.w,, distant about 8 miles, and a
fine range of hills?l should say 40 miles distant s,e.le.
Sailing very near the coast. Plenty of fish, and among them kan-
gai?oo fish, so called from the fact that they leap along the surface of
the water on their tails. Heard snipe and plover on shore ; sandflies
visited us from the land. At 5 p.m, sighted the peak of Peron Island.
The sea became rough, and not knowing the passage into Anson Bay,
where wo intended to call, we made for the shore, and anchored at
10 p.m., about 2 miles from the land, in 6 fathoms water. During
the night the wind was cold and violent, with a rough sea. Our
anchor being light, wo drifted Bor 10 miles to the north-west. At
sunrise, on the 11th, we were out of sight of Peron Island, but wo
soon sighted it. The peak of the island first becomes visible, appear-
ing like a solitary rock, but soon tho rest of the island shows itself,
and afterwards the smaller island. Winds light and variable, some-


times dying away altogether. There being a dead calm, anchored
about 8 r.M, Numerous fires on the island and along the coast.
Heard natives cooeying and wild dogs howling.
On the 16th, shortly after daylight, saw the Barthelemy Hills.
Calms and light winds all day till about 4-30 r.M. Steered for what
looked like an opening in the bight, between Cape Dombey and Cape
Hay. On approaching, found this appearance of an opening which
we hoped would prove to be a river, was occasioned by a break in
the line of bushes that grew along the coast. This spot is left blank
in the Admiralty charts. About dark, we anchored in 1\ fathoms
at the sandy beach. There was a large mangrove creek close to us
on our right. Just before dark, saw large flights of cockatoos. During
the night heard birds and the howl of the dingo on shore. Mosquitos
troublesome the early part of the night, but they died or became
torpid as the cold increased.
17th. ?At sunrise noticed other mangrove creeks in the distance on
each side of us. Landed, walking through soft mud, and afterwards
got the boat on hard sand. Numerous tracks of natives and dingoes
on the beach. At breakfast a dingo made its appearance, and wo
thought of shooting it, till it was suggested that it belonged to the
natives. It made cautious approaches, now and then lying down,
and watching us. It had a cord round its neck. It took no notice
of the report of firearms. At last it sniffed food, and its advance
became very rapid till we threw it some meat. After tasting this it
ate out of a plate and then from our hands, and finally showed its
gratitude and the delicacy of its habits by cleaning all our dishes
and cooking utensils, and remained at our fire all day. At about
8 a.m. Mr. McMinn, White, Davis, and I started for the south point
of the range south of the Barthelemys. We steered east, and at
starting crossed and rounded a number of salt creeks, about which
were numerous tracks of natives. We saw fishing-weirs across the
creeks, with small openings, and near them mattings or nets with
which, we suppose, the natives closed them as they wished. After
getting clear of the creeks and mangroves we came to a hard plain,
with grass and rushes ; the grass wiry, but better than we had seen
on the coast before. Much of the plain had been burnt. Before us
was the range trending from south to north, or north-west, the
Barthelemy Hills to the north of the end of the range, and other
hills beyond in the same direction. We had a beautiful south-east
breeze; the day was mild, and altogether like a May day in South
Australia. We walked on briskly, elated with the idea of soon being
on high hills, and having a view of good country. About 2 miles
from the sea we came to a fresh swamp, and walking through it


soon came to another, and then found the swamps continuous. We
walked 2 miles through water, and then turned northward to some
distant timber, hoping to find there dry land that would lead to the
Barthelemy Hills, whence wo hoped we could travel along the range
and return by a different route. W 7 hen we reached the first clump
of timber we found it a mere island in the midst of the swamp. One
of the party dropped into a hole up to his shoulders in mud and
water, and was rapidly disappearing when he was pulled out. After
this we found the water invariably deeper when we came to timber,
which was principally paperhark. We waded through rushes and
reeds or small bamboos till our party began to separate. We then
went for a considerable distance through tall flags, several feet over
our heads, till the water reached to our waists, and deepened so
rapidly that in a few steps we should have been reduced to the
necessity of swimming, so we reluctantly returned, seeing water in
every direction. Logs were floating about, and leeches abounded.
I have no doubt we were on the edges of a lake, and that the water
wo walked through contracted as the dry season advanced. We had
a view of at least 100 square miles of swamp.
On the 18th, at daylight, out of sight of land, going across Cam
bridge Gulf, with a high sea. Rough all day.
1 9th. ?About two hours before daylight saw land. Passed Capo
Bernier, and sailed along the coast. About Cape Londonderry it is
a fine bold coast ?high cliffs, and sometimes ranges of hills coming to
the water?s edge, with mountainous country in the background. All on
land looked dry, and had that desolate appearance which the Austra-
lian coast generally wears in the summer season. Passed Cape Bou-
gainville, and in the evening, as the navigation looked dangerous
from the number of islands and breakers, we tried to find shelter
under an island about 12 miles from the cape, but got on a reef with
less than three feet of water on it. As we were endeavouring to get
clear of this danger a heavy breaker came rolling on. The boat
answered her helm beautifully, went head on, and rode buoyantly
over the surf. We then headreached north-east, keeping a watch.
After standing out for some miles the water suddenly became smooth,
and we struck on rock. Soon after we saw breakers all around and
land at no great distance. Bump, bump, grind, grind, went our
poor boat on the rocks; we tried hard to get her off, but she con-
tinued to catch on the reef. Our situation was now critical. We
were a dozen miles from the mainland, with no chance of escape in
case of shipwreck, which seemed inevitable, for the soft wood of
which our little vessel was made could not long stand such severe
usage. We believed our voyage of life was about to end with that


of the Forlorn Hope , and it seemed that the motto on our flag would
have a mournful significance. At last we got clear, and sailed hack
towards the island we had left in the evening, and anchored in 2
fathoms.
20th. ?A heavy sea broke our rudder this morning, and we anchored
and repaired it. Sailed in various directions, trying to avoid the
numerous reefs and shoals, till at last we resolved to go eastward till
we got outside them, and then still work round all these dangers?
making a detour of 80 or 90 miles. The wind being against us, we
ran down to the eastern side of Yansittart Bay, and found safe
anchorage off a sandspit, at 5 fathoms, about half a mile from the
land.
21st. ?Got under sail at daylight; but as everything foretold
rough weather we sought shelter, and anchored in 4 fathoms at
Trough ton Island, a quarter of a mile from the shore. We had a
fine view from here. To the west, the cape ?a round hill with a
spit of land running out; to the south, the shores of Yansittart Bay,
Troughton Island, curving round and partly obstructing the view ;
and behind all, in the distance, on the mainland, high ranges, and
an immense quantity of smoke ascending from them.
22nd. ?Started at daylight with a gentle breeze, smooth sea, and
balmy weather, steering north till towards evening, when we ran
west about 15 miles.
23rd. ?After a fine night?s run we struck at 3 a.m. on a reef. Got
the boat off, and anchored till daylight in fathoms water. At
dawn were close to three remarkable rocks. All the forenoon among
shoals and reefs. Tacked in all directions, and at length, to simplify
matters, sailed over a shoal. Rowed a great deal. Plenty of turtles
and fish about. Heavy dews at night. Quantities of porpoises.
General course south-west.
2 4th. ?Passed islands marked on the charts as south of Casini,
Islands. Passing islands all day.
On the 25th and 26th still islands, islands, islands. After leaving
Cape Bougainville we passed at least 500, of every shape, size, and
appearance. Some are several miles in extent; others are mere
detached rocks; some have stunted vegetation; others look quite
bare; some look like detached portions of hilly ranges; some conical;
some round or oval, and flat-topped; some slope to the water?s edge;
some are bold and cliffy; some smooth ; some diversified with sand-
hills ; some are rugged and uneven, with large rocks piled together
in a wild and fantastic manner; some exhibit a sandy beach ; others
are guarded by barriers of reefs. Infinitely varied as these islands
are?wild and picturesque, grand sometimes almost to sublimity?


there is about them all an air of dreariness and gloom. No sign of
life appears on their surface ; scarcely even a sea bird hovers on their
shores. They seem abandoned by nature to complete and everlasting
desolation. The barrenness and silence were more depressing to us
from the circumstances of our position. We had thought to find
shelter among so many isles, safe anchorages, when the storms rose
and the sea raged, hut the islands were more inhospitable than the
wide ocean. There was deep fathomless water up to their shores,
except where we were on treacherous reefs. Whatever wind blow
we were compelled to drift, and were often forced out of our way by
furious currents and eddies. It was a relief from weariness, anxiety,
and danger, when we escaped from this archipelago. We tried to
get into Camden Harbour through Eogers?s Straits, but failed, being
puzzled by islands, and baffled by breakers and eddies.
On the 29th felt at daylight considerably uncomfortable. Our
provisions were out; we had been trying to catch fish, but although
there were shoals they would not bite. There was no appearance of
game on shore, and no sign of a settlement. The appearance and
the bearings of the coast, islands, and channels wore so utterly
different from the description on any chart, that we had the greatest
dfficulty in determining which way to steer for the harbour, and some
of our party became thoroughly sceptical as to its existence. At
last we rowed through a narrow and tortuous passage between
islands; and soon, to our great relief, we saw a boat in the distance.
On coming alongside we found a surveyor (Mr. Cowle) and party.
They had a remarkably dull and despondent look that rather
surprised us, expecting to meet every one looking happy in so
thriving a settlement as we supposed Camden Harbour to be. Wo
soon heard the worst news. The sheep were nearly all dead, and
the whole settlement was a failure. We remained five days at this
unfortunate settlement, and gained ample information respecting its
history, and the character of the land in its vicinity. The harbour
is most beautiful. It stretches to the west for eight miles to where
it is entered by three channels coming through reefs and islands.
It is bounded on the south by the high rugged hills of the mainland;
the loftiest eminence being Mount Lookover; on all sides are bights
and inlets, while high round-topped islands complete the picture.
The rise and fall of tide is feet, and at low water islands and
forests of mangroves are made visible that were out of sight a
few hours before. The country was wild and rugged. Dark and
irregularly-shaped hills that seemed to be composed of masses of
loose rocks. Stones oveiy where ; but upon every spot of soft ground,
and among the rocks, there was a luxuriant growth of rank grass.


Some of it was kangaroo-grass, Tout in quality utterly different from
that of the southern colonies. Far away were hold mountains and
ranges, and leading to them a succession of hill and valley, hut all
of the same stony character. The trees were scarce and stunted, the
most remarkable being the Baobab, or gouty stemmed tree. The air
during our stay was remarkably clear, and in the morning quite
bracing. We visited the settlers, who were encamped about two
miles from the Government camp. They were all ruined, and in-
tending to leave by the first opportunity. They gave dreadful
accounts of the weather at the time of their arrival. There had
been several deaths from sunstroke: in one case a man was picked
up dead in the bush ; in another a settler, after spending a day on
shore, returned to the vessel by which he had arrived, and expired in
a few minutes. It must be remembered that in these cases of coup da
soleil the parties had not landed many days, and probably did not
take the precautions necessary to guard themselves from the effects
of a vertical sun. The effect of the heat upon the sheep probably
exceeded anything of the kind ever before witnessed. Their feet
seemed burned with walking on the stones. All night they were in
agony; their panting almost amounted to roaring. The extraordinary
heat' was probably increased to a great extent by the refraction from
the rocks. At this time there was little grass; but when it did grow,
and even after it had arrived at maturity, it was worthless. The
few sheep that were left fed on it greedily till their stomachs
were enormously distended, but they still fell off in condition. I
saw the flocks at grass, and never, upon the worst run after the
worst drought in South Australia, have I seen such wretched objects.
They did not weigh more than 18 pounds, and the sight of one
killed and dressed I shall not readily forget. The Government
sheep, however, had not lost condition to any great extent, so that
there was probably something in the management; but the fact
that they had not improved was sufficient to condemn the country.
The settlers? horses had to be fed with corn and bran, although
they did no work and the grass was abundant. The Government
horses were low in condition. They had done some exploring, but
certainly in South Australia horses would do three times the work
and look in fair order. A more unfit spot for stock of any descrip-
tion could not be found anywhere. There is probably good country
inland, but too far off, and the route too impracticable for it to
be connected with Camden Harbour. One settler found and took
on lease a small piece of country with good grass and useful timber,
eight miles from the camp, but such spots were very rare. The


whole scheme for settling Camden Harbour was rash and ill-con-
sidered.
Some few weeks before our arrival the settlement had been
visited by Malays. There were about 300 ?in seven proas and 30
canoes. They were a wretched-looking lot, and for firearms had
but a few old rusty flint-muskets and two or three small rusty
cannon. The natives drove them away from the watering-places,
and killed one of their number. These are the formidable pirates
against whose attacks it was supposed the party at Adam Bay
might have to maintain a desperate defence. At Port Essington
the Malays were afraid of the natives, who were remarkably
harmless.
On the 3rd June we took leave of our host, from whom we had
received every assistance in preparing for the continuation of our
voyage, and every attention to our comfort that courtesy and kind
feeling could suggest. We took with us Her Majesty?s mail and a
multitude of messages to people in Perth. On leaving the landing
at the camp we sailed over to the wreck of the Cailliance. Here
several of the Victorian settlers who had purchased the wreck had
their tents erected on the shore, and were busy in preparing to
burn the hull as the only way to get the copper from her. We
purchased a cable, and, soon after sailing, an enormous column of
smoke arose from the wreck. The Cailliance was on fire as if in
honour of our departure. Had that vessel been at Adam Bay a
cutter would certainly have been made from her for the majority
of the party to escape by.
On the sth no land in sight.
On the Bth, about 4 a.m., the ironwork of our rudder broke;
lowered sails, and put out a steer oar; sea high and rough. Sea
moderated after noon, and we mended the rudder and baled out
the boat. Some of the party unwell; two having cramps, another
bilious, another with dysentery, and a fourth very sick, but ate
very well. Wind variable, and high at night.
9th. ?The sea getting worse till after daylight; a dreadful cross
sea that our sailing master, White, said was enough to swamp all
the boats that ever were made. At sunrise the sight was terribly
grand?the long swell, the mountain wave, the deep hollow, the
white foam?as far as we could see, the scene was one of wild dis-
order. When upon the crest of a mighty sea, we saw ourselves to
descend into a deep hollow like the extinct crater of a volcano.
Down wo went, high seas foaming all around us. The bowsprit
just kissed the water, and the Folorn Hope rose like a duck upon


the next wave. The storm did not increase after sunrise and at 10
a.m. showed signs of moderating, and before noon we had all canvas
set. Latitude 17� 14' 35"; wind s.E, by s. Porpoises following
us, and shoals of fish about. Yellow snakes with black spots floating
on the surface; jelly-fish abundant. In the afternoon the wind rose
till it increased to a gale. The sky had a hard, cold appearance.
The waves awfully high, and we shipped some heavy seas; one
in particular sunk the boat low, and we had to bale for our lives.
Wo passed an awful night, expecting every minute to be our last.
Half drowned and bitterly cold; constantly baling ; laying to with
a leg-of-mutton sail.
10 th. ?At daylight the scene was frightful, and we longed for a
ship to deliver us from our peril; but we knew that we were out of
the track of all vessels. Snakes floating on the billows. About
midday the storm showed signs of moderating, and we hoped to
make sail again, but as evening came on the wind rose to a gale, and
we found we had to pass another night of suffering and peril. One
of the party was seized with shivering fits. We had no medicine,
but administered rum and essence of ginger; rubbed his feet and
covered him up in his bed; blankets, clothing, and everything
saturated with water. Night clear, and the cold biting.
llth. ? Sunday. We had passed through a night of tempest, danger,
and pain; the storm worse than ever, the waves not higher, but
we had cross seas, with the billows breaking over the boat and
dashing her round. The invalid suffered very much, and?poor
fellow! ?we were unable to cook, or do anything for him but give
him the rum and ginger. As the morning wore on, the tempest still
raged. There was an awful feature in the storm that morning.
The waves were high and steep, and as two of us sat watching
the horrible scene, wo saw an immense sea approaching almost
perpendicular, and a few feet at the summit quite so, and of a bright
green colour and capped with foam. ?We shall never get over
that,? both exclaimed; but there is no craning at those fences, and
on we went. As we expected, the top of the sea broke over the
boat, nearly upsetting her, and dashed her down the steep descent,
and the mass of water surging under dropped us down on the other
side. ? Bale, quick! ? was the cry, and we prepared for the next
sea. We had three of these walls of water, with their green tops
and crests of foam; and it seemed a miracle how we escaped from
such danger. Each time the boat was dashed down in the same
way, and a quantity of water thrown into her. At noon we were
once more deluded with the hope of the gale lessening, and we
changed our leg-of-mutton sail into a double-reefed foresail. We took


latitude 17� 86' 32". In the evening the sea and wind increased, and
we were obliged to take in canvas. The waves broke against us from
three different directions. We were now so exhausted that, although
in such danger, we could sleep, and even the man at the helm kept
continually dropping off and waking with a start. We were cramped
and tortured with rheumatic pains, caused by being so long wet and
remaining in the same posture. During the night we cut down the
mainmast and let it float away; we could not unfasten it and take
it down without moving about and probably upsetting the boat.
12th. ?Morning broke upon us still battling with the storm.
Awful as the danger was, there was a fierce and almost pleasing
excitement in seeing the gallant way in which the Forlorn Hope
rode over the mountain billows, or recovered herself after being
dashed against by cross seas. During the day the storm abated.
A few Boatswain-birds came round us. We ran all night under
a close-reefed foresail.
13th. ?Our situation still looked more hopeful, we could see over
a greater expanse of wild sea and white surf. The breeze was
strong, but we were getting under the influence of the land, and
with a south-east wind the sea moderated fast as we approached the
shore. We began to think that our worst danger was over, and
to feel proportionately thankful. No men, probably, were ever in
greater peril for so long a time. Fortunately we had moonlight?
the sky, night and day, wearing a hard glaring appearance, with
scarcely ever a sign of cloud.
14th. ?About 10 a.m. saw smoke in the direction of land, and
at 11T5 saw land itself. Latitude at noon, 19� 45' 54". The coast
low and barren-looking. Along the shore white sandhills with
little vegetation. Endeavoured to land in the evening to dry our
clothes, but there were heavy rollers that rendered it dangerous, so
we stood out, and anchored in 4 fathoms.
19 th. ?Sighted Cape Lambert, which we reached about 2 p.m., and
entered Nicol Bay, sailing between the mainland and Bezout Island.
The coast bolder than any wo had been accustomed to for some
days. The hills appeared to have a good deal of ironstone about them.
The rocks at the shore were rough and strange looking?some
washed into arches and concaves, others into the most rugged and
fantastic forms, with multitudes of excrescences like stalactites.
Batches of sandy beach appeared, and in places reefs jutted out
from the shore. At 5 p.m, we were hugging the land on the south
side of the bay. We sailed principally by solid rock of the colour
for some distance of copper-ores. We almost fancied we could see
the green and yellow carbonates. The land at the other side of


the bay plainly visible. Plenty of turtles. Jelly-fish of a peculiar
shape, like mushrooms, with a horsetail attached. They were of
different colours. Snakes following us. At about 4?30 heard a cooey,
and saw natives on the summit of a rise. They motioned to us to
come to them, and we steered towards the beach, but could not land
on account of rocks and the swell. Tried to communicate with the
natives, but we were unintelligible to each other. We were obliged
to turn away, and when we did so they all gave a tremendous groan.
There were about twenty men, women, and children. On our moving
up the bay one ran along the top of a hill to watch our movements.
About sundown we fancied we could see tents, and just after dark
saw a light, when we cast anchor. Fired two barrels of a revolver
and were answered by three distinct signal-lights, when we fired
another barrel in reply, and rested satisfied we had found the
settlers. Latitude at noon, 20� 32' 6". During the night we began
to doubt whether the settlement was not a native one.
20th. ?At daylight all doubt as to whether we had found civilised
beings was removed, for we heard a cooey, and immediately after-
wards saw a native inviting us ashore. As however, the shore
was some distance from us, and we had a fair wind, we pushed on,
thinking the settlers must bo higher up the bay, as we had seen no
sign of a landing-place. We passed islands, rocky points, and long
stretches of low shore fringed with mangroves.
On the 22nd, after going on shore in Nicol Bay, sailed at 2 A.M.,
and rounded point after point of the mainland, and an island run-
ning north of it, till a little before 8 a.m., close to the north point
of the island, we saw a small sandy bight, and determined to land
and get a view from the hills. On nearing the shore we saw a
native, who ran along the beach, and then along the rocks, making
great gesticulations. We spoke to him, and made signs that wo
were going to land, when he ran to meet us, and three or four
other men made their appearance, with four boys. Two of the men
had spears, and shook them at us; but as we approached nearer,
they laid them on the beach. Not knowing how many might be in
the background, we loaded all the firearms, and running the boat
ashore, two of us landed, one having a revolver in his bolt. The
rest of the party stopped for some time in the boat. Eight natives met
us, and were friendly enough. An old man kept in the distance,
and did not come to us during the day. He was probably behind
the times, and the slave of antiquated prejudices against foreigners.
With this anticosmopolitan was a remarkably fine dingo, large,
broadchested, and in good condition. We found the natives knew
nothing of the settlement, but they had seen white people. They


used of their own accord about eight or ten English words, including
water, baccy, sugar, by-and-by, and thank you. They begged for
food, but that was too scarce with us at that time. We gave them
knives and tobacco. They offered us fish ready cooked, but wo were
afraid they would expect us to pay for the meal with interest, or it
would have been welcome. They appeared to have some notions of
the habits of business men, for it was not till evening that they
offered to introduce us to their families?an invitation the necessity
of proceeding on our journey prevented us from accepting. They
showed us water in the rocks nearly at the summit of the hills,
about three-quarters of a mile from the boat. We took in a full
supply in six journeys. The natives showed us some of their draw-
ings on the rocks. There were sketches of fishes, turtles, lizards,
and different kinds of birds, including emus. One native made a
sketch of a turtle on the sand. If the performance would not have
satisfied a critical eye, it had at any rate the merit of being dashed
off with a free hand. One of our party then drew the outline of a
horse, which sorely puzzled them. One of the men stood more than
six feet, and most of them were above the medium height. All
were badly shaped and skinny. In the evening we prepared to
start, and not having been able to find any signs of a settlement,
were determined to make for Champion Bay. We had about 60 lbs.
of flour, 22 lbs. rice of the worst quality, and two or three pounds of
oatmeal and maizena. We determined, after finishing the two
latter articles, to put ourselves on three pints of flour and rice per
diem for the whole of us. Having taking in wood and water, we
went on board, and lay at anchor for the night.
2'drd. ?At daylight weighed anchor, and rounding a point steered
w.s.w. for what appeared an opening ahead of us. After four
or five miles got into shallow water ?1J to 2 fathoms. Passed
several low, square, rocky islets, and a grassy island. Tried an
opening to the north abreast of us. On reaching it found it very
narrow?not above 20 yards wide. The current was very strong
?at least eight miles an hour. Sometimes there were three fathoms
of water, and then rocks three feet from the surface. Wo lowered
sail on approaching, but the current was so powerful the only course
was to go through the channel. We backed water with the oars,
and shoved the boat olf the rocks as she rushed through like a race-
horse. We then found that instead of being in the open sea wo
were surrounded on all sides by islands and reefs, except to the east,
the direction from which we came. We turned in that direction,
and the #ind being against us pulled till nearly midday, when we
wore past the last night?s anchorage, and had a full view of our old


landing-place. Cooked oatmeal and flour. We lit the fire in a
camp-oven, and boiled in a bucket. We boiled everything, to make
it go further. yVbout 1/30 took to the oars again, and continued
pulling till after 4 p.m., when the wind enabled us to sail. At
sunset there was a strong current against us, and we anchored
between Legendre and Delambre Islands, in 11 fathoms water. Both
islands are rocky but grassy on their surface. The passage between
Legendre and llaay Islands appeared impracticable on account of
breakers. A north-west breeze during the night made us anxious ;
we could not help thinking of the much dreaded North-west Cape,
and feared the most dangerous wind had set in.
24f/i. At daylight found to our joy that the wind had shifted to
the s.e., and that we had probably taken leave of Nicol Bay with
its dreary and desolate-looking scenery.
25t/i. ?Glorious sunrise over clouds reflecting from their edges the
most varied and brilliant hues. Light fleecy clouds in all parts of
the sky, interspersed with others of a darker colour. Turtle about.
Latitude at noon, 20� 27. Eocky Point, Enderby Island, bearing
s. by e. ; wind, e.n.e. At sunset cloud-banks and dark scud all round,
inds light and variable all night.
2 6 tA.?Variable winds all the forenoon and ceasing altogether
after midday till evening.
On the 29th, just after midnight, a fine breeze came from the
s.e., and we had a splendid run all night. During the forenoon it
shifted till it stopped at n.e. Course, s.w. At 11 a.m. passed a
sandy island, s.e. by s. Immediately afterwards saw bottom, and
sounded from H- to 4 fathoms, and then passed into deep water.
Abundance of turtle. Breakers to the s.e. A reef extends fully
three miles n.e, from the island, which is seven or eight miles,
according to the chart, from the Eossilly Island of the French.
Latitude at noon, 21� 19' 28", Breeze freshened till our jurymast,
made of an oar, cracked, and had to be stayed. At 1 p.m. Thouvenard
Island on our port bow. During the afternoon passed a line of low
sandy islands, keeping them to the east. About 10 p.m. saw a sandy
island, unnamed. Shortened sail, so as to round the Cape in the
morning. Pleasant night. Wind at midnight from s.e.
30th. ?Cold towards morning. At daylight sighted Muiron Island,
and passed between the island and Cape. Heavy breakers on the
shore. Pine night. Passed Point Cloates at 11-30 p.m. Nearly
drifted on a reef. All night heard the roar of the breakers.
July I,?At daylight could see the spray rising up like mist-clouds.
Latitude at noon, 23� 8' 18". We had been running within from
live to eight miles from the shore, and the coast from the North-west
vol. x. E


Cape to this point was as wretched-looking as any part of the conti-
nent, barren, desolate, treeless, and of a dingy brown colour. I knew
it was the season when in those latitudes Australian landscape would
have a withered appearance, hut here were large patches without
any vegetation whatever. About that line of coast, there is no ele-
ment of the sublime to redeem its horrible bancnness. A long
range, of 600 feet elevation; no ruggedness, no beetling crag, no
steep mountain or dark ravine, no chasm or overhanging precipice.
The hills are smoothsided, with a dull uniformity of height, and
appear to be elevated only to render more conspicuous their sterility
and monotonous hideousness. Twenty-five miles from the cape the
hills looked a little more irregular, but there was the same absence
of forest, the same appearance of desolation.
2 nd. ?At daylight, could indistinctly see the coast through the
haze and mist?-to the north were perpendicular cliffs ;to the south
lower land, trending away in a kind of bight, and then coming out
in the form of bold cliffs of reddish-white colour. Passed Cape
Cuvier. The view was indistinct up to this point, but the land
appeared desolate ?partly cliffs, partly steep slopes, with sandhills
here and there. Latitude at noon, 24� 22 . The wind was n.w. in
the afternoon, and we steered for Sharks Bay, and ran under the
shelter of the Bernier and Dorre Islands, the former of which we
sighted between 3 and 4 p.m. Cold afternoon, and calm night.
3rd. ?At daylight had passed Bernier Island, and had Dorre
Island on our right?distant about 10 miles. Shores steep and cliffy,
some of the cliffs being extremely white.
6th.? ln the morning the sea was rather rough, with a long swell
on. Dirk ITartog?s Island had a mist over it all the forenoon. It
is high land, appearing like ranges of hills, dark and gloomy.
Occasionally we could see the steep cliffs overhanging the sea.
About midday we were off the false entrance between the island and
the mainland. Latitude at noon, 26� 9' 45?. The coast on the main-
land is low, sandhills near the points, then low yellowish cliffs, their
summits showing dry grass, but perfectly bai eof timbei. Snakes
followed us, and albatrosses sailed round the boat. During the
night weather alternately cloudy and fine; light winds most of the
night.
Ith ?Towards daylight the breeze freshened. About an hour
before dawn took in-the mainsail. Wind N.E., getting stronger
during the forenoon, and the sea very rough. We had got out 20
miles from land, and the sea being on our broadside we received a
good wetting. About 10 a.m. the weather moderated, and soon
after the sun came out, and the sky lost its wintry appearance ; even


the wind was warm. Latitude at noon, 27� 18'. In the afternoon
wind n.w., and weather threatening. All longing to reach Cham-
pion Bay before a burster came on, we pulled in towards the
coast, and ran within seven or eight miles of it. Land high, but the
atmosphere was so hazy we could see little of it. Sometimes we saw
cliffs, and timber in places. "We saw smoke on shore, the first since
leaving Exmouth Gulf, Plenty of albatrosses and a few cape
pigeons. In the latter part of the afternoon the land became more
distinct, and we could see the green foliage of trees. Passed Gan-
theaume Bay about 7 - 30. Although before moonrise could make it
out distinctly. We had a splendid run during the night, hugging
the shore, with a smart breeze and a high sea in our favour. After
passing Gantheaume Bay the limestone hills were very conspicuous,
and had a strange effect by the light of the clouded moon. They
were lofty and white, with dark summits. Noticed Shoal Point.
Passed, without observing them, Port Gregory and the mouth of
the Hutt Eiver. During the night the wind shifted once or twice,
and on one occasion the jurymast cracked, and nearly went over the
side. Just afterwards an oar that was being used for a boom broke
in half, striking the watch on the head, knocking him into the
bottom of the boat, and occasioning a flow of the circulating fluid
?from the nasal organ.
Bth. ?Morning broke unpromisingly, with a mist so dense that we
could not see the land at the distance of a quarter of a mile. Wo
feared that in the fog we should pass Champion Bay without seeing
it, but at last we recognized, in what looked like a cloud-bank, the
high land; and, after a heavy shower of rain had to a great extent
cleared away the mist, we were refreshed by a delightful view of
lofty and picturesque ranges. We were prepared, from all we had
heard of Western Australia, to find a barren coast; but we saw that
whether this part of the coast were fertile or otherwise, it presented
a bold and varied scenery. There were hill and valley, peak and
bluff, long ranges, flat-topped hills, trees scattered over .the upper
portions of the elevations, and heather upon the mountain side. The
effect of this view upon us, after the dreariness and desolation of the
coast we had left behind, was enchanting. Then the mist came over
us again, obscuring all the view, and leaving only the dull outline
of the coast. Once more it partially cleared, and we saw in the
distance Mount Fairfax and the Pinnacle, with other hills of strange
shapes. Hugging the shore we passed over a shoal marked on the
chart, with five fathoms of water on it, and a rough sea. Shortly
after this we perceived a green spot in the scrub, then discovered a
hut, and found that the verdant patch was a cultivation paddock.


How welcome was this first sign of civilization after 1600 miles of
wild ocean and desert shore. The coast after this took a sweep, and
we struck for a distant point of land with a reef stretching out from
it. In vain endeavouring to reconcile our course with the chart,
we suddenly saw houses, then flagstaff's, shipping and a jetty. At
last our toils, privations, and perils were over. We turned our
boat for the jetty, and disregarding the buoys to our left, sailed
over the end of the reef, on the south-west side of the bay, with
soundings at from 3f to 6 fathoms, till we got regular bottom
at 6 fathoms, which lasted till we nearly reached the shore, when
it shoaled suddenly. Our arrival created great excitement. It was
at first thought that ours was a whaleboat from Port Gregory; but
the course we steered, and the fact of our taking soundings, proved
us to be strangers. Nearly all the population were on the beach to
meet us, of course thinking we were part of a wrecked crew, and
fifty willing hands helped to drag our boat on shore. Our story was
soon told, and we were loaded with expressions of kindly welcome
and offers of assistance; and, although undoubtedly we presented a
suspicious appearance, the authorities did not trouble us with inquiries
till we had been warmed by the fire and comforted with the good
cheer of mine host Baston, whose excellent hotel we can recommend
to travellers as one where they will meet with excellent accomoda-
tion and the most studied attention to their comfort. After satis-
fying the claims of hunger we proceeded, according to our several
tastes, to give ourselves the appearance of civilized beings. Before
the metamorphosis was completed in my case, I was waited upon by
a functionary, who inquired if I was the ringleader of the party. I
looked steadily at him, as if for an explanation, when he modified
the expression by lopping off the first syllable, and dwelt upon the
extreme importance of caution and vigilance in a convict colony. I
satisfied him, however, by showing my clearance from Camden
Harbour, and still further reassured his mind by allowing him to
see Her Majesty?s mail for Fremantle. The day continued rainy
and cold, and rendered doubly grateful the warmth and shelter we
had found after our weary voyage. In the evening several of us
visited the Mechanics? Institute, and buried ourselves for hours among
the colonial, but, of course, more particularly the Adelaide, journals.
Those who in our own beautiful city have been accustomed to their
morning and evening paper, will hardly appreciate the zest with
which we devoured several months? news, with all their topics of
interest, including the rise and fall of Ministries, the accidents by
flood and field, the catastrophe that had befallen Banter?s party, the
deaths of great men in the old country, and the momentous news


from America. We returned very late to our inn, and felt thankful
that the voyage of the Forlorn Hope had ceased. Our crew was dis-
banded. A better lot never pulled together. Under Providence we
were all much indebted for our lives to the skill and judgment of
John White, and to his coolness in times of the greatest possible
danger; and we felt thankful we had the assistance of another
British tar, James Davis. To my friends, Messrs. Hamilton and
McMinn, who took observations and laid down our course, we owed
the exactness with which we ascertained our position and pursued
our way. To their assistance 1 owe much in preparing this journal,
and to their labours is to be attributed the accuracy that must con-
stitute its chief value. Those who were neither seamen nor navi-
gators did their duty as Englishmen, and the recollections of the
perils we have faced, and the hardships we have endured together,
will form a tie that time can only strengthen.
The President, in inviting discussion upon the papers, made a few remarks
on the wonderful and rapid progress which the new colony of Queensland
had made under the skilful and energetic administration of Sir George Bowen.
Further details of this progress, and especially of the extension of the frontiers
of civilization towards the north, by the valleys of the Lynd and Flinders,
were given in the communication of Sir George Bowen which accompanied
Mr. Dalrymple?s graphic and striking narrative, and this would be printed
in the next volume of the Journal of the Society. The value of the map
illustrating the journey of the Messrs. Jardine was also dwelt upon by the
President. The greater part of the route was entirely new, and it had been
depicted on a large scale and with the greatest minuteness. With regard to
the bold adventure of Mr. Stow and his companions, it seemed to be almost
equal, as a boat voyage, to that of Lieutenant Bligh when sent adrift by the
mutineers of the Bounty; but the adventure was a voluntary one, and all
praise was due to Mr. Stow for endeavouring to add to our knowledge of the
coast-country in the course of the journey.
Sir Charles Nicholson said, with regard to the first paper, which gave
a detailed account of the journey of Messrs. Frank and Alexander Jardine, he
might observe that these very enterprising and intelligent men were natives of
the colony, sons of a very gallant and able man, who had been appointed
police magistrate at Cape York. They were sent with horses and other
necessaries for the supply of the new settlement, and certainly they acquitted
themselves in a very successful manner. He had noticed that there appeared
to be on the part of Anglo-Australians a sort of intuitive gift, by which they
were enabled to carry out undertakings like these. He believed that the
failure of many most enterprising individuals had arisen from the fact that
they were not of this peculiar class. With regard to the second paper, giving
the account of Mr. Dalrymple having succeeded in discovering and opening
the new route from Buckingham Bay to the interior of the Valley of Lagoons
it would be recollected that it had always been a matter of great difficulty to
get over the extensive ranges of Eastern Australia running from north to south,
and Mr. Dalrymple had rendered a great service to the colony of Queensland
in surmounting the difficulty at a point where it was of so much importance.
But he had perhaps rather over-rated the advantage to English colonists of the
lowlands along the coast of Tropical Eastern Australia. The numerous lagoons
and long stretches of mangrove swamp, which occupied so great a part of the


area, detracted greatly from the value of these districts. He might remark
that the progress of settlement was going on with great rapidity in the north ot
Queensland, and stations had been taken up almost as far as the Gulf of Carpen-
taria. He had been much struck with the account given of the utter desola-
tion and lifeless character of the islands on the north-west, given by Mr. Stow,
which contrasted so strongly with the beautiful islands ot the north-eastern
coast. Some years ago, when sailing along the coast, he thought he never saw
anything so perfectly beautiful and so picturesque as the whole of the coast
from Moreton Bay northwards. Referring to the general fact, that the only
available portions of Tropical Australia were probably the eastern portions,
and that the meridian of 135� pretty nearly marked a line between the fertile
parts of the East destined to a prosperous future, and the probably useless and
sterile country of the West, he thought it a pity that those enterprising and
gallant men, who had explored from Adam Bay westward, did not direct their
efforts to some locality further eastward, more likely to be productive of solid
advantage. A short journey of 600 miles would have brought them to Cape
York, and saved a good deal of their tedious voyage. There was one point
which he would only just advert to, namely, the utter absurdity of the views
which led to the establishment of a colony in North Australia, subject to
and under the jurisdiction of South Australia. They had been the means
of exciting angry feelings amongst the people, and producing disruption
and disunion. He would mention that a very interesting communication
had arrived by the last mail. It was to the effect that steam communica-
tion had been established between Brisbane and Singapore, and no doubt the
first steamer of this important new line was now on her way, so that there
would in future be monthly communication by Torres Straits with Australia,
and the whole continent would be encircled. He might also mention, as a
fact showing the increase of rapidity of communication, that this day (27th
November) we were in the receipt of news by telegraph from Australia up to
the 24th October, a little more than a month.
The President, in closing the proceedings, said it was necessary to call
attention to a fact which people were apt to forget, that it was the discovery
of the mouth of the Adelaide River, in Adam Bay, by Macdouall Stuart, on
his journey across the continent, which led the South Australians, however
imprudently, to send a colonising expedition all round the east coast to that
remote northern point. He agreed with Sir Charles Nicholson that Mr. Stow
and his party would have made a more easy voyage by steering their boat
eastward in the direction of Cape York; but they had already taken tliat
route in their voyage from Adelaide to Adam Bay, and they went, like true
geographers, to explore new lands; and he therefore stood up for these spirited
men, because he considered that a 1600-mile boat voyage round that country
was a feat of which geographers ought to be proud.

Previous to the reading of the Papers, the President said it would ill
become him not to call attention to the great loss which science had sustained
in the death of that distinguished geographer Dr. Henry Barth. The mission
on which he was sent was originated and supported by this country; his
explorations were, therefore, really and truly English, and he carried out his
enterprise with the greatest fidelity, travelling over a large portion of
Northern and Central Africa. Dr. Barth brought to his geographical investi-
gations an energy and ability which ought to make his name long remembered
amongst geographers. Little notice, he regretted to say, had as yet been
taken by the English press of the decease of this distinguished man, whose
works had been published in this country and who had been honoured by our
own Sovereign with a Companionship of the Bath. He (the President) would
not now enter more at large upon his merits, reserving that for the Anniver-
sary Address, In his extensive travels Dr. Barth had to go from one zone of
country peopled by Mahometans to another inhabited by Pagans, and showed
his great qualities as a traveller by the way in which he overcame all the diffi-
culties which obstructed each portion of his passage. His merits had been
duly appreciated in Germany, particularly by our associate Dr. Petermann,
and he (the President) was hopeful that the people of England would give in
this case that credit to him which they were always ready to give to every
eminent foreigner who did such good service.
The President also announced to the Society that he had to modify (owing
to more correct intelligence having been received) what he had said with
regard to the expeditions on the east and west sides of Africa, to which he had
alluded with a melancholy feeling at the last meeting. One of these expedi-
tions had been to a great extent successful, and the other had met with no real
reverse. The results of the expedition of M. du Chaillu would be com-
municated to the Society after Christmas. When he told them that M, dit
Chaillu had penetrated considerably beyond his former survey, that he bad
made astronomical observations of great value which were now the subjects of
calculation at Greenwich, that he had entered into rocky regions never before
explored by a European, and that he had preserved all his notes and his
valuable observations, ?such results would be regarded as full compensation
for what they were led in the first instance to believe had been a great mis-
fortune.
In regard to the East Coast, he was happy to announce that the energetic


explorer Baron von der Decken had not lost both his steamers, as had been
rumoured. It appeared that his small steamer was lost on the bar of the
Jub, but that the other had been preserved and repaired. The party had
advanced up that river to a considerable distance, and, when last heard of, were
preparing to proceed on their land journey into the interior. They were in
high spirits and in good health, and there was reason to hope that with so
very enterprising a leader and so many appliances the expedition would be
ultimately successful.
The following Papers were read :??
1. A Boat-voyage along the Coast-lakes of East Madagascar.
By Captain W. Rooke, r.a.
Captain Rooke related that having heard, whilst at Mauritius in
1804, that the chain of lakes south of Tamatave, in Madagascar,
might be traversed for several hundred miles in a boat sufficiently
light to be carried over the short portages, he determined to attempt
their exploration. He had a boat constructed especially for the
journey, and, with three companions and a native crew, started for
the northern commencement of the lakes in the month of April.
The whole journey from north to south occupied the party thirty-two
days, during which they travelled nearly 400 miles, partly over
lakes of larger or smaller dimensions, but chiefly along winding
channels and streams which connected the lakes together. The
chain of lakes and channels occupies a belt of low land along the
coast, and is sometimes separated from the sea only by banks of
sand. The large rivers which descend from the highlands of the
interior are connected with the network on reaching the low belt of
coast-land. During the journey the travellers passed numerous
villages and several larger towns, each of about 1000 inhabitants;
their voyage terminating at Manzanari. They were well received
by the Hova governors; they saw very little cultivated land, and
the inhabitants seemed an indolent and improvident, but good-
humoured race. The banks of most of the winding channels and
lakes were clothed with magnificent tropical vegetation, which in
the narrow watercourses arched overhead and added much to the
beauty of the scenery. At Manzanari they saw several individuals
of the Akongo tribe, whose territory lies towards the south, and
who have succeeded in maintaining their independence against the
Ilovas. Their capital is several days? journey south-west of Manza-
nari, and is situated on a high hill, the sides of which have been
escarped for the purposes of defence.
This paper will be printed in the ? Journal,? vol, xxxvi.


2. On Ankova, the Central Province of Madagascar , and on the Royal or
Sacred Cities. By the Eev. W. Ellis, f.r.g.s.
The author informed the Meeting that he had undertaken his recent
(fourth) journey to Madagascar at the invitation of King Eadama,
towards the end of 1861, and that during his excursions in the
interior in search of limestone for building, and for other objects,
he had travelled over several parts of the province of Ankova. It
is the most important of the twenty-two provinces into which the
island is divided, from being the country of the Hovas or dominant
race, and is 150 miles in length, by nearly 100 in breadth. The
country is hilly or mountainous, but the elevations rise singly or in
masses, rather than form continuous chains. Mount Ankaratra,
in the south-west of Ankova, is one of the highest mountains in the
island, supposed to be about 13,000 feet above the level of the sea.
It had not yet been ascended by a European, and probably not by
the natives, although they stated that in the cold season snow lay
in the hollows near the summit. Between the isolated hills or
mountain masses lay fertile valleys or level plains, some of them
several miles in extent, frequently well irrigated and cultivated
with rice. The province is well watered, and the rivers, though
not large, seldom fail through the long droughts of summer. The
author, after enumerating the streams, rivers, and lakes of Ankova,
proceeded to describe the forests, which, with occasional intervals
of clear land, bordered the province on three sides, and supplied it
with valuable timber, but left the central district itself almost
destitute of trees. Euphorbias and several kinds of Ficus wore
indigenous, and fruit-trees had been introduced, and grew luxuri-
antly. Horned cattle are numerous; and it is a singular fact that,
whilst the domestic ox is the humped Indian species, the vast herds
of wild cattle are all of the straight-backed kind. The sacred cities
or villages of Ankova are twelve in number; they derive their
sanctity from having been the birth-places, abodes, or burial-places
of their monarchs. Europeans are forbidden to enter most of
them; and although some of them are places of large size, they
have not yet been laid down on our maps. Their names and relative
situations are as follow: ?1. Alasora, about 6 miles south-east of the
capital. This is said to have been the first residence of the Hovas
in Imerina. 2, Imerinmanjaka, 2 miles n. by e, of the capital. 3.
Ambohitrahiby, place of first eating of beef, 12 miles north-west of
the capital. 4. Antananarivo, the capital. 5. Ambohimanga, 10
miles n. by e. of the capital. This is the most sacred city in the
province, it was the capital of the northern part of Imerina before


its chief conquered Antananarivo, and contains the house of one
of the national idols Ifantaka (pronounced Ifantak). The sove-
reign visits it usually once a year to preside at, and take part in,
the offerings and other rites in honour of their idol. It contains
the tombs of several sovereigns, especially the mother of the late
King, who was also the aunt of the present Queen. It is defended
hy fortifications, the s.e. angle of the mountains forming a steep
escarpment. 6. Amhohitany, 2i miles distant from Ambohimanga,
situated on an elevated ridge. In this place is the house of Eama-
havaly, a more renowned idol than Ifantaka, whose will to punish
any one is supposed to be accomplished by the agency of serpents.
7. Ambohidratrimo, 12 miles north-west of the capital, the birth-
place of the mother of Eadama I. 8. Ilafy, 5 miles n.n.e. of the
capital, is the birth-place of the mother of the late Queen Eanavalo,
and belongs to Eadama 11., her son. 9. Inamehana, or 6 miles
n. by w. of the capital, belonging to the present Queen. 10. Amba-
tofimanjana, the exact position unknown to the author. 11.
Ambohimanambola (? the village having silver or money ?), 6 or 7
miles to the e. of the capital, containing the house of the chief
national idol of the Ilovas, Ikelimalaza. 12. Arabohimalaza, E. 5.8.,
10 miles distant. The belief in the influence of the spirits of the
ancestors of their monarchs is one of the chief features of the Mala-
gasy religion; it enters into all their most important ceremonies,
and influences the actions and policy of royalty.
This paper will be printed in the ? Journal,? vol. xxxvi.
The President said he was quite sure the Society would return most
hearty thanks to the authors of these paprs, ?the gallant young artillery
officer Capt, Hooke and the celebrated missionary Ellis. With regard to Mr.
Ellis, he had, in his modesty, not touched upon the great service which the
body to which he belonged had rendered to Madagascar in introducing a
written language amongst its people. He had not only communicated to the
Society geographical information, but much ethnological knowledge. No
doubt, on the present occasion, gentlemen would rather have heard a paper
much more connected with pure geography; but ethnology was so closely
interwoven with descriptions of distant countries that when there was any
communication made relating to the habits and manners of people by those
who had been careful to form a right judgment he was quite sure that such
knowledge would always be gladly received.
Mr. J. Crawfxjrd said he was very much obliged to his friend Mr. Ellis
for the paper which he had read. Madagascar was a very large island, ?the
third, in point of size, in the whole world, being next to Borneo and New
Guinea. It was about three times the size of our own island, and a great deal
larger than the whole kingdom of France. It was big enough, if it were only
good enough. The inhabitants were negroes, and though upon the whole they
were more advanced in civilization than the negroes of the opposite continent,
especially the eastern side of it, which was about the most inhospitable and
barren country in the known globe, still they were sheer absolute barbarians,
even in the favourable representation of Mr. Ellis. Now, something had been
