THE STARKEY WHEEL.
Read what the Press ol this Colony said about our Exhibits at Royal Agricultural Show held April 11 to 21,1900
NO exhibit on the Show Ground created more surprise and plersure than the modest
though substantial, display by Messrs. Starkey Brothers, Bicycle Manufacturers,
155 Elizabeth Street, Sydney, near Market Street. A surprise to the crowds who in-
spected the exhibit, from the fact that the machines of elegant design, beautiful finish,
and faithful build, were manufactured in the colony. A pleasure to all lovers of the
wheel to realise that now bicycles can be built to their special order. The Starkey
Wheel is, without doubt, the finest machine in Australia, and as such was awarded the
First and Special Prizes. In the perfected machine there is a remarkably short wheel
base, which makes the running easier, and gives a stronger and more speedy Bicycle.
The enamelling is of the very highest order —in fact, unsurpassable-and all parts are
beautifully plated A patent eccentric adjustment on each side of the back stays and fork
ends enables the chain to be tightened or loosened in a moment without interfering with
the alignment of the wheel to any degree, and the patent head adjustment takes the place
of the hitherto unsightly collar and bolt, ensuring perfect safety and security to the
handle. The Starkey Wheel utterly routs inferior machines, all the parts con be in-
spected before they are built, and replacements are always at command. Repairing,
enamelling, and plating are specialities by this enterprising firm, and sufficient guarantee
of the faithfulness of allwork is in the fact that Mr A. E. Starkey, who has had the great
advantage of 25 years’ practical experience as foreman in the workshops of the best Cycle
firms known, and who is, without doubt, the man of expert Bicycle knowledge in the
Colonies, personally supervises the building of all Bicycles fact is, perhaps, worth
the attention of our readers, and that is, that the imported machine of from £25 to„£3o
value isreplaced in the market by a very much higher class machine, better finished and
stronger, BUILT TO ORDER AT A COST OF £lB 10s.

READ WHAT
Vitadatio
IS DOING.
Consumption, Pieonsg k BDscesses.
381 Swan Street, Richmond, Victoria,
October 21, 1900.
Mr. S. A. PALMER,
Sole Distributor of Webber’s Vitadatio, Sydney.
Dear Sir, —As I consider Webber’s Great Herbal Remedy has been the means of saving my life, I think
the least I can do is to hand you my Testimonial. I do this absolutely of my own free will, with the hope
that it will encourage others who suffer in a like manner, as I did myself, to persevere with Vitadatio, and
through persevering may be cured of their infirmities. 1 had been suffering for five years. In the first place I
was a youth, not quite nineteen years of age. I worked in a cellar in Melbourne, and through the rapid
changes of temperatures, I caught cold after cold, which at last brought pn pleurisy. I was under one of the
best doctors in Richmond for about three months, but I made no progress towards recovery. He advised me to
go for a trip to build me up; so in Oct. I left Melbourne for New Zealand. I was under a doctor at Wyndham,
IN.Z., who failed to do me any good. He-wished to hold a consultation, so I got another from Invercargill,
N.Z. They came to the conclusion that I was suffering from Consumption, and that I could not live more than
a month or two ; they also advised me to go further north ;so on their advice I went to Wellington. I was
treated as an out-door patient at an hospital there from March, 1896, till March, 1898, but they failed to do me
any good. I tried private doctors, but with the same disheartening result; they said it was consumption and
took it for granted it could not be cured. After that I saw Mr. Palmer in Wellington, and he advised me to
Vitadatio; and seeing the good that it had done him I started to take it, but after taking it for some time I got
disheartened, and thought it would not cure me. I expected a few bottles to cure me, but it did not, so I gave
it up. So after that I went under another doctor, but he said he could do nothing for me ; but as I am a
member of the Forester’s Lodge I had to get a certificate report every fortnight. In such report he wrote I
was suffering from Phthisis. He told my sister there was no possible hope for me, so I decided to come back
to Melbourne; if I were to die, I would die at home. I left Wellington in February, 1899, for Sydney. When
in Sydney, I could not go about for my feet were both swollen, so I had to stop there for some time. I arrived
in Melbourne in March, 1899, and the winter following I was confined to my bed. I could not turn myself in
my bed without aid. I was very weak and the doctor said I would not live a fortnight. After that I again
saw Mr. Palmer, who still persisted that Vitadatio would do me good if I would stick to it. He also told me
I would die if I would not take it, so to please my family I again took it. Afrer taking it for
some time I began to swell very much in the stomach. I got the doctor to call ; he wanted to tap me, but
my mother would not allow him. I verily believe that to have been the Vitadatio working on the complaint.
After that I made rapid progress. I used to feel the abscesses forming, and when they were to their height
I could hardly breathe till they broke. I would start vomiting up blood mixed with phlegm: after
that I would feel easy till some more was forming, which would come away in a like manner. But I have to
thank God and Viradatio 1 have got beyond that stage now. I never have those sicknesses now, and am
able to go anywhere and everywhere, and eat well and sleep well. I have now not a pain nor an ache any-
where. lam a member of the Foresters’ Lodge here, and the doctor gave me a certificate last month to say
that I may follow any light employment, believing it will not injure my health by so doing. When I arriv-
ed in Melbourne one year and seven months ago, 1 barely weighed Bst, now I am gst lolbs, thanks to
Vitadatio and your persistence. You are at perfect liberty to make what use you like of this testimonial. I
will be pleased to answer any questions your patients may wish concerning my case.
I remain, dear sir, yours truly.

Extract From Evening News Dec. 24, 1900
The establishment of Gover and Company, 13 Queen Victoria Markets, and 40
and 42 Oxford Street, Paddington, is at all times popular with the ladies, but is par-
ticularly so just now, when perhaps more than at any other season of the year
everyone desires to have of the best and to look at their best. The reputation of the
firm's corsets, which improve even the best figures, is well established. Nor should
it lessen the public estimation of them to mention that the articles are made on the
firms own premises. Among other articles for which Gover and Company have
acquired popularity are their attractive ladies’ white robe, trimmed with rich Val-
enciennes and Torchon.
