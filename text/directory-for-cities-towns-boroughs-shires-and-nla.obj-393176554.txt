EVANS BEOTHEES,
(S mural $ Ornamental printers,
Eefer to the preceding pages as a Specimen of their Bookwork.
The Excellence of their Ornamental aml_G eneral Printing has already
secured a Victorian Name, and elicited from the press the most favor-
able comments. The compactness of their Establishment gives them
advantages possessed by no other in Victoria; the number of
branches of business conducted on their premises being in excess of
that of any other House ; and no opportunity is lost to keep pace
with the rapid improvements constantly being effected in the Art of
Printing.
They offer these advantages to the Public, as affording equal
facilities for the production of an Address Card or a Book, confident
that their Charges will be found less than those generally made for
high-class Printing.
ALL THE FORMS AND BOOKS RELATING TO SHIRES
AND BOROUGHS
Required under the various Acts kept in Stock, at Prices quite below
the reach of other Printers, this difficult Branch being a speciality
with Evans Brothers.
A varied and well-chosen Stock of Useful and Ornamental
Stationery. Addresses Illuminated in the best taste, and Mounted
in Morocco Cases or Erames ; prices vary from £4 upwards, a First-
class Design being supplied for £6 6s. Borders kept in Stock, and
these can be supplied filled in at 2 days’ notice. Paper and

ECLIPSES IN THE YEAR 1875.
In the year 1875 there will be two Eclipses, both of the Sun, neither of which will
be visible in the southern part of Australia.
First. — A Total Eclipse of the Sun on April 6th. This Eclipse will be visible
in South Africa, India, China, the East India Islands, and North Australia. The
line of totality extends from a point near the Cape of Good Hope, through the Indian
Ocean, Siam, and Cochin China. At Port Darwin and Cape York, a very small
portion of the sun’s disc will be obscured.
Second. —An Annular Eclipse of the Sun on September 29th, invisible in Australia.
This Eclipse will be visible in Africa, Western Europe, the Eastern portion of North
America, and the Atlantic Ocean. The central line extends from a point near Boston,
Massachusetts, across the North Atlantic to Senegambia, Upper and Lower Guinea,
and Madagascar.

From observations made at the Melbourne Observatory, extending over a number
of years, it appears that, on the average, the hottest period is from the 21st to the
25th of January, and the coldest from the 20th to the 24th of July. These periods
will, therefore, be the natural midsummer and midwinter.

Explanation of the Calendar.
Sun’s Rising and Setting.—These numbers show the mean time when the sun’s
centre, elevated by refraction, appears above the horizon, the eye being on a level
with that plane.
Moon’s Rising and Setting.—The same as for the sun, only that the moon is
more depressed by parallax than elevated by refraction. When the mark occurs,
it shows that the moon will only rise or set that day. Thus, on the 16th of January
the moon will only rise at Melbourne. This arises from the lunar day being longer
than the solar. The moon, it will be seen, sets on the 15th, at nineteen minutes
before midnight; the next night she will not set till thirteen minutes past midnight—
that is, thirteen minutes after the commencement of the 17th.
Phases of the Moon. —The times are here given to the nearest minute when the
moon is respectively o°, 90°, 180°, and 270° of longitude from the sun. Apogee is the
time of her greatest distance from the earth, and Perigee is the time of her nearest
approach.
Sun’s Declination. —These quantities show the angular distance of the sun’s
centre from the equator, measured on a meridian. They are given for apparent noon,
or the instant of the sun’s transit over the meridian of Melbourne, and are very useful
for determining the latitude by meridian altitudes, for which purpose they will serve,
without reduction, sufficiently near for most nautical purposes, the whole of the
Australian coast. Thus, suppose on the xst of January the altitude of the sun’s
lower limb at meridian transit had been observed to be 73° 22', the height of the eye
being eighteen feet above the level of the sea, and the instrument having an index
correction of +4' o", the computation will stand thus: —
The proper way of applying the declination may be easily inferred from the circum-
stance that the sun is vertical when on the meridian of that place whose latitude is the
same as the declination. As the sun was observed to be 16 0 22' 5" to the north of the
zenith, the place of observation must be situated so much to the south of where the
sun was vertical; if the sun had been observed to the south of the zenith, the latitude
would have been 6° 41' 18" S. If the above observation be made on the meridian of
Melbourne (145° E. of Greenwich),the latitude thus obtained would be quite correct; for
any other meridian, the declination would require a correction, which might be easily
obtained by interpolation, thus—as 360° : diff. of long. ; : diff. of declination in 24
hours: the correction required. But the maximum error of latitude caused hy the
neglect of this correction will be less than two miles, and will be generally much
less between the limits of Cape Leuwin and New Zealand.
The Sun’s Semi-diameter is used to reduce an observation of the limb to his centre.
Equation of Time.—This is the difference between true solar and mean solar
time ; it is used to find the latter from an observation of the sun. Thus, suppose on
the Ist of January a sun-dial, or any other solar instrument, gave the time 2h. 36m.,
to get the mean time (which is that shown by a well-regulated common clock or
watch), we add 3m. 375.,. which makes the mean time 2b. 39m. 375. If the observation
had been made at noon, we should have added 3m. 345., the same as in the column ;
for any other time than noon, the equation may be easily found by interpolation. For
sun-dial purposes, however, the equation at nearest noon will be sufficiently exact.
The Right Ascension of the Mean Sun is the angular distance in time of the
mean or fictitious sun from the first point of Aries at mean noon. It is the sidereal
time at mean noon, or that which should be shown by a sidereal clock when the
mean-time clock points to 12 at noon. It is used to find the mean time from the
sidereal, or the converse. Thus, suppose the right ascension of Sirius to be 6h. 39m.
385., this therefore will be the sidereal time when Sirius is on the meridian; sub -'
trading from this the sidereal time at the previous noon, we shall have t-he interval of
sidereal time that has elapsed since the preceding noon ; which, by means of the su.b-


Capella

Betelguese

Sirius ..
Castor .. .. ..
Procyon
Pollux ..
sidiary table; given for the purpose of converting sidereal into mean time, may be
easily reduced into an interval of mean time, as in the following example : —Suppose
on the ist of January an altitude of Sirius had been observed which showed that
the star was 3 hours to the east of the meridian, the sidereal time would therefore be
3b. 39m. 385.; subtracting from this xßh. 41m. 205., increasing the former by 24 hours,
we get Bh. 58m. 18s. for the sidereal interval since noon; subtracting from this im. 285.,
obtained from the table, we get Bh. 56m. 50s. for the mean time of the observation.
By means of the table of Semi-Diurnal A res, the mean times of the rising and setting
of the heavenly bodies may be found in a similar manner. If the right ascension of
the true sun is required, it may be found by applying the equation of time to the
right ascension of the mean sun. Thus on the ist of January the right ascension of
the mean sun is ißh. 41m. 205., and that of the true sun is ißh. 44m. 545.
The Moon’s Age is the interval elapsed at mean noon since the last new moon ;
it is given in days and decimal parts of a day.
Moon’s Meridian Passage. —This is the mean astronomical time at which the
moon’s centre passes the meridian, or due north of Melbourne. It is very useful for
finding the time of high water. The symbol c 5 near the time of new moon shows
that the moon will not pass the meridian on that day, the astronomical day beginning
at noon,"twelve hours after the commencement of the civil day.
High Water at Williamstown. —The time Of this table is civil mean time. _ It
has been computed for Gellibrand’s Point, on the assumption that the change tide
takes place at ah. 31m., as deduced by the late Captain Cox, R.N., from a discussion of
the tide-gauge papers for the year iB6O. When the mark occurs, there will be only
one tide that day. Thus, on the 4th of January there will be only a morning tide.
The times here computed may be taken as the average ones when high water may
be expected ; the tides at Port .Phillip, however, are so influenced by winds and other
causes that the actual times of high water will sometimes differ from the calculated
ones by more than three hours.
Duration of Twilight. —This table shows the time taken by the sun to move
from 18° below the horizon to sunrise, and to the same distance after sunset, when
his rays cease to illuminate the sky.

Sesagesima Sunday
Kitchen Garden. —This month is generally too hot and dry to admit of much
being done in gardening operations, except in low, moist situations, where cropping
can be carried on almost at any time. Where water is plentiful and easily applied,
young crops should be watered once or twice a-week, care being taken that the soil
be well stirred with the Dutch hoe after every watering. If rain or dull weather
occur, a few cabbage, carrot, cauliflower, celery, broad and kidney bean, lettuce, pea,
onion, radish, and turnip seeds may be sown to a limited extent; with the exception
of the peas and beans, all the seeds should be slightly protected from the intense sun,
by shading with calico, litter, or some other suitable material. Early potatoes should
be planted for use in April.
Flower Garden. —Dahlias and roses should be looked after; the former requiring
staking, disbudding, mulching, and watering; the latter to be pruned when necessary,
so as to give a fine autumn bloom; decayed flowers should be removed, and every
means used to render the plant vigorous. Carnations should be layered. Chrysan-
themums, phloxes, and other herbaceous plants will want staking and thinning.
Farm.— Farmers will be busy harvesting the grain crops; when the ground is
cleared, lose no time in ploughing or scarifying the stubble, to destroy weeds. If

Kitchen Garden. —Cabbage, caulifloVer, lettuce, spinach, and turnip should be
sown. Early potatoes may be planted largely. Celery and leeks to be transplanted
into trenches. Dig up any vacant ground, in readiness for autumn cropping ; the soil
is pulverised and sweetened by exposure to the atmosphere. Cabbage and cauli-
flower plants should be planted largely. If dry, water as last month,
Flower Garden. —Proceed with the propagation of favourite plants, by layering,
cuttings, or otherwise. Plant at the end of the month a few hyacinths, tulips,
anemones, ranunculi, and narcissi, for early blooming. Sow stocks, larkspur, mig-
nonette, &c. Take care that camelias, azaleas, rhododendrons, and the like plants,
do not suffer from want of water. Climbers must be regulated, the stronger-growing
kinds cut back, and others neatly tied up. Ail decayed flower stems or leaves to be
removed; walks to be kept neat and orderly.
Farm. —The plough will be in active use this month, unless the weather is very
unfavourable. Sow turnips for sheep—also oats. Cape barley, rye, and tares, for
green feed. Continue the use of the horse-hoe amongst drilled crops. Look to your
manure heap, collect everything that is convertible into manure, and, when thoroughly
rotted, cart on to your land.

Kitchen Garden. —Sow cabbage, cauliflower, early horn carrots, brocoli,
lettuce, peas, radish, spinach, and turnip. Kidney potatoes may still be planted.
Earth up celery. Top-dress asparagus beds with salt or seaweed. If new strawberry
beds are required, plant runners as soon as you can obtain them; three-year-old beds
should be destroyed.
Flower Garden. —Dahlias, hollyhocks, liliums, and Pompon chrysanthemums
will now be in their prime; liquid manure will prolong and enhance the beauty of
these flowers; dead blooms must be picked off, or the plants will be impoverished.
This is the best month to sow hardy annual and perennial flower seeds. Prepare
your ground for planting shrubs, ornamental trees, &c.; if not already trenched, get
it done at once. Herbaceous plants can be divided, and planted where wanted; car-
nations and pinks may still be propagated by cuttings under a bell glass.
Farm. —Ploughing will chiefly occupy the farmer’s attention. Plough deep—the
extra expense is trifling compared with the benefits derived. In some districts
wheat-sowing will commence; see that the finest and cleanest samples of seeds are
selected, and do not neglect to dress by using a solution of blue vitriol, at the rate of
1 lb. to the sack.

Kitchen Garden. —Finish manuring and digging ground ere winter sets in.
Take care that young crops of turnips and carrots are kept free from weeds. Con-
tinue planting out cabbages, cauliflower, and celery; the latter would be much
benefited by an occasional dose of guano-water. Sow peas (early varieties), broad
beans, onions, parsley, endive, radish, and spinach. Plant potato-onions, shallots,
garlic, rhubarb, and horse-radish. Earth up celery as required. Look to your herb
bed; where necessary, divide the roots, and make fresh plantations. If strawberry
runners were not planted last month, let them be this.
Flower Garden. —This is one of the busiest months in the year: most kinds of
evergreens, and ornamental and flowering shrubs, are best transplanted now, and
any alterations that are to be made in laying out grounds should be commenced.
Take up gladioli, liliums, and other bulbs that have done flowering; store them away
in boxes, packed in dry sand. Finish planting hyacinths, tulips, crocuses, narcissi.
anemones, ranunculi, ixias, &c. Renovate edgings of camomile, thrift, box, and
thyme. For new plantations of roses the ground should be trenched and heavily
manured; if light soil, some stiff loam should be incorporated with it. Propagate by
cuttings any kind of soft-wooded plants you wish to increase ; bell or hand glasses
are required for this purpose.

Kitchen Garden. —Asparagus, rhubarb, and sea-kale beds will want_ cleaning
and manuring. Sow broad beans, peas, lettuce, onions, radish, and spinach, for
successional crops. Plant out early cabbages and late sowings of celery. Finish
manuring and digging all vacant ground, whether wanted for immediate use or not;
bear in mind that turning over ground in a wet state does it more harm than good.
If ground is wanted for other purposes, carrots, parsnips, and other tap-rooted
vegetables may be taken up and stored.
Flower Garden. —As dahliag and hollyhocks die off, the stalks should be cut
down and cleared away ; the former being taken up and housed in a dry shed or
cellar. Look over your seedling, annual, and other plants ; thin them where thick ;
and keep slugs and other vermin away. Prune perpetual flowering, banksian, and
other spring-blooming roses. Continue planting evergreens, and flowering and
ornamental shrubs; stake the same when necessary. _ Propagate by cuttings fuchsias,
roses, &c. Attend to hedges, keeping them well clipped; if new ones are required,
use hawthorn, furze, osage orange, or acacia, where strength is required; if light,
small hedges are wanted, the small-leaved prickly acacia, Cape broom, sweet briar.

Kitchen Garden. —Get all heavy work in the most forward state possible. This
is the best month for planting all descriptions of fruit trees; trenching and deep
draining are essential to their well-doing ; if soil is poor and manure be needed, use
bone-dust in preference to guano. Commence pruning fruit trees, beginning with
those which have lost their foliage. Sow, to a limited extent, cabbages, cauliflowers,
hrbeoli, early carrots, lettuces, and radishes. Make good sowings of broad beans,
peas, and leeks. Finish planting garlic, shallots, horse-radish, rhubarb, sea-kale, and
asparagus.
Flower Garden.— lf possible, finish planting all kinds of trees; choose calm, dull
weather for the purpose of transplanting, and take care that the roots are mutilated
as little as possible. This is a good time for sowing grass seeds for lawns and borders.
Dig neatly your flower beds, adding, if necessary, a little well-rotted manure. Finish
pruning roses, flowering shrubs, &c. Old rose stools, that have been standing for
years, should be taken up apd replaced with young, vigorous plants.
Farm. —Sow barley and oats largely, either for hay or seed. Continue sowing
beans and peas. Prepare land for mangolds, carrots, potatoes, maize, sorghum,
chicory, tobacco, &c. The deeper the ground is worked, the better will be the crop.
On rainy days, numerous jobs indoors may be done, such as mending and making
pig troughs, hurdles, gates, &c.

Kitchen Garden. —Plant largely of early potatoes; sow parsnips upon rich deep
soil—the latter ought to have been trenched two feet or more. Sow peas largely—
Bedman’s dwarf, blue imperial, champion of England, Burbidge’s eclipse, climax, and
alliance are among the best for general purposes. Sow largely of the various kinds of
broad beans in rows thirty inches apart. Established plantations of rhubarb and sea-
kale may he forced by covering the crowns over with pots or slates, and covering
these again with fresh horse-manure. Plant globe artichokes in rich soil, in rows
four feet six inches’ by three feet. Sow main crops of onions, also spinach, radish,
and small salads.
Flower Garden.—lf former directions have been carried out, there will not
remain much to be done this month, with the exception of keeping all the walks,
borders, and beds neat and clean.
Farm.—Continue ploughing and harrowing lands intended for spring cropping.
Hoe drill crops. Continue sowing grasses, clover, lucerne, and peas ; beans may still
be sown in late localities. Oat and barley sowing should be completed this month if
the weather has been at all favourable.

Kitchen Garden.— This is the busiest month in the year for seed-sowing ; most
of the hardy vegetables may be sown, and towards close of month all the tender sorts.
Potatoes of all kinds should be planted for main crops. Make a sewing of peas for
succession. Early longpod beans may still be sown in low-lying ground. Sow scar-
let runners, dwarf French beans, beet, carrot, cucumber, melon, vegetable marrow,
pumpkin, onion, radish, and spinach; mustard and cress should be sown every fort-
night ; sow celery on a hot-bed. Tomatoes and capsicums may be sown in warm
situations ;if any have been raised in a hot-bed, harden a little and plant out. Plant
Chinese yams and sweet potatoes in well-trenched soil. Fruit trees will require atten-
tion ; with the finger and thumb displace any superfluous shoots, and, if time can be
spared, the blossom buds should be thinned, especially of young trees.
Flower Garden.— The floriculturist has generally numerous insect pests to annoy
him in this month, such-as green and black fly, red spider, scale, and thrip, to say
nothing of slugs, caterpillars, &c. Gishurst’s compound will be found the best remedy
for the former. Plant out calceolarias, cupheas, geraniums, heliotropes, pansies.
salvias, &c. Sow both tender and hardy annuals.
Farm.—Sow carrots, chicory, maize, mangolds, parsnips, and tobacco. Plant

Garden. —If season be moist.
carrots, leeks,
and parsnips may-
still be sown. Sow largely of kidney beans, early turnips, capsicums, tomato, cucum-
ber, vegetable marrow, pumpkins, melons, and parsley; also tall-growing varieties of
peas —they will not grow very high at this season of the year. Plant out largely cab-
bage, cauliflower, brocoli, and celery; also, sow again for succession. Weeds will
grow apace—choose a fine sunny day for hoeing them down, and rake off when
withered, to prevent their starting into iffowth again.
Flower Garden. —Balsams, cockscombs, globe amaranthus, zinnias, and other
tender annuals, should now be sown, if not already done; if sown in pots, and trans-
planted into flowerbeds, place in sunny weather an empty flower-pot over the patches
of young plants; remove the pots every evening, or the plants will grow up weak and
spindling. Climbing plants will be growing fast, and will require constant trimming
and training. See that flower-beds are kept filled, by turning out large plants in pots.
Farm. —This is the last month that potatoes can be planted, except in low-lying
lands. Sow largely of maize and sorghum; mangold-sowing should also be com-
pleted. Earth up early crops of potatoes with double-breasted plough, without delay.

Kitchen Garden. —Beds of rhubarb and sea-kale that have been forced should be
cleaned off. Cease cutting asparagus, or you will weaken the roots. Attend to
cucumbers and melons : if any have missed, sow again. Stop leading shoots of
cucumbers, to induce laterals. If tomatoes are not planted against a wall or fence,
they should be tied up to strong sticks and pruned moderately, or fruit will be small
and few. This is the time for preventing a great deal of pruning in winter. Use the
finger and thumb judiciously in disbudding and stopping fruit trees; thin the fruit
where thick; increased size and superior flavour will be the result. Vines will require
frequent attention as regards training, tying, and thinning shoots.
Flower Garden. —Hybrid perpetual roses should have their shoots pruned back
immediately they have bloomed. Newly-planted shrubs or plants suffering from hot
sunshine should be protected by boughs of tea-tree or wattle. Empty casks, with
both ends knocked out, make very good shelters, although rather unsightly. At
close of month budding may be proceeded with. Flower seeds can still be sown,
although with greater risk of their well-doing than if sown earlier.
B arm. —ln some districts harvesting will have commenced, and farmers generally
will have little time to attend to growing crops of mangolds, potatoes, &c., but if

greened, by exposing them to the atmosphere for a few days, under the protection of
a shed or verandah.
Flower Garden. —Bulbs that have flowered and died away should be taken up
and packed in dry sand. This is the best month for planting out dahlias for autumn
blooming. Roses and fruit trees may be budded. Newly-planted shrubs and trees
will be benefited by having some rotted stable straw spread on surface of soil, which
should first be well stirred.
Farm. —Wheat harvest will be getting general in earlier districts : both wheat and
oats should be cut before being thoroughly ripe. If for malting, English barley
should be fully ripe. Hoe and earth up potatoes.

Signals.
TIDAL SIGNALS.
Point Lonsdale.— The following tidal signals are exhibited daily at Point Lons-
dale flagstaff between sunrise and sunset; and the signal-keeper has instructions, if he
sees ships approaching the Heads and running into danger, to warn them by the Com-
mercial Code of signals. Strangers therefore should watch these signals. Flood-tide
Signals.—A blue flag will be hoisted half-mast high when the tide begins to flow in
the middle of the entrance between Point Lonsdale and Point Nepean; it will be
kept flying all the first quarter of the flood tide ; second quarter, a blue flag at mast-
head ; third quarter, a red flag half-mast high ; last quarter, a red flag at mast-head.
Ebb-tide Signals— During ebb fide the signals are as follows, viz. First quarter,
a blue flag half-mast high, with a ball underneath; second quarter, a blue flag at
mast-head, with a ball underneath ; third quarter, a red flag half-mast high, with a
ball underneath ; last quarter, a red flag at mast-head, with a ball underneath.
By attention to these signals the true state of the tide, which cannot always be ascer-
tained by the usual process of finding the time of high water, will be known, the
strength and duration of the tide being so much influenced by the wind and weather.
. River Yarra.— The height of water in the Yarra is now shown by a self-acting
tide-gauge, erected on the outer red dolphin at the entrance of the river. To assist
persons on board vessels at a distance in ascertaining the height of water shown by
the self-acting tide-gauge, six projecting arms are fixed on its south side, th,e upper
edge of each arm coinciding with the lower gart of each figure on the face of the
tide-gauge, which commences with the ten-feet mark. N.B.—The top of the indi-
cator, as it is moved up or down by the tide, shows on the face of the gauge the
height of water over the shoalest part of the fairway.
Geelong. —The following tidal signals are exhibited on board the Geelong light-
ship, to indicate the depth of water on the bar One blue flag, 10 feet; one ball,
roj feet; one ball, blue flag over, n feet; one ball, blue flag under, nj feet; two
balls, 12 feet ; two balls, blue fla g under, feet; two balls, blue flag over, 13 feet;

BAIL WAY NOTES.
The lines now projected in Victoria, their length, and probable cost,
are as follows ; Cost.
CUSTOMS EETUENS FOE 1873.
The imports for the year 1873 represents a total of £16,533,856 ;
for 1872. £13,691,322.; increase in 1873, £2,842,534. Exports, 1873,
£15,302,454; 1872, £13,871,195 ; increase in 1873, £1,431,259.
To Stop Coughing, Sneezing, &c.— The morbid phenomena of
respiration can always be stopped by the influence of arrest. Cough-
ing, for instance, can be stopped by pressing on the nerves of the lip
in the neighbourhood of the nose. A pressure there may prevent a
cough when it is beginning. It is generally known that sneezing
may be stopped by this plan, but it is new to many that it can check
coughing. Pressing in the neighbourhood of the ear, right in front
of the ear, may stop coughing. It is also preventive of hiccough, but
much less so than of sneezing or coughing. Pressing very hard on the
top of the mouth inside is also a means of stopping coughing.

Directions for Making a Will. —Transfer of Land Statute.
DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING A WILL.
A will cannot be made in language too simple or concise; it must
be written with ink, on paper or parchment; and, if contained on
one sheet, must be signed at the end by the testator in the presence
of two or more witnesses, and, if written on more than one sheet, the
testator and the witnesses must sign each sheet.
The witnesses must rigidly comply with every particular required
by the attestation clause, at the end of which clause they must sign
their names.
If a witness be interested in a will, his claim to such interest
becomes forfeited. This should not be forgotten, as, in order to be a
legal witness, it is not necessary that the party witnessing should
know the contents of the will.
A codicil to a will is to be made with the same regulations as the
will itself, and may be written thus :-—This is a codicil to my last
Will and Testament, bearing date the day of 18 and which
I direct to be taken as part thereof. I give, devise, and bequeath,
&c. As witness my hand this day of
FORM OP A WILL.
This is the last Will and Testament of me
made this day of One
thousand eight hundred and as follows. I give, devise,
and bequeath all my messuages, lands, tenements, and hereditaments,
and all my household furniture, ready money, money secured by
life assurance, goods and chattels, and all other my real and per-
sonal estate and effects whatsoever and wheresoever, unto' my dear
wife [or other relative, as may be] her
heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, to and for her and their
own absolute use and benefit, according to the nature and quality
thereof respectively, subject only to the payment of my just debts,
funeral and testamentary expenses, and the charges, of proving and
registering this my Will. And I appoint my said wife executor of
this my Will, and hereby revoke all other Wills.
In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand the day and year
above written.
Signed published and acknowledged by the said j
as and for his last Will and Tes- j
tament in the presence of us, who in his presence >
and at his request, and in the presence of each (
other, have subscribed our names as witnesses j
Note. —Obliterations or alterations of any sort in a Will ought, if possible, to
be avoided; when of necessity made, they must be signed by the Testator and
Witnesses in the. margin, or as near to the alteration as possible.
Marriage after making a Will renders the Will void.
If a person wishes to dispose of all his property in one gift, the words “ all my
real and personal estate” may be used.
TRANSFER OF LAND STATUTE.
To facilitate the operations of Friendly Societies interested in land
under the above Statute, a transfer of any land, whether freehold or
leasehold, held by registered proprietors, being trustees for any society
established or to be established under the “ Friendly Societies’ Statute,
1865,” and holding the land as such trustees, signed by the persons
who are for the time being the trustees of the society, shall be as

effectual to all intents and purposes as if the same transfer had been
signed by the registered proprietors for the time being of the land,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary hereof contained in the
said “ Transfer of Land Statute.”
The Commissioner of Titles, in any case within the forty-fifth
section of the last-mentioned Statute, in which members of Friendly
Societies are interested, may before making an order thereunder
dispense with the advertisement required by the forty-sixth section
thereof.
MEDICAL NOTES.
THE TREATMENT OF DIPHTHERIA.
The following prescription, obtained from Dr. J. A. Moore, Tas-
mania, has been successfully employed in several hundred cases :
Take ipecacuanha powder, 20 grains ; tartar emetic powder, 2
grains ; mix. To be taken, for one dose, in a little water ;at once,
as an emetic.
Take Beaufoy’s solution of chloride of soda, 1 oz.; water, 3ozs.;
mix. To be used as a gargle frequently.
Take muriated tincture of iron, \ oz.; water, 8 ozs.; mix. A table-
spoonful in a wineglass of water three or four times a day.
The foregoing proportions are suited to an adult. The doses for
children may be regulated, according to age, by the following table
Gauhin's Table. —Regulating the ordinary proportion of doses,
according to the age of the patient. For an adult, suppose the dose
to be 1, or 1 drachm. Under 1 year will require l-12th, or 5 grains ;
under 2 years, l-Bth, or 8 grains ; under 8 years, l-6th, dr 10 grains ;
under 4 years, l-4th, or 15 grains; under 7 years, l-3rd, or 1 scruple ;
under 14 years, or a drachm ; under 20 years, 2-3rds, or 2 scruples;
from 21 to 60, the full dose, 1, or 1 drachm. Above 60, an inverse
gradation should be observed.
Mr. Geeathead’s Remedy.—Give four drops of sulphuric acid
in a glass of water ; mix the two well together by pouring out of one
glass into another a few times ; then give it to patient to drink. The
quantity will not hurt any one, and is also a good purifier of the
blood. Any person can get for 6d. as much acid as will serve him
for his lifetime.
The Royal Commission’s Mode of Treatment.—The plan
advocated by the Royal Commission on Diphtheria is to keep the
apartment, in which the patient is placed, constantly filled with an
atmosphere of the fumes of burning sulphur, as dense as the patient
can bear, and to continue this night and day till some decisive effect
is produced on the disease.
Sunstroke.—When a person is seized with severe pains in the
head, after exposure to the sun, and exhibits signs of an aberration
of intellect, he may safely be supposed to be labouring under this
disease. In that case, the person should, if out of doors, be removed
to the nearest shady spot. Let the neck be uncovered, the head
gently raised, and .then trust entirely to dashing cold water upon the
head and chest. Above all things, no bleeding. If in the house, but
not within reach of medical advice or assistance, the treatment


Medical Notes.
should be the same. To bleed a person struck down by sunstroke is
in all probability to kill him. Persevere with the cold water until
consciousness is quite restored. Do not be disheartened. Use the
water freely, especially over the chest, letting it fall in a full stream
from a foot or two in height. Be not misled by the symptoms, which
may seem to be those of apoplexy, and on no account permit a drop
of blood to be drawn. Where the symptoms are not absolute prostration,
but severe pains in the head, and aberration of intellect, the patient
should be closely watched, lest he make an attempt upon his own
life. In all cases, moreover, medical advice and assistance should be
secured at the earliest possible moment, even supposing the patient
to show signs of improvement, for these cases are always critical,
and require the utmost care.
Snake-Bites.— An easy diagnosis of snake-bite, apparently not
generally known, even by the faculty, is thus given in Krefft’s Snakes
of Australia :—lnnocuous snakes, when they bite, leave marks
thus : • •
Yenomous snakes, when they bite, leave two punctures only, thus :
HOW TO BRING UP BABIES.
1. Keep them warm. Let the clothing be warm, but not tight.
Give them plenty of fresh air. Send them out whenever the weather
is fine. Open the windows at least twice every day. Wash the child
all over, with warm water, daily.
Food (under seven months). —2, If the mother has plenty of milk
let her give the child nothing else until it is seven months old. Three
out of four children brought up by hand die. If the mother has only
a little milk, let the child have it, as well as food of the sort
stated in rule 3. Begin to wean the baby when it is seven months
old. 3. If the child must be brought up by hand, it should be fed
with warm milk and water out of a bottle. It should have at first
equal parts of milk and water. When it is about a month old two
parts of milk should be put to one of water. If the milk should
disagree, it may be boiled before it is put into the bottle. Bach
bottleful should have a little sugar put into it—a small lump, or half
a small teaspoonful. Give the baby no other kind of food whatever.
While the baby is under a month old, do not give more than a sixth
of a pint of milk-and-water for one meal. The bottle should draw
easily. It should be rinsed out with water every time it is used. It
is a good plan to keep tube and cork in clean water. If the bottle is
not quite clean the milk will turn sour, and the child will be made ill.
Food (over seven months). —4. When it has reached the age of
seven months the child should have one or two meals a day of milk,
thickened with Robb’s biscuit, Hard’s farinaceous food, Liebig’s food,
baked flour, or good well-baked bread. This should be given out of
a bottle, and should be thin enough to pass through a sieve or
strainer. The child should have, besides this, plenty of warm milk,
slightly sweetened. When the child is eight or nine months old, it
should be completely weaned. At 10 months it should have a little
thin broth or beef-tea every day. At a year and a half, give it a little
meat every day, cut up very fine, or pounded.

WEATHER TABLE FOR 1875.
The following Weather Table, for 1875, has been compiled on the basis of Sir
John Herschell’s observations in the Northern Hemisphere, afterwards verified
for the Southern Hemisphere, by careful observations at Sydney. In giving this
Table, the reader is not to understand that it is given him as an absolutely
correct Weather Guide; it is approximate only, but we may add that the Table
for 1874 has been found singularly correct. The dates give the commencement
of the change, to be indicated by the falling or rising of the Barometer. The
actual weather named may be some hours afterwards.

NOTES ON GARDENING.
Propagation. —ln a state of nature all plants are propagated from
seed, and the multifarious forms of the seeds and envelopes with
which they are provided is one of the many interesting subjects of
investigation to the lover of nature. For our purpose it is sufficient
to state that most seeds are covered with a hard shell or envelope,
which protects them from external injury; that within this envelope
lies the embryo plant. All seeds in this latent state contain an organ,
or germ, which, under favourable circumstances, shoots upwards,
and becomes the stem of the plant; another, called the radicle,
which seeks its place in the soil, and becomes the root; and the seed-
lobes, which yield nourishment to the young plant in its first stage of
growth. Moisture, heat, and air are necessary conditions for the
development of all seeds; and most of them require, in addition, con-
cealment from the light. It is found, however, that except in the
case of annuals (as plants raised from seed, which grow, produce
their seeds, and ripen their fruit in one year, are called), much time is
lost by following this mode of propagation; it is also found that the
seed does not always produce the same identical plant. This
has led to other methods of multiplying; for, besides the roots
properly so called, which attach themselves to the soil, and draw
from it the principal nourishment of the plant, it is found that
each branch conceals under its outward covering a bundle of
fibres or tissues, which, under favourable circumstances, develope
roots, and become the basis of an independent plant, identical
with that from which it sprang. Many plants have also a crown
with buds or eyes, each capable of propagating its species. Every
plant with roots of this description may be divided into as many
portions as there are eyes, taking care that a few fibres are attached
to the root, and each will become an independent plant. The potato,
and all the bulbous and tuberous plants, are familiar examples of
this principle of propagation; so are the dahlia and pseony, which
grow better when the set is confined to a piece of the tuber, with one
eye attached, than when planted whole. So conspicuous is this in
the potato, that, where it is planted whole, all the eyes except one, or
at most two, should be scooped out with a sharp knife, because the
young plant will thus be supplied with more of its natural pabulum
while it is rooting, and will increase its vigour. Other plants throw
off short stems, like the daisy and house-leek, by means of which
they are propagated. Others again, like the strawberry, throw off
runners, each of which is furnished with its root-fibre already
elaborated, only requiring soil in which to root itself. But there are
others, where nature requires the aid of art, and this has given rise
to the operation which will be found explained under the article
Layering.
Layering. —Layering, which consists in arresting the circulation of
the sap on its return to thd roots, is one of the most useful methods of
propagation. In this operation an upward slit is made half across a
joint; and by fixing the part so cut in favourable soil, the latent
fibre expands into a root, and the branch becomes an independent
plant. The process is well adapted for pinks, carnations, roses,
and many other plants. It is, indeed, a very important operation
in gardening, and should be neatly executed. Choosing the


Notes on Gardening.
suitable branch of the carnation, for instance, which is first
stripped of all branches below the joint selected, and being furnished
with a very sharp knife, the operator begins his incision a quarter
of an inch below a joint, passing the blade through it in an oblique
direction to a quarter of an inch above, taking care that the cut
terminates as nearly as possible in the centre of the stem; the
tip of the tongue thus made is cut off with a clean sharp cut, and the
layer pegged down in a little fine rich mould, but not more than an
inch under the soil. In the case of carnations, the plant is in a fit
state for the operation as soon as the flowering season is over; and
no stem which has already produced flowers should be employed for
the purpose. In the case of roses, and other shrubby plants, all that
is required is to run the knife sufficiently through a joint to make an
opening or crack near it, and peg down the wounded part three
inches below the surface of the soil, pressing the soil lightly round
it, and leaving that part of the branch above the soil as erect as
possible. The roots will soon form, and then the new plant may be
separated from the parent tree.
Cuttings. —Cuttings in general may be considered as of two
kinds, matured wood and young green shoots. The former, whatever
they may be, strike readily, and with very little care. An American
plan, which is very successful, is to lay them in slightly-damped
moss, or to drop them lightly into a wide-mouthed bottle, having a
piece of damp sponge at the bottom and a covering of muslin over
the top. In either of these methods a callus is soon formed, and the
cuttings readily throw out roots. Cuttings of young green shoots,
however, require a very different treatment; they must be so man-
aged as never to be allowed to flag; and the following appears to be
the best method that can be pursued. Put silver-sand about an inch
deep into shallow pans (common saucers answer every purpose), and
in these plant the cuttings. Then pour carefully upon the sand
enough water to make a thin sheet about it. The lower leaves of
the cuttings are to be removed before planting, and the stalk fixed
firmly into the sand before the water is poured on. These tender
young green shoots, or cuttings, will be better for a little shade and
heat. A piece of thin muslin or tissue-paper will provide the former,
and heat may be had by placing the pan of cuttings over a basin of
hot water, refilled twice a day. These cuttings will be rooted and
ready for potting off before the water in which they are grown has
dried up.
Disbudding. —The. object of disbudding is to remove all useless
sprays not required for next year’s branches, which would not, from
their position, ripen into desirable fruit-bearing wood; it is, in fact,
to relieve the tree from nursing wood that must be cut away in the
autumn pruning; but it must be the care of the operator to avoid re-
moving shoots well placed for future branches, or which would ex-
pose the tree to too severe a trial of its vital power.
Perennials. —Those plants are called perennials which do not
require annual cultivation. They are not woody, and generally die
down to the ground every year, and spring up again the year follow-
ing. Some, however, do not die down, but retain their leaves, as
pinks, carnations, saxifrages'; and these, on this account, are called
evergreen perennials.


Notes on Gardening.
Drainage. —However high and apparently dry a situation may
appear, it is quite possible that it requires to be drained. The object
of draining is not only to get rid of superfluous moisture, but also to
prevent the little there may be from remaining stagnant. It is quite
a common occurrence to find a piece of ground that is never too wet,
but which is, nevertheless, sour and unfitted for the cultivation of
delicate flowers. It should, therefore, be the first care of the florist to
make drains from the highest part of the ground to the lowest, three
feet from the surface, dug fire shape of aY; and if there be no outlet
at the lowest part, to dig a hole, or well, or pond, into which all
these should lead, even when there is no apparent means of getting
rid of the water. At the bottom of these drains a row of common
2-inch earthen pipes may be placed, end to end, and covered up again
with the soil. These are too deep to cause any danger of disturbance
in ordinary operations; and the effect is to let air into the soil, if
there be no surplus moisture; and to prevent the lodgment of water
anywhere : about a rod apart, in parallel lines, will be sufficiently
close for the drains, and a larger drain along the bottom, or a ditch,
may lead at once to the outlet or the -receptacle for the water.
Suppose, however, the soil is really surcharged with water, and there
is no place but the pond made for the purpose into which this water
can pass, and suppose, while we are imagining evils, that this pond
or hole fills higher than the bottoms of the drains, it is obvious, in
such cases, that the drains cannot empty themselves. Still, even
such drains are of use ; if they can only discharge all the water in
the driest season, immense good is done by them. If the pond be
not too large, a garden-engine may be-set to work to lower the water
by throwing it over the surface ; and although it may fill as fast as
the water is taken away, there is a circulation of water going on in
the soil, instead of moisture being stagnant, and the ground made
sour.
Mulching. —This operation consists in spreading a layer of
stable-dung over the roots of trees or plants, and in times of drought
watering through it. After a time the dung may be forked into the
soil.
Gumming.—To get rid of gumming in fruit trees, scrape the gum
clean away, wash well the place where it has accumulated, and stop
it with a compost of horse-dung, clay, and tar.
Iron in Water. —Carefully avoid for gardening purposes all water
impregnated with iron. No plants thrive well that come in contact
with it.
To Check Snails and Slugs in time, commence soil-liming with
the sowing of early seeds, when the days are sunny and the earth
sufficiently dry to allow of working among the soil with freedom.
Use hot or quick-lime liberally, and merely hoeing, raking, or pointing
it on the surface ; give good coatings of it also over strawberry drills,
by boxwood edgings, the sides of walls, and on other vermin-har-
bouring places ; renewing surface dustings frequently afterwards,
when it becomes washed away, saturated, or inert.
Vases.—These may be introduced into pleasure-grounds, especially
upon terraces, with very good effect. They can be filled with soil
and planted, or pots of choice flowers can be set in them and changed
as soon as the blossom begins to fade.


Useful Recipes.
NEW AND USEFUL RECIPES.
To Destroy Ants. —Place an inverted garden-pot over the nest,
and the ants will work into it. Remove the pot in a day or two, by
placing a spade underneath it; then plunge it, with its contents, into
boiling water; and repeat the process if necessary. Ants may be
expelled from any particular plant by sprinkling it well with sulphur ;
they may also be kept away from wall-fruit, and other fruit while
ripening, by drawing a broad band with chalk along the wall near
the ground, and round the stems of the trees.
To Destroy White Ants. —The destroyer must dig for the nest
until he finds the queen, who is easily known by the enormous bulk
of her abdomen ; and when she is captured the swarm will remove.
Cheap Filtering. —Take about half a pound of white worsted
cut into lengths of about a foot, or any other woollen material cut
into strips of an equal length, and suspend them all round a tub or
other vessel containing the water to be filtered, and they will speedily
empty it into any other vessel that may be placed underneath to
catch it. These lengths of worsted or strips of cloths act as so many
small syphons for draining off the water, and the principle on which
the filtering process is carried out appears to be that the water
ascends through capillary tubes, which will not admit of the passage
of any foreign matter. For those residing in country districts, where
pure water cannot be obtained without difficulty during the hot
season, this, if acted upon, must be a special convenience.
To Prevent Meat from Putrifying. — A solution of five parts of
borax in 100 of water will, it is said, prevent the putrefactive process
in meat for a considerable time. Flesh dipped in the mixture, and
then dried, resists the usual process of decomposition.
To Keep Apples. —Let them be well dried, and pack in a hamper,
or box without lid, wrapped in straw, or covered with saw-dust, in layers.
Keep in a cool place, and not exposed to frost. Apples should always
be plucked when the weather is fine, and when packed they should
not touch one another.
Poison in Mangold Leaves. —Cattle or pigs eating too freely
of the green leaves of mangold wurzel are likely to be poisoned, as
these leaves have been found to contain a large quantity of oxalic
acid.
How TO Catch Rats. —“ A new manner of catching rats is,”
according to the New York Tribune, “exciting great interest
in Madison-ave. A barrel is filled half-full of water. A layer of
powdered cork is laid on its surface, and over this a layer of corn-
meal is sifted. A chair and a box or two are placed unobtrusively in
the neighbourhood, whereby the rat gains the edge of the barrel. He
sees nothing but the meal. He has no innate ideas which teach him
to beware of the treacherous foundation on which that tempting
surface rests. He sniffs, he leaps, and goes gently down through
meal and cork to his watery grave. If any of his friends see him
disappear from the end of the barrel, they hasten after him to get
their share of the probable plunder, and are in turn taken in by
hospitable death. The plan seems effective as against the rats, but
is calculated to destroy their confidence in human nature.”'
To Discover Alum in Bread. —Heat a knife, and thrust it into a
loaf or cake; if alum be present, it will partially coat the knife.


Useful Recipes.
To Pueify Eancid Butter. —Let the butter be melted and
skimmed as for clarifying; then put into it a piece of bread, well
toasted all over. In a minute or two the butter will lose its offensive
smell and taste.
Scurf in the Head.— A simple and effectual remedy. Into a
pint of water drop a lump of fresh quick-lime the size of a walnut;
let it stand all night, then pour the water off clear from sediment or
deposit, add a quarter of a pint of the best vinegar, and wash the
head with the mixture. It is perfectly harmless. Only wet the
roots of the hair.
A Plate Powder. —Polisher’s putty and burnt hartshorn, of
each four ounces ; prepared chalk, eight ounces.
’ Ebmbdy for Loose Teeth. —When the front teeth become
loose without any apparent cause, a diseased state of the gums may
be suspected. Sometimes—nay, often—the teeth may be set firm
again by washing out the mouth three or four mornings running with
tincture of myrrh, about a teaspoonful in a third of a tumbler of
water. The following is also a good mouth wash : —lnfusion of
roses, six ounces ; borax, one ounce ; honey of roses, one ounce.
Household Brewing. —To 3 gallons of water put \ lb. of hops,
and boil until they sink ; then add 3 lbs. of white sugar and 2 ozs. of
whole ginger (pounded up) ; then strain the whole into a bucket, and
leave it till it becomes warm; then add two tablespoonfuls of yeast,
and let it rest covered over in a warm place for 24 hours ; then skim
the yeast off, and put it into bottles and cork well. The best water to
use is rain water. Another Recipe. —-For five gallons of water take 3
ozs. hops, 2 ozs. whole ginger crushed, 3 lbs. of 4d. sugar, and 1 lb. 3|d.
sugar ; boil these for two hours ; put into a cask two teaspoonsful of
cream of tartar and a little isinglass ; strain what has been boiled into
the cask, and when milk-warm add two tablespoonsful of good yeast.
In winter stand in cask for four days, in summer two days, skimming
freely ; then bottle.
To Prevent Damp Walls. —To effectually prevent rain penetrat-
ing through walls, use 16 pounds of tallow to one bushel of best
roche lime, slacked in bushels and laid on with a brush immediately.
Melting the fat over the fire secures a smooth surface, which will not
be if it is dissolved in the lime. Of course the walls must have three
coats possessing the above proportions of lime and fat, adding colour-
ing to the third coat to suit the taste.
How to make Hens Layl —To three gallons of' boiling water
add one-half of an ounce of common salt, a teaspoonful of Cayenne
pepper, and four ounces of lard. Stir the mixture until the pepper
has imparted considerable of its strength to the water. Meanwhile
the salt will have been dissolved and the lard melted. Then, while
yet boiling hot, stir in a meal made of oats and corn, ground toge-
ther in equal proportions, until a thick mush is formed. Before
feeding, taste to see that you have not an overdose either of salt or
pepper, and to prevent the hens being imposed upon with a mixture
not fit to be eaten, nor so hot with pepper that you could not
swallow it.
Docks.—Docks, as dandelions, may be got rid of by cutting off
the tops as soon as they appear, and placing a little salt on the
wound.


Immigrants and Emigrants', &c.
HINTS TO NEWLY-ARRIVED IMMIGRANTS.
The United Kingdom Passengers’ Act, passed for the protection
of emigrants and others, provides thus for Breach of Contract : —
In case of failure to comply with the stipulations in the contract-
ticket, cabin and other passengers may recover, in a summary way,
before a justice of the peace, damages not exceeding, with costs, the
amount of their passage-money, and £2O. And on arrival at port,
passengers are. entitled to sleep and be maintained on board for 48
hours after the ship reaches her destination, unless the vessel has not
completed her voyage, and quits the port earlier for the terminal one.
HINTS’ TO EMIGRANTS TO ENGLAND.
Passengers’ Baggage. —The luggage of all passengers arriving in
England is subjected to examination, but the Custom House officers
are instructed to exercise a liberal discretion in carrying out their
duties, and very little trouble is given to Australian passengers unless
there be attempt at concealment of dutiable goods. All merchandise
brought by passengers must be entered and passed in the usual
manner, or it is liable to forfeiture, together with any other goods
with which it may be packed. Passengers’ boxes and effects are
usually sent- to the Baggage Warehouse for examination, the owner,
or agent appointed by him, being present when the inspection is
made. There are several agents in London who make this their
special business, supposing the owner has not the time or inclination
to see after it himself ; the captain or officers of the ship can gene-
rally name reliable persons.

the introduction of immigrants,
by the colony upon
its separation from
New South Wales, 1851, to the end of 1872-3, The number intro-
duced during that period was 168,357.
The average number of miners employed upon the' gold-fields
during 1872 was 54,659, and for the past year 52,544, or 2107 less
than in 1872. For the last eight years there has been a constant
decrease in the number of men engaged in gold-mining, owing
in a great measure to the largely-increased use of machinery.
Although the yield of gold has fallen off there is very little difference
in the average individual earnings. In 1866, the value of each
miner’s earnings was 31s. per week ; in 1868, 365.; in 1869, a trifle
less than 31s?; in 1870, a fraction more than 325. per week ; in 1871,
about 345. 6d. per week ; in 1872, a small fraction over 375. per week;
and in 1873, rather more than 365. 6d. per week.

Note.—lt is to be borne in mind, with reference to the of vines, that
while the acreage and number of vines, in common with the remainder of the
statistics, are for the year ending March 31, 1874, the quantity of grapes
gathered, and of wine and brandy made, are for the previous season. The
grape crop comes in too late to admit of its being returned when the agricul-
being returned when
tural statistics are collected.
Our vine-growing statistics for the 81st of March last were as
follows :
