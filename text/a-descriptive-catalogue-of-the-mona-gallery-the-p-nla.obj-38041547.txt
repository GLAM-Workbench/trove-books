MR. SMART S GALLERY OF OIL PAINTINGS AT MONA.
The opening to the public of Mr, Smart s Gallery
of Paintings at Mona cannot but be viewed by every
enlightened mind as a new and important
epoch in our social progress ?a precedent and an
example calculated to produce the best possible
effects in the elevation and refinement of the
intellectual tastes of a large ancf important class in
this community. Such a liberality on the part of
wealthy and judicious lovers of the Pine Arts?-who
have gathered, one by one, many of the chefs d?oeuvre
of those glorious Old Masters whose names are house-
hold words to all that delight in the grand and
beautiful?is, we are aware, by no means uncommon
in the mother country and on the continent of Europe.
Here, however, we may take leave to say, the plea-
sure of seeing anything of the sort is a most refresh-
ing and attractive novelty,?a something unhoped-for
that supplies a want which has long been felt, filling
up the vacuum in such a manner that the privilege
conceded will be very eagerly appreciated. It would,
under existing circumstances, be a great boon to the
rising families of the gentry and citizens of Sydney to
have any gallery of good oil paintings thrown open
(with all proper restrictions of course) for public in-
spection. Mr. Smart?s Gallery at Mona, however,
goes very far beyond satisfying what has hitherto been
so much desiderated in this respect. Those amongst
? once ever thoroughly familiar with the works of the
;nces of the Peneil, who have long been re-
vered in the History of Art, can here again renew
their acquaintance with what (at a greater or less
lapse of time) once delighted their taste, and more
than gratified their judgment; and they may, with
ease and unalloyed pleasure, kindly instruct those
who have never enjoyed their advantages.
The gallery at Mona stands on the southern side of
the magnificent residence of Mr. T. W. Smart, M.P.,
situated at Darling Point, on a spot not less adorned
by Nature than by Art. The views from this
charming locality embrace such a combination
of rocks, woods, houses, and waveless bays
as could have been very happily transferred to
canvas by many of those great artists whose works
now adorn the walls of the gallery. After a long voyage
over the trackless ocean, many thousands of miles
further thah any such a goodly company of paintings
ever yet sailed in the history of the known world, the
valuable works of many ancient and modern masters are
now safely deposited in the gallery at Darling Point,
where they have been judiciously hung under the
careful superintendence of Mrs. Smart. The gallery
itself is a handsome piece of masonry,, sixty-five feet
long by twenty-five feet wide, lighted in the pro-
per manner, by clerestory windows in the
roof. On entering from the corridor the ? old world?
visitor is forcibly struck with the majestic -aspect of
the paintings, the statuary, and the many other
attractive objects, which there await his inspection.
In the stillness of the place, and at the unwonted
beauty of the coup d?ceil, he is carried back to recollec-
tions of what he never expected to find in realised
New South Wales. It seems hard for him to imagine
that he is any longer in busy, struggling, mercantile
Australia, when he looks on this large and valuable
collection from the Yenetian, Italian, Spanish, Ger-
man, Dutch, Flemish, and English Schools of Painting.
To recapitulate all the great artists which are honour-
ably commemorated on the walls of the Mona Gallery
would render it necessary for us to run through the
catalogue. Suffice it to say that on the list will be
found the names of Raffaelle, Rubens, Carlo Dolci, a different degree of interest in the rather lengthy
Ludovico Caracci, Annibale Carracci, Murillo, Mola, narrative The dog takes advantage of the oppor.

example of one of our greatest English painters is in

authenticity, which the composition itself supplies, it-
is not uninteresting to observe that it is both signed
and dated. ? G.Md. 1792 ? will be seen to the left of
the picture in the foreground.
(No. 29.) A rocky Landscape, with waterfall and fauns
By Paul Brill, born at Antwerp, in 1554. The wild
character of the spot selected for representation by this
Flemish artist is very striking and grand. Br il was
patronised by Sixtus V. and Clement VIII., and
was very successful in historical painting. His
landscapes were so much esteemed that even the great
Annibale Caracci did not disdain to embellish them
with his admirable figures. Paul Brill died at Rome
in the year 1626.
(No. 30.) The Prayer of Lotonn, by Abraham
Hondius, Rotterdam, 1638. This little picture is
in Hondius? very best manner, and should by no
means be overlooked. It illustrates an incident in the
old myth of Latona and her offspiing. As the storv
goes, that lady was insulted by some country louts
who were cutting rushes. Justly incensed, and not
without some personal interest in the high
court of Olympus, Latona prayed to Jove to come
her relief. Her prayer was instantly answered, and
the offending parties were all turned into frogs. It is
?difficult for the most fatidious critic to find anythino-
in this exquisite picture that is undeserving of praise?
The figures of the poor wanderer and her in hint chil-
dren, her impassioned air of entreaty, the surprise and
alarm of the eldest boy at what is taking place, the
changing forms of the cowaidly brutes wffio have in-
sulted his mother, and the distant evening sky, are all
very striking and unexceptionable. The' ? paint-
ing of Latona and her Sons is exceed-
ingly elaborate and beautiful. The artist with
whom this spirited picture originated came to
England in the reign of Charles the 11., and at the
court of the Merry Monarch met with considerable
encouragement. His best pictures (and this is
certainly one of them) are little, if at all, inferior to
Snyders, or Fyt, either as regards design or touch.
Hondius died in London in 1695.
(No. 31.) a Landscape with Cattle, by Adrian Van
T Velde, Amsterdam, 1639. The artist of this ad-
mirable little painting was a pupil of John Wynant
and in some respects he decidedly excelled hismaster!
His animals in particular have never been surpassed!
Van De Velde died at Amsterdam in 1672,
(No. 32.) Peasants Drinking, by David Teniers the
younger. Antwerp 1610. The carousal is taking
place at a table near a cottage in the left hand corner ?
on the right is a stream and wood with a chateau!
It is signed with the monogram of this great Flemish
painter?a Tina D, and an Eina D. These letters
will be found in the left corner. Teniers (who is said
to have enjoyed the advantage of lessons
in the principles of colouring from Ru-
bens) was patronised by the most illus-
trious persons of his time. Although extremely
successful in historical subjects, Teniers was fond of
representing village ftstivals,merry-makings. Flemish
fairs, and such like scenes; in the repre- station of
which he displayed a characteristic originality and
naimte of expression, in which he is unrivalled. He
died at Brussels, in 1694, at the great age of 84 years.
(No. 33.) A Composition, by Peter Paul Rubens;
several Ladies and Cavaliers at a Fete Ghampetre.
From the Collection of the Duke of Lucca. This great
master was born in 1577, at Antwerp, and died in
that city in the year 1640. Universally looked upon
as the head of the Flemish school, Rubens was also
(singularly enough) scarcely less eminent as a scholar
and a diplomatist. He was first under the tuition of
Tobias Verhaecht, an artist in landscape, and after-
wards the pupil of Adam Van Oort, whose works
were at that period in very high reputation. Subse-
quently Rubens entered the school of Otho Venius
In his twentj 1 -third year he went to Italy for the pur-
pose of improving himself by the contemplation and
study of the masters of that country. At this stage of
ms life Hubens was favoured bv the discriminating
patronage of Archduke Albert, and that of the Duke
of Mantua ; the latter of whom (to have the dis-
tingmshed artist near his person) appointed him one
ot the gentlemen of his chamber. Rubens also visited
Venice, in order to devote himself to the works of
litian and Paul Veronese, whose peculiar excellencies
had made a deep impression upon bis active and
highly cultivated mind. Wherever he went this great
painter became extremely popular-highlv esteemed
both as an artist and a man. In 1620, he was, by Marv
di Medicis commissioned to ornament the Gallery- of the !
Luxembourg, and finally completed that great under!
taking in 1623. Five years after that he went to
Madrid, where he was treated with the greatest dis-
! tinction by Philip IV., and his celebrated minister
. the Duke de Olivares. The royal collections of the
i Escudal, of Prado, and of Madrid, were all thrown
open to him?an inexhaustible mine of intellectual
. wealth of which Rubens well knew how to avail him-
self. Whilst in Spain he painted several pictures, for
which he was right royally rewarded?complimented
1 with the honour of knighthood, and presented with
. the golden key as Gentleman of the Chamber to his
Most Catholic Majesty. In 1627, as the accredited
' representative of the Court of Spain, he paid a visit to
England, and was received by King Charles the Eirst
1 with every mark of distinction. Whilst in the last-
; named country he painted the ceiling of the Banqueting
1 House, and brought about a peace between his royal
s patrons?King Philip and King Charles. Having
been knighted by the latter monarch, he finally re-
i turned to the Netherlands, where he was received
i with the honours due to his exalted merit. He died
i at Antwerp in the year 1640, and was buried in the
i church of St. James with extraordinary pomp
?(Perhaps no painter,? says Bryan, ? has left behind
1 him so many and such considerable proofs of the ex-
cellence and variety of his powers. He painted his-
tory, portraits, landscapes, animals, fruit, and flowers;
and it- would be difficult to decide in -which he most
excelled. Flanders, France, Italy, and England
abound with the admirable productions of
his pencil, Fxom his birth he had
evinced a lively, elevated, and universal
genius, and had enriched his mind with an extensive
and intimate acquaintance with history, poetry, and
the belles lettres. With the possession of such re-
sources, he invented with facility ; and his incessant
practice gave him an unexampled dexterity of exe-
cution, _ ... He did not, like Raffaelle, possess
that mild inspiration of sentiment which manifests
itself in the graceful and beautiful, but he was ani-
mated by that poetic fire that displays itself in effects
which astonish and surprise. Has most abundant
compositions seem to have been produced
without effort, and creation appears to have
been an operation of his will.? Of his
style it may be remarked that his drawing was
grand and facile, and all his outlines free and flowing.
His pictures are full of brilliant effects, and as a
colourist, in the Flemish School at all events, he
stands alone. Although Rubens studied the antique,
and was familiar with the works of Michel Angelo
and Raffaelle, he always preferred the unembellished
models of his own country?a defect particularly dis-
cernible in his female forms, which, however comely,
have seldom, if ever, any pretensions to elegance or
grace. The picture by this master in the Mona
Gallery, the sight of which has led us into these
observations, represents fouiteen large-sized figures
cavaliers and ladies at a fete champetre?a scene
such as Boccacio has vividly described in his Deca-
meron. The male figure in the rich scarlet cloak,
behind the female in white satin, is apparently endea-
vouring to catch the wandering eye of her companion.
Immediately before the lady in white, whose hand has
been grasped by a merry damsel in blue, is a hand-
some stout woman in black satin, rather roughly
called upon for support by her doughty lover,
who has slipped down on the grass, and there, for
some reason or other, seems likely to remain. The
contrast of the two robes of white and black satin is
absolutely marvellous. The right hand of the girl in
blue is held fast by a beautiful, bold, saucy creature
(in yellow satin, with a black hat and feather) com-
fortably lounging, like the spoiled pet of the whole
party, against the knees of a female friend, whose face
is turned elsewhere. Two couples, very agreeably
engaged, occupy the right hand corner of the picture,
and of these four figures, the attitude and half-pensive
expression of the semi-recumbent lady, are highly
suggestive. A flue, wide-spreading tree, at the back
ef the picture, overshadows this spirited group,
throwing out the landscape beyond into strong relief.
Across the campaign a city is discernible in the
distance. Such are the principal features of this
splendid painting, which, as we have already re-
marked, is from the collection of the Duke of Lucca.
(No. 34.) An Artists? Studio?Sculpture and Figures.
By Johann Platzer, 1750. This exquisite painting
(perfectly sui generis ) is supposed to represent the
studio of Michel Angelo, at once a sculptor and a
painter. Its style is extremely peculiar, ?and it is
finished with all the elaborate precision of a very
superior line engraving. There is a wonderful light-
ness, g ri ce, and harmony in all its details. The
careful and judicious management of the numerous
shades of grey, at the back, is something extraor-
dinary. This rare gem was painted by Johann Platzer,
a German artist of the last century, for whose pictures
there is a very great competition at sales. Some few
of them are to be found in the grand collections of
England and Germany, but they are by no means
common.
(No. 35.) Halt of Travellers, by Bamboccio. Bam-
boccio?s real name was Peter de Laer, and he was
born at Laaren in 1643. He was an imitator of
Wouvermans, and even excelled that master in the
energy of his touch; he was, however, not equal to
Wouvermans in the neatness and delicacy of his
pencil. Bamboccio died at Haarlem about ?the year
1674.
(No. 36.) The G udecca at Venice, by Guardi, 1712.
Francesco Guardi was a scholar of Canaletto, and,
like his instructor, excelled in painting architectural
viesvs of Venice By many good judges Guardi is
considered to have surpassed his master?tr e light,
spirited manner and pencilling of this artist being
considered superior to the elaborate finish of Canaletto.
His pictures, it is true, do not fetch, so high a price in
the market, but it is not unusually considered that
they exhibit more of the real artist. Of this the
visitor to Mona can himself be best judge. The skies
of Guardi, as it will be seen from this picture, are of a
different tint to those of Canaletto.
(37.) A Landscape with Figures, by Orizonti, of Ant-
werp, 1656. This is tUe companion picture to No. 25,
already described. It presents the same excellencies
and peculiarities of style.
(No. 38.) Interior of an Inn, Landlord casting-up the
score. This picture, of the Dutch school, is by J, De
Wett, of whom nothing is very certainly known.
(No. 39.) The Offerings of the Magi', by Jean Jou-
venet of Rouen, 1644. This painting is a very
charming exemplar of the French school; all the
figures on the left side of it, and at the back being
truly admirable?perhaps we may venture to say
faultless. The representation of the Blessed Virgin,
in particular, is eminently sweet and graceful; and
the child on its mother's knee in 'he foreground (in front
of the Infant Christ) is extremely beautiful?so much
so that the eye involuntarily rests upon it, again
and again; each time with a fresh accession of in-
terest. The head of the furthest of the three kings
also claims our favourable notice. The wise men,
however, are to say the least of it, presenting their
homage in. very uncomfortable positions. One of
them, in accordance with the finely suggestive old
tradition, is a man of colour. The scene is taking
place near the entrance of the rock-hewn stable of
Bethlehem, still in existence.
(No 40.) A Horse Fair, with numerous figures. By
Peter Wouvermans, younger brother and scholar of
Philip Wouvermans ; born at Haerlem, in 1625. In
this picture the men and horses are drawn in a very-
distinct and spirited style, and the perspective
of the background and of the distant country is
managed with consumate taste and skill, It is,
nevertheless, not difficult to distinguish the differ-
ence between the works of this eminent artist and
the inimitable productions of his brother Philip ; one
of whose pictures (No. 22) we have already described.
The sky in this excellent painting, although draped
with clouds, is of a brighter and more cheerful cha.
racter than that in the picture referred to.
(No. 41.) Nymphs Bathing. By Christian William
Ernest Dietrich. The modern German artist to
whom we are indebted for this little painting was
born at Weimar, in Saxony, in 1712. He was the
pupil of an artist of some account at that period,
named Thiele, and was much patronised by the Court
at Dresden, whence he proceeded to Rome and Venice
in 1742. As a colourist, Dietrich is considered
greatly to excel. The picture is elaborately finished, Jf
Three nymphs?perhaps it would be more correct to
say three shepherdesses?have brought their pastoral
charges to a retired spot, with a view to laving their
wearied limbs in the cool and limpid element. One
has already plunged merrily into the water, but her
exclamations have evidently made her sisters pause
before they can sufficiently nerve themselves for that
cold but invigorating shock.
(No. 42.) Landscape, with boats and figures on the ice.
By John Van Goyen, an old Dutch artist, born at
Leyden in 1596. He was one of the pupils of Esais
Vandervelde of Haerlem. Goyen painted landscapes
and views in Holland?generally taken on the banks
of rivers, with boats and figures, and a village in dis-
tance. His paintings are light and spirited ; some
finished with extreme care, and others obviously
?slashed off with undue haste. In this picture the
figures near the two pollards deserve the particular
attention of the visitor, who will also be pleased with
effect of the light in the cold and wintry sky.
(No. 43.) St Peter?s at Rome. Painted by Peter
Neefs (lire Elder) of Antwerp, where he was born in
1570. This celebrated architectural painter was a
scholar of Steenwyck, the Elder, and pourtrayed the

interiors and exteriors of churches and chapels with a

cessful in figures. He died, according to Balkema, in
1651. Since this picture was painted there have been
some considerable alterations and improvements in the
space here forming the foreground
(No. 44.) The Magdalen in the Desert , from the
V / Northwick Collection. By Pietro Francesco Mola, an
Y eminent Italian painter and imitator of Titian, born
,/ \ at Coldra, in the Milanese territory, in the year 1699.
? He was first a pupil under D?Arpino at Home, and
subsequently he became a scholar of Francesco
i D?Albano at Bologna. After passing some time in
* Venice, where he studied the best masters of the
Venetian school, he returned to Home, and was there
employed by Popes Innocent the Tenth and Alex-
ander the Seventh in painting sacred historical sub-
jects. Mola ranks as a distinguished historical painter,
and is also famed for his landscapes. His scenery
is often solemn and sublime, and when his sites are
pleasing (as in the picture before us), they are
wrought out with a grandeur which is hardly sur-
passed by the best productions of Caracci and Dome-
nichino. _ The penitent woman reclines in the fore-
ground in an easy attitude, comforted by angelic
visitants,- which may be supposed to represent the
return, of happier and less desponding thoughts. In
the background are the trees and shrubs of a pathless
forest, wrapped in a deep, warm, tranquilising gloom,
?from which, and from the fading tints of the sky,
it is obvious that the time is that ot a soft summer
evening. The foreshortening of the figure of Mary
demands our unqualified admiration. Her face has a
sweet, and thoughtfuPair, and is turned away towards
the descending cheiubs: all of which are
painted in with a lightness, and softness,
and ease which immediately arrests the eye. The
knees, breast, and arms ot the Maadalen are ex-
quisitely drawn,_ and the colouring of the flesh is that
ot life itself. It is, probably, this last circumstance
which has induced some to contend that this picture
. . , **? mcm ima jjiuiu.it;
is from the pencil of Titian. Such, however, is not
the case. It was painted by Mola, one of the most
distinguished followers of that eminent master. Cut

(No. 45.) Virgin with Infant Jesus, Jc.hn the
Baptist, hiizaheth, and Zachariah. By Andrea del
~ j ) oy ah area aei
Sarto, an Italian painter, bom at Florence in 1488.
This painter usually employed his pencil on sacred
subjects, and especially in delineating Holy Families
and Madonnas with the Infant Jesus and St. John.
Some of his works are in the Louvre, and many more
in Italy. His designs are considered to partake of
the style of Michel Angelo, but to be wanting in the
sublime and fiery energy which animates the composi-
tions of great master. The heads of
Del Sarto?s Madonnas are rather pretty than
beautiful, with expressions generally characterised
with all the formality of mere portraits.
This is decidedly the case with the face of the Blessed
Virgin in this picture. Ihe infant John the Baptist
is presenting to the Holy Child an offering of flowers.
His mother, Elizabeth, and his father, Zachariah, are
looking on with devout humility. Two cherubs are
introduced at the top of the picture, holding up a
canopy over the heads'of St. Mary and her Son.
(No. 46.) St. Jerome at his devotions. By Andrea
... V Martegna. Padua, 1431, This picture, a curiou-
/\ specimen of the old Gothic style, is valuable as exem-
plifying the immense progress which has been made
in the noble art of painting. Martegna?s rigid adhe-
rence to the antique?to what w'as archaic even in his
� day appears to have seduced him into a most pal-
pable neglect of nature, and of that animated expres-
sion she alone affords. The emblematical Lion,
appropriated to St. Jerome in Christian iconography,
is _ represented crouching near the feet of the aged
saint. This very quaint and valuable exemplar of? an
ancient master is from the collection of the late Lord
Northwick.
(No, 47.) The Flight into Egypt. By Filippo Bellini.
This exquisite painting represents the Blessed Virgin
and the child Jtsus (older than usually drawn for such
a time) in the foreground. Behind them is the venera-
able figure ot St. Joseph, whose head is very finely
painted. The light is beautifully thrown upon the
group. Although comparatively unnoticed in the
history of Art, Bellini was possessed of an uncommon
"? wvw 7 aociuiu vvao jJUEOCfc&tfU U1 ail UU CO IB 111 Oil
capacity. He was a follower of the style of Fedrigo
Baroccio. He was born at IJrbino, and flourished
about the year 1594.
(No. 48.) St Jen me at Prayer in a Jjandscape, By
Pietro Francesco Mola. 1699. [From the North-
wicK Collection.] The stern and learned old ascetic
is here represented in the foreground of a wild and
secluded spot, with the symbolical Lion usually ap-
propriated to this father. For a brief notice of Mola
' see No. 44.
f fNo. 49.) The Benevolent Lawyer. By Peter Breughel
the elder, born at Breughel, near Breda, in 1510.
Peter Breughel the elder (called ?the droll ?) was
fond of delineating such subjects as here represented.
He died in 1570. The humour of the picture appears
to arise out of the fact that the lawyer (unlike many
in his profession) gives his advice gratis, or, at all
events, on very easy terms. The result of course is,
that he has many eager clients, who come and supnly
themselves to their hearts? content with law. The
varying expressions of the different faces of these
miserable men are generally very graphically repre-
sented. StiH4t4e not a pleasing picture. * ,
(No. 50.) The Annunciation. By Francesco
.Florence, 1477. This painting, in the pre-Raphaelite,
fcr early Italian style, represents the sublime mystery
of the Annunciation. The Virgin, contrary to the
more common design, is represented as standing?the
angel Gabriel kneeling before her with the emblema-
tical li'y in his left hand, the right being raised as
if to Despeak attention? To the left is another angel
standing in an attitude of devotion. Above this last
figure is the form of a man intended to typify the
Great Creator, with an aureole and
cherubim. The Heavenly Dove?symbolical of the
Third Person of the Trinity, and emitting threefold
rays of glory?is also represented as hovering near the
futu- e Mother of the Messiah. It is remarkable that all
the figures here depicted, except one, have red hair.
The prospect at the back of the picture is extremely stiff
?And-tbrmah Francesco Granacci was a fellow student
with Michel Angelo Buonaroti under Domenico
Ghirlandajo. He lived on terms of intimacy with
that great artist, to whose friendship and judicious
counsel he was doubtless much indebted for the
success he was enabled to achieve. He died in the
year 1544, aged sixty-seven years.
(No. 51.) Judgment of Oambyses, or the Unjust
Judge, from the Bernal Collection. * A signed picture,
of which the replica is in the Academy of Bruges.
This is undoubtedly an original production of-
Anthony Claessens. an eminent Dutch painter, born at
Bruges in 1650. The faces in this picture are evi-
dently. all portraits, so carefully and elaborately
finished as to merit a very close inspection. Anthony
Claessens was a follower ofthe Van Eyck school, and
is said to have been a pupfi of Quintin Matsys, the
? Blacksmith of Antwerp.?
(No. 52.) Mount Parnassus, by Giulio Romano,
Rome, 1492. [From the Northwick Collection.! This
painting represents Apollo and the Muses, accom-
panied by a number of other figures, said to be in-
tended for immortalised poets. The family-name of
this great master was Pippi, but he is universally
kt ow by the appellation of Giulio Romano. He was
one of the most distinguished disciples of the schoobof
Raffaelle ; after the death of whom he was employed
by Leo the Tenth, and Clement the Seventh, to assist
in finishing the History of Constantine for the Vatican.
There is apparently in the painting now under con-
sideration, somewhat of that confusion of light and
-shadow which has been attributed to the productions

(No. 53.) The Saviour as a Pilgrim, by Giovanni
Batista Tiepolo. Venice, 1697. This fine painting?
tha-first on the eastern wall of the Gallery at Mona?
is in the Paul Veronese style, and is so admirable as a
work of art, that some have even doubted whether it
was not actually one of the productions of that eminent
master. There seems, however, no reason to raise
any question as to the tact of its being properly
attributed to Tiepolo : it was distinctly ascribed to that
painter whilst it formed part of the great Northwick
Collection. The Redeemer, clad as a Pilgrim, appears
in it between the figure of St. John the Evangelist,
and that of a mounted warrior?probably St. Martin
of Tours, as he is severing his cloak in twain with his
sword, for the purpose of clothing a beggar, Angels
are depicted in the upper part of the picture?one
bearing the Sacred Volume, another alnartyr?s crown
and palm, and the third an episcopal mitre. This
painting deserves particular notice. Tiepolo was one
of the most eminent painters of the Venetian School.
He was a pupil of Gregorio Lazzarini, After having
given convincing proofs of his genius in Milan, and
other cities in Italy, he went by the invitation of the
King of Spain to Madrid, where he died in 1770.
(No. 54.) A Madonna and Child, with Book. By
Giovanni Batista Salvi, commonly called II Sasso-
ferrata, from a castle of that name near Urbino, where
he was born in the year 1605, His pictures generally
represent the Virgin and Child, and very seldom does
he venture on more complicated subjects. Though
incapable of the embodiment of that ideal
beauty with which the Panagia has been identified
by the Greeks, Sassoferrato?s representation of the
Virgin has a peculiarly appropriate style of coun-
tenance, in which an air of humility predominates.
The simplicity of the dress and the attire of the head
correspond with the meek expression of the features
without lessening the dignity of their character. The
face of the Divine Child bears a strong resemblance to
that of the Holy Mother, and is peculiarly soft and
beautiful Indeed, the whole figure of Jesus is

(No. 55.) Our Saviour Rebuking Martha, by Gaspar
de Grayer. Antwerp, 1582. This large and splendid
picture, from the collection of Lord North wick repre-
sents the reproof administered by Our Lord to
Martha, when she complained oi the conduct of Maty
who sat listening to the words of the Redeemer
instead of going to the assistance of her
sister. (St. Luke x., 38-42.) Grayer was a
follower, but not a pupil of Rubens, who, with his
usual frank generosity, willingly bore testimony to
his singular talent. Many Flemish biograpners have
not hesitated to place this estimable artist on a level
witn that master, and Van Dyck. Although such a
compliment may possibly be something overstrained
Grayer is undoubtedly entitled to rank next after
them, among the ablest artists of that great school.
? His compositions,? says Bryan, ? are learned and
judicious; rejecting everything of superfluity and
ostentation, he attached himself to the higher facul-
ties of correctness and simplicity. Less daring than
Rubens, he is always correct; and although he never
soared to the flight of that aspiring genius, his works
evince both grandeur and dignity. His colouring is
chaste and tender, resembling in his carnations the
clear tinting of Van Dyck.? Gaspar de Grayer died
in 1669. In this picture the figure of the Saviour oc-
cupies a midmost place. Martha, appealing to our
Lord, stands at his right hand. Her sister Mary, a
sweet, meek-eyed blonde, is listening with a timid
downcast look.
(No. 56.) The Adoration of the Magi. By Jan
Mabuse Hainault, 1470, This artist was one of the
first who attempted to improve upon the dry, formal
style which had been prevalent before his day. His
colouring is fresh and pure, his designs as correct as
those of Albert Durer, and much in the
style of that master. His works, however,
as will be seen from the picture now-
adverted to, retain a certain gothic stiffness,
which is not attractive to the modern eye. Of the
three traditional kings, one, as usual, is a negro. The
right hand of the Saviour is extended in an attitude
of benediction. The figure of the Virgin is more
pleasing than dignified. This ancient master died at
Antwerp in 1532, in the sixty-seeond year of hig age.
ihe authenticity of this valuable painting is attested
by the fact of its having formed part of the Northwick
Collection.
(No. 57.) The Holy Family. By Pietro Buonacorsi
commonly called Pieiino Del Vaga, from the circum-
stance of his having been instructed in his art and
brought to Rome by a painter of that name He was
also the pupil of Ridolfo Ghirlandajo, and has been
ranked by some as @ne of the most distinguished dis-
ciples ot Raffaelle. Del Vaga was highly esteemed
by his contemporaries, and was employed with Giulio
Romano and Giovanni Francesco Penni in finishing the
great works of the Vatican. He died at Rome in 1547.
The paintings by this artist in Mr. Smart?s collection
represents the Blessed Virgin in a sitting posture
with trm Saviour and St. John the Sep list in her
arms. The countenance of St. Mary is replete with
thoughtful and ideal beauty.
(No. 58.) The Virgin and Child with Saints. This
painting is a most interesting specimen of the Greek
school, from the Northwick Collection. Judging
from the inscription on the lower portion of�the
frame, it probably once formed part of an altar-piece
in some place of worship belonging to the Western or
Latin Church. The words Ave Maria, &c., in ancient
characters, are there plainly distinguishable. The
painting, however, is certainly Greek, probably one of
these relics of Byzantine art brought from the Levant
to Venice, in the palmy days of that great maritime
republic The Panagia is represented crowned, and
still further distinguished by a broad circular nimbus.
She wears a stiff, highly embroidered robe, shaped
not unlike a chasuble. One of the four saints on
either side of her is a female figure crowned with
flowers,_ Opposite to whom is St. Peter. The three
male saints have books in their hands. Two angels
are kneeling in front, and the two principal personages
are inclosed in what is termed by archaeologists the
Vesicular Nimbus. The glory round the head of the
infant Jesus is signalised as apart from that of his
mother from the fact of its being intersected by a
cruciform ornament. The Holy Child is also further
distinguished by a cross incised on the right breast.
(No. 59.) The Virgin surrounded by angels, ?by
Albano. Bologna, 1578. (See No. 18.). In this


charming painting is depicted the Virgin seated on a
ihrone amidst the clouds, and surrounded with angels.
The principal figure is represented in an attitude of
devout adoration, the cherubic forms around her
being freely and gracefully drawn.
(No 60.) Portraits of two Saints, painted on a go'd
background, and ornamented in relief. By Jacobello
del Fiore of Venice, 1401. This ancient and curious
painting is from the great North wick Collection. It
presents two distinct figures ? Sanctvs Pavlvs,? and
? Sanctvs Sirivs.? St. Paul is painted with his
sword and book, and is clothed in blue and crimson.
The expression of his face is very fine. The other
saint is a bishop with mitre, crozier, and highly
embroidered chasuble. He wears also the oeno-
phorium, or oriental pallium, crossed after the manner
of the Greeks, and has a book in his
right hand. Jacobello Del Fiore was born to-
wards the close of the fourteenth century, and
flourished between 1401 and 1436, Few artists of
that age equalled him in his powers of imparting a
certain grace and dignity to his figures, in which
there is an unusual amount of ease and vigour. He
would, of course, appear to more advantage in these
days if his figures were less loaded with ornaments,
and if his draperies and backgrounds were not set off
with gold, after the traditional fashion of Byzantine
artists.
(No. 61) Shepherd Boy, Young shepherdess, Lady, and
Landscape. By Govaert Flink. Cleves, 1614
Besides the shepherd boy and little shepherdess, there
is, in this picture, a lady?probably a huntress, as
she wears a quiver, and is attended by dogs. The lad
and the girl are evidently somewhat abashed at the
presence of their visitor, whom they appear to have>
been just supplying with water from the streamlet
Flink was a pupil of the school of Rembrandt, and,-
with the singular advantage of that master?s instruc-
tion,* became one of the ablest disciples of that
eminent colourist. The compositions of this painter
are admired for their sobriety, and purity of colouring,
and their studied and highly judicious arrangement.
Flink, who was a successful, industrious, and much-
appreciated artist, died at Amsterdam, in 1660.
(No. 62.) A holy Family, by Federigo Baroccio.
Urbino, 1528. The Virgin in this painting is repre-
sented kneeling before the infant Saviour, the little
St. John being supported by an angel: St, Joseph
and a distant landscape in the background. Baroccio
was an imitator of Coreggio, and succeeded in giving
a graceful air to his figures, although it must be con -
fessed that his works are not to be placed in compe-
tition with those of the master whom he selected as
his model. Baroccio died at Urbino in 1612.
(No, 63.) The Circumcision, by Michael Wohlge-
muth, born at Nuremburgh in 1434. This painter
flourished very soon after the rise of art in Germany,
and is, of course, distinguished by all the marks of
that cold, dry, Gothic style which characterised the
ancient German school. The picture, nevertheless,
contains some good figures (for example, that of the
Virgin), but their due effect is materially counter-
acted by the gilded background. Considering the
era in which he lived Wohlgemuth was a good
painter. He died in 1519, at the great age of eighty
five years.
(No. 64) The Salutation?a pair representing the
Virgin and the Angel Gabriel. By Tomaso Stefano, a
disciple of Giotto. Florence, 1324. These two com-
panion pictures (hung beside the Large Picture by
Ludovico Caracci, at the western end of the gallery)
although archaic in treatment and design, are very
beautiful. The face of St. Mary is extremely good,
full of calm self-devotion, modesty, and dignity.
The pair are unquestionably the oldest pictures
in this collection, and doubtless in this colony.
They form a valuable exemplar of the style of
this ancient Italian master, usually styled II Flo-
rentine from the place of his birth. _ Stefano was the
grandson and disciple of Giotto. He was born at
Florence in 1301, and, according to Vasari, soon
learned to excel his instructor in every department
of art. He has the credit of having first established
the rules of perspective (before his time but little
known) upon regular and well defined principles.
He is likewise remarkable for having been the first
painter who strove to overcome the difficulties of
foreshortening , and he also succeeded, beyond
all his contemporaries, in giving expression
to the airs of his heads, and a less
gothic turn to the attitudes of his figures.
The works of this old master are extremely rare and
valuable. This pair came from the collection of Lord
Northwick. Stefano died in the year 1350.
(No ; 66) The Assumption of the Virgin. By Jacopo
Pacchiarotti of Siena, where he flourished about the
year 1535. The Virgin?seated in a Vesicular Aureole
with her hands raised in a devotional attitude?is
rising out of her tomb, beside which two saints are
kneeling,?St. Peter and St. John the Evangelist
The principal figure is surrounded by numerous
angels, and at the top of the picture the Supreme Being
extends a crown over her head. On either side of this
last figure are the Souls of the Redeemed. The faces and
forms of the cherubic angels are finely painted, and so
is the figure of the Blessed Virgin. The expression of
h-r face, however, is not so pleasing. The artist of
this picture was first an of Pietro Perugino,
bat he afterwards greatly improved his style by
studying the admirable productions of RafFaelle.
Pacchiarotti died in France?where he worked for
some time in conduction with II Hosso, or The Red
Master. This picture is also from the Great North-
wick Collection.
(Ns. 66.) The Virgin and Child with two Angels.
By Andrea Verocchio of Florence, 1432. This old
painting (from the Northwick Collection) represents
St. Mary and the Divine Infant seated in front of a
stone parapet, behind which stand two angels in
adoration. Notwithstanding a rather disadvantageous
air of antiquity, this is unquestionably a fine picture,
and merits an attentive consideration. The figure of
the Blessed Virgin (despite of a stiffness which
appears to have been characteristic of the period) is
instinct with quiet, thoughtful dignity, and maternal
tenderness. The mystery before the angels is evident
by something that they desire to contemplate, and do
not clearly understand. Verocchio had the honour of
numbering amongst his pupils the renowned Leonardo
di Vinci and Pietro Perugino. He was the first artist
who made moulds of the human form to aid him as
models of design. He died in 1488. �w
( (No. 67.) Christ?s Cnarge to Peter, by Ludevsto'
Xlarocci?considered one of his best works From the
Northwick Collection. ?This large and magnificent
picture is one of the first object that arrest the eye of
tWvisitor to the Mona Gallery. It illustrates the com-
.n/and of the Saviour to Saint Peter?? Feed my
pdieep.? (St. John xxi., 17.) Our Lord stands in
front of three of the apostles, one of whom is the
beloved disciple, Saint John. He points emphatic-
ally with his forefinger to a chalice, from the top of
which issues the Eucharistal Bread. The cup is ex-
tended toward the group by an angel. St Peter has
sunk down on his knees in adoration ; his
whole face being expressive of the deepest
humility, and the most absolute self-devo-
tion. A portion of some public edifice is
visible in the background. It would be presumptuous
to attempt to point out all the beauties of this master
piece ; the calm majesty of the Redeemer, the
familiar and affectionate, but yet reverential air of
the figure of St. John, and the solemn and earnest
humility of the Princeps Apostolorum, at once rebuked,
and for ever after distinguised. Let the visitor pause
before this grand painting, and himself judge of all
this, and much more besides. This great master ?
Ludovico Caracci?the founder of the school which
has immortalised the name of his family, was born at
Bologna, in 1555, and died in 1619. He consulted
nature, we are informed, in everything, at the same time
that he carefully studied all the works of the painters
of that day. It is not surprising, therefore, that, gifted
as he was with a rare genius, he should have attained
to what the best judges of the art have considered
nearly to approach perfection. ? His breadth of light
and shadow,? says Sir Joshua Reynolds, ? the sim-
plicity of his colouring, and the solemn effect of that
twilight that seems diffused over his pictures, is better
suited to the grave and dignified subjects he generally
treated of than the more artificial brilliancy of sun-
shine which enlightens the pictures of Titian.? The
truth of these observations will be acknowledged by
those who attentively contemplate this picture, which
we leave them to do, ?inviting them in so doing to
take particular notice of the masterly colouring of the
robe of the Saviour, and the artistic drawing of all
the hands.
(No. 68.) Saint Catherine. By Bernardino Luini.
Milanese States, 1480. Luini, or Lovino, is considered
to have been one of the most distinguished scholars of
Leonardo di Vinci, to whose productions his works
very nearly approach,?the same taste in design, the
same peculiarity of colour and relief, being common to
both. Several pictures often attributed to Di Vinci
are from the pencil of this eminent master. The
date of his death is uncertain, but he was
living in 1530. The painting to which we
have now come in the gallery represents
the upper portion of the form of the virgin
saint, ruthlessly deprived of clothing?the want of
which she modestly attempts to hide, regardless of
her impending martyrdom on the wheel. The face
and figure are exquisitely painted?a happy smile of
innocence, of faith, and of hope irradiates her lovely
countenance.
(69.) Saints at their Devotion, by Lucas Kranach.
German. 1472. The real name of this ancient German
master-called Kranach, or Cranach, from the place
of his birth?was Sunder. His works are extremely
dispersed, especially in the Saxon States. They exer-
cised a considerable influence upon art, and were
imitated by many who came after him. One
of the saints appears to be St. Joseph of
Nazareth. He carries a lily in his left hand, and lays
his right on the shoulder of some inferior ecclesiastic.
Behind St. Joseph is the figure of some mediaeval
monastic saint, with his breviary and his beads. An
altar bov stands, in a devotional attitude, by the
side of the monk. Kranach died in 1553.
(No. 70.) Landscape and Ruins of an Ancient Am-
phitheatre with Buildings, By Henry Van Lint.
Antwerp, 1670. The sky, trees, and perspective of
this picture are deserving of much commendation.
There is an unusual clearness and precision ip, all
its various details. Henry Van Lint, called Studio, f '
painted numerous landscapes. He flourished towards
the close of the seventeeth century.
(No. 71.) Christ at Emmaus, by Rubens, Antwerp,
1577. This noble painting, by the Greatest Flemish
Master, illustrates the apparition of Our Lord to the
disciples at Emmaus. ?As he sat at meat with them
he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to
them. And their eyes were opened and they knew
him ? (St. Luke xxiv., 30, 31.) The two disciples
are at table with the Redeemer, One has just re-
cognized his Divine Master, and already uncovers his
head in reverential homage. The? same great

(No. 72.) The Annunciation, by Murillo, from Lord
Northwick's Collection. The Virgin, clad in robes of
blue and purple, is kneeling at her devotions, having
near her the Emblematical Lily. The angel kneels on
a cloud behind her, and announces to the Maid of
Galilee the purpose of the Supreme. Three cherubs
are introduced in the upper part of the picture,?one
of whom (in blue) is remarkable for its
infantine grace and beauty. The principal figure
appears to be confused, as if she were casting in her
mind as to what manner of salutation that could
be just addressed to her by Gabriel. The
light is splendidly thrown from the back of the
picture. Bartolome Estevan Murillo is noted for the
originality of his style ; and his compositions are dis-
tinguished for their close and lively imitation of
nature. His forms have a national peculiarity of air,
habiliment, and countenance. There is little of the
academy discernible in his design or composition; it is
chaste and faithful representation of what he saw
or conceived?truth and simplicity being never lost
sight of. His colouring is clear, tender, and har-
monious, ?with a portrait-like simplicity in the airs of
the heads, in which there is seldom much of the ideal.
He may be said to hold a middle rank between the
unpolished naturality of the Flemish, and the grace-
ful and elegant taste of the Italian school, Murillo
died in 1685, in the seventy-second year of his age, at
Cadiz.
(N�, 73.) The Roly Family resting in Egypt. By
Bartolommeo Schedone. Born at Modena in 1560.
This painting represents the Virgin Mary, Joseph,
and the Infant Jesus resting in Egypt. Mary,
clothed in red and blue (with a white veil) and
reclining against a block of masonry, holds in her lap
the Blessed Child who has fallen asleep. The mother is
fondly contemplating her Son, who has, as if uncon-
sciously, placed his little hand on the upper portion
of her dress. Joseph with his back against a tree,
is sitting near them reading. There is a pyramid in
the background. Some have supposed that Schedone
was brought up under the Caracci, but it is remark-
able that his productions exhibit very scanty
resemblance to the style which characterises
that distinguished school. He rather appears
to have formed his ideas from a close
study of the works of Raffaelle and Coreggio,?
particularly the latter, with whose productions he
was constantly surrounded. His favourite studies
were Madonnas and Holy Families. He died in 1616.
?No follower of Coreggio,? says Bryan, ?ever ap-
proached so near him in the graceful and expressive
airs of his heads, and the elegant turn of his figures.

Schedoni is supposed to have died in 1616, or there-
abouts.
(INo. 74.) The Nativity, by Peter Mignard?usually a]
called ?Mignard the Roman??born at Troyes in ai
mo. This very phasing picture formed part of the si
great North wick Collection, until it was purchased by so
Mr. Smart. The Heavenly Babe is represented as th
lying upon a manger, beside which his mother (in a -&
light red robe, with a blue hood or veil) kneels, pre - su
senting the infant to the view of the shep- to
herds and other country people, who are T)
reverentially approaching. The figure of
Mary is full of quiet grace, simplicity, and tenderness. 16
A brilliant, supernatural light is thrown upon the 26
figures at the back. Peter Mignard was originally go
intended for the profession of physic, but soon Gj
abandoning his medical studies,' he devoted st;
himself entirely to painting, and shortly wl
achieved a very signal success in that pursuit of
Having first been one of the scholars of John Boucher
(an artist of some reputation at Bourges), he next
became a pupil of Simon Youet at Paris', and he sub- ?'
sequently proceeded to the Eternal City, where he ha
resided for twenty-two years?thereby acquiring the rig
title of Mignard the Roman. He applied himself to sta
the studious contemplation of the works of Raffaelle hai
and Annibale Caracci,?particularly those of the am
former, whose graceful and dignified style he imitated boi
m his pictures of the Virgin, all of which were greatly ces
admired at Rome. Mignard was warmlv patronized gol
by the Roman Pontiffs from Urban YIH. to Alex- lin
ander YIL, and returned to Paris at the express in- lefi
invitation of Louis the Fourteenth. He left behind sty
him several fine pictures both in Rome and in Paris. Ma

appears to have been a man of a singularly morose
and quarelsome temperament, but was of high con-
sideration as an historical painter,?so much so that
some have even favourably compared his works with
those of his master, the great Guido. It is a curious
fact that as a portrait painter he was altogether un-
successful. Cantarini?s works as an engraver are to
to this day very greatly esteemed. He died in 1648,

(No. 79.) Two Saints, by Francesco Francia. Bo-
logna. 1450. This picture contains only two figures,
?one of St. Francis (in his appropriate monastic
habit, with a lily in his left hand and a book in his
right, and the other that ot St. John the Baptist,
standing behind, having that cross-tipped staff in his
hand with which he is generally depicted. The
ancient Italian master who produced this work was
born at Bologna, in 1450, his real name being Fran-
cesco Raibolini. In his early 11 e he was an eminent
goldsmith and medallist, but those callings he re-
linquished for that branch of art ot which he has here
left us an excellent specimen. He first painted in the
style of Perugino, and, subsequently, more in that of
Martegna. This painting appears to be in his earlier
style. Francia?s good taste and judgment as an artist
were highly esteemed by Raffaelle, who is even stated
by some to have profited by the productions of this
old master. He died in the' year 1518.
(No. 80.) Landscape and Figures. By J. Breughel.
Brussels, 1565. John Breughel (to whom the name
of Velvet Breughel was given on account of his being
generally clothed in velvet, in his day a very expen-
sive article) was first only a successful painter of
flowers and fruit, but after visiting Italy he changed
his subjects, painting landscapes with small figures,
correctly drawn, and touched with considerable finesse
and spirit. His landscapes indeed were so much
admired even by Rubens that he was requested to
paint them in the background of many of the easel
pictures of that master. It this painting it is observ-
able that there are numerous flowers introduced in
the foreground, and several small-sized figures. The
vista of a long avenue of green trees and verdant
lawns is here effectively reproduced, but the exact
nature of the subject is not so evident. Breughel
died at Brussels (his native city) in 1642, at the age
of seventy-seven years.
(No. 81) A Marine Piece, with shipping, boats, �c.
By Abraham Stork. Amsterdam, 1650. This is a fine
sea piece, in which several large, old-fashioned vessels,
under the Dutch flag, are resting on a tranquil
expanse of water?probably intended for a portion of
the Amstel, near the native city of the artist. Stork
was a neat and spirited painter ; his pictures of this
particular description are always ingeniously grouped,
and the vessels and their rigging are drawn, as the
spectator will observe, with perfect precision and ac-
curacy. His colouring is clear and transparent?his
skies and water, light and floating. The death of
Stork is said by some to have taken place in 1708 :
others, however, have stated that he did not die until
about four or five years later.
jr (No. 82) An Interior : Boors Smoking. By Ostade.
Lubeck, 1610. This picture represents three merit/
fsmokmg,?discussing, at the same time, some knotty 1
point about cards. Adrian Yan Ostade studied his
art at Haarlem, under Francis Hals, with Brower, and
like that artist, acquired a brilliant reputa-
tion by the representation of subjects like
this now under notice. His colouring is
clear rich, and glowing, and it is evident
that he was perfectly acquainted with the principles
ot chiaro scnro. His pencil also is light and delicate
and his touch spirited and free. Ostade died at
Amsterdam in 1685.

Van Helmont. Brussels, 1650. This picture is of the r
same character as Nos. 82 and 83. Van Helmont was V
a scholar of the younger Teniers, and painted pictures
analogous to those of that master. His works were
ir by Louis XIY,, for whom he painted several
of his best pictures. He died in 1719,

Brussels, 1613. In this large and excellent painting
the artist has spiritedly depicted a shady spot, not far
from some cliffs, with large umbrageous trees here and
there in the foreground. Not less than eighteen female NT
figures, of peculiar grace and beauty, are introduced N /
carrying baskets of flowers to the Temple of Flora.? y
There is an admirably-painted perspective view of
buildings, woods, and water, in the distance The �
figures, as usual in the landscapes of Artois have
been introduced by the younger Teniers. Artois C*T
who is said to have been a scholar of John Wildens? '
accurately represented the fields and forests in the
neighbourhood of Brussels, and was highly suc-
cessful in his skies, his distances, and the foliage of
his trees. He died in 1665.
(No. 86.) Two Female Figures. Bv Agnese Dolei
� lorence, 17th century. These two figur. s represent
an Allegory of Music: one has a small harp in her
hand, the other a Pan?s reed. Agnese Dolci was the
daughter of the eminent master, Carlo Dolci and
arrived at some degree of excellence, but she never
approached her father. f
(No. 87.) A Sleeping Cupid. This picture repre-
sents a fine baby fast asleep on a cushion, unencum-
bered with clothing. It is painted after Guido [ Rerul
an eminent Italian master, who was born at Bologna
in 1575, and died in the same city in 1642. 3
(No, 88.) A Dutch Interior. By an unknown
artist. This is a pleasant, cheerful picture. Two women
and a man are seated at a table in a courtyard. A
boor is seen smoking in the background.
(No. 89.) An Oyster Girl. By Metzu, of Leyden
16!o. The principal figure is drawn in an eas-� sd i
spirited style, and all the accessories are well wrought . I
out. Thisis a very charming specimen of the Dutch \ I
school?life-like,but not vulgar. Gabrid Metzu was \ /
a pupil of Gerard Terburg, but he eventually sur- \
rvaSfiPfl that orfiot in /-� _1 ? 1/
j . ... , cvcuiuauy sur-
passed that artist m the softness of his pencilling and
the elegance of his design. At an early period he
went to reside at Amsterdam, where his works soon
rose into the highest estimation. Less laboured than
the productions of Gerard Douw and Mieris his
works excel theirs in lightness and spirit of touch /
and harmony and chasteness of colouring. He minted/
always on a small scale, but it is not too much to say
that his style may be compared to that of Van Dyck
in his correct drawing of head and hand, in the deli
cae y of his flesh tints, and in the facility of his pen-
cil. Metzu, who was an industrious artist, died in
the prime of his life in 1669.
(No. 90.) Hawking Scene and Shipping. Bv Albert
Cuyp Dort 1606. In this large picture there is a
fine effect of sunlight, and a long vista of perspective
at the end of which are some shipping and glimpse of
the sea. Cavaliers and a lady, who have apparently
been out hunting and hawking, are standing in the
foreground, with a steep bank or rock behind them
Aibert Cuyp, or Kuyp, was the son and pupil of
Jacob Gerntze Cuyp. His pictures not unfrequentlv
represent the borders of the Maes River, with figures
as here, drawn in the foreground. Such subjects he
treated with an enchanting simplicity that may be
said to be peculiar to himself. Whatever time or
state of weather he chose to depict, nature was always
faithfully reproduced. No painter ever surpassed this
artist in the purity of his aerial tints. Besides all
this, we can see in this painting an admirable harmony
/of colour, and an undoubted success in both water
and sky. The pictures of Cuyp now fetch enormous
prices. It is not known when this master died but
he was living in 1672. ?
(No. 91.) Jacob and Rachel. By Henry Verschuring
of Gorcum, 1627, In this fine painting the strong and
sinewy figure of Jacob appears in the foreground
near a well surmounted by masonry. The patriarch
is laboriously engaged in drawing water for the flocks
of Laban. On the right is Rachel with hf-r father?s
cattle and sheep. The sky is dark and gloomv, and
the effects of the picture are more solemn and im-
posing than might have been surmised from the nature
of the subject. Verschuring was first a pupil of
Theodore Govertz, and afterwards pursued his studies
under John Both at Utrecht. He visited Rome,


Florence, and Venice, where he made great progress
in his art. He returned to Holland, where his works
were much appreciated, and died there at Dort,
much respected and esteemed, both as an artist and
as a man, in the year 1690, in the sixty-third year of
his age.
(No. 92.) A Composition of Fruit with a Parrot. By
James Bogdane. Pesth, 1669. This is a large picture,
and well painted. The artist was a Hungarian by
birth, employed by Queen Anne as a painter ot fowls,
flowers, and fruit. Some of his pictures are said to
be still in the royal collection. He died in the year
1720.
(No. 93 ) The Mater Dolorosa. By Cento Guercino.
1590. An exquisite exemplar of the numerous
Madonnas producted by the brilliant pencil of this
eminent Italian artist, who was born at Cento, in the
territory of Ferrara, in 1590. His real name was
Giovanni Francesco Barbieri, but he is never spoken
of in the history of art by any appellation except that
which he thought proper to assume. Like many
other great artists he had more than one style, the
second being distinguished from the first by a grander
and more elevated taste in design. Towards the
latter portion of his life he became an imitator of
Guido. The upturned face of the Suffering Mother
is exquisitely sweet in expression, and the hand is
beautifully drawn. This laborious artist left an
almost incredible number of drawings after him. He
died in 1666.
(No. 94). An Ecce Homo. By Luis Morales,
Badajos, 1509. Morales, called El Divtn
received that name from his constant choice of devout
subjects, and from the beauty of his pencil. His
pictures generally represent the head of the Man of
Sorrows, crowned with thorns, or that of the Sorrow-
ing Mother. Like all the heads painted by this great
Spanish artist, this splendid picture is of an admirable
and touching character, finished with the greatest
care, and exhibiting the extremity of human suffering.
In the delineation of the two subjects (to which he
almost wholly confined his genius) Morales is rightly
considered to have carried his art to the highest pos-
sible perfection. Stilly if-we might venture to hazard
the remark, it nevertheless does seem to us that in
this face there is an ideal something-wanting. It is the
head of a suffering, much enduring man alone, with-
out the trace of anything superior to human nature.
But this, of course, ia a mere matter of taste and
opinion.
(No. 95.) The Market Cart , hy Thomas Gainsborough,
R.A., Suffolk, 1727. The horse and loaded cart from
which this large and splendid picture takes its name,
are on the point of passing through a shallow pool,
extending across a road, overshadowed with trees.
A young woman and girl have seated themselves on
the vehicle, and two boys and a dog are walking
leisurely along beside it. In the foreground, to the
left, are other figures seated, with another dog ; and, to
the right, in the middle ground, is a youth collecting
firewood. A similar composition by the same great
/ English master, and now in the National Gallery, has
been engraved by the Associated Engravers. ' This
painting (from Lord Northwick?s collection at Thirie-
/? stane House) is a truly admirable exemplar of the best
manner of Gainsborough, his first being simply in imita-
tion of that ofVVynant?s,?a good specimen of which is
furnished in No. 13 of the Mona collection, to which
attention has already been directed. In this, his later,
and thoroughly original style, Gainsborough ill be
found to deserve all the glowing commendations
which have been lavished upon him. It is in his
chaste, picturesque delineation of an English land-
scape ?a home-view such as this?in his domestic
scenery, with groups of cottage children, husband-
men, horses, and cattle ?and, above all, in the
charmingly characteristic simplicity of his execution
and design as a whole that the merit of Thomas
Gainsborough is so peculiarly conspicuous. As Sir
Joshua Reynolds well observed: ? His excellence was
his own, the result of his particular observation and
taste; for this he was not indebted to the Flemish
School, nor indeed to any school, for his grace
was not academical or antique, but selected by him-
self from the great school of nature.? This eminent
English painter was born at Sudbury, in Suffolk, in
1727, and died in 1788, He appears to have been
rincip ally, if not wholly, a self-taught artist.
(No, 96.) ? A Musical Party. By J, Molenaer.
Dutch. This is a picture in the Dutch style. It repre-
sents a woman playing on a guitar, and singing,?a
man behind her assisting to the utmost extent of his
vocal powers?and another worthy bearing his part in
- the concert with violin and voice. There are, in the
picture, four either figures ; two of which, in the back-
ground, seem to be very harmoniously agreed. The
name of the artist, a successful imitator of Ostade, is
inscribed on the bench in front.
(No, 97.) ? Shepherdess and Artist, By Maria An-
gelica Kauffman. Coire 1742. Although by an ill-
advised marriage the artist of this, and its companion
picture, No. 99, changed her name to Zucchi, she is
always known in art by her maiden name alone.
Maria Angelica Kauffman was the daughter of a Swiss
portrait painter resident at Coire?the capital of the
Grisons in Switzerland?and at a very early age dis-
covered an extraordinary taste for painting and for
music. She was also an eminent linguist, speaking
Italian, German, French, and English, with equal
fluency. In 1757 her father, who had himself taught
her the elements of design, took her
(then in her 16th year) to Milan, where she
made great progress under the best masters of the
day. Subsequently, she visited Rome and Naples,
where her talents, the charms of her person, and her
many varied accomplishments, excited a more than
usual degree of admiration. In 1765 ?already pos-
sessed of a very brilliant reputation?she came to
England, where, four years afterwards she received
the honours of the Royal Academy, and was high in
favour at Court. After contracting an unfortunate
marriage Angelica returned, in 1782, to Rome, where
she remained in the exercise of her talents until her
death in 1807, in the 69th year of her age. In
the historical pictures of Angelica Kauffman, the
figures are generally small, the design being neither in-
correct nor ungraceful, and the colouring both mellow
and harmonious. Her paintings are distinguished by
an air of mild and virginal dignity, but she is without
variety in her forms and in the expression of her
heads, and devoid of life and energy in her attitudes.
The figure in this pleasing production of her art is
seated with her pastoral charge near her, by a tree, on
the trunk ot which she is inscribing the name of
? Tancred.?
(No. 98.) Landscape and Cattle. By H. Antonis-
sen. Antwerp. 1737. This is an excellent paint-
ing, representing a large extent of open meadow-land
bordered upon by stately trees. Numerous figures
and cattle, which add a material interest to the view,
are very judiciously introduced. The time is evidently
that of a summer?s evening, as may be seen, not only
from the gold and purple in the distant sky, but from
the soft warm tint which everywhere pervades the
picture. Henry Antonissen was born at Antwerp in
1737, and died in 1794.
(No. 99.) Leda and the Swan. By M. A. Kauff-
man. Coire 1742. This painting is a companion
picture to No. 97. The subject is treated in a
precisely similar style, both as to design and execution.
(No. 100.) Landscape with Figures. By Anthony
Waterloo. Utrecht 1618. The subject of this large
and valuable picture is a view in the Netherlands.
To the right is a chateau, and in front of that
building are large, beautifully painted trees, through
breaks in which are exquisite bits of scenery, wherein
the perspective is marvellously carried out; every-
thing being as free as possible, and yet perfected in
the most elaborate style. In the foreground are
several finely-drawn figures, in the treatment of which
the colours have been most judiciously selected, and
laid on in such a manner as greatly to augment the
general effect. The foreground and the sky are both
remarkably good. There is a lightness, a clearness,
an ease, and?at the same time ?a finish about this
noble picture, which claims the particular attention of
the discriminating visitor. It is from the pencil of
Anthony Waterloo, an unhappy genius, who was
born at Utrecht in 1618, and died there in great
poverty in 1679. Waterloo was not less celebrated as
an engraver than as a painter, and left many works
behind him, all much prized as gems of art.
(No. 101.) Landscape, with Farm-house and Figures.
By N. Rontbont. Dutch. This is a landscape painted
in a warm brownish tint. A farm-house, at the foot
of a gentle eminence, stands fronting a public road,
along which some figures are passing. Of the artist
himself little is definitely known. He probably lived
early in the last century.
(No. 102.) A Happy Family. By Melchior Hon-
decooter. Utrecht. 1636. The painter of this pic-
ture ?representing domestic? fowls, guinea pigs, and a
pigeon, &c.?was instructed by his father until he was
sixteen years of age. Subsequently he became a pupil
of his uncle, John B. Weenix, and under the tuition
of that artist was soon highly distinguished for his
live fowls, game, and such like subjects. He is much
celebrated for the plumage of his birds. His touch is
firm and bald, and his colouring rich and mellow.
Melchior Hondecooter died in 1695. fL
- - (No. 103.) Dead Game and Vegetables. By John
Fytt. Antwerp, 1625. This clever picture (the
nature of which is sufficiently indicated by its name)
is by an eminent Flemish painter of the seventeenth
century, who excelled in the representation of animals
and subjects of this description, and whose abilities
were highly estimated by Rubens, Jansens, Grayer,
and other artists of that day. His touch is spirited
and full of energy. He died in 1671.
(No. 104.) Landscape, with Cattle crossing a Ford.
By Frederick Moucheron, Embden, 1633. A fine
picture, with numbers of well painted trees. The
light is very well thro wn. This artist was a pupil of
John Asselyn, under whose able teaching he made
great progrsss. On attaining the age of twenty
years he travelled in France, where his abilities as a
landscape painter were deservedly appreciated. Atter
residing four years at Paris, he returned to Antwerp,
and finally settled at Amsterdam. His landscapes,
of which this is a pleasing specimen, exhibit judici-
ously selected pieces of scenery, the forms of his trees
being well chosen, and their peculiar foliage light and
easy. Moucheron?s works are much prized in Hol-
land. He died in 1686, in the 54th year of his age.
(No. 105.) A Composition by Salvator Rosa. Naples
1614. This grand picture by the famous Salvator
Rosa exhibits a wild, dark glen with figures, and a
distant landscape. In the foreground are four figures,
of whom one is Diana, and with whom are three dogs.
On an islet in the centre of still, black water (over-
hung with trees and impending cliffs) is a nymph,
who appears to have swum across the
pool from her mistress, accompanied by a
favourite hound. On the right hand corner of the
picture, following round the steep bank, is a dog
barking at some birds, and near that animal (but
deep in the shadow) are two men. At the further
extremity of the water there is a glimpse of open
country in which two figures are to be seen approach-
ing, The clouds and sky are of a sombre and gloomy
tint, in keeping with all the rest of this picture. So
completely is the foreground in shadow, that it is
only on a clear, sunny day that the full effect of this
splendid painting can be properly realised. Salvator
Rosa was born near Naples in 1614, and is said to
have learnt the first rudiments of his art
under Francesco Francazano, who had married
his sister. His family being in necessitous
circumstances it was not until he had
been kindly assisted and encouraged by Gio-
vanni Lanfranco, that the young artist was enabled
effectually to pursue his studies. Eventually he be-
came a disciple of Guiseppe Ribera (II Spagnoletto),
and studied Tinder him Tint?d he went with that master
to Rome. Arrived there, Cardinal Braneacci be-
friended the young artist, and he was, not long after,
employed by Prince Giovanni Carlo de? Medici in
several important works. At the invitation ot that
personage, he resided in Florence for nine years, dis-
tinguishing himself not only as a painter, but also as a
satirical and dramatic poet. On his return to Rome,
he painted several historical pictures?altar-pieces for
churches. He is most celebrated for his landscapes,
which are invariably featured by an eccentric austerity
peculiarly his own. Instead of selecting the cultured
amenity which delights us in Claude, Swanevelt, and
Orizonti, he always makes choice of lonely haunts,
hollow glens, and wild and gloomy scenes. ?He
gives us,? says Sir Johua Reynolds, ? a peculiar cast
of nature, which, though void of grace, elegance, and
simplicity,?though it has nothing of that elevation and
dignity which belongs to the grand style, yet has that
sort of dignity which belongs to savage and unculti-
vated nature. But what is most to be admired in
him is the perfect correspondence which he observed
between the subjects he chose, and his manner of
treating them. Everything is of a piece; bis rocks,
trees, skies, even to his handlina, have the same rude
and wild character which animates his figures.?
Salvator Rosa died at Rome in 1673.
(No, 106). A Candlelight Scene. By Godfrey
Schalcken, Dort, 1643. A cavalier has attempted to
kiss the attendant, but, as it would seem, without
success. She has promptly thrust the candle into the
handsome and expectant face of the poor young
gentleman, who is obviously discomfited by that highly
reprehensible and roguish manoeuvre. The little
affair is not got over without some smothered merri-
ment on the part of the girl, for her fellow servant in
the distance turns round her head as if
she had reason to know that Gretchen
must have something funny to tell her
at which both of them will laugh heartily
when she again comes back to the kitchen-
Schalcken was a son �f the rector of the College at
Dort, and a pupil of the renowned Gerard Douw,
ziinder whom he acquired his great delicacy of finish-
ing, and his thorough knowledge of light and shadow-.
Under the tuition of that eminent painter he remained
until he had established a certain reputation, and es-
pecially for his candle-light scenes. These pictures
were eagerly sought after. It is in his night pieces,
such as this, that Schalcken?s merit is most conspicu-
ous. His excellence chiefly consists in the neatness of


his finishing, his perfect knowledge of chiaroscuro as
relates to objects in a fixed local light His touch is
sweet and mellow, and his colouring warm.
Schaleken was employed for some time in England,
and finally returning to Holland settled at the
Hague, where he died in his sixty-third vear, in
1706.
(No. 107.) Landscape with figures. By John Griffier,
Amsterdam, 1643. This is a landscape embracing the
two banks of a riyer?probably a portion of the Rhine
?the glassy stream of which is exquisitely painted.
A man, two women, and an infant (in antique cos-
tume), are seated in the foreground ; beyond whom
are a goat and a cow, drinking from the river. On the
opposite bank are to be seen a flock of sheep and
those in charge of them, soit wooded scenery, and a
large ruined tower. The artist of this agreeable
picture, John Griffier, was a scholar of Roland Rog-
man, whose works were at one time highly esteemed.
Subsequently Griffier studied the works of Ruysdael
and Lingelbach. He particularly excelled in landscapes
and views taken on the Rhine. He resided in Eng
land many years after the cal imitous fire in London ;
and by his industry and talent realised a competent
fortune, which, however, he unfortunately lost by
shipwreck on his return to his native country. He
thereupon once more went back to England, and died
there in 1718, aged 75 years.
(No. 108.) Landscape with River Scenery and
numerovs figures By Velasquez, Seville, 1594. Don
Diego Velasqutzde Silva, one of the most distinguished
painters of the Spanish school, on whose easel this
picture originated, was born in Seville in the year
1594, His first instructors in the art were Francesco
Herrera the Elder, and afterwards Pacheco. He sub-
sequently improved himself by the study of some of
the works of Guido, Caravaggio, and others, the con-
templation of which excited him to still more sublime
and elevated ideas. In 1622, Velasquez visited the
metropolis of Spain, and was there liberally patronised
by Pnilip the Fourth, through the intervention of
that monarch?s great minister Olivarez. He speedily
acquired a high reputation as an historical painter,
and produced several pictures which were in them-
selves sufficient to immortalise his memory. In 1629,
having visited Venice, he proceeded' to Rome?
and was graciously received by Cardinal Barberini
(the nephew of Urban VIlI), who procured apart-
ments for him in the Vatican, where he had unre-
stricted access to the works of Michel Angelo and
Raffaelle. Whilst in that city he painted some of his
greatest pictures, some of which were retained in
Rome, and others transmitted to the King of Spain.
After an absence of a year and a half, Velasquez re-
turned to his native country, and there remained
practising his art with distinguished success until the
fall of his patron, the Due de Olivarez. Even after the
disgrace of that eminent statesman Velasquez did not
lose the favour of his Most Catholic Majesty, who
sent him, in 1648, on a particular embassy to Pope
Innocent X., commissioning him at the same time to
purchase the finest works of art he could meet with in
Italy for the royal collection. With this in view he
visited the principal cities of that country, and finally
went back to Spain in 1651, taking with iiim a magni-
ficent collection of antique statues, busts, and a great
variety of pictures by the most celebrated Italian
masters. Five years after Philip conferred upon him
the order of St. Jago, one of the highest honours at
his disposal. This great Spanish master continued
to experience the protection of his sovereign until
his death, in 1660, at the age of sixty-
six years. He was buried with great pomp
in the church of San Juan. In landscape
it is worthy of remark that the style of Velasquez is
altogether different from that of the FlemLh and
Dutch schools, in which there is often an elaborate
finish which must be actually inspected with a mag-
nifying glaso before it can be fully appreciated. But
Velasquez, as may be seen from this remarkable pic-
ture, produces his objects at once; the canvas is barely-
covered, the contours are all free; earth, rock, tiees,
and sky combining to form the one harmonious mass.
If approached too near the scene appears confused, un-
certain, and chaotic; viewed, however, at a proper
distance, the confusion becomes form, and presents
nature beautiful, simple, and sublime. Let the visitor
test the justice of these observations by examining,
for example, the rocky eminence in this painting
across the water, and the small landscape thereupon.
The subject of the entire picture is some scenery near
a large river, which winds between gloomy rocks
There is a bathing party in the background; in
front, parties in a boat, and a fete champetre.
It is_ the sole picture in th- gallery by this eminent
Spanish master, and deserves particular consideration.
(No. 109.) A Sea Piece. Artist unknown. This
is a good marine sketch, with shipping, &c. The
water is well painted, but as a whole the picture is
not one which calls for any particular remark.
(No. 110.) Card-players. By John Le Due.
Hague. 1636. This painting represents three men
and three women drinking and enjoying themselves.
A drunken mulatto is looking in at the window. The
faces, if not refined, are all very expressive ; espe-
cially that of the woman who holds up a glass of
liquor behind her favourite cavalier. John Le Due
was born at the Hague in 1636, He was originally a
pupil of Paul Potter, and, in 1671, was appointed
director of the academy at the Hague. Having in
this style of composition acquired an excellent repu-
tation in the art, he abandoned it for a militarv life.
He died in the year 1695.
(No. 111.) Landscape with Ruined Temple
and Nymphs. By Herman Swanvelt. Woer-
den. 1620. This exquisitely beautiful landscape
is from the pencil of one who was the favourite pupil
of Claude, to whose works it bears a very close re-
semblance. To the left are the shapely columns of a
ruined temple, past which, upon the greensward, ten
nymphs are drawing a female figure in a car. Beyond
the temple is another edifice, and then a l@ng reach of
perspective, disclosing a distant country, terminated,
at the horizon, with all the glories of a sunset. Across
the river in the foreground is a bridge, the right of the
picture being filled up with trees. This is indeed a
most delightful painting, so perfect in its design and
execution as to have been put down for a Claude by
some of the most competent judges. Swanevelt first
studied under Gerard Douw, but abandoning that
artist?s style altogether he went to Rome, and became
the disciple of Claude Lorraine, By the assistance of
so able an instructor, and his own attentive observ-
ance of nature, Swanevelt became one of the most
celebrated painters of landscape in his day,
few artists having ever surpassed him in
his tints, and in the delicate degradation of his aerial
perspective. His pictures are usually embellished, like
this, with relics of ancient architecture, and decorated
with groups of figures. His paintings are wholly in
the Italian style, and are much esteemed in Italy,
where he resided nearly all his life; He died at Rome
in 1690.
(No. 112.) Landscape , with Cavaliers and carriage
crossing a ford. By John Sybrecht, Antwerp, 1625.
This is a rather singular picture. The road seems to
lead the travellers right across a running stream,
bordered on one side with trees. A lady and gentle
man on horseback have just got through the ford.
Both are in the costume of the latter half of the
seventeenth century ; the lady wearing a stiff cambric
apron, and the gentleman that peculiar hat which we
usually associate with the not too refined era of King
William. A heavy two-horse family coach is coming
lumbering along behind. John Sybrecht W?as born at
Antwerp in 1625. He learned the first elements of
his art under his father, and afterwards imitated
Nicholas Berghem, and Karel du Jardin, with un-
usual success. He was patronised by the Duke of
Buckingham, who invited him to England and em-
ployed him at Cliefden. Sjbrecht?s pictures were
then much esteemed. He died in 1703.
(No. 113.) ( Group of Fishermen, By an unknown
artist. This is a good picture, presenting a group of
fishermen, with fish and dogs, &c., in a landscape.
In the back-ground are ruins overgrown with brush-
wood, terminated by a bay with shipping. The sky
is very beautiful.
(No. 114.) The Holy Family , a small painting by
Annibale Caracci. Bologna , 1560, In this little gem
by the great Annibale Caracci, the Holy Virgin is
represented in a semi-recumbent posture, holding
the infant Jesus in her lap. The Child is smiling
extending a narrow white label to St. John. St.
Joseph forms the fourth, and least prominent figure
of the group. The whole is thrown into a deep, soft,
twilight shadow, which harmonises sweetly with the
nature of the subject. The infantine grace and beauty
of the two children are truly admirable. This emi-
nent artist, the cousin of Ludovico Caracci, and the
younger brother of Agostino, was born at Bologna in
1560. His gtnius was cultivated with the greatest
c are by Ludovico, and well did the scholar reward the
pMns. so bestowed upon him. Having left his dis-
tinguished relative to study the works of Correggio at
Parma, he afterwards further improved himself by
devoting his attention to the compositions ol Titian,
Tintoretto, and Paolo Veronese. Returning to Bo-
logna he assisted Ludovico in his undertakings in the
palaces of Magnani, Favi, and Zampieri. He worked
also for eight years in the Farnese gallery, and was
very inadequately remunerated. Italy abounds with
the historical productions of this great master, who
was also an excellent painter of landscapes. Annibale
Caracci died in 1609,
(No, 115.) St. Mary at the foot of the Cross, By
Cornelius Poelemburgh. Utrecht, 1586. The Cross
is represented without its sacred burden, the Virgin
being seated on the ground at its foot. An angel
stands near her with three large nails, and another an-
gelic being is beside her bearing the Crown of Thorns,
There are two cherubic angels in the air, one of which
is extremely beautiful. This painting is elaborately
finished, and looks almost as if it had been painted on
ivory. The artist was first a disciple of Abraham
Bloemart, but he afterwards went to Rome andstudied
under Adam Elsheimer, further perfecting his style by
the contemplation of the greatest masters of theltalian
school. He is distinguished for the delicacy and
brilliancy of his colouring, the neatness of his pencil,
and the clearness of his carnations. His works were very
highly esteemed at Rome. Returning to his
native land he there pursued his art for some time,
and afterwards went over to England at the invitation
of King Charles 1., who earned a great name as the
patron of art, however much he may be considered to
have failed as a politician. Whilst in London Poelem-
burgh painted several portraits for the king and his
nobility. The success he achieved in England did not
induce him to stay there. He returned to Holland,
and died at Utrecht in 1660. Bryan has not done
justice t� the talents of this great artist, who had many
scholars and followers, amongst whom were Bronk-
horst and Jan de Lys. His pictures have been fre-
quently engraved.
(No. 116.) Landscape with figures in the foreground.
By Moucheron and Lingelbach. 17th Century. This
is a landscape by Frederick Moucheron, the figures in
the foreground being introduced by John Lingelbach,
The subject is a watermill and mill dam,
with wooded banks in the back ground. Of
Moucheron we have already spoken when treating of
No. 104. Lingelbach was born at Franckfort in
1625, and pursued his studies in Amsterdam, Paris,
and Rome. He was much celebrated for his figures,
cattle, and smaller animals, and many of the painters
of that day employed him to decorate their pictures
by introducing such objects. Amongst those who
thus availed themselves of his services were Wynants
and Ruysdael. Lingelbach died in the year 1687.
(No. 117.) Landscape and figures skating on ice.
Zingelin Modern Dutch. The nature of this picture
is sufficiently get forth by its name. There are tents
and refreshments for those who are engaged in their
healthful and invigorating sport. It is a
men of the modern Dutch school.
(No. 418.) The Fortune Teller. By Goodall.
English. A pretty picture in the modern
style. A smart little, credulous damsel, in the
piquante costume of Dolly Varden, is listening, near a
stile in a wood, to the lies of a sly old gipsy womjin,
who has doubtless had her hand crossed with the in-
dispensable piece of silver? selon les regies ?or perhaps
we should rather say against them.
(No. 119.) A Water Mill in iho Highlands near
Callendar. By Auld. Modern. A clever land-
scape, painted in the modern English style.
(No. 120.) Landscape, Cattle and Figures. By
Julius Cesar Ibbetson. Masham, 1783. This excel-
lent English artist (considered by Benjamin West to
be the Berghem of England) was highly successful in
delineating the scenery of his native country. He was
born in Yorkshire in 1783, and died in 1817,
(No. 121.) Sailors Carousing and Caressing. Ibbet-
son. England, 1783. A lively representation of the
escapades of Jack ashore after a long cruise, exhibit-
ing all the folly and thoughtlessness usually ascribed
to him.
(No. 122.) A Landscape , with Cattle and Figures.
This is another painting by the same respectable
painter, but altogether on a more pleasing subject than
that immediately preceding.
(No. 123.) A Market Girl. By Edmonstone.
English. [ Unfinished .] Represents the upper por-
tion of the figure of a fair English girl with a small
basket of fruit. She is leaning against a sapling, and
beyond her is the sketch of a distant prospect. The
artist is one of the modern English school.
(No. 124). Rustics Carousing. By J C. Ibbetson.
Masham. 1783. This picture exhibits a numerous
social party of peasant men and women enjoying
themselves (in a quiet orderly manner) in the large
open-roofed kitchen of some hospitable farmhouse.
The time selected is probably that of Christmas, and,
judging from the costume, must be somewhere about
the close of the last century. It is a pleasant winter
party, the younger section of whom are evidently
engaged in the now almost obsolete mysteries of snap,
dragon. Of Ibbetson we have already spoken in our
observations upon No 120.
(No. 125.) Itinerant Minstrel. By J. C. Ibbetson.
Masham. 1783. A wandering minstrel, with an.
inexorable barrel organ and a pitiless pan?s-reed, is
grinding and shrieking away in the street of some


,ullage, surrounded by a not over-fastidious audience,
chiefly ?imposed of juveniles. The picture is more
pleas* n t to contemplate than any such an agonizing
reaVty would be to endure.
(No. 127.) An Interior. By De Bykher. Modern
Flemish. A capital exemplar of the modern Flemish
school, and many a maternal heart will beat warmly
before it. An honest, healthy, dark-eyed, fair-skinned
Flemish mother is engaged with her little fat baby
and the next eldest child. The ex-baby is fondly
caressing its merry, chubby-cheeked supplanter. All
the accessories of this excellent picture (even to the
thievish cat) are admirable. There is a great clear-
ness and depth in the perspective of the background.
(No. 127.) Another Interior. By De Bykher.
Modern Flemish. This picture, a companion to that
just mentioned, is by the same artist, and on a very
similar subject. The happy mother, in a perfect rap-
ture of admiration, has just set baby down upon the
table before ? Granny,? and has asked the old lady
?if there ever was such ,a beautiful, &c., &c.?
Grandmother, of course, as in duty bound, cheerfully,
and with uplifted hands, protests ? that she never, in
all her life, did ever see such a lovely, such a beau-
tiful, &c., &c., &c,? It is an every-day dialogue,
so that one need not here repeat it in full. The boy
is bent upon distinguishing himself. He lays hold of
the much-enduring cat in a manner which throws his
admiring relatives into perfect extacies.
(No. 128.) Winter. By Bartolome Estevan
Murillo. Seville, 1613. A small picture by this great
Spanish master?one of four (apparently portaits),
representing the seasons of the year. This, personi-
fying winter, is a boy in a blue dress, well wrapped
up. He wears a black hat, in which there is a scarlet
feather.
(No. 129.) Autumn. By Murillo. One of the
same set. A chubby little maid, crowned with vine
leaves, is squeezing grapes into a basin.
(No. 130.) An Interior. By David Teniers the
Elder. Antwerp, 1582. This is a picture repro-
ducing the interior of some Flemish house, showing
different articles of furniture. A woman is visible
at the back. Respecting this artist we have made
some few remarks when noticing No. 83.
(No. 131). Spring. By B. E. Murillo. Seville,
1813. [See No. 128, &c.] A little fair-haired girl
with berries in her apron appears to be intended to
persouuy spring.
(No. 132.) Summer. By B. E. Murillo. Seville,
1613. [See No. 128, &c.] A maiden, apparently the
elder sister of the foregoing, personifies Summer. She
has, in one hand, a carnation, and in the other a tulip
Roses and other flowers are on the table before her.
(No. 133.) Domestic Scene. By Henry Rokes Zorg.
Rotterdam, 1621. | A large apartment, in which some
female is busily engaged in her household duties.
The light is well thrown upon the scene depicted.
"Zorg was born at in 1621, and died in 1682.
This artist, whose real name by birth was Rokes, ac-
quired the cognomen of Zorg, or Careful, in conse-
quence of that appellation having been honourably
bestowed upon his father for some attention to his
duties. He was a pupil of David Teniers the younger,
and generally occupied himself with Dutch interiors.
His first master was Buytenweg of Rotterdam.
(No. 134.) An Ale House, By William Bird.
Wolverhampton, 1772. This artist, usually known as
? Bird of Bristol,? received that designation from
having there set up a school for drawing. By teach-
ing others this respectable English painter greatly
improved himself in his art. ? During the intervals
of instruction,? we are told, ?he made sketches,
designs, and compositions for pictures, and it wonld
appear that his progress was due to his own observa-
tion and persevering industry. So far he was his
own master. He painted humourous and pathetic
subjects, which attracted much of public attention,
and induced the members of the Royal Academy to
enrol his name as an Academician. His best pic-
tures, as historical compositions, are the Results
of the Battle of Chevy Chace (which he treated in a
manner truly consonant with the old ballad from
which the subject is taken), and the Surrender of
Calais. His chief merit, as an artist, lay in natural
and touching representations of homely and social
things ; history, either sacred or profane, required a
spirit more imaginative than he uossessed.? Bird is
described as having been a kind-hearted and amiable
man, much respected by all who knew him. He died
in 1819, and was buried in Bristol Cathedral. This
picture from his pencil represents three men in the
taproom of an alehouse ; the barmaid is standing just
at the door. One of the men?a jolly-looking fellow,
who is probably the village shoemaker?stands d
t Anglais, with his back to the fire. Another man
apparently a tramper, is playing on his fiddle, to the
obvious delectation of all present?especially that of a
countrified old man, who is unable to even drink his
beer for admiration.
(No. 135. ) Hunting and Hawking Scene. By Abra-
ham Hondius. Rotterdam, 1638. A ladv and gentle-
man on horseback, are engaged in hawking. The
heron has been struck down by the falcon, to the
delight of the three dogs. We have already spoken of
this artist when treating of No. 30.
(No. 136.) Landscape. By an unknown artist. The
landscape consists of scenery along the banks of some
river, having, on one side, cliffs covered with houses
brushwood, and on other an expanse of level,
wooded country. The trees in the foreground are
designed and. painted with peculiar grace and light-
ness. A,
(No. 137.) Flour and Fruit Piece , &c. By Daniel
Seghers. Antwerp, 1590. This picture, w r hich hangs
immediately over the entrance to the Mona Gallery,
represents a bust of Pan (or some Silvan Faun), in
front of which flowers and fruits have been deposited
by three Cupids. Seghers, or Segers, was born at
Antwerp in 1590, and his taste leading him to design
flowers and fruit, he studied under J. Breughel, who
at that time confined himself to such subjects. At
the age of sixteen he became a Jesuit, but being
afterwards sent to Rome, he there pursued that
department of art to which his inclination prompted
him, and returned to his native country with a rich
assemblage of drawings. To his imitations of flowers
he is noted for imparting that beauty, brilliancy, and
variety with which nature has clothed the originals.
He frequently painted garlands and borders of flowers,
in which the inner space was filled up with some
historical subject, by other hands. Such pictures,
even Rubens did not disdain occasionally to execute.
Daniel Seghers died at Antwerp in 1660.
(No, 138) Interior : Drinking Scene, By Renier
Brakenburg. Haerlem. 1649, Le Roi boit? The
King drinks. A spirited representation of the
time-honoured revelries of Twelfth Night. His
Majesty, the king of the revels, is not only
drinking but his boisterous subjects are so
noisy that the young woman in the foreground is fain
to stop her ears against the uproar, to the great amuse-
ment of her next neighbour. Brakenberg was first
instructed in his art by Mommers, a landscape
painter, but afterwards became the pupil of one
Schendel, whose style was more suited to his genius.
Brakenberg depicted representations of merry-makings
and drunken assemblies, ingeniously composed, some-
what after the manner of Adrian Yan Ostade. He
appears to have painted with facility, and to have been
well acquainted with the principles of chiaroscuro.
He was born in 1649, at Haerlem, and died in the
same town in 1702.
(No. 139.) Hawking Scene. By Abraham Hondius.
Rotterdam, 1638. This picture is the companion
to No. 135. The equestrienne is here represented
as having dismounted, the sport having been
brought to a satisfactory conclusion.
(No, 140.) An Intel ior. After Hogarth. English.
A handsome young traveller, in a green coat, and
smart three-cornered hat, is just sitting down to his
dinner, near the larder of a country inn. He takes
the opportunity of murmuring something highly com-
plimentary to the attendant, who is evidently not
offended at the tone ot his observations. There are
several other figures in the kitchen beyond. William
Hogarth was a very successful English painter and
engraver of the last century. He was born in London,
in 1698, and died in the same city in 1764.
(No, 141.) Spanish Market Women. By Hendrik
Mommers, Haerlem, 1623. This painter studied at
Rome, and was called by the Associated Artists there
Meleager. His subjects are usually vegetable markets,
and peasants, with landscapes in the background and
other accessories. His colouring is warm and pleas-
ing, and his pencilling clean and vigorous. He is be-
lieved to have died in his native country in 1697.
This specimen of his genius is a very agreeable com-
position. It represents three Spanish peasant women
resting on their way to market. There are two other
figures in the background, and beyond them a pretty
and highly characteristic landscape.
(No. 142.) A Madonna, By an Unknown Artist. This
is a painting which well deserves the attention of the
visitor. It has in it something peculiarly striking and
original. The Yirgin is represented with a little clasped
book in her hand, and wearing a purple dress, a light
blue mantle, and a brownish veil. The eyes of this
exquisitely lovely and spiritual conception are dark,
the features mild and delicate, and the face oval. The
expression wavers between that of thoughtfulness and
surprise.
(No. 143.) The Presentation in the Temple, By
Michael Wohlgemuth. Nuremberg, 1434. This is
ajpicture of the ancient German school, companion to
No. 63, and by the same old master. St. Mary, by
the hands of an attendant, or young female friend,
offers two doves in a basket. Oar Lord, as an infant,
is in the hands of the priest. Three hooded
figures are standing by, two of them holding lights.
The idea of the Presentation in the Temple is, by the
last circumstance, evidently identified with that of the
Festival of the Purification ( Candlemas).
(No. 144.) A Mater Dolorosa. By Andrea Yacaro,
Naples, 1598. The painter to whose talent art owes
this fine picture was born at Naples in 1598, and died
there in 1670, A?pupil of Massimo Stanzioni, he after-
wards first attached himself, on leaving that instructor,
to an imitation of the manner of M. A, Caravaggio,
but he subsequently (following the judicious advice
of Stanzioni) adopted the style of Guido. After the
death of Massimo he long remained without a rival in
the Neapolitan School. The Sorrowing Mother is
idealized as a young and beautiful woman, whose
mild and almost angelic features?half-veiled with
her light-blue hood?are brought out into strong
relief by a ray of light from heaven. Her hands are
quietly (not convulsively) clasped together, with an
air that is at once expressive both of sublime resigna-
tion and of most intense suffering. It is impossible to
contemplate this touching picture without recalling
the pathetic and well-known lines of that grand old
Latin hymn, the Stabat Mater ?
O quam tristis et afflieta,
Fuit ilia benedicta,
Mater Unigeniti,?
Qua: merebat, et doiebat,
Et tremebat, cum videbat
Natl poenas Inolyti.
Quis est homo qufnon fierdt,
Christ! Matrem si videret
In tanto supplieio 2
Quis posset non contristari,
Piam Matrem contemplari
Dolentcm cum Filio ?
(No. 145) Butteifly and Snells. By Gerard Douw.
Leyden. 1613. The valuable little cabinet picture to
which attention is now invited will be found bv the
visitor on the antique mosaic table, to the right as he
face� the fireplace. Three sea shells are depicted in
the lower part of this elaborate gem, and at the top
there is a small butterfly, looking more like an ento-
mological specimen than a work of human art. In a
corner the skilful limner has set his brand in unmis-
takeable characters?GDOY. Douw was the son of
a glazier at Leyden, who, perceiving that his boy had
an inclination for drawing, placed him with Kowen-
hoorn, from whom he received the first rudiments of
his art. At fiiteen he became the scholar of Rem-
brandt, under whose instruction he remained for three
years, until he became a perfect master of harmonious
colouring and chiaroscuro. Curiously enough, Douw
preferred the earlier to the later and more vigorous
style of his great master, and made it accordingly the
model he proposed to himself for imitation. He
adopted a mode of uniting the powerful tones and
magical light and shadow of his instructor, with a
minuteness and precision which so nearly approaches
nature as sometimes almost to amount to an
illusion. And yet, although his pictures are
wrought up more than those of any other artist,-they
always evince the spirited touch of the master, with
a light and shadow only to be found in the highest
productions of art. Everything he did, whether the
representation of the human form, or that of a flower,
of a shell, or even of a butterly, was finished with
the most patient and careful elaboration, and to this
he may be considered principally to owe his fame.
He died in 1674.
(No. 146) St. John and the Lamb. By an Unknown
Artist. In this small and very beautiful cabinet
painting (which looks as if it had been pencilled upon
ivory), Saint John the Baptist is represented under
the form of a child about six years old, clad in his
tunic of camel?s hair, and fondling the Emblematical
Lamb, The label, ? Ecce Agnus Dei,? lies at the feet
of him who first made that sublime profession of
faith. It is something rather extraordinary that it
should not be known who was the artist of a work of
such rare excellence as this picture.
(No. 147) A Landscape near Antwerp. By David
Teniers the younger. Antwerp. 1610. A landscape
in the silvery style of this great Flemish master.
There are figures in the foreground, and behind is a
chateau. The scenery selected is a view near
Antwerp. It is raining. This little picture stands
near No. 146, on the mosaic table.
(No. 148) The Holy. Family. By Raffaelle. Urbino.
1483. This small and valuable painting?from the
Gallery of the late Prince of Canino?will be found
by the visitor to Mona in the cabinet which stands
immediately to the left of the entrance. The Blessed Vir-
gin is represented sitting near the outer walls of some
edifice, beside a wooden cot on which the Holy Child
is standing)?reaching across his mother?s lap to the
Baptist, who is held towards the Saviour by Saint


Elizabeth. St. Mary is clothed in blue and purple,
with an appropriate head-dress. The figure of the
Infant Redeemer is nude, that of St. John being but
partially clothed with his tunic of camel?s hair.
Round the head of each personage is seen that thin
faint ring of glory frequently substituted by the Greases
of all Painters for the broad nimbus of other artists.
No distinction whatever is here made between the
aureole above the head of Jesus and those surmount-
ing the heads of the three others in the group. Tae
landscape in the back ground to the right* of the
edifice?probably meant for the temple?is filled in
with a dark green tint. The authenticity of this
master piece is attested by a curious memorandum in
manuscript, pasted at the back of the picture. It
would be presumptuous to attempt to write any
critical disquisition upon the transcendant merits of
this composition, or to enter upon any of the wonderful
results which the genius of Raffaelle effected in art.
He is well known as the first of all painters, even
children are in these days made familiar with the
designs of his numerous magnificent composi-
tions. Raffaelle Sanzio di Urbino is univer-
sally acknowledged to have possessed a greater
combination of all the high excellencies
of art than ever fell to the lot of one man, either
before or since his day. He commenced his stud es
at Perugia under Pietro Vanucci, usually known as
Perugino, and painted historical pictures of extra-
ordinary merit before he was eighteen years of age.
In 1508 he was invited by Pope Ju ius the Second to
Rome, having been recommended to that great states-
man and warrior pontiff by Bramante, to assist in
ornamenting the Vatican. Space does not here permit
us to enumerate the many triumphs he there achieved,
but so satisfied was the great Julius with his per-
formances that he directed all the paintings which
had been finished in the apartments of the Vatican
by Bramantino, Pier della Francesco, and others to
be defaced that the whole might be decorated by the
hand of Raffaelle. He continued to be thus employed
for many years, but his great works at the Vatican
did not here prevent him for engaging in other under-
takings, and satisfying the desire of several individuals
to become possessed ot some of his matchl ss
productions. The story of his successful rivalry
with the great Michel Angelo is well known ; it 1 d
to the creation of his last splendid painting - the
Transfiguration?publicly exhibited by the side of his
body as he lay' in state previous to his
interment in the Church of the Rotunda. Death
carried him off in the flower of his age, and the height
of his fame. He was attacked by fever and died
after a short illness, on the 6th of April, 1520, aged
thirty.seven years. His death was considered by that
Eminent Prince Leo X,?the guardian of learning
and wise and consistent protector of the Fine Arts?to
be a public disaster to Italy, and a positive loss to the
world.
(No. 149), St. Adrian and St. Natalia?part of a
iriptic. By Lucas Van Leyden. Leyden, 1494. The
artist who painted this panel was Lucas Jacobs, called
Van Leyden from the place of his birth. He is
regarded as the earliest patriarch of the Dutch School.
Having been first instructed in the rudiments of his
art by his father Hugo Jacobs, he was sent, whilst yet
a child, to study under Cornelius Engelbrechtsen, and
astonished all the artists of his time by his picture of
St. Hubert, painted wdien he was only twelve years
old. A contemporary with Albert Durer and l.is'inti-
mate friend he is allowed to have surpassed him in
c imposition, although his inferior in design. Leyden
painted in oil, distemper, and on glass, and treated
with equal success history, landscape, and portraits.
His colouring is fresh and clear, and his pencil light,
though finished. His drawing of the figure
is stiffly taken from the model in the Gothic
style, then universally prevalent in Germany and
Flanders. He died in 1533. On the outer side of the
panel is the figure of the Virgin standing, painted in
a neutral tint. Beside her is the Emblamatical Lily,
and near her the Heavenly Dove. Two saints are
seen on the other side of the door?St. Adrian and
St. Natalia. The female figure with a curiously
shaped hood and antique dress, is represented praying
on her knees. Near her is a lion, and behind her the
oth-r principal figure?a man in complete armour
with long sword drawn in his hand. In a circular
space over his head, not unlike an oriel window, is
a black-letter inscription.
(No. 150.) Head of the Saviour breaking Bread; a
Replica of the Marquess of Exeter?s Picture at Burleigh.
By Carlo Dolci. Florence, 1616. This fine painting
is placed in the cabinet standing to the right hand of
the visitor as he enters the Mena Gallery?adjoining
the cabinet in which No. 148 has been deposited.
The design of the admirable composition, now the
subject of consideration, is well known, having been
very frequently and carefully engraved. The upper
part of the figure of the Redeemer is here depicted
?about the size of life. Seated at the table, after the
Last Supper, he has taken bread into his left
hand, and is raising his right in the attitude of
invoking a solemn benediction. By the side of the
Paten, on which the loaf has rested, is the Chalice ;
and under the right arm, the Corporal, The eyes of
the Messiah are turned towards heaven, and a dim
light hovers over and irradiates the pale features of
that Divine Head, in which there is a soft and tran-
quil expression of devotion under patient suffering.
Toe whole is treated with the utmost delicacy and
tenderness, the colouring being highly appropriate
to the sublime character of the subject ;
nothing harsh or obtrusive, everything modest,
placid, and harmonious. Carlo, or Carlino Dolci
Was born at Florence in 1616, and was a scholar of
Jacopo Yignali. His works chiefly consisted of
highly pleasing pictures, confined usually to devo-
tional subjects, and, most frequently, to heads of the
Saviour, and of the Blessed Virgin. The small pic-
tures of the Madonna are much more numerous than
those of our Lord, and almost equally in demand, on
account of their polished and laborious finishing.
Carlo Dolci died in 1686.
(No. 151.) Mary Queen of Scots playing to Rizzio . By
an Unknown Artist. Theill-fated Queen is represented
playing on her spinnet accompanying her unhappy
secretary in some piece of music. This painting is
in the corridor as you go up the staircase into the
upper gallery.
(No. 152.) Jetty and Boats. By an Unknown
lArtist. A work of considerable merit. Both water and
sky are treated in a very superior and artistic style,
(No. 153.) The Falls of Niagara, By Le Bihone.
A large, well-designed painting, which gives
one a capital idea of the awful grandeur of
what is presented by these Falls, and of the vast mass
of water there for ever rushing over an unseen preci-
pic;. The scenery of the adjacent country is also in-
cluded ; a long reach of the wide river above the
cataract, the town, the American side, and the lake
far beyond in the distance. Here, as in a map, the
whole topography of that interesting locality may be
studied.
(No. 154.) Landscape and Ruins. By Andrea Lu-
cateili. Rome. 17th century. The' date of this
painter?s birth has not been correctly ascertained ; but
it is said to have been in 1696. He was a landscape
painter in the style of Orizonti, and his talents were
highly appreciated in every inferior branch of art.
This picture is a judiciously-selected specimen of his
talents as a painter.
We have now given a brief description of the
paintings of the Mona Gallery, which may not
be altogether unacceptable to many of our readers
intending to pay a visit to this superb collection of
oil paintings,? the only one of the kind in all these
Australian colonies. What has been diffidently said
of each picture, may possibly be not without some
utility to such as have not hitherto had either the
time or the opportunity to make this branch of the
Fine Arts a subject of study, although possessed,
perhaps, of a taste which enables them in some degree,
to appreciate the brilliant and enduring triumph
of an artist?s pencil. In the Gallery at
Mona, besides the pictures, there are numerous
works of art and rare and curious objects which will at
once arrest the visitor?s attention,?statues and
statuettes of bronze and of white marble, bas reliefs,
antiquities, books of original designs by Italian masters ,
and such a variety of matters and things that it
is difficult even to glance at them with-
out becoming too diffuse for our limits.
Amongst the bronzes, beginning at the eastern end of
the gallery, are a boy and a goat, a man and a lion,
and an athlete throwing quoits. Between the two
first of the bronzes just enumerated ?to the left of the
entrance, on one of the two grey granite side tables is
a beautiful clock of mediaeval design, surmounted by
a warrior of the middle ages armed with a cross bow,
&c. Four busts and a fine sculptured
fragment of white marble are also to
be seen at this end of the gallery.
On the top of the cabinet containing the Raffaelle
stands a fine piece of wood carving by some unknown
artist, representing the Scourging of Christ. At the
western end of the spacious and lofty apartment, to
the left of the fireplace, is an antique mosaic table
from the collection of Lord Northwick, and <*n this
most exquisite and well preserved exempli* Q f
ancient art, stands an Etruscan Olpe, the belt of
which is adorned with animals, real and imaginary.
On the same table is the model of some hero or demi-
god, and other subjects deserving an attentive inspec-
tion. Two large-sized statues of white marble?the
figures of two beautiful women?stand near, and be-
tween them is a fine statue of the Infant St. John the
Baptist and his Lamb, from the atelier of P.
Costa of Florence, To the right of the fire-
place, on a side table, corresponding with the
antique mosaic, are several statues in white marble : a
Sleeping Cupid, Innocence (by Costa of Florence),
and a Child and Log.
By the southern wall, as you retrace your stens
eastward, is an interesting model of the Giant?s
Causeway, and three large slabs of the rock itself,
showing its very remarkable conformation. Near this
is a white marble bas-relief; and, standing
more towards the centre of the room,
a chess table, inlaid with white and variegated
marble. On the table near the cabinets is a cloth
embroidered in some convent in France, which is a
miracle of beauty in design and execution. This
table is covered with books of a character suitable to
the place. There is, for example, a folio volume
containing eighty-two pictures engraved by Barto-
lozzi from the originals of Guercino, ? Dessegni e
Bozzetti della Scuola Fiorentina?Piatioli e
Benvenuti,? ? Selections from the Vernon Gallery,? a
large illustrated folio edition of ?Thomson?s Seasons,?
and such like works. The designs contained in the
second �f the volumes just enumerated are the
original works of Signor Gaetano and Signor Gui-
seppe Piutoli- -father and son. The latter of these
artists was for many years Director of the Royal
Academy of Art at Florence, and died toward the
close of the last century. He was possessed ?t a most
extraordinary degree of talent in historical com-
position, developing in that branch of art talents of
the very highest order, as will be seen by those who
look at these valuable sketches, which are just as
they came from his pencil Besides these wonderful
designs there is another volume, in which are bound
up similar sketches by several great Italian artists.
In so rapid a resume it cannot of course be expected
that we can here enter into all the particulars. We
shall conclude by inserting the following description
of the Homeric Table, on which is depicted the
Shield of Achilles, This was brought by Mr. Smart
from the gallery of Lord Northwick, Thirlestane
House, Cheltenham. ? The shield is beautifully exe-
cuted in sepia,?the godlike labours of the threefold
circle being admirably drawn. In the centre is the
chariot of the sun, drawn by four fiery coursers, and
driven by Phoebus himself. Round this are described,
in successive groups?the marriage procession and
banquet?the quarrel and judicial appeal?the siege
and ambuscade?the military engagement?the har-
vest field and vintage?shepherds defending their
herds when attacked by lions, and the Cretan dance.
The waves of the sea form the border of the shield.
This splendid work of art was designed by John
Hennings, Esq., for the late Lord Northwick, and
was, for many years deposited in his lordship?s gallery
at Thirlestane House, Cheltenham. The design of the
sculptor is to illustrate Homer?s description of the
shield of Achilles. ( Vide Pope?s Translation of the
llliad, book xviii., lines 501 to 704.) The circle at the
top is four feet wide, and it is supported by a palm
tree springing from a tripod vase, on which are
grouped the figures of Achilles, Briseis, Thetis, and a
Triton, attended by genii and dolphins. It is covered
with plate glass and has been very elegantly
mounted.? The above description of this very in-
teresting object is taken from the Illustrated London
News of the 12th January, 1850. With this account
of the Homeric Table we must now conclude our
notice of tie Mona Gallery.
