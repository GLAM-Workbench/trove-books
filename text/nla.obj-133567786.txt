POLICY SPEECH
QUEENSLAND COUNTRY AND PROGRESSIVE NATIONAL PARTY
Mr. A. E. Moore
■ Mr. Moore said:
The Electors of Queensland are
now to be given an opportunity of
expressing their disapproval of the
manner in which the affairs of the
State have been conducted by the
Government during the past three
years. During that period democrat-
ic and constitutional government has
been dragged in the mire; the elec-
ted representatives of the people
have been brow-beaten and intimida-
ted; the rights of the community have
been sacrificed; our Courts have been
insulted and flouted; and those cloth-
ed with responsibility and authority
have been recreant to their trust and
false to their oath of office.
What person in this State would
like to go for a long sea voyage, with
the knowledge that the Captain and
his officers were not to be allowed
to command and navigate the ship
as their training and experience
taught them to be necessary, but had
to take their orders from the crew.
And yet this is the acknowledged
position in the Ship of State to-day.
What matters it, if there has been a
change of captains, the conditions
have not altered. The present Prem-
ier thirteen months ago, when talk-
ing to the A.R.U. on the question of
the 44 hour week, said: “The case
became one between the government
and its employees, apd he wanted to
assure them that It only opposed the
granting of a 44 hour week, because
it could not find the money. Later,
the party had stated that the 44 hour
week must he granted; THEY HAD
ACCEPTED THE DECISION OF THE
PARTY, AND THE RESPONSIBIL-
ITY WAS ON THE PARTY TO
MAKE PROVISION- FOR IT.” No
Statement could be more definite;
the crew were in charge.
We have suffered a numlliating ex-
perience during the recent railway
strike in that those In authority lif-
ted no finger to uphold the laws of
the State. Lawbreakers were en-
couraged to defy constitutional au-
thority, and all sections of the com-
munity suffered grievous loss and
inconvenience. So intolerable did
this state of affairs become that
peaceable and law abiding citizens
were compelled to leave their work
and their homes and travel, in many
cases to long distances, to protect
their own rights, and enforce obedi-
ence to the law; and ail this while
the constitutional authority looked
supinely on, afraid to move a finger,
terrorised by a few communists. But
now since their claws were clipped
at the Federal Elections, they are
endeavouring to make a brave show.
The most dispicable and abject cow-
ardice was displayed, and the only
part more shameful In this tragedy
was the method adopted by the party,
In its endeavour to escape the con-
sequences of Its dereliction of duty
—the removal of the man in charge
from the position he then occupied
to another created by them for the
purpose. The whole affair was a
travesty on constitutional govern-
ment, and it has placed this State
in the most unenviable position it is
possible to conceive.
Were it necessary to enlarge upon
the absolute surrender to outside dic-
tation, damning and irrefutable
proofs are abundant, but I will con-
tent myself with one quotation by
the present Premier from a speech
he delivered in Parliament on 7th
August, 1924. He said, “I want to
ask those outside who are agitating
for these very good reforms, if we
could make them —such as the 44
hour week, and the increase in the
basic wage—lP THEY COMPELLED
US, OR WE RESIGNED OUR-
SELVES TO THE POSITION, who
would he the sufferers? In order to
secure for the permanent employees
of the State a privilege or advantage
over everybody else, we would have
to dismiss thousands of men on oth-
er works of the State, employment
would suffer, or at least I think it
would. I am giving my opinion. 1
think that if taxation gets to a cer-
tain stage, and it is fairly high in
Queensland —It is 10/- in the £ in
some instances —it is the danger zone
for employment.” Whether the Min-
isters were compelled or resigned
themselves to the position is imma-
terial; the outside dictation has been
successful.
When the railway strike had been
settled, and the Commissioner for
Railways was asked when the ser-
vices would be resumed, he stated
that he was unable to say, It would
be necessary to ask the strike com-
mittee. When the Premier was ask-
ed he said “He trusted that they
would be resumed as early as pos-
sible.” But Mr. Rymer stated defin-
itely that “later in the day he would
state the hour and the day on which
the trains would commence to run.”
Never in the history of the British
Empire has a government sunk so
low. «
For ten years Queensland has sub-
mitted to the experience of being
governed by a Socialistic Govern-
ment —on the last two occasions, not
by the wish of the majority of the
electors, but owing to an extraordin-
arily successful method of fixing elec-
toral boundaries, so as to defeat the
will of the people. There is, howev-
er, now another chance of reviewing
the results of socialistic administra-
tion, and expressing an opinion
thereon.
For the past ten years we have
been experimenting in many ways.
New roads and avenues have been
opened up, each Introduced in extrav-
agant terms, as THE one which would
lead to the broad high way at the
end of which the Promised Land was
awaiting. Every prophesy made by
the Government when passing the
legislation that was to open wide
the doors of prosperity, open new
avenues of employment, decrease
taxation and assist development, has
proved false. In public, just the
same as in private affairs, the wise
Investment of capital and the care-
ful expenditure of ones annual in-
come, is the true road to happiness,
prosperity and progress. Capital
squandered to purchase present com-
fort and ease at the expense of the
future and one’s children cannot he
defended,— only apologised for. When
one considers that Queensland is
such a large and fortunate State in
regard to its possibilities for wealth
production, one would expect to see
development at least equal to States
less fortunately situated. Up to 1915,
the increase in land settlement, the
delivered the policy speech of the Parly as Toowoomba on Ihursday evening, 8th instant, before a large and enthusiastic audience.
progress and prosperity of our sec-
ondary industries, and the material
welfare of our people were all In
excess of other States: it Is only
since the blight came In 1915 that
there has been a steady decline In
all avenues that make for production
and prosperity. An extraordinary in-
crease in taxation, unfair State com-
petition, reckless public expenditure,
and foolish and restrictive legisla-
tion, have caused dear living, stagna-
ting industries, and unemployment.
To show to what extent this has taken
place, It is only necessary to glance
at the reports or the Income Tax
Commissioner.
In Queensland, from 1914/15 to
1922/23 (I take this period because
it affords a fair comparison with Vic-
toria, the deductions and allowances
being practically the same in both
States), the population increased
16.8% the number of taxpayers (in-
cluding companies) Increased 83.4%,
but the taxable Income of the tax-
payers DECREASED £608,097 (or
3.5%), while the tax payable IN-
CREASED £1,211,836 (or 257.3%).
On the other hand, in Victoria, dur-
ing the same period, population in-
creased by 8.4%, the number of tax-
payers increased 73.2%, the taxable
income INCREASED by £20,231,048
(or 88.2%) and tax payable Increased
£865,795 (or 175.6%). So that in
Victoria from an INCREASED tax-
able income of £20,231,048 the
people had only £865,795 more taken
from them, while the people of
Queensland from a DECREASED tax-
able income of £608,097 suffered
£1,241,826 of extra taxation. Had
Victorians been taxed the same as
Queenslanders, they would have paid
during the nine years to 1923/24,
£22,162,000 additional taxation. They
had that advantage—this sum was
available for development by private
enterprise, instead of being squan-
dered in unprofitable government en-
terprises, and otherwise wasted.
One of the best tests of the re-
sults of the administration of the
present government is to compare the
increases in value of production in
Queensland with the increases dur-
ing a similar period in the other
States. Owing principally to price
inflation, increases have been fairly
considerable In all the States, but
Queensland by this test, as by prac-
tically any other dependable test
since the present government as-
sumed office, shows to great disad-
vantage. The latest available com-
parative figures are as follows:
VALUE OP PRODUCTION PER
. HEAD OP POPULATION.
Average (all States) 42.22 68.28
Queensland in 1914 occupied prem-
ier position being £14.02 per head
of population above the average for
the Commonwealth. In 1924, Queens-
land’s position had fallen to second
last. .being £1.35 per head less than
the average.
Queensland’s Increase during the
above period of Labour rule was
£15.37 per head of population and
42.72 per cent. LESS than the aver-
age for all the States. If the increase
had been equal to the average, the
value of production in Queensland
for the year 1923/24 would have
been £12,465,128 greater than it was.
As compared with Victoria which
has practically never suffered a Lab-
our government, Queensland’s in-
crease in value of production was
£2O per head of population less than
it should have been, representing a
total shortage of approximately
£16,000,000 for one year. Here is
one reason why Victoria is on the
whole (leaving out a few seasonal
occupations) able to pay higher rates
of wages to employees, and at the
same time to carry on its govern-
ment with a much lower rate of tax-
ation.
Now let us take our secondary in-
dustries, and see the awful results
of shortsighted legislation and pub-
lic extravagance:—
VALUE OF OUTPUT OF FACTOR-
IES PER HEAD OF POPULATION.
The increase in value of output of
factories in Queensland was £16.33
less than the average increase and em-
ployment 'in factories per 10,000 of
population fell off to tire extent of
100 employees. Such results are det-
rimental to the State as a whole, to
the workers whose avenues of em-
ployment are narrowing and to the
primary producers who look to ex-
pansion in secondary industries to
provide them with an improved mar-
ket for their products.
According to Mr. Larcombe (Min-
ister for Railways), there is (me oth-
er fairly reliable method of gauging
the material welfare of the people
and that is the proportion of the
people who own savings bank de«-
posits, and the average amount of
deposit per head of population. The
figures are as follows:
SAVINGS BANK DEPOSITORS PER
10 000 OF POPULATION.

tlonately less depositors than any
State of the Commonwealth, but the
average deposit per inhabitant is
£lO/5/10 less than in Victoria and'
£5/13/5, less than the average for
all States.
Two other matters of very vital
Interest to the people are wages and
cost of living and these two are the
subject of many half truths and much
.misleading propaganda. In regard to
wages, I wish to point out that
Queensland’s apparent slight advan-
tage Is only due to the extraordin-
arily high rates of pay in certain in-
dustries, such as wool, meat and
sugar and these high rates are only
given because of the seasonal nature
of the employment. A fair basis of
comparison la to take the average
wages paid In industries or callings
which are common to all the States
and where conditions, economic and
otherwise, are the same. Factories
fulfil this requirement and i
to take the wages paid in factories
as a basis of comparison. The offic-
ial figures are as follows: —
AVERAGE WAGES IN SECONDARY
INDUSTRIES OP AUSTRALIA
(BOTH SEXES)
It will be seen from this that wages
In Queensland for both sexes are
£B/8/- per annum less than the av-
erage for all States and that the in-
crease since 1915 in Queensland has
been £4/12/3 less than the average.
Dealing now . with the important
subject of cost of living, I would point
out that in this respect Queensland
in 1914 showed to greater advantage
than any of the States of the Com-
monwealth. Since then the increase
in cost of living has been greatest
in Queensland.
The latest available figures show;
Percentage increase in cost of food
and groceries from July, 1914 to De-
cember, 1925: —
Queensland 65.3 per cent.
New South Wales 59.7 :
Victoria 57.2 ;
Tasmania 54.4 :
South Australia 46.9 :
West Australia 30.7 :
Before proceeding to the next por-
tion of my speech, I wish to em-
phasise that the figures which I have
quoted are official and I ask you to
base your judgment of Labour ad-
ministration upon facts rather than
upon abusive epithets, the appeals to
your prejudices, and the enticing
promises, which will he indulged in
by our opponents during, tiro courea
of the elections.
STATE ENTERPRISES.
I will now deal with the important
matter of State Enterprises, the in-
itial stage in the accomplishment of
the Labour objective—the socialisa-
tion of industry, production, distribu-
tion and exchange. I often wonder
what the socialists would say if we
were in power and tried our hands
at a bit of socializing, making a start
say on “The Daily Standard.” I am
afraid they would object; it is al-
ways the other fellow’s property that
they wish to socialise. Of course, we
have no such intention, but that
would be just as sensible as the soc-
ialisation of the cattle stations has
proved.
We would probably make just as
bad a job of running a socialistic
journal as the government has made
of running its State cattle stations.
In theory the principle of State
trading may seem quite innocuous
and even sound, but in actual prac-
tice I believe it to be both unsound
and harmful. Lord Macaulay in his
essay on “Gladstone on 1 Church and
State,” deals with Mr. Gladstone’s
contention that a function of civil
government is to use its influence
and funds in the promotion of the
religious belief of the State. He
uses the following argument:
“The question is not whether spir-
itual interests he or he not superior
in importance to temporal interests;
but whether the machinery which
happens at any moment to be em-
ployed for the purpose of protecting
certain temporal interests of a so-
ciety he necessarily such a machin-
ery as is fitted to promote the spir-
itual interests of that society. With-
out a division of labour the world
could not go on. It is of very much
more importance that men should
have food than that they should
have pianofortes. Yet it by no mewe
follows that every pianoforte-maker
ought to add the business of baker
to his. own; for, if he did so, we
should have - both much worse music
and much worse bread. It is of
much more importance that the know-
ledge of religious truth should he
widely diffused than that the art of
sculpture should flourish amongst us.
Yet it by no means follows that the
Royal Academy ought to unite with
its present functions those of the
Society for Promoting Christian
Knowledge. For the effect of such
folly would he that we should have
the worst possible Academy of Arts,
and the worst possible Society f,or
the Promotion of Christian Know-
ledge.” .
A similar argument to this is quite
applicable to the policy of State trad-
ing. Following the reasoning of the'
eminent essayist there is the proba-
bility that a government that enters
into the realm of trading will pro-
duce bad government and worse trad-
The present Government of
Queensland has produced that re-
sult. Bad government is evidenced
by exorbitant taxation, tremendous
borrowing, lessened production, re-
trogression in secondary industries
and record unemployment. The re-
sults of Its trading are nothing short
of ■ disastrous. To 30th June last the
various State Enterprises showed a
loss of £1,880,000 and the railway
department a loss of 12,370,000, mak-
ing a total loss of £14,250,000. The
total loss to present date is probably
in excess of £16,000,000. The_ de-
tailed results of State trading since
Its inception in Queensland are as

A sum of £1,312,588 has been writ-
ten off existing Enterprises and this
does not include the losses on vari-
ous enterprises which have ceased to
exist.
Apart from the losses incurred in
these State Enterpriser,, it must be
borne in mind that very little (If
any) extra employment has been cre-
ated by them. The Railway Refresh-
ment Rooms, the Butcher Shops, the
Stations, the Produce Agency, the
Cannery, the Fish Supply, the Saw-
mills, etc., if left In the hands of
private enterprise would have given
at least as much employment without
loss to the State. The coal mines,
generally speaking, are merely les-
sening the employment in privately
owned mines, and the few other min-
ing ventures are at present only af-
fording part time employment. There
is practically no benefit, but on the
other hand there is the loss of em-
ployment and the loss of develop-
ment which could have been created
if that £4,173,057 had been utilised
in such directions as reads, schools,
advances to settlers, workers dwel-
lings, &c., which come within the
true functions of government.
RAILWAY'S!
So much could be said about the
present condition of cur railways
that it ■ is really difficult to know
what to say. The pre/ious govern-
ment left a solvent and well main-
tained railway system, paying work-
ing expenses, interest o>i capital, and
a small profit in addition of £43.000.
To show what has happened since,
perhaps I had better quote the re-
sults for each year:—
You will notice In the first year
of Labour control a change from a
profit of £48,000 to a loss of £508,000.
These extraordinary losses cannot
he attributed to low freights and
fares. According to the Commission-
er’s Report the average revenue per
train mile run has increased from
6/43 in 1914/15 to 11/9 in 1924/25,
an increase of 83.7 per cent, and this
increase can only be due to increas-
ed fares and freights as the average
tonnage carried per train mile was
the same in both years, viz.: 0.41
tons. I am thoroughly satisfied that
under the present administration even
if the present fares and freights were
doubled, there would still be a deficit
in the railway accounts at the end
of the year.
There is no more striking illustra-
tion of the detrimental effect of the
present administration than is afford-
ed* by the railway figures. Note the
following:—
Percentages of increase as between
1914/15 and 1924/25 (remembering
that the latter year was one of the
best seasons on record): —

While the staffing of the railways
has kept pace with the increase in
population, the business has shown
practically no. increase. It must be
recognised that stations have to he
staffed and permanent way and oth-
er property maintained, irrespective
of the number of trains running, or
the business done. The. tragedy of
the railways is part and parcel •of
the general tragedy of this govern-
ment’s administration. The only
remedy is a policy and administra-
tion that will promote settlement and
encourage industries, thus increasing
the business of this department. A
continuation of the present drift can
only lead to one thing, general stag-
nation and retrenchment.
In regard to construction and main-
tenance I can do no better than make
a comparison from the official re-
norts.

On the question of maintenance of
permanent way, numerous accidents
are the most eloquent testimony of
the ndglect of the government In
this respect. In concluding this sub-
ject I merely wish to emphasise what
I have endeavoured to prove by mak-
ing the foregoing comparisons—that
this government is not a government
of development. It certainly is a
government that spends plenty' of
money, but it does not show results
for Its expenditure.
LOAN EXPENDITURE.
The spending of a large income
may be quite commendable when that
income is earned by capital put to
its most reproductive use, but when
it is dragged from the people in ever
Increasing amounts and is supple-
mented by excessive horrowing in
order that the spenders may retain
their popularity by being open-hand-
ed and generous, we can rest assured
that trouble and disaster will be the
inevitable result. We have in Queens-
land a government that squanders
public money, sacrifices its political
principles, and is jeopardising the in-
terests of the State, present and fu-
ture, for political gain. Could any-
thing more contemptible be Imag-
ined?
The following figures from the
Treasurer’s financial tables show the
trend of finance in Queensland since
the present Government assumed of-
fice:—
You will note that the rot set In
the first year of Labour government
(1915/16) and that even with the
bumper season we had in 1924/25 tho
net interest was 560 per cent, greater
than in 1914/15. For the last ten
years of the previous government the
total amount of interest payable out
of revenue was £4,354,000 while in
the following ten years of Labour
government it was £17,541,000. Is
It any wonder that our taxation is
necessarily the highest in Australia;
that in both primary and secondary
industries we cannot keep pace with
the other States; and that unemploy-
ment In Queensland has become a
problem which (except at election
limes) the present government is un-
able to solve.. I am afraid that fig-
ures are rather boresome to listen
to, but you will all realise the tre-
mendous importance of the occasion
and that it is my duty as far as pos-
sible to prove my contentions. I
know of no better (in fact, no other)
way of doing this satisfactorily than
publishing facts and figures from of-
ficial and reliable sources. On this
question of extravagant expenditure,
excessive taxation and its relation to
the employment of our workers, I
will place side by side the figures re-
lating to taxation and to unemploy-
ment relief, and you will see at oncq
the close connection there is between
the two: —
COST OP UN-
EMPLOYMENT
RELIEF.
TAXATION
Probably our opponents will cite
the Unemployment Insurance Act
as one of their beneficial
measures passed in the inter-
ests of the worker, but I would point
out that prior to Labour government
in Queensland unemployment was so
trifling that there was no need for
any such expensive scheme to deal
with it. The total cost of unemploy-
ment relief for the ten years prior
to 1915/16 was £75,450 as against
£945,428 expended by the present
Government. The effect of the Un-
employment Insurance Act has been
to transfer two-thirds of the respon-
sibility for unemployment relief from
the government on to the shoulders
of employers and employees. I be-
lieve this was the real object of the
measure. The collections from work-
ers and employers during the past
two years have amounted to £478,-
958. With unemployment reduced to
reasonable dimensions, such a sum
would go a long way towards solving
the problem of the upkeep of our
public hospitals. Now the question
for electors is—how much further on
the downward track is this State to
be allowed to rush? Are the people
going to stand apathetically by and
do nothing, or are they going to wake
up to the position and take an inter-
est, straighten their backs, and ex-
press their determination to make a
change. Can it be stopped? Of
course it can. Many of the channels
through which money is pouring can
be stopped. Private enterprise can
be encouraged instead of threatened
and harassed: concessions can be
made to assist in the opening up of
new industries Itiß they find their
feet; part of the credit of the State
can be usefully employed in assist-
ing in the building up of co-operative
enterprises to provide employment
and increase the wealth of the
people: economy can be practised in
the carrying out of public works by
getting them carried out in the most
economical way compatible with good
workmanship; land settlement can
he stimulated and encouraged by al-
lowing settlers to select land on the
tenure they want, rather than trying
to force them to take it on terms
which they object to; and farmers
can be allowed to carry on their own
business, in their own way, allowing
self Interest a chance to produce the
best economic results, instead of
compelling them to cultivate so much
land and grow specified crops at the
dictation of a government expert. We
have had 10 years of socialism, and
it has failed. The only real road to
prosperity and success Is the encour-
agement of Individual enterprise, In-
dustry and thrift; to encourage co-
operation so that the individual may
be assisted to secure the best re-
turn possible to encourage the In-
dividual to make the best use of
the gifts God has given Win; and to
pay for energy, brains, and skill.
Socialism destroys and hampers the
very qualities that make for progress.
It strangles ambition, discourages in-
dustry, and renders thrift useless. 1
have no intention of endeavouring to
purchase votes by outbidding the of-
fers of the Government; no method
has ever yet been discovered by
which man can be paid more than
he earns without someone else get-
ting less than he earns. Our policy
is to encourage Industry and thrift;
to help those who want to help them-
selves; to again place the govern-
ment of the country In a position
where respect and obedience will be
enforced, and where the elected re-
presentatives of the people will do
as their conscience directs free from
outside dictation, threats, and intimi-
dation. No section will be allowed
to flout the laws of the State, and no
one will be permitted to usurp the
functions of government. The gov-
ernment possess sufficient resources
to uphold the rights of the commun-
ity against any predatory section
which attempts to obtain by force
what Is deemed Impracticable by a
Court, and these resources will be
unhesitatingly used.
POLICY.
1. CONSTITUTIONAL : The first
subject I wish to deal with in the
programme we are setting out be-
fore you is In our opinion the most
important, and that is the restora-
tion of constitutional government in
this State, The experiment has been
tried here since 23rd March, 1922,
of government by a single chamber
and as In other places where a simi-
lar experiment has been tried, it has
proved a grim and ghastly failure.
As was foretold when the measure
was introduced, the proposals of the
administration occupying the Treas-
ury benches have gone through In
many cases without discussion. The
debates of Parliament have bean
transferred to another place where
'the public are barred and the utmost
secrecy is observed. Instead of
careful and studied deliberation be-
ing accorded to measures which
concern matters of vital moment to
tho progress and prosperity of the
.State, we have Bills brought in and
rushed through by a government
anxious to get into recess. The
people to be affected have little or
no chance of realising or under-
.?ta*r<Hn-sr -what th*> Pi. ll ? are, or what,
the effects are likely to he. The re-
sult has been ’ ill-considered and
hasty legislation requiring constant
amendment. We have seen legisla-
tion introduced, carried through all
its stages in one day, and passed,
at the dictation of outside irrespon-
sible bodies. We have seen Acts
placed upon the Statute Book which
responsible Ministers declared were
against the best interests of the
State and the people without check
or time for deliberation. Professor
Lcckie in his book, “Democracy and
Liberty,” says “Of all kinds, of gov-
ernment that are possible among
mankind, I do not know any which
is likely to he worse than the gov-
ernment of a single omnipotent cham-
ber. It is at least as susceptible as an
individual despot to the temptations
that grow out of the possession of an
uncontrolled power, and it is likely
to act with much less sense of re-
sponsibility and much less real de-
liberation. There Is certainly no
proposition in politics more indubit-
able than that the attempt to govern
a great heterogeneous Empire simp-
ly by such an Assembly must ultim-
ately prove disastrous, and the ne-
cessity for a second Chamber, to ex-
ercise a controlling,, modifying, re-
tarding, and steadying influence has
acquired almost the position of an
axiom.” When discussing the Bill
it was pointed out that to pass it
was to give power to the Caucus to
do that which is the reverse of true
democracy—-it would hand over to a
minority the right to rule, and this is
exactly what has happened. Had
there been a second Chamber in
Queensland!, parliament would not
have been able to he degraded and
humiliated in the way that it has
been. We should at least have had
a better chance, of living under par-
liamentary government instead of
MOB RULE. The present condition
of affairs is neither sensible nor safe.
Sir Henry Maine says, “What then
is expected from a well constituted
second chamber is not a rival infal-
libility, but an additional security.
It is hardly'too much to say that on
this view aMnost any chamber is
better than' none.” When the ques-
tion of the abolition of the second
Chamber was put to the people of
this State, the abolition was negat-
ived by 179,105 votes to 116,190, and
out of 72 electorates only 12 showed
a majority for abolition. Notwith-
standing this the government by se-
curing sufficient appointments to the
second Chamber of partizans pledged
to its abolition was able in 1922 to
flout the will of the people. Since
then we have had legislation that
crippled out credit and placed the
State in such an unenviable position
that retraction had to he made. We
have had legioltion enacted for the
sole purpose of allowing the govern-
ment to keep in office and we have
seen parliament prostituted and hu-
miliated and weakly pandering to
the threats of an irresponsible and!
law breaking section of the com-
munity. In a country which posses-
ses tho widest franchise in the
world, where every man and woman
over 21 has an equal voice in thd
government of the country, methods
that might he excusable under a
tyrannical despot can neither ha
tolerated nor pardoned. Such being
the case, we intend to re-establish
a second chamber consisting of 30
members. The electorates will be
arranged in five groups, each group
returning six members. Members of
this chamber will he elected for six
years, hilt after the first three years
half the members, will retire as in
the case of the Federal Senate. Tha
franchise will he the safene as in the
election of members of the Legisla-
tive Assembly.
2. ELECTORAL. The present
electoral boundaries are in many
cases a travesty of justice and we
advocate that parliamentry repre-
sentation should be in accordance
with the spirit of the Electoral Dis-
tricts Acts of 1910. Though we are
strongly of the opinion that every
person who Is entitled to vote should
bo on the electoral roll, we just ns
strongly believe that amendment Is
necessary in order that purification
of the rolls may be accomplished.
Voting is compulsory and we intend
to make contingent voting also com-
pulsory. We will also take steps to
bring about unification of State and
Federal electoral rolls.
3. LOCAL GOVERNMENT ; The
principle of adult franchise in Local
Authority elections is in our opinion
indefensible, and even more unjust is
it to allow those who will Incur no
liability, to vote on the question of
a loan for a particular area.To al-
low the possibility of those without
any responsibility placing a mortgage
on other people’s shoulders is abso-
lutely wrong both In theory and
practice. Representation without
taxation is just as unfair as taxa-
tbis without representation and aims
a blow at democratic government.
The policy of the government In
financing hospitals by a tax on the
unimproved capital value of land is
also inequitable and cannot he justi-
fied. The only fair basis for hos-
pital taxation Is on income, and we
will amend the Hospitals’ Act in that
direction. The position of the
house and land holders of the metro-
politan area, owing to the huge cost
of the water and sewerage works, Is
rapidly becoming an unenviable one,
if not intolerable. It Is too late to
rapidly becoming an unenviable one,
but It Is not too late to endeavour
to effect improvements for the fu-
ture. We are strongly of the opin-
ion that Instead of an elected Board
to carry out the -work, it would be a
more economical and more efficient
method to have a commission of ex-
perts carrying on this worn to' com-
pletlon. It is a work of sucn magni-
tude that political considerations
and fads should he eliminated. It
requires engineering ability, admin-
istrative capacity, and financial
knowledge and experience of the
first order and to allow amateurs to
experiment with fads ana, rival poli-
cies on a work of such vital moment
to the taxpayers is neither sensible
nor fair.
4. ROADS : Undoubtedly, one of
the most pressing problems we have
to face Is the question of good roads.
It must be recognised that traffic
has altogether changed, and roads
that were adequate for the ordinary
horse-drawn vehicle at comparative-
ly slow speeds are not adequate to-
day to carry motor vesicles of all
kincis at greater speeds than were
ever dreamt of in the past. All or
nearly all Local Authorities are
hampered by lack of funds ; con-
sequently, nothing but a system cf
patching Isi possible in most Shires
and this is neither economical nor
efficient. As the transport of goods
and passengers by motor is not
limited to the boundaries of one
Shire (such vehicles often travel
through a dozen or more) it Is es-
sential that part of the burden of
road making should be borne by the
government. We consider that a
loan of £2,000,000 for a start should
he secured so that Local Authorities
who have been making fruitless ap-
plication for loan money u» enable
them to do more lasting and effec-
tive work may be accommodated.
And seeing that the whole of the
registration fees frctn motor vehicles
is claimed by the Main Roads
Board, though in a large number of
shires no work is being carried out
or likely to be carried out by the
Board, and as the government have
invaded the Local Authorities’ sphere
of revenue by high land taxation,
we consider that portion or the in-
terest burden should be borne by
the State. The Main Roads Act re-
quires to be still further amended.
The burden on sparse populations in
the country of constructing, costly
main roads is too great, and as the
Federal government is’ contributing
generously towards their construc-
tion, we believe that they should be
built by the State and that main-
tenance only should be borne equ-
ally by the Local Authorities and the
State government.
5. IMMIGRATION: Immigration Is
in our opinion of vital importance to
this State and the reasons actuating
the governjment in refusing to sign
the favourable agreement with Great
Britain which has been eagerly ac-
cepted by Victoria and West Aus-
tralia appear to be more the result
of fear than offence wm ne taken
by a few industrialists rather than
sound economic common sense ones.
The advantage to a, State like
Queensland of a considerable amount
of reasonably cheap money for de-
velopment and settlement purposes
is so obvious as to be Peyondi argu-
ment, and when, in addition, there is
the oportunity to secure British im-
migrants anxious to make a home
for themselves, no selfish considera-
tions should be allowed to stand In
the way. The fear contin.ualy heard
expressed that these people are like-
ly to lower the standard of living Is
preposterous. More peoplle mean
greater production, better markets,
more wealth, more shouldeira to help
carry the burden. Of course,, no one
wants to throw open wide the door
for indiscriminate immigrants from,
unsuitable sources. But in this
agreement, we, know the source, and
are offered money on most advan-
tageous terms to assist in their ab-
sorption. ,
In my opinion, the outstanding
problem we have to solve is to in-
crease our population at a much
more rapid rate than at present. Our
White Australia policy can only he
preserved while we have the might
to enforce it and the recent Great
War should have taught us that the
day miay come (amd at no distant
date) when even the might of Britain
may not he sufficient for our protect-
ion. Our present population is to-
tally Inadequate for our defence, so
what better policy could we adapt
than the encouragement of the im-
migration of our own kith and Ida
from the mother-land. And when for
that purpose money is offered to us
at almost a nominal rate of interest,
delay is folly of a criminal nature.

6. LAND SETTLEMENT: The
Government has based Its land policy
on the principles laid down by theor-
ists and experimentalists, but theor-
ies do not always work out in the
Way that is expected. The Labour
policy of perpetual leasehold was
said to be the last thing in land leg-
islation, but it is a noticeable fact
that those who are the strongest ad-
vocates of perpertual leasehold for
the other fellow do not believe in it
for themselves The 1924 Act is a
masterpiece of folly. The idea was
to prohibit dummying, but the govern-
ment, through ignorance or perver-
sity, embodied in it principle* that
not only aimed at stopping dtfcnmy-
ing but slashed into the rights of
legitimate land settlement. The Act
la harassing nearly every selector in
the country In one way or another,
and the difficulties of a man securing
a selection who cannot command suf-
ficient cash of his own to stock It
are greatly increased: he would
search fruitlessly from daylight to
dark for someone to lend him money
with safety nnder -this latest Land
Act. This Government seems to taka
a particular delight In Interfering
with the man on the land, and It has
cost genuine selectors thousands of
pounds. The power in the hands cf
the Minister is absolute, and from
him there is no appeal, and the
whole thing lends itself to Influence
and wire pulling.
It should not be necessary for mo
to say It, but In view of the untrue
statements made by the Secretary
for Agriculture with regard to an ex-
isting agreement between the Oppos-
ition end the paatorallsts, that the re-
sumption falling due In 1927 will not
be gone on with, I wish to state em-
phatically that no such agreement ex-
ists, no understanding, In fact noth-
ing at all on which this gentleman
can base his statement. As opport-
unities arise advantage will be taken
to satisfy the demand for grazing
selections and sjrnend the 1924 Act,
so as to give those not fortunate
enough to hold largo amounts of cap-
ital an equal opportunity to secure,
develop, and stock a selection. The
Theodore (London) agreement grant-
ed to pastoral lessees who had been
wronged by the passing of the Re-
pudiation Act exemption from re-ap-
pralsement of rent after May 30,
1924. We intend to grant a similar
concession to grazing selectors. The
decrease In Land Settlement In this
State shrieks aloud for explanation:

la agricultural settlement the whom
basis Is wrong; the Idea should not
be to drag as much revenue out of
tjib settlers as Is possible, but how
(many people may be successfuly set-
tled On the land. The perpetual
lease fetish of the government has
two vital disadvantages. The first
IS that it throws the whole cost of fi-
nancing settlers on to the government
(Agricultural Bank), as the security
is not looked upon as attractive by
anyone else. And as the agricultural
Bank has Insufficient funds to meat
the demands, settlers are handicap-
ped, their difficulties increased, their
efforts cramped, and they are starved ,
and dsheartened. The second dis-
advantage Is that in nine cases out
of ten the settler dislikes the tenure,
and prefers to go elsewhere, where
sucessful settlement Is considered of |
s:ew tnedreticai politicians. The sag- j
geetion that It is better for uis set- j
tier is all moonshine. Take the case i
of a man prior to this Government '
selecting as an Agricultural Farm a
block valued at 10/- per acre. He ;
paid 3d per acre per annum for 20 .
years and then the balance and it j
was his own; or he could make It j
freehold any time after live years up- j
on fulfilling certain conditions. Sim- j
liar land would now be valued at 30/- ,
or more and at 11% the settler pays I
sd. per acre for 15 years, and then
has to submit to re-appralsement and
the place is never his own. The
most successful close settlement we
ever had in Queensland was when the
Homestead Selection clauses were
In operation; when a man could sel-
ect 160 acres at 2/6 per acre, fulfil
certain residence conditions, and con-
ditions of improvement, pay 3d. per
acre for 10 years and the land was
his. We propose to again make
those clauses operative, our object
being successful settlement rather
than revenue. We propose to allow
settlers to secure land under the ten-
ure they want, either freehold or
leasehold or perpetual lease. Provis-
ion will be made for the conversion
of existing perpetual leases to free-
hold tenure where desired. Provision
will also be made for remission or
reduction of the present 10 per cent,
fine for late payment of rentals where
such is warranted.
7. PRICKLY PEAR: Although ef-
forts are being made to check the
spread of tbo prickly pear, and, where
it Is In Isolated areas to also clear .
them, the huge area already Infested :
constitutes a problem that cries aloud
for solution. Prom time to time
statements are published that power
alcohol can be manufactured from i
the pear, and as the manufacture of
such product would certainly be of i
vast benefit to the State, and possibly j
be effective in pushing the pest fur-1
ther and further back, It Is proposed j
to offer a reward of £5OOO to the in- |
dividual who first produces 100 gallons
of power alcohol from prickly pear
on an economically sound and com-
mercial basis, that is, at a price that
would enable its manufacture on a
large scale to be profitable. At the pres-
ent time, in case of reduction of cap-
ital values of Agricultural Farms by
the Prickly-pear Land Commission,
overpayments are merely credited to
the final payment of purchase mon-
ey. It is proposed that such over-
payments be made available in re-
duction of annual rents as they be-
come due.
8. FORESTRY: The absolute nec-
essity for a forestry policy has been ,
stressed for years. At the present
time the Forestry department !s ,
looked upon merely ns a means for ,
producing revenue, an indirect met.h- .
od for dragging the greatest possible
amount of money out of the people ,
who want to build a house or use tlm- ■
her in any other way. The revenue ,
and receipts from timber sales for ,
the past 5 years and the expend itur 3 ,
arc as follows; — .
RECEIPTS. EXPENDITURE ,
Bo In the effort to secure revenue
the man making a home tor himself
is heavily taxed; he and his
children will have to face excess-
ively high costs of timber through
depleted timber resources, and also
pay Interest on the loan money be-
ing expended on re-afforestation, in
order that the government of to-day
(may be open-handed and generous.
We Rend to inaugurate an extensive
ro-afforestetlon scheme to supplement
and conserve the timber resources of
the State and a reduction of royalty
or stumpage on a more equitable
basis. For . years Labour members
when they were the Opposition told
the people that they were being ex-
ploited by a timber ring, and that when
In power they would establish saw
mills and rescue the people from the
tentacles of this octopus. But what
do we find? Every rise In Utnber
prices is caused by the State and ac-
cepted as Inevitable and people
wanting to build homes are exploited
more than ever before. We of course,
recognise that It Is essential that
adequate forest areas should be re-
served to the State, but It Is open
to question whether the whole of
the areas at present gazetted as for-
est reserves have been carefully
classified, and It Is by no means cer-
tain that' portion of the areas would
not be of Infinitely greater economic
value to the State If thrown open lo
agricultural selection. The re-class-
Ificatlon requires to be carefully
done, and all the conditions given
the fullest consideration. We Intend
to have such reclassification made
at the earliest opportunity.
9. SOLDIER SETTLEMENTS:
With regard to Soldier Settlements,
unpleasant facts have got to be faced.
At the time the settlements were
undertaken, prices for most things
required were sky high. In many
cases, not only was the land unsuit-
able in the areas made available for
settlement, but the returned men
were not really physically fit for the
arduous and continuous work in-
volved. The difficulties they had
to face were In many cases Insuper-
able. As things are, the State stands
to lose a considerable amount on
these settlemehts. In many cases
the settler Is unable to make enough
to pay off his liability, and gets
disheartened and walks off. In this
way the State loses the settler and
most of the advance as well. It
would be better to face the facts, re-
cognising that a loss Is inevitable. We
propose to appoint Boards consist-
ing of local men with practical ex-
perience of the class of work car-
ried on, and the class of land In the
district, and have a thorough invest-
igation made. The Boards will make
recommendations as to whether the
areas are large enough, or should be
increased, whether the amount owing
can be reasonably met under average
conditions, and, if not, as to how
much should be written off, thus giv-
ing to those who have stuck to their
land, a reasonable chan ;e of decent
living conditions. It Is better to face
a loss and keep the settler than lose
the settler and still have the loss.
Special provision will be made for
sollder Settlers, where they so de-
sire, to acquire the freehold of {heir
blocks. <l l ■ft
10. PRIMARY (PRODUCTION: Wo
propose In regard to primary product-
ion—(l) The re-organisation of the
Department of Agriculture so as to
obtain the most efficient, scientific,
and practical direction and adminls
i tration, and the highest efficiency
In production. The day has
passed when the farmers’ task was
confined within the boundaries of
his farm. His prosperity depends
j more on what goes on outside his
: 1-.r:n than upon Ms own efforts in the j
S fields and in the dairy. No amount of.
| skilful planting ana hard work can
| make up for a (market that goes
• wrong. The time has come when
farmers must not rest content when
: their crops are produced. They must
j take it to the markets of the world,
j A system of controlled marketing is
| essential, but one method is not sult-
; able to all products. Where pools
| are decided by the growers concerned
j to be in their best interests, we ba-
| lieve that only representatives of
the growers concerned should have
a place on the pool board. They are
really co-operative marketing associa-
tions, and government or consumers’
representation on such boards will
not be tolerated. In other cases,
where a system of control Is exer-
cised as in the Cheese Pool, and the
trade conducted through the usual
channels of commerce, every assist-
ance will be given by legislation and
finance to assist in its success, so
that the producer may be able to
control the selling end of hi® busi-
ness as well as the producing end.
We have decided on the continuance
and development of the Primary Pro-
ducers’ Organisation Act, taking the
necesary steps to free it from gov-
ernment control or dictation in any
way. We will also liberalise the as-
sistance to be given to co-operative
enterprise. In an endeavour to as-
sist farmers to carry on their busi-
ness as efficiently and economically
as possible, it will be necessary lo
establish a rural credits’ scheme. The
Council of Agriculture has gone ex-
: tensively into this matter, and has
; made recommendations, but rural
credit schemes have, up to the pres-
ent, only been used as window dress-
ing and as a bait to catch the votes
of the necessitous producers. To any
one with a long experience of the
; needs and necessities of the producers
ian effective rural credits’ scheme
I for the production, harvesting and
marketing of primary products, is
recognised to be of paramount im-
portance .
The agricultural and dairy fartner
Is constantly and continually en-
gaged in an unequal .struggle with
nature. They and the®- wives and
families work long hours and are
paid only for what they produce, not
for time put in or work done, con-
sequently they have Irrefutable
claims for special consideration. Ow-
ing to the protective policy of the
Australian Commonwealth and th e
high cost involved in the production
cf many primary products, in order
to develop certain specified indust-
ries, it will be necessary in some
rases to provide for export bounties
until such industries become fiitmy
established. It will be a more profit-
able investment to bring money to
the State in payment for exported
products than to be continually in-
creasing the amount of our annual
borrowing In order to enable our
commit(ments to-be met. It is ac-
cepted as almost an axiom that suc-
cess on the land without an adequate
supply of water is impossible, and
the provision of such is consequently
of vital importance. It is therefore
proposed to give greater assistance
to settlers to provide water and
pumping and storage facilities on
easy teums.
Having encouraged settlement in
fruitgrowing and agricultural areas.
It is the duty of the government tc
protect such settlers as far as pos-
sible from accidents over which they
have no control. For instance, a
whole fruit company may he destroy-
ed in an hour by a hail storm. As no
data Is available for an insurance
company to adequately estimate the I
risks, the premiums are made suflic
iently high to be on the safe side.
A fair pretaium should be decided up-
on and any risk over that shouldered
by the government. Then after a
few years the actual risks could be
computed on an exact basis.
In a country a great part of whose
national wealth is provided by the
de-pasturing, of sheep and cattle, ade-
quate facilities for travelling stock
to market In some seasons, and for
relief in others, Is an economic nec-
essity. Huge losses occur from
time to tsne owing to the impassahil-
ity of the stock routes through' inad-
equate water supplies. It Is there-
fore proposed to carefuly go into
this question and assist in the provis-
ion of such supplies on the stock ar-
teries.
The acquirement along existing
railway lines of suitable freehold
■areas for mixed farming or closer
settlement purposes ig a matter that
will receive Immediate attention. There
Is a large area of land: suitable for
mixed farming so situated which is
not being put to its best use. Much
of it is being allowed to becotae use-
less from a settlement point of view
and also a menace to surrounding
holders. Advantage will be taken
of the powers conferred upon the gov-
ernment to resume such areas with a
view of promoting closer settlement
and increased business for our rail-
ways.
11. SUGAR INDUSTRY: The Sugar
Industry is of vital importance to
Quensland and to Australia and as
this is only part of the British ESn-
plre in which sugar is being grown
by white labour under conditions laid
down by a Court, it is necessary that
special consideration should l*a-given
to It. Our proposals are as follows:
(1) Support of the Commonwealth
Government in the continuance of
the embargo upon sugar produced by
coloured labour and/or any means
(hat will secure for the cane grow-
ers a fair retu. n for his labour and
capital Invested. A living wage for
the worker employed in the industry,
and a reasonable return to the mill-
er.
(2) A continuance of the present
system of arbitration between grow-
ers and millers in conectlon with
the prices to be paid for sugar cane,
and the conditions relating to har-
vesting as laid down by the present
“Regulation of Cane Prices Act.”
(3) In view of the difficult position
that has arisen through what is
termed over-production, every assist-
ance will be given to enterprises that
seem likely to profitably utilise cane
that is not required to produce sugar
for Australian consumption. Not only
will the growth on cane farms of
other crops suitable for distillation,
be encouraged, and the transport on
the railways of mollasses Intended
for conversion into industrial alcohol
receive every facility, but keen re-
search will be undertaken Into the
possibilities of economically convert-
ing surplus cane juice Itself into
this article.
(4) All other methods of assisting
the industry by conversion of waste
and bye-products into commercial ar-
ticles will be the object of the clos-
est scrutiny and scientific research.
(5) Everything posisble will be
done to place the milling of the cane
on a really co-operative basis.
(12) COTTON: The Cotton In-
dustry has ben sadly handicapped by
the anti-ratoon clauses of the Cotton
Industry Act of 1923, were re-
tained despite the strenuous efforts
of the growers themselves and: the
Opposition in Parliament to have them
eliminated. Here is yet another sam-
ple of the dictatorial methods of the
present government In its legislation:
era, 1 reel quite certain that the co-
on indusry would have been in a
much more flourishing condition,
and the production gf cotton much
greater than it is. To avoid similar
interference in the future, the grow-
ers have since asked: for de-control
by the State and have appealed to
the Federal Government for a bounty
to take the place of the guarantee
system which terminates at the end
of this season. This matter is now
being arranged. It must be recog-
nised that in the case of a product
such as cotton, which is chiefly grown
under cheap labour conditions, and:
the price of which fluctuates so
greatly from time to time, the future
of the indusry is largely dependent
upon the manufacture of the lint
into comjmerclal articles in Australia.
It is satisfactory to note that the
Federal Governmen are taking steps
towards this objective. Our policy
offers to cotton growers the control
of ginning and of the sale of their
lint, seed and by-prducts,, by co-oper-
ative associations of growers, and
assistance will be given to such as-
sociations for this acquisition or er-
ection of necessary plant.
(13) MINING, OIL & HYDRO-HI,-
iECTRIC SCHEMES: The Govern-
ment has a large amount of money
sunk in mining industries in North
Queensland showing a prodigious loss.
To ecourage the industry and at the
same time minimise the loss must
be attempted. An independant and
comprehensive investigation by com-
petent geological and mining experts
must be undertaken. Proper and
systematic prospecting under co)n-
petent geological direction is also
essential. Hydro electric works to
utilise the power provided by nature
are of paramount Importance in or-
der that that cheap power may be
available. In connection, with mining
and zinc separation works in partic-
ular this would be invaluable. We
realise the tremendous possibilities
connected with the supply of cheap
electrical power and all avenues will
be thoroughly exploited. The Barron
Falls in North Queensland: suggests
itself as the most likely proposition,
and this will receive our
attention. In addition, it is proposed
to appoint an Electrical Commission
for the purpose of investigating all
possible sources of electrical supply,
for the co-ordination of effort, and the
institution of a system of largo power
stations.
With regard to oil it must be recog-
nised that its disco very would be a mo-
mentous event in the history of our :
State. It is essentia! that all data
in the possession of the Mines Da- :
partment should be mace available
for public information and that every :
encouragement should be given to
capital to seek for it.. The locking :
up of 3,600 square miles of the most
promising country as a government
reservation, and the policy adopted
of doing nothing and allowing no one b
else to do anything must be condemn-
ed by everyone who has the interests i
of the State at heart. Our policy will (
be o encourage and assist prospect- (
ing for oil by every means in our i
power and while protecting the in-
terests of the State, allow the fullest 1
possible scope to private enterprise. <
(14). INDUSTRIAL; We stand for :
the principle of Industrial Arbitration
and Conciliation and we believe that 1
there should he a Minister for Lab- ]
our. It must bo realised, how- (
ever, that besides the two recognised 1
carties in an industrial dispute, the
public have a vital interest, and it 1
s absolutely essential that adminis- t
ration of the law should be such as <
to ensure bservance by both
sides. We ; e that the law must
be upheb all costs. We also
. believe in rie widening of the
opportunity for boys to learn
trades, ar.'i, as the State sub-
sidises t ;; education of youths
, in Hig ' Schools, Grammar
Schools, e 5 vo are prepared, In
; order to v .he opportunities for
■ the learn: g of trades, to subsidise
■ industries ~-i & similar manner where
necessary bring about Increas-
■ ed praetk. training for our youths.
We als< consider that It Is quite
. wrong for parliament to nrsurp the
i functions ot the court, and undoubt-
. edly the present system is Inequß-
. able and stupid. The method should
be recast. Sbme consideration should
: be given to the requiremenas of the
i wage earner with a family to sup-
• iport, in other words, there should
: be a system of child endowment.:
. This, however, Is esentially a nation-
■ al question, and we will co-operate
i with the Federal Government in an
l endeavour to introduce a child en-
. dowment scheme which is economlc-
■ ally sound. Surely everyone must
; recognise the futility and dishonesty
i of promising child endowment in
. any one State. It could only be done
. by a reduction of present wages or
: by Increased taxation. Either meth-
. od would prove detrimental to the
poorer people of the community. Of
. course I know that the cry will bo
j raised that should we be successful
, at the polls be result will be a re-
duction of wages: but as I have
' stated, the fixation of wages will he
, the functions of the Arbitration
. Court, not Parliament. I have already
' shown that wages are higher In Vic-
toria which has not suffered Labour
Government than they are in
Queensland,
) The obj. of the party (to use
s a familiar cession Is not to bring
_ about th' nfall of the present
[ so-called a itallstlc system hut to
, bring that, system (evolved througli
hundreds of years and workable) to
’ its highest state of perfecion. We
do no want to establish a high water
. mark above which no man may rise,
] but a low water mark below which
’ no man will be allowed to fall. It Is
an incontrovertible fact that both
’ capital and labour have their own
’ functions and are each indispensable
1 in the multifarious activities of any
people. There is need, nowever, for
\ greater co-operation between capital
1 and labour —the double functions of
‘ capital and labour should be united.
- each Interested In th© other and
; each pull kg in the same direction
’ for mutr .1 benefit. Only when em-
\ ployees have a direct interest In the
■ profits of capital In addition to their
L wages, will there be a proper appre-
i elation < the difficulties and the
value it capital. The present-dav
1 tendency go-slow” and to dis-
regard ths Interests of the employer
1 will be replaced by the will to (give
the great effort combined with the
1 greatest .clency. Under the system
I have in floated, greater effort will
■ result, economics will be effected, an
! intelligent interest will be taken by
' all in the welfare of industries and
businesses and the calamity cf
strikes will be largely eliminated.
| Socialism, which tends to bring the
1 majority down to a dead level of
spiritles s i s efficiency (the masses be-
■ ing prey: . ,>on by those who have
no quaikvfttions but facility of
speech, and ascrupulous and pre>-
datory desiyaa upon their fellow
men) has r thing to recommend It.
Under any system, human nature
decrees 'here must always be
different? of wealth as there are
difference physical and mental
capacity. it: only system that cau
I build up great ration Is one that
or', - ■ aml-yjon which
j is* the raiaspring of ail progress -
The charge to the coo* alive
system ot be brought about
in a da if the the party is re-
turned to power, a definite start will
he mad it is confidently expect-
ed, subetasWa-: progress will be made
within the course of a very few
years. It i. proposed to make funds
available assist groups of work-
ers to cv.'.'rrh or acquire their own
industries ; a co-operative basis,
to enconr shareholding by employ-
ees, and «k» all other methods of
profit si . bonuses and payment
by result' which workers will
be given direct pecuniary incentive
to give of Ihslr best In the industries
or undertakings in which they are
engaged.
The encouragement of co-operation
in business, profit-sharing, and share
purchase sthetnes are not by any
means new, but are In operation in
many of the most successful business
undertakings in the Commonwealth.
In Bulletii No. 17, issued by th©
Advisory Council of Science and In-
dustry, many successful instances of
industrial co-operation are descrlo-
ed, and we wish to see production
and output increased by every op-
portunity and encouragement beilng
given to this method.
The result of such systems must
he to the mutual benefit of capital
and labour alike and of all the people
of the State. More increases of
wages on paper and price fixing have
failed.
Our industrial policy includes; —
(a) Maintenance of a strictly im-
partial Arbitration Court.
(b) Abolition of the present
board of Trade and Arbitration,
which, being partisan, is merely a
travesty of British judicial methods.
It was brought into being by a .
stricken go’ rnment from pm
party motlv A tribunal so con ]
ceved cannot Inspire that confidence
which is th first essential for the
successful ctioning ot any Court.
As a mate) of fact, it is generally re-
garded with ridicule and contempt.
(c) Encouragement of conciliation
and co-operation between employer
and employee, especially agreements
having as their basis shareholding
by employees, profit-sharing and bon-
us systems and any other methods
likely to stimulate efficiency and
promote harmonious working in in-
dustry; also, special rewards tor
efficiency.
(d) The principle of preference to
unionists to be retained (where
granted by the Court), subject to the
following:—
(I) That compulsory dues or lev-
ies shall not be used in aid of any
political party or party political
publication.
(II) A worker debarred from join-
ing a Union shall have the right to
work without membership.
(III) That a reasonable time shall
be allowed after securing employ-
ment for payment of union dues.
(IV) That a Worker shall be re-
quired to hold only one union ticket
during any one year—the ticket cov-
ering the employment in which he is
mainly occupied.
(e) . No overlapping of awards. A
Union which elects to go to the Fed-
eral Court shall be debarred from
approaching the State Court.
(f) Government employees shall
have the same rights as other em-
ployees—access to the Arbitration
Court free from all limitations or em-
bargos.
(g) Arbitration Court Awards to
have the force of law, as judgments
of any other Co I, and to be rigor-
ously and in Uly enforced.
(h). We propose that Instead of
, large sums of loan money being
i squandered for party political gain,
: the expenditure of loan funds 1 shall
as far as is possible be arranged to
coincide with the periods of the
i year when the big seasonal Indust-
• ries such as wool and sugar are not
operating. The object of this will
,bo to provide continuity of employ-
i merit for workers engaged In the
i seasonal Industries, thus retaining
In Queensland much ot the money
which is at present taken away t o
the Southern States.
■ (1). On 19th August last, the Dir-
ector ot the Queensland Producers’
Association, radio broadcasted a
message In which he pointed out that
"on the basis of data adduced (by
i the Council of Agriculture), It is be-
lieved that it Interest on capital ex-
, penditure Is provided for, about one-
tbird of our agriculturists In Queens-
• land arc showing a loss and about
i ono-third are earning only about £3
per week.” Yet in January last, Mr.
W. J. Dunstan ( a Member of the
Board of Trade and Arbitration)
; mado a report to the thlrtenth dele-
gate meeting of the A. W. U. In
i which he claimed "that an award
i should be made for employees in
■ the rural and cotton Industries.” We
■ strongly opposed the recent amend-
i ment ot the Arbitration Act to In-
: elude the rural Industries, and we
s propose to re-enact the clause ex-
S eluding them.
(15) PUBLIC SERVICE: To se-
i cure an efficient and effective public
i service we consider that it should
. bo removed entirely from political
• Interference and Influence and the
■ rc-establishment of departmental cou-
■ trol Is essential. There should be
i Boards of Inquiry and Appeal, but to
obtain what the public are supposed
to pay for, management by the De-
: partmental beads Is essential. As
; far as salaries, wages and conditions
i of employment are concerned, I have
already stated that these matters will
i be left entirely to the Arbitration
. Court and that there will be no limi-
• tations or embargoes npon the juris-
, diction of that Court with respect to
public employees. Classifications,
i salaries, wages and conditions will
remain as fixed by the Court or
agreed upon.
(16) EDUCATION: We intend lo
establish Chairs ot Agriculture, Mem-
, cine, and Law, as they become war-
ranted in connection with our unlver-
; sity. There is very great need fo>
hotter school and residence accom-
iviodStion especially in country dis-
tricts. At present parents of famil
ies who are struggling to earn a liv
ing in the more sparsely settled dis-
tricts have in many cases to provide
a school themselves before their
children can receive the education to
which they are entitled. The over
crowding in many of our schools is a
tragedy; neither children nor teach-
ers being given a fair chance. This
trouble is largely due to the day lab-
our fetish ot this Government.
Schools which could be built for
quite a small amount by local resi-
dents often cost four or five times as
much when eventually- constructed
under the day labour system by men
sent from other centres. Political
interference as well as any kind of
dictation from outside is to be strong-
ly condemned and will not be per-
mitted. The extension of rural and
vocational classes and the technical
college system Is greatly to be de-
sired, the opportunities eagerly seiz-
ed by the children for attending such
being ample proof of their usefulness
and attractiveness. It Is the duty of
a government as far as possible to
equalise the opportunities of children
of rich and poor and city and coun-
try parents, and our efforts will be In
that direction.
(17) STATE TRADING: As a de-
finite policy we are opposed to state
trading, but as many trading ven-
tures have been established, each
must be considered and dealt with
on its merits In regard to its econ-
omic aspect and any public benefit
accruing from It. All profits will be
devoted to redemption and the fin-
ances of State enterprises completely
separated from the general revenue
and from each other. We are irre-
vocably opposed to speculation with
public funds. The glowing prophes-
ies that were Indulged In by the gov-
ernment when plunging wildly into
these socialistic ventures have prov-
ed false, and theories have been shat-
tered, while the public have had to
pay the price of rash experimenta-
tion. I have already quoted the loss-
es of the various enterprises amount-
ing to the huge sum of £1,885,000:
the failure has been collossal and
complete. The only sensible thing
now is to withdraw from those that
are a continual drain on the finances
as opportunities offer, and with as
small a loss as is possible under the
circumstances.
(18) RAILWAYS: Even the most
generous minded supporters of the
government must feel chagrin at the
position of the railways. The ser-
vices are worse than they were 20
years ago. To accumulate a loss of
£12,000,000 in 10 years, while show
ing decreased conveniences to the
public, inadequate rolling stock to
handle the traffic, and shocking ne-
glect in the transport of dairy pro-
ducts and stock cannot be looked
upon complacently. There are sev-
eral things that must be done. It is
proposed to have a thorough and in-
dependant investigation made with a
view of arresting the huge annual de-
ficits and Improving the railway ser-
i vice. The Management must be en-
, ■ ely removed from political inter-
nee and influence and those in
responsible positions in the service
must be given adequate support.
The use of motor trains has
proved an unqualified success in
other States. They are efficient,
economical, and an eminently satis-
factory business proposition, the cost
of running such trains being about
33% of the ordinary locomotive
drawn trains.
At present most country branch
lines are provided with a service
which prohibits its use to the fullest
extent owing to its slowness and the
inconvenient running of the trains.
The motor train is no longer an ex-
periment, but Is an astonishing suc-
cess in at least two other States and
it is high time that Queensland adop-
ted a similar service. Unfortunate-
ly there are many existing lines that
terminate in dead ends and that con-
sequently are less useful to the pub-
lican and less economical to the De-
partment than they should he, and
so are instrumental in contributing
to a much heavier loss than would
otherwise be the case. It is proposed
to link up such dead ends as soon
as it becomes financially possible tc
do so.
We believe that the electrification
of the suburban railways should be
given the fullest consideration. The 1
economy in running, the cleanliness, (
and the quickness of transit, would i
overcome to a large extent many of
the present difficulties of poor ser- :
vices and wretched overcrowding. I
Superannuation for Railway Em-
ployees—These State employees are (
about the only ones not provided with ]
a superannuation scheme. Some <
years ago in Mr. Kidston’s time such (
a scheme was propounded, but was
withdrawn at the request of the rail- t
'way men" as they considered that ,
they had a better scheme. Nothing
has been done, however, except that
the government has legislated to fix
the retiring age of employees at 65
years, but it has made no provision
for their maintenance after this age
has been reached.
Suggestions have been made that
lines at present under construction
will be discontinued. I may say that
such suggestions are made for poli-
tical purposes, and are quite un-
founded.
(19) FINANCIAL ADMINISTRA-
TION; Socialists though most scath
ing in their denunciation of extrava-
gance and financial mismanagement
under other administrations appear to
be governed by only one considera-
tion when in office, and that Is how
best the money can be expended to
keep them In power, without regard
to public benefit or the burden of
taxation imposed upon the people.
Object lessons are available the
world over which teach us how high
taxation cramps enterprise' and ren-
ders development impracticable.
Money that should he going Into ex-
tension of industries and providing
further employment' la diverted Into
the Treasury, there to be squandered
by Incompetent and callous politic-
ians. Under present conditions, who
would expect money to he invested
in this State? With the present leg-
islative interference in matters which
are the functions of the Arbitration
Court, and the highest taxation in
Australia what encours~cment is
there to investors in in ustrles? As
a matter of fact, capital is being
turned away from Queensland and
Industries (both primary, and sec-
ondary) are gradually rU, nating.
The rakes progress Is easily traceable
as the track left is wide—neglected
country towns where houses are
pulled down and disappear, decreas-
ing country population, deserted
farms, delapidated improvements,
spread of noxious weeds, stagnating
industries, and unemployment are
everywhere apparent.
Practically £40,000,000 of loan
money expendeu in Queensland Is ab-
solutely non-productive, and during
the past ten years over 12/- of every
pound of taxation has gone fh pay-
ment of losses on loan works and
services. When a private individual
finds that he is going to have a huge
deficit in his finances at the end of
a year, he looks around to see in
what way the loss can be minimised,
whether money is being spent in di-
rections from which no adequate re-
turn Is coming; what leaks can be
stopped, and whether by a re-ar-
rangement of his business, better re-
turns can be secured. The method
of this Government is to borrow
more money ana use it for paying off
the losses. The result of such a pol-
icy is Inevitable and I feel quite sure
of my ground when I say that suc-
ceeding generations of Queensland-
ers will curse the day that a Labor
Government secured the reins of of-
fice In this State. Our policy, put-
ting it as briefly as possible, is to
live wßhin our income, and in ex-
penditure of loan moneys to consider
only the interests of the State.
POLICY GENERALLY; There are
many other matters which in the
time at my disposal I have not been
able to deal with but the electors can
rest assured that our sympathies are
with those who are doing the pioneer
ing work in our industries (both prim-
ary and secondary) and also with
those whether living in city, town, or
country, who are endeavouring by
thrift and industry to help themselves
to attain a greater degree of comfort
than they have at present.
A few of the miscellaneous matters
which will receive our attention are;
HOMES FOR THE PEOPLE.
One of the main requisites for a
happy and contented people is the
provision of a simple and economi-
cal method, by which a man may se-
cure his own home. It is essential
that the Inadequate .lousing accom-
modation, particularly in the cities,
be remedied as far as possible, and
we intend bringing this desirable ob-
jective within the reach of a con-
siderably wider circle by amending
the Workers’ Dwellings Act in the
direction of liberalising the initial
deposit. In some parts of Queens-
land, especially the sugar districts ot
the North, hotel accommodation is
altogether inadequate. It is proposed
to make provision for additional 11c
enses being granted in such cases
only, in order that the present ser-
ious position may be overcome. A
local Option majority will, of course,
first be required.
WATER CONSERVATION.
In a state that is subject to period-
ical droughty conditions, and conse-
quent severe losses to the whole com-
munity, an effective policy of water
conservation is essential —not alto-
gether so much by one . vast expen-
sive undertaking but by smaller and
less ambitious undertakings in var-
ious parts of the State, the main
points to be considered being close-
ness to market, suitability of coun-
try, and that areas to be served will
give the greatest and most widely
spread benefit and relief at a reas-
onable cost.
MISCELLANEOUS.
The State Insurance business will
be continued and the whole question
closely studied in an endeavour to
liberalise benefits in cases of injury,
so that compensation may be more in
conformity with what has been laid
down as constituting a living wage.
There will be a review ot all laws
relating specially to women with
a view to bettering their conditions,
and an increase in the allowances to
natural and foster mothers, as those
at present fixed entail unnecessary
hardship and struggle on those least
able to bear it.
We intend to heartily co-operate
with the Federal government in its
scheme of National Insurance, cover-
ing sickness, injury, unemployment
and etc. believing that in the end
this will prove the best method that
can be adopted.
Conclusion.
Having now stated our policy as
fully as possible in the time at my
disposal, I wish now to stress the
fact that the differences between the
policies of the two parties are great
and that the result of your voting at
this election will have a vital effect j
on the welfare of our State. I will
now state a few of the more marked
differences between the policies of
the two parties:—
(1) We believe in constitutional
government in its true sense, a rep
resentative of the King, the Legis-
lative Council and the Legislative As-
sembly.
The Government has adopted the
policy of a single House with no
check or control over its actions, and
the chief Justice as the imperial link.
The danger of such a system of gov-
ernment must be apparent to any-
thinking person.
(2) We believe tnat the duty of the
government is to govern and not to
trade.
The government believes in the
creation and continuation of State
Enterprises, irrespective of the finan-
cial loss incurred by the State in
carrying them on.
(3) We believe in the Government
upholding and administering the law
without favouritism, victimisation, or
r discrimination, and without reference
t to persons or class, and that laws
: should be administered impartially
] and resolutely.
i The government shuts one eye
j when enforcement of the law might
lose it political support or Incur the
t wrath of the Trades Hall dictators,
i (4). We believe that merit, efflic-
t iency, and superior ability should be
- the main factors in determining pro-
- motion in the public service.
The Government believes In sen-
■ lorlty and “spoils to the victors.”
(5) We believe in payment by re-
■ suits for skill and industry.
l The Government believes in pay-
) ing for time put In irrespective of
- output.
/ (6) We believe that every boy, who
3 desires to do so, should be allowed
1 to learn a trade.
t The government countenances and
. encourages absurd restrictions.
3 (7) We believe in assisting the in-
i dividual to secure the best return for
his labour by assisting and encour-
aging co-operation, profit-sharing, etc.
The government declares for nat-
ionalisation and eventually socialis-
:: ation, which brings everyone down to
1 a dead level of inefficiency and pov-
erty.
d (8) We believe that the only way
1 to secure progress and prosperity is
- by encouraging individual enterprise,
i industry, and thrift.
i The government believes in the
i socialisation of all means of produc-
s tion, distribution, and exchange,
s Whether the methods are by dir-
; ect confiscation or by the slower
( process of taxing the Individual out
- of his property Is immaterial; it is
. no more pleasant to be put to death
3 by 1,000 cuts than to have one’s
1 head chopped off in one act.
3 (9). We believe that the settler
- should be allowed to acquire land
1 under the tenure he wants, that free-
hold or perpetual lease in closer
; settled areas should be optional and
; that the settler should be allowed to
carry on his own business in his
i own way, believing that self in-teresi
- will produce the best economic re-
; suits.
/ The government insists on perpet-
ual leasehold with reappraisement of
i rentals, and, in many cases, dictates
1 how much land shall be cultivated
; and what crops shall be sown.
f (10) We believe In public works
i being carried out in the most effic-
, lent and economical way either by
■ contract or day labour.
The government insists on all work
- being carried out by day labour ir-
- respective of cost.
(11) We believe In hospitals being
1 financed by a tax on income on an
- equitable basis.
f The government places the burden
- on the unimproved, capital value of
land.
(12) We believe in public depart-
• ments being free from political in-
■ fluence and interference and that
- they should be run for the conveni-
- enee of the public and in their inter-
> ests.
The government says that political
' considerations must be paramount.
(13) We believe that the success-
: ful settlement of willing workers on
? the land is the main object in view,
i The government’s first considera-
i tion is how much revenue can be ex-
-3 tracted from the settler.
(14) We believe that those plaqed
■ in responsible positions in the rail-
i way and other departments should
' have adequate authority and control,
’ and that outside interference should
i be absolutely eliminated.
The government believes in politi-
cal control and the subordinating of
i efficiency to political exigencies.
(15) We believe first and foremost
in the “right to work” and that where
preference hi given compulsory iiu.
or levies should not be used for poli-
tical purposes.
The government believes in pref-
erence to Unions and that the funds
subscribed (in many cases under
compulsion) should be used for its
own political advantage.
(16) We believe that we should live
within our income.
The government’s idea is to remain
in power at whatever cost, leaving
our children to bear the burden.
(17) Lastly, we believe that bor-
rowed money should be largely re-
productive.
The government believes in bor-
rowing and squandering for the furth-
erance of the political ambitions of
-members of their party.
I think you must agree with me,
Ladies and Gentlemen, that no gov-
ernment in history has deserved ex-
tinction more than the present ad-
ministration. Judas Iscariot has
come down through nearly two thou-
sand years of history and tradition
as the awful example of a man who
sold his honour, his soul, and his
peace of mind for thirty pieces of
silver, yet last session of Parliament
we had his counterpart in the pres-
ent government of Queensland. This
government was . entrusted by the
people with the control of the affairs
of this State. It took an oath to up-
hold law and order, and to deal just-
ly and fairly with all sections of the
community. It swore to protect the
rights and privileges of the people
and when the crisis came, what hap-
pened? It cringed before an organ-
ised section of its own servants; it
allowed its authority to be usurped;
it allowed its members to be intimi-
dated and brow-beaten; it prostituted
Parliament in rushing through Bills
which the Premier had stated would
he detrimental to the interests of
the people and the State; it sacri-
ficed honour and principle, all in or-
der that it, might cling to the emolu-
ments of office. Now it is asking you
for a renewal of your confidence.
Could anyone have confidence in such
a cowardly government? In conclus-
ion, Ladies and Gentlemen, I wish to
say this. It must be gnanifest to ev-
eryone that we could, in an attempt
to buy the votes of the workers who
undoubtedly comprise a majority of
the electors, promise a basic wage
enactment providing a minimum
wage of £4/10/- or £5 per week, a
thirty-six hours week, and many oth-
er things. . In other words, we could
turn the elections into a political auc-
tion sale, but such a procedure would
be utterly dishonest, and if put into
effect, would mean the abolition of
arbitration, general stagnation, and
widespread unemployment. We can- ,
not, therefore, promise anything ot
the sort. We do, however, promise
the maintenance of a strictly impar-
tial Arbitration Court for the settle-
ment of industrial matters on sound
economic lines —a Court which, in
the words of Mr. Justice Higgins (late
President of the Commonwealth Ar-
bitration Court) will neither be
"bluffed” nor “hustled.” The pro-
gress of our industries, the safety of
our workers, and even the stability
of our constitution is largely de-
pendant upon the appointment and
preservation of such a Court. The
actions of a reliable government must
be honest and must be based upon
sound economic principles. If we
are honoured with the confidence of
the majority ot the Electorates (and
I feel sure that we will be) our gov-
ernment will, as far as lies in our
power, be characterised by sound
principles and honest administration.
