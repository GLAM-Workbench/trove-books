Science in the Kitchen
Science has been brought to the aid of industry in a multitude
of ways, lightening men's work, improving the products of their
hands, and making life easier for them in factories and work-
shops. To a much more limited extent, science has been made
the handmaiden of the housewife, who has the benefit of the
refrigerator, the vacuum cleaner, the washing machine, and
other labour-saving appliances.
But, in the field which requires the most concentrated effort
under the most uncongenial conditions, and is the greatest tie,
the housewife has had little relief. True, gas and electric
stoves have revolutionised the urban kitchen, but the cooking
of . meals still remains the bugbear of the housewife and ties
her to the home and to the kitchen for long periods of each
day.
Now, belatedly perhaps, but none the less effectively, science,
like the Genii of the ancient fables, is at the service of house-
wives in many countries. Perhaps the most dramatic develop-
ment of recent times has been the Pressure Cooker, which
harnesses the power of steam to cook your meals, much as it
has been harnessed to drive the locomotive.
WHAT PRESSURE COOKING MEANS
The Pressure Cooker has achieved an amazing degree of
popularity in the United States of America and Britain. Its
popularity rests not only on the time saving which it effects
in the cooking of meals, but also on the savings in money and
effort and in the extra vitamins retained in the food by this
method.
Meals prepared in a Pressure Cooker are more palatable, richer
in health-giving vitamins and mineral salts, and more attractive
to the eye than those prepared by the ordinary boiling method.
The Pressure Cooker saves space on the stove top, eliminates
the need for numerous pots and pans, materially reduces fuel


costs, and saves the housewife endless time and worry. It is
the answer of science to woman's eternal cry: "Save me from
endless drudgery in the kitchen."
RESTAURANTS. CAFETERIAS AND GUEST HOUSES
lust as the Pressure Cooker has revolutionised the home kitchen,
so also has it brought a new era in the lives of chefs in
restaurants, hotels, cafeterias and guest houses.
Here, the economies in time, space and fuel, and the added
attractiveness of meals, are so appreciable that no modern
establishment, where cost and time factors, eye appeal and
nutritional values are of paramount importance, can afford to
overlook the advantages of pressure cooking.
THE SEAL OF EXPERT APPROVAL
Read what the "Consumers' Research Bulletin" has to say
about pressure cooking after extensive research and investi-
gation by scientific and technical experts under a variety of
conditions:—
"Cooking in a pressure saucepan has been found to be
one of the most satisfactory of cooking methods for the
saving of food values. Since little water is used, there
is little loss of minerals. Phosphorus is retained better
in pressure-cooked vegetables, and there is evidence that
Vitamin C is retained better, also. In a study made of
the Vitamin C content of parsnips, for example, this
vegetable, when cooked in a pressure saucepan, lost only
9 to 10 per cent, of Vitamin C (as against 34 per cent,
when cooked in stainless steel and 29 per cent, in alu-
minium open pans). Care should be taken, however, not
to use less than the correct amount of water prescribed in
the recipe and not to overcook vegetables in a pressure
saucepan or permit them to stand after cooking (for over-
cooking and delay in serving cause an increased loss of
Vitamin Q."
The "Consumers' Research Bulletin" is published by Con-
sumers' Research Inc., of Washington, U.S.A., an acknowledged
world authority.
SCIENCE IN THE KITCHEN


The "Namco" Cooker-Canner
Australia has lagged far behind other countries in providing
this aid to housewives, but Overseas Corporation (Aust.) Ltd.,
through access to the results of world-wide technical study
and research and technical processes, has now produced the
"Namco" Cooker-Canner, which embodies the best features
of pressure cookers in wide use in other countries.
This booklet tells you how to use and care for the "Namco"
Cooker-Canner. It also gives you recipes and cooking times for
various types of food.
The "Namco" Cooker-Canner was designed and built in
Australia by expert technicians concentrating on high quality
production, durability, and, above all, performance. With care
and meticulous attention to the instructions for use and main-
tenance, it will last you for many years. It is attractive to the
eye and intriguing in operation, and will make you the envy
of your friends who do not possess a "Namco." It will also
cut your gas and electricity bills materially.
The possession of a "Namco" Cooker-Canner stamps the
housewife as a woman of intelligence and discernment, who
is well abreast of the times, and is just as keen as a factory
technician to conduct her household on the most modern and
efficient times and labour-saving lines.
If the owner be an hotel, guest house, restaurant or cafeteria
proprietor, it immediately sets the seal of enterprise, efficiency
and public service on the establishment.


Features of
the "Namco" Cooker-Canner
Here is a diagram showing the main features and parts of the
"Namco" Cooker-Canner;
Model 15
The Body of the Cooker.
This is built of a very substantial aluminium casting, ensuring
durability and long life. The rim is made with effective locking
flanges to ensure that the cover can be fitted firmly and
securely into place, by a simple twisting movement of the
handles.
The body has a shot-blasted band above a burnished base, is
attractive to the eye and workmanlike in appearance.
The Cover or Lid.
This is also constructed of a very substantial aluminium casting
and is designed for both utility and eye appeal. It is sealed


with a rubber sealing band to ensure that there is no escape of
steam pressure between the cover and the main body of the
Cooker. It has a steam escape vent which controls the vent-
weight, a pressure gauge and rubber safety plug.
The cover is burnished in the same manner as the body
and is of pleasing design and appearance.
The Sealing Band.
This, as indicated, is a rubber ring, fitting into a special groove
under the cover. When the cover is locked to the body of the
cooker, the sealing band is compressed between the two, and
prevents any leakage of steam between the cover and the body.
The Vent Pipe.
This, as indicated, is the seat for the vent-weight, allowing
the steam pressure to be automatically regulated, and maintain-
ing the pressure at the appropriate cooking standard.
The Pressure Gauge.
The pressure gauge is attached to the lid and slightly tilted
for easy reading. It registers pressure and temperature to
20 lbs. per sq. inch and 260 degrees Fah. Its essential use is
for canning as in this process pressures vary for different foods.
The gauge has also a Broad RED Line which indicates the
COOK POINT for general cooking. When the needle reaches
this point, heat must be reduced to keep it at Cook Point,
The Rubber Safety Plug.
As an additional safeguard the Cooker is fitted with a rubber
disc safety plug. If the pressure becomes too high, the rubber
safety plug will be blown out of the opening in the lid, to
release the pressure, and must be replaced before the Cooker
will work again.
The Vent-Weight.
The vent-weight rests over the vent when cooking is in
progress; it is designed to maintain correct cooking pressure,
in conjunction with the Pressure Gauge, and is also a safety
pressure release. It will not fall off the cover or jump off during
cooking, yet is easily removed by a slight pull. It is very
simple and robust, and has nothing to go wrong.
FEATURES OF THE “NAMCO" COOKER-CANNER


A simple demonstration in the
use of a "Namco" Cooker-Canner
Before you attempt to cook any food in your Namco Cooker-Canner
study the following instructions carefully. Be sure you have mastered
the instructions for use before referring to the recipe of the particular
item that you wish to cook.
1. PREPARE FOOD.
Prepare food according to
directions in recipe.
2. ADD WATER.
Pour required amount of
water in Cooker. As the
actual cooking is done by
steam pressure, it is neces-
sary to use only a small
amount of water, thus con-
serving the natural juices
and nutriment of the food;
however, until you be-
come familiar with the
Cooker-Canner, it is advis-
able to use a little more
water than is called for in
the recipe.
9


3. FILL COOKER-CANNER
Place food in Cooker,
selecting those foods that
require the same cooking
time (use dividers when
needed); seasoning may
be added before or after
cooking.
4. CLOSE COOKER-
CANNER
Place the cover on the
body of the Cooker so that
the handles are in line.
Turn the cover anti-clock-
wise until the cover drops.
5. LOCK COOKER-
CANNER
Now, while bearing down
firmly on the cover
handles, turn the cover
clockwise until the
handles of the cover are
directly in line with the
raised section in the
centre of the handles of
the body.
A SIMPLE DEMONSTRATION


6. HEAT COOKER-
CANNER
Place the Cooker over high
heat. When a steady flow
of steam from the vent
pipe shows that all air has
been exhausted, place the
vent weight in position.
7. ADD VENT WEIGHT
Push vent weight down
firmly on vent pipe. If
vent weight is not down in
position, steam will con-
tinue to escape.
8. BUILD UP PRESSURE
Watch the Pressure Gauge
until the needle reaches
the red line denoting the
Cook Point This indicates
that proper cooking tem-
perature has been reached.
REGULATE THE HEAT TO
KEEP THE NEEDLE
STEADY AT THE COOK
POINT, AND COMMENCE
TIMING. The Vent weight
should never be allowed
to jiggle violently; this
causes too rapid evapora-
tion ol water, and so food
may scorch. Neither
should heat be turned so
low that the Needle drops
below the Cook Point as
in this case the food will
not be cooked in the time
given. A little experiment-
ing should show just the
right amount of heat. When
using an ELECTRIC
STOVE, commence with
high heat, but turn ele-
ments off just before
A SIMPLE DEMONSTRATION


Needle reaches Cook Point. Move Cooker partly off hot plate when
necessary to stop weight jiggling violently. On COAL OR WOOD
STOVES, place Cooker on hottest part of stove until needle reaches
Cook Point, then move it to a cooler part of the stove to maintain
correct pressure.
9. COOK FOOD
Cook for length of time stated in recipe. As soon as cooking time
is up, turn off heat. If cooking on electric, coal or wood stoves,
remove Cooker from heat.
10. COOL COOKER-
CANNER
Take Cooker to side ol
sink, fill jug with cold
water and pour on to side
of Cover away from Gauge
and Safety Plug until
needle of gauge returns to
zero.
10a. Alternatively place
Cooker in empty shallow
dish and pour cold water
over cover as in Fig. 10.
A SIMPLE DEMONSTRATION


10b. If too heavy to carry to sink place cold wet cloths on cover
while still on stove.
10c. Gently lift the vent weight by the plastic top; if there is an
escape of steam from the vent, the steam pressure in the Cooker
has not yet dropped sufficiently, and the Cooker needs further
cooling. If there is no escape of steam, lift off the weight. Never
remove the weight until the pressure has dropped, and never open
the Cooker until you have removed the weight. Place vent weight
in regular storage place.
11. TO OPEN COOKER
Turn cover counter-clockwise and lift off, being sure to tilt cover
slightly toward you so as to deflect any remaining steam away
from you.
12. Remove food and save the liquid for soup or gravy.
IMPORTANT
Be sure the Cooker is in a level position on the stove so that the
vent weight can operate properly. Never use less water than
recommended; rather, it is advisable to increase the amount of
water until you are sure how to regulate the heat.
When cooking roasts, after browning, remove from fire; have cover
and indicator at hand. Add boiling water and place on cover, then
indicator as quickly as possible.
A SIMPLE DEMONSTRATION


Read this carefully
before using your Cooker
If you wish to obtain years of trouble-free operation and
maximum satisfaction from your "NAMCO" Cooker-Canner,
pay attention to the following :
DO NOT wait too long before placing vent weight on vent
pipe. Place vent weight in position as soon as a
steady flow of steam is visible. Should there be
a slight dripping of water under the vent weight,
do not become alarmed; this is due to condensation
of steam, and will disappear during the cooking
process.
DO NOT strike the rim of the Cooker with anything that will
cause nicks.
DO NOT take the cover off without first removing the vent
weight.
DO NOT remove the vent weight until the needle of pressure
gauge has returned to zero.
DO NOT try to force the cover off even though it seems to
stick or is hard to turn. Any undue tightness
indicates that there is still pressure within the Cooker
and that it requires further cooling.
DO NOT let your Cooker boil dry or become overheated.
DO NOT pour cold water into a dry, overheated Cooker.


DO NOT fill the Cooker more than half full when cooking
foods such as soups and stews.
DO NOT fill the Cooker more than two-thirds full at any time.
DO NOT cook any food, particularly meat and poultry that may
extend to the top of the Cooker without placing the
rack on top. This is to prevent the openings to the
gauge, vent pipe and safety plug from becoming
blocked.
DO NOT lay the cover on a hot stove after removing it
from the Cooker. Direct heat will ruin the sealing
ring and safety plug.
DO NOT store the Cooker with the lid locked in position.
Keep the cover off, or, to save storage space, rest
the lid upside down on the Cooker.
DO NOT add sugar to fruit until after the cooking time is
complete, except when called for as syrup in canning.
DO NOT blame the Cooker if you omit to follow the instruc-
tions. Like everything else, you will get satisfactory
results only if you follow the rules.
DO NOT immerse Pressure Gauge in water when cleaning
cover, as this will damage the mechanism.
Always ensure that only Genuine "NAMCO" spare parts and
accessories are used in your Cooker-Canner.
READ THIS CAREFULLY


How to take care of
your "Namco" Cooker-Canner
KEEP IT CLEAN;
A new Cooker should be cleaned inside with Steel Wool and a
good household soap and rinsed with warm water. It is then ready
for use. Be sure not to use at any time scouring powders or strong
soaps containing free alkali.
To maintain your Namco, the inside of the pot must be regularly
cleaned after use as above, being sure to thoroughly dry after
cleaning.
If, when you first use your cooker, the food has a slightly metallic
flavour, this can usually be overcome by putting 2 quarts oi
water and a sliced lemon in the cooker and pressure cooking for
10 minutes.
If the inside of your cooker has become discoloured, place enough
water in the cooker to reach the line of discolouration. Add one
tablespoon of Cream of Tartar to each quart of water, bring pressure
to cook point, remove from heat, and let it return to zero of its own
accord and then stand overnight.
Be sure the Vent Pipe is open and clean before each use. A pipe
cleaner may be used for this purpose.
CARE OF SEALING RING.
Ensure that Sealing Ring is always fully seated in its groove. If
the ring seems large or stretched so that difficulty is found in
completely inserting it, then follow instructions for reinserting ring
in para. 3on next page. Clean ring with small brush to be sure
that no particles of food have collected around it.


INSTRUCTIONS FOR REVERSING SEALING RING (To be followed
in case of Steam Leak)
If, after prolonged use, you notice
that the sealing ring has taken a set
inwards, as shown in figure, and does
not seal perfectly, proceed as fol-
lows :
1. Gently pull up the ring and
stretch it slightly as you would a
rubber band.
2. With the coloured section UP-
WARDS, grip ring as shown and
turn inside out, so that coloured sec-
tion now faces DOWNWARDS.
3. Still maintaining grip on sealing
ring, place ring in groove for a length
of about 2" at positions 1 and 2 dia-
metrically opposite, as shown. Then
repeat at positions 3 and 4, so that
ring is now entered in four evenly-
spaced positions, then press the re-
maining portions into groove, being
sure that ring is pressed securely into
position all round.
4. 11, after replacement of Sealing Ring, difficulty is found in closing
Cover, smear a little butter or fat on bevelled lip of pot and press
handles firmly down while closing.

Soups
The time saved in cooking soups with the "Namco" Pressure
Cooker is considerable. By ordinary old-fashioned methods
some soups take hours to prepare for the table, but with the
Pressure Cooker it is merely a matter of minutes.
Moreover, the heat generated by this method extracts the
gelatine from the bones and gives you a soup which is rich
in taste and nutritional values, and clear in appearance. As
there is no evaporation, it is not necessary to use a large amount
of water in preparing soups.
IMPORTANT.—There are certain fundamental rules which
MUST be followed in preparing soup in a Pressure Cooker.
Firstly: Never in any circumstances fill your Cooker over hall
full. (Soup may be diluted with boiling water after cooking
if desired.)
Secondly: Make certain that pressure has been reduced before
removing the vent weight. Pour a little cold water over
the lid half way between the vent weight and the rim of
the Cooker.
Thirdly: Lift the vent weight slowly, before attempting to
remove the cover.
Fourthly: If the cover does not come off easily when the
vent weight is removed, do not attempt to force it. Soup
has a tendency to clog the vent pipe, leaving some steam
in the Cooker. Therefore, if the cover sticks, cool it again
until the steam has been dispelled and the cover turns
easily.
Lastly; Do not experiment; follow the rules and the results
will be all that you can desire.

Fish and Sea Foods
In cooking fish it is important not to overcook. Fish, unlike
meat, is inclined to fall apart when overcooked. Frozen fish
should be thawed out for at least one hour before cooking.
Do not fill Cooker over two-thirds full.
When cooking time is complete, cool quickly by pouring cold
water over the lid of the Cooker, between the vent weight
and the rim, before removing the vent weight.
Only a small amount of water is necessary in the cooking of
fish.
When frying, fish should be dipped in beaten egg, then into
seasoned flour. Cook well in fat in bottom of Cooker.

FISH AND SEA FOODS


Tough meat is a thing of the past with the "Namco" Pressure
Cooker-Canner. You can reduce the toughest meat to the most
tender delicacy in a matter of minutes. The cooking time for
meat depends on the amount and distribution on the bone,
toughness, size, thickness of cut, and the manner in which the
meat fits in the Cooker.
Rolled roasts require longer cooking than unboned roasts.
Short chunky roasts require longer time than flat roasts; con-
sequently, it is only possible to give an approximate cooking
time. After using the "Namco" for roasts a few times, you
will know how to regulate the cooking time for the piece of
meat you are preparing. It is essential that the roasts be
WELL BROWNED BEFORE COOKING. To do this, put 4 table
spoons of fat or dripping in the Cooker and heat until hot enough
to sear meat. Put in meat and brown well on all sides. After this
thorough browning, pour off surplus fat, then, before pressure
cooking, BE SURE to add the exact amount of water given in the
recipe. The amount of water required for meat other than roasts
is given in the meat time-table and in each recipe. Always have
cover and vent-weight handy to place on Cooker immediately
after water is added, so as to prevent loss of liquid through
evaporation. Place lid on the Cooker and proceed according
to instructions. If the cover does not go on easily, it will be
because the body of the Cooker has expanded with the heat.
If you place the cover loosely on the Cooker for a minute
it will expand sufficiently to fit easily on the body of the
Cooker. After meat has been cooked, if added crispness is
desired, place meat under griller of stove or in oven for a few
minutes.

Fresh Vegetables
It is always advisable to soak vegetables in cold water lor
a short time before cooking, particularly if they have been
picked for some time, and have lost some of' their moisture.
Several different vegetables can be cooked at the one time
and each will retain its distinctive flavour and colour. The
timing chart gives the time each vegetable takes to cook. Best
results are obtained when vegetables requiring the same
cooking time are cooked together. It will be found that "end
of season" vegetables sometimes require longer cooking time
than that stated on the chart. In cooking fresh vegetables,
place them on the rack in the Cooker, and pour over them a
small quantity of water (specified in the recipes), to which may
be added half a level teaspoon of salt. (An alternative method
is to season food with salt and butter after cooking.) Place the
cover on the Cooker and then proceed as stated in the general
instructions.
To retain colour and prevent over-cooking the Cooker should
be cooled quickly by pouring cold water over the lid until
the gauge returns to zero. Remove the vent-weight and then
remove the cover from the Cooker.

Pressure cooking ensures that the minerals stored in cereals are
retained more completely than in any other method of cooking.
Also, the carbohydrates in cereals being the best sources of
energy for both adults and children, every care should be
taken in cooking in order to obtain their full benefit. For all
cereals, the most effective cooking method is as follows: —
(i) Bring water to the boil in the Cooker.
(ii) Stir cereal into water in order to avoid lumpiness.
(iii) Place lid on Cooker and pressure cook for the time stated
in recipes.
When gauge returns to zero, pour a little cold water over

Desserts,
Puddings and Fruit Cakes
Your steamed puddings and custards will be lighter and
more delicious than ever if you cook them in your NAMCO.
Your Cooker is an ideal steamer, and because the heat attained
is constant and concentrated, a uniform texture is produced in
these foods in one-third of normal cooking time. Any type
of mould or bowl that will fit in the Cooker may be used, but
aluminium or enamel moulds without metal covers are best.
The times called for in the following recipes are based upon
the use of aluminium pans or bowls; therefore, cooking times
must be increased if non-metal pans or bowls are used.
Never fill moulds or bowls over two-thirds full, to allow space
for the food to rise. Foods which are to be steamed for the
full time without the addition of the vent weight, need not be
covered, but all those requiring a pressure cooking period
should be covered with two layers of waxed or parchment
paper.
Should you use your own recipes, cook according to the
directions for that particular type of pudding, cake or custard
given in the following pages.
TO STEAM TWO LAYERS OF CUSTARDS OR PUDDINGS
This can be done by placing the rack on top of the first layer
and setting the remaining moulds on the rack. Pressure cook
for the time stated in each recipe. In cooking puddings and
fruit cake, it is essential that you STEAM for the period shown
in the time table and recipes, before placing the VENT
WEIGHT in position. In steaming without the vent weight do
not allow the steam to rise more than 8 inches above the
vent pipe, or your water will evaporate too quickly.
WHERE PRESSURE COOKING IS CALLED FOR
The first part of the cooking period is steaming time, which
permits the foods to rise. Remove the lid after the steaming time
and make sure that 1-2 cups of water still remain in the
bottom of the Cooker. If necessary, add additional hot water
before placing the vent weight in position.

The "Namco" as a Sterilizes
THE "NAMCO" COOKER-CANNER can be used as
a sterilizer for both homes and hospitals. It is large
enough for most instruments.
STERILIZING BOTTLES. NIPPLES. ETC.
Nipples, bandages, swabs or rubber gloves should be placed
in a closed Mason Jar. Thus the jar becomes a sterile container,
until the items are required for use.
Put two cups of water in bottom of Cooker. Place rack in
Cooker and lay the washed bottles, instruments, jars, or other
items on rack, close Cooker, and when steam appears place
vent-weight on vent pipe, and pressure cook for ten to fifteen
minutes.

Introduction to Canning
This section will serve to acquaint you with the "Namco"
Canner. Once you are familiar with the mechanical parts, you
will find that operation of the Cooker is simple. Before you
try to use it, know it thoroughly. You will find simple ex-
planations of how to get the most successful results, in the
pages that follow. Read, learn and inwardly digest them and
then go to work with confidence.
By using a "Namco’ 1 and knowing the modern, scientific
methods prescribed for its use, you will find that foods will
keep over from season to season without spoilage, and with a
minimum loss of flavour and nutrients.
In using the Namco as a home canner no higher endorsement
can be given than the following one from the U.S. Department
of Agriculture:—
"Research and practical experience have demonstrated that
non-acid food products, like asparagus, beans, peas, beets,
spinach, fish and meats, except when adequately cured, cannot
be safely canned by processing in boiling water; but must be
sterilised under pressure with approved time and temperature.
There is no excuse for continuing to take risks involved in
canning non-acid foods without adequate pressure cooking.
All recommendations by the Department of Agriculture will
hereafter make this clear and emphatic."
Dr. A. F. WOODS, U.S. Dept, of Agriculture.
This is also confirmed by AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT
AUTHORITIES, who state that, unless Vegetables, Meats.
Poultry or Fish have been preserved in a Pressure Cooker,
it is not safe to consume them.


Canning does not change the food value of starches, sugars,
fats, proteins or minerals. Vitamins A and B withstand cooking.
So far as these vitamins are concerned there is little difference
between fresh and canned vegetables. Canned foods are better
than vegetables cooked in an open container, because, being
sealed during cooking, there is less exposure to air, and hence
less oxidation.
The cardinal rule in planning a daily menu of proper nutritive
value is to include a liberal amount of fruit, milk, eggs and
vegetables. To ensure this all the year round a certain amount
of planning is necessary when these foods are plentiful. This
will be no trouble when you are in possession of a "Namco."
Foods can be quickly processed with the minimum amount of
time and effort.
CANNING
Canning is a method of storing food in airtight containers to
preserve its flavour and food value over long periods. By using
this economical method, foods are made available during
seasons and in places where they would not be otherwise
obtainable. The value of the better balanced diet and the
variety in the menus obtained by this means cannot be
measured in shillings and pence.
SELECTION OF EQUIPMENT
It is just as essential to have proper equipment for the modern
process of home canning as it is to have a vacuum cleaner,
a refrigerator or any other modern aid to good housekeeping.
Modern equipment transforms what otherwise would be a task
into a pleasure. Canning and preserving are simple and easy
when done in a Namco.
Having purchased the necessary equipment you will find that
most of it will fulfil a useful function in your kitchen during
the rest of the year. Before commencing your canning be
sure that you have at hand a Namco Pressure Canner, scales,
sharp knives, a ladle, a measuring cup.
INTRODUCTION TO CANNING


The function of the Namco is to process the foods by heating
them above the boiling point of water
temperature of between 240 and 250°, this being necessary
for the safe preserving of non-acid foods.
The higher temperatures obtained in the cooker canner make;-
special sterlising of the jars unnecessary; one more advantage
over the old method.
FOOD SELECTION
Select only sound, ripe and fresh fruits and vegetables.
Discard those which are discoloured or bruised, under or over
ripe. Over ripe fruit is already on the way to decay; under
ripe has not yet reached its full flavour. When possible, can
foods the day they are picked the ideal time is 2 hours
from garden to jar.
CONTAINERS
Glass jars are most commonly used for home canning. They
must be airtight when sealed to prevent the growth of bacteria,
yeast and mould which develops only in the presence of
oxygen. The same jars can be used repeatedly, but new
rubbers must be purchased each season to ensure perfect
sealing.
CAUSES OF FOOD SPOILAGE
To preserve successfully it is advisable to have an under-
standing of the different methods which can be used to prevent
the spoilage of food through keeping. There are present in
all foods substances called enzymes, whose development
brings about the normal ripening of fruits and vegetables.
Unless it is checked, this development will finally cause the
complete decay of the product. This is the reason why such
emphasis is placed on the canning of foods as soon as possible
after they are picked. These enzymes are easily destroyed by
heat, so it can be seen why canning arrests their development,
and preserves the food in its original condition.
Other causes of food spoilage are yeasts, moulds, and bacteria.
These destroyers of food are found everywhere—in the air,
in the soil, on the surface of fruits and vegetables. Yeasts
and moulds must have air, and are easily destroyed by mild
INTRODUCTION TO CANNING


heat. Bacteria, the big trouble maker, is highly resistant to
heat, and some varieties do not need air. There is only one
safe way of destroying these organisms, and that is by a com-
bination of pressure and temperature.
When foods are subjected to high temperature and pressure,
and then sealed in jars to prevent the entrance of air, they are
said to be sterilised. The application of heat to the foods
during canning is called processing.
METHODS OF HOME CANNING
The three methods in general use in the home kitchen are the
hot pack, the cold pack, and the pre-cooking method.
1. In the cold pack method (and this is the method we recom-
mend for most fruits and vegetables), the jars are placed on
the rack in the cooker with 2 quarts of cold water. While the
;ars are heating, the food is prepared either by peeling or by
blanching in hot water. When ready, it is packed tightly into
the jars which have been removed from the cooker and placed
in a bowl or on a dry cloth; boiling syrup or brine is added,
the jars are sealed, placed back in the Cooker, and processed
2. In the hot pack method, the food is heated in a small
quantity of water until it shrinks, then packed boiling hot into
jars, sealed according to instructions and processed
immediately.
3. In the pre-cooking method, the foods are pressure cooked,
placed in sterilised jars, sealed immediately and stored. This
method is suitable only for fruits and tomatoes. Its disadvan-
tage lies in the necessity for sterilisation of jars before they
are filled, and the danger of contamination during filling.
Since this book was originally compiled, it has been found
through repeated tests that the following simple method gives
very satisfactory results. Pack fruit or vegetables into jars, fill
with cold syrup or brine; release air bubbles; seal jars accord-
ing to instructions. Put on rack in Cooker with 3 quarters cold
water. Bring to required pressure and cook for time stated in
■able.
STERILISATION OF CONTAINERS
This can be done quickly and efficiently in the canner while
the foods are being prepared. Place the jars on the rack with

the jars warm, so they will not break when filled with the hot
food.
Special Points to be Observed when Canning.
To get the most satisfactory results from your NAMCO Cooker-
Canner, care must be taken. Bring the pressure slowly up
to that given in the following ‘tables. When nearing the
pressure point, lower heat so that the pressure does not go
too high, and have to be reduced quickly. Fluctuation of
temperature is the chief cause of the liquid being exhausted
from jars. Although this does not affect the keeping qualities
of the food, it detracts very much from its appearance.
After initial exhausting period, and the vent-weight has been
added, do not at any time allow steam to escape violently
through the vent pipe, as this also causes liquid to be lost from
jars.
If possible, allow Cooker-Canner to cool down on stove. It
necessary to remove it during cooling process, do so as
carefully as possible. Do not remove vent-weight until gauge
needle has returned to zero.
INTRODUCTION TO CANNING


Types of in common use
The following types of glass jars may be used for canning in your
Namco Pressure Cooker-Canner. Any jar may be used as long as it
does not exceed in height when covered. The most common
types of jar covers in domestic use are
1. SPRING CLIP TYPE VACUUM JARS which consist
of jar, rubber ring, cover and spring clip.
Directions for using: Wet rings before putting on and
see that ring is placed evenly in the narrow groove
around mouth of jar. Place on metal cover, and finally
adjust spring clip, seeing that both shoulders of clip fit
under lip of the jar.
2. TWO-PIECE SCREW CAP consists of a flat metal
lid held in place with a screw cap. A rubber compound
on the underside of the metal lid takes the place of a
separate rubber ring.
Directions for using: When the jar is filled, this type of
metal lid is put on with the rubber side down on the jar.
This type of closure should be turned down firmly tight
before processing. To test seal 24 hours after processing,
tap lid gently with spoon; if clear ringing sound results,
it indicates proper seal.
3. MASON JARS consist of jar, rubber ring, and
porcelain-lined metal cover.
Directions for using; Put rubber ring on ledge on top of
jar before filling. When filled screw cap down tightly
and turn back i". As soon as food is processed cap
must be turned down tightly.
4. PLASTIC CLOTH Cut into sections to fit any size
jar and tie down tightly, according to makers' directions.


Steps in Canningj,
1. FIRST, assemble all materials and equipment required, make
sure that your Namco is clean and working perfectly.
2. Check jars, rings and
covers for imperfections;
clean and rinse thoroughly


3. Place rings on jars,
place jars on rack in
Cooker, to which 2 quarts
water has been added.
Cover Cooker, turn heat to
high until water boils, then
reduce heat to low until
ready to use.
4. Select, sort food and
prepare.
5. Remove cover from
Cooker, remove jars as re-
quired, and place in
warmed basin or on dry
cloth. Pack jars tightly
with food fill with boiling
syrup, brine or water.
STEPS IN CANNING


6. Work out all bubbles
with a clean knife, adding
additional liquid to fill jar
as required, OR place
cover on jar, tilt sideways
and gently tap bottom
edge of jar on table.
When all bubbles have
risen to top remove cover
and completely fill jar
with liquid.
7. Wipe sealing edge of jars with clean wet cloth, dip jar lids in
boiling water, place on jars and tighten according to directions for
type used.
8. (a) Place covered jars
on rack in Cooker, being
sure that they do not
touch the sides of the
Cooker or one another.
(b) Cover Cooker and lock
in closed position. Turn
heat to high until steam
flows freely through vent
pipe. Place vent weight
in position and allow pres-
sure to build up slowly.
Just before the gauge needle reaches the required pressure, REDUCE
the heat in order to prevent the pressure going too high, ther
adjust the heat so that the needle remains STEADY at the giver
pressure for the necessary time.
STEPS IN CANNING


9. Remove Cooker-Canner
CAREFULLY from heat at
end of processing time,
and allow pressure to re-
turn to ZERO of its own
accord. When pressure
reaches zero, gently lift
vent weight and, if no
further steam escapes, lift
off, and remove cover, be-
ing careful to tilt cover
away from you.
10. Remove jars from
Cooker-Canner, place on a
board or towel; keep sep-
arated from each other and
away from drafts. Tighten
lids if necessary for type
used. DO NOT move jars
for 24 hours, then wipe
clean, test seals, label,
date and store in cool dry
place.

Canning • Fruits
Directions and Time Tables
Although fruit has better colour and flavour when it is canned
with sugar, it may be canned unsweetened if desired. Sugar
is used for flavour; it is not used in high enough concentration
to act as a preservative. When fruit is plentiful, but a shortage
of sugar exists, it is advisable to can without sugar, which may
be added when jars are opened.
Method. —Heat white sugar with liquid slowly until dissolved,
allowing approximately \ cup of syrup for each pint jar. The
type of syrup is governed by the kind of fruit and individual
tastes. Use heavier syrup for the more tart fruits.
Packing of Jars. —Pack the fruit in the jars as tightly as possible,
pour over sufficient boiling water or syrup to cover. Release
all air bubbles, either by gently passing a knife down the side
of jar, or after adjusting lid, by inclining jar at an angle of
45 degrees and tapping the bottom of jar gently on the table,
until the bubbles rise to the top. Remove lid, refill to top with
syrup, and seal.

Canning • Vegetables
Directiopns and tabled,
Grading. —Sort the vegetables carefully for size and colour.
Uniformity of size is important not only for appearance, but
because small sizes take slightly less time to cook than
the larger ones. Discard or cut out any bruised or dis-
coloured parts.
Brine for Preserving. —Vegetables may be processed without
salt. This, as with the sugar in fruits, does not act as a
preservative. Flavour, however, is improved by the addition
of salt, and brine should be prepared as follows: Dissolve
1 teaspoon salt to every quart of water,, bring to boil before
adding to vegetables in jars.
Blanching. —After preparing vegetables, immerse in a bath of
boiling water for 5 minutes.
Packing of Jars. —Pack the vegetables in jars as tightly as
possible, pour over sufficient brine or boiling water to cover.
Release air bubbles in the same manner as for fruits.

CANNING VEGETABLES


Canning • Meats
Directions and Time Tables
Selection. —Meat for canning should be carefully selected free
from fat. It should be canned as soon after body heat has left
carcase as possible. Care should be taken to keep meat free
from contamination between killing and processing.
Methods. —Meat may be pre-cooked or packed raw. For pre-
cooked meats fill jar with salted liquid or stock (one teaspoon
salt to every quart of liquid). Meats packed raw do not require
the addition of liquid.
Packing of Jars. —Pack hot meat or poultry into jars, leaving
one inch head space at top; do not pack too tightly.
Be sure to wipe top of jar free from all grease or meat
particles. Bone meat, and cut into pieces convenient for
canning, not more than to 3 inches in diameter. Pre-cook
meat until the red colour changes to brown, by boiling, frying
or roasting. DO NOT add flour at any time in processing, as
flour forms a coating making sterilisation more difficult. Make
the stock from scraps or bones not used in canning.
Pre-cooking meats before canning gives the desired flavour,
shrinks the product, and aids the sterilisation.
Meat packed raw tastes like stewed or boiled meat, and
requires longer processing.

Answers to your more
important questions about
"Namco" Canning
Q. When processing food, is it necessary to have the Namco
Cooker filled with jars?
A. It is economical to process at one time as many jars as the
Cooker will hold, for it saves time and fuel. However, if
you wish to process small amounts of food, even one jar
may be processed successfully.
Q. If liquid is lost from a jar during processing, should the
jar be opened when processing is complete to add more
liquid?
A. No; this should never be done. The loss of liquid will
not interfere with keeping qualities, and to open the jar
at the end of the processing will result in later spoilage of
the food.
Q. What causes liquid to boil out of jars during processing?
A. Liquid is withdrawn from jars during the processing period
for the following reasons :
1. Too high temperature or pressure, which causes too
rapid boiling.
2. Fluctuations in pressure.
3. Failure to adjust lids properly before processing.
4. Removing vent weight before pressure gauge registers
zero.
Q. When should one start to count time of processing?
A. From the instant the needle on gauge reaches required
pressure.


Q, What products should be packed loosely and what products
should be packed firmly, and why?
A. Such products as corn, peas, greens and meats should be
packed loosely because heat penetration in these products
is difficult. Fruits, berries and tomatoes should be firmly
and solidly packed becouse of the shrinkage which takes
place during processing and because their texture does not
retard heat penetration, A solid pack should be made of
all other products.
0- Should bubbles appear in the jar after it is taken out of
the Cooker to cool?
A. Bubbles often appear in the jar after it is removed from
Cooker because food is still boiling in the jar. Ordinarily
bubbles do not appear once the product has been allowed
to thoroughly cool, unless the jar is shaken. A very tight
pack of food may show air bubbles.
Q. What causes peaches and pears to turn dark brown after
they have been canned? How can this be prevented?
A. Fruit exposed to air too long after being peeled and before
being canned. This can be overcome by dropping peeled
fruit into slightly salted or plain water until ready to put
in jars. When fruits canned without sugar are opened,
they sometimes turn brown just as fresh fruit does when
exposed to air. Pears canned by cold pack method will
retain original colour better if a tablespoon of lemon juice
is added to each quart jar.
O- How may strawberries be canned to prevent floating and
in order to retain their original colour?
A. By pre-cooking in syrup and allowing the berries to stand
in the syrup overnight; then packing in jars and processing.
After canning, store jars in a dark place to retain colour
of berries.
ANSWERS TO YOUR IMPORTANT QUESTIONS


0. Why do berries, other fruits, and tomatoes rise from the
bottom of jar?
A. This may be caused by using foods that are over-ripe,
processing too long and at too high a pressure, using too
heavy syrup or packing too loosely. Fruits and tomatoes
shrink when heated and should be packed firmly.
Q. Should canned vegetables be re-cooked before tasting or
using?
A. If your Namco Cooker-Canner is in perfect order, and if
every canning instruction has been followed, there is no
need for re-cooking. But as a safety precaution, heat
the vegetables for ten minutes at a boiling temperature
before serving. If food looks unduly cloudy or smells
sour, destroy without tasting.
Q. What are the reasons for jars not sealing and thus causing
spoilage?
A. (1) Failure to follow exact time-tables and recipes.
(2) Failure to wipe sealing edge of jar clean before placing
lid on jar.
(3) Food, seeds or grease lodged between lid and jar.
(4) Clamps of lightning or bail-type jars not properly
adjusted.
(5) Jars which are nicked or cracked or have sharp sealing
edges.
(6) If Mason jar and two-piece metal lid band are screwed
down too loosely, during the processing the flexible lid
permits the jar to exhaust.
(7) Turning jars upside down while cooling and sealing.
Q. Is it necessary to sterilise jars and lids before canning?
A. No; when the food is processed in the jar, the jar does not
require sterilising, but all jars should be thoroughly
cleansed and rinsed in boiling water. Jar closures should
also be dipped in boiling water,
ANSWERS TO YOUR IMPORTANT QUESTIONS


O- Should screw bands be screwed as tightly as possible
before being placed in the Namco Cooker-Canner for
processing?
A. The bands on two-piece metal caps should be screwed
down tightly. The bands on three-piece glass caps are
turned down, then loosened one-quarter turn. Zinc jar lids
are loosened one-quarter inch.
O Why is it safe to tighten two-piece metal caps before
processing?
A Two-piece metal caps seal by the cooling of the contents
of the jar and not through pressure of the screw band on
the lid. Therefore, although screw band is firmly tight,
the jar is not sealed until it has cooled, and during the
processing the flexible lid permits the jar to exhaust.
Q. In adjusting closures, what is meant by "firmly-tight"?
A By "firmly-tight" we mean as tight as the hand can con-
veniently screw the band without using any undue exertion
or mechanical appliance,
O Why are some jar closures tightened before processing and
others left a little loose?
A During processing steam is formed and must have an
opportunity to escape from the jar. Two-piece metal lids
expand sufficiently to allow the escape of steam, and
therefore the band that holds them in place can be turned
firmly tight. These closures are not tightened after pro-
cessing. There is not enough "give" to some of the other
types of closures to allow steam to escape. Consequently,
too much pressure is built up within the jar. Either the
jar or the cover must give way in this case. Jars with glass
tops, rubber rings and a screw band, glass tops which
fasten by means of a wire bail, and zinc caps should be
left a little loose before and tightened firmly afterwards.

Jame and Jelleis
Pickled and Preserver
The first step in jam and jelly making—that is, the breaking-
down of the fruit —is greatly speeded up with a Namco Cooker-
Canner. By pre-cooking the fruit in a Namco its flavour and
colour is retained to an amazing degree.
After the sugar has been added the canner can then be used
as an open pan during the reducing and thickening period.
It has to be remembered that there has been no evaporation
during the pre-cooking period.
Full directions for specified recipes will be found in the
following pages.
Chutney becomes easy and quick when pressure cooking
methods are used. No longer any need to leave a mass of
ingredients simmering on the stove for an hour or two. The
sweet chutney on page 101 takes only 15 minutes to cook
when pressure is used. If the chutney is not thick enough for
the individual taste after the pressure cooking period, it can
be further cooked in the cooker without a lid until the
necessary evaporation has taken place. This is a quicker
process than in an ordinary saucepan, due to the capacity
of the cooker to absorb and retain heat.
Remember; When pressure cooking, never fill the Cooker more
than half-full for jam or jelly-making.
ORANGE MARMALADE
Seville oranges. Granulated sugar.
Lemons.
Slice the oranges, fine or thick according to taste. Remove
pips and tie in a muslin bag. Measure the oranges in a pint
measure, adding one sliced lemon to every 6 oranges. Pour
over 1 pint water to every pint of pulp and soak for 12 hours.
Put oranges, water and pips into Cooker, being sure to not
more than half fill. Cover and pressure cook for 15 minutes.
Reduce pressure with cold water, remove lid, add 1 cup of
sugar per cup of cooked pulp, bring to the boil and cook fairly
fast until a little marmalade put on a plate will set.


GRAPEFRUIT MARMALADE
6 oranges. Sugar.
6 small grapefruit. Water.
2 lemons.
Slice oranges, grapefruit and lemons finely, cover with li pints
water to each pint of pulp. Soak for at least 12 hours. Put
in Cooker and pressure cook for 15 minutes. Cool Cooker and
add 1 cup of sugar to each cup of cooked pulp. Bring slowly
to boil, and then cook quickly for approximately 15 minutes,
or until required thickness.
LIME MARMALADE
Limes. Granulated sugar .
Use the same method as for orange marmalade, omitting the
lemons. Limes are very acid and need no other setting agent.
PLUM JAM
About 5 lbs. plums. Juice of one lemon.
4 lbs. sugar. } cup cold water.
Stone the plums and weigh. Put them in the Namco with
i cup cold water, and pressure cook 5 minutes. Reduce pres-
sure with cold water, remove cover, add sugar and lemon
juice, and cook without the cover until the jam will set when
a spoonful is tried on a cold plate.
Make other jams according to the recipe you use for ordinary
cooking, consulting the time-table for cooking fresh fruit, which
will give you the time for breaking down the fruit.
QUINCE JAM
3 lbs. quinces. | lemon.
3 lbs. sugar. 1 oz . green ginger.
1 cup water.
Peel and core quinces. Put in Cooker with sliced lemon and
water. Pressure cook for 15 minutes. Cool Cooker, remove
cover and ginger, add sugar and bring slowly to boil. Then
cook quickly for about 7 minutes, or until required thickness.
JAMS. JELLIES, PICKLES AND PRESERVES


FIG JAM
3 lbs. figs. f lemon
I lb. cooking apples. 1 cup water.
1 oz• green ginger. 3 lbs, sugar.
Peel figs, peel and core apples. Put all peels, cores of apples
and cut-up ginger in a muslin bag. Put figs, apples, finely
sliced lemon and muslin bag in Cooker. Pressure cook for
15 minutes. Cool Cooker, add sugar, heat slowly until sugar
is dissolved, then cook quickly for about 7 minutes, or until
a spoonful put on a cold plate will jell.
DRIED APRICOT JAM
1 lb. dried apricots. 1 oz. shelled and blanched
4 pints water. almonds.
4 lbs. sugar.
Wash apricots well, pour on 4 pints of boiling water, and allow
to stand for at least 12 hours. Blanch almonds and cut in
quarters. Place apricots and water in Cooker and pressure
cook for 10 minutes. Cool Cooker, remove cover, add sugar,
and almonds and heat slowly until sugar is dissolved. Then
cook quickly until required thickness.
MELON AND LEMON JAM
6 lbs. diced pie melon. 5 lbs. sugar.
3 lemons, } cup water.
3 ozs. preserved ginger.
Put diced melon with finely-sliced lemon and ginger in cooker
with i cup water. Pressure cook for 15 minutes. Cool Cooker,
add sugar. Heat slowly until sugar is dissolved, then boil
quickly for 7 minutes, or until required thickness.
GOOSEBERRY JELLY
4 lbs. green gooseberries. Sugar.
2 cups water.
Wash the gooseberries and put them in the Cooker with one
cup of water. Pressure cook 3 minutes. Reduce pressure with
cold water and strain the fruit through a jelly bag. Measure
the juice and allow f lb. of sugar to each pint of juice. Dissolve
the sugar in the juice and boil in the Cooker without the lid
until the jelly will set when a spoonful is tried on a cold plate.
JAMS, JELLIES, PICKLES AND PRESERVES


APPLE JELLY
4 lbs. cooking apples. Rind an juice of 1 lemon.
Stick of cinnamon. Water.
Sugar.
Cut up the apples (it is not necessary to peel or core them);
put them in the Cooker with water enough to come to the
same level as themselves, cover and pressure cook for 5
minutes. Reduce pressure with cold water, and strain the
apples through a jelly bag, if possible all night. Measure the
juice, add f lb. of sugar to each pint of juice; put back into
the Cooker with the cinnamon, lemon rind and juice; cook
without the cover until the jelly will set when a teaspoonful
is tried on a cold plate.
The amount of water cannot be precisely stated, nor the amount
of sugar. For very juicy apples, use i pint of water. For
tough, green fruit, use f-1 pint to the pound. In every case the
amount of sugar used depends on the juice produced by
pressure cooking, not on the amount of fruit used. Since there
is no evaporation during cooking by pressure, it is necessary
to finish the jelly without the cover, but the Cooker-Canner
makes an excellent jam kettle, because the aluminium of which
it is made is a good distributor of heat, and the jam or jelly
cooks evenly without scorching.
RED CURRANT JELLY
4 lbs. red currants. Water.
Sugar.
Put the currants, after washing in cold water, into the Cooker,
and add enough water to come to their level. Cover and
pressure cook for 1 minute only, or, if the currants are very
ripe, bring up to pressure point only. Reduce pressure with
cold water, and strain the fruit through a jelly bag. Measure
the juice, and allow f lb. of sugar to every pint. Put juice
and sugar in the Cooker, dissolve the sugar, and boil without
the cover until a spoonful of the jelly will set when tried on a
cold plate.
