Fight the good fight with all thy might,
Christ is thy Strength, and Christ thy Right;
Lay hold on life, and it shall be
Thy joy and crown eternally.
Run the straight race through God’s good grace,
Lift up thine eyes, and seek His Face;
Life with its way before us lies,
Christ is the path, and Christ the prize.
Cast care aside, lean on thy Guide;
His boundless mercy will provide;
Trust, and thy trusting soul shall prove
Christ is its life, and Christ its love.
Faint not nor fear, His Arms are near.
He changeth not, and thou art dear;
Only believe, and thou shalt see
That Christ is all in all to thee.
Amen.
ijJaalut XX333
The Lord is my shepherd: therefore can I lack nothing.
He shall feed me in a green pasture; and lead me forth beside the
waters of comfort.
He shall convert my soul: and bring me forth in the paths of
righteousness for His name’s sake.
Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil: for Thou art with me Thy rod and Thy staff comfort
me.
Thou shalt prepare a table before me against them that trouble
me: Thou hast anointed my head with oil and my cup shall be full.
But Thy loving-kindness and mercy shall follow me all the days
of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.
Gloria.

iSyntn
Abide with me: fast falls the eventide
The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide:
When other helpers fail, and comforts flee.
Help of the helpless, oh, abide with me.
Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;
Earth’s joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
Change and decay in all around I see;
O Thou, who changest not, abide with me.
Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes;
Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies;
Heaven’s morning breaks, and earth’s vain shadows
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.
Amen.
