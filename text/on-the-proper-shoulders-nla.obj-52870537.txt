What it Meant.
The Irish people voted
lor Peace, but peace in
Ireland la not our policy.
The Union of Hearts is
great blessing.
Firm Government is
still the real solution.
England is satisfied
with the Constitution, the
whole Constitution and
nothing but the Constitu-
tion.
EXTRACTS FROM THE OFFICIAL
REPORT OF PROCEEDINGS
IN THE ENGLISH HOUSE OF
COMMONS.
(Hansard, June 26th, 1922. Vol. 156.
No. 84.)
ME. WINSTON CHUECHILD.
If I were to interpret the will of the
Irish Nation as expressed unmistakably at
this election, I would sum it up as fol-
lows : —‘ ‘ You have given us our freedom;
we wish to give you our friendship. You
will help us towards a United Ireland; we
will help you towards a United Empire.*’
That, I believe, is the true reading of the
Irish nation at the poll, and that indicates
the road along which we are marching,
and along which we are going to march.
Do not let us be drawn from it; do not
let us bring to confusion the wishes of the
great masses on both sides of the Channel.
I wish I could end here but I cannot. I
should not be dealing honestly and fully
with this subject if I left in the minds of
the House the impression that all that is
required is patience and composure. No,
sir. Eirmness is needed. Firmness is
needed in the interests of peace as much
as patience. The Constitution which we
have seen, which has been published,
satisfactorily conforms to the Treaty. It
has now to be passed through the new
Irish Parliament. There is no room for the
slightest diminution of the Imperial and
Constitutional safeguards and stipulations
which it contains. That is not all. MerQ


What ic Meant.
“Murderers” must be
hunted down not merely
ci led down.'
Collins has said the
Pact is moro important
than the Treaty, because
it ensures peace. He must
tear up the Pact, and
elcrtroy the Republican
institutions utterly the
Courts, the Cabinet, and
the Dail itself.
Submit or wo will crush
or starve you.
England is at the end
of her patience. She can
no longer wait for her
pound of Republican
flesh.
The '' Republicans are
the common enemy.
paper affirmations, however Important,
unaccompanied by any effective effort to
bring them into action, will not be
sufficient. Mere denunciations of murder,
however heartfelt, unaccompanied by the
apprehension of a single murderer, cannot
be accepted. The keeping in being within
the Irish Free State, by an elaborate
process of duality, merging upon duplicity,
the whole apparatus of a Republican
Government, will not be in accordance
either with the will of the Irish people,
with the stipulations of the Treaty or with
the maintenance of good relations between
the two countries.
The resources at the disposal of H.M.
Government are various and powerful.
There are military, economic and financial
sanctions—to use a word with whicli
frequently meet in Continental affamo-
ther e are sanctions of these kinds which are
available, and which are formidable. They
have been very closely studied, and the
more closely they are studied, the more
clearly it is seen that these measures will
be increasingly effectivejn proportion as
the Irish Government and State become
fully and more solidly organised. His
Majesty’s Government do not feel that
after this election has clearly shown what
are the wishes of the Irish people we can
continue to tolerate many gross lapses
from the spirit of the Treaty, and impro-
prieties and irregularities in its execution
with which we have put up and in which
we have acquiesced, during the last six
months ... -

pation of the Four Courts, of a band of

of the Republican Executive, Is a gross
breach and defiance of the Treaty . , «
The time has come when it is not unfair,
not premature and not impatient for us
to make to this strengthened Irish Govern-!
ment and the new Irish Parliament, d
request in express terms, that this sort ol
thing must come to an end. If it does
not come to an end, either from weakness,
from want of courage, or from some other
even less creditable reasons it is not
brought to an end, then it is my duty to
say, on behalf of H.M. Government, that
we shall regard the Treaty as having been
formally violated, that we shall take no
steps to legalise or to carry out its further
stages, and that we shall resume full
liberty of action in any direction that may
seem proper and to any extent that may
be necessary to safeguard the interests
■and the rights that are entrusted to our
care ...

Colonies if he had received information of
the kidnapping of David Pollock, son of
Sergeant-Major Pollock . . .
MR. CHURCHILL.
The reply to the first part of the question
is in the affirmative. Representations have
been made •to the Provisional Govern-
ment to secure Pollock’s release, and I
am hoping that he may be released to-day
or to-morrow.
