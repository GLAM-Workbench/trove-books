On moist earth underneath a stone in
Mr. Brown-Smith s vegetable garden
lay some jelly-like balls that didn t
look
important. But they were

One of them was speci-

fact that not one of
in spite
them had a plough. That is one ol
the ways in which earthworms are far
more wonderful than men. for no man
can plough without a plough.
When the day came for Walter to


leave his cocoon, out he came, a little,
wriggling earthworm, who didn t need
to be taught to plough, because he was
a born ploughworm. Soon, without
any plough, he began ploughing his
way through the soil of Mr. Brown-
Smith's vegetable garden.
As he had no plough, what did he
plough with?
He ploughed with his mouth, and
while he ploughed, he ate his meals.
Yes, he ate his way through the soil,
and. as he ate. he made his home larger
—we call his home a burrow —and he
also helped to improve the soil of Mr.
Brown - Smith’s garden, for,
like all earth-worms,he was

is that he was

decaying celery leaves, Walter’s fav-

plough, because it was very soft com-

THE SOIL WAS EASY
TO PLOUGH.


That is why worms often live near
rivers and ponds. Dry weather scarcely
troubled Walter at all because Mr.
Brown-Smith hosed the celery
bed. But even a worm can
have too much of a lV—f3 " good
thing, and one day Mr. Brown-Smith
hosed so hard that Walter was flooded
out of his home, and there he was on
the surface of the celery bed. Being a
resourceful worm, and knowing that
thrushes liked him as muc h
as some people like oysters,
he ploughed his way , back
into the soil as quickly as possible, and
soon was in a new home.

WALTER WAS FLOODED OUT.


Walter and Mr. Brown-Smith lived
in I oorak, and that is why Mr.
Brown-Smith had two names joined
together. Because Walter lived in
Toorak he was considered by other
worms who lived there to be a very
superior worm. In spite of this he
worked hard and was A /" a most

as all earth worms V are - for
the more they plough, the better the
soil is.
Besides being useful, Walter was
intelligent, and knew that the more he
ploughed the bigger and better vege-
tables the soil would grow, and that, by
ploughing with all his might and main,

And that brings us to the tragic part
of Walter's history. One day Mr.
Brown-Smith was digging above the
ground while Walter was ploughing
under the ground. Walter had almost
finished breakfast when suddenly his
world heaved and rocked and split.
In the midst of the rums of his home.
Walter lay still. Mr. Brown-Smith
didn t mean to wreck Walter s home
or to hurt him in any way, because
Walter helped him to grow bigger and
better vegetables. The trouble was
that, as Mr. Brown-Smith was digging
above the ground and Walter «
was ploughing
under the ground, they couldn't see one

another, and that was the cause of the
tragedy.
Poor Walter lay still for a long while.
At last he moved, sighed, and muttered:
“Oh dear, oh dear,
I feel so queer,”
T though he didn't usually
make up poetry. Then he
lay still for another long while. At last
he made up his mind to turn-
even a worm will turn, you
know—to turn and have a look at
himself to see what was making him
feel so queer. So he turned—turned and
saw a dreadful sight, for Mr. Brown-
Smith’s spade had
chopped him in two.


He felt dreadfully upset, and no
wonder, even though he was a very
brave worm. He lay still for another
long time, When he recovered a little
from the shock of seeing himself
chopped in two, he cried, “Oh dear, oh
dear!” and started —when from behind
him came a voice that
was exactly like his
own. Oh dear, oh dear, it cried.
At first Walter was too startled to
say anything, even to himself, bui
presently he muttered, ‘‘There s another
worm behind me who has
a voice exactly like mine!”
and turned to see who it was. d hen ne
nearly fainted! And, no wonder, for


there behind him was another worm.
yet not another worm,
because it was the
chopped-off part of poor Walter!
Walter stared at it. Presently it
said: “Please, sir, can you tell me who
I am?” Shock and surprise made poor
Walter stutter. “I . . . d-d-d-on’t
n-n-know,“ he stuttered. “Oh, dear!”
“Oh, d-d-d-dear! ’’ the other half
said. Then they were
silent.
You will of course, know that Mr.
Brown-Smith wouldn’t have done this
dreadfully cruel thing for the world if
he could help it, for, besides being a kind
man, he knew what a valuable assistant

as I used to when I was a whole worm,
therefore I will be able to
help Australia only half
as much as I used to.
Alas!” And now you know that he
was a great reasoner.
T he idea that he might not be able
to help Australia at all, or that, if he
could help her. he would be able to help
her only half as much as he used to,
made him feel very sad, for he was a
most patriotic worm.
Then he looked at the other half and
asked himself a question.
“Is he me or am I him?”
he asked himself, and you must excuse
his bad grammar, for he was very upset


HE THOUGHT DEEPLY.


He thought deeply about this ques-
tion. but couldn’t find an answer
though he was such a deep thinker, so,
squaring his shoulders, he said. “Even
if I'm only half a worm. I'll try to
plough, and. if I can plough, I’ll do my
best!” Then with a
cry of
AUSTRALIA!” he advanced and —
PLOUGHED!
The other half saw him ploughing,
and. because he was the other half of
Walter and therefore brave, he said to
himself, “If he can plough, p’raps I can
plough too.” and. squaring his shoul-
ders he—PLOUGHED!

Both halves of Walter Worm are
ploughing to thi r
day. As they
plough they try to decide whether they
are only Walter, or whether they are
Waiter-Waiter, for they are both deep
thinkers. Sometimes they think they
are two worms, sometimes they think
they are one worm. __
But whatever th e v
✓
think, they go on ploughing, for both
are brave, hard-working, and patriotic,
which shows what a specially brave,
hard-working and patriotic worm
Walter Worm must have been before
he was chopped in half.
