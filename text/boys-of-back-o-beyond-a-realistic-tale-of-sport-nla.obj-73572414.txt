BOYS OF BACK O? BEYOND
CHAPTER I
Happy Schoolmates
? OME on, you fellows, let?s have a race,?
suggested Tony Wainwright, urging his pony
to one side of the track and plucking a supple green
switch from a slender sapling.
? Righto?are you on, Wilfred ? ? smiled Reg
Stafford, enthusiastically addressing Tony?s elder
brother.
? Yes, you bet,? replied Wilfred. ? Just wait a
mo? till I get a switch.?
? All ready ? ? shouted Tony. ?Go ! ?
The three young riders, well off scratch together,
now urged their ponies forward pell-mell along the
bush track. The ponies were much of a size and
build, and in these respects there was not a very
great difference between their riders.
? Come on, Nugget! Get on, get on ! ? shouted
Tony, frantically urging on his steed with his legs
and elbows flapping madly in unison.
? Get up ! Get up ! ? shouted Wilfred and Reg.
Wilfred was now slightly in the lead of his com-
panions, and strove desperately to maintain his
advantage.


? Get up, Pet ! Come on there, old girl! Come
along ! U-u-u-up?over ! That?s right ! Good
little Pet ! ? as his steed cleverly manipulated a
log lying partly across the bush track.
Tony, the youngest of the three riders, was now
in the rear of his brother and Reg, but not for a
moment did he relax his efforts to make up the
leeway. Digging his heels into Nugget?s sides and
occasionally making use of the switch in his hand,
he rode so low that his head was nearly resting
on his steed?s withers. With all his young might
he urged Nugget forward, keeping his eye well on
the track in order to benefit to the full by every
chance that offered.
? Golly !? he suddenly shouted. ? Look out for
that marshy ditch ahead, Willie ! Look out, man ! ?
But he was too late. Willie?s steed, too slow in
taking off for the jump, had suddenly floundered in
the bog. The catastrophe unseated the rider, who,
taking a header over his pony?s ears, was neatly
deposited into the midst of the miry ditch.
Pet, having extricated her heels from the bog,
now scampered forward along the track, riderless.
Tony and Reg both successfully manipulated the
ditch, but rode on a considerable distance ere they
could bring their steeds to a standstill. Returning
to the scene of the catastrophe, both boys could
have laughed aloud at the spectacle now presented
by Wilfred.
Willie? -as Tony?s elder brother was often called?
was standing on a bank of the ditch shivering and
woefully mud-bespattered.

? All right, Willie ? ? questioned his brother?
anxiously, yet smiling.
? Y-y-yes, I-I-I?m a-a-all right ???shivering and
a trifle uncertain.
? Not hurt ? ? cut in Reg.
? N-no, I don?t th-th-think so ??disconcertedly.
? Golly ! It was a close shave, then ; and Pet
nearly got you with her heels as she extricated
herself,? said Tony. ? Sure you?re all right ???
? Yes . . . I?m all right,? returned Willie, a
little more confidently. ? But w-w-what are we
going to do now ? C-c-can?t go into s-s-school like
this.?
? Let?s see if we can wash some of it off,? smiled
Reg sympathetically.
Having discovered a tiny pool of water about
twenty yards down-stream, Tony and Reg, with
wet handkerchiefs, set to work vigorously to re-
move the muddy stains from Wilfred?s clothing.
At the end of a quarter of an hour Tony?s brother
appeared somewhat more presentable.
? Well, what next ? ? he asked. ? What the
d-d-deuce are we going to do now ? ?
? Oh, jump up behind me ! ? quoth Reg. ? Old
Grady can easily carry us both. We?ll be a bit
late for school, I guess. But it?s the only thing to
do.?
For a further three miles the boys rode on thus,
till they arrived at the school, situated in a small
suburb on the distant outskirts of the great city
of Melbourne.
? Well, I?ll be blowed ! ? exclaimed Tony, who


was riding in advance. ? Why, there?s old Pet,
standing at the school gate ?as innocent as they
make ?em.?
It was quite true. The many and customary
feeds of oats in the school yard apparently had not
been forgotten by the pony. Moreover, she actually
whinnied as Nugget and Grady drew near.
? ell, Pm blest ! She?s got a good cheek,
hasn?t she ? ? laughed Reg, as Wilfred jumped
down from behind him and walked with out-
stretched hand towards his steed. Pet submitted
quietly to being caught, and was quickly led to
her accustomed tree in the school yard, and there,
along with the other ponies, she was secured and fed.
The boys were twenty minutes late for school,
but beyond a good rating from the master they
got off unpunished after explaining what had
befallen them.
On release from lessons at twelve o?clock for the
luncheon hour the three boys, with some others
of their friends, made a wild rush for the cricket
gear. Reg and Tony secured a bat each, and two
boys, Pat Wheatley and Hugh Tanner, each got hold
of a composition ball. Wilfred collared the stumps,
and a merry procession set off for the far end of the
playground. There, under the shade of two big
gums, the stumps were pitched.
? Shall we pick sides ? ? asked Wheatley.
? Righto ! ? answered Reg. ? You and Tanner
toss for choice.?
? Heads or tails ? ? shouted Wheatley, extract-
ing a brownie from his pocket and spinning it aloft.


? Tails.?
? Heads it is, then. My first choice. I?ll have
Tony Wainwright.?
? Reg ! ? responded Tanner.
? Davie ! ?
? Wilfred ! ? ?and so on, until all the boys
present had lined up under their respective captains.
<� Loser of the toss has first knock ! exclaimed
Tanner.
Soon play commenced in earnest. Reg was a
good bat, and took the opening ball of the first
over. A single resulted. Wilfred then stood up to
the bowling. He was a passing bat, but, perhaps
still shaken by his morning?s ordeal, played clean
around the first ball he received.
? Got him ! Hurrah ! Middle stump ! ? shouted
Wheatley enthusiastically. ? Well done, Charlie ?
?addressing the young bowler.
At the end of twenty minutes the side of seven
were all disposed of for the meagre total of thirty-
five runs ?Reg carrying out his bat for a knock
of nineteen.
Tony and Wheatley then took the crease the
former being given first knock.
�� Well hit 1 ? shouted Wheatley, as Tony put the
first ball over the adjacent picket fence into a corn-
field.
The second ball he cut for a single?a stroke
which Wheatley repeated. The fourth ball Tony
drove to the off for a couple. Perhaps now he was
a trifle over-confident, for the next delivery he
skied at mid-off. The ball went into the hands of


a lad named Brown, a ginger-haired youth. But,
much to the disgust of his side, Brown let it spin
from his grasp.
? Lucky D ? shouted Reg to Tony. ? Send
one over this way ! ?
? Not me ! ? answered Tony ungrammatically.
? Blow ! Another six ! ?
? Here, Brownie, skip over the fence and get it
and atone for your butter-fingers ! ? yelled Tanner.
As over succeeded over the score mounted
steadily, until Wheatley and Tony Wainwright
between them had topped their opponents? score
without being separated.
? I say, you fellows,? suddenly shouted Reg,
u what about lunch ? The bell will be going in a
jiffy.?
? Yes, come on,? returned Tony, addressing his
fellow-batsmen; ? I suppose we?d better chuck
it.?
Laying down the bats and the ball?which were
immediately pounced upon by some of the junior
fry ?the Wainwrights and Reg, followed by Hughie
Tanner and Pat Wheatley, made their way across
the playground to the shade of another stately old
gum. Here lads of varying ages were playing
marbles, hop-scotch, or spinning their tops.
Extracting parcels of lunch from their pockets,
the five erstwhile young cricketers, seating them-
selves under the ample shade of the tree, fell to at
once with ravenous appetites.
? I say,? suggested Reg, ? what about a good old
water-melon after school ? Got any in stock, Pat ? ?


� Yes, tons,? replied Wheatley, whose father kept
a small shop near to the school, and usually did a
roaring trade in sweets, soft drinks and, in season,
with water-melons.
? Goodo ! Are you all on ? ?
? Yes, rather ! ? responded the others in a breath.
? Righto. Let?s take it down to the bridge.
Golly, it?s a long time since I had a really good
blow-out ! ? said Tony, rubbing his person in the
vicinity of his belt in pleasurable anticipation of
the feast in store.
The boys had scarcely finished their luncheons
ere the bell called them once more into the school-
house.
At four o?clock promptly, however, they were
released for the day. The five chums then raced
along to the little store.
While Pat went indoors to his home at the back
of the shop, his father, a kindly Irishman, attended
to the order of the merry, youthful quartet.
? Melons ripe, Mr. Wheatley ? ? asked Wilfred.
? Ripe, sonny ! Yes ; press them and see for
yerself.?
Each of the boys pounced on a melon and pressed
his whole weight upon it.
? Golly, yes, they?re ripe enough ! ? exclaimed
Tony, as each melon he tested in turn responded
with a crisp crunching sound under the pressure he
exerted upon it.
? You?ve got a nice lot in, Mr. Wheatley,? said
Reg. ? What price is this one ? ? ?indicating a
huge melon eighteen inches in length.


? Och ! Bedad ! Sure an? ye can have it for a
tanner,? was the good-natured reply.
? A tanner ! But there are only five of us,
Mr. Wheatley, and we can?t afford more?n a copper
apiece.?
? Awright, then ! Off you go, and don?t make
yerselves ill, for sure.?
With delighted grins the boys stumped up their
coppers, Reg putting in Pat?s share, as the lad had
not yet reappeared from behind the shop.
As Reg and Willie bore their burden out of the
shop Tony lingered over some of the sweets.
? What price the stickjaws, Mr. Wheatley ? ?
? Two a penny, me bhoy.?
? Blow, I?ve got no money ! ? dejectedly replied
Tony, turning out his pockets. Then, suddenly
brightening up as a brilliant idea suggested itself :
? I say, Mr. Wheatley, I?ll take a ha?porth of stick-
jaw on tick, please.?
? A whatta ? ?
? A ha?porth on tick.?
? A ha?porth on tick, will ye ? Bedad, what an
idea ! Sure an? it?s cheap enough at that, eh ?
Well, Ibe jibbered ?a ha?porth on tick ! Ha, ha !
Bless my soul, ye?ll be Chancellor of the Exchequer
some day, me bhoy ! Here ye are then, ye young
rascal.?
Grabbing the stickjaw, Tony made off hurriedly
to rejoin his companions, and was quickly joined
by Pat Wheatley. Seated under the shade of the
bridge, they lost no time in cutting out with a
pocket knife huge chunks from the cool, crisp


melon. Beautifully ripe, the interior of the melon
was scarlet in colour, and deliciously sweet and
refreshing. Such feasts were almost new to Hughie
Tanner, a comparatively recent arrival from the
Old Country.
? Didn?t they grow these sort of things over
there ? ? asked Wheatley.
? No. Sometimes, if you?re lucky, you can
buy little yellow things which they call water-
melons. They?re about the size of a toddler?s
football.?
? Ha, ha ! Why, them?s roc�-melons. Tons of
?em here, too. But I wouldn?t have a dozen for
one of these. Too sickly for me,? quoth Wheatley.
? Jove, yes ! ? chimed in Tony. ? Give me a
good old water-melon any time. I can eat it all
day and feel none the worse for it.?
? Me, too,? echoed some of the others.
? Didn?t you come out from England, Tony ?
you and Willie ? ? asked Tanner.
? No. We were born out here. My parents are
English, though, and Cyril, my eldest brother, was
born in the Old Country.?
? So was Keith, my eldest brother,? chimed in
Reg. ? Pater and Mater were English, too.?
? Yes, and it?s a bit strange, Reg, isn?t it,?
laughed Willie, ? both our mothers being daughters
of English clergymen ? ?
? Here, you fellows, who?s doin? the carving ?
Another chunk, please! ? interrupted Tanner.
? Golly, it?s goodo ! ?
? Aiiyone else ? ? asked Wheatley.


? Yes, rather ! Slice it all up, Pat, while you?re
about it, and then we can help ourselves.?
? Why do you fellows live so far away ? ? asked
Wheatley, addressing the outbackers.
? Oh, it?s great up there, over the ranges,? said
Reg. ? And the ride in every day to school is
ripping?isn?t it, Willie ? ?
? Yes ?sometimes.?
? Ha, ha ! I shall never forget this morning.
You did look a guy, and no mistake.?
? But why don?t you live a bit closer in ? ?
persisted Wheatley.
? Not if I know it,? replied Tony. ? Dad?s in
the Mercantile, and we?ve a decent old place, I
can tell you. Acres of ground?chock full of
flourishing shrubs and pine trees. Then the bush
and the fields, with the great gums all round ?
and the pond where we swim. Golly?no town for
me!?
? Me neither,? chimed in Reg.
? What does your father do ? ? asked Wheatley.
? Oh, Dad?s retired now. Was a colonel at one
time in the Indian Army. He and Mr. Wainwright
have both travelled a bit, and are great pals. My,
we have some good times, eh, Tony ? ?
? Jove, yes ! ?kangarooing, ?possuming, swim-
ming, parrot shooting ?no end of a good time in
the hols.?
? Mum?s brother, Mr. Wilshire, over in the west,
is going to ask us all to go over there during one
of the long hols,? said Reg. ? Gee whiz ! I wish
you and Willie could go with us, Tony.?


? Where does he live, Reg ? ?
? Somewhere down the Blackwood way, I think
it is?in the south-west. My, there?s some trees
for you ! ?judging by photographs, that is.?
? Have you any brothers besides Keith, Reg ? ?
asked Hughie Tanner inquisitively.
? No, only Keith. But I?ve a sister, Phyllis,
younger than me.?
? You?ve a lot of brothers and sisters, haven?t
you, Willie ? ? asked Wheatley.
? No. There?s Cyril, the eldest, our two selves,
and three sisters ?Kitty, Mary and Molly.?
? Are they all at home ? ?
? No. Cyril?s at the Grammar, and Kitty?s up
in the north. She?s married ?married a missionary
up there.?
? What?s his name again ? ? asked Reg. ? I
always forget.?
? Rev. John Strong?you old thickhead ! ?
? Golly, yes, of course ! I oughtn?t to forget
that, seeing your place is named after him.?
? Is that so ? ? asked Tanner interestedly.
? Yes. We were up there when we were kids.
There was trouble with the blacks,? said Wilfred.
? They kidnapped Tony, here. Then an expe-
ditionary party tracked them over fifty miles
through the forest. In the end there was a great
battle between the blacks and whites. Dozens of
the natives were killed. Mr. Strong rescued Tony,
but was speared himself, and nearly died. Tony
owes it to him that he?s alive to-day.?
? Gee, that?s exciting! ? exclaimed Hughie


Tanner. ? And that?s why you call your place
? Stronghurst.? I?d love to take a trip over the
ranges some day.? >
? Well, you must come up some time. But 1
guess we?d better be trotting along now, you
fellows ?what say ? ?
?Ay ! There?s nought left of the melon, any-
way,? laughed Hughie, standing erect and stretching
himself. ,
In this the rest followed suit. Then all moved
off towards the school-house, where the young out-
backers were to collect their horses.


CHAPTER II
7ony in Disgrace
SAD to relate ?only a few weeks after the happy
incidents just recorded ?Tony Wainwright was
suddenly to find himself in sad disgrace. The cause
of this sudden lapse was trivial enough. But the
event itself was destined to lead to far-reaching
results. Poor Tony !
The whole trouble arose one afternoon ?of all
places in the world ?at Sunday School. This was
held in a temporary church building, situated at
no great distance from the boys? day school. Each
Sunday afternoon, in the absence of a nearer place
of worship, Tony and Wilfred were in the habit
of riding over to this church to attend the Sunday
classes.
On the particular occasion in question, Tony sat
listlessly in his pew. The day was hot, and he was
tired after his long, dusty ride. Paying little heed
to the lesson being given, for a short while he gazed
about him aimlessly. Presently his fingers came
into contact with a small name-plate fastened to
the book-ledge of the pew in front of him. Absent-
mindedly he fingered this name-plate for a few
seconds until the card it contained slid from its
socket to the floor at his feet. He picked it up,


and then, for the first time, glanced at the printed
name thereon. Suddenly he chuckled to himself.
Then, nudging Harry Perkins, who sat next to him,
he whispered :
? I say, Perky, what a joke ! This must be where
old Piggy sits in church. Got a pencil on you ? ?
? Yes, here you are.?
? You won?t let on, will you ? ?
?Of course not. What do you take me for ? ?
Thereupon Tony turned the card over and, boy-
like, sketched in outline thereon a by no means
flattering caricature. It resembled in part a pig,
but possessed the arms and tail of a monkey.
Beneath this he scrawled in big boyish letters the
words : ? Old Piggy ? ?the boys? pet name for
Mr. Piggott, headmaster of the State school.
Having completed his artistry, Tony showed the
card surreptitiously to some of his young com-
panions, among whom it caused great amusement.
Unfortunately, however, Mr. Piggott?s daughter,
Ethel, happened to be in the same class. With
rising indignation, moreover, Ethel had noticed all
that had transpired, and knew only too well who
had perpetrated the wicked deed. Even to her
childish mind it represented an insult directly aimed
at her father. But, for the time being, though
feeling upset and angry, Ethel kept her own counsel
and said nothing.
Presently Tony Wainwright slipped the card
back again to its accustomed socket, with the
original printed name uppermost, and quickly for-
got all about it. His teacher?s eyes were now


TONY IN DISGRACE
centred upon him, so that he felt compelled, though
with reluctance, to give his mind somewhat to the
lesson being expounded.
Ere long, however, the instruction was brought
to a close. Then, after a hymn and a prayer, the
scholars were dismissed, and commenced to wend
their various ways homeward.
On the following morning Tony and Wilfred,
after their usual ride, duly turned up at the State
school. They were a little late as it happened,
and, blissfully ignorant of any trouble in store,
proceeded quietly to their accustomed places.
Scarcely had Tony reached his desk, however, ere,
with a vice-like grip on his arm, he was seized upon
by the infuriated master. Dragged from his place,
and compelled to confront the whole school, he was
submitted to a heated cross-examination.
tc What were you doing in Sunday School yester-
day, my man ? ?
Taken aback by the unexpectedness of such harsh
treatment, Tony stammered weakly :
? Nothing, sir 1 ?
? Nothing! What do you mean ? Did you not
draw something on the back of my name-card in
the church ? ?
Like a flash Tony recalled the incident. But who
could have split on me ? Perkins ? No ?ah, I
know?Ethel, Piggott?s daughter. Sneak! All
this flashed through his mind in an instant.
? Come, sir! Did you ? ? reiterated the master,
subjecting his victim to a vigorous shake.
But Tony now had his back up. His thoughts


were of Ethel. Tale-telling! The unpardonable
sin. A pity and contempt for the girl rose in his
mind.
? Come, answer me, sir ? ?with another vigorous
shake. ? Did you deliberately insult my good name
in the Sunday School yesterday ? ?
Like a flash, with shoulders squared, and looking
his master full in the face :
? No, sir, I did not.?
? That?s a lie ! ? thundered the master, and then,
losing all control of his Irish temper, ? Come with
me !
Tony was dragged into the vestibule.
? Ethel! Harry Perkins ! John Hunter ! Hugh
Tanner ! Sydney Waller ! Jane Cooper ! ?step out
of your places, all of you, and come here,? again
thundered the master.
Ethel, as she stepped forward, was looking very
triumphant. Tony glared at her. He had been
nothing but friendly with her in the past. Her
present attitude, therefore, he was at a loss to
understand. The other children called upon, how-
ever, were all downcast and appeared sympathetic.
They, too, from time to time darted malicious glances
in the direction of the triumphant Ethel. Mr
Piggott, addressing his daughter first, said :
? Now, Ethel, state in the presence of these
witnesses exactly what you saw yesterday.?
Ethel recited in detail the whole incident.
Then, in turn, each of the witnesses was called
upon and asked :
? Did you see Tony Wainwright draw that


picture on my card ? I want the whole truth, mind
you ! ???threateningly.
With eyes averted the children had no choice
but to answer in the affirmative.
? Now then ! Did you hear that, Wainwnght ?
What have you to say for yourself ? ?
? Nothing, sir ! ?
? What ! Do you deny before all these witnesses
that you committed that deliberate insult yesterday
by drawing on my card ? ?
Again, with squared shoulders and fearless eyes,
Tony answered :
? Yes, sir ! ?
? You little liar / ? retorted the master, now
purple in the face. ? I shall have to teach you a
severe lesson, I can see. Go back, all the rest of
you, to your places. Now, sir, hold out your
hand.?
Tony unflinchingly obeyed.
Taking a long, slender cane, Piggott first tested
its strength and suppleness by bending it into a
hoop. Then, in quick succession, twelve times he
brought it down, with all the force he could muster,
on Tony?s right hand.
? Now, sir, the other hand.?
Precisely the same number of cutting strokes
descended upon the boy?s left hand. Tony was
forced to cry out before it was over, but not once
did he withdraw his hand.
? Now, sir, have you had enough ? Do you still
deny it ? ? demanded the master.
? Yes, sir ! I did not insult ?


?Bend down then, sir!? The master, now
holding the boy firmly over his knee, delivered a
dozen more cutting strokes with his supple cane
with equal force as before. ? Now you can go back
to your place. I hope I have taught you a lesson
that you will remember all your life. Go back to
your place, sir ! ?
With set face, white and drawn, Tony Wainwright
quitted the vestibule and returned to his desk.
Instead of seating himself, however, he swayed
slightly and only barely managed to save himself
from falling.
? Sit down, sir ! ? roared the master.
? I ? ? ? I ? ? . I c-c-can?t, sir,? replied the boy
in agony.
? Then stand over there in the corner.?
Tony at once moved to obey, but ere he had taken
two steps he tumbled to the floor in a faint.
Instantly there was commotion. The children of
the school were horrified. Like a flash Wilfred,
Tony?s brother, darted out of his place and made
towards the heap on the floor. Mr. Piggott, the
master, now mopping his face with a large red
bandana, himself strode across, too, to where Tony
Wainwright lay. His manner seemed suddenly to
have changed. Even Wilfred could not help notic-
ing the master?s agitation. His hands visibly
trembled and, as he stooped down to take hold of
the child, his usually red face assumed a paler hue.
Between them master and scholar lifted Tony
from the floor ?a goodly weight he was, despite his
tender years. They then carried him into the


vestibule, where wash-basins and water were handy.
With a towel Mr. Piggott himself sponged the lad?s
face and brow. Then, loosing his shirt-collar he
fanned him with the aid of an exercise book which
was lying near. .
At the expiration of about ten minutes lony
came to. His hands were already swollen, and he
was trembling violently from head to foot.
? You had better ride home, Wilfred, and bring
the trap for him,? said Mr. Piggott presently.
te Your brother will not be able to ride his pony.
I will take him over to my house and lay him on
a sofa in front of the fire to await your return. Be
as sharp as you can.?
To get his cap it was necessary for Wilfred to go
through the schoolroom to the boys? vestibule. As
he passed through he could not help fe*_img ' La
tense, strained silence which now brooded over the
school. Glancing towards the desk usually occupied
by Ethel Piggott he looked daggers at the girl.
To his surprise, however, he noted that the wretched
girl was now in a flood of tears. It was only too
true. Above the strained, tense silence which
brooded over the scholars, Ethel Piggott s choking
sobs ?despite her utmost efforts at self-control
were all that could be heard.


CHAPTER 111
Mrs. Wainwright to the Rescue
WILFRED continued on his way towards the
boys? vestibule and, finally, seizing his cap,
bolted without to secure his pony. Mounting
quickly, he made, with all the speed he could exert
from Pet, for his home. After galloping the whole
distance he turned in at the paddock gate and rode
smartly up to the house. Looking at his watch,
he found it was not yet quite eleven o?clock.
Mrs. Wainwright, having heard the sound of the
funding hoofs on the hard gravel, had made her
way out on to the verandah. Seeing Wilfred, and
filled with a presentiment that something was
wrong, she rushed down the gravel path towards
him.
? What is it ? ? she inquired anxiously.
? Oh, nothing, mother,? replied Wilfred, scarcely
knowing what to answer.
? Wilfred, dear, tell me quickly ! ?
? Don?t worry, mum ! But I have promised
Mr. Piggott to take the trap along to the school.?
? But what has happened ? Is anything wrong ?
Has Tony met with an accident ? ?
? No, mother ! But he?s hurt slightly. I think
he?ll be all right soon, though,? answered the
nonplussed boy.


?Come, then, quickly,? said the perturbed
mother. ? I*ll help you harness the horse. Call
Henry, too.?
Henry was the general handy-man employed at
? Stronghurst.? .
? Oh, here you are, Henry ! Help Wilfred with
the horse and trap while I get changed,? hurriedly
exclaimed the lad?s mother as she turned and made
towards the house.
Soon the horse was harnessed to the trap and
driven round to the front door. Mrs. Wainwright,
having prepared herself for the journey, stepped
from the verandah and climbed up on to the seat
of the vehicle.
? But you?re not coming, mother ? ? protested
poor Wilfred.
? Of course I am,? was the reply.
So off they went ?mother and son ?at as fast a
pace as the roads and the steep descent would allow.
Wilfred, in his own mind, pondered desperately
over the new situation which had arisen. That his
mother would want to accompany him had never
dawned on his mind. Finally, however, he arrived
at the conclusion that, as his mother would soon
be in full possession of the facts of the matter, he
might just as well make a clean breast of it and
tell her everything himself. She would then be
prepared beforehand as to what to expect, and,
knowing the full truth, would be better able to
deal with the situation. All this passed through
his young mind like a flash.
In answer to his mother?s repeated questioning,


therefore, Willie finally gave her an unvarnished
account of the whole story.
In silence Mrs. Wainwright listened to the sad
tale of her baby boy?s undoing. But when the
facts of the awful flogging were made known to her,
and the resultant collapse of Tony, she was moved
to anger and indignation. With face set and white
she questioned her son very closely, but kept her
own counsel.
Shortly after noon the trap drew up in front of
Mr. Piggott?s residence. With wonderful self-con-
trol Mrs. Wainwright stepped down from the vehicle
and walked to the front door. In response to her
pull on the bell-knob the door was presently opened
by Mr. Piggott himself. At sight of the red-faced,
burly Irishman, Tony?s mother momentarily lost
entire control of her feelings.
? You coward of a man,? she cried. ? What do
you mean, Mr. Piggott, by such gross ill-treatment
of my child ? You will be severely reprimanded.
Wilfred would tell me nothing voluntarily. I have
had to drag the story from the boy?s lips. But I
now know all the facts. Where is Tony ? ?
? Excuse me, Mrs. Wainwright ! I should like ...?
? Enough, sir ! Bring me my child.?
? My dear lady, it?s hardly fair that . . .?
? Will you bring Tony this instant, sir, or must
I fetch him for myself ? ?
In vain did the master endeavour to get in a word
apologetically.
? Mrs. Wainwright ?please ? -please ?listen to me.
I am extrem . . .?


? Yes, I dare say you are sorry, you have good
reason to be. Whatever my boy did there was no
justification for your brutal treatment of him.
Are you going to bring him to me ? ? she challenged
finally.
Mr. Piggott was now more than subdued. In the
face of such an onslaught he could see that apologies
were useless. He suddenly grew afraid of this
woman ?afraid, too, of the consequences of his rash
punishment of her boy.
At that moment Mrs. Piggott came to her
husband?s rescue. In her arms, laboriously, she
carried the helpless Tony, who was still too overcome
to walk. The mother gathered her twelve-year-old
child into her arms and bore him off to the trap.
With Wilfred?s assistance she laid him gently on to
an opossum rug which was spread out in readiness
to receive him. Then, having climbed into the
vehicle herself, she gathered up the reins and drove
quickly away ?not trusting herself to say more.
Wilfred, in obedience to his mother?s instructions,
now wended his way into the school grounds.
Avoiding as best he could the many eager young
questioners who flocked towards him, he secured his
brother?s pony, Nugget, and made for home.
In the meanwhile Mrs. Wainwright was driving
to the residence of the local doctor. Dr. Humphrey,
on first examining the child, was incredulous that
any master could have acted so callously and
brutally to a lad of such tender years.
? This matter, Mrs. Wainwright,? he said,
? should really be brought to the notice of the


authorities. Such utter brutality must be exposed
?if only for the sake of other children. This is not
the first occasion on which Piggott has let his Irish
blood get beyond his control. Will you allow me,
as a member of the board, Mrs. Wainwright, to deal
with this case ? ?
? Oh, I don?t know, doctor. I hardly know what
to do or think. My husband is away. He may be
back to-morrow or the following day. I think it
had best be left in his hands. Ido not wish to do
anything which later I may have cause to regret.
I?m afraid I?ve already been a little harsh towards
Mr. Piggott. If you do not mind, doctor, I would
rather no official steps be taken in the matter just
at present.?
? That?s just as you wish,? was the reply. ? The
boy has had a bit of a gruelling. However, he?ll
soon be all right again?won?t you, Tony, old man ? ?
? Yes ?I?H soon be all right ?Dr. Humphrey,
I?m all right now, I think.?
? That?s right, my lad! Game for anything,
eh??
? Well, thank you, doctor,? gratefully exclaimed
the mother, who, with Tony, was now seated in the
trap once more, and ready to set off for home.
? That?s all right, Mrs. Wainwright. Just follow
out those few instructions, and in less than a week
Tony wdll be as right as rain. Better keep him
home for about a fortnight, I think. Good after-
noon ! Good-bye, Tony, old man ! ?
? Good-bye, doctor ! ?
On arrival at ? Stronghurst ? Tony, when lifted


from the vehicle, found he could walk indoors
almost unaided. His body still ached dreadfully
and his hands were so swollen as to be practically
useless, but both he and his mother were thankful
for small mercies.
The following evening Mr. Piggott himself called
at ? Stronghurst.? In his anxiety to lose no time
in expressing personally his regrets, he had availed
himself of a taxi to convey him from his residence.
Strangely enough, John Wainwright, Tony?s
father, turned up at home very soon after the school-
master?s arrival.
To both the parents Mr. Piggott was most humbly
apologetic.
? I can assure you, Mr. Wainwright,? he said,
? that I shall never be guilty again of administering
such extreme corporal punishment upon any child.?
? No, I should imagine not ?even if you get the
opportunity to do so,? was Mr. Wainwright?s terse
reply.
? Just what do you mean by that, Mr. Wain-
wright ? Surely you do not mean . . . ? ?
? I mean just this. A man who can do what you
have done ought to be relieved of all further
responsibility where children are concerned.?
? Mr. Wainwright ?I place my future upon your
generosity. lam sorry. I acted yesterday upon
impulse. My temper, I admit, got the better of
my discretion. I hope you will be compassionate.
Publicity, of course, will terminate at once my long
career in the department. My pension will thus be
forfeited. I shall be a ruined man.?


26 BOYS OF BACK O? BEYOND
? Well, look here, Piggott ! I believe this time
you are in earnest. Insomuch, therefore, that my
boy himself was far from blameless on this occasion,
I am prepared to see that the matter will proceed
no further. Now ?good day to you ! ?
? Good evening, Mr. Wainwright ?and thank
you ! I shall not betray your confidence in me.?
That night, as Tony lay abed, he took the first
opportunity of expressing to his mother his sorrow
for what he had done.
? But, mummy,? he added. ?It was being
openly accused before the whole school, and . . .
and . . . that look on Ethel Piggott?s face when
she told, that got my back up.?
? Poor little darling. But you should have told
the truth, you know. Never be afraid of the truth,
Tony dear.?
? But, mummy ?really and truly speaking, I did
answer old Pig ?I mean the master, truthfully.?
? Did you, my son ? ?
? Yes, I did ?really and truly. When Mr.
Piggott asked me about the drawing on the card I
refused to answer him. But afterwards, when he
asked me if it was true that I had deliberately
insulted him, I at once replied straight out that I
had not insulted him. I had never thought of
insulting him. The whole affair in Sunday School
was only a bit of a lark. So I did not really tell a
lie, did I ? ?
? No, Tony dear, perhaps not. But you pre-
varicated.?
? What does ?prevalicate mean, mummy ? ?


? It means, my son, to evade the truth by round-
about methods ; to convey deliberately a wrong
impression. When you so hotly denied insulting
Mr. Piggott he naturally interpreted your reply as
a denial of drawing that ridiculous picture on his
card. Your answer, Tony dear, was capable of a
double meaning. It conveyed a wrong impression,
and therefore it was not quite honest of you.?
? Mummy, Pm truly sorry.?
? Always remember, Tony dear, that there is
such a thing as acting untruths as well as telling
untruths. To be quite, quite honest, we must
guard against both these forms of deceit. We must
always be perfectly open and face the whole truth
manfully ?regardless of what it may sometimes
cost us.?
? Yes, I?ll always try to remember, mummy
darling, and won?t prevalicate any more.?
? Prevaricate , dear ?P-r-e-v-a-r-i-c-a-t-e.?
? Will you write it out in big letters for me, mum
?on a card ? Then I?ll hang the card over my bed,
so that I?ll never forget. And you?ll really and
truly forgive me, won?t you, mummy darling ? ?
? Yes, yes ? ?as her arms suddenly enfolded her
son in a warm embrace, and the tears glistened in
her eyes ?? of course I will, dearest.?
? Mummy, if only that girl hadn?t looked quite
so triumphant, I should never have per ?prevari-
cated. How I hated her looking like that. And I
can?t help it, but I still hate her?little cat ! ?
? Ssh, Tony, you mustn?t say that! I?m sure she
is now bitterly sorry. In fact, her father himself


told us that she cried all that day, and would not
be comforted.?
? I will try, mummy, to forgive her.?
? All right, my son ?now good night.?
?Good night, mummy? ?and the two fondly
embraced.
But, though Tony now had made his peace with
his mother, and though he fully determined in his
heart to forgive his betrayer ?yet deeply in his
bosom were implanted the seeds of hatred towards
both his school and schoolmaster alike. Nothing
could efface from his consciousness the disgrace to
which he had been subjected before all the school.
A fortnight later, when declared well enough to
resume his studies again, no longer did he and
Wilfred set forth in the early mornings with the
old joyous anticipations of the ride. To a point,
the harm which had been inflicted speedily proved
irreparable. On his daily ride Tony?s mind now
was occupied with gloomy forebodings. His hatred
of the master and of the school grew daily more and
more deeply rooted. This new attitude of mind,
as is only to be expected, was soon, alas, to lead to
further painful consequences.


CHAPTER IV
Further Trouble , and a Resolve
TONY WAINWRIGHTS conduct and frame
of mind during the days that followed were
causes of grave concern to his mother. To her
great sorrow, Mrs. Wainwright observed that her
little boy now frequently attempted to simulate
illness, or invented excuses as pretexts for being
allowed to exempt himself from school. Sometimes
the boy managed ?successfully, as he thought ?to
hoodwink his mother. But if his father himself
happened to be home, all Tony?s pleadings and
tricks proved of little avail.
Mrs. Wainwright?s concern for her son was at
length confided to her husband ?without, however,
arousing much sympathy from that quarter.
? I do think, John,? she had said, ? that it would
be wise for us to send the boy to another school.
It will be difficult, of course, to send him to any
other State Primary, as we are resident within the
prescribed area of that under Mr. Piggott. But I
feel that something must be done. The boy is
plainly in revolt against his present school and all
connected with it.?
? My dear,? was the reply, ? our son has to learn
discipline like any other boy. The whole trouble


is chiefly of his own making. He must now face
the consequences like a man. It will be for his
good to let him battle his own way through.?
? Well,? returned his wife, ? I can?t help feeling
that it?s wrong to force the boy in this way, and
that no good will come of it.?
As subsequent events proved, Mrs. Wainwright?s
fears were fully justified.
On several occasions of late Tony and Wilfred,
though they had set off from home in the morning
at the usual hour, had absented themselves from
school throughout the whole day ?unknown to
their parents. They had discovered a fine sand-
patch under the hillside, a considerable distance
from the road. To this secluded nook they directed
their ponies, and spent the time of their lives digging
and delving in the dry, loose white sand. By
digging out deep tunnels therein they were enabled
to crawl several feet under the surface and make
their w r ay, by intersecting tunnels, to the surface
again. Such sport proved to them a very welcome
diversion from the monotony of the hated school
routine.
But the frequent absences from school of Tony
and Wilfred were beginning to create suspicions
in the mind of their schoolmaster. Mr. Piggott
had already determined, should his suspicions prove
correct, upon a line of action. Rather than punish
the boys himself he would acquaint Wainwright of
their conduct, and submit to him a list of the dates
on which his boys had failed to appear at school.
It was not malice which urged the master to take


FURTHER TROUBLE, AND A RESOLVE 31
this step. He was responsible to his employers for
the regular attendance at the school of all his
scholars. Mr. Piggott, therefore, was moved wholly
by a sense of duty. That his Irish temper some-
times prevailed over his better judgment was quite
true. But it would be an injustice to suppose that
he cultivated open hostility or malice towards even
the most wayward of his pupils.
Before long, this contemplated note to Mr. Wain-
wright was duly despatched. At the time he
posted it the master well knew that Wainwright
himself would be at home, and therefore that the
matter would receive immediate and sympathetic
attention.
Needless to say, Mr. Piggott?s letter, on delivery
at ? Stronghurst,? proved a great shock to the
parents of the lads. No suspicion that their boys
had been deliberately playing truant had as much
as crossed their minds. It was difficult for them
to imagine that Tony and Wilfred could be guilty
of such a misdemeanour.
According to John Wainwright, ? playing the
wag ? for a lad was an unpardonable sin. Hence
he now set to work to study carefully the list of
dates submitted by Mr. Piggott.
? I fear the headmaster must be right, Jane,? he
finally concluded.
? I can?t ?and, John ?I won't believe it,? was his
wife?s decisive answer.
? Jane, my dear, we must look facts in the face.
This letter was sent this morning. Apparently the
boys have not turned up even to-day. They cer-


tainly set off for school this morning. What has
become of them ? ?
? They must have been delayed on their way in.
There?s nothing to show that they did not eventually
arrive at their school. They probably got there
after the letter was posted.?
? H?m ! I don?t think so. What about this list
of dates submitted by Piggott ? ?
? Well, you know , John, we had to keep the boys
home once or twice. One occasion was when
Nugget cast a shoe. A second time was when poor
Tony had what I thought might turn out to be ring-
worm. Another occasion it was measles.?
? Ringworm and measles, fiddlesticks ! ?a mere
touch of frost, or prickly heat. Jane, I?m far from
satisfied that all is right. But we?ll soon see when
the boys come home to-day.?
Unknown to his wife, Wainwright mentally
resolved that such conduct on the part of his boys,
if admitted, would not be repeated by them in a
hurry. He would deal with the lads severely on
this occasion. Frequently he had caned them for
more trivial offences, but he considered now that he
had been too sparing in the past.
Shortly after five o?clock the two lads duly
returned home ?as though from school. Having
disposed of their ponies, they entered the house?
little dreaming of the warm reception in store for
them.
John Wainwright, desirous of avoiding a scene
before his wife, pounced on the boys immediately
they stepped within doors.


? Wilfred and Tony, I wish to speak with yon !
Go straight along to the office ! ?
The boys exchanged fearful and knowing glances.
Previous experience had taught them the meaning
underlying such a command.
The office was at the far end of the house. Shakily,
Wilfred and Tony walked the distance of the long
veranda. Finally, opening a door, they entered
the gloomy ? court of justice.? Then they heard
their father?s footsteps echoing from the interior
hall. With each step he took the grim sound grew
more and more terrifying to their guilty consciences.
A door was opened and closed. Their father was
now striding through a bedroom adjoining the office.
Creak, creak, creak, and the steps had reached to
the office door. Then the handle of the office door
was sharply turned. With trembling knees the lads
found themselves confronted now by their uncom-
promising parent.
? Where have you boys been to-day ? ?
? On the sand-patch, father.?
? What sand-patch ? ?
? Below the ranges.?
? What did you go there for ? ?
? Because, father,? replied Tony, with head erect,
? I hate school ?I hate it, and I hate Mr. Piggott.?
? Oh, you do, do you ? How often has this sort
of thing happened ? ?
Silence.
? Wilfred, how often have you boys been playing
truant from school ? ?
? I dunno, father.?


? Is this the first occasion ? ?
? No.?
?Do you realize what this means ? Not only
have you been disobedient?you?ve been deceitful
as well. Such conduct will break your mother?s
heart. I?m glad, of course, you?ve owned to the
truth. Nevertheless, for some months past you?ve
been deliberately acting lies. That?s a good deal
worse than telling lies. Now I?m going to give you
each a thrashing?one, I hope, you won?t forget
in a hurry. Bend down, sir ! ? ?to Wilfred.
Securing one boy at a time over his knee, the
father proceeded to put his threat into immediate
execution, and the supple cane descended fast and
heavily.
Both Wilfred and Tony could show courage and
endurance in receiving punishment when, as was
ordinarily the case, they were allowed to stand up
to it. But now, taken by surprise, they revolted
against such treatment in no uncertain sound.
As each in turn was compelled to submit, by an iron
grip on his collar, he gave vent to wild screams
which echoed through every room of the large
building.
By the time Mr. Wainwright was nearly through
with the second delinquent, the door leading
from the bedroom suddenly flew open and his
wife rushed wildly into the office and towards
her husband.
? How dare you ! ? she angrily exclaimed, as,
snatching the cane unsuspectingly from his grasp,
she broke it into fragments across her knee. Then,


FURTHER TROUBLE, AND A RESOLVE 35
towards her sons, she took one under each
arm and hugged them protectingly.
? Jane! What is the meaning of this inter-
ference ? ?
? I will not have all the spirit taken out of my
boys in this manner,? was the heated reply.
?I cannot understand you, Jane! I wished to
relieve you of the painful necessity of dealing
with them. Do you know that for the past two
months these brats have been playing truant
frequently from school ? They have got to learn
a lesson.?
? They shall not be punished like this in my house,
John. There are better and more humane ways of
dealing with them.?
So saying, and with no further protest from her
husband, Mrs. Wainwright accompanied the boys
from the room.
Wilfred and Tony soon found their way over to
the stable. There they climbed up into the loft
and sank down comfortably upon the soft ripe hay.
Ere long they were engaged in an animated discus-
sion upon the future.
? Let?s clear out to-night, Wilfred,? began Tony.
? I?ve had enough of this.?
?Me too. But where shall we go ? ?
? Oh, anywhere.?
? What about Boondah, then ? I once went there
with Mr. Stafford and Reg.?
?Righto! That?ll do. Shall we set off
to-night ? ?
? Yes ?the sooner the better ?midnight to-night,


if you like. We?ll take some rugs with us, and as
much food as we can carry in our swags.?
? We?ll need a billy-can.?
? You bet?and plenty of matches ! ?
? Boondah?s a long way away, isn?t it ? ?
? Only thirty miles.?
? Could we ever walk that distance ? ?
? Walk it ? Never fear ! We can take our time.
We?ll keep to the main road a few hours. By the
time Dad gets his search party out after us the
traffic on the road will have rubbed out our tracks.?
? We?ll have to change our names, then, Willie.
P?raps someone might meet us and ask us who we
are, and where we?ve come from. We must have a
decent answer ready, you know.?
? Yes, you bet.?
? What names shall we adopt ? ?
? Let?s see,? said Wilfred, pondering deeply.
? I think I?ll be Starlight,? exclaimed Tony
enthusiastically.
? Don?t be a fool, Tony ! ?
? Starlight?s all right!?and you, Willie, can be
Ned Kelly ! ?
? We?re not bushrangers and cut-throats, you
silly ass ! Besides, did you ever hear of Starlight
tramping it ? ?
? What about taking old Nugget and Pet, then ? ?
? No, of course not. Dad would soon find us
then. We?d always have to stick to the tracks.
And, besides, how?d we feed our ponies in the
bush ? ?
? We could hobble ?em out ?like Starlight did.?


FURTHER TROUBLE, AND A RESOLVE 37
? Yes, and lose them. No, Tony, we?ll have to
be sundowners this trip.? <
? Well, what names shall we decide on ?
One nom de guerre after another was suggested.
The boys finally, however, fixed upon ? Hardy.?
? I?ll be Jim Hardy,? said Tony.
? Righto, and I?ll be Frank ! ?
The boys were now in high spirits. With great
glee and much laughter they set about familiarising
themselves with their newly-adopted incognitos.
? Well, that?s settled, then, Jim,? finally con-
cluded Wilfred.
? My oath, Frank !?to-night at twelve o clock?
the great venture .?


CHAPTER V
The Sundowners
Like most Australian boys?being well accus-
tomed to camping expeditions?Wilfred and
Tony knew precisely just what they should require
for their long tramp.
Setting to w'ork without delay, therefore, they
collected together their outfits and rolled them into
two swags. First they invaded the pantry, then
the store-room, and lastly the spare bedroom, and
took from each only such things as would not
speedily be missed.
Before long they had everything in readiness?
not overlooking even the seeming triviality of a
plentiful supply of matches. It did not once occur
to either of the lads that they were ? pilfering.?
So accustomed were they to preparing for similar
jaunts, or camping expeditions in the bush, that
what they were now doing seemed all on a par with
previous occasions.
Of ready cash the two boys were enabled to
extract a fair supply from their own iron savings
banks. This was effected by the simple expedient
of inserting a table-knife into the slots. After tilting
the boxes the coins slid out of their own accord upon
the smooth polished surface of the knife.


No sooner had they got all in readiness and
deposited their swags safely in the loft than the
supper gong sounded. Feeling in better spirits than
they had done for a long time, the boys then
returned to the house.
? Our last meal at home,? whispered Tony as
together they entered the large dining-room.
During supper the family maintained a gloomy
silence. Recent events had not tended towards
cheerfulness. Apparently each member of the
family was occupied with reflections the reverse
of happy ?Wilfred and Tony alone excepted. But
the boys kept their thoughts well to themselves.
Little did the parents dream what was in the
minds of their two sons. Perhaps it was just as
well. But the morrow would bring the awakening.
So, at least, thought Wilfred, as he munched away
contentedly at his meal?longing with all his heart
for the advent of the midnight hour.
After supper the evening dragged on every bit
as gloomily as had the evening meal. John Wain-
wright was deeply immersed in his newspaper, the
Melbourne Argus. The boys? mother was busily
engaged in darning stockings. She had at her side
a pile of hosiery in various stages of wear and rents
and tears. Occasionally she sighed wearily as,
rolling up a completed pair of stockings, she sur-
veyed with dismay the stack which still remained
to be tackled ?a stack which, to her, seemed never
to dimmish in size.
When the dining-room clock struck the hour of
nine John Wainwright, glancing up from his news-


paper over the rim of his spectacles, suddenly broke
the tense silence which had pervaded the room.
? Boys?Wilfred and Tony ?off to bed with
you ! ?
With a feeling of intense relief Wilfred and Tony
laid aside their lessons. According to custom they
then kissed each of their parents good night. In
kissing their fond mother, however, they hugged
her a trifle more warmly than was their wont.
Molly, their young sister, had already gone to bed,
while Miss Jobson, the governess, was busy,
probably, in tucking her up safely for the night.
? I say, Willie,? said Tony, on entering the bed-
room which they shared between them, ? let?s write
poor Mum a note. I don?t like leaving her at all.?
? Yes, all right, Tony. Got any paper ? I?ve
got a pencil in my pocket.?
? Dash ! Wait a mo? ?I believe there?s a loose
sheet in my ? Robinson Crusoe.? Yes, here you
are.?
? Goodo ! ?
Together they then concocted a brief message
which, when completed, read somewhat dramati-
cally as follows :
? Darling Mum,
? Good-bye ! We can?t stand it (meaning
the school and the floggings) any longer. Sorry,
for your sake. Mummy dear, please forgive us.
? (Signed f) Wilfred,
Tony ?


As the would-be truants had no desire that their
note should be discovered too early on the following
morning, it was placed at length, under the crumb
tray, on a shelf in the kitchen.
? We shall be safe, anyway,? quoth Tony, ? till
after breakfast. And even then no one will know
where we?ve gone to. Poor Mummy, though?
when she reads it ! I wonder if she?ll faint.?
The hands of Wilfred?s watch now pointed to
nine-thirty. The remaining hours for sleep the boys
divided equally between them, deeming it necessary
that one should remain awake as caller-up. Wilfred,
being the elder, volunteered to take first watch.
Accordingly Tony, without undressing, prepared
himself for an hour and a quarter?s slumber.
With final and anxious instructions to Willie not
to go to sleep while on duty, Tony lay down to get
what sleep was possible during the brief period at
his disposal.
To him it seemed no time, however, ere he was
rudely awakened by his brother. Rubbing his eyes,
he looked about him dreamily and wearily for a few
seconds, exclaiming : ? Here, I say ! What the
dickens . . .?
? S-h-h ! Come on, Starlight ? ?in subdued tones
from his brother ?? out of it ! A fine Starlight
you?d make ! ?
? Oh, awright ! awright ! ? responded Tony,
dragging his weary limbs out of bed. ?Go on ?
jump in ! I?m awright now. But mind you get
up as soon as I call you ! ?
Seated wearily on the bed, Tony found it very


difficult to remain awake. A small candle, carefully
shaded, guttered and burned dimly on the dresser.
All was silent, and the big house seemed sunk in
gloom.
? I s?pose they?ve all gone to bed by now,? the
grim watcher reflected to himself. ?By golly, it?s
cold ! I wonder what it?s like outside.? Stumbling
towards the window and lifting a corner of the
blind: ?Gee whiz! Clinking! Jolly good moon
and a clear, cloudless sky ! Couldn?t be better.
Weather?s turned out trumps for our escapade ?a
real, proper midsummer night.?
Presently, taking his book and crouching as near
as possible to the candle-light, the young night-
watchman proceeded to wile away the time with
? Robinson Crusoe.? So absorbed did he become
that, losing all count of time, he was presently
startled by the big dining-room clock striking with
dull metallic sound ?the midnight hour.
Quickly he jumped to his feet. After quietly
awaking Wilfred, he stole out of the room. Very
gingerly he paced the hall passage, and then, after
opening the back door, stepped outside and made
off for the stable. Before long he was joined by
his elder brother. With cat-like steps the two
boys now crept up into the loft to gather up
their swags.
? Sure you?ve got everything, Jim ? ? quoth
Wilfred, alias Frank Hardy, as they were about to
quit the loft,
? Yes ?I think so, Frank. What about you ? ?
? Yes, all serene.?


? Come on, then?quick march ! ?to glory and
renown ! ?
Light-heartedly the truant sundowners stole
across the back paddock, and then made for the
main road. Jogging along gaily, they nevertheless
kept a wary look-out for chance travellers.
? Lucky so far,? quoth Jim.
?My stars, yes ! It?s a lucky moon to-night,
though. See how the old bloke?s smiling on us up
there in the dizzy ! ?
? But, I say, Frank, listen to that rotten old dog
barking ! Think he?ll give the show away ? He
seems to know all about it, anyway. It?s a mercy
dogs can?t talk, eh ? I wish he?d stop barking,
though.?
? Oh, don?t worry about an old dog. They bark
at anything. Probably he?s excited about some old
tom cat ?perched on a wall.?
On the truants plodded with their swags. Occa-
sionally they were startled by little furry grey
opossums scuttling across their path to the nearest
gum tree. Many an opossum they sighted high
up in the tall eucalypti, their silvery fur silhouetted
by the great orb of the moon. Others they could
hear munching below in the lower saplings, heartily
enjoying themselves among the luscious suckers
which grew in rich profusion round the bases of the
forest giants. Sometimes an owl hooted at them
nearby, or a startled bat darted blindly from out
the hollow of an old dead gum.
Plodding eagerly forward, the truants travelled
a good eight miles ere quitting the high road for


the trackless bush. Another half-hour took them
well away from the clearings which here and there
lay on either side the road. They found themselves
enveloped now by the bush of the back o? beyond.
But neither of them felt afraid of the gloomy forest.
Often at nights they had spent hour after hour in
the silent woods, ?possuming with their old dog
Rover.
With the steady approach of dawn, however, the
air began to grow colder. A feeling of chill stole
over the boys?intensified, no doubt, by the dark
forest which enveloped them.
? Let?s light a fire, Frank,?
? Yes. Righto ! Boil the billy, too, I guess, and
have some grub.?
? Oh, goodo ! I?m ready for something to eat,
aren?t you ? ?
? My oath ! ?
Presently they stumbled against an old decayed
blackboy stump. Kicking at the resinous leaves of
this highly inflammable growth, Tony put a match
to it. At once a fierce blaze lit up the gloomy bush.
For a few moments the young truants basked hap-
pily before the welcome glow and warmth of the
fire. Then Tony, releasing the billy ?already filled
with water ?from his swag, balanced it on two
stout logs, right in the heart of the cheery blaze.
On such a fire the billy soon began to sing merrily
enough.
? Get your grub out, Tony. I ?I ?mean ?
Jim.?
? ?Eres, tow it, Frank ! Don?t go an? give the


show away to all the blinkin? cookaburras about
here ! Them birds can talk, you know.?
The vocabulary of the two young sundowners at
times was quite meritorious. It would have done
credit to many an older hand.
Jim Hardy, as the bearer of the stores, unrolled
his swag and quickly spread out its contents.
? Hey, Frank?billy?s boiling ! Nip the tea in
quick and take it off ! ?
? Jove, this is good ! ? quoth Frank a little later,
as the two prepared to enjoy a hearty meal.
? Rather! Fit for the gods! Tons of tea,
tucker ?and a fire fit to roast an ox ! What more
could anybody wish for ? ?
? The old fire puts new life into one. I guess we
can afford an hour for rest here, Jim.?
? Yes ?I votes it.?
? Seconded ! ?
? Carried unanimously ! ?
Frank, with his watch, timed the hour to the
second. Then, jumping up hastily, he exclaimed :
? Well, mate, better be making tracks, I guess ! ?
This without the glimmer of a smile.
? Yes, I ?spect so.?
Almost simultaneously the pair of them jumped
up from their warm bed of leaves near the fire and
stretched their limbs. After collecting and rolling
up their gear, they were on the ?wallaby? again.
Being well away from the road by this time, the
young tramps threw discretion to the winds.
A veritable forest of blackboys was presently
encountered.


? I say, Willie ?dash ! Frank, I mean ? (Tony?s
first slip), ? let?s light up some of these old boys !
Golly, what a blaze they?d make ! ?
? Righto ! ?
The thick, matted rushes of some of these black-
boys hung downward nearly five feet in length.
To the young tramps, well supplied with matches,
they offered a tempting bait.
? Gee whiz ! ? cried Jim, ? look at that big feller
over there ! I guess its fierce, crackling blaze could
be seen for miles around. Just as well there?s no
one about.?
It did not seem to strike the young tramps that
in lighting so many fires they were leaving a very
substantial trail in their wake. They were both far
too intent on the fun to enter into such practical
considerations.
Presently, as the first red streaks of dawn shot
over the hillside, the truants, tiring of the blackboy
lighting, resumed their journey. To their surprise
they next lighted upon a large ploughed paddock
stretching to their right as they travelled north-
ward.
? Jove, a brilliant idea ! ? suddenly exclaimed
Frank.
? What ? ?
? Why?let?s walk over that field with our boots
tied on back to front ! Gee whiz ! When they see
our tracks, they?ll think we?ve come from the
opposite direction. Won?t they be rattled ! ?
With great glee this brilliant suggestion was put
into operation. Securing their boots in reverse


position on to their feet as best they could with
the leather laces, the boys hopped over the fence.
Then in the soft, newly-ploughed earth they pro-
ceeded to make as deep impressions as possible.
? Stars, Frank, what a brain wave that was of
yours ! I reckon this will have ?em all fairly
snoozled. Jove, what a joke !
? J?d like to be here somewhere, wouldn t you,
and hear what they say ? ?
? j 0V e, yes 1 They?ll wonder how the dickens
we got to the other side of the field first.?
? Ha-ha-ha 1?
The young swaggers laughed long and heartily
over their joke. It did not matter to them that
Jim?s reversed boots slipped off occasionally, and
that distinct imprints were sometimes left behind
of stockinged footmarks pointing in the direction
they were proceeding. Such tell-tale evidences did
not worry them at all. It is doubtful if they even
noticed such details.
On their arrival at the far side of the field Jim
said :
? Let?s cross over again a bit higher up, Willie -
blow it! ?Frank, I mean ?with our boots and
stockings off altogether, shall we ? ?
? Yes. Righto ! ?
? Then a third time, a bit higher up still,
with our boots on properly. By Jove, I didn t
think we?d have such a great time as this, did
you ? ?
? No. They?ll be fair jiggered when they come
after us.?


? Yes?and they?ll be on horseback, too, most
likely?and all these fences . .
? Golly ! I would love to hear what they?ll have
to say.?
? I say, Jim, I?m glad we came, aren?t you ?
This is topping sport.?
? Rather ! Better even than digging rabbit holes
yesterday under the ranges, eh ? Fancy, Frank,
there may be about a dozen of ?em after us soon.
What a sell for them all when they get to this
field ! I reckon we are right proper bushrangers,
don?t you ? ?
? Jove, yes ! ?
By the time Frank and Jim Hardy had put into
operation their scheduled plan the sun was peeping
over the distant eastern hillside.
The young sundowners kept to the bush again
now ?still a considerable distance, as they thought,
from the roadside. For a full three miles they
trudged steadily forward without a halt.
Suddenly?ere they were aware of the fact ?the
truants almost stumbled into several ploughmen
busily engaged coupling horse to their implements.


CHAPTER VI
Escape from a Eight Corner
? T SAY, Bill, come ?ere a mo. What the blazes !
X ? ? . Ha-ha-ha ! Caesar?s ghost ! Ho-ho-ho-
ho ! ? The teamster could scarce contain him-
self for merriment.
? Well ... ah ... be .. . blowed ! ? returned
his mate, joining heartily in the laugh. ? Looks
like a pair o? sundowners, they do. Best I ever
seed ?so help me bob ! Gaw blimy ! ?strike me
brass buttons. What you think on it, Garge ! ?
? Purty game ?uns, I reckon, whoever they be.
I wunner where theys corned fro ? Oi?ve seed
summat in my toime, I ?ave ?but nothin? as ?ud
top this ?ere. I say ??Arry ! Bill! ? ?calling to
some more of his mates nearby.
? ?Elio ! ?Elio!?
? Come over ?ere a tick ! ?
? Righto, mate ?cornin?.?
The bush was now ringing with the laughter of the
four jovial ploughmen.
Frank and Jim Hardy all this time were standing
as though petrified. Each looked at the other,
wondering whether or not to make a bolt for it.
They hadn?t reckoned on this. What made things
worse, as they now discovered, was that they were


near the high road again. These men would
give the blinkin? show away to everyone who
passed.
? I say ?sonny ?what?s yer name ? ? one of the
men shouted kindly?with, however, a broad grin
on his face.
Bewildered and scared, the truants moved slowly
toward the group of men.
? What?s yer name ? ? the teamster repeated.
? F-F-Frank Hardy.?
? An? who?s t?other ?un ? ?
? My brother, Jim.?
? Where be yer agoin? ter ? ?
? Boondah ? (daggers from Tony for imparting
such reliable information).
? Goin? to where ? ?
Tony now r vouchsafed the reply ere Wilfred could
speak. ? We?ve changed our mind. We?re going
to ?Saltgate.?
? Saltgate, sonny ! Bless me ?eart, then, ye?re
going in the wrong direction.?
? What place did the young ?un say ? ? inquired
another of the men.
? He says they?re goin? to Saltgate.?
? Ha-ha-ha ! That?s a good ?un. I only knows
one Saltgate, an? that?s on the border o? South
Aus.? Then, addressing Jim Hardy: ?When do
yer ?opes to get thar, sonny ? ?
? Never, if we stop too long talkin? to blinkin?
strangers,? bravely returned the young sundowner,
screwing up his courage. ? Come on, Frank ! ?
? Good for you young ?un ! Ha, ha, ha ! ? And


once more the men succumbed momentarily to a fit
of merriment.
? Come on, Frank ! ? repeated Tony, ? we must
be getting a move on.?
? But ?just a mo, sonny ! ?what did yer say yer
name was ? ?
? Hardy,? shouted the boys in unison, as, taking
to their heels, they fled down the road.
For the space of several minutes, as they sped
onward, the boys continued to hear the mocking
raillery, as it appeared to them, of their late tor-
mentors. But on and on they sped?very thankful
in having successfully made their escape. They
were not being followed ?at least, so far as they
were able to determine.
? Golly, that was a near squeak ! ? breathlessly
panted Jim, labouring under his heavy swag.
? But what did you go and tell them we were going
to Boondah for, Frank ? Silly ass ! Why, if I
hadn?t stepped in . . .?
? You! Well, I never. What / said was better
than telling them we were going to Saltgate, any-
how. Whatever made you think of Saltgate, you
fool! That put our pot on at once.?
As Tony realized the humour of the situation he
was forced, despite himself, to laugh heartily.
? Well, mate ? ?quite serious again?? let?s shake
hands on it. Strikes me we?ve both bungled things
a bit this time. Come ?put it there ! ?
With good feeling restored the sundowners both
laughed long and happily and, like real old-timers,
shook hands for quits.


? I think we?d better stick to the road for a bit,?
said Jim, as they proceeded onward again.
? Mustn?t let those chaps think we?re trying to
give ?em the slip, you know.?
For another mile, therefore, they stuck to the
high road. Then, deeming it safe to make for the
bush again, they scuttled off the road and were
speedily enveloped in the forest.
It was now broad daylight.
? I can?t make out why we didn?t spot those
chaps sooner,? quoth Wilfred. ?We seemed to
stumble right on top o? them. I hope they won?t
squeak.?
? Anyhow, they have no earthly as to who
we are. But we must be more careful in the
future.?
Fortunately for the boys? peace of mind, neither
of them had caught a low ? aside ? from one of the
ploughmen to his mates.
? I?ll go nap,? the man had whispered, ? that
that big nipper be one o? them there Wainwrights
fro? ? Stronghurst.? So ?elp me bob, I will! I?ve
seed ?im on a little black pony oot at ole man
Staffords? station more an? onst, an? I?ve ?eered ?is
name called by t?others.?
Happily, however, the young sundowners were
quite ignorant of such suspicions. Their one cause
for satisfaction was that the teamsters had ? no
earthly ? as to their identity.
The lads were now making through the bush as
fast as their weary limbs ?and their swags ?would
permit them. Their aim was to put as great a


ESCAPE FROM A TIGHT CORNER 53
distance as possible between themselves and the
ploughmen.
After a good half-hour?s fast walk, however, they
were compelled to proceed more leisurely for a mile
or two. Then finally they sat down on the trunk
of a fallen tree and rested themselves.
In a carefully selected nook Tony presently
proceeded to light a fire, while Wilfred emptied the
tucker bag of its contents.
? Golly, I?m peckish, aren?t you ? ?
? Yes ?and jolly tired, too. I guess, after lunch,
we?ll have a bit of a nap. What say you ? ?
? Jolly good idea.?
? What?s the time, Frank ? ?
? Just on eleven.?
? Sun?s grown a bit hot, but it?s spiffing under the
shade of this old gum. More tea, please ! ?
A quarter of an hour later the boys were both
fast asleep. They would have slept long and
soundly had not the sun awakened them. The
shade, in which they had lain down to sleep, had
shifted round the tree.
Wilfred awoke with a start, rubbing his heated
forehead. ? Tony,? he shouted, nudging his
brother sharply, ? Get up ! It?s gone two o?clock.?
? What! Two o?clock ? ?
? Yes, hurry up. We must be moving on ! ?
Rolling up and shouldering their swags, they were
soon on the wallaby again.
? I say, Frank,? reflected Jim as they moved off,
? I guess the cat?s out of the bag at home by now.?
? Yes, long ago.?


44 Poor Mums ! What a shock after breakfast
on finding our note of farewell! ? At the thought
Tony?s eyes momentarily filled with tears.
? Yes ?the cat?s out of the bag long before this,
I guess.?
? And the birds still in the bush ! I wonder what
they?d do first on discovering we had gone ? ?
? First, I guess, poor old Dad would shout from
his bedroom?that is, before they knew anything at
all ?he?d shout out, 4 Now, boys ! Time to get up.? ?
44 Ha, ha ! Then he?d miss the usual 4 All right,
father.? ?
44 Golly, yes ! Then he?d wait awhile, wouldn?t
he ? ?and shout again. 4 Boys ! Time to get up ! ?
Then he?d mumble something or other to Mummy.
Presently he?d shout once more ?this time a bit
louder. Then, getting no reply, he?d get up himself
and bang hard on our door, and walk inside . . .?
44 Gee whiz ! . . . and find the birds flown. Poor
Dad! P?raps he?d think we?d gone to the stables to
feed and water the horses.?
44 Yes, perhaps so ?but he?d guess the truth soon
after, anyway, when we didn?t turn up for breakfast.
Then he?d call Henry, and they?d all hunt high and
low for us.?
44 It would be somewhere about half-past eight
before our note would be discovered.?
44 Jove ! What then ? ?
44 I guess Dad would get the police up from
Melbourne. But that would take several hours.
It would be eleven o?clock, easily, before the police
could arrive.?


? Well, it?s after two now, so I suppose John
Peel has blown his horn long since. Just fancy,
Tony, at this very moment at home, the hue and
cry ?and all the fuss about you and me ! ?
? I guess we?ll get it hot if they ever catch us,
don?t you ? ?
? Yes. But they haven?t got us yet. I doubt
if they?ve even found our tracks. It will take them
a long time to pick up the scent. They haven?t
the ghost of an idea which direction we took.?
? I think we?d better push on a bit quicker,
Frank, we?ve wasted a lot of time to-day.?
And so the young sundowners, refreshed by their
midday meal and sleep, swung merrily on their way
through the bush again. Some of the old joy, too,
entered once more into their travels. Imp-like,
they made the most of every fence they encountered
in order to hoodwink their pursuers. If it happened
to be a railed fence they nimbled climbed on to
the top rail and walked a considerable distance
thereon.
The afternoon quickly wore on, and to the lads
it seemed no time ere night itself descended upon
them. After selecting carefully a camping place, a
fire was lighted, supper prepared and eagerly par-
taken of, and then, rolling themselves in the blankets
from Wilfred?s swag, the truants were soon fast
asleep.
Only once during the night were they awakened.
Then it was with a sharp cry from Wilfred.
? Jove ! Something burning. Tony ! Tony ! ?
? Go ... go ... to sleep ! ?


? Get up, Tony. Sharp?s the word ! The bloomin?
blanket?s on fire ! ?
Both lads then struggled quickly to their feet.
With their boots they stamped on the mouldering
portion of the blanket. The trouble had arisen
through pitching their couch, for warmth, too near
the fire?s edge. But soon all was quiet again, and
the two young truants fast asleep.
When they awoke in the morning, the sun had
risen well over the horizon. Hastily relighting the
fire they filled the billy from a spring near to which
they had made camp, and put it on to boil. There-
after they enjoyed but a scanty breakfast. Their
provisions were now running short. Very soon they
were on the wallaby again.
At noon another scanty meal, and a further push
on along the track.
? We?ll have to look out for a farmhouse, Jim, to
replenish our tucker bag.?
? Yes, I s?pose so. You?ll have to spin some sort
of a yarn to them, Frank. For goodness? sake don?t
mention Boondah again ! ?
? No ?nor Saltgate.?
? Ha-ha-ha ! ? they chuckled ?their former ex-
perience still fresh in their minds.
? I say, Frank, it?s lucky we?re not short of cash,
anyway. We?ve got tons of money.?
? There's a farm, Jim ! ? suddenly exclaimed the
elder tramp, pointing eagerly to a clearing through
the trees.
? Goodo ! I?ll wait here for you, Frank. Good
luck, old man ! ?


CHAPTER VII
The Awakening at ? Stronghurst ?
JOHN WAINWRIGHT laid his paper aside, and
invited his wife to a chair placed nearer to him
and the fireside.
It was the evening on which Wilfred and Tony
had decided to bolt from home, and only shortly
after the boys had retired to bed.
Seated comfortably together by the fire, husband
and wife talked long together on the subject of the
two boys? future.
? ? Jane,? Mr. Wainwright commenced, ? I think
we shall have to send Wilfred and Tony on to some
college in Melbourne next term. I can see now
they?ll do no good where they are. Cyril will
be leaving the Grammar School at the end of
this term, and I?ll get him into an office in the
city.?
? And what about Mary, John, dear ? ?
Marion ! I think it?s high time she finished her
schooling and helped you a little at home.?
John, couldn?t Wilfred and Tony enter their
college as day-boys ? They could easily ride over
to the siding each morning, stall their horses, and
then proceed by train to Melbourne.? Mrs. Wain-
wright trusted her boys implicitly. She was
57 E


averse, moreover, to any lengthy parting from them
just yet.
? No ?good heavens, woman ?no ! Haven?t we
just had lesson enough in regard to the boys riding
to and fro from school. They cannot be trusted.
They shall go as boarders ?or not at all. It will
do them good to get away from home a little and
be made to conform to the discipline of a public
school.?
? Yes, John, all right ! I?m quite agreeable. But
it will be hard to part with them for a whole long
term at a time. They are only children, John,
dear.?
? Jane, you are altogether too soft with the boys.
Children, indeed ! When I was their age I to
earn my own living. Boys nowadays are growing
up namby-pamby, good-for-nothings. Wilfred and
Tony need some good strict discipline and some real
hard knocking about amongst older boys.?
? Very well, John, dear. Perhaps you are right.
I only want to do what is best for them, and I quite
agree they?ll do no good any longer under Mr.
Piggott.?
? Well, we?ll decide then, shall we, on sending
them to Melbourne next term ? ?
The mother of the lads nodded her assent, and so
the matter was finally settled.
The following morning Mrs. Wainwright rose
early, as usual, to superintend the preparing of her
boys? breakfasts. Quietly she tiptoed past their
bedroom door. She wished ?in view of the severe
handling they had received the previous day to


THE AWAKENING AT ? STRONGHURST ? 59
avoid disturbing their slumbers any sooner than was
necessary.
At seven o?clock, however, the customary call for
them to get up was shouted down the passage by
their father.
During the course of the next quarter of an hour
the father?s call to the lads was several times
repeated.
Finally, Mrs. Wainwright, having returned to her
husband?s bedroom, was herself taxed about the
boys with a growing irritability.
? Why can?t those boys get up when they?re
called ? ?
? I?ll go and see, dear. But I?m sure they?re
getting up.?
? Well, then ?why can?t they answer me ? ?
Mrs, Wainwright at once returned down the
passage. Knocking hard on the boys? door, she
called to them aloud. Then, in order to have
everything quite in readiness for them on their
arrival, she went back to the kitchen and there
busied herself for a full twenty minutes.
? Harm ! ? exclaimed Lottie, the cook. ? It?s
nearly twenty to eight. Master Wilfred and Tony
will be late for school.?
? I wonder what can have happened to them,?
replied the boys? mother. ? Serve the porridge out,
Lottie, and I?ll go and call them again.?
This time Mrs. Wainwright, after gently tapping
on the boys? door, turned the handle and stepped
into the bedroom. The bed, she noticed, was in
disarray, but


? Oh, of course ?I suppose they?ve gone up to the
stables. The little darlings often like to see to their
ponies themselves. But they?ll have to hurry, or
they?ll be getting into trouble again with Mr.
Piggott.? .
So musing, the anxious mother went out on to tne
verandah and called aloud to Henry.
? Yes, marm ? ? answered the ostler.
? Send the boys down ! Tell them they?ll have to
be quick.?
? I haven?t seen them anywhere, marm.?
? Well, please look for them, will you ? Tell them
to make haste to breakfast.?
Mrs. Wainwright had begun now to grow a
little more than anxious. Returning indoors, she
proceeded to search for and call the lads by
name.
Presently Henry returned to say that he could
not find the boys anywhere outside.
?My goodness ! ? the mother exclaimed, with
real alarm ; ? where can they have got to ? ?
The thought occurred to her of arousing their
father, but, with a feeling of timidity, she refrained
from acting upon it.
Another half-hour elapsed.
John Wainwright now entered the dining-room
for his breakfast. For several minutes he sat rather
impatiently alone. The usual breakfast hour had
long passed.
? What?s come over everybody this morning ? ?
he stormed. ? Lottie is usually very punctual with
the meals.?


Then, with fear and tragedy on her face, his wife
burst suddenly into the room, exclaiming :
? Oh, John ! My boys ! My boys ! They can?t
be found anywhere. We?ve searched for them high
and low.?
? What! Haven?t those brats gone to school
yet??
? No. Their ponies are still in the loose-box, and
the boys have not been into breakfast.?
? Tell Henry to search for them.?
? Oh, I have told him ! We?ve all been searching
for more than an hour past.?
_ . � * ? i i
? Missus ! ? screamed Lottie, rushing in breath-
lessly at that moment. ? I?ve just found this in
the kitchen. It?s addressed to you ! ? ?handing
over a note.
With eager, trembling fingers Mrs. Wainwright
took the note and opened it out.
First, on the envelope, she read :
? To darling Mother.?
Then, smoothing out the sheet of notepaper
within with an anxious heart, she hastily scanned
the boyish writing thereon.
For a moment Mrs. Wainwright stood as though
dazed ?reading and re-reading the missive she held
in her trembling fingers. Then, without any
warning, she collapsed, and would have fallen to the
floor.
Her husband, however, rushed forward and saved
her. Gathering her into his strong arms, he laid
her gently upon the sofa, and sent Lottie for a glass
of water.


? Have you any idea
at all ? ? asked the police
officer of Wainwright, ? what direction your boys
would be likely to take ? ?
? None whatsoever.
I must confess to being
thoroughly mystified.
But wait! Is it possible
. . . no . . . I should
hardly think so, in this
case.?
? You were about to suggest . . . ? ?
As soon as he could safely leave his wife, Wain-
wright gathered up the boys? letter from the floor
and read as follows :
? Darling Mum,
? Good-bye! We can?t stand it any longer.
Sorry, for your sake. Mummy dear, please forgive
?(. Signed) Wilfred,
Tony.?
There was little breakfast for anyone that
morning.
Bidding Lottie attend to her mistress, John
Wainwright rushed out to the stables and saddled
his mare. Within an hour he?d reached the nearest
police station and given information and instruc-
tions. This done, he summoned Dr. Humphrey to
proceed to ? Stronghurst ? with all possible haste.
Wainwright was a man of action. He left no stone
unturned when occasion required.
By noon Sergeant Campbell and several neigh-
bours had assembled, and the search commenced.
? Just for a moment the thought struck me that,
possibly, the boys may have gone round to the foot


THE AWAKENING AT ? STRONGHURST ? 63
of the ranges. There?s a favourite sand-patch
there which, of late, they have been rather in the
habit of frequenting. But ?on second thoug ts
I?m afraid they?ve gone farther afield on this
occasion.?
? Can you direct me to this place r
? Well, I dare say we can find it.?
Wainwright and Campbell set off for the ranges
without further delay. On the journey thither the
latter was informed of the circumstances under
which the two young delinquents had been
frequenting this particular rendezvous.
The sand-patch was duly located, but betrayed
no signs of any particularly recent disturbance.
The tunnellings therein proved a source of amuse-
ment to Campbell. He saw at a glance, however,
that they were not the work of that particular
momm S' , 1 TT7 ? ? U
? Well,? said the sergeant, as he and Wainwright
returned to u Stronghurst,? there s only one thing
for it, I?m afraid. We?ll have to track em. But
it?ll be a deucedly stiff job finding the lads? starting
point. In the summer time the clay soil round your
home, Mr. Wainwright, tells few tales. It?s as hard
as a brickbat. We?ll have to get hold of Charlie
Bambra, the black tracker.?
The securing of the tracker, however, was to
necessitate an unforeseen delay.
First, the sergeant rode over four or five miles to
the nearest railway siding. There he telephoned
to the police headquarters in Melbourne, and gave
instructions about the tracker.


? Hang on ! ? replied headquarters. ? I?ll see if
Bambra?s available.?
For a full half-hour Sergeant Campbell hung
about the siding for the reply message. When at
length it came through it was to the effect that
could not at the moment be located.
? We U> he?s urgently needed at � Stronghurst ?
Wainwright?s place, you know. Get hold of him
as soon as you can, and send him straight on.?
It was not until six o?clock in the evening that
the tracker finally turned up at �� Stronghurst.?
Cussed luck ; but it can?t be helped,? exclaimed
the sergeant. I?m afraid, Mr. Wainwright, we
can do little at this time of day.?
The tracker had started on his job, but after an
hour or two even he, for the present, was compelled
to admit defeat.
The search party remained at �� Stronghurst ?
that night in order to get a start the following
morning, if possible by daybreak.
Sergeant Campbell was invited indoors by Wain-
w r right to be his guest for the evening.
Mrs. Wainwright by this time was practically her
normal self again. She was bearing up bravely, and
trying to be cheerful and full of optimism. Her
boys? message she had read and re-read a hundred
times, with tears in her eyes.
The police officer, on being introduced to his
hostess, expressed his sincere sympathies.
Thank you, Sergeant Campbell, but I cannot
believe my boys would deliberately absent them-
selves from home for any lengthy period.?


THE AWAKENING AT ? STRONGHURST ? 65
? Well, I don?t know, Mrs. Wainwright. But you
can take it from me that we?ll soon have them back
for you, safe and sound. We?ve one of the best
trackers in the country on the job.?
? It?s very kind of you, sergeant, to say that.
? Can you tell me one thing, Mrs. Wainwright:
have the boys, to your knowledge?er?made any
sort of provision for an extended outing ? . . . I
mean, have you ?er ?missed anything in the house,
or the pantry, say ?the absence of which might
prove suggestive ? ?
? Well, yes,? was the reply. ? I have carefully
searched through and through the house for the
very purpose of finding out all I could. I know
at least that two blankets are missing from a spare
bedroom, and several things from the pantry, such
as bread, some tinned meat and sardines, butter,
tea, sugar, matches, and an old billy-can frequently
used by the boys when camping. Then I have
noticed that both their money boxes are quite
empty.?
? Thank you, Mrs. Wainwright! These facts
should prove of very material assistance to us.
The lads would scarcely think of the need of money,
for instance, if they had contemplated a mere day?s
outing, or if they had intended striking off into the
back country. Two points, then, seem clear:
apparently they contemplated a more or less
lengthy absence from home, in the first place ; and
secondly, intended to keep within gunshot of civiliza-
tion ?that is, following up one of the main arterial
roads, or the railway, along which settlement lay.?


? Two good points, I declare ! ? exclaimed Mr.
Wainwright. ? I hadn?t thought it out on those
lines. My idea had been that the lads, to escape
detection, would get as far off into the bush as
possible.?
? What a mercy it?s not winter time,? breathed
the lads? mother, with a sigh of relief at the thought.
? Oh, you needn?t fear, my dear lady,? the
sergeant assured her. ? The lads would never have
left home in the depths of winter. It?s these fine
warm nights we?ve been having that?s tempted them
out.?
? Well, now, sergeant, what about bed ? ? sug-
gested Wainwright. ?We must be up early in the
morning, and we?ll need all the sleep we can get.?
Next morning breakfast was partaken of by lamp-
light?despite the early sunrising. Long ere the
sun had risen in the east the expeditionaries, pro-
vided with hampers and all the necessary gear,
had resumed their search for the trail of the truants.
Mr. Wainwright, leaving the sergeant and the
tracker busily engaged, himself rode across to the
home of his friends, the Staffords. He had an idea
that perhaps Reggie might, to some extent, have
been confided in by the boys.
Mr. Stafford, on being aroused from his bed, was
more than surprised to see his good friend and
neighbour on his doorstep at so early an hour.
But this was as nothing compared to the shock he
received on learning the nature of his friend?s
errand.
?Well, well! I?m indeed sorry to hear it, Wain-


THE AWAKENING AT ? STRONGHURST ? 67
wright. Come in, will you, and sit down, while
I go and put a few things on. I?ll call Reg, too.
I won?t be more than about ten minutes.?
Stafford was true to his word, and soon reap-
peared with his son.
Reg, however, proved wholly ignorant of any
knowledge of the boys? intentions.
? Thank you, Reg, my boy ! ? exclaimed Wain-
wright, patting the lad on the shoulder. ? I know
you?ll keep this matter to yourself. It would not
do to let it get the rounds of the school, you know.?
?No ; you can trust me, Mr. Wainwright.?
? Ha, ha ! Yes, I guess so,? was the good-
natured reply.
? And now, Wainwright, I?ll go along with you,
if you?ll accompany me to the stables for my cob,?
said Stafford.
Before long the two men were on their way
towards ? Stronghurst.? As they rode along
thither Wainwright detailed to his friend all he
knew of the circumstances attaching to his boys?
conduct.
? H?m, h?m ; extraordinary ! Just so ! ? ejacu-
lated at intervals the English soldier. ? Apparently
your boy, Tony, then, has had a double dose of it
of late ! H?m, h?m ! ?yes, I see ! Damnable 1 Just
so, yes ! Difficult situation ! ?
? Well, then, what do you think about it ? ?
concluded Wainwright.
? Forgive my saying so, Wainwright ?but it?s a
great mistake, you know, all this corporal punish-
ment. Boys are stubborn brutes, but they?re only


replicas of ourselves. It is as natural for a boy to
resent ?er ? coercion , as it is for you or me. They
will not be forced against their wills. Sooner or
later they wall revolt?take my word for it. H?m !
Then this double dose of Tony?s?really, my good
friend, I?m not surprised at their resentment.
Forgive my saying this, Wainwright! No business
of mine, you know. Then, of course, you can
judge better than I the temperament of your own
lads. I think, however, they?re pretty much all
alike.?
? Thank you, Stafford ! ? For the moment this
was all that Wainwright could trust himself to
reply. The colonel?s words had cut deep. But he
bore him no resentment. What he had heard was
a repetition of what his wife had often said to him.
Perhaps a glimmering of the truth w r as forcing itself
at last upon the mind of the boys? father.
? I?m sorry,? apologized Stafford, ? if in any way
I have overstepped the mark . . .?
? No, no?not at all. What you?ve said has set
me thinking, that?s all. It?s Tony I?m most con-
cerned about. Just read this note from Mr. Piggott,
my friend.?
? H?m, what?s this he says ? ? murmured Stafford,
reading from the note, ? Your boy . . . stranger
to the truth . . . headstrong . . . exhibits signs
of youthful degeneracy . . . not to be trusted . . .
recommend stern disciplinary measures . . . will
come to a bad end unless seriously taken in hand.
. . . Oh, what infernal rot, Wainwright ! Piggott?s
a fool.?


?Well, he?s Tony?s headmaster, and ought to
know something of the lad?s character.
? Permit me to say, my friend, he knows less
than nothing. The fool who wrote that letter is no
judge of character. For long I?ve watched Tony
closely. He has the makings of a fine lad, Wain-
wright. It is not discipline he needs so much as
understanding and comradeship. He?s but a boy
yet, but he has a strong personality. With proper
treatment he?ll greatly surprise you one of these
days, my friend. I haven?t been a soldier for
nothing all these years. Bah! Piggott?s a fool! ?
? Well, perhaps you are right, Stafford. I
sincerely hope so. I may in the past have been a
bit too severe with the lads. But it?s always
difficult to know just how to deal with these
situations. Jove, here we are ! I wonder if the
tracker has picked up any clues ? ?


CHAPTER VIII
Hot on the Trail
? TJ ELLO, Campbell! ? shouted Wainwright,
X 1 catching sight of the police officer. ? Any
luck yet ? ?
? No, I?m afraid not. But Bambra seems to be
hot on the scent.?
The sun had not yet peeped over the eastern
horizon ; the native, therefore, was still working
under difficulties. Stealthily, crouching like a
panther, Charlie Bambra was going the rounds of
the rear paddock.
Scarce had ten minutes elapsed since the return
of Wainwright with his friend, however, than
Charlie?s excited cries were heard from the lower
end of the field :
?Me see ?em, boss ! Me see ?em ! Two feller
got ?em boots on ?no feller like native, bare-
foot.?
Without waste of time the tracker was joined by
the rest of the party.
? You go on, Charlie. We?ll follow behind,? said
Campbell.
? Awright, boss ; dis way. All along o? main
road, I think.?


Charlie was right. The tracks, quite undetected
by the rest of the party, led straight on to the main
road. Then, however, they were lost.
? If they?ve stuck to the road I guess we?ll see
little of their tracks,? said Campbell. ?There?s
been considerable traffic hereabouts during the
thirty hours or so since the lads set out.?
? Yes, I guess so,? returned Wainwright. ? All
we can do is to keep a sharp look-out for tracks
deviating into the bush.?
This was precisely what Bambra appeared to be
doing. Running on foot from side to side, his eyes
searched swiftly every yard over which the party
progressed.
? I think it might possibly save time, Wain-
wright,? suggested the colonel, ? if you and I were
to ride on a few miles. There is little hope of over-
taking the lads, of course ; but we could make
inquiries by the way, and might possibly be able
to pick up some useful information.?
? That?s a good idea, Stafford.? Then, to the
police officer : ? We?ll ride on a few miles, sergeant,
and rejoin you later. Should you happen to leave
the road, fix a piece of paper in the fork of a tree
at the point of deviation, and we?ll find you again
all right.?
? Very well, sir.?
Stafford and Wainwright, one near either edge
of the track, set off at an easy canter.
Up to noon no success had attended the vigilance
of the rear party. They had travelled over seven
or eight miles of the track, Bambra on foot the


whole of the distance. They then partook of an
early luncheon.
Setting off again, they had travelled scarce a
mile ere Bambra cried excitedly :
? Charlie see ?em ! Look, boss ! ?all along dis
way ? ?indicating a direction through the bush.
? Good boy, Charlie ! Quick feller find ?em now
?eh ? ? said the sergeant encouragingly.
?Yes, by gar! Quick feller find ?em now ?you
bet! ?
So saying, the tracker mounted his brumby and
set off at a sharp ambling pace through his native
bush. He now appeared quite at home. No leaf
recently disturbed or twig snapped but speedily
caught his eye ; the slightest of recent depressions
in the earth or grass were clearly and instantly
detected by his native ? sixth sense.?
The tracker?s native vanity , too, was now well in
evidence. His antics were amusing to watch.
Bubbling over with a sense of his own importance
and cleverness, oozing in every word and action
with a superabundance of self-esteem, chuckling,
shouting to his followers remarks all highly self-
complimentary, Charlie Bambra, reckoned to be
Australia?s champion black tracker, rode swiftly on
in advance of his followers of the white civilization.
In his own native bush he was entirely master of
the situation.
Despite his jocularity, however, never once did
Bambra swerve from the tracks so entirely invisible
to the eyes of his followers.
? Remarkable, is it not, the instinct of these


fellows ? ? exclaimed Harry Walker, one of the
party, to the police officer. ? Look at Bambra
now ! Seems to be sniffing the air he breathes ?
like a bloodhound, yet quite unconcerned.?
? Smell ?em boy ? ? shouted the sergeant to the
tracker, evoking roars of laughter from his com-
panions.
? Yah, me smell ?em hoy all right. Not white
feller boy, though, dis one.?
? What ! ? hlackielleT boy ? ?
? Yar, dat?s right, boss. Him feller burning dis
time.?
? Blackfeller boy burning ! What the deuce does
he mean ? ? asked Walker of the sergeant.
?By gar! You right feller!? roared Charlie,
overhearing the interrogation. ? Blackfeller boy
burning awright ! No see ?em, boss ? ? ?pointing,
for the sergeant?s benefit, through a clump of trees.
? No, me no see ?em ! Charlie mad feller ! ?
On hearing this highly uncomplimentary remark
the tracker spurred his brumby forward at a gallop,
followed quickly by the rest of the party, who did
likewise.
? There, boss ! Me mad feller now, eh ? ? in-
dignantly exclaimed the tracker when the party
had caught up with him half a mile further on.
?No see ?em now, eh ? Look! Look! Look! ?
pointing in turn to several charred stumps, from
some of which even yet smoke was ascending.
? Ha, ha ! By gum, Charlie, you clever fellow
all right ! ?
?By gar, yes ! Dat?s right feller dis time, eh ?


Blackboy burn ?em eberywhere?smell ?em long
way off, eh ? ?
Charlie Bambra was indeed right; the pungent
odour of this highly resinous species of fern tree,
wdien burnt, often pervaded the bush for miles
around.
On moving off again the party, as they progressed,
saw similar tell-tale evidence off all sides?burnt
blackboys innumerable. It was clear that the boys,
at this point of their journey, had been bent on
amusing themselves.
Presently the progress of the party was barred by
a fence which enclosed a ploughed field.
? Boys no go over ploughed field,? said the
sergeant to the tracker. ? I think we follow up
fence a bit.?
?No good feller,? was the reply. ? Charlie think
boys go over ploughed field all right. Hold ?em
horse, boss ! Me soon see ! ?
Having vaulted over the fence, the tracker, on
entering the field, soon proved himself correct. He
w r as now screaming with delight, and chuckling and
gurgling to himself like a veritable cookaburra.
? By gar, white feller piccaninny tink dey can
fool ?em Charlie Bambra, eh ? He, he, he ! Dis
very funny ting, boss ! Tracks cornin? dis way, and
boys walk ?em t?other. Oh, dis very good feller ! ?
? What the dickens is the matter with you,
Bambra ? ? snapped the sergeant impatiently.
?By gar, come an? look, boss ! So cute feller,
Charlie neber see ?em so funny before. Come on,
boss ! ?


Reluctantly the sergeant dismounted and joined
the tracker.
? See ?em, boss ? Tracks cornin? dis way, and
boys walk ?em other way. Got ?em boots on wrong
way dis time. By gar, no fool Charlie Bambra ! ?
The rest of the party, having hitched their steeds
to the fence, now joined the tracker also?bent on
satisfying their curiosity.
?But how you know, Charlie,? asked Walker,
? that boys no come this way ? ?
? Oh, Charlie him feller know all right. No fool
dis chicken, eh ? ?
? But how you know ? ? insisted the questioner.
?No see ? Toe make deeper mark than heel.
You walk ?em properly and see. Heel sink in sand
more than toe. No see, boss ? ?
Campbell was at last convinced ; not so, how-
ever, the rest of the party. Chuckling aloud and
shaking his hand, Charlie pointed alternately to his
own forehead and to that of Harry Walker?signi-
fying that the latter was mentally deficient.
Then, addressing the sergeant ; ? Cute lil fellers,
eh, boss ? But not cute enough for Charlie Bambra,
eh ? ?
? No,? humoured his master. ? Charlie clever
feller.?
? Boss, me think you all wait ?em here. Charlie
go over field, eh ? ?
? All right, Bambra, go ahead?but look sharp.?
With the speed of a dingo Charlie made across
the ploughed ground. Having reached the farther
side, he followed up the fence a short distance, and


presently came jogging back again?about a hun-
dred yards higher up. Chuckling the whole distance,
his good-humoured capers proved vastly entertain-
ing to Walker and his mates.
The tracker was speedily joined again by the
sergeant and his followers.
Panting and splitting his sides with mirth,
Charlie exclaimed : ?By gar, they cute ?uns
awright ! Boys have some little feller joke on, I
guess. Tracks come back dis time with no feller
boot on at all ?just like alle sem native. Come and
look, boss ! ?
The party crowded around and laughed heartily.
Then Bambra, a little higher up the fence still,
went speeding a third time over the field.
The rest of the party, having mounted their
steeds once more, followed along the fence now for
a considerable distance. Presently they discovered
that the end of the ploughed field formed an apex
just on ahead of them. Here the main road inter-
sected a railway crossing and wound northward
again.
On their arrival at the crossing the party was
suddenly hailed by the advance riders, Wainwright
and Stafford.


CHAPTER IX
Restoration
? A NY further luck ? ? shouted Wainwright to
the sergeant of police.
? Yes, sir ! We?re on their tracks sure enough.?
? Ah, that?s good ! Where?s Bambra ? ?
? He?s heartily enjoying himself over yonder ?
hot on the scent, you know. The boys appear, at
this point, to have been having a bit of a lark,?
said Campbell, who then detailed to the advance
riders, much to their amusement, the doings of the
truants.
? Well,? commented Stafford, ? they do not
appear to have been downhearted. That?s one
blessing.?
? Have you seen any traces or heard any news
of the lads, sir ? ? asked Campbell of the last
speaker.
? Well?no?and yes. We?ve seen nothing, but
we?ve heard a right good tale about the lads,? said
Stafford, who then in his turn caused much laughter
by a graphic description of the lads? cul-de-sac and
its consequences.
? Poor little beggars ! I suppose there can be no
mistake, and that these lads were your two sons,
Mr. Wainwright ? ?


? Yes, they were my lads all right.?
? Nothing more certain,? added Stafford. ? One
of those men, Gibbs, is quite well known to me. He
told me he was dead sure he had recognized the
elder of the boys.?
? Well, well ! ? exclaimed Campbell, ? got some
stuff in ?em, those boys, Mr. Wainwright ! ?
? Chips of the old block,? laughed Stafford.
? You?ve been a bit of a rover yourself in your
time, you know, Wainwright.?
? Yes, I admit I have.?
? And now,? said Campbell, looking at his watch,
? I guess we?d better push on a bit. I?m beginning
to think we won?t catch up with the lads before
nightfall. But it?s just possible we may ?with some
luck.?
When the party had journeyed a further mile on
their way they sighted the teamsters, still at work
in the field. Some cheery greetings were exchanged,
but the riders pushed on now with the object of
making the most of what daylight still remained to
them.
Bambra had no difficulty in following the trail
when once it was picked up again at the point of
the lads? deviation from the road. The party
quickly arrived at a camping place of the lads.
Here again was evidence of a fire, the embers of
which were scarcely stone cold.
Pressing onward, the expeditionaries encountered
considerable difficulties from the fences which con-
tinually barred their progress. The wires of some
of these had to be severed, and the rails of others


temporarily displaced. Despite all their efforts,
however, darkness eventually set in ere the main
object of the party had been achieved. Then camp
was struck and, after a hearty meal, the members of
the party settled themselves down for the night.
Before sunrise next morning they were off again.
The trail was quickly picked up and good progress
resumed.
The country through which the riders now
journeyed was singularly beautiful. Stafford, who
had been over this ground before, drew his friend s
attention to the wonderful panorama which
stretched out before them.
? Magnificent, is it not ? ? he exclaimed ad-
miringly. ? Trees, valleys, mountains ?backed by
the mist-enshrouded alps and surmounted by the
great sapphire dome of Heaven. Have you ever
seen anything like it, my friend ? I confess it held
me enthralled when first I beheld it. From the
very grass at our feet ?a gradual crescendo of
loveliness ?swelling upward, it seems, to the pearly
gates of Heaven. Fine, is it not ? ?
Stafford?s enthusiasm for the panorama was fully
justified. As the party progressed mountains
towered up on all sides of them. Deep gorges and
valleys, heavily timbered, skirted the bases of the
mountain sides. At their feet the green sward,
the flowers and the giant bracken-fern, with its
glossy fronds, formed a rich bower which glistened
in the sunlight, shafting down from between the
giant gums.
There was life, too, in these primeval forests.


Multi-coloured parrots and parakeets chattered
their endless babel in the eucalypti; great grey
kangaroos hopped noiselessly through the glades.
Now and again a laughing jackass thrilled the
travellers with its gurgling peal of semi-human
laughter. Sometimes a long or bob-tailed iguana,
or a snake, was disturbed while basking lazily in
the warm morning sunshine.
It was a heavenly day ; there was not a cloud
in the sky. From the top of steep mountain rises,
from time to time, the riders caught glimpses
through the trees of vast undulating stretches of
lowlands, ploughed fields, winding brown roads,
cottages and farm-houses, glistening streams and
rivulets. But the expeditionaries had little time
to waste on admiration of the country through
which they were travelling. Pushing forward, they
discovered from time to time several more evidences
of camp fires. Occasionally they passed small
groups of the nomadic human inhabitants of these
bush-lands?aborigines. These were clad in cast-
off garments of the whites, and were miserable-
looking specimens of humanity?a fact for which
the white civilization itself was in no small measure
responsible. Campbell questioned some of these
blacks about the two white boys, but could elicit
from them no very helpful information
At the rate the party was now travelling the
police sergeant calculated upon overtaking the
truants somewhere about noon, if not earlier. As
events proved, he was not far out of his calculations.
It was about one o?clock when, after negotiating


the sharp bend of a narrow mountain pass, Charlie
Bambra suddenly sighted his quarry. The truants,
in the act of preparing their midday meal, were
taken completely by surprise.
?Hello, there, Wilfred?Tony I ? the father of
the lads shouted good-naturedly.
The young sundowners, too dumbfounded to
reply, jumped hastily to their feet. In fear and
trembling they regarded in silence the formidable
party as it advanced towards them.
? So here you are, you little varmints ! ? laugh-
ingly exclaimed their father, drawing nearer. ? I
guess you?d better make a bigger fire than that.
We are all famished. That is true, is it not,
Stafford ? ?
? Yes, quite true. I hope you sundowners have
plenty of grub with you ; our stock has got a bit
low. Now then, all hands to work.?
To say that the lads were surprised would not
at all adequately describe their feelings. They were
nonplussed and bewildered. They had expected, if
overtaken in their wanderings, a far different recep-
tion from this ; the apparent easy good-naturedness
of their father, particularly, was something which
they found it difficult to fathom. For a few
moments, therefore, they continued to regard their
captors in silence and dismay, their faces betraying
more than a trace of fear. When their father, after
having dismounted, stepped eagerly towards them,
however, Wilfred and Tony both made a wild dash
in his direction and joyfully threw their arms round
his neck.


? Dad ! Dad ! ? they cried, ere succumbing tear-
fully to the warm overtures of their fond if?at
times?strict parent.
? Oh, Dad, I?m sorry ! ? tearfully exclaimed each
of them in turn.
? That?s all right, sonnies. None the worse for
your outing, eh ? That?s right ! No one?s more
glad to find you safe and well than is your old
Dad.? 7
For a few moments the trio were all too overcome
to say more. Presently, however, the father led his
boys over to the group of men busily engaged at
the fire, making lavish preparations for a heartv
meal. 7
Wilfred and Tony shook hands with all the men
in turn, and in so doing found them so jovial and
hearty that the last traces of fear and trepidation
on their part quickly vanished.
? Well, lads, it?s good to see you again,? said
Colonel Stafford kindly. ? Were you not frightened
travelling all alone in the bush ? ?
. ? No, Colonel Stafford,? replied Wilfred. ? Some-
times we were a little anxious and wished we were
home again.?
But wouldn?t you rather be at Saltgate,
Tony ? ?
Both boys regarded the speaker for a moment
in wonderment. Then, as the flicker of a smile
crossed the colonel?s face, they gave way to peals
of boyish laughter and merriment.
? How did you get to know about Saltgate,
Mr. Stafford ? ? asked Tony.


? Oh, I met a friend named Gibbs on the road.
I think Von boys both made his acquaintance, too,?
replied Stafford, with a twinkle. ? Did you like
Mr. Gibbs, Tony ? ? , n
? No?not very much, I?m afraid. He was mil
of fun, but it was all at our expense.?
<< j see ! Well, well! ? said the colonel,
striving to be serious. ? Well, there?s no place like
home, Tony, my lad, is there ? ? he added.
? No, Colonel Stafford ; we?ll be glad to be home
again.? _
The fire in the meantime had been piled with
fresh branches of dead wood, and two billy-cans
were already swinging cheerfully in the midst of the
big blaze. The meal which followed might have
been an ordinary, jolly pre-arranged picnic luncheon.
After luncheon Wilfred and Tony were hoisted
on to the saddles, behind Mr. Wainwright and
Colonel Stafford, to ride for the short remaining
distance into Boondah. Campbell, the tracker and
two other men then turned their horses? heads for
home.
On arrival at Boondah, Wainwright and his
friend made straight for the railway station
There, an hour later, the boys, with their father,
entrained for Melbourne, Walker taking charge of
Wainwright?s mare to convey her home by road,
accompanied by Colonel Stafford.
? Well, Stafford,? feelingly exclaimed Wain-
wright ere the train moved out from the station,
? I don?t know how I can thank you for all the
assistance and kindly advice you have given me !


You?ve proved a real friend in need, I can assure
you.?
? H?m, not at all, not at all, Wainwright! I?m
only too glad all has ended so happily, and that
the lads are none the worse for their little outing.
Is there any message I can convey to your wife ?
We shall be back long before you, you know?unless,
of course, on your arrival in Melbourne, you get a
taxi to convey you out to � Stronghurst.? ?
? No, I do not think I shall do that. If you
wouldn?t mind having the trap sent in for us first
thing in the morning, I think we?ll spend to-night
in the city. Tell my wife what news there is, and
that all?s well. Ah, there goes the whistle ! Good-
bye, my friend, for the present ! ?
As the train moved off Wilfred and Tony ?both
with very grubby handkerchiefs ?waved fondly
their farewells to Colonel Stafford from the carriage
window. This they continued doing till the colonel
was lost to sight round the bend of a sharp curve
of the metals. The boys then settled themselves
down to enjoy from the coach window the scenes
through which they passed. Many tunnels cut
sheer through the mountain sides were encoun-
tered on their journey to the city. The track
wound sharply round the bases of other mountains,
and crossed over ravines and deep gorges by means
of innumerable bridges which spanned them.
On the following morning, at about ten o?clock,
Wainwright and his boys duly turned up at
? Stronghurst.? On the verandah of their home
stood the fond mother of the lads, eagerly awaiting


their arrival home. Many tears of joy were shed
by the reunited trio. Thus Wilfred and Tony, in
the eager embraces of their mother, found warm
and welcome refuge from the last shred of doubt
or fear which may still have assailed them as a
result of their own foolhardiness. That same day,
after a thoroughly enjoyable hot dinner, the lads
found their way once more over to the stable and
ascended the loft?always a favourite meeting
place of theirs.
? I say, Willie,? said Tony, as soon as they had
settled themselves comfortably on the ripe hay,
? isn?t Father a sport ? He?s never said one angry
word to us all the time.?
? Jove, yes ! I can?t make it out quite, can you,
Tonv ? Many boys would have got a sound good
tanning for doing what we?ve done.?
? Well, Willie, it?s the last time for me. No
matter what happens in the future, I?ll never
again play truant.?
? Nor I, either.?
? It?s not because I didn?t enjoy it, and all that,
you know. It was fine sport out in the bush,
wasn?t it ? ?
? Golly, yes ! ?
? But ?I don?t know! Father! I can?t quite get
over it, somehow ?his being so jolly decent.?
? Not what we expected, eh, Tony ? ?
? No, by Jove, no ! It?s taught me a good
lesson, hasn?t it you, Willie ? ?
? Yes, rather ! And I reckon we?ve deserved all
the tannings we?ve had in the past. Fancy, Tony?


all this that?s happened ?it?s nearly all been due
to that little prank of yours in the Sunday School!
Seems odd, doesn?t it ?just a little drawing on a
card causing such a hullabaloo ? ?
? Yes. But the real cause was because I per ?
prevaricated with Mr. Piggott, instead of owning up
straight away. I would have owned straight out,
you know, only for that girl, Ethel. Mummy taught
me a little piece of poetry that week, Willie. It
runs something like this :
? ? Be the matter what it may,
Always speak the truth ;
Never from this rule depart,
Grave it deeply in your heart,
When at work or when at play?
Always speak the truth.? ?
? Topping ! ? commented Willie.
? Yes. There?s a bit more of it, too ?and I don?t
think I?ve got that much quite right somehow. But
it?s not bad, is it ? Well, Frank Hardy, old top,?
concluded Tony laughingly, ? all?s well that ends
well, eh ? We?re home safe and sound again, and
none the worse for ?the great venture. But as for
Dad ?golly, I can?t even yet get over it somehow !
He?s a sport ?a real, clinking good sport! ?


CHAPTER X
Marking Time
AFTER their escapade in the bush, Wilfred
and Tony were not sent back again to Mr.
Piggott?s school. Colonel Stafford had kindly
undertaken to coach them for a month or two in
the rudimentary elements of Latin and French and
other classical studies as a preparation for their
entry, after Easter, into college. Consequently,
by mutual arrangement between Mr. Wainwright
and the State school authorities, the boys, for the
time being, were allowed to remain at home.
A strong mutual friendship had now long existed
between the Staffords and the Wainwrights. This
had taken root on the first visit the Staffords had
paid to their neighbours shortly after Wainwright
had taken up his abode at ? Stronghurst.? It
was then that Mrs. Wainwright had made the
discovery that the colonel?s wife, like herself, was
the daughter of an English cleric. This was a happy
coincidence which led to the comparing of many
notes together. Hosts of mutual interests and
experiences were interchanged, which resulted at
once in the cementing of a close bond of friendship
between these two English women.
The colonel and Wainwright were no whit less


affably inclined towards one another than were
their wives. As a soldier, Stafford had travelled
considerably in India and the East. Wainwright,
too, in connection with the mercantile, had seen,
in his younger days, a large slice of the world.
Both men, therefore, possessed a veritable store-
house of anecdote for mutual conversational inter-
change, and seldom lost an opportunity of having
a crack with each other?a fact which led to many
visits and return visits being made between the two
families.
The colonel?s elder son, Keith, only a few months
younger than Cyril Wainwright, had already left
college, and was now assisting his father on the
estate.
There were, as has already been stated, two other
Stafford children ?Reggie, similar in age to Tony,
and Phyllis, the baby daughter, a year Tony?s
junior. During their vacations from school the
children of these two families were constantly
together, either at ? Stronghurst ? or at ? Con-
venor ? ?the home of the Staffords. On such
occasions they generally made things very lively
for the particular household where they happened
to congregate. In the first place, both Wilfred and
Reg were in the happy possession of pea-rifles.
There was nought so dear to the boys? hearts as
parrot shooting or occasional wallaby hunts ; or,
on a good moonlit night, when the sighting was
good, an opossum hunt.
Occasionally, on their excursions into the bush,
Wilfred, Reg and Tony were joined by Fred Norman,


Dick Radford and Conrad Morrison ?or ? Shirty,?
as the latter was nicknamed, owing, perhaps, to his
possession of a sometimes fiery temper. The Rad-
fords were descended from one of the oldest families
of the colony. Dick?s grandfather, as a lad, had
voyaged to Australia from England in an old-time
sailing brig. The journey had taken eight months
to complete.
On one particularly warm and sultry January
afternoon these six lads, lying on their stomachs,
were idly kicking their heels in the air under the
shade of a spacious gum near ? Convenor ? home-
stead. It was a Saturday afternoon, and none of
the boys had any lessons to bother them. Dick
Radford was spinning yarns by the dozen ?told
him by his grandfather?of the early days. Dick
was passing good in the art of story-telling, and his
companions dearly loved to get him going.
? It?s true,? Dick was saying.
? Garn ! ? sniggered Conrad.
? I?ll bet you anything ! ?
? Shut up, Shirty, and let Dick get on with the
yarn,? murmured Wilfred impatiently.
? Well,? resumed Dick, ? Grandfather?s ship,
several times, was nearly lost at sea with all hands.
Sometimes they were becalmed in mid-tropics for
weeks on end. Then typhoid would break out,
and the passengers who died were slipped overboard
by the dozen.?
? But fancy, Connie,? interrupted Reg, ? fancy
taking eight months to come out from England.
Dad did it in about five weeks.?


For reply Conrad Morrison only grunted. He
detested being called ? Connie,? and preferred a
thousand times the less effeminate ?if also less
complimentary ?nickname of ? Shirty.?
? It?s not only the time these journeys take,?
exclaimed Fred Norman ?himself an English lad?
? but crikey! just imagine what cockleshells those
old tubs of sailing vessels were in those days. I
wonder if the people ever got seasick in the Biscay
or the Bight ? Jove ! we did, coming over ?even
on a modern liner.?
? Here, shut up, you fellers, and let old Dick get
on with his yarn,? protested Tony.
? When Grandfather came out,? resumed Dick
Radford, ? shiploads of convicts were being sent
from England to Port Jackson in New South Wales.
These poor beggars were herded like cattle down
the hatches of the old wooden hulks. Hundreds of
them died on the way out from England. Talk
about the Black Hole of Calcutta ! Granddad used
to say that was nothing to the condition down the
holds of some of the convict ships?especially when
they got becalmed round about the equator. Then
tons of these convict chaps shipped to New South
had never been guilty of any real crime. Grand-
dad said they were sent out for poaching a few
rabbits, or even stealing cabbages. Many of them
were fine men, too, he said. But those who were
lucky to reach New South were at first treated
like slaves, or ?or ?cattle. Yes, that?s dinkum.
Some of them were actually branded, like cattle,
with hot irons, after they arrived.?


? Garn ! ? exclaimed Fred Norman. ? Not too
much jam, please ! ?
? It?s dinkum true. You can believe me or not,
as you like.?
? Well, go on ! ? urged Reg. ? What hap-
pened ? ?
? Why ?not only were some of them branded?
but nearly all these poor beggars were treated as
beasts of burden. You see, Army officers and other
Government officials were sent out from home with
these poor devils, and the convicts were made to
build houses and make roads of the native forest
timber.?
? Yes, that?s true enough,? said Conrad. ? I?ve
seen some of the convict roads. Many of them still
exist. You can always distinguish them. They
were paved with round, heavy blocks of timber,
some of them more than two feet in diameter.?
? Stow it, Connie ! Do you think you?re the only
one who?s seen them ? ? said Fred.
? Well,? resumed the patient Dick, ? the poor
beggars of convicts had to cut or saw, by hand, all
the timber required for house and road construction.
Then they were forced to haul the timber them-
selves, like beasts of burden. For this purpose
many of them worked in chain-gangs, and the
cat-o?-nine-tails was always ready for shirkers.
Many of these poor beggars finally managed to
make their escape from penal servitude. They
then became outlaws, or bushrangers?like Kelly
and Starlight.? (Here smiles were exchanged
between Wilfred and Tony.) ? These bushrangers


terrified the whole country for years. Tons of
them were captured. Then they were shot or
hanged.?
Dick Radford could be very interesting and
graphic in the narrating of these stories, told him
by his old grandfather. The old man had been
dead now for about five years. He had died at
the age of ninety. The boys sometimes suspected
that old Radford himself had been one of the
original convicts ; but, as Dick was a great favourite
of theirs, none of them ever dreamed of so much
as hinting of their suspicions in the presence of
Dick himself. During particularly warm after-
noons the shade of this old gum tree at ? Convenor ?
was a favoured resort of the lads at this time.
The following Saturday afternoon found them all
once more assembled at the same spot. Phyllis
Stafford, as was frequently the case, was of the
select little circle on this occasion. With little
persuasion Dick Radford once more was urged to
continue his tales of old times.
? Tell us about the diggers,? said Tony.
?Ah ! Granddad used to say those were hectic
days for Victoria. Thousands of people poured
into Ballarat and Bendigo from all parts of the
world ?China, America, Europe, everywhere. Cities
of canvas and wooden huts sprang up out of the
wild bush like magic.?
? Why don?t you say skyscrapers and all the
rest of it ? ? interrupted Conrad.
? Well, all right, if you like, Shirty ! ? was the
sarcastic reply.


? But, joking apart,? said Reg. ? I wish I had
lived in those days.?
? Golly, yes ! ? agreed Fred.
? My, there was some money flying about,?
resumed Dick. ? Granddad said it was common
for miners, just out of pure devilment, to light their
pipes with ten-pound notes. Some of them had
so much money that they didn?t know what to do
with it. Others went clean off their chumps with
the excitement of it all. The gold-lust turned their
brains to blood-lust. Some fearful scrimmages
took place. Shooting and pilfering went on every
day. You see, most of these diggers had only
tents to live in. There was nothing much for them
to spend their fortunes on, so some buried their
money and their gold inside their tents. The wise-
heads, of course, banked it. But lots of them
didn?t like parting with their gold. It had turned
their heads. They became misers. Then, of course,
there were so many mail and bank robberies going
on that . . .?
? But I guess they weren?t all as rich as that,?
interrupted Wilfred.
?No fear! Thousands who swarmed to the
diggings soon found themselves in ? Queer Street.?
They?d sold their houses, and spent all their money
in getting to Ballarat or Bendigo. When they got
there they found that all the plum claims had
already been staked out, or that their claims were
worthless. Poor devils ?there were hundreds like
this who got nothing at all, or precious little, and
they were soon reduced to starvation.?


? Money?s the root of all evil,? quoted Conrad.
?No fear ! I don?t believe that,? answered Dick.
? I only wish I had half what some of the other
fellers got. They were nearly millionaires in no
time, many of them. But Granddad told us of
one place?Coolgardie, I think it was, in West
Australia?where the gold rush beat Ballarat and
Bendigo into a cocked hat. The gold discovered
there, even in a very shallow sinking, looked for
all the world like trinkets in a jeweller?s shop
window.?
? Gee whiz ! ? exclaimed Tony.
? Yes, but the suffering amongst the diggers was
far worse in Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie than in
other places, because of the scarcity of water.
Coolgardie is nearly four hundred miles from Perth
?in the interior. Water was so scarce that the
diggers had to pay a pound a gallon for it. The
fortunate diggers, of course, could well afford to
pay any price. But hundreds nearly died of thirst.
All this was years ago. Coolgardie?s about played
out now, but Kalgoorlie?s grown into a big place,
and is well supplied with all the water it needs.
They say the water is now pumped up to Kalgoor-
lie, four hundred miles from the coast, and that
the great inland city possesses not only beauti-
ful parks and gardens, but up-to-date swimming
baths.?
? Didn?t your grandfather ever strike any luck ? ?
asked Wilfred.
? Yes, he was pretty rich at one time, and bought
up our farm. As a young man he had a pretty


good thing on at Bendigo. But he lost a whole lot
of his money, I believe, in speculation.?
? What rotten luck! ? sympathized Wilfred.
? Well, mates, what about a hearty vote of thanks
and three cheers for Raddy ? ?
? Seconded ! ? said Reg.
? And carried unanimously,? thundered all, as,
by way of emphasis, they brought their hands down
heavily on poor Dick?s shoulders.
That night all the boys and Phyllis launched
forth on a ?possum hunt, and had a grand old
time of it in the bush. Phyllis Stafford generally
accompanied the boys on these occasions. She
was a regular harum-scarum ?a real tomboy,
and quite the equal of any of the boys in tree
climbing.
The following Friday evening Fred Norman
again made his way over to ? Convenor ? to join
Reg and the two Wainwrights. It had been a
lovely day, and the weather promised well for the
morrow. Reg was desperately keen on an outing
of some kind for the Saturday and together,
the boys were discussing what form it should
take.
? You chaps ever seen a harvester ? ? finally
asked Reg.
? A harvester ! What?s a harvester ? ? inquired
the new chum ?Fred.
? Never heard of a harvester ? Your education?s
only half complete, young man 1 ? ?in superior tones,
quoth Reg.
? Well, what is it ? ?


9 6 BOYS OF BACK 0? BEYOND
? Why, it?s a huge machine invented not long
ago, and used on large farms instead of a stripper
and winnower for harvesting the wheat crops. It
is usually drawn through the wheatfield by four
large horses, or sometimes by motor tractors.?
?Yes, go on, then?what does it do ? ?
? Do ! does everything?and all at one and
the same time, while being drawn through the corn-
field. Strips the ears of corn from the stalks,
threshes them with a big revolving drum, separates
the wheat from the chaff, blows the chaff into the
air with a revolving fan, collects the pure grain
into large elevators, empties it into bags at the rear
of the machine, fills the bags . . .?
? Garn, you?re gammin? ! ? sarcastically inter-
rupted the new chum. ? I suppose this machine
then grinds the wheat, eh? Then makes bread
and cooks it, and loaves come out the other
end ? ?
Despite themselves, the other boys could not help
but laugh at Fred?s incredulity.
y ou know Sam Vandyke ? ? persisted Fred.
? You know, the Yankee over at Snowball?s place ?
Well, he tried to tell a tall ?un one day. He told
me that in America they have a machine which
takes live pigs in at one end and turns bacon and
boots out at the other ! ?
When the laughter had subsided, in dead earnest,
Reg continued :
No, Fred, this is a real dinkum machine ! It
takes only two men to work it?one to drive the
horses and the other to sew up the bags as fast as


they are filled with pure grain. He is kept going
some, too, I can tell you.?
? No, you?re gammin? ! ?
? It?s true ?honest Injun,? persisted Reg.
? There are some on a big farm fifteen miles from
here ?at Harpers Station. Dad?s going over there
to-morrow with the big drag. Jove ! He might
take us all with him. Can you come, Fred ? We
ought to be able to see at least two or three of them
at work.?
? Righto?if you?re not pulling my leg ! ?
? Well, ask Wilfred and Tony, then ! ?
? No,? intervened Wilfred, ? what Reg says is
quite true.?
? Anyway, come over early to-morrow morning,
Fred,? concluded Reg. ? To-night I?ll ask Dad
if he?ll take us all.?
? Righto ! Thanks, Reg. But, Jove ! look out
for yourself if you?re having me on a string.?
That night, in answer to the request of Reg,
Mr. Stafford readily gave his consent to the four
boys and Phyllis accompanying him to Harpers
Station, and Reg and Phyllis danced for joy at
the prospects thus opened out to them for the
morrow.
On the Saturday morning Wilfred and Tony and
Fred all turned up early at ? Convenor,? and soon
all set merrily forth in the big four-wheeler for a
jolly day?s outing. The overnight promise of good
weather was amply fulfilled. The day was warm
and dry?just perfect for harvesting operations.
They were a merry party as the big drag, drawn by


a flashy pair, progressed steadily along the track.
At times they passed through dense bush country;
at other times through fields from which the sweet-
scented hay had already been cut or tied into
bundles by the reaper and binder. These bundles,
or sheafs, were now piled into stocks awaiting
carting and stacking. Still at other times, the drag
was drawn through what seemed miles of ripe,
waving wheatfields. Here the golden grain was
awaiting the final operations of the stripper and
winnower?or the harvester. The sweet scent of
the drying hay and of the ripening wheat pervaded
the air on that warm January morning. Such a
delight was it to the children that they filled their
lungs and inhaled long draughts of it at a time, out
of pure joy. After two hours? hard travelling, the
drag at length drew up at its destination. The
boys, with Phyllis, at once made off to where they
were told they would find the harvesting machines
in operation.
? There you are, Fred! ? exclaimed Reg, on
catching sight of the first of the harvesters. ? You
see?only two men to each machine. That chap
on the back there is sewing up the bags as fast as
he can.?
Lost in wonder and amazement, Fred was
speechless. Presently, however, he edged his way
over to that portion of the wheatfield which had
not yet been harvested and closely examined the
waving ears of corn. Then he strolled off by
himself to a spot where was lying one of the ejected
bags full of the pure grain. From a tiny hole in


the bag he squeezed out a few of the golden grains
of wheat. Satisfied, apparently, he at length
returned to his young companions.
? Well, I never ! It?s dinkum, Reg, what you
said,? he exclaimed. ? I could never have believed
it possible.?
? Yes, of course,? was the reply. Ihere are
hosts of things you haven?t seen yet. There?s the
four-furrow plough which jumps over stumps und.
stones as it goes along. They call it the ? stump-
jumper.? Then there are the machines for shearing
sheep and milking cows. They don?t do much by
hand in this country if they can avoid it, I can tell
you.? After a pause?? Look ! ? he continued,
pointing to a newly-cleared field. ? I believe that
chap working over there is doing some fallowing.
Let?s go over and see.?
The whole five eagerly trooped over.
? You?re right, Reg ! ? exclaimed Tony. ? He?s
fallowing with a stump-jumper, too. Just watch
it, Fredl Whenever one of the shares touches a
stump or root in the newly-cleared ground it just
jumps over it, and so the horses are not pulled to
a standstill or jerked out of their traces.?
The new chum was indeed learning something
that morning. On returning to his home in the
evening he told his father and mother of all his
wonderful experiences during the day.
The Normans, so far, were farming on only a
small scale. Clearing their lands of its heavy
timber constituted for them the greatest problem
of the moment. Large corn and wheatfields were


items to be anticipated in the distant future. But
they were working with a will and determination
on their selection which boded well for the years
which were to follow.
Fred, at least, never forgot that outing to Harpers
Station. It served as a constant inspiration to
him for many a long day.


CHAPTER XI
Phyllis Stafford
? A MO, amas , amat; amamus , amatus ,
A amant ?
? Oh, dry up, Tony! ? exclaimed Wilfred,
thoroughly bored.
? No, wait a bit.? Turning the pages of his book
to a list of declensions : ? Rex , Rex , Regem ; Regis ,
RegeP
? If you don?t shut up I?ll heave this book at
you ! ?
?to, to, Regem; Regis , con-
tinued Tony stoically. ? ?
Bang . . . thud ! A book whizzed by Tony?s
head.
? Here, stow it, Wilfred ! You know we?ve got
to finish these declensions. Not fair on Colonel
Stafford ?
? Oh, blow Colonel Stafford ! Talking about de-
clensions reminds me of a good story I read the
other day, Tony. Some young bloods entered a
tavern for some old hock. The wit of the company
ordered the waiter to bring a bottle of hie , hcec ,
hoc. The waiter, however, paid no attention to
him. Upon being called again and condemned as
a stupid rascal, he was asked why he had not


brought the hock. ? Really, gentlemen,? said he,
? I thought you had declined it .? ?
? Jove, that?s a good ?un ! Waiter was a bit
cleverer than the wit, eh ? ? laughed Tony.
? Yes, and I?m for declining any more of this
beastly stuff to-day. Come on, let?s off outside.?
Tony and Wilfred had come over to ? Convenor ?
for the day for their usual morning?s grounding in
the rudiments of Latin and French. How they
hated both ! The day was fine and bright, and
tempting enough to allure the most studious from
their books. On this occasion Will and Tony were
staying at ? Convenor ? for the night.
Since Cyril Wainwright had been placed in an
office in the city, and his former companions,
Keith, Harry Norman and Bob Radford, had more
or less grown into manhood, their mantle of devil-
ment had now fallen upon their juniors. Of these
Tony, Willie, Shirty Morrison, Dick Radford, Fred
Norman and Reggie Stafford were the chief. There
was, however, a fifth ?as much a daredevil as any
when occasion demanded. This was Phyllis.
Phyllis Stafford was growing into a very beautiful
child. In age she was just a year Tony?s junior.
In height, however, the two at present were about
equal. Phyllis was tall for her years ?tall, slim
and graceful in her movements. But she was her
mother?s constant worry and dread ; a wild, harum-
scarum ; for ever up to mischief ; afraid of nothing
and nobody. She should, as her mother oft-times
readily admitted, have been a boy. The large and
lustrous eyes of this beautiful child were, in colour,


of bluish-grey. They bespoke at once the fearless-
ness of their owner, combined with an irrepressible-
ness of spirit.
This only daughter of the Staffords had inherited
from her mother a complexion more common under
northern skies. The glory of her golden-brown hair
completed a picture of radiance seldom seen to the
same degree of perfection. Sometimes her father
would tease her about her blushes ! As a matter
of fact the healthy glow of Phyllis?s cheeks had a
curious knack of changing colour according as the
spirit moved her. Hence, to her father?s close
scrutiny, they acted as a seldom-failing index to
the child?s thoughts and whims. Even her brothers
had grown to learn therefrom just how far it was
safe to presume on her good nature, whether during
their pastimes and games, or during the more
serious moments of allotted duties in the home.
Phyllis, however, was not given to ? moods ? ;
she was not temperamental. On the contrary, she
was possessed of a most placid and lovable dispo-
sition. She was open-hearted and frank with all
with whom she came into contact, and had a smile
for everybody. Her father, mother and brothers
all adored her, but took very good care that the
baby of the family should not be spoiled by any
needless pampering on their part.
Entirely unconscious was this child herself of
her beauty and natural talents. Her lengthy hair
she positively loathed. Flowing as it did in natural
wavelets, already below her waist, it continually
impeded her movements ?especially when racing on


horseback through the bush. When climbing trees,
at which she was an adept, it got hooked up into
the branches. Then there were the combing and
brushing processes, which generally brought tears
to her eyes.
? Mummy,? she had said a thousand times,
? why can?t I have my hair cut quite short?just
like boys ? You don?t know, Mummy darling, what
a trial it is to me.?
Betwixt the daredevils of Reggie?s set and this
young girl friend there existed a wonderful spirit
of comradeship. It would have been as much as
their lives were worth to have treated her with
the superior sufferance which boys often mete out
to their girl companions. Then, Phyllis had proved
her metal. Young as she was, she had more than
once put them to shame by some bold exploit,
whether it were riding, jumping or climbing. Her
boy friends felt compelled, therefore, to admit her
into their ranks?as an equal. They admired and
appraised?nay, sometimes even envied?her skill
and daring. In addition to such facts, however,
Phyllis?s boy chums had grown to treasure her
companionship. She now accompanied them on
most of their adventurous expeditions?opossum
hunting, sheep and cattle drafting, and even, on
occasions, kangaroo hunting.
But there was one ? fly in the ointment ? for poor
Phyllis : her mother was adamant in denying her
the pleasure of swimming with her young com-


panions down at the pool. Phyllis could not under-
stand her mother?s attitude in this respect. She
loved the cool, dark water of the shaded pool almost
more than anything else. Moreover, she positively
hated the thought of being excelled by her boy
chums in the science of swimming.
In vain Phyllis?s mother explained to her that
it was neither safe nor ladylike for a young maiden
to go swimming, unless attended by older and more
responsible folk than mere boys.
For Phyllis the whole subject was reopened this
very morning on which Wilfred and Tony had come
over for the day. The three boys were bent on
spending the whole of the early afternoon down at
the pool. It was a hot day, and the boys, before
lunch, were full of enthusiasm. In tears, Phyllis
sought out her mother.
? Mother darling, can?t I go with them this after-
noon ? ? she pleaded.
? I?m afraid not, dear. You will soon be going
to a young ladies? college, you know, and then you
will have ample opportunity for learning to swim
and dive like the boys.?
But Phyllis, far from satisfied, hunted out her
brother Reg, and begged him to plead on her behalf.
Like a kind and sympathetic brother, Reg
marched off and, finding his mother, begged
earnestly of her to allow Phyllis to accompany them.
? No, Reg, dear,? was the firm reply; ? I?m so
dreadfully afraid something might happen to my
only little daughter. She really cannot be allowed
to go swimming unattended by older folks.?


? But will you let her come with us ? ? persisted
Reg.
? Well ?yes ?perhaps so ?if you promise to take
very good care of her and not allow her out of your
sight.?
Reg could scarcely stifle a chuckle at the thought
of Phyllis and all these cotton-wool precautions.
He knew her only too w T ell for wiiat she was. But
he merely said :
? Oh, that?s bully, Mum ! I?ll go and call her.
Poor kid, she?s nearly broken-hearted.?
?Is she, Reg, dear ? Then tell her to come here
for a moment. I should like to speak to her.?
In high glee Reg bounded off and imparted the
good news to his young sister.
? Oh, Reg, you?re just a darling ! ? exclaimed
Phyllis, bestowing upon her brother a kiss.
? Mum wants you for a tick, Phyllis,? her brother
then informed her.
?Phyllis, dear,? said her mother, as her daughter
winsomely threw her arms about her, ? I?m afraid
you sometimes think your mother very horrid and
unkind. But listen, dear ! I always try to do
what?s best, and we don?t always realize wiiat is
best for us until we grow older and learn more
sense. Would you very much like to go with the
boys this afternoon ? ?
? Yes?oh, yes, Mummy darling ! ?
? Very well, then, you may go. But listen, dear !
These are a few lines which, years ago, my own
mother used to repeat to me in England when I was
a little girl:


? Mother, may I go out for a swim ?
Yes, my darling daughter.
Hang your cloke on a hickory limb
But don?t go near the water ! ?
Phyllis laughed heartily at this exceedingly
contradictory tag, and then, bestowing on her
mother a final affectionate kiss, hurried away to
rejoin her young companions.
Lunch over, the children collected their ponies
and first went for a good long ride. An hour later
the boys, at least, were having the time of their
lives down at the pool. They were swimming,
ducking and diving in the cool, placid fresh water
to their hearts? content, while occasionally Phyllis
spent her time bombarding them from the bank
with pellets of clay. It was on the whole a wonderful
afternoon for all. But, for Phyllis at all events, even
better sport was mapped out for the evening.
? What about a ?possum hunt to-night, Willie ? ?
suggested Reg with enthusiasm as the family sat
at the long dining-table over their evening meal.
?By golly, yes ! Everybody on ? ?
? Yes, rather ! ? said Tony. ? Clinking night and
a beautiful moon.?
? Righto, then ! We?ll take the pea-rifle and the
old collie, Rover. Coming, Phyllis ? ?
? Yes, you bet ! ?if Mother?ll let me.?
? Don?t be out too late, then, dears,? said Mrs.
Stafford ; and added : ? What restless mortals you
all are, to be sure ! ?


CHAPTER XII
A ?Possum Hunt
IMMEDIATELY after supper the quartet set
off with the dog into the bush, within easy
walking distance of the homestead. In the silvery
moonlight the bush presented a truly enchanting
appearance. The moon was a full one, and fairly
high up ; there was not a cloud in the sky. Reggie
spurred on old Rover to go off in advance of them
by tearing along with the dog a short distance and
shouting : ?Go on, fetchum ?possum ! Fetchum
?possum, boy ! ?
Presently the well-trained old dog was off like a
shot, and was soon lost to view in the darker bush
beyond. The huntsmen strolled quietly forward in
the wake of the dog, and talked at sixes to the
dozen. Before long, however, some vigorous bark-
ing on the part of the old collie, a quarter of a mile
distant or thereabouts, excited the huntsmen into
a sharp run in the direction whence sounded the
dog?s calls. They were not long in coming upon
Rover. The dog, they found, was frantically
leaping about under a young but fairly tall blue
gum.
? My ! ? exclaimed Reg, moving about under the
tree endeavouring to sight the opossum with the


aid of the great orb of the moon, ? I guess we should
soon have this joker ! ?
? I spot him ! ? shouted Tony excitedly. ? Look !
See ! There he is, just in that fork of the branches !
Can?t you see him ? See his beautiful silver fur !
Look ! There he goes ! ?
? Ah, yes, I see him now! ? exclaimed Reg.
? Look ! He?s moving up higher ! ?
Then, ere the boys could say ? Jack Robinson,?
they beheld Phyllis scuttling up the tree, hand
over hand, climbing higher and higher.
? Well, I be shot ! ? exclaimed Willie.
? Isn?t she a little monkey ? ? From Reg,
admiringly.
Phyllis had now reached the fork. She then
observed that the ?possum had climbed to its
utmost, far out on the branch above her head.
She realized that it would be unsafe to venture
much higher herself, and so, taking hold of the
branches, she shook them with all her young might.
The opossum, however, never so much as budged.
It was safely ensconced in a mass of twigs and
leaves, and hung on tenaciously despite the shaking
to which it was subjected.
Phyllis moved a shade higher up, till the tender
branches of the young tree bent and swayed danger-
ously beneath her weight. Again she pulled and
tugged with her whole strength. The tree-top bent
and swayed ominously. Then a loud cracking
sound was heard, which seemed to emanate from
the fork below her.
? Here, come down, Phyllis ! Mum said you


were not to climb so high! Come down; it?s
snapping ! Look out ! By jingo ! ?
The two other boys added their warnings to
those of Reg, but the united warnings of the lads
were totally unheeded. Deftly, Phyllis lifted her
weight from the cracking branch and continued
shaking its fellow for all she was worth. At times
the tree-top bent almost at right angles with its
base by reason of Phyllis?s violent efforts to dis-
lodge her quarry. Then again she climbed just a
shade higher, resting most of her weight on the
stronger limb, and clinging to the weaker one to
retain her balance. With her one free hand she
now shook the upper branches with all the power
she was able to exert, sharply and vigorously.
? Hooray ! Got him ! ? excitedly from below,
as the furry ball above at length lost its balance.
A snapping of twigs ensued, and then a dull thud
as the ?possum contacted with the hard earth
below. The creature, unhurt however, scurried for
its life to safety. But it failed to get far ; Rover
had quickly pounced upon it. The old dog was
used to this game, and knew his job. Soon the
beautiful furry creature lay dead, its prized and
valued coat scarcely even mauled by the old dog.
Phyllis, having reached the ground in safety,
proceeded to where the opossum lay. Picking it
up, she hugged it and, undetected by her com-
panions, shed a tear over it, and finally handed it
to Reggie. But, like the rest of the party, she was
soon all agog with excitement in anticipation of
further sport.


?Go on, Rover ! Fetch ?em out! Fetch ?em
out, old boy ! ? she exclaimed.
Rover, after casting a lingering sidelong glance
at his recent victim, was very soon off again into
the moonlit bush.
While the young huntsmen followed lazily m the
wake of the dog and kept their ears open for further
barking, Tony told his companions a little story of
two pet opossums he once had kept at home.
? They lived in a kerosene box,? he explained,
? in a dark corner of the unused schoolroom at
? Stronghurst.? We used to let the little beggars
out of a night to scamper about and enjoy them-
selves. My, they had great times together . Uou
remember them, Reg ? ? ?
? Didn?t they ever try to get right away ? asked
Phyllis.
?No fear ! They were too well fed for that.
They were great pets. But one summer Mum made
some hop beer. The cask containing this was placed
out of the way in the schoolroom to ferment. Of
course, you know, you have to let the tap drip a
bit, or the cask might explode. So a bowl was
placed beneath the tap to catch the drippings.?
? But what?s all this got to do with the ?pos-
sums ? ? queried Reg wonderingly.
?Wait a bit! You?ll see. Well, Joey, the
smaller and the prettier of the pets, a lovely, fat
little thing, thought he?d like a drink one night.
Not being a prohibitionist ?
? A what ? ? exclaimed Phyllis, engrossed deeply
in the story.


? A prohibitionist.?
? What?s that ? ?
? Why, one who would prevent the sale or con-
sumption of intoxicants.?
? Yes, I see ! Go on ! ?
W ell, J�ey, not being a prohibitionist or a
teetotaler, imbibed a long draught of this un-
fermented beer from the bowl under the tap.?
? J ove ! _ What happened ? ? exclaimed Reg.
? Why, in the morning, when Willie went into
the schoolroom to close the door of their cage, he
couldn?t find Joey anywhere?could you, Willie ? ?
? No. I hunted high and low for him for a Ion?
time.?
? Then Willie called me,? resumed Tony, ? and
together we at length discovered the little beggar
curled up behind a trunk. Poor Joey ! He was
swelled up to about the size of a football; his one
and only spree had proved a bitter experience for
him.?
? Was poor Joey dead ? ? asked Phyllis.
? Dead ? Yes?as dead as a doornail.?
? And what about the other one ? ?
? Oh, Jacko we called him. Jacko had evidently
taken the tip. Anyway, he hadn?t gone on the beer.
He was all right, though he seemed very frightened.
But Jacko had always been the more timid of the
two. He possessed a beautiful fur, a little darker
in colour than Joey?s, and had a lovely ring-tail?
white tip, you know.?
? What happened to him ? ? asked the interested
and curious Phyllis.


? Well, Jacko became a ? passive resister ? ?or a
* conscientious objector ? ?to being caged up all the
time. He escaped ? solitary ? one night and managed
to find his way out of the schoolroom. Then Rover
I think it was?got him. And that was the end of
Tacko ?
J ? Poor little dears ! ?
? Listen ! ? suddenly exclaimed Willie. ? There?s
old Rover again. Got another. Seems a good
distance off.?
? Sharp?s the word ! ? from Reg. ? Come
along ! ? And away the party scuttled once more.
It took them a good ten minutes to get to the
dog. Old Rover this time was gazing up into the
eerie heights of a giant eucalyptus. He had
probably chased the ?possum up this tree from
below. The tree-trunk was large and straight,
and the foliage above thick and plentiful.
Again the huntsmen, with the aid of the moon
as a reflector, focused their gaze on the heavy
matted foliage above their heads. From side to
side they walked, searching through every bunch
of leaves, with the bright silvery moon as a back-
ground.
? I don?t know where the little beggar could have
got to,? quoth Reg. ? I guess I?ve seen through
every leaf of that tree.?
? There he is ! I spot him ! ? shouted Willie.
? See ? He?s half hidden, about the centre, there,
where all those branches meet ! Do you see him ?
perched on that big main branch which extends
down the trunk of the tree ? ?


? Yes, I see him ! ? excitedly exclaimed Phyllis.
?? You can see only the top of his back. He?d be
quite snug and secure crouching down there were
it not for the tell-tale moon shining on his fur.?
? Yes, yes, I see him ! ? exclaimed Reg and Tony
in a breath.
? Well, there?s only one way of getting this
joker,? said Reg, unslinging and loading his pea-
rifle. ? We?ll have to pot him, I can see.?
Taking steady aim, he fired. The marsupial
seemed scared, but unhurt, as it snuggled down more
closely upon the limb.
? Whistled over him, I think. Just a shade too
high,? said Willie.
? You have a try, Willie.?
Willie, resting the barrel of the rifle in the fork
of a small sucker, let drive.
?No good. He?s still there.?
The huntsmen, one after the other, all tried their
luck, but the little creature refused to budge. They
fired from different angles, but with the like result.
Finally, Reg put a ? shot ? cartridge in the barrel
of his rifle and fired. Again and again he tried.
But the opossum seemed quite the master of the
situation ; it was now less visible than ever before.
? Think we can climb up ? ? queried Tony.
? Let?s have a go.? He endeavoured, after re-
moving his boots and stockings, to implant his toes
into the bark of the great tree. His mates pushed
him upwards till he was beyond their reach. Then,
as Tony seemed stuck and unable to proceed
further, Reg jumped on to Willie?s shoulders and


helped him a further yard or two. A narrow bulge
in the tree, at a spot from which a great limb forked
out higher up, now enabled the climber to obtain
a better grip. Slowly, bit by bit, Tony worked his
way up several feet. The branch now was very
nearly within his reach.
? Another step or two, Tony ?bravo ! ? from
below.
Tony now had his arms encircling the large out-
stretching limb. After this it was easy going. The
little climber nimbly swung himself up from branch
to branch. He was getting very near now to where
the opossum had been sighted.
? Can?t you see him ? ? from below. <e Why,
you?re nearly on top of him now ! ?
? Good golly ! Yes, I see him ! ? shouted Tony
to his companions. ? Seems pretty tame, doesn?t
he ? ?
Little by little Tony edged towards his prey.
? Why, the little beggar?s still there ! Hasn?t
moved an inch! ? he shouted down. Then
presently he got hold of it and shouted, to the
great amusement and delight of his companions :
? Why, it?s dead ; shot clean through the spine !
Look out, you fellows ; I?ll throw it down ! Call
Rover away, Reg ! ?
On picking up the opossum from the ground
below the huntsmen subjected it to a close scrutiny.
One bullet, they discovered, had nearly severed its
spine ; another had grazed its back ; whilst the
upper portion of its back was riddled with shot
holes.


? Your first bullet must have settled it, Reg ! ?
exclaimed Willie. ? You remember it moved
slightly and then sank down again?as we thought?
crouching upon the limb.?
Tony by this time had reached again to the
lowest fork of the tree.
? Look out, you chaps ! ? he shouted. ? All
clear ? I?m going to jump ! ?
? Righto ! All clear ! ?
? Look out, then ! ? And down he came, nearly
twenty feet through the air.
It was late by this time, and so the party made
tracks for home again. Rover amused himself by
chasing a few more opossums up the trees on their
return journey, but the youthful huntsmen pushed
on without any further halts.
? Well, we?ve only secured two,? said Reg.
? But we?ve had a bit of sport out of it. Sometimes
we get as many as seven or eight.?
After a little pillow-fighting that night ere finally
turning into bed, the happy male trio were soon
fast asleep, and a great quietness stole over the old
homestead.


CHAPTER XIII
Initiation Ceremonies
FOUR years elapsed.
Both Wilfred and Tony were now established
at their new college in Melbourne. Their elder
brother, Cyril, was proving extraordinarily success-
ful in his office in the city, and splendid prospects
were opening out before him. Tony, too, at his
college, was doing exceedingly well. He was now
a prefect. This fact was due not to any remarkable
scholarly aptitude he exhibited so much as to the
influence he wielded over other boys. He had
revealed himself as a born leader, and?what added
greatly to his popularity ?he excelled in games and
athletics.
Wilfred was neither so clever nor so athletic as
his younger brother, but he was more studiously
inclined. He loved ? swotting ? for its own sake.
In term-time he was seldom to be seen without a
book of some kind ready to hand for dipping into.
During the afternoon period of recreation, if he was
not actually engaged in reading, a close observer
could invariably detect upon Wilfred a bulging
pocket.
From the outset Tony Wainwright had taken a
keen interest in most of the sporting events of his


school. He was particularly keen on cricket, box-
ing and swimming ; football and rowing had not
the same attractions for him. It was, at the
moment, his greatest ambition to carry off the
premier honours for his school attached to the
three sporting events mentioned. In his efforts to
achieve this ambition he had the loyal backing of
Wilfred, and of a host of friends and admirers.
Though he was only sixteen, Tony was tall and
robust for his years. He had an older head on his
shoulders than had most boys of his age. Freshly-
complexioned, dark-haired, and with eyes dark and
deep-set, he might have been considered really
handsome. At all events, his personality was one
to be reckoned with amongst his schoolfellows.
One bright, sunny afternoon, during a cricket
trial match, Wilfred and Tony and a group of
their friends were sitting on the grass near the
pavilion of the cricket field. Richmond, the cricket
captain, was one of the group, and Waters, a burly
figure and the school?s crack boxer, was another.
? I say, Wainwright,? Richmond was saying,
addressing Tony, ? if we can pull the match off
with the Scotchies we?ll be cock of the roost in
sports this year.?
? I don?t know,? was the reply. ? Our rowing
needs stiffening a bit, but I guess we can count
on Waters here as far as the gloves go.?
? Don?t be too sure of that,? laughed Waters.
? I?m getting a bit too much flesh on for my liking.
After a few bouts of late, I puff like an old grampus.?
?Well, you?ll jolly soon have to work some of


it off then, yon lazy beggar! ? rejoined Tony.
? You?re our only hope, you know, in the glove
line.?
? Cut it out, Wainwright! What about your-
self ? ?
? Me ? ?
? Yes, you,? cut in Richmond. ? There?s not
much to choose, I guess, between you and Waters.
You had bad luck last time you met ?didn?t he,
Waters, old buck ? ?
? Bad luck ? Jove, yes ! Another flip on the
jaw would have bowled me clean over. If Wainy
hadn?t tripped and given me my chance ?
? Stow it, you fellows ! ? interrupted Tony.
? Those are the fortunes of war, you know. I was
fairly and squarely floored.?
? Well,? said Richmond, ? I wouldn?t risk too
much brass on Waters on the next occasion.?
? I hope you won?t risk any ,? said the individual
referred to, good-naturedly. ? I guess you won?t,
either, if you have the honour of the school at heart.
Remember old Hainy ? ?
? Don?t I just, poor devil! ?
? Sent down, wasn?t he ? ? asked Wilfred.
? Yes, rather. Pretty well off, too, he was.
Generous chap as well. But he was nabbed in
the end and made to tip out his pockets. Betting
tips galore ! Led to an inquiry. Finally he was
expelled sine die?
? Rotten luck, but served him right,? quoth
Wilfred,
? Golly,? exclaimed Tony excitedly at that


moment, ? that youngster out there can wield the
willow to some purpose ! What?s his name, Richy ?
Freshman, isn?t he ? ?
? Gregory,? said Wilfred, who had already made
his acquaintance, ? They say he?s related to Sid,
the international.?
? Really! Looks a sinewy young cuss. Gee
whiz ?another sixer?bang on to the score-board !
Bit dangerous sitting here when he gets on at the
other end. Think he?ll get his place in the team,
Richy ? ?
? Bit young. But we can do with a hard hitter
or two.?
? Look out, you fellows ! ? shouted Wilfred.
? Crikey, what a beauty ! ? he added as the group
of boys, having scattered as the result of a mag-
nificent drive clean into their midst, resumed their
old places on the grass.
?If young Gregory could keep up the form
he?s showing to-day he?d be a cert! ? exclaimed
Tony.
? I wonder what the score is ? ? mused Waters.
? I dunno, but I guess we?ve passed that of the
day boys. The boarders should be well on top
now.?
? Hi, Snooky ! ? ?to the young scorer in the
pavilion ?? how do we stand ? ?
?Wait a mo? ! . . . Boarders 133 for 7.?
? What did the other fellers get ? ?
? 129.?
? Ha, I thought so ! ? exclaimed Tony. ? What
about pulling stumps, Richy ? ?


?No ! Give ?em all a knock. It?s only a trial
match. Nothing at stake.?
? Hullo, Gregory?s split his finger, I believe ! ?
said Tony, as the watchers beheld the hard-hitter
suddenly throw down his bat and do a few skips
about the turf, shaking his hand vigorously.
Richmond got to his feet and strolled over to the
wickets. After a short while he returned, bringing
Gregory with him. He then sent out another
young batsman to take Gregory?s place, and the
game was resumed.
? Good ball! ? shouted Tony appreciatively, as
the new arrival?s middle stump was sent flying
yards behind the stumps.
? Bit of a demon bowler, that fellow Jones,? said
Gregory, who now formed one of the group of
young critics on the grass. ? He?s making ?em
bump a bit, too.?
? How?s the finger ? ? asked Wilfred.
? Oh, tip top now, Wainwright, thanks. It just
split the index finger a bit. Soon be all right. No
need for me to go out again, is there ? ? ?to the
captain.
? No, no !. . . Hello, another feller out! Hey,
there ! ? ?shouting to the umpire?? bring in the
stumps, will you ? ?
And so the trial match between day boys and
boarders came to an end, with the boarders well
on top.
That night there were high jinks up in the school
dormitory ; the initiation ceremonies for the fresh-
men were on the boards. Each of the new boarders


had to submit in turn to being crowned. The nature
of this function, unfortunately, does not admit of
precise definition on paper. Many of the freshmen
rebelled vigorously against the indignities it en-
tailed, but the wiser among them, seeing no hope
of escape, submitted to the humiliation with good
grace.
At the senior end of the dormitory, later, a
group of boys sat on two of the beds talking to-
gether ?sotto voce. But for their monotonous
droning, all was now quiet in the large dormitory.
? How many freshies are there ? ? Gemmett was
asking.
? Only five in the senior dorm, and six in the
youngsters?,?? replied Foster.
? We can leave the young ?uns for another night.
Got enough cord ready ? ?
? Yes ?yards ! ? replied Burgoyne.
? But, I say,? said Tony, ? that chap Gregory ;
what?ll we do about him ? Got a nasty finger, you
know.?
? Oh, it won?t harm his finger, you silly chump ! ?
? Well, it might do. Is it worth running the risk ? ?
? Yes, you bet your life ! ? exclaimed McCarthy.
? If we don?t do ?em all together we may not have
another chance.?
? Well, go easy on him, you fellows, if he should
complain of his finger troubling him. We don?t
want to run any risks about Gregory ; may need
him in the cricket team next week.?
? Righto, we?ll see to that ! ? said Girlie, a light-
haired, fresh-complexioned youth.


? Are we all here ? ? queried Burgoyne, looking
round, and then beginning to count. ? One, two,
three . . . nine. No, we want one more. Who
shall we get ? ?
? What about your brother, Mack ? ? suggested
Foster.
? No, he?s a bit too soft for the job ; doesn?t
cotton on much to this sort of thing.?
? Well, go and wake up old Mehan,? said Wilfred.
? If you don?t, he?ll sure wake up everyone else.
Listen to the old beggar snoring ! My, I shouldn?t
care to sleep next to Mehan ! ?
Mehan was awakened and ultimately hauled
along to join the group at the farther end of the
dormitory. Having arranged the precise moment
for action, the ten seniors retired to their beds to
await the promised signal an hour later. Not a
sound other than loud, stertorous breathing and
some protracted guttural disturbances was now
audible in the large dormitory. But at long last the
college clock struck two sonorous notes, denoting
eleven-thirty. Instantly a few shuffling sounds
were heard, and the creaking of iron bedsteads in
various directions. Then, like spectres of the night,
ten stalwart lads assembled in their sleeping attire
and tripped in their naked feet to the lower end of
the dormitory. A minute later screams and yells
resounded through the large room, instantly bring-
ing to a sitting posture all those who were not
immediately concerned, and who till now had been
fast asleep. Down the centre of the dormitory
five freshers were being dragged the entire length


of the long passage by means of stout cords affixed
to one of their big toes. As each of the freshers
had two seniors pulling on the cord attached to
his toe, there was little escape for him. But all
five yelled and kicked and threatened. One,
Caulder by name, swore volubly. Then, realizing
the utter futility of swearing, he screamed aloud,
in order, no doubt, to attract the attention of the
dormitory master. But this also was to no purpose,
except to heap ? coals of fire ? on his own head;
or, to be precise, prolong the agonies in the region
of his nether extremity. This recalcitrant was
hauled, not only the single length of the dormitory,
but back again. By this time the corded slip-knot
had eaten into the flesh, and his toe was numbed,
raw and bleeding. An hour later, however, except
for the sonorous snoring of some of the sounder
sleepers, all was quiet again in the senior dormitory.
But the five freshmen had not even yet been
fully initiated into the school. Next morning, early,
they were required to ? run the gauntlet.? This
entailed running to and from the farther end of the
dormitory between a double file of boys, who stood
on the ends of their beds armed with wet towels.
Any sensible boy would at once have taken to his
heels and speedily gone through the ordeal. Many
who were lucky went through it thus quite un-
scathed. But on this occasion the young freshman,
Caulder, who overnight had proved the most
troublesome in the toe-lining episode, again rebelled.
When called upon to take his turn in running the
gauntlet, he shouted :


? No, I wont! I won?t! ? .
? Oh, you won?t, won?t you ! ? exclaimed Bur-
goyne. ? Come on then, lads ! Gather round
him ! Now ?all together ! ?
Flip, flip, flip w r ent the towls. Flap, flip, _P>
flip they continued, as they lashed the victim?s
thinly-clad body.
? You devil, Burgoyne ; I?ll pay you out for
this ! ? roared Caulder.
? Don?t be a fool! Play the man, and get it
over,? was the reply, as the towels still fhpped-
flapped mercilessly on the body of the recalcitrant
fresher.
? I won?t, I tell you ! I won?t! I won?t! You
can flip till you?re tired, and be dd to you ! ?
? All right then, lads ! ? said Burgoyne, address-
ing his mates; ? there?s only one way to deal with
this sort. Take hold of him there, you fellows !
Kick away, Freshy ! That?s right, old man. Mind
his teeth, Girlie ! Now then, come along ?we?ll
bestow upon him the ? Order of the Bath.? To
the bathroom, you fellows. Fill the bath up,
Mehan 1 ?
? You . . . devils ! . . . You just . . . wait!
. . . Take that! ?he concluded, launching a terrific
kick at Burgoyne, who had hold of one of his
legs.
Splash I ?as the helpless victim was dropped
suddenly into the cold bath.
?Ha ! that?ll cure him of his cussedness ! ?
laughed Gemmett.
Splosh ! splosh ! splosh ! ?as each of the boys


in turn enjoyed the usual privilege in such cases
of ducking the unhappy victim afresh.
? Come on, lads,? said Burgoyne presently,
? I guess he?s had sufficient. Perhaps he?ll be a
wiser man after this. Anyway, he can consider
himself an honoured ? 0.8.? now.?
? ? 0.8.? be d ! ? shouted the enraged
Caulder.
? Shhhh! Don?t be naughty, now! Listen,
Caulder ! We?ve another ? Order ? to bestow on
the very brave. We?ll make you a 4 Knight Com-
mander ? next time. But it?s no great chalks, I
can tell you. So go canny ! ?
Having so said, to the accompaniment of much
merriment from his youthful co-initiators, Burgoyne
gently closed the door of the bathroom and allowed
its solitary inmate to continue with his morning
ablutions in peace.
During the afternoon of that same day Tony
Wainwright came across Caulder limping along by
himself on the sports ground. Caulder looked
daggers at the young prefect, and turned aside to
walk away from him. But the young prefect was
not one to be so snubbed. Striding towards him,
Tony grabbed him gently by the arm and addressed
him kindly, thus :
? Caulder, a word with you, if you don?t mind.?
? What do you want ? ? was the sulky response.
? Come and sit down under yon shade.?
In silence the boys made their way over towards
a large blue gum, and seated themselves on the
grass under its spreading branches.


? Now then,? began Tony, ? I just want to say
this : You made a bit a fool of yourself last
night and this morning.? ~ ,
� If that?s all you want to tell me,? was the heated
reply, ? you can just stow your gab.?
?No, it is not all I want to tell you,? smilingly.
? For your own good, Caulder, I want to advise
you to play the man. We?ve all had to go through
the mill, you know ?every Jack one of us. Ninety
out of every hundred take it all in good part, and
are none the worse for it. The other ten, who
make fools of themselves and don?t know how to
play the game, generally get a rotten time of it
both then and afterwards.?
? Thanks for your compliments ! ? ?sneermgly.
? Do you think I don?t know how to look after
myself ? ?
? Well, Caulder, it doesn?t seem like it, you know.
You did make an ass of yourself. Of course, if
you want to go on cutting your own throat . .
? I?d rather that, than let a pack of bullies cut
my toe off for me.?
Tactfully repressing a smile, Tony continued :
? Look here, Caulder, whose fault was it that
you had such a dose of it ? The other fellows, who
took it in good part, were none the worse for the
ordeal. Do you imagine you can break down
ancient school traditions by making an ass of
yourself ? ?
? Thanks, again ! ?
?Or do you think ? ?ignoring the sneer ?
? you?ll be any the happier for remaining at logger-


heads with the school over this business ? You are
here for, perhaps, several years, you know.?
? Who said so ? ?
? Well, I guess so, anyway, and it?ll be like hell
for you if you choose to make it so. On the other
hand, by playing the game, you can make them the
happiest years of your life. If I were you I should
go to Burgoyne, the senior prefect, and put yourself
right with him at once.?
? Not if I know it ?the damned bully ! ?
? Well, think it over, old man ! There?s a lot at
stake you know, as far as you are concerned, and
I?m only advising you for your own good. Now
I must be off.?
All that Tony got for his trouble was a sneering
? Thanks for your advice ! ? But the young
prefect, conscious of having done his best, went off
happily and rejoined his schoolfellows at play.


CHAPTER XIV
The Cricket Match
THE Christmas holidays were drawing near.
Shortly, the most important cricket match
of the season was to take place. Upon the result
of it depended the winning of the shield and the
inter-schools? premiership. Tony was tremendously
keen that his school should win these coveted
honours. Their rivals were the ? Scotchies ? ?a
large Presbyterian College which possessed some
first-class cricketers. They were dour fighters,
these Scotchies. ? But as Tony to himself often
averred ?? I think, with a slice of luck, we should
be able to lick them.?
? A penny for your thoughts,? suddenly ex-
claimed Richmond, coming upon the young cricket
enthusiast unawares on one of these occasions.
? Not if I know it,? was the laughing response.
? Worth a trifle more than that.?
? Well, let?s have ?em for more, then.?
? I was thinking of the match with the Scotchies
next week. Think we can lick ?em ? ?
? Yes, you bet. They?ll have to go all out,
anyway, if they want to beat the ? Cults ? this
time.?
? Cultores veritatis fraudis inimici ,? quoted Tony


musingly. ? Well, Richy, if you speak truly, and
if there?s anything in the motto of our old col.,
there should be no further room for any doubt in
the matter, eh ? ?
? ? The followers of truth are the enemies of
deceit,? ? mused Richmond. ? I can follow the
old motto better in English than in Latin,? he said
laughingly. Then, in answer to Tony?s question,
? Yes, if there?s anything in those words, they
should stand us in good stead next week.?
? Rather ! Cultores veritatis , you know ! We
were not nicknamed the Cults for nothing, I guess ?
and the Truth is that we are going to win.?
? But they?ve a jolly good googly bowler,? said
Richy, reverting once more to the Cults? doughty
cricket opponents of the following week.
? Young Carr, you mean ? ?
? Yes.?
? But we?ve a couple of freshers who should
strengthen our team, you know?Tones and young
Gregory.?
? Bit erratic, Gregory. Kind who might get
either a century or a duck. You can never tell.
Jones should certainly stiffen the bowling?if we
get any sort of a decent day. On a good hard
wicket he?ll be nearly unplayable, I guess.?
The coming match for the whole week following
was practically the sole topic of conversation in
the school?s sporting circles.
During the course of the week?s practice games
a dozen times over in his mind Richmond altered
the composition of his team. Finally, the great


day came round ?a real snorting hot day for the
particular time of year. The Scotchies team,
accompanied by a host of uproarious partisans
and supporters, arrived early on the field. What
a din they made with their penny trumpets. And
what a gallant show they presented with their
striped blazers and gaily fluttering colours ! There
were a good thousand spectators on the field.
These were mainly enthusiasts from the various
competing schools, together with their relations and
friends.
When the Cults? team arrived, Tony and Wilfred
came in for a pleasant surprise. At the gate leading
into the ground they found awaiting them their
father, Colonel Stafford and Phyllis. Phyllis was
now a beautiful child of fifteen. She had specially
contrived to get off school for the day in order to
be able to accompany her father to the cricket
match with Mr. Wainwright.
? Jove, pater ! ? exclaimed Tony, on catching
sight of the little group at the gate. ? This is a
surprise. How do you do, Colonel Stafford ?
Hallo, Phyllis ! I hope you?ll all bring us luck
to-day.?
? Why, of course we shall,? laughed Phyllis.
? What a thing to say ! ?
? Look out for yourself, then, Phyllis, if you
don?t! Life won?t be worth living for you, I
guess.?
? Well, Wilfred, my boy,? said his father, ? not
playing to-day ? ?
? No, not I. It?s risky enough having one in the


family turning out. But I guess Tony won?t let
us down.?
That?s the spirit, Wilfred,? broke in the colonel.
? Oh, I say,? delightedly exclaimed Phyllis,
clapping her hands with glee as they entered through
the gates on to the field of play, ?what a jolly
crowd ! ?
? Got your colours, young woman ? ? asked Tony.
?Of course I have ? ?proudly displaying the
coloured ribbons?? but I?ve a great mind to put
them in my pocket after that. What questions you
do ask ! ?
? All right, Phyllis. See you later. Must sprint
off now.?
? Good luck, Tony ! ? shouted the little group
in a breath, as the young cricketer made off and
threaded his way through the crowd towards the
pavilion.
? There, they?re going on to the field! ? exclaimed
Phyllis ten minutes later. ? I wonder who?s won
the toss ? ?
? I hardly know,? answered Wilfred. ? But it
seems we re batting first. It?s the Scotchies who
are taking the field.?
? Gh ! Do you think the Cults will win ? ?
Dunno. Scotchies have been called the Invin-
cibles this year.?
? I wonder who?s batting first ? ?
? Don?t let the child worry you too much,
Wilfred,? said the colonel laughingly. ?If she
becomes a nuisance we?ll have to pack her off home
again.?


? Oh, will you ? Remember, you and Mr. Wain-
wright are under my wing to-day, father.?
? Hear that, Wainwright ? ? asked the colonel,
laughing aloud.
? Yes. But, good lor ! I?m sorry for her wings,
if that?s the case, eh, Stafford ? ?
? Oh, here come the batsmen ! ? excitedly ex-
claimed Phyllis. ? Who are they, Wilfred ? ?
? Richmond, the captain, and ... let me see
. . . Waters, I think.?
? Is that the boxer that knocked Tony out ? ?
? Yes.?
? I wonder when Tony will be going in ? ?
? Generally about third or fourth wicket
down.?
? What a funny bowler that one at the lower end
is,? said Phyllis, a little later. ? Why, Ido believe
I could bowl better than that myself. What?s his
name, Wilfred ? ?
? He?s the crack googly ?Carr.?
? The what ? ?
? The googly.?
? Why, I could bowl better than that underhand.
. . . Oh, here comes Tony ! ? exclaimed Phyllis,
waving her handkerchief excitedly.
? Cooee ! ? bawled Stafford, to attract the lad?s
notice.
Tony, having heard the familiar call, now hurried
towards them.
? Richmond doesn?t seem very comfortable
against Carr,? he said, taking his seat amongst his
friends. ? Groundsman said there was a drop of


rain during the night. Drying wicket will just suit
the googly.?
? Why doesn?t he hit them ? ? asked Phyllis.
? He?s bowling slowly enough for rounders. Guess
I could hit them with a stick ?let alone a bat.?
? He?s breaking yards. ... Ha ! I thought so !
Richy?s out ?skied one to leg! ?
? Who?s in next ? ?
? Young Gregory, our hitter. But I guess he
won?t do much with that stuff. Too tempting.?
? Golly, what a swipe ! ? shouted Wilfred.
? Clean out of the ground. Good old Gregory.?
? Got him ! ? roared a section of the crowd after
the fourth ball of Carr?s over.
? Gosh ! Looks bad ! ? exclaimed Tony. ? The
googly?s straight one beat him hands down ?middle
stump. Two, for about twenty.?
The Cults? third man was clean bowled by the
first ball he received from the top end.
? So long,? said Tony, ? I must sprint off now ! ?
u Good luck ! Good luck ! ? from the group of
friends.
? Well played, Tony,? shouted Stafford, some
quarter of an hour later?after the dismissal of the
Cults? fourth batsman.
?Well done, again ! ?
? Score?s mounting up steadily now,? observed
Mr. Wainwright.
? Yes. If these two can only stick there . . .?
f/ TTT 11 1 11. J
? Well bowled ! Oh, what a stunner ! ? roared
some of the crowd, as Tony?s leg stump was sent
flying.


? Bad luck. Poor old Tony! ? sympathized
Wilfred. ? Fifty-four for five. Gee whiz, looks
bad ! ?
Thereafter there was a procession. Two more
wickets fell for a further half-dozen. Presently
Tony strolled along again to his friends ?smiling
as usual, despite the way things were going.
? Bad luck, old boy ! ? said the colonel. ? But
there?s still hope, you know.?
? Yes, rather. Jonesey might knock a few,?
? Doesn?t look like it ! ? exclaimed Wilfred
suddenly, as Jones skied a ball to mid-on.
? Well caught, youngster ! ? roared the crowd.
? Seventy-nine for eight,? said Mr. Wainwright,
studying the score-board.
? Oh, Tony, what awfully bad luck ! ? sighed
Phyllis. ? I almost wish I hadn?t come.?
? Cheer up, Phyllis ! ? Tony replied. ?An
army?s never beaten before it?s defeated, you know.
Same with the Cults.?
? Eighty up,? said someone in the crowd.
? Beauty ! ? shouted Tony excitedly, as a ball
sailed well over the fence. ? That?s one out of
young Gregory?s repertoire.?
? Block ! Block ! Block ! That?s right, you
two,? said Wilfred. ? All day to-morrow
untouched yet.?
? Oh, bad luck ! Just tipped his bail.?
? Eighty-nine for nine ! ? breathed Tony. ? I
guess we won?t reach the hundred.?
?No, I thought not??a moment later ; ?all out
for eighty-nine ! Well, we?ll see if we can make


mincemeat of them now. But, oh, I say, it?s lunch
time. How?ll you all manage for lunch ? I?m
afraid I shall have to have mine over at the pav.
But there?s a tuck shop over there ? ?pointing to a
large marquee set up on the ground.
? Oh, we?ll be all right, boy,? said Mr. Wain-
wright. ? What time do you kick off again ? ?
? About one-fifteen, I think.?
During Tony?s absence in the pavilion the two
menfolk, Wilfred and Phyllis, all strolled over to
the marquee. Wainwright, having ordered the
necessaries for luncheon, the party sat on the now
warm, dry grass, and whiled away a pleasant half-
hour. No sooner had they resumed their old seats
than the Cults? team took the field.
? I hope Jones comes off to-day,? said Wilfred.
? He?s a real snorter when the wicket suits
him.?
? Oh, I do hope so ! ? said Phyllis.
No luck, however, attended the first hour?s play,
and ninety runs were scored ere the opening pair
of batsmen were separated. At the end of the
second hour the score stood at a hundred and
seventy for three. By teatime it was two hundred
and ten for six.
? Looking pretty bad,? said Colonel Stafford, as
the party, at his invitation, were strolling off to the
marquee again for some refreshments.
? Yes, sir,? replied Wilfred. ?If we have to
begin our second knock to-night, the light won?t
be too good for our fellows.?
A quarter of an hour later the game was once


more resumed. At half-past five the score stood
at two hundred and seventy for eight.
? What time do they draw stumps ? ? asked Mr.
Wainwright of Wilfred.
? At six, I believe.?
? Hullo, another man out ?caught by Tony in
the long field! ? observed the colonel, ? Two
hundred and ninety six for nine ! ?
? Golly ! . . . what the deuce ! . . . Blowed if
the captain?s not declaring ! ? exclaimed Wilfred
excitedly.
? That means you?ll have to get two hundred
and seven to save an inning?s defeat,? said the
colonel.
? Yes, and the Scotchies are reckoning on getting
a wicket to-night. Light?s a bit bad, too, with
those long shadows across the pitch. I wonder
who?ll go in first ? ?
? Here the Scotchies come out again,? said
Phyllis later. ? And, oh . . . here are the bats-
men following them ; who are they, Wilfred ? ?
? Waters and Burgoyne, I think.?
? Wasting no time. Sporting of them,? observed
the colonel. ? Only ten minutes to go, too.?
? That?s right, Waters, old cock,? shouted Wil-
fred presently, ? block ?em for all you?re worth.?
? I wonder how Burgoyne will shape with
Carr ? ? he added, later. ? Oh, good shot . . .
well fielded, Scotty ! ?
? That swipe to leg deserved more than a single,?
said Mr. Wainwright, ? Now Waters has the
bowling.?


i 3 B BOYS OF BACK O' BEYOND
? Good old Waters ! Block ! block?that?s the
game! ? shouted Wilfred, in high glee.
? Oh . . . got him / ? roared a spectator in the
crowd.
? What cussed luck! ? bemoaned Wilfred.
? Played a bit too far back, and knocked his own
bail off. Last ball of the over, too.?
? One for one ! H?m ! Bad ! ? commented
Colonel Stafford.
? Look?they?re pulling up the stumps,? said
Phyllis.
The party was now joined by Tony.
? Bad luck, son ! ? exclaimed his father.
? Yes, rotten luck old Waters getting out that
way.?
? Never mind ! You boys doing anything to-
night ? ?
? No, I think not.?
? Well, come along to the theatre with us then,
if you can. Good thing on, I believe ?? The Eternal
City.? ?
? Oh, goodo ! Two stars ?Julius Knight and
Maud Jeffries ?on the boards, aren?t there ? Thanks
Father ! ?
? Oh, Daddy, you darling! ? purred Phyllis
affectionately. ? And you didn?t say anything
about it.?
? Sure you and Tony can get off all right, Wil-
fred ? ? asked the colonel. ? We?re staying in
town to-night, you know. It?ll be a bit of a
change, going to the theatre for once, won?t it,
Phyllis ? �


? Yes, lovely. You are a darling ! ?
?Well, meet us at the ? Royal,? you boys, at seven
forty-five,? said their father. ?If you?re not there
by then we?ll know you?re not coming.?
? Yes, righto, pater, and thanks ever so much.?


CHAPTER XV
A Great Fight for Runs
WILFRED and Tony had both managed to
get off for the theatre in the evening, and
the show was pronounced a great success. For
Tony the play acted as a good ? pick-me-up ? in
taking his mind off the all-absorbing cricket match.
Next morning, at ten o?clock, the little party
assembled once more on the cricket field, and a half-
hour later, in blazing sunshine, the game was
resumed.
? Hello, that?s Jones going in with Burgoyne ! ?
exclaimed Wilfred.
? Didn?t come off much in the bowling, did he ?
Perhaps he?ll make up for it a bit now,? said Phyllis.
? I hope so. His bowling analysis yesterday was
only four for a hundred and three ?
? Oh, well hit, Burgy. Clean drive that?right
along the carpet.?
? Plays a good straight bat?Burgoyne,? said
Wilfred?s father.
? Yes, a bit stiff in the wrists, though?oh, good
one, Jones. Hello ! They?re taking the fast bowler
off. Been a bit expensive this morning.?
? Fifty up, I see,? said Stafford, looking at the
score-board after three-quarters of an hour?s play.


? Yes, looking a bit better now. Jones has got
thirty of them ?oh, cuss ! ?
? What?s that man got his arm up for ? ? asked
Phyllis.
? Leg before ?Jones is out 1.b.w.?
? Isn?t this the captain coming in now ? ? asked
Mr. Wainwright.
? Yes, that?s old Richy. Look, he?s having a
word with Burgoyne. He means to fight it out.?
? The demon?s going on again,? observed the
colonel later. ? Jove ! he?s uprooted Burgoyne?s
middle stump, too.?
The score-board now showed ? sixty-five for three
wickets.?
? Well, old Richy?s there still. We?re not done
yet,? exclaimed Wilfred. ? Let?s see ?he should
now have about seventeen to his credit.?
Wilfred?s face, however, grew a little longer when
the following two batsmen were out for an additional
forty runs ?and more particularly so as Gregory
happened to be one of them.
? A hundred and five for five ! Hullo, lunch
time ! ?
? There?s only Richy and Tony left who are
likely to do anything much now,? said Wilfred.
? I?m afraid it?s all up.?
?Ah ! there goes Tony out with the captain,?
exclaimed Phyllis in great glee after lunch. ?I do
hope he?ll make a few.?
? Want a hundred and two yet to wipe off arrears,
and most of the best men gone,? sadly reflected
Wilfred.


Richmond met Tony Wainwright half-way down
the pitch.
? Stonewall like blazes, Wainwright,? he said,
? especially with the straight ones ! Give old nick
to all the loose ones if you get half a chance. Take
no risks, though ! I believe we can pull it off yet.?
Tony?s dogged fighting faculties now served him
in good stead. Ere long it was evident?even to
his friends among the spectators ?that young Wain-
wright had his back to the wall. With Richmond,
Tony felt quite convinced that the fat was not yet
in the fire. The bowler chiefly responsible for
most of the damage so far was Carr, the googly.
His ball generally came in sharply from the leg with
a big spin on it. Occasionally, however, he had
sent down a straight fast one, with little apparent
difference in the action of his delivery. These had
taken most of the batsmen by surprise.
Tony watched carefully for these ? wrong ?uns.?
Each time they came along they were met with a
scrupulously straight bat. The leg-breaks he went
out to. Though inclined to scoop them somewhat,
he scored boundary after boundary from them.
Tony was blessed with an excellent eye. The
googly now varied his balls in every conceivable
manner. Sometimes he put down a short one,
hoping to catch Wainwright napping and get him
stumped. But, so long as they were off the wicket,
they were, one and all, treated with scant respect.
At the end of an hour?s batting Tony?s score stood
at the respectable figure of forty-five ?and the
total one-eighty-five.


Phyllis and Wilfred were both now in high
glee.
? Look ! ? agitatedly exclaimed the latter.
? They?re taking Carr off. About time, too. Put-
ting the fast-medium on again.?
The rate of scoring now slowed down a bit. But
Tony and his captain managed to put a few good
off-balls successfully through the slips, and occa-
sionally, with a good off-drive, to skittle the ball to
the boundary.
? They?re taking no risks,? said Wilfred.
? No,? replied the colonel. ? I was just watching
very closely the way they were manoeuvring those
off-balls. They?re keeping their elbows well for-
ward, and playing with perfectly straight bats ?
both of them.?
Presently, when the score topped the two-
hundred mark, the excitement among the Cults?
supporters knew no bounds ?and when, seven runs
later, the Scotchies? lead was wiped off, the Cults
were nearly mad with delight. Every scoring
stroke now was cheered to the echo. Slowly the
score mounted higher and higher. The opposing
captain rang the changes in the bowling, but to
little effect. There was always the straight bat
for the straight ball and a forward elbow for a drive,
to keep the ball on the grass.
? That lad of yours, Wainwright, keeps his head
well for a youngster of sixteen,? exclaimed the
colonel with enthusiasm.
? Yes. Remarkably well.?
? Golly 1 I thought Tony was a goner then,?


breathed Wilfred, with relief. ? Stumper just
failed to hold that snick.?
Presently, as two-fifty was recorded on the score-
board, there was another roar of delight from a
large section of the crowd. To this score Tony?s
contribution was seventy-six. The googly now
was restored to favour again, and tried by every
device and trick he knew to separate the batsmen.
But they were taking no risks. In all, seven of the
Scotchies? team had already been tried with the
ball. Some of them had bowled at the wicket?
good, straight, well-pitched balls ; others, with off-
balls, had tried to tempt the batsmen to play into
the hands of a veritable semi-circle of slip fielders ;
while still others had trundled down soft, short stuff
or full tosses, which cried aloud to be smacked to
the boundary. Boundaries, it is true, were scored,
but neither batsman would take any risk. Cautious
in the extreme, they refused to be tempted.
? What are the crowd shouting about now ? ?
asked Phyllis. ? Look at them ?standing up and
waving their handkerchiefs ! Just look, Wilfred?
look at that boy on that telegraph post! He?ll fall
off?oh, Wilfred ! ?
? Oh, he?s all right! ?
? But why?what are they all so mad about ? ?
? Don?t you see the board, Phil ? Three hundred
up. Oh, a beauty, Tony?right over the stands !
Golly, what a hefty one ! ?
? There they go again! What?s the matter
this time ? It isn?t four hundred up, is it ??
laughingly.


? No. But Tony?s hit put us a hundred ahead
of the Scotchies? total.?
? Oh, I see.?
? What a little chatterbox you are ! ? laughingly
said the colonel, addressing his daughter. ? Just
get hold of her tongue, will you, Wilfred, if it wags
too much.?
? He?d better try ! ?
Both batsmen now were visibly tiring. The
captain had been at the wickets nearly five hours,
and his partner for three hours and a half. The
brief tea interval had rested and refreshed them
somewhat, but they were both feeling the strain
physically and mentally by reason of their long
spells at the crease. Richmond and young Wain-
wright now were making a neck-and-neck bid for
their centuries. At present the former?s score stood
at ninety-six and Tony?s at ninety-four. Despite
their fatigue, the batmen?s desire to win the coveted
distinction of scoring a century in so important a
match spurred them on to stick to their guns and
keep their backs to the wall.
The express and the fast-medium bowlers were
now doing the trundling. But the sting long since
had gone out of the bowling. They, too, like the
batsmen, were weary and feeling the strain. Runs,
however, were kept down for a time?the score
mounting slowly only with the aid of singles.
Richmond was one ahead of his partner, but Tony
had the bowling. The crowd was held in a breath-
less silence. Excitement was tense and over-
powering. Scarcely an onlooker present but prayed


that each of the plucky batsmen would succeed in
reaching the coveted three figures.
Block ! block ! block '.?then a brace squeaked
through cover-point.
? Block ! block ! ?oh, goodo ! ? shouted Wilfred
excitedly.
A wild lash out to leg, and the two batsmen began
to run. The ball was sailing through the air at a
terrific pace ?but ?alas ! a fieldsman stood eagerly
awaiting it, right on the boundary.
? Will he hold it ? Oh, Wilfred, I . .
People were standing up, eyeing the ball and the
fieldsman anxiously.
? I don?t think the poor chap can see it.
Sun?s bang in his face. See, he?s trying to
shade his eyes with one hand,? said Wilfred
breathlessly.
? Drop it, man ! Drop it ! ? some among the
crowd, in sympathy with the young batsman, were
shouting.
The fieldsman was plainly in difficulties. As the
ball dropped towards him he made a wild lunge
for it. The next moment, however, he was rolling
in agony on the turf. The ball, having passed
through his hands, had dealt him a clean knockout.
Several men hastened over towards the prostrate
fieldsman. When, however, it was discovered that
he was not seriously hurt, a wild and sustained roar
from the crowd denoted an evident appreciation
of the fact that young Wainwright had secured his
century.
? Oh, isn?t it great ? Good old Tony boy ! ?

?Tony himself now took plenty of risks to force the
pace of scoring.?
Chap. XIV, p. 147.


shouted Phyllis, stamping her feet and clapping
her hands with joy.
? Look, there goes old Richy over to congratulate
Tony,? observed Wilfred.
? Good sport, that captain ! ? said Mr. Wain-
wright admiringly. ? He?s giving Tony?s hand a
rare vigorous shake, too.?
Richmond?s action had put the crowd in the best
of humour. Eagerly and anxiously they watched
him now as he took his stand at the wicket to
receive the first ball of the next over.
? Got him ! Beauty ! ? shouted Wilfred. ? Clean
out of the ground ! ?
? A loose ball, that; but the captain made no
bones about giving it its full deserts,? said the
colonel.
Whilst the enthusiastic crowd screamed and
yelled itself hoarse, Tony was observed striding
down the pitch to return the compliment to his
captain.
The next ball Richmond endeavoured to treat
like its predecessor; but he skied it, and the
wicketkeeper, midst tense silence, took and held
on to it. Many of the young Cults? supporters now
flocked on to the edge of the field and, as Richmond
approached them on his way to the pavilion, he
was seized and carried off triumphantly, shoulder
high.
The score now stood at three-twenty-six for six.
None of Tony?s next four partners proved very
successful, and Tony himself now took plenty of
risks to force the pace of scoring. The innings


eventually closed with the score at three-sixty-one,
of which Tony had to his credit a not-out knock of
a hundred and sixteen. Seldom before had scenes
of such wild excitement as now prevailed been seen
on the ground, Tony was carried round the ring.
Hundreds, in turn, took his hands, till his arms
were nearly shaken from their sockets. Wild
cheering and the singing of ?For he?s a jolly good
fellow ? accompanied the triumphal procession.
But the match was not yet finished. The Scot-
chies hoped at least to be able to make a draw
of it. They now required a hundred and fifty-five
to win. It was no very big score to knock up.
But the ordeal to which they had been subjected
for the most part of a day in sweltering heat had
taken a lot of life out of them. This fact was soon
apparent to the spectators. The first three wickets
fell with the score at thirty-five.
? What time do they draw stumps ? ? asked Mr.
Wainwright.
? Six o?clock,? answered Wilfred, ? but six-thirty,
I think, if extra time is necessary to decide the
match.?
?Well, they?ve only got an hour and three-
quarters at most, then. They should be able to
make a draw of it.?
? They don?t look like saving the game,? said
Wilfred, later. ? That?s five out now, isn?t it ?
What?s the score ? ?
? Fifty-eight.?
? Golly ! Jones is whacking them down now for
all he?s worth. Already got three to his credit.?


? Well done ! ? roared the crowd, as the middle
stump of one of the batsmen was uprooted and
hurtled a good thirty yards through the air.
? Surely he?s out, isn?t he ? ? exclaimed Phyllis.
? What?s that man in a white coat signalling to
him for ? ?
? Something wrong with the stump, I guess.
Probably broken. Wants a new one brought
out.?
Wilfred was right. A new stump was brought
on to the field by the next incoming batsman, and
the game was resumed.
? The wicket seems a bit cut up now,? said the
colonel. ? Look at the dust flying ! ?
? Yes, the Scotchies are having a rotten time of
it altogether, what with being tired out, the worn
pitch and the failing light,? answered Wilfred.
? Got everything against them, poor beggars ! ?
? Seventy-three for eight,? the score board
announced at six o?clock.
? They?re playing the extra half-hour,? observed
Wilfred. ? Hullo ! Ninth man out with no addition
to the score.?
? Well fielded, youngster,? said Mr. Wainwright,
as a ball was cleverly stopped on the edge of the
boundary.
?Ah ! Got him ! All over now, and a quarter of
an hour to spare. Total, eighty-five ! Well done,
the Cults ! ? shouted Wilfred gleefully.
? Oh, isn?t it just great ! ? laughed Phyllis.
? What did you win by, Wilfred ? ?
? Let?s see. H?m . . . won by sixty-nine runs.?


? I wonder what Jones?s final analysis was ? ?
mused the colonel.
? Well, he got seven wickets ?for, I should think,
about forty,? Wilfred calculated. ? Isn?t it spiff-
ing ? Good old Jonesey! He didn?t half lash
?em down, their second innings.?
? Oh, here comes Tony ! ? exclaimed Phyllis.
? Well done, Tony ! ? shouted his friends.
? Jolly fine match,? was the reply. ? Old Richy
deserves a gold medal, the way he stuck it out.
Batted nearly six hours. And I?ve never seen
Jones bowl better than he did this afternoon.?
So ended a memorable match. It had been a
close thing, but the ? Invincibles ? were beaten by
sheer doggedness and determination on the part of
their rivals at a time when all seemed lost. The
match was destined to live long in the sporting
history of the Cults, and for Tony Wainwright it
won an undying fame.
Once more that evening the boys were allowed to
join the visiting trio at the ? Royal.? In honour
of Tony?s gallant stand for his school a right royal
dinner was ordered for the party by Mr. Wainwright.
The cricket match, from every angle, was discussed
all over again. Phyllis had never appreciated until
now the real merits of cricket. She now understood
more about it, too, and was able to enter into details
of some of its finer points.
? I did feel sorry,? she said, ? for the poor
Scotchies. After fielding all day in a blazing sun,
to have to bat in a failing light ?it seemed too
bad.?


? Yes, and they must have felt a bit downhearted
to boot,? quoth Wilfred. ? They had thought the
match as good as won last night.?
? Well, it was a good sporting match,? concluded
the colonel. ? And, after all, that is the main thing
in connection with all pastimes and athletics. And
now ?to change the subject for a moment,? he
continued, ? when does the school break up for
the long Christmas vac, Wilfred ? ?
? A week to-day, colonel, I believe,? was the
wondering reply.
? Splendid ! Suits me admirably. As you boys
perhaps know, I have a brother-in-law over in the
far west. Well, he?s kindly invited a party of us
over there for a few weeks. What about you two
boys making the trip with us ? ?
? What! Over to Western Australia ? ?
? Yes.?
Tony and Wilfred were dumbfounded. Glancing
at their father, the two lads tumbled at once to the
truth that he was well in the know of the colonel?s
plan.
?Well, would you care about it ? ? repeated the
colonel.
? Golly ! would we what ? It?s jolly good of you,
Colonel Stafford, to invite us,? replied Tony.
? It?s Mrs. Stafford?s brother?Mr. Wilshire?
whom you have to thank, lad, not me. But, at the
same time, I m not so sure that I should have asked
you to join the party had the Scotchies beaten
you to-day. So it will be a little treat in honour
of a great occasion.?


? Hear, hear ! ? shouted Wilfred tumultuously.
Then laughing, and springing to his feet, he added :
? Gentlemen, raise your glasses to the Victorian
inter-schools? champion batsman, Tony Wain-
wright ! ?
? Tony Wainwright ! Tony Wainwright ! ? re-
sponded the others, as, jumping to their feet also,
in a jovial mock-toast, they clinked and laughingly
drank off the contents of their ? teacups.


CHAPTER XVI
A Trip to the Golden West
A FORTNIGHT later, the Colonel and Mrs.
Stafford, with Reg, Phyllis, Wilfred and Tony,
were all aboard the inter-State steamer Coombala ,
bound for Albany, the nearest western port of call.
The journey proved uneventful, save for a fairly
boisterous tossing in the Bight. But, as this was
the usual experience of most seafarers in those
waters, it came as no surprise. The youthful
element of the party greatly enjoyed the rolling
and the tossing to which the Coombala was sub-
jected. Up and down the length of her decks,
arm in arm they sprinted, in defiance of the roaring,
raging elements. Each one of the merry group
boldly averred over and over again that the motion
of the boat had no ill-effect upon them. Be that
as it may, one and another of the party were given,
from time to time, to breaking aloof from their
friends, and to making for the ship rails. With
what intent ? None asked, and none volunteered
enlightenment ! But, if the youthful quartet
suffered at least no prolonged discomfort inwardly,
quite otherwise was it so far as Mrs. Stafford was
concerned ?to say nothing of the colonel. Mrs.
Stafford, for several days, was confined to the
153 l


narrow limits of her cabin bunk. It was not until
the morning when Albany hoved into view that
Phyllis?s mother ventured on deck. By this time,
however, all of the party were in the gayest of
spirits.
The pretty little harbour town of Albany looked
very gay that morning. Bathed in sunshine, with
lovely stretches of sandy forefronts, and nestling
in a wealth of beautiful trees and verdure, the
picture it presented was a truly enchanting one.
When, finally, the Coombala berthed alongside the
jetty, flower-sellers everywhere held up the dis-
embarking passengers.
? Oh, what gorgeous baskets of flowers, Mum ! ?
murmured Phyllis. ? And what a perfectly deli-
cious scent they have! What are those great
bunches of tiny brown and yellow bells, I wonder ? ?
? Baronia, miss ; sixpence a bunch,? volunteered
an eavesdropping vendor.
? Oh, Mummy, only sixpence a bunch ! Aren?t
they perfectly sweet ? ?
Having procured an assortment of several bunches
of these gorgeous wild-flowers, the Stafford party
made hurried arrangements about their luggage,
and then quickly set off to catch their train, which,
so they were informed, would be waiting to convey
the boat passengers inland.
Throughout the whole of that afternoon, except
for innumerable stoppages and several changes of
trains, the party were borne along to their destina-
tion through the famous forests of gigantic jarrah
and karri trees. Veritable giants were some of


them ?especially the karri ?reaching to nearly
three hundred feet in height, with enormous boles
or trunks. The forests, too, were carpeted with
flowers of every hue and colour imaginable.
? Well, boys, what do you think of the west ? ?
asked the colonel at one stage of the journey.
? Clinking, so far ! ? averred Tony. ? But I
haven?t seen any kangaroos or parrots yet. Perhaps
they don?t get such things over here.?
? My, yes ! ? chuckled Reg?s father. ? Wait
till you get away from the railway, and near some
of the wheatfields. Kangaroos and parrots ! I?m
for tipping that Charlie Wilshire will be glad of
them being thinned out somewhat down in the
Blackwood.?
? Gee, that?s bonny ! ? exclaimed Reg. ? We?ll
do the thinning-out process all right?what say
you, Will, old sport ? ?
? Jove, yes ! ?
At about five-thirty the party were landed at
the little siding where Mr. Wilshire, with a drag
and pair, was waiting to convey them, five miles
farther on, to his homestead. Greetings and intro-
ductions were soon the order of the day. Then
quickly all set off, in the bright sunshine, for
? Walabby,? the home of the Wilshires on the
Blackwood River. After the lapse of three-quarters
of an hour the picturesque homestead hove into
view. Again greetings and introductions?plus
hearty welcomes. What a pleasant scene of anima-
tion it was.
Mr. and Mrs. Wilshire had a large family. There


were, first of all, Peggy and Joan, the eldest?girls
of nineteen and seventeen respectively. Then
followed in turn Bob (sixteen), Dick (fourteen),
Noel (twelve), and two younger children?Jack and
Jill, as they were called. Soon all were seated
heartily round an immense table, and Mr. Wilshire
was kept going for his life carving up four wild
duck placed in a mammoth dish before him. What
a babel of voices there was ! The Wilshires were
homely, hospitable people, and very quickly made
visitors feel at home in their midst.
44 What do you think the boys were asking me
in the train, Charlie ? ? laughed Colonel Stafford.
? They wanted to know if there were any kangaroos
and parrots in these parts ! ?
44 Bless my soul ! Is that so ? ? replied Mr.
Wilshire. ? Why, we were so overrun with kan-
garoos and wallaby that I named the old place
after the latter, lest, in the years to come, I should
forget my old bush friends.?
44 Now, come, Charles ! That?s not quite true, is
it ? ? said Mrs. Wilshire smilingly.
44 Well, it?s at least half the truth, at all events.
The name of our place, 4 Walabby ? ?as you know,
it?s spelt differently from wallaby?represents really
a combination of the marsupial and of old Walbeck
Abbey in England, which we know so well. Of
course we pronounce the word Walabby?not
Wallaby.?
44 Well, that?s very interesting,? chimed in Mrs.
Stafford. 44 I remember, Emily, your telling me
of this long ago, but I had quite forgotten.?


iC At all events, the name should prove sufficient
to reassure your eager young questioners, quoth
Mr. Wilshire, addressing the colonel.
? Yes, by Jove ! And I guess they will not be
long in turning such reassurance to very good
account.?
? Well, I only hope they will not find it too slow
and dull right out here in the bush.?
<� Never fear, Mr. Wilshire,? replied Tony.
? Give me, for one, the good old bush any
day.?
? Ah, that?s the spirit, Tony. Well, you boys
will have to put your heads together and make
your own plans, and then go right ahead. Bob,
I?m afraid, will be needed now and again with the
harvesting. But I?ll see that it won?t be all work
and no play for him. It isn?t every day we get a
family reunion of this sort. How does that suit
you, Bob, lad ? ?
? Jolly well, thanks, father.? Then, turning to
Reg: ?What about to-morrow, you fellows ? ? con-
tinued Bob. ? There?s not much work doing this
Friday and Saturday.?
Reg didn?t hesitate a moment, ? A good old
?roo hunt for me.?
? And so say all of us,? chimed in the rest of the
lads.
? Good, that?s settled then,? quoth Bob.
The large party, having made short shrift of the
wild duck and the rest of the menu, rose from the
table and disbanded. The menfolk proceeded on to
the verandah to enjoy their cigars in peace; the


womenfolk to work and to chatter ninety to the
dozen in the kitchen ; and the youths?whither
awa? ? They had all suddenly vanished?eya-
porated. Truth to tell, they were having a fine
old time all to themselves in the gun-room.


CHAPTER XVII
Amongst the Kangaroos
808 and Dick Wilshire possessed breach-
loading guns of their very own, but at the
moment all the six lads were subjecting to a
critical scrutiny a brand-new single-barrelled
breach-loader which was the prized property of
Noel. His father had presented it to him only
that very day that he might have it in readiness
for the coming of the visitors. Christmas Day
was not until the Monday following.
As the young visitors had brought over with
them their own fire-arms, there was much topic
provided for conversation, and sufficient fire-arms
amongst them to give stimulus to all their critical
faculties.
? Well, you chaps,? quoth Dick at length, ? we
should have a real bon-tosh day of it to-morrow.?
? Crikey, yes! ? agreed his younger brother,
Noel.
? Let?s get off to bed early to-night, shall we ? ?
suggested Bob. ? You fellows (meaning the visi-
tors) must be dog-tired after your long trip, and we
may have a stiff day to-morrow.?
Before the lads retired for the night, however,
all the details of the morrow?s hunt were fully
thrashed out. They were bent on setting out early


in the morning and doing the hunt on rather a
grand scale.
By the way,? asked Bob, ? I suppose you
fellows can ride ? ?
? ufu ' ? re P^ R e g for his companions.
Well, Dad got in an extra mount or two, so
we 11 be all right there. We?ll take the old dog,
too. He?s some dog, I can tell you?fleet-footed as
a greyhound.?
? oh , goodo ! That?ll be fine ! ? quoth Tony.
? There?s another young chap going to join us
to-morrow; a real raw-hide, just over from
England, but a good fellow. I thought we?d be
off for a Too hunt the first day after you arrived,
and so I invited him to join us.?
? What?s his name ? ? asked Wilfred.
? Don Newman.?
? Sounds appropriate for a new chum,? laughed
Tony.
? Well, now, come on; let?s all off to bed?
concluded Bob.
Early next morning Don rode over from his
father?s small selection to ? Walabby.? Soon all
were ready to set off. Strapped to the pommels of
the saddles were a tent, some blankets, chaff for
the horses and, as the boys intended camping out
for a night, a plentiful supply of grub.
The septet was a jolly party. The steeds were
not of the fleetest, but were not to be despised.
Ihe dog, Spot, was a sleek, well-trained creature.
ick impressed the fact upon the new arrivals that
Spot would both ? kill and show.?


? Will he tackle a six-foot boomer ? ? inquired
Tony.
? Yes, rather, if he gets a chance. But some-
times the boomer is one too many for him when at
bay and with his back to a tree. Old Spot hardly
has a chance then. But he?ll keep the old buck
at bay and bark till the huntsmen appear on the
scene.?
? Have you ever seen a boomer at bay, Dick ? ?
asked Don.
? Not exactly a boomer. But Bob has, haven?t
you, Bob ? ?
? Yes, tons of times. The crafty old buck props
himself on his powerful hind legs with his back
against the biggest gum tree available. This
prevents him being tackled from the rear. Then
with his great front claws he paws the air. Woe
betide the dog which goes too near him. The ?too
will seize hold of his antagonist, if possible, and
then, with a powerful hind leg, rip him clean open.?
? By Jove ! ?
? Yes. One poor devil of a dog we had was once
taken out hunting with his collar on. He was a
game ?un, too. After running a boomer to bay,
Nip?that was the old dog?s name ?flew straight
at his throat. The boomer seized hold of his collar,
brought up one of his hind legs and ripped him
from head to tail ?disembowelled him completely,
and then made off into the bush.?
? Gee whiz ! But what would happen if a dog
got a boomer on the run in the open plain where
there were no trees ? ? asked Newman.


? Oh, well, he?d make for a gully or swamp and
plunge into the water. If a dog tackled him then,
he?d get to grips and endeavour to hold him under
the water to drown him. But a single dog will
seldom tackle a boomer in the water. Poor old
Nip once got a boomer at bay in a water-hole.
But even Nip wouldn?t tackle the old buck. He
kept on the bank, running round and round,
trying to frighten the boomer. But the ?roo
wasn?t having any and refused to budge.?
? What happened in the end ? ?
? Oh, my mate shot the poor beggar?the ?too,
that is. It wasn?t very sporting of him; the
boomer deserved a free pass that day.?
By this time the happy hunters were speeding on
their way into the back country in search of their
quarry. No luck came to them that morning,
but near a stream, several miles from home, they
enjoyed an excellent picnic luncheon.
? Think we?ll get any to-day ? ? asked Don of
the huntsman-in-chief.
? Yes, never fear. We?ll have good sport towards
evening, if not sooner. The beggars come out to
feed about five o?clock. After their early morning
breakfast, the ?roos mostly lie up among the rocks
or trees for shade and shelter during the heat of
the day. We?ll see plenty of ?em later, never fear ! ?
Bob?s optimism proved well founded. A couple
of hours after lunch Spot put up a couple of
wallabies. These were successfully shot on the
run. An hour or two later the yap, yap, yap of
the old dog denoted the headlong flight of a ?too.


? I?ll bet he?s got a boomer on the hop ! ? ex-
citedly exclaimed Dick. ? Come on, you fellows,
if you want some fun ! ?
The youthful party dug their heels into their
ponies? flanks and made off at top speed in the
wake of the old dog; pell-mell for a full quarter
of an hour they plunged on through woods and
thickets. By that time, however, the dog was
beyond earshot, so all pulled up short whilst
Bob cooeed through the bush. A half-hour later
they caught sight of the old dog returning, his
nozzle and fangs flecked with froth and blood.
? Guess I?m wrong this time,? quoth Dick.
? ?Twas only a doe, I think. But come on, you
fellows ! ?
Once more the party urged their steeds forward.
They now followed on the heels of Spot, who
trotted along at a good, fast gait in front of them.
The dog led them faithfully a couple of miles over
a mountain ridge, and took them straight to the
kill.
? Yes, you?re right, Dick,? finally said Bob,
dismounting; ? a fine big doe. The dog had headed
her up this hill. ?Roos can?t travel very fast
uphill, you know. Dogs know it, too, and they?ll
keep ?em going up an incline if they can. On a
good decline even old Spot would have little chance
with a ?roo. They can take twenty to thirty yards
at a leap going down a slope.?
Dick and Tony dragged the poor creature to the
base of a small tree. Then, with the assistance of
the others, they hoisted it up into a fork


and marked the spot to enable them to find the
Too later, on their return.
? There?s old Spot again ! ? excitedly shouted
Noel, the youngest of the huntsmen, eager to try
out his gun. ? My, he?s hot on the trail, too !
Hark at him ! ?
? Yes, he?s put up another ! ? chuckled Wilfred.
? Come on, you chaps ! I?ll bet it?s a boomer
this time. Listen to the thump, thump, thump
of his powerful legs ! Come on ! Get a move
on!?
Madly they all tore off once more.
? Old Spot seems more excited this trip,? quoth
Tony. He?s pretty hot on the heels of his quarry,
I guess.?
? What if it?s a boomer at bay ? ? queried Don.
? Will you shoot him, Bob ? ?
? Shoot him, no ! ?
? Why not ? ?
? In sporting circles it?s not done, when the
?roo?s at bay.?
? What will you do, then ? ?
? You?ll see. Come on, buck up, you fellows ! ?
There was no time to waste in talking now.
The ponies were fully extended in the chase;
Spot s excited yelping could be still heard echoing
through the ranges. As the dog and the kangaroo
wheeled around in great circles, the pursuers were
enabled, with an ear to Spot?s excited yelping, to
take numerous short cuts, and so, more or less, to
keep up with them. Ere long the old dog?s harry-
ing yelping cries gave way to some furious,


deep-throated baying ?whoof ! whoof ! whoof !
Some at least of the huntsmen knew exactly what
this meant.
? Hooray! ? excitedly shouted Dick over his
shoulder, ? Spot?s got the old beggar at bay ! ?
? How do you know ? ? panted the new chum,
Don Newman.
? Oh, come on, Newman ! Buck up, and don?t
ask so many questions ! ?
Tearing on again at full speed, it was not long
ere the party caught up with the dog.
? Yes, it?s a boomer all right ! ? gleefully ex-
claimed Tony. ? My, what a fine old chap, too !
Good old Spot! Good old Spotty boy ! ?
The majority of the young huntsmen sat astride
their ponies, which were drawn up near to the dog
and his quarry ?strangely fascinated by the unusual
scene which confronted them. The boomer, well
over six feet in height, stood proudly erect with his
back to a mammoth karri. Spot was keeping the
?roo well occupied by making occasional mad
onslaughts upon him.
? Blimy! ? exclaimed Don in wonderment,
? isn?t he a fine brute ? Spot?s a bit afraid of
him, though. Look, Dick ! See how the old ?roo
claws at him ? ?
? Yes, poor beggar,? sympathetically murmured
Wilfred. ?He keeps an eye on us, too. See how
he keeps darting a frightened look in our direction ?
Poor old boomer ! Seems a shame, doesn?t it ?
eight to one ? ?
? Stars, he nearly had old Spot that time ! ?


chuckled Tony. ? Close shave that, old man !?
addressing the dog.
Spot was still prancing frantically round and
round the ?roo, and sometimes darting in towards
him, awaiting, possibly, a seasonable opportunity
for a dive at his throat. The ?roo was given no
earthly chance of escape, but, with wonderful alert-
ness and agility, he parried and thrust at the dog
in return, and on the whole kept his antagonist
at a pretty safe distance.
? Beauty, isn?t he ? ? cried Bob, in admiration of
the fine buck.
? Let?s watch ?em a while,? said Newman.
? Good as a circus, this. ?Tisn?t every day one can
see a boomer in the ring.?
The dog was a little quieter now, but on the
least sign of a movement on the part of the ?roo
he would commence his capers afresh.
? I say, Bob ! ? shouted Tony, ? what about
putting the poor old beggar out of his misery ? ?
? Garn, no ! ? protested Don. ? Don?t be a
spoil-sport ! ?
? Oh, hang it, yes ! ? cut in Bob. ? I think
we?ve all had enough.?
Bob thereupon rode towards the ?roo and, un-
slinging his stirrup-leather from the saddle, dealt
the gallant old buck a blow on the head with the
stirrup-iron. The dog then closed in upon the
poor dazed beast and had him by the throat.
The struggle was soon over.
With the united effort of all the young hunts-
men the great boomer, after much difficulty, was


hoisted upon the saddle-bow of Bob?s steed and
made fast. Dick then called the dog to heel, and
the party made back to the previous kill. After
collecting the doe and the two wallabies in like
manner, the boys rode to the nearest water-hole
and pitched camp for the night.
? We?ll have some grilled kangaroo steak to-
night, lads,? volunteered Bob cheerily. ? Make up
a good fire, you fellows, while I skin one of these
young wallabies ! ?
At once all set to, some erecting the tent, and a
couple more attending to the fire. Bob was not
long in accomplishing his part of the business?
skinning and dressing the wallaby. The lean fore-
quarters he threw to old Spot.
? There you are, Spotty, old boy ! Good old
dog ! ?
On reaching the camp-fire with the plump hind-
quarters of the wallaby, Bob was met by the
quizzical Don, who asked :
? Why, have his front legs run away ? What?s
happened to ?em, Bob ? ?
? Given the forequarters to the dog.?
? But whatever for ? The breast?s the best part,
isn t it ? ?
? Oh, dry up, Don ! It isn?t a bird, you loony !
Can?t eat the forequarters, except in a stew. Be-
sides, the dog wants his share, doesn?t he ? ?
Whilst answering Don?s questions thus not for
a moment did Bob pause in his task. Having
sliced up neatly the hindquarters of the wallaby,
he extracted from his pocket a small coil of stout


fencing wire. This he dexterously manipulated into
a grid, handles and all, complete. Then, brushing
away a section of the blazing fire and placing two
logs a few inches apart over the red coals, he set
thereon his grid-iron, now well laden with kangaroo
steak.
? By Jove, that smells appetising ! ? presently
quoth Tony, rubbing his middle. ? Hope you?ve
got plenty of it, Bob, old sport ! ?
? Yes, tons for all hands,? cheerily replied the
chef. ? But get me three forked sticks, will you,
Tony ? May as well put the billy on, too, and
serve everything up together?hot.?
A ? conical ? of forked sticks was speedily set
up and the billy-can snugly suspended from the
apex over the flaming section of the camp-fire.
Ten minutes later Bob shouted: ? Tea, you
fellows ?in my overcoat pocket over there ! ?
A small canister of tea was brought to him, and
the chef, tilting the same, deposited two fairish-
sized handfuls of the contents into the billy of
boiling water. He then quickly removed the billy
from the fire and placed it to one side.
Don was very interested in all these various
details. He now suggested that the tea had not
sufficiently boiled, and that, when placed to one
side, the billy should have been covered with a
lid.
? Wrong on both counts, Don, old man. In the
first place, tea is not meant to be stew , you know.
In the second place, by leaving the lid off after
removal from the fire, the tea-leaves almost immedi-


ately sink to the bottom, leaving a perfectly clear
brew, as yon can now see.?
? Righto, you chaps ! All hands to ! ? once more
shouted the chef.
To this the huntsmen needed no second invita-
tion. Having arranged themselves round on
blankets spread on the grass, they now set to upon
the spoils with a right good will.
? Crikey ! ? exclaimed Reg. ? Some spread, eh ?
Worth coming a long way for.?
? Dinkum ! ? quoth Noel.
? Tasted kangaroo steak before, Don ? ? asked
Wilfred of the new chum.
? Yes, we?ve had it once or twice at home?but
not grilled. It?s never tasted so nice as this before.?
Some more tea, Dick, please,? demanded
Tony, extending his pannikin.
Thanks. My, that?s bon-tosh! Any more
steak left, Bob ? ?
? Yes, stacks, old man.?
? Thanks ?that?s tons.?
? Anyone else ? ? inquired the chef.
? Golly, yes ! ? exclaimed all the others in
chorus. Then, as each of them passed over a
large chunk of bread, Bob placed thereon a fresh
supply of the steaming grill, d la mode Australia.
It must have been a good hour later before the
feast came finally to an end. Then, as there was
no washing-up to do, the young huntsmen sat
around the camp-fire to while away a merry interval
before turning in for the night.
Don pulled a mouth-organ from out his pocket.


This proved the one thing he could operate upon
like an expert. After getting him going with the
music, his young companions jumped to their feet
and, in order to aid their digestive organs, danced
merrily round the open fire on the grass ?like
spectres of the night. It was ten o?clock ere the
party turned in under the blankets. Then, having
rolled themselves up snugly, thoroughly weary and
tired, they were soon fast asleep.
For breakfast next morning they finished off the
wallaby, with the sole exception of the tail, which
they were bent on taking home with pleasurable
anticipations of soup to come. By nine o?clock,
having packed up all their gear, including the bulk
of the spoils of the previous day?s hunt, they set
forth upon their triumphant march home. On
reaching ? Walabby,? a wallaby was apportioned
out to Don, who then made tracks to his own
home. So came to an end a memorable hunt, such
as is dear to all boys of back o? beyond.


CHAPTER XVIII
Christmas Day?and the Haunted Pool
CHRISTMAS came, and passed off with most
of the old-world jollifications and associations
usually attached to it in the Old Country. Of
course there an absence of Father Snow and
Jack Frost. The festival occurs in the height of
an Australian mid-summer. During Christmas
dinner, therefore, most of the male members of
the family were accorded the privilege of dining
coatless and vestless. The heat, out of doors, was
intense. Even within the house the thermometer
registered one hundred and five degrees. But it
was a dry, healthy heat. There was none of that
damp, perspirative humidity about it so common
to a warm summer?s day in England.
The early morning saw a well-laden drag set off
on a journey of four miles to the nearest little bush
church. This diminutive building was constructed
almost entirely of the native jarrah wood. Even
the furnishings w r ere all of polished jarrah. The
good priest who officiated at the service had
travelled by sulky and pony a distance of one
hundred and thirty miles in order to give his bush
flock their Christmas communion. He was the
warden of the Williams Bush Brotherhood and,


at the time, was engaged upon a seven weeks? tour
of the bush country. In all, at this service, about
thirty-five people, like the Magi of old, knelt in the
Divine Presence (before a little altar throne) to
offer their hearts and their homage to the Saviour
of the world, and to partake of His spiritual bounty.
The ? Walabby ? party, having returned from
their joyous drive shortly after noon, were very
soon seated at a long dining table, which was well
laden with good Christmas cheer. Despite the heat
of the day, the steaming turkey and other hot
dishes were fully appreciated. Even the plum-
pudding, borne in state to the table enveloped in
flames, met with an enthusiastic reception. That
excitement over, the table was laden with fruit,
grown on the estate. Grapes (like plums), luscious
apricots and figs ?such early fruits were chiefly in
evidence. Followed sweetmeats and crackers.
Very soon young and old were all donning some
fantastic paper headgear, and screaming over the
puns and riddles extracted from the crackers.
There only lacked the snow-covered hedges and
fields without to give to this joyous Christmas
party the atmosphere of a setting typically
English. The hearts of some of the older folk,
at least, were once again in the Walbeck of their
youth. A towering native pine, in the evening, did
good service as a Christmas tree. This was the
especial delight of Jack and Jill, and of a few other
small tots who, with some young neighbouring
friends, were invited up for the evening. Even
Father Christmas was there. He appeared as


though he?d stepped down from the snowy heights.
His scarlet, fur-edged mantle and hood were glis-
tening with tiny snowflakes, which matched well
his flowing snowy beard. His sudden exuberant
descent upon the children seemed to waft into the
heated room something of the wintry atmosphere
of the old world. Again, some hearts were far away.
With the disappearance of this wintry spectre ?who
vanished as suddenly as he had appeared ?there
was presently, in a joyous little dance that followed,
a suggestion of ? A Midsummer Night?s Dream.?
To the onlookers, the frocks and sweet faces of some
of the little visitors were in themselves a dream.
To the youthful dancers . . . need one say more ?
A good waltzer in the possession of youth and
spirits is always in dreamland.
Well, altogether it was a wonderful day and
evening, crammed to the full with pleasant surprises
and good cheer.
? All glory be to God on high,
And to the earth be peace,
Goodwill henceforth from Heav?n to men
Begin and never cease.?
Four days later Don Newman and a friend of his,
Ted Tysick, at Mr. Wilshire?s invitation rode over
to ? Walabby ? to spend a couple of days.
? Well, lads, glad to see you again,? was the
hospitable and cheery greeting of their host. ? I
hope you?ve spent a happy Christmas ? ?
? Yes, thank you, Mr. Wilshire,? replied Don.
? Ted only got home from Perth on Christmas Eve.


But I think he?s made up for lost time since, eh,
Ted ? ?
? You bet your life ! ?
? Let?s see, it?s the Guildford Grammar you go
to, is it not ? ? asked Mr. Wilshire.
? Yes, that?s it, sir. The good old c Gee-gee,?
as we call it. Topping headmaster.?
? Oh, yes, I know him well. Nothing like a good
church school, you know, Ted. The old religion is
the backbone of the country, whether we will or no.
State and secular education are sadly lacking.
Leave the best in a boy untouched. No balance
in it. Why our statesmen don?t see it I can?t
understand. . . . But come in, lads. The other
boys should be knocking about somewhere. They?re
ready for any devilment, I know. Ah, here?s
Dick ! ?
? Hullo, Don and Ted ! ? boisterously shouted
this individual, bursting like a hurricane upon the
visitors on to the verandah. ? How?d you come ? ?
? The old mokes, you know.?
? Bully ! I say, father, I suppose we can have
some of the ponies this morning ? ?
? What ! want to take the lads off already ?
We?ve hardly had time to take stock of them yet.
What will your mother say ? ?
? Oh, she wont mind, Dad. We only want to go
across to the river. We?ll be back in good time for
lunch.?
? All right, my boy ! Go canny, you know ! ?
? Hullo, here?s sis and Phyllis.?
? Going out, Dick ? ? inquired Joan.


CHRISTMAS DAY?THE HAUNTED POOL 175
? Yes, like to come ? Here, Phyllis, let me intro-
duce you to Ted Tysick. You?ve already met Don,
haven?t you ? ?
? Oh, yes. How?d you do, Mr. Tysick ? ?
? Ted for me, please,? smilingly said that indi-
vidual, removing a lighted cigarette from his lips.
This immediately set everyone in good spirits,
and Phyllis, not to be outdone, demanded in return
the use of her own Christian name. Thereafter, all
were fast friends.
? Did you ask me, Dick,? said Joan, u whether
we?d like to join you somewhere ? ?
? Yes. We?re off down to the river.?
? Oh, what fun ! May we go, Dad ? ?
? Oh, yes ?pack off, the whole lot of you? ?good-
naturedly.
? You are a sport, Dad,? grinned Dick, as, hands
in pocket, he surveyed his father admiringly.
? Well, Pm blest ! Rub it in, boy. Nought like
a little soft soap, eh ? Well, run along ! Be back in
good time for lunch.?
Joan delightedly hugged her father, and then,
with Phyllis, tripped off to make preparations for
the outing.
? Good-bye, Mum ! ? shouted Joan a little later,
looking in at the kitchen door.
? Where are you going ? Have the boys come ? ?
? Yes, and we?re all going down to the river.?
? Not to bathe , I hope ? ?a little worriedly.
Joan and Phyllis, who had already been let into
the secret of Dick?s plans for the morning, answered
laughingly, ? No, no, of course not,?


? All right, then ! Where are the boys ? Wait a
moment, and I?ll go out and see them.?
? Good morning, Mrs. WTshire ! ? shouted Don
and Ted, on catching sight of Joan?s mother.
? How?d you do, boys. Jolly to see you again.
Take good care of the tvvo girls, won?t you ? ?
? I guess they?ll be more capable of taking care
of us,? grinned Ted.
? Well, then, if you must be going now, I will not
keep you waiting any longer. Off you go. Lunch
at one o?clock, mind you.?
? All right, Mum,? said Dick, who had joined the
little group. ? I guess we?ll all be ready for it, too.
Good-bye ! ?
The happy party, comprising the two visitors,
the two girls, Dick and Wilfred, having got their
ponies ready, set off at once for the river. Quite
a cavalcade they presented in all. Soon they were
careering wildly away in the direction of a favourite
pool in the river-bed?the ? haunted pool.?
? How does this pool come to be called the
? haunted pool ? ? ? asked Don.
? Oh, I don?t know,? answered Dick. ? But the
blacks are afraid of it. You couldn?t get a black
fellow to go within a mile of it. They say that a
Bunyip, or a ghost, or something haunts the place.?
? Have you ever heard the story in full ? ? asked
Don.
The party were now walking their ponies six
abreast.
? No, only bits of it.?
? Oh, do tell us the story,? begged Phyllis.


? Well,? began Dick, ? once upon a time . .
? Oh, cut that out ! ? laughed Wilfred.
? Well, then ?once there was a white survey party
with some black-fellow guides, camped near to the
edge of the pool. About midnight a frightful blood-
curdling yell was heard, followed by the most eerie
noises you could imagine. Instantly the party?s
horses all broke loose and stampeded into the night.
The black-fellows were terrified, and said they had
seen a big white spirit plunge headlong into the
bottomless depths of the pool. Jabbering, and
nearly out of their senses with fright, they, too,
took to their heels, and were never seen again.?
?Go on, Dick. This is exciting,? said Phyllis,
as Dick paused for breath.
? Well, next morning the white men carefully
examined the bank of the pool, but they discovered
no fresh imprints in the sand other than those made
by some kangaroos which had evidently come down
to water. Then, by means of a floating log, one
of the men shoved himself off into the midst of the
pool to try to fathom its depths with the aid of some
survey lines he had in his pocket. Though he let
down?according to the story ?a good half-mile of
line, he failed to plumb the bottom.?
? Gee whiz ! ? exclaimed Wilfred, ? pretty dan-
gerous for a non-swimmer to bathe there.?
? But go on, Dick,? urged Phyllis. ? What
happened ? ?
? Oh, nothing. The men packed up their gear,
and made off as best they could to the nearest
settlement, and there made some inquiries con-


cerning the history of the place. Then they were
told that long ago, during the earliest days of
settlement, a lonely couple lived in a little log
humpy just above the pool. The man eventually
went mad and tried to murder his wife. The wife
escaped from his clutches and ran for dear life in
the direction of the pool. Arriving at its brink
she hesitated, and her husband caught up with her.
There was a fearful scrimmage. The poor woman?s
cries for help echoed over hill and dale. Finally,
the madman, having succeeded in his purpose,
threw the body of his wife into the water, and then
dived in himself and was drowned.?
? By Jove ! Poor woman ! ? exclaimed Ted.
? Is that the end of the story ? ? asked Don.
? No, not quite. ?Tis said that on each anni-
versary of this double tragedy, at midnight, the
whole dreadful scene is re-enacted ; so that, if the
story is true, it must have been on one of the
anniversaries that the survey party was camping
there.?
? But you don?t believe the story, do you ? ?
asked Phyllis.
? No, of course not. But even to-day we can
never get a black-fellow to go near the haunted
pool.?
? And is there an old humpy above the river
bank ? ? inquired Don.
? Yes, the ruins of one ?and here it is,? pointing
to just beyond a small clump of gum trees.
After the recital of the thrilling tale, the sight of
the old ruins fascinated the visitors of the party.


? And what about the pool ? ? asked Wilfred.
? Is it really unfathomable ? ?
? Well, it?s safe enough for some distance in.
But we?ve never been able yet to fathom its depths
in the centre.?
? Gee whiz ! ?
? Well, come on, or we?ll never get to the pool,?
urged Dick. ? I guess Tony and Reg will be
waiting for us a bit impatiently.?
? They?ll think we?re never coming,? said Phyllis.
Helter-skelter, then, all set forward again, their
one desire now to lose as little time as possible.
Five minutes later the round ?or haunted ?pool lay
shimmering and glistening in the strong sunlight
some little distance ahead of them.
? All! There?s old Reg and Tony,? shouted Dick
to his companions. ? Cooee ! Cooee ! ? he con-
tinued boisterously, making the hillsides reverberate
with the penetrating Australian bush call. The
call was excitedly taken up by the rest of the party
till the hills and dales gave back a veritable medley
of wailing echoes.
Tony and Reg were cooeeing in return with all
their young might. But it was difficult for the
oncoming riders to distinguish their cooees from
the mighty echoes of their own. Another minute,
and the party had dismounted.
? All the gear ready, Reg ? ? asked Dick.
? Yes, all apple-pie.?
? Come on down then, everybody 1 ?


CHAPTER XIX
In Quest of Matron
? O EEN anything ? ? asked Dick.
O ? Yes, tons ! Some whoppers down there.
Thought we?d wait a bit for the rest of you. But
you?ve been a mighty long time coming,? said Reg.
? Whoppers , did you say, Reg ? ? exclaimed his
sister, in surprise. ? What are they ?Bunyips and
. . . and . . . ghosts ? ?
? No, you silly ! ? and all laughed heartily.
? Jolly good of you to wait for us,? said Dick.
? Got a few nooses handy ? ?
? Yes, about a dozen of ?em.?
? Clinking ! We?ve brought loads of bait.?
?By Jingo ! See that old fellow duck in under
that log there ? ? eagerly exclaimed Tony as the
party reached the water?s edge.
The nooses were now distributed all round, also
the bait. The young enthusiasts were hard at work
getting all in readiness for the sport; the nooses
they arranged just below the water?s surface, but
within each reach of the bank ; some small lumps
of meat, which comprised the bait, were placed
alluringly betwixt the water?s edge and the nooses?
quite close up, however, to the latter.
? Keep quite still, everybody,? said Dick, ? and


stand back a step or two, and you?ll see the
fun.?
Five long minutes elapsed. Then, with a nudge
from Reg, ? Caristopher ! Look ! ?
A sudden vigorous tug on the noose followed,
and then, flapping and swishing the surface of the
water with his enormous tail, there appeared, caught
dexterously in the now taut coil of one of Dick?s
nooses, a hefty marron ?a giant species of the fresh-
water gilgie ?somewhat resembling a sea-lobster.
? Oh, what a beauty! ? cried Phyllis. ? Look how
he carls his tail! Mind his nippers, Reg.?
? Well, that?s number one,? said Dick proudly.
?We ought to get a good bag this morning. Mum?s
the word again, you sports.?
Once more all was quiet on the bank ?after Dick
had reset his noose and bait, that is. Soon,
several of the lines were being hauled upon simulta-
neously. Within half an hour a good dozen fine
specimens had been landed.
? Let?s see ! ? reckoned Dick. ? There are eight
of us here. Mum and Dad ?ten ?oh, heavens !
We?ll need to catch at least thirty to have a couple
apiece. Well, come on. Strikes me the blighters have
eased off a bit. I think I?ll try over at the other side.?
Suiting the action to the word, Dick, with Tony
and Reg, moved round to the farther side of the
pool. In the winter-time this would have been
impossible. The river, then, would have been
flowing, and even swelling its banks. But, in mid-
summer it consisted of a series of great isolated
pools. Success immediately crowned the efforts of


Dick and his companions. First of all Tony hauled
up two on one noose ?one of which was entrapped
by a claw only. Both, however, were successfully
landed. Then Dick and Reg, in turn, succeeded in
adding to the bag.
On the far bank some of the others were now
trying a new method. Casting the nooses aside,
they attached the baits to a length of string and
placed them a good two feet in the water. With
one hand they held this string, while with the other
they manipulated a crabbing net.
? Look, there?s one,? whispered Wilfred excitedly.
? Pull on your bait very, very gently, Wilfred,?
said Joan. ? Just ?tice him in towards you a
little ! Now the net. Let it down very gingerly,
w r ell in the rear of him ! Careful! . . . Now!
Quick as you can ! ?
With both hands, and with lightning speed,
Wilfred suddenly scooped the net towards him.
? Bravo, Willie ! ? shouted Joan gleefully. ? Just
look ! You?ve got three at a time.?
? Beat you, Tony,? shouted Don. ? Will?s
hauled up three of the blighters at one go. Pretty
good lucky-dip, eh ? ?
Phyllis was no less active and adept in the sport
now than were the boys?judging by the bulkiness
of her bag lying on the bank.
? I say, Dick,? shouted Wilfred presently. ? It?s
gone twelve o?clock. Hadn?t we better be making
tracks ? ?
? Yes. But wait a mo?. I?ll be with you in a
tick.?


? So said the Irishman,? drawled Wilfred.
? What Irishman ? ? asked Phyllis.
? Oh, there was an Irishman working with a
pickaxe high up and on the extreme edge of a
crumbling wall. His mate shouted from below,
? Hey, coom down, Mike, it?s dinner toime.? c Oh,
all right,? returned Mike, ? Oi?ll be wid ye in a tick ?;
and so he was ?rather sooner than he had expected.?
But Dick suffered no such untoward disaster.
Before many minutes had elapsed the whole party
had assembled once more on the near bank. Tip-
ping out the contents of their bags they proceeded
excitedly to count the spoil.
? Not a bad morning?s work,? quoth Tony.
? How many did you say, Dick ? ?
? Thirty-seven big ones, and a few smaller ones.
Let?s throw some of these small ones back again,
shall we ? They?re not much use.?
? Righto,? said Reg. ? We?ve got tons.?
Whilst Dick was busily engaged sorting out the
young marron to restore them to the pool, the other
lads were seeing to the ponies, to have all in readi-
ness for the home journey. ?Twas not long before
the little cavalcade set forth on its return home-
ward.
? Clinking sport, that,? quoth Wilfred, as the
ponies scrambled up the steep banks and threaded
their way slowly through the thick, tangled mass of
undergrowth.
? Yes. We must have another go at ?em before
the hols, are over,? agreed Tony.
? Yes, you bet your life ! ? said Don.


Punctually on the stroke of one, by the old grand-
father clock in the hall at ? Walabby,? the eight
tired young sports entered the comfortable bungalow
homestead of the Wilshires for luncheon.
? Hullo ! By Jove, what a tribe ! ? laughed
Colonel Stafford, whom the young bloods met in
the large hall. ? Had good sport ? ?
? Yes, rather,? quoth Reg, pointing to the bag
of bulky proportions at his feet.
? Oh, Dick ! ? said Mrs. Wilshire, catching sight
of the sodden-looking bag of marron in the hall,
? do take those nasty, smelly things into the kitchen.
Run along, dear ! And you others, are you all ready
for lunch ? ?
? Won?t be a moment ? ?in a chorus from them
all.
? Run along then, quickly ! Dinner?s just being
served up.?
Five minutes later the whole tribe trooped into
the dining-room, where their elders awaited them.
? Guess you didn?t bargain for such an army of
young hungry folk as this, Charles ? ? said Mrs.
Stafford laughingly.
? Oh, yes. The more the merrier. Christmas
comes but once a year, you know, Jane. Well, boys,
had a good morning?s sport ? Guess you are ready
for something to eat, eh, what ? ?
? Yes, ripping sport, father,? said Dick, ? and
we?re ready for anything.?
? Come along, then, let?s all sit down ! You say
grace, Jill, will you ? Ah, that?s right. Now
then . . . Let?s see what you can do.?


? Where?s old Bob, uncle ? ? inquired Tony.
? Oh, he?ll be here presently. Been doing a bit
of hay-carting in the back paddock this morning.?
Ten minutes later, true enough, Bob took his
place at the table,
? Jove ! ? he said. ? This is good. Don?t get
kangaroo-tail soup every day in England, Don, old
sport.?
? No. We feed on the fat of the land there?not
on the sinews of war.?
? Ha, ha ! ? exploded the colonel, ? that?s a good
one for you, Bob. Very neatly put, Don. Why,
of course, the kangaroo?s tail is enveloped in sinews,
is it not ? ?
? Why, yes,? said Ted. ?We often make violin
strings of them. And very good substitutes for
catgut they are, too.?
? But, Don, old sport,? pursued Bob. ? What
do you mean by the fat of the land ? ?
? Why, pheasants and partridges?and jugged
hare, and . . .?
? Yes, I guess ! For those who can get them.?
? You?re right there, Bob,? was the reply. ? I?m
afraid I had my portion of the sleek things. Kan-
garoo?s a sight better than rabbit , I can tell you,
and since our beano in the bush the other day I
guess I?ll never fight shy of kangaroo.?
That?s right, Don, my boy,? said Mr. Wilshire.
? When you?re in Rome, you know, do as Rome
does. Why, I declare, you?ll be a full-blown bush-
man ere long.?
By this time a mammoth parrot pie, which had


been brought on to the table, was being made short
w'ork of.
? And how did you girls enjoy yourselves this
morning ? ? asked Mrs. Wilshire.
? Oh, fine, thanks, auntie,? replied Phyllis.
? Dick told us an immensely interesting story about
the haunted pool and the old humpy where the
madman lived.?
? Goodness gracious, child ! And were you not
afraid afterwards to go down to the haunted pool ? ?
? No, not a bit, auntie. But I don?t think I
should like to go down there after dark.?
? Oh, Phyllis ! ? pouted Tony. ? I used to think
you were a second Joan of Arc. You don?t mean
to say . . .?
? But you should have heard Dick tell the story
of the haunted pool,? laughed Phyllis. ? I think
he put in all the most gruesome details he could
think of.?
? Dick, for shame ! ? said his mother admonish-
ingly ?while Phyllis kicked his foot under the table,
and both laughed heartily.
? Phyllis, I believe you?re only pretending, after
all,? declared Tony.
? Now, Wilfred, what about some more pie ? ?
said the hostess.
? No thanks, Aunt Emily.?
? Tony ? ?
? No thanks.?
? Anyone else ? ?
? Yes please, mum ! ? said Bob, eagerly.
? Who?s been doing the shooting ? ? asked Ted.


? See if you can guess ? ?
? Bob ? ?
? No.?
? One of the farm-hands ? ?
? No.?
? Afraid I must give it up,? laughed Ted.
? Why, who else, of course, but the best shot in
his old regiment?Colonel Stafford of the Punjabs,
D.5.0., M.C., and a hundred bars,? quoth Mr.
Wilshire with mock ceremony.
In response to this, of course, there was no excuse
but for the one so gallantly referred to, to rise and
bow. This Colonel Stafford proceeded to do, much
to the intense glee of all.
But fancy Father shooting parrots ! ? exclaimed
Phyllis. ? Wonders will never cease.?
Yes, and he got them in double quick time, too,?
declared Mrs. Wilshire. ?He wasn?t out above an
hour getting all I wanted for this pie.?
Now, now, Emily ! Don?t be too hard on me,
please ! There were just millions of twenty-eights
in the wheat paddock. Little Jack here could have
shot double the quantity I did, with one eye
bandaged.? }
Golly! ? exclaimed Dick, ? I think I?ll take a
bag full of em back to the Grammar with me after
the hols. But I guess the cook there wouldn?t
know what to do with them. Jove, though !
Wouldn?t some of the townies open their eyes, and
lick their chops ? ?
? e , ar ' ? exclaimed his horrified mother,
with emphasis. What horrid expressions you do


use. Strikes me your school is wrongly named the
Grammar School. Where does he pick up such
horrid expressions, Ted ? ?
? Oh, that?s a very easy accomplishment at any
public school, I can assure you, Mrs. Wilshire.
But Dick?s only gamming.?
? Buck up, Bob,? said the imperturbable Dick,
�C we?ve an appointment at two o clock.
? A whatta ? ?
? An A-P-P-O-I-N-T-M-E-N-T.?
�� Ha ! Bless my soul! ? roared the colonel.
�� What?s the world coming to, Charlie ? Sounds
as though Dicky here were a business factotum
somewhat pressed for time.?
�� Well, Dad, so we are. Some great business on
this afternoon,? smiled Dick, �� and we mustn?t be
late.?
�� Oh, by the way ! ? suddenly exclaimed Mr.
Wilshire, addressing Don and Ted, �� your respective
parents got my note all right, did they ? ?
�� You mean about our staying for the night,
Mr. Wilshire ? ? asked Ted.
Mr. Wilshire nodded.
�� Oh, yes, thank you. I can stay all right, but I
believe Don said he would have to return this
afternoon.?
�� Oh, what bad luck, Don ! ?
�� Yes, it is. But father needs my pony. He also
wants all hands to work at present. I should love
to have been able to stay.?
�� Too bad. Well, you?ll have to try and manage
it another time, then. But it?s all right for you, Ted ? ?


? Yes, thank you ?if it?s not too . .
? Oh, bully ! ? roared Dick, interrupting Ted?s
reply. Joan, too, clapped her hands, and with high
glee showed her appreciation of the welcome news.
? Well, that?s good,? said Mr. Wilshire, as soon
as it was possible for him to get a word in edgeways.
? But, as you?ve all to-morrow in front of you, I
think you?d best take things easy to-day and rest
yourselves and the ponies a little.?
? All right, Dad ! ? acquiesced Dick, a trifle
crestfallen. ? We?ll have a good old wongy instead.
But may we just get a few more parrots ? I think
Don would like to take some home with him.
Then there?ll be a good moon to-night, Dad. I
suppose we may go out just for a bit in the
evening ? ?
? Well, yes, of course. But just take things a
little easy.?


CHAPTER XX
Don?s Story: Parrot Shooting and Fisticuffs
ABOUT an hour later all the young sports who
had comprised the morning?s outing were
assembled out of doors under the shade of a wide-
spreading red gum.
? Pity you have to get back home to-day, Don,?
sympathized Dick.
? Yes, rotten luck.?
? What?s it really like in the Old Country, Don ? ?
asked Tony. ? You were talking of pheasants
and things at lunch-time. Any good sport over
there ? ?
?Well, yes ?tons of it ?fox and deer hunting,
chiefly.?
? Ever had any ? ?
?Me ? No ! Nearly all the country belongs to
rich landowners, and they get most of the fun.
There?s precious little in the way of hunting for the
poorer classes.?
? But there are tons of rabbits ! ?
? Rabbits, yes. But all the game?s preserved.
Sometimes there?s a bit of poaching. If you go
almost anywhere in the country you see big painted
notices up in nearly every little field you pass :
c Trespassers will be prosecuted.? ?


? Good heavens ! ?
? Why, even if yon want to have an innocent
little picnic in the country you have to get per-
mission beforehand from a tenant or landlord or
something ?unless, of course, you sidetrack on to
some dirty old common. It?s the same if you
want to go camping?in most places.?
? What do the people do, then ? ? asked Dick.
? Oh, well, there?s football, cricket and whippet-
racing. But even then, where I was, it was difficult
to get a ground to play on. They?re mostly taken
up*
? But there are some fine big towns and cities,
zoos, museums and churches, and all that sort of
thing, aren?t there ? ? pursued an eager questioner.
? London must be just spiffing. Fancy ?more
people there than there are in the whole of
Australia, even though Australia?s a continent !
I?ve read a lot about London.?
? I haven?t been to London,? confessed Don.
? People don?t seem to travel about much in
England. I lived up in the North, where most of
the big ships are built, and where the coal comes
from. It?s very interesting working in some of
the great shipyards, and seeing all the wonderful
machinery. I once saw a steam hammer set up
in a great steel framework. It weighed several
tons. When the great hammer was released it
could flatten out a bar of iron inches thick with
a single blow. But a man once put his gold watch
under it. So accurate was the timing of the
mechanism of the hammer that, when it descended


with all the force of its several tons weight, it
barely cracked the glass of the watch.?
? By golly ! ? exclaimed Wilfred.
? Then there?s another machine which punches
holes for rivets. It goes through a plate of inch
steel for all the world as though it were dough.
Another machine cuts these plates into shape as
though they were cardboard. Then there?s a
hydraulic riveting machine. Two plates are placed
side by side, a white-hot rivet is placed through
holes in each, then the great jaws of the hydraulic
riveter take hold of the inch-thick rivet and, in
a second, the job is finished, each end of the rivet
being beautifully moulded and finished off ?all in
a second.?
? Jove, it must be great ! ? said Dick.
? Oh, yes. But you jolly soon get tired of it, I
can tell you, what with the noise, the soot and the
smoke.?
? Didn?t you like living up there ? ?
? I didn?t mind at the time, but I wouldn?t go
back and live under the same conditions again if
you paid me. The workers? houses where I was
were not really fit to live in. I can?t understand
now how ever father stuck it so long as he did.
No gardens ?
? No gardens, did you say ? ?
? Gardens? no, nor back-yards either. No water
laid on, except one tap at the back door, which
had to serve the whole tenement of about six
families. Then you could never have a bath.?
? Never have a bath ! Why not ? ?


? No bathrooms.?
? Golly ! Never heard of such a thing ! ?
? What did you do, then ? ?
? Why, had to have a tub, of course ?in the
front-room, the only place where there was a fire.
First you had to go down on your rockers on the
floor and wash your head and neck. Then you?d
have to stand up in the tub to sponge your body.
Then, after having applied the towel, you?d have
to sit down on a stool to wash your feet. We could
never afford the firing for a bath oftener than once
a week.?
? Great Scott! I never thought England was
like that ! ? exclaimed Tony.
? Well, it?s not like that everywhere. There are
fine parks and gardens in most cities. But printed
notices everywhere warn you to ? Keep off the
grass.? Then there are wonderful buildings in the
great cities, and fine wide streets. But if you
stand on a corner pavement more than a minute
or so a big burly copper will come along and say,
? Move on, please ! ? ?
Despite their astonishment, some of Don?s
listeners could not refrain from a little chuckle at
his expense. Don was so very serious in his descrip-
tions of the restrictions imposed on one?s liberties
in the Old Country.
? But, anyway,? said Tony at length, ? I?d
simply love to be able to look over some of the
magnificent old churches and cathedrals, wouldn?t
you, Dick ? ?
? Yes, rather ! ?


? But you?d have to pay,? was Don?s serious
comment.
? What ? Pay to go into the churches ?? ?
incredulously.
? No, you?d be allowed to go into them?that is,
when they were not locked. And you?d be allowed
to attend a service. But in many churches there
are only a few places where you?d be allowed to sit.?
? How?s that ? ?
? They let the pews out to the richer folk.?
? Stars ! Seems incredible ! ?
? If you wanted just to see over some of the big
cathedrals, it is true that they would allow you
inside. But most of the ancient and most historic
parts are shut off from the public by heavy iron
gates. If you wanted to go beyond those gates
you would have to pay a fee, and tip the verger as
well.?
? Tip the what ? ? asked Phyllis.
? The verger ?the man in charge.?
? Well, England seems a funny sort of place if
that?s what it?s like. The story-books don?t tell
you all this sort of thing,? demurred Wilfred.
? No, I guess not. The story-books are written
for those who can afford to buy them. England?s a
jolly fine place ?the best place in the whole world,
I think?if you?ve got a little cash. But the
bottom dog, the down-and-outer ?the real working-
class man, that is?well, he has a rotten time of it,
I can tell you, compared to his lot here. But he
got so used to it that often he doesn?t realize it,
and seldom complains.?


? Poor old Don ! ? exclaimed Tony, in deepest
sympathy with his new friend, ? I guess you?ve
been through the mill. Well, never mind, old
sport; the tide?s turned, and I believe you?ve got
as nice a little home now as anyone could wish for.
Some day, perhaps, you will be able to visit old
England again and see everything through different
spectacles.?
?By Jove, yes ! We?ve never ceased to thank
God we came out here. But I?d like to grow really
rich some day and be able to have a jolly good
fling in the Old Country. By Jove, I wouldn?t half
lay it on ! ?
Phyllis and Reg, too, were all sympathy during
Don?s recital of his experiences in the old land.
So intent were these two in Don?s story that they
had scarcely opened their lips. But now Reg
suddenly broke his long silence?broke it with a
vengeance.
? What lazy, carking, good-for-nothing fellows
you all are ! ? he exclaimed, jumping up with a
jerk and doing a few capers in a circle round his
friends. ? Are we going to waste the whole of
this blessed afternoon ? Get up, you lazy beggars,
and let?s do something ! We?re in a free country
now, and all the bloomin? world?s in front of us.
We can go anywhere, do anything, and say ? 800 ! ?
to the wealthiest squatter in the land. Come on,
you fellows ! What?s the use of having such
privileges if we don?t turn them to good account ? ?
? Well, what?ll we do ? ? asked Wilfred of Dick.
? We?re in your hands, Dick, old sport.?


? What about getting a few more parrots, then ?
You?d like some to take home with you, Don ? ?
? Yes, rather ! ?
? Come along, then ! Come on, you fellows ! ?
? I didn?t bring my gun over,? demurred Don.
? Oh, we?ve got plenty of guns and ammuni-
tion.?
? Righto, then ! ?
? I don?t think Phyllis and I will go with you,?
demurred Joan.
? Why not, Joan ? ?
? Well,? was the reply, ? I don?t think Phyllis
would care to, would you, Phyllis ? ? Phyllis
shook her head. ? And I, though I like parrots in
pies all right, I simply hate to see the poor things
shot.?
? All right, then,? said Dick. ? Tell Mum, if
she wants to know where we?ve got to, that we
won?t be going far?only just over into the next
wheat paddock.?
? Very well.?
? Now then, wait a mo?, you fellows, while I
run in and get the guns and cartridges. Won?t be
more than two shakes of a lamb?s tail.?
Ten minutes later the six boys set off.
? I guess we won?t see many parrots at this time
o? day,? said Dick ; ? they mostly sleep in the top
of the tall gums during the heat of the afternoon.
A couple of hours later there?ll be flocks of them
down in the wheat paddock. But the best time of
all is in the early morning. The wheatfields are
alive with them then. I once got six at a shot.?


Dick proved right about the afternoon habits of
the birds. The boys walked round and round the
paddocks, but for ever so long neither saw nor
heard a single ? twenty-eight.? Dick then com-
menced whistling, in mimic, the call of the beautiful
green-and-yellow-plumaged birds they were seek-
ing. It was quite futile searching for them in the
green tops of the lofty gums with the aid of the
eye alone. Nature had endowed the ? twenty-
eights ? with a plumage so similar in hue to the
foliage of the trees which they commonly inhabited
that it afforded them an almost unfailing pro-
tection from prying eyes below. But, unfortun-
ately for the parrots, Nature had not endowed
them with an instinct sufficiently keen to afford
them protection from the wiles and the base
duplicities of man. Consequently, as Dick persevered
in his mimic whistling of the bird?s call, one after
another of the ? twenty-eights,? aroused from
their afternoon siesta, responded to the familiar
sound.
This w r as all that was needed by the huntsmen
to enable them to locate the particular trees which
the birds inhabited. With eagerness they sur-
rounded one immense red gum. Then presently,
by means of repeated mimic calls, they were
enabled to spot their prey.
? There he is ! ? shouted Wilfred. ? Look, Reg !
See him ? Right over there to the left of that big
fork. See, he?s strutting about amongst that clump
of leaves.?
? Yes, now I spot him,? replied Reg. ? There?ll


probably be a whole host of ?em in this big gum.
Don, you stand by with your gun cocked and let
drive at the mob as they fly out ! Are you ready ? ?
? Yes, fire aw r ay ! See if you can bring that one
down. I?ll be ready for the others.?
Bang !
? Got him ! ? gleefully shouted Tony.
Bang! This time it was Don letting drive.
Two more birds dropped, one of which, being only
wounded, was screeching wildly.
All the young huntsmen except Don and Tony
were now careering away in pursuit of the mob of
birds which had escaped. Don, however, bounded
after the wounded parrot. Seizing it, he began
cruelly tapping it with a stick in order to make it
screech the more.
? Put an end to him, Don,? pleaded Tony.
?No fear! He?ll call his mates back again.
We?ll get bags of ?em that way.?
?Go on, man ! Don?t be so darned cruel!
Finish him off ! ?
? No, I won?t ! ?
? Well, if you won?t, I shall! ? defiantly answered
Tony, taking a stride towards Don and the bird.
? Let him alone, Wainwright ! ?
Tony took no notice. With a stout stick in one
hand, he went to pick up the still screeching parrot.
Then Don, rushing forward, stood betwixt his
prize and Tony. ?Itis my bird !? he cried. ? I
shot him ! You just leave him alone, Wainwright !
Don?t be so bally squeamish ! Anyone would think
you?d never been parrot shooting before. Why,


everyone tries at first to wing a bird just to make
him act as a caller to his mates.?
? I don?t care what you or anyone else may do. Are
you going to put the poor devil out of its misery ? ?
?No, of course not.?
? Well, take that , then ?and that ?and that ! ?
?landing some terrific blows on Don?s jaw. ? See
how you like it! ?
Don was so taken aback by the unexpectedness
of the assault that he tumbled to the ground. In
falling he tripped over his gun, which he had
reloaded. An explosion followed. Fortunately the
charge of shot went wide of the two boys. Tony
then, seizing his opportunity, quickly and humanely
put an end to the agony of the screeching bird.
Don, however, jumped wildly to his feet. With an
oath on his lips he lunged a terrific blow at Tony?s
jaw, and a fierce hand-to-hand scuffle ensued.
In the meantime Reg and Wilfred, puzzled by
the report of Don?s gun, had stopped in their
pursuit of the birds, and now stood listening in
strained attention.
? Say, Reg, must be something wrong over
there! ? exclaimed Wilfred, indicating the tree
they had recently quitted. ? Let?s go back ! ?
? By Jove, I declare, those two fools are at it
with their fists ! ? was the reply. ? Whatever can
have happened ? ?
The two boys bounded towards the scene of the
conflict, and quickly separated the combatants.
? What the deuce is the matter with you two
asses ? ? demanded Wilfred.


Don and Tony, however, were sullenly silent.
Neither would offer an explanation. Instead, like
two bull-dogs, they continued maliciously to eye
one another.
? What the devil?s wrong with you, Tony ? ?
asked Reg.
? Ask him ! ? ?pointing to Don.
? Well, Don, what?s the trouble ? ?
? Oh, shut your jaw, Stafford ! What business
is it of yours, anyway ? ?
Reg was more than taken aback. He grew
furious. This, from Don, was more than he could
stomach.
? I guess you?d better clear off home,? he de-
manded, ?if you can?t be civil. At all events, this
is an end to our sport. Consider yourself lucky
that gun did no harm. Come along, Wilf and
Tony ; we?d better be making tracks for home.?
Picking up his cousin?s gun, Reg, with the two
Wainwrights, commenced the homeward trek,
leaving Don and the two birds he had shot in the
vicinity of the gum tree. For the time being,
despite the curiosity of Reg and Willie, no further
reference to the incident was made. Tony did not
feel disposed to chirp on what he considered his
former friend?s cruelty, and so the matter was
dropped.
A half-hour later Don called for his pony and,
without making any adieux, rode homeward alone.
Such was his late companions? code of honour
that no allusion was made to the incident at
? Walabby,? except that Reg, on an inquiry by


Dick and his mates as to the whereabouts of Don,
told them simply just what he knew. So the
matter ended. Amongst the lads themselves, how-
ever, a feeling of uneasiness prevailed. Even
though, during teatime, they endeavoured to
feign their usual high spirits, later they made
themselves scarce and spent a miserable two hours
until summoned for the evening meal.


CHAPTER XXI
A Prip to Perth
THE following Monday was a day to which
the visitors from Victoria were all keenly
looking forward. Mr. Wilshire was taking them
for a trip by car to Perth, where they were to
put up for a few days at the Hotel Esplanade.
The morning of the eagerly anticipated day at
length came round. After an early breakfast,
Mr. Wilshire?s big Daimler drew up at the front
steps of the homestead. Some hampers and rugs
were first packed into the car, and then there
squeezed into it Mr. Wilshire, at the driving wheel,
with Colonel Stafford beside him, and, in the
rear seats, Mrs. Stafford, Phyllis, Reg, Wilfred
and Tony.
? What a load of us ! ? exclaimed Mrs. Stafford.
? Are you sure the springs will support such a
tribe, Charlie ? ?
? Yes, double the number,? laughed her brother.
? Now then ?all aboard ? ?
? Yes, I think so,? answered the colonel.
To the fluttering of handkerchiefs and the inter-
changing of adieux, the car finally moved off
smoothly and swiftly on its long journey of between
two and three hundred miles to the metropolis.


It was a heavenly day ?as, indeed, are most
summer days in Australia. Nothing untoward
happened on the journey. At midday a picnic
lunch was partaken of by the bush roadside.
After another stop a few hours later for tea, Perth
was safely reached well before dark. The party
was in good time at the ? Esplanade ? for a
sumptuous dinner. Mr. Wilshire having phoned
directions through to the hotel, the travellers
found that a large central table in the dining-hall
had been allotted them. Hence all were enabled
to sit at the one table and enjoy each other?s
company to the full.
? Why, I declare,? exclaimed Phyllis, dismayed,
? nearly everyone is in evening dress ! ?
Why, of course, my dear,? said her mother.
? , But tJl ey will see we?ve come a long journey, and
will excuse us for once.?
? H� w will they know we?ve come a long
journey ? ? asked Tony uneasily.
. Instinctively. A city-bred lady or gentleman
is very quick in detecting anyone in from the
country. They?ll see we are new arrivals, and will
probably have made inquiries concerning us long
ere this.? 8
? Then they?ll look down on us as country
bumpkins,? said Reg, smiling. 7
Oh, no, not at all! ? laughed his mother,
ighly amused. ? Australia?s a democratic country.
Maybe they?ll envy us our freedom from con-
ventionality.
Mrs. Stafford proved correct. After the long


seven-course dinner had drawn to its close she,
with the two adults of the party, very quickly got
into converse with some of the hotel s guests.
Then the latter?s envy of the lot of the comfortable
country-dweller in general was amply fully
acknowledged. It transpired that Mr. Wilshire
was acquainted with some of the occupants of the
hotel. Introductions had followed, and ere long
the country visitors were able to feel that after all
they were not entirely among strangers. By nine
o?clock, however, Mrs. Stafford, leaving the two
menfolk in the genial company of friends, betook
herself and her four youthful charges off to bed.
The long day?s drive had thoroughly tired them
out. They were, therefore, not at all reluctant to
retire for the night.
After breakfast the following morning the party
made its exit on to the great balcony which over-
looked the Swan River, with its wide, gleaming
expanse of water. Even at so early a period of
the day the shimmering white sails of numberless
yachts and small craft were everywhere to be seen
skimming away over the water?s surface.
? Oh, Mummy, isn?t it just beautiful ? ? gasped
Phyllis, on first catching sight of the lovely pano-
rama. ?Is this the Swanee River of the old
darkies? song ? ?
?No, no! That?s a Yankee song, my dear.
The 4 Swanee Ribber ? of the 4 Old Folks at Home
was a favourite theme of the great American folk-
song writer, Stephen Foster.? Then, turning to
her brother, Mrs. Stafford asked : 44 What just is


the history, Charlie, of this exquisite river ? I
never before realized that it was so expansive.?
? Oh, I believe it was Captain James Stirling,
in H.M.S. Success , somewhere about 1827, who
first navigated the Swan. But Vlaming, a Dutch-
man before him, had discovered it, and named it
? Swaenerevier,? because of a species of black swan
he found here. Captain Stirling, however, was so
charmed with what he saw, and Fraser, a botanist
who accompanied him, gave such a glowing account
of the beauties of the river, that Governor Darling,
of Sydney, sent the captain home to England to
acquaint British people of the value of his dis-
coveries in order to induce settlement in the
neighbourhood.?
? Just fancy?only about a hundred years ago ! ?
mused Mrs. Stafford. ? And what a beautiful city
Perth is to-day ! ?
? Yes. Stirling arrived back here on June Ist,
1829, in the Parmelia , with fifty-five passengers.
Those were the first settlers to reside on these
shores, and Stirling himself was appointed Governor
of this little community.?
? How jolly interesting! ? exclaimed Tony.
u Lucky devils, these ancient voyagers, to be the
founders of mighty States ! ?
? Well, they had a pretty rotten time of it at
first, what with lack of provisions and the blood-
lust of the aborigines to contend with. This, then ,
was all wild, rugged country ? hush ?with not a
single dwelling of any kind, save the rude huts of
the natives, between here and Albany.?


? Were there dwellings in Albany at that time ? ?
asked Reg.
? Yes, of a kind. Major Lockyer had been sent
by Governor Darling in 1827 to occupy King
George?s Sound ?or Albany, as it is now called.
But come ; I don?t think we should waste all the
morning. What about taking the ferry over to
South Perth, on the far shores of the river, and
visiting the Zoological Gardens ? ?
? Oh, yes, do , uncle! ? begged Phyllis de-
lightedly.
? Come along, then. We may be able to catch
sight of some of those black swans from which this
river derived its name.?
It was not long ere the party, having boarded the
South Perth ferry, were steering serenely and
placidly over the smooth expanse of water. From
shore to shore seemed a distance of nearly two
miles.
? Oh, isn?t it just heavenly ? ? declared Phyllis.
? Yes, dinkum ! ? agreed her brother. ? But
look, Phil! Look over yonder !? he continued,
pointing to a little craft from which a little girl
was happily engaged throwing some crusts of
bread to some large black swans.
? Oh, aren?t they darlings ? I do wish the ferry
would steer a little closer to them ! ?
? I say, Reg ! ? shouted Tony from the other
side of the ferry, ? Phyllis ! Come quickly!
Hurry up ! ?
Reg and Phyllis bounded over to join Tony and
Wilfred. There, quite near to the ferry, was quite


a large group of stately black swans, with some
young cygnets ducking and diving about among
them in lively fashion.
? Oh, how perfectly lovely! ? gasped Phyllis.
? I?ve never seen black swans before, have you,
Tony ? ?
? No, I don?t think so. But I?ve plenty of old
W.A. stamps with the black swan on them. Dad
said they?ll be valuable some day.?
? Well, what are you gossiping about ? ? asked
Mr. Wilshire, who joined the group at that moment.
?We were admiring some of those graceful
swans,? said Phyllis. ? But we?ve passed them
now.?
? Well, then, just take a look at Perth instead
for a moment. See that building with a square-
shaped turret ? That is the old Town Hall, as it
is called. It was built many years ago by the old
convicts. There are many people who want such
a reminder of so unhappy a past demolished and
effaced from the city. Others, however, regard it
as historical and are bent on preserving it to
posterity. To the right of the Town Hall is St.
George?s Anglican Cathedral. It also is a land-
mark. We must try and see the interior of the
cathedral before we return south. Now, if you
look in the other direction, right over there to the
left, you will see another old historical landmark.
That is the old convict barracks. And over beyond
that again are the new Houses of Parliament.
Then farther round still to the left is the mag-
nificent Kings? Park, comprising more than a


thousand acres of parkland. It borders right along
the water?s edge for miles. You see Mount Eliza
just over there, above the Narrows ? That?s a
portion of it.?
? Isn?t it just ripping ? ? exclaimed Wilfred. ? I
never knew before that Australia anywhere could
boast of a river so scrumptious. Just look at all
the yachts, now ! ?
? Yes. But you want to see them after the
young city folks? office hours,? returned his uncle ;
? or, better still, of a Saturday afternoon, when
generally there are yachting competitions. Then
you would see them at their best ?scores of them.?
? Oh, here we are ! Is this South Perth ? ?
asked Phyllis, as the ferry slowed down and was
thug-thugging its way slowly to the landing-stage.
? Yes, this is South Perth.?
A longish but pleasant walk after quitting the
ferry brought the party to the Zoo. There, for a
good two hours, a happy and interesting time was
spent.
? Now, what shall we do ? ? asked their guide;
? have lunch here, or get back to the hotel and go
for a motor spin through Kings? Park this after-
noon ? ?
? The motor spin every time for me ! ? quoth
Reg.
? What say you, Mary ? ? asked her brother.
? Oh, let the kiddies decide.?
? Well, I think they?ve decided already. So
come along, all; we?ll just be able to get back to
the hotel in time for lunch.?


In the afternoon Kings? Park was seen at its
very best. The beautiful walks and gardens were
a joy to behold, while, a good half-mile in from the
entrance gates, the more rugged and natural forma-
tion was carpeted with wild flowers of every hue
and colour. From certain points along the drive
the party were able to look sheer down from the
mount on to the broad expanse of dazzling blue
river, and catch ever-changing vistas of the city
beyond. When opposite the Narrows they dis-
covered that South Perth was quite close to them
again ; but beyond the Narrows ?another great
sheet of blue water, as far as the eye could
see. The big Daimler chugged its way slowly
on, till finally, after a lengthy drive, the exit
gates at the farther extremity of the park were
encountered.
? I think now,? suggested the driver, ? I?ll put
her into top gear and accelerate into Fremantle.
We can have a look over the harbour, have tea
there, and get back to Perth in good time for
dinner.?
These suggestions were duly acted upon, and it
was a tired though thoroughly happy party that
ultimately found its way back to the hotel in the
evening.
On the following afternoon the visitors wended
their way to the cathedral. On arrival there they
found that, of all things, a funeral service was in
progress.
? What?ll we do ? Shall we go in ? ? asked Mr.
Wilshire.


? Yes, I think so,? replied his sister. ?We can
sit quietly in a back pew till the service is over.?
This accordingly they did. As they entered, the
sweet strains of the organ were attuned to a
favourite old hymn, which presently the large
congregation took up in deep-throated harmony.
At the conclusion of the hymn a tall, venerable
old man stepped into the pulpit and, with a quiet,
restrained eloquence, spoke sympathetically, as
befitted the occasion. At the conclusion of the
service Phyllis whispered :
? Who was the fine old man who preached from
the pulpit, uncle ? ?
? That was the Archbishop, my dear.?
? What a nice, sympathetic old gentleman ! ?
Presently, after the congregation had dispersed,
the party were conducted over the cathedral.
Among other things pointed out to them was a
small square of wood affixed to the east wall of
the nave.
? What is it, uncle ? ? asked Tony curiously.
? That is a piece of wood taken from the very
tree under which the first service ever held on
these shores was conducted. You see, before any
houses and churches were built, all the Church?s
services had to be held in the open. They were
generally held under a gum tree.?
? It?s quite a nice old cathedral, uncle, isn?t
it ? ? commented Phyllis. ? But I don?t think
it?s as fine as St. Paul?s, in Melbourne, do you ? ?
? Oh, no, dear. Perth, you see, is a much
younger city than Melbourne, and has not a


quarter of the population ; but, at the same time,
I think Melbourne as a city must envy Perth its
magnificent site.?
That evening the party was treated to some-
thing good at His Majesty?s Theatre. At breakfast
next morning Mr. Wilshire suggested another
motor trip and a picnic luncheon.
? Now, where shall we go ? ? he asked jocularly.
? This is our last day in Perth, and we simply must
make the most of it.?
? Is there not rather a wonderful and picturesque
reservoir in the vicinity of Perth ? ? asked Colonel
Stafford. ? Seems to me I?ve read about it some-
where recently. From all accounts it should be
worth seeing.?
?By Jove, the very place for our picnic ! Mun-
daring Reservoir is one of the wonders of the
Commonwealth. It is the goldfields? water supply,
you know. From it is pumped water nearly four
hundred miles to Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie. It is
a beautiful spot, too ; surrounded by hills and
forests and the most gorgeous of wild flowers.
Well, what do you say ? ?
? Yes, yes ! ? in a chorus from the junior
quartet.
? Very well, then. If Mary will kindly see the
proprietor about a luncheon hamper, we will set
off at ten o?clock punctually.?
Two hours later the reservoir was reached. A
week of unusually heavy thunderstorms, just be-
fore Christmas, had caused the great artificial lake
to overflow its solid masonry weir. This was over


a hundred feet in height, and had been built the
entire width of a river valley.
? Isn?t it clinking ? ? enthusiastically com-
mented Tony. ? I say, Reg, remember old Dick?s
yarn about the W.A. goldfields and the scarcity
of water there ? He mentioned something about
this water scheme, too. The people on the gold-
fields should not have to suffer any scarcity now.?
? No, I should say not,? observed Mr. Wilshire,
overhearing the remark. ? A steel conduit nearly
three feet in diameter delivers daily at the mines
five million gallons of pure water.?
? Golly ! And are those the pipes over there ? ?
?pointing in the direction of a line of huge steel
pipes.
? Yes. And yon?s a pumping station. You see,
the greatest difficulty with which the engineers had
to contend was the height up which the water had
to be forced in the course of its long journey of
over three hundred and fifty miles. In all, the
pipe-line climbs 1,290 feet between here and Bulla
Bulling, the highest point upon the circuit. It is
a lift which requires some of the most powerful
pumps in the world to negotiate, and there are
eight or nine of these pumping stations along the
route.?
? But isn?t the water just beautiful ? ? ex-
claimed Phyllis. ? Look how evenly it flows over
the sections of the great weir. Isn?t it pretty with
the sun shining on it ? May we go down a bit
further towards the pumping station, uncle ? ?
? Yes, yes, of course, my dear. Go wherever


you like ?but not too near the cascade. The roar
of the water might turn you dizzy, you know, and
we don?t want to have another funeral service in
the cathedral.?
? Don?t be silly, uncle ! It would take more than
that to make me dizzy.?
Thereupon the four younger fry raced away on
their own down the slopes towards the great basin
at the foot of the weir. Here the waters, dashing
down from the summit of the masonry above,
were churning and lashing the rocks with an angry
roar which fascinated the young people. So long
were they engrossed in beholding the wondrous
spectacle it afforded that time slipped by un-
accountably, and calls from above to return for
luncheon were unheeded. Presently, however,
Colonel Stafford made his way down towards them
and, after repeated cooees, soon had the party
assembled above the bank, where, under a great,
outspreading red gum, there followed a feast
sufficient to appease the healthy appetites of the
hungriest of the gang.
The afternoon was fully taken up with rambles
along the wooded banks of the reservoir. Though
springtime had long passed, flowers were still in
abundance everywhere. The great kangaroo-paws
were a delight to the children, and, contrary to the
regulations, it must be admitted that many beauti-
ful specimens of this unique native flower were
plucked by them ?much to the dismay of Mr.
Wilshire on their return.
Eventually tea was partaken of at a small way-


side ? cosy corner,? and then the journey back
to Perth was made via Greenmount and Guildford.
At Guildford Dick and Ted?s school was pointed
out to the visitors ?the ? Gee-Gee,? as they called
it.
? That?s the magnificent school chapel,? said
Mr. Wilshire. ? It?s by far the finest in the
Commonwealth. It was the gift of a wealthy
English gentleman, and is said to have cost nearly
to build.?
? Well, well,? declared Colonel Stafford, ? the
West, though the youngest of our colonies, can
boast of some wonderful attractions. To think,
now, that W.A. possesses the finest school chapel
in the Commonwealth ! ?
? Yes, I declare it?s quite true,? answered his
brother-in-law. ? Special architects and skilled
masons came out from the Old Country to build
this stately edifice. It is a standing monument to
the influence and far-sightedness of the school?s
headmaster. The Church is very much alive in the
west in its educational provisions. The sisters of
the Church have an equally progressive school for
girls at Mount Lawley, and there are others dotted
over the metropolis and State. Religious educa-
tion is a wonderful power in a land, I think. I
have always upheld it. Improves the character of
the young by a hundred per cent. Apart from our
own Church, the Roman Catholics and the Presby-
terians have very good schools also, and there is a
very keen, healthy rivalry among them all.?
? Well, that?s as it should be,? answered the


colonel. ? I?m very glad to hear that secular
education hasn?t all its own way.?
After dinner that evening the party took it easy
and retired early to bed to be ready, next day, for
the long drive back to the south-west. In the
morning an early start was made, and ? Walabby ?
was eventually reached, without mishap, long
before sundown. So came to an end a memorable
trip long talked of afterwards by the young en-
thusiasts.


CHAPTER XXII
Tragedy at the Long Pool
AS at ? Convenor,? in Victoria, there was one
pastime the boys at ? Walabby,? in the hot
summer weather, were particularly fond of : swim-
ming. The round, or haunted pool, owing to its
great depth, was considered unsafe for this purpose.
Adjacent to the haunted pool, however, was a
narrower, elongated pool with a shallow rock
bottom. Whenever a favourable opportunity pre-
sented itself the boys made the most of it, and
sometimes spent a whole day down at the river in
their bathers. They were most of them good
swimmers, as, indeed, are the majority of Australian
boys. Early in the week following the motor trip
to Perth Dick, Noel, Reg, Tony and Wilfred set
off jovially one morning with their bathing gear,
towels and a hamper for luncheon. They had not
proceeded far when suddenly a loud cooee rang
out somewhere ahead of them.
? Fll bet that?s Don,? wdiispered Reg to Tony.
All five responded to the cooee, and presently,
sure enough, Don was sighted advancing towards
them.
Poor old Don ! ? murmured Tony under his
breath. Then, more audibly: ? Reg, you take


the others on, will you ? I guess Don will want to
do a little peaceable squaring of accounts after that
parrot business the other day. Just as well that
Dick and Noel should remain in ignorance of that
gun affair.?
? Yes, righto, Tony,? agreed Reg, who, after
Don had come abreast of them, greeted him heartily
and then, with the others, pressed forward.
Don Newman, taking Tony?s arm, came at once
to the point. ? Beastly sorry over that affair the
other day, old sport,? began the penitent. ?It
was all my fault, and I was a bit of a cad.?
? That?s all right ??miff said, Don, old boy.
Let?s think no more about it. What about getting
your togs and joining us down at the pool ? ?
? Spiffing ! ?
? Quick?s the word, then ! You?ll find us all down
there.?
Don scuttled away in high glee. Within half an
hour he had rejoined his companions, who already
were enjoying great sport ?like so many dab-
chicks in the water. Don, alas ! could not yet
swim. He was soon in the water, however, and
enjoying himself heartily paddling about the
shallow banks. Presently he found an added sport
in pelting with lumps of clay the five human dab-
chicks. The latter were forced to duck and dive
incessantly in order to avoid the missiles of soft
clay hurled at them. At times, however, Don was
left to his own devices and amusement.
Poor Don ! Though he was enjoying himself
after a fashion, it seemed too bad that he was


unable to enter more fully into the fun and frolic
of his companions in the deeper water. Sometimes,
?with envy, he watched his companions climb high
up the trees which overhung the water?s edge.
Then he would see them taking a header, skim
through the air and plunge into the cool depths
below. Some of them he watched making long
dives under the surface of the water to the opposite
bank, whilst others, throwing their arms above
their heads, went slithering like plummets to the
pool?s rock bottom. At other times he saw his
companions playfully ducking one another, floating
on their backs, treading water and swimming in
divers kinds of ways. Dick and Tony were adepts
at back-somersaulting into the water from the
branches of the trees. Seldom did they fail to
strike the water precisely, feet foremost. Upon all
such tricks and accomplishments Don looked with
envious eyes. How heavenly it must be, thought
he, to be able to do such things. ? Never mind,?
he consoled himself, ? some day I?ll bet I won?t
be left out in the cold.? Somewhat solaced thus,
he waded off by himself along the shallows, and
occasionally practised the art of swimming on his
own, floundering helplessly in every attempt he
made.
About an hour later the boys suddenly awakened
to the fact of Don?s absence. They had noticed
him paddling on his own down the river. But Don
had not returned.
? Dick ! ? shouted Tony ?the first to notice his
friend?s prolonged absence ?? where?s Don got to ? ?


? I dunno ! ?
? Don ! ? one and another of the boys bawled
loudly.
There was no response.
? I say,? said Tony, ? guess we?d better hunt
for him, hadn?t we ? I haven?t seen him for the
last half-hour.?
? Yes. Come along, you fellows! ? shouted
Dick.
For a good quarter of an hour the boys all
searched high and low, but without result. A
cooee and some loud laughter then suddenly broke
upon the ears of the anxious searchers. These
sounds of mirth seemed to come from behind the
thick foliage of a ?tree which projected over the
water at the lower end of the pool.
? Ah, there he is ! He?s all right ! ? exclaimed
Tony with great relief.
The words were no sooner uttered, however,
than a piercing cry was heard, followed by the sound
of snapping branches and a terrific crash into the
water.
Golly ! ? shouted Reg in dismay, ? the limb?s
given under his weight ! Come on, quick, you
fellows ! ?
The five boys headed at once for the bank. On
reaching terra firma they tore away full speed in
the direction whence the cry had sounded.
Presently they came upon the tree, and noticed
that a big branch had recently come away and
deposited itself in the water. But there was no
sign of Don.


? I?ll take a header in,? said Reg. ? You others
wait on the bank and be ready to dive in immedi-
ately should Don come to the surface.?
Without hesitating a second further, Reg dived
straight for the bottom of the pool. For a full
half-minute he groped about under water ere
returning to the surface.
? Seen him ? ? he then spluttered.
? No.?
? You come in too, then, Wilfred, and we?ll
both go down. Keep a sharp look-out, Tony and
Dick ! ?
? Yes, righto ! ?
Splash ! Down the two boys went simultane-
ously. In widening circles they groped about
under the water?s surface, but saw no Don. Then
Wilfred got his hands on to the fallen branch,
which was entirely submerged. He took a firm
grip and pulled and tugged at the branch with all
his might, until compelled to jerk himself upward
to the'surface again for a breath of air. Simultane-
ously with his and Reggie?s reappearance to the
surface there came a sudden shout from Tony,
followed by a resounding splash. What had
happened the tw r o breathless divers at first could
not guess. Tony was not to be seen.
But Noel shouted excitedly from the bank:
? Reg ! Reg ! He?s pulled Tony under ! They?re
struggling together under the water! Quick !
Quick ! ?
Reg and Wilfred immediately struck out for the
spot indicated, and both dived under the surface ?


followed now by Dick Wilshire. A terrific struggle
then ensued.
Noel, with intense anxiety, watched from the
bank the movements of the boys as they worked
their way once again to the surface. Presently
Reg, Wilfred and Dick reappeared, burdened as it
seemed by a dead weight they were hauling between
them.
? Noel,? gasped Reg at length, ? get the towels
and knot them together ! Look sharp ! ?
Like a hare Noel bounded off on this errand, and
as quickly returned.
? Throw me one end ! ? spluttered Dick. ? Hold
fast to the other end, Noel! Now pull for dear
life ! ?
Planting one foot firmly behind the stump of a
tree, Noel tugged desperately with all his young
might upon the improvised rope. His sustained
effort proved sufficient to enable the rescuers
gradually to verge towards the bank.
It was with tremendous relief that Noel presently
saw Reg plant his feet once again upon terra firma.
Wilfred followed, and then Dick, both still tugging
desperately on the dead weight they were bear-
ing between them. Then Tony?s head appeared
out of water. As he was dragged swiftly to the
bank it was discovered that his legs were locked
fast, as in a death grip, by the encircling arms of
the apparently lifeless Don.
To haul Tony and Don to the bank now was
the work of but a moment. Then, thanks to the
excellent first-aid training they had received at


their respective schools, the rescuers knew pre-
cisely what next had to be done, and vigorously
they set about their work. While Dick, with Noel?s
assistance, worked upon Don; Reg and Wilfred,
with dexterous hands, manipulated the unconscious
body of Tony.
? Get some of the boots and some warm
clothing, Noel ! ? exclaimed Dick sharply, as a
preliminary.
? Reg,? said Wilfred, ? lay Tony face downwards,
to get the water and froth as clear away as possible
from his mouth and throat.?
Then, as Noel returned with some boots and
clothing, Wilfred made a pad and placed it low
down under his brother?s chest. Tony?s head,
meanwhile, he rested gently on his ?Tony?s ?out-
stretched right forearm.
? Now then, Reg, place your hands on his lower
ribs, one at each side, and the thumbs, nearly
touching one another, in the small of the back.
Yes, that?s it. Now slowly but firmly slide your
hands along the lower part of his chest to drive
out the air. That?s good ! Now, to assist inspira-
tion, draw back rapidly and relax the pressure
without removing your hands. Keep these alterna-
tive movements going steadily, about twelve to
fifteen times a minute. How?s Don going, Dick ? ?
Wilfred shouted to his friend.
? None too well so far.?
? Now then, Reg,? continued Wilfred, ? let?s
turn old Tony over on his right side ?now on his
chest again. That?s it. Repeat this a few times ?


so long as you see the water continuing to issue
from his mouih.?
? Gad, he?s coming to ! ? excitedly exclaimed
Reg presently, as Tony uttered a long-drawn sigh.
? Reg, old man, I think I can manage him all
right now. Will you cut home and get your uncle
to send down a conveyance, some blankets and
warm clothing as quickly as possible ? Try to keep
all this dark from the others if you can ; it would
only get them all into a panic.?
As soon as Reg had sped away on his errand
Wilfred turned Tony over on to his back and placed
a small pad under his shoulder blades. Then,
opening and wiping his brother?s mouth, he secured
a firm hold of the tongue and drew it well forward.
Kneeling now behind Tony?s head, he grasped his
forearms just below the elbow and drew them up-
wards, outwards and towards him with a quick
sweeping movement. This exercise he repeated
over and over again. Presently, half opening his
eyes, Tony, with a slight gurgling sound, drew in a
long breath.
? Tony ! Tony, old boy ! ? anxiously shouted
Wilfred, but there was no response.
Wilfred next brought his brother?s flexed arms
slowly forward, then downwards and inwards, and
pressed them firmly on to his chest in an endeavour
to induce expiration. After persevering alternately
with these movements for several minutes Wilfred
noticed, to his intense relief, that Tony was begin-
ning to breathe a little more freely and of his own
accord.


? Tony! Tony! ? he repeatedly shouted.
? Tony, come on, old sport ! Don?t you know
me ? ?
? Is he coming to ? ? breathlessly inquired Dick.
? Yes, I think he?s gradually coming round.
What about Don ? ?
? Touch and go, I?m afraid. But there?s still
hope.?
Dick was applying similar treatment to his
young friend to that which Tony had received.
Desperately he worked at Don?s arms, and applied
the pressure to his chest. Several times he?d
detected the faintest of gasping sounds issuing from
his friend?s throat.
? Now then, Noel,? Dick exclaimed sharply,
? get hold of Don?s tongue and hold it clear of
his windpipe while I continue working on his arms
and chest ! ?
Anxiously and with bated breath the two lads
exerted their united skill upon their young English
pal. With the aid of a handkerchief to facilitate
a firm grip, Noel had seized Don?s tongue with one
hand, while with the other he pressed down his
open jaw to its fullest extent. Following Dick?s
instructions, he next pulled the tongue well forward
and held it in that position for two or three seconds,
and then allowed it to recede into the mouth.
These movements he continued perseveringly, in
rhythm, more or less, to the movements of Don?s
arms and the pressure on his chest exerted by
Dick.
? I think he?s gradually coming round, Wilfred.


He?s breathing of his own accord a bit now. What
about lighting a fire ? ?
? Good idea ! Can you spare Noel to do that ?
I?m afraid I can?t leave Tony altogether just
yet.?
? Yes, I think so. Look sharp, Noel! Some
matches in my coat pocket, round the other side
of the pool.?
Noel quickly had a blazing fire going, and plied
upon it a wealth of dried sticks and logs. The heat
of the brilliant summer?s day, thus augmented by
a glowing, ruddy flame, produced?for the first-
aiders, at all events ?a warmth rather uncomfort-
ably severe. Their patients, however, were lifted
and gently placed at a reasonably warm distance
from the bright, cheery blaze. The work of artificial
respiration was then continued. So engrossed were
the boys in their task that they had failed to
notice the near approach of the buggy in which
sat Mr. Wilshire and Reg Stafford.
? Hello, there ! Wilfred ! Dick ! Cooee ! ?
shouted Reg.
? Cooee ! ? returned the boys in unison.
? Thank God! ? exclaimed Wilfred to Dick.
? We?ll soon have ?em tucked snugly between warm
blankets now.?
A few moments later the two patients were
swathed from chin to foot in some hot dry rugs.
Tony was now able to swallow some hot Bovril
which Mr. Wilshire, prompted by his wife, who had
been confided in, had brought with him. A bottle
of smelling salts was also applied to the nostrils of


the two patients. For the moment nothing more
could be done.
? Well, I must say,? exclaimed Mr. Wilshire,
? you lads have done wonderfully well ! See, both
Tony and Don are breathing regularly now, and
are suffering chiefly from exhaustion, I should
imagine. That?s really splendid ! ?
For a good hour the patients were allowed to
remain quiet and undisturbed by the warm fireside.
Though Tony was now sleeping soundly, Don was
restless and feverish. Much to the anxiety of his
numerous attendants, he continued moaning and
tossing himself from side to side for a good ten
minutes. Then, however, as the warmth pene-
trated his system, he, too, gradually grew quieter,
and before long sank off into a profound slumber.
During the long period of anxious waiting which
followed, Reg detailed, for the benefit of his uncle,
all that had led up to the catastrophe and the
subsequent events.
? Don?t you think, Dad, we should let the New-
mans know about Don immediately ? ? asked Dick.
? I had thought of doing so, certainly. But it?s
market day to-day; there?ll be none of them at
home, I?m afraid.?
After a full hour had expired Tony and Don,
both still fast asleep and only semi-conscious, were
lifted gently on to the floor of the buggy and driven
slowly back to the ?Walabby? homestead. On
arrival there Mr. Wilshire found that his good
wife had everything in readiness for the reception
of the patients. Ere long Tony and Don were


placed in separate warm beds, one on either side
of a cheery blaze. All that was humanly possible
was then done to ensure for the lads a speedy
restoration to the normal.
The entire household by this time had been
acquainted of the tragedy. While Mrs, Wilshire
and Mrs. Stafford remained in the sick chamber,
the rest of the family, with their guests, were all
assembled in the dining-room discussing, in subdued
tones, the details of the tragedy.
? It was Reg who first dived in for Don,? Dick
was saying. ? Then Wilfred followed, while the
rest of us kept a close look-out on the bank,
ready to dive in should Don suddenly chance to
appear.?
? But how did Tony become implicated in it ? ?
asked Colonel Stafford.
? Well, that?s the mystery. He must have
caught sight of Don below the surface, entangled
in the dead branch which Wilfred had been exerting
his strength upon. Wilfred?s exertions, it seems,
had partly freed Don from the entanglement, for
no sooner had the two divers reappeared on the
surface than Tony, without uttering a word, took
a swift header into the water. Old Don then
evidently got his ? death-grip ? on him.?
About an hour later Reg and Wilfred were
strolling together outside on the drive, still in deep
discussion upon the one all-absorbing topic.
? Wilfred,? Reg was saying at the moment,
? Tony?s a real brick. Poor old Don was a bit of
a cad, you know, the other week.?


? Oh, but they made that all right between them
this morning. There was no animosity afterwards.?
? No. But at the same time it shows the stuff
old Tony?s made of, all the same.?
? Yes, I agree with you. He was a brick, and no
mistake.?
, ?By Jove, yes ! As near as a clinker gave his
life for his young pal to-day. When Don gets to
know of it?good lor, what a state he?ll be in !
Dear old Tony ! It was simply spiffing ! ?


CHAPTER XXIII
A Double Surprise
THE Staffords, with Wilfred and Tony, arrived
back in Victoria from the west just a day or
two prior to the commencement of the school term.
Both Tony and Don Newman had quite recovered
from the dire happening in the long pool over in
the west. A fortnight after that event the visitors,
having determined upon returning to the east by
the overland route, were motored up to Perth to
catch the ? transcontinental ? for Victoria. A
journey then of well over two thousand miles by
rail lay before them, the longest stage of which
was that between Kalgoorlie and Port Augusta?
a stretch of a thousand and fifty-one miles over a
4-foot gauge. Between Terowie and Mel-
bourne the gauge was even wider ?one of 5 feet
3 inches.
Perhaps the most interesting, if in the height of
summer the least comfortable, stage of the journey
was that across the great interior Nullarbor Plain ?
so named because it is practically treeless. There
the party travelled swiftly over one straight run
of three hundred miles, with not a curve in the
line probably the world?s record for a ? straight.?
Here the boys occasionally caught sight of flocks


of the Australian bustard, or giant turkey. Quail
were numerous. At night they heard the mournful
wail of the curlew, the cry of the plover, and the
quaint ? cark ? of the cormorant. Near to some
limestone holes and caves on one occasion some
ferocious wild dingoes were spotted by the boys,
and on another occasion, soaring majestically over-
head, the largest eagle they had ever seen.
Colonel Stafford related to his young charges
many interesting stories concerning this desert
land and the intrepid explorers of earlier days.
To illustrate his stories he would frequently point
to the old camel-pads winding and twisting across
the plain. Many camels were actually seen en route.
Sometimes aborigines, wandering in small mobs
with their gins, piccaninnies and dogs, were en-
countered. At one small siding some of these
aborigines, in return for largesse, gave demonstra-
tions with their wonderful boomerangs. It was
indeed interesting to watch the curved flight of
these ingenious native weapons. When thrown, the
boomerang, gathering momentum in its passage,
made a wide, circuitous flight through the air till
nearly lost to sight, and then just as swiftly returned
to the feet of the thrower. Thus, if a bird was aimed
at unsuccessfully, the missile returned to the
thrower for another shy ; whereas, if struck, both
bird and boomerang dropped to earth simultane-
ously. Thus to these aborigines it proved a most
accommodating weapon.
The long journey through the desert, by reason
of its novelty, was much enjoyed by the Victorian


back-o?-beyonders, accustomed as they were to
? the green-robed senators of mighty woods.?
A few days after reaching their homes Wilfred
and Tony were back at school again. Both boys
now devoted themselves earnestly to their studies.
Tony took part in several more cricket matches,
but since the winning of the inter-schools? shield
most of the glamour for the time being had gone
out of cricket.
Tony was now working up for a scholarship
which would enable him to proceed to the uni-
versity ; but he kept this crowning ambition much
to himself. Indeed, where his scholastic ambitions
were concerned, Tony at all times was most reticent.
In the inter-schools? athletics, however, the fact
was well known that young Wainwright was keeping
himself fit for the winning of the coveted belt
for boxing. But this event would not be com-
peted for till the following term ; hence Tony?s
present resolve to put most of his available time
into his books.
The term sped by quickly, until at length the
Easter holidays came round and the boys were
ready to return home. The Easter vacation was
not a lengthy one, but, by reason of their long
absence from home over Christmas, Wilfred and
Tony were delighted with the prospects it afforded
them of revelling in some more of the old happy,
care-free days at home and amongst their bush
pals.
The autumn weather was still warm, and the
days long. With the near approach of winter there


was a freshness about everything in the bush which
augured well for the enjoyment of the home-comers.
On their evening arrival at ? Stronghurst ? the
boys received an unusually warm welcome. ? Why,
Willie and Tony, how well you look! ? said
their beaming mother as fondly she kissed them
both.
? Yes, right as rain, Mum ! And we?re both jolly
glad to be home again, I can tell you ! ? replied
Wilfred.
? Why, I should think so ! We?ve hardly seen
anything of you for over seven months.?
? Don?t we know it, Mum ! ? smiled Tony.
? And, bet your life, we?re going to make up for
lost time ! ? Then : ? Hello, Mary !? he exclaimed
on catching sight of his sister Marion.
Marion flew towards them and, eventually
placing an arm round each of her brothers? waists,
accompanied them gaily indoors.
? Don?t let on,? she whispered, ? but we?ve got
a little surprise for you to-night.?
? Ha, ha ! ? gurgled her brothers. ?By Jove,
that?s good, eh, Wilfred ? ?
? Why, what are you laughing at ? ?
? Girls are all alike, it seems,? laughed Wilfred.
? Ought all to have been born in Holland.?
? What?s Holland got to do with it, you big, silly
goose ? ? asked the mystified elder sister.
? Willie means you?re all double Dutch, I sup-
pose,? volunteered Tony.
? But why ? ?
? Well, don?t you see ? You talk of a surprise ?


and then
Jove ! Best I ever heard !?
laughing himself hoarse.
?Oh ! But I wasn?t going to tell ?
? Now, now, Mary ! Careful ! ?
? You stupid boys ! I declare ?
Marion?s sentence was here abruptly cut short
by the entrance of the trio into the large dining-
room, where sat their father waiting to greet his
sons.
? Hello, father! ? the boys exclaimed in a breath
as eagerly they stepped towards the paternal arm-
chair, drawn up at the cosy fireside.
M ell, lads ! greeted their father, rising with
outstretched hand to welcome them. ? Glad to
see you home again ! ? Then, surveying them up
and down, ? Ah,? he continued, ? I declare, Tony
)-ou 11 be as stout as your old dad before long ! ?
? My, yes ! Haven?t they grown, Jim ? ? ex-
claimed the fond mother as proudly she, too, took
stock of the growing physique of her two boys.
Now come along ! ? she added. ? You must be
about famished. Come and have somethin? to eat
at once.? �
? How is it you?ve come so late ? ? asked their
father.
? Oh, there was a general clean-up at Col. Then
we expected some terminal results, and waited to
know our fate.?
? Any luck ? ?
? No?not much, father. I guess old Barry will
be u/- n u m ?- a � n ? the re P ort to you soon.?
ith this their father appeared satisfied. Mean-


while, with alacrity, the boys were tucking into a
roast chicken.
? Sorry we couldn?t wait supper for two
darlings,? apologized their mother. ?We finished
ours about half an hour since.?
? Hurry up, Wilfred and Tony ! ? impatiently
exclaimed Marion. ? Anyone would think you?d
been starving for a whole week ! ?
? What?s the hurry, Mary, dear ? ? banteringly
returned Tony. ? We?ve not half done yet.?
? Oh, do hurry, then! Boys are such gourmands! 55
? Marion dear ! ? reprovingly from her mother.
? It?s all right, Mummy, dear ! ? exclaimed Tony.
? Little sis is only jealous of our healthy appe-
tites.? Then, to his impatient sister: ? He-haw ! ?
causing laughter from all.
Ere long, however, the boys, with a huge sigh
of satisfaction, rose from the table.
? Where are all the others, Mum ?Molly and the
rest of them ? ? wonderingly inquired Wilfred.
? Don?t ask so many questions,? hurriedly inter-
rupted Marion, ? and you won?t be told so
many ?
? Oh, that?s it, is it ? ? exclaimed Tony, cutting
his sister short, ? But I say, Mum, what really is
the matter with little sis to-night ? When we
arrived she told us ?
? Gr-r-r-r ! ? Marion broke in. Then : ? Mummy
dear, don?t you think my little brothers would like
to see over the house ? ?
? Yes. Come along, dears ! ?
No sooner had they quitted the dining-room than


the boys heard peals of laughter issuing from a
large room at the farther end of the house.
? What the deuce ? exclaimed Wilfred.
? Come along ! ? urged Marion, dragging them
both by an arm down the long corridor.
Then the door of the farther room?once a
nursery-schoolroom?was thrown suddenly open.
The two boys were dazzled for a moment by the
brilliant illuminations which streamed upon them
from within.
? Jove, what?s all this ? ?
? Gee whiz ! I say ?
Then suddenly the piano struck up and, ere the
boys had fully recovered from their surprise, the
floor was taken for a dance by an eager little crowd
of young people dressed daintily in all the colours
of the rainbow. The entrance into the room of the
new-comers, however, was the signal for some wild
and sustained cheering on the part of the merry
little throng. Then, as quickly, the strum on the
piano was changed to ?They are jolly good
fellows,? followed immediately by ? When Johnny
comes marching home again ?hurrah ! hurrah ! ?
With ringing voices the choruses were taken up,
while the ? hurrahs ? nearly brought the roof
clattering over the heads of the singers.
Thoroughly mystified, Wilfred and Tony stood
dumbly watching the eager crowd of young people,
mostly of their own age.
What?s it all mean, Mary ? ?
But ere their sister could reply Molly suddenly
presented herself before them. In mock ceremony


she knelt at their feet, and then, standing upright,
proceeded to fasten across each of her elder brothers?
breasts a broad band of coloured ribbon. Having
decorated them with the order, she led them
triumphantly forward into the midst of the room.
There followed a wild scene of clapping of hands
amid peals of laughter. This boisterous commotion
proceeded fully a minute ere Wilfred and Tony
tumbled, even remotely, to the cause of it all.
Then simultaneously they chanced to glance down
at the broad ribbons which adorned their breasts.
Embroidered in large gold lettering upon them
they discovered, to their added bewilderment, the
following inscriptions : ? Welcome, Uncle Wilfred ! ?
? Welcome, Uncle Tony ! ?
? Oh, dash it all! ? exclaimed Tony, flying
suddenly from the room, followed by his brother.
As they sped down the passage to the dining-room
renewed peals of laughter from the schoolroom
smote upon their ears.
? Ha, ha ! Bless my soul, boys ! ? exclaimed
their father as Wilfred and Tony dashed into the
room, ? you appear to have had a right good
welcome to-night, eh ? ?
? What?s it all mean, Dad ? ? _
But by this time Marion had joined them.
? Come, Mary! ? half indignantly exclaimed
Wilfred, ? have you all gone mad in this house ?
? No, Uncle Willie ? ?with another outburst of
laughter.
? For heaven?s sake ? began Tony.
? Well, boys, sit down a moment,? said their


father. ? We?ve all had to run the gauntlet to-
night. I suppose you have learnt before now
what running the gauntlet means. Well, they?ve
had their little joke on us all to-night ?all, that is,
except Molly, who was the only one of us in the
know. Molly was selected by the others as the
little ? priestess ?to perform the ceremonies. I had
my blue ribbon like yourselves, and on it was
inscribed ? All hail, Grandad ! ? Your mother and
Marion had to go through it likewise, and were
hailed as 1 Grandma ? and ? Aunt Mary ? ! ?
? Yes, but what the deuce is it all about ? ?
exclaimed Wilfred.
? Why, my son, the ribbon tells its own tale, does
it not ? ?
? What ! You mean ?
? Yes, of course, you silly dears ! ? said Marion
quite soberly. ? You are both of you ? uncles,?
and we are celebrating your young nephew?s
birthday.?
? You mean to say old Kaye ?
? Yes, of course. But you can leave the old
out.?
? Well, Ibe shot ! What?s his name, Marion ? ?
? What do you think ? ?
? I can?t think at all,? replied Tony.
? Well, then ? ?bestowing on the last speaker a
kiss?? it is the same as your own, Tony darling.?
? Tony Strong, eh ? Sounds funny, that.?
? Tony John Strong his full name is.?
? Well, I be blowed ! ?
? Well, now that you know all about it, come


along back to the schoolroom and join in the fun.
Come along, Willie ; it?s getting really late.?
Having recovered now from their surprise and
mystification, neither of the boys was reluctant
any longer to rejoin the merry throng and enter
fully into the evening?s frolic. On their re-entry
into the schoolroom they found that a set of
lancers had just been announced. Being fond of
dancing, they proceeded at once to select for them-
selves partners from among their many young girl
friends.
? Why, here?s Phyllis ! ? joyfully exclaimed
Tony, as he sat down for a moment beside his old
playmate of many adventures. ? What a shock
you all gave Wilfred and me to-night ! How
are you keeping ? And how?s old Reg getting
on ? ?
? Oh, fine, thanks ! ? answered Phyllis, apropos
of both questions. ? Reg ought to be home to-
morrow from Geelong.?
Tony then led Phyllis on to the floor to help
make up one of the sets. Then the jolly old lancers
commenced. As the couples wheeled and jigged
merrily about the room Tony, at each opportunity
he got, continued to ply his partner with questions.
? How long have you known the news about my
little nephew, Phyllis ? ? he asked.
? Ha, ha ! It was a joke, wasn?t it ? Oh, only a
few days. Mrs. Wainwright kindly asked us all
up for the evening in honour of the event, and of
your and Wilfred?s homecoming. Then we arranged
the little mock ceremony between us, letting only


your little sister Molly into the secret. Not even
your ?
? Swing ! Partners swing ! ? shouted the M.C.
? Here, Wainwright, look sharp ! Phyllis ! . . .
That?s right! ?
A moment later : ? You know, I can?t make out
how you all kept so deucedly quiet after our arrival
home to-night ?why we didn?t hear you all from the
dining-room.?
? Oh, didn?t you notice the sudden absence of
your mother after welcoming you on the verandah ?
She came straight on here and tipped us the
wink.?
? Well, I?m blowed ! Yes, I did notice that.
She left us to the tender mercies of Marion.?
? Yes, that?s right. All up to programme.
Marion was to keep your attention diverted.?
? But how did you ?
? Here, Wainwright ! Ladies to the centre ! ?
shouted the M.C. And again : ? Gentlemen to the
centre ! ?
? Blow ! ? exclaimed Tony, intent only on getting
to the bottom of the mystery which was still
puzzling him.
? Swing ! ?
The merry-go-round started when, mid squeals
of laughter, nearly all the girls were carried off their
feet.
? Jove, that was a bit lively ! ? exclaimed Tony.
Then : ? How did you all manage to keep so
deucedly quiet while we were having supper ? ?
? Well, we had ours then, too. Thought we?d


get it over before you and Wilfred came in. But
really ?
? Grand chain ! ? shouted the M.C. ? Quickly !
Link up there, Wainwright ! ?
? Well, I declare! ? resumed Tony, halting
breathlessly before his partner once more, ? you
seem to have had everything planned out jolly
carefully. But, by Jove, Willie and I thought you
had all gone mad ! ?
Presently, when the lancers had come to an end,
a perfect scrimmage took place. Everyone wanted
to greet the two new arrivals simultaneously.
Then Tony sought out his young sister Molly, and
embraced her affectionately, followed by Wilfred.
Thereafter the two boys mixed gaily with the
throng and enjoyed the time of their lives.
There was still another surprise, however, before
the evening?s conclusion. About 10 p.m. Colonel
Stafford, who had ridden over to accompany his
daughter home, entered the schoolroom with Mr.
Wainwright. The two men proceeded to one end
of the room, and then the colonel launched forth
on a little speech.
? My dear young people, one and all,? he said,
? I have a very pleasant duty to perform before
we all go home to-night, but, as it?s getting late, I
will not detain you very long. Four months ago
I, with several others who are here to-night, was
over spending a glorious holiday in Western
Australia. One afternoon there occurred on my
brother-in-law?s station what would have been a
tragedy had it not been for the pluck and the


presence of mind of four boys. These boys saved
from drowning another young lad, who was unable
to swim. They did it at the peril of their own
lives, and one of them, in fact, after being dragged
under the water, only barely escaped a tragic fate.
This was Tony Wainwright. Wilfred, however, was
equally plucky. I need not enlarge further upon
the story, as many of its details are already known
to you. But I have a little mission to perform this
evening. Mr. Wilshire determined, with his usual
largeness of heart, that such pluck as was shown
on the occasion in question should be rewarded by
some little token of recognition. Hence it is my
pleasant duty to present to two of the plucky
rescuers a little gift procured for them by my
brother-in-law over in the west. Now, if Wilfred
and Tony Wainwright will please step forward . . .?
With an awkward abashment the two boys made
their way over to the colonel and received the
awards. After each had briefly responded, their
father thanked the colonel and expressed the pride
he and Mrs. Wainwright felt in having as sons
two who had evidenced such pluck as had been attri-
buted to Wilfred and Tony. Continuing, he said :
? Colonel Stafford has meekly refrained from
mentioning the names of the other boys, who were
every bit as plucky as were my own. They were,
as some of you perhaps know, Dick Wilshire and
Reginald Stafford.? (Cheers.)
Then Dick Radford shouted : ? Three cheers for
Uncle Wilfred! Three cheers for Uncle Tony!
Hip, hip?hooray ! ?


? Three cheers for Reggie! ? added Shirty
Morrison. (Renewed cheers.)
When the clamour had died down the piano
struck up the opening prelude to ? For they are
jolly good fellows,? to which the gay young company
boisterously responded.
The curiosity of the young people was now
centred upon the awards of which Wilfred and
Tony had been the fortunate recipients.
? By Jove ! ? exclaimed Fred Norman, ? Royal
Humane Society?s Medal, eh ? And I?ll bet that
gold is from the old diggings in the west. Re-
member Dick?s stories about the diggings, Tony ? ?
? Yes, you bet ! And we passed through Cool-
gardie and Kalgoorlie on the ? Trans ? when return-
ing from the west.?
? Lucky D?s, you and Wilfred ! Bonzer medals,
those, too ! ?
After congratulations had been showered upon
Wilfred and Tony the happy party broke up. The
visitors were accompanied out of doors to their
steeds, which were patiently waiting to convey
them to their various homes in the neighbourhood.
As Phyllis Stafford, with her father, was riding
off she gaily turned and shouted to the two Wain-
wrights : ?You must come over soon to ? Con-
venor.? Reg?ll be home to-morrow, you know.?
? Yes, you bet ! We?ll be over before long.
Perhaps the day after to-morrow.?
? Cheerio ! ?
? Good night, Phyllis! Good night, Colonel
Stafford ! ?


CHAPTER XXIV
The Fire-Fighters
TWO days later the young Wainwrights rode
over to ? Convenor.? It was the burning-off
season. Keith Stafford was busily engaged in
preparations for clearing a large tract of bush about
two miles from the homestead. The trees had long
been ring-barked, and now stood dead and gaunt
with their great, barkless limbs upstretched to the
sky. Stacks of fallen timber had been heaped round
the bases of the trees, and there was only needed
now a lighted match to create a mammoth bush
fire. This fire, once lighted, would of itself bring
to earth the majority of the forest giants and eat
down to their very roots in the earth. For the past
week Keith had been occupied ploughing an eight-
foot brake round the area to be cleared. This was
to prevent the fire, once lighted, from trespassing
on to neighbouring properties.
During the morning, at ? Convenor,? the young
holiday-makers amused themselves as young people
only know how. On a farm there are no dull
moments; the woods and open fields and the
animal and creature life provide abundant diver-
sions ; monotony and boredom there are foreign
to the youthful. This fact was sufficiently evidenced
by these young people on this particular morning.


When Tony and Wilfred arrived at ? Convenor ?
they begged Reg and Phyllis to get their ponies
out, that they might all go for ? a bit of a spin.?
The next hour or so was spent by the happy quartet
in careering over fields and through rough bush
country. Many a wallaby they espied bounding for
safety through the wild back country.
? I say,? said Reg, on glimpsing the first
wallaby, ?we should have brought the guns.
Some rare sport about here. The ?roos are not
disturbed much on these hillsides.?
? Oh, we can give ?em a rest for once! ? replied
Phyllis. ? What about doing some trick riding for
a change ? ?
? Righto ! ?
? Well, then ?right about turn ! Quick march ! ?
ordered Phyllis.
At once the four riders reversed in their saddles
and, drawing hard on the bridle reins, forced their
steeds backwards.
? Halt! Attention ! Stand at ease ! ? Here the
horses were brought to a stop while all the riders,
with a bound upward, jumped to their feet in the
saddles. ? Quick march ! Riders ?right about
turn ! Double ! ? The steeds were now urged to a
trot with the riders still standing in the saddles.
? Halt! ?
Of the four riders Tony only came to grief. His
pony had come rather too suddenly to a stand.
Still clutching the reins, however, Tony bounded to
the earth upon his feet, and w r as swiftly erect on the
saddle again.


? All ?fall into line ! ? ordered Phyllis. ? Outer
flanks ?change horses ! ? Here each of the outer
couples stepped briskly on to the saddle of the
neighbouring steed. ? Number ?from the left !
Odd numbers ?one length forward ! Even numbers
?fall into line in the rear ! Quick march ! Halt!
Form fours ! ?
Here Phyllis herself got into a tangle, her
borrowed pony being unaccustomed to her handling
of it. She, too, had to slide to the ground. But
she quickly recovered her stand on the saddle.
The four steeds were now standing patiently in
single file, with their riders standing erect on the
saddles awaiting further orders. These were not
long in forthcoming.
? Left turn ! Eyes to the right ! Quick march !
Right wheel! ? Horses and riders were now all
abreast, marching homeward. ? Halt ! Change
steeds ! Gallop ! ? And so to ? Convenor.?
This trick riding had developed into a common
form of amusement among these hardy young bush
folk. It was wonderful to see them thus engaged
and to note the precision with which they executed
the orders of their young officer.
Another diversion at which they were adept was
? cart-wheeling.? Hand over hand on the lawn ?
Not a bit of it ! This was the real thing, and
required a cart, wagon or drag for the purpose.
While the cart was at a standstill the boys, stepping
on to the lower rim of the wheel and grasping with
their hands two of the upper spokes, bent their
necks under the upper rim. When all were in


readiness the cart was put into motion. Round
and round the tricksters spun, and a most comical
sight they presented.
But now, on arriving at ? Convenor,? the quartet
found, to their amazement, that it was already
lunch-time. After seeing to the needs of their
ponies they trooped into the house, expressing
themselves as ? famished,? and ere long sat down
to the enjoyment of a hearty meal.
? Well, boys, had a good morning ? ? asked the
colonel.
? Bonzer ! ? replied Reg. ? Saw tons of wallabies
in the far hill paddock.?
? But you weren?t shooting this morning ? ?
? No,? laughed Tony ; ? doing some trick riding
instead. Phyllis would make a capital ? general,?
Colonel Stafford.?
? Would she, indeed ! ? mildly protested Mrs.
Stafford. ? I do wish you?d all give up those
foolish tricks. I feel sure something dreadful ?
? Why, no, Mum ! ? declared Phyllis, anticipating
her mother?s expressions of fear. ? It?s quite easy.
If anything goes wrong one can always jump safely
to the ground. Both Tony and I had to jump to
the ground this morning.?
? So you and Tony were the two duds, eh ? ?
teased the colonel.
? That?s all very well, though,? maintained Mrs.
Stafford, ignoring her husband?s pleasantry, ? But
supposing the ponies were to bolt ! ?
? Too well trained for that. Don?t worry,
Mummy darling ; trick riding?s as safe as houses.?


? Where?s Keith, Colonel Stafford ? ? inquired
Wilfred, diplomatically changing the subject.
? Oh, he?ll be in soon. Preparing for some
burning-off in the back paddock. I think I heard
him enter the kitchen a moment ago.?
A few minutes later the colonel?s elder son, still
in his working clothes, but fresh from liberal
ablutions with ?apparently??sunlight? soap,
entered the dining-room, his face a-shine with other
than good humour.
? How do, Uncle Willie ? How do, Uncle
Tony ? ? were his cheery greetings of the two young
guests.
? Ha, ha ! ? roared the colonel. Then, addressing
the boys : ?I hear you had a right royal welcome
home the other night. Apparently I just missed
the fun.?
? Shame ! ? added Mrs. Stafford. ?They did
lay it on thick, did they not ? ?
The boys, though somewhat blushingly, entered
heartily into the laugh.
? I think,? ventured Wilfred, ? that Phyllis had
something to do with that. Just you wait !? he
continued, turning towards Phyllis. ? We?ll get
our own back one of these days, won?t we, Tony ? ?
? Yes, you bet ! �
? Right you are ! ? returned Phyllis. ? And
thanks so much for kindly giving me warning,
Wilfred darling. I?ll be on the qui vive now. You
won?t catch me napping so very easily, I can tell you.?
I must admit,? added Tony, ? that whoever
was responsible brought it off jolly well.?


? Wasn?t Molly just splendid ? ? laughed Phyllis.
? Yes ; and she?s another who will have to look
out for herself,? quoth Wilfred. ? We?ll get our
own back on the whole jolly lot of you. You just
wait, old girl! ?
? I think,? laughed Mrs. Stafford, ? you boys will
have to be careful the girls don?t turn the tables on
you a second time, especially since you?ve given
them such timely warning. Keith, a little more
pudding ? ?
? Thanks, mater ! ?
? What are you youngsters doing with yourselves
this afternoon ? ? asked the colonel.
? Any exciting fireworks out your way, Keith ? ?
inquired Reg.
? Well, I hope not too exciting. But I guess I?ll
be setting the fires away this afternoon.?
? Oh, bonzer ! That?s clinking ! ?
? I suppose I must consider my question an-
swered, then ? ? quoth the colonel.
? Yes, Dad ?if the others are all on.?
To this there was a ready chorus of assent.
? Well,? admitted Keith, ?we can perhaps do
with a few extra hands this afternoon. But I?d
advise you all to put on some old togs.?
? Yes, you bet ! ? answered Reg. ? I?ll rig old
Wilf and Tony out all right.?
An hour later the young people, accompanied for
safety by the colonel himself, were all upon the
scene of operations. A fairly strong wind was
blowing and the day, for the time of year, was a
warm one.


? Think it?ll be all right ? ? inquired Keith
anxiously of his father.
? I should think so. Brakes all right ? ?
? Yes ; four strips with the 4 three-furrow.? ?
? Should be sufficient. Wider than the regula-
tion.?
? Well ? ?striking a match ? 44 here goes ! She?s
away ! ?
? Truly said ! ? exclaimed the colonel a moment
later. ? She?s away right enough ! ?
? Jove, what a clinker ! ? shouted Reg excitedly,
after five or ten minutes had elapsed. ? Come on,
you fellows, let?s follow her up ! Isn?t she travel-
ling ? ?
Away raced the party on their steeds, wheeling
this way and that, dodging the curling, leaping
tongues of flame as they licked up the stacks of
dried timber heaped round the bases of the dead
upstanding giants. These detached and rapidly
accumulating fires were left in the rear by the
party, who sped onward, endeavouring to keep up
with the galloping grass-fire ahead. Over the
burnt grass they raced, the ponies quite accustomed
to this sort of thing.
? Reg ! ? shouted Keith, 44 you and Tony follow
me, and we?ll see if we can get ahead of the fire.
We?ll skirt it to the left. If we can get to the brake
first we?ll be able to safeguard the far-side paddock
from flying sparks.?
Bawling out to Tony to follow, Reg and Keith,
wheeling to the left, made off at full gallop, with
Tony hard on their horses? heels.


? Now then, you others ! ? shouted the colonel.
? Come along, sharp ! We?ll flank the fire in the
opposite direction. Come along ! ?
Away they raced ?Colonel Stafford, Phyllis and
Wilfred.
? My, she?s travelling some ! ? gasped Wilfred,
enveloped in columns of dense smoke.
? By Jove, she is ! ? rapped out the colonel, a
little anxiously. ? Wind?s freshening, too, it
seems.?
Ere long the trio had got clear of the columns of
smoke and were racing at breakneck speed to out-
pace the fire, which, with a dull roar, swept onward
like a tornado.
? Oh, you poor things ! ? sympathetically ex-
claimed Phyllis, half to herself, as she beheld
numberless creatures of the forest leaping and
bounding to left and right for safety. ? Wilfred ! ?
she shouted, ? do look at those poor creatures !
Isn?t it a shame ? ? A moment later she closed
her eyes in horror as she beheld a huge buck
kangaroo, half crazed with fear, dive, as it seemed
deliberately, into an inferno of leaping flame.
? Poor wretch ! ? murmured Wilfred. ? I have
often read of horses and sheep doing that sort of
thing. The fire fairly mesmerizes them.?
It was indeed a sad sight which presented itself
left and right to the eyes of the riders as they sped
onward ; kangaroos, rabbits, native bears and
other smaller inhabitants of the wild bush, seized
with panic, were fleeing for their lives in all direc-
tions.


? By Jove ! ? exclaimed Wilfred presently. ? Look
overhead, Phyllis ! ? Where the carcass is, there
will the eagles be gathered together,? eh ? ?
? My, yes ! What enormous fellows ! ?
? Jove, yes ! They?ll be in for a banquet soon ?
already cooked.?
? Wilfred ! Don?t be so horrid ! ?
? Come on ! ? bawled the colonel. ? Waste no
time ! We must get to that brake ! ?
With heels dug into the horses? flanks, away sped
the riders afresh. Faster and faster they rode
through the bush, hurdling over logs and bushes,
ducking their heads beneath outspreading branches
of trees, or floundering through a miry creek. On
they raced.
Ten minutes later, well ahead of the fire, the trio
struck the long trail of the plough. As they did
so the colonel, followed by Wilfred and Phyllis,
wheeled to the left with the object of joining forces
with the other young horsemen. This they suc-
ceeded at length in accomplishing; but no sooner
was their object achieved than from somewhere
there rang out, above the roar of the oncoming
tornado of flame, shrill, penetrating shrieks of
terror.
? Jove, what?s ? began the colonel?a repeti-
tion of the dread cries cutting him short.
For a moment all listened spellbound, horrified.
Then Keith, suddenly wheeling his horse around,
raced swiftly away in the direction of the oncoming
fire.
? Come back ! Come back ! ? roared the colonel.


But his elder son, heedless of his cries, still raced
onward, and was quickly lost to view in the dense
bush. Guided by the shrill screams of terror,
which still persisted, Keith urged his horse on
and on.
? Madness ! ? stormed the colonel, who, in his
utter bewilderment, had not fully sized up the
situation.
? Colonel Stafford, let me go after him ! ? eagerly
besought Tony.
? No, no ! Would never permit it! Stay here,
all of you ! ?
Having settled this point, the old colonel himself
suddenly reined his steed around and raced swiftly
in pursuit of his elder son. As he tore onward the
colonel?s mind cleared. Between gasps for breath
he rapped out short, pithy exclamations to himself :
? Gad, yes !. . . Quite forgotten !. . . Poor
devils ! . . . Lucky that creek being there ! . . .
Impede fire a bit, perhaps ! . . . Not a sufficient
brake, though !. . . Hell! Listen to that !. . .
God spare my boy !. . . Keith ! Keith ! ? he
shouted frantically. . . . ? Keith ! . . . The devil!
What
Keith, meanwhile, had arrived safely at the
creek. On first racing away from his companions
he had suddenly remembered the existence of a
single native encampment by the side of a small
water-hole at the creek. As in a flash, he recol-
lected that in this encampment there dwelt an
old black fellow and his gin, together with the old
man?s mother, who was bedridden.

? Gosh, if I can only get there first ! ? he ex-
claimed. ? The creek evidently has held up the
fire somewhat.? Then he raced silently onward
until ultimately he reached the encampment.
When the primitive native hut hove to view,
however, no sign of a native could be seen. ? The
devils !? he exclaimed angrily. ? They?ve deserted
the poor old wretch ! Jove, the hut?s surrounded
with flame already ! It?ll be touch and go, if old
Granny is not already suffocated. No, she?s still
yelling. Good ! ?
Wrenching a long green bough from a sapling,
he made swiftly, still astride his horse, towards the
rude hut, beating out the flames which challenged
his progress with the long green sapling as he
moved forward. Several times his steed reared up
and nigh unsaddled him. But at length, gasping
as in a furnace of flame and smoke, he reached the
hut and swiftly dismounted. Hitching his horse
momentarily to a post, he dived into the hut
wherein the old gin was still screaming herself
hoarse. Seizing the old lady, he made for his steed
again. In a moment he had mounted with his
light, dishevelled burden, and then, digging his
heels into his horse?s flanks, raced desperately for
safety. Clean through the raging tornado of flame
he galloped?till at long last he reached the ploughed
brake and rejoined his companions.
? Keith ! Keith ! ? shouted his brother and
sister in anguish as the plucky rescuer raced
towards them, ? Keith ! where?s Father ? ?
? Father ! What do you mean ? ? gasped the


rider, drawing up and depositing his burden into
the upstretched arms of Reg and Tony.
? Didn?t you see him, Keith ? Father raced
away after you, and forbade us to follow him ! ?
groaned Reg. ? Here, Phyllis,? continued he,
? mind this old hag ! I?m off ! ?
With this he, too, made off, and a moment later
was followed by Keith, Wilfred and Tony.
? Which direction did Dad take ? ? gasped
Keith, who had not yet fully recovered from his
former exploit.
? A bee-line for that screaming old hag.?
? The deuce ! Can?t make out how I missed him,
then.?
About three minutes later the quartet, having
spread themselves out in order to cover a good area
of the bush, sighted the fire sweeping swiftly
towards them. Blocked temporarily by the creek,
it was now gathering force with every yard it
covered.
? Gad, there?s Father ! ? shouted Reg excitedly
to his companions. ? Come quickly, Keith ! He?s
unhorsed and lying on the ground.?
In another moment the four boys were kneeling
by the side of the prostrate old colonel. But there
was no time to be lost. Keith, lifting his father
gently with the aid of his companions, bore him
swiftly to the saddle. Then, leaping to the saddle
himself and supporting his father with one arm,
he made back again with haste towards the anxious
Phyllis, followed by the other riders. The fire,
still raging towards them in dense columns of smoke


and flame, roared and crackled angrily in their
rear, as though infuriated in twice being cheated
of its prey. On it came, scattering its sparks to
the four winds of heaven. But it was not quick
enough to overtake the riders. The boys, having
safely reached the ploughed brake, deposited the
insensible colonel upon a bier of grass some little
distance beyond. Then, for the first time, was it
possible for Keith to make an examination of his
patient. This he did anxiously, hoping eagerly
that nothing really serious had happened to his old
Dad.
? Can?t quite make it out,? he said, presently.
? Limbs O.K. Must be concussion, I think.
Slight bruise there, on his forehead. Poor old
Father ! ? Then, addressing Reg : ? Can you
manage the old lady, Reg ? We must get them
both home without loss of time.?
? Yes, I guess so.?
? Well, come along then ! Phyllis, you?d better
come, too ! ?
? But what about the fire ? ? exclaimed Phyllis,
despite her eagerness to accompany her father.
? Tony and I?ll stay on here,? volunteered
Wilfred. ? I guess it won?t give much trouble now.
See, the brake?s beaten it in several places already !
Anyway, we?ll have some good stout saplings
ready. Don?t you mind us; we?ll come along
later.?
? Thanks, Wilfred old boy ! ?
Keith and the others then moved off for home.
Wilfred and Tony found matters a little more


exciting than they had anticipated. Flying sparks
were responsible for this ; but, sitting astride their
ponies, and armed with stout and lengthy saplings,
they were enabled to cover a good deal of ground
and rapidly to meet the danger as occasion arose.
Speeding to left and right along the brake, swishing
their saplings vigorously on the spark-lighted tufts
of grass as they went, they fought manfully to get
the fire under control. This they ultimately
succeeded in accomplishing. By the space of an
hour, along the entire front of the brake, all further
danger from sparks w r as averted. With huge sighs
of relief the young fire-fighters then made tracks
themselves for ? Convenor.? On arrival there they
learned, to their great joy, that Colonel Stafford had
recovered consciousness and was progressing favour-
ably. They were at once admitted to the bedroom,
where Colonel Stafford, his head swathed in
bandages, awaited them.
? Brave boys ! Brave boys ! ? the old soldier
exclaimed as he caught sight of his two visitors.
u lt was Keith , Colonel Stafford. He saved both
you and the old black nanny,? insisted Tony.
? Yes, Keith, Reg, Phyllis ?all of you ! I?m
proud of such youngsters ! ?
? Really, colonel, we did nothing at all. It was
Keith ?though Reg was the first to find you. But
we?re all mighty glad you?re better.?
? I?oh, damme ! ?tottering old fool I was ! ?
? What really happened, Colonel Stafford ? ?
asked Wilfred.
? Oh, sight?s failing, I suppose. Must have been


a branch struck me. I can?t quite remember.
But I?ll be all right in a day or two.?
? Well, we all jolly well hope so,? replied Tony.
? And now we must be off ?strict orders, you
know, not to keep you talking too long.?
? Good-bye, my little friends. God bless you
both ! ?
Reg, who was awaiting the boys outside, con-
ducted them to an outhouse where, tucked up
safely, lay the old black gin. She was really none
the worse for the severe fright and shaking she had
received, and had just polished off a huge dish of
Irish stew.
? Well, Reg old cock, it?s getting late now, and
we must be making tracks for home,? quoth Wilfred.
? Sorry I wasn?t at your presentations the other
night,? replied Reg.
? Presentations ? Oh ! But what about you and
Dick Wilshire ? Didn?t you get anything ? ?
? Yes?but I don?t know why.?
? Neither do we. But why didn?t you tell us
about yours before, you old darkey ? Congrats,
old boy ! ?
? Same to you and Tony.?
? Oh, you three parrots ! ? exclaimed Phyllis,
suddenly bounding upon them from nowhere.
? Chatter, chatter, chatter ! Boys are all alike ! ?
? Why, I like that ! We?re quite staid compared
to girls,? chuckled Tony.
Are you, indeed ? My, you?d take some
beating! ? she laughed. ? But come in now.
Tea?s ready.?


? No, thanks. We?re just off home. Thanks for
the clinking day. We?ll just say good-bye to Mrs.
Stafford and Keith and then bolt for it.?
Having performed this mission, Wilfred and
Tony soon found themselves on the road for home,
tired but thrilled by their adventurous day?s
outing.


CHAPTER XXV
The Inter-Schools ? Belt
DURING the winter term which followed, Tony,
without forgetting the coveted scholarship,
concentrated on the winning of the inter-schools?
boxing championship. To this end he entered upon
a prolonged course of training under his school
coach. Ten weeks from the opening of term, in
the Cults? athletic events, he succeeded in knocking
out Waters ?hitherto his school?s champion boxer.
Tony now was acclaimed the Cults? champion.
Soon the big inter-schools? events were to be con-
tested, The Christian Brothers? College boasted of
a redoubtable boxer named Maloney. Pat Maloney
was a raw-boned Irish lad, big and hefty. For
several weeks past the preliminary heats had been
under contest. When the big day therefore came
round there remained only the final bout to decide
the championship. This now lay between Wain-
wright and the C.B.C.?s hefty exponent.
Tony, under the careful training of his gym.
master, was in the pink of condition. Among the
Cults he was a great favourite for the big forth-
coming event. Many among the rival schools also
favoured his chances with the Irish lad. For one
thing, it was recognized that what he lacked in
359


inches he fully made up for in temperament. He
possessed the enviable capacity for rising to the big
occasion. When at length the afternoon arrived
for the inter-schools? events, the stadium was
crammed to its utmost limits. Hundreds of youth-
ful enthusiasts and their friends were there ?repre-
sentative of all the schools. The staffs, too, were
fully represented. Tony?s father, though not parti-
cularly keen on boxing, was present for the occasion
with Cyril and Wilfred. Colonel Stafford, who had
fully recovered from his accident, was sitting
immediately behind his friends with Keith. Near-
by w T ere also to be seen Dick Radford, Fred Norman
and Shirty Morrison. How these latter had
managed to gain admission to the stadium was, at
the time, a mystery to Tony.
The first items on the programme consisted of
some gymnastic displays. In these all the schools
were represented, and honours seemed to be about
equally divided. The trapeze, parallel bars, the
dummy horse, all came in for their share of clever
and scientific handling. Some wrestling matches
followed and some very clever Ju-jitsu contests.
These preliminary events, though exciting ?or
amusing?enough, were regarded by the back-o?-
beyonders with a certain amount of impatience
and boredom. One event only had attracted them
in from out-back?an event which was set down
last of all on the programme. But at length the
moment arrived for the really big thing of the
afternoon ?a moment to which Tony himself had
eagerly looked forward during many months past.


As the names of the rivals for the coveted belt
and their colours were announced, the lads imme-
diately stepped on to the boards. Then, after
proceeding to their respective corners, they were
taken in hand by their trainers. Presently, at a
given signal, the rivals approached each other in
the centre and, with their gloves on, shook hands.
Then the first round commenced. Maloney quickly
got in a left to the body. The lads clinched, and
the referee stopped and warned them. Maloney
was very active and twice landed blows on Tony?s
head.
In the second round Maloney landed some hard
jabs, but Tony was quite unconcerned. The Cults?
lad was very clever in evading some of Maloney?s
angry ? rights,? but at the end of the round both
lads were bleeding from the nose. Maloney
appeared somewhat ruffled.
There was some close fighting in round three,
and in a breakaway Wainwright got his opponent
with a hard drive to the jaw. Then, amid great
excitement, Maloney replied with a fierce blow
which obviously shook Wainwright?s body. Tony,
however, came up quite fresh and smiling for the
next round and Maloney promptly got in another
hard right-handed blow. Tony, to the disappoint-
ment of a large section in the stadium, sank to the
floor. There were shouts of ? He?s down ! He?s
down ! ? and the hearts of Tony?s friends nearly
leaped into their mouths.
? B X Jove, Keith ! ? exclaimed Wilfred anxiously,
? I hope he?ll get up in time.?


262 BOYS OF BACK O' BEYOND
The referee was counting ? . . . three . . . four
five . .
? Get up, Tony, lad ! ? shouted Dick Radford,
with excitement/ Dick?s stentorian voice carried
well above the clamorous noise of the moment.
But, if Tony heard the encouraging voice of his old
friend, he made no immediate response.
? . . . six . . . seven . . .? droned the referee.
? ? ? w?? - -
? Tony ! Tony ! ? shouted many of his old school-
mates.
? . . . eight . . .?
? I doubt he?s finished,? said the lad?s father to
Colonel Stafford.
? No, not a bit of it,? was the reply.
Even as the colonel spoke there were shouts of
? Hooray ! . . . Hooray ! . . . he?s up again ! . . .
Game for anything yet ! . . . Good lad, Tony ! ?
Though obviously shaken, Tony was on his feet
again, and, what?s more, meant business. He pro-
ceeded to launch some terrific blows at Maloney,
and the fourth round ended with some good
fighting.
? It was really fine, that,? exclaimed the colonel
to his friend. 4< Wonderful pluck of the lad. Did
you notice, Wainwright, your boy suddenly clutch
the ropes on either side of him at the count of six ?
At seven he was pulling himself upright again.
Then at eight, after a barely perceptible pause, he
stumbled towards Maloney and pitched in for all he
was worth. He?s a plucky lad ?never knows when
he?s beaten.?
? I don?t know very much about boxing, but


wasn?t that the celebrated ? Mary Ann 5 that floored
my boy ? ? asked Mr, Wainwright.
? Yes, that?s so, and he got it fair and square.
But the way the lad rallied was a miracle?splendid !
I guess few thought he?d recover after taking the
count so long. Showed wonderful courage and
magnificent resolve. And, Jove! Look at him now.?
?Go it, Tony! ? shouted Shirty Morrison.
? Duck ! That?s it! Let him hit the air a bit.
Soon tire him, that.?
But young Wainwright now flung himself against
his opponent ?there was agony in his eyes ?and for
many seconds at a stretch he kept as near to
Maloney as the latter would allow him. Maloney
got in a jab to the chin, but the Cults? lad was cool
and collected, and seemed to have something up his
? sleeve.? He fought back in great style, twice
catching Maloney on the face. But suddenly a left
hook skimmed his chin and put him down again.
It was not the blow itself that felled him. He was
obviously suffering from the semi-paralysis that the
former had caused. For five seconds he rested.
The match seemed as good as won by Maloney,
who undoubtedly had many points to his credit.
But Tony came back once more. He fought now
with a desperate fury that was as remarkable as it
was ?by most present ?unexpected.
? Magnificent! Magnificent! ? chuckled Colonel
Stafford to himself. ? Really marvellous pluck !
Oh, too bad, the gong?s gone. Maloney couldn?t
have stood up to that hammering much longer.
I should say that was Tony?s round, on points.?


In the opening stages of the following round
Maloney was the chief aggressor ?but he was
inclined to clinch. Maloney was smiling confi-
dently. He had good cause. The points on the
match, as a whole, were clearly his still. He
seemed, however, a trifle over-confident. His face
was wreathed ; he had recovered from the fit of
anger that had momentarily overwhelmed him at
the close of the second round. But now, tightly
pressed against the ropes?the recipient of a very
hurricane of blows ?Maloney suddenly went down.
It was obvious that he was endeavouring to claim
a foul. He was doubled up, but the referee refused
to listen to his appeals.
? Good old Tony ! ? shouted Norman.
? Was it a foul ? ? asked Wainwright of his
friend.
? Not a bit of it. A perfectly legitimate knock-
out. The referee hasn?t a doubt of it, either.?
After an interval which seemed longer than is
required to lose a fight, Maloney crawled back,
but, as Tony neared him, he fell again. Almost
simultaneously the bell rang, and signalled the end
of the round. To Maloney this was very welcome.
It was noticeable, however, that as he went to his
stool he was still protesting.
? Seems a sullen bloke, that Maloney,? remarked
Dick Radford.
? Watch him next round,? quoth Cyril. ? I?ll
bet he?ll go at it like a wild bull in a china
shop.?
Cyril?s prognostication proved correct. After his


two minutes? rest Maloney left his stool in the
manner of an enraged individual being ejected
from a spring-board. He was across the ring and
on top of his opponent before young Wainwright
had properly lifted himself.
? Gee ! Look at him ! ? shouted Shirty Morrison.
? More like a mad gorilla than anything else.?
There followed a pulsing space of tremendous
battling. Then Tony collapsed. He did not, how-
ever, take a count; he merely waited for Maloney
to step back. This the latter did, but at the same
instant he jerked his right hand back viciously
with intent to deliver a blow. Another tick and
there would have been a foul. Fortunately Maloney
kept his head. It was now that the real fighting
started. There had been little real boxing in the
earlier rounds ?no hint of finesse, no suggestion of
cleverness, no approach to artistry. But now the
contest developed into a plain slogging match.
First Wainwright scored with a right to the chin.
Maloney forced a counter. Then the smaller lad
got in a couple of good lefts, but was caught with
a right to the body. Wainwright, however, steadied
Maloney with a right to the chin and, getting him
on the ropes, pounded his face mercilessly. The
enthusiasm of the crowd was now intense, and
advice and encouragement to both lads was not
wanting from partisans in the stadium.
? Use your reach, Maloney ! . . . Give him a
good ?un on the beak ! . . . Try another ? Mary
Ann ? . .
? Pitch in, Tony ! . . . You?ve got him ! . . .


Get your own back ! ... Go it, he?s done for !
. . . Oh, well hit, what a stunner ! ?
Long before the finish of this round Maloney?s left
eye had gone. The big Irish lad was nearly spent ;
only his phenomenal strength and pluck kept him
on his feet. Tony was showing more and more
confidence, while his opponent was missing fre-
quently. But the exchanges were still full of
interest ?hard blows being the order of the round.
In the eighth round Maloney looked distinctly
worried. He was practically blinded to boot, and
was now the receiver-general. Every punch he
threw out was wildly delivered. He could scarcely
see his opponent. Some of his swings landed, but
the majority simply whistled through the air. All
this time Wainwright was upper-cutting and hook-
ing him freely ; he employed almost every blow
known to boxing, save a straight cross to the chin.
But the end was not really in sight yet. Maloney
was decidedly in a bad way, especially about the
eyes, but his strength was still good, and the ? Mary
Ann ? seemed ready at any time to work further
mischief. He quickly landed a fine left. Wain-
wright showed no distress and replied smartly.
He was very quick on Ins feet and punished his
man heavily, but his blows lacked sting.
? Oh, well done, Maloney ! ? shouted someone
in the stadium as the Irish lad rushed in on his
opponent and scored a couple of left swings to the
body. Maloney now fought back in grim style.
He tried left and right swings in quick succession;
but the Cults? lad took the punishment without

misjudge his distance.?

flinching. Wainwright now cut in again, and did
all he could to obtain a knock-out. He caught
Maloney with a hard right near the point, then
three times got in a left to the body. A hard right
to the ribs appeared then to disconcert Maloney.
But once more the Irish lad rallied. He made a
blind rush at Wainwright, but seemed to misjudge
his distance. Before his hands were fully raised
Wainwright was pounding mercilessly at his head
and body. Maloney was flung back against the
ropes, and for nearly a minute was the recipient of
a hurricane of blows. Then, quite suddenly, he
reeled away ?blindly, totteringly ?clutching the air.
Quite rightly the referee called a halt and waved
Wainwright back to his corner.
? Gentlemen ! ? he then shouted to the audience,
? I award the fight to Tony Wainwright. I congra-
tulate both lads for the magnificent fight they have
put up. The contest has been a clean one, and
brings credit to the school promoters of these very
interesting and, to my mind, very important
athletic events.?
It was a thrilling, pathetic end, but the main
memory it left was of an unconquerable spirit on
the part of Maloney ?a spirit that was only
quenched when loss of vision was coupled with
approaching exhaustion. Pat Maloney, beaten, was
a gallant figure.
And Tony ? ?all that need be said is that he rose
to heights that even his closest friends and admirers
considered unattainable in one so youthful. He was
a worthy inter-schools? champion. Before he left


the boards he was cheered to the echo from all
sections of the stadium. The ? back-o?-beyonders ?
w r ere wild with delight, and enthusiasm, and roared
themselves hoarse with tumultuous cries of ? Good
old Tony! ? ? Well done, Tony lad !?'
? A great fight ! ? everyone was saying as they
crowded out of the stadium. ? Yes, no mistake
about it ?a really great fight ! Wonderfully plucky,
both of ?em.?
? Very pathetic to see that big, raw-boned Irish
lad crumple up as he did,? remarked Mr. Wain-
WTight to his friend, on attaining the exit of the
stadium.
? Yes, he had plenty of grit to hold on as long as
he did?though he was a beaten man really long
before the end came. But your boy, Wainwright,
truly surpassed himself.?
Whilst awaiting a tram to convey them to their
hotel, Mr. Wainwright suddenly caught sight, on
the roadway, of the referee of the match. Being
slightly acquainted with him, he at once hailed
him over.
? I must congratulate you,? he said, ? on the
way you handled the contest just now. I?m sure
you left no room for complaint on either side.?
? Well, I hope not, Mr. Wainwright. In my turn,
I must congratulate you on the remarkable pluck
exhibited by your lad. If he were to take up boxing
really seriously?as a profession, I mean ?I?m
certain he?d go a very long way.?
? Thank you ! Thank you ! But there?s no fear
of that. Unless I?m greatly mistaken, my lad has


other ambitions. But ?what were your impres-
sions of the match as a whole ? ?
? Well, as far as these inter-schools contests go,
the match will long remain memorable for two
reasons ?its extraordinary ferocity in the conclud-
ing stages and the quite phenomenal return of
young Wainwright after being down for a count of
eight seconds ?and for another count of five
later.?
? Yes,? chimed in Colonel Stafford, ? I must say
that was really astonishing. Most of the onlookers,
I?m sure, fully thought he was done for in that fourth
round.?
? There were those,? continued the referee, ? who
considered that your son, Mr. Wainwright, was
lacking in recuperative powers. Why, I don?t
know. But he has confounded all his critics on
this occasion. Jove ! that punch he took on the
point of the jaw?the celebrated ? Mary Ann ? ?
so thoroughly floored him that only a miracle, it
seemed, could bring him to his feet again. But
he got there and, what?s more (with a shrug), came
out on top in the end?smiling. Really remark-
able ! Well, gentlemen, this is my tram. Good
evening to you ! ?
An hour later Tony joined his enthusiastic circle
of friends at the ? Royal,? and was accorded a great
reception. He was ready for something to eat, too,
and for the first time for weeks past proceeded to
enjoy a really good hearty ? blow-out.?
? Well, Tony, my lad,? said his father proudly,
as the gay company seated themselves for


dinner, ? you did remarkably well this after-
noon.?
? Thanks, pater ! But, by Jove, it was a near go !
That chap, Maloney, hardly deserved to lose, I
think, I simply hated having to knock him out.
And golly! it took some hammering to do it.
Poor devil! He was nearly blind, you know. I
believe, if it hadn?t been for that, he?d have floored
me pretty quick. I felt dinkum sorry for him,?
? But,? protested Wilfred, ? I don?t think
Maloney had much go in him after that pounding
in the face. It was not only his bunged eye that
was at fault.?
? By Jove, he had tons of life left in him till just
at the finish ! But it was of no use to him. Unable
to see, he could only strike out blindly and to little
purpose. It was a waste of energy. He saw it
himself in the end, and I believe it was that which
took all the heart out of him.?
? Well, all?s fair in war, you know, son,? replied
his father. ? Altogether it was a clean fight, and
I?m very glad I came to see it. But mind, lad,
you?re not taking up this sort of thing as a profes-
sion ! ?
? Never fear, pater ! It doesn?t appeal to me
like that. One would have to be a bit of a bully,
I guess, to be a professional boxer, and I hate having
to punch another fellow?s face to jelly. Ugh ! no
good for this chicken. ?Twas bad enough this
afternoon, and ?twill take me a day or two to get
over the thought of poor old Pat Maloney.?


CHAPTER XXVI
Tony Satisfied
FOUR years later Tony Wainwright, having
worked his way into the Melbourne University,
was about to quit it suddenly for good and all
after a varsity career of only two years. It had
been a brilliant two years. Though feeling highly
elated at the cause of this sudden termination of
his studies in Melbourne, young Wainwright, now
in his twenty-first year, was somewhat downcast to
boot. The varsity life at Melbourne had made a
deep appeal to him, and he had entered into it with
zest. ? Dear old Varsity ! ? he mused to himself,
taking a last look back upon the scenes which had
become so endeared to him. Ten minutes later,
however, he boarded a swift car to convey him
upon the long journey to his out-back home.
Musing to himself as he was borne swiftly through
the maze of streets in the city, the thought occurred
to him : ? I suppose they know nought of this at
home yet. By Jove, what a surprise for them ! I
guess I?ll keep it dark and let them find it out for
themselves from headquarters.?
It was about six o?clock in the evening when the
pulsating car drew up at the steps of the old
familiar homestead. Evidently he had not been


expected at that hour, for there was no one to
welcome him home. He was quickly indoors,
however, and when his six feet of muscularity,
framed by the doorway which led into the dining-
room, was observed, there was no question of the
eager welcome which awaited him.
Wilfred, the companion of so many of his esca-
pades in the past, was now at a solicitor?s office in
Sydney. Cyril, a budding architect, was still in
Melbourne, With the absence of his eldest sister
also, it was a somewhat diminished family that
welcomed Tony home on this occasion. Marion,
he noticed, was now quite a young lady, while
Molly Tony could scarce take in Molly at
all; she had grown these last few years almost
beyond recognition.
The surprises and welcomes have expended them-
selves, the family was summoned to the supper-table.
? Well, boy,? began his father, after all were
happily seated, ? what?s the latest news ? Any-
thing startling ? ?
? Oh, no, pater, nothing very startling,? smiled
Tony guardedly. ? Glad to be home again, I can
tell you.?
? Well, you?re a nice one ! ? exclaimed Marion.
? Just back from the city and no more news for
us poor out-backers than that ! You are the
latest ! ?
? Oh, well,? was the reply, ? Sydney just licked
us at cricket last week, if that?s any interest to you.?
? Stale news ! We saw that in the Argus.
Congrats, though, on your innings.?


? Thanks ! Now, let me see ?for a real tit-bit. I
have it ! Jimmy Jenks, our physiologist professor,
had twins the other day.?
? Twins ! What are you talking about ? Jimmy
Jenks had twins ! ?
? Yes?or, rather, his wife. Such sweet little
things. He invited some of us in to celebrate the
occasion, and quite surpassed himself in delivering
a lecture on the spot on the all-important topic
of ?
? Oh, do shut up ! Isn?t he silly, Mummy ?
Who wants to hear about Jimmy Jenks and his
twins ? Who?s Jimmy Jenks, anyway ? Never
heard of him before.?
? Why, he?s ?
? Oh, shut up, do! Tell us something more
interesting.?
? Well, you tell me something for a change, then.
How are they all over at 1 Convenor ? ? ?
? Fine ! Great do over there to-morrow night?
Reg?s twenty-first birthday party.?
? Dear old Reg ! Have they invited us ? ?
? Of course they have ! ?
? Will Phyllis be there ? ? A trifle bashfully.
? Yes, of course ?if she arrives home from her
school hols, in time.?
? Bonzer ! Pater and Mater going too ? ?
? Yes, we?re all to go,? smiled Tony?s mother.
? They?d accept no excuses.?
? Betterer and betterer,? said Tony. ? How are
we going ? ?
? You and I are to ride over in the evening,?


Marion informed him. ? I have to wait behind till
then to attend to old Topsy, the cow. The others
are all going over in the afternoon.?
The following evening Tony and Marion set
out together on horseback for ? Convenor.? On
arrival Tony was much struck with the aged
appearance of Colonel Stafford. He found that
the dear old man?s hair had whitened of recent
years, and that the colonel had grown woefully
thin and shaky on his legs. But the old soldier was
as jolly as ever, and as versatile. His mind was in
no way impaired. He now welcomed the new
arrivals heartily. Tony always felt at home with
the colonel. All young folks did.
? Ah, Tony lad, how you?ve grown! Why
aren?t you a soldier ? ? he exclaimed. ? Why, in
the Punjabs ?
? Punjabs ! ? exclaimed Mrs. Stafford, suddenly
coming upon them. ? Father dear, we?re at ? Con-
venor ? now. Do let the Punjabs be this evening.
Now, Tony and Marion dears, come in and take off
your things.?
? Reg home, Mrs. Stafford ? ? inquired Tony.
? He?ll be in shortly, I hope. He generally gets
in about six o?clock.?
? And Phyllis ? ? added Marion.
?We expect her back this evening. She?s been
spending a few days with some of Keith?s friends
in New South Wales.?
? Oh, of course ! ? exclaimed Tony. ? I?d quite


forgotten old Keith had gone to ? New South.? My,
how scattered we?re all becoming ! ?
But it was Phyllis who was chiefly occupying
Tony?s thoughts. During the past four years he
had seen very little of this wild harum-scarum of
his old boyish escapades. Phyllis had gone to finish
her schooling in Sydney and, owing to the distance,
had not always returned home for her vacations.
? Hullo, Tony, old top ! ? bawled Reg, looking
in at the doorway. ?No mistaking Old Nick
when he?s about, you know. How do, Marion ?
Excuse me a moment. Will just get rid of some
of this grime. Won?t be a tick.?
? Come, you old ass, and shake hands ! ? ex-
claimed Tony eagerly. ? Many happy returns, old
cock ! That?s right. Now ?get ! ?
As Reg dived out of the room Colonel Stafford
once more took possession of his young friend.
? How have the exams been going of late ?? he
asked.
? Oh, just so-so, Colonel Stafford. Pm hoping
for the best.?
? I think you need not worry,? was the reply.
? By Jove, you?ve brought off some sports trophies !
Your poor mother doesn?t know what to do with
them all. And doesn?t she just treasure them ! ?
? Well, I?ve certainly enjoyed myself, both at
the school and varsity. But that doesn?t fit one
out for life, does it ? ?
? Tut-tut ! Better than all the rest put together
?providing, of course, you?ve done sufficient of the
other to see you through. It?s men we want chiefly


in this world. Got too many bent-shouldered book-
worms already. They can neither swing an axe nor
ride a donkey ! They?re all right for their high-
browed theories. But the world?s tired of theories.
Give me a man who can hold his own amongst
men. That?s life ?as God meant it?isn?t it ? ?
? That?s important, I admit,? was the reply.
? But, you know, we don?t want to become intel-
lectually degenerate, Colonel Stafford. If we?ve
evolved or emanated from the ape or baboon, we
must guard against a return to that unsophisticated
mode of existence, you know.?
? Apes and baboons be hanged ! ? bawled the
old colonel in a rage, getting on to his feet. ? I
haven?t seen Darwin?s photograph, my lad, but I
shouldn?t mind hazarding a guess that he himself
bore a very fair resemblance to such creatures.
Apes and baboons ! Apes and baboons ! ? the old
soldier ejaculated, strutting shakily the while to
and fro on the hearth-rug.
? Well, even apes and baboons have to eat?
suddenly chimed in Mrs. Stafford smilingly. ?So
come along, father and Tony ! Supper?s all ready.?
? Gad, I like that ! ? chuckled the colonel, and
all laughed heartily.
As Tony, for the purpose of drawing on the old
soldier, kept the ball rolling on the subject of
evolution, the evening meal proved an occasion of
uproarious hilarity. At its conclusion the grinding
of a car on its low gear ascending the steep rise to
the house denoted the homecoming of Phyllis
Stafford.


All then went out on to the verandah. Even
before the car drew to a standstill there was
heard a whoop and a yell. Then, vaulting over
the side of the tourer, Phyllis made a dive for her
father and speedily coiled her arms round his neck.
After a long and warm embrace, she treated her
mother and Reg to a similar affectionate greeting.
Full of vim, she next turned to her old friends.
Then, laughing and chatting gaily, the party
returned indoors. Phyllis now kept everyone fully
alive, and few of them could succeed in getting a
word in edgeways. The new arrival was so brimful
of her school, her friends, and of hockey and tennis,
that she was trying vainly to get it all out in a
breath.
? Oh, I forgot to tell you, Reg,? she pattered
on. ? Guess I can lick the whole lot of you at
swimming now. Look ! ? releasing from her neck
a chain upon which was suspended a highly-
burnished gold medal.
? Good for you, sis ! ? was the reply. ? Knew
you?d do it.?
? Oh, how?s Moses ? ? was her next diversion.
(Moses was the bull terrier, so named by Phyllis
because of his one-time habit, when hungry, of
seizing his empty porcelain platter between his
teeth and dashing it to fragments.)
? Moses ? Oh, still going strong.?
? And Horeb ? ?
? Oh, you wouldn?t know Horeb now. He?s no
longer the little yellow Jersey of two years ago.
Grown into a fine beast.?


? Well, I?m glad, anyway, he hasn?t yet suffered
the fate of Aaron?s golden calf.?
Phyllis had a Biblical name for most of her pets.
Even her pony was named Josh (short for Joshua),
because of his habit of invading territories not his
own.
? Come along, you children ! ? playfully pro-
tested the colonel when Phyllis had finished her
supper. ? Don?t talk so much and give us old
?uns a chance ! Let?s have some music ! ?
? Really, Daddy, I can?t play to-night. What
about a good old folk-dance on the lawn ? Mummy
darling, you play something, will you ? And we?ll
open the window so that we shall be able to hear
the music outside.?
The colonel, however, seeing his daughter was
bent on this idea, and not relishing the thought of
a dance with his gammy leg, offered his own
services at the piano, and was quickly strumming
off a wild, old-fashioned polka.
Reg and Phyllis hauled their mother and Mr.
and Mrs. Wainwright out of doors, and presently,
to the accompaniment of the piano within, and
shrieks of laughter without, the gay little party
were hugely enjoying themselves. Molly stood out
for the first dance, urging her father and mother
to dance instead. On her own, however, she danced
rapturously in watching her father cutting some
youthful capers on the lawn.
At the end of an hour the old colonel shouted
through the window : ? Here, I say ! where do I
come in ? Don?t you think it?s my turn now ? ?


? Yes, come on, Popsy! ? laughed Phyllis.
? Pve reserved an extra special for you.?
But now the dancers all returned indoors, and
Phyllis, realizing that it really was up to her to
give her father an innings, sat down to the piano
and reeled off several pieces of Beethoven and
Mendelssohn. Then she and Tony sang a few
solos and, to finish up with, a little duet which
they had often sung together in happy days gone
by. It brought the joyous past vividly back again
to their imaginations. More than once while they
sang their eyes chanced to meet, and happy smiles
overspread their faces.
Tony was by this time serenely happy. Earlier
in the evening, overcome by a few twinges of
jealousy, he had been sunk in gloom. Phyllis, so
full of her news and of her pets, had scarcely spoken
to him.
? Well, my dear old Solomon ! ? the girl had
said to him on one occasion. ? Cheer up, old
fellow ! Methinks much learning doth make thee
miserable.?
But now a silver lining had dispersed the clouds.
Tony with Phyllis beside him was a Tony trans-
formed, and his star shone bright. He could have
gone on singing thus for hours. A clatter of glasses
and decanters, however, was the signal for some
further refreshments. A huge iced cake was then
borne triumphantly into the room and placed on
the central table. Surrounding the cake were
twenty-one diminutive wax candles, all ablaze with
light. Here Reg came in for a fair share of banter.


Molly, going now to the piano, commenced to strum
an appropriate piece, to which the jolly company
responded with vigour :
? Twenty-one to-day !
Twenty-one to-day !
I?ve got the key of the door,
Never been tw r enty-one before.
Father says I can do as I please,
So hip-hip-hip-hooray !
He?s a jolly good fellow ?
Twenty-one to-day ! ?
When the glasses had been charged ?some with
port, others with lemonade ?Reg?s toast was
drunk, following a neat little speech by his old-time
playmate.
Mr. Wainwright and the colonel, shortly after
this, retired on to the verandah to enjoy their cigars
in peace. The verandah, brilliantly illuminated for
the occasion, afforded them a cool respite from the
closer and more stuffy atmosphere which prevailed
indoors. In the midst of an animated discussion
on an acute political situation brought to pass by a
recent General Election the colonel suddenly
recollected that perhaps Phyllis had brought home
with her that day?s Argus , which generally came
to hand at ? Convenor ? on the day following its
publication. Eagerly he arose from his lounge chair
and limped away to find his daughter. A few
moments later, sure enough, he returned bearing
in his hands the priceless organ of news. ? ? Labour
gains vastly all over the country,? ? he presently


quoted from the Argus. ? What?s poor old Aus-
tralia coming to, I wonder ? Just see here, Wain-
wright! ?
? Astounding, is it not ? ? was the reply.
? I really cannot understand it. These people
who put up for Parliament nowadays are almost
entirely uneducated. Any Tom, Dick or Harry
now goes to the poll. It wouldn?t be so bad if they
or their policy were tempered with sanity. But
they?re mad ? mad. They?ll bring the country to
a hopeless ruin. What?s come over the electors
that they return such riff-raff I cannot under-
stand.?
? Well, you know,? was the reply, ? Australia?s
a democratic country; and, after all, the un-
educated workers are in the majority. I guess,
therefore, they are entitled to a proportionate
representation in the legislature. In these days
of party politics an M.P. has merely to register
his vote in Parliament. It is not required of him
to be the possessor of brains. He is the mere dupe
of his party.?
? But what a scandalous state of affairs ! ?
? I shouldn?t mind the Labour gains you speak
of, my friend, if only we could keep out the ex-
tremists. A good, sane Labour Government would,
I believe, be an excellent thing for the country.
But that we should be the dupes of Russia ?
// 11 1 . . . .
? Ah, that?s it ! That?s just the point ! ? ex-
claimed the colonel, turning over the leaves of his
newspaper. ? Hello !. . . What?s this ?. . .
Jimimy ! I say, Wainwright, have you seen this ? ?


? What is it ? ?
? Something about your boy, Tony.?
? No. What does it say ? ?
? Here?s his photograph, too. What an excellent
likeness! Read the paragraph yourself, Wain-
wright.?
? No, my friend ; I?d much rather you read it
to me.?
? Well, then, listen :
? ? The Melbourne Selection Board in connection
with the Cecil Rhodes Scholarship Trust Fund has,
during the past few weeks, been busily engaged
upon its allotted annual task. The selection of a
suitable scholar to meet in full the requirements
of the will of the late Cecil Rhodes is an arduous
and difficult task for the Board. As is well known,
such requirements demand from a candidate much
more than mere scholastic attainments. The great
statesman-philanthropist, in a letter which is now
historical, himself expressed his views on this point
as follows : ?In awarding the scholarships great
consideration shall be given to those who have
shown during schooldays that they have instincts
to lead and take an interest in their schoolmates,
which attributes will be likely in after life to guide
them to esteem the performance of public duties as
their highest aim. The last thing I want is a book-
worm.? This year the difficult task of the Board
has not been lightened by the fact that four candi-
dates, all thoroughly worthy of selection, were in
the running. Its final choice, however, has fallen
upon a brilliant young scholar and athlete, by name


Tony Wainwright, of Melbourne University. Young
Mr. Wainwright ?he is not yet twenty-one years of
age ?entered Melbourne University only two years
ago ; but his reputation as an athlete had preceded
his advent thither. Only last week, it will be
recalled, this young gentleman scored a memorable
century in the cricket match with the great rival
university of Sydney. From all accounts, the
Rhodes Selection Board has fulfilled its task
worthily. We join, with others, in congratulating
this fortunate young gentleman. When he pro-
ceeds to Oxford University, in the old Homeland,
he may be assured of the good wishes of all Vic-
torians. Needless to say, his future career will be
followed with keen interest, not only by his old
Alma Mater, but by all his fellow-countrymen.?
?By Jove, that?s wonderful! ? exclaimed the
colonel.
?It is. I can?t yet understand ?
? Do you mean to tell me this is the first you?ve
heard about it ? ?
? Yes ?absolutely ! ?
? Did Tony himself say nothing of it ? ?
? Not a word. Indeed, I noticed that he was
most uncommunicative about university news when
he returned home last night.?
?So did I this evening. Amazing ! But, by
Jove, that?s Tony all over. Did I not tell you nine
years ago, Wainwright, that your boy would turn
out trumps ? Do you remember the occasion ? I
have not been a soldier for nothing ; I can read
character as another man can read a book. Your


boy has only received his deserts. But come along
inside, my friend. The others will all be glad to
hear this news. We?ll make Tony face the music,
too, by Jove ! ?
Proceeding indoors the colonel and Mr. Wain-
wright found much jollification still going on.
Suddenly, however ?and rather dramatically?the
old soldier reduced the noisy revellers to silence.
All eyes were then fixed upon him ?in great wonder-
ment as to what was coming. ? Ladies and gentle-
men,? he began, in mock seriousness, ? I have some
really very important and interesting news for you.
Now, being an old soldier, and, therefore, not very
adept in the art of speech-making, if you will
remain very quiet and attentive, I shall read to
you a paragraph from this newspaper, and it will
tell its own story.?
Here Tony, guessing what was coming and
murmuring an excuse about having to attend to
the horses in preparation for their homeward
journey, made an attempt to quit the room. The
colonel, however, was one too many for him, and
stood unmoved with his back firmly planted against
the door.
? Ladies and gentlemen, lend me your ears ! ?
resumed the colonel jocularly, quite ignoring the
abashed young man at his side. Then, amid a
wondering silence, he proceeded to read aloud from
the Argus the all-important item of news. Having
finally come to the end, he added : ? You all know,
of course, what this means ? It means that we are
about to lose this young man from our midst. In


the course of a few weeks he will doubtless be
proceeding to a more exalted seat of learning ?to
Oxford University, in the Old Land. For years
now I have watched with very great interest Tony
Wainwright?s progress in life, and therefore to
me this latest news is no real surprise. Tony, my
boy, I congratulate you heartily, though you
deserve to be thoroughly castigated for being so
reticent. . . .?
Ere the old soldier could proceed any further
Tony?s mother rushed eagerly over to her boy and
warmly embraced him. ? Tony ? darling, I?m so
glad ! ? was all she could say.
Then his father took him affectionately by the
hand. ? I?m proud of you, son,? he said. ? You?re
a credit to the family. But why ?-why have you
kept us so in the dark ? ?
? Sorry, pater ! But I knew you?d be officially
informed, and, to tell the truth, I funked letting on
about it.?
Presently Tony found himself firmly wedged in
by an admiring, enthusiastic circle of friends and
relatives, all endeavouring to congratulate him
simultaneously. Then Reg commenced ragging him
for being such a dark horse, and finally Tony was
called upon for a speech,
? Colonel Stafford,? he commenced, ? thanks for
all you?ve said. I?ve owed much to you in the past.
I shall not forget how you?ve helped me. For the
rest, I guessed this news would prove a bit of a
shock, and I hadn?t the face ?courage, if you like
?to let on about it, so I hope you?ll all forgive me.


I don?t know why the Board chose me for this
honour. But there it is. Anyhow, it?s not worth
making such a song about. Thanks, pater and
mater, all the same ?and all of you ?for your many
good wishes and congratulations.?
? Well done, Tony ! ? shouted Reg enthusiasti-
cally, noting his friend?s abashment in the awkward
predicament in which he found himself.
But at that moment Tony, catching his mother?s
eye, smiled and felt immediate relief. ? Mummy,?
he whispered, in mock imitation of his childhood
days, ? you see I haven?t yet properly learned that
lesson you gave me on Prevalication, have I ? ?
? Yes, my darling, I think you have.?
The radiant countenance of his mother, be-
speaking pride unutterable in her son as she uttered
these words, proved all-sufficient. Tony was
satisfied.
