Died at her Residence,
“RAEDAWN,” ORPINGTON STREET, ASHFIELD,
MARCH 29th, 1908.
“Is it well with thee ? It is well,”—2 Kings, 4 ch., 26 v.
Hushed by the silence of the midnight hour,
As it drew near upon that Sabbath day.
Grief stricken hearts watched o’er as sweet a flower
As ever bloomed, but soon to pass away.
Bright as a ray of sunshine ; true as steel;
Sadness could not endure if she were nigh;
Possessed of genius she would fain conceal,
The future promised her a cloudless sky.
We cannot lift the veil, we cannot see
The heavy cross we yet may have to bear ;
It comes unbidden —’tis oiu- destiny.
Which none can tiun aside, prevent or share.
It must be borne alone ; yet not alone,
For Jesus hears His children's anguished cry;
He bears their burden as He bore His own ;
“Be not afraid,” He whispers; “It is I.”
A cloudless sky ! Alas ! ’twas not to be;
A cross—a cruel cross too hard to bear,
Was boiTie in patience and expectancy
Of that great change for which all must prepare.
Through all her suffering she had a smile
And kindlj' word for those she loved to meet;
Deep was her friendship, free from taint of guile.
While gratitude shone forth like fragrance sweet.
And when too weak to speak, those eyes revealed
Unspoken volumes, closed for ever now.
Of joys and sorrows, grief long, long concealed.
That left its mark upon that placid brow.
To husband, mother, sister, darling child.
She bade a loving and a last adieu;
At peace with God, serene and reconciled,
A flood of Glory burst upon her view.
A sign she gave; they lifted her with care;
She lay her drooping head on mother’s breast
And nestled closely down, and resting there.
Passed peacefully to her eternal rest.
Ashfield,
S.E.W.
April, 1908.
